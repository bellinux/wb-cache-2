5|$|<b>Early</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> section Heilmann embarks on a {{thorough}} {{description of the}} Berlin Archaeopteryx specimen, which includes detailed comparisons to specific aspects of modern birds. Following a comparison of its skull to that of Aetosaurus, Euparkeria, and a modern pigeon, Heilmann states that he disagrees with the scientific consensus {{of the time that}} the skull of Archaeopteryx is that of a true bird. He writes that the reptilian features of the skull are much more pronounced, citing features of the teeth, fenestrae, and jaw structure as being undeniably un-birdlike. Heilmann found that much of Archaeopteryxs anatomy, in fact, was decidedly reptilian and generally opposed to that of modern birds. This included the pelvis, which lacks a pectineal process and has a very different os sacrum from modern birds, as well as the carpus, which Heilmann wrote exhibited the same phenomena found in the wrists of modern reptiles. Its tail was also noted by Heilmann as being extremely reptilian and resembling nothing known of modern birds.|$|E
5|$|When the {{legislature}} {{met for the}} first time after the 1909 election, things seemed to be going well for Rutherford and his government. He controlled a huge majority, albeit slightly reduced from the 1905 election, and enjoyed widespread popularity. His government had achieved significant success in setting up a new province, and this success looked poised to continue. <b>Early</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> new legislative session, however, two signs of trouble appeared: Liberal backbencher John R. Boyle began to ask questions about the agreement between the government and the Alberta and Great Waterways Railway Company, and Cushing resigned from cabinet over his views of this same agreement.|$|E

Dennison also developed alliances with Al Capone in Chicago and Tom Pendergast in Kansas City.

25|$|The Vedas were {{composed}} and orally transmitted by speakers of an Old Indo-Aryan language who had migrated into the northwestern regions of South Asia <b>early</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> period. The associated culture, {{also called the}} Vedic culture, was tribal and pastoral until 1200 BCE, and centred in the Punjab. It then spread eastward to the Ganges Plain, becoming more agricultural and settled. The Vedic period saw {{the emergence of a}} hierarchy of social classes and later of monarchical, state-level polities. Archaeological cultures identified with phases of Vedic material culture include the Ochre Coloured Pottery culture, the Gandhara Grave culture, the Black and red ware culture and the Painted Grey Ware culture.|$|E
25|$|Beethoven did not {{immediately}} set out to establish himself as a composer, but rather devoted himself to study and performance. Working under Haydn's direction, he sought to master counterpoint. He also studied violin under Ignaz Schuppanzigh. <b>Early</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> period, he also began receiving occasional instruction from Antonio Salieri, primarily in Italian vocal composition style; this relationship persisted until at least 1802, and possibly 1809. With Haydn's departure for England in 1794, Beethoven was expected by the Elector to return home. He chose instead to remain in Vienna, continuing his instruction in counterpoint with Johann Albrechtsberger and other teachers. Although his stipend from the Elector expired, a number of Viennese noblemen had already recognised his ability and offered him financial support, among them Prince Joseph Franz Lobkowitz, Prince Karl Lichnowsky, and Baron Gottfried van Swieten.|$|E
25|$|In late July 1947 the Dutch {{launched}} Operatie Product, which {{aimed to}} capture important economic {{facilities in the}} NEI. This campaign was {{also referred to as}} the First Police Action. At this time No. 120 Squadron was still located at Semarang and was equipped with nine Kittyhawks instead of the 19 it was authorised. <b>Early</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> operation the squadron attacked Solo and Madiun and claimed to have destroyed eight Indonesian aircraft on the ground. A strike on Jakarta was delayed by fog; this may have saved the life of Indonesian Prime Minister Sutan Sjahrir as he left the city on board a C-47 Dakota transport at about the time the Kittyhawks were originally scheduled to arrive. During the First Police Action No. 120 Squadron, like the other units of the NEIAF, provided support to Army units. The First Police Action ended on 4 August, though NEIAF aircraft continued to attack Indonesian positions.|$|E

25|$|In later {{books of}} the Old Testament, Aaron and his kin are not {{mentioned}} very often except in literature dating to the Babylonian Exile and later. The books of Judges, Samuel and Kings mention priests and Levites, but do not mention the Aaronides in particular. The book of Ezekiel, which devotes much attention to priestly matters, calls the priestly upper class the Zadokites after one of King David's priests. It does reflect a two-tier priesthood with the Levites in subordinate position. A two-tier hierarchy of Aaronides and Levites appears in Ezra, Nehemiah and Chronicles. As a result, many historians think that Aaronide families did not control the priesthood in pre-exilic Israel. What {{is clear is that}} high priests claiming Aaronide descent dominated the Second Temple period. Most scholars think the Pentateuch reached its final form <b>early</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> period, which may account for Aaron's prominence in Exodus, Leviticus and Numbers.|$|E
25|$|Ancient India {{represented}} a distinct tradition of law, {{and had an}} historically independent school of legal theory and practice. The Arthashastra, dating from 400 BCE and the Manusmriti, from 100 CE, were influential treatises in India, texts that were considered authoritative legal guidance. Manu's central philosophy was tolerance and pluralism, and was cited across Southeast Asia. <b>Early</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> period, which finally culminated {{in the creation of}} the Gupta Empire, relations with ancient Greece and Rome were not infrequent. The appearance of similar fundamental institutions of international law in various parts of the world show that they are inherent in international society, irrespective of culture and tradition. Inter-State relations in the pre-Islamic period resulted in clear-cut rules of warfare of a high humanitarian standard, in rules of neutrality, of treaty law, of customary law embodied in religious charters, in exchange of embassies of a temporary or semi-permanent character.|$|E
500|$|About 500 {{million years}} ago, plants and fungi colonised {{the land and}} were soon {{followed}} by arthropods and other animals.
