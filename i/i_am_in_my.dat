I have no fear of making changes, {{destroying}} the image, etc., because the painting has {{a life of its}} own. I try to let it come through. It is only when I lose contact with the painting that the result is a mess. Otherwise there is pure harmony, an easy give and take, and the painting comes out well.|$|E

"Tuscan Leather" [...] {{generated}} controversy with label mate Nicki Minaj for the line: [...] "Not even talkin' to Nicki, {{communication is}} breakin' / I {{dropped the ball}} on some personal shit, I need to embrace it / I'm honest, I make mistakes, I'd be the second to admit it / Think that's why I need her in my life, to check me when I'm trippin'," [...] Speaking of the line, Drake {{said in an interview}} with MTV News: [...] "That line in 'Tuscan Leather' isn't exactly where <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life right now, but like a year ago...eight months, seven months ago, it was how I felt, I'd done something wrong, and I wasn't speaking to her." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1965, {{she opened}} the front door of Kenwood to see a man who [...] "looked like a tramp", but with her husband's features. He {{explained}} that he was Alfred Lennon, the father whom Lennon had supposedly not seen for years. Lennon was annoyed when he came home, telling {{her for the first time}} that his father had visited the NEMS office, Epstein's business, a few weeks before. Three years after the meeting in the NEMS office, Alfred Lennon (who was then 56 years old) turned up at Kenwood again with his fiancée, 19-year-old student Pauline Jones. He asked if the Lennons could give Pauline a job, so she was hired to help with Julian and the piles of Beatles' fan mail. Lennon's father and his fiancée then spent a few months living in the attic bedroom. During an interview at Kenwood with Evening Standard reporter Maureen Cleave, Lennon said, [...] "Here <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> Hansel and Gretel house, famous and loaded, and I can't go anywhere. There's something else I'm going to do, only I don't know what it is, but I do know this isn't it for me".|$|E

Last night one of our boys was found shot and his stomach cut open. Immediately orders were received from General Wheaton to burn the town and kill every native in sight; which was done to a finish. About 1,000 men, {{women and children were}} reported killed. I am probably growing hard-hearted, for <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> glory when I can sight my gun on some dark skin and pull the trigger." ...|$|E
2500|$|While the {{original}} version of K.I.S.S. contains J-pop songs, Mýa says the deluxe edition is more of her traditional style. [...] "It's R, urban [...] also pop. It's fun, young with perspective and opinion." [...] There are up-tempo tracks, as well as ballads, like [...] "Love Comes Love Goes", that tackle [...] "deeper issues". Harrison singles out [...] "Evolve", a [...] "heartfelt, mid-tempo" [...] song {{as one of her}} favorites. [...] " [...] about having determination and will power through it all... and not letting anything stop you," [...] Mýa says. [...] "It represents where <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life." [...] The overall concept of K.I.S.S. is simplicity.|$|E

[...] Cleverly had been concerned following the legal wranglings between promoter Frank Warren and his former stablemate Joe Calzaghe and added [...] "I cannot take any chances with my career... I take boxing very seriously and want to be world champion. Hopefully Frank can sort that out for me." ...|$|E

2500|$|In October 2010, Sparks {{released}} her debut fragrance, [...] "Because of You...." [...] This fragrance was exclusively distributed at first by [...] Dots Department Stores, but by November was {{made available to}} other retail stores. Sparks wanted this product to be affordable for her fans, yet still high end. [...] "When I was starting this project, I really {{wanted it to be}} affordable. I looked at some other celebrity fragrances, and they were like $80. Even now, I look at a fragrance that's $80, and I can't bring myself to spend that much."

2500|$|As {{with her}} {{previous}} albums thematical prime focus on Afrodisiac is on [...] "relationship {{with love and}} life in general." [...] "It's about passion. It's romantic, and that's where <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life right now," [...] Norwood noted during promotion touring in 2004, {{a time when she}} was engaged to New York Knicks guard Quentin Richardson. [...] "I'm not trying to be edgy, sassy, romantic, vulnerable or whatever emotions come across," [...] she said. [...] "I really am all that." [...] Afrodisiac contains several references to Timbaland and longtime partner Missy Elliott, and alludes to fellow 1990s R singers such as Aaliyah and Monica. The album's opening track [...] "Who I Am" [...] discusses her rocky relationship with Robert Smith as well as the progression of her public image, while [...] "I Tried" [...] was heavily inspired by English rock band Coldplay, also incorporating lyrics of their 2000 song [...] "Sparks." [...] The tenth track [...] "Turn It Up" [...] is an homage to the early 1990s with references to Donnie Simpson's Video Soul, Kid n' Play, their 1990 film House Party and Tony! Toni! Toné!'s 1996 studio album House of Music. The line [...] "'Cause I don't wanna sound familiar, want a guaranteed single, not an album filler" [...] levels indirect criticism at former main producer Rodney Jerkins. On ending track [...] "Should I Go," [...] which samples Coldplay's [...] "Clocks," [...] Norwood openly talks about contemplating stepping away from the music business, admitting that she's {{trying to figure out where}} she fits in today.|$|E
