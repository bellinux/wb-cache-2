500|$|On August 8, 2004—with 86days to {{go before}} the general election—the Illinois Republican Party drafted Alan Keyes to run against Democratic state senator Barack Obama for the U.S. Senate, after the Republican nominee, Jack Ryan, withdrew due to a sex scandal, and other {{potential}} draftees (most notably former Illinois governor Jim Edgar and former Chicago Bears coach Mike Ditka) declined to run. The Washington Post called Keyes a [...] "carpetbagger" [...] since he [...] "had never lived in Illinois." [...] When asked to answer charges of carpetbagging in the context of his earlier criticism of Hillary Clinton, he called her campaign [...] "pure and planned selfish ambition", but stated that in his case he felt a moral obligation to run after being asked to by the Illinois Republican Party. [...] "You are <b>doing</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> believe to be required by your respect for God's will, and I think that that's what I'm doing in Illinois".|$|E

But the fans who {{followed}} him always {{knew there was a}} hide behind that who was a very solid character. He was very outspoken about freedom and <b>doing</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> want". His compositions [...] "often set the tone of alienation and frustration for which X Japan was revered." [...] Radio and TV host Bryan Burton-Lewis explained [...] "In Japan, the image that we have of the X audience is rural kids going through a rebellion phase", [...] "they all talk about how [...] gave them something to live for." [...] Japanese DJ Maki Yanai believes fans saw in him the rebel society would not allow them to be.|$|E
2500|$|However, Peniston herself {{seemed to}} be not worried about losing her audience, when interviewed {{at the time of}} I'm Movin' On release by Billboard: [...] "When you're first coming out as an artist, many times label {{executives}} have their own vision for you. But as you move forward, it's only fair that you begin determining your own direction. People will make the change with you as long as you’re honest about your craft and display a comfort for what it is that you’re doing," [...] two years later Peniston actually confirmed her doubts, after being questioned by the magazine: [...] "I can speak about this firsthand, believe me. Sometimes <b>doing</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> feel isn’t always accepted by the public. You’ve got to choose {{where you want to go}} and be consistent," [...] (said by the artist at the 5th annual Billboard Dance Music Summit that urged members of the dance music community to work together toward greater credibility, visibility and sales for the genre, held July 8–10 in 1998).|$|E
