5|$|The king {{determined}} the tax levels based on need and circumstances {{in the kingdom}} while ensuring that an undue burden was not placed on the peasants. The land owner or tenant paid a variety of taxes, including land taxes, produce taxes and payment of the overhead for maintenance of the Gavunda (village head). Land taxes were varied, based on type of land, its produce and situation and ranged from 8% to 16%. A Banavasi inscription of 941 mentions reassessment of land tax due to the drying up of an old <b>irrigation</b> <b>canal</b> in the region. The land tax may have been as high as 20% to pay for expenses of a military frequently at war. In most of the kingdom, land taxes were paid in goods and services and rarely was cash accepted. A portion of all taxes earned by the government (usually 15%) was returned to the villages for maintenance.|$|E
5|$|While {{moving through}} the Philippines, Linfa caused {{flooding}} and four separate landslides. The storm's heavy rainfall caused water levels to rise in reservoirs, prompting officials to drain some excess waters from the Binga Dam in Benguet province. Schools were closed in Metro Manila for three days due to flooding and landslides. The storm damaged 18sections of roads, {{as well as two}} bridges and an <b>irrigation</b> <b>canal</b> in San Gabriel, La Union. Slick roads and a fallen tree caused a bus accident in Quezon City, injuring ten people. Portions of Luzon lost power during the storm, including the entirety of La Union province, and Bacnotan briefly lost water access. In the Ilocos region, a Chinese fishing vessel docked at Currimao port ran aground after being battered by huge waves. Three days of high waves washed 30tons of mussels ashore Valladolid, Negros Occidental, prompting officials to use trucks to bury the rotting shells {{to prevent the spread of}} disease. Rough waves also disrupted rescue efforts for an unrelated ferry disaster in the country that killed 54. The storm interacted with the monsoon to spawn two tornadoes in Negros Occidental, as well as strong winds that knocked down trees and billboards. Across Luzon, Linfa damaged 198houses and destroyed another seven. The storm damaged ₱34million ($71,000 USD) worth of crops, and total damage reached ₱214.6 million ($4.8 million USD). Most of the power outages were repaired within a few days of Linfa's passage. After the storm, officials distributed meals to affected residents.|$|E

40|$|Historical {{records and}} archaeological discoveries {{have shown that}} prosperous {{agricultural}} activities developed in the ancient Juyan Oasis of northwestern China, an important oasis that once flourished on the ancient Silk Road. However, how the <b>irrigation</b> <b>canals</b> were distributed in historical time was unknown. Here, we identified and mapped the spatial distribution of ancient abandoned <b>irrigation</b> <b>canals</b> that were built using CORONA photographs and field inspections. This work found that ancient <b>irrigation</b> <b>canals</b> are large-scale and distributed throughout the desertified environment, with three hierarchical organization of first-, second-, and third-order <b>irrigation</b> <b>canals</b> (the total length of the first- and second-order-irrigation canals is dramatically more than 392 km). This study further indicates that ancient irrigation methods and modern irrigation systems in arid regions of China share the same basic irrigation design. New visual and fine-scale evidence and spatial distribution of <b>irrigation</b> <b>canals</b> are provided to illustrate {{the development of the}} ancient irrigated agriculture that occurred in the Juyan Oasis. This work is useful for readers who are interested in the construction and organization approaches of <b>irrigation</b> <b>canals</b> used in ancient irrigated agriculture in arid regions. It also has implications for how ancient people balance the relationships between human needs and the eco-environment using reasonable water management methods, especially for decision-making in the efficient usage of limited water resources in the arid inland river basin...|$|R

25|$|Evidence for {{military}} activity {{of any kind}} {{during the reign of}} Senusret II is non-existent. Senusret instead appears to have focused on domestic issues, particularly the irrigation of the Faiyum. This multi-generational project aimed to convert the Faiyum oasis into a productive swath of farmland. Senusret eventually placed his pyramid at the site of el-Lahun, near the junction of the Nile and the Fayuum's major <b>irrigation</b> <b>canal,</b> the Bahr Yussef. He reigned only fifteen years, which is evidenced by the incomplete nature of many of his constructions. His son Senusret III succeeded him.|$|E
25|$|The {{construction}} of irrigation canals began {{on a large}} scale in the 1940s. Many of the canals were poorly built, allowing water to leak or evaporate. From the Qaraqum Canal, the largest in Central Asia, perhaps 30 to 75% of the water went to waste. Today, only 12% of Uzbekistan's <b>irrigation</b> <b>canal</b> length is waterproofed. Of the 47,750km of interfarm irrigation channels in the basin, only 28% have anti-infiltration linings. Only 77% of farm intakes have flow gauges, and of the 268,500km of onfarm channels, only 21% have anti-infiltration linings, which retain on average 15% more water than unlined channels.|$|E

40|$|ArticleThe {{relationships}} between {{water quality and}} the phytoplankton community within Lake Loskop and <b>irrigation</b> <b>canals</b> downstream were studied {{over a period of}} one year from April 2009 to March 2010. The phytoplankton assemblage in Lake Loskop during this sampling period was dominated by the phytoplankton Ceratium hirundinella, with the highest biovolume of 12. 1 mm 3 l- 1 recorded in late summer during January 2010. From the data generated the algae assemblage showed a clear trend in the two canals during the study period and also among sampling stations. The filamentous macroalgae Cladophora glomerata dominated the phytobenthos of the two <b>irrigation</b> <b>canals</b> during the whole sampling period. However, much higher biovolumes (8. 5; 6. 3 mm 3 l- 1) of Cladophora glomerata and total phosphates were observed in the long and short <b>irrigation</b> <b>canals</b> during lake overturn in the months of March and September, while much lower average biovolumes (2. 4; 1. 5 mm 3 l- 1) were recorded during the summer months. The dominance of the water column phytoplankton assemblage in the two <b>irrigation</b> <b>canals</b> by Ceratium hirundinella, Fragilaria crotonesis, Closterium stellenboschense and Closterium polystictum during autumn and spring was related to the observed lake overturn. Withdrawal of irrigation water from the upperhypolimnia during these two time periods transported phytoplankton species usually occurring in the epilimnion zone of Lake Loskop into the <b>irrigation</b> <b>canals.</b> This phenomonen resulted in these species becoming dominant during autumn in the water column of the two <b>irrigation</b> <b>canals</b> downstream of Lake Loskop. The phytoplankton assemblage data generated from this study can be used for management and control of nuisance macroalgae like Cladophora glomerata in <b>irrigation</b> <b>canals.</b> © 2011 E.

25|$|Tucson was {{probably}} first visited by Paleo-Indians, {{known to have}} been in southern Arizona about 12,000 years ago. Recent archaeological excavations near the Santa Cruz River have located a village site dating from 2100 BC. The floodplain of the Santa Cruz River was extensively farmed during the Early Agricultural Period, circa 1200 BC to AD 150. These people constructed irrigation canals and grew corn, beans, and other crops while gathering wild plants and hunting. The Early Ceramic period occupation of Tucson saw the first extensive use of pottery vessels for cooking and storage. The groups designated as the Hohokam lived in the area from AD 600 to 1450 and are known for their vast <b>irrigation</b> <b>canal</b> systems and their red-on-brown pottery.|$|E

25|$|Hohokam culture: The Hohokam was {{a culture}} {{centered}} along American Southwest. The early Hohokam founded {{a series of}} small villages along the middle Gila River. They raised corn, squash and beans. The communities were located near good arable land, with dry farming common in the earlier years of this period. They were known for their pottery, using the paddle-and-anvil technique. The Classical period of the culture saw the rise in architecture and ceramics. Buildings were grouped into walled compounds, as well as earthen platform mounds. Platform mounds were built along river as well as <b>irrigation</b> <b>canal</b> systems, suggesting these sites were administrative centers allocating water and coordinating canal labor. Polychrome pottery appeared, and inhumation burial replaced cremation. Trade included that of shells and other exotics.
