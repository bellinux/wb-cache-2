Careful analysis of Caesar's text versus modern understanding of wind, weather, tides, and siltation makes it almost certain that this was Caesar's departure port. Boulogne, Wissant, and Quentovic later became important as ports for small numbers of ships. The English side of the Channel also has many places that were Roman-era ports but are now far inland.|$|E

40|$|Modern <b>fringing</b> reefs <b>of</b> Yoron <b>Island,</b> Ryukyu Arc, Japan, {{have been}} {{investigated}} {{for the purpose of}} understanding the geomorphic development of the surface features and shallow sedimentological structure of the coral reef. Field investigations have been conducted by means of geomorphological observations, scuba divings, bathymetrical soundings and multiple shal-low drillings on a modern reef at the northeastern coast <b>of</b> the <b>island.</b> Modern <b>fringing</b> reefs <b>of</b> Yoron <b>Island</b> form a distinctive zonation of landforms, which are composed of sandy or rocky shores, a moat, a reef crest, a reef front with spurs and grooves, and outer slopes from the shore to the reef margin. The cored samples from the modern coral reef are divided into the following four facies: reef crest, reef pavement, bioclasts and moat. A rigid framework of the reef crest has been formed upon the unconsolidated bioclasts facies. The reef crest of Yoron Is-land started to grow upward from 3 m below the sea level to near the sea surface for the period from 5, 260 to 3, 230 yrs BP. The reef pavement behind the crest has extended toward the moat along with the reef crest formation. After 3, 230 yrs BP, the crest is also extending its width by forming spurs and grooves toward the ocean.

50|$|The South Pacific, meanwhile, {{was almost}} {{completely}} uninhabited.

Today these people are named the Lapita, after the location in New Caledonia where they were first noticed in archaeology.|$|R
30|$|The {{dominance}} of smaller (≤ 10  km 2 in area) islands in Fig.  3 {{can be explained}} in two ways. First, since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), when Pacific sea level was perhaps 120  m lower than today (Oba and Irino 2012), island coasts have been progressively drowned resulting in their fragmentation into smaller islands. This {{is suggested by the}} common situation where innumerable smaller islands are found close to the coast of larger ones, to which they were once joined. Instinctively this may be considered to have added to the number <b>of</b> <b>islands</b> in the Pacific since the LGM but, unless the number to have been completely submerged by subsequent sea-level rise is known, this cannot be demonstrated. The second reason is that once sea level stabilized in the Pacific, beginning around 6000  years ago (Grossman et al. 1998), broad reef platforms around the <b>fringes</b> <b>of</b> many <b>islands</b> began developing and came to provide substrates on which <b>islands</b> made <b>of</b> surficial materials might then form. Although strings <b>of</b> such <b>islands</b> (motu) are not counted separately in the database (see above), they nevertheless contribute a substantial number, typically to the population <b>of</b> <b>islands</b> ≤ 10  km 2 in area.|$|R

Respecting SANTA CRUZ, and the SOLOMON ARCHIPELAGO, I have no information; but at New Ireland, which forms the northern point of the latter chain, both Labillardiere and Lesson have described large beds of an apparently very modern madreporitic rock, with the form of the corals little altered. The latter author ("Voyage de la 'Coquille'," [...] Part. Zoolog.) states that this formation composes a newer line of coast, modelled round an ancient one. There only remains to be described in the Pacific, that curved line <b>of</b> <b>fringed</b> <b>islands,</b> <b>of</b> which the MARIANAS form the main part.

The team is to develop a basic design proposal for the camp itself. This should be capable of accommodating the uses and facilities which the preliminary study indicates are desirable. However, it is desirable that the organisation proposed should be sufficiently flexible to allow for changing recreation patterns which may emerge in the future. In formulating proposals for development the team is to consider the concept of a public amenity area, plus provision for cabins, caravans, camping sites and picnicking in a relaxed and informal atmosphere. The proposals are to indicate the siting and general designs of all buildings, servicing facilities, circulation systems, and plantings, allowing for a concept of staged development. The proposals presented here are based upon proposals developed by landscape students. These proposals were amended in the light of discussions held with the Punakaiki Scenic Board, and were developed to their present form by Miss J. H.

At the moment, there is only a public bus system on the ground, although it provides good coverage, is very inexpensive and is well liked by locals. The system uses small buses in order to negotiate the tortuous street system. The elevated LRT began construction in March, 2012, near the border crossing to Mainland China, although {{as can be seen in}} Figure  3, it is a peripheral line designed largely to serve the casinos. While Macao’s air quality has declined sharply as a result of a plethora of casino coaches transporting arriving gamblers free of charge to the casinos, the hope is that the elevated LRT will replace them. It is also hoped that this complex public transportation system at three levels will convert Macao from private transportation to a public system. In this sense, it follows the plan of Taipei, Taiwan, where a three-level system has also been built.|$|R
50|$|Current {{evidence}} indicates that the Papuans (who constitute the majority <b>of</b> the <b>island's</b> peoples) are descended from the earliest human inhabitants of New Guinea.

These peoples had made the (shortened) sea-crossing from the <b>islands</b> <b>of</b> Wallacea and Sundaland (the present Malay Archipelago) by at least 40,000 years ago, subsequent to the dispersal of peoples from Africa (circa) 50,000 - 70,000 years ago.The ancestral Austronesian peoples are believed to have arrived considerably later, approximately 3,500 years ago, as part of a gradual seafaring migration from Southeast Asia, possibly originating in Taiwan.

Hydrated halloysite occurs in all the soils studied, but it is most abundant in the more hydromorphic soils. Although the soils are derived from different alluvial materials, the trend of increasing montmorillonite and increasing hydrated halloysite with increasing hydromorphism is clearly related to the pedogenic processes operating in the soils.
