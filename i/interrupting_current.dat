40|$|Lithium {{primary and}} lithium ion {{secondary}} batteries provide high specific energy and energy density. The {{use of these}} batteries also helps to reduce launch weight. Both primary and secondary cells can be packaged as high-rate cells, which can present a threat to crew and equipment {{in the event of}} external or internal short circuits. Overheating of the cell interior from high current flows induced by short circuits can result in exothermic reactions in lithium primary cells and fully charged lithium ion secondary cells. Venting of the cell case, ejection of cell components, and fire have been reported in both types of cells, resulting from abuse, cell imperfections, or faulty electronic control design. A switch has been developed that consists of a thin layer of composite material made from nanoscale particles of nickel and Teflon that conducts electrons at room temperature and switches to an insulator at an elevated temperature, thus <b>interrupting</b> <b>current</b> flow to prevent thermal runaway caused by internal short circuits. The material is placed within the cell, as a thin layer incorporated within the anode and/or the cathode, to control excess currents from metal-to-metal or metal-to-carbon shorts that might result from cell crush or a manufacturing defect. The safety of high-rate cells is thus improved, preventing serious injury to personnel and sensitive equipment located near the battery. The use of recently available nanoscale particles of nickel and Teflon permits an improved, homogeneous material with the potential to be fine-tuned to a unique switch temperature, sufficiently below the onset of a catastrophic chemical reaction. The smaller particles also permit the formation of a thinner control film layer (< 50 m), which can be incorporated into commercial high-rate lithium primary and secondary cells. The innovation permits incorporation in current lithium and lithium-ion cell designs with a minimal impact on cell weight and volume. The composite thermal switch (CTS(TradeMark)) coating can be incorporated in either the anode or cathode or both. The coating can be applied in a variety of different processes that permits incorporation in the cell and electrode manufacturing processes. The CTS responds quickly and halts current flow in the hottest parts of the cell first.

40|$|The {{demand on}} {{reducing}} circuit breaker failure, extending service life, increasing equipment reliability and lowering the related operating and maintenance costs are nowadays of prime {{importance for the}} electricity supply network. According to statistics, the major failure mode is originated from operating mechanism, whereas interrupter has {{the highest percentage of}} failure in high voltage component. Thus, the method to facilitate the assessment of internal mechanical conditions by using commercially available devices without opening major parts and the experimental investigation on electrical erosion inside the interrupter were performed in this work. The experimental investigation on the mechanical endurance of operating mechanism up to 6, 000 no-load switching was performed with 110 kV puffer type circuit breakers due to its requirement of large driving energy for hydraulic operating mechanism. The conventional measurement, e. g. coil current, contact timing, dynamic contact resistance and pumping motor current as well as additional vibration technique were carried out in both laboratory and field test. The investigation on electrical erosion focusing on aging of nozzle and electrode under current interruption was performed with a reduced-size SF 6 self-blast circuit breaker model and synthetic test circuit, providing the current density comparable to that in the real circuit breaker, because of the extensive use of nozzle ablation, the possibility for parameters variation and the reduction of cost and time. For mechanical investigation, the parameters were measured at the beginning as a reference and also thereafter every 500 switching under normal and variable operating conditions, e. g. variation of auxiliary supply voltage, hydraulic oil pressure and SF 6 gas pressure. The test result was verified by that from two of the same type circuit breakers and the theoretical calculation for vibration result in the frequency-domain analysis. Subsequently, the on-site measurement before and after maintenance and some simulated defects were executed. The electrical aging investigation was performed by successive tests with constant energy stresses until interrupting failure occurred. The effect of current amplitude, nozzle diameter, expansion volume, arcing time and recovery voltage on mass losses, geometry changes of nozzle and its influence on pressure build-up were investigated. The analysis of vibration signals in a combination with the other supervised parameters provides the useful information regarding the significant events occurring inside during circuit breaker operation, e. g. motion start of mechanism and within pole, contact touching and motion stop. The deviations of these measured values from the reference according to number of no-load switching operations, variable operating conditions and some incorporated defects were comprehensively determined. The relationship between the gradual changes in technical status of the supervised components and the number of no-load operations is helpful for selecting the proper maintenance method. Regarding the electrical erosion of the nozzle and the electrodes, the mass losses per switching and per energy; and the geometry change of nozzle especially between the arcing column and the expansion chamber were investigated. Moreover, volume loss and mass loss along the nozzle column; its effect on the pressure build-up reduction; and the dependences of mass losses on <b>interrupting</b> <b>current</b> amplitude, charge and generated heat have been determined. Furthermore by applying the wear equivalent law, the allowable number of interruption in function of the breaking current to rated short-circuit current ratio and the remaining lifetime can be determined. This result will be used to verify the accuracy of simulation tools in order to visualize the aging process, to evaluate the interrupter condition and to minimize the expensive experiment tests...|$|E

The experimental observations include voltage and current characteristics of the DS, and synchronous optical recording of the arc with a high-speed camera. Electrical and optical data are studied for fail and successful interruptions. The results show: 1) The short arcing time by the fast opening contacts limits the energy input into the arc, enhancing the probability of arc extinction; 2) the contribution to the arc energy mainly comes from the oscillations upon restrike. The energy input to the arc increases with higher breakdown voltage, larger air gap, and higher interrupted current; 3) the arc brightness is synchronous with arc <b>current.</b> With higher <b>interrupted</b> <b>current,</b> the overall arc is brighter and its remnants decay slower.

40|$|Investigation {{into the}} dynamic {{characteristics}} and decaying behaviour of SF 6 arcs during the current-zero period {{is of great}} significance to improving the interruption performance of high voltage circuit breakers and ensuring their reliable operation. The present research was conducted by means of modeling and experiment to provide a better knowledge of the switching process to help the design and optimization of high voltage SF 6 circuit breakers. The {{first part of the}} work concerns the determination of thermophysical properties of SF 6 plasmas under local thermodynamic equilibrium state (LTE). A systematic comparison with transport coefficients obtained using an old data set and experimental test has been performed to check the reliability of the proposed phenomenological approach in evaluating transport cross sections. Properties especially transport coefficients become sensitive to the choice of Debye length definition predominantly due to the different collision integrals affected by the different screening distance. Pressures increase can also influence thermophysical properties due to the inhibited chemical reactions. Moreover, the thermophysical properties under non-equilibrium conditions have been investigated using a two-temperature model. It was noted that the special case with equal electrons and heavy species temperatures produces results agreeing excellently with those obtained by the LTE model. The forms of mass action laws as well as the choice of reaction excitation temperature for molecular ionization used in the calculation can significantly modify the species composition and plasma properties. This model lays the micro-theoretical foundation for a deeper understanding of SF 6 plasma formation and evolution mechanism and provides a reliable properties input for non-equilibrium arc behaviour simulation. Following a traditional approach of arc modelling assuming LTE, considerable effort has been devoted to study the arc-shock interaction and its influence on the dynamic characteristics and current zero behaviour of SF 6 arcs in a supersonic nozzle with a hollow contact. It was found that the close coupling between the shock region and its surrounding gas flow greatly influences the aerodynamic and electrical behaviour of a nozzle arc and hence the thermal recovery process. In addition, deceleration of gas flow caused by the shocks and enhanced turbulent cooling brought by the sucked gas interacting with the arc both {{play a significant role in}} the determination of the thermal interruption capability. Possible departure from LTE in a decaying SF 6 arc was studied using a two-temperature hydrodynamic model in a supersonic nozzle under well-controlled conditions. The predicted radial temperature variation presents quite good agreement with test result using emission spectroscopy. It is demonstrated that the electron and heavy-particle temperature diverge in cases where the collision energy exchange is ineffective. For the arc decay phase, the two-temperature model gives a lower cooling rate than the LTE model, and hence a higher conductance of the discharge passage at current zero showing the necessity of using a two-temperature model to accurately predict the current interruption capability of SF 6 gas-blast circuit breakers. For thermal recovery phase, considering the chemically non-equilibrium effect, a global kinetic model of decaying SF 6 arcs was established to study the electrons elimination mechanisms around current zero. For dielectric recovery phase, the critical dielectric strength of hot SF 6 are investigated based on a two-term Boltzmann equation solution of electrons energy distribution function. It is noted that the main mechanisms of electrons elimination are the dissociative attachment from 3500 K to 7500 K, electron-molecular ion recombination in the temperature lower than 3500 K. The temperature increase, pressure decrease and departure from chemically non-equilibrium can all contribute to the dielectric strength reduction. The entrainment of PTFE ablation vapour can enhance the dielectric strengh of SF 6 above 2500 K. Finally, this research manufactures a model SF 6 gas blast interrupter and investigates the dynamic characteristics of electrical, light radiation, pressure along together with electrode movement. Arc dynamic characteristics and decaying behaviour of CO 2 and N 2 is compared with that of SF 6 arcs in order to obtain the dominant properties influencing arc quenching. It is noted that the extinction voltage, which decreases with increase in the <b>interrupting</b> <b>current,</b> is related to the conductance decay during current zero period and can be considered as an evaluation of interruption capability. Gas blast can bring a much more rapid variation of arc resistance and a much higher cut-off current before its extinction. SF 6 has a superior interruption capability possibly due to its high thermal conductivity and specific heat...|$|E
40|$|Auto-expansion circuit {{breakers}} utilize the arcâs energy {{to generate the}} flow conditions required for current interruption. The operation {{of this type of}} circuit breaker is extremely complex and its interruption capability depends on the whole arcing history {{as well as a number}} of geometric factors. On the other hand, circuit breaker development based on test is extremely expensive and time consuming. The accumulated understanding of the underlying physical processes so far enables arc models be used as a tool for optimum design of switchgear product such as high voltage {{circuit breakers}}. For academic research, there is often a need to study the performance of a newly developed arc model by inspecting the distribution of relevant physical quantities during a simulation and their sensitivity to model parameters in an efficient and convenient approach. However the effective use of computer simulation by design engineers has been hindered by the complexity encountered in model implementation. This thesis presents the development and structure of an automated simulation tool, the Integrated Simulation and Evaluation Environment (ISEE), for the arcing process in gas-blast circuit breakers. The functionalities of ISEE are identified and developed based on the experience in real product design, which include visual creation and definition of components, automatic setup of arc models based on a commercial CFD software package as equation solver, simulation task management, and visualization of computational results in âreal-timeâ mode. This is the first automated simulation platform in the community of switching arc simulation. Using ISEE as the simulation tool, different designs of auto-expansion circuit breakers have been investigated to reveal the fundamental characteristics of the arcing process under different test duties. Before attempting to investigate the capability of an auto-expansion circuit breaker, the fundamental issue of determining the turbulence parameter of the Prandtl mixing length model is addressed. Previous studies on turbulence arcs were mostly concerned with simple converging-diverging nozzles. There has been little work on real circuit breaker nozzles. In order to calibrate the turbulence parameter, real arcing conditions including interrupting currents, contact travels, and transient recovery voltages of two commercial circuit breakers, with rated voltage of 145 kV and 245 kV, have been used together with the geometry of the circuit breakers to calibrate the range of the turbulence parameter. The effect of nozzle ablation has been considered. All together 6 cases have been used for three circuit breakers with each pair of cases corresponding to a success and failure in its thermal recovery process. It has been found that a single parameter of 0. 35 is applicable to all three circuit breakers with an auxiliary nozzle and a main nozzle of converge-flat throat-diverge shape. It must be noted that this value is obtained with the definition of thermal radius introduced in Chapter 3 and the assumption that the parameter linearly changes with the <b>interrupting</b> <b>current</b> from 0. 05 at 15 kA to 0. 35 at current zero. Using the calibrated turbulence model, a computational study of the thermal interruption performance of a 145 kV, 60 Hz auto-expansion circuit breaker with different arc durations has been carried out in Chapter 4. The relation between pressure peak and current peak in the auto-expansion circuit breaker is discussed. It has been found that a larger average mass flux in the main nozzle indicates a better interruption environment, enabling the circuit breaker to withstand a larger rate of rise of recovery voltage after current zero. Another important finding is that the auxiliary nozzle plays an important role in an auto-expansion circuit breaker both at the high current phase and during the current zero period. Therefore, the proper design and use of an auxiliary nozzle is a key factor to enhance the thermal interruption capability of high voltage auto-expansion circuit breakers. In Chapter 5 of the thesis, the transient pressure variation in auto-expansion circuit breakers was studied. The pressure variation has an extremely complex pattern and the pressure changes in different ways depending on the location in the arcing chamber. It is shown, for the first time, that the time lag between the current peak and pressure peak in the expansion volume can be explained by using an energy flow rate balance method, that is flow reversal occurs when the enthalpy exhaustion rate from the contact space equals the electrical power input. Following the flow reversal, a high enthalpy flow rate from the expansion volume into the contact gap first occurs for a short while (1 ms), which is followed by a high mass flow rate of relatively cool gas at less than 2000 K. This high mass flow rate causes a surplus in mass flow rate into the contact gap and results in the last temporary pressure peak in the contact space before the pressure and flow field finally settle down for arc quenching at current zero. The pressure change under different conditions, i. e. different arc durations, different current levels and different length of the heating channel, has also been studied in details. In summary the present research leads to original findings in three aspects of the operation of auto-expansion circuit breakers, i. e. the calibration of the turbulence parameter for the Prandtl mixing length model, interruption performance with different arc durations, and the transient pressure variation in the arcing process. The results are expected to provide useful information for the optimum design of auto-expansion circuit breakers...|$|E
