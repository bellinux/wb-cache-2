40|$|Objective: To develop maternal, fetal, and {{neonatal}} composite outcomes {{relevant to}} the evaluation of diet and lifestyle interventions in pregnancy by individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis. Design: Delphi survey. Setting: The International Weight Management in Pregnancy (i–WIP) collaborative network. Sample Twenty-six researchers from the i–WIP collaborative network from 11 countries. Methods: A two-generational Delphi survey involving members of the i–WIP collaborative network (26 members in 11 countries) was undertaken to prioritise the individual outcomes for their importance in clinical care. The final components of the composite outcomes were identified using pre-specified criteria Main outcome measures: Composite outcomes considered to be important {{for the evaluation of}} the effect of diet and lifestyle in pregnancy. Results: Of the 36 maternal outcomes, nine were prioritised and the following were included in the final composite: pre-eclampsia or pregnancy-induced hypertension, gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), elective or emergency caesarean section, and preterm delivery. Of the 27 fetal and neonatal outcomes, nine were further evaluated, with the final composite consisting of intrauterine death, small for gestational age, large for gestational age, and admission to a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Conclusions: Our work has identified the components of maternal, fetal, and neonatal composite outcomes required for the assessment of diet and lifestyle interventions in pregnancy by IPD meta-analysis.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{the relationship between}} age and race on the receipt of definitive therapy among men with high-risk prostate cancer (CaP). METHODS: We used the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results Program to identify 62, 644 men with high-risk CaP (PSA > 20 or Gleason 8 - 10 or stage ≥cT 3 a) diagnosed from 2004 to 2010. Multivariable logistic regression analysis modeled the interaction between age and race and its association with receipt of definitive therapy on 57, 674 patients (47, 879 white men; 9, 795 African American [AA] men) with complete data on the covariates of interest. RESULTS: Among men age ≥ 70, AA men had {{a higher risk of}} CaP-specific mortality (PCSM) compared to white men after adjusting for sociodemographic and prostate cancer-specific factors (Adjusted HR 1. 20; 95 % CI 1. 02 - 1. 38; P= 0. 02). Nevertheless, a significant interaction between race and age was found (Pinteraction= 0. 01), such that the adjusted odds of receiving definitive treatment for AA vs. white was 0. 67 (95 % CI 0. 62 - 0. 73; P< 0. 001) among men age < 70, but was 0. 60 (95 % CI 0. 55 - 0. 66; P< 0. 001) among men age ≥ 70, suggesting increased racial disparity in the receipt of definitive treatment among older men. CONCLUSION: AA men with high-risk CaP are less likely to receive definitive therapy than white men. This disparity is significantly larger among men age ≥ 70, despite excess PCSM among AA men in this group. With a rapidly expanding population of older minority men, this disparity should be urgently addressed to prevent increasing disparities in cancer care. Brandon A. Mahal, David R. Ziehr, Ayal A.

40|$|Background: Active {{surveillance}} is {{an increasingly}} accepted approach for managing patients with germ-cell tumors (GCTs) after an orchiectomy. Here we investigate a time-to-relapse stratification scheme for clinical stage 1 (CS 1) nonseminoma GCT (NSGCT) patients according to {{factors associated with}} relapse and identify a group of patients with a lower frequency and longer time-to-relapse who may require an alternative surveillance strategy. Patients and methods: We analyzed 266 CS 1 GCT patients from the IRB-approved DFCI GCT database that exclusively underwent surveillance following orchiectomy from 1997 to 2013. We stratified NSGCT patients according to predominance of embryonal carcinoma (EmbP) and lymphovascular invasion (LVI), using a 0, 1, and 2 scoring system. Cox regression and conditional risk analysis were used to compare each NSGCT group to patients in the seminomatous germ-cell tumor (SGCT) category. Median time-to-relapse values were then calculated among those patients who underwent relapse. Relapse-free survival curves were generated using the Kaplan–Meier method. Results: Fifty (37 %) NSGCT and 20 (15 %) SGCT patients relapsed. The median time-to-relapse was 11. 5 versus 6. 3 months for the SGCT and NSGCT groups, respectively. For NSGCT patients, relapse rates were higher and median timeto- relapse faster with increasing number of risk factors (RFs). Relapse rates (%) and median time-to-relapse (months) were 25 %/ 8. 5 months, 41 %/ 6. 8 months and 78 %/ 3. 8 months for RF 0, RF 1 and RF 2, respectively. We found {{a statistically significant difference}} between SGCT and patients with one or two RFs (P < 0. 001) but not between SGCT and NSGCT RF 0 (P = 0. 108). Conclusion: NSGCT patients grouped by a risk score system based on EmbP and LVI yielded three groups with distinct relapse patterns -and patients with neither EmbP nor LVI appear to behave similar to SGCT.
