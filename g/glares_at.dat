5|$|The {{portrait}} {{depicts the}} tensions and manoeuvrings of 16th century court politics. The deep red background and heavy brushstrokes establish an anxious and tense atmosphere, and the uneasy {{relationship between the}} Pope and his suitors. The pope is old, ill and tired and, to some critics' eyes, <b>glares</b> <b>at</b> Ottavio in an accusatory manner. His hat or camauro cloaks his baldness, but there are tell-tale signs of age in his long nose, dark beady eyes, stooped shoulders and long uneven beard. He is noticeably older than in the second Naples portrait of 1543. This fact {{is reinforced by the}} clock placed on the table beside him, which serves both as a memento mori and a reminder that time is running out. Given this, the presence of his grandsons indicates that the commission was prompted by thoughts of succession.|$|E
25|$|Raven Lugosi]]: While {{everyone}} {{fears the}} changelings, the changelings fear Raven. She is a Quebecois French Canadian, and doesn't say much, but rather <b>glares</b> <b>at</b> all the others.|$|E
25|$|The scene opens as Umeōmaru and Sakuramaru {{try to stop}} Shihei's carriage, and {{are confronted}} by Matsuōmaru, {{a member of the}} entourage. As the pair begin to unlash the oxen and tear apart the carriage, Shihei emerges, his blue face makeup marking him as a villain. He <b>glares</b> <b>at</b> them malevolently, halting their attack.|$|E

60|$|The {{two sisters}} <b>glared</b> <b>at</b> {{each other over}} the {{helpless}} man between them. Then another woman entered who looked sympathetically at Gabriel and then <b>glared</b> <b>at</b> them both. It was Mrs Markle. At which, happily for Gabriel, the family bickering ceased.|$|R
60|$|As Burley {{must have}} <b>glared</b> <b>at</b> Bothwell when they rushed {{together}} in the dread encounter on the mountain side; as Achilles may have <b>glared</b> <b>at</b> Hector when at last they met, each resolved to test in fatal conflict the prowess of the other, so did Dr Fillgrave <b>glare</b> <b>at</b> his foe from Greshamsbury, when, on turning round on his exalted heel, he found his nose on a level with the top button of Dr Thorne's waistcoat.|$|R
25|$|The next morning, Terrel manipulates Kevin into {{participating}} in a hazing ritual. Kevin reluctantly punches Chiron until {{he is unable to}} stand before watching as Terrel and several other students stomp on him. When a social worker urges him to reveal his attackers' identities, Chiron refuses, stating that reporting them will not solve anything. The following day, Chiron smashes a chair over Terrel's back and is subsequently arrested. As the police escort Chiron out of school, he <b>glares</b> <b>at</b> Kevin.|$|E
500|$|After the war, Lilly {{remained}} in the South to begin a new business venture. Lilly and his business partner leased a [...] cotton plantation in Mississippi. Lilly traveled to Greencastle, Indiana, and returned with his wife, Emily, his sister, Anna Wesley Lilly, and son, Josiah. Shortly after the move the entire family was stricken with a mosquito-borne disease, probably malaria, that was common in the region at that time. Although the others recovered, Emily died on August 20, 1866, eight months pregnant with a second son, who was stillborn. The death devastated Lilly; {{he wrote to his}} family, [...] "I can hardly tell you how it <b>glares</b> <b>at</b> me...it's a bitter, bitter truth... Emily is indeed dead." [...] Lilly abandoned the farm and returned to Indiana. The plantation fell into disrepair and a drought caused its cotton crop to fail. Lilly's business partner, unable to maintain the plantation because of the drought, disappeared with the venture's remaining cash. Lilly was forced to file for bankruptcy in 1868.|$|E
500|$|The demon who is feeding Homer donuts says: [...] "I don't {{understand}} it. James Coco went mad {{in fifteen}} minutes!", referencing {{an actor who}} received attention for his culinary talents and best-selling cookbooks. The jury at Homer's trial consists of John Wilkes Booth, Lizzie Borden, John Dillinger, Blackbeard, Benedict Arnold, the starting lineup of the 1976 Philadelphia Flyers, and Richard Nixon. The first time the Devil appears, he resembles the demon Chernabog from the Walt Disney film Fantasia, especially after Homer discovers a technicality and starts taunting the Devil that he's [...] "smarter than the devil", until the Devil turns into the Chernabog-esque demon and <b>glares</b> <b>at</b> him before disappearing. The scene in Hell where Homer is fed all the doughnuts in the world, and asks for more, is a direct parody of the cartoon Pigs is Pigs, in which a generic pig character (a Porky Pig-esque character) known for being a glutton is taken in by a scientist and forced to eat all the food in the world. At Mr. Burns' castle, Lisa notices a tome resting on a stand in the basement. She runs over and reads the title: [...] "Yes, I Am a Vampire, by Monty Burns. Foreword by Steve Allen," [...] a reference to American actor Steve Allen. Shortly after she finds the tome, she makes allusions to Shemp and Curly Howard of the Three Stooges, mistaking Bart's fearful attempts at getting her attention as impressions of the two. In [...] "Bart Simpson's Dracula", Bart is seen floating outside Lisa's bedroom window. This is a parody of The Lost Boys as well as Stephen King's novel Salem's Lot. The family's plan to kill the head vampire is also a reference to both the film and novel. In particular, the twist revelation that Burns is not the head vampire is also {{a reference to the}} twist ending of The Lost Boys. The closing credits of the episode features a version of the Simpsons theme that is a combination of the instruments used in The Munsters theme song and the harpsichord and clicking from The Addams Family theme song.|$|E

2500|$|According to the {{historian}} Chen Shou, who wrote Cui Yan's biography in the Records of the Three Kingdoms (Sanguozhi), Cui's true intention in writing those remarks was to mock Yang Xun's critics {{for being too}} eager to disparage Yang without making any careful consideration. However, Cui Yan was accused of displaying arrogance and defaming Cao Cao in his letter. Cao Cao angrily said, [...] "There is a saying, 'I {{gave birth to a}} daughter, that is all.' 'That is all' is not a complimentary phrase. He meant disrespect when he wrote, 'There will be changes as time passes.'" [...] Cao Cao then had Cui Yan stripped off his post, thrown into prison, and ordered to perform hard labour. Later, he sent agents to observe Cui Yan in prison and they reported that Cui continued to remain defiant. Cao Cao issued an official statement, [...] "Even though Cui Yan is serving a sentence, he still receives high numbers of visitors in prison. He <b>glares</b> <b>at</b> them straight in the eye as if he has grievances." [...] He then forced Cui Yan to commit suicide.|$|E
2500|$|The Weilüe {{recorded}} {{more details}} of the events leading to Cui Yan's death. It mentioned that Cui Yan's letter to Yang Xun fell {{into the hands of}} Cui Yan's enemies, who accused him of defaming Cao Cao. Cao Cao felt that Cui Yan was discrediting him so he had the latter arrested, imprisoned, head shaved, and sent to perform hard labour. Later, Cui Yan's enemies told Cao Cao, [...] "When Cui Yan serves his sentence, he <b>glares</b> <b>at</b> people straight in the eye as if he is filled with resentment." [...] Cao Cao believed them and wanted Cui Yan to die so he sent an official to inform Cui, [...] "You've three days to live." [...] Cui Yan did not understand what the official meant and he continued to live on for several days. When the official reported to Cao Cao that Cui Yan was alive and well, Cao furiously said, [...] "Cui Yan is forcing me to use the sword on him!" [...] The official went to see Cui Yan again and explained to the latter that Cao Cao actually wanted him to kill himself within three days. Cui Yan said, [...] "How silly of me. I didn't know that he actually wanted me to do this." [...] He committed suicide after that.|$|E
