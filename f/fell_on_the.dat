5|$|During World War I, Ashford's {{importance}} as a transport hub and its location between {{the continent and}} London made it a target for aerial bombing. A bomb <b>fell</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> railway works on 25 March 1917, killing 61 people, while the town was a target in the Battle of Britain during World War II, including an attack on 15 September 1940.|$|E
5|$|In early 1811, Shelley and Hogg {{published}} The Necessity of Atheism, which outraged the Oxford authorities.

The interior walls of the bedrooms and hallways are of pecky cypress.|$|R
5|$|Soon {{after the}} {{building}} reopened, a bomb <b>fell</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> nearby Law Courts, {{and the staff}} sent pupils home for a week.

5|$|The Armero {{catastrophe}} came {{shortly after}} the M-19 guerrilla group's raid and subsequent Palace of Justice siege on November 6, worsening an already chaotic situation.

5|$|A Super Over eventuated, and Laura Marsh bowled for England. Healy {{came in at}} 1/3 after Leah Poulton <b>fell</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fourth ball.

England also ended with 2/6 after a run out {{in an attempt to}} secure the winning run on the final ball. Australia was awarded the match because they had hit more sixes in the matchJess Cameron scored the solitary six.|$|E
5|$|According to the Court of Appeal, {{the burden}} of proof of {{justifying}} the lawfulness of the appellants' detention was, in the first instance, on the detaining authority. This burden of proof could be discharged by evidence that the President, acting in accordance with advice of the Cabinet or an authorized minister, was satisfied that the detention was necessary for national security purposes, and by the production of the detention order. Once the detaining authority had discharged the initial burden of proof, a burden of proof <b>fell</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> appellants to challenge their detention on GCHQ grounds.|$|E
5|$|Although {{only one}} bomb <b>fell</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Tower of London in the First World War (it landed harmlessly in the moat), the Second World War left a greater mark. On 23 September 1940, during the Blitz, high-explosive bombs damaged the castle, {{destroying}} several buildings and narrowly missing the White Tower. After the war, {{the damage was}} repaired and the Tower of London was reopened to the public.|$|E

5|$|By mid-March, Marine {{intelligence}} {{began to}} note an exodus of NVA units from the Khe Sanh sector. The 325C Divisional Headquarters {{was the first}} to leave, followed by the 95C and 101D Regiments, all of which relocated to the west. At the same time, the 304th Division withdrew to the southwest. That did not mean, however that battle was over. On 22 March over 1,000 North Vietnamese rounds <b>fell</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> base, and, once again, the ammunition dump was detonated.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War Uxbridge {{adopted the}} Royal Navy {{destroyer}} HMS Intrepid in 1942, to help towards the ship's costs; Intrepid {{was lost to}} enemy action the following year. The town and surrounding areas suffered bombing by the Luftwaffe. V1 flying bombs <b>fell</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> town between June 1944 and March 1945. The first recorded bombing using a V1 was on 22 June 1944 at 07:00, when the bomb passed {{over the top of}} a bus and hit four houses nearby. Seven people were killed and 25 injured, leaving 46 houses in the area uninhabitable.|$|E
5|$|During {{the night}} of 16–17 April 1941, {{in one of the}} last major air raids on London, bombs {{repeatedly}} <b>fell</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Waterloo area, and the LNC's good fortune in avoiding damage to their facilities finally ran out. In {{the early stages of the}} air raid the rolling stock stored in the Necropolis siding was burned, and the railway arch connecting the main line to the Necropolis terminus was damaged, although the terminal building itself remained unscathed.|$|E

5|$|Following birth it was common, {{particularly}} among richer families, {{to employ a}} wet-nurse {{to care for the}} child, sometimes living in with the family. Few sources give an insight into the experiences of young children in this period. Some parents played with their children and parents demonstrated grief at their loss. The primary responsibility for bringing up young children <b>fell</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> mother. For older children, the major duty of parents was, according to the Kirk, to ensure the spiritual development of the child, with fathers leading daily family prayers, {{but it is not clear}} how widely these practices were adopted.|$|E
5|$|In 1724 {{the feast}} of the Visitation <b>fell</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fourth Sunday after Trinity, thus the next cantata Bach {{composed}} was a chorale cantata for the fifth Sunday after Trinity. Bach did apparently not compose a cantata for the sixt Sunday after Trinity in 1724 while absent from Leipzig. Bach's second year in Leipzig passed without composing a chorale cantata specifically for the fourth Sunday after Trinity. He composed one for this occasion in 1732, Ich ruf zu dir, Herr Jesu Christ, BWV177, one of the later additions to the chorale cantata cycle. Also for TrinityVI Bach composed a chorale cantata at a later date (BWV9).|$|E
5|$|In 1854, {{the town}} gained borough status and had its first mayor. In the early 20th century Yeovil had around 11,000 {{inhabitants}} and {{was dominated by}} the defence industry, making it a target of German raids during World War II. The worst of the bombing was in 1940 and continued until 1942. During that time 107 high explosive bombs <b>fell</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> town. 49 people died, 68 houses were totally destroyed and 2,377 damaged.|$|E
