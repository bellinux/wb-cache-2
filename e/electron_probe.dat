2500|$|Archaeologists have {{discovered}} {{two forms of}} jade {{that can be found}} across Taiwan through the Philippines, East Malaysia, central and southern Vietnam, and even extending to eastern Cambodia and peninsular Thailand. [...] These two forms are called linling-o penannular earring with three pointed circumferential projections and the double animal-headed ear pendant. [...] The forms are very similar in size and range from about 30–35mm in diameter. [...] Furthermore, radiocarbon dates have dated these forms in Southeast Asia from around 500 BC to 500 AD. The <b>electron</b> <b>probe</b> microanalysis shows that the raw material of these two types of artifacts was nephrite jade from Taiwan called Fengtian nephrite. Evidence recovered from multiple sites from Taiwan, the Philippines, and the mainland southeast Asia suggests that Taiwan was the main source of the exchange of this kind jade. During the Iron Age of Southeast Asia, there may have been skilled craftsmen traveling from Taiwan to southeast Asia along the coastline of the South China Sea, making jade ornaments for local inhabitants.|$|E

40|$|The {{descent of}} a narrow {{sporadic}} E layer near 95 km altitude over Poker Flat Research Range in Alaska was observed with <b>electron</b> <b>probes</b> on two consecutive sounding rockets and with incoherent scatter radar during a 2 h period near magnetic midnight. A series of four trimethyl aluminum chemical releases demonstrated that the Es layer remained just slightly above the zonal wind node, which was slowly descending due to propagating long-period gravity waves. The location of the layer {{is consistent with the}} equilibrium position due to combined action of the wind shear and electric fields. Although the horizontal electric field could not be measured directly, we estimate that it was ~ 2 mV m − 1 southward, consistent with modeling the vertical ion drift, and compatible with extremely quiet conditions. Both <b>electron</b> <b>probes</b> observed deep biteout regions just below the Es enhancements, which also descended with the sporadic layers. We discuss several possibilities for the cause of these depletions; one possibility is the presence of negatively charged, nanometer-sized mesospheric smoke particles. Such particles have recently been detected in the upper mesosphere, but not yet in immediate connection with sporadic E. Our observations of electron depletions suggest a new process associated with sporadic E...|$|R

The PADs reveal that theoretical estimates of the inelastic mean free path are likely too long at low kinetic energies, and hence the <b>electron</b> <b>probing</b> depth in water, near threshold ionization, appears to be considerably smaller than so far assumed...|$|R

Using <b>electron</b> <b>probe</b> analyses the average proportions for metal in the sulfide structure were determined to be 64 percent Pt, 27 percent Pd, and 14 percent Ni.

While in the atomic resolution regime the magnetic signal is most likely under the detection limits of present transmission electron microscopes, for <b>electron</b> <b>probes</b> with high orbital angular momenta, and correspondingly larger spatial extent, its detection is predicted to be feasible.

50|$|An {{electron}} microprobe (EMP), {{also known}} as an <b>electron</b> <b>probe</b> microanalyzer (EPMA) or electron micro probe analyzer (EMPA), is an analytical tool used to non-destructively determine the chemical composition of small volumes of solid materials. It works similarly to a scanning electron microscope: the sample is bombarded with an electron beam, emitting x-rays at wavelengths characteristic to the elements being analyzed. This enables the abundances of elements present within small sample volumes (typically 10-30 cubic micrometers or less) to be determined. The concentrations of elements from beryllium to plutonium can be measured at levels as low as 100 parts per million (ppm). Recent models of EPMAs can accurately measure elemental concentrations of approximately 10 ppm.|$|E
50|$|Switzer was a {{major force}} behind the museum's {{research}} division. He applied for and received a grant from NASA, which allowed the Smithsonian to obtain an <b>electron</b> <b>probe</b> micro-analyzer for minerals during the 1970s.

From 1972 until 1973, Switzer and other mineralogists used the micro-analyzer to examine samples of rock from the Moon which were brought back by the crews of the Apollo 15 and Apollo 16 missions. The U.S. military had hoped to find diamonds, plutonium and uranium in the samples. Instead, Switzer's analysis showed that the Moon had never had either an atmosphere similar to Earth's or water on its surface.

50|$|The methods {{by which}} petrologists examine igneous rocks and {{synthetically}} produced materials are optical petrography, X-ray diffraction (XRD), <b>electron</b> <b>probe</b> microanalysis (EPMA), laser ablation inductively coupled mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS), and many others. Methods such as optical petrography aid the researcher in understanding various textures of igneous rocks and, also, the mineralogical {{composition of the}} rock. XRD methods define the mineralogical constituents of the rock being tested; therefore, composition is only known based on the mineralogical composition discovered using this method. EPMA reveals textural features of the rock on the micron level. It also reveals a composition of the rock based on elemental abundance. For information about fluids trapped in an igneous rock, LA-ICP-MS could be used. This is accomplished by finding rocks with small pockets of fluid or vapor, acquiring the fluid or vapor, and testing the fluid or vapor for various elements and isotopes.|$|E
