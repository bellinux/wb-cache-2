5000|$|Important process {{variables}} in <b>gravure</b> <b>coating</b> & printing are the rotational position {{at which the}} blade wipes the cylinder; the angle that the blade makes with the tangent to the cylinder at the contact point; and the pressure applied to the blade. [...] Fine adjustment of in-and-out position, independently on left and right, must also be possible, in order to compensate for any misalignment between blade geometry and cylinder axis. These requirements are fulfilled by a doctor blade assembly which includes a doctor blade holder.|$|E
40|$|Gravure {{roll coating}} is a {{technique}} used to coat fluids {{of a wide range}} of viscosities (up to 1500 mPa s) onto substrates at speeds of up to 900 m/min (Booth, 1970, 1990). Coat thicknesses in the range of less than 1 micron up to 50 microns can be achieved, making this a versatile process which is finding application across a growing number of market sectors. Gravure roll coating differs from many of the conventional roll coating techniques in that one of the rolls is patterned with a surface engraving (the ‘gravure’ or ‘anilox’ pattern). Both the shape and the size of the gravure pattern can be varied which affects the final properties of the coating. The term ‘gravure roll coating’ covers a number of distinct <b>gravure</b> <b>coating</b> arrangements. Two common variants of these are direct <b>gravure</b> <b>coating</b> and offset <b>gravure</b> <b>coating,</b> see Figure 1. Direct <b>gravure</b> <b>coating</b> is where the fluid transfer takes place directly from the gravure roll to the web, whilst in offset <b>gravure</b> <b>coating,</b> fluid is transferred first from the gravure roll to a smooth deformable roll (often termed the applicator roll), and then from the deformable roll to the web. Whilst both are described as <b>gravure</b> <b>coating</b> processes, the fluid mechanics of these two processes are very different and will be described separately. Gravure ‘coating’ is distinct from gravure ‘printing’ (or roto-gravure), in that <b>gravure</b> <b>coating</b> is designed to give uniform coverage on the substrate whilst gravure printing is designed to print specifi c patterns. The quality of <b>gravure</b> <b>coating</b> can be defi ned in terms of the thickness and variation of the coating, whilst the quality of gravure printing will include quantifi cation of print characteristics such as resolution and edge definition. This article will focus on <b>gravure</b> <b>coating,</b> but many of the emerging markets, for example in the manufacture of electronic products such as solar cells, require both large areas of uniform coating but with good edge definition. This article will first describe the range of gravure cells available and typical manufacturing techniques, together with the important parameters that specify the gravure roller, before describing in more detail the two distinct gravure roll coating processes...|$|E

The cell volume, generalized cell shape, and the gravure patterning are considered in the model which is based on a multiscale description of the flow in the coating bead. The inclusion of a web-to-roll contact term accounts for the special gravure case when the web-roll separation tends to zero. The results show how the coating bead responds to changes in operating conditions. These are presented as profile plots of the fluid properties and coating bead shape...|$|R

40|$|YesThis {{experimental}} study of forward <b>gravure</b> <b>coating</b> considers the effects of operating variables on air entrainment, ribbing instabilities and {{the thickness of the}} film formed. The data show that this coating method can yield very thin films of thickness of order of 15 - 20 % at most of the equivalent cell depth of a gravure roller. Air free and non ribbed stable uniform films can however only be obtained in a narrow window of operating conditions at very low substrate capillary number (CaS ~ 0. 02) equivalent to substrate speeds typically less than 20 m/min. The paper draws a similarity with flow features observed with smooth forward roll coating and slide coating. It is shown that the onset of ribbing and the flux distribution between the gravure roller and the substrate at the exit of the nip obey approximately the same rules as in smooth forward roll coating, whereas the onset of air entrainment actually corresponds to a low-flow limit of coatability similar to that observed in slide coating...|$|E
40|$|A {{two-dimensional}} {{model for}} predicting the fluid pickout and coated film thickness {{characteristics of a}} discrete cell direct gravure roll coater operating in reverse mode is derived. A novel multiscale approach is adopted for this purpose and the resulting equations solved numerically for inertia-less flow conditions. A system of stiff ordinary differential equations {{is found to be}} sufficient to capture the major gross flow features, while at the cell level the analysis is based on a finite element solution of the momentum and continuity equations. It represents the first such predictive model of its kind, with particular interest placed on the nature of both the pressure distribution and web-to-roll gap profile spanning the coating bead. The effect of key operating parameters, web-to-roll speed ratio, web-tension, wrap-angle, capillary number and cell-geometry, on the degree of fluid pickout from gravure cells and the coated film thickness is explored. Although an idealised model, the trends observed show qualitative agreement with existing experimental data collected on a small-scale <b>gravure</b> <b>coating</b> rig and point the way forward to the eventual formulation of a full three-dimensional predictive model of the process. © 2011...|$|E

The flow is modelled using lubrication {{theory and the}} resulting hydrody-namic pressure equation solved using finite elements. It is shown that a stable operating window exists such that as the web to gravure roll speed ratio increases then so to does the fraction of fluid transferred onto the web; increased helix angle having the effect of decreasing the amount of fluid transferred {{at the same speed}} ratio. The agreement between the theoretical predictions and experimental data are found to be good for he-lix angles up to and including 45 ◦, with the assumptions underpinning the model being questionable beyond this point and requiring further refinement. ...|$|R
40|$|While {{small-scale}} viscous {{free surface}} flows are fundamentally challenging {{because of their}} complexity, they are also industrially important due to their widespread occurrence in engineering applications such as inkjet printing, genomic analysis and <b>gravure</b> and roll <b>coating.</b> All free surface flows are distinguished {{by the fact that}} at least a portion of the boundary enclosing the region in which the flow takes place is free to deform. Such flows are often further distinguished by the presence of one or more contact lines. The primary focus of research in this thesis is the rigorous computational investigation and the detailed experimental verification of the dynamics of microscale fluid flows with moving contact lines. First, a new method is reported for deflecting a microscopic jet emanating from a nozzle away from the nozzle 2 ̆ 7 s axis of symmetry. It relies on putting energy into the jet through an asymmetric heater embedded in the nozzle. Whether the contact line is fixed or free is shown to profoundly impact the extent of jet deflection at a given flow rate. The second problem relates to the use of pin-tools for the deposition of small quantities of liquids on substrates. A convenient setup for studying in a controlled manner the dynamics involved in liquid deposition on a substrate using a pin-tool is the so-called liquid bridge. In this thesis, highly accurate and robust numerical algorithms based on the Galerkin/finite element method (G/FEM) are developed for the prediction of the dynamics of deflecting sheets, breakup of free jets, and liquid bridges with dynamic wetting. Accuracy of the computations are reinforced by comparison of predictions to experimental measurements obtained from high speed digital imaging. ...|$|R

Tri-helical gravure roll coating is a process which is used widely for depositing a thin liquid film onto a moving substrate. An analytic model of a simplified form of the process, that of rectangular grooves at 0 mesh angle, is presented together with supporting experimental results which confirm {{the validity of the}} model. Included also are interesting flow visualisations of the coating process, which for the first time shows the underlying physics of the process. Experimental Setup A schematic of the coating rig used to carry out the experiments is shown in figure 1. The apparatus utilises <b>gravure</b> <b>coating</b> rolls, of length 200 mm and diameter 100 mm, which can reach a maximum speed of URoll 100 m s; together with controls for web tension, velocity and wrap angle. The gravure rolls are comprised of an acrylic sleeve mounted with grub screws on a central steel core. This facilitates study of a range of groove geometries and aids the illumination of the fluid bead for flow visualisation purposes achieved by the injection of a small volume of coloured dye. Film thickness measurements were made by scraping fluid from the web over a known time interval. The residual fluid remaining after scraping was found to be negligible. The fluid used in the experiments is a Newtonian water-glycerol mixture with a small volume of surfactant to reduce surface tension. The viscosities used were in the range of µ 0 002 to 0 0075 Pas and with surface tensions of σ 0 033 to 0 065 N m...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{an investigation of}} discrete cell gravure roll coating using computational and experimental techniques. The gravure film thickness experiments conducted {{are similar to those}} presented in previous studies and show a near linear relationship between pickout ratio and speed ratio. This work adds detailed data of the gravure surface for use in computational modelling. Using a white light interferometer, surface images of the gravure topography were captured. From these images the key cell parameters, opening area, cell depth, cell volume and the cell patterning were characterised. Observations of scratches on the coated web were concluded to be caused by contact between the web and roll. A novel computational model was derived for the discrete cell <b>gravure</b> <b>coating</b> process. The model uses a multiscale approach to address the disparate scales of the coating bead and the gravure cell. This is an extension of earlier work and is extended to a three-dimensional, realistic, topography at the small scale and at the large scale a web-to-roll contact model was added. The key topographical gravure features are included via a detailed cell scale model. The computational model was able to predict the near linear relationship between pickout ratio and speed ratio but failed to accurately predict this gradient. The model was shown to be the most accurate at speed ratios near unity. A parametric investigation of both the coating conditions and the gravure cell geometries identified the contact pressure (the pressure caused by the web acting directly on the gravure surface) as being important to the coating process. Its magnitude was related to the web tension, wrap angle and cell size. This led the interesting result that very small cells display no contact pressure and suggests a direction for future work on the investigation of scratch free coatings. ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{investigations into}} a number of coating processes using experimental, analytical and computational techniques. The first problem, considered experimentally, is that of reverse roll coating with a liquid reservoir positioned directly above horizontally aligned rollers. Measurements of the film thickness {{as a function of the}} height of fluid in the reservoir and speed ratio are presented. When the wetting line is located downstream of the nip, either a decrease in the height of the associated hydrostatic head or an increase in the speed ratio causes a reduction in the thickness of the outgoing film. However, when the wetting line is located upstream of the nip the opposite is found to be true. The bead-break instability in forward meniscus coating is considered both experimentally and analytically. Agreement between predictions from a simple mathematical model of the stable bead and experimentally determined meniscus positions is seen to be excellent. A perturbation hypothesis is used to predict the onset of the bead-break instability, at which the upstream meniscus accelerates rapidly towards the downstream one, so the two collide and the bead collapses. The results from the model compare well with experiments. An outline of a method for using the bead-break instability as a design criterion is also presented. Typically in a slot, blade or knife coater the downstream meniscus is assumed to pin at a corner of the coating device. In chapter 5, a series of experiments and a corresponding computational study, are presented which illustrate that the meniscus can advance up the face of such coating devices (in this case a roll-flat plate system). Reducing the corner angle is seen to reduce the size of the climb region and the associated recirculation at this point at the downstream meniscus. It is also shown that the meniscus can detach from the corner and retreat into the gap, which can in turn give rise to the ribbing instability. An offset <b>gravure</b> <b>coating</b> arrangement is considered in chapter 6. The coating arrangement is split into two areas of study - the offset gravure nip and the kiss coating bead. An experimental investigation of the offset nip with the two rolls vertically aligned and running at the same speed in forward mode reveals two ways in which the metered film thickness can be influenced. Either increasing the nip force by pressing the two rolls together or decreasing the roll speeds causes a reduction in the metered film thickness. At higher speeds the metered film thickness is observed to asymptote to a limiting value, the value of which depends on the gravure pattern. The reverse mode kiss coating bead operating at speed ratios greater than one is also investigated. Experiments reveal that under these conditions, all the fluid is transferred from the roll surface to the web and the two make contact due to the generation of a sub-ambient pressure field within the bead. Two models based on lubrication theory are derived, one assuming an infinitely tensioned web and a second that incorporates the effect of web flexibility. The latter is found to give much better agreement with the experimental data. Finally a perturbation hypothesis is applied to these to models in order to predict the onset of the ribbing instability, both of which are found to give reasonable agreement with the experimental data. Finally, the results of a systematic experimental investigation of reverse mode direct <b>gravure</b> <b>coating</b> is reported, where the web runs directly over a gravure roll surface. This wide ranging parametric study illustrates the effect of the operating parameters on the final film thickness. Key findings are that speed ratio, fluid properties and cell shape and size can significantly influence the final film thickness. For a fixed roll speed it is observed that as the web speed is increased the gravure bead becomes unstable. This results in streaking on the web, and gives an upper limit to the speed ratio. ...|$|E
40|$|Dynamics of drops forming from {{capillaries}} and nozzles {{and that}} of stretching liquid bridges are not only fundamentally important scientific problems but they also {{lie at the heart}} of many applications including inkjet printing, biochip arraying, spray coating, filament-stretching rheometry, and <b>gravure</b> <b>coating</b> where the working fluid is often non-Newtonian. A major goal of this thesis is to develop accurate and efficient computational methods to predict the dynamics and breakup of drops and bridges of non-Newtonian liquids. The theoretical approach consists of Galerkin/finite element analysis of the full two-dimensional (2 -d) set of equations and a one-dimensional (1 -d) approximation based on slender jet theory governing the dynamics. A comparison of predictions made with the 1 -d and 2 -d algorithms in the case of Newtonian and shear-thinning liquid bridges is presented here for the first time and at the outset in order to establish when the 1 -d theory is accurate. The thesis then goes on to tackle a number of increasingly more difficult situations using slender jet theory. The 1 -d algorithm is used here for the first time to follow not only the creation of satellite droplets but whether they persist or get eliminated by merging with the primary drop. Unlike previous studies, this work also examines the effect of both simple and complex non-Newtonian rheology on the physics of interface rupture. First a generalized Newtonian fluid model accounting for shear thinning and strain hardening and then a more complex and fully viscoelastic fluid model that treats the polymer molecules as so-called FENE dumbbells are utilized. The 1 -d algorithm is also utilized to put on firm theoretical footing the century-old drop weight method for measuring surface tension. Experimental observations based on high-speed digital imaging are utilized to motivate and support the theoretical studies. While such studies are important in their own right, they also point out deficiencies in existing theoretical models and aid in the development of a new technique for the measurement of extensional viscosity of viscoelastic fluids. A filament stretching rheometer based on a liquid bridge design is built here in order to probe extensional properties of polymer solutions. ...|$|E
40|$|Tri-helical, gravure roll coating, {{operated}} in reverse mode, is investigated via a combined experimental, theoretical and computational approach. New experiments {{were conducted on}} a pilot coating rig, designed to simulate the industrial process. Flow visualisations reveal the underlying flow structure within the roll-to-web transfer region and highlight when loss of coating stability (streaking) occurs. The latter {{is found to be}} influenced by the depth of the tri-helical grooves and the capillary number. Experiments show that as the web-to-roll speed ratio is increased, so too is fluid pickout from the grooves, although the coated film thickness may decrease. A key feature of the present investigation is the formulation of a novel complementary mathematical model. By starting with a simplified form of the coating process and progressively adding complexity a set of models are developed, first for simple zero pitch angled rectangular grooves then for grooves of arbitrary shape and groove pitch. A further extension to the model is the inclusion of a non-Newtonian model for the fluid (specifically a shear thinning power law formulation). Analysis of the application of shear thinning fluids to the moving substrate is also conducted. The base model developed is that for rectangular grooves of zero pitch, which takes the form of an analytical solution of the flow equation (a Poisson equation) along a groove. An extension to this model is made by solving the Poisson equation for non-rectangular grooves using the finite element method. Simple meniscus models were applied to make the problem tractable. Agreement between experimental data and predictions from the model is seen to be good for the range of operating conditions considered up to the onset of streaking. A final extension to the model considers grooves at non-zero pitch angles, representative of the industrial coating process. The limitations of this model, when compared to experimental data are examined and a physical explanation is postulated for the breakdown of the model at steep pitch angles. Under conditions of breakdown, the high pressures within the groove are consistent with the idea that elastohydrodynamics is an important mechanism in the transfer of fluid within the coating bead for discrete cell <b>gravure</b> <b>coating.</b> EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
