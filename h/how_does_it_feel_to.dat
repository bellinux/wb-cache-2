5|$|A WoodSearch Films short-subject {{documentary}} entitled <b>How</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>feel</b> <b>to</b> work on One World Trade Center? was uploaded to YouTube on August 31, 2010. It depicted {{construction workers}} who {{were satisfied with the}} working conditions at the construction site. However, further analysis of the work site showed that dozens of construction-related injuries had occurred at the site during the construction of One World Trade Center, including 34 not reported to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Workers also left post-9/11-related graffiti at the site, which are supposed to symbolize rebirth and resilience.|$|E
500|$|... "Army of Me" [...] is an up-tempo dance-pop [...] and euro-dance song which {{lasts for}} a {{duration}} of [...] (three minutes and 26 seconds). Instrumentation {{consists of a}} [...] "pounding" [...] drum beat and [...] "rocky" [...] guitars. Aguilera presents herself as a fighter and tells her ex-boyfriend that she is stronger than {{he is in the}} lyrics [...] "So <b>how</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>feel</b> <b>to</b> know that I beat you?/ That I can defeat you?" [...] Although Aguilera is heartbroken by the decision to split up with her ex-boyfriend, she is not a broken person. The lyrics [...] "One of me is wiser/ One of me is stronger/ One of me's a fighter/ And there's a thousand faces of me/ We're gonna rise up for every time you broke me/ You're gonna face an army of me" [...] are similar to those performed by Aguilera on [...] "Fighter", although of [...] "Army of Me" [...] does not sample any of the song. Aguilera sings [...] "Now that I'm wiser/ Now that I'm stronger/ Now that I'm a fighter/ There's a thousand faces on me" [...] over a [...] "thumping" [...] beat, and belts the line [...] "We're gonna rise up for every time you broke me" [...] on the chorus.|$|E

She worked really hard." [...] Sarah Lane's involvement in Black Swan was also mentioned in two other dance magazines and in an article on The New York Times website.|$|E

First you should ask me if I'm afraid when I'm flying. Oh, always begin that way. Then you say that there's a curious fact about you--when you're on a high {{building}} and just look down once, then you get so dizzy that you want to jump. Then, after you've said that----Let's see. You're a church member, aren't you? Well then, next you'd say, 'Just <b>how</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>feel</b> <b>to</b> be up in an aeroplane?' or if you don't say that then you've simply got to say, 'Just <b>how</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>feel</b> <b>to</b> fly, anyway?' But if you're just terribly interested, Dorothy, you might ask about biplanes versus monoplanes, and 'Do I think there'll ever be a flight across the Atlantic?' But whatever you do, Dorothy, don't fail to ask me if I'll give you a free ride when I start flying again. And we'll fly and fly----Like birds. You know. Or like the Dancing Bacchante.... That's the way to talk about aviation.... And now you tell me all about babies!" ...|$|E
