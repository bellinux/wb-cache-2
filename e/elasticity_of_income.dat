40|$|The intergenerational <b>elasticity</b> <b>of</b> <b>income</b> is {{generally}} {{considered one of the}} best summary measures {{of the degree to which}} a society gives equal opportunity of success to all its members, irrespective of their family background. We present a parsimonious political economy model and show how the interaction between private and collective decisions determines the equilibrium level of mobility. Contrary to what it {{is generally}} assumed, a low correlation between father income and son income is not always desirable, as it may imply more inefficiency due to the distortionary effects of mobility-enhancing public policies. Moreover, taking into account the heterogeneity in preferences for intergenerational mobility leads to the conclusion that even if a fully mobile society is desirable ex ante, it may not be politically sustainable ex post. Our model clarifies the structural parameters behind the widely studied intergenerational <b>elasticity</b> <b>of</b> <b>income</b> in terms of political economy forces. Finally, we show some empirical evidence on the relationship between intergenerational <b>elasticity</b> <b>of</b> <b>income</b> across countries and its underlying determinants that is consistent with the predictions of the model. ...|$|E

40|$|A central {{tax policy}} {{parameter}} that has recently received much attention, but about {{which there is}} substantial uncertainty, is the overall <b>elasticity</b> <b>of</b> taxable <b>income.</b> We provide new estimates <b>of</b> this <b>elasticity</b> which address identification problems with previous work, by exploiting a long panel of tax returns to study a series of tax reforms throughout the 1980 s. This identification strategy also allows us to provide new evidence on both the <b>income</b> effects <b>of</b> tax changes on taxable income, and on variation in the <b>elasticity</b> <b>of</b> taxable <b>income</b> by income group. We find that the overall <b>elasticity</b> <b>of</b> taxable <b>income</b> is approximately 0. 4; the <b>elasticity</b> <b>of</b> real <b>income,</b> not including tax preferences, is much lower. We also estimate small income effects on tax changes on reported income, implying that the compensated and uncompensated <b>elasticities</b> <b>of</b> taxable <b>income</b> are very similar. We estimate that this overall elasticity is primarily due to a very elastic response <b>of</b> taxable <b>income</b> for taxpayers who have incomes above $ 100, 000 per year, who have an <b>elasticity</b> <b>of</b> 0. 57, while for those with incomes below $ 100, 000 per year the elasticity is less than one-third as large. Moreover, high income taxpayers who itemize are particularly responsive to taxation. We then derive optimal income tax structures using these elasticities.

The Engel curve hypothesizes that calories are determined by income whereas the efficiency wage hypothesis posits the converse.

The long-run income elasticity of calorie demand is 0. 25, and the calorie <b>elasticity</b> <b>of</b> <b>income</b> generation is 1. 78.
