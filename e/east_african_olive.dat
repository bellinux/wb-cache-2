5000|$|Olea hochstetteri (<b>East</b> <b>African</b> <b>olive,</b> black ironwood) is {{a species}} of tree of the Oleaceae family, often {{considered}} a subspecies of Olea capensis. Like the related species Olea welwitschii, it grows in sandy desert regions of Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda. It is an inconspicuous plant that does not attain great height, in contrast to O. welwitschii which can attain a height of 25m.|$|E
40|$|<b>African</b> <b>olive</b> (Olea europaea ssp. cuspidata) {{is a small}} {{evergreen}} tree {{which has}} become highly invasive at a landscape scale in the western Sydney and Hunter Valley regions of New South Wales, Australia. <b>African</b> <b>olive</b> invasion results {{in the formation of}} a dense and permanent mid-canopy in grassy woodland vegetation. We investigated the relationship between <b>African</b> <b>olive</b> and native species establishment, abundance and diversity, using field surveys and a manipulative shading experiment. There were 78 % fewer native species beneath <b>African</b> <b>olive</b> canopy in the field compared to uninvaded woodland sites. The shading experiment showed that simulated dense <b>African</b> <b>olive</b> shade levels produced the lowest dry weight for the three native species studied, with simulated canopy edge light providing optimal conditions for the native shrub Bursaria spinosa and <b>African</b> <b>olive.</b> Dense <b>African</b> <b>olive</b> shade levels produced the highest mortality rate for native species; however, <b>African</b> <b>olive</b> was able to maintain an 88 % survival rate under dense canopy shade. This study confirms the adaptability of <b>African</b> <b>olive</b> and its capacity to decrease native plant diversity and substantially modify native vegetation at the community level. 8 page(s...|$|R
40|$|<b>African</b> <b>Olive,</b> Olea europaea subsp. cuspidata (Wall. ex G. Don) Cif. (family Oleaceae) is a dense-crowned tree {{introduced}} into Australia for horticulture {{in the mid}} 19 th century. In recent decades, <b>African</b> <b>Olive</b> has become an aggressive woody weed, capable of forming a dense and permanent canopy {{in a wide range}} of vegetation types in south-west Sydney and beyond. Characteristics of <b>African</b> <b>Olive</b> invasion in south-west Sydney, and its seed dispersal by frugivorous birds are consistent with experience from Norfolk Island and Hawaii. We use records and aerial photographs from Mount Annan Botanic Garden and other bushland areas in south-west Sydney to describe the invasion stages and impacts of <b>African</b> <b>Olive.</b> The capacity for <b>African</b> <b>Olive</b> to establish in both temperate and subtropical zones, underlie the potential for spread well beyond current distribution in New South Wales. Research is now required to further develop control techniques and ecological restoration strategies for areas of heavy <b>African</b> <b>Olive</b> infestation. Mapping of current locations and a coordinated control strategy for <b>African</b> <b>Olive</b> is required to prevent future permanent loss of native plant diversity...|$|R
40|$|Question: Is {{satellite}} imagery an effective tool for mapping and examining {{the distribution of}} the invasive species Olea europaea L. ssp. cuspidata at a regional landscape scale? Location: Southwest Sydney, Australia. Methods: Remote sensing software was used to classify pixels of Olea europaea L. ssp. cuspidata (<b>African</b> <b>Olive)</b> and major vegetation types from {{satellite imagery}}, using a "supervised classification" technique across a 721 km 2 study area in the Cumberland Plain region of western Sydney. A map of <b>African</b> <b>Olive</b> distribution was produced from the image analysis and checked for accuracy at 337 random locations using ground observation and comparison with existing vegetation maps. The <b>African</b> <b>Olive</b> distribution data were then used in a GIS analysis with additional spatial datasets to investigate the relationship between the distribution of <b>African</b> <b>Olive</b> and environmental factors, and to quantify the conservation threat to endangered native vegetation. Results: A total area of 1907 ha of dense <b>African</b> <b>Olive</b> infestation was identified, with an omission error of 7. 5 % and a commission error of 5. 4 %. <b>African</b> <b>Olive</b> was found to occur on the steepest slopes (mean slope 14. 3 °) of the vegetation classes examined, with aspect analysis identifying a high prevalence on south- and southwest-facing slopes. The analysis also quantified the level of <b>African</b> <b>Olive</b> infestation in endangered ecological communities, with Western Sydney Dry Rainforest (25 % affected) and Moist Shale Woodland (28 % affected) identified as most vulnerable to <b>African</b> <b>Olive</b> invasion. Conclusion: The distribution of <b>African</b> <b>Olive</b> can be efficiently mapped at a landscape scale. This technique, used in association with additional spatial datasets, identified <b>African</b> <b>Olive</b> as a significant environmental weed in SW Sydney, occupying a greater area than previously recognised and threatening several endangered native vegetation communities. 10 page(s...|$|R
50|$|On the {{northern}} slopes the dominant species is the <b>East</b> <b>African</b> juniper Juniperus procera. This can be over 30 m (100 ft) tall {{and is used}} as softwood timber. Also used as timber is Podo, Podocarpus milanjianus, which can grow to 45 m.The <b>African</b> <b>olive</b> Olea europaea (previously O. afriana) is common in drier forest and at lower elevations. Schefflera is similar to strangler figs, in that it starts as an epiphyte and eventually kills the host tree.Common shrubs are elderberry (Sambucus africanus), and raspberry (Rubus spp.).Herbs are common in the forest, including clover (Trifolium), Shamrock pea (Parochetus communis), sunflecks (Guizotia reptans), balsams (Impatiens spp.), mints (Leonotis spp.and Plectranthus spp.) and stinging nettles (Urtica massaica).|$|R
