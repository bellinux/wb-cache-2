40|$|International audienceThis paper {{reviews the}} {{difficulties}} involved in following and carrying out written instructions. Instructions, especially in professional contexts, {{can be considered}} to be prescribed tasks: the act of authoring instructions relates to the writer's task model whereas the act of using instructions relates to the operator's task model. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine (1) any discrepencies between the two models and (2) the effects of frequency of execution and task complexity upon these discrepancies. Five instructions in flowchart form were selected from materials dealing with difficulties facing train drivers. Following a comparison between sixteen operators' verbal reports and the written instructions, we derived the operator's model and the instruction writer's model. Discrepencies between these two models can be classified into five groups : omission, addition, contradiction, inversion and modulation. The results are in part consistent with the view that the more the incident situation occurs, the greater the discrepancy between the task operator's model and the task writer's model. The results have yielded some useful data on the effect of task solving complexity on the number of deviations. For low task solving complexity, the operator's model seems to be larger than the writer's model; while for high task solving complexity, the operator's model is smaller because of action and condition omissions. Taken together, these results suggest that a prototypical operator's model exists. Some suggestions for improving the use of written instructions are made. L'état actuel des connaissances sur les facteurs d'efficacité des consignes semble pouvoir être complété par une approche considérant d'une part un modèle de la tâche particulier à l'opérateur et d'autre part un modèle de la tâche du prescripteur reflété par la consigne. A partir d'une analyse de protocoles verbaux de seize conducteurs de trains et de cinq consignes pour situations d'incidents dans la conduite de train, l'existence d'écarts entre les deux modèles est mise en évidence.

Based on bivariate {{and multivariate}} cointegration, three inferences concerning {{the nature of}} the British regional unemployment rates are drawn. First, regional unemployment rates are characterized by long-run, persistent relationships. The differentials are maintained by equilibrating systemic forces that induce co-movements of rates in the long-run, implying that decreasing the national rate of unemployment will reduce regional rates, but not eliminate differentials. Second, multivariate cointegration provides a richer picture of unemployment co-movements compared with bivariate analysis.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a methodology based on bayesian formalism to represent and to handle geometric uncertainties in robotics and CAD systems. In such systems, using geometric models requires necessarily {{a more or}} less realistic modeling of the environment. However, the validity of calculation on these models depends on the degree of their fidelity regarding the real environment. It also depends on the capacity to represent and to take into account possible differences between models and reality when solving a given problem. The approach presented in this work may be seen as a eneralization of constraintbased approaches where uncertainties on models are taken into account. A constraint on a relative pose between two objects is represented by a probability distribution on parameters of this pose instead of a simple equality or inequality. After the specification of the constraints, the joint distribution on the parameters of the model is constructed. For a given problem, the marginal distribution on the unknown parameters is inferred using probability calculus. The original problem is reduced to an optimization one over the marginal distribution to find a solution with a maximum probability. This marginal probability may contain, in the general case, an integral on a large dimension space. The resolution method used for this integration/optimization problem is based on an adaptive genetic algorithm. The problem of integration is approached using a stochastic Monte Carlo method. The precision of this numerical estimation of integrals is controlled by the optimization process to reduce the computation time. An extensive experimentation of the approach was made possible thanks to the design and the implementation of a bayesian CAD system. The easiness of specification method made possible to test our method on numerous robotic applications. Experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness and the robustness of our approach. Cette these porte sur l'utilisation du formalisme bayesien pour la repr´esentation et la manipulation des incertitudes geometriques dans les systemes de Robotique et de CAORobotique. Dans ces systemes, l'utilisation d'un modele geometrique de l'environnement est indispensable. Toutefois, la validite des calculs conduits sur ces mod`eles n´ecessite une repr´esentation des <b>ecarts</b> entre le modele et la realite et une prise en compte de ces <b>ecarts</b> lors de la resolution d'un probleme donne. L'approche proposee repr´esente une extension de la notion de specification par contraintes geometriques dans laquelle la dimension incertaine des modeles est prise en compte. Cette extension consiste a specifier les contraintes sur les positions relatives entre diff´erents corps de l'environnement non pas par de simples equations et inequations, mais par des distributions de probabilite sur les parametres de ces positions. A l'issue de cette specification, une distribution conjointe sur l'ensemble des parametres du modele est construite. Pour un probleme donne, la distribution marginale sur les parametres inconnus de ce dernier est inferee en utilisant les regles des probabilites. La resolution de ce probleme revient a optimiser cette distribution comportant, dans le cas general, une integrale portant sur un espace de grande dimension. La methode de resolution utilisee pour approcher ce double probleme d'integration/optimisation est basee sur un algorithme genetique. Cet algorithme permet en particulier de controler la precision de l'estimation numerique des integrales par une m´ethode stochastique de Monte-Carlo. L'implantation d'un systeme prototype de CAO nous a permis une experimentation assez poussee de l'approche propos´ee. La mise en oeuvre de plusieurs applications robotiques, dont les natures peuvent paraıtre tres differentes, a ete possible grace a la souplesse de la methode de specification utilisee et la robustesse de la methode de resolution implantee...|$|R

40|$|This article surveys studies {{focusing}} on pre-modern Korean medicine, which are both written in English and analyzed primary sources up to 1876. Overall, {{the history of}} pre-modern Korean medicine is an unknown filed in Anglophone academia. Yung Sik Kim's, James Palais's, and Carter <b>Ecart's</b> problematization of the nationalist framework of Korean scholarship partially explains the marginality of the field. Addressing these criticisms, this review argues that pre-modern Korean medicine's uneasy task lies in both elaborating Korea's own experience of medicine, while simultaneously avoiding making the "Korean" category itself essential. Korean narratives of premodern medicine need {{to go beyond the}} mere territorilalization of Korean medicine against its Chinese, Japanese, or Western counterparts, thereby to tackle the field's own boundary of research objects. The existing scholarship in English responds to this challenge by primarily examining the way in which Korea has shared textual tradition with China. Sirhak scholars' innovation in medicine, visual representation of Tong?i bogam, Korean management of epidemics in the eleventh century, and Korean indexing of local botanicals, engages not only native achievements, but also the process of modifying medicine across geographical and political boundaries. More to the point, the emerging native narratives, although written in Korean, are implicitly resonant with those currently present in Anglophone academia. Taking "tension," "intertextuality," and "local traits" as a lens, this article assesses a series of current research in Korea. Aiming to go beyond appeals for a "distinctively" Korean experience of medicine, the future study of Korean pre-modern medicine will further elucidate confluences of different flows, such as "Chinese and Korean," "universal and local," "center and periphery," and "native and foreign," which will eventually articulate a range of Korean techniques of creating a bricolage in medicine...|$|R
40|$|L'Indice de Polluosensibilité Spécifique (IPS) est considéré comme l'un des indices diatomiques les plus performants pour l'évaluation de la qualité des cours d'eau. Son {{utilisation}} en réseau de surveillance reste cependant limitée {{en raison de}} la nécessité de travailler {{au niveau}} spécifique voire infraspécifique et de la systématique en perpétuelle évolution. A l'opposé, l'Indice Diatomique Générique (IDG) est plus accessible dans sa mise en oeuvre mais ne permet pas d'obtenir des résultats très fiables. Un nouvel Indice Diatomique Pratique (IDP) a donc été mis au point sur un bassin versant expérimental à partir d'un jeu de 86 relevés. Dans un premier temps, les inventaires ont été classés en fonction des <b>écarts</b> observés entre IPS et IDG. Dans un second temps, ont été identifiées les espèces responsables de ces <b>écarts</b> en prenant en compte celles présentant une abondance relative supérieure à 5 % et une différence de polluosensibilité avec le genre correspondant supérieure ou égale à 0, 4. Plusieurs IDP ont été mis au point et leurs performances, par rapport à l'IPS, étudiées. Il apparaît que la prise en compte des espèces responsables des <b>écarts</b> supérieurs ou égaux à 2 constitue le meilleur compromis entre fiabilité et applicabilité en réseau. Cette méthodologie a été appliquée aux 480 relevés effectués dans le bassin Artois - Picardie et aux 550 espèces inventoriées. Elle permet de proposer un indice diatomique pratique basé sur l'identification de 45 genres et 91 espèces. Macroinvertebrates constitute the main biological support for {{an evaluation of the}} quality of water courses and are, therefore, widely put to use in monitoring networks. However, for major water courses and canalized waterways the use of other methodologies is imperative. Diatoms and diatom indices are well adapted to the study of these environments. Among these, the Specific Polluosensitivity Index (SPI) established by CEMAGREF seems {{to be one of the}} better performing diatom indices. Calculation of this index relies on the Zelinka & Marvan formula derived from the saprobic system: SPI=[Epsilon]A[inf]j v[inf]j i[inf]j / [Epsilon] A[inf]j v[inf]j where A[inf]j is the relative abundance of the species j, v j is its indicative value (1 [smaller or equal] v[inf]j [smaller or equal] 3) and i[inf]j its pollution sensitivity (1 [smaller or equal] i[inf]j [smaller or equal] 5). The values initially falling in the range between 1 and 5 are transformed into values comprised between 1 and 20, in order to make comparisons between the various existing indices easier. Five categories of water quality can be distinguished according to the value of the index: SPI [Bigger or equal] 16 : zero pollution or low eutrophication; 13. 5 [smaller or equal] SPI < 16 : moderate eutrophication; 11 [smaller or equal] SPI < 13. 5 : moderate pollution or heavy eutrophication; 7 [smaller or equal] SPI < 11 : high pollution; SPI < 7  : very heavy pollution. However, the SPI index is rarely used because of two main obstacles: it requires data at a specific or even infraspecific level, and it is based on constantly changing systematics. Progress towards increased accessibility and, therefore, larger application was made with the elaboration of the Generic Diatomic Index (IDG) based on the same principle as the SPI. However, this GDI does not yield reliable results, in so far as certain genera, such as Navicula and Nitzschia, contain species with a widely differing ecologies. In order to provide a methodology that can be used as a matter of routine, a protocol for the elaboration of a Practical Diatomic Index (PDI) was established and tested on 86 inventories from the water basin of the river Aa (North of France). These were first classified into four categories according to the variations observed between SPI and GDI: category 1 : |SPI-GDI| [bigger or equal] 3; category 2 : 2 [smaller or equal] |SPI-GDI|; category 3 : 1 [smaller or equal] |SPI-DGI| < 2; category 4 : |SPI-DGI| < 1. For each of the first three categories, the species responsible for the variations were identified, taking into consideration those with a relative abundance of more than 5 %, the pollution sensitivity of which showed, compared to the corresponding genus, a variation higher than or equal to 0. 4. Thus, three indices corresponding respectively to category 1 (PDI 1), 2 (PDI 2), and 3 (PDI 3) were proposed and tested against the SPI taken as reference index. The results of this comparative study can be summarized as follows:- GDI= 0. 57 SPI + 5. 47 r= 0. 801 (242 species), - PDI 1 = 0. 86 SPI + 1. 12 r= 0. 972 (27 species), - PDI 2 = 0. 95 SPI + 0. 55 r= 0. 991 (39 species), - PDI 3 = 0. 96 SPI + 0. 45 r= 0. 994 (42 species). To test the implications of replacing the presently used SPI by this practical index, a comparative study of the classification of inventories in four categories of hydrobiological quality was also carried out. This study shows that the mean, at - 1. 76 ± 2. 25 for the GDI, is reduced to 0. 14 ± 0. 94 for PDI 1, to - 0. 07 ± 0. 51 for PDI 2, and to - 0. 07 ± 0. 45 for PDI 3. Given the variability of the index at one and the same site and in one sampling, PDI 2 considered to be the best compromise between reliability and network applicability. The methodology corresponding to PDI 2 was applied to the 480 samplings carried out in the Artois-Picardie basin and a new Practical Diatom Index is thus proposed for the monitoring of the 200 sites making up the monitoring network of the Artois-Picardie water basin. This PDI, built on a base of more than 550 species and varieties, rests on the joint determination of 45 genera and 91 species of which the pollution sensitivity coefficients and the indicative values are given...|$|R

Like many other public figures of the same period, this author has associated a retrospective reflection with a diagnosis of the current events of his country and he has extended his overall view towards larger geographical spaces. Besides, he has pursued an intense activity in the realm of public affaires. Thus, his intellectual career and his political propositions have intertwined many times during the years of his activity without, however, any of them being dependent of the other. Our perspective intends to highlight not only the relationships between these two levels but also their spaces of possible autonomy, their gaps, tensions and conflicts. Herrera’s case is here examined as a form of a broader interrogation over the conditions of exercise concerning the intellectual activity of his time...|$|R
40|$|Productivity {{gaps and}} « cost illness ». Contributions {{and limits of}} William J. Baumol's {{unbalanced}} growth model This paper exposes and analyses Baumol's unbalanced growth model, develo­ped in 1967. This model, which was revisited and empirically tested in 1985 by Baumol, Blackman and Wolff, tackles a subject that is still of great interest : productivity in the service sector. It emphasises the consequences on employment and growth of a productivity gap between the 'progressive' and 'non-progressive' sectors of the economy. Since the model is mainly concerned by the supply side, it faces some theoretical limits. The discussion of the propositions and the assumptions allows us to value the model's significance and to conclude that an analysis must incorporate both supply and demand aspects in order to really explain the mechanisms that determine production and employment in the different economic sectors.

40|$|Après avoir présenté la {{situation}} actuelle en regard des politiques de rémunération de la main-d'oeuvre dans les secteurs publics fédéral et québécois, l'auteur propose une nouvelle démarche en expliquant le modèle d'estimation des <b>écarts</b> de rémunération entre les secteurs public et privé. 1. Establish {{the basis}} of comparison betweencomparable employees in {{the public and private}} sectors through the use of multivariate regression applied to a selected number of typical jobs with the following characteristics: recruiting, turn-over, and shortages. Purpose: to be able to distinguish between the part of the public/ private gap linked to personal characteristics and the real public/private gap and to be able to efficiently link public remuneration to the private. 2. Establish a coherent interval structure of remuneration for the public and the para-public sectors based on a system of job evaluation. Purpose: to decentralize salary decision-making and increase employee productivity. 3. Establish comparisons within Québec Province with federal government services, municipalities, and non-profit-making organizations: all of which compete with the provincial government for manpower on the Québec labour market. 4. Makeadjustments to observed data for the private sector, in order to include:— spillover effect of the public sector on the private in the past;— employment security;— differences in productivity between the civil services of Québec and Ontario;— varying fiscal effect of different types of remuneration. 5. Give regional and local levels a real role in the distribution of the total salary package and the determination of individual salaries. 6. Make the Bureau de la recherche sur la remuneration (Pay Research Bureau) tri-partite of at least assure that application of the proposed method in (1) be under-taken by an autonomous body. 7. Establish a system of signal to measure excess supply and demand, and to orient the fixing of remuneration levels in the public sector according to recruiting needs. 8. Revise salariesannually according to information on individual salaries, obtained through a representative sample (stratified and proportional) and analysed with the aid of multivariate regression. This makes it unnecessary to use explicit indexation to the cost of living and to "collective enrichment" (productivity). 9. Move gradually toward the method of simulated costs to determine the level of fringe benefits...|$|R
