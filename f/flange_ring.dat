40|$|Abstract. Bearing is {{the core}} {{components}} of wind power equipment. According to the special requirement of high reliability, long life of wind power bearing, the current manufacturing defects {{of it has been}} analyzed, such as flange, pits, fish-tail, folding, and comparing with its current manufacturing method, which is called ring rolling, therefore, a new method called rolling and bulging-matching techniques is proposed, as wind power bearing ring should be released stress after rolling, then sized through bulging and once again to stress. Ring bulging is still a blank space in China; this project plans to research bulging process kinematics and dynamics analysis first. This paper gives a brief introduction of bulging processing and focus on the analysis of wind power bearing ring bulging forming. Preface At present, the main forming method of large different section ring parts is ring rolling. Ring rolling is a new special forming process to produce seamless ring, it is widely used in the production of ring parts or blanks like <b>flange</b> <b>ring,</b> bearing ring, gear ring, and train wheels [6].

40|$|The {{recognised}} {{standard method}} of gasketed flanged joint design contained within most pressure vessel codes is {{that based on}} the Taylor Forge procedure (Trans ASME 59 (1937) 161). This has, as its basis, bolt load calculations, which are designed to apply sufficient load to both seat and initialise the gasket, and to ensure sealing via a gasket when the operational pressure load is present. The <b>flange</b> <b>ring</b> and hub transmit the bolt load to the gasket and must therefore be stiff and flat. However, there are many real situations where additional loads arise through external pulling and bending. This is commonly seen in piping systems and other flanged pressure equipment. Although the codes do not specifically address the 'combined load' problem, the normal method for considering this additional load is to form an equivalent pressure. This over-pressure is calculated by making the stress generated in the pipe or vessel wall, by the external load, equal to a longitudinal pressure stress which may be tensile or compressive, depending {{on the nature of}} the load. This results in an over-pressure which can therefore be added to the operating pressure. For bending loads, no account is taken of the variation around the circumference, or the change in gasket seating width, which will vary as the flange faces rotate. In order to assess the effects of external loading on flanges, a combined load test rig has been constructed and a number of bolted flange assemblies examined including standard ANSI joints and compact VERAX VCF joints (Fig. 1 a and b). These assemblies have been strain gauged and tested for a variety of load conditions. Tests have been carried out using hydraulic fluid as the main pressurising medium. The results of the individual tests and the combinations of load are presented and discussed...|$|E
40|$|A {{corrosion}} study involving high-alloy {{materials and}} concentrated hydrofluoric acid (HF) {{was conducted in}} support of the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment Conversion Project (CP). The purpose of the test was to obtain a greater understanding of the corrosion rates of materials of construction currently used in the CP vs those of proposed replacement parts. Results of the study will help formulate a change-out schedule for CP parts. The CP will convert slightly less than 40 kg of {sup 233 }U from a gas (UF{sub 6 }) sorbed on sodium fluoride pellets to a more stable oxide (U{sub 3 }O{sub 8 }). One by-product of the conversion is the formation of concentrated HF. Six moles of highly corrosive HF are produced for each mole of UF{sub 6 } converted. This acid is particularly corrosive to most metals, elastomers, and silica-containing materials. A common impurity found in {sup 233 }U is {sup 232 }U. This impurity isotope has several daughters that make the handling of the {sup 233 }U difficult. Traps of {sup 233 }U may have radiation fields of up to 400 R at contact, a situation that makes the process of changing valves or working on the CP more challenging. It is also for this reason that a comprehensive part change-out schedule must be established. Laboratory experiments involving the repeated transfer of HF through 1 / 2 -in. metal tubing and valves have proven difficult due to the corrosivity of the HF upon contact with all wetted parts. Each batch of HF is approximately 1. 5 L of 33 wt% HF and is transferred most often as a vapor under vacuum and at temperatures of up to 250 C. Materials used in the HF side of the CP include Hastelloy C- 276 and Monel 400 tubing, Haynes 230 and alloy C- 276 vessels, and alloy 400 valve bodies with Inconel (alloy 600) bellows. The chemical compositions of the metals discussed in this report are displayed in Table 1. Of particular concern are the almost 30 vendor-supplied UG valves that have the potential for exposure to HF. These valves have been proven to have a finite life due to failure, most often at the bellows <b>flange</b> <b>ring.</b> It was discovered that the entire bellows assembly was not all alloy 600 but that alloy 600 bellows had been welded to a stainless steel alloy 316 (SS- 316) <b>flange</b> <b>ring.</b> A previous study documents and addresses this problem. 1 The fabricators of the valves immediately corrected the problem and began fabricating all wetted parts of the bellows assembly from alloy 600. At the same time, the fabricators began to make alloy C- 276 valve bodies and stem tips available for sale. This material is known to be superior to the alloy 400 valve bodies and stem tips of the standard UG valves that had already been installed in the CP. A decision was made to purchase alloy C- 276 bodies and stem tips and to change out those alloy 400 components that had already been installed. Due to the enormity of this task (both in terms of time and money), it was desirable to determine the longevity of alloy C- 276 vs alloy 400 components in a side-by-side comparison. Also of interest was the question of how long the new (all-alloy 600) bellows would last in comparison with the original alloy 600 /SS- 316 bellows. A basic HF corrosion test was proposed to compare corrosion rates of several high-alloy materials. Because much of the alloy 400 in the system had been gold plated, some gold-plated alloy 400 coupons were included. Due to time and funding limitations, actual CP variables such as temperature and pressure were not duplicated. Instead, a simple partial-immersion test at ambient temperature was conducted. The purpose of this test was to gain information on the rate of corrosion of different alloys in the CP and to attempt to derive some idea of their expected lifetimes in the operating environment...|$|E
40|$|Downloaded Fsolid {{ferritic}} flanges have cracked purely due to overload; and {{stainless steel}} overlay ferritic flanges have cracked possibly due {{to a combination of}} mechanisms. The stainless steel overlay flanges may be more prone to cracking than solid ferritic flanges due to crack initiation by Cl SCC of the overlay and differential thermal expansion and residual stresses between the stainless steel overlay and the ferritic base metal. Nonetheless, a major factor in crack initiation for all of these cases is the high localized stress at the corners of the ring groove. It has been well documented that the configuration of standard RTJ flanges does not include sufficient radii {{at the base of the}} ring groove to effectively reduce the local-ized peak stresses. Note that the ASME B 16. 5 standard permitted a very sharp corner of essentially zero radius until a recent ad-denda which includes the requirement for larger radii, which should help mitigate cracking, but probably not eliminate it. During routine inspection of a 2 - 1 / 4 Cr- 1 Mo hydrogen process-ing reactor vessel in a petroleum refinery, cracking was identified in the ring joint flange of the inlet nozzle. The cracking was de-tected while the flange connection was in the assembled condition using a new angle beam UT technique. The cracks encompassed approximately 180 deg of circumference and were located at both the inner and outer radius of the <b>flange</b> <b>ring</b> joint groove. The crack depth was 1. 0 in. ~ 25. 4 mm! on the innermost radius of the depths located at the base of the ring joint groove to evaluate the change in the crack tip driving force. Both elastic and elastic-plastic analyses were performed to evaluate the impact of crack tip plasticity in the resulting J-integral calculation. Metallurgical Testing. A small sliver was removed from the cracked flange. A chemistry analysis was performed to assess the potential for temper embrittlement and a microstructural specimen was prepared to examine the microstructure and to perform a mi-crohardness test to assess the potential for hydrogen-assisted crack growth.

40|$|Bolted, {{segmented}} cylindrical shells are {{a common}} structural component in many engineering systems especially for aerospace launch vehicles. Segmented shells are often needed due to limitations of manufacturing capabilities or transportation issues related to very long, large-diameter cylindrical shells. These cylindrical shells typically have a <b>flange</b> or <b>ring</b> welded to opposite ends so that shell segments can be mated together and bolted to form a larger structural system. As the diameter of these shells increases, maintaining strict fabrication tolerances for the flanges to be flat and parallel on a welded structure is an extreme challenge.

40|$|The {{most common}} {{solutions}} for in-situ connections of steel tubular towersegments of onshore wind turbines are <b>ring</b> <b>flange</b> connections. These havecertain drawbacks, such as e. g. costly production, long delivery time and ratherlow fatigue endurance. Friction connections with long open slotted holes havepreviously {{been proven to}} be a competitive alternative. In this work, the newtype of connection is investigated in various scales: segment tests, down-scaledexperiments and full-scale models. The influence of tower cross-section shape,execution tolerance (horizontal gap between the tower segments) and length ofthe connection on the bending resistance is thoroughly studied. In addition,buckling behaviour of the shell {{in the vicinity of the}} friction connection intowers with circular and polygonal cross-sections is analysed in order to checkpossible advantages of either cross-section. The influence of two types of theexecution tolerances on the connection strength is investigated: inwards bent“fingers”, leading to inclined gaps, and a parallel gap created by differentdiameters of the tower segments. Based on validated finite element analysesrecommendations for execution tolerances are proposed. A closer look is taken at the level of bolt forces under load application for thenew friction connections as well as for the <b>ring</b> <b>flange</b> connection. For theformer case, the influence of slotted holes on the joint resistance is checked. For both types of connections, comparison is drawn to hand calculation modelsused in engineering practice. Additionally, the distribution of meridionalstresses in the shell in the vicinity of the connection is studied. Based on the findings from the above described investigations,recommendations for the design of friction connections with open slotted holesin steel tubular towers for onshore wind turbines are given.

Taking into account the behaviour of the flange in the contact area and bolt bending, a model is developed to predict the plastic resistance of L-stub joints. Simplifications are proposed to facilitate the determination of the contact zone and the ultimate resistances corresponding to failure modes involving flange and bolt. The comparison between analytical results with 3 D finite element elasto-plastic analyses and experimental tests indicates that the proposed model provides good capacity predictions.

5000|$|The final panel {{fabrication}} process, after {{achieving the}} correct surface contour, {{is some kind}} of edge treatment, such as flanging (sheet metal) or wire edging. This finishes and strengthens the edge. Typically, there is {{too much or too little}} metal in the flange, which pulls the panel out of shape after the flange is turned—so it must be stretched or shrunk to correct the surface shape. This is most easily done using Eckold shrinking and stretching, but can be done using heat shrinking or cold shrinking, by tucking and beating the tucked metal into itself, or by using a cold shrinking hammer and dolly. Stretching or shrinking the flange requires a correct profile hammer and dolly. The hammer and dolly must match the desired flange shape at the point of contact through the <b>flange,</b> (known as <b>ringing</b> the dolly) with the hammer. A lot of shrinking or stretching work hardens the flange and can cause cracks and tears. While these can be welded, it is much better to anneal the metal before this happens to restore its workability.|$|R
25|$|On {{the basis}} of {{morphology}} and physical characteristics, tektites have traditionally been divided into four groups. The tektites which have been found on land have traditionally been subdivided into three groups: (1) splash-form (normal) tektites, (2) aerodynamically shaped tektites, and (3) Muong Nong-type (layered) tektites. Splash-form and aerodynamically shaped tektites are only differentiated on {{the basis of}} their appearance and some of their physical characteristics. Splash-form tektites are centimeter-sized tektites that are shaped like spheres, ellipsoids, teardrops, dumbbells, and other forms characteristic of isolated molten bodies. They are regarded as having formed from the solidification of rotating liquids, and not atmospheric ablation. Aerodynamically shaped tektites, which are mainly part of the Australasian strewn field, are splash-form tektites (buttons) which display a secondary <b>ring</b> or <b>flange.</b> The secondary <b>ring</b> or <b>flange</b> is argued as having been produced during the high-speed reentry and ablation of a solidified splash-form tektite into the atmosphere. Muong Nong tektites are typically larger, greater than 10nbsp&cm in size and 24nbsp&kg in weight, irregular, and layered tektites. They have a chunky, blocky appearance, exhibit a layered structure with abundant vesicles, and contain mineral inclusions, such as zircon, baddeleyite, chromite, rutile, corundum, cristobalite and coesite.|$|R

A deformable gasket, usually elastomeric, placed between raised faces on the mating flanges provides the seal. Flanges are designed to a large number of specifications that differ because of dimensional variations in pipes sizes and pressure requirements, and because of independent standards development. In the U.S. flanges are either threaded or welded onto the pipe. In the European market flanges are usually welded onto the pipe. In the US flanges are available in a standard 125 lb. bolt pattern as well as a 250 lb (and heavier) bolt pattern (steel bolt pattern). Both are usually rated at [...] A flanged joint is rigid and can bear both tension and compression as well as a limited degree of shear and bending. It also can be dismantled after assembly. Due to the rigid nature of the joint and the risk of excessive bending moment being imposed, it is advised that flanged pipework is not buried.|$|R

40|$|Prestressed <b>ring</b> <b>flanges</b> are {{frequently}} used in slender structures subjected to wind loads such as chimneys or wind turbine towers. The alternating forces due to wind can cause both fatigue failure and ultimate load {{failure of the}} bolts. For the design of such connections it is therefore important {{to take into account}} possible variations of the bolt forces. Due to manufacturing tolerances the contact surfaces are not ideally plane. While the initial forces (under dead load only) in the bolts can be considered deterministic and uniformly distributed along the circumference of the tube, the forces will be redistributed non-uniformly in the presence of lateral loads. This is a consequence of the non-uniform prestressing state of the flange material. A random field model is assumed to describe the geometry of the contact surface. The mean surface is assumed to be the ideal contact plane, deviations are assumed to be log-normally distributed with an exponential spatial correlation function. A Stochastic Finite Element Model with 13, 000 DOF and 1500 random variables in conjunction with Monte-Carlo methods is then utilized to derive the statistical properties of the random ultimate load of the joint. It is shown that the effect of imperfect contact surfaces can considerably deteriorate structural performance...|$|R

The rods engage the snap ring and urge the ring from the loading groove into the seating groove...|$|R
40|$|A {{final design}} of a dasiacorelesspsila 100 kW HTS {{synchronous}} generator, to be built at the University of Southampton is under way. The new generator will use the same conventional 2 -pole, 3 phase stator used by for the dasiairon coredpsila generator. The new HTS rotor has no central core and the rotor winding is built with 15 double pancake coils. Each coil has 38 turns of BiPb 2223 superconducting tape, with nominal current of 180 A at 77 K. In this design, only two flux diverters are used {{at the top and}} bottom of the winding to help shape the magnetic field. The coils are located on the inner wall of the cryostat. The construction of the cryostat poses our greatest mechanical challenge. Although we have avoided problems with differential thermal contractions by making the cryostat entirely from stainless steel, the cryostat requires considerable reinforcements. Additional supports and stiffening ribs must be welded to the thin-walled structure. Distortion/rippling during welding must be eliminated to ensure the final welds to the <b>ring</b> <b>flanges</b> can be made. The pole-pieces, which help to improve the waveform characteristics of the machine, are located in the warm space between the cold flange of the cryostat and the inner wall of the vacuum vessel. Unfortunately, the overall magnetic performance has been affected by the parallel stacking of the coils. Some suggestions for altering the current stator have been presented which show that improvements to the voltage waveforms can be achieved<br/...|$|R
40|$|Grease is {{commonly}} used to lubricate various machine components such as rolling bearings and seals. In this paper the flow of lubricating grease passing restrictions is described. Such flow occurs in rolling bearings during relubrication events where the grease is flowing in the transverse (axial) direction through the bearing and is hindered by guide <b>rings,</b> <b>flanges</b> etc, {{as well as in}} seals where transverse flow occurs, for example during so-called breathing caused by temperature fluctuations in the bearing. This study uses a 2 D flow model geometry consisting of a wide channel with rectangular cross-section and two different types of restrictions to measure the grease velocity vector field, using the method of Micro Particle Image Velocimetry. In the case of a single restriction, the horizontal distance required for the velocity profile to fully develop is approximately the same as the height of the channel. In the corner before and after the restriction, the velocities are very low and part of the grease is stationary. For the channel with two flow restrictions, this effect is even more pronounced in the “pocket” between the restrictions. Clearly, {{a large part of the}} grease is not moving. This condition particularly applies to the cases with a low-pressure drop and where high consistency grease is used. In practice this means that grease is not replaced in such “corners” and that some aged/contaminated grease will remain in seal pockets...|$|R
