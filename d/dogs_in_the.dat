5|$|At {{the turn}} of the 20th century the area around the mouth of the River Somme was {{considered}} a paradise for hunters interested in wildfowl. Because of quarantine restrictions in the United Kingdom, British shooters would board their <b>dogs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Picardy area, near the mouth of the Somme. This caused the infusion of English Setter blood into the local Spaniel population and developed the Blue Picardy Spaniel.|$|E
5|$|Cocker Spaniels were {{originally}} bred as hunting <b>dogs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United Kingdom, {{with the term}} cocker deriving from their use to hunt the Eurasian woodcock. When the breed {{was brought to the}} United States, it was bred to a different standard, which enabled it to specialize in hunting the American woodcock. Further physical changes were bred into the cocker in the United States during {{the early part of the}} 20th century.|$|E
5|$|It {{was once}} thought that dogs and gray wolves did not voluntarily interbreed in the wild, though they can produce fertile wolf-dog offspring. In 2010, {{a study of}} 74 Italian wolf male {{lineages}} found that 5 of them originated from dog ancestry, indicating that female wolves will breed with stray male <b>dogs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wild. In North America, black colored wolves acquired their coloration from wolf-dog hybridization, which occurred 10,000–15,000 years ago. Like pure wolves, hybrids breed once annually, though their mating season occurs three months earlier, with pups mostly being born in the winter period, thus lessening their chances of survival. However, one genetic study undertaken in the Caucasus Mountains showed {{that as many as}} 10% of <b>dogs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area, including livestock guardian dogs, are first generation hybrids. The captive breeding of wolf-dog hybrids has proliferated in the USA, with 300,000 such animals being present there.|$|E

5|$|As {{the park}} is a {{national}} nature reserve and a Site of Special Scientific Interest, all dog owners are required to keep their dogs under control while in the park. This includes not allowing their dog to disturb other park users or disrupt wildlife. In 2009, after some incidents leading {{to the death of}} wildfowl, the park's dogs-on-leads policy was extended. Park users are said to believe that the deer are feeling increasingly threatened by the growing number of dogs using the park and Royal Parks advises against walking <b>dogs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> park during the deer's birthing season.|$|E

5|$|At the Crystal Palace dog show in 1870, in {{what was}} {{considered}} to be the dog champion class of that time with the qualification requirement of a first place win at another show, Old Jock placed second. The winner was a black and tan terrier named Trimmer, with a line-up of notable <b>dogs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> history of the Fox Terrier including Mr. Murchison's Old Trap; Mr. W.J. Harrison's Jocko; Mr. F Sale's Tyrant, Hornet and Tartar; the Marquis of Huntly's Bounce; Mr. Bewley and Mr. Carson's Quiz; and Mr. W. Gammon's Chance.

5|$|German {{archaeologist}} Karl von den Steinen was {{the first}} European visitor to observe evidence of ancient <b>dogs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Marquesas in 1897–98. In his excavation of meʻae Iʻipona, a temple complex {{near the village of}} Puamaʻu on the northeastern coast of the island of Hiva Oa, he uncovered several stone tiki including two with zoomorphic (animal shaped) quadruped figures carved on them. During this period, the property and temple site was owned by Reverend James Kekela, a Hawaiian Protestant missionary, who von den Steinen befriended. He also relied on an elderly Marquesan named Pihua, who was the only living person who knew the names of the tiki at the site.|$|E

5|$|The Field Spaniel is a {{medium-sized}} breed dog of the spaniel type. They were originally developed to be all-black show <b>dogs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late 19th and early 20th centuries and were unpopular for {{work as a}} hunting dog. However, during the mid-20th century they were redeveloped as a longer-legged dog that was more suitable {{to be used for}} field work. They are now considered to be a rare breed, and are registered as a Vulnerable Native Breed by The Kennel Club.|$|E
5|$|The ancient Egyptians mummified many animal species, from {{cats and}} gazelles to crocodiles, baboons, and birds. Typically, many animal species were {{consumed}} as meat after death, {{but it is}} highly unlikely that dogs would have been eaten. Radiographs of exhumed <b>dogs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ancient world have revealed that the mummification process involved wrapping the embalmed bones together with bandages and placing them within a wooden statue of Anubis, the jackal-headed deity associated with mummification and the afterlife in ancient Egyptian religion.|$|E

5|$|The sandbar of Carabane {{has very}} few mammals other than pets, {{although}} the French first noted {{the presence of}} monkeys in 1835. In 1870, other settlers noted with disgust that the natives often ate monkeys and <b>dogs.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> early 21st century, bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) are commonly sighted off the island. The lack of tourism because of the civil unrest has benefited biodiversity. In this way, the nearby Basse Casamance National Park, which has been closed for years, has seen a remarkable return of Nile crocodiles (Crocodylus niloticus), Senegalese manatees (Trichechus senegalensis), and breeding birds.|$|E
5|$|According to {{historical}} records, the first spaniel {{was brought to}} North America aboard the Mayflower which sailed from Plymouth, England and landed in New England in 1620. The first Cocker Spaniel recorded in America was a liver and white dog named Captain, who was registered with the American Kennel Club in 1878. In 1881, the American Cocker Spaniel Club was formed; it would later become the American Spaniel Club (ASC) and {{is now known as}} the oldest breed club for <b>dogs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States. The task of the club was initially to create a standard to separate the Cocker Spaniel in America from other types of land spaniels, a task which would take over 20 years, only being completed in 1905.|$|E
5|$|In July 2012 it was {{reported}} that police have been given the power to issue £50 on-the-spot fines for littering, cycling outside designated areas and for dog fouling offences. In August 2012 a dog owner was ordered to pay £315 after allowing five dogs to chase ducks in the park. Since 2013 commercial dog-walkers have been required to apply for licences to walk <b>dogs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> park and are allowed to walk only four dogs at a time. In September 2013 a cyclist was successfully prosecuted for speeding at 37mph in the park. In March 2015 a cycling club member was fined for speeding at 41mph and faced disciplinary action from his cycling club, which uses the park for training. In 2014 and 2015 two men were prosecuted for picking mushrooms in the park.|$|E

5|$|In {{order to}} become {{recognised}} fully by the American Kennel Club, they must first compete in a Miscellaneous Class. The requirements to compete in that class are to demonstrate a following by having a minimum of 100 active members in a national breed club, a population of 300 to 400 dogs, with third generation pedigrees and for all dogs in those pedigrees {{to be of the}} same breed, a distribution across twenty or more states, and the breed standard must be reviewed and approved by the AKC. Currently there are five <b>dogs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> AKC's Miscellaneous Class which are Dogue de Bordeaux, Redbone Coonhound, Irish Red and White Setter, Norwegian Buhund and Pyrenean Shepherd. Typical stays in that class are between one and three years, and the national club of the breed must have held seminars, shows and judges workshops prior to being fully recognised.|$|E
5|$|Labradors like to eat, {{and without}} proper {{exercise}} can become obese. Laziness is {{a contribution to}} this. Obesity is a serious condition and can be considered the number one nutritional problem with dogs. A study shows that at least 25% of <b>dogs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States are overweight. Therefore, Labradors must be properly exercised and stimulated. A healthy Labrador can do swimming wind sprints for two hours, and should keep a very slight hourglass waist and be fit and light, rather than fat or heavy-set. Obesity can exacerbate conditions such as hip dysplasia and joint problems, {{and can lead to}} secondary diseases, including diabetes. Osteoarthritis is very common in older, especially overweight, Labradors. A 14-year study covering 48 dogs by food manufacturer Purina showed that Labradors fed to maintain a lean body shape outlived those fed freely by around two years, emphasising the importance of not over-feeding. Labradors should be walked twice a day for at least half an hour.|$|E
5|$|Spotted hyenas {{will follow}} packs of African wild dogs {{in order to}} {{appropriate}} their kills. They will typically inspect areas where wild dogs have rested and eat any food remains they find. When approaching wild dogs at a kill, solitary hyenas will approach cautiously and attempt to take off {{with a piece of}} meat unnoticed, though they may be mobbed by the <b>dogs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> attempt. When operating in groups, spotted hyenas are more successful in pirating dog kills, though the dog's greater tendency to assist each other puts them at an advantage against spotted hyenas, who rarely work in unison. Cases of dogs scavenging from spotted hyenas are rare. Although wild dog packs can easily repel solitary hyenas, on the whole, {{the relationship between the two}} species is a one sided benefit for the hyenas, with wild dog densities being negatively correlated with high hyena populations.|$|E
