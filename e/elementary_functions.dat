25|$|The <b>elementary</b> <b>functions</b> are {{constructed}} by composing arithmetic operations, the exponential function (exp), the natural logarithm (log), trigonometric functions (sin, cos), and their inverses. The complexity of an elementary function {{is equivalent to}} that of its inverse, since all <b>elementary</b> <b>functions</b> are analytic and hence invertible by means of Newton's method. In particular, if either exp or log in the complex domain can be computed with some complexity, then that complexity is attainable for all other <b>elementary</b> <b>functions.</b>|$|E
