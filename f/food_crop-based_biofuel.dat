With increasing concerns over the sustainability of <b>food</b> <b>crop-based</b> <b>biofuels,</b> purpose-grown lignocellulosic biomass crops such as Miscanthus and short rotation coppice (SRC) willow have been promoted as more sustainable feedstocks {{for the production of}} heat and electricity {{as well as for the}} future production of liquid biofuels. With the introduction of the Energy Crops Scheme, land-use change (LUC) for lignocellulosic biomass crop production has become increasingly common in Britain in recent decades. However, there is limited understanding of the impact this has on soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks and limited predictability concerning the overall trajectory, magnitude and rate of SOC changes under a range of different conditions. Using a chronosequence of 93 biomass crop plantations in England and Wales, mainly of 1 to 14 years age, empirical models were developed to determine the short term trajectory of SOC stocks following LUC from arable and grassland to SRC willow and Miscanthus production. SOC stocks were calculated for each site using a fixed sampling depth of 30 cm and estimated changes were inferred by comparing with typical pre-change SOC stocks. These results indicate that only LUC from arable crops to SRC willow demonstrated an overall increase in SOC stocks, by an estimated 15. 3 ± 2. 2 t C ha- 1 (± 95...|$|R
40|$|Presented at the GLOBELICS 6 th International Conference 2008 22 - 24 September, Mexico City, Mexico. Biofuels are {{projected}} to play an increasingly {{important role in the}} gamut of sustainable energy options for the future. As countries such as the U. S. (corn ethanol), Brazil (sugarcane ethanol), Indonesia (oil palm ethanol), South Africa (maize, sugarcane) and others adopt and expand their biomass ethanol programs, many important questions have arisen in the media and elsewhere questioning the viability of biofuels. These articles have suggested that studies which had shown that biofuels would play a dominant role as an energy resource were wrong or exaggerated (Walsh 2008; Grunwald 2008). A review of assessments of the potential of corn ethanol reported that a positive net energy gain between the nonrenewable energy used to provide ethanol and the resulting energy from the fuel was obtained when ethanol co-products and the most recent data were included (Farrell et al. 2006). Another study has demonstrated that the net effect of the production of <b>food</b> <b>crop-based</b> <b>biofuels</b> through the clearing of carbon-rich habitats such as rainforests and savannas is to release more carbon dioxide than the reductions obtained by using biofuels (Fargione et al. 2008). It has also been reported that the diversion of existing crops or croplands into biofuels creates an increase in food prices, which further results in an accelerated rate of clearing forests and grasslands (Searchinger et al. 2008). Nevertheless, all three studies propose that cellulosic ethanol or bio-fuels derived from degraded crop land and waste biomass have the potential to reduce competition with food crops, minimize the destruction of habitats and reverse carbon debts that result from land clearing (Fargione et al. 2008; Farrell et al. 2006; Searchinger et al. 2008). Africa currently has a relatively low level of biofuel development and investment {{with the exception of a}} few countries such as South Africa (Dynes 2008). This situation presents a need for more information and research required to address policy options, land requirements, standards and investment opportunities on the continent (Arungu-Olende 2007). Many countries such as Ethiopia, Malawi, Nigeria and Uganda already produce sugarcane for sugar as well as some cash crops like oil palm which can be used as biofuels. However, their development as energy crops is constrained by the environmental problems and food production issues that take precedence as highlighted previously. Indeed, a preliminary content analysis (done by our group) of the newspaper coverage of biofuels around the world from May 2007 to May 2008 revealed that the majority of news articles from Africa displayed a greater emphasis on the food crisis than on the emerging potential for biofuels development. The objective of this paper is to analyze the currently dominant biofuels strategies and apply the principal elements of the concept of adaptive management to the selection, production and use of biomass ethanol in African countries. Given the difficulty of predicting the precise nature of the benefits and consequences of biomass ethanol to sustainable development, the adaptive management approach is pertinent as it emphasizes both substantive and procedural rationality. Substantive rationality is very specific, puts policy options on the table and tries to identify the quantifiable costs and benefits of the policy approach. Procedural rationality is the outcome of appropriate deliberation which does not yield a single decision point but guarantees that the policy decisions are made iteratively and that they are reversible (O'Neill, Holland, and Light 2008). It assists in the mitigation of unforeseen consequences that may disproportionately affect certain societal groups, particularly if they are not part of the decision making process. One implicit assumption that comes up in the discussion of biofuels is that all the stakeholders are primarily preoccupied by the energy crunch or by climate change. Some stakeholders are motivated by the economic profits from a new investment, others by jobs, others by environmental activism and a myriad other priorities, interests, preoccupations or lack thereof. In attempting to resolve the energy crisis sustainably, it is important to address such a system holistically, as a complex interaction of all the parts as opposed to adopting a reductive position such as linking the problem directly with the economy or with a purely ideological orientation. Furthermore, one individual or group‘s wellbeing in one way may ultimately be counterproductive for the whole system, thus reducing the range of options for future generations. As will be shown subsequently, these are all factors that must be taken into consideration in designing a biomass ethanol program...|$|R

In addition, it reduced pollution problem by treating the biomass in proper ways to prevent illegal burning. Hence, it is essential that Southeast Asia chart its direction clearly to create self-sufficient community by utilizing the biomass resources.

40|$|A global {{increase}} in the demand for <b>crop-based</b> <b>biofuels</b> may be met by cropland expansion, and could require the sacrifice of natural vegetation. Such land transformation alters the carbon and nitrogen cycles of the original system, and causes significant greenhouse-gas emissions, which should be considered when assessing the global warming performance of <b>crop-based</b> <b>biofuels.</b> As an indicator of this performance we propose the use of greenhouse-gas payback time (GPBT), that is, {{the number of years}} it takes before the greenhouse-gas savings due to displacing fossil fuels with biofuels equal the initial losses of carbon and nitrogen stocks from the original ecosystem. Spatially explicit global GPBTs were derived for biofuel production systems using five different feedstocks (corn, rapeseed, soybean, sugarcane and winter wheat), cultivated under no-input and high-input farm management. Overall, GPBTs were found to range between 1 and 162 years (95 % range, median: 19 years) with the longest GPBTs occurring in the tropics. Replacing no-input with high-input farming typically shortened the GPBTs by 45 to 79 %. Location of crop cultivation was identified as the primary factor driving variation in GPBTs.

This paper presents an analysis of these releases for US maize ethanol. Our analysis highlights the key role of market-mediated responses to biofuels mandates. Factoring these into our analysis reduces cropland conversion by 72 %. As a consequence the associated GHG release estimated in our framework is just 800 g CO 2 MJ - 1 y (27 g MJ- 1 for 30 years of ethanol production).

However, there is another distinct way energy markets can impact crop markets—many US international trade partners are reliant on the energy sector as a major source of income. Thus, energy market swings can translate into significant income movements for those countries, influencing their ability to purchase US agricultural products.

Whether deliberate or unintended, these socioeconomic consequences of increased demand for biomass and bioenergy need to be accounted for in a comprehensive assessment of biomass technologies. The aim of this chapter is not to provide a comprehensive overview of the full set of socio-economic effects of increased biomass use, given the multitude of existing bioenergy systems and the many ways in which they interact with and effect human welfare. 3 Rather, the aim is to cast some light over some of the most frequent claimed and debated benefits and detriments of a large scale employ- ment of bioenergy technologies: (1) its potential to increase employment and promote development, especially in rural areas, (2) the impact on agricultural com- modity prices and the effect this in turn has on food security and poverty, mainly in developing countries, and (3) the extent to which increased bioenergy demand has contributed to a global rush for land, having a negative impact on local livelihoods.

In bacterial-algal systems, there is the potential to produce energy by co-digesting the two types of biomass. We present an innovative approach to recover microalgal biomass via a two-step flocculation using bacterial biomass after the destabilisation of microalgae with conventional cationic polymer. A short solids retention time (SRT) enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR) system was combined with microalgal cultivation. Two different bacterial biomass removal strategies were assessed whereby bacterial biomass was collected from the solid-liquid separation after the anaerobic phase and after the aerobic phase. Microalgal recovery was tested by jar tests where three different chemical coagulants in coagulation-flocculation tests (AlCl 3, PDADMAC and Greenfloc 120) were assessed. Furthermore, jar tests were conducted to assess the microalgal biomass recovery by a two-step flocculation method, involving chemical coagulants in the first step and bacterial biomass used in the second step to enhance the flocculation. Up to 97 % of the microalgal biomass was recovered using 16 mg polymer/g algae and 0. 1 g algae/g bacterial biomass. Moreover, the energy recovery by the short-SRT EBPR system combined with microalgal cultivation was assessed via biomethane potential tests. Up to 560 ± 24 mL CH 4 /gVS methane yield was obtained by co-digesting bacterial biomass collected after the anaerobic phase and microalgal biomass. The energy recovery in terms of methane production obtained in the short-SRT EBPR system is about 40 % of the influent chemical energy...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), School of Economic Sciences, Washington State UniversityThis {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} three studies that estimate models for agricultural risk, production and consumption. Crop yield distributions are modeled and risks evaluated to make recommendations for insurance premiums for developing risk management tools. Crop supply for biofuels is estimated by incorporating crop yield and price risk. Consumer apple variety choice and demand are analyzed based on a large household-level dataset. The first study applies a nonparametric method to estimate bivariate yield distributions based on farm-level yield data of wheat and corn in Shandong Province and wheat and rice in the Yangtze River Delta area in China. The simulated yield distributions are {{used to evaluate the}} expected indemnity of one traditional and one hypothesized crop insurance program. Our results indicate that nonparametric methods are very flexible in describing the shapes of yield density functions to reveal local idiosyncrasies and correlation between two crops. The hypothesized two-crop insurance contract is affordable to farmers than traditional individual crop insurance contracts. The second study uses three models to estimate supply equations under output price and quantity uncertainty for major biofuel feedstock crops in Washington State. Farmers are assumed to be risk averse and maximize the expected utility of profit and uncertainty. Based on state, regional, and national data, we find low likelihood that Washington crop producers will become a major source of <b>crop-based</b> <b>biofuel</b> feedstocks in the foreseeable future. The third study uses household-level Nielson Homescan data to analyze consumer apple variety choices and demands with a two-step estimation model. This paper combines prices, household demographics, state dependence variables, as well as regional and seasonal effects to analyze household apple variety choices and purchases. We find that price and income {{play an important role in}} both the purchase and quantity decisions of a household. Household demographic characteristics such as age and presence of kids have different impacts on purchases by varieties, which can be explained by the internal attributes and uses/functions of specific apple varieties. Significant regional and seasonal effects are also found. School of Economic Sciences, Washington State Universit...|$|R
40|$|Agricultural {{production}} of liquid biofuels can have positive effects. It can decrease dependence {{on fossil fuels}} and increase farmers’ incomes. Agricultural {{production of}} mixed perennial biofuel crops may increase pollinator and avian richness. Most types of agricultural <b>crop-based</b> liquid <b>biofuel</b> production, however, {{have a negative effect}} on natural ecosystems and biodiversity. Comparisons of fossil fuels and liquid biofuels regarding their life cycle emissions of pollutants which are (eco) toxic or contribute to oxidizing smog, acidification or nutrification give mixed results. Fossil fuels often do better than biofuels as to emissions of acidifying and nutrifying substances, but often worse regarding ecotoxicity. A rapid increase in biofuel production can increase malnutrition due to its upward effect on food prices. Liquid biofuel lifecycles are linked to greater water consumption than their fossil fuel counterparts. Life cycle greenhouse gas emissions of liquid agricultural biofuels are currently often larger than those of their fossil fuel counterparts, when effects of land use on carbon stocks are included. An exception in this respect is current Brazilian sugarcane ethanol. When soil quality is to be maintained, there seems to be little scope to convert lignocellulosic harvest residues into liquid biofuels. Agricultural biofuels are much poorer converters of solar energy into usable energy than photovoltaic cells...|$|R
40|$|Biofuels for {{transport}} are a renewable {{source of energy}} that were once heralded {{as a solution to}} multiple problems associated with poor urban air quality, the overproduction of agricultural commodities, the energy security of the European Union (EU) and climate change. It was only after the Union had implemented an incentivizing framework of legal and political instruments for the production, trade and consumption of biofuels that the problems of weakening food security, environmental degradation and increasing greenhouse gases through land-use changes began to unfold. In other words, the difference between political aims for why biofuels are promoted and their consequences has grown – which is also recognized by the EU policy-makers. Therefore, the global networks of producing, trading and consuming biofuels may face a complete restructure if the European Commission accomplishes its pursuit to sideline <b>crop-based</b> <b>biofuels</b> after 2020. My aim with this dissertation is not only to trace the manifold evolutions of the instruments used by the Union to govern biofuels but also to reveal how this evolution has influenced the dynamics of biofuel development. Therefore, I study the ways the EU’s legal and political instruments of steering biofuels are coconstitutive with the globalized spaces of biofuel development. My analytical strategy can be outlined through three concepts. I use the term ‘assemblage’ to approach the operations of the loose entity of actors and non-human elements that are the constituents of multi-scalar and -sectorial biofuel development. ‘Topology’ refers to the spatiality of this European biofuel assemblage and its parts whose evolving relations are treated as the active constituents of space, instead of simply being located in space. I apply the concept of ‘nomosphere’ to characterize the framework of policies, laws and other instruments that the EU applies and construes while attempting to govern biofuels. Even though both the materials and methods vary in the independent articles, these three concepts characterize my analytical strategy that allows me to study law, policy and space associated with each other. The results of my examinations underscore the importance of the instruments of governance of the EU constituting and stabilizing the spaces of producing and, on the other hand, how topological ruptures in biofuel development have enforced the need to reform policies. This analysis maps the vast scope of actors that are influenced by the mechanism of EU biofuel governance and, what is more, shows how they are actively engaging in the Union’s institutional policy formulation. By examining the consequences of fast biofuel development that are spatially dislocated from the established spaces of producing, trading and consuming biofuels such as indirect land use changes, I unfold the processes not tackled by the instruments of the EU. Indeed, it is these spatially dislocated processes that have pushed the Commission construing a new type of governing biofuels: transferring the instruments of climate change mitigation to land-use policies. Although efficient in mitigating these dislocated consequences, these instruments have also created peculiar ontological scaffolding for governing biofuels. According to this mode of governance, the spatiality of biofuel development appears to be already determined and the agency that could dampen the negative consequences originating from land-use practices is treated as irrelevant...|$|R
40|$|The {{search for}} {{alternatives}} to fossil fuels is boosting interest in biodiesel production. Among the crops {{used to produce}} biodiesel, palm trees stand out due to their high productivity and positive energy balance. This work assesses life cycle emissions and the energy balance of biodiesel production from palm oil in Brazil. The results are compared through a meta-analysis to previous published studies: Wood and Corley (1991) [Wood BJ, Corley RH. The energy balance of oil palm cultivation. In: PORIM intl. palm oil conference agriculture; 1991. ], Malaysia; Yusoff and Hansen (2005) [Yusoff S. Hansen SB.

Applied Energy 2009; 86 :S 189 - 96], Malaysia. In our study, data for the agricultural phase, transport, and energy content of the products and co-products were obtained from previous assessments done in Brazil. The energy intensities and greenhouse gas emission factors {{were obtained from the}} Simapro 7. 1. 8. software and other authors. These factors were applied to the inputs and outputs listed in the selected studies to render them comparable. The energy balance for our study was 1 : 5. 37. In comparison the range for the other studies is between 1 : 3. 40 and 1 : 7. 78. Life cycle emissions determined in our assessment resulted in 1437 kg CO(2) e/ha, while our analysis based on the information provided by other authors resulted in 2406 kg CO(2) e/ha, on average. The Angarita et al. (2009) [Angarita EE, Lora EE, Costa RE, Torres EA. The energy balance in the palm oil-derived methyl ester (PME) life cycle for the cases in Brazil and Colombia. Renewable Energy 2009 : 34 : 2905 - 13] study does not report emissions. When compared to diesel on a energy basis, avoided emissions due to the use of biodiesel account for 80 g CO(2) e/MJ. Thus, avoided life Cycle emissions {{associated with the use of}} biodiesel yield a net reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. We also assessed the carbon balance between a palm tree plantation, including displaced emissions from diesel, and a natural ecosystem. Considering the carbon balance outcome plus life cycle emissions the payback time for a tropical forest is 39 years. The result published by Gibbs et al.

40|$|Recent {{increases}} in production of <b>crop-based</b> (or first-generation) <b>biofuels</b> have engendered increasing concerns over potential conflicts with food supplies and land protection, {{as well as}} disputes over greenhouse gas reductions. This has heightened {{a sense of urgency}} around the development of biofuels produced from non-food biomass (second-generation biofuels). This study reviews the economic potential and environmental implications of production of second-generation biofuels from a variety of various feedstocks. Although second-generation biofuels could significantly contribute to the future energy supply mix, cost is a major barrier to increasing commercial production in the near to medium term. Depending on various factors, the cost of second-generation (cellulosic) ethanol can be two to three times as high as the current price of gasoline on an energy equivalent basis. The cost of biodiesel produced from microalgae, a prospective feedstock, is many times higher than the current price of diesel. Policy instruments for increasing biofuels use, such as fiscal incentives, should be based on the relative merits of different types of biofuels.

40|$|This {{technical}} study {{focuses on}} the role of micro-organism genetic resources for agriculture and the influence of a changing climate. Agriculture is defined as <b>crop-based</b> <b>food</b> production for yield and quality. It excludes micro-organism genetic resources associated with livestock, fish and non-food-borne human pathogens. The study encompasses micro-organisms in five functional domains: soil inhabitants, plant and rhizosphere inhabitants, plant pathogens, biological control agents and food production systems. The scope of this study is vast {{as a consequence of the}} unrivalled diversity of micro-organism genetic resources for agriculture and the correspondingly huge variety of functions they perform, largely beneficial but also some harmful to agriculture. The study summarizes the role of micro-organism genetic resources for agriculture, provides examples demonstrating the potential influence of changes in climate on their performance, and describes their potential role in adapting agriculture to climate change and in mitigating changes in climate. While this study can only take preliminary steps towards detailing the complexity of the subject, the authors greatly appreciate the opportunity to increase awareness of micro- organism genetic resources for agriculture among the global community of decision-makers...|$|R
40|$|The {{supply side}} of the food {{security}} engine {{is the way we}} farm. The current engine of conventional tillage farming is faltering and needs to be replaced. This presentation will address supply side issues of agriculture to meet future agricultural demands for food and industry using the alternate no-till Conservation Agriculture (CA) paradigm (involving no-till farming with mulch soil cover and diversified cropping) that is able to raise productivity sustainably and efficiently, reduce inputs, regenerate degraded land, minimise soil erosion, and harness the flow of ecosystem services. CA is an ecosystems approach to farming capable of enhancing not only the economic and environmental performance of crop production and land management, but also promotes a mindset change for producing ‘more from less’, the key attitude towards sustainable production intensification. CA is now spreading globally in all continents {{at an annual rate of}} 10 Mha and covers some 157 Mha of cropland. Today global agriculture produces enough food to feed three times the current population of 7. 21 billion. In 1976, when the world population was 4. 15 billion, world food production far exceeded the amount necessary to feed that population. However, our urban and industrialised lifestyle leads to wastage of food of some 30 %- 40 %, as well as waste of enormous amount of energy and protein while transforming <b>crop-based</b> <b>food</b> into animal-derived food; we have a higher proportion of people than ever before who are obese; we continue to degrade our ecosystems including much of our agricultural land of which some 400 Mha is reported to be abandoned due to severe soil and land degradation; and yields of staple cereals appear to have stagnated. These are signs of unsustainability at the structural level in the society, and it is at the structural level, for both supply side and demand side, that we need transformed mind sets about production, consumption and distribution. CA not only provides the possibility of increased crop yields for the low input smallholder farmer, it also provides a pro-poor rural and agricultural development model to support agricultural intensification in an affordable manner. For the high output farmer, it offers greater efficiency (productivity) and profit, resilience and stewardship. For farming anywhere, it addresses the root causes of agricultural land degradation, sub-optimal ecological crop and land potentials or yield ceilings, and poor crop phenotypic expressions or yield gaps. As national economies expand and diversify, more people become integrated into the economy and are able to access food. However, for those whose livelihoods continue to depend on agriculture to feed themselves and the rest of the world population, the challenge is for agriculture to produce the needed food and raw material for industry with minimum harm to the environment and the society, and to produce it with maximum efficiency and resilience against abiotic and biotic stresses, including those arising from climate change. There is growing empirical and scientific evidence worldwide that the future global supplies of food and agricultural raw materials can be assured sustainably at much lower environmental and economic cost by shifting away from conventional tillage-based food and agriculture systems to no-till CA-based food and agriculture systems. To achieve this goal will require effective national and global policy and institutional support (including research and education) ...|$|R
