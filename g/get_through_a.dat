The concept art, {{as well as}} cutscenes and {{character}} profiles, can be viewed in a Collection Room, while music can be set to play in any level, mission, or boss. The game also features two forms of online leaderboards: [...] "Ranking Attack", which challenges players to obtain the best time and score on each level, and [...] "30 Second Trial", which challenges players {{to see how far}} they can <b>get</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> level in 30 seconds. The original 1991 Sonic the Hedgehog game can be unlocked in the console versions of the game.|$|E
500|$|The match {{attracted}} fervent debate amongst journalists, pundits {{and football}} players alike. Former referee Jeff Winter defended Riley's performance and described fixtures between Manchester United and Arsenal as [...] "impossible" [...] to manage. Premier League refereeing chief Keith Hackett added: [...] "We {{know this is}} one of the tough encounters of the season. Mike clearly had a game plan to try not to suppress the match. He wanted it to breathe and perhaps went in with the intention of getting through the game without having to dismiss any players. In the back of his mind was trying to <b>get</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> game without having a blow-up and I think Mike did extremely well to keep a lid on things." ...|$|E
500|$|Roguelikes {{generally}} have complex interacting systems {{that allow the}} player to complete certain goals in multiple ways, creating emergent gameplay. For example, to <b>get</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> locked door, the player may attempt to pick the lock, kick it down, burn down the door, or even tunnel around it, depending on their current situation and inventory. A common phrase associated with NetHack is [...] "The Dev Team Thinks of Everything" [...] in that the developers seem to have anticipated every possible combination of actions that a player may attempt to try in their gameplay strategy, such as using gloves to protect one's character while wielding the corpse of a cockatrice as a weapon to petrify enemies by its touch.|$|E

500|$|Hewson {{has served}} as at least partial {{inspiration}} for many Bono-authored U2 songs, {{going back to the}} track [...] "Another Time, Another Place" [...] from their 1980 début album Boy. She helped Bono <b>get</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> bad period of writer's block during the lead-up to the 1983 War album, particularly in the composition of the lyrics to [...] "Sunday Bloody Sunday". She inspired the personal themes in [...] "New Year's Day", from the same record. That album and the accompanying War Tour brought financial success to the band, and Bono and Hewson moved into a three-level, three-room Martello tower in Bray. The group's 1984 song [...] "Promenade" [...] reflects both that location and the spiritual aspects of his desire for her.|$|E
500|$|In 2000, Dunst {{starred in}} the comedy Bring It On as Torrance Shipman, the captain of a cheerleading squad. The film {{generated}} mostly positive reviews, with many critics reserving praise for her performance. In his review, A. O. Scott called her [...] "a terrific comic actress, largely because of her great expressive range, and the nimbleness with which she can shift from anxiety to aggression to genuine hurt." [...] Charles Taylor of Salon noted that [...] "among contemporary teenage actresses, Dunst has become the sunniest imaginable parodist", even though he thought the film had failed to provide her with as good a role as she had either in Dick or in The Virgin Suicides. Jessica Winter from The Village Voice complimented Dunst, stating that her performance was [...] "as sprightly and knowingly daft as her turn in Dick" [...] and commenting that [...] " [...] provides the only major element of Bring It On that plays as tweaking parody rather than slick, strident, body-slam churlishness." [...] Peter Stack of the San Francisco Chronicle, despite giving the film an unfavorable review, commended Dunst for her willingness [...] "to be as silly and cloyingly agreeable {{as it takes to}} <b>get</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> slapdash film." ...|$|E
500|$|Many {{parts of}} the canyon had {{suffered}} storms. In February 1884, a storm hit. The train was delayed and the canyon walls brought boulders crashing down on the rails. On February 3, the train was unable to <b>get</b> <b>through.</b> <b>A</b> few days later, the wires were down. The train from Colton to San Diego could not get through. Disaster was averted because a local resident, Charlie Howell, hurried up the tracks from his family homestead near Willow Glen and managed to stop the train. [...] A series of devastating washouts on the section through Temecula Canyon occurred amid heavy rain storms that flooded the area starting on February 16, 1884, just {{six months after the}} first trains operated the entire route between San Diego and San Bernardino. [...] The storms brought more than [...] of rain in a four-week period. [...] Two thirds of the mainline through the canyon were washed out with ties seen floating as far as [...] away in the ocean. [...] Temporary track repairs were made after the first storms, but later in the month, additional rains and flooding washed out the entire route through the canyon. [...] Repairs were estimated at nearly $320,000, a figure that could not be recouped effectively.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics. HitFix Senior Editor Alan Sepinwall wrote, [...] "It wasn't a perfect episode, mainly because Vivian remains a fairly muddled, bratty villain, and because I don't {{feel like the}} show ever really used Ray Wise to his full potential. But {{so much of it}} was so satisfying, both emotionally and comedically, that, until Vivian called Chuck during the rehearsal dinner, I actually thought to myself, 'You know, this would be a pretty damn good finale in and of itself. Ryan McGee of The A.V. Club rated the episode a B on an A+ to F scale. McGee wrote, [...] "The last act was fairly phenomenal, but we had to <b>get</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> lot of troubling material in order to achieve true liftoff on the hour. With so many loose ends to wrap up, the hour felt overstuffed: the impending wedding, The Norseman, Agent X, Morgan's first field assignment...I mean, that's a lot of stuff. And it doesn't help that Vivian Volkoff {{is at the center of}} three of those things, and inserted herself into the fourth at the last moment. And in thinking about the clunkiness of aspects of this episode, I thought about the clunkiness of this latter half of the season as a whole." [...] Eric Goldman of IGN gave this episode a score of 8.5 out of 10, writing that it was a mistake not to include Timothy Dalton as Alexei Volkoff after the plot twists of the previous episode. Sarah Stegall of SFScope wrote, [...] "Chuck is killing me by inches. So close, so close to the Chuck/Sarah wedding, but things keep going wrong." ...|$|E

2500|$|Razor Smith (William Charles Smith; 4 October 1877, Oxford, Oxfordshire – 15 July 1946, Bermondsey, London) was a Surrey slow bowler. Nicknamed [...] "Razor" [...] {{because of}} his extreme thinness, Smith was prone to serious injury and could rarely <b>get</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> full season's cricket, but when sound, could command the sharpest off-break among bowlers of his day.

The Asian-inspired costumes of the film were intended to evoke the romanticism of the era, and one of the centrepieces of the film's costuming is a red chrysanthemum-printed Chinese cheongsam or qipao that was made for Nicole Kidman's character. [...] The film received an Academy Award nomination for Best Costume Design.|$|E

2500|$|Townsend first {{emerged as}} a leg break bowler from Clifton College {{at the age of}} 16 in 1893. He took 21 wickets in four games and showed, despite his very slight build, the ability to <b>get</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> lot of bowling and spin the ball prodigiously from leg. In one innings against Middlesex, he bowled 70 five-ball overs (equivalent to 58 six-ball overs). [...] In that season, his county's wicket-keeper, William Brain, {{completed}} the only instance in first-class cricket of a hat-trick of stumpings, taken off Townsend's bowling. The following year, Townsend’s record was modest though Grace gave him a good deal of bowling on soft pitches, and he was seen as not physically strong enough for county cricket by most critics of the day.|$|E
2500|$|The {{committee}} {{seized upon}} the concept {{as a potential}} {{solution to the problem}} of bomber detection and the fear that the bomber will always <b>get</b> <b>through.</b> <b>A</b> second memo with more detailed calculations arrived in February and was shown to the Air Member for Supply and Research, Hugh Dowding. He was impressed with the concept, but wanted a practical demonstration. This was carried out on 26 February 1935, now known as the Daventry Experiment, which clearly indicated the presence of a nearby aircraft. Dowding immediately released funding for development. By the summer of 1935 the system, code-named [...] "RDF", was able to detect bomber-sized targets at ranges of [...] Plans were made to build a chain of RDF stations at about [...] intervals along the English coast in a system called Chain Home (CH).|$|E
2500|$|After {{his release}} on 3 July, Lays had to undergo the ritual humiliation {{the public was}} {{imposing}} on the [...] "Terrorist actors": {{they were forced to}} sing the anti-Jacobin hymn [...] "Le Réveil du Peuple", which had just been set to music by a tenor from the Théâtre Feydeau, Pierre Gaveaux, and which seemed destined to replace the Marseillaise as the main Republican anthem. Antoine Trial, a colleague of Gaveaux from the Opéra-Comique who was then in his sixties, had been forced to sing the new hymn kneeling on stage to boos, whistles and jeers from the audience, and had never recovered from the experience, eventually taking his own life with poison. Quéruel writes Lays managed to avoid making his return to the stage in Iphigénie en Tauride, in which his character Oreste sang lines which were a little too suggestive coming from an ex-"Terrorist": [...] "J'ai trahi l'amitié, j'ai trahi la nature/Des plus noirs attentats, j'ai comblé la mesure" [...] ("I have betrayed friendship, betrayed Nature/I have gone to the extreme of blackest deeds"). On the other hand, according to the memoirs of Count , it was indeed in the role of Oreste that Lays sought to return to the stage. However, the implacable hostility of the audience prevented him from singing a single note and, after an hour of fruitless efforts, he eventually had to be replaced by an understudy. His actual reappearance then took place in a revival of Sacchini's Œdipe à Colone, in which he sang the far less controversial character of King Theseus. Even then, things did not go smoothly: the audience booed and protested throughout the performance, although this time he was not prevented from completing it. At the end, the leading tenor Étienne Lainez returned onto the proscenium to sing, as usual, Le Réveil du Peuple, but he was shouted down and forced to take refuge in the wings. Lays was rowdily summoned back instead. Lainez accompanied his colleague on stage, hoping they would be allowed to sing together, but he was once more driven off by the furious audience, and Lays had to perform solo. No sooner had he managed to <b>get</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> couple of verses, however, than he too was driven off by booing, because the audience thought he was unworthy of the words he was singing. The unfortunate Lainez had to retake the stage for a third time to finish the performance. By the end of September, nevertheless, enthusiasm for such post-Revolutionary reprisals had abated and Lays was able to make a triumphant return as the Genius of Fire in Salieri's Tarare, his debut in the role.|$|E
