25|$|An {{active area}} of {{research}} is the univalent foundations and related to it homotopy type theory. Here, sets may be defined as certain kinds of types, with universal properties of sets arising from higher inductive types. Principles such as the axiom of choice and {{the law of the}} excluded middle appear in a spectrum of different forms, some of which can be proven, others which correspond to the classical notions; this allows <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>detailed</b> <b>discussion</b> of the effect of these axioms on mathematics.|$|E

500|$|By {{the time}} Raeder met with Hitler <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>detailed</b> <b>discussion</b> of naval {{strategy}} in April 1942, {{the usefulness of}} aircraft carriers in modern naval warfare had been amply demonstrated. British carriers had crippled the Italian fleet at Taranto in November 1940, critically damaged the [...] in May 1941 and prevented battleship [...] from attacking two convoys bound for Russia in March 1942. In addition, a Japanese carrier raid on Pearl Harbor had devastated the American battle fleet in December 1941. Raeder, anxious to secure air protection for the Kriegsmarines heavier surface units, informed Hitler that Graf Zeppelin could be finished in about a year, with another six months required for sea trials and flight training. On 13 May 1942, with Hitler's authorization, the German Naval Supreme Command ordered work resumed on the carrier.|$|E

2500|$|While the SA {{construct}} {{has been}} widely researched, the multivariate nature of SA poses a considerable challenge to its quantification and measurement (<b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>detailed</b> <b>discussion</b> on SA measurement, see Endsley & Garland, 2000; Fracker, 1991a; 1991b). In general, techniques vary in terms of direct measurement of SA (e.g., objective real-time probes or subjective questionnaires assessing perceived SA) or methods that infer SA based on operator behavior or performance. Direct measures are typically considered to be [...] "product-oriented" [...] in that these techniques assess an SA outcome; inferred measures {{are considered to be}} [...] "process-oriented," [...] focusing on the underlying processes or mechanisms required to achieve SA (Graham & Matthews, 2000). These SA measurement approaches are further described next.|$|E
2500|$|Tetradia: Sometimes 4 total lunar eclipses {{occur in}} a row with {{intervals}} of 6 lunations (semester), and {{this is called a}} tetrad. Giovanni Schiaparelli noticed that there are eras when such tetrads occur comparatively frequently, interrupted by eras when they are rare. [...] This variation takes about 6 centuries. Antonie Pannekoek (1951) offered an explanation for this phenomenon and found a period of 591 years. [...] Van den Bergh (1954) from Theodor von Oppolzer's Canon der Finsternisse found a period of 586 years. This happens to be an eclipse cycle; see Meeus [...] (1997). [...] Recently Tudor Hughes explained the variation from secular changes in the eccentricity of the Earth's orbit: the period for occurrence of tetrads is variable and currently is about 565 years; see Meeus III (2004) <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>detailed</b> <b>discussion.</b>|$|E
