500|$|Album opener [...] "Bullshittin'" [...] was {{produced}} by Three 6 Mafia's Juicy J, and features a murky bassline with a calming vibe. The track is inspired {{by the sound of}} southern hip hop. [...] "Cookie Coma" [...] {{was produced}} by The Alchemist, and contains a jazzy beat, with lush horns and upright bass. The style of production is inspired by boom bap production, with prominent sounding drums. Hodgy ponders his own morality on the track, with self-reflective lines such as [...] "I’m too legit for life, <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>get</b> a grip and die, Fuckin’ take a trip and fly, and never come down".|$|E
500|$|The {{lyrics of}} the tracks on She Wolf, {{according}} to Shakira, have been written from a [...] "very feminine perspective". She attributed this to her growing maturity, noting [...] "I think maybe because I feel more like a woman today". Many of the songs focus on [...] "emotions that a woman experiments when you're in love or out of love— jealousy, fantasies, daydreams", which the singer said were based on her conversations with girlfriends who are [...] "struggling with their own romantic lives". This issue is prominently covered in the track [...] "Men in This Town", in which Shakira sings {{about the lack of}} eligible bachelors in Los Angeles. The song contains references to American actors Angelina Jolie and Matt Damon, the latter of whom Shakira knows personally, and popular destinations like the SkyBar. [...] Jocelyn Vena from MTV commented that [...] "Shakira wasn't afraid to get a little wacky {{when it came to the}} lyrics on She Wolf". In an interview with Jim Cantiello, the singer was asked for the reason behind lyrics like [...] "I'm so happy <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>get</b> sued" [...] (in the track [...] "Long Time"), to which Shakira replied [...] "Maybe it rhymed. It's hard to explain your own lyrics, you know". In [...] "Mon Amour", she wishes that her ex-boyfriend and his new girlfriend have a terrible vacation in Paris and are eaten alive by [...] "French fleas". Other themes the album touches upon include night-life, sex, and seduction, in songs like [...] "Did It Again" [...] and [...] "Spy". Rolling Stone critic Jody Rosen labelled the latter [...] "a meditation on masturbation".|$|E

[...] "What have I done that made some wonderfully deluded people think that <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>get</b> the [...] for lifetime achievement in writing young adult fiction?"

2500|$|A {{few months}} later, {{a few people}} did muster the courage to start singing at an {{intermission}} in a Shabbos farbrengen a less overt song that implied that the Rebbe was the messiah. Within a few seconds the Rebbe heard it and immediately became very grave and said: [...] "Really, <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>get</b> up and leave [...] Even if some people consider it is not respectful that I need to , I don’t need to reckon with the views of a small number when [...] {{is the opposite of}} reality. However, first of all, it will unfortunately not help anyway. Secondly, it will disrupt the shevet achim gam yachad , for if I were to leave, others will leave, too." ...|$|E
2500|$|Boxing {{has been}} a part of Mayweather's life since his {{childhood}} and he never seriously considered any other profession. [...] "I think my grandmother saw my potential first," [...] he said. [...] "When I was young, I told her, 'I think <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>get</b> a job.' She said, 'No, just keep boxing.'" [...] During the 1980s, Mayweather lived in the Hiram Square neighborhood of New Brunswick, New Jersey, where his mother had relatives. He later said, [...] "When I was about eight or nine, I lived in New Jersey with my mother and we were seven deep in one bedroom and sometimes we didn't have electricity. When people see what I have now, they have no idea of where I came from and how I didn't have anything growing up." ...|$|E

2500|$|The BBC {{needs to}} {{know there is a}} degree of dissatisfaction among the public. I think people want to see that EastEnders is {{populated}} by many different ethnic groups. Black people in real life run businesses, fall in and out of love, have fascinating and exciting lives. So why can't we in EastEnders. We are not all losers or nobodies so why can't the BBC show that?...I really felt so ineffectual as a character because I had nothing to get my teeth into - there were no great dramatic scenes or relationships. My character was never given anything meaningful to say and that was such a wasted opportunity. My son said <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>get</b> out of EastEnders because it wasn't doing me any good as an actress or as a black woman...I have got to speak out so that things can change." ...|$|E
