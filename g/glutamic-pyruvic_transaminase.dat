5000|$|Alanine {{transaminase}} (ALT) is a transaminase enzyme (...) [...] It is {{also called}} alanine aminotransferase (ALAT) and was formerly called serum glutamate-pyruvate transaminase (SGPT) or serum <b>glutamic-pyruvic</b> <b>transaminase</b> (SGPT) and was first characterized {{in the mid-1950s}} by Arthur Karmen and colleagues. ALT is found in plasma and in various body tissues, but is most common in the liver. It catalyzes the {{two parts of the}} alanine cycle. Serum ALT level, serum AST (aspartate transaminase) level, and their ratio (AST/ALT ratio) are commonly measured clinically as biomarkers for liver health. The tests are part of blood panels.|$|E
50|$|The {{transaminase}} enzymes {{are important}} {{in the production of}} various amino acids, and measuring the concentrations of various transaminases in the blood is important in the diagnosing and tracking many diseases. Transaminases require the coenzyme pyridoxal-phosphate, which is converted into pyridoxamine in {{the first phase of the}} reaction, when an amino acid is converted into a keto acid. Enzyme-bound pyridoxamine in turn reacts with pyruvate, oxaloacetate, or alpha-ketoglutarate, giving alanine, aspartic acid, or glutamic acid, respectively. Many transamination reactions occur in tissues, catalysed by transaminases specific for a particular amino/keto acid pair. The reactions are readily reversible, the direction being determined by which of the reactants are in excess. The specific enzymes are named from one of the reactant pairs, for example; the reaction between glutamic acid and pyruvic acid to make alpha ketoglutaric acid and alanine is called <b>glutamic-pyruvic</b> <b>transaminase</b> or GPT for short.|$|E

University of Alaska Fairbanks, 1983 Blood from 151 {{grizzly bears}} (Ursus arctos) {{captured}} between 1973 and 1982 in the Brooks Range, Alaska, and the Alaska Range was examined for 7 hanatological, 24 serum chemistry, and 6 protein electrophoretic determinations. Differences in these characteristics between samples collected one hour apart indicate {{a response to}} stress during capture. Location differences in leukocyte count, erythrocyte count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and cortisol suggest that Alaska Range bears were more stressed by capturing than Brooks Range bears. Sodium, creatinine, and urea nitrogen were negatively correlated with capture date, suggesting varied diet reinstatement and regained renal function as time from den emergence increased. Calcium, phosphorous, and alkaline phosphatase were negatively correlated with age, reflecting increased osteoblast activity and bone formation in young bears.

40|$|Blood {{fibrinogen}} concentrations and <b>glutamic–pyruvic</b> <b>transaminase</b> {{activities of}} 66 adult cancer inpatients (aged 22 – 70 years) were determined {{both before and}} after one or two chemotherapy regimens. The percentage of hepatoma patients with abnormal blood fibrinogen levels ( 6. 0 g/l) was higher (64. 3 % of 14 patients) than that in other cancer categories (19. 2 % of 52 patients). The mean blood fibrinogen concentrations of male (3. 5 g/l) and female (4. 5 g/l) cancer patients were higher than those previously reported for healthy humans (2. 8 and 2. 9 g/l, respectively). After chemotherapy, blood fibrinogen concentrations decreased in patients whose primary tumours were surgically removed (from 4. 8 to 3. 2 g/l) but increased (from 3. 0 to 4. 8 g/l) in those who did not undergo surgery. <b>Glutamic–pyruvic</b> <b>transaminase</b> activities {{did not appear to be}} related to blood fibrinogen levels.

40|$|Objective(s) :To {{clarify the}} {{protective}} effects of Cichorium glandulosum (CG) extracts on thioacetamide (TAA) -induced rat hepatic fibrosis. Materials and Methods: The dry roots of CG were smashed and percolated with 95 % ethanol, and the residual was prepared into petroleum ether extract (CG-V), ethyl acetate extract (CG-VI) and n-butyl alcohol extract (CG-VII). Thirty-six Wistar rats were randomly divided into a normal group, a model group, a CG-V group (15 mg/kg), a CG-VI group (3 mg/kg), a CG-VII group (6 mg/kg) {{and a positive}} drug group (silibinin capsule, 8 mg/kg). Organ indices and serum levels of glutamic-oxaloacetic and <b>glutamic-pyruvic</b> <b>transaminases</b> of intragastrically administered rats were obtained.

40|$|Biochemical {{studies have}} been made on liver tissue and blood from ducklings and various breeds of {{chickens}} maintained on standard rations containing 0 · 5 ppm of aflatoxin B₁. The results obtained from these birds were compared with those from birds {{of the same age}} maintained on groundnut-free mashes. Of the various breeds of chickens studied, only New Hampshires {{have been found to be}} susceptible to the effects of this level of aflatoxin. In the livers of affected chickens and ducklings a marked decrease in the activity of certain mitochondrial dehydrogenases and enzymes of the electron transfer chains or oxidative phosphorylation mechanisms is apparent. Mild to moderate anaemia, severe hypo-proteinaemia and grossly abnormal plasma protein electrophoretograms are presented by affected birds. It is believed that the suppression of protein synthesis observed and affecting the albumin fraction in particular, is due to a lowered rate of ATP synthesis consequent to mitochondrial injury. An increase in the activity of certain plasma enzymes, notably those of lactic dehydrogenase, aldolase and glutamic-oxalacetic- or <b>glutamic-pyruvic</b> <b>transaminases,</b> is also seen in these birds. This increase in the activity of plasma enzymes can be correlated with the severe hepatic lesions. The use of these various studies in the diagnosis of this condition, before hepatic lesions are evident, has been suggested. The ability of affected birds on rations containing 0 · 5 ppm of aflatoxin to recover rapidly when placed on toxin free rations is noted. Aflatoxin at these levels appears to have no cumulative effects, but no resistance is built up to its actions by tissues of birds exposed to it for long periods. Susceptible birds revealed no evidence of aflatoxicosis after prolonged feeding of dairy or poultry products obtained from cows or fowls kept on highly toxic rations. From the practical point of view there seems to be little danger inherent in the dietary use of such essential foods. The articles have been scanned in colour with a HP Scanjet 5590; 300 dpi.

40|$|Este trabalho foi conduzido a fim de avaliar o crescimento e metabolismo de jundiás alimentados com concentrados proteicos de farelos de girassol e crambe como substitutos de fonte protéica de origem vegetal, em 25 e 50 % da proteína. O trabalho foi dividido em duas fases distintas. A primeira consistia na obtenção e caracterização dos concentrados proteicos dos farelos de girassol e crambe utilizando-se metodologia de concentração através do pH isoelétrico (SMITH et al., 1946), com modificações. Obtiveram-se valores de 51, 42 e 50, 37 % de proteína bruta e rendimento de 48, 30 e 50, 32 %, respectivamente. Em relação ao perfil de aminoácidos, a concentração protéica no farelo de crambe elevou os teores de lisina e metionina em 50, 29 e 122, 00 %, respectivamente. No concentrado proteico de girassol houve aumento de 41, 5 e 186 %. Na segunda fase foi conduzido o ensaio biológico durante 52 dias, em sistema de recirculação de água. Foram utilizados 300 jundiás com peso médio inicial de 14, 590, 18 g, esses animais foram alojados em 15 unidades experimentais de 280 L de volume útil cada. A densidade de estocagem inicial foi de 1, 04 g de peixe/L de água. Foram avaliados dois níveis (25 e 50 %) de substituição parcial da proteína advinda da farinha de carne e ossos suína pelos concentrados proteicos em questão. Ao final do período {{experimental}} não houve diferença estatística para peso (P). A conversão alimentar aparente (CAA) foi maior nas dietas Controle e CPFG- 25 % (P 0, 05) para taxa de crescimento específico (TCE), ganho de peso relativo (GPR), ganho de peso diário (GPD). Em relação ao fator de condição (FC), os maiores valores foram encontrados na dieta CPFG- 25 %. Não houve diferença estatística (P> 0, 05) no teor de matéria seca, proteína e proteína bruta total depositada (PBTD) na carcaça dos animais submetidos às distintas dietas. Foi encontrado maior teor de lipídeos e gordura total depositada (GTD) na dieta CPFG- 50 %. Para rendimento de carcaça (RC) e índices digestivos não houve significativa entre as dietas experimentais. As atividades das enzimas digestivas tripsina e quimotripsina não apresentaram diferenças estatísticas nas dietas testadas. Não houve diferença significativa para nenhum dos parâmetros sanguíneos analisados (glicose, proteínas totais circulantes, albumina, colesterol e triglicerídeos). Os animais da dieta CPFG- 25 % apresentaram maior estoque de glicogênio hepático (p 0. 05) {{for specific}} growth rate (SGR), relative weight gain (RWG) e {{average daily gain}} (ADG).

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{performed}} to investigate the roles of anterior intestine in the postprandial glucose homeostasis of the omnivorous Genetically Improved Farmed Tilapia (GIFT). Sub-adult fish (about 173  g) were sampled at 0, 1, 3, 8 and 24  h post feeding (HPF) after 36  h of food deprivation, and {{the time course of}} changes in intestinal glucose transport, glycolysis, glycogenesis and gluconeogenesis at the transcription and enzyme activity level, as well as plasma glucose contents, were analyzed. Compared with 0  HPF (fasting for 36  h), the mRNA levels of both ATP-dependent sodium/glucose cotransporter 1 and facilitated glucose transporter 2 increased during 1 - 3  HPF, decreased at 8  HPF and then leveled off. These results indicated that intestinal uptake of glucose and its transport across the intestine to blood mainly occurred during 1 - 3  HPF, which subsequently resulted in the increase of plasma glucose level at the same time. Intestinal glycolysis was stimulated during 1 - 3  HPF, while glucose storage as glycogen was induced during 3 - 8  HPF. Unexpectedly, intestinal gluconeogenesis (IGNG) was also strongly induced during 1 - 3  HPF at the state of nutrient assimilation. The mRNA abundance and enzyme activities of <b>glutamic-pyruvic</b> and glutamic-oxaloacetic <b>transaminases</b> increased during 1 - 3  HPF, suggesting that the precursors of IGNG might originate from some amino acids. Taken together, it was concluded that the anterior intestine {{played an important role in}} the regulation of postprandial glucose homeostasis in omnivorous tilapia, as it represented significant glycolytic potential and glucose storage. It was interesting that postprandial IGNG was stimulated by feeding temporarily, and its biological significance remains to be elucidated in fish...|$|R

40|$|Foi estudado o LCR de 45 cadáveres, sendo os resultados considerados em função do tempo decorrido entre o momento da morte e a colheita do LCR (TOC). Obedecendo a esse critério os casos foram assim grupados: 1) aqueles com TOC até 4 horas; 2) aqueles com TOC de 4 a 8 horas; 3) aqueles com TOC de 8 horas ou mais. Com o aumento do TOC a presença de hemácias no LCR de cadáveres se torna mais freqüente e mais intensa. A mistura de sangue ao LCR prejudica a avaliação das modificações cadavéricas de outros componentes do LCR, {{conforme}} foi demonstrado para as concentrações de cloretos glicose e proteínas totais, para o perfil protêico e para a atividade de transaminases. Assim sendo, para avaliar as modificações da composição do LCR próprias ao post-mortem devem ser considerados apenas os casos com menos de 1000 hemácias/mm³. O número normal de leucócitos foi proporcionalmente mais comum nas amostras provenientes de cadáveres cujo TOC era igual ou superior a 8 horas. A pleocitose foi observada com mais freqüência que o número normal de leucócitos, sendo mais comumente ligeira ou discreta. Quantidades superiores a 50 leucócitos/mm³ foram observadas geralmente em casos relativos a pacientes que faleceram na vigência de processos infecciosos agudos. As concentrações de cloretos e de glicose no LCR tendem a cair no postmortem e as diminuições mostraram-se, em média, tanto mais intensas quanto maior o TOC. A hipoglicorraquia foi, em média mais acentuada nos casos com pleoeitose mais intensa. A concentração de uréia tende a elevar-se de modo precoce, não tendo sido encontradas médias significativamente diversas em função do TOC. A atividade de TGO tende a elevar-se no post-mortem sendo esta elevação, em média, mais nítida a partir do grupo de casos com TOC de 4 até 8 horas. Ocorre também tendência a aumento da atividade de TGP; esta se mostrou menos intensa que a de TGO e, em média, foi mais nítida a partir do grupo de casos com TOC de 8 horas ou mais. A hiperproteinorraquia foi comum e mostrou, em média, tendência a acentuar-se com o aumento do TOC. O perfil protêico foi, geralmente, de tipo "misto", com aumento das globulinas alfa e/ou gama, compensado por queda do teor albumínico. O aumento dessas globulinas foi mais freqüente nos casos em que o óbito ocorreu na vigência de processos infecciosos. Nos casos com menos de 1000 hemácias/mm³ as modificações do perfil protêico, embora do mesmo tipo, eram menos acentuadas; em conjunto, houve predomínio das globulinas, especialmente das dos grupos alfa e gama. Em função do TOC foram verificadas discretas modificações do perfil protêico: com o aumento do TOC tendia a ser maior a participação da globulina gama e menor a da globulina beta. Os aspectos da composição do LCR aqui analisados permitem concluir que, 4 horas após a morte, já se delineiam modificações que caracterizam o LCR no post-mortem, sendo mais nítidas as relacionadas com o número de leucócitos e às concentrações de uréia, cloretos e glicose. Cerebrospinal fluid examination {{was carried}} out in 45 corpes, the results being related to the time elapsed from death till the sample's collection (TOC). The cases were distributed in three groups: 1 — cases with TOC till four hours; 2 — cases with TOC from four till eight hours; 3 — cases with TOC of eight hours or more. The CSF samples were submitted to investigations concerning to the cytology, the concentrations of chlorides, glycosis, urea and total proteins, the protein profile and the activities of glutamic-oxalacetic (GOT) and <b>glutamic-pyruvic</b> (GPT) <b>transaminases.</b> It was found that the presence of red blood cells became more frequent and that the number of hematiae tended to be higher with the increase of the TOC. The number of red blood cells in the sample indicates the degree of CSF and blood mixture, the evaluation of data proper to CSF composition being impaired by mixture. So, the evaluation of the changes that may be considered proper to the CSF in the post-mortem {{was carried out}} only in the samples presenting no more then 1, 000 hematiae per mml. Normal white cells number was proportionally more common in the third group of cases. Pleocytosis was more frequently found than normal cell count. It was slight or discrete in most of the cases. More than 50 white cells per mml were found in the samples collected from cases in which the patients had died in the course of acute infections. Low concentrations of chloride and glycosis were found in most of the cases and they tended to be lower with the increase of TOC. Hipoglycorrhachia was found to be more intense in the cases with pleocytosis. The concentration of urea was high in most of the cases; the increase of urea contents was at the same range in the three groups of cases considered. High GOT and GPT activities were found in several cases and the TOC appeared to influence the increase of these activities. This influence was more conspicuous in the last group only for GPT. Total protein concentrations above normal were frequent. They tended to be more conspicuously elevated with the increasing of TOC. The protein profiles were marked by the inversion of albumin/globulins ratio. They tended to be of the mixed type, with increase in the alpha and/or gamma globulins participation. The gamma globulin increase was more frequently observed. The increase of these globulin fractions was more conspicuous in the cases refering to patients who died during infectious diseases. An increase of the beta globulin fraction was observed in four cases: in two the death occurred in the course of hepatic cyrrhosis and, in two, of neoplasies. The influence of TOC on the protein profile changes was discrete: with the increase of the TOC the participation of gamma globulin increased and that of beta globulin decreased. The aspects of CSF composition here considered allow the conclusion that many of the changes are delineated during the first 4 hours after death, being more conspicuous those related to cell contents and chloride, glycosis and urea concentrations...|$|R

Lead increased, although not significantly, the clearance of DMN from blood, but it lowered the activity of DMN-demethylase 24 h after its administration. Finally, lead lowered the lethal effects of DMN. The mechanism by which lead influenced DMN toxicity is discussed...|$|E
40|$|A {{study of}} the {{adaptive}} changes of some enzyme activities to the dietary protein intake {{was made in the}} liver, kidney, and pancreas of rats and serum of humans. The rats fed the 40 per cent casein diet had a higher rate of weight gain and the weights of the liver and kidney were higher than in the rats fed the 10 per cent casein diet. Three enzymes involved in the elimination of excess nitrogen from the body were found to show a similar response to increased dietary protein intake. These enzymes were: D-amino acid oxidase in the kidneys, arginase in the liver and kidneys, and <b>glutamic-pyruvic</b> <b>transaminase</b> in the liver of rats. The rate of enzyme induction was detectable the second day, being high during the first four days and reaching the maximum value on the fourth day. Thereafter, the enzymatic activity did not change much. The alkaline phosphatase activities in the liver and kidneys of the rats did not show significant change during consumption of the diets containing 10 per cent or 40 per cent casein. Samples of pancreatic trypsinogen and chymotrypsinogen of the rats were not collected during the appropriate time to note any significant changes caused by the diets. A more appropriate experimental design, including proper timing for feedings and dissections, for the {{study of the}} adaptation of the proteolytic enzymes in the pancreas of the rats is desirable and recommended. The values for the circulating enzymes of the human serum, 0 -amino acid oxidase, <b>glutamic-pyruvic</b> <b>transaminase,</b> and alkaline phosphatase were not found to be affected significantly by the diets containing 12 per cent and 30 per cent protein calories...|$|E

40|$|Although {{acetaminophen}} {{is widely}} used in pregnant women, the effects of pregnancy on its hepatotoxicity remain unknown. We assessed these effects in pregnant mice (17 â€” 18 days of gesta tion). The hepatotoxicity of acetaminophen (300 â€” 400 mg. kg 1 i. p.) was increased markedly in pregnant mice, as judged by increased serum <b>glutamic-pyruvic</b> <b>transaminase</b> activity, higher incidence of liver necrosis and greater mortality. In vitro, acet aminophen sulfotransferase activity was increased by 47 % in pregnant mice, but acetaminophen glucuronosyltransferase ac tivity was decreased by 54 %; the metabolic activation of acet aminophen to covalently bound metabolites was unchanged.

40|$|To {{determine}} the cause of hepatic injury in patients with hypoxaemia, the persistence of liver susceptibility to toxic injury after hypoxia was investigated in rats. Centrilobular necrosis and marked elevation of serum <b>glutamic-pyruvic</b> <b>transaminase</b> (SGPT) and serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) activities were induced by carbon tetrachloride (0. 1 ml/kg body weight) given in the period between 3 h before and 21 h after exposure to 7 % oxygen for 3 h. This observation, that a short period of hypoxia results in a prolonged sensitivity to carbon tetrachloride-induced liver injury, has not been described previously. The mechanism of the phenomenon is obscure. These observations suggest that the hepatic injury in patients with hypoxaemia may be caused not only by the hypoxia per se or chemicals administered before or during hypoxia, but also by chemicals given within 24 h of hypoxaemia...|$|E
