5|$|Born on July 18, 1913, in Vincennes, Indiana, Richard Skelton was {{the fourth}} and {{youngest}} son of Ida Mae (née Fields) and Joseph Elmer Skelton. Joseph, a grocer, died two months before Richard was born; {{he had once been}} a clown with the Hagenbeck-Wallace Circus. During Skelton's lifetime there was some dispute about the year of his birth. Author Wesley Hyatt suggests that since he began working at such an early age, Skelton may have claimed <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>older</b> than he actually was in order to gain employment. Vincennes neighbors described the Skelton family as being extremely poor; a childhood friend remembered that her parents broke up a youthful romance between her sister and Skelton because they thought he had no future.|$|E

25|$|Archibald {{was born}} on 7 February 1900, in Edinburgh, an only son. When he was 16, {{he was working on}} Princess Street when he was given a white feather by an older woman, who mistaking thought <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>older</b> and {{avoiding}} his patriotic duty. Later, he ran away from home and joined the Navy. He was the youngest rating killed during the night of the bombing, aged 17 years old.|$|E
25|$|Part of {{the process}} of {{recapitulation}} is for Christ to go through every stage of human life, from infancy to old age, and simply by living it, sanctify it with his divinity. Although it is sometimes claimed that Irenaeus believed Christ did not die until <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>older</b> than is conventionally portrayed, the bishop of Lyon simply pointed out that because Jesus turned the permissible age for becoming a rabbi (30 years old and above), he recapitulated and sanctified the period between 30 and 50 years old, as per the Jewish custom of periodization on life, and so touches the beginning of old age when one becomes 50 years old. (see Adversus Haereses, book II, chapter 22).|$|E

25|$|As he was {{orphaned}} {{at a young}} age, Lu Xun {{was raised}} by his granduncle, Lu Kang, {{who served as the}} Administrator (太守) of Lujiang Commandery (廬江郡) under the Han government. Lu Kang was originally on friendly terms with the warlord Yuan Shu, but relations between them soured after Lu Kang broke ties with Yuan Shu when the latter declared himself emperor – an act deemed treasonous against the Han emperor. When Lu Kang heard that Yuan Shu was planning to attack Lujiang Commandery, he immediately sent Lu Xun and his relatives back to Wu Commandery for their safety. After Lu Kang died from illness during the siege of Lujiang, Lu Xun became the new head of the Lu family because <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>older</b> than Lu Ji (Lu Kang's son), even though Lu Ji was one generation older than him.|$|E
25|$|Born on 13 August 1872 in Market Weighton, Yorkshire, Mitchell was schooled at St Peter's School in York and captained {{the school}} side {{for two years}} before moving to Brighton, where he took up {{employment}} as a schoolmaster for another two years. This meant that when he went up to Cambridge University, where he was admitted to Caius College, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>older</b> and more experienced than many of his contemporaries, and he swiftly moved into the University side, where he remained from 1894 to 1897. It was as captain of the University side in 1896 that Mitchell instructed his bowler to give away runs so that Oxford University would not be required to follow-on their innings (at the time sides surrendering an 80 run deficit in the first innings were required to follow-on). Protests came from both the Pavilion and in newspapers about this. The tactic itself, however, did not help Cambridge win – they went on to lose the match by four wickets.|$|E
25|$|Law {{went to live}} at Janet's {{house in}} Helensburgh, near Glasgow. Her {{brothers}} Charles, Richard and William were partners in the family merchant bank Kidston & Sons, and as {{only one of them}} had married (and produced no heir) it was generally accepted that Law would inherit the firm, or at least play a role in its management when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>older.</b> Immediately upon arriving from Kingston, Law began attending Gilbertfield School, a preparatory school in Hamilton. In 1873, aged fourteen, he transferred to the High School of Glasgow, where with his excellent memory he showed a talent for languages, excelling in Greek, German and French. During this period, he first began to play chess – he would carry a board on the train between Helensburgh and Glasgow, challenging other commuters to matches. He eventually became an excellent amateur player, and competed with internationally renowned chess masters. Despite his excellent academic record, it became obvious at Glasgow that he was better suited to business than to university, and when he was sixteen, Law left school to become a clerk at Kidston & Sons.|$|E

He was quoted saying [...] "I was horrified on the last Bond I did. Whole slews of sequences where Christopher Walken was machine-gunning hundreds of people. I said 'That wasn't Bond, those weren't Bond films.' It stopped being what they were all about. You didn't dwell on the blood and the brains spewing all over the place".|$|E
500|$|Daltrey spotted Entwistle {{by chance}} {{on the street}} {{carrying}} a bass and recruited him into the Detours. In mid-1961, Entwistle suggested Townshend as a guitarist, Daltrey on lead guitar, Entwistle on bass, Harry Wilson on drums, and Colin Dawson on vocals. [...] The band played instrumentals by the Shadows and the Ventures, {{and a variety of}} pop and trad jazz covers. Daltrey was considered the leader and, according to Townshend, [...] "ran things the way he wanted them". Wilson was fired in mid-1962 and replaced by Doug Sandom, though <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>older</b> {{than the rest of the}} band, married, and a more proficient musician, having been playing semi-professionally for two years.|$|E

One of his home runs travelled 450 feet. After {{graduating from high school}} a semester early in December 1998, he was given a baseball scholarship to Maple Woods Community College. Pujols hit a grand slam and turned an unassisted triple play in the first game of his only college season. Playing shortstop, he batted [...]461 with 22 home runs as a freshman before deciding to enter the Major League Baseball (MLB) draft.|$|E

500|$|On September 8, [...] at AT Park, Bumgarner {{was called}} up to the Majors for his first start, making his Major League debut against the San Diego Padres in place of Tim Lincecum, who was {{scratched}} with back spasms. At the age of twenty, he became the second-youngest pitcher ever to start a game for the Giants, and the youngest since the franchise moved west in 1958. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>older</b> only than Mike McCormick, who started two games for the Giants—as a nineteen-year-old—in , when the team was still in New York. In {{the bottom of the}} third inning with no outs, Bumgarner struckout Kevin Correia for his first career strikeout. Three days later, Buster Posey made his Major League debut. Bumgarner made four appearances with the Giants in 2009, posting an ERA of 1.80, striking out ten batters, and pitching ten innings.|$|E
500|$|While many {{constituents}} supported Davies in {{his frequent}} attacks on government policies, the local Labour Party became increasingly concerned by his activities. By the late 1960s {{many of them}} were from a younger generation, with no experience of the shared hardships of the 1920s and 1930s, and with a less parochial mindset. They were angered by what they perceived as Davies's disloyalty to the Wilson government, elected in 1964 after thirteen years of opposition, and his penchant for following his own agenda. There was also the question of his age; in 1970 he was supposedly 83, but rumours that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>older</b> were widespread. By March 1970 the local party discussed replacing Davies as their candidate at the next general election, citing his age rather than policy disagreements. The National Executive of the party sanctioned this action, and at a special meeting [...] on 10 May, which Davies declined to attend, he was formally deselected.|$|E
500|$|According to Jason Trost, two sequels to The FP {{have been}} planned, {{the first of}} which would involve going to Hong Kong. He said the first sequel would take place five years after the {{original}} and would feature more dancing and a Beat-Beat Revelation tournament. He also compared the film's plot to that of Escape from L.A. Trost also teased the possibility of a fourth film to come when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>older,</b> comparing it to Rocky Balboa. In August 2013, Trost said that both he and the film's investors had not received any money from The FP, and [...] "probably never will". He further stated that it was challenging [...] "to {{figure out a way to}} get people to fund a sequel to a movie that recouped zero dollars". In February 2016, the teaser trailer to the sequel was released known as Beats of Rage: The FP Part 2. In summer of 2016, the sequel was changed from a movie to a television series. Filming for the sequel wrapped in fall of 2016. The sequel will be released sometime in 2017. The second trailer was released on April 28, 2017 on YouTube under the name The Beats of Rage. The third trailer of the series was released on August of 2017.|$|E

500|$|Lucas based the CGI on the {{character}} as he originally appeared in Return of the Jedi. In this film, Jabba the Hutt is an immense, sedentary, slug-like creature designed by Lucas's Industrial Light & Magic Creature Shop. Design consultant Ralph McQuarrie claimed, [...] "In my sketches Jabba was huge, agile, sort of an apelike figure. But then the design went into another direction, and Jabba became more like a worm kind of creature." [...] According to the 1985 documentary From Star Wars to Jedi, Lucas rejected initial designs of {{the character}}. One made Jabba appear too human—almost like a Fu Manchu character—while a second made him look too snail-like. Lucas finally settled on a design that was a hybrid of the two, drawing for further inspiration on an O'Galop cartoon figure flanking an early depiction of Bibendum (also known as the [...] "Michelin Man"). Return of the Jedi costume designer Nilo Rodis-Jamero commented, My vision of Jabba was literally Orson Welles when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>older.</b> I saw him as a very refined man. Most of the villains we like are very smart people. But Phil Tippett kept imagining him {{as some kind of}} slug, almost like in Alice in Wonderland. At one time he sculpted a creature that looked like a slug that's smoking. I kept thinking I must be really off, but eventually that's where it led up to." ...|$|E
500|$|Brian Epstein {{managed the}} Beatles from 1962 until his {{untimely}} death in 1967. He had no prior experience managing artists, {{but he had}} a strong influence on the group's dress code and attitude on stage. Lennon initially resisted his attempts to encourage the band to present a professional appearance, but eventually complied, saying, [...] "I'll wear a bloody balloon if somebody's going to pay me". McCartney took over on bass after Sutcliffe decided to stay in Hamburg, and Pete Best was replaced with drummer Ringo Starr; this completed the four-piece line-up that would entertain millions of fans until the group's break-up in 1970. The band's first single, [...] "Love Me Do", was released in October 1962 and reached No. 17 on the British charts. They recorded their debut album, Please Please Me, in under 10 hours on 11 February 1963, a day when Lennon was suffering the effects of a cold, which is evident in the vocal on the last song to be recorded that day, [...] "Twist and Shout". The Lennon–McCartney songwriting partnership yielded eight of its fourteen tracks. With few exceptions—one being the album title itself—Lennon had yet to bring his love of wordplay to bear on his song lyrics, saying: [...] "We were just writing songs... pop songs with no more thought of them than that—to create a sound. And the words were almost irrelevant". In a 1987 interview, McCartney said that the other Beatles idolised John: [...] "He was like our own little Elvis... We all looked up to John. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>older</b> and he was very much the leader; he was the quickest wit and the smartest." ...|$|E
500|$|Kennel {{was born}} in 1925 to a Mennonite family who lived in Chassey-Beaupré. His father was a farmer and mayor of the city, and Kennel was {{expected}} to run the family farm when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>older.</b> At age20, Kennel developed an interest in pastoral ministry and attended theological training at the Bible Institute of Nogent-sur-Marne in 1945–46, training that was later completed by studies at the European Mennonite Bible School in 1948–49. While still a farmer, he became a Mennonite missionary in the Meuse, Marne and Haute-Marne departments. In 1960, he discovered Pentecostalism through Roma missions, notably the Life and Light Evangelical Roma Mission (Mission Évangélique Tsigane [...] "Vie et Lumière"); he was attracted to this form of Christianity, since it emphasized missionary zeal and legitimized his ministry. He founded an evangelical group in his city, which caused conflict with his family, other religious leaders and his neighbors. In the early 1960s, Kennel became pastor of the church at Joinville; he conducted humanitarian activities on his farm, providing relief to homeless, former prisoners, drug addicts and alcoholics. In 1964, he also directed the church of Saint-Dizier; three years later, he decided to give up farming to fully devote himself to religious activities. In 1975 he was appointed treasurer of the Federation of Free Evangelical Pentecostals, and elected president seven years later. Under Kennel's leadership of the Pentecostal Church of Besançon, the church quickly opened many places of worship in Northern and Eastern France; Kennel trained pastors among his converts (including his son Étienne, who was ordained in 1981), {{and sent them to}} direct the new assemblies. In 1989 Kennel legally registered the Evangelical Missionary Federation, whose purpose was to federate all the churches (then composed of over thirty pastors).|$|E
