Hugh also worked to improve the <b>educational</b> <b>level</b> of this clergy, even refusing to allow some candidates to benefices to be installed because of their lack of education. The bishop also worked to improve the conditions of the poorer clergy in his diocese, attempting to ensure that all the clergy in his diocese had enough to live on. Previously, it was thought that Hugh had sent out a set of articles of inquiry to his diocesan clergy, but these articles are now shown to have been produced by Hugh's successor, Robert Grosseteste.|$|E

We used data from the 2004 &# 8211; 2008 National R&D Survey in Singapore. The results from 366 firms across different industries indicate that when a firm’s technological domains are heterogeneous, those firms with an RSE workforce comprising similar <b>educational</b> <b>levels</b> have positive innovation performance, measured as the number of patent applications, while those comprising diverse <b>educational</b> <b>levels</b> have negative innovation performance. Our further exploration of the positive interaction between technological domain heterogeneity and similarity of <b>educational</b> <b>levels</b> suggests that firms that had a high ratio of RSEs with lower <b>educational</b> <b>levels</b> had more positive patent outcomes compared to those that had a high ratio of RSEs with higher <b>educational</b> <b>levels.</b> The results show that there are limits to the strength of technological diversity in a firm’s absorptive capacity as explained by organizational demography. open...|$|R

Results The PAF estimates showed that 17. 2 % of the diabetes burden in men and 20. 1 % of the burden in women were attributed to lower <b>educational</b> <b>levels</b> in Sweden when combining all age groups. The burden was, however, most pronounced in the older age groups (70 - 79 and 80 +), where lower <b>educational</b> <b>levels</b> contributed to 22. 5 % to 24. 5 % of the diabetes burden in men and 27. 8 % to 32. 6 % in women.

25|$|Some {{researchers}} in development economics, such as Theodore Schultz {{who won a}} Nobel Prize in 1979, have found that literate farmers in developing countries are more productive than illiterate farmers. They therefore recommend investing in human capital (education, health, etc.) as an effective tool for economic development. Others, such as Mohammed Tamim, believe that economic development is measurable in <b>educational</b> <b>level</b> from primary school to the university. They noticed that wherever the <b>educational</b> <b>level</b> is raised, the level of development is also raised. They conclude {{that the percentage of}} the schooled population is proportional to the economic growth rate and inversely proportional in the demographic growth rate. The Take-Off of Walt Whitman Rostow can start in a country if its population is completely schooled. It is therefore necessary for the organization of a worldwide education program, itself conditioned by another worldwide program of birth control and the establishment of a worldwide organization for the implementation of this development strategy.|$|E

25|$|Use of BPO pantomimes, {{instead of}} the IO pantomimes {{dominant}} in non-apraxic patients (i.e. BPO errors), {{is one of the}} diagnostic error patterns in apraxia.

For example, BPO errors are differentially affected by age and <b>educational</b> <b>level</b> in normal subjects; older, healthy people (tested group average 69 years old) and healthy adults with lower amount of education (tested group with average 7.2 years of formal education) make significantly more BPO errors than the average adult population.|$|E
25|$|The {{education}} {{of women in}} India {{plays a significant role}} in improving livings standards in the country. A higher women literacy rate improves the quality of life both at home and outside the home, by encouraging and promoting {{education of}} children, especially female children, and in reducing the infant mortality rate. Several studies have shown that a lower level of women literacy rates results in higher levels of fertility and infant mortality, poorer nutrition, lower earning potential and the lack of an ability to make decisions within a household. Women's lower educational levels is also shown to adversely affect the health and living conditions of children. A survey that was conducted in India showed results which support the fact that infant mortality rate was inversely related to female literacy rate and <b>educational</b> <b>level.</b> The survey also suggests a correlation between education and economic growth.|$|E

Of 309 women, 228 responded to the Women in Community College Administrative Positions Questionnaire. A portion of the WCCAPQ, the Self-Perceptions Questionnaire (SPQ) was used for this study.

25|$|Widespread child {{malnutrition}} in slums {{is closely related}} to family income, mothers' food practice, mothers' <b>educational</b> <b>level,</b> and maternal employment or housewifery. Poverty may result in inadequate food intake when people cannot afford to buy and store enough food, which leads to malnutrition. Another common cause is mothers' faulty feeding practices, including inadequate breastfeeding and wrongly preparation of food for children. Tada et al.'s study in Bangkok slums shows that around 64% of the mothers sometimes fed their children instant food instead of a normal meal. And about 70% of the mothers did not provide their children three meals everyday. Mothers' lack of education leads to their faulty feeding practices. Many mothers in slums don't have knowledge on food nutrition for children. Maternal employment also influences children's nutritional status. For the mothers who work outside, their children are prone to be malnourished. These children are likely to be neglected by their mothers or sometimes not carefully looked after by their female relatives. Recent study has shown improvements in health awareness in adolescent age group of a rural slum area.|$|E
25|$|Differential item {{functioning}} (DIF), {{sometimes referred}} to as measurement bias, is a phenomenon when participants from different groups (ex gender, race, disability) with the same latent abilities give different answers to specific questions on the same IQ test. DIF analysis measures such specific items on a test alongside measuring participants latent abilities on other similar questions. A consistent different group response to a specific question among similar type of questions can indicate an effect of DIF. It does not count as differential item functioning if both groups have equally valid chance of giving different responses to the same questions. Such bias can be a result of culture, <b>educational</b> <b>level</b> and other factors that are independent of group traits. DIF is only considered if test-takers from different groups with the same underlying latent ability level have a different chance of giving specific responses. Such questions are usually removed {{in order to make the}} test equally fair for both groups. Common techniques for analyzing DIF are item response theory (IRT) based methods, Mantel-Haenszel, and logistic regression.|$|E

This bottom line, however, includes more than 80,000 Cossacks and militiamen, as well as about 20,000 men who garrisoned the fortresses in the operational area. The majority of the officer corps came from the aristocracy. About 7% of the officer corps came from the Baltic German nobility from the governorates of Estonia and Livonia. Because the Baltic German nobles tended to be better educated than the ethnic Russian nobility, the Baltic Germans were often favored with positions in high command and various technical positions. The Russian Empire had no universal educational system, and those who could afford it had to hire tutors and/or {{send their children to}} private schools.

The Baltic German nobility were more inclined to invest in their children's education than the ethnic Russian nobility, which led to the government favoring them when granting officers' commissions. Of the 800 doctors in the Russian Army in 1812, almost all of them were Baltic Germans. The British historian Dominic Lieven noted that at the time, the Russian elite defined Russianness in terms of loyalty to the House of Romanov rather in terms of language or culture, and as the Baltic German aristocrats were very loyal, they were considered and considered themselves to be Russian despite speaking German as their first language.|$|E
