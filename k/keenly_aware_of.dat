Undergraduate members, alumni advisors, national fraternities and University administration regularly collaborate on the shared goal of reducing risks. Self-policing by peer moderators and the incorporation of live-in adult mentors have been important tools in addressing this goal.|$|E

25|$|Flying faster {{means that}} the {{aircraft}} passes through the range of a gun more rapidly, {{reducing the number of}} rounds a particular gun can fire at that aircraft. Flying at higher altitudes has a similar effect, as it requires larger shells to reach those altitudes, and this typically results in slower firing rates for a variety of practical reasons. Aircraft using jet engines basically double the speed and altitude of conventional designs, so limiting the number of shells that the chance of hitting the bomber essentially dropped to zero. As early as 1942, German flak commanders were <b>keenly</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> the problem, and expecting to face jet bombers, they began a missile development program to supplant their guns.|$|E

25|$|The Civil War {{had taken}} its toll on Baltimore, however, as did the yellow fever and cholera {{epidemics}} that repeatedly ravaged the nation's cities, killing 853 in Baltimore {{in the summer of}} 1832 alone. Hopkins was <b>keenly</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> the city's need for medical facilities, particularly in light of the medical advances made during the war, and in 1870 he made a will setting aside seven million dollars — mostly in B stock — for the incorporation of a free hospital and affiliated medical and nurse's training colleges, as well as an orphanage for colored children and a university. Many board members were on both boards. The hospital and orphan asylum would each be overseen by the 12-member hospital board of trustees, and the university by the 12-member university board of trustees. Johns Hopkins' bequest was used to posthumously found the Johns Hopkins Colored Children Orphan Asylum first as he requested, in 1875; the Johns Hopkins University in 1876; the Johns Hopkins Press, the longest continuously operating academic press in America, in 1878; the Johns Hopkins Hospital and the Johns Hopkins School of Nursing in 1889; the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine 1893; and the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health in 1916.|$|E
25|$|<b>Keenly</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> {{the need}} to seize the {{initiative}} {{and to get the}} process under firm judicial control, de Gaulle appointed Justice Minister François de Menthon to lead the Legal Purge (Épuration légale) to punish traitors and to clear away the traces of the Vichy regime. Knowing that he would need to reprieve many of the 'economic collaborators'—such as police and civil servants who held minor roles under Vichy {{in order to keep the}} country running as normally as possible—he assumed, as head of state, the right to commute death sentences. Of the near 2,000 people who received the death sentence from the courts, fewer than 800 were executed. De Gaulle commuted 998 of the 1,554 capital sentences submitted before him, including all those involving women. Many others were given jail terms or had their voting rights and other legal privileges taken away. It is generally agreed that the purges were conducted arbitrarily, with often absurdly severe or overly lenient punishments being handed down. It was also notable that the less well-off people who were unable to pay for lawyers were more harshly treated. As time went by and feelings grew less intense, a number of people who had held fairly senior positions under the Vichy government—such as Maurice Papon and René Bousquet—escaped consequences by claiming to have worked secretly for the resistance or to have played a double game, working for the good of France by serving the established order.|$|E

40|$|This {{book had}} its genesis {{in a rather}} disorganized and poorly {{conceived}} lecture on optimal foraging theory that one of us (GHO) gave to an advanced ecology class {{during the winter of}} 1971. The deficiencies in that treatment, combined with the obvious potential of an improved conceptualization and analysis of the problem, {{led to the formation of}} a small seminar on optimal foraging theory attended by Charles Fowler, Nolan Pearson and ourselves. This seminar, which extended over two academic quarters, produced the basic fine-grained foraging models and some hints about wider applications of the results. We both found ourselves independently stimulated to explore the implications of the ideas we had conceived for a wide range of ecological problems and these preliminary explorations, carried out while we were physically widely separated, were sufficiently rewarding that we decided to collaborate to produce the present work. We have individually brought to this effort very different skills and experiences and much of what there is of value in this book is the result of the mutual interplay of these contrasting abilities. One of us (ELC) has been primarily responsible for the mathematical formulations appearing in the following chapters, while the other (GHO) has provided a larger share of biological insights. Nevertheless we are quite unable to trace the genesis of most of our original ideas and we are both <b>keenly</b> <b>aware</b> that neither <b>of</b> us alone could have produced anything remotely resembling the present work...|$|R
