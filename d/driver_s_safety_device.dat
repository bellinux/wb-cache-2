In at least one embodiment, a method for managing an autonomic <b>safety</b> <b>device,</b> such as a smoke detector, based on functioning state and operating status of the autonomic <b>safety</b> <b>device</b> includes processing received signals from the autonomic <b>safety</b> <b>device</b> to obtain {{an analysis of the}} condition of the autonomic <b>safety</b> <b>device,</b> generating one or more stay-awake signals based on the functioning status and the operating state of the autonomic <b>safety</b> <b>device,</b> transmitting the stay-awake signal, transmitting self health/urgency data, and transmitting environment health/urgency data. A quiesce component of an autonomic <b>safety</b> <b>device</b> can render the autonomic <b>safety</b> <b>device</b> inactive for a specific amount of time or until a challenging situation has passed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In many safety-critical applications, battery perfor-mance is a {{significant}} limiting factor that affects the feasibility of electronic <b>safety</b> <b>devices</b> intended to alert workers to hazardous situations. In particular, battery capacity and lifetime are difficult to predict when <b>safety</b> <b>devices</b> are exposed to extremes of temperature, humidity, shock, and vibration that are common in construction, excavation, drill rigs, and mining work sites. Because battery failure is unacceptable in <b>safety</b> <b>devices,</b> periodic preventative maintenance is required, adding to device cost and labor cost and reducing acceptance of electronic <b>safety</b> <b>devices.</b> Energy harvesting and communications techniques based on passive UHF RFID technology may offer an alternative to battery power for some types of <b>safety</b> alert <b>devices,</b> particularly where hazardous conditions are created by powered heavy equipment. We present a worker <b>safety</b> <b>device</b> designed around a passiv...|$|R
40|$|The study {{described}} herein entailed measuring {{approach speed}} of the hands under simulated press machining conditions using two types of <b>safety</b> <b>devices.</b> A total of eight subjects {{were used in the}} experiment: four males in their twenties and four males in their fifties. Hand speed was faster for the photoelectric <b>safety</b> <b>device</b> (PSDI) than for <b>safety</b> <b>devices</b> activated using both hands (TWO) for both subject groups, in excess of 1. 6 m/see. The study showed that <b>safety</b> <b>devices</b> capable of automatic detection such as PSDI <b>safety</b> <b>device</b> more effectively ensure safety and work efficiency than the TWO type.

40|$|Abstract. A {{monitoring}} system used in marine sink-float <b>safety</b> <b>device</b> is introduced. The ARM Cortex-M 3 {{is the core}} of microcontroller in this system, and the hardware and software architectures of the {{monitoring system}} are designed. The designed monitoring system can multi-point monitor marine environment around sink-float <b>safety</b> <b>device,</b> by doing this, the <b>safety</b> <b>device</b> can take marine equipment to escape from harsh marine environment by submerging a certain depth. So we can make sure marine equipment safe and normal. The experimental results show that the sink-float <b>safety</b> <b>device</b> can work normally in the harsh marine environment with the monitoring system. The acquisition of multi-point environment monitor as well as data management is achieved effectively. The reliability and safety of equipment are guaranteed by the sink-float <b>safety</b> <b>device...</b>|$|R

30|$|The 2009 Tax Authorities Report {{indicates}} that the phenomenon of leasing companies’ purchasing cars with minimal <b>safety</b> <b>devices</b> has existed for several years. However, {{as a result of}} the recent change in tax incentives intended to encourage purchasing cars equipped with more <b>safety</b> <b>devices,</b> there are indications that the gap in the level of installed <b>safety</b> <b>devices</b> between company cars and privately owned cars is closing. This is prominent in the number of airbags. The difference in the number of airbags between company cars and privately owned cars was reduced in 2008.|$|R
