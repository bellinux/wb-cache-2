40|$|DUR 1 NG a {{study of}} {{sulphide}} mineralization in the Isle of Man, the mineral gratonite (Pb 9 As 4 S 15) was identified. As {{this appears to be}} the first recorded occurrence of a Pb-As sulphosalt from the British Isles, {{a brief description of the}} occurrence seems warranted. The gratonite-bearing samples were found in waste material on the dumps of the North Laxey mine, by the side of the Ballaglass stream (O. S. 1 : 50, 000 grid reference: SC 423888). The mineral deposits of the Isle of Man are predominantly vein deposits containing pyrite, chalcopyrite, sphalerite, and argentiferous galena. Very small amounts of Ni and Sb ore have also been recorded, the latter consisting of stibnite, 'plumosite', 'polytelite', and 'silver <b>fahlerz</b> ' (Lamplugh, 1903) ...|$|E
40|$|Aladag region had precipitated in Devonian Alt Creatse time {{interval}} in middle Taurus. This region had been tectonic events along with long durations. Because of ıt contains nappe structured allocton Yahyalı, Siyah Aladag, Minaretepler, Cataloturan, Beyaz Aladağ nappes and ophiolitic melange stocks in Aladağ region. Around Ispirtepe of Aladag region {{two types of}} mineralization had been found. First mineralization is seen in Mineratepe's stocks Upper Trias aged dolomitic limestone and Kretase aged ophiolitic melange intersection. Ore is seen by being fault filling through North and South directed faults. Second mineralization is structured as sulphide ore part which has been carried by morens to the area. The galenite blocks have been about one meter. There is a moren cover an ore blocks in northern part of mineralization in the area. Paragenesis {{has been found in}} ored-samples with respect to microscopic ore workings it is found that first ore minerals are galenite, sphalerite, pyrite, <b>fahlerz</b> (tetrahedrite), chalcopyrite and their alterational products which are smithsonite, gotite, malachite, seruzite, anglezite, lepidocrosite, gang mineralization of calsit, dolomite and quartz...|$|E
40|$|We {{report a}} trace element - Pb isotope {{analytical}} (LIA) database on the "Singen Copper", a peculiar type of copper {{found in the}} North Alpine realm, from its type locality, the Early Bronze Age Singen Cemetery (Germany). What distinguishes “Singen Copper” from other coeval copper types? (i) is it a discrete metal lot with a uniform provenance (if so, can its provenance be constrained) ? (ii) was it manufactured by a special, unique metallurgical process that can be discriminated from others? Trace element concentrations can give clues on the ore types that were mined, {{but they can be}} modified (more or less intentionally) by metallurgical operations. A more robust indicator are the ratios of chemically similar elements (e. g. Co/Ni, Bi/Sb, etc.), since they should remain nearly constant during metallurgical operations, and are expected to behave homogeneously in each mineral of a given mining area, but their partition amongst the different mineral species is known to cause strong inter-element fractionations. We tested the trace element ratio pattern predicted by geochemical arguments on the Brixlegg mining area. Brixlegg itself is not compatible with the Singen Copper objects, and we only report it because it is a rare instance of a mining area for which sufficient trace element analyses are available in the literature. We observe that As/Sb in <b>fahlerz</b> varies by a factor 1. 8 above/below median; As/Sb in enargite varies by a factor of 2. 5 with a 10 times higher median. Most of the 102 analyzed metal objects from Singen are Sb-Ni-rich, corresponding to “antimony-nickel copper” of the literature. Other trace element concentrations vary by > 100 times, ratios by factors > 50. Pb isotopic compositions are all significantly different from each other. They do not form a single linear array and require > 3 ore batches that certainly do not derive from one single mining area. Our data suggest a heterogeneous provenance of “Singen copper”. Archaeological information limits the scope to Central European sources. LIA requires a diverse supply network from many mining localities, including possibly Brittany. Trace element ratios show more heterogeneity than LIA; this can be explained either by deliberate selection of one particular ore mineral (from very many sources) or by processing of assorted ore minerals from a smaller number of sources, with the unintentional effect that the quality of the copper would not be constant, as the metallurgical properties of alloys would vary with trace element concentrations...|$|E
