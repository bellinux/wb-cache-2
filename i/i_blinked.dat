And I wondered, as <b>I</b> <b>blinked</b> up at her, [...] if you would not some day vanish away altogether--unless you make a [...] fortune by being looked at. I wish I could. Only would they pay [...] enough? That is the question.|$|E
60|$|It {{was early}} in April in the year '83 that I woke one morning to find Sherlock Holmes standing, fully dressed, {{by the side of}} my bed. He was a late riser, as a rule, and as the clock on the mantelpiece showed me that it was only a quarter-past seven, <b>I</b> <b>blinked</b> up at him in some surprise, and perhaps just a little resentment, for I was myself regular in my habits.|$|E
6000|$|It never {{occurred}} to me then that I didn't know in what soundness of mind exactly consisted and what a delicate and, upon the whole, unimportant matter it was. With some idea of not hurting his feelings <b>I</b> <b>blinked</b> at him in an interested manner. But when he proceeded to ask me mysteriously whether I remembered what had passed just now between that Steward of ours and [...] "that man Hamilton," [...] I only grunted sourly assent and turned away my head.|$|E

60|$|So {{we stood}} among the shafts {{of the open}} cart-shed that faced the road. Then {{she looked down at}} the ground, a little sideways, and I noticed a small black frown on her brows. She seemed to brood for a moment. Then she looked {{straight}} into my eyes, so that <b>I</b> <b>blinked</b> and wanted to turn my face aside. She was searching me for something and her look was too near. The frown was still on her keen, sallow brow.|$|E
60|$|Stupidly <b>I</b> <b>blinked</b> about me, {{trying to}} collect my {{scattered}} wits. The strip of shingle stood perhaps a foot {{above the river}} and {{was only a few}} yards wide. In front, the horrible eddy lapped upon the pebbles at each revolving swirl, and behind us rose a smooth wall of rock absolutely unclimbable, even if it had not overhung. That, however, was not the worst, for a numbing sense of dismay, colder far than the chilly snow-water, crept over me as I remembered that most mountain streams in British Columbia rise and fall several feet daily. They are lowest in early morning, because at night the frost holds fast the drainage of snow-field and glacier which feeds them on the peaks above; then, as the sun unchains the waters, they increase in volume, so that many a ford which a man might pass knee-deep at dawn is swept by roaring flood before the close of afternoon.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{came upon}} a boiler wallowing in the grass, then found a path leading up the hill. It turned aside for the boulders, and also for an {{undersized}} railway-truck lying there on its back with its wheels in the air. One was off. The thing looked as dead as the carcass of some animal. I came upon more pieces of decaying machinery, a stack of rusty rails. To the left a clump of trees made a shady spot, where dark things seemed to stir feebly. <b>I</b> <b>blinked,</b> the path was steep. A horn tooted to the right, and I saw the black people run. A heavy and dull detonation shook the ground, {{a puff of smoke}} came out of the cliff, and that was all. No change appeared {{on the face of the}} rock. They were building a railway. The cliff was not in the way or anything; but this objectless blasting was all the work going on.|$|E

50|$|In {{terms of}} my own sexuality, I don't know what it was, but <b>I</b> just never <b>blinked.</b> <b>I</b> was always amazed when other people did; I was always sort of flabbergasted when people would suffer angst about it. I {{understood}} that it was taboo and all of that, but I chalked it up {{as a kind of}} a generational problem.|$|R
6000|$|And I love letters. I am {{jealous of}} their honour and {{concerned}} for {{the dignity and}} comeliness of their service. I was, most likely, the only writer that neat lady had ever caught {{in the exercise of}} his craft, and it distressed me {{not to be able to}} remember when it was that I dressed myself last, and how. No doubt that would be all right in essentials. The fortune of the house included a pair of gray-blue watchful eyes that would see to that. But I felt, somehow, as grimy as a Costaguana lepero after a day's fighting in the streets, rumpled all over and dishevelled down to my very heels. And I am afraid <b>I</b> <b>blinked</b> stupidly. All this was bad for the honour of letters and the dignity of their service. Seen indistinctly through the dust of my collapsed universe, the good lady glanced about the room with a slightly amused serenity. And she was smiling. What on earth was she smiling at? She remarked casually: ...|$|E

And you’d better believe me for your own good- he doesn’t like people who don’t know how to show a proper respect, and when he’s angry terrible things happen.”“What sort of things?” I heard real alarm enter the other voice now.“Awful things!” said Meg cheerfully, “truly awful. The floor in our {{dressing}} room starts to run with blood...”Up in box five <b>I</b> <b>blinked</b> in surprised amusement. That was a new one!

60|$|Almayer {{gathered}} in the rope intelligently enough, but when the pony's hoofs touched the wharf he gave way all at once to a most foolish optimism. Without pausing, without thinking, almost without looking, he disengaged the hook suddenly from the sling, and the cargo-chain, after hitting the pony's quarters, swung back against the ship's side with a noisy, rattling slap. I suppose <b>I</b> must have <b>blinked.</b> <b>I</b> know I missed something, because the next thing I saw was Almayer lying {{flat on his back}} on the jetty. He was alone.|$|R

60|$|I {{heard the}} {{crashing}} of the barrels as they hurled {{them off the}} waggon, and then a couple of bearded faces and the muzzles of two guns looked in at me.

40|$|The {{cardiovascular}} {{effects of}} the beta-adrenergic blocking agent, sotalol, have been assessed {{in a group of}} patients with heart disease. There was a significant reduction in heart rate and cardiac output, but stroke volume was unchanged. Systemic arterial andpulmonary artery pressures were not significantly altered. Indices of mryocardial function (dp/dt max and V max) were also significantly reduced. Though previous studies have reported that sotalol is devoid of myocardial depression associ-ated with other beta-adrenergic blocking drugs, these results suggest that sotalol has both a nega-tive chronotropic and a lesser negative inotropic action. Beta-adrenergic blocking drugs are now widely used in clinical cardiology. In addition to beta-adrenergic blockade, however, un-desirable effects such as myocardial depression may occur (Nakano and Kusakari, <b>I</b> 966; <b>Blinks,</b> <b>I</b> 967). Sotalol (M. J., i 999) l has been reported to be a beta-adrenergic blocking agent devoid of significant myocardial de...|$|R

Since then he has taught at a public school in India, {{as well as at}} a Montessori school in the United States, and conducted numerous creative workshops for children. He has written over 60 books, including Turtle Tale, Mooncake, <b>I</b> Can <b>Blink</b> and Happy Birthday Moon. In 1989 he wrote Here Comes the Cat! in collaboration with Vladimir Vagin. The book was awarded the Russian National Book Award and was considered the first Russian-American collaboration on a children's book.|$|R

40|$|A gaze {{tracking}} system, {{based on a}} novel neural approach, is proposed.

This work, instead, aims at developing a low cost, completely non-intrusive and self-calibrating system which combines different techniques for three blocks in Eye Gaze Tracking, <b>i.</b> e. <b>blink</b> detection, feature extraction and neural computing. The experimental results show good accuracy in eye gaze tracking (rmse < 1 degree), and adequate generalization performance (rmse < 2 degrees) ...|$|R
60|$|Mr. Bundercombe was thoughtful, I am {{convinced}} that {{at that moment the}} germs of certain ideas which bore fruit a little later on were born in his mind. <b>I</b> saw him <b>blink</b> several times as he gazed up at the ceiling.

5000|$|Kevin Fallon of The Daily Beast wrote: [...] "Naturally, Underwood sounded astounding, as {{alive as}} those damned hills, {{every time she}} was asked to stand on top of things and belt. But whether it was because of nerves or lack of experience, her acting was painfully lifeless and amateur {{throughout}} the first two thirds of the lengthy ordeal. The singer, it seems, is a proud graduate of the school of 'If <b>I</b> don't <b>blink,</b> they'll think I'm acting!'" [...] Verne Gay of Newsday liked Underwood's performance, commenting that not only could she sing, but [...] "she is a luminous stage presence who had the guts to take {{on one of the most}} iconic roles of the stage or screen." ...|$|R
