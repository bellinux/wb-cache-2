5|$|In Tokyo, after Kaoru learns about Yukishiro Enishi's {{plans to}} kill {{everyone}} connected to Kenshin she teaches Yahiko the ougi of the Kamiya Kasshin. Enishi {{says that his}} <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> kill Kenshin, but to make him suffer by killing the person most important to him: Kaoru. He kidnaps her, leaving a replica of her dead body. Convinced that he again failed to save {{the one who was}} most important to him, Kenshin flees to the Fallen Village and falls into a catatonic depression. When he learns that Kaoru is alive, he and the group rescue her from Enishi. They marry and have a son, Himura Kenji.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, another {{organization}} of fans was established for Maccabi Haifa, and named Inferno Verde, whose members {{sit in the}} stands section 5a. The organization's <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> outdo the Green Apes, but rather to join forces for victories and championships of the team.|$|E
25|$|Unlike other deep architectures, such as DBNs, the <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> {{discover}} the transformed feature representation. The {{structure of the}} hierarchy {{of this kind of}} architecture makes parallel learning straightforward, as a batch-mode optimization problem. In purely discriminative tasks, DSNs perform better than conventional DBNs.|$|E
50|$|However, his <b>goal</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> wholly denigrate or {{invalidate}} the Chinese philosophies, but {{to integrate}} them into Buddhist teachings {{to reach a}} greater understanding of how the human condition came into being.|$|R
25|$|In 1538, Nicolas Wynman, a German {{professor}} of languages and poetry, {{wrote the first}} swimming book, Colymbetes. His <b>goal</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> promote exercise, but rather to reduce the dangers of drowning. Nevertheless, the book contained a good, methodical approach to learning breaststroke.|$|R
50|$|The World Grand Champions Cup {{was created}} in 1993 after radical changes made on the biggest tournaments {{organised}} by the FIVB. The main <b>goal</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> have a single year without a world FIVB competition. This is the only FIVB tournament that doesn't give FIVB points for the world ranking.|$|R
25|$|In food production, the <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> simply {{change the}} {{configuration}} of double bonds while maintaining the same ratios of hydrogen to carbon. Instead, {{the goal is to}} decrease the number of double bonds and increase the amount of hydrogen in the fatty acid. This changes the consistency of the fatty acid and makes it less prone to rancidity (in which free radicals attack double bonds). Production of trans fatty acids is therefore an undesirable side effect of partial hydrogenation.|$|E
25|$|DNA barcoding is a taxonomic {{method that}} uses a short genetic marker in an organism's DNA to {{identify}} it as belonging to a particular species. It differs from molecular phylogeny in that the main <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> determine patterns of relationship but to identify an unknown sample {{in terms of a}} preexisting classification. Although barcodes are sometimes used in an effort to identify unknown species or assess whether species should be combined or separated, These provide poor resolution for land plants, and a call was made for regions to be assessed that could complement rbcL and matK.|$|E
25|$|The easiest fusion {{reaction}} to achieve {{is found in}} a 50–50 mixture of tritium and deuterium. For fusion power experiments this mixture must be held at high temperatures for relatively lengthy times {{in order to have}} an efficient reaction. For explosive use, however, the <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> produce efficient fusion, but simply provide extra neutrons early in the process. Since a nuclear explosion is supercritical, any extra neutrons will be multiplied by the chain reaction, so even tiny quantities introduced early can have a large effect on the final outcome. For this reason, even the relatively low compression pressures and times (in fusion terms) found {{in the center of a}} hollow pit warhead are enough to create the desired effect.|$|E
50|$|Newspapers {{continued}} {{their role as}} the main internal communication system for the Army-style campaigns of the era. The <b>goal</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> convince independents, who are few in number, but to rally all the loyal party members to the polls by making them enthusiastic about the party's platform, and apprehensive about the enemy.|$|R
25|$|During Napier's time, {{most of the}} {{computations}} {{were made}} on boards with tally-marks or jetons. So, unlike how it may {{be seen by the}} modern reader, his <b>goal</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> use moves of counters on a board to multiply, divide and find square roots, but rather {{to find a way to}} compute symbolically.|$|R
25|$|Provide {{evidence}} that the Holocaust happened, with a specific focus on the evidence for: the existence and use of gas chambers; and a co-ordinated Nazi plan, directed by Hitler, for the extermination of Jews. The <b>goal</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> prove the holocaust, but to show that any reasonable and fair-minded historian would not doubt it, and that Irving must therefore <b>not</b> <b>be</b> reasonable or fair-minded.|$|R
25|$|The {{uprising}} {{began in}} early morning of June 22, 1941, {{the first day}} of the war. The main forces of the LAF were concentrated in Kaunas. At 10am LAF held a meeting in Žaliakalnis, dividing the responsibilities. It was decided that the main <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> fight with the Russians, but to secure the city from inside (secure organizations, institutions, enterprises) and declare independence. By the evening of June 22, the Lithuanians controlled the Presidential Palace, post office, telephone and telegraph, radio station and radiophone. Control of the telephone allowed Lithuanians to disconnect all known communist numbers and talk to each other without passwords or codes. The radio station was sabotaged by the Russians, therefore repair works were carried out during the night from June 22 to 23. Spare parts were delivered by medical students, driving an ambulance. Despite fears of inadequate Lithuanian forces guarding the radio, in the morning of June 23, Leonas Prapuolenis read the declaration of Lithuanian independence and the list of members of the Provisional Government. The broadcast was repeated several times in Lithuanian, German, and French.|$|E
500|$|Because {{children}} with tics often present to physicians when their tics are most severe, {{and because of}} the waxing and waning nature of tics, it is recommended that medication not be started immediately or changed often. Frequently, the tics subside with explanation, reassurance, understanding of the condition and a supportive environment. When medication is used, the <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> eliminate symptoms: [...] it should be used at the lowest possible dose that manages symptoms without adverse effects, given that these may be more disturbing than the symptoms for which they were prescribed.|$|E
500|$|The game's playable character, William [...] "B.J." [...] Blazkowicz, {{has been}} {{previously}} featured as the playable protagonist of all Wolfenstein games. When developing the character of Blazkowicz for The New Order, MachineGames considered his appearances in previous games in the series. When doing this, they realised that the character had never really developed at all throughout the games; [...] "He's just the guy that you play," [...] said Pete Hines, Vice President of PR and Marketing for Bethesda. The team discovered that {{they were interested in}} exploring his story, which is what they later invested in. One particular scenario that the team envisioned is putting Blazkowicz in situations where he is uncomfortable. Matthies said, [...] "that's really interesting to me. I love taking things and making them real." [...] Throughout the game, Blazkowicz communicates some of his inner thoughts through short monologues, many of which reveal that he has been traumatized by some of his experiences. [...] "We always loved the idea of a prototypical action hero exterior juxtaposed with a rich and vulnerable interior psychology," [...] said Matthies. One of the largest priorities for the team when developing the character of Blazkowicz was to [...] "reveal whatever needs to be revealed to [...] and the player" [...] simultaneously; Matthies felt that, despite the simplicity of this concept, it is rarely used in games. Prior to developing The New Order, the team had primarily worked on games that involved antihero protagonists. However, id Software wished Blazkowicz to be portrayed differently in the game. Matthies said, [...] "It's really important to [...] that BJ is a hero, and not an anti-hero." [...] The team attempted to develop Blazkowicz into a character that players could relate to, as they felt that players are generally unable to relate to video game protagonists. [...] "The <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> have a protagonist that's so neutral that you can project yourself into them; the goal is to have a protagonist that is so relatable that you become them," [...] said Matthies. They also tried to make players become [...] "emotionally in sync" [...] with Blazkowicz, using the morality choice in the game's prologue to do so.|$|E
50|$|The <b>goal</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> show {{pictures}} of websites and computer monitors, but rather images {{of people whose}} lives were affected {{by the use of}} the growing Internet. Photographs were sent digitally to editors working real-time to choose the best pictures to put on the project's website. The website received more than 4 million hits in the 24 hours that the project was active.|$|R
30|$|A {{randomized}} study comparing ultrasound tutorials {{with and}} without simultaneous translation would have increased {{the power of the}} study. The final <b>goal</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> demonstrate the specific role of translation. The <b>goal</b> <b>was</b> to demonstrate that a bilingual ultrasound course was feasible. Many factors contributed {{to the success of the}} training, such as knowledge and understanding of anatomy, translation of slides and direct discussion with few Chinese physicians speaking English.|$|R
500|$|Filipovitch-Robinson praises Jovanović's [...] "skillful handling" [...] {{of linear}} and aerial perspective. She {{notes that the}} work is devoid of the [...] "studio-contrived quality" [...] of other Orientalist paintings, and argues that Jovanović's main <b>goal</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> depict a {{particular}} historical event but rather to remind his audience of the Balkan peoples' ongoing struggle against the Ottoman Turks and provide a human face to those engaged in that struggle.|$|R
2500|$|Yosef {{has stated}} his {{approach}} {{to the issue of}} homosexuality in Judaism as follows: [...] "It is clear to me that lying with another man is forbidden, and our starting point is commitment to halacha and Torah. The <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> seek permission. But you need to give us a shoulder and support." ...|$|E
2500|$|Somatic-cell nuclear transfer, {{known as}} SCNT, {{can also be}} used to create embryos for {{research}} or therapeutic purposes. The most likely purpose for this is to produce embryos for use in stem cell research. This process is also called [...] "research cloning" [...] or [...] "therapeutic cloning." [...] The <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> create cloned human beings (called [...] "reproductive cloning"), but rather to harvest stem cells that can be used to study human development and to potentially treat disease. While a clonal human blastocyst has been created, stem cell lines are yet to be isolated from a clonal source.|$|E
2500|$|The most {{conservative}} measure he proposed {{was a change}} in the electoral laws, which required that voters have lived in their residences for at least three years, and required a certain minimum income. He declared to the Assembly: [...] "Our <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> exclude the poor from voting, but to exclude the vile multitude, those who have handed over the liberty of so many republics to so many tyrants over the years." [...] The law was approved, removing one-third of the voters in France from the voting lists. Thiers did not foresee that Louis-Napoleon, elected by universal suffrage, would later use this law as a weapon against the Assembly to reinforce his own rule. When a friend of Louis-Napoleon asked him if he wasn't afraid of losing power without universal suffrage, he replied, [...] "Not at all. When the Assembly is hanging over the precipice, I will cut the cord." ...|$|E
2500|$|In May 1999, Mayor Giuliani {{advocated}} {{in favor}} of education vouchers, proposing to allocate several million dollars to allow poor children attending poor-performing public schools to attend private schools. [...] In February 2007 reaffirmed his support for [...] "school choice". However, he said his <b>goal</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> end the American public school system. [...] "I would not destroy it. I would revive it, reform it, and change it." ...|$|R
2500|$|One {{reviewer}} {{observed that}} Amos's unfettered creativity due to serving {{as her own}} producer cost the album its accessibility. Amos has stated that her <b>goal</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> make radio-friendly music with universal lyrics, {{and went on to}} say that [...] "a song is only part lyrics and, for me anyway, more than 50% music, easy. There's so much subtext in the music that's part of the story." ...|$|R
50|$|Holberg {{gave the}} go-ahead for the {{development}} of a minicomputer in mid 1962 and was to be a further development of Lydia. The <b>goal</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> make a computer that could compete with commercial models, but instead be tailored for use internally in NDRE for research of computers and simulation. SAM was completed in 1964 and used in-house at NDRE. It was the first Norwegian-built computer which could be programmed.|$|R
2500|$|Unger's call {{is for a}} {{revolution}} in our religious beliefs that encompasses both individual transformation and institutional reorganization; to create change {{in the life of}} the individual as well as in the organization of society. The first part of the program of individual transformation means waking from the dazed state in which we live our lives, and recognizing our mortality and groundlessness without turning to the feel good theologies and philosophies. The second part of the program of social transformation means supplementing the metaphysical revolution with institutional practices by creating social institutions that allow us to constantly overthrow our constraints and our context, and to make this overthrow not a one time event but a continuing process. This is the program of empowered democracy that calls for reforms in the market economy, education, politics, and civil society. [...] "The <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> humanize society but to divinize humanity." [...] It is [...] "to raise ordinary life to a higher level of intensity and capability." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the second}} part of the ritual, the aides seek to come close to {{awakening}} the ritualist through sexual stimulation alone. The <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> fully awaken her or him, but rather to bring them to the brink of wakefulness. Not all authors agree that the ritualist seer will be in a state between sleep and wakefulness, instead noting that exhaustion will lead to a trance, or [...] "sleep of lucidity". The ritualist should be neither too tired or uncomfortable to aid in the trance-like state. Once the ritualist reaches a near-waking state, sexual stimulation must stop. The ritualist-seer is then permitted to sink back toward (but not into) sleep. [...] This step is repeated indefinitely until the ritualist reaches a state between sleep and wakefulness in which communing with a higher power may occur. Some say a goal during this time is to not become [...] "lost" [...] in the trance-like state, but to remain open without directing an outcome. The ritualist may also conduct spiritual work while in this state, or witness mystical events. Exhaustion may not be necessary for the ritualist who is [...] "bodily pure," [...] Crowley writes.|$|E
50|$|Leffen {{has stated}} his <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> {{just be the}} best Super Smash Bros player, but the best {{fighting}} game player.|$|E
50|$|He won the Africa Eco Race in 2015 and 2016, {{dominating}} {{completely the}} races, and winning 16 stages. Prior to the 2016 edition, Ullevålseter had stated, his <b>goal</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> win the race, but to raise {{as much money}} as possible for a school in Dakar, founded by Fabrizio Meoni, who died during the Dakar Rallye in 2005. In 2017, Ullevålseter finished second overall behind South African Gev Sella.|$|R
50|$|The <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> merely <b>to</b> {{educate the}} mind, but {{to change the}} person into a better, more caring human with a {{developed}} conscience.|$|R
50|$|In {{this model}} <b>goals</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> set <b>to</b> {{maximize}} relevant magnitudes such as profits,sales and market share. Instead, <b>goals</b> <b>are</b> compromises negotiated by the groups.|$|R

50|$|The CACC's primary <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> send {{all their}} cadets to the military. More of the CACC's cadets have become astronauts, chemists, doctors and other professions than {{have joined the}} military.|$|E
50|$|The {{hospital}} has specially designed programs {{for people who}} are in the final stages of an incurable illness. Their <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> cure the illness, but to make the last stages of life as comfortable as possible.|$|E
2500|$|The first AK {{structure}} designed {{primarily to}} deal with the Soviet threat was NIE (short for [...] "independence", and also meaning [...] ""), formed in mid-1943. NIE's <b>goal</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> engage Soviet forces in combat, but rather to observe and conduct espionage while the Polish government-in-exile decided how {{to deal with}} the Soviets. At that time, the exiled government still believed that a solution leading to Poland's post-war independence could be found through negotiations.|$|R
5000|$|Burden {{described}} the piece as a [...] "complicated roller-coaster system" [...] {{and said that}} the <b>goal</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> create a literal scale model of a city but to evoke a city's energy. The work, he said, anticipates the era of driverless cars that Burden believed would put an end to traffic gridlock. Burden was unspecific about which city the sculpture depicts: [...] "It could be Dubai or India or China. I think ultimately it’s any city." ...|$|R

The photographer worked {{in the tradition of}} 2 ̆ 2 Straight Photography. 2 ̆ 2 The <b>goal</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> document the area but to make images about what one might feel from the subjects rather than images about the subject.
