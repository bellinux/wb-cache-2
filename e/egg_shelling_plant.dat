The {{results indicated that the}} optimum pH for lead removal using 4 types of <b>egg</b> <b>shell</b> was at pH 6, but at this pH final concentration of lead was too low for study of adsorption isotherm. Therefore, unadjustedpH wastewater was used with an initial lead concentration of about 2. 365 mg/L, initial pH of 1. 35 - 1. 45. Unadjusted pH wastewater decreased the use of expensive chemical reagent for adjusting pH and reducedchemical residues in the environment due to basic properties of <b>egg</b> <b>shell</b> which immediately increased the pH of solution. The optimum dose of <b>egg</b> <b>shell</b> was 1. 0 g/ 100 ml of wastewater with a contact time of 90 minutes.

In this study, the nanocomposite biodegradation of the phenol Novolac epoxy and the unsaturated polyester resins was investigated using the <b>egg</b> <b>shell</b> nanoparticle as bioceramic as well as starch and glycerin as natural polymers to modify their properties. The phenol Novolac epoxy resin has a good compatibility with the unsaturated polyester resin. The prepared samples with different composition of materials for specified time were buried under soil and their biodegradation was studied using FTIR and SEM. The FTIR results before and after degradation showed that the presence of the hydroxyl group increased the samples degradation. Also adding the <b>egg</b> <b>shell</b> nanoparticle to samples had a positive effect on its degradation. The SEM results with and without the <b>egg</b> <b>shell</b> nanoparticle also showed that use of the <b>egg</b> <b>shell</b> nanoparticle increases the samples degradation.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effectiveness of feed mixtures with varying proportions of rape cakes to the weight of table eggs, its components, thickness and strength of <b>egg</b> <b>shell.</b> The <b>eggs</b> were from the final laying hybrid ISA Brown reared in the enriched cage system under experimental conditions. An age of laying hens was from 48 to 54 weeks. Egg weight and its components were measured on scales type KERN 440 - 35 N, with an accuracy of 0. 01 g and a maximum weight of 400 g. Egg white weight was calculated. The thickness and strength of the <b>egg</b> <b>shell</b> were measured from the dried samples at 55 Â°C. From each <b>egg</b> <b>shell</b> were cut 3 pcs of samples in the equatorial plane, one sample from the blunt end and one sample from the sharp end. <b>Egg</b> <b>shell</b> thickness was measured by test instrument SOME, type 60 / 0. 01 mm with a range of 0 - 10 mm. <b>Egg</b> <b>shell</b> strength was measured according to test instrument Instron with the small body, having a diameter 4. 48 mm to exert pressure on the <b>egg</b> <b>shell.</b> The obtained data were assessed in the program system SAS, version 8. 2. Based on the results observed in egg weight of our experiment we can conclude that in the group with share 5 % of rape cakes was non-statistically significant (p > 0. 05) decreased egg weight compared to the control group. Egg weight was reduced in the group with share 10 % of rape cakes, which confirmed a statistically significant difference compared to egg weight of control group (p Ë 0. 05).

40|$|ABSTRACT Eggs were {{obtained}} from three strains of brown shell and three strains of white shell commercial layers during 12 28 -day production periods. Forty-eight eggs {{were randomly selected from}} each of six strains during the last week of each period. Shell quality was measured by shell thickness, shell weight, percent shell, shell weight per unit surface area, and shell density. The average shell thickness of the white <b>shell</b> <b>eggs</b> (. 390 mm) was significantly thicker than the brown <b>shell</b> <b>eggs</b> (. 368 mm). The white <b>shell</b> <b>eggs</b> had a significantly higher average shell weight (5. 62 vs. 5. 30) and contained a significantly greater percentage of shell (9. 35 vs. 8. 65) than the brown <b>shell</b> <b>eggs.</b> The white <b>shell</b> <b>eggs</b> had a significantly greater shell weight per unit surface area (72. 97 vs. 78. 43 mg/cm 2) than the brown <b>shell</b> <b>eggs.</b> (Key words: brown <b>shell</b> <b>eggs,</b> white <b>shell</b> <b>eggs,</b> <b>shell</b> quality, shell weight) 1985 Poultry Science 64 : 297 - 30...|$|R

40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} determine the effect of different combination calcium sources and particle size on performance and <b>egg</b> <b>shell</b> quality in layer hens. In the experiment, 198 brown laying hens at 44 week of age were randomly assigned into 11 treatments groups. The experimental diets consisted of different calcium sources (Fine limestone, large limestone, large oyster <b>shell</b> and large <b>egg</b> <b>shell)</b> and their different combination. The experimental unit consisted of a groups of three hens, thus each treatment was replicated six times. Different calcium sources and particle size addition to the laying hens diet had no significantly effect on body weight gain, egg production, egg mass, feed intake, feed conversion ratio, egg specific gravity, <b>egg</b> <b>shell</b> weight, <b>egg</b> <b>shell</b> thickness and <b>egg</b> <b>shell</b> breaking strength but egg weight had significantly affected by the treatments.

40|$|The purpose {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} quality of the table eggs, their damage and soiling in various age of the laying hens (47 - 62 weeks) during the second phase of the laying cycle. The object of the research was table eggs, <b>egg</b> white, <b>egg</b> <b>shell,</b> damage and soiling of the <b>egg</b> <b>shell.</b> The <b>eggs</b> were of the final laying hybrid ISA Brown reared in the non-cage system with deep litter and free range at small-scale breeding. In the breeding system with free range at small-scale conditions were secured requirements for laying hens in accordance with welfare principles. The eggs were collected each day at 4 : 00 pm. Weights of <b>egg</b> and <b>egg</b> <b>shell</b> samples of were measured on scales type KERN 440 - 35 N. A white weight was calculated. Damage and soiling of eggs were investigated under the desk lamp lighting up to 100 W bulb. Statistical evaluation of the results was carried out in the program system SAS. From the existing conclusions of the various scientific and professional published works, it is known that both quality and safety are interrelated. In many works are the risk factors referred together as the quality standards. We found an important fact in assessing the trend of values of the <b>egg</b> <b>shell</b> weight, depending on the age of laying hens. Based on this fact, it can be assumed that the values of <b>egg</b> <b>shell</b> weight were not directly related to egg weight and egg white weight. It follows that the <b>egg</b> <b>shell</b> weight must be assessed comprehensively, and account must be taken of other factors. For the characteristics of the deformed egg shape has been one pc, representing 3. 33 % of the samples taken for analysis of eggs at 53 weeks of age of the total sampled eggs. In the following 56 weeks of age hens laying eggs there was not a deformed shape. The next subsequent sampling 59 weeks of age laying hens were recorded two pcs of eggs with deformed shape, i. e. 6. 67 %. At the last sampling of eggs at age 62 weeks, the number of eggs with deformed shape increased to three pcs, representing 10. 0 % of the sampled eggs for analysis. The sediments on the <b>shell</b> <b>eggs</b> were observed as variable ridge shapes of the shell matter. At the first sampling of eggs at age 47 weeks were found 2 pcs of this defect, representing 6. 67 % of the sampled eggs. The ridges on the <b>egg</b> <b>shell</b> belong to deviations of the natural shell associated with its texture. These defects of <b>egg</b> <b>shell</b> frequently occur depending on the age of laying hens but can also be caused by other factors. In our experiment was studied mainly the age factor of laying hens. It was interested from aspect of clarifying the relation between ridges on the <b>egg</b> <b>shell</b> and weight of the egg, white, egg, respectively. The results of investigated ridges on the <b>egg</b> <b>shell</b> showed that there occurred in every age of laying hens. Their highest number was recorded at age 59 and 62 weeks (5 pcs, i. e. 16. 67 % of the 30 egg samples). After 59 weeks of age was found also reduce the weight of the white and shell and at age 62 weeks of age was reduced <b>egg</b> <b>shell</b> weight. <b>Egg</b> production with calcareous sediments on the shell is probably hereditary. Currently, the consumer prefers the consumption of <b>eggs</b> with brown <b>shell.</b> <b>Egg</b> <b>shell</b> color is determined primarily by genetics of laying hens. The results of our experiments have shown that the occurrence of the dots on <b>egg</b> <b>shell</b> had a shade darker brown colour or bright dots, especially on the ends of the egg. The occurrence of dotted eggs was recorded in each assessed age of laying hens (5 - 7 pcs, i. e. 16. 67 to 23. 33 %), while in the last, evaluated 62 weeks of age even up to 9 pcs. These dots and their occurrence are related to the intensity of pigment deposition in the shell cuticle. The process of distribution of pigment in <b>egg</b> <b>shell</b> is the same as is formed by packing <b>egg</b> <b>shell</b> and therefore the cuticle. With the increasing age of laying hens reduces the intensity of pigment deposition in the <b>egg</b> <b>shell</b> and increases of egg surface area, of the <b>egg</b> <b>shell</b> area, to which the pigment is stored. This fact is confirmed by our results especially at week 62 of age, when occurrence of pigment dots was the highest on the shell and also these eggs had the highest average weight. <!
