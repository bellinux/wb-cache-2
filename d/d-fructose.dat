5|$|Topiramate, a {{derivative}} of the naturally occurring sugar monosaccharide <b>D-fructose,</b> {{has been found}} effective in helping alcoholics quit or {{cut back on the}} amount they drink. Evidence suggests that topiramate antagonizes excitatory glutamate receptors, inhibits dopamine release, and enhances inhibitory gamma-aminobutyric acid function. A 2008 review of the effectiveness of topiramate concluded that the results of published trials are promising, however, as of 2008, data was insufficient to support using topiramate in conjunction with brief weekly compliance counseling as a first-line agent for alcohol dependence. A 2010 review found that topiramate may be superior to existing alcohol pharmacotherapeutic options. Topiramate effectively reduces craving and alcohol withdrawal severity as well as improving quality-of-life-ratings.|$|E

5000|$|Fructokinase (/fruc•to•ki•nase/ -ki´nas), {{also known}} as D-fructokinase or <b>D-fructose</b> (D-mannose) kinase, is an enzyme (...) of the liver, intestine, and kidney cortex. Fructokinase is {{in a family of}} enzymes called transferases, meaning that this enzyme {{transfers}} functional groups; it is also considered a phosphotransferase (or, frequently, a kinase) since it specifically transfers a phosphate group. Fructokinase specifically catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP (the substrate) to fructose as the initial step in its utilization. The main role of fructokinase is in carbohydrate metabolism, more specifically, sucrose and fructose metabolism. The reaction equation is as follows: ATP + <b>D-fructose</b> = ADP + <b>D-fructose</b> 6-phosphate. This is notable because in most tissues this reaction is catalyzed by hexokinase (...) [...]|$|E
5000|$|The carbon atom {{at which}} the initial {{deprotonation}} takes place is a stereocenter. If, for example, D-glucose (an Aldose) rearranges to <b>D-fructose,</b> the ketose, the stereochemical configuration is lost in the enol form.
