They spear-fished with spears made of shafts to which hazel tines were attached. Boats were dugouts a few feet wide propelled by paddles constructed of shafts to which leaf-shaped or heart-shaped blades were attached. At one end a layer of clay spread on the bottom supported hot coals, an indispensable source of heat <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to spend {{much time in the}} boat.|$|E
25|$|The {{time machine}} went through several {{variations}} during {{production of the}} first film, Back to the Future. In {{the first draft of}} the screenplay, the time machine was a laser device that was housed in a room. At {{the end of the first}} draft the device was attached to a refrigerator and taken to an atomic bomb test site. Director Robert Zemeckis said in an interview that the idea was scrapped because he did not want children to start climbing into refrigerators and getting trapped inside. In the third draft of the film the time machine was a car, as Zemeckis reasoned that <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to make a time machine, you would want it to be mobile. The specific choice of vehicle was a DeLorean DMC-12 for the purposes of it looking like an alien spaceship due to its characteristic gullwing doors (which were inspired by the Mercedes-Benz 300 SL). However, in order to send Marty back to the future, the vehicle had to drive into a nuclear test site. Ultimately this concept was considered too expensive to film, so the power source was changed to lightning.|$|E

500|$|The short parodies Superman, with John Williams' {{theme from}} the 1978 film playing as Wilson {{changes in the}} booth. It was noted that Leitch's [...] "icy blue" [...] {{cinematography}} differed from the style that director Tim Miller used for the first Deadpool, on which Wernick said [...] "every director brings their take to the material" [...] and they were embracing and writing to his style. The writers wanted {{the opening of the}} short to feel like the opening of Logan, [...] "so <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to see Logan and the first shot came up, you would think it's gonna be Hugh [...] in the hoodie, and then when {{it turns out to be}} Deadpool you realize what's going on." [...] They described the short as an absurd one-off [...] "that's probably something that doesn't fit into a movie. It wouldn't work in the logic of a movie, but Deadpool affords us the opportunity to break rules ... the tone can be more absurd if we feel like it's funny. That was our goal there." [...] The short makes several references to Logan: it is set in front of a theater that is showing the film; a poster for the film is seen in the alley; and Deadpool does an impersonation of Jackman's natural Australian accent. At the end of the short, an apparent book report summarizing Ernest Hemingway's The Old Man and the Sea and seemingly written by Deadpool is quickly shown in a text crawl. This was interpreted to be an allusion to Logan and that film's focus on older characters.|$|E
500|$|IGN {{contributor}} Robert Canning {{gave the}} episode a 7.4 out of 10 rating, writing that he [...] "merely" [...] liked the episode. [...] "It wasn't nearly as fun as I had {{hoped it would}} be. I mean, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to bring Floyd back and name the episode after him, {{it would have been}} nice to give [...] a little spark." [...] The A.V. Clubs Nathan Rabin gave it a C rating, calling it [...] a disappointing episode. In regards to Jason Sudeikis, Rabin commented that he is a [...] "gifted comic actor" [...] but this episode [...] "found him at his hammy, embarrassing worst." [...] Meredith Blake, writing for the Los Angeles Times, remarked that the episode [...] "may have been the worst one yet", and said that when Floyd [...] called Liz a [...] "badger", her heart broke into smithereens, [...] "There's mean-funny, and then there's plain old mean. [...] Liz's love life has become the central butt of the joke on 30 Rock... and it's starting to feel like the writers have run out of ways to be funny without being sadistic." [...] Sean Gandert of Paste said that [...] "Floyd" [...] was not a great episode, [...] "but it's still pretty good by this season's standards, if a somewhat disappointing use of Floyd's return." [...] He explained that part of the episode's problem was that Liz's relationships not succeeding [...] "has become pretty old hat for the show since we've seen it time and time again", and hoped to see her [...] "find a good man and let the show move onto something else for a while." [...] TV Guides Adam Mersel wrote that it [...] "really didn't do it for me. I didn't really laugh out loud much, and the cameo from one of my favorite SNL players came off a bit forced." ...|$|E

2500|$|Tipton {{was never}} {{formally}} {{married in a}} ceremony, but several women had drivers' licenses identifying them as Mrs. Tipton. In 1960, Tipton ended his relationship with Cox to settle down with nightclub dancer and stripper Kitty Kelly (later known as Kitty Oakes), who was known professionally as [...] "The Irish Venus". They were involved with their local PTA and with the Boy Scouts. They adopted three sons, John, Scott, and William. After Tipton's death, Kitty gave several interviews about him and their relationship. In early interviews, she said, [...] "He gave up everything... There were certain rules and regulations in those days <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to be a musician," [...] in reference to breaking into the 1920−30s music industry. William described Tipton as a good father who loved to go on Scout camping trips.|$|E
2500|$|In 1971, Lynch {{moved with}} his wife and {{daughter}} to Los Angeles, where he began studying filmmaking at the AFI Conservatory, a place that he would later describe as being [...] "completely chaotic and disorganized, which was great... you quickly learned that <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to get something done, you would have to do it yourself. They wanted to let people do their thing." [...] He began writing a script for a proposed work titled Gardenback, which had [...] "unfolded from this painting I'd done". In this venture he was supported by a number of figures at the Conservatory, who encouraged him to lengthen the script and add more dialogue, something that he reluctantly agreed to do. Nonetheless, with all the interference on his Gardenback project, he became fed up with the Conservatory and quit after returning to start the second year and being put in first year classes. Dean of the AFI, Frank Daniel, asked Lynch to reconsider, believing {{that he was one of}} the school's best students. Lynch agreed on the condition that he could create his own project that would not be interfered with. Feeling that Gardenback was [...] "wrecked", he instead set about on a new film, which he called Eraserhead.|$|E
