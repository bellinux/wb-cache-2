5|$|What's So Amazing About Grace? sold well at {{secular and}} Christian stores. Its {{popularity}} in the United Kingdom grew in 2003, when the impending Iraq War boosted sales of religious literature in the country. That March, it was the seventh-bestselling religious book in the UK, behind Rick Warren's The Purpose Driven Life, John Ortberg's If You Want to Walk on Water, You've <b>Got</b> <b>to</b> <b>Get</b> Out of the Boat and Eugene H. Peterson's The Message. What's So Amazing About Grace? is Yancey's best-known book, having sold more than 15million copies by 2006. Initially, the book was especially popular among baby boomers. Its popularity helped increase sales of Yancey's 2000 book Reaching for the Invisible God, which appeared on religion bestseller lists immediately after publication. What's So Amazing About Grace? {{is one of several}} books by Yancey that have become international bestsellers.|$|E

According to Bessell, Thorpe said of Scott: [...] "We've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> rid of him", and later: [...] "It is no worse than {{shooting}} a sick dog." [...] Bessell said later that he was unsure whether Thorpe was serious, but decided to play along, by discussing various ways {{of getting rid of}} Scott's body. Thorpe supposedly thought that disposal down one of Cornwall's many disused tin mines offered the best option, and also suggested his friend David Holmes as an appropriate assassin. Holmes, one of four assistant treasurers of the Liberal Party appointed by Thorpe in 1965, had been best man at Thorpe's wedding, and was completely loyal to him.|$|E
500|$|In 1963 Timmons' playing, with Lewis Powers on {{bass and}} Ron McCurdy on drums, was {{described}} by a Washington Post reviewer as [...] "flexible and adventuresome [...] Glossing over everything is an undeniable sheen of church music and spirituals." [...] In 1965 the same reviewer commented that Timmons was employing musicians who were of much lower ability: [...] "Timmons lacks a certain passion but I wonder {{if this is not}} the fault of his sidemen." [...] Timmons started playing vibes in the mid-1960s. He occasionally played organ, but recorded only one track on that instrument – a 1964 version of [...] "Moanin'" [...] on From the Bottom. Recordings as a leader continued, usually as part of a trio or quartet, but, after joining Milestone Records around 1967, Timmons' album <b>Got</b> <b>to</b> <b>Get</b> It! featured him as part of a nonet, playing arrangements by Tom McIntosh.|$|E

Araya asserts, [...] "We basically used whatever money we <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> from point A to point B. When we got back, Brian was like, 'So, where's the money?'

500|$|A {{major concern}} with the second act was the {{effectiveness}} of the characters He and She (later called by Rodgers [...] "Mr. and Mrs. God"), before whom Billy appeared after his death. Mr. and Mrs. God were depicted as a New England minister and his wife, seen in their parlor. The couple was still part of the show at the Boston opening. Rodgers said to Hammerstein, [...] "We've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> God out of that parlor". When Hammerstein inquired where he should put the deity, Rodgers replied, [...] "I don't care where you put Him. Put Him on a ladder for all I care, only get Him out of that parlor!" [...] Hammerstein duly put Mr. God (renamed the Starkeeper) atop a ladder, and Mrs. God was removed from the show. Rodgers biographer Meryle Secrest terms this change a mistake, leading to a more fantastic afterlife, which was later criticized by The New Republic as [...] "a Rotarian atmosphere congenial to audiences who seek not reality but escape from reality, not truth but escape from truth".|$|E

A Florida state fund known as Neighbors to the Rescue [...] with the purpose of distributing money to help recovery efforts for victims of Isaac [...] was activated by the governor. The area already qualified for small business loans due to a state of emergency and after the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) reviewed damage assessments, President of the United States Barack Obama considered a disaster declaration. Initially, FEMA denied a disaster declaration. In response, Governor Scott mailed a letter of appeal to FEMA Administrator Craig Fugate. The appeal was accepted, and on October18, 2012, President Obama issued a disaster declaration for Bay, Collier, Escambia, Franklin, Gulf, Martin, Monroe, Okaloosa, Palm Beach, St. Lucie, and Santa Rosa counties.|$|E

However, Friday began to regularly miss training and Hurley's subtlety was misinterpreted as inaction by the other Reading players, who became unsettled and complained about Friday's conduct. The club became increasingly minded to sell him, but although top-flight clubs Queens Park Rangers and West Ham United were interested, they were reluctant to buy because of Friday's temperament; in Downs's words, [...] "They weren't sure they could handle him". By the end of October 1976, Hurley had given up on attempting to rehabilitate his player, believing that the only solution was to sell him to a bigger team. [...] "The squad needs you but I owe it to the club because I can't have you using drugs," [...] Hurley told Friday. [...] "If I know you're using drugs it won't take them [...] long to find out.

500|$|According to Experience bassist Noel Redding, Hendrix {{told him}} it was about Hendrix's girlfriend in high school, Betty Jean Morgan. [...] Jimi's brother, Leon Hendrix, also felt that it was about Betty Jean, but also {{included}} her sister Maddy, although their house was brown. Shadwick suggests that the song was inspired by Linda Keith, Keith Richards' then-girlfriend and early Hendrix supporter. [...] Keith referred to her friend's Manhattan apartment, with its red velvet walls and decor, as the [...] "red house", and the two frequently stayed there during the summer of 1966. In London in 1970, Hendrix met up with Keith and when he performed [...] "Red House" [...] at the 1970 Isle of Wight Festival, he dedicated the song to her and added [...] "I <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> out of here, because my Linda don't live here no more" [...] to the lyrics. However, Billy Cox, longtime friend and bassist for Hendrix's post-Experience groups, explained, [...] "As far as I know, 'Red House' didn't have any significance in reference to a particular person, place or thing.

500|$|MacDermot {{has claimed}} that the songs [...] "can't all be the same. [...] You've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> {{different}} styles.... I like to think they're all a little different." [...] As such, the music in Hair runs the gamut of rock: from the rockabilly sensibilities of [...] "Don't Put it Down" [...] to the folk rock rhythms of [...] "Frank Mills" [...] and [...] "What a Piece of Work is Man". [...] "Easy to Be Hard" [...] is pure rhythm and blues, and protest rock anthems abound: [...] "Ain't Got No" [...] and [...] "The Flesh Failures". [...] The acid rock of [...] "Walking in Space" [...] and [...] "Aquarius" [...] are balanced by the mainstream pop of [...] "Good Morning Starshine". [...] Scott Miller ties the music of Hair to the hippies' political themes: [...] "The hippies... were determined to create art {{of the people and}} their chosen art form, rock/folk music was by its definition, populist. ...he hippies' music was often very angry, its anger directed at those who would prostitute the Constitution, who would sell America out, who would betray what America stood for; in other words, directed at their parents and the government."

Marseille vectored the heading and height of the formation to Neumann who directed III./JG 27 to engage. Marseille heard 8./JG 27 leader Werner Schröer claim a Spitfire over the radio at 10:30. While returning to base, his new Messerschmitt Bf 109G-2/trop's cockpit began to fill with smoke; blinded and half asphyxiated, he was guided back to German lines by his wingmen, Jost Schlang and Lt Rainer Pöttgen. Upon reaching friendly lines, [...] "Yellow 14" [...] had lost power and was drifting lower and lower. Pöttgen called out after about 10 minutes that they had reached the White Mosque of Sidi Abdel Rahman, and were thus within friendly lines.
