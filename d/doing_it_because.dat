5|$|In late 2008, Aamer Ahmed Khan of the BBC Urdu {{website and}} his colleagues {{came up with a}} novel way of {{covering}} the Taliban's growing influence in Swat. They decided to ask a schoolgirl to blog anonymously about her life there. Their correspondent in Peshawar, Abdul Hai Kakar, had been in touch with a local school teacher, Ziauddin Yousafzai, but could not find any students willing to do so, as it was considered too dangerous by their families. Finally, Yousafzai suggested his own daughter, 11-year-old Malala. At the time, Taliban militants led by Maulana Fazlullah were taking over the Swat Valley, banning television, music, girls' education, and women from going shopping. Bodies of beheaded policemen were being displayed in town squares. At first, a girl named Aisha from her father's school agreed to write a diary, but then the girl's parents stopped her from <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> <b>because</b> they feared Taliban reprisals. The only alternative was Yousafzai, four years younger than the original volunteer, and in seventh grade at the time. Editors at the BBC unanimously agreed.|$|E
500|$|Co-executive {{producer}} Joe Chappelle {{worked as}} the episode director. He commented, [...] "I was so {{looking forward to}} directing 2x04 {{because it was a}} payoff of a full season and three episodes of work. You've been laying all this groundwork of information for all the characters and the backstory. The actors loved <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> <b>because</b> they're earned moments." ...|$|E

2500|$|She echoed this {{sentiment}} in speaking with Billboard about the album and its artistic direction, saying: [...] "Some {{people will do}} gospel when their career fails, but I chose to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> {{at the height of}} the popularity of Destiny's Child. I didn't want to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> was a fad. I wanted to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>it's</b> in me. It's in my heart." ...|$|R

"My solo LP is {{one thing}} that, well, {{to tell you the}} truth, I don't think it should be worth {{releasing}} <b>because</b> I <b>did</b> <b>it</b> a while ago, and I was under a great depression at the time when I <b>did</b> <b>it,</b> <b>because</b> I missed the boys very much.

500|$|Unlike Eragon, Brisingr {{features}} multiple {{points of}} view. Parts {{of the book}} are written in Saphira's perspective {{for the first time}} in the series. Paolini based the dragon's behavior and attitude on the pets and animals he grew up around, particularly his pet cats: [...] "I thought a dragon would be like a cat in some ways, that same sort of self-satisfied attitude." [...] He added that it was challenging to depict scenes from the standpoint of a dragon, but he enjoyed <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> <b>because</b> Saphira [...] "has so many interesting thoughts and opinions." ...|$|E
500|$|Joy Division {{made their}} {{recorded}} debut in June 1978 when the band self-released An Ideal for Living, {{and two weeks}} later a track of theirs, [...] "At a Later Date", was featured on the compilation album [...] (which had been recorded live in October 1977). In the Melody Maker review of the EP, Chris Brazier said that it [...] "has the familiar rough-hewn nature of home-produced records, but they're no mere drone-vendors—there {{are a lot of}} good ideas here, and they could be a very interesting band by now, seven months on". The packaging of An Ideal for Living—which featured a drawing of a Hitler Youth member on the cover—coupled with the nature of the band's name, fuelled speculation about their political affiliations. While Hook and Sumner later admitted to being intrigued by fascism at the time, Morris insisted that the group's obsession with Nazi imagery came from a desire to keep memories of the sacrifices of their parents and grandparents during World War II alive. He argued that accusations of neo-Nazi sympathies merely provoked the band [...] "to keep on <b>doing</b> <b>it,</b> <b>because</b> that's the kind of people we are".|$|E
500|$|Lester {{was offered}} {{producing}} credit but refused, going uncredited for his work. Salkind felt that bringing a second director onto the set meant {{there would be}} someone ready {{in the event that}} Donner could not fulfill his directing duties. [...] "Being there all the time meant he [...] could take over," [...] Salkind admitted. [...] " [...] couldn't make up his mind on stuff." [...] On Lester, Donner reflected, [...] "He'd been suing the Salkinds for his money on Three and Four Musketeers, which he'd never gotten. He won a lot of his lawsuits, but each time he sued the Salkinds in one country, they'd move to another, from Costa Rica to Panama to Switzerland. When I was hired, Lester told me, 'Don't do it. Don't work for them. I was told not to, but I did it. Now I'm telling you not to, but you'll probably do it and end up telling the next guy.' Lester came in as a 'go-between'. I didn't trust Lester, and I told him. He said, 'Believe me, I'm only <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> <b>because</b> they're paying me the money that they owe me from the lawsuit. I'll never come onto your set unless you ask me; I'll never go to your dailies. If I can help you in any way, call me." ...|$|E

Writer Steven Banks said, [...] "It's not just stunt casting to get publicity," [...] and that the reasoning is [...] " [...] do want to meet them [...] " [...] A number of guest stars have accepted to appear on the show after being persuaded by their children who are SpongeBob SquarePants fans. Some of them include Victoria Beckham, Amy Poehler and David Hasselhoff. Others accept to guest appear because they are fans of the show themselves. Actor Johnny Depp, who appeared as Jack Kahuna Laguna in the sixth-season episode [...] "SpongeBob SquarePants vs. The Big One," [...] accepted the guest role on the show because he and his children are fans. Hillenburg described the process, [...] "In the beginning, {{it was hard to get}} people. Most of the people that allow themselves to be on have kids who like the show. Often, they're kids are fans. They're <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> <b>because</b> they want to please the family." [...] SpongeBob SquarePants has a [...] "dream list" [...] of celebrities that the crew would like to appear on the show, which includes actors Michael Caine and Jerry Lewis.

500|$|Travolta's manager Jonathan Krane {{denied that}} the Church of Scientology was playing any part in the production: [...] "I've never even dealt with or talked to the church on this. This is an action-adventure, science-fiction story. Period. The movie {{has nothing to do}} with Scientology." [...] Krane stated that the film had been financed [...] "without a dollar coming from the Scientologists." [...] Some people in Hollywood feared that Travolta was using his box office draw to promote Scientology teachings, and one film {{producer}} stated, [...] "This film could encourage kids to embrace the whole strange world of Scientology." [...] Travolta stated, [...] "I'm <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> <b>because</b> it's a great piece of science fiction. This is not about Hubbard. I'm very interested in Scientology, but that's personal. This is different." [...] In a separate interview Travolta commented on the perceived similarities between Battlefield Earth and Scientology: [...] "Well, they are kind of synonymous… L. Ron Hubbard is very famous for Scientology and Dianetics. On the other hand, he's equally as famous in the science fiction world. So for people to think that… look, I don't want everybody to try Scientology. I don't really care if somebody thinks that. I'm not worried about it. You can't be. The truth of why I'm doing it is because it's a great piece of science fiction. I'm going to be the wickedest 9-foot alien you've ever seen in your life." ...|$|E

[...] "The {{people involved in}} these sites often aren't <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> <b>because</b> they're deviant by nature. They're <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> <b>because</b> they're business people.

2500|$|The first rehearsals {{began in}} February 2012 in New York City. The rehearsals {{on a real}} stage began May 1, 2012 at the Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum. The triangle-shaped stage of the tour {{consists}} of two walkways for Madonna to wade into the crowd and an enclosed area ("The Golden Triangle") where selected fans can {{get close to the}} stage. There is also a huge, three-part video screen that promoters have called the largest in the world. The tour was initially planned to start in Tel Aviv, Israel on May 29, 2012, but was rescheduled to May 31 due to production delays.

He says that he is no longer bound by love or by Emma as [...] "a distraction" [...] from his true goal. He tells her that each time Emma is in trouble, she pushes away all of her loved ones, {{including}} Hook, because she thinks that she can solve all of her problems on her own, and that this trait will keep her as an [...] "orphan" [...] forever. He goes on to tell her that she didn't need any villains to destroy her happiness, because she was already good at doing that to herself. When Emma asks Hook why he's telling her that, Hook says that he's <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> <b>because</b> he wants to hurt her like how she hurt him, before vanishing.
