They also repainted some areas the colours of which were lost because of the <b>efflorescence</b> of salts. Areas of repainting were hatched or treated with a linear brushstroke.

5|$|The unique {{political}} structures of late Middle Ages Italy have led some to theorize that its unusual social climate allowed {{the emergence of}} a rare cultural <b>efflorescence.</b> Italy did not exist as a political entity in the early modern period. Instead, it was divided into smaller city states and territories: the Kingdom of Naples controlled the south, the Republic of Florence and the Papal States at the center, the Milanese and the Genoese to the north and west respectively, and the Venetians to the east. Fifteenth-century Italy {{was one of the most}} urbanised areas in Europe. Many of its cities stood among the ruins of ancient Roman buildings; it seems likely that the classical nature of the Renaissance was linked to its origin in the Roman Empire's heartland.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study is a better {{understanding}} of the distribution and formation of salt <b>efflorescences</b> by mineralogical examination. Dominant sodium sulphate and sodium chloride surface <b>efflorescences</b> were selected for investigation. 24 samples were collected between 1999 and 2005 from 16 sites. The soil types were solonchak and meadow solonetz. Basic soil and groundwater analyses were performed according to the standard methods. Minerals were determined by X-ray diffractometry and SEM combined with microanalysis. The evaporation experiments were carried out in a Sanyo Versatile 350 HT environmental test chamber. It was concluded that common sulphate salts form rare and unique mineral associations on salt affected soils in Hungary. Comparing the groundwater compositions and the mineral associations of surface <b>efflorescences</b> or that of precipitated evaporites of groundwaters, the conclusion can be drawn that groundwater composition is reflected much better by the mineral association of experimentally precipitated evaporates of the groundwater than by the mineral associations of surface <b>efflorescences.</b> These differences suggest that the soil matrix may have an effect on the crystallization of minerals (e. g. gypsum, thenardite) in the <b>efflorescences.</b> The differences also suggest that in the surface <b>efflorescences</b> the precipitation process does not come to the end in all cases (minerals with high solubility are missing). Concerning the data on groundwater level depths in case of different (sodium carbonate versus sodium sulphate and sodium chloride) <b>efflorescences,</b> there is a tendency of declining groundwater table in the sequence of these soils. This difference can be explained by the difference (increase) in the solubility of various salt minerals. It was recognized that the change in the major component of surface efflorescenes in time (i. e. the sodium carbonate and sodium carbonate chloride versus sodium sulphate <b>efflorescences</b> before and after 1998) can be explained by the decline of the groundwater level and by the decreasing hydromorphic influence in the lowland area during the 19 th and 20 th century. Finally it can be stated that the presented research — which mainly focused on mineralogical aspects — has contributed to the earlier knowledge on surface salt <b>efflorescences,</b> which was based only on their chemical composition...|$|R

40|$|Sulfide-rich {{materials}} {{comprising the}} waste at the abandoned Montalbion silver mine have undergone extensive oxidation {{prior to and}} after mining. Weathering {{has led to the}} development of an abundant and varied secondary mineral assemblage throughout the waste material. Post-mining minerals are dominantly metal and/or alkali (hydrous) sulfates, and generally occur as earthy encrustations or floury dustings on the surface of other mineral grains. The variable solubility of these <b>efflorescences</b> combined with the irregular rainfall controls the chemistry of seepage waters emanating from the waste dumps. Irregular rainfall events dissolve the soluble <b>efflorescences</b> that have built up during dry periods, resulting in ‘first-flush’ acid (pH 2. 6 – 3. 8) waters with elevated sulfate, Fe, Cu and Zn contents. Less-soluble <b>efflorescences,</b> such as anglesite and plumbojarosite, retain Pb in the waste dump. Metalrich (Al, Cd, Co, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Zn) acid mine drainage waters enter the local creek system. Oxygenation and hydrolysis of Fe lead to the formation of Fe-rich precipitates (schwertmannite, goethite, amorphous Fe compounds) that, through adsorption and coprecipitation, preferentially incorporate As, Sb and In. Furthermore, during dry periods, evaporative precipitation of hydrous alkali and metal sulfate <b>efflorescences</b> occurs on the perimeter of stagnant pools. Flushing of the streambed by neutral pH waters during heavy rainfall events dissolves the <b>efflorescences</b> resulting in remobilisation and transport of sulfate and metals (particularly Cd, Zn) downstream.

25|$|The early Islamic Empire {{also had}} the highest {{literacy}} rates among pre-modern societies, alongside the city of classical Athens in the 4th century BC, and later, China after the introduction of printing from the 10th century. One factor for the relatively high literacy rates in the early Islamic Empire was its parent-driven educational marketplace, as the state did not systematically subsidize educational services until the introduction of state funding under Nizam al-Mulk in the 11th century. Another factor was the diffusion of paper from China, which led to an <b>efflorescence</b> of books and written culture in Islamic society, thus papermaking technology transformed Islamic society (and later, the rest of Afro-Eurasia) from an oral to scribal culture, comparable to the later shifts from scribal to typographic culture, and from typographic culture to the Internet.

Holding both Church and Empire at bay, these city republics were devoted to notions of liberty.

Differential decay with zones with great damage for the structures (pulverization, detachments, <b>efflorescences)</b> and other zones with less damage (only <b>efflorescences)</b> appeared from the survey conducted in the site.

Sodium sulphate results the main decay agent and it is diffuse homogeneously inside the site. Microclimatic monitoring has detected a microclimatic zoning originated by the semi-confined environment. The zones closest to the outside have a trend very similar to it, instead the most confined one have a great thermal and hygrometric inertia. The comparison between the hygrothermal conditions monitored in the site and those thermodynamic favourable to salt crystallization has finally revealed the reason of the differential decay in site: different microclimatic conditions allow the sodium sulphate crystallisation as <b>efflorescences</b> in the zones most confined, and cryptoefflorescences in the closest to the outside one...|$|R
40|$|The {{transfer}} of reactive bromine {{into the atmosphere}} was recently observed by Honninger et al. [Honninger, G., Bobrowski, N., Palenque, E. R., Torrez, R., Platt, U., 2004. Reactive bromine and sulfur emission at salar de Uyuni, Bolivia. Geophys. Res. Lett. 31, doi: 10. 1029 / 2003 GL 018818] in a large salt pan of the Bolivian Altiplano: the salar de Uyuni. However, bromide {{is considered to be}} an excellent conservative tracer, which leads to the questioning of its actual conservation in surficial geochemical processes. The relation between bromide and lithium, thought to be a conservative component in waters and brines of the Central Andes, points to a depletion of Br relative to Li in Uyuni brines of about 50 - 300 kg/day, a flux close to that measured by Honninger et al. (2004) : >= 200 kg/day. Such values are very low in regard {{to the size of the}} salar (5 - 30 g/km(2) /day). Salt <b>efflorescences</b> have a much higher surface area than a flat salt crust, which should enhance the release of bromine. Leach solutions of salt <b>efflorescences</b> in closed basins of northern Chile are compared to their parent waters. Conservative components should have the same concentration ratios in both solutions. Actually, a strong depletion in Br is observed in the leach solutions, which could suggest a significant release of Br from the salt into the atmosphere. During the rainy season, <b>efflorescences</b> are leached and their dissolved components brought in saline lakes and salars. Evaporative profiles show a slight but noticeable fractionation between Li and Br which could be due to the contribution of Br-depleted leach solutions of salt <b>efflorescences.</b> Therefore, bromide does not behave conservatively in surface waters and brines of the Central Andes. If the loss of Br is really due to its transfer into the atmosphere, then the flux would be much higher than that estimated for the salar de Uyuni alone. Numerous salt pans, saline lakes, and widespread <b>efflorescences</b> covering large land surfaces would contribute significantly more reactive bromine into the atmosphere. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

It is not for nothing that Part One is persistently anti-Catholic in a number of ways despite the fact that in the fifteenth century the entire population of England was nominally Catholic (though not, of course, in 1592). The French are presented as decadently Catholic, the English (with the exception of the Bishop of Winchester) as attractively Protestant." [...] Talbot himself is an element of this, insofar as his [...] "rhetoric is correspondingly Protestant.

[...] "King of kings" [...] is a phrase used in 1 Timothy, 6:15.

The mineral salt types include Ca and Mg sulfates (gypsum, epsomite, hexahydrite, bloedite) as well as mixed Fe 2 + – Fe 3 + hydrated sulfates (copiapite, roemerite). The salt mixtures have variable metal concentrations, including major (> 1 wt %) concentrations of Zn, minor Cu (> 1000 ppm), sub-minor (100 – 1000 ppm) to traces (< 100 ppm) of As and Co as well as traces (< 100 ppm) of Ag, Bi, Cd, Mo, Ni, Pb, Sb, Sn, Tl and W. Copiapite-rich samples exhibit the highest As, Cd and Cu, epsomite–hexahydrite rich samples have the highest Zn, and the gypsum-rich samples show the lowest metal and metalloid concentrations. Dissolution experiments show that all salt mixtures are acid generating due to Fe and Al hydrolysis and resultant pH decrease in the solution. Thus, weathering and leaching of metalliferous smelting slags are accompanied by the mobilisation of metals, metalloids, alkali earth elements and sulfate into pore and seepage waters. Evaporation of seepage waters emanating from the slag dump causes the precipitation of mobilised elements and compounds and leads to their temporary fixation in secondary soluble minerals.

Walloon literature (regional language not French) has been printed since the 16th century. But it did have its golden age, paradoxically, during {{the peak of the}} Flemish immigration to Wallonia in the 19th century: [...] "That period saw an <b>efflorescence</b> of Walloon literature, plays and poems primarily, and the founding of many theaters and periodicals." [...] The New York Public Library possesses a surprisingly large collection of literary works in Walloon, quite possibly the largest outside Belgium, and its holding are representative of the output. Out of nearly a thousand, twenty-six were published before 1880. Thereafter the numbers rise gradually year by year, reaching a peak of sixty-nine in 1903, and then they fall again, down to eleven in 1913. See 'Switching Languages', p.153. Yves Quairiaux counted 4800 plays for 1860–1914, published or not. In this period plays were almost the only popular show in Wallonia. But this theater remains popular in the present-day Wallonia: Theater is still flourishing, with over 200 non-professional companies playing in the cities and villages of Wallonia for an audience of over 200,000 each year. [...] There are links between French literature and (the very small) [...] Walloon literature. For instance Raymond Queneau set [...] Editions Gallimard the publication of a Walloon Poets' anthology.

2500|$|Some {{support for}} the Freudian model comes from {{findings}} of high rates of childhood sexual abuse in conversion patients. [...] Support for the dissociation model comes from studies showing heightened suggestibility in conversion patients,. However, critics argue {{that it can be}} challenging to find organic pathologies for all symptoms, and so the practice of diagnosing patients who suffered with such symptoms as having hysteria led to the disorder being meaningless, vague and a sham-diagnosis, as it does not refer to any definable disease. Furthermore, throughout its history, many patients have been misdiagnosed with hysteria or conversion disorder when they had organic disorders such as tumours or epilepsy or vascular diseases. This has led to patient deaths, a lack of appropriate care and suffering for the patients. Eliot Slater, after studying the condition in the 1950s, stated: [...] "The diagnosis of 'hysteria' is all too often a way of avoiding a confrontation with our own ignorance. This is especially dangerous when there is an underlying organic pathology, not yet recognised. In this penumbra we find patients who know themselves to be ill but, coming up against the blank faces of doctors who refuse to believe in the reality of their illness, proceed by way of emotional lability, overstatement and demands for attention ... Here is an area where catastrophic errors can be made. In fact it is often possible to recognise the presence though not the nature of the unrecognisable, to know that a man must be ill or in pain when all the tests are negative. But it is only possible to those who come to their task in a spirit of humility. In the main the diagnosis of 'hysteria' applies to a disorder of the doctor–patient relationship. It is evidence of non-communication, of a mutual misunderstanding ... We are, often, unwilling to tell the full truth or to admit to ignorance ...
