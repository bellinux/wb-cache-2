500|$|Bruce replied formally, {{saying that}} the funds he had raised in Scotland {{would not have been}} {{forthcoming}} for any other project. There was no further correspondence between the two, beyond a short conciliatory note from Markham, in February 1901, which read [...] "I can now see things <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view,</b> and wish you success"â€”a sentiment apparently not reflected in Markham's subsequent attitude towards the Scottish expedition.|$|E
6000|$|... "Say? What {{can anyone}} say? <b>From</b> <b>your</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view,</b> or his, it's rotten, of course. But in her position, anything's rotten." ...|$|E
6000|$|Somewhat to his surprise, Jake nodded agreement. [...] "No, not <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view.</b> But {{what makes}} you think Kenwardine is dangerous?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, it {{is really}} {{business}} <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> view; and I have come round to that <b>point</b> <b>of</b> view myself. Olive, I want you to marry!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In brief--as you say--leave {{well enough}} alone. Apart from his {{prejudice}} against new-fangled surgery, I'm afraid {{he looks at}} the case <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> view--don't do it, for Leslie's sake." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh," [...] she exclaimed, [...] "you {{can only}} look at it <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> view--can't you {{understand}} yet that there is another? If you had meant to go away you should have gone--some time ago." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I see. But even <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view,</b> {{that would}} {{depend upon the}} artist. Extraordinary talent might make him {{a member of the}} great world!" ...|$|E
60|$|PHOEBE It's awfully {{rough on}} you, Geoffrey. I {{can see it}} <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view.</b> But one can't help remembering {{the things that you}} {{yourself}} have said.|$|E
6000|$|... 'He {{may be a}} School-prefect, Mr Perceval, but {{the fact}} remains that he is a trespasser, and ought <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> to be punished for {{breaking}} bounds.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{would be}} an {{excellent}} plan, <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> view," [...] the governor said. [...] "Teniers {{is one of the}} best sailors on the island, and has several times carried despatches for me to Weymouth. You could not be in better hands." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{may be true}} <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> view," [...] the {{merchant}} said, [...] "but just as the man-at-arms rescued from a circle of foes, or the wounded man carried off the field would assuredly feel gratitude to him who has saved him, so do we feel gratitude to you, and naught that you can say will lessen our feeling towards you both. And now let us to the table." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You must forgive Mademoiselle," [...] said Bellamy, [...] "if she is {{a little}} upset this morning. She knows, of course, as I know and you know, that Von Behrling was playing a desperate game, and that he carried his life in his hands. Yet his death has been a shock--has been a shock, I may say, to both <b>of</b> us. <b>From</b> <b>your</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> view," [...] Bellamy went on, [...] "it was doubtless deserved, but--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Andrew," [...] he said, [...] "perhaps I have behaved badly--at least <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view,</b> but {{remember}} that I warned you. Let us sit down here. Who is your friend?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Say {{that it is}} so," [...] Bervie rejoined. [...] "The {{thing is}} {{remarkable}}, even <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view.</b> And if more coincidences follow, {{the result will be}} more remarkable still." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I say!" [...] he observed, with dismay. [...] "I {{never looked}} at it like that before! I can see that, <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view,</b> this must look like {{a bit of a}} wash-out!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course," [...] she sighed, [...] "it is disappointing {{not to be}} able to lay {{your hands}} upon the thief. That is where I suppose you must find the {{interference}} of an amateur like Mr. Quest a little troublesome sometimes. He gets back the property, which is what the private individual wants, but he doesn't secure the thief, which is, of course, the real end <b>of</b> the case <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> view." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We fancy that we {{have some}} ideas that way, also," [...] he told her. [...] "Wherein do we fail most, <b>from</b> <b>your</b> English <b>point</b> <b>of</b> view?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Down {{even to the}} {{facility}} of your minding everything so little-- <b>from</b> <b>your</b> own <b>point</b> <b>of</b> view--as to have supplied him with the enjoyment of TWO beautiful women." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A {{struggling}} prairie farmer," [...] said Winston quietly. [...] "The {{son of an}} English country {{doctor who}} died in penury, and one who <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> could never have been entitled to more than courteous toleration from any of you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah! Upon Lord Dredlinton? A {{very good}} report <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view,</b> Mr. Wingate. Lord Dredlinton's death {{was due to}} exhaustion, but the doctor {{certifies}} that he was suffering, {{and has been for}} some time, from advanced valvular disease of the heart." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well. These {{matters are}} {{sufficient}} under that head. Now please describe the elephant, and leave out no particular, however insignificant--that is, insignificant <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view.</b> To {{me in my}} profession there are no insignificant particulars; they do not exist." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Incendiary, <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> view--I made, the qualification," [...] Alison replied, {{apparently}} unmoved by his obvious irritation. [...] "I don't {{pretend to}} be a Christian, as you know, but if there is one element in Christianity that distinguishes it, it is the brotherhood of man. That's pure nitroglycerin, though it's been mixed with so much sawdust. Incendiary is a mild epithet. I never read the sermons you refer to; I dare say they're crude, but they're probably attempts to release an explosive which would blow your comfortable social system and its authority into atoms." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You've {{no right}} to talk of losing what's not yours. And even <b>from</b> <b>your</b> own <b>point</b> <b>of</b> view," [...] Isabel added, [...] "you ought {{to know when to}} let one alone." ...|$|R
6000|$|The doctor reflected. [...] "Is it?" [...] he said. [...] "Perhaps you may {{be right}} again. I think it's only indifference, myself. Curiously enough my brother looks at it <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> view--he even used the same word that you used just now. I suppose he found my cynicism beyond the reach of reform. At any rate, he left off coming here. I got rid of him on easy terms. What do you say? That inhuman way of talking is unworthy of me? Really I don't think so. I'm not a downright savage. It's only indifference." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, {{who could}} be {{expected}} to understand?" [...] Rodney groaned; [...] "but it's <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> that we must look at it. It's not only asking too much, it's putting you into a position--a position in which I could not endure to see my own sister." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That," [...] {{returned}} Thorne, [...] "is, perhaps, <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view,</b> no {{more than}} natural. In fact, I'm not sure I could say he was right in everything he has done." [...] He paused a moment. [...] "But, I shouldn't {{like to think that}} your prejudice extends to Lucy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{night you}} would not have Mrs. Heaton here, you said {{something}} that made me very angry, though <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> you were right," [...] she said. [...] "I think we must understand each other once for all. Do you consider it necessary to remind me of the same thing now?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, do it. I {{dare say}} Mr. Morton's quite right. He {{will look at}} these things more <b>from</b> <b>your</b> own <b>point</b> <b>of</b> view. All the Kingsley novels are in the Tauchnitz. By all means do what he says." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{may look}} at it in that way if you will, Andrew, and it's natural enough <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> view; but I take no blame to myself You treated the boy {{as if he had been}} your son, and I thank you with all my heart for your {{kindness}} to him; but I could not forget Leslie of Glenlyon, and I do not blame myself that I have kept the same alive in his mind also. It was my duty to see that the young eagle was not turned into a barn door fowl; but I never thought he was going to use his beak and his claws so soon." ...|$|R
60|$|THE DEVIL. Not that we don't admire your intellect, you know. We do. But I look at {{the matter}} <b>from</b> <b>your</b> own <b>point</b> <b>of</b> view. You don't get on with us. The place doesn't suit you. The truth is, you have--I won't say no heart; for we know that beneath all your {{affected}} cynicism you have a warm one.|$|R
6000|$|... "But if it--hum--led to a correspondence? I mean, Katharine, I take it, {{without going}} into matters {{which seem to}} me a little morbid, I mean," [...] he floundered, [...] "you, <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view,</b> feel that there's nothing disagreeable to you in the notion? If so, you've only to speak, and I never think of it again." ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{returned}} {{in half an}} hour and said, with an air of frank concession, touched with personal grief: [...] "Mr. Hubbard, I can see how, <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view,</b> you were perfectly justifiable in selling your article to the Chronicle-Abstract. My point of view is different, but I shall not insist upon it; and I wish to withdraw--and--and apologize for--any hasty expressions I may have used." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{considered}} that a fortunate occurrence, did you?" [...] said Wally. [...] "Well, perhaps <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> {{it may have}} been. I saw the thing from a different angle. Your uncle had a whangee with him. My friends sometimes wonder what I mean when I say that my old wound troubles me in frosty weather. By the way, how is your uncle?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] Prescott confessed, [...] "when I explained, I {{was more}} afraid of you than of Jernyngham. I wanted to keep your good opinion, and I {{wondered}} whether you had only given it to me because you thought I was Cyril Jernyngham. <b>From</b> <b>your</b> friends' <b>point</b> <b>of</b> view Jack Prescott {{is a very different}} kind of person." ...|$|R
6000|$|So, <b>from</b> <b>your</b> own <b>point</b> <b>of</b> view, {{suppose a}} mind-stuff--[--Greek--]--a noumenal cosmic light such as is shadowed {{in the fourth}} gospel. The brain of a dog will convert it into one set of phenomenal pictures, and the brain of a man into another. But {{in both cases the}} result is the {{consequence}} {{of the way in which}} the respective brains perform their [...] "function." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Tell me, therefore, <b>from</b> <b>your</b> vantage <b>point</b> <b>of</b> cold view, what in [...] {{your mind}} is the cause. Can American Jews do {{anything}} to correct it [...] either in America or abroad? Will it ever come to an end? Will a [...] Jew be permitted to live honestly, decently, and peaceably like the [...] rest of mankind? What has become of the Golden Rule?' ...|$|R
