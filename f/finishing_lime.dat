50|$|The Cowell Lime Works, in Santa Cruz, California, was a {{manufacturing}} complex that quarried limestone, produced lime and other limestone products, and manufactured wood barrels for transporting the <b>finished</b> <b>lime.</b> Part of its area is preserved as the Cowell Lime Works Historic District, which was {{listed on the}} National Register of Historic Places in 2007. In addition to the four lime kilns, cooperage and other features relating to lime manufacture, the Historic District also includes other structures associated with the Cowell Ranch, including barns, a blacksmith shop, ranch house, cook house and workers' cabins. The 32-acre (130,000 m2) Historic District is located within the University of California, Santa Cruz campus, {{to either side of}} the main campus entrance.|$|R
50|$|In 1853 another wing {{was added}} to the house, about 40 ft by 20 ft. Masonry walls were <b>finished</b> with <b>lime</b> plaster inside and out. At various times a workshop, other {{outbuildings}} and a lily pond were added. The original thatched roofs were replaced by corrugated metal.|$|R
50|$|The chapel {{was built}} in the 15th century and later {{expanded}} in the 18th century. The main façade has a cover of stone and the rest is <b>finished</b> in <b>lime</b> stucco, as is traditional in many hermitages of Andalusia. The bell tower is square and is covered by a roof of glazed ceramic.|$|R
5000|$|Only lump stone {{could be}} used, because the charge needed to [...] "breathe" [...] during firing. This also limited {{the size of}} kilns and {{explains}} why kilns were all much the same size. Above a certain diameter, the half-burned charge {{would be likely to}} collapse under its own weight, extinguishing the fire. So kilns always made 25-30 tonnes of lime in a batch. Typically the kiln took a day to load, three days to fire, two days to cool and a day to unload, so a one-week turnaround was normal. The degree of burning was controlled by trial and error from batch to batch by varying the amount of fuel used. Because there were large temperature differences between the center of the charge and the material close to the wall, a mixture of underburned (i.e. high loss on ignition), well-burned and dead-burned lime was normally produced. Typical fuel efficiency was low, with 0.5 tonnes or more of coal being used per tonne of <b>finished</b> <b>lime</b> (15 MJ/kg).|$|R
25|$|In around 1850 {{iron ore}} {{deposits}} were found nearby and Messrs. Merry & Cunninghame, Ironmasters, built {{a row of}} houses for 200 people. John Cunninghame, {{at one point the}} sole proprietor, developed his business by taking loans out against the 'Lands of Chapeltoun', his home. He later became bankrupt and the estate was sequestered. A brickworks was later established near Netherton farm at Horners Corner in the Castlewat plantation to use up the blaes bing produced in the mining of the iron ore, which had ceased in around 1900, but it in turn closed in 1921. It was run by the Reid family. A lime works had existed near Lugton as far back as 1829: it is shown on Aitken's map of Cunninghgame. A modern lime works was more recently established {{at the top of the}} belt of limestone, now worked out, by Reid of Halket and later sold to R. Howie & Sons in 1947. Limestone is now brought to the site from elsewhere and the <b>finished</b> <b>lime</b> is used by farmers, in tarmacadam, previously in the manufacture of pig iron, etc. It had been used as 'Davy Dust' to help settle the coal dust in the mines.|$|R
50|$|For 2008, {{the team}} {{continued}} their campaign of the Acura ARX-01. The team also earned title sponsorship from Patrón Tequila for a three-year contract. Scott Sharp joined {{the team to}} replace Stefan Johansson as David Brabhams co-driver. Over the season, the team gained 3 class finishes {{as well as an}} overall <b>finish</b> at <b>Lime</b> Rock Park, giving Acura its first overall victory. The team finished the season 2nd in the LMP2 championship behind Penske Racing, but was, once again, the most successful of the Acura teams.

50|$|The young driver {{struggled}} {{in his first}} season in the Barber Dodge Pro Series. In 2000 his best results were two ninth place <b>finishes</b> at <b>Lime</b> Rock Park and Vancouver. For 2001 Breuers returned to the series. The American captured his first podium finish. At Cleveland Breuers finished behind Sepp Koster and Matt Plumb. With consistent top ten finishes Breuers finished sixth in the standings. Breuers's third, and final, year in the Barber Dodge Pro Series proved to be his best season. With four podium finishes, including a win at Mid-Ohio, Breuers finished third in the standings.|$|R
25|$|Diodorus {{states that}} the Khufu pyramid was beautifully covered in white, but the top {{was said to be}} capped. The pyramid {{therefore}} already had no pyramidion anymore. He also thinks that the pyramid was built with ramps, which were removed during the <b>finishing</b> of the <b>lime</b> stone shell. Diodorus estimates that the total number of workers was 300.000 and that the building works lasted for 20 years.|$|R
25|$|Keating, Bleekemolen and the No. 33 team stayed {{competitive}} in the summer stretch of races that followed Detroit, frequently relying on great strategy and fast pit stops when the Viper didn’t have the pace of other GTD cars within IMSA regulations. The run included fourth at Watkins Glen, 11th at Canadian Tire Motorsport Park, after a late contact incident while leading, and a third-place <b>finish</b> at <b>Lime</b> Rock Park. The year’s second victory followed one race after Lime Rock at Road America where Keating and Bleekemolen co-drove to the victory for the second-year-in-a-row. The win moved Keating, Bleekemolen and ViperExchange.com to third in the GTD class point standings, putting them in contention for solid championship finish for the first time.|$|R
50|$|The 1984 Can Am {{season was}} the seventeenth {{running of the}} Sports Car Club of America's {{prototype}} series and the eighth running of the revived series. 1984 would mark a major downturn in the series, as Juan Manuel Fangio II would become the last major driver to podium in a Can Am Series race, finishing third at Dallas. The dominant manufacturers were Chevrolet, Hart, BMW {{for the first time}} with a third-place finish at Brainerd, Cosworth, Lola, Ralt, and March. Dominant chassis were VDS, March, Frissbee-Lola, Ralt, and Williams with their first podium with a third-place <b>finish</b> at <b>Lime</b> Rock. Michael Roe was declared champion, with seven wins.

50|$|Although few {{buildings}} remain {{from this}} period there are records of works in 1617, 1618, and 1628-9. A replacement Wallace Tower was built superseding the medieval building. In June 1618 masons {{were working on the}} upper storey and it was decided to make the tower larger. Externally it was <b>finished</b> with <b>lime</b> plaster called harling. At the south side there was a bell house. By 1627 it was discovered that the keeper Sir John Stewart of Methven had neglected the fortress.He was replaced by Sir John Stewart of Traquair who recorded the poor state of the building. Surviving accounts mostly record work on the artillery and the 'foir yet wall' a defence on the southern side. The Scottish Parliament in 1644 judged that the castle was likely to more hurtful than useful to the country.|$|R
50|$|The {{architecture}} of Roma mirrors its sister city of Ciudad Mier on the Mexican {{side of the}} river, as well as Guerrero Viejo upriver. Roma is notable for its buildings of river sandstone, caliche limestone and molded brick, using rejoneado (patterned large and small stones) and sillar (stone laid in an ashlar pattern) masonry techniques. Both methods employ an outer <b>finish</b> of rough <b>lime</b> plaster detailed with bands of smooth colored plaster, characteristic of northern Mexico.|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} colour assays were {{conducted}} {{taking into account}} old bibliographic recommendations and oral testimony regarding traditional lime painting technology from the Alentejo (South Portugal) region. The main objectives were: (a) the colorimetric analysis of paintings made with different limewash preparation methods; (b) the comparison between natural processed red and yellows ochre pigments (‘‘home made’’ and from industrial origin) and synthetic iron oxides in different concentrations and lime proportions; (c) {{the evaluation of the}} colorimetric CIELAB coordinates during the lime carbonation process in coloured mortars and limewashes. The results shows that the evolution of L*, a*, and b* during the carbonation process is independent of pigment concentration and paint thickness but dependent of pigment composition and <b>finishing</b> technique (<b>lime</b> painting or coloured mortar). They also emphasize the importance of surface appearance attributes and its influence on the colorimetric parameters...|$|R
50|$|The bridge has a {{total length}} of 72 ft, with two stone arches, each {{spanning}} 30 ft. It is constructed out of roughly dressed granite; the original 1764 arches are 20 ft wide, with the 1838 addition adding 16 ft. The arch facing {{of the older}} portion is <b>finished</b> with <b>lime</b> and mortar, while the newer is dry laid. The older western spandrel wall is fashioned out of heavily-chinked rubble, while that {{on the eastern side}} is fashioned out of larger blocks that are drill-split rubble. The bridge has low parapets on either side; that on the west is presumed to be original to the bridge's 1764 construction. All of the stone elements have seen numerous repairs and evidence of repointing prior to the 1989 rehabilitation. The central pier has an extended nose on the upstream side of unknown age.|$|R

5000|$|Cure time.There {{is only a}} 24-hour {{wait time}} to {{decorate}} over [...] "one coat" [...] veneer. Cure time is only {{for two or three}} coat plastering that may have <b>lime</b> in the <b>finish.</b> It is recommended to wait a few days or weeks before painting a <b>lime</b> <b>finish</b> wall. Plastering walls with one coat is actually faster than taping since you don't have to wait for three separate coats to dry for 24 hours, as in taping. If heavy patchwork is involved, then yes, there is also await time. However, that is typically for drying time not curing.|$|R
30|$|Up to five {{layers of}} paint are {{present on the}} Pasargadae plaster, constituting the {{remnants}} of a geometric design. The plasters were bound with clay tempered with an organic material that has long since degraded, leaving small voids throughout. Pigments identified include Egyptian blue, malachite green, red ocher, and cinnabar red. The floor fragments from Persepolis were <b>finished</b> with a <b>lime</b> plaster and two layers of hematite-rich paint. The brick fragments from Persepolis were found to be composed of high-silica material similar to faience, which were decorated with alkaline glazes, including a yellow glazed colored with lead antimonate, gray glaze colored with magnesium and iron, and green glazed colored with copper.|$|R
50|$|The {{previous}} Scandinavia House in {{this location}} was a 1909 French neoclassical building <b>finished</b> with <b>lime</b> stone. It {{was owned by}} Grace Rainey Rogers until her death in 1943. Rogers was an avid philanthropist and an art collector;an auditorium in the Metropolitan Museum of Art was named after her. Her house was built by real estate developer Horace Trumbauer from Philadelphia. His chef designer was the first African American architect, Julian Francis Abele. There are three buildings in New York City designed by this architect. The other two are the James B. Duke House at Fifth Avenue and Adelaide L. T. Douglas home at 57 Park Avenue. Both are landmarks and thus protected by law. However, 58 Park Ave building was not. During the last decades of the 20th century, the house served as the United Nations mission of the German Democratic Republic. ASF bought it together with the plot of land for $5 million in 1996. In order to construct the new and modern Scandinavia House by Polshek Partnership Architects, the old building was destroyed. Unfortunately, there is no legacy left of this important work by Abele.|$|R
50|$|Kurt Roehrig started racing cars in {{the late}} 1970s {{alongside}} his brother J. Dana Roehrig. The brothers raced in the 1978 IMSA GT Championship. In a Porsche 911 the duo worked their way up to 18th place after starting 43rd in the 20th Annual Daytona Fire Cracker 400. His debut at the 24 Hours of Daytona, in 1979 ended after 223 laps. For the occasion Roehrig joined Dave White and John Hamilton at D.R. Racing. The following year Roehrig and White, joined by Canadian Francois Laurin failed to qualify their BMW 320i. In 1980 Roehrig also raced a Ford Capri RS 2600 entered by Clay Dopke. Together with Dopke the duo <b>finished</b> twelfth at <b>Lime</b> Rock Park. In 1981 Roehrig achieved his best result at the 24 Hours of Daytona. Roehrig joined Kent Racing along with Walt Bohren and Jim Mullen. The team finished tenth overall, fifth in the GTU class.|$|R
40|$|The {{microstructural}} {{development of}} lime putty is widely recognized and {{commonly associated with}} an increase in quality. Many heritage institutions encourage the systematic application of lime putties in conservation; however, all the issues associated with age are not fully understood. Changes occur during storage underwater, which traditionally took place in pits to prevent carbonation. The properties of mortars, plasters, and decorative <b>finishes</b> formed from <b>lime</b> putties are intimately linked to manufacturing parameters such as storage time. The hydration of calcium oxide was investigated using an environmental scanning electron microscope with particular attention to the nucleation of calcium hydroxide crystals on the surface of calcium oxide. Crystal modifications were monitored. The results obtained confirm and quantify the influence of slaking time in the microstructure of lime putties that is also reflected in the current referred special characteristics of the mortars produced with them, such as greater plasticity, water retention, and reactivity of mortars. The results also emphasize that the most significant microstructural changes of the lime putties start to consolidate after 8 months of slaking and appear to continue to develop, even though at a slower rate, until at least 5 years...|$|R
