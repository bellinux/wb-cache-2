5000|$|Reviewers have praised Asano's art and writing, but {{noted the}} {{limitations}} of the short story format for character development as well as Asano's overuse of character tropes. About.com's Shaenon Garrity called it an excellent debut work which, while not as good as Asano's later works and lacking in some stories, has great art and writing. Deb Aoki called the manga [...] "mysterious, humorous, magical and tragic all at the same time," [...] adding that it [...] "reminds us that living can be the greatest adventure of all." [...] Grant Goodman of PopCultureShock called the manga unique and solid, but felt that half of the chapters were not memorable and that the theme of [...] "life's losers" [...] made the stories feel repetitive and predictable. Carlo Santos of Anime News Network complimented the stories that were slightly surreal as well as Asano's penwork, but disliked the [...] "woe-is-me" [...] facet of the stories. David Welsh of The Comics Reporter disliked the use of overdone tropes in the stories, but praised the design of average-looking characters and the page composition, finding the stories [...] "polished and effective," [...] but not [...] "lingering in the mind". Johanna Carlson of Comics Worth Reading found the traits of the characters to be annoying but said that the detailed and expressive art grounded the story, making it more believable. Leroy Douresseaux of ComicBookBin praised Asano's ability to depict the struggles of young people in the first volume, but felt that this was downplayed by the large number of characters. He called Asano's ability to [...] "balance and compare and contrast what is celebrated and what is ridiculous about life" [...] the most <b>engaging</b> <b>part</b> of the second volume. Publishers Weekly found that Asano's characters were [...] "prone to platitudes" [...] {{but not as much as}} in Solanin, with the shorter stories also making the characters more sympathethic, and called the artwork and storytelling attractive. Al Sparrow of IGN noted the theme of survival in the stories, remarking that Asano portrays youth through an unfiltered lens. Greg McElhatton of Read About Comics found the stories to vary in quality, but called the manga charming and described the art as a [...] "beautifully delicate creation".|$|E
40|$|The current paper {{describes}} {{the building of}} a serious game designed to teach group decision making skills to a unique audience; people who co-ordinate responses to real-world emergencies such as floods, fires, volcanoes and chemical spills. Eighteen participants were recruited and videotaped while playing a paper prototype of the game. Players’ actions within the game were analysed in terms of whether the challenges that are present in real world decision-making environments are also present in the game-world decision making environment. It appears that the defining characteristics of group decision making behaviour, especially the mistakes, are evident in groups that play our game. In addition, the round-based game structure allows a tutor the opportunity to deliver in-depth qualitative feedback without interrupting game play. Thus, the game design should prove to be a valid environment in which to train, practice and evaluate the decision making behaviour of groups and function as a valuable and <b>engaging</b> <b>part</b> of a group decision making skills training course...|$|E

In spite of its importance, it was often a neglected area, and only recently, with the adoption of more agile methodologies, has testing come to the fore. Testers face challenges, including the {{need to be able to}} identify when software is not behaving as expected. Metamorphic Testing (MT) first appeared twenty years ago in an effort to help testers facing the oracle problem (not having a mechanism to determine correct software behavior). Although MT is simple in concept, it has demonstrated very impressive fault-finding ability, and has recently been attracting a great deal of interest. Training students and practitioners to effectively apply MT has become an important goal, but to date, no textbook or guidelines have been made readily available. This paper, written by some of the leading voices in the MT community, is a sharing of some of the experiences, reflections and insights gained through teaching MT (and other related subjects). These experiences indicate that not only is MT effective in industry and at fault-finding, it has the potential to really engage students in creative SE classroom activities...|$|E
40|$|Background: Asthma is {{the most}} common chronic disease in childhood, disproportionately {{affecting}} urban, minority, and disadvantaged children. Individualized care plans supported by daily lung-function monitoring can reduce morbidity and mortality. However, despite 20 years of interventions to increase adherence, only 50 % of US youth accurately follow their care plans, which leads to millions of preventable hospitalizations, emergency room visits, and sick days every year. We present a feasibility study of a novel, user-centered approach to increasing young people’s lung-function monitoring and asthma self-care. Promoting Lung Assessment in Youth (PLAY) helps young people become active managers of their asthma through the Web 2. 0 principles of participation, cocreation, and information sharing. Specifically, PLAY combines an inexpensive, portable spirometer with the motivational power and convenience of mobile phones and virtual-community gaming. Objective: The objective {{of this study was to}} develop and pilot test InSpire, a fully functional interface between a handheld spirometer and an interactive game and individualized asthma-care instant-messaging system housed on a mobile phone. Methods: InSpire is an application for mobile smartphones that creates a compelling world in which youth collaborate with their physicians on managing their asthma. Drawing from design-theory on global timer mechanics and role playing, we incentivized completing spirometry maneuvers by making them an <b>engaging</b> <b>part</b> of a game young people would want to play. The data can be sent wirelessly to health specialists and return care recommendations to patients in real-time. By making it portable and simila...|$|E

(T) he subdiscipline has still yet {{to meet the challenge}} of feminist geography whose concerns for power in place and space from a gender perspective have only appeared intermittently in contemporary political geography. The study of place/space tensions may be one way of integrating feminist geographical con-cerns into political geography (2000 : p. 597). These quotes are the closing words in the ‘political geography ’ entry in the third and fourth editions of The Dictionary of Human Geography. The 1994 entry basically represents feminist geography as the politics of the ‘public–private ’ divide; while the 2000 entry broadens the scope (and possibly the geographic scale?) of the femin-ist challenge, framing it in terms of power and space—a central concern of political geography. (Notably, feminist geography is not even mentioned in the ‘political geography ’ entry in the first two editions.)

The stakeholder (the term "stakeholder" is used in Czech as well) is a subject, i. e. an individual or a corporate body, that is concerned about the result of the project and has the possibility to influence the project. The main goal of the thesis is to map the contemporary approaches toward the stakeholders analysis and management in the ICT projects, to analyze the problems of the influence of individual parts from both technocracy and human (psychological) point of view and to subsequently suggest the methodology for an effective analysis and management of the <b>engaged</b> <b>parts,</b> which could be used at the management of the projects in the ICT field. It is convenient to introduce the used terms and notions, their history and the way of use in the first part. There are dissect the known methodologies and tools used for the analysis and the management of the <b>engaged</b> <b>parts.</b> Subsequently, the stakeholders are systematically divide, it is accomplished their analysis from different perspectives and discussed mainly the aspects which can be crucial in the project management. The most common interests and motivations of the particular <b>engaged</b> <b>parts</b> are presented, including the influence and interest groups and the ways how to procure these parts for the aims of the projects. In the second part a research is described, which is carried out among managers of ICT companies and participants of ICT projects.

50|$|A {{constant-mesh}} transmission {{offers several}} advantages over a sliding-mesh design. First, the dog clutch {{is designed for}} the task, rather than asking the gear to do dual duty of power transmission and sliding engagement. Second, the dog clutch is typically smaller in diameter than the gear it controls, so absolute speeds of the <b>engaging</b> <b>parts</b> are lower, aiding engagement. Thus, while a non-synchromesh transmission still relies on the operator to match speeds, gears are easier to engage. Third, a constant-mesh transmission can easily use helical gears which are smoother, quieter, and can carry more torque for a given size of gear. Fourth, a constant-mesh transmission can use synchromesh for easier shifting; while many heavy vehicle transmissions do not use it, most medium- and light-duty automotive transmissions do.|$|R
