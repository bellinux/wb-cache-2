The most frequent Mediterranean mutations for β-thalassemia are: β 039, β+IVSI- 110, β+IVSI- 6 and β 0 IVSI- 1. Several molecular techniques for the detection of point mutations have been developed based on the amplification of the DNA target by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), but they could be labor-intensive and technically demanding. On the contrary, TaqMan® <b>genotyping</b> <b>assays</b> are a simple, sensitive and versatile method suitable for the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping affecting the human β-globin gene. Four TaqMan® <b>genotyping</b> <b>assays</b> for the most common β-thalassemia mutations present in the Mediterranean area were designed and validated for the genotype characterization of genomic DNA extracted from 94 subjects comprising 25 healthy donors, 33 healthy carriers and 36 β-thalassemia patients.

40|$|Serologic {{determination}} of the Vel- phenotype is challenging due to variable Vel expression levels. In this study we investigated the genetic basis for weak Vel expression levels and developed a high-throughput <b>genotyping</b> <b>assay</b> to detect Vel- donors. In 548 random Caucasian and 107 Vel+(w) donors genetic variation in the SMIM 1 gene was studied and correlated to Vel expression levels. A total of 3366 Caucasian, 621 black, and 333 Chinese donors were screened with a high-throughput <b>genotyping</b> <b>assay</b> targeting the SMIM 1 * 64 _ 80 del allele. The Vel+(w) phenotype is in most cases caused {{by the presence of}} one SMIM 1 allele carrying the major allele of the rs 1175550 SNP in combination with a SMIM 1 * 64 _ 80 del allele or in few cases caused by the presence of the SMIM 1 * 152 T>A or SMIM 1 * 152 T>G allele. In approximately 6 % of Vel+(w) donors genetic factors in SMIM 1 could not explain the weak expression. We excluded the possibility that lack of expression of another blood group system was correlated with weak Vel expression levels. Furthermore, using a high-throughput Vel <b>genotyping</b> <b>assay</b> we detected two Caucasian Vel- donors.

The <b>GenoType</b> <b>assay</b> was validated regarding its analytical sensitivity with blood cultures spiked with reference strains. Approximately 104 CFU per ml were detected. Analytical specificity was calculated with a test panel of 212 reference strains. Of the strains tested, 99 % were correctly identified. Additionally, 279 consecutive blood cultures signaled positive by BACTEC were processed directly, in comparison to conventional methods.

40|$|The {{need for}} {{accurate}} genotyping of human papillomavirus (HPV) infections {{is becoming increasingly}} important, since (i) the oncogenic potential among the high-risk HPV genotypes varies in the pathogenesis of cervical cancer, (ii) monitoring multivalent HPV vaccines is essential to investigate {{the efficiency of the}} vaccines, and (iii) genotyping is crucial in epidemiologic studies evaluating HPV infections worldwide. Various <b>genotyping</b> <b>assays</b> have been developed to meet this demand. Comparison of different studies that use various HPV genotyping tests is possible only after a performance assessment of the different assays. In the present study, the SPF 10 LiPA version 1 and the recently launched Roche Linear Array HPV <b>genotyping</b> <b>assays</b> are compared.

40|$|The {{virulence}} factor internalin A (InlA) {{facilitates the}} uptake of Listeria monocytogenes by epithelial cells that express the human isoform of E-cadherin. Previous studies identified naturally occurring premature stop codon (PMSC) mutations in inlA and demonstrated that these mutations {{are responsible for}} virulence attenuation. We assembled > 1, 700 L. monocytogenes isolates from diverse sources representing 90 EcoRI ribotypes. A subset of this isolate collection was selected based on ribotype frequency and characterized by a Caco- 2 cell invasion assay. The sequencing of inlA genes from isolates with attenuated invasion capacities revealed three novel inlA PMSCs which had not been identified previously among U. S. isolates. Since ribotypes include isolates with and without inlA PMSCs, we developed a multiplex single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) <b>genotyping</b> <b>assay</b> to detect isolates with virulence-attenuating PMSC mutations in inlA. The SNP <b>genotyping</b> <b>assay</b> detects all inlA PMSC mutations that have been reported worldwide and verified in this study to date by the extension of unlabeled primers with fluorescently labeled dideoxynucleoside triphosphates. We implemented the SNP <b>genotyping</b> <b>assay</b> to characterize human clinical and food isolates representing common ribotypes associated with novel inlA PMSC mutations. PMSCs in inlA were significantly (ribotypes DUP- 1039 C and DUP- 1045 B; P < 0. 001) or marginally (ribotype DUP- 1062 D; P = 0. 11) more common among food isolates than human clinical isolates.

These previous studies have revealed that natural recombination is widespread in ILTV and have demonstrated that recombination between two attenuated ILTV vaccine strains generated highly virulent viruses that produced widespread disease within poultry flocks in Australia. In order to better understand ILTV recombination, this study developed a TaqMan single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) <b>genotyping</b> <b>assay</b> to detect recombination between two field strains of ILTV (CSW- 1 and V 1 - 99 ILTV) under experimental conditions.
