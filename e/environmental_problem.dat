5|$|With {{the success}} of these projects, IPF has been doing {{revegetation}} projects along the road below the Top Cut since 2004. Compost blankets were applied to large sections of the soil to replace lost nutrients. In 2009 the foundation began removing metal and rebar snow fences embedded in the soil just below the pass summit during the 1960s as part of an abortive project to increase meltwater capture by the Twin Lakes Tunnel. They were an aesthetic blight as well as an <b>environmental</b> <b>problem,</b> and had to be removed using a team of mules and helicopters due to the wilderness area restrictions. The last fence material was removed in 2012.|$|E
5|$|Although pest insects {{attract the}} most attention, many insects are {{beneficial}} {{to the environment and}} to humans. Some insects, like wasps, bees, butterflies and ants, pollinate flowering plants. Pollination is a mutualistic relationship between plants and insects. As insects gather nectar from different plants of the same species, they also spread pollen from plants on which they have previously fed. This greatly increases plants' ability to cross-pollinate, which maintains and possibly even improves their evolutionary fitness. This ultimately affects humans since ensuring healthy crops is critical to agriculture. As well as pollination ants help with seed distribution of plants. This helps to spread the plants, which increases plant diversity. This leads to an overall better environment. A serious <b>environmental</b> <b>problem</b> is the decline of populations of pollinator insects, and a number of species of insects are now cultured primarily for pollination management in order to have sufficient pollinators in the field, orchard or greenhouse at bloom time. Another solution, as shown in Delaware, has been to raise native plants to help support native pollinators like L. vierecki. Insects also produce useful substances such as honey, wax, lacquer and silk. Honey bees have been cultured by humans for thousands of years for honey, although contracting for crop pollination is becoming more significant for beekeepers. The silkworm has greatly affected human history, as silk-driven trade established relationships between China {{and the rest of the}} world.|$|E

40|$|Managing urban <b>environmental</b> <b>problems</b> is {{an immense}} {{challenge}} for cities in developing countries. Research on inter-urban <b>environmental</b> <b>problems</b> {{suggests that the}} dominant <b>environmental</b> <b>problems</b> in developing or low-income cities are localised, immediate and health threatening. Based on a broad spectrum household survey this thesis explores the residential <b>environmental</b> <b>problems</b> both at the household and neighbourhood levels in different residential areas of Chittagong, the second largest city in Bangladesh, which {{is associated with a}} range of environmental concerns not least due to its hilly and coastal setting. The qualitative survey adopted for this study reveals fresh insights into the nature, causes and consequences of residential <b>environmental</b> management <b>problems.</b> Intra-urban differences in <b>environmental</b> <b>problems</b> among households located in higher-, middle-, and lower-income residential areas are revealed in some details. The household survey shows that households in lower-income neighbourhoods {{were more likely to be}} susceptible to local <b>environmental</b> <b>problems,</b> compared with those in middle- and higher-income residential areas. Analysis of the gender relations and intra-household division of labour finds women and children, particularly in the households of lower-income neighbourhoods, are the major victims of residential <b>environmental</b> <b>problems</b> as they undertake home management responsibilities and spend most of the time in and around home and neighbourhood. The key factors, which contribute to the different <b>environmental</b> <b>problems</b> at household, neighbourhood plus citywide level, identified by both household and qualitative surveys are analysed to suggest steps towards a more effective local urban environmental management framework for Chittagong.

25|$|The <b>environmental</b> <b>problem</b> that {{attracted}} most international attention in Brazil in the 1980s was deforestation in the Amazon. Of all Latin American countries, Brazil {{still has the}} largest portion (66%) of its territory covered by forests, but clearing and burning in the Amazon proceeded at alarming rates in the 1970s and 1980s. Most of the clearing resulted from the activities of ranchers, including large corporate operations, and a smaller portion resulted from slash and burn techniques used by small farmers. Technical changes involved in the transition from horizontal expansion of agriculture to increasing productivity also accounted for decreasing rates of deforestation.|$|E
25|$|Desertification, another {{important}} <b>environmental</b> <b>problem</b> in Brazil, only received international attention following the United Nations Conference on the Environment and Development, {{also known as}} the Earth Summit, held in Rio de Janeiro in June 1992. Desertification means that the soils and vegetation of drylands are egraded, not necessarily that land turns into desert. In the early 1990s, it became evident that the semiarid caatinga ecosystem of the Northeast was losing its natural vegetation through clearing and that the zone was therefore running the risk of becoming even more arid, as was occurring also in some other regions.|$|E
25|$|The {{greatest}} <b>environmental</b> <b>problem</b> the Pygmies seem to {{be facing}} {{is the loss of}} their traditional homeland, the tropical forests of Central Africa. In several countries such as Cameroon, Gabon, Central African Republic and the Republic of Congo this is due to deforestation and the desire of several governments in Central Africa to evict the Pygmies from their forest habitat in order to cash in on quick profits from the sale of hardwood and the resettlement of farmers onto the cleared land. In some cases, as in Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, this conflict is violent. Certain groups, such as the Hutus of the Interahamwe, wish to eliminate the Pygmy and take the resources of the forest as a military conquest, using the resources of the forest for military as well as economic advancement. Since the Pygmies rely on the forest for their physical as well as cultural survival, as these forests disappear, so do the Pygmy.|$|E

40|$|What is {{the nature}} of <b>environmental</b> <b>problems?</b> This article {{attempts}} to illuminate this question by exploring the relationship between <b>environmental</b> ethics, <b>environmental</b> <b>problems</b> and their solution. It does this by examining and criticising the argument contained {{in a recent issue of}} Environmental Values asserting that environmental ethics does not have a role to play in solving <b>environmental</b> <b>problems.</b> The major point made in this rebuttal article is that <b>environmental</b> <b>problems</b> are essentially normative in nature. Therefore, normative discourse, and environmental ethics in particular, do have a crucial role to play in environmental thought and action. The discussion concludes with the judgment that a failure to recognise this essential contribution of normative discourse to environmentalism by committing a conservative empirical reductionism of <b>environmental</b> <b>problems</b> is detrimental to the necessary ethical and social change required to save the world.
