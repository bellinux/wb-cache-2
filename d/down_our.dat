25|$|One {{summer night}} in 1916, near Ploegsteert, Eden had {{to lead a}} small raid into an enemy trench to kill or capture enemy soldiers, so as to {{identify}} the enemy units opposite. He and his men were pinned down in No Man’s Land under enemy fire, his sergeant seriously wounded in the leg. Eden sent one man back to British lines to fetch another man and a stretcher, then he and three others carried the wounded sergeant back with, as he later {{put it in his}} memoirs, a “chilly feeling <b>down</b> <b>our</b> spines”, unsure whether the Germans had not seen them in the dark or were chivalrously declining to fire. He omitted to mention that he had been awarded the Military Cross for the incident, something of which he had made little mention in his political career. On 18 September 1916, after the Battle of Flers-Courcelette (part of the Battle of the Somme), he wrote to his mother “I have seen things lately that I am not likely to forget”. On 3 October, he was appointed an adjutant, with the rank of temporary lieutenant for the duration of that appointment. At the age of 19, he was the youngest adjutant on the Western Front.|$|E

[...] Gibson met Sterling at a science fiction convention in Denver, Colorado in the autumn of 1981, where he read [...] "Burning Chrome"– the first cyberspace short story– to an audience of four people, and later stated that Sterling [...] "completely got it".|$|E

500|$|Harding {{had opposed}} payment of a bonus to veterans, arguing in his Senate address {{that much was}} already being done for them by a {{grateful}} nation, and that the bill would [...] "break <b>down</b> <b>our</b> Treasury, from which so much is later on to be expected." [...] The Senate sent the bonus bill back to committee, but the issue returned when Congress reconvened in December 1921. A bill providing a bonus, without a means of funding it, was passed by both houses in September 1922. Harding vetoed it, and the veto was narrowly sustained. A bonus, not payable in cash, was voted to soldiers despite Coolidge's veto in 1924.|$|E

[...] This move caused some editorial concern in the district: The Alhambra Tribune and News, fearing the choice of a candidate was being taken away from voters in favor of a small group, editorialized that the committee formation was [...] "a step in the wrong direction" [...] and an attempt to [...] "shove Tammany Hall tactics <b>down</b> <b>our</b> throats".|$|E

Michael Ausiello of TVLine reported that the producers included two extra musical performances to fill the extended time slot. Series creator Ian Brennan stated that he believed the extension was granted as there were two songs which would otherwise have been cut for length. He welcomed the additional 24minutes of screen time, and commented: [...] "We're always desperately cutting <b>down</b> <b>our</b> episodes.

500|$|Starting in 1967 and {{continuing}} until 1986, the Albanian government {{carried out a}} policy of [...] "bunkerisation" [...] that saw the construction {{of hundreds of thousands}} of bunkers across the country.

Hoxha envisaged Albania fighting a two-front war against an attack mounted by Yugoslavia, NATO or the Warsaw Pact involving a simultaneous incursion by up to eleven enemy airborne divisions. As he put it, [...] "If we slackened our vigilance even for a moment or toned <b>down</b> <b>our</b> struggle against our enemies in the least, they would strike immediately like the snake that bites you and injects its poison before you are aware of it." ...|$|E

500|$|In one scene, Viswanathan asks Chellappa {{to tell a}} story, {{promising}} to finance his film if he is impressed. Knowing he will not receive any funds, Chellappa decides to scare Viswanathan and narrates a horror story. Nagesh later said this was Gopu's idea; [...] "You know how director Dada [...] tells a story. Just follow the pattern". Nagesh and Balaiah completed shooting the scene in a single take.

The Daily Telegraph favored Rattle and Hum over U2 3D and called U2's performance [...] "unexciting", criticizing how [...] "the cameras, not the band, are doing all the work". The Guardian, which gave a rating of one out of five stars, claimed that U2 appeared to be [...] "four conceited billionaires who are further up themselves than ever".|$|E

[...] In 1961, Connor delayed sending police to intervene when Freedom Riders were beaten by local mobs. The police harassed religious leaders and protest organizers by ticketing cars parked at mass meetings and entering the meetings in plainclothes to take notes. The Birmingham Fire Department interrupted such meetings to search for [...] "phantom fire hazards". Connor was so antagonistic towards the Civil Rights Movement that his actions galvanized support for black Americans. [...] President John F. Kennedy later said of him, [...] "The Civil Rights movement should thank God for Bull Connor. He's helped it as much as Abraham Lincoln." ...|$|E
500|$|Warhawk {{was first}} {{announced}} {{to the public in}} May 2005, with a working build shown at E3 in 2006. This version was the first PlayStation 3 title to be shown with the newly announced Sixaxis motion sensing technology. In February 2007, it was announced that the single player element of the game was to be pulled. This was due to concerns Incognito had over the quality of the single-player campaign, particularly when compared to the multi-player modes. Dylan Jobe, the game's director, stated, [...] "If we were to continue <b>down</b> <b>our</b> single-player/multiplayer approach, it would have resulted in not as good single player or not as good multiplayer". The extra development of the multiplayer mode was used to improve existing elements such as in-game communication, and to implement new features such as On Demand Split Screen, whereby players can easily enter split screen mid-game. Split screen can only be used in battles that allow it. Only unranked servers have the ability to have it and even then, it is an option whether or not the host wants it on or off. It was also revealed {{at the same time that}} Warhawk would be made available for download over the PlayStation Network.|$|E
500|$|Warrack emphasises that Holst {{acquired}} an instinctive understanding—perhaps {{more so than}} any English composer—of the importance of folksong. In it he found [...] "a new concept not only of how melody might be organized, but of what the implications were {{for the development of}} a mature artistic language". Holst did not found or lead a school of composition; nevertheless, he exercised influences over both contemporaries and successors. According to Short, Vaughan Williams described Holst as [...] "the greatest influence on my music", although Matthews asserts that each influenced the other equally. Among later composers, Michael Tippett is acknowledged by Short as Holst's [...] "most significant artistic successor", both in terms of compositional style and because Tippett, who succeeded Holst as director of music at Morley College, maintained the spirit of Holst's music there. Of an early encounter with Holst, Tippett later wrote: [...] "Holst seemed to look right inside me, with an acute spiritual vision". Kennedy observes that [...] "a new generation of listeners... recognized in Holst the fount of much that they admired in the music of Britten and Tippett". Holst's pupil Edmund Rubbra acknowledged how he and other younger English composers had adopted Holst's economy of style: [...] "With what enthusiasm did we pare <b>down</b> <b>our</b> music to the very bone".|$|E
