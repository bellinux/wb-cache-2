The Canadian Jewish Congress was asked to set up a system to ensure {{legitimacy}} of the kosher status of meat in Toronto. In 1954, a Rabbinical Board called the “Vaad Hakashruth of the Canadian Jewish Congress of the Central Region” was established. It then consisted of 12 Rabbis, having grown to 26 members as of 2017. In June 1956, the name of the Vaad Hakashruth was changed to the Council of Orthodox Rabbis, the source of the abbreviation COR. In the early 1960s, COR successfully appealed to Prime Minister John G. Diefenbaker to have Shechita legally approved by the federal government and protected by Canadian law. For many years, Rabbi Gedalia Felder was the chairman of the Vaad Hakashruth, and in 2006, his son Rabbi Yacov Felder became the vice chairman, and eventually the chairman.|$|E

One of the female competitors, Laura Bennett, said that the swim was the hardest part of the course after {{competing}} in the London leg of the 2011 ITU World Championship Series on the Olympic course: “The swim was the most difficult, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> away from everyone.” After the swim there was then a [...] transition zone in front of the main grandstand.

[...] It was {{exhibited at the}} 1932 RAF Hendon Display {{and then went on}} to RAF Martlesham Heath for trials.

[...] Even at Martlesham <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> it off the ground in a reasonable distance. [...] The undercarriage behaviour was also criticised. [...] Because of these concerns over take off performance at English temperatures and altitudes, the Air Ministry did not place an order, judging it would not cope with the [...] hot and high conditions found at many RAF fields across the Empire. Thus J9832 {{was the only one of}} its kind. Indeed, none of the C.16/28 contenders were awarded a production contract.|$|E

Her mother made trouble between them. Then she went to visit her mother in Montreal, and died in the hospital there, so the word came to Ronald. Perhaps he believed it a little too readily, but that he DID believe it I never had a doubt. Her story was that it was another woman of the same name. When she found out Ronald thought her dead she and her mother agreed to let him think so. But when she heard he had got married again she thought she'd better let him know the truth.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Corey smiled wanly. Thirty years before, she {{had married}} the rich young painter in Rome, who said so much better things than he painted--charming things, just the things to please the fancy of {{a girl who was}} {{disposed}} to take life a little too seriously and practically. She saw him in a different light when she got him home to Boston; but he had kept on saying the charming things, and he had not done much else. In fact, he had fulfilled the promise of his youth. It was a good trait in him that he was not actively but only passively extravagant. He was not adventurous with his money; his tastes were as simple as an Italian's; he had no expensive habits. In the process of time he had grown to lead a more and more secluded life. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> him out anywhere, even to dinner. His patience with their narrowing circumstances had a pathos which she felt the more the more she came into charge of their joint life.

60|$|The New Testament is an {{invaluable}} book, though I confess to having been slightly prejudiced against {{it in my}} very early days by {{the church and the}} Sabbath school, so that it seemed, before I read it, to be the yellowest book in the catalogue. Yet I early escaped from their meshes. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the commentaries out of one's head and taste its true flavor.--I think that Pilgrim's Progress is the best sermon which has been preached from this text; almost all other sermons that I have heard, or heard of, have been but poor imitations of this.--It would be a poor story to be prejudiced against the Life of Christ because the book has been edited by Christians. In fact, I love this book rarely, though it is a sort of castle in the air to me, which I am permitted to dream. Having come to it so recently and freshly, it has the greater charm, so that I cannot find any to talk with about it. I never read a novel, they have so little real life and thought in them. The reading which I love best is the scriptures of the several nations, though it happens that I am better acquainted with those of the Hindoos, the Chinese, and the Persians, than of the Hebrews, which I have come to last. Give me one of these Bibles and you have silenced me for a while. When I recover the use of my tongue, I am wont to worry my neighbors with the new sentences; but commonly they cannot see that there is any wit in them. Such has been my experience with the New Testament. I have not yet got to the crucifixion, I have read it over so many times. I should love dearly to read it aloud to my friends, some of whom are seriously inclined; it is so good, and I am sure that they have never heard it, it fits their case exactly, and we should enjoy it so much together,--but I instinctively despair of getting their ears. They soon show, by signs not to be mistaken, that it is inexpressibly wearisome to them. I do not mean to imply that I am any better than my neighbors; for, alas! I know that I am only as good, though I love better books than they.|$|E
