5|$|Apart {{from the}} {{question}} of who would represent the Earth as a whole, contact could create other international problems, such as the degree of involvement of governments <b>foreign</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> one whose radio astronomers received the signal. The United Nations discussed various issues of foreign relations immediately before the launch of the Voyager probes, which in 2012 left the Solar System carrying a golden record in case they are found by extraterrestrial intelligence. Among the issues discussed were what messages would best represent humanity, what format they should take, how to convey the cultural history of the Earth, and what international groups should be formed to study extraterrestrial intelligence in greater detail.|$|E
5|$|Flood beds {{in other}} {{locations}} upstream of Lake Lewis such as Ninemile Creek in Montana and the Sanpoil arm of glacial Lake Columbia show a corresponding regularity of flood deposits {{as well as}} deposit grading and rhythmical repetition to those in Lake Lewis. Since Glacial Lake Columbia remained filled, annual deposits (varves) can be observed between flood deposits. The flood deposits can be distinguished from annually deposited varves by both their thickness {{and the presence of}} materials <b>foreign</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> immediate drainage. Atwater reports from 35 to 55 annual varves between flood deposits in Lake Columbia, supporting a period of 35 to 55 years between ice dam failures.|$|E

In some Okinawan writing systems, a small ぃ is also combined with the kana く (ku) and ふ to form the digraphs くぃ kwi and ふぃ hwi respectively, although the Ryukyu University system uses the kana ゐ/ヰ instead.|$|E
25|$|Foreign body is {{an object}} <b>foreign</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> body that becomes {{lodged in the}} {{gastrointestinal}} tract (or {{other part of the}} dog). Dogs are susceptible to gastrointestinal obstruction due to their ability to swallow relatively large objects and pass them through the esophagus. Foreign bodies most commonly become lodged in the stomach because of the inability to pass through the pyloric sphincter, and in the jejunum.|$|E
25|$|ADRs are {{one type}} of {{depositary}} receipt (DR), which are any negotiable securities that represent securities of companies that are <b>foreign</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> market on which the DR trades.

Companies may choose to issue depository receipts in another jurisdiction {{for a host of}} commercial reasons including signalling to their investors and clients about their enhanced corporate governance standard.|$|E

25|$|The bishops {{are not to}} labour for {{conformity}} {{among the}} dioceses in customs that are <b>foreign</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> discipline of the universal Church, for thus {{the appearance of a}} national Church would be introduced. The cardinal-prefect added that the Holy See tolerated relaxations of the common law of the Church for grave reasons, but such derogations were not to be confirmed and extended, but rather every effort was to be made to bring about the observance of the universal discipline. As to the method of adult baptism, the Holy See extended the dispensations to use the short formula for another five years.|$|E
25|$|The Church {{gradually}} {{spread throughout}} the Roman Empire and beyond, gaining major establishments {{in cities such as}} Jerusalem, Antioch, and Edessa. It also became a widely persecuted religion. It was condemned by the Jewish authorities as a heresy (see also Rejection of Jesus). The Roman authorities persecuted it because, like Judaism, its monotheistic teachings were fundamentally <b>foreign</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> polytheistic traditions of the ancient world and a challenge to the imperial cult. The Church grew rapidly until finally legalized and then promoted by Emperors Constantine and Theodosius I in the 4th century as the state church of the Roman Empire.|$|E
25|$|Kublai and {{his fellow}} rulers {{encouraged}} trade between China and other Khanates of the Mongol Empire. During this era, trade between China and the Middle East increased, and many Arabs, Persians, and other foreigners entered China, some permanently immigrating. It was during this period that Marco Polo visited China. Although Kublai Khan wished to identify with his Chinese subjects, Mongol rule was strict and <b>foreign</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Chinese. Civil service examinations, the traditional way that Chinese elites entered the government, was ended, and most government positions were held by non-Chinese, especially the financial administration of the state.|$|E

25|$|The {{fundamental}} {{division of}} the material and spiritual is not altogether <b>foreign</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Avesta; Geti and Mainyu (middle Persian: menog) are terms in Mazdaist tradition, where Ahura Mazda {{is said to have}} created all first in its spiritual, then later in its material form. But the material Zurvanites redefined menog to suit Aristotelian principles to mean ‘that which did not (yet) have matter’, or alternatively, ‘that which was still the unformed primal matter’. Even this is not necessarily a violation of orthodox Zoroastrian tradition, since the divinity Vayu is present in the middle space between Ormuzd and Ahriman, the void separating the kingdoms of light and darkness.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to conferring MDR in tumor cells, ABC transporters are also {{expressed in the}} membranes of healthy cells, where they facilitate the transport of various endogenous substances, {{as well as of}} substances <b>foreign</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> body. For instance, ABC transporters such as Pgp, the MRPs and BCRP limit the absorption of many drugs from the intestine, and pump drugs from the liver cells to the bile as a means of removing foreign substances from the body. A large number of drugs are either transported by ABC transporters themselves or affect the transport of other drugs. The latter scenario can lead to drug-drug interactions, sometimes resulting in altered effects of the drugs.|$|E
25|$|Méhul's main musical {{concern was}} that {{everything}} should serve to increase the dramatic impact. As his admirer Berlioz wrote: was fully convinced that in truly dramatic music, when {{the importance of the}} situation deserves the sacrifice, the composer should not hesitate as between a pretty musical effect that is <b>foreign</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> scenic or dramatic character, and a series of accents that are true but do not yield any surface pleasure. He was convinced that musical expressiveness is a lovely flower, delicate and rare, of exquisite fragrance, which does not bloom without culture, and which a breath can wither; that it does not dwell in melody alone, but that everything concurs either to create or destroy it – melody, harmony, modulation, rhythm, instrumentation, the choice of deep or high registers for the voices or instruments, a quick or slow tempo, and the several degrees of volume in the sound emitted.|$|E
