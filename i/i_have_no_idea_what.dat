500|$|While {{the music}} of Henry Cow was highly orchestrated and structured, Frith also began to {{experiment}} with unstructured music, using prepared instruments and chance composition. In June 1974, {{after the release of}} Henry Cow's second album, Virgin Records (Henry Cow's record label) commissioned a solo record from Frith. They were impressed with his musical ability and gave him free rein to record whatever he wanted. In a 2001 radio interview, Frith said he used the opportunity as a challenge: [...] "I said to myself ... in two weeks time I'm going to go into the studio and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> I'm going to do and I'm going to kind of reinvent the instrument for myself." [...] Frith spent four days in July 1974 recording at the Kaleidophon Studios in London, and the resulting experimentation and the process of galvanisation and pressure led to the [...] "radical approach to the guitar" [...] on the album. In October 1974, Virgin released the album as Guitar Solos on their budget label, Caroline Records.|$|E
500|$|During {{a trip to}} California on Republican Party {{business}} {{in the summer of}} 1973, Bundy rekindled his relationship with Brooks, who marveled at his transformation into a serious, dedicated professional seemingly on the cusp of a distinguished legal and political career. He continued to date Kloepfer as well, though neither woman was aware of the other's existence. In the fall of 1973 Bundy matriculated at UPS Law School and continued courting Brooks, who flew to Seattle several times to stay with him. They discussed marriage; at one point he introduced her to Davis as his fiancée. In January 1974, however, he abruptly broke off all contact; her phone calls and letters went unreturned. Finally reaching him by phone a month later, Brooks demanded to know why Bundy had unilaterally ended their relationship without explanation. In a flat, calm voice, he replied, [...] "Stephanie, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> you mean" [...] and hung up. She never heard from him again. [...] He later explained, [...] "I just wanted to prove to myself that I could have married her"; but Brooks concluded in retrospect that he had deliberately planned the entire courtship and rejection in advance as vengeance for the breakup she initiated in 1968.|$|E

2500|$|In a February 2010 {{interview}} with Australian radio station Triple J, Fiasco revealed {{that although the}} album had been submitted to his label, they still had no solid release date for it. He stated: [...] "It's one of the sadder parts of being on a major record label. At a certain point it's out of your hands. About a date for Lasers, it's truly on them. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> they're going to do." [...] It has also been reported that Fiasco had initially recorded B.o.B's [...] "Nothin' on You" [...] as well as [...] "Airplanes" [...] featuring Hayley Williams, but both songs had been rejected by Fiasco's label. Another unreleased song from Lasers was [...] "Who Are You Now" [...] featuring B.o.B, which has leaked onto the internet in March 2011.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the context}} of the 2008 Democratic Primary campaign, Morrison stated to Time magazine: [...] "People {{misunderstood}} that phrase.

I said he was being treated like a black on the street, already guilty, already a perp. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> his real instincts are, in terms of race." [...] In the Democratic primary contest for the 2008 presidential race, Morrison endorsed Senator Barack Obama over Senator Hillary Clinton, though expressing admiration and respect for the latter. When he won, Morrison said she felt like an American for the first time. She said, [...] "I felt very powerfully patriotic when I went to the inauguration of Barack Obama. I felt like a kid." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{album was}} {{packaged}} as a gatefold sleeve designed {{and illustrated by}} Roger Dean, who had also designed the art for Fragile, Close to the Edge (1972), and the band's first live album, Yessongs (1973). Each of them carried a loose narrative thread that Dean did not continue for Tales from Topographic Oceans. The album's design was discussed during an in-depth conversation Dean and Anderson had in 1973 during the band's flight from London to Tokyo via Anchorage, Alaska, during the Close to the Edge tour. Prior to the flight, Dean had completed the front cover to The View Over Atlantis (1969) by John Mitchell, and [...] "the wives and girlfriends made a cake ... and we all had some. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> was in it but from London to Anchorage, I was stoned ... But from Anchorage to Tokyo, I couldn't stop talking. And I was telling Jon all about this book, about patterns in the landscape and dragon lines, and we were flying hour after hour after hour over the most amazing landscapes ... So the idea of ... a sort of magical landscape and an alternative landscape ... that informed everything: the album cover, the merchandising, the stage." ...|$|E
2500|$|On March 1, 2017, Sessions {{came under}} {{scrutiny}} after reports surfaced {{that he had}} contact with Russian government officials during the 2016 U.S. presidential election, even though during his confirmation hearings he denied he had any discussions {{with representatives of the}} Russian government. News reports revealed that Sessions had spoken twice with Russia's ambassador to the United States, Sergey Kislyak. The first communication took place after a Heritage Foundation event at the 2016 Republican National Convention attended by several ambassadors, including the Russian Ambassador Kislyak who spoke with Senator Sessions. The second interaction took place on September 8, 2016, when they met in Sessions's office; Sessions said they discussed Ukraine and terrorism. Sessions released a statement that day, saying [...] "I never met with any Russian officials to discuss issues of the campaign. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> this allegation is about. It is false." [...] U.S. Justice Department spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores said: [...] "There was absolutely nothing misleading about his answer. He was asked during the hearing about communications between Russia and the Trump campaign – not about meetings he took as a senator {{and a member of the}} Armed Services Committee ... Last year, the Senator had over 25 conversations with foreign ambassadors as a senior member of the Armed Services Committee, including the British, Korean, Japanese, Polish, Indian, Chinese, Canadian, Australian, German and Russian ambassadors." ...|$|E

2500|$|Superficial {{received}} negative {{reviews from}} most music critics. Pittnews commented that it [...] "is {{chock full of}} poorly produced, synthesized, and — worst of all — instantly forgettable tracks that are mildly irritating at best, but are usually insufferable." [...] TheChannels said [...] "The lyrics are {{no better than the}} rest of the album. Montag sings about these ideas: how hard it is to handle the paparazzi, how she turns heads everywhere she goes, and how she ignores those that rain on her parade." [...] Limelife gave the album a mixed review, calling some of the songs [...] "catchy", but also said the album [...] "sounds so manufactured, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> Heidi would sound like without all this technology behind her." [...] HollywoodLife was also gave the album a mixed review, writing [...] "Superficial is just as over-produced as you'd expect a Heidi album to be. In fact, there are some points when you can barely hear Heidi's breathy words over busy beats and sporadic whooshing sounds." [...] They did, however, praise the songs [...] "My Parade" [...] and [...] "I'll Do It". Superficial did receive some positive reviews, however, most notably from the LGBT community. Homorazzi gave the album a positive review, and cited songs [...] "Fanatic", [...] "Superficial", and [...] "More Is More" [...] as highlights of the album. MuuMuse also praised the album, calling it [...] "fun", while calling several of the songs [...] "guilty pleasures." ...|$|E
2500|$|It was {{mentioned}} that the underground passage runs under Feathered Serpent Temple, and the entrance is located a few meters away from the temple at the expected place, designedly sealed with large boulders nearly 2000 years ago. The hole that had appeared during the 2003 storms was not the actual entrance. A vertical shaft of almost 5 meters by side is the access to the tunnel: it goes 14 meters deep, and the entrance leads to a nearly 100 meters long corridor that ends {{in a series of}} underground galleries in the rock. After archaeologists broke ground at the entrance of the tunnel a staircase and ladders that would allow easy access to the subterranean site were installed. Works advanced a painstaking pace very slowly and carefully. Excavating was done manually, with spades. Nearly 1,000 tons of soil and debris were removed from the tunnel. There were large spiral seashells, cat bones, pottery, fragments of human skin. The rich array of objects unearthed included: wooden masks covered with inlaid rock jade and quartz, elaborate necklaces, rings, greenstone crocodile teeth and human figurines, crystals shaped into eyes, beetle wings arranged in a box, sculptures of jaguars, and hundreds of metallized spheres. The mysterious globes lay in both the north and south chambers. Ranging from 40 to 130 millimetres, the balls have a core of clay and are covered with a yellow jarosite formed by the oxidation of pyrite. According to George Cowgill from Arizona State University the spheres are a fascinating find, [...] "Pyrite was certainly used by the Teotihuacanos and other ancient Mesoamerican societies. Originally the spheres would have shown brilliantly. They are indeed unique, but <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> they mean." [...] All these artifacts were deposited deliberately and pointedly, as if in offering to appease the gods.|$|E
