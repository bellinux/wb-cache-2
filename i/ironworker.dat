50|$|Although the violence, {{property}} {{destruction and}} arson {{had been going}} on for years, it intensified after the economic downturn of 2008-2009, as construction work became scarcer. In 2012, <b>Ironworkers</b> union members caused $500,000 in damage to the non-union construction site of a Quaker meetinghouse in Chestnut Hill. In another incident, <b>Ironworkers</b> beat nonunion workers outside a Toys-R-Us store with baseball bats. Some of the violence was directed at union construction sites staffed by other craft unions, such as the Carpenters Union, in an attempt to get the work for the <b>Ironworkers.</b>|$|R
25|$|An <b>ironworker</b> is the US {{term for}} a {{tradesman}} (man or woman) {{who works in the}} ironworking industry. A structural/ ornamental <b>Ironworker,</b> erects (or even dismantles) the structural steel framework of pre-engineered metal buildings, single and multi-story buildings, stadiums, arenas, hospitals, towers, wind turbines, and bridges. Ironworkers assemble the structural framework in accordance with engineered drawings. Ironworkers also unload, place and tie reinforcing steel bars (rebar) as well as install post-tensioning systems, both of which give strength to the concrete used in piers, footings, slabs, buildings and bridges. Ironworkers load, unload, place and set machinery and equipment and operate power hoists, forklifts, and aerial lifts. They unload, place and fasten metal decking, safety netting and edge rails to facilitate safe working practices. Ironworkers finish buildings by erecting curtain wall and window wall systems, pre-cast concrete and stone, stairs and handrails, metal doors, sheeting and elevator fronts. Ironworkers perform all types of industrial maintenance as well.|$|E

50|$|In 1867, Trow {{moved to}} Darlington, again {{in search of}} work. The Associated <b>Ironworkers</b> did not organise in the town, so Trow {{transferred}} to the National Association of <b>Ironworkers,</b> led by John Kane. Given his experience, Trow was immediately as secretary of his lodge. The following year, Kane reformed the union as the Amalgamated Malleable <b>Ironworkers</b> of Great Britain, and Trow was elected to its first general council. In 1872, he was elected as both president and assistant secretary of the union, then in 1874 switched the presidency for the post of treasurer, which was made full-time.|$|R

25|$|On 14 August 2008, <b>ironworker</b> Robert Harvey {{was killed}} when {{a portion of the}} Goliath crane {{collapsed}} during dismantlement. Work on the crane's removal was halted for two months while local and federal officials investigated the accident, but the work later resumed and was completed in early 2009. As a result of their investigation, on 13 January 2009 the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration imposed fines totalling $ (equivalent to $ in today's dollars). A barge carrying the crane was christened USS Harvey in honor of the fallen worker and left the shipyard on 7 March 2009 en route to Romania.|$|E
25|$|It was claimed {{even before}} his death that Moscati was a miracle-worker; some {{said that he could}} {{accurately}} diagnose and prescribe for any patient merely by hearing a list of his symptoms, and that he was responsible for impossible cures. Reports of his good works continued well after his death, with further reports that he interceded in impossible cases. Consequently, he was beatified by Pope Paul VI on behalf of the Roman Catholic Church on 16 November 1975. Moscati was canonized on 25 October 1987, by Pope John Paul II. His canonization miracle involved the case of a young <b>ironworker</b> dying of leukemia. The young man's mother dreamed of a doctor wearing a white coat, whom she identified as Moscati when shown a photograph. Not long after this, her son went into remission and returned to work.|$|E
25|$|The puddlers in the union's <b>ironworker</b> locals {{attempted}} to secede in 1907. Angered at the union's decline {{and the way}} national leaders ignored their interests, the puddlers had retained membership throughout the battles with Carnegie and U.S. Steel. Adopting their old Sons of Vulcan name, about 1,250 of the AA's 2,250 puddlers left the union. But the secession did not last. The Sons of Vulcan won recognition from the Lockhart Iron and Steel Company of McKees Rocks, Pennsylvania. But when the new union demanded a massive wage hike in 1910, the union was forced to strike. After the successful strike, fights broke out between returning union members and strikebreakers who had stayed in the plant. The company slowly replaced all the strikers. Weakened, the Sons of Vulcan soon lost recognition at Youngstown Sheet and Tube, and at the A.M. Byers ironworks. The secessionists slowly drifted back into the AA.|$|E
50|$|In 1863, Aucott was {{a founder}} of the Associated <b>Ironworkers</b> of Great Britain, a union for puddlers, based in Brierley Hill. This {{collapsed}} five years later, but Aucott followed many of its members in transferring to the national Amalgamated Malleable <b>Ironworkers</b> of Great Britain. In 1872, he joined the South Staffordshire Iron Trade Conciliation Board, an activity championed by the Malleable <b>Ironworkers,</b> sitting as one of twelve union representatives, and he was elected as the union's president in 1874. When agreements over pay collapsed in 1875, many puddlers in the area went on an unofficial strike, and ignored Aucott's requests to return to work.|$|R

25|$|During {{his years}} in the U.S. House of Representatives Carper sought to gain better control of the Democratic Party {{organization}} in Delaware in hopes of someday becoming governor. Heavily Democratic and with {{over half of the}} population of the state, New Castle County was the key. Its Democratic organization was controlled by Eugene T. Reed, a former <b>ironworker,</b> and an old-time political party boss who was then among several politicians in both parties implicated in illegal money raising practices. To address this corruption and rescue the reputation of the Democratic Party, Carper recruited Joseph E. Reardon, a DuPont Company chemist, as a candidate for New Castle County Democratic Party chairman. By early 1989, he had succeeded in getting Reardon elected, and Reardon replaced Reed at the head of a newly reformed party organization. In 1990 Carper faced a primary challenge from a Reed ally, Daniel D. Rappa, but crushed him convincingly and went on to win election to his fifth term as U.S. Representative.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the early}} 1900s, {{during the third}} great {{immigration}} wave the <b>Ironworker</b> wage in real 2010 US dollars was $9.50 (2010) to $12 (2010) per hour (40 to 50 cents an hour in 1900). Following the imposition of immigration quotas in 1921 wages rose to $17.50 (2010) an hour ($1.37) for a structural <b>ironworker</b> {{just prior to the}} Great Depression and the real wage subsequently only dropped 10% to $16.00 (2010) ($1.05) given the deflation during the depression. However, following the wartime destruction of manufacturing complexes - with the exception of North America, 1956 wages for structural, ornamental, and rebar ironworkers rose to $27.30 (2010) an hour ($3.40). By 1970, through the Coldwar buildup, iron worker wages peaked at $44.80 (2010) ($7.97). [...] Then - following the 1965 new immigration policy and the start of the fourth great migration wave [...] - fell 10% to $40.38 (2010) by 1980 ($15.26), and fell another 20% to $29.90 [...] (2010) per hour ($20.88) by 1990; comparable to the 50's wage rate. With the end of the Coldwar buildup in 1991, <b>Ironworker</b> rates have since stayed constant and were $29.30 (2010) an hour ($24.15) in 2002. In 2010 the mean wage for Ohio ironworkers, both union and nonunion, is $24.66 per hour; the 75th percentile for the nation is 29.51 - likely for the unionized workforce and indicates that for the past 20-years <b>Ironworker</b> wages have been stagnant for various reasons - most prominently the offset in real wages created by debt, today 126% of income compared to 40% in 1952 allowing short-term survival on less than the living wage.|$|E
