40|$|International audienceIn four {{honeybee}} colonies, queens {{were isolated}} on empty combs for 8 consecutive days, {{so that in}} every colony there were 8 combs containing brood of known age. Afterwards, the colonies were dequeened {{and the process of}} emergency queen rearing was observed. The average interval from egg laying to queen cell capping was 8. 8 days and ranged from 7 to 12 days. The average interval from queen cell capping to queen emergence was 7. 2 days and ranged from 5 to 8 days. The whole development time from egg laying to queen emergence was 15. 7 days, ranging from 14 to 18 days. The age of brood at the moment of <b>dequeening</b> positively correlated with both the time of capping and the total queen development time. The average age of brood (at time of <b>dequeening)</b> around which queen cells were built was 3. 0 days. However, higher proportions of queen cells with younger larvae were destroyed; in effect, the age of brood at <b>dequeening</b> from which queens emerged was 3. 4 days...|$|E

40|$|In <b>dequeened</b> {{honeybee}} colonies ovarian activation {{occurs in}} some workers, and the pheromonal bouquets of these laying workers become more queen-like. In the Asiatic honeybee, Apis cerana, {{we compared the}} amounts of 9 -keto- 2 (E) -decenoic acid (9 -ODA), a mandibular gland pheromone component, between non-laying workers from queenright colonies and laying workers from queenless colonies and, further, applied synthetic 9 -ODA to workers to determine whether workers discriminate workers with activated ovaries based {{on the level of}} this compound. Levels of 9 -ODA were higher in laying workers from <b>dequeened</b> colonies than in non-laying workers from queenright colonies. In both queenright and queenless colonies, more workers treated with 9 -ODA were attacked by other workers than were control-treated workers. These results suggest that detection of pseudoqueens in A. cerana is mediated by changes in 9 -ODA.
