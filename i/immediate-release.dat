5|$|In a {{clinical}} trial of 286 subjects, 53.2% of the 141 given <b>immediate-release</b> metformin (as opposed to placebo) reported diarrhea, versus 11.7% for placebo, and 25.5% reported nausea/vomiting, versus 8.3% for those on placebo.|$|E
5|$|Adderall is {{available}} as <b>immediate-release</b> tablets or two different extended-release formulations. The extended-release capsules are generally {{used in the}} morning. A shorter, 12-hour extended-release formulation {{is available}} under the brand Adderall XR and {{is designed to provide}} a therapeutic effect and plasma concentrations identical to taking two doses 4hours apart. The longer extended-release formulation, approved for 16 hours, is available under the brand Mydayis. In the United States, the immediate and extended release (XR) formulations of Adderall are both available as generic drugs, while Mydayis is available only as a brand-name drug.|$|E
5|$|Metformin has an oral {{bioavailability}} of 50–60% under fasting conditions, and {{is absorbed}} slowly. Peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) are reached within {{one to three}} hours of taking <b>immediate-release</b> metformin and four to eight hours with extended-release formulations. The plasma protein binding of metformin is negligible, as reflected by its very high apparent volume of distribution (300–1000l after a single dose). Steady state is usually reached {{in one or two}} days.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, the FDA {{approved}} a sustained-release formulation of bupropion called Wellbutrin SR, {{intended to be}} taken twice a day (as compared with {{three times a day}} for <b>immediate-release</b> Wellbutrin). In 2003, the FDA {{approved a}}nother sustained-release formulation called Wellbutrin XL, intended for once-daily dosing. Wellbutrin SR and XL are available in generic form in the United States and Canada. In Canada, generic XR bupropion is distributed by Mylan. In 1997, bupropion was approved by the FDA for use as a smoking cessation aid under the name Zyban. In 2006, Wellbutrin XL was similarly approved as a treatment for seasonal affective disorder.|$|E
25|$|<b>Immediate-release</b> tablets {{are less}} {{expensive}} than 8-hour extended-release tablets, which are much {{less expensive than}} 12-hour extended-release tablets.|$|E
25|$|Generic <b>immediate-release</b> {{methylphenidate}} {{is relatively}} inexpensive. The average wholesale cost is about US$0.15 per defined daily dose (retail pharmacies normally charge more). However, {{the most expensive}} brand-name extended-release tablets may retail {{for as much as}} $12.40 per defined daily dose.|$|E
25|$|Controlled, slow-release {{versions}} of Sinemet and Madopar {{spread out the}} effect of the levodopa. Duodopa is a combination of levodopa and carbidopa. Slow-release levodopa preparations have not shown an increased control of motor symptoms or motor complications when compared to <b>immediate-release</b> preparations.|$|E
25|$|Methylphenidate was {{originally}} available as an <b>immediate-release</b> racemic mixture formulation under the Novartis trademark name Ritalin, although {{a variety of}} generics are now available, some under other brand names. Generic brand names include Ritalina, Rilatine, Attenta, Medikinet, Metadate, Methylin, Penid, Tranquilyn, and Rubifen.|$|E
25|$|Its {{analgesic}} effects {{take about}} one hour {{to come into}} effect and 2h to 4h to peak after oral administration with an <b>immediate-release</b> formulation. On a dose-by-dose basis tramadol has about one tenth the potency of morphine and is approximately equally potent when compared with pethidine and codeine.|$|E
25|$|Tramadol, {{sold under}} {{the brand name}} Ultram among others, is an opioid pain {{medication}} used to treat moderate to moderately severe pain. When taken by mouth in an <b>immediate-release</b> formulation, the onset of pain relief usually occurs within an hour. It is often combined with paracetamol (acetaminophen) as this is known to improve the efficacy of tramadol in relieving pain.|$|E
25|$|The dextrorotary {{enantiomer}} of methylphenidate, {{known as}} dexmethylphenidate, is {{sold as a}} generic and under the brand names Focalin and Attenade in both an <b>immediate-release</b> and an extended-release form. In some circumstances it may be prescribed instead of methylphenidate, however it has no significant advantages over methylphenidate at equipotent dosages {{and so it is}} sometimes considered to be an example of an evergreened drug.|$|E
25|$|Omeprazole, as well {{as other}} PPIs, are only {{effective}} on active H+/K+-ATPase pumps. These pumps are stimulated in the presence of food to aid in digestion. For this reason, patients should be advised to take omeprazole with a glass of water on an empty stomach. Additionally, most sources recommend that after taking omeprazole, at least 30 minutes should be allowed to elapse before eating (at least 60 minutes for <b>immediate-release</b> omeprazole plus sodium bicarbonate products, such as Zegerid), though some sources say that with delayed-release forms of omeprazole, waiting before eating after taking the medication is not necessary.|$|E
500|$|Analgesics {{should not}} be taken [...] "on demand" [...] but [...] "by the clock" [...] (every 3–6 hours), with each dose {{delivered}} before the preceding dose has worn off, in doses sufficiently high to ensure continuous pain relief. People taking slow-release morphine should also be provided with <b>immediate-release</b> ("rescue") morphine to use as necessary, for pain spikes (breakthrough pain) that are not suppressed by the regular medication.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Immediate-release</b> {{melatonin}} is not tightly regulated {{in countries}} where it is available as an over-the-counter medication. [...] It is available in doses from {{less than half a}} milligram to 5mg or more. <b>Immediate-release</b> formulations cause blood levels of melatonin to reach their peak in about an hour. The hormone may be administered orally, as capsules, tablets, or liquids. [...] It is also available for use sublingually, or as transdermal patches.|$|E
2500|$|Human {{experience}} of acute overdose with zileuton is limited. [...] A patient {{in a clinical}} study took between 6.6 and 9.0grams of zileuton <b>immediate-release</b> tablets in a single dose. [...] Vomiting was inducted and the patient recovered without sequelae. [...] Zileuton is not removed by dialysis.|$|E
2500|$|Oxycodone is {{available}} as single-ingredient medication in immediate release and controlled release. Parenteral formulations of 10mg/mL and 50mg/mL {{are available in}} the UK for IV/IM administration. Combination products are also available as <b>immediate-release</b> formulations, with non-narcotic analgesic ingredients such as paracetamol (acetaminophen) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including aspirin and ibuprofen.|$|E
2500|$|Zileuton (trade name ZYFLO) is an orally active {{inhibitor}} of 5-lipoxygenase, {{and thus}} inhibits leukotrienes (LTB4, LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4) formation, {{used for the}} maintenance treatment of asthma. [...] Zileuton was introduced in 1996 by Abbott Laboratories and is now marketed in two formulations by Cornerstone Therapeutics Inc. under the brand names ZYFLO and ZYFLO CR. [...] The original <b>immediate-release</b> formulation, ZYFLO, is taken four times per day. The extended-release formulation, ZYFLO CR, is taken twice daily.|$|E
2500|$|There are extended-release {{formulations}} of orally administered morphine whose effect last longer, {{which can be}} given once per day. Brand names for this formulation of morphine include Avinza, Kadian, MS Contin and Dolcontin. For constant pain, the relieving effect of extended-release morphine given once (for Kadian) or twice (for MS Contin) every 24 hours is roughly the same as multiple administrations of immediate release (or [...] "regular") morphine. Extended-release morphine can be administered together with [...] "rescue doses" [...] of <b>immediate-release</b> morphine as needed in case of breakthrough pain, each generally consisting of 5% to 15% of the 24-hour extended-release dosage.|$|E
2500|$|One form {{of dietary}} {{supplement}} is inositol hexanicotinate (IHN), which is inositol {{that has been}} esterified with niacin on all six of inositol's alcohol groups. IHN is usually sold as [...] "flush-free" [...] or [...] "no-flush" [...] niacin in units of 250, 500, or 1000mg/tablets or capsules. It is sold as an over-the-counter formulation, and often is marketed and labeled as niacin, thus misleading consumers into thinking they are getting the active form of the medication. [...] While this form of niacin does not cause the flushing associated with the <b>immediate-release</b> products, the evidence that it has lipid-modifying functions is disputed. As the clinical trials date from the early 1960s (Dorner, Welsh) or the late 1970s (Ziliotto, Kruse, Agusti), {{it is difficult to}} assess them by today's standards. One of the last of those studies affirmed the superiority of inositol and xantinol esters of nicotinic acid for reducing serum free fatty acid, but other studies conducted during the same period found no benefit. Studies explain that this is primarily because [...] "flush-free" [...] preparations do not contain any free nicotinic acid. [...] A more recent placebo-controlled trial was small (n=11/group), but results after three months at 1500mg/day showed no trend for improvements in total cholesterol, LDL-C, HDL-C or triglycerides. Thus, so far there is not enough evidence to recommend IHN to treat dyslipidemia.|$|E

50|$|The {{extended}} release oral tablets allow once-daily administration {{by releasing}} the drug more {{slowly in the}} gastrointestinal tract. These tablets contain 35% of the administered dose in an <b>immediate-release</b> form and 65% in a slow-release matrix. Maximum serum concentrations are achieved between 1 and 4 hours after administration. Compared to the 250- and 500-mg <b>immediate-release</b> tablets, the 500-mg and 1000-mg XR tablets provide higher Cmax, but the 24‑hour AUCs are equivalent.|$|E
50|$|Ciprofloxacin <b>immediate-release</b> tablets contain {{ciprofloxacin}} as the hydrochloride salt, and the XR tablets {{contain a}} mixture of the hydrochloride salt as the free base.|$|E
5000|$|Carbidopa/levodopa/entacapone was {{approved}} by the FDA in June 2003 to treat adults with Parkinson’s disease of unknown cause in two scenarios. First, to substitute with equivalent strength of each of the three components for <b>immediate-release</b> carbidopa/levodopa and entacapone previously administered as individual products. Second, to replace <b>immediate-release</b> carbidopa/levodopa therapy (without entacapone) when people experience the signs and symptoms of end-of-dose [...] "wearing-off" [...] but only for people taking a total daily dose of levodopa of 600 mg or less and not experiencing dyskinesias.|$|E
