5|$|In {{the eastern}} Pacific proper (east of 140°W), sixteen {{tropical}} storms and eight hurricanes formed. Four of the hurricanes became major hurricanes by reaching Category3 or <b>higher</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. These numbers {{are close to}} the long-term averages of fifteen tropical storms, nine hurricanes, and four major hurricanes. There were also four unnamed tropical depressions. The only system to enter or form in the central Pacific (between 140°W and the international dateline) was an unusual high-latitude hurricane.|$|E
5|$|The 1989 Pacific {{hurricane}} season officially started on May 15, 1989, {{in the eastern}} Pacific, and June 1, 1989, in the central Pacific, and lasted until November 30, 1989. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northeastern Pacific Ocean. A total of 17 storms and 9 hurricanes formed, which was near long-term averages. Four hurricanes reached major hurricane status (Category3 or <b>higher)</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale.|$|E
5|$|A {{follow-up}} study conducted 14 {{months after the}} original psilocybin session confirmed that participants continued to attribute deep personal meaning to the experience. Almost one-third of the subjects reported that the experience was the single most meaningful or spiritually significant event of their lives, and over two-thirds reported it among their five most spiritually significant events. About two-thirds indicated that the experience increased their sense of well-being or life satisfaction. Even after 14 months, those who reported mystical experiences scored on average 4 percentage points <b>higher</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> personality trait of Openness/Intellect; personality traits are normally stable across the lifespan for adults. Likewise, in a recent (2010) web-based questionnaire study designed to investigate user perceptions of the {{benefits and harms of}} hallucinogenic drug use, 60% of the 503 psilocybin users reported that their use of psilocybin had a long-term positive impact on their sense of well-being.|$|E

5|$|According to Freitas, {{direct contact}} with civilizations {{significantly}} more advanced than humanity {{would have to take}} place within the Solar System, as only the more advanced society would have the resources and technology to cross interstellar space. Consequently, such contact could only be with civilizations rated as Type II or <b>higher</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Kardashev scale, as Type I civilizations would be incapable of regular interstellar travel. Freitas expected that such interactions would be carefully planned by the more advanced civilization to avoid mass societal shock for humanity.|$|E
5|$|Activity in the Eastern Pacific Hurricane Center's (EPHC) area of {{responsibility}} was above average. There were 25tropical depressions, one short of the record set in 1982, which had 26. Only one storm formed in the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's (CPHC) area {{of responsibility}}, Tropical Depression One-C. Six other cyclones entered the CPHC {{area of responsibility}} from the EPHC area of responsibility. In all, 17systems formed, which is two storms above normal. In addition, 9hurricanes were reported during the season, one more than average. An average number(3) of major hurricanes– Category 3 or <b>higher</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale– was also reported.|$|E
5|$|An injury {{at a lower}} {{point on}} the spine does not {{necessarily}} mean better sexual function; for example, people with injuries in the sacral region {{are less likely to be}} able to orgasm than those with injuries <b>higher</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> spine. Women with injuries above the sacral level have a greater likelihood of orgasm in response to stimulation of the clitoris than those with sacral injuries (59% vs 17%). In men, injuries above the sacral level are associated with better function in terms of erections and ejaculation, and fewer and less severe reports of dysfunction. This may be due to reflexes that do not require input from the brain, which sacral injuries might interrupt.|$|E

The Vought design, designated Model 403 by the company, was similar to the company's OS2U Kingfisher, which was then under development to replace the SOC aboard U.S. Navy battleships, but had its monoplane wing moved <b>higher</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fuselage than that of the Kingfisher, and differed in the attachment method used by its single-float landing gear. In addition, the radial engine of the OS2U was replaced by an inline Ranger V-770 in a squared-off cowling.|$|E
5|$|During October 7, {{with warm}} water helping to fuel its intensification, Madeline quickly {{intensified}} into a Category 2 hurricane, and was upgraded to a major hurricane (Category 3 or <b>higher</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale) early on October 8. Based on hurricane hunter reports, Madeline reached its peak sustained winds of 145 mph (230 km/h) and a peak pressure of 940 millibars early on the 8th. This made Madeline a moderate Category 4 hurricane. Later that morning Madeline made landfall to the northwest of Zihuatanejo as a powerful Category 4 hurricane, before it rapidly dissipated over land.|$|E
5|$|Early on September4, the {{hurricane}} moved beneath a large upper-level anticyclone which provided a reprieve from the strong southwesterly wind shear. Although its convective organization {{had yet to}} become fully symmetrical, an eye became increasingly apparent on infrared imagery. The center moved very near the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's buoy 41044—which registered a maximum sustained wind of 90mph (145km/h) and a maximum wind gust of —around 12:00UTC, indicating that Katia had intensified into a Category2 hurricane. Although an eyewall replacement cycle briefly caused the storm's convective pattern to deteriorate, Katia attained major hurricane status—a Category3 or <b>higher</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale—by 12:00UTC on September5. Twelve hours later, the cyclone further intensified into a Category4 hurricane and attained peak winds of 140mph (220km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 942mbar (hPa; 27.82inHg) as its eye warmed, deep convection became much more symmetric about the center, and upper-level outflow expanded.|$|E

5|$|Forecasts of {{hurricane}} activity are issued before each hurricane season by Dr. William M. Gray {{and his associates}} at Colorado State University (CSU) and the Weather Research Center (WRC). A normal season {{as defined by the}} National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has 12.1 named storms, of which 6.4 reach hurricane strength, and 2.7 become major hurricanes. Neither CSU or WRC issued a forecast on the number of major hurricanes, which are Category3 or <b>higher</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. In early 1985, WRC predicted 8named storms and 5hurricanes. The CSU forecast for April 1985 was 11named storms and 8hurricanes. This forecast was not revised in June.

5|$|Hearing is {{important}} for a nocturnal bird of prey, and as with other owls, the tawny owl's two ear openings differ in structure and are asymmetrically placed to improve directional hearing. A passage through the skull links the eardrums, and small differences {{in the time of}} arrival of a sound at each ear enables its source to be pinpointed. The left ear opening is <b>higher</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> head than the larger right ear and tilts downward, improving sensitivity to sounds from below. Both ear openings are hidden under the facial disk feathers, which are structurally specialized to be transparent to sound, and are supported by a movable fold of skin (the pre-aural flap).|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Estelle was {{the first}} major {{hurricane}} of the above-average 1986 Pacific hurricane season. It formed as a tropical depression formed well southwest of the Baja California Peninsula on July 16, and strengthened into a tropical storm within 24 hours. Located within a favorable environment, Estelle intensified into a hurricane on July 18. It attained major hurricane status (Category 3 intensity or <b>higher</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale) two days later. After peaking in intensity at Category 4 strength, Estelle slowly weakened. By July 24, Estelle was no longer a hurricane while passing south of Hawaii. It completely dissipated on July 26 after further deteriorating to a tropical depression. The arrival of the hurricane prompted a hurricane watch for Hawaii, and 200 people evacuated from their homes. Hurricane Estelle produced high waves offshore Hawaii, causing $2 million in damage and two deaths. The remnants of the storm also produced intermittent showers across the state, though there was no major damage.|$|E
5|$|Males {{are known}} to be aggressive, with larger and older turtles being more dominant. Larger males rank <b>higher</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> social {{hierarchy}} often created by wood turtle colonies. In the wild, the submissive turtle is either forced to flee, or is bombarded with physical abuses, which include biting, shoving, and ramming. Larger and more dominant males will sometimes try to remove a subordinate male while he is mating with a female. The defender will, if he does not successfully fight for his position, lose the female to the larger male. Therefore, among males, there is a direct relationship between copulation opportunities and social rank. However, the outcome of encounters between two turtles is more aggression-dependent than size-dependent. The wood turtle that is more protective of his or her area is the victor. Physical bouts between wood turtles (regardless of gender) increases marginally during the fall and spring (times of mating).|$|E
