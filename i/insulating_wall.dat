40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to study the {{temperature}} evolution during the interaction of a plasma with an <b>insulating</b> <b>wall</b> in Polyethylene ((CH 2) n) and Polyoxymethylene ((CH 2 O) n). The plasma is initiated by means of a capacitor bank discharge in a copper fuse wire. Due to the energy release the ablation of the <b>insulating</b> <b>wall</b> produces some insulating vapours in addition to the copper vapours corresponding to the wire vaporization. Using neutral copper line intensity ratio assuming a Boltzmann distribution we obtain a temperature evolution from about 11 000 K to about 24 000 K in the first few hundreds microseconds of the discharge. For later times the copper lines are strongly self-absorbed and make impossible the diagnostic in a spectroscopic way. Hence the temperature is deduced from the comparison between the experimental and calculated electrical conductivity. So for the decrease of the current the temperature evolves from about 21 000 K down to about 6 000 K and depends on the plasma density.

They are also provided with cavity insulation {{to improve the}} thermal comfort of buildings during severe hot and cold weather conditions. However, recent research {{studies have shown that}} cavity insulation reduces the fire performance of load-bearing LSF walls. Therefore, researchers at the Queensland University of Technology proposed the use of externally <b>insulated</b> LSF <b>walls</b> and floors where insulation is sandwiched between the inner and outer layers of plasterboard instead of being placed inside the cavity. This article reviews and evaluates the results from the small- and full-scale fire tests and numerical studies performed on such externally <b>insulated</b> <b>wall</b> and floor systems exposed to standard and code-prescribed parametric fire curves. Comparison of the fire-resistance ratings and time–temperature profiles of the cavity-insulated and externally <b>insulated</b> <b>wall</b> and floor systems confirmed the superior fire performance of externally <b>insulated</b> load-bearing LSF <b>walls</b> and floors compared with cavity-insulated systems.

40|$|Due to the Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) effect, which degrades heat {{transfer}} coefficients by pulsation suppression of external magnetic field, on the electrically conducting flow, {{the wall with}} non-uniform electrical conductivity is employed in a free surface MHD-flow system for {{heat transfer}} enhancement. The non-uniform electrical conductivity distribution of the channel wall may create alternate Lorentz forces along spanwise direction, which can effectively produce flow disturbance, promote mixture, reduce the thickness of boundary layer, and enhance heat transfer. So the heat transfer performances enhanced by some conducting strips aligned with the mean flow direction on the <b>insulating</b> <b>wall</b> of free surface MHD-flow are simulated numerically in this paper. The flow behaviors, heat transfer coefficients, friction factors and pressure drops are presented under different Hartmann numbers.

This research indicates that the modules with three or five conducting strips can obtain better enhancement effect in our research.

Next part of this thesis is finding mutual differences and to set an approximate transition of individual configurations. For the study of the pin-hole discharge a polycarbonate reactor with total volume of 110 ml was used.

A DC high voltage source providing constant power supply up to 500 W was applied on the electrodes. The water solution of NaCl with initial conductivity of 570 S/cm was used as electrolyte. Time resolved electrical characteristics were recorded by a four channel oscilloscope Tektronix TDS 2024 B. Measured parameters were as follows: voltage (by a HV probe Tektronix P 6015 A), current at ballast resistor of 5. 13, sound detected by a piezzo-microphone mounted under the reactor, and light emitted by the discharge was detected by an optical fiber in vicinity of the orifice. Measuring and processing of time resolved electrical characteristics present an accurate description of behavior of the diaphragm and capillary configuration.
