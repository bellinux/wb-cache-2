5|$|On March 16, 2009, the new South Ferry station opened, {{replacing}} the original loop station. The loop station could only accommodate {{the first five}} cars of a train and required the use of <b>gap</b> <b>fillers</b> because of the sharpness of the loop curve. The new station was built as a two-track, full (10-car)-length island platform on a less severe curve, permitting the operation of a typical terminal station. The newer station {{does not have a}} connection to the IRT Lexington Avenue Line, and is underneath the loop station. The MTA claimed that the new station saved four to six minutes of a passenger's trip time and increased the peak capacity of the 1 service to 24 trains per hour, as opposed to 16 to 17 trains per hour with the loop station. This was the first new station to open since 1989 when the IND 63rd Street Line stations opened.|$|E
25|$|Alternatively, the <b>gap</b> <b>fillers</b> may {{be mounted}} on the train, and linked to the door {{operating}} mechanism. They may be found on modern trainsets, like various versions of the Stadler GTW. Train-mounted <b>gap</b> <b>fillers</b> {{eliminate the need for}} careful alignment and, as the driver only gets the signal that the doors have closed when the fillers have fully retracted, require no special synchronization on departure. Moving all active components of the system to the train instead of the platform allows maintenance to be performed in a shop, rather than in the field. The city of Singapore has committed to specifying its newer trains with <b>gap</b> <b>fillers,</b> to reduce the incidence of platform gap accidents in its crowded stations.|$|E
25|$|Tracks 1 and 3 have <b>gap</b> <b>fillers.</b> Track 4 {{does not}} have <b>gap</b> <b>fillers</b> because of the convex curve of the platform. Track 4 can barely fit the three cars of the shuttle; it {{originally}} ended at a wall but now has a small extension for alighting passengers, so the last pair of doors of the train keep one panel disabled for added safety. Track 3 can accommodate trains with four cars as well as space for half a fifth.|$|E
40|$|Este trabalho apresenta a proposta de atribuir ao <b>gap</b> <b>filler</b> a capacidade cognitiva. Diferentemente dos repetidores encontrados no mercado, o <b>gap</b> <b>filler</b> adaptativo tem como função monitorar, de forma autônoma, os canais sintonizados para verificar se a relação de proteção descrita na Resolução n 398 da Anatel está sendo respeitada. Como fundamentos dessa proposta são abordadas as técnicas de sensoriamento do espectro e os conceitos relacionados às áreas de cobertura. Em uma abordagem prática, os testes foram desenvolvidos no Matlab e no GNU Radio, em que se analisa a atuação do <b>gap</b> <b>filler</b> adaptativo em canais reais. This master thesis {{presents}} the proposal of assigning the cognitive ability to a <b>gap</b> <b>filler.</b> Differently {{from the usual}} repeaters found on the market, the adaptive <b>gap</b> <b>filler</b> is able to automatically monitor tuned channels {{with the intention of}} verifying if the protection ratio described in Resolution n 398 from Anatel is being respected. Spectrum sensing techniques and the concepts related to coverage area will be addressed. Tests were carried out on the Matlab and GNU Radio Software with the purpose of analyzing the adaptive <b>gap</b> <b>filler</b> performance on real channels...|$|R
40|$|A {{retainer}} member suitable for retaining a <b>gap</b> <b>filler</b> placed in <b>gaps</b> between adjacent tile members is presented. One {{edge of the}} {{retainer member}} may {{be attached to the}} <b>gap</b> <b>filler</b> and another edge may be provided with a plurality of tab members which in an intermediate position do not interfere with placement or removal of the <b>gap</b> <b>filler</b> between tile members. The retainer member may be fabricated from a shape memory alloy which when heated to a specified memory temperature will thermally activate the tab members to predetermined memory positions engaging the tile members to retain the <b>gap</b> <b>filler</b> in the <b>gap.</b> This invention has particular application to the thermal tiles on space vehicles such as the Space Shuttle Orbiter...|$|R
50|$|The post mission {{management}} team briefing after flight day 2 {{revealed that the}} inspections had found that a <b>gap</b> <b>filler</b> was protruding {{on the port side}} lower wing, not a location of particular concern. The <b>gap</b> <b>filler</b> was not from an area which has been modified since STS-114; it had been with the vehicle since 1982.|$|R
25|$|Because of the {{curvature}} on the platforms, <b>gap</b> <b>fillers</b> {{are used to}} bridge the gap between train and platform; however, the <b>gap</b> <b>fillers,</b> which are under the platform rather than flush with the platform, are not suitable for wheelchair passengers, making the shuttle platforms virtually inaccessible to wheelchair users. Such passengers who need service to Grand Central must use the IRT Flushing Line platforms. An underpass that formerly connected the original side platforms lies between the downtown local track and the other three tracks of the BMT Broadway Line, which runs perpendicular to the shuttle.|$|E
25|$|In {{the years}} after the line's construction, {{increased}} subway ridership led to longer trains, and thus longer platforms, in the 1940s and early 1950s. The City Hall station, built on a tight curve, {{would have been difficult}} to lengthen, and it was also quite close to the far busier Brooklyn Bridge–City Hall station. In addition, the new, longer trains had center doors in each car, which were an unsafe distance from the platform edge. Movable platform extensions were installed to fill the gap similar to the ones at the South Ferry, Brooklyn Bridge–City Hall (which no longer has <b>gap</b> <b>fillers),</b> Times Square, and 14th Street–Union Square stations, which had a similar problem.|$|E
25|$|The South Ferry station, {{which serves}} the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line exclusively, has two tracks and one island {{platform}}, {{and is the}} only IRT platform currently in use. The new station's platform has a slight curve, but unlike the loop stations, can fit all 10 cars of a full-length train without significant platform gaps or <b>gap</b> <b>fillers.</b> The two tracks end at bumper blocks {{at the south end of}} the platform. This station was built as a replacement for the loop station, which was relegated to being used for turn-arounds once the new station opened. Unlike the loop station, this station only can access IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line local trains, and does not connect with the Lexington Avenue Line. It allows 24 trains per hour (or one every 2 minutes and 30 seconds) to terminate at the station.|$|E

25|$|In 2003, {{money was}} {{allocated}} {{for the construction}} of a new station at South Ferry, and in 2005, construction commenced on the new station. Initially, the station's construction had been opposed because of the high cost and low perceived time savings. The South Ferry loop station only accommodates the first five cars of a train, so that the rear five cars of a 10-car 1 train cannot load or unload. Because of the curve at the station <b>gap</b> <b>fillers</b> are required, and as a result the new station was built as a two-track, full (10-car)-length island platform on a less severe curve, permitting the operation of a typical terminal station. The MTA claimed that the new station saved four to six minutes of a passenger's trip time and increased the peak capacity of the 1 service to 24 trains per hour, as opposed to 16 to 17 trains per hour with the loop station.|$|E
500|$|Blizzard Entertainment began {{planning}} {{development on}} StarCraft in 1995, {{shortly after the}} beginning of development for Diablo. The development was led by Chris Metzen and James Phinney, who also created the game's fictional universe. Using the [...] game engine as a base, StarCraft made its debut at E3 1996. The game's success {{led to the development}} of two authorized add-ons, which were both released in 1998. However, neither of the two add-ons were particularly well received by critics. StarCraft also marked the debut of Blizzard Entertainment's film department. Previously, cinematic cut scenes were seen as simply <b>gap</b> <b>fillers</b> that often deviated from the game, but with StarCraft and later Brood War introducing high quality cinematics integral to the storyline of the series, Blizzard Entertainment is cited as having changed this perception and became one of the first game companies to raise the standard regarding such cut scenes.|$|E
2500|$|Because of the curve, <b>gap</b> <b>fillers</b> were required, and {{are still}} used, {{to bridge the gap}} between the {{platform}} and the doors. The now-automated <b>gap</b> <b>fillers</b> previously required manual operation, with a foreman and at least two train crew, all of who could directly see each other; the train crew had to give a signal to the foreman, who pulled a [...] tall wooden lever to manually extend and retract the <b>gap</b> <b>fillers.</b> The <b>gap</b> <b>fillers</b> are also unreliable, as they need 15 days of maintenance for every 6 months in service.|$|E

2500|$|... "Gap Filler Signals" [...] {{are used}} at the 14th Street–Union Square station and {{formerly}} at the South Ferry Loop station,which closed on June 27,2017, where <b>gap</b> <b>fillers</b> extend out from the platforms to bridge {{the space between the}} platform and the car body and door at the curved stations. When the signals are red, the <b>gap</b> <b>fillers</b> are extended, and when the red light is no longer lit up, the <b>gap</b> <b>fillers</b> have been retracted, and the train operator can increase the speed of the train and leave the station.|$|E
2500|$|Mechanical {{platform}} edge extensions {{known as}} platform <b>gap</b> <b>fillers</b> {{may be used}} {{to bridge the gap between}} platform and vehicle. [...] These stopgaps require careful alignment of the vehicle upon arrival, and careful synchronization to avoid serious damage caused by departure of the vehicle before the extenders are fully retracted. They increase station dwell time, and introduce safety and maintenance concerns of their own.|$|E
2500|$|Previously {{in medical}} science, the {{neuronal}} network {{was considered the}} only important function of astrocytes, and they were looked upon as <b>gap</b> <b>fillers.</b> More recently, the function of astrocytes has been reconsidered, and they are now thought to play a number of active roles in the brain, including the secretion or absorption of neural transmitters and maintenance of the blood–brain barrier. Following on this idea {{the concept of a}} [...] "tripartite synapse" [...] has been proposed, referring to the tight relationship occurring at synapses among a presynaptic element, a postsynaptic element and a glial element.|$|E

2500|$|The South Ferry loop station {{proved to}} be a service bottleneck. Operationally, the loop station functioned an {{intermediate}} station rather than as a true terminal, as trains would simply proceed back to Rector Street without the motorman needing to go to the reverse end of the train. Additionally, unlike most terminal stations in the system, there were neither layup tracks nor an additional track to store terminating trains, and there were no additional layup tracks along the line until at least 34th Street–Penn Station. This meant that trains could not dwell at the station for longer for 90 seconds (including the 5 to 10 seconds each that it took to extend and retract the <b>gap</b> <b>fillers).</b> Any trains that went out of passenger service at the station could have caused major delays along the rest of the line. Finally, trains could only proceed through the station at slow speeds, adding 30 to 60 seconds to travel time compared to a [...] "regular" [...] terminal station with two tracks and a full-length platform. [...] This ensured that 1 trains were delayed at the Chambers Street station, three stops north, for up to two minutes in both directions.|$|E
2500|$|There {{was a need}} to {{overhaul}} rolling stock and infrastructure of the once-private routes, especially for the IRT, where {{nearly all of the}} infrastructure was aged. The oldest cars came there from the time the subway opened in 1904, and the oldest subway cars of BMT in 1953 dated from the system's first years, in 1913. Therefore, a total of 2,860 cars for the A Division (IRT) – contract numbers R12 to R36 World's Fair (known as [...] "SMEE" [...] type) were delivered between 1948 and 1965, which constituted the replacement of almost the entire prewar IRT fleet. On the B Division (IND/BMT), 2,760 [...] "SMEE" [...] type cars in R10 to R42 series were ordered. Platforms were doubled in length systemwide. At some stations, <b>gap</b> <b>fillers</b> were installed because the station extensions were curved. Also in this period, the BMT replaced their signals. The Main Line R36 cars were the first equipment to be equipped with two-way radio as delivered standard equipment in 1965, with the first use of radio in the subway system on the IRT Lexington Avenue Line in May that year, and the [...] first successful air conditioned train (R38) was placed into service July 19, 1967.|$|E
