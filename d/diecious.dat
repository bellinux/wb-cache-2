25|$|It is a {{medium-sized}} to large deciduous tree, growing to 15–25 m (exceptionally to 38 m) tall, with an elliptical crown of moderate density {{with a smooth}} or rounded outline. The bark is a light gray with thick irregular curling ridges; as the tree matures, the bark tends to become plated. The twigs are slender, somewhat shiny, reddish brown. The terminal buds are sharply pointed, brown and pubescent. The leaves are opposite, simple, palmately lobed and veined, 3–9.5cm long and 3.5–11cm broad, with an entire margin and three or five somewhat rounded lobes, and a 2–8cm long petiole. They are green above and paler and pubescent below. In fall they turn orange and yellow. The flowers are regular, pentamerous, and appear on yellow-green corymbs and are quite small. They hang from puberulent pedicels 2.4–5cm long in clusters of a few flowers, appearing before or with the leaves in early spring. This is about two weeks prior to the maturation of the flowers of Acer saccharum. The tree is generally <b>diecious,</b> though they are often also polygamous, that is having bisexual and unisexual flowers on the same individual. The fruit is a paired samara 1.5–3cm long.|$|E

50|$|The grape vine can {{be either}} {{monoecious}} or <b>diecious,</b> with flowers appearing in May to June. The flowers are arranged in compound panicles with 5 yellow petals, 5 sepals and 5 stamen (floral number is 5). The leaves are arranged alternately with a cordate shape. Venation is palmate. Unlike other wild grapes there are no tufts of hair present on the leaves. Tendrils appear every third leaf oppositely are reddish in color and used for growth along surfaces. The grapes are tiny and dark purple.|$|E
50|$|The {{nematodes}} are whitish in colour, cylindrical, {{and with}} fine longitudinal striations throughout the body. The body covering is a proteinaceous layer named cuticle. The anterior end is the mouth with distinct lips, and the anus opens towards the posterior. They are <b>diecious</b> with marked sexual dimorphism. Males are shorter and smaller, with straight blunt tails, while females are bigger and longer, with curved tails. They all exhibit direct lifecycles. They cause nodular typhlitis, diarrhoea, emaciation, and death. H. gallinarum {{is the most}} well-known species, and is most important as it transmits the protozoan parasite, Histomonas meleagridis in birds.|$|E
50|$|Heterakis gallinarum is a {{nematode}} parasite {{that lives}} in the cecum of some galliform birds, particularly in ground feeders such as domestic chickens and turkeys. It causes infection that is mildly pathogenic. However, it often carries a protozoan parasite Histomonas meleagridis which causes of histomoniasis (blackhead disease). Transmission of H. meleagridis is through the H. gallinarum egg. H. gallinarum is about 1-2 cm in length with a sharply pointed tail and a preanal sucker. The parasite is a <b>diecious</b> species with marked sexual dimorphism. Males are smaller and shorter, measuring around 9 mm in length, with a unique bent tail. Females are stouter and longer, measuring roughly 13 mm in length, with a straight tail end.|$|E

5000|$|It is {{the largest}} {{nematode}} in birds, with females measuring 72 to 112 mm long. The body is semitransparent, creamy-white and cylindrical. The anterior end {{is characterized by a}} prominent mouth, which is surrounded by three large tri-lobed lips. The edges of the lips bear teeth-like denticles. The body is entirely covered with a thick proteinaceous structure called cuticle. The cuticle is striated transversely throughout the length of the body and cuticular alae are poorly developed. Two conspicuous papillae are situated on the dorsal lip and one on each of the subventral lips. These papillae are the sensory organs of the nematode. A. galli is <b>diecious</b> with distinct sexual dimorphism. Females are considerably longer and more robust, with vulva opening at the middle portion (approximately midway from anterior and posterior ends) of the body and anus at the posterior end of the body. The tail end of females is characteristically blunt and straight. Males are relatively shorter and smaller (measuring 50 to 76 mm long), with a distinct pointed and curved tail. There are also ten pairs of caudal papillae towards the tail region of the body, and they are arranged linearly in well-defined groups such as precloacal (3 pairs), cloacal (1 pair), post-cloacal (1 pair) and subterminal (3 pairs) papillae.

40|$|Certain {{fatty acids}} in the C 5 to C 18 range, at {{concentrations}} {{as low as}} 10 − 5 M, were found to inhibit the germinations of spores of the sensitive fern, Onoclea sensibilis L. The addition of gametophytic culture flltrates of the bracken fern, Pteridium aquilinum (L.) Kuhn, containing antheridogen A, was found to overcome this inhibition and allow the spores to germinate and the gametophytes to develop in a normal fashion. Some fatty acids were found to increase the antheridium-inducing potency of antheridogen A as much as 10 -fold. An effect similar to this may promote the <b>diecious</b> reproduction of ferns...|$|E
40|$|In a {{population}} practicing consanguineous marriage, rare recessive lethal alleles (RRLA) have higher chances of affecting phenotypes. As inbreeding causes more homozygosity and subsequently more deaths, {{the loss of}} individuals with RRLA decreases the frequency of these alleles. Although this phenomenon is well studied in general, here some hitherto unstudied cases are presented. An analytical formula for the RRLA frequency is presented for infinite monoecious population practicing several different types of inbreeding. In finite <b>diecious</b> populations, {{it is found that}} more severe inbreeding leads to quicker RRLA losses, making the upcoming generations healthier. A population of size 10, 000 practicing 30 % half-sib marriages loses more than 95 % of its RRLA in 100 generations; {{a population}} practicing 30 % cousin marriages loses about 75 % of its RRLA. Our findings also suggest that given enough resources to grow, a small inbred population will be able to rebound while losing the RRLA. Comment: 9 pages, 3 figure...|$|E
40|$|In 1922, JBS Haldane {{discovered}} an intriguing bias of postzygotic isolation during early speciation: the heterogametic sex of F 1 hybrids between {{closely related species}} or subspecies is more susceptible to sterility or inviability than the homogametic sex. This phenomenon, now known as Haldane's rule, has been repeatedly confirmed across broad taxa in <b>diecious</b> animals and plants. Currently, the dominant view {{in the field of}} speciation genetics believes that Haldane's rule for sterility, inviability, male heterogamety and female heterogametic belongs to different entities; and Haldane's rule in these subdivisions has different causes, which operate coincidentally and/or collectively resulting in this striking bias against the heterogametic sex in hybridization. This view, known as the composite theory, was developed after many unsuccessful quests in searching for a unitary genetic mechanism. The composite theory has multiple sub-theories. The dominance theory and the faster male theory are the major ones. In this note, I challenge the composite theory and its scientific validity. By declaring Haldane's rule as a composite phenomenon caused by multiple mechanisms coincidentally/collectively, the composite theory becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy and untestable. I believe that the composite theory is an ad hoc hypothesis that lacks falsifiability, refutability and testability that a scientific theory requires. It is my belief that the composite theory does not provide meaningful insights for the study of speciation and should be abandoned. Comment: 14 pages, 25 references, no figure/tabl...|$|E
40|$|Cannabis is a {{predominantly}} <b>diecious</b> phenotypically diverse domesticated genus with {{few if any}} extant natural populations. International narcotics conventions and associated legislation have constrained the establishment, characterization and use of Cannabis genetic resource collections. This {{has resulted in the}} underutilization of genepool variability in cultivar development and has limited the inclusion of secondary genepools associated with genetic improvement strategies of the Green Revolution. The structured screening of ex situ germplasm and the exploitation of locally-adapted intraspecific traits is expected to facilitate the genetic improvement of Cannabis. However, limited {{attempts have been made to}} establish the full extent of genetic resources available for pre-breeding. We present a thorough critical review of Cannabis ex situ genetic resources, and discuss recommendations for conservation, pre-breeding characterization and genetic analysis that will underpin future cultivar development. We consider East Asian germplasm to be a priority for conservation based on the prolonged historical cultivation of Cannabis in this region over a range of latitudes, along with the apparent high levels of genetic diversity and relatively low representation in published genetic resource collections. Seed cryopreservation could improve conservation by reducing hybridization and genetic drift that may occur during Cannabis germplasm regeneration. Given the unique legal status of Cannabis, we propose the establishment of a global virtual core collection based on the collation of consistent and comprehensive provenance meta-data and the adoption of high-throughput DNA sequencing technologies. This would enable representative core collections to be used for systematic phenotyping, and so underpin breeding strategies for the genetic improvement of Cannabis...|$|E
40|$|Ficopomatus enigmaticus is an {{ubiquitous}} fouling reef-forming species, easy {{to sample}} and recognize, <b>diecious</b> with gamete spawning along different seasons in different salinity conditions. Due to its characteristics {{it could become}} a good candidate for the monitoring of both marine and brackish waters. The suitability of F. enigmaticus as a promising model organism in ecotoxicological bioassays was evaluated by a sperm toxicity and a larval development assay. The fertilization rate in different salinity conditions (range 5 - 35 ‰) was first assessed in order to detect the salinity threshold within which profitably perform the assays. Afterward copper (Cu 2 +), cadmium (Cd 2 +), sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and 4 -n-nonylphenol (NP) were used as reference toxicants in exposure experiments with spermatozoids (sperm toxicity assay) and zygotes (larval development assay). A dose-response effect was obtained for all tested toxicants along all salinity conditions except for 5 ‰ salinity condition where a too low (< 30 %) fertilization rate was observed. NP showed the highest degree of toxicity both in sperm toxicity and larval development assay. In some cases the results, expressed as EC 50 values at 35 ‰ salinity condition, were similar to those observed in the literature for marine organisms such as the sea urchin (Paracentrotus lividus) and the marine serpulid Hydroides elegans, while the exposure of F. enigmaticus spermatozoids' to Cd 2 + and NP resulted in toxicity effects several orders of magnitude higher than observed in P. lividus. Spermatozoids resulted to be slightly more sensitive then zygotes to all different toxicants...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: There is a {{heteromorphic}} alternative life in {{the brown}} seaweed, Saccharina japonica (Aresch.) C. E. Lane, C. Mayes et G. W. Saunders ( = Laminaria japonica Aresch.), with macroscopic monoecious sporophytes and microscopic <b>diecious</b> gametophytes. Female gametophytes are genetically different from males. It {{is very difficult to}} identify the parent of a sporophyte using only routine cytological techniques due to homomorphic chromosomes. A sex-specific marker {{is one of the best}} ways to make this determination. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To obtain clear images, chromosome preparation was improved using maceration enzymes and fluorochrome 4 ', 6 -diamidino- 2 -phenylindole (DAPI). The chromosome number of both male and female haploid gametophytes was 31, and there were 62 chromosomes in diploid sporophytes. Although the female chromosomes ranged from 0. 77 µm to 2. 61 µm in size and were larger than the corresponding ones in the males (from 0. 57 µm to 2. 16 µm), there was not a very large X chromosome in the females. Based on the known female-related FRML- 494 marker, co-electrophoresis and Southern blot profiles demonstrated that it was inheritable and specific to female gametophytes. Using modified fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), this marker could be localized on one unique chromosome of the female gametophytes as well as the sporophytes, whereas no hybridization signal was detected in the male gametophytes. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our data suggest that this marker was a female chromosome-specific DNA sequence. This is the first report of molecular marker localization on algal chromosomes. This research provides evidence for the benefit of using FISH for identifying molecular markers for sex identification, isolation of specific genes linked to this marker in the females, and sex determination of S. japonica gametophytes in the future...|$|E
