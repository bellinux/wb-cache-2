5|$|Larvae {{of members}} of the family Glossosomatidae in the {{suborder}} Spicipalpia create dome-shaped enclosures of silk which enables them to graze on the periphyton, the biological film that grows on stones and other objects, while carrying their enclosure around like turtles. In the family Philopotamidae, the nets are sac-like, with intricate structure and tiny mesh. The larvae have specialised mouthparts to scrape off the microflora that get trapped <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>net</b> as water flows through.|$|E
5|$|A simple model which predicts lyotropic phase {{transitions}} is the hard-rod model {{proposed by}} Lars Onsager. This theory considers the volume {{excluded from the}} center-of-mass of one idealized cylinder as it approaches another. Specifically, if the cylinders are oriented parallel to one another, {{there is very little}} volume that is excluded from the center-of-mass of the approaching cylinder (it can come quite close to the other cylinder). If, however, the cylinders are at some angle to one another, then there is a large volume surrounding the cylinder which the approaching cylinder's center-of-mass cannot enter (due to the hard-rod repulsion between the two idealized objects). Thus, this angular arrangement sees a decrease <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>net</b> positional entropy of the approaching cylinder (there are fewer states available to it).|$|E
5|$|Luton {{came close}} to scoring their second goal of the match when Harford got away from Caesar and ran towards the left byline. His cross into the penalty area was met by Brian Stein's head, but Lukic made a crucial save, tipping the ball wide. Both {{managers}} brought on substitutes after the hour mark – Mark Stein came on for Harford, while Martin Hayes replaced Groves. The latter substitution worked to Arsenal's advantage, as it brought about their equaliser in the 72nd minute. Davis' free kick delivered in was only half cleared by Foster and amongst the scramble, Hayes drove the ball <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>net.</b> Arsenal continued to pile on pressure, and took the lead three minutes later, when Smith received a pass from Thomas to score.|$|E

5|$|On 4 October 1998, Arsenal hosted Newcastle United at Highbury; Dennis Bergkamp scored {{his first}} league {{goal of the}} season in a 3–0 win. The team failed to convert several chances against Southampton, with the match ending in a 1–1 draw; Anelka and Petit did however score against Blackburn Rovers the {{following}} game, thus putting pressure on opposing manager Roy Hodgson as Blackburn remained in the bottom four. The month ended with a 1–0 win away to Coventry City; Anelka scored his fifth league goal of the season, tapping the ball <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>net</b> after a counterattack started by Overmars.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of 12 May, U-6 headed out to try to {{intercept}} shipping between Santa Maria di Leuca and Valona. Linienschiffsleutnant Hugo von Falkhausen, U-6s commander since November 1915, attempted to pass underneath two drifters that formed {{a part of the}} Otranto Barrage. While submerged, von Falkhausen heard an unexplained noise on the hull of the boat, which was likely the sound of U-6 fouling one of the anti-submarine nets deployed from the drifter Calistoga. The drifter's skipper was alerted to the submarine's presence when one of the indicator buoys had fired. Calistoga launched signal flares that attracted the attention of two nearby drifters Dulcie Doris and Evening Star II. In the meantime, von Falkhausen surfaced U-6 to try to cut loose the buoy being dragged behind his boat. When the hatch was opened, the crew discovered the boat entangled <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>net.</b>|$|E

He was a pioneer of stickhandling the puck; before that time, goaltenders passively stood <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>net</b> and simply deflected pucks to defencemen or backchecking forwards.|$|E

5|$|The fishing market, {{historically}} {{has always had}} a porpoise bycatch. In 1981, it was legal to kill 22,500 porpoises per year to catch yellowfin tuna. This type of tuna has been known to follow porpoises, and when fishermen find these tuna, more often than not, a porpoise is also entangled in a net. Sometimes, a pod of porpoises are herded along with schools of tuna, and when fishermen cast a seine, the porpoises are trapped <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>net,</b> and drown because they can't surface. Today, the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 has enforced the use of safer fishing equipment to reduce bycatch.|$|E
5|$|Throughout its range, the bowmouth {{guitarfish}} {{is caught}} incidentally or intentionally by artisanal and commercial fisheries using trawls, gillnets, and line gear. The fins are extremely valuable {{due to their}} use in shark fin soup, and are often the only parts of the fish kept and brought to market. However, the meat may also be sold fresh or dried and salted, and it is highly esteemed in India. When caught as bycatch in trawls, the bowmouth guitarfish is considered a nuisance because its strength and rough skin {{make it difficult to}} handle, and as the heavy ray thrashes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>net</b> it can damage the rest of the catch. In Thailand, the enlarged thorns of this species are used to make bracelets.|$|E
5|$|After {{buying the}} team, COMSAT {{organized}} its Denver sports franchises under a separate subsidiary, Ascent Entertainment Group Inc., which {{went public in}} 1995, with 80% of its stock bought by COMSAT and the other 20% available on NASDAQ. The Colorado Avalanche played their first game in the McNichols Sports Arena in Denver (where the Denver Nuggets also played) on October 6, 1995, winning 3–2 against the Detroit Red Wings. Valeri Kamensky scored the first goal as the Avalanche. Led by captain Joe Sakic, forward Peter Forsberg and defenseman Adam Foote {{on the ice and}} Pierre Lacroix as the general manager and Marc Crawford as the head coach, the Avalanche became stronger when All-Star Montreal Canadiens goalie Patrick Roy joined the team. Feeling humiliated for being left <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>net</b> after having let in nine goals in 26 shots during a Canadiens game against the Red Wings, Roy joined the Avalanche on December 6, 1995, together with ex-Montreal captain Mike Keane in a trade for Jocelyn Thibault, Martin Ručinský and Andrei Kovalenko. Roy would prove a pivotal addition for Colorado in the years to come.|$|E

5|$|Birmingham won the toss and Manchester City kicked off. The Birmingham goal {{came under}} {{pressure}} almost immediately. Within a minute a far post cross from Roy Clarke narrowly eluded Hayes. Two corners followed, the second {{resulting in a}} shot by Roy Paul. The next attack, in the third minute, resulted in the opening goal. Revie began the move, exchanging passes with Clarke, and back-heeling for the unmarked Hayes to sweep the ball past Gil Merrick to put Manchester City ahead. Birmingham's confidence was shaken, resulting {{in a series of}} Manchester City corners and a chance for Hayes, but they fought back to equalise in the 15thminute. Astall slipped the ball to Brown, who helped it forward. It rebounded off a Manchester City defender into the path of Welsh international inside‑forward Noel Kinsey, who fired home via Trautmann's far post. For the remainder of the first half Birmingham had most of the play, exerting pressure on Manchester City full-back Leivers, but were unable to make a breakthrough. Though Birmingham put the ball <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>net</b> twice, Brown was adjudged to be offside on both occasions. With Warhurst missing and Boyd out of position and not fully fit, Birmingham's strength and balance was disrupted, leaving them particularly vulnerable to Manchester City's unconventional style.|$|E
5|$|His goals {{also helped}} Darlington reach {{the second round}} proper (last 32) of the 1919–20 FA Cup. Healey scored twice against Bishop Auckland in the fifth {{qualifying}} round, and repeated the feat in the sixth, as well as creating two for Aaron Travis, as Darlington beat Southern League club Norwich City 5–0. In the first round proper, Darlington faced Sheffield Wednesday of the First Division. A damaged shoulder meant Healey was unfit for the scheduled date, but a waterlogged Feethams pitch gave him an extra few days to recover. The match ended goalless; Healey was unusually indecisive in front of goal, and was standing in an offside position when Travis did put the ball <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>net.</b> Although reported doubtful for the replay, he did appear, pressuring goalkeeper Arnold Birch into conceding a corner from which Darlington took the lead– the goal variously attributed to George Stevens or to Healey himself. He missed the second-round tie at Birmingham because his wife was ill; Darlington lost 4–0.|$|E
5|$|In the fifth-round match, {{the teams}} saw out a 0–0 draw at Maine Road, and the match was replayed at Anfield. Goals from Jack Dyson and Bobby Johnstone gave Manchester City a 2–1 lead, {{but the game}} {{finished}} in controversial circumstances when the referee blew his whistle for full time as Liverpool's Billy Liddell was bearing down on goal. Liddell put the ball <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>net,</b> but unbeknown to him the goal did not count as the match was already over. In the quarter final Manchester City again played opposition from Liverpool, facing Everton at Maine Road. Trailing 1–0 at half-time after a Jimmy Harris goal, City overcame the deficit {{in the second half}} with goals from Hayes and Johnstone. Further controversy followed in the semi-final against Tottenham Hotspur, when in the final minutes of the match, with the score at 1–0 to Manchester City, Tottenham were denied a penalty after goalkeeper Trautmann grabbed forward George Robb's leg. No further goalscoring opportunities occurred, and City hung on for the victory.|$|E

5|$|On October 12, Harris {{was named}} to the 21-player roster that would {{represent}} the United States at the 2004 FIFA Women's World Championship in Thailand. Harris was captain of the team and played every minute in all six matches of the tournament for the United States. Harris started in net in the opening group match against South Korea on November 11 and recorded a shut out for a 3–0 win. She allowed one goal during the match against Russia on November 14 in a 4–1 win for the United States. She recorded her second shut out of the tournament on November 18 against Spain in the team's final group match. The United States won 1–0 and was the only team to win all three of its group matches. In the quarterfinals, Harris posted her third shut out in the 2–0 win over Australia on November 21. The United States moved into the semifinals, where they faced Germany on November 24. Harris started <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>net</b> and allowed three goals during the match. The Germans took the win and halted the United States' advancement in the tournament. The United States faced Brazil in the third place match, where Harris played all 90 minutes. She made eight saves and recorded her fourth shut out of the tournament. The United States won the game 3–0 and took away third place. Harris was subsequently named to the Tournament All-Star Team by the FIFA Technical Study Group. She was also a 2004 Chevrolet Athlete of the Year Award Finalist.|$|E
5|$|The retiarius was {{routinely}} {{pitted against}} a heavily armed secutor. The net-fighter {{made up for}} his lack of protective gear by using his speed and agility to avoid his opponent's attacks {{and waiting for the}} opportunity to strike. He first tried to throw his net over his rival. If this succeeded, he attacked with his trident while his adversary was entangled. Another tactic was to ensnare his enemy's weapon <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>net</b> and pull it out of his grasp, leaving the opponent defenseless. Should the net miss or the secutor grab hold of it, the retiarius likely discarded the weapon, although he might try to collect it back for a second cast. Usually, the retiarius had to rely on his trident and dagger to finish the fight. The trident, as tall as a human being, permitted the gladiator to jab quickly and keep his distance. It was a strong weapon, capable of inflicting piercing wounds on an unprotected skull or limb. The dagger was the retiariuss final backup should the trident be lost. It was reserved for when close combat or a straight wrestling match had to settle the bout. In some battles, a single retiarius faced two secutores simultaneously. For these situations, the lightly armoured gladiator was placed on a raised platform and given a supply of stones with which to repel his pursuers.|$|E
5|$|Bengaluru {{kicked off}} their season with an away game against Salgaocar on 9 January 2016. Bengaluru took an early lead when C.K. Vineeth put a pass from Kim Song-Yong <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>net.</b> However, {{just before the}} half time, Jackichand Singh was brought down by Eugeneson Lyngdoh in the penalty area and Salgaocar were awarded the penalty. Darryl Duffy {{converted}} the penalty and equalized for Salgaocar. In the second half, Sunil Chhetri converted the free-kick into the goal in 61st minute and Bengaluru FC won the game 2–1, registering their sixth consecutive win against Salgaocar in all competitions. Bengaluru played the next game against I-League debutant Aizawl F.C.. Curtis Osano's header from Keegan Pereira's free-kick in 27th minute was enough for Bengaluru to secure three points. In the first home game of the season, Bengaluru played Shillong Lajong. C.K. Vineeth registered the fastest goal of the season (38 seconds) for Bengaluru. Bengaluru doubled the lead when Kim Song-Yong scored his first goal for the team in 35th minute. Kim scored the brace in the 60th minute and Bengaluru {{reached the top of}} the table with the 3–0 and the third consecutive win. In the next away game against Mumbai F.C., Bengaluru quickly conceded the lead as Arata Izumi and Son Min-chol scored a goal each within 11 minutes. In spite of fair possession and counter-attack, Bengaluru couldn't convert their chances and faced the first loss of the season. The loss also ended Bengaluru FC's unbeaten streak of 16 games in the league dating back to previous season's game against Sporting Clube de Goa on 28 February 2015. In the month's last game, Bengaluru FC faced East Bengal and registered their first every away victory against the Kolkata side with a solitary goal by the captain Sunil Chhetri in the 60th minute and finished the month at the top of the table.|$|E
