40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} {{data collection}} owner. Data set comprising interviews {{with a range}} of stakeholders including: care-based hairdressers, people with dementia, informal carers, care workers and other practitioners and key informants. Project description: This research will explore the role that hairdressing plays in the lives of older people who are high-level users of health and social care. This will include investigating the formal/paid services provided by hairdressers, and the styling and management of hair undertaken by care workers. There are four main aims to this research: to describe the experience of hairdressing and explore the significance it holds for older service users to describe the workplace experience of care-based hairdressers and care workers to scrutinise and document the constituent elements of hairdressing encounters to consider patterns of provision, access and affordability of <b>hairdressing</b> <b>services</b> to older service users. This ethnographic study will be conducted over three types of setting: care received at home, long-stay hospital care settings and care homes. It will include observations and filming in care-based salons as well as interviews with care workers, hairdressers and older service users. The findings will inform policy and practices in care and raise the profile of body-work that is fundamental to well-being and the avoidance of decline, depression and neglect. The study addresses an aspect of care settings that is little understood and for which no evidence-base currently exist...|$|E
50|$|By 1777, {{approximately}} 1,200 hairdressers {{were working}} in Paris. During this time, barbers formed unions, and demanded that hairdressers do the same. Wigmakers also demanded that hairdressers cease taking away from their trade, and hairdressers responded that their roles were not the same, <b>hairdressing</b> was a <b>service,</b> and wigmakers made and sold a product. de Rumigny died in 1770 and other hairdressers gained in popularity, specifically three Frenchmen: Frederic, Larseueur, and Léonard. Leonard and Larseueur were the stylists for Marie Antoinette. Leonard was her favorite, and developed many hairstyles that became fashion trends within wealthy Parisian circles, including the loge d'opera, which towered five feet over the wearer's head. During the French Revolution he escaped the country hours before {{he was to be}} arrested, alongside the king, queen, and other clients. He emigrated to Russia, where he worked as the premier hairdresser for Russian nobility.|$|R
50|$|In early times, it is {{most likely}} Roman men wore their hair long. With the {{introduction}} of barbers called tonsors in about 300 BCE it became customary to wear hair short. In Ancient Rome, household slaves would perform hairdressing functions for wealthy men. However, men who lacked access to private <b>hairdressing</b> and shaving <b>services</b> or those who preferred a more social atmosphere went to a barbershop (tonstrina). Barbershops were places of social gatherings and a young man’s first shave was often even celebrated as a passage to manhood in the community. The barbers usually shaved the customers faces with iron razors and applied an aftershave with ointments that may have contained spider webs. Trimming a head of hair and shaving would be the rule in Rome {{in the second century}} BCE. Roman men who wore beards would not be admitted into the senate unless they shaved.|$|R
40|$|Cosmetologists and {{consumers}} often assume hairdressing, nail salons and the products used are safe. Unfortunately they {{are subjected to}} various occupational health risks such as some of chemicals ingredients used in nail and hair products have been tied to cancer, miscarriages and lung diseases. Other problems are due to prolonged standing, poor ventilation, poor lighting and unhygienic practice. This study assesses occupational health hazards and illnesses awareness among hairdresser and nail salon workers. By using questionnaire and interview a total of 264 workers {{participated in the study}} whereby 34. 47 % (91) are hairdressing, 14. 77 % (39) nail services and 50. 76 % (134) <b>hairdressing</b> and nail <b>services.</b> Results shows that majority 88. 64 % (n= 234) are affected with musculoskeletal disorders, 82. 58 (n= 218) physical injuries, dermatitis 73. 86 (n= 195), fungal infection 61. 36 % (n= 162), respiratory problems 54. 17 % (n= 143) and infectious diseases 37. 88 % (100). Other occupational health illness reported by some of respondent includes, nail infection 25. 76 % (n= 68), tuberculosis 21. 21 % (n= 56), Ulcers 9. 85 % (n= 26), cancer 6. 44 % (n= 17), and reproductive or birth disorder 5. 30 % (n= 14). Safety advocates are encouraged by the increased awareness but want better safeguards for salon workers. Although people thought consumers are more vulnerable, but workers in both nail and hair salons can be exposed to hazardous chemicals. Clearly, action is needed to improve conditions for salon workers and to help create and ensure healthier workplaces in the future. It can be recommended that,the operation of beauty salons should be regulated by the government such that the premises is licensed once the physical design and facilities used meet a minimum standard, Salon workers should meet a minimum level of training in relation to the services offered among many other relevant criteria...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} are twofold: to investigate the impact of service encounter quality dimensions on perceived value, customer satisfaction, and loyalty, and to examine the moderating effect of perceived risk on the relationship of loyalty with perceived value and customer satisfaction in high contact services. Design/methodology/approach: A questionnaire survey was adopted. Data were collected from customers who had used either <b>hairdressing</b> <b>services</b> or health care services in the past three months. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to evaluate the validity of the measures and structural equation modeling was used to assess the hypothesized relationships. Findings: Technical quality and empathy were found to display a positive effect on satisfaction in both hairstylist and physician samples. Physical environment was found to display a positive effect on satisfaction in the physician sample, but not in the hairstylist sample, and its effect on perceived value was non-significant in both samples. The results also showed that {{there was a significant difference}} between low and high perceived risk groups in both samples with respect to the relationship between satisfaction and loyalty, and the relationship between perceived value and loyalty. Research limitations/implications: The study was conducted in a professional and relational service context, thus the scope for generalization of the results to other contexts may be limited. Moreover, this study focused on performance risk. Originality/value: This study provides empirical support for the moderating role of perceived risk in the relationship between satisfaction and loyalty, and the relationship between perceived value and loyalty.

40|$|The European Commission Directive 1999 / 85 /EC {{allowed an}} {{experiment}} where the participant countries may apply {{one or two}} reduced VAT rates to specific labor-intensive services {{for a period of}} three years to study the impact of these reduced rates on job creation as well as combating the black economy. In Finland the chosen services were <b>hairdressing</b> <b>services</b> and minor repairing relating to bicycles, shoes, leather goods, clothing and household linen including alteration of clothing and household linen. The VAT rate was reduced from the general 22 % rate to 8 % from the beginning of 2007, and was meant to be in place until the end of 2010. In September 2010 it was decided that the experimental VAT reform would continue until the end of 2011. In this thesis I look into the European Commission's experiment of whether the reduced rates of value added tax did enhance employment in the specific labor-intensive services. The empirical part of the study is carried out by performing a difference-in-differences regression on the number of openings, number of closures and the stock of enterprises of both hairdressers and beauty salons, which were considered as the control group for hairdressing businesses. The results gotten from these regressions described how the reform affected hairdressing businesses when compared to beauty salons, for which the reduced VAT rates were not applied. The results of the study provide evidence that the reform did not increase demand or employment in the hairdressing sector. The demand for hairdressing businesses can thus be concluded to be inelastic, which suggests that it is not optimal or efficient to apply reduced VAT rates on this kind of labor-intensive services...|$|E
