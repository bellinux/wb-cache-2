This suggests that Dulong and Vandraleck formula could help quickly estimate the <b>calorific</b> <b>value</b> of a household waste combustible fraction model...|$|R
30|$|In reality, {{incineration}} is {{not feasible}} for Indian waste {{due to its}} low <b>calorific</b> <b>value.</b> The refuse-derived fuel (RDF) method, which increases the <b>calorific</b> <b>value</b> of waste by taking out the moisture content by gasification and pelletization before feeding it to the incineration plant, is practiced. The product of RDF is often mixed into the coal power plant [1].|$|R
40|$|Coal's quality {{deterioration}} {{has been}} assessed by measuring its carbon and hydrogen contents, <b>calorific</b> <b>value,</b> hard groove grindability index, and reactivity by a differential-scanning calorimeter (DSC). The deterioration, was more prominent {{in sunny days}} with intermittent rain. Annually approximately 2500 kJ per kg decrease in <b>calorific</b> <b>value</b> of coal the was observed. Possible remedial measures have also been discussed. ...|$|R
