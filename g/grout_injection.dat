40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} is to understand the processes influencing the colloidal silica <b>grout</b> <b>injection</b> into porous media through experimental and numerical investigations. Experimental studies include viscosity measurements, <b>grout</b> <b>injection</b> into columns and grouted sand testing. The grout viscosities are measured during gelation under shear. Colloidal silica <b>grout</b> <b>injection</b> experiments are performed on two different sizes of columns to understand the grouting processes as well as to generate data for numerical simulations. The larger diameter column experiments are performed by varying colloidal silica solution and the type of water. The smaller diameter column (slim tube) experiment was conducted to obtain the data in the absence of fingers. The use of dyes aided in visualizing the grout flow patterns and understanding the processes. A numerical model is developed by non-iteratively coupling a groundwater flow simulation model (MODFLOW) and a 3 -D multi-species reactive transport model (RT 3 D) and adding modules for the gelling process to simulate the chemical grouting in porous media. A grout gelation model is developed to estimate gel viscosity as a function of reaction time, grout concentration and shear rate. The flow field is periodically updated by taking into account the changing effective hydraulic conductivity in each cell as a result of non-uniform gel viscosity. The numerical model is verified and validated against (i) an analytical solution developed in this study, and (ii) the available numerical model results from literature, respectively. The grout model is used to analyse the experimental data of sodium silicate <b>grout</b> <b>injection</b> into the sand column as reported in literature. The grout model is also used to analyse the observations made in the colloidal silica <b>grout</b> <b>injection</b> experiment performed as part of this study. Simulation of <b>grout</b> <b>injection</b> has shown that the shear is an important parameter not incorporated in previous grouting models. The model captured the viscous fingers observed in the column experiments. The model has been able to predict the experimentally observed injection pressures in the mild slope region. The difference between experimental observations and numerical results increased {{towards the end of the}} simulation when the pressures increased steeply. It is hypothesized that this is due to the absence of filtration component in the model. The macromolecules filtered out at the pore throats contribute to the need for higher <b>grout</b> <b>injection</b> pressures. The model provides valuable insights in identifying the complex processes such as viscosification, shear, viscous finger formation and filtration, occurring during grouting.

40|$|In this {{doctoral}} thesis {{the development of}} compatible <b>injection</b> <b>grouts</b> based on hydrated lime for non-structural consolidation of detached plaster layers of decorative architectural surfaces (mural paintings) is studied. A review of Slovenian and international conservation practices of re-attachment interventions of historical plaster layers is given, which has resulted in well-defined requirements for <b>injection</b> <b>grouts</b> that must be compatible with historical renderings in the chemical, physical and mechanical aspects. At the same time, the <b>injection</b> <b>grouts</b> had to assure good working properties in the fresh state, evaluated according properties such as fluidity, injectability, water retention, minimal shrinkage, stability, etc. <b>Injection</b> <b>grouts</b> were developed in several phases. In the framework of preliminary research 9 different <b>injection</b> <b>grouts</b> were designed. Volume stability of the <b>injection</b> <b>grouts</b> was selected as a criterion for the selection of compositions used for further researches (17 <b>injection</b> <b>grouts).</b> <b>Injection</b> <b>grouts</b> were designed based on mineral binder and filler (hydrated lime and inert limestone filler), ultra light filler (for weight reduction), tuff as puccolan additive (to increase the mechanical properties) and chemical admixture (PCE and PPh superplasticizers) to reduce the water content. The first selected measure to increase the volumetric stability of grout mixtures was the decrease of the binder to filler ratio. The second measure {{was the use of}} superplasticizer to reduce the water content for the required workability. Furthermore, the research of grout mixtures was divided into several steps by eliminating the mixtures with poor properties (not reaching the requirements). In the framework of the research work, special models have been developed – models with air pockets and sandwiches simulating the detached plaster layers and allowing additional research of significant properties, such as adhesive strength. The grout mixtures were tested following the modified standard tests specially adapted for non-structural grouts. Grout mixtures L 1 S 3 PCE and L 1 S 2 B 1 PCE have proved to possess the most optimal combinations of key properties. Both mixtures have good volumetric stability with minimal shrinkage, and good water retention and injectability with dry and pre–wetted crushed lime mortar columns. Their mechanical and physical properties are within the range of historical plasters and provide good adhesion in the case of 2 mm high air pockets. Moreover, accelerated ageing showed that mixture L 1 S 2 B 1 PCE is more durable under various climatic influences in combination with distilled water or NaCl.

40|$|SYNOPSIS: The {{excavation}} of an underground metro frequently involves materials of poor geotechnical characteristics. Under certain conditions, {{improvement of the}} strength and stiffness of the ground is recommended to facilitate the excavation. Drainage of silty/clayey layers is generally reckoned as an efficient action before excavation. Boreholes for drainage can be drilled and activated for a required time. Dissipation of pore pressures {{may lead to a}} sufficient increase of short-term resistance, {{which is going to be}} mobilized during excavation. However, drainage may induce surface settlements, which can affect the buildings in the area of the construction works. In order to compensate these settlements <b>grout</b> <b>injections</b> can be carried out to produce an artificial volumetric increase. Sometimes the propagation may result uncontrolled as a consequence of the heterogeneity of the soil mass. Therefore, especially when historical buildings are involved, volume-controlled grouting may necessitate avoiding damage. As innovative solution, grout can be injected along a rod inflating pockets of special tissue and a prescribed volumetric expansion can be given. In this note the results of a numerical analysis are illustrated to demonstrate the efficiency of volume-controlled grouting with reference to an hypothetical case where enlargement of an existing tunnel section is planned. 1...|$|R

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this research work {{was to develop a}} low cost and efficient retrofitting technique for masonry buildings in Pakistan using indigenous materials, technologies and local skills. Three retrofitting techniques; ferrocement overlay, bed joint reinforcement and <b>grout</b> <b>injection</b> were investigated. Ferrocement overlay, also called reinforced coating, is a technique used for rehabilitation and retrofitting of unreinforced masonry buildings in which a steel welded wire mesh is connected to the surface of masonry wall and then plastered with a rich mortar. The efficacy of reinforced plaster is dependent on the bond between masonry and the plaster coating which is established through connectors, e. g. screws or bolts, and the bond between plaster and masonry. This study was carried out through a number of quasi-static reverse cyclic testing on isolated piers, perforated walls and single room building. Shake table test of half scale model before and after retrofitting was also carried out as part of the study. Damage patterns and the force-deformation parameters such as lateral stiffness, lateral strength, deformation capacity, energy dissipation capacity, etc. of specimens tested before and after retrofitting were studied and compared. It was concluded that the proposed cement-based grout might restore or even improve the pre-damaged state of unreinforced brick masonry buildings. Bed joint reinforcement in combination with <b>grout</b> <b>injection</b> might be utilized for local strengthening of cracked regions. Ferrocement overlay, on the other hand, was found very effective in enhancing the overall seismic performance of unreinforced masonry buildings. When applied to both sides of walls in single and double storey unreinforced masonry building, ferrocement overlay in combination with <b>grout</b> <b>injection</b> increased the lateral strength and stiffness by more than 100 % without significantly affecting the deformation and energy dissipating capacities. This technique was found to be more effective on shearcritical piers than rocking-critical piers. This technique is very simple in application because of utilization of locally available materials and with no special skill requirements. This technique is not only simple and efficient but also economical. The total cost of retrofitting (ferrocement overlay and <b>grout</b> <b>injection)</b> is less than 20 % of the cost of replacement of the building. Guidelines for the application of ferrocement overlay and <b>grout</b> <b>injection</b> and detailed procedure for the design of the unreinforced buildings retrofitted with ferrocement overlay are developed. A simple analytical model is proposed for the seismic performance evaluation of unreinforced masonry buildings retrofitted with ferrocement overlay. This model is based on results obtained from experimental work and existing formulations for unreinforced masonry buildings and reinforced concrete members and is calibrated with the test results performed as a part of this study. Performance modification factors for rocking-critical and shear-critical piers, corresponding to various damaged levels, are also proposed that are required for the performance evaluation of damaged buildings...|$|E
40|$|Typical {{damage to}} {{multiple}} leaf walls during earthquakes {{is the loss}} of bond between the leaves with consequent collapse of half of the wall. Retrofitting or repair of this damage is a very difficult task. In many cases <b>grout</b> <b>injection</b> or wall jacketing fail due to incompatibility with the construction technique of the walls. A complementary technique to the grouting has been proposed by the authors...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{reviews the}} {{literature}} on <b>injection</b> <b>grouts</b> used in the conservation of architectural surfaces including wall paintings, plasters, and mosaics. It presents the materials and techniques of grouting, and methods of evaluation, focusing on lime- and hydraulic lime-based grouts. This review indicates {{that a variety of}} materials have been investigated for use as <b>injection</b> <b>grouts,</b> and numerous commercial and custom-mixed grouts are available to conservators today. However, there are few standard or well-established methods to assess them, which have led {{to a wide range of}} test methods for their preparation, characterization, and evaluation. It is clear that a systematic study of the working and performance properties, test methods, and preparation and curing conditions is needed, as is an evaluation of products being used in the fiel...|$|R
40|$|In the paper, an {{experimental}} procedure for {{the choice of}} <b>injection</b> <b>grouts,</b> aimed to the optimization of stone walls injectability, is presented. To minimize compatibility problems between the original walls and the grouts, natural hydraulic-lime grouts have been used. The selection of the suitable grout is firstly performed by checking the intrinsic rheological properties of grouts (fluidity and stability) and then by controlling the injectability of masonry (penetration and diffusion of <b>grouts)</b> by <b>injection</b> tests on cylinders. Different particle-size distributions simulating the infill of multi-leaf stone masonry walls have been considered, {{as well as the}} influence on the injectability of different additives. The selected grouts have been consequently used for the consolidation of real-scale physical models of three-leaf stone masonry walls. The experimental results obtained from mechanical tests carried out both on materials (grouts), cylinders and wall samples, allowed to calibrate an analytical model able to predict the compressive strength of injected multi-leaf stone masonry walls. It is based on simple laboratory tests on the materials and on in situ survey and MDT applications on the masonry. Such approach, besides allowing the better exploitation of the grouts performances, can provide a practical contribution for the design of the repair intervention, aimed to the achievement of the maximum effectiveness...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{earthquakes}} in Italy {{highlighted the}} extreme vulnerability of historical buildings. Masonry vaults, which represent artistic valuable elements, have been recognised {{as the most}} vulnerable elements of such buildings. Therefore, the knowledge of their seismic performances, as well as potential retrofit techniques, meets {{the need to protect}} cultural heritage buildings which are prone to natural hazards. Vault dynamic behaviour is generally studied according to simplified methods or, as an alternative, to complex Finite Element (FE) analyses. However, a deep knowledge of their dynamic behaviour is still lacking from an experimental point of view. In order to investigate the seismic behaviour of masonry vaults, shaking table tests have been performed of a full scale masonry barrel vault. After the tests, the vault has been retrofitted by means of mortar joint repointing, <b>grout</b> <b>injections</b> and Inorganic Matrix FRP Grid (IMG). Then shaking table tests have been performed on the retrofitted vault. By means of the experimental tests outcomes, reliable numerical models able to predict the dynamic behaviour of the masonry vault (before and after the retrofit) have been developed. This aspect is relevant for studying characteristics which cannot be investigated by means of the experimental test monitoring. In this thesis a comprehensive overview of the main results of the experimental tests is reported. The unreinforced vault exhibits a good seismic behaviour, showing very slight damage up to a horizontal acceleration of about 4. 8 m/s 2 (measured at the keystone location). The retrofit resulted in a significant increase of both stiffness and capacity. Indeed, very slight damages only after the last test (performed with an achieved PGA of 11. 70 m/s 2) were detected on the retrofitted vault. However the retrofit did not drastically change the global dynamic behaviour of the vault...|$|R
