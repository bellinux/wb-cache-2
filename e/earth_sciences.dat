5|$|Knowledge about dinosaurs {{is derived}} {{from a variety of}} fossil and non-fossil records, {{including}} fossilized bones, feces, trackways, gastroliths, feathers, impressions of skin, internal organs and soft tissues. Many fields of study contribute to our understanding of dinosaurs, including physics (especially biomechanics), chemistry, biology, and the <b>earth</b> <b>sciences</b> (of which paleontology is a sub-discipline). Two topics of particular interest and study have been dinosaur size and behavior.|$|E
5|$|This rapid {{progress}} in geology and paleontology during the 1830s and 1840s was {{aided by a}} growing international network of geologists and fossil specialists whose work was organized and reviewed by {{an increasing number of}} geological societies. Many of these geologists and paleontologists were now paid professionals working for universities, museums and government geological surveys. The relatively high level of public support for the <b>earth</b> <b>sciences</b> was due to their cultural impact, and their proven economic value in helping to exploit mineral resources such as coal.|$|E

5|$|After the {{founding}} of the University College in 1876, Government support began in 1889. After mergers with the Bristol Medical School in 1893 and the Merchant Venturers' Technical College in 1909, this funding allowed the opening of a new medical school and an engineering school—two subjects that remain among the university's greatest strengths. In 1908, gifts from the Fry and Wills families, particularly £100,000 from Henry Overton Wills III (£6m in today's money), were provided to endow a University for Bristol and the West of England, provided that a royal charter could be obtained within two years. In December 1909, the King granted such a charter and erected the University of Bristol. Henry Wills became its first chancellor and Conwy Lloyd Morgan the first vice-chancellor. Wills died in 1911 and in tribute his sons George and Harry built the Wills Memorial Building, starting in 1913 and finally finishing in 1925. Today, it houses parts of the academic provision for <b>earth</b> <b>sciences</b> and law, and graduation ceremonies are held in its Great Hall.

40|$|The {{geographic}} and geologic settings of Puerto Rico {{served as the}} context to develop a mixed methods investigation on: (1) {{the effects of a}} five-day long constructivist and field-based <b>earth</b> <b>science</b> education professional development institute upon 26 secondary school science teachers 2 ̆ 7 <b>earth</b> <b>science</b> conceptual knowledge, perceptions of fieldwork, and beliefs about teaching earth science; and (2) the implementation of participants 2 ̆ 7 newly acquired knowledge and experience in their science lessons at school. Qualitative data included questionnaires, semi-structured interviews, reflective journals, pre-post concept maps, and pre-post lesson plans. The Geoscience Concept Inventory and the Science Outdoor Learning Environment Inventory were translated into Spanish and culturally validated to collect quantitative data. Data was analyzed through a constructivist grounded theory methodology, descriptive statistics, and non-parametric methods. Participants came to the institute with serious deficiencies in <b>earth</b> <b>science</b> conceptual understanding, negative <b>earth</b> <b>science</b> teaching perspectives, and inadequate <b>earth</b> <b>science</b> teaching methodologies. The institute helped participants to improve their understanding of <b>earth</b> <b>science</b> concepts, content, and processes mostly related to the study of rocks, the Earth 2 ̆ 7 s structure, plate tectonics, maps, and the geology of Puerto Rico. Participants also improved their <b>earth</b> <b>science</b> teaching beliefs, perceptions on field-based education, and reflected on their environmental awareness and social responsibility. Participants greatly benefited from the field-based learning environment, inquiry-based teaching approaches modeled, the attention given to their affective domain, and reflections on their teaching practice as part of the institute 2 ̆ 7 s activities. The constructivist learning environment and the institute 2 ̆ 7 s contextualized and meaningful learning conceptual model were effective in generating interest and confidence in <b>earth</b> <b>science</b> teaching. Some participants successfully integrated inquiry-based lessons on the nature of <b>science</b> and <b>earth</b> <b>science</b> at their schools, but were unsuccessful in integrating field trips. The lack of teacher education programs and the inadequacy of <b>earth</b> <b>science</b> conceptual and pedagogical understanding held by in-service teachers are the main barriers for effective <b>earth</b> <b>science</b> teaching in Puerto Rico. This study established a foundation for future <b>earth</b> <b>science</b> education projects for Latino teachers. Additionally, {{as a result of this}} investigation various recommendations were made to effectively implement <b>earth</b> <b>science</b> teacher education programs in Puerto Rico and internationally. ...|$|R

40|$|The present paper {{presents}} a philosophical analysis of <b>earth</b> <b>science,</b> a discipline {{that has received}} relatively little attention from philosophers of science. We focus {{on the question of}} whether <b>earth</b> <b>science</b> can be reduced to allegedly more fundamental sciences, such as chemistry or physics. In order to answer this question, we investigate the aims and methods of <b>earth</b> <b>science,</b> the laws and theories used by earth scientists, and the nature of earth-scientific explanation. Our analysis leads to the tentative conclusion that there are emergent phenomena in <b>earth</b> <b>science</b> but that these may be reducible to physics. However, <b>earth</b> <b>science</b> does not have irreducible laws, and the theories of <b>earth</b> <b>science</b> are typically hypotheses about unobservable (past) events or generalised - but not universally valid - descriptions of contingent processes. Unlike more fundamental <b>sciences,</b> <b>earth</b> <b>science</b> is characterised by explanatory pluralism: earth scientists employ various forms of narrative explanations in combination with causal explanations. The main reason is that earth-scientific explanations are typically hampered by local underdetermination by the data to such an extent that complete causal explanations are impossible in practice, if not in principle...|$|R
