5|$|Wilkins Peak is not gated, {{and it can}} {{be reached}} via an unpaved road known as Wilkins Peak Road that starts on U.S. Route 191 {{southwest}} of Rock Springs, Wyoming. The mountain can also be accessed via another unpaved road that begins in the Scott's Bottom Nature Area in Green River, Wyoming. The peak is accessible year-round, weather permitting. The Green River access road is <b>in</b> <b>worse</b> <b>shape</b> than the Rock Springs side, and it has several road hazards such as steep grades, poor grading, and off-road vehicle traffic. Along with serving radio needs, the peak also is a popular hiking and mountain biking location in the area. There are many smaller roads and trails that spring from the peak that offer varied degrees of challenge.|$|E

Upon ceasefire, Arnold called a council of war with his fellow officers, proposing to escape the British fleet via rowboats under the cover of night. As the British burned Arnold's flagship, the Royal Savage, to the east, the Americans rowed past the British lines.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{describe}} an area-preserving subdivision schematization algorithm: {{the area of}} each region in the input equals {{the area of the}} corresponding region in the output. Our schematization is axis-aligned, the final output is a rectilinear subdivision. We first describe how to con-vert a given subdivision into an area-equivalent rectilinear subdivision. Then we define two area-preserving contraction operations and prove {{that at least one of}} these operations can always be applied to any given simple rectilinear polygon. We extend this approach to subdivisions and showcase experimental results. Finally, we give examples for standard distance metrics (symmetric difference, Hausdorff- and Fréchet-distance) that show that better schematizations might result <b>in</b> <b>worse</b> <b>shapes...</b>|$|R
2500|$|Hitler desired an {{arrangement}} because German planners were estimating that German food, oils and nonferrous metals {{would run out}} in 1941, and German rubber supplies could run out almost immediately, especially if Trans-Siberian or blockade-breaker shipments failed to arrive. [...] German allies, such as Italy, were <b>in</b> even <b>worse</b> <b>shape</b> for key raw materials.|$|R

He became her {{business}} partner and their relationship was an open secret in Hollywood. He took over all of her personal and business affairs and was supposed to make her millions. Unfortunately, Kennedy left her after the disastrous Queen Kelly and her finances were <b>in</b> <b>worse</b> <b>shape</b> than when he came into her life. Two books have been written about the affair.|$|E
25|$|By early 1986 {{while the}} ABA was slowly {{getting back on}} its feet financially the USBA was {{starting}} to sink under the financial weight of poorly attended nationals and the loss of the core of their original management. Still, Mr. Hall approached the ABA with a plan to buy the ABA from the new owners Anderson and Vargas. This was quite strange since as mentioned the USBA was <b>in</b> <b>worse</b> <b>shape</b> financially than the ABA. On several occasions Mr. Hall approached Mr. Vargas and Mr. Anderson with buyout proposals. The talks came to naught.|$|E
500|$|When Grandpa Joe {{sees the}} ticket, he {{jumps out of}} bed and dances with joy. He offers to {{accompany}} Charlie on the tour, but Charlie explains how he was offered money for the ticket and intends to sell it. Grandpa George (David Morris) reminds Charlie that money is far more common than the tickets, and convinces Charlie to keep it. Upon meeting him {{on the day of the}} tour, the visitors find Wonka to be peculiar, lonely and acting odd at the mention of [...] "parents". The tour shows how the fantastical factory operates under the efforts of the short humans called Oompa-Loompas. The other four children succumb to temptation, and end up being caught in the factory workings and have to be safely recovered by the Oompa-Loompas, albeit <b>in</b> <b>worse</b> <b>shape</b> than at the start of the tour: Augustus falls into a river of chocolate and is sucked up by a pipe before being rescued from the fudge processing center; Violet expands into an oversized blueberry when she tries an experimental piece of chewing gum despite Wonka's warning; Veruca is thrown away as a [...] "bad nut" [...] by trained squirrels down the garbage chute; and Mike is shrunk down to a few inches in height after being the first person transported by Wonka's new television advertising invention. [...] During the tour, Wonka has flashbacks from his childhood where he remembers that he had a troubled relationship with his father, Wilbur. Due to his father being a dentist he was forbidden from candy consumption, but after managing to sneak a taste, he became hooked and later ran away from home to live his dream. He then returned several days later to find his father and home completely gone.|$|E

Both John and Andre are concerned about whether Mark will indeed go through with detox, although the ordinarily bubbly Andre is especially pessimistic.|$|R

50|$|She {{returned}} to Taiwan {{to find that}} opera was <b>in</b> even <b>worse</b> <b>shape</b> than before. It was largely relegated to outdoor religious ceremonies, weddings, and funerals, so opportunities to perform were few. Many artists were forced to find sidelines. By the year 1962, the vigorous development of the domestic TV and movie industries had resulted in {{a reduction in the}} island's 200-odd theatrical groups—down to 30. Yang's group struggled, then was disbanded in 1964.|$|R
2500|$|Although {{neglected}} in the historiography of the Arab-Israeli conflict, the Rotem Crisis {{was the most}} serious challenge to Israel's doctrine of deterrence in the years between the Suez Crisis and the Six Day War. [...] Haim Laskov described it as the most dramatic event of his tenure. It revealed deficiencies in the Israeli intelligence community, which failed to provide warning of an imminent threat, and in the IDF's ability to translate such warnings into immediate action. Although intelligence had suggested Egyptian forces were on the move, a week went by before {{the full extent of}} the Egyptian deployment came to light and countermeasures were taken. Rabin, a future Chief-of-Staff, later wrote that Israeli intelligence had never been <b>in</b> <b>worse</b> <b>shape.</b> Laskov had lost all faith in the head of military intelligence, Chaim Herzog, but was prevented from dismissing him by Ben-Gurion. The crisis influenced Israeli national security policy, defining any Egyptian military build-up along its border as unacceptable, while the Israeli intelligence community took extensive measures to improve its collection capabilities.|$|E
2500|$|When {{he arrived}} in Europe, Pershing had openly scorned the slow trench warfare of the {{previous}} three years on the Western Front, believing that American soldiers' skill with the rifle {{would enable them to}} avoid costly and senseless fighting over a small area of no-man's land. This was regarded as unrealistic by British and French commanders, and (privately) by a number of Americans such as Army Chief of Staff General Tasker Bliss and even Liggett. Even German generals were negative, with Ludendorff dismissing Pershing's strategic efforts in the Meuse-Argonne offensive by recalling how [...] "the attacks of the youthful American troops broke down with the heaviest losses". The AEF had performed well in the relatively open warfare of the Second Battle of the Marne, but the eventual American casualties against German defensive positions in the Argonne (roughly 120,000 American casualties in six weeks, against 35 or 40 German divisions) were not noticeably better than those of the Franco-British offensive on the Somme two years earlier (600,000 casualties in four and a half months, versus 50 or so German divisions). More ground was gained, but by this stage of the war the German Army was <b>in</b> <b>worse</b> <b>shape</b> than in previous years.|$|E

2500|$|While the Third Supply was {{stranded}} in Bermuda, the colony at Jamestown was <b>in</b> even <b>worse</b> <b>shape.</b> <b>In</b> the [...] "Starving Time" [...] of 1609–1610, the Jamestown settlers faced rampant starvation {{for want of}} additional provisions. During this time, lack of food drove people to eat snakes and even boil the leather from shoes for sustenance. Only 60 of the original 214 settlers at Jamestown survived. There is scientific evidence that the settlers at Jamestown had turned to cannibalism during the starving time.|$|R

Most significantly, they {{confirmed}} that it had split in two, and that the stern was <b>in</b> far <b>worse</b> <b>shape</b> than the bow. They {{did not have much}} time to explore, as others were waiting to take Knorr on other scientific pursuits, but his fame was now assured. He originally planned to keep the exact location a secret to prevent anyone from claiming prizes from it. He considered the site a cemetery, and refused to desecrate it by removing artifacts.|$|R

When Maj. Gen. Gardner learned that Vicksburg had surrendered on July 4, 1863, he realized that his situation was hopeless and that nothing could be gained by continuing. The terms of surrender were negotiated, and on July 9, 1863, the Confederates laid down their weapons, ending 48 days of continuous fighting. It had been the longest siege in US military history.|$|R

The Khotyn outcome, and the Ottoman failure to crush the outnumbered Commonwealth army, led Osman to put the blame on the janissaries. Osman wanted to modernize the army, which he blamed for the defeat; his plans for modernization were, however, opposed by the traditional-minded janissaries, culminating in the rebellion of janissaries in 1622, in which Osman II was assassinated.https://books.google.com/books?id=tYIxK0Mo1wwC&pg=PA9&ots=r1p_8a5TVH&dq=battle+Chocim+1621&as_brr=3&sig=C6-bIkKh58e3jttYFjR-PiOxQE0#PPA84,M1 ...|$|R
