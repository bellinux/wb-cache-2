40|$|Sixty-eight bedrock and {{sediment}} exposures, six lake bottom cores, and twenty-six bulk samples of river gravels were studied by various stratigraphic methods including: radiocarbon and caesium dating, tephrochronology and lithofacies analysis to interpret late Wisconsinan and Holocene deposits in the Silverhope Creek drainage basin.;Late Wisconsinan {{evidence suggests that}} during the downwasting and retreat of the Cordilleran Ice Sheet between approximately 11 500 and 11 000 years BP, there was one minor readvance and two smaller standstill/oscillations. During deglaciation a dead ice-dammed lake formed {{in front of the}} retreating ice mass. Partial lake drainage occurred initially by catastrophic flooding through dead ice into the contiguous Chilliwack valley over a low pass. Subsequent lake levels were controlled by dead <b>ice</b> decay, <b>hummocky</b> terrain, <b>ice</b> marginal drainage and height of the retreating ice mass. Final drainage occurred as a small outburst into the Fraser valley. Tributary glaciers appear to have retreated at different rates and to be, at times, temporarily covered by water.;Burial of Mazama tephra found in paraglacial alluvial fans suggests that following deglaciation, meltwater reworking of glacial sediments was more rapid {{on the west side of}} the drainage basin.;Landslide-damming (probably not seismic-generated) of Silver Lake appears to have taken place around 1100 A. D. Radiocarbon ages indicate that sedimentation in the lake occurred at a rate of about 0. 14 cm adollarlcub- 1 rcubdollar until 1946, with Silverhope Creek forming a delta into the southwest side of the lake. In 1946, diverted flows built a new delta into the southeast side of Silver Lake at the commencement of major logging activity and road construction around and to the south of Silver Lake. Caesium- 137 traces indicate that post- 1946 sedimentation rates have increased to approximately 2. 75 cm adollarlcub- 1 rcub. dollar Rates do not appear to have declined significantly in the last twenty to thirty years.;Analysis of in-channel gravels from Silverhope Creek indicates that human activity (logging and road construction) has site specific influences on particle size distribution. However, most disequilibriums in the general trend of downstream fining have been inherited from previous glaciation and the landslide-damming of Silver Lake. A tentative model of Holocene sedimentation for this unique drainage basin indicates that sediment yield is both episodic (lake-forming mass movement event and human impact) and perhaps subject to climatic asymmetry...|$|R
40|$|The Late Weichselian {{deglaciation}} {{of an area}} {{in southwestern}} Sweden was reconstructed by geomorphological, sedimentological and lithostratigraphical methods. The morainic deposits were mapped and classified into three landsystems: Streamlined terrain, hummocky moraine and cover moraine. Streamlined terrain was assumed to have been formed subglacially by a wet-based ice sheet. Cover moraine was interpreted to consist of redeposited sediments which have melted out supraglacially from a debris-rich <b>ice.</b> <b>Hummocky</b> moraine was formed by supraglacial melt-out and flowage of glacial debris into depressions and subsequent inversion of the landscape due to melting of ice cores. A model is presented where difference in morphology between hummocky and cover moraine is explained by differences in distribution of glacial debris in the stagnant ice. This distribution depends on the flow regime of the <b>ice</b> before stagnating. <b>Hummocky</b> moraine developed where the ice had compressive flow before stagnating and glacial debris was elevated to high levels in the ice by thrusting and folding of debris-rich basal ice. Cover moraine was formed where the ice had an extending or steady state flow before stagnating and the debris-rich ice was concentrated near {{the base of the}} ice. An east-west trending end moraine was mapped and sedimentologically investigated. The moraine was found to be mainly composed of ”ice slope colluvium” deposited in front of an active ice front which had readvanced from the north. The moraine was connected to the west to a previously known end moraine named the Torup moraine and the combined moraine was named the Torup-Unnaryd moraine. A 40 km long southward continuation of the Gothenburg moraine on the Swedish west coast was found and based on geomorphological evidences it was correlated with the Torup-Unnaryd moraine.

40|$|During "Meteor" Cruise 6 / 1966 in the {{northwest}} Atlantic a systematic survey of the bottom topography of the southeast Greenland continental margin was undertaken. Eighty-seven profiles transverse to the shelf edge at distances of 3 - 4 nautical miles and two longitudinal profiles parallel to the coast were carried out with the ELAC Narrow Beam Echo-Sounder giving a reliable record of even steep slopes. On {{the basis of the}} echo soundings the topography and morphology of the continental shelf and slope are evaluated. A detailed bathymetric chart and a serial profile chart were designed as working material for the morphological research. These maps along with the original echograms are morphometrically evaluated. The analysis of the sea bottom features is the basis of a subsequent morphogenetical interpretation, verified and extended by means of interpretation of magnetic data and sediment analysis (grain size, roundness, lithology). The results of the research are expressed in a geomorphological map. The primary findings can be summarized as follows: 1) The southeast Greenland shelf by its bottom topography can be clearly designated as a glacially formed area. The glacial features of the shelf can be classified into two zones nearly parallel to the coast: glacial erosion forms on the inner shelf and glacial accumulation forms on the outer shelf. The inner shelf is characterized by the rugged and <b>hummocky</b> topography of <b>ice</b> scoured plains with clear west/east slope asymmetry. On the outer shelf three types of glacial accumulation forms can be recognized: ice margin deposits with clearly expressed terminal moraines, glacial till plains and glaciomarine outwash fans. Both zones of the shelf can be subdivided into two levels of relief. The ice scoured plains, with average depths of 240 meters (m), are dissected to a maximum depth of 1060 m (Gyldenloves Trough) by trough valleys, which are the prolongations of the Greenland fjords. The banks of the outer shelf, with an average depth of 180 m, surround glacial basins with a maximum depth of 670 meters. 2) The sediments of the continental shelf can be classified as glacial due to their grain size distribution and the degree of roundness of the gravel particles. The ice margin deposits on the outer shelf can be recognized by their high percentage of gravels. On the inner shelf a rock surface is suggested, intermittently covered by glacial deposits. In the shelf troughs fine-grained sediments occur mixed with gravels. 3) Topography and sediments show that the southeast Greenland shelf was covered by an ice sheet resting on the sea floor during the Pleistocene ice-age. The large end moraines along the shelf edge probably indicate the maximum extent of the Wurm shelf ice resting on the sea floor. The breakthroughs of the end moraines in front of the glacial basins suggest that the shelf ice has floated further seaward over the increasing depths. 4) Petrographically the shelf sediments consist of gneisses, granites and basalts. While gneisses and granites occire on the nearby coast, basalt is not known to exist here. Either this material has been drifted by icebergs from the basalt province to the north or exists on the southeast Greenland shelf itself. The last interpretation is supported bythe high portion of basalt contained in the sediment samples taken and the strong magnetic anomalies probably caused by basaltic intrusions. 5) A magnetic profile allows the recognition of two magnetically differing areas which approximately coincide with the glacial erosion and accumulation zones. The inner shelf shows a strong and variable magnetic field because the glacially eroded basement forms the sea floor. The outer shelf is characterized by a weak and homogenous magnetic field, as the magnetized basement lies at greater depthy, buried by a thick cover of glacial sediments. The strong magnetic anomalies of the inner shelf are probably caused by dike swarms, similar to those observed further to the north in the Kangerdlugssuaq Fjord region. This interpretation is supported by the high basalt content of the sediment samples and the rough topography of the ice scoured plains which correlates in general with the magnetic fluctuations. The dike structures of the basement have been differentially eroded by the shelf ice. 6) The continental slope, extending from the shelf break at 313 m to a depth of 1270 m with an average slope of 11 °, is characterized by delta-shaped projections in front of the shelf basins, by marginal plateaus, ridges and hills, by canyons and slumping features. The projections could be identified as glaciomarine sediment fans. This conclusion is supported by the strong decrease of magnetic field intensity. The deep sea hills and ridges with their greater magnetic intensities have to be regarded as basement outcrops projecting through the glaciomarine sediment cover. The upper continental rise, sloping seaward at about 2 °, is composed of wide sediment fans and slump material. A marginal depression on the continental rise running parallel to the shelf edge has been identified. In this depression bottom currents capable of erosion have been recorded. South of Cape Farvel the depression extends to the accumulation zone of the "Eirik" sedimentary ridge. 7) By means of a study of the recent marine processes, postglacial modification of the ice-formed relief can be postulated. The retention effect of the fjord troughs and the high velocity of the East Greenland stream prevents the glacial features from being buried by sediments. Bottom currents capable of active erosion have only been found in the marginal depression on the continental rise. In addition, {{at the time of the}} lowest glacio-eustatic sea level, the shelf bottom was not situated in the zone of wave erosion. Only on the continental slope and rise bottom currents, sediment slumps and turbidity currents have led to significant recent modifications. Considering these results, the geomorphological development of the southeast Greenland continental terrace can be suggested as follows: 1. initial formation of a "peneplain", 2. fluvial incision, 3. submergence, and finally 4. glacial modification...|$|R

All men are able to do this in a greater or less degree, and the natives of Siberia apparently to a wonderful extent, though probably in an unconscious manner. This is effected chiefly, no doubt, by eyesight, but partly, perhaps, by the sense of muscular movement, in the same manner as a man with his eyes blinded can proceed (and some men much better than others) for a short distance in a nearly straight line, or turn at right angles, or back again. The manner in which the sense of direction is sometimes suddenly disarranged in very old and feeble persons, and the feeling of strong distress which, as I know, has been experienced by persons when they have suddenly found out that they have been proceeding in a wholly unexpected and wrong direction, leads to the suspicion that some part of the brain is specialised for the function of direction.|$|E

40|$|Abstract We test {{a surface}} renewal model that {{is widely used}} over snow and ice {{surfaces}} to calculate the scalar roughness length (zs), {{one of the key}} parameters in the bulk aerodynamic method. For the first time, the model is tested against observations that cover a wide range of aerodynamic roughness lengths (z 0). During the experiments, performed in the ablation areas of the Greenland ice sheet and the Vatnajökull ice cap in Iceland, the surface varied from smooth snow to very rough <b>hummocky</b> <b>ice.</b> Over relatively smooth snow and ice with z 0 below a threshold value of approximately 10 − 3 m, the model performs well and in accord with earlier studies. However, with growing hummock size, z 0 increases well above the threshold and the bulk aerodynamic flux becomes significantly smaller than the eddy-correlation flux (e. g. for z 0 = 0. 01 m, the bulk aerodynamic flux is about 50 % smaller). Apparently, the model severely underpredicts zs over <b>hummocky</b> <b>ice.</b> We argue that the surface renewal model does not account for the deep inhomogeneous roughness sublayer (RSL) that is generated by the hummocks. As a consequence, the homogeneous substrate ice grain cover becomes more efficiently ‘ventilated’. Calculations with an alternative model that includes the RSL and was adapted for use over <b>hummocky</b> <b>ice,</b> qualitatively confirms our observations. We suggest that, whenever exceedance of the threshold occurs (z 0 > 10 − 3 m, i. e., an ice surface covered with at least 0. 3 -m high hummocks), the following relation should be used to calculate scalar roughness lengths, ln(zs/z 0) = 1. 5 − 0. 2 ln(Re∗) − 0. 11 (ln(Re∗)) 2...|$|E

In numerical models and for data analysis, the bulk aerodynamic method is often used to calculate the turbulent surface fluxes, for which the aerodynamic roughness length (z 0) is a key parameter. We present, for the first time, spatial and temporal variations of z 0 in the ablation area of the Greenland ice sheet using year-round data from three automatic weather stations and one eddy-correlation mast. The temporal variation of z 0 is found to be very high in the lower ablation area (factor 500) with, {{at the end of the}} summer melt, a maximum in spatial variation for the whole ablation area of a factor 1000. The variation in time matches the onset of the accumulation and ablation season as recovered by sonic height rangers. During winter, snow accumulation and redistribution by snow drift lead to a uniform value of z 0 ≈ 10 − 4 m throughout the ablation area.

At the beginning of winter, we observed that single snow events have the potential to lower z 0 for a very rough ice surface by a factor of 20 to 50. The total surface drag of the abundant small-scale ice hummocks apparently dominates over the less frequent large domes and deep gullies. The latter results are verified by studying the individual drag contributions of hummocks and domes with a drag partition model...|$|E
