5|$|Cricket was {{introduced}} to Ireland by the English in the towns of Kilkenny and Ballinasloe in the early 19th century. In the 1830s, the game began to spread; many of the clubs which were founded in the following 30years are still in existence today. The first Irish national team played in 1855 against The Gentlemen of England in Dublin. In the 1850s, the Englishman Charles Lawrence was responsible <b>for</b> <b>developing</b> <b>the</b> game in Ireland through his coaching. In the 1850s and 1860s, Ireland was visited {{for the first time}} by touring professional teams. Ireland's first match against Marylebone Cricket Club (the M.C.C.) was in 1858.|$|E

5|$|In 1908, Zermelo {{published}} his axiom system for set theory. He had two motivations <b>for</b> <b>developing</b> <b>the</b> axiom system: eliminating the paradoxes and securing his {{proof of the}} well-ordering theorem. Zermelo had proved this theorem in 1904 using the axiom of choice, but his proof was criticized {{for a variety of}} reasons. His response to the criticism included his axiom system and a new proof of the well-ordering theorem. His axioms support this new proof, and they eliminate the paradoxes by restricting the formation of sets.|$|E
5|$|In more derived {{orders of}} insects, such as Diptera (flies) and Hymenoptera (wasp), the {{indirect}} muscles occupy the greatest {{volume of the}} pterothorax and function as {{the primary source of}} power for the wingstroke. Contraction of the dorsolongitudinal muscles causes the severe arching of the notum which depresses the wing while contraction of the dorsoventral muscles causes opposite motion of notum. Other more primitive insects, such as Orthoptera (locusts), Coleoptera (beetles), and Odonata (dragonflies) use direct muscles that are responsible <b>for</b> <b>developing</b> <b>the</b> needed power for the up and down strokes.|$|E

5|$|The {{planning}} {{of the metro}} was spurred {{by the development of}} the Ørestad area of Copenhagen. The principle of building a rail transit was passed by the Parliament of Denmark on 24 June 1992, with the Ørestad Act. The responsibility <b>for</b> <b>developing</b> <b>the</b> area, as well as building and operating the metro, was given to the Ørestad Development Corporation, a joint venture between Copenhagen Municipality (45%) and the Ministry of Finance (55%). Initially, three modes were considered: a tramway, a light rail and a rapid transit. In October 1994, the Development Corporation chose a light rapid transit.|$|E
5|$|The work on Integrative Negotiation Consensus Building and the Mutual Gains Approach {{provide a}} helpful {{theoretical}} framework <b>for</b> <b>developing</b> <b>the</b> theory of urban design management. Negotiation theory {{provides a useful}} framework for merging the perspectives of urban planning, city design, and real estate project proposals regarding production of the built environment. Interests, a key construct in negotiation theory, is an important variable that will allow integrated development, as defined above, to occur. The path-breaking work of Roger Fisher and William Ury (1981), Getting to yes, advises negotiators to focus on interests and mutual gains instead of bargaining over positions.|$|E
5|$|The {{youth leader}} of the troop is the senior patrol leader (SPL), elected by the Scouts in the troop. He is {{responsible}} for the overall performance of the troop, runs troop meetings and ensures that the program for troop meetings and other activities is carried out. He is advised by the Scoutmaster. There may also be one or more assistant senior patrol leaders. Each patrol elects a patrol leader who then appoints an assistant patrol leader and other positions within the patrol. Together, the senior patrol leader, assistant senior patrol leader and patrol leaders make up the patrol leaders council (PLC), the group of Scouts that is responsible <b>for</b> <b>developing</b> <b>the</b> troop's program with the advice of the Scoutmaster.|$|E

5|$|Crystal Dynamics is {{best known}} <b>for</b> <b>developing</b> <b>the</b> Legacy of Kain and Gex series. Although the first Legacy of Kain video game was {{developed}} by Silicon Knights, Crystal Dynamics gained {{the rights to the}} franchise in 1998 and developed four sequels between 1999 and 2003. In 2003, the studio took over the development of the best-selling Tomb Raider franchise after its original developer, Core Design, failed to gain critical or commercial success with their later games. Crystal Dynamics' first Tomb Raider game, , became a commercial success with 4.5 million copies sold as of February 2009. Its sequel, , sold 2.6 million copies and became the first game the studio developed for the PlayStation 3. Since 2003, the studio has focused development on the Tomb Raider franchise with the help of other studios such as Buzz Monkey Software and Nixxes Software. Crystal Dynamics has developed five games in the series, encompassing two reboots of the franchise.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the closure}} of the chapel in the 1980s, the size of the {{congregation}} had declined and the fabric of the building was deteriorating. In 1978 the decorative plaster ceiling was replaced with a suspended ceiling of acoustic tiles, with further repairs carried out under the Manpower Services Commission. During the course of these repairs, discussions took place {{about the future of the}} building and its dwindling congregation. None of the ideas <b>for</b> <b>developing</b> <b>the</b> building came to fruition, and worship in the chapel ended in December 1985. Permission to demolish the building was refused because of its listed status. It was bought by a private individual in 1987, but the plan to convert it into a nightclub was declined. The building was acquired by the Bethesda Heritage Trust in 2000. After the Bethesda Heritage Trust failed to raise sufficient finance to continue worship, in 2002 it passed into the ownership of the Historic Chapels Trust, an organisation which aims to find community uses for the buildings in its care.|$|E

5|$|Starting in 1927, Bush {{constructed}} a differential analyzer, an analog computer that could solve differential equations {{with as many}} as 18 independent variables. This invention arose from previous work performed by Herbert R. Stewart, one of Bush's masters students, who at Bush's suggestion created the integraph, a device for solving first-order differential equations, in 1925. Another student, Harold Hazen, proposed extending the device to handle second-order differential equations. Bush immediately realized the potential of such an invention, for these were much more difficult to solve, but also quite common in physics. Under Bush's supervision, Hazen was able to construct the differential analyzer, a table-like array of shafts and pens that mechanically simulated and plotted the desired equation. Unlike earlier designs that were purely mechanical, the differential analyzer had both electrical and mechanical components. Among the engineers who made use of the differential analyzer was General Electric's Edith Clarke, who used it to solve problems relating to electric power transmission. <b>For</b> <b>developing</b> <b>the</b> differential analyzer, Bush was awarded the Franklin Institute's Louis E. Levy Medal in 1928.|$|E
