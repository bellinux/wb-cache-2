5|$|Prices for the West Berlin S-Bahn {{were kept}} {{slightly}} below the fares of the West Berlin BVG. In East Berlin, a <b>flat</b> <b>fee</b> of 0.20 Mark was charged until 1991. West Berlin politics {{and most of}} the populace fully boycotted the S-Bahn, which was run by the East German railways, and introduced bus and U-Bahn lines running parallel to the S-Bahn network and the Stadtbahn.|$|E
5|$|A routine became {{established}} in which salesmen {{would provide the}} duckers with labels. The duckers would mark their ducklings with the labels of the firm to whom they wished them to be sold in London. The railway companies would collect ducklings, {{take them to the}} stations, ship them to London and deliver them to the designated firms, in return for a <b>flat</b> <b>fee</b> per bird. By avoiding the need for the duckers to travel to market, or the London salesmen to collect the ducklings, this arrangement benefited all concerned, and ducking became very profitable. By 1870 the duck industry was bringing over £20,000 per year into Aylesbury; a typical ducker would make a profit of around £80–£200 per year.|$|E

30|$|To remove this disincentive, all APCDs in California {{should stop}} {{charging}} per-area fees to land management agencies. Instead, <b>flat</b> <b>fees</b> that cover an entire fire season {{should be used}} to help pay APCDs for staff and monitoring efforts, which help to identify burn windows for land management agencies (currently, some APCDs charge no <b>fee,</b> some charge <b>flat</b> <b>fees,</b> and some charge per-area fees for prescribed burns and managed natural ignitions). This would remove the often-prohibitive costs associated with using fire as a management tool to address the root cause of large high-severity fires at the landscape level.|$|R
5|$|In 1991, the Athens Airport {{charged a}} 25% higher landing fee for those {{aircraft}} arriving between 11:00 and 17:00 during the high tourism season during summer. Hong Kong charges an additional <b>flat</b> <b>fee</b> {{to the basic}} weight charge. In 1991–92 peak pricing at London's main airports Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted was implemented; airlines were charged different landing fees for peak and off-peak operations depending on the weight of aircraft. For example, {{in the case of}} a Boeing 757, the peak landing fee was about 2.5 times higher than the off-peak fee in all three airports. For a Boeing 747 the differential was even higher, as the old 747 carries a higher noise charge. Though related to runway congestion, the main objective of these peak charges at the major British airports was to raise revenue for investment.|$|E

Bars and clubs are prohibited from having a 'ladies' night' or any pricing which is regarded as discriminatory. Police officers are prohibited from working for licensed businesses in the same town where they are employed, and some municipalities require fingerprinting for all liquor store and bar employees.|$|E
5|$|Macartney scored 2,207 runs {{during the}} tour {{at an average}} of 45.04. During the English season, he reached the peak of his {{performance}} as an all-rounder, taking 38 wickets. He made six centuries, including two in one match against Sussex. Apart from his 99 at Lord's, Macartney did not pass 34 in the other Tests and ended with 197 runs at 32.83. He did not bowl heavily during the series, taking six wickets at 23.66. It was not a happy tour for the Australians; without the senior players, there were frequent reports of drunken brawls and verbal abuse towards the locals. Macartney was one of only four players to accept the guaranteed tour fee of 400 pounds; the others signed up to a percentage share of the profits and the commercial failure of the tour left them with {{less than half of the}} <b>flat</b> <b>fee.</b>|$|E

5|$|The major studios, {{at first}} {{resistant}} to the double feature, soon adapted. All established B units to provide films for the expanding second-feature market. Block booking became standard practice: {{to get access to}} a studio's attractive A pictures, many theaters were obliged to rent the company's entire output for a season. With the B films rented at a <b>flat</b> <b>fee</b> (rather than the box office percentage basis of A films), rates could be set virtually guaranteeing the profitability of every B movie. The parallel practice of blind bidding largely freed the majors from worrying about their Bs' quality—even when booking in less than seasonal blocks, exhibitors had to buy most pictures sight unseen. The five largest studios—Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Paramount Pictures, Fox Film Corporation (20th Century Fox as of 1935), Warner Bros., and RKO Radio Pictures (descendant of FBO)—also belonged to companies with sizable theater chains, further securing the bottom line.|$|E
5|$|Cohen had {{acquired}} reprint {{rights to the}} magazines' back issues, although Wrzos did get Cohen to agree to print one new story every issue. Cohen was also producing reprint magazines such as Great Science Fiction and Science Fiction Classics, but no payment was made to authors {{for any of these}} reprints. This brought Cohen into conflict with the Science Fiction Writers of America (SFWA), a professional writers' organization formed in 1965. Soon SFWA called for a boycott of Ultimate's magazines until Cohen agreed to make payments. Cohen agreed to pay a <b>flat</b> <b>fee</b> for all stories, and then in August 1967 this was changed to a graduated rate, depending on the length of the story. Harry Harrison had acted as an intermediary in Cohen's negotiations with SFWA, and when Wrzos left in 1967, Cohen asked Harrison to take over. SF Impulse, which Harrison had been editing, had folded in February 1967, so Harrison was available. He secured Cohen's agreement that the policy of printing almost nothing but reprinted stories would be phased out {{by the end of the}} year, and took over as editor with the September 1967 issue.|$|E

25|$|With {{his novels}} {{providing}} scant income, Thompson turned to {{other forms of}} writing to pay the bills. Beginning in 1959, and continuing through the mid-1960s, Thompson also began writing television programs, including episodes of the action/adventure shows Mackenzie's Raiders (1959), Cain's Hundred (1961) and Convoy (1965). TV work seemingly dried up for Thompson after this point, so he turned to writing tie-in novels based on produced TV shows and screenplays: this work paid a <b>flat</b> <b>fee,</b> and could be completed quickly. Thompson's tie-ins include an original novel based on the TV series Ironside (1967), as well as screenplay novelizations of the films The Undefeated (1969) and Nothing But a Man (1970).|$|E
25|$|Aspiring songwriters came to {{demonstrate}} tunes {{they hoped to}} sell. When tunes were purchased from unknowns with no previous hits, the name of someone with the firm was often added as co-composer (in order to keep {{a higher percentage of}} royalties within the firm), or all rights to the song were purchased outright for a <b>flat</b> <b>fee</b> (including rights to put someone else's name on the sheet music as the composer). An extraordinary number of East European immigrants became the music publishers and song writers on Tin Pan Alley-the most famous being Irving Berlin.

50|$|Typically lawyers’ {{fees are}} based on a number of factors, which may include the time and energy spent on a case, the outcome of a case, the {{difficulty}} of a claim, the experience and prominence of the lawyer, and the costs associated with the case.

25|$|From 1957, Italian {{workers had}} partly been {{sheltered}} from the falling value of money {{by what was}} termed a “moving staircase,” which automatically raised wages as prices increased. In 1975, this provision was extended so that all workers received a <b>flat</b> <b>fee</b> that automatically compensated them {{for as much as}} 75% of the previous three months’ price increases. This meant in practice that money wages rose faster than the cost of living, because better-paid groups fought for extra sums to maintain their differentials, and also because various industries negotiated local and national wage deals in addition to the increments that all workers received. By 1985, the average Italian was twice as rich in real terms as he was in 1960.|$|E
25|$|Because ETFs {{trade on}} an exchange, each {{transaction}} is generally {{subject to a}} brokerage commission. Commissions depend on the brokerage and which plan is chosen by the customer. For example, a typical <b>flat</b> <b>fee</b> schedule from an online brokerage firm in the United States ranges from $10 to $20, {{but it can be}} as low as $0 with discount brokers. Due to this commission cost, the amount invested has a great bearing; someone who wishes to invest $100 per month may have a significant percentage of their investment destroyed immediately, while for someone making a $200,000 investment, the commission cost may be negligible. Generally, mutual funds obtained directly from the fund company itself do not charge a brokerage fee. Thus, when low or no-cost transactions are available, ETFs become very competitive.|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} {{business model}} for video rental stores had traditionally been {{to pay a}} large <b>flat</b> <b>fee</b> per video, approximately $65, and offer unlimited rentals for the lifetime of the medium itself. Sumner Redstone, whose Viacom conglomerate then owned Blockbuster, personally pioneered a new revenue-sharing arrangement for video in the mid-1980s. Blockbuster obtained videos for little cost and kept a 60% of the rental fee, paying the other 40% to the studio, and reporting rental information through Rentrak. In addition to benefiting from a lower initial price, Blockbuster also capitalized {{on the fact that}} movies were generally not available for purchase at affordable price points during initial release periods. Thus customers had a choice to rent, wait, or buy the film on tape at the much higher manufacturer's suggested retail price targeted at other rental chains and film enthusiasts, which at that time ranged between $70–$100 per title.|$|E
