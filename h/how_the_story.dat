5|$|Coinciding with Arkham Origins United Kingdom launch, voice actors Roger Craig Smith and Troy Baker made {{a public}} {{appearance}} at Stratford's GAME retailer. A series of game-character action figures and a working, life-size grapnel-gun replica were released in October 2013 by DC Collectibles and NECA, respectively. In December 2013, a digital comic {{book of the}} same name was released by digital studio Madefire with a prequel to the game. The comic is the first in DC Comics' DC Multiverse initiative, featuring dynamic artwork and sound and the ability to choose while reading <b>how</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> progresses (with several possible outcomes). Purchasing all eight chapters unlocks two costumes for the game.|$|E
5|$|During certain {{situations}} the player {{will be put}} in a perilous situation, where they will be prompted to choose between two possible actions or suffer a certain penalty, if not instant death. These choices affect <b>how</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> unfolds and which ending is achieved. Additionally, a creature called Nemesis is encountered multiple times throughout the game as a recurring boss. Nemesis is considerably more powerful than the player and has the ability to use a rocket launcher as a weapon, dodge incoming fire, and pursue the player from one area to the next. During one of these encounters, the player can choose to either fight Nemesis or run until he is evaded. A variety of encounters are possible, with some being mandatory, and some varying in nature and location based on certain choices made by the player. Even if evaded or defeated during one of these encounters, Nemesis will inevitably continue to pursue the player {{until the end of the}} game.|$|E

5|$|The film's opening was {{considered}} a hit taking into account <b>how</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> was not based on a popular existing source, and the film itself was void of the franchise's main character, Harry Potter. It was the top choice among moviegoers, representing 47% of the weekend's total $157.6 million tickets sales. On its second Friday, it had a gradual drop of 37% ($18.5 million) from the week before, the second best Friday drop for any Harry Potter film, behind The Philosopher's Stone. This was {{in part due to}} Black Friday, the most lucrative day of the Thanksgiving Day stretch. It ended up grossing $45.1 million in its second weekend (a drop of just 39.4%), finishing 2nd at the box office behind newcomer Moana.|$|E
5|$|Peet {{decided to}} follow closely the dramatic, dark, and {{sinister}} tone of Kipling's book, {{which is about the}} struggles between animals and man. However, the film's writers decided to make the story more straightforward, as the novel is very episodic, with Mowgli going {{back and forth from the}} jungle to the Man-Village, and Peet felt that Mowgli returning to the Man-Village should be the ending for the film. Following suggestions, Peet also created two original characters: The human girl for which Mowgli falls in love, as the animators considered that falling in love would be the best excuse for Mowgli to leave the jungle; and Louie, king of the monkeys. Louie was a less comical character, enslaving Mowgli trying to get the boy to teach him to make fire. The orangutan would also show a plot point borrowed from The Second Jungle Book, gold and jewels under his ruins— after Mowgli got to the man village, a poacher would drag the boy back to the ruins in search for the treasure. Disney was not pleased with <b>how</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> was turning out, as he felt it was too dark for family viewing and insisted on script changes. Peet refused, and after a long argument, Peet left the Disney studio in January 1964.|$|E

5|$|Quatermass II {{received}} positive newspaper {{reviews in}} the Daily Mail and the Daily Express, although the BBC's Radio Times listings magazine published letters of both praise and criticism for the serial. The serial was also criticised internally at the BBC by Cecil McGivern, who felt {{it to be}} {{not as good as}} the original. One letter received by the production team before the transmission of episode five came from a woman in Haverfordwest who was concerned that she would never find out what happened in the end as the week before the final episode's transmission she was due to move to Ireland {{to spend the rest of}} her life in a convent; she wondered if the BBC could possibly write to her and let her know <b>how</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> resolved. After some debate as to whether the letter was a journalistic trick to uncover advance story details, Kneale eventually decided that it was genuine, and allowed Cartier to send a reply outlining the storyline's conclusion. Following episode six, some viewers wrote in to the BBC concerned at Quatermass's survival, as he had not been seen to definitely return to Earth in the experimental rocket ship.|$|E

25|$|Rising Storm {{was mostly}} well {{received}} by critics. In one review by Booklist, the reviewer calls the novel suspenseful, also noting <b>how</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> echoes {{the journey to}} maturity. Another review, by VOYA, noted that while the books lacks humor and depth, there was still appeal in the hidden world of the warrior cats. A BookLoons review particularly praised the ending, calling it a cliffhanger. However, Children's Literature was not as positive, saying it was getting hard to remember all of the characters' relatives and leaders.|$|E

25|$|The {{game was}} also the first and only in the {{original}} series under the direction of LucasArts that never actually took place on Monkey Island. However, it is revealed in the following game, The Curse of Monkey Island, that the Carnival of the Damned seen in the LeChuck's Revenges conclusion was actually part of Monkey Island. The game's creator, Ron Gilbert, departed from Lucas Arts after the second game. He stated on his blog that he had a clear vision what the ending in the second game meant, <b>how</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> will develop from here, and that the story development Lucas Arts came up with in his absence was not close to his ideas.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes the narrator's {{unreliability}} is made immediately evident. For instance, a {{story may}} open with the narrator making a plainly false or delusional claim or admitting to being severely mentally ill, or {{the story itself}} may have a frame in which the narrator appears as a character, with clues to the character's unreliability. A more dramatic use of the device delays the revelation until near the story's end. In some cases, the reader discovers that in the foregoing narrative, the narrator had concealed or greatly misrepresented vital pieces of information. Such a twist ending forces readers to reconsider {{their point of view}} and experience of the story. In some cases the narrator's unreliability is never fully revealed but only hinted at, leaving readers to wonder how much the narrator should be trusted and <b>how</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> should be interpreted.|$|E
25|$|Critical {{comments}} on these speculations appeared early on. But as psychiatric historian Jan Armbruster (University of Greifswald) judged, {{they were not}} sufficiently convincing, {{such as in the}} case of journalist Ottmar Katz, author of a biography of Hitler's personal physician, Theodor Morell (1982). Katz suggested that Karl Kroner might have had personal reasons to report some untruths: living as a Jewish refugee in Reykjavik and forced to earn his life as a blue-collar worker, Kroner possibly hoped that the U.S. authorities would not only acknowledge him as a key witness but also help him to reestablish his medical practice. A comprehensive plausibility test was finally performed by the Berlin psychiatrist and psychotherapist Peter Theiss-Abendroth in 2008. In 2009, Armbruster carried this analysis forward, dismantled the hypotheses of Hitler’s hysteria diagnosis and hypnotherapy completely, and showed in detail <b>how</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> of Hitler’s alleged treatment by Forster became progressively elaborate and detailed between 1943 and 2006, not due to the evaluation of historical documents, but to continuous addition of narrative embellishments. Furthermore, Armbruster’s work offers the to date most comprehensive critique of the methodological weaknesses of many Hitler pathographies.|$|E

25|$|Richard Eisenbeis of Anime Now {{called the}} series his most {{anticipated}} anime of the season, being curious {{about how it}} would handle the adaptation of a branching story into a single one. Bamboo Dong, Paul Jensen, Rebecca Silverman and Theron Martin at Anime News Network reviewed episode 0 and 1 {{as part of a}} preview of that anime season. Dong did not expect the anime's ending to be good, but was still interested in <b>how</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> would turn out, and appreciated the use of Chaos;Head-like visuals and atmosphere. Jensen did not, however, think the atmosphere worked, saying that it seemed like the show was intended to give a feeling of dread, but that it failed to do so, partially due to the large amount of information communicated to the viewer. Silverman thought episode 1, with the exception of some sequences, felt bland, but still worth watching for a few more episodes to get a grasp of what direction the story would take. Martin thought the story moved slightly too fast, resulting in some character motivations being weakly established. He enjoyed the visuals and music, but said that the character design, while attractive, looked unoriginal.|$|E
