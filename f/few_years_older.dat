Although several books portray Holton's husband as an old man who quickly vanished along with his wife, Dr. Holton was actually a fellow Michigan alumnus, only a <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>older</b> than Holmes, and both Holtons remained in Englewood throughout Holmes' life and survived well into the 20th century; the idea that Holmes killed them is strictly fiction.|$|E

He pushes George to keep his promise to marry Amelia even though Dobbin is in love with Amelia himself.

Though already married, Giachetti bore Caruso four sons during their liaison, which lasted from 1897 to 1908.

Information provided in Scott's biography of Caruso suggests that she was his vocal coach {{as well as his}} lover. Statements by Enrico Caruso, Jr. in his book tend to substantiate this. Her relationship with Caruso broke down after 11 years and they separated. Giachetti's subsequent attempts to sue him for damages were dismissed by the courts.|$|E

500|$|Art Modell, a New York {{advertising}} executive, {{bought the}} team in 1961 for almost $4 million ($ today). Modell, who was 35 {{years old at the}} time, bought out Brown's 15% stake in the team for $500,000 and gave Brown a new eight-year contract. He said he and Brown would have a [...] "working partnership", and began to play a more direct role than previous owners in the team's operation. [...] This angered Brown, who was used to having a free hand in football matters. Modell, who was single and only a <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>older</b> than most players, started to listen to their concerns about the coach. He became particularly close to Jim Brown, calling him [...] "my senior partner". Modell sat in the press box during games and could be overheard second-guessing Paul Brown's play-calling, which drove a deeper wedge between the two men. At that time, Brown was the only coach who insisted on calling every offensive play. When Plum openly questioned Paul Brown's absolute control over play-calling, he was traded to Detroit.|$|E

[...] Scott Juba of The Trades {{considered}} [...] "Behind These Hazel Eyes" [...] as {{the highlight of the}} album, writing [...] "Now that [...] a <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>older</b> than she was when she recorded her first album, she brings more authenticity to relationship songs." [...] Evan Sawdey of PopMatters compared [...] "Don't Let Me Stop You" [...] (2009) with [...] "Behind These Hazel Eyes" [...] saying that the former [...] "may sound like another rewrite of an older Clarkson hit (in this case, [...] "Behind These Hazel Eyes"), but the observational lyrics about a questionable relationship are what ultimately makes the whole thing click." [...] Charles Merwin of Stylus Magazine felt that the song should sell records more because [...] "the entire musical backing drops out to let Clarkson’s voice through to live or die on its own." [...] Pam Avoledo of Blogcritics believed that [...] "Behind These Hazel Eyes" [...] was superior to the writing of [...] "Since U Been Gone", commenting that [...] "It's punchier, well-written and gives Clarkson a chance to show off her vocal skills without the trendy haughtiness." [...] Joe Cross of Cox Communications thought that [...] "Behind These Hazel Eyes" [...] was a decent follow-up to [...] "Since U Been Gone", saying [...] "It's no [...] "Since U Been Gone" [...] which is just a pop-rock juggernaut, but as follow-ups go, it's not too shabby. Clarkson's down-home everything (well, mostly her looks) sells these little heartbreak haikus exceptionally well." [...] He also listed [...] "Behind These Hazel Eyes" [...] as one of the 40 songs that defined the summer of 2005. The same sentiment was echoed by Robert Copsey of Digital Spy who considered the song as Clarkson's second best single after [...] "Since U Been Gone", writing [...] "It proved a slow burner at the time of release, but this track's greatness continues to be realised over time." ...|$|E
500|$|According to {{producer}} Don Hahn, Beaumont's Belle is an [...] "incredibly passive" [...] character, {{the personality}} of whom he likened to those of Sleeping Beauty and Cinderella, as well as American actress and animal rights activist Doris Day, describing them as women who are [...] "capable, but filling a role that women might fill in the 1950s and 1960s.” The filmmakers painstakingly reworked Belle into a more three-dimensional character by providing her with goals and aspirations beyond romance and marriage, while expanding her passive role into that of a more inquisitive heroine. Determined to have Belle resemble [...] "an unusual Disney heroine," [...] Woolverton deliberately molded her into an independent character {{who is not a}} princess, enjoys books and has little interest in marriage, and worked closely with Ashman to create a proactive heroine [...] "who was a thinker and a reader and she wasn’t about what she looked like and she wasn’t a victim." [...] Although Belle being well-read is mentioned in the original fairy tale, it is hardly important to its plot. Thus, Belle's passion for reading was vastly expanded upon, borrowing from both the Little Woman character Jo March and Woolverton's own love of reading to further demonstrate the character's intelligence and open mind. Both Woolverton and O'Hara encouraged the filmmakers to emphasize the intelligent and book-loving aspects of Belle's personality. However, at times the animators struggled to fulfill Woolverton's vision. Originally, Belle was depicted constantly crying throughout her imprisonment; Woolverton resented this, arguing that the character was {{much more likely to be}} either searching for an escape or simply [...] "be intrigued that she was living in an enchanted castle" [...] than crying. [...] "Once everybody realized she wasn’t going to be this typical Disney female, they would go to the extreme ... She became bitchy"; the screenwriter argued that Belle would be [...] "too smart" [...] to act this way. A <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>older</b> than The Little Mermaids Ariel, Belles' love of reading makes the character more worldly and mature than her predecessor. Belle is believed by Henn to be [...] "probably" [...] the oldest of Disney's princesses, at 20 years of age.|$|E

Max Payne now works in executive protection for the wealthy Rodrigo Branco and his family in the hopes of escaping the memories of his troubled past.
