50|$|The Watford <b>Joint</b> <b>Tube</b> Stock {{was built}} for the service to Watford along both the Bakerloo tube and the London North Western Railway. As a result, the cars were owned by both the Underground and the London North Western Railway. To be able to operate on both lines, the car floors were 4.5 in higher than other tube cars.

50|$|The <b>joint</b> <b>tube</b> {{stock was}} {{replaced}} on Bakerloo line services in 1930-31, the LMS retaining three sets {{for use on}} branch lines until 1946.

In 1952, they were converted to prototype 25 kV AC overhead EMUs (Class AM1) and ran on the Lancaster-Morecambe-Heysham line until 1966. The Oerlikon stock trains were replaced between 1957 and 1960 by Class 501 units, and a motor car, DMBT No. 28249, is currently exhibited at the National Railway Museum, York. The LMS electric units were withdrawn in 1963.|$|E

Complex {{geometry}} of structures (<b>joints,</b> <b>tubes,</b> cylinder, etc.) often limits {{the ability to}} evaluate their integrity using standard nondestructive testing and evaluation methods.

40|$|A {{process for}} {{developing}} long-length <b>joint</b> <b>tube</b> assembly of Bi- 2223 (10 wt% Ag) superconductor is presented. The process involves sintering of tubes fabricated from cold isostatic pressing of the partially preformed Bi- 2223 (10 wt% Ag) superconducting powder. The joint was made between these sintered tubes. For making joints, sintered tubes were physically joined by connecting {{together on a}} common superconducting bush coated with a superconducting paste. Subsequently, {{the combination of the}} bush and the physically joined portion were sintered. The superconducting properties and phase identification/phase composition of the component tubes and of the joint portions have been investigated. The diametral fractural strength of the component tubes and of the joint portion was also evaluated. In the joint obtained according to this method, it is possible to retain the superconducting properties and the fractural strength of the joint high-temperature superconducting tubes. This technique is very useful for fabrication of very large sized superconducting apparatuses such as external magnetic shielding, transmission cables and electrical current leads, et...|$|E

50|$|Pressure drop {{is defined}} as the {{difference}} in total pressure between two points of a fluid carrying network. Pressure drop occurs when frictional forces, caused by the resistance to flow, act on a fluid as it flows through the tube. The main determinants of resistance to fluid flow are fluid velocity through the pipe and fluid viscosity. Pressure drop increases proportional to the frictional shear forces within the piping network. A piping network containing a high relative roughness rating as well as many pipe fittings and <b>joints,</b> <b>tube</b> convergence, divergence, turns, surface roughness and other physical properties will affect the pressure drop. High flow velocities and / or high fluid viscosities result in a larger pressure drop across a section of pipe or a valve or elbow. Low velocity will result in lower or no pressure drop.|$|R

40|$|In {{support of}} the Deep Space Habitat project a number of {{composite}} rack prototypes were developed, designed, fabricated and tested to various extents (with the International Standard Payload Rack configuration, or crew quarters, as a baseline). This paper focuses specifically on a composite rack prototype with a direct tie in to Space Station hardware. The outlined prototype is an all composite construction, excluding metallic fasteners, washers, and their associated inserts. The rack utilizes braided carbon composite tubing for the frame with the sidewalls, backwall and flooring sections utilizing aircraft grade composite honeycomb sandwich panels. Novel additively manufactured thermoplastic <b>joints</b> and <b>tube</b> inserts were also developed {{in support of this}} effort. <b>Joint</b> and <b>tube</b> insert screening tests were conducted at a preliminary level. The screening tests allowed for modification, and enhancement, of the fabrication and design approaches, which will be outlined. The initial joint tests did not include mechanical fasteners. Adhesives were utilized at the <b>joint</b> to composite <b>tube</b> interfaces, along with mechanical fasteners during final fabrication (thus creating a stronger joint than the adhesive only variant). In general the prototype was focused on a potential in-space assembly approach, or kit-of-parts construction concept, which would not necessarily require the inclusion of an adhesive in the joint regions. However, given the tie in to legacy Station hardware (and potential flight loads with imbedded hardware mass loadings), the rack was built as stiff and strong as possible. Preliminary torque down tests were also conducted to determine the feasibility of mounting the composite honeycomb panels to the composite tubing sections via the additively manufactured tube inserts. Additional fastener torque down tests were also conducted with inserts (helicoils) imbedded within the joints. Lessons learned are also included and discussed...|$|R
