25|$|In 329 BC, Alexander, {{while in}} Sogdiana, created a 1,000 strong unit of horse archers that was {{recruited}} from various Iranian peoples. They were very effective at scouting and in screening {{the rest of}} the army from the enemy. Firing their bows whilst mounted, they offered highly mobile missile fire on the battlefield. At the Battle of Hydaspes, the massed fire of the horse archers was effective at <b>disordering</b> the Indian cavalry and helped to neutralise the Indian chariots.|$|E
25|$|Boltzmann {{accomplished}} the feat of {{showing that the}} second law of thermodynamics is only a statistical fact. The gradual <b>disordering</b> of energy {{is analogous to the}} <b>disordering</b> of an initially ordered pack of cards under repeated shuffling, and just as the cards will finally return to their original order if shuffled a gigantic number of times, so the entire universe must some-day regain, by pure chance, the state from which it first set out. (This optimistic coda to the idea of the dying universe becomes somewhat muted when one attempts to estimate the timeline which will probably elapse before it spontaneously occurs.) The tendency for entropy increase seems to cause difficulty to beginners in thermodynamics, but is easy to understand {{from the standpoint of the}} theory of probability. Consider two ordinary dice, with both sixes face up. After the dice are shaken, the chance of finding these two sixes face up is small (1 in 36); thus one can say that the random motion (the agitation) of the dice, like the chaotic collisions of molecules because of thermal energy, causes the less probable state to change to one that is more probable. With millions of dice, like the millions of atoms involved in thermodynamic calculations, the probability of their all being sixes becomes so vanishingly small that the system must move to one of the more probable states. However, mathematically the odds of all the dice results not being a pair sixes is also as hard as the ones of all of them being sixes, and since statistically the data tend to balance, one in every 36 pairs of dice will tend to be a pair of sixes, and the cards -when shuffled- will sometimes present a certain temporary sequence order even if in its whole the deck was disordered.|$|E

500|$|Phase 1: Khalid {{ordered a}} general {{attack on the}} Byzantine front and galloped his cavalry around the left wing of the Byzantines. Part of his cavalry engaged the Byzantine left wing cavalry {{while the rest of}} it {{attacked}} the rear of the Byzantine left wing infantry. Meanwhile, the Muslim right wing pressed against it from the front. Under this two-pronged attack, the Byzantine left wing fell back and collapsed and fell back to the Byzantine left center, greatly <b>disordering</b> it. [...] The remaining Muslim cavalry then attacked the Byzantine left wing cavalry at the rear while they were held frontally by {{the other half of the}} Muslim cavalry, routing them off the battlefield to the north.|$|E

60|$|DEAR HOWELLS,--I, too, was as sorry as I could be; yes, and desperately disappointed. I even did {{a heroic}} thing: shipped my book off to New York lest I should forget {{hospitality}} and embitter your visit with it. Not that I think you wouldn't {{like to read}} it, for I think you would; but not on a holiday that's not the time. I see how you were situated--another familiarity of Providence and wholly wanton intrusion--and of course we could not help ourselves. Well, just think of it: a while ago, while Providence's attention was absorbed in <b>disordering</b> some time-tables so as {{to break up a}} trip of mine to Mr. Church's on the Hudson, that Johnstown dam got loose.

60|$|The {{next day}} the army having passed the Elbe at Wittenberg, and joined the Saxon army near Torgau, his Majesty caused both armies to draw up in battalia, giving every brigade the same post in the lines as he purposed to fight in. I must do {{the memory of that}} glorious general this honour, that I never saw an army drawn up with so much variety, order, and exact {{regularity}} since, though I have seen many armies drawn up by some of the greatest captains of the age. The order by which his men were directed to flank and relieve one another, the methods of receiving one body of men if disordered into another, and rallying one squadron without <b>disordering</b> another was so admirable; the horse everywhere flanked lined and defended by the foot, and the foot by the horse, and both by the cannon, was such that if those orders were but as punctually obeyed, 'twere impossible to put an army so modelled into any confusion.|$|E
60|$|This {{system must}} have an {{immediate}} tendency towards <b>disordering</b> the trade of India, and must finally end in great detriment to the Company itself. The effect of the restrictive system on the weaver is evident. The authority given to the servants to buy at an advanced price did of necessity furnish means and excuses for every sort of fraud in their purchases. The instant the servant of a merchant is admitted on his own judgment to overbid the market, or to send goods to his master which shall sell at loss, {{there is no longer}} any standard upon which his unfair practices can be estimated, or any effectual means by which they can be restrained. The hope entertained by the Directors, of confining this destructive practice of giving an enhanced price to a particular spot, must ever be found totally delusive. Speculations will be affected by this artificial price in every quarter in which markets can have the least communication with each other.|$|E

60|$|The little cards, however, {{with names}} {{engraved}} on them, are {{a more serious}} problem than the flowers.

The little demons {{are the source of}} as many reprieves, calamities, and anxieties as the battle itself. Sometimes Mrs. Bonham has just gone out; at others she is at home.

60|$|Whether I {{really had}} been down in Garden Court {{in the dead}} of the night, groping about for the boat that I {{supposed}} to be there; whether I had two or three times come to myself on the staircase with great terror, not knowing how I had got out of bed; whether I had found myself lighting the lamp, possessed by the idea that he was coming up the stairs, and that the lights were blown out; whether I had been inexpressibly harassed by the distracted talking, laughing, and groaning of some one, and had half suspected those sounds to be of my own making; whether there had been a closed iron furnace in a dark corner of the room, and a voice had called out, over and over again, that Miss Havisham was consuming within it,--these were things that I tried to settle with myself and get into some order, as I lay that morning on my bed.
