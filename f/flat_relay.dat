40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{performance}} of a near field wireless power transfer system that uses curved relay resonator to extend transfer distance. Near field wireless power transfer operates based on the near-field electromagnetic coupling of coils. Such a system can transfer energy over a relatively short distance which is of the same order of dimensions of the coupled coils. The energy transfer distance can be increased using <b>flat</b> <b>relay</b> resonators. Recent developments in printing electronics and e-textiles have seen increasing demand of embedding electronics into fabrics. Near field wireless power transfer {{is one of the most}} promising methods to power electronics on fabrics. The concept can be applied to body-worn textiles by, for example, integrating a transmitter coil into upholstery, and a flexible receiver coil into garments. Flexible textile coils take on the shape of the supporting materials such as garments, and therefore curved resonator and receiver coils are investigated in this work. Experimental results showed that using curved relay resonator can effectively extend the wireless power transfer distance. However, as the curvature of the coil increases, {{the performance of}} the wireless power transfer, especially the maximum received power, deteriorates...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{transmission}} over time-selective, <b>flat</b> fading <b>relay</b> channels is studied. It {{is assumed}} that channel fading coefficients are not known a priori. Transmission takes place in two phases: network training phase and data transmission phase. In the training phase, pilot symbols are sent and the receivers employ single-pilot MMSE estimation or noncausal Wiener filter to learn the channel. Amplify-and-Forward (AF) and Decode-and-Forward (DF) techniques are considered in the data transmission phase and achievable rate expressions are obtained. The training period, and data and training power allocations are jointly optimized by using the achievable rate expressions. Numerical results are obtained considering Gauss-Markov and lowpass fading models. Achievable rates are computed and energy-per-bit requirements are investigated. The optimal power distributions among pilot and data symbols are provided. I...|$|R
50|$|In Bell System {{telephone}} exchanges, {{particularly the}} 5XB switches, {{information from the}} marker told the sender that the call required ANI, and stored the calling equipment number in reed relay packs in the sender. The sender used the transverter connector (TVC) to seize a transverter (TV), which was a bay {{of a few hundred}} <b>flat</b> spring <b>relays</b> that controlled all AMA functions. The TV looked in the AMA translator (AMAT) that took care of these particular few thousand lines. AMAT was a rack of ferrite ring cores with cross-connect wires passing through holes of 3 × 4 inches or about a decimeter square, one wire per line. The wire was terminated on a wire wrap peg representing that particular line, and passed through a ring that represented the NNX digits of the billing number, then the M, C, D and finally Units of that number. When queried, AMAT sent a high-current pulse through the wire for that particular line, inducing pulses in the appropriate rings which were amplified by a cold cathode tube amplifier and then by a relay, and sent back to the transverter which supplied it to the sender for transmission by ANI to the tandem office.|$|R
50|$|Martina competed at the London 2012 Summer Olympics, {{again in}} his three disciplines, the 100 metres, 200 metres and 4x100 metre relay. Only {{narrowly}} making it through to the 100 metre semi-final, Martina improved his personal best in the semi-final to 9.91. This race was also the fastest ever semi-final run, with Justin Gatlin running 9.82. In the final, Martina placed sixth behind Usain Bolt, posting 9.94. Martina then competed in the 200 m, where he finished in fifth, again behind Bolt, in 20 seconds <b>flat.</b> In the <b>relay,</b> the Netherlands finished sixth {{in a time of}} 38.39. However, after the Olympics, Martina broke the 200 m national record in Lausanne, lowering the time to 19.85, ending his reasonably successful season.|$|R
40|$|Unbalanced {{power lines}} (whose {{conductors}} are not arranged in the vertices of equilateral triangle) without overhead grounding wire (OGW) besides Fortesque impedances Z 0 and Z 1 =Z 2 have mutual impedances Z 01, Z 10, Z 02, Z 20, Z 12, Z 21. At {{the end of}} the line, negative sequence and in less degree zero sequence of voltage appear which increase with load increasing. Flat phase arrangement 110 kV line with X/R= 4, loaded by active load with resistance tenfold of phase conductor active resistance generates 2. 54 % of negative sequence and 0. 79 % of zero sequence. Inductive load generates less and capacitive – still more asymmetry. Stray capacitances and corona losses do not have any influence. Under asymmetric short circuits impact on relay protection depends on location of special phase: is it located laterally or {{in the middle of the}} <b>flat</b> arrangement. Digital <b>relay</b> protection can easier cope with the phase unbalance effect when the line is untransposed. Balanced voltage at the end of untransposed unbalanced power line can be obtained loading the line with unbalanced load...|$|R
30|$|The optimal {{power and}} time slot {{allocation}} for capacity maximization over <b>flat</b> Rayleigh fading <b>relay</b> channels has been considered in [2 – 4]. The case of power allocation for capacity maximization of single hop parallel Gaussian relay channels (e.g., OFDM systems) under a total power constraint has been treated in [5 – 10]. In particular, in [5], the authors found a sub-optimal power allocation considering half duplex amplify and forward (AF) and a total power constraint at the source and relay nodes. The optimal solution to the previous problem {{has been found in}} [6]. In [7], the authors found the optimal power allocation for half duplex AF and decode and forward (DF) under a source plus relay power constraint of each OFDM sub-channel. Both previous articles assume that the destination node is not directly reachable from the source. In [8], the power allocation for full-duplex [2] DF under a total power constraint (source and relay) is considered. The optimal power allocation for the hybrid use of AF, DF, and direct link transmission is computed in [9], under a source plus relay power constraint of each sub-channel. In [10], the authors found the optimal power allocation for full and half duplex DF under a total power constraint at the source and destination nodes. Cooperation with multiple relays, or relays with multiple antennas have extensively been treated in the wireless literature, cf. e.g., [11, 12] and references therein.|$|R
