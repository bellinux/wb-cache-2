Conditions for periodically updating {{the assessment of}} geothermal energy resources include: increased data from expanded exploration and drilling; development of improved and new technologies for exploration, evaluation, extraction, and use; rapid evolution of geothermal knowledge; and the increased role of geothermal energy in response to changing economic, social, political, and environmental conditions, particularly an increasing awareness of the limits to petroleum and natural gas resources. Accordingly, the U. S. Geological Survey (USGS) plans {{by the end of}} 1978 to update its 1975 assessment of the United States’ geothermal resource, with increased emphasis on several items. The USGS’s joint evaluations of geothermal resource-assessment techniques in the last year with the National Electric Agency of Italy (ENEL) under U. S.

30|$|Figure  4 depicts oil <b>recovery</b> <b>factor</b> versus {{injection}} pressure ratio values. As can be seen, higher pressure ratios result in higher oil <b>recovery</b> <b>factor.</b> This observation {{comes from the}} fact that miscible CO 2 flooding is subjected to a higher oil <b>recovery</b> <b>factor</b> compared to immiscible CO 2 flooding. In the higher pressure ratios (the values close to 1), partial miscibility occurs between the oil and CO 2 phase results in the CO 2 dissolution into oil phase. Dissolution of CO 2 contributes to oil production, as it reduces oil viscosity and capillary pressure. It also causes swelling of the oil, which increases oil saturation in the pore space and subsequently the relative permeability of the oil. All of the mentioned mechanisms improve oil <b>recovery</b> <b>factor</b> during immiscible-CO 2 flooding.|$|R

40|$|The oil {{recovery}} {{can be enhanced}} by surfactant alternating carbonated water (SACW) injection which is considered a new tertiary recovery method. Carbone dioxide (CO 2) concentration, injection pressure and temperature may {{have a significant effect}} on the oil <b>recovery</b> <b>factor.</b> Sand pack core flooding experiments were performed in this research. Glass beads were compacted into stainless steel tube (34. 5 cm length and 3. 8 cm diameter). The synthesis brine water and crude oil saturated the sand pack and aged for 4 days to established real oil reservoir conditions at reservoir temperature, pressure and NaCl salinity of 30, 000 ppm. In addition, Sodium dodecly sulfate (SDS) surfactant solution was used for surfactant flooding. The effectiveness of three parameters on the <b>recovery</b> <b>factor</b> have been studied by applying SACW. Firstly, different carbonation levels of CO 2 in brine water injection such as 100 %, 50 % and 0. 0 %. Secondly, different injection pressures including 1500, 2100 and 2750 psi. Finally, different reservoir temperatures of 40 C, 50 C and 60 C. The procured results revealed that oil <b>recovery</b> <b>factor</b> substantially affected by these parameters.

30|$|An {{accurate}} {{estimation of}} the oil <b>recovery</b> <b>factor</b> is required to analyze {{the performance of the}} method to design the EOR method successfully. In this study, a comprehensive analysis has been carried out to predict the oil <b>recovery</b> <b>factor</b> during the immiscible CO 2 flooding process. Hence, a new dimensionless number (relative radius) is suggested in this study to represent the ratio of pore throat radius-to-core sample radius, using permeability and porosity of the core samples. Additionally, the effects of oil quality and operational conditions were considered using the concept of injection pressure ratio and oil composition number. Also, a new correlation based on the developed dimensionless groups was proposed to predict the oil recovery by CO 2 flooding at the core scale. The results presented in this study suggested that capillary numbers, relative radius, injection pressure ratio, and oil composition number alone could not predict the oil production characteristics {{because there are a lot}} of forces and <b>factors</b> affecting oil <b>recovery</b> <b>factor</b> in porous media. To correlate the competition of forces in a porous media that eventually results in the oil <b>recovery</b> <b>factor,</b> a group of dimensionless numbers is needed that can handle a wide range of data. This allows a good correlation between oil <b>recovery</b> <b>factor</b> and the newly proposed group of dimensionless numbers used in this study. A logarithmic relationship was found between the proposed group and oil <b>factor</b> <b>recovery.</b> Predicted oil <b>recovery</b> <b>factor</b> shows good agreement with experimental data (with 81 % confidence). This correlation is applicable for a wide range of porosity (10.8 – 37.2 %), permeability (1 – 18, 000  mD), injection pressure (2.73 – 11.44  MPa), injection rate (0.1 – 1.0  cm 3 /min), and crude oil types.|$|R
