25|$|Taipei City is also {{famous for}} its effort in garbage recycling, which <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>such</b> a good {{international}} precedent that other countries have sent teams to study the recycling system. After the Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) established a program in 1998 combining the efforts of communities, a financial resource named the Recycling Fund was made available to recycling companies and waste collectors. Manufacturers, vendors and importers of recyclable waste pay fees to the Fund, which uses the money to set firm prices for recyclables and subsidize local recycling efforts. Between 1998 and 2008, the recycling rate increased from 6 percent to 32 percent. This improvement enabled the government of Taipei to demonstrate its recycling system to {{the world at the}} Shanghai World Expo 2010.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1980s and early 1990s {{the work of}} Emily Kngwarreye, from the Utopia {{community}} north east of Alice Springs, became very popular. Although she {{had been involved in}} craftwork for most of her life, it was only when she was in her 80s that she was recognised as a painter. Her works include Earth's Creation. Her styles, which changed every year, have been seen as a mixture of traditional Aboriginal and contemporary Australian. Her rise in popularity has prefigured that of many Indigenous artists from central, northern and western Australia, such as Kngwarreye's niece Kathleen Petyarre, Minnie Pwerle, Dorothy Napangardi, Lena Pwerle, Angelina Ngale (Pwerle) and dozens of others, all of whose works have become highly sought-after. The popularity of these often elderly artists, and the resulting pressure placed upon them and their health, <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>such</b> an issue that some art centres have stopped selling these artists' paintings online, instead placing prospective clients on a waiting list for work.|$|E

500|$|Le Père Goriot {{is widely}} {{considered}} Balzac's essential novel. Its influence on French literature has been considerable, as shown by novelist Félicien Marceau's remark: [...] "We are all children of Le Père Goriot." [...] Brooks refers to its [...] "perfection of form, its economy of means and ends". Martin Kanes, meanwhile, in his book Le Pére Goriot: Anatomy of a Troubled World, calls it [...] "the keystone of the Comédie humaine". It is the central text of Anthony Pugh's voluminous study Balzac's Recurring Characters, and entire chapters {{have been written about}} the detail of the Maison Vauquer. Because it <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>such</b> an important novel for the study of French literature, Le Père Goriot has been translated many times into many languages. Thus, says Balzac biographer Graham Robb, [...] "Goriot is one of the novels of La Comédie humaine that can safely be read in English for what it is." ...|$|E
500|$|Following {{his first}} few appearances, it was {{reported}} that Criss had been confirmed as a series regular for the remainder of season two and for season three of Glee. This was based on comments by Murphy, who said: [...] "Darren <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>such</b> a sensation in one week, which I love. I think there's a hunger for him and a positive relationship role model. He’ll definitely continue through the year and longer." [...] However, the actor later denied that his role had been upgraded and said: [...] "It's never really been officially confirmed to me. I think the option is there and that they want to keep Blaine around." [...] Murphy revealed that Blaine may join New Directions during the third season. Criss hoped that this would not come to pass, as he enjoys being at Dalton Academy, but conceded: [...] "it's not my call. I'm happy to serve whatever story they want." [...] For the third season of Glee, Criss was promoted to a series regular, and Blaine did join New Directions when he transferred to McKinley High to be with Kurt.|$|E
500|$|The {{reviews for}} Hannibal were mixed. Time {{magazine}} wrote: [...] "A banquet of creepy, gory or grotesque incidents {{is on display}} in Hannibal. But this superior sequel has romance in its dark heart." [...] Empire magazine gave it two out of five stars, calling it [...] "laughable to just plain boring, Hannibal is toothless to the end." [...] David Thomson, writing in the British Film Institute magazine Sight & Sound, praised the film. [...] "It works. It's smart, good-looking, sexy, fun...dirty, naughty and knowing." [...] Thomson does make clear, however, {{he is a great}} fan of director Ridley Scott's work. He adds: [...] "It is, literally, that Hannibal Lecter <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>such</b> a household joke that he can't be dreadful again. It seems clear that Anthony Hopkins and Scott saw that, and planned accordingly. That's how the movie was saved." [...] Variety magazine in its review said [...] "Hannibal is not as good as Lambs... ultimately more shallow and crass at its heart than its predecessor, Hannibal is nevertheless tantalizing, engrossing and occasionally startling." ...|$|E

2500|$|With Taiwan's {{political}} liberalization in the 1970s and 1980s, encouraged by Taiwan's changing international status, {{the concept of}} a [...] "Taiwanese people" [...] became politicized by opponents of the KMT.

2500|$|In the 21st century, {{democracy}} <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>such</b> {{a popular}} method of reaching decisions that its application beyond politics {{to other areas}} such as entertainment, food and fashion, consumerism, urban planning, education, art, literature, science and theology has been criticised as [...] "the reigning dogma of our time". The argument suggests that applying a populist or market-driven approach to art and literature (for example), means that innovative creative work goes unpublished or unproduced. In education, {{the argument is that}} essential but more difficult studies are not undertaken. Science, as a truth-based discipline, is particularly corrupted by the idea that the correct conclusion can be arrived at by popular vote.

2500|$|Tensions {{resulting}} from the unauthorized presence of this coalition escalated when Laurent-Désiré Kabila became {{the president of the}} Democratic Republic of the Congo. [...] In 1998, he allied the Congo with Angola, Zimbabwe and other countries to force Rwandan and Ugandan troops out. The web of alliances and the number of conflict-related deaths, estimated around six million, gave the resulting Second Congo War (1998-2003) the popular epithet the “African World War." [...] It {{was one of the most}} deadly conflict in recent history, with most of these deaths being civilian casualties. Estimates from the International Rescue Committee suggest that fewer than 10 percent of victims of these conflict deaths were soldiers killed in direct combat. Violence remained common after 2003, with a number of local conflicts breaking out that have involved kidnapping, torture, and sexual violence of civilians.
