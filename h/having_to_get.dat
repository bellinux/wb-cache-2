This suppression of reproduction {{does not come from}} the queen herself, but rather from fellow workers. This is probably because by letting only the queen produce larvae, the organization and productivity of the colony as a whole increases because conflicts are avoided. Workers are more related to fellow workers' offspring compared to the queen's offspring, but by eliminating the competition and cost of <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> rid of queen eggs, the overall productivity of the colony can increase.|$|E
25|$|In 1981, {{a couple}} of Winterstick team riders went to France at the {{invitation}} of Alain Gaimard, marketing director at Les Arcs. After seeing an early film of this event, French skiers/surfers Augustin Coppey, Olivier Lehaneur, Olivier Roland and Antoine Yarmola made their first successful attempts during the winter of 1983 in France (Val Thorens), using primitive, home-made clones of the Winterstick. Starting with pure powder, skateboard-shaped wooden-boards equipped with aluminium fins, foot-straps and leashes, their technology evolved within a few years to pressed wood/fiber composite boards fitted with polyethylene soles, steel edges and modified ski boot shells. These were more suitable for the mixed conditions encountered while snowboarding mainly off-piste, but <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> back to ski lifts on packed snow.|$|E

Coleman instead faced a relatively unknown (at that time) last minute replacement fighter, up and coming Lion's Den product Pete Williams. In what turned out to be another long and strenuous battle, Coleman appeared to be completely exhausted after 10 minutes; he was fatigued to the point of resting his hands on his knees during the fight. Williams took advantage of Coleman's fatigue and landed a heavy kick to the face, knocking 'The Hammer' out for the first time in his career.|$|E

25|$|Filming of {{an episode}} can usually take a {{considerable}} amount of time to be done and as such, each task is usually filmed back-to-back, rather than weekly as it appears in the broadcast schedule for a series. For each episode, four television crews are used to follow the candidates during a task, and often are focused on picking up on mistakes and issues between candidates, than on their overall performance. The final edit of an episode often trims down a task that took 2–3 days to be done, to fit it within approximately about half of what will be televised for that episode, meaning candidates may appear to make minimal contributions when in reality they made more, while others may not feature as much if Lord Sugar or his advisers feel they did well and completed their duties, as emphasis is often put on moments that can be entertaining for audiences. Often the filming of an episode can hamper the efforts of candidates in a task, due to film crews usually <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> filming permission first from the respective owner of a store or establishment, which can often be a time consuming and cumbersome process as a result, whilst the strict rules of the BBC on product placement and advertising mean candidates have to approach businesses with care when asking them for help.|$|E
25|$|Jade visits her bed-ridden {{father in}} the Emerald City, and offers to use her {{abilities}} to help him walk again. Alan declines his daughter's offer, reasoning that if the Starheart were to once again take over his body, it {{could result in the}} deaths of everyone in the city. Eclipso attacks the city, which results in Jesse Quick <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> Alan to safety. After taking over Jade, Eclipso has the power of the starheart then defeats and possesses the Justice League's reserve roster, and then badly injures the angel Zauriel. With the Justice League outnumbered, Eclipso then reveals his ultimate goal is to somehow kill God. Eclipso then tortures Zauriel, causing his screams {{to attract the attention of}} the new Spectre, Crispus Allen, who he kills, absorbing the Spectre's powers upon his demise. With his newfound abilities, Eclipso reveals that God relies on the collective love of humanity in order to stay alive, and that by destroying the Earth, Eclipso will ultimately kill God once and for all. Just as the members of the JLA prepare to wage a counterattack, Eclipso destroys the moon, apparently dooming all life on Earth. With the moon destroyed, Eclipso then seemingly kills Donna Troy, the physically strongest remaining member of the Justice League. However, it is ultimately revealed that Donna's death was an illusion conjured by Saint Walker, who used his blue power ring to temporarily trap Eclipso in a state of euphoria. After the Atom and Starman break Eclipso's link to his brainwashed slaves, the combined heroes attack Eclipso together, defeating him. In the aftermath it is discovered that Jade and Obsidian can now be within proximity of each other again and their father has control of the Starheart again.|$|E
500|$|According to Nolan, an {{important}} {{theme of the}} sequel is [...] "escalation", extending the ending of Batman Begins, noting [...] "things <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> worse before they get better". While indicating The Dark Knight would continue the themes of Batman Begins, including justice vs. revenge and Bruce Wayne's issues with his father, Nolan emphasized the sequel would also portray Wayne more as a detective, an aspect of his character not fully developed in Batman Begins. Nolan described the friendly rivalry between Bruce Wayne and Harvey Dent as the [...] "backbone" [...] of the film. He also chose to compress the overall storyline, allowing Dent to become Two-Face in The Dark Knight, thus giving the film an emotional arc the unsympathetic Joker could not offer. Nolan acknowledged the title {{was not only a}} reference to Batman, but also the fallen [...] "white knight" [...] Harvey Dent.|$|E

[...] Rothbard was irreligious and agnostic toward the existence of God, describing himself as a [...] "mixture of an agnostic and a Reform Jew." [...] Despite identifying as an agnostic and an atheist, Rothbard was critical of the [...] "left-libertarian hostility to religion". In Rothbard's later years, many of his friends anticipated that he would convert to Catholicism, but he never did. The New York Times obituary called Rothbard [...] "an economist and social philosopher who fiercely defended individual freedom against government intervention." ...|$|E
500|$|Kindt was {{a starter}} at {{defensive}} back {{for most of}} his career. An outspoken player, Kindt was the defensive captain of the team by 1952. He was not afraid to criticize head coach George Halas on some of his coaching decisions, at times <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> separated from each other. One notable incident was during a 1952 loss against the Dallas Texans which Halas decided to start his second sting unit because the Texans were winless prior to the game. Kindt and Halas had to be separated after the final play of the game because Kindt [...] "laughed" [...] at something to his teammates after the Texans won and Halas ran across the field and kicked him. He later blamed Halas for the loss stating [...] "poor defensive strategy". They had a similar incident during a game against the Green Bay Packers after Kindt miscalculated a play which led to touchdown and Halas kicked him in his knees. Kindt later claimed that Halas apologized for the incidents. He was selected to the 1954 Pro Bowl {{as a member of the}} West team, during which he scored a safety after tackling Cleveland Browns quarterback Otto Graham during the second quarter.|$|E

First, the layers of fuel wood take in {{the heat from the}} initial tinder/kindling therefore it is not lost to the surrounding ground.

And secondly, this fire type requires minimal labor, thereby making it ideal as a fire of choice before bedding down for the evening without <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> up periodically to add fuel wood and/or stoke the fire to keep it going.

The team developed a heated rivalry with the Bruins, who were based just two hours northeast of Hartford, because of the fact that they used to play in the same building.

[...] The act was intended to change some of the regulations in the United States surrounding hydropower by making it easier for smaller hydropower stations to be created. [...] According to the bill's proponents, current regulations are unwieldy and represent a significant hurdle to creating more hydropower plants. [...] H.R. 267 would alter those regulations {{to make it easier for}} smaller plants to get approval quickly. [...] The legislation also requires the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to study how to further improve the regulatory process. [...] H.R. 267 would amend the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA) and the Federal Power Act. [...] Currently, hydropower projects the produce 5,000 kilowatts or less of power can avoid <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> certain licenses. [...] H.R. 267 would raise that amount to 10,000 kilowatts, facilitating the speed at which smaller hydropower projects could be built.
