25|$|It {{is not my}} main {{ground of}} {{complaint}} that you have her, even though I loved her dearly; that she has you is my chief regret, a loss that touches me more closely. Loving offenders, I excuse you both thus: you love her, because you know I love her; similarly, she abuses me for my sake, in allowing my friend to have her. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>lose</b> you, my loss is a gain to my love; and losing her, my friend picks up that loss. Both find each other, I lose both, and both lay this cross on me for my sake. But there is one consolation in this thought: my friend and I are one; therefore she loves me alone.|$|E

500|$|Moon {{displayed}} what {{he described}} as a humble and self-deprecating manner during the World Series of Poker, repeatedly acknowledging his lack of poker experience throughout the tournament, and often attributing his success to luck and a high number of strong cards, rather than talent. Moon adopted a phrase, [...] "If I win, I win. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>lose,</b> I lose," [...] which reflected his casual approach to the game. Moon also said one of his philosophies was, [...] "Make the other guy pay to see the cards", a strategy attributed to many re-raises Moon made during the 2009 World Series of Poker despite weak hands. Moon had almost no experience in heads-up poker, which some commentators said factored into his loss against Cada in the final hours of the 2009 World Series. Many fans and commentators praised his working stiff style, with some dubbing him [...] "Darvin Gump", a reference to the underdog protagonist of the 1994 drama film, Forrest Gump. Moon has also been nicknamed the [...] "Luddite Logger" [...] because of his distaste for anything technological, including credit cards and online poker. Moon refused to sign a sponsorship deal with an Internet poker company during the 2009 tournament because {{he said he did not}} want to answer to anybody. Moon wore a New Orleans Saints hat throughout the tournament because, [...] "I like cheering for the underdog." [...] Moon was invited to guest at the Saints games for their entire playoff run in 2010, and watched them win Super Bowl XLIV against the Indianapolis Colts in Miami.|$|E
2500|$|The {{description}} of Gan Ning's night raid on Cao Cao's camp at the Battle of Ruxu {{in the novel}} is more vivid as compared to that mentioned in his biography. Before the raid, Ling Tong led 3,000 troops to engage the enemy and duelled with Zhang Liao before {{he was ordered to}} retreat. When Gan Ning saw that, he told Sun Quan, [...] "Tonight I'll bring only 100 men to raid Cao Cao's camp. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>lose</b> a single soldier, this will not count as one of my contributions." [...] That night, he led 100 horsemen to attack Cao Cao's camp and all of them returned alive after inflicting damage and casualties on the enemy.|$|E
2500|$|Earnhardt is {{a passionate}} Washington Redskins fan {{and has been}} known to have Redskins scores relayed to him during races. [...] "During the race season, [...] I'm under caution, I'm getting stats and numbers told to me over the radio during the race," [...] Earnhardt said. [...] "I've got to know. I can't {{concentrate}} on what I'm doing if I don't know what the Redskins are doing. My fans tell me <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>lose,</b> it ruins their week. But if the Redskins lose, it ruins my week." [...] Earnhardt once dreamed of playing football for the Redskins, but states that he [...] "wasn't built" [...] for it. [...] "I was 5–3 (5'3", 160cm) when I got my driver's license at the age of 16," [...] he said, [...] "so I wasn't going to make much of a football player." [...] He currently owns a Learjet 60 private jet with the tail number N8JR.|$|E

2500|$|In early July 2006, {{when asked}} if he would debate Owens, he said he [...] "wouldn't debate her on how to bake a {{chocolate}} cake." [...] Franchot campaigned strongly as the [...] "only real Democrat in the race." [...] On September 5, 2006, Schaefer told Washington Post columnist Marc Fisher that Janet Owens is a [...] "prissy little miss" [...] who wears [...] "long dresses, looks like Mother Hubbardit's sort of like she was a man." [...] He made additional comments that she was [...] "getting fat." [...] Later, in an on-air interview with reporter Tyler Evans of local news station News Channel 8, he further commented: [...] "She's got these long clothes on and an old-fashioned hairdo. [...] You know it sort of makes you real mad." [...] On September 8, 2006, another local news station, WUSA9, showed an off-screen reporter asking him, [...] "Did you call her an Old Mother Hubbard?" [...] to which he responded, [...] "Well, what does she look like? ... Old-fashioned hairdo; long dress ... <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>lose</b> or win – whatever I do – I'm gonna send her some Style magazines." [...] His campaign called a press conference, but he failed to show. [...] Owens commented that perhaps Schaefer had become too old to run, saying that running against him was like a granddaughter [...] "taking the keys away from grandpa." [...] In response, Schaefer and his campaign hinted that Owens was lashing out at him in an act of age discrimination. [...] One viewer wrote in, suggesting that perhaps Schaefer was showing signs of dementia. [...] The anchor responded that the caller had pointed out [...] "the elephant in the room" [...] that, until then, the media was hesitant to suggest. Schaefer refused to apologize for his comments regarding Owens' appearance, saying, [...] "An apology? An apology for what? I can't help it how she looks." [...] Asked about his heated exchanges with Owens, Schaefer said, [...] "This was started not by me." [...] He added, [...] "There's dirty politics, and then there's filthy politics." ...|$|E
