5|$|The {{character}} of <b>Humpty</b> <b>Dumpty</b> was popularised in the United States by actor George L. Fox (1825–77). As a character and literary allusion, he has appeared or {{been referred to}} in {{a large number of}} works of literature and popular culture, particularly Lewis Carroll's Through the Looking-Glass (1872), in which he was described as an egg. The rhyme is listed in the Roud Folk Song Index as No. 13026.|$|E
5|$|<b>Humpty</b> <b>Dumpty</b> is a {{character}} in an English nursery rhyme, probably originally a riddle {{and one of the}} best known in the English-speaking world. He is typically portrayed as a personified egg, though he is not explicitly described as such. The first recorded versions of the rhyme date from late eighteenth-century England and the tune from 1870 in James William Elliott's National Nursery Rhymes and Nursery Songs. Its origins are obscure and several theories have been advanced to suggest original meanings.|$|E
25|$|In 1867, {{he created}} his masterpiece, <b>Humpty</b> <b>Dumpty,</b> giving over 1,000 {{performances}} on Broadway. His character in this production was a distinctive American anti-hero and helped <b>Humpty</b> <b>Dumpty</b> {{become the most}} popular pantomime productions of the time.|$|E

50|$|Between 1902 and 1904, twenty-nine were rebuilt {{with new}} boilers with Belpaire fireboxes. With their small tenders, and a dome well-forward {{on the first}} ring, they looked front-heavy, and gained the {{nickname}} <b>Humpty</b> <b>Dumpties.</b> In fact they were so front heavy that they were never considered for superheating. They were withdrawn between 1913 and 1920.|$|R
50|$|Ironically, Gardner had {{problems}} learning calculus and never took a mathematics course after high school. While editing <b>Humpty</b> <b>Dumpty's</b> Magazine he constructed many paper folding puzzles, and {{this led to}} {{his interest in the}} flexagons invented by British mathematician Arthur H Stone. The subsequent article he wrote on hexaflexagons led directly to the column.|$|R

5000|$|Other {{nonsense}} verse {{makes use}} of nonsense words—words without a clear meaning or any meaning at all. Lewis Carroll and Edward Lear both made good use {{of this type of}} nonsense in some of their verse. These poems are well formed in terms of grammar and syntax, and each nonsense word is of a clear part of speech. The first verse of Lewis Carroll's Jabberwocky illustrates this nonsense technique, despite <b>Humpty</b> <b>Dumpty's</b> later explanation of some of the unclear words within it: ...|$|R
30|$|Much alarmist {{commentary}} on the web reflects a mindset occupied with <b>Humpty</b> <b>Dumpty’s</b> question, “Which is to be master?” One of the most authoritative pronouncements on the subject (Hawking et al. [2014]) warns, “Whereas the short-term impact of AI depends on who controls it, the long-term impact depends on whether it can be controlled at all.” If we adopt a systems view, however, the design task is not to ensure the continuance of human control or to find a safe niche for human talent. It is to facilitate human-machine collaboration.|$|R
25|$|A {{shopping}} cart is a metal or plastic basket on wheels supplied by a shop, especially a supermarket, {{for use by}} customers inside the shop for transport of merchandise to the check-out counter during shopping. Often, customers are allowed to leave the carts in the parking lot, and store personnel return the carts to the shop. The first {{shopping cart}} was invented by Sylvan Goldman in 1937, owner of the <b>Humpty</b> <b>Dumpty</b> supermarket chain in Oklahoma City.|$|E
25|$|The plot had young Humpty and his playmates {{turn into}} harlequinade {{characters}} and romp through a candy store, an enchanted garden and Manhattan's costly new City Hall. Fox's mute passivity set {{him apart from}} the raucous clamor surrounding him, and audiences took the little man to their hearts. <b>Humpty</b> <b>Dumpty</b> was revived several times. Fox eventually gave 1,128 performances in the title role, becoming the most highly paid actor of his time. He initiated the tradition of Wednesday matinee's {{to take advantage of}} the show's appeal to children.|$|E
25|$|The slapstick form {{known as}} {{pantomime}} {{had been a}} Broadway staple since before the Civil War, but it reached a peak of popularity during the 1860s and 70's. These shows placed figures from Mother Goose stories in wildly varied settings, always finding an excuse to transform them into the clown characters of traditional commedia dell'arte (Harlequin, Columbina, etc.). Popular songs were loosely inserted whenever the audience needed a breather. Lavish sets and athletic clowning were expected, along with elaborate ballets. By far {{the most popular of}} these pantomimes was Fox's <b>Humpty</b> <b>Dumpty.</b>|$|E
50|$|Storybook Land is a {{park with}} attractions from several {{different}} children's storybooks. The park contains a castle, {{as well as}} a train that takes visitors through the park. There are two barns which contain petting zoos. <b>Humpty</b> <b>Dumpty's</b> Great Fall Roller Coaster was added to the park, summer 2015. Newly added is the Land of Oz, that features characters and attractions from L. Frank Baum's The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. Baum was a resident of Aberdeen in the 1880s, but left after the failure of the newspaper The Aberdeen Saturday Pioneer, where he wrote a column, Our Landlady.|$|R

50|$|A {{few days}} later Jack and Mary team up with Superintendent Baker, Ashley (an alien who can only speak binary code) and {{forensic}} scientist Gretel Kandlestyck-Maeker. <b>Humpty</b> <b>Dumpty's</b> wife is found to have committed suicide at the biscuit factory, but it is suspected {{that she has been}} murdered. The woman had jumped into a chocolate vat and was sliced by the machines, but when the employees stopped the machine, it was too late. The police of the Nursery Crime Division find a suicide note, but Mary concludes that it was written by his wife by comparing it to her diary. The proof of suicide also comes from a witnessing employee who saw her jump in, and no one pushed her.|$|R
