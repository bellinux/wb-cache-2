40|$|Clinical {{guidelines}} are important tools for managing health care quality. Research on {{the origins of}} guidelines primarily focuses on the institutional causes of their emergence and growth. <b>Individual</b> medical <b>researchers,</b> however, have played important roles. This paper develops knowledge of the role of <b>individual</b> medical <b>researchers</b> in advancing guidelines, and of how researchers' efforts were enabled or constrained by broader institutional changes. Drawing on an analytical case study focused on the role of Kerr White, John Wennberg, and Robert Brook, it shows that guidelines were a product of the interplay between institutional change in the medical field and actions by <b>individual</b> <b>researchers,</b> acting as institutional entrepreneurs. Increased government involvement in the health care field triggered the involvement of a range of new actors in health care. These new organizations created a context that allowed <b>individual</b> <b>researchers</b> to advance guidelines by creating job opportunities, providing research funding, and creating opportunities for researchers to engage with the policy process. <b>Individual</b> <b>researchers</b> availed of this context to both advance their ideas, and to draw new actors into the field...|$|R

40|$|Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) {{provides}} a framework for judging the ethical qualities of innovation processes, however guidance for researchers on how to implement such practices is limited. Exploring RRI {{in the context of}} nanotechnology, this paper examines how the dispersed and interdisciplinary nature of the nanotechnology field somewhat hampers the abilities of <b>individual</b> <b>researchers</b> to control the innovation process. The ad-hoc nature of the field of nanotechnology, with its fluid boundaries and elusive membership, has thus far failed to establish a strong collective agent, such as a professional organization, through which researchers could collectively steer technological development in light of social and environmental needs. In this case, <b>individual</b> <b>researchers</b> cannot innovate responsibly purely by themselves, but there is also no structural framework to ensure that responsible development of nanotechnologies takes place. We argue that, in such a case, <b>individual</b> <b>researchers</b> have a duty to collectivize. In short, researchers in situations where it is challenging for individual agents to achieve the goals of RRI are compelled to develop organizations to facilitate RRI. In this paper we establish and discuss the criteria under which <b>individual</b> <b>researchers</b> have this duty to collectivize.

50|$|Wundt demands co-ordinated {{analysis}} of causal and teleological aspects; {{he called for}} a methodologically versatile psychology and did not demand that any decision be made between experimental-statistical methods and interpretative methods (qualitative methods). Whenever appropriate, he referred to findings from interpretation and experimental research within a multimethod approach. Thus, for example, the chapters on the development of language or on enlargement of fantasy activity in cultural psychology also contain experimental, statistical and psychophysiological findings. He was very familiar with these methods and used them in extended research projects. This was without precedent and has, since then, rarely been achieved by another <b>individual</b> <b>researcher.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{number and}} {{distribution}} of phonemes in English vary from dialect to dialect, and also depend on {{the interpretation of the}} <b>individual</b> <b>researcher.</b> The number of consonant phonemes is generally put at 24 (or slightly more). The number of vowels is subject to greater variation; in the system presented on this page there are 20 vowel phonemes in Received Pronunciation, 14-16 in General American and 20-21 in Australian English (CITE). The pronunciation keys used in dictionaries generally contain a slightly greater number of symbols than this, to take account of certain sounds used in foreign words and certain noticeable distinctions that may not be—strictly speaking—phonemic.|$|E
50|$|When under hypnosis, an {{individual}} {{will attempt to}} fill in gaps in their memory with any information, including fantasies. The information used to fill gaps can come from the hypnotist and the individual under hypnosis.

Skeptics Robert Sheaffer and Phillip J. Klass say individual abduction researchers appear to exert influence on the characteristics of narratives retrieved during hypnotic recall.

5000|$|Premature {{publicity}} violates {{a cultural}} value {{of most of}} the scientific community, which is that findings should be subjected to independent review with a [...] "thorough examination by the scientific community" [...] before they are widely publicized.
