A cooling pump {{integrated}} into the gearboxes assures safe operation on one engine by pumping oil through the <b>idle</b> gearbox.

500|$|The world's oldest {{illustrated}} {{depiction of}} an endless power-transmitting chain drive is from Su Song's horological treatise. It {{was used in}} the clockworks for coupling the main drive shaft to the armillary sphere gearbox (rotating three small pinions), as seen in Needham's Fig. 410 and Fig. 652. This belonged to the uppermost end of the main vertical transmission shaft, incorporating right angle gears and oblique gears connected by a short <b>idling</b> <b>shaft.</b> The toothed ring gear called the diurnal motion gear ring [...] was fit around the shell of the armillary sphere along the declination parallel near the southern pole. Although the ancient Greek Philo of Byzantium (3rd century BC) featured a sort of endless belt for his magazine arcuballista, which did not transmit continuous power, the influential source for Su Song's chain drive is most likely the continuously-driven chain pump known in China since the Han Dynasty (202 BC–220 AD). From his horological treatise, Su Song states: ...|$|R
5000|$|The John Pearson Soda Works {{structure}} {{was built in}} several stages: The previous building on the site burned down in a devastating fire that affected most of Placerville in the 1850s. Scottish immigrant John McFarland Pearson built the lower portion of the building in 1859 as a commercial ice house. [...] He chose to build {{in front of an}} <b>idle</b> mine <b>shaft</b> so he could use the underground rooms and tunnels to store ice at controlled temperatures. [...] In addition, the walls of this section were made 22 in thick to keep the ice cool in the storefront. Pearson later expanded into soda water; his sons added the brick second story in 1897 to house the bottling operation. They added a water-driven elevator to transport the product from each level. [...] The store also sold other groceries such as eggs and beer.|$|R
60|$|And, as if {{to prove}} that this was indeed the builder's intention, and that he did not leave his <b>shafts</b> <b>idle</b> merely because {{he did not know how}} to set them to work safely, there are two pieces of masonry at the {{extremities}} of the façade, which are just as remarkable for their frank trust in the bearing power of the shafts as the rest are for their want of confidence in them. But, before we come to these, we must say a word or two respecting the second point named above, the superior position of the shafts.|$|R
60|$|It was a sunny morn: {{upon the}} green {{contiguous}} to the Auberge of St. Nicholas {{was a house}} upon wheels, a sort of monster omnibus, its huge <b>shafts</b> <b>idle</b> on the ground, while three fat Flemish horses cropped the surrounding pasture. From {{the door of the}} house were some temporary steps, like an accommodation ladder, on which sat Baroni, dressed something like a Neapolitan fisherman, and mending his clarionet; the man in the blouse was eating his dinner, seated between the shafts, to which also was fastened the little dog, often the only garrison, except the grandmother, of this strange establishment.|$|R
50|$|Despite {{emerging}} {{sources for}} imported ore, Pyne {{was one of}} the most productive ore mines in the Birmingham District, removing as much as 1 million tons of ore per year. Innovative mining methods, custom-designed equipment and an efficient surface layout kept the facility competitive. The ore was originally loaded onto trains on the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad for delivery to area iron and steel furnaces, but later was trucked to Woodward No. 3 Mine for loading. When the mine reached a thrust fault which would have required enormous efforts to overcome, the decision was made to cease operations. The pumps which kept the shaft from flooding were <b>idled</b> and the <b>shaft</b> itself was capped off.|$|R
2500|$|The {{power plant}} {{consisted}} of Scotch marine boilers providing steam at 150 psi (10.34 bar) to Parsons turbines. [...] Steam first drove a high-pressure turbine, which turned a propeller shaft with a 57inch (1,448mm) screw {{at up to}} 700 revolutions per minute. [...] Exhaust steam from the centre turbine drove two low-pressure turbines, one on either side, turning wing shafts each with two 40inch (1,016mm) screws, at up to 1,000 rpm. [...] (In 1905, the fore propellers {{were removed from the}} outboard shafts, which actually improved performance.) [...] The drives were ungeared, and the speeds of the turbines were the speeds of the [...] shafts. [...] After final use in the lower-pressure outboard turbines, the steam, now expanded 125-fold, exhausted into condensers. Astern turbines operated on the two wing shafts, with the central <b>shaft</b> <b>idling</b> when the ship was backing. The aim was for a speed of 20 knots (37km/h), outpacing other Clyde steamers while providing economy in fuel, rather than the high speeds of the navy vessels. The propulsion system differed from that of the lightly built destroyers, which operated under higher steam pressure and drove four propeller shafts. Denny gave the new ship the yard number 651.|$|R

No real engagement {{as they were in}} International Waters. It was very eerie. December 1972 many crew members transferred January 1973 Peace Treaty signed with North Vietnam.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{a theoretical}} phase-control design strategy for idle shake affected by {{an arrangement of}} a powerplant on transversely mounted Front engine Front Wheel Drive (FWD) passenger cars. There {{are two types of}} powerplant arrangement for FWD cars heading up to the North in the top view. One of them is a typical “east-west arrangement” which allows the “front” of the engine to be placed to the right or “east”, and the “rear” of the engine that is to mate to the transmission to be placed to the left or “west” (Fig. 1). Another one is “west-east arrangement”, where the engine is positioned to “west”, and the transmission is positioned to “east” (FIG. 2). In general, a dynamic damper like a radiator supported by a rubber bush built in {{the front end of the}} engine compartment is widely believed to reduce a gain of FRF (Frequency Response Function) at resonant frequency. In addition to that, it becomes clear in this paper that the dynamic damper has an additional phase-shift effect between the two FRFs. That is to say, the two vector responses of the body vibration caused by the two excitation forces, which are the roll moment and the vertical force of the engine, cancel each other and the resultant vector becomes so small. In this manner, the powerplant arrangement affects idle shake deeply correlating with the phase-control design. A combination of the East-West arrangement and a 2 nd order balancer-less engine is the best design for idle shake of the 2 nd order harmonics. On the contrary, a combination of the West-East arrangement and a balancer-less engine is the worst design. If the engine is equipped with 2 nd order balance <b>shafts,</b> <b>idle</b> shake is estimated to be middle between them, regardless of the powerplat arrangement...|$|R
