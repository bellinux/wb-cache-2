When appropriate, G-actin monomers polymerize to form F (filamentous) actin, which, together with other proteins that bind to actin, comprise cellular microfilaments.

50|$|Actin {{remains one}} of the most {{abundant}} proteins in all of Eukarya and is an enzyme (ATPase) that gradually hydrolyzes ATP. It exists in two forms within eukaryotic cells: globular or G-actin and filament/filamentous or F-actin. <b>Globular</b> <b>actin</b> is the monomeric form of the protein while the filamentous actin is a linear polymer of globular subunits. The assembly of filamentous actin arises as a result of weak, noncovalent interactions between G-actin and appears in the arrangement of a two-stranded asymmetrical helical polymer.|$|E
50|$|Exposure to TcdA {{leads to}} {{immediate}} changes in cell morphology, including loss of structural integrity {{due to a}} decrease in filamentous actin (F-actin), {{and an increase in}} <b>globular</b> <b>actin.</b> Disorganization of actin filaments and the cytoskeleton leads to increased permeability of tight junctions resulting in severe epithelial cell damage and fluid secretion. Fluid accumulation and secretion are secondary to mucosal damage that occurs after exposure to TcdA. Distinct changes in the microfilament system lead to cell rounding and cell death. These changes result from the inactivation of Rho proteins, which {{play an important role in}} regulating tight junctions.|$|E
50|$|Thin filaments, 7 nm in diameter, consist {{primarily}} of the protein actin, specifically fibrous (F) actin. Each F actin strand {{is composed of}} a string of subunits called <b>globular</b> (G) <b>actin.</b> Each G actin has an active site that can bind to the head of a myosin molecule. Each thin filament also has approximately 40 to 60 molecules of tropomyosin, the protein that blocks the active sites of the thin filaments when the muscle is relaxed. Each tropomyosin molecule has a smaller calcium-binding protein called troponin bound to it. All thin filaments are attached to the Z-line.|$|R
50|$|All CAPs {{appear to}} contain a C-terminal actin-binding domain that regulates actin remodelling in {{response}} to cellular signals and is required for normal cellular morphology, cell division, growth and locomotion in eukaryotes. CAP directly regulates actin filament dynamics and has been implicated {{in a number of}} complex developmental and morphological processes, including mRNA localisation and the establishment of cell polarity. Actin exists both as <b>globular</b> (G) (monomeric) <b>actin</b> subunits and assembled into filamentous (F) actin. In cells, actin cycles between these two forms. Proteins that bind F-actin often regulate F-actin assembly and its interaction with other proteins, while proteins that interact with G-actin often control the availability of unpolymerised actin. CAPs bind G-actin.|$|R
40|$|Melanophilin (Mlph) regulates {{retention}} of melanosomes at the peripheral actin cytoskeleton of melanocytes, a process essential for normal mammalian pigmentation. Mlph is proposed to be a modular protein binding the melanosome-associated protein Rab 27 a, Myosin Va (MyoVa), actin, and microtubule end-binding protein (EB 1), via distinct N-terminal Rab 27 a-binding domain (R 27 BD), medial MyoVa-binding domain (MBD), and C-terminal actin-binding domain (ABD), respectively. We developed a novel melanosome transport assay using a Mlph-null cell line to study {{formation of the}} active Rab 27 a:Mlph:MyoVa complex. Recruitment of MyoVa to melanosomes correlated with rescue of melanosome transport and required intact R 27 BD together with MBD exon F–binding region (EFBD) and unexpectedly a potential coiled-coil forming sequence within ABD. In vitro binding studies indicate that the coiled-coil region enhances binding of MyoVa by Mlph MBD. Other regions of Mlph reported to interact with MyoVa <b>globular</b> tail, <b>actin,</b> or EB 1 are not essential for melanosome transport rescue. The strict correlation between melanosomal MyoVa recruitment and rescue of melanosome distribution suggests that stable interaction with Mlph and MyoVa activation are nondissociable events. Our results highlight {{the importance of the}} coiled-coil region together with R 27 BD and EFBD regions of Mlph {{in the formation of the}} active melanosomal Rab 27 a-Mlph-MyoVa complex...|$|R
50|$|Measuring {{approximately}} 6 nm in diameter, microfilaments are {{the thinnest}} fibers of the cytoskeleton. They are polymers of actin subunits (<b>globular</b> <b>actin,</b> or G-actin), which {{as part of}} the fiber are referred to as filamentous actin, or F-actin. Each microfilament is made up of two helical, interlaced strands of subunits. Much like microtubules, actin filaments are polarized. Electron micrographs have provided evidence of their fast-growing barbed-ends and their slow-growing pointed-end. This polarity has been determined by the pattern created by the binding of myosin S1 fragments: they themselves are subunits of the larger myosin II protein complex. The pointed end is commonly referred to as the minus (&minus;) end and the barbed end {{is referred to as the}} plus (+) end.|$|E
50|$|Cardiac alpha actin is a 42.0 kDa protein {{composed}} of 377 amino acids. Cardiac alpha actin is a filamentous protein extending from a complex mesh with cardiac alpha-actinin (ACTN2) at Z-lines towards {{the center of}} the sarcomere. Polymerization of <b>globular</b> <b>actin</b> (G-actin) leads to a structural filament (F-actin) {{in the form of a}} two-stranded helix. Each actin can bind to four others. The atomic structure of monomeric actin was solved by Kabsch et al., and closely thereafter this same group published the structure of the actin filament. Actins are highly conserved proteins; the alpha actins are found in muscle tissues and are a major constituent of the contractile apparatus. Cardiac (ACTC1) and skeletal (ACTA1) alpha actins differ by only four amino acids (Asp4Glu, Glu5Asp, Leu301Met, Ser360Thr; cardiac/skeletal). The actin monomer has two asymmetric domains; the larger inner domain comprised by sub-domains 3 and 4, and the smaller outer domain by sub-domains 1 and 2. Both the amino and carboxy-termini lie in sub-domain 1 of the outer domain.|$|E

In vitro, these are the only plasma proteins that display a high affinity for actin. We infused increasing amounts of <b>globular</b> <b>actin</b> intravenously to rats to evaluate its disposition in plasma and tissues. Intravascular filament formation, microthrombi, and endothelial injury were observed, especially in the pulmonary circulation. These pathological changes were not observed when the <b>globular</b> <b>actin</b> in the infusate had been preincubated with the vitamin D-binding protein in vitro.

40|$|AbstractCortexillins I and II of D. discoideum {{constitute}} a novel subfamily of proteins with actin-binding {{sites of the}} α-actinin/spectrin type. The C-terminal halves of these dimeric proteins contain a heptad repeat domain by which the two subunits are joined to form a two-stranded, parallel coiled coil, giving rise to a 19 nm tail. The N-terminal domains that encompass a consensus actin-binding sequence are folded into <b>globular</b> heads. Cortexillin-linked <b>actin</b> filaments form preferentially anti-parallel bundles that associate into meshworks. Both cortexillins are enriched in the cortex of locomoting cells, primarily at the anterior and posterior ends.

40|$|Apicomplexan parasites, {{such as the}} malaria-causing Plasmodium, utilize an actin-based motor for {{motility}} {{and host}} cell invasion. The actin filaments of these parasites are unusually short, and actin polymerization is under strict control of a small set of regulatory proteins, which are poorly conserved with their mammalian orthologs. Actin depolymerization factors (ADFs) {{are among the most}} important actin regulators, affecting the rates of filament turnover in a multifaceted manner. Plasmodium has two ADFs that display low sequence homology {{with each other and with}} the higher eukaryotic family members. Here, we show that ADF 2, like canonical ADF proteins but unlike ADF 1, binds to both <b>globular</b> and filamentous <b>actin,</b> severing filaments and inducing nucleotide exchange on the actin monomer. The crystal structure of Plasmodium ADF 1 shows major differences from the ADF consensus, explaining the lack of F-actin binding.

40|$|Palladin is {{a widely}} {{expressed}} actin-associated protein localized at stress fibers, focal adhesions, and other actin-based structures, playing {{a significant role in}} cell adhesion and cell motility. Knockout of Palladin in mice is embryonic lethal, demonstrating the importance of Palladin in development yet its role in the vasculature is not known. In the present study, smooth muscle cell (SMC) markers, such as myosin, actin, caldesmon, calponin, and LPP, were down-regulated in embryoid bodies (EBs) derived from embryonic stem cells lacking Palladin. Transgenic embryonic stem cell lines were generated that stably expressed a puromycin-resistance gene under the control of a SM α-actin (SMA) promoter. Negative selection was then used to purify SMCs from EBs. Purified SMCs expressing multiple SMC markers were designated APSCs (SMA-puromycin-selected cells). Palladin null APSCs express significantly less myosin, actin, calponin, and h-caldesmon. The filamentous (F) to <b>globular</b> (G) <b>actin</b> ratio, known to regulate myocardin family transcription factors, was also decreased. Palladin null APSCs showed increased cell adhesion and decreased cell motility. Importantly, Palladin null APSCs within collagen gels generated less maximum contractile force when stimulated with endothelin- 1, sphingosine 1 -phosphate (S 1 P), and thrombin. Myosin light chains (MLC 20) were phosphorylated by lysophosphatidic acid to the same extent in Palladin null and wild type APSCs but myosin content/total protein was reduced by > 50 %, consistent with the observed decreases in contractility. All together, these results suggest that Palladin is essential for expression of the full complement of contractile proteins necessary for optimal force development of SMCs derived from EBs...|$|R

40|$|Actins {{isolated}} from embryonic chick brain and muscle differ in mobility when subjected to electrophoresis in gels containing urea and sodium dodecyl sulfate. Experiments {{were carried out}} to determine whether these actins are products of different structural genes and differ in primary amino acid sequence, or whether they are products of the same structural gene but are different because of post-translational modification. Messenger RNA from brain and muscle tissue was used to direct cell-free protein synthesis in wheat germ extracts. The synthesized actins were identified by conversion from <b>globular</b> to fibrous <b>actin</b> and by two-dimensional chromatographic analysis of tryptic peptides. The differences in electrophoretic mobility of brain compared to muscle actin were maintained in the cell-free protein synthetic products. Therefore, these mobility differences were not due to post-translational modification. It was concluded that brain and muscle actin are coded by different messenger RNAs and therefore arise from different structural genes. In addition, messenger RNA from 13 - and 16 -day embryonic thigh muscle directed the synthesis of both brain- and muscle-type actins, suggesting that muscle cell differentiation involves the regulation {{of at least two}} different actin genes...|$|R
40|$|We {{have used}} N,N'- 1, 4 -phenylenebismaleimide, a bifunctional {{sulfhydryl}} cross-linking reagent, {{to probe the}} oligomeric state of actin {{during the early stages}} of its polymerization into filaments. We document that one of the first steps in the polymerization of <b>globular</b> monomeric <b>actin</b> (G-actin) under a wide variety of ionic conditions is the dimerization of a significant fraction of the G-actin monomer pool. As polymerization proceeds, the yield of this initial dimer ("lower" dimer with an apparent molecular mass of 86 kD by SDS-PAGE [LD]) is attenuated, while an actin filament dimer ("upper" dimer with an apparent molecular mass of 115 kD by SDS-PAGE [UD] as characterized [Elzinga, M., and J. J. Phelan. 1984. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 81 : 6599 - 6602]) is formed. This shift from LD to UD occurs concomitant with formation of filaments as assayed by N-(1 -pyrenyl) iodoacetamide fluorescence enhancement and electron microscopy. Isolated cross-linked LD does not form filaments, while isolated cross-linked UD will assemble into filaments indistinguishable from those polymerized from unmodified G-actin under typical filament-forming conditions. The presence of cross-linked LD does not effect the kinetics of polymerization of actin monomer, whereas cross-linked UD shortens the "lag phase" of the polymerization reaction in a concentration-dependent fashion. Several converging lines of evidence suggest that, although accounting for a significant oligomeric species formed during early polymerization, the LD is incompatible with the helical symmetry defining the mature actin filament; however, it could represent the interfilament dimer found in paracrystalline arrays or filament bundles. Furthermore, the LD is compatible with the unit cell structure and symmetry common to various types of crystalline actin arrays (Aebi, U., W. E. Fowler, G. Isenberg, T. D. Pollard, and P. R.

It has been suggested that actin remodeling may also play an important functional role in nonmigrating, nonproliferating differentiated vascular smooth muscle (dVSM). In the present study, we show that contractile agonists increase the net polymerization of actin in dVSM, as measured by the differential ultracentrifugation of vascular smooth muscle tissue and the costaining of single freshly dissociated cells with fluorescent probes specific for <b>globular</b> and filamentous <b>actin.</b> Furthermore, induced alterations of the actin polymerization state, as well as actin decoy peptides, inhibit contractility in a stimulus-dependent manner.

The incorporation of isoform-specific cell-permeant synthetic actin decoy peptides, as well as isoform-specific probing of cell fractions and two-dimensional gels, demonstrates that actin remodeling during α-agonist contractions involves the remodeling of primarily γ-actin and, to a lesser extent, β-actin.

The actin {{scaffold}} protein palladin regulates both normal cell migration and invasive cell motility, processes that require the co-ordinated regulation of actin dynamics. However, the potential effect of palladin on actin dynamics has remained elusive. In the present study, we show that the actin-binding immunoglobulin-like domain of palladin, which is directly responsible for both actin binding and bundling, also stimulates actin polymerization in vitro. Palladin eliminated the lag phase that is characteristic of the slow nucleation step of actin polymerization. Furthermore, palladin dramatically reduced depolymerization, slightly enhanced the elongation rate, and did not alter the critical concentration. Microscopy and in vitro crosslinking assays reveal differences in actin bundle architecture when palladin is incubated with actin before or after polymerization.

We aimed to further explore Pyk 2 regulation of the actin dynamic during cell spreading as a vital characteristic of GMC function. GMC were infected with adenovirus encoding CRNK or green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a control and 48 hours after infection cells were harvested and either re-plated or left in suspension for one hour. De novo adhesion to substrate was significantly decreased after Pyk 2 activity inhibition and was further diminished after treatment with Rho-associated kinase inhibitor. Inhibition of Pyk 2 was associated with increased filamentous actin formation and a corresponding decrease in <b>globular</b> to filamentous <b>actin</b> ratio during cell spreading.

The lamellipodial actin cytoskeleton was composed of two distinct subpopulations: a population of 40 - 100 -nm-wide filament bundles radiated from the leading edge, and a second population of branching short filaments filled the volume between the dorsal and ventral membrane surfaces. Together, the two populations formed the three- dimensional structural network seen within expanding lamellipodia. Interaction of the actin filaments with the ventral membrane surface occurred {{along the length of}} the filaments via membrane associated proteins. The long bundled filament population was primarily involved in these interactions. The filament tips of either population appeared to interact with the membrane only at the leading edge; this interaction was mediated by a <b>globular</b> Triton-insoluble material. <b>Actin</b> filament polarity was determined by decoration with myosin S 1 or heavy meromyosin. Previous reports have suggested that the polarity of the actin filaments in motile cells is uniform, with the barbed ends toward the leading edge. We observed that the actin filament polarity within growth cone lamellipodia is not uniform; although the predominant orientation was with the barbed end toward the leading edge (47 - 56 %), 22 - 25 % of the filaments had the opposite orientation with their pointed ends toward the leading edge, and 19 - 31 % ran parallel to the leading edge. The two actin filament populations display distinct polarity profiles: the longer filaments appear to be oriented predominantly with their barbed ends toward the leading edge, whereas the short filaments appear to be randomly oriented. The different length, {{organization and}} polarity of the two filament populations suggest that they differ in stability and function. The population of bundled long filaments, which appeared to be more ventrally located and in contact with membrane proteins, may be more stable than the population of short branched filaments.

To begin the characterization of each rac protein function, racA and racD was fully cloned using inverse PCR and 3 ′-RACE. Surprisingly, the predicted amino acid sequence of racA is three times bigger than other rac genes. Unusual Ser and Thr stretches are found at similar location of racA and racD. Moreover, both racA and racD do not carry a conserved CAAX box at the C-terminus that is critical for the lipid modification. Further characterization of these two novel rac proteins will be pursued. ^ Function of racB and racC was studied by generating mutant cell lines conditionally overexpressing wild type (WT-) and constitutively activated (CA-) version of racB and racC. Cells expressing WT-racB had a flattened shape and some of CA-racB expressing cells were also flat with ruffling edges. However, majority of CA-racB cells detached and formed numerous actin-containing protrusions. It is likely that racB induced actin polymerization {{to increase the number of}} the protrusions which resulted in detachment of cells due to the lipid tension. On the other hand, cells overexpressing WT-racC formed spherical actin containing structures called petalopods, and increased phagocytosis by three fold. CA-racC expression led to an irregular cortex shape and enlarged contractile vacuole structure. Therefore, racC seems to regulate <b>globular</b> polymerization of <b>actin</b> cortex leading to the shape changes. ^ To examine the localization of rac proteins, GFP-fusion of racC and rac 1 B was expressed in Dictyostelium cells. Increase in GFP-rac 1 B signal was found at the macropinocytic cups and phagocytic cups, which was accompanied by actin polymerization On the other hand, GFP-racC was evenly distributed in the plasma membrane and the cytoplasm without significant changes in fluorescence intensity during macropinocytosis or phagocytosis. ^ In summary, racB, racC and rac 1 B have a different localization and function to control actin cytoskeleton. racA and racD are distinguished from other rac proteins by their unique genetic structures. Thus, rac proteins so far tested seem to have a unique function controlling actin cytoskeleton in Dictyostelium. ...|$|R
40|$|Understanding the {{connection}} between mechanics and cell structure requires {{the exploration of the}} key molecular constituents responsible for cell shape and motility. One of these molecular bridges is the cytoskeleton, which is involved with intracellular organization and mechanotransduction. In order to examine the structure in cells, we have developed a computational technique that is able to probe the self-assembly of actin filaments through a lattice based Monte Carlo method. We have modeled the polymerization of these filaments based upon the interactions of <b>globular</b> <b>actin</b> through a probabilistic model encompassing both inert and active proteins. The results show similar response to classic ordinary differential equations at low molecular concentrations, but a bi-phasic divergence at realistic concentrations for living mammalian cells. Further, by introducing localized mobility parameters, we are able to simulate molecular gradients that are observed in nonhomogeneous protein distributions in vivo. The method and results have potential applications in cell and molecular biology as well as self-assembly for organic and inorganic systems...|$|E
40|$|There {{are many}} {{pathogenic}} Clostridium species with diverse virulence factors that include protein toxins. Some of these bacteria, such as C. botulinum, C. difficile, C. perfringens and C. spiroforme, cause enteric problems in animals {{as well as}} humans. These often fatal diseases can partly be attributed to binary protein toxins that follow a classic AB paradigm. Within a targeted cell, all clostridial binary toxins destroy filamentous actin via mono-ADP-ribosylation of <b>globular</b> <b>actin</b> by the A component. However, much less is known about B component binding to cell-surface receptors. These toxins share sequence homology amongst themselves and with those produced by another Gram-positive, spore-forming bacterium also commonly associated with soil and disease: Bacillus anthracis. This review focuses upon the iota and C 2 families of clostridial binary toxins and includes: 1) basics of the bacterial source; 2) toxin biochemistry; 3) sophisticated cellular uptake machinery; and 4) host-cell responses following toxin-mediated disruption of the cytoskeleton. In summary, these protein toxins aid diverse enteric species within the genus Clostridium...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of the actin cytoskeleton on the shape and mechanical properties of cells has been revealed extensively using anti-actin drugs. However, {{due to the lack}} of the specificity of these compounds for different actin filament populations it has been difficult to delineate the exact role of the actin cytoskeleton in these cellular features. Actin binding proteins largely affect the organisation and dynamics of actin in cells; however, the impact of these proteins on the mechanical properties of cells is still unknown. Tropomyosins (Tpms) differentially regulate actin filament stability, function and organisation through their highly regulated expression and sorting to specific intracellular sites. Hence, Tpm isoforms can be used as tools to identify and manipulate functionally distinct actin filament populations in a cell. In this study we investigated the impact of Tpm-containing actin filaments on the organisation of the actin cytoskeleton and the mechanical properties of cells using rat neuroblastoma cells stably overexpressing different Tpm isoforms in comparison with control cells. The mechanical measurements conducted by AFM showed that Tpm 1. 12 -, Tpm 4. 2 - and Tpm 3. 1 -overexpressing cells were significantly stiffer than control cells. Measuring the total amount of Tpm expression in the Tpm-overexpressing cells demonstrated that there is no direct correlation between the modulus of Tpm-overexpressing cells and the total amount of Tpm expression. Biochemical evaluation of the filamentous to <b>globular</b> <b>actin</b> ratios demonstrated that the filamentous to <b>globular</b> <b>actin</b> ratio is higher in Tpm 3. 1 (M and H) cells than the controls. Also, computational analysis of the number of actin cables per cell revealed significant differences in the number of actin cables per cell relative to that seen in the control cells. The siRNA knockdown of Tpm 3. 1 in Tpm 3. 1 -overexpressing cells caused the elastic modulus to revert to that of control cells. In addition, the inhibition of non-muscle myosin II in stiffer cells led to the significantly softer cells. The results show that the overexpression of Tpm changes the properties of the actin cables in an isoform-specific manner that is not directly related to cell stiffness. This suggests that it is specific aspects of actin organisation which regulate the mechanical properties of the cel...|$|E
40|$|Alzheimer’s {{disease is}} a debilitating, {{progressive}} neurodegenerative disorder in the elderly, characterized by severe loss of memory and higher cognitive functions. In the hundred years since its discovery, Alzheimer’s disease (AD) has traversed from {{the status of a}} ‘rare neurological oddity’ to one of the greatest challenges faced by healthcare and medicine in this millennium. A reported 44 million people currently suffer from AD but only 1 in 4 people have been diagnosed. Although AD has been an area of intense research for almost 50 years now, most studies have focused on the end stage disease. Years of study on the pathological cause underlying AD; have conclusively shown that the accumulation of the sticky peptide, Aβ, {{is one of the major}} triggers of AD pathogenesis. However, after the initial Aβ trigger, multiple processes contribute to disease progression, so that by the time a patient is diagnosed on the basis of overt behavioral phenotypes, it is difficult to understand and differentiate between the causative mechanisms and the consequential effects of the disease. It is, perhaps, because of this, that we are still struggling to find therapies for AD which will stop or at the very least slow the course of the disease. In the 2015 report on AD, issued by the Alzheimer’s association, much emphasis has been placed on the early diagnosis of AD and the revision of the diagnostic criteria for AD. According to the new guidelines proposed in 2011, AD has been divided into three stages where the first stage occurs before the appearance of overt behavioral symptoms such as memory loss, whereas by the 1984 guidelines, cognitive disabilities must have already occurred for diagnoses of AD. This proposed preclinical stage of AD has been defined, reflecting the current belief that AD pathogenesis begins almost 20 years before the occurrence of behavioral dysfunction. However, no diagnostic criteria are currently available to establish this stage. Hence, there is a need to understand the early pathogenic mechanisms of AD, which will yield early therapeutic targets as well as early diagnostic markers of AD. One of the earliest documented events in AD pathogenesis is synaptic dysfunction, which is later manifested as loss of dendritic spines. Deficits in long term potentiation (LTP) has been demonstrated in Aβ exposed hippocampal slices as well as in mouse models of AD, much before the appearance of pathological hallmarks such as plaques and tangles as well as overt behavioral phenotypes. While these and other studies indicate clearly that elevated levels of soluble Aβ peptide leads to impairment of synaptic function, the underlying molecular mechanisms are yet to be elucidated. One of the purported mediators of Aβ induced dysfunction is oxidative stress. The Aβ peptide, especially the Aβ 42, is a self aggregating peptide with a propensity to form peptidyl radicals. Interaction of the peptidyl radicals with biomolecules leads to the generation of more free radical species via cascading chain reactions. Additionally, Aβ peptide has also been demonstrated to have synaptotoxic effects via its effect on NMDA receptors and calcium influx leading to deregulated reactive oxygen species (ROS) production as well as excitotoxicity. Hence, with a view to understanding Aβ mediated early synaptic dysfunction in AD, we studied early signaling changes in the synaptosomes derived from the cortex of APP/PS 1 mice model of AD at various ages. The APP/PS 1 model contains a mouse/human chimeric APP gene bearing the KM 670 / 671 NL Swedish mutation and the human PS 1 gene with an exon 9 deletion. These mice exhibit behavioral deficits from 7 months of age while plaque deposition and gliosis become apparent by 9 months of age. We chose to study both pre-symptomatic ages (1 and 3 months old) as well as post symptomatic (9 months old) mice. Post nuclear supernatant (PNS) as well as synaptosomes were isolated from the cortex of APP/PS 1 and age matched control mice. We assayed the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the PNS and the synaptosomes of post symptomatic 9 months old APP/PS 1 mice and age matched controls. In contrast to reports of enhanced oxidative stress markers in the brains of AD patients, we did not find any increase in the levels of ROS in the PNS of post symptomatic APP/PS 1 mice compared to age matched controls. However, synaptosomes from the cortex of these animals exhibited a significant increase in ROS levels in APP/PS 1 mice compared to controls. We further found that there was significant increase in the ROS levels in synaptosomes, but not PNS, of very young asymptomatic 1 and 3 months old APP/PS 1 mice. This is a first demonstration of synapse specific increase in oxidative stress in AD mice, as young as 1 month of age, indicating that disease specific mechanisms operate at the synapse much before the appearance of any overt cellular or behavioral symptoms. The increase in synaptic ROS levels correlated with a small but significant increase in the levels of Aβ 42 in the brains of APP/PS 1 mice compared to controls. We also found a concurrent change in the redox status of the cytoskeletal protein, actin, at the synapse. As early as 1 month of age, there was a significant decrease in the protein level of reduced actin indicating that there is an increase in the level of oxidized actin at the synapse. This loss of reduced actin was specific to the fibrillar pool of actin while no significant change was observed in the redox status of the monomeric <b>globular</b> pool of <b>actin.</b> Oxidation of actin has been demonstrated to lead to its depolymerization. Concurrently, we found a significant loss of fibrillar actin in the synaptosomes of APP/PS 1 mice. Actin is the major cytoskeletal protein at the synapse. Changes in the <b>globular</b> to fibrillar <b>actin</b> ratio at the synapse at early pre-symptomatic ages in APP/PS 1 mice will likely lead to structural and consequent functional changes at the synapse. This could potentially be one of the triggers of synaptic dysfunction in AD. Furthermore, changes in the Akt-mTOR signaling pathway was also observed in the synaptosomes of 1 month old APP/PS 1 mice, which is sustained at 9 months. There was a significant loss of the mTOR-pS 6 K- 4 EBP 1 axis in the synaptosomes, but not PNS, of APP/PS 1 mice. We found that loss of Akt signaling, as evinced by loss of Akt phosphorylation, Akt kinase activity as well as loss of phosphorylation of downstream effector GSK 3 β, potentially underlies the loss of mTOR signaling. Further, the loss of Akt signaling is mediated by synapse specific redox modification of Akt and consequent interaction with the protein phosphatase PP 2 a. Loss of the Akt-mTOR signaling at the synapse is indicative of deficits in local protein translation. Loss of this essential synaptic function, which plays critical roles in synapse maintenance as well as synaptic plasticity during learning and memory, at an early age, will have long ranging impact on synaptic function such as long term potentiation (LTP) in APP/PS 1 mice. Our study is the first demonstration of oxidative stress and consequent signaling changes which occur specifically at the synapse of very young 1 month old APP/PS 1 mice. These changes occur much before the appearance of overt phenotype such as plaque deposition and behavioral dysfunction but sustain till the appearance of classical pathological hallmarks. Hence, the study demonstrates that disease progression starts much before previously thought and provides us a critical time window during which therapeutic strategies designed to delay or stop these changes might change the course of AD...|$|R

It is a vital nutrient for plant physical design, such as cell wall and membrane, and {{also serves as a}} counter-cation for biochemical, inorganic, and organic anions, and more particularly, its concentration change in cytosol is a ubiquitous second messenger in plant physiological signaling in responses to developmental and environmental stimuli. Actin cytoskeleton is well known for its importance in cellular architecture maintenance and its significance in cytoplasmic streaming and cell division. In plant cell system, the actin dynamics is a process of polymerization and de-polymerization of <b>globular</b> <b>actin</b> and filamentous actin and that acts as an active regulator for calcium signaling by controlling calcium evoked physiological responses. The elucidation of the interaction between calcium and actin dynamics will be helpful for further investigation of plant cell signaling networks at molecular level.

40|$|EXAFS and XANES {{experiments}} {{were used to}} assess decavanadate interplay with actin, in both the globular and polymerized forms, under different conditions of pH, temperature, ionic strength, and presence of ATP. This approach allowed us to simultaneously probe, for the first time, all vanadium species present in the system. It was established that decavanadate interacts with G-actin, triggering a protein conformational reorientation that induces oxidation of the cysteine core residues and oxidovanadium (VIV) formation. The local environment of vanadium's absorbing center in the [decavanadate-protein] adducts was determined, a V-SCys coordination having been verified experimentally. The variations induced in decavanadate's EXAFS profile by the presence of actin were found to be almost totally reversed by the addition of ATP, which constitutes a solid proof of decavanadate interaction with the protein at its ATP binding site. Additionally, a weak decavanadate interplay with F-actin was suggested to take place, through a mechanism different from that inferred for <b>globular</b> <b>actin.</b> These findings have important consequences for the understanding, at a molecular level, of the significant biological activities of decavanadate and similar polyoxometalates, aiming at potential pharmacological applications...|$|E
