Spice Girls member Melanie C said [...] "Madonna {{was doing the}} girl power thing {{a long time before}} the Spice Girls... 'Express Yourself' is one of the routines that I know and I used to really like doing that one because it is where she shows her bra and holds her crotch." [...] In 2010, singer Christina Aguilera paid tribute to [...] "Express Yourself" [...] with the music video of her single, [...] "Not Myself Tonight". She commented [...] "One of my favorite videos ever is 'Express Yourself' by Madonna which came across as really strong and empowering which I always try to incorporate through my expression of sexuality... I love the direct reference I made to Madonna with the eye glass moment and the smoke and stairs. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>paying</b> tribute to a very strong woman who has paved the way before." [...] James Montgomery from MTV deemed [...] "Express Yourself" [...] as the primary influence of Aguilera's video with scenes like Aguilera displaying a monocle, standing atop a flight of stairs and crawling across the floor while pouring a black liquid over herself. Similarities were also noted between [...] "Express Yourself" [...] and singer Lady Gaga's 2011 single [...] "Born This Way" [...] both in subject matter and composition.|$|E
2500|$|......then we got married, {{lived in}} the unit (in Ramsgate) for a while, and had a baby. We {{moved to a new}} house {{a quarter of a mile}} away. It cost me heaps. I had a {{mortgage}} I couldn't possibly afford. I remember for over a year we had a gross income of $9,000 and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>paying</b> $4,500 on the mortgage. That was hard, very hard. We were really struggling.|$|E

Lorenzo Fertitta revealed to Fighter's Only magazine, recalling the lack of assets he acquired in the purchase. [...] "And I said 'What you don't understand is I'm getting the most valuable thing that I could possibly have, which is those three letters: UFC. That is what's {{going to make this}} thing work.

2500|$|The reporter's widely {{distributed}} story led to speculation that Lake was destitute. After the story ran, fans of Lake sent her money which she returned as [...] "a matter of pride". Lake vehemently denied {{that she was}} destitute and stated, [...] "It's as though people were making me out to be down-and-out. I wasn't. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>paying</b> $190 a month rent then, and that's {{a long way from}} being broke". The story did revive some interest in Lake and led to some television and stage appearances, most notably in the 1963 off-Broadway revival of the musical Best Foot Forward.|$|E
2500|$|He {{resigned}} from the advertising industry in 1964, moved into a modest apartment near the Queens-Midtown Tunnel ("It wasn’t Paris in the 1920s, but I was happy" [...] DeLillo has said of this time), and began work on his first novel. Reflecting on {{the early days of}} his writing career, he remarked: [...] "I lived in a very minimal kind of way. My telephone would be $4.20 every month. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>paying</b> a rent of sixty dollars a month. And I was becoming a writer. So in one sense, I was ignoring the movements of the time." [...] His first novel, Americana, was written over the course of four years and finally published in 1971, to modest critical praise. Americana concerned [...] "a television network programmer who hits the road in search of the big picture". DeLillo revised the novel in 1989 for paperback re-printing. Reflecting on the novel later in his career, he admitted, [...] "I don't think my first novel would have been published today as I submitted it. I don't think an editor would have read 50 pages of it. It was very overdone and shaggy, but two young editors saw something that seemed worth pursuing and eventually we all did some work on the book and it was published." [...] Later still, DeLillo still felt a degree of surprise at Americana being published, noting [...] "I was working on my first novel, Americana, for two years before I ever realized that I could be a writer [...] I had absolutely no assurance that this book would be published because I knew that there were elements that I simply didn't know how to improve at that point. So I wrote for another two years and finished the novel. It wasn’t all that difficult to find a publisher, to my astonishment. I didn't have a representative. I didn’t know anything about publishing. But an editor at Houghton Mifflin read the manuscript and decided that this was worth pursuing." ...|$|E

60|$|Engaged in {{conversation}} with Rupert Bailey, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>paying</b> little attention to this evidence of an awakening world, when suddenly I heard a hoarse, triumphant cry from Arthur Jukes, and, turned, I perceived his ball dropping neatly into the car's interior.

6000|$|I {{was pretty}} sure we would get that three hundred {{thousand}} dollars. Lee Rundle's was to be only one-third, because <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>paying</b> all the expenses.

60|$|Dr. Strafford still {{remained}} with me. Not many {{years out of}} the medical school, he had inspired me with a liking for him and a respect for his profession, and when he informed me one day that {{he could no longer}} conscientiously accept the sum <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>paying</b> him, I begged him to stay on. He was a big and wholesome young man, companionable, yet quiet and unobtrusive, watchful without appearing to be so, with the innate as well as the cultivated knowledge of psychology characteristic of the best modern physicians. When I grew better I came to feel that he had given his whole mind to the study of my case, though he never betrayed it in his conversation.|$|E
60|$|My quick-witted {{attendant}} fully {{appreciated the}} compliment <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>paying</b> to the costume of his race, and began more sedulously {{to arrange the}} folds of the one only garment which remained to me. Whilst he was doing this, I caught sight of a knot of young girls, who were sitting near us on the grass surrounded by heaps of flowers, which they were forming into garlands. I motioned to them to bring some of their handy-work to me; and in an instant a dozen wreaths were at my disposal. One of them I put round the apology for a hat which I had been forced to construct for myself out of palmetto-leaves, and some of the others I converted into a splendid girdle. These operations finished, with a slow and dignified step of a full-dressed beau I ascended the rock.|$|E
60|$|It doesn't pay to {{go behind}} the scenes and see the angel-voiced tenor beat his wife. Well, I'd been behind, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>paying</b> for it. Or else I was a fool. It is {{immaterial}} which was my situation. The situation is what counts, and the situation was that social intercourse for me was getting painful and difficult. On the other hand, it must be stated that on rare occasions, on very rare occasions, I did meet rare souls, or fools like me, with whom I could spend magnificent hours among the stars, or in the paradise of fools. I {{was married to a}} rare soul, or a fool, who never bored me and who was always a source of new and unending surprise and delight. But I could not spend all my hours solely in her company.|$|E
60|$|And now {{a word of}} caution.
