5000|$|In the United States, {{the cottage}} system {{was slow to}} catch on because of the greater expense of land, buildings, and {{services}} required, and the supposed increase <b>difficulty</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> of the inmates. Eventually, it was introduced {{with the opening of}} the Industrial School for Girls in Lancaster Massachusetts (1854) and the Ohio Reform School (1857) which was modeled after the Colonie de Mettray.By an act of the legislature in 1860, three Trust Houses were to be constructed on the school grounds at Westborough. One would be named the [...] "Farmhouse" [...] the second the [...] "Peter's House" [...] and the third would be named the [...] "Garden House". The farmhouse was an existing structure pre-dating the reform school. It would be renovated to house 30 boys, a master and matron. The Peter's house was also an existing structure pre-dating the reform school. It was the home of the original owner of the property. It to was renovated to house 30 boys, a master and a matron. The garden house was a new building built on the ruins of the reform school section destroyed by fire. This was a brick structure intended to house 30 boys with a master and matron.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1971 This study {{analyzes}} past {{forest fire}} behavior on a selected {{area in the}} Oregon Cascades {{in an attempt to}} evaluate level of fire hazard on selected vegetational areas. Vegetational areas were defined in five broad classes: Merchantable Douglas-fir Stands, Non-merchantable Douglas-fir Stands, Oak- Madrone Stands, Non- forest Lands, and Non-stocked Forest Lands. Rate of spread, <b>difficulty</b> <b>of</b> <b>control,</b> and final size were used as indications of fire behavior. Fire weather severity, slope steepness, aspect, and the vegetational cover type in vicinity of the fire were the environmental factors considered. Five hundred twenty-four fires were sampled in this analysis. The data were fitted to a statistical model for analysis. From this analysis, the importance of the environmental factors on rate of spread, <b>difficulty</b> <b>of</b> <b>control,</b> and final size was tested; tri-variate response surfaces were developed, representing rate of fire spread and <b>difficulty</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> according to each vegetational cover type. There were marked differences in the rate of fire spread and resistance to control of a fire in the five generalized cover types studied. Each vegetational cover type, therefore, possesses certain characteristics that suggest a certain level of fire hazard existing during the fire season...|$|E

The sounds obtained with this mapping present natural behaviour and are capable of simulate acoustic instruments and other real sounds. 1...|$|E

According to Plessner, the emeritus {{exponent}} {{of contemporary}} German philosophical anthropology, laughter – {{no less than}} verbal language – belongs to the specific expressive monopoly of human beings.

The purposes of this new methodology are i) to overcome the <b>difficulty</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> the layout parasitic elements with irregularities of analog devices and wiring effects and ii) to reduce the analog VLSI design period.

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} {{we report on}} the {{synthesis}} of sounds using cellular automata, specifically the multitype voter model. The mapping process adopted is based on digital signal processing analysis of automata evolutions and consists in mapping histograms onto spectrograms. The main problem of cellular automata is the <b>difficulty</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> and, consequently, sound synthesis methods based on these computational models normally present a high factor of randomness in the output. We have achieved a significant degree of control as to predict the type of sounds that we can obtain.

40|$|Abstract. In view of {{the lack}} of high-precision and {{high-resolution}} texture information of three-dimensional laser point cloud, this paper proposes a fusion method of three-dimensional laser point cloud and high-resolution digital images. Firstly the point cloud is transformed to the spherical image of laser intensity by projection. Then the rigorous projection transformation relation between the external digital image and three-dimensional point cloud is constructed easily through spherical image and feature information. Finally the color information of the point cloud is given by digital images. The experiment indicates that the novel method is able to avoid the layout <b>difficulty</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> points in the field and operating the three-dimensional data of indoor work, and meanwhile achieve the control of geometric accuracy...|$|E

30|$|The Keetch-Byram Drought Index (KBDI; Keetch and Byram 1968) {{was used}} as a proxy for soil {{moisture}} availability at each of the study sites.

For each day without more than 5.1 mm (0.2 in) of rainfall, the index is increased. More substantial increases are made when air temperature is high. The index is reduced for every 0.254 mm (0.01 in) above 5.1 mm (0.2 in) of rainfall received on the previous day. The minimum KBDI value is zero and the maximum value is 800.|$|E

30|$|One {{third of}} the area that burned was in natural {{vegetation}} (mainly fynbos shrublands), {{and more than half}} was in plantations of invasive alien (non-native) pine trees, or in natural vegetation invaded by alien trees. We used satellite imagery to assess burn severity in different land cover types by comparing pre- and post-fire images to estimate biomass consumed. We used daily weather data from two weather stations to calculate fire danger and drought indices over 70 years, and compared the fire weather conditions during the 2017 Knysna fires to the long-term weather record. The amount of biomass consumed was significantly higher in plantations of invasive alien trees, and in fynbos invaded by alien trees, than in uninvaded fynbos, providing support for the contention that invasion by alien trees increases the impact and <b>difficulty</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> of wildfires. Fire danger indices on the days of the fires were in the top 0.1 to 0.2 % of days in the historic record, indicating that fire weather conditions were extreme but not unprecedented. The fires were preceded by a prolonged drought, and 18 -month running means for two drought indices were the highest on record.|$|E

Twenty ethanolic traps and 30 wood samples of teak were installed in two stands in the municipalities of Alegre and Cachoeiro de Itapemirim, located in the south of Espírito Santo State, Brazil. After 18 months (January of 2011 to July of 2012) adult insects, pupas and larvae in the existing galleries in wood samples were collected. The collections of the adult insects were carried out monthly in the ethanolic traps. From August of 2011 to May of 2012, it were collected 742 coleopters in the traps, from the families Bostrichidae and Cerambycidae and subfamily Scolytinae, beyond non xylophagous individuals from the families Chrysomelidae, Curculionidae, Elateridae, Lagriidae, Lampyridae, Scarabaeidae and Tenebrionidae.
