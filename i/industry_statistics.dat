In the regional input-output project for the year 2002 the time consuming survey was replaced by integrating commodity and cargo statistics. This freight flow method {{was used for the}} years 1996 and 2002 to calculate trade flows for Finnish regions. The estimation results were then compared with the survey’s trade flow information. Estimations were also made for these years by the gravity approach to increase knowledge on, how this traditional method works at the regional level. According to the research results, the survey approach and the freight flow and gravity models estimated the order of the flows in the same way for 1996, but the freight flow model underestimated trade between small regions...|$|R

40|$|Construction is a {{strategic}} industry in developing economies like Kenya. In order for construction to ably perform this role, {{there is a}} need to provide information on its various economic aspects including raw materials, products, processes, finance and labour. Construction statistics of Kenya have been evaluated in order to ascertain their adequacy in terms of scope, portrait, reliability and responsiveness in their coverage of the construction <b>industry.</b> Official <b>statistics</b> published in the annual Statistical Abstract were reviewed according to these adequacy criteria. The findings are that: the scope of construction statistics is narrowly defined making the statistical portrait of the sector incomplete; the statistics are also unreliable in terms of quality and unresponsive to economical challenges of inflation, structural adjustment policies and the decline of the public sector's role in the construction industry. A participatory statistical governance framework is recommended in order to improve the scope of statistics and alleviate the attendant problems, such as the incomplete portrait, that come with the narrow scope.

The econometric estimates of the capital-labour substitution elasticity provide some evidence for the Cobb-Douglas assumption, at former measured sector and industry level in the long run, but show the Leontief function is more appropriate in the short run. These results facilitate interpretation of the industry-level productivity data, and highlight the variation in substitutability across industries and sectors.    ...|$|R
