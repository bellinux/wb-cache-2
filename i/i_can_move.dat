500|$|Discussing the {{workplace}} flirtation between Will and Emma, Gilsig deemed Terri [...] "a woman of conviction", {{willing to do}} [...] "whatever it takes" [...] to keep Will from leaving her, [...] "even if that means finding this woman and hunting her down". She explained that Will and Terri's communication is weak and that Terri is [...] "missing {{a lot of the}} skills for the marriage", and commented that Terri feels threatened by Will's commitment to the glee club, worried that it will pull him away from her. Gilsig characterized Terri as emotionally still being in high school, and explained: [...] "I think Terri still lives in that world, where <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>move</b> the pieces in such a way to create a picture, and that will make it real. I don't think she's learned that you can actually just have open conversations and talk about your fears and ask for your needs to be met in a direct, compassionate way. I think she's still in high school and thinking whatever you do, just don't let anybody know that you don't know what you're doing." [...] Discussing Terri's relationship with her sister Kendra, Gilsig commented: [...] "When Kendra tells Terri to do something, Terri does it. As crazy as Terri might be, she's actually pretty normal in the face of her sister. This [...] is Kendra's brainchild, and she just trusts her implicitly." ...|$|E
2500|$|During the 1992 presidential campaign, Krugman praised Bill Clinton's {{economic}} plan in The New York Times, and Clinton's campaign {{used some of}} Krugman's work on income inequality. At the time, it was considered likely that Clinton would offer him {{a position in the}} new administration, but allegedly Krugman's volatility and outspokenness caused Clinton to look elsewhere. Krugman later said that he was [...] "temperamentally unsuited for that kind of role. You have to be very good at people skills, biting your tongue when people say silly things." [...] In a Fresh Dialogues interview, Krugman added, [...] "you have to be reasonably organized... <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>move</b> into a pristine office and within three days it will look like a grenade went off." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "'I Won't Give Up' {{was written}} selfishly. As {{many of my}} songs are, I write {{for the purpose of}} {{understanding}} what the hell's going on in my life, my position in the world, processing that lesson and that miracle that I'm learning. Seeing it on the page, proving to myself that I understand the lesson, that I'm applying it to my life, and that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>move</b> on. Ultimately it was about, you know, regardless of what happens in this relationship, I don't have to give up on loving this person, or loving myself, or give up on whatever my dreams are. Even though it's written through the filter of relationships, it's not necessarily specific for relationships. For me, the true meaning exists in the bridge saying 'I don't want to be someone who walks away so easily, I'm here to stay and make a difference.' That is for all of us. We all have something that we're fighting for or that we're striving for. Whether we want to coach our soccer team to victory or lose five pounds in a month, whatever it is, there's nothing too small worth fighting for and there's nothing too big worth going after." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is nothing}} very bad, mother," [...] Vincent replied cheerfully; [...] "nothing {{at all to}} fret about. The wound is nothing to the {{injuries}} of most of those here. I suppose, doctor, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> be <b>moved</b> at once?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... “I {{think my}} left side is going,” Wolf Larsen wrote, {{the morning after}} his attempt to fire the ship. “The {{numbness}} is growing. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> hardly <b>move</b> my hand. You will have to speak louder. The last lines are going down.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am, then, to understand, monsieur, {{that there}} will be no inquiry into this case? That nothing that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> say will <b>move</b> you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Why, Benjamin,” he cried, as he {{made his}} first effort in this way, “you did not throw the net clear. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>move</b> it with my little finger. The rope slackens in my hand.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's better--now <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>move</b> a little," [...] cried Dick. [...] "Go on! There, that's enough. All right, Sam, you {{can come}} down." [...] And then Dick {{scrambled}} out {{in the snow and}} his brother joined him.|$|E
6000|$|... "It goes, of course, at {{the usual}} rate. Only {{the time has}} to go with it. Hence, if I move the hands, I change the time. To move them forwards, {{in advance of the}} true time, is impossible: but <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>move</b> them as much as a month backwards---that is the limit. And then you have the events all over again--with any {{alterations}} experience may suggest." ...|$|E
5000|$|What {{range of}} hands <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>move</b> all in with, {{considering}} the action {{so far and}} the stack sizes of the other players still in the hand? ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Gaffer's out, and his boat's out. His daughter's at home, sitting a-looking at the fire. But there's some supper getting ready, so Gaffer's expected. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> {{find what}} <b>move</b> he's upon, easy enough, presently.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'That was {{no part of}} our bargain,' {{answered}} the youth. 'But as nothing that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> say will <b>move</b> you, I suppose I shall {{have to try to}} do my best, for the Princess I will have.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Baas," [...] he said, [...] "I {{am going}} to look {{and find out what}} those people are doing, if they are still there, and then you will know how and when to attack them. Don't be afraid for me, Baas, it will be easy in that mist and you know <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>move</b> like a snake. Also if I should not come back, it does not matter and it will tell you that they are there." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There's no use in arguing," [...] Vane declared. [...] "You'll rig me {{a shelter}} of green boughs outside {{the tent and}} close to the fire. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>move</b> from the waist upward and, if it's necessary, drag myself with my hands. Then you can chop enough cord-wood to last a while, cook my share of the eatables, and leave me while you go down to the sloop. There's half a bag of flour on board her, and a few other things I'd be uncommonly glad to have." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In solitude--at night--by {{the light}} of a candle. There are certain {{emotions}} which a writer can easily enough excite--such as compassion or merriment. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>move</b> you to tears or laughter under almost any circumstances. But for my ghost story to be effective you must be made to feel fear--at least a strong sense of the supernatural--and that is a difficult matter. I have a right to expect that if you read me at all you will give me a chance; that you will make yourself accessible to the emotion that I try to inspire." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, my eye! Where <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>move</b> to!" [...] cries the boy, {{clutching}} quite desperately at {{his hair}} and beating his bare feet upon the floor of Mr. Snagsby's passage.|$|R
50|$|Company is {{the second}} solo album by former Razorlight and current We Are Scientists drummer Andy Burrows. The album was written and co-produced by Burrows {{as well as most}} of the {{instrumentation}} being played by him. It was released on 22 October 2012. Burrows later released the songs: Hometown, Because I Know That <b>I</b> <b>Can,</b> Keep <b>Moving</b> On, and If I Had A Heart as singles, all of which failed to chart.|$|R
5000|$|Composer Danny Elfman {{noted that}} the film's score was accessibly quick to produce, with a {{majority}} of the music being written in six weeks. Regarding the tonal quality of the score, Elfman stated, [...] "We're going to take an approach that's old school but not self-consciously old-fashioned. Let the melodrama be melodrama, let everything be what it is. I also think there's the advantage that I'm able to write narratively, and when I'm able to write narratively <b>I</b> <b>can</b> also <b>move</b> quicker because that's my natural instincts, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> tell a story in the music." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As I {{have kept}} Ada out so long," [...] I began afresh {{after a short}} while, [...] "I think I should like to have my own way a little longer, guardian. It {{would be best to}} be away from here before I see her. If Charley and I were to go to some country lodging as soon as <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>move,</b> and if I had a week there in which to grow {{stronger}} and to be revived by the sweet air and to look forward to the happiness of having Ada with me again, I think {{it would be better for}} us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} {{informed}} that I was advertised in the Glasgow newspapers {{during the time}} when I lay at this hotel, a stranger {{at the point of}} death. Trouble has perhaps made me morbidly suspicious. I am afraid of what may happen if I stay here, after my place of residence has been made publicly known. So, as soon as <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>move,</b> I go away in secret. It will be enough for me, if I can find rest and peace in some quiet place, in the country round Glasgow. You need feel no anxiety about my means of living. I have money enough for all that I need--and, if I get well again, I know how to earn my bread.|$|E
60|$|For my part, I am {{recovering}} strength, I {{hope and}} believe. Certainly <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>move</b> about from one room to another, without reeling much: but I still look so ghastly, as to 'back recoil,' perfectly knowing 'Why,' from {{everything in the}} shape of a looking glass. Robert has found an armchair for me at Siena. To say the truth, my time for enjoying this country life, except the enchanting silence and the look from the window, has not come yet: I must wait for a little more strength. Wiedeman's cheeks are beginning to redden already, and he delights in the pigeons and the pig and the donkey and a great yellow dog and everything else now; only he would change all your trees (except the apple trees), he says, for the Austrian band at any moment. He is rather a town baby....|$|E
6000|$|... "Stern man," [...] {{cried the}} May-lord, [...] "how <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>move</b> thee? Were the means at hand, I would resist to the death; being powerless, I entreat. Do {{with me as}} thou wilt, but let Edith go untouched." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm always a-moving on, sar," [...] cries the boy, wiping {{away his}} grimy tears with his arm. [...] "I've always been a-moving and a-moving on, ever since I was born. Where <b>can</b> <b>I</b> {{possibly}} <b>move</b> to, sir, more nor I do move!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] cried Jane, [...] "how <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>move</b> {{about in}} the world, while I know the eyes of all are on me, in curiosity to {{discover}} how I bear my disappointments. But you, Emily, are unsuspected. It is {{easy for you to}} affect a gaiety you do not feel." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I want to {{very much}} indeed," [...] Tavernake admitted. [...] "I {{was on my}} way to see her this morning and to ask her to let me have it a day or two before the time, but I felt, somehow, that there seemed to be a certain amount of deceit in going to her and taking it without saying a word to you. I felt that I had to come here first. But Beatrice, don't ask me to give it up. It means such a long time before <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>move</b> again. It's the first step that's so difficult, and I must--I must make a start. It's such a chance, this. I have spent so many hours {{thinking}} about it. I have planned and worked and sketched it all out as no one else could do. I must have that money." ...|$|E
60|$|Thereby I {{say nothing}} of my being tired of my life, while I was Patenting my invention. But I put this: Is it {{reasonable}} to make a man feel as if, in inventing an ingenious improvement meant to do good, he had done something wrong? How else can a man feel, when he is met by such difficulties at every turn? All inventors taking out a Patent MUST feel so. And look at the expense. How hard on me, and how hard on the country if there's any merit in me (and my invention is took up now, I am thankful to say, and doing well), to put me to all that expense before <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>move</b> a finger! Make the addition yourself, and it'll come to ninety-six pound, seven, and eightpence. No more, and no less.|$|E
6000|$|... "I understand," [...] said she, [...] "that you {{are trying}} to get hot water out of your well, and that there {{is likely to be a}} lot more than you need, so that it will run down by the side of the road. I just want to say that if a stream of hot water comes down past my house some of the {{children}} will be bound to get into it and be scalded to death, and I came to say that if that well is going to squirt b'iling water I'd like to have notice so that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>move,</b> though where a widow with so many orphans is going to move to nobody knows. Mr. Colwell says that if you had got him to tell you where to put that well there would have been no danger of this sort of thing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, Amelie," [...] Leslie said at last, {{holding her}} at arms' length {{that he might}} look the better at her, [...] "you are scarce changed. It {{does not seem to}} me that you are five years older than when I saw you last, and yet Malcolm tells me that you too have been a prisoner. How much my love has cost you, dear! No, you are scarce changed, while I have become an old man -- my hair is as white as snow, and I am so {{crippled}} with rheumatism <b>I</b> <b>can</b> scarce <b>move</b> my limbs." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps not. Nevertheless, I {{will do what}} <b>I</b> <b>can.</b> She <b>moves</b> a little. If she {{is lifted}} over this reef while we are on shore, she {{will be carried out}} to sea and lost, and that must not be allowed. Leave me here till you land the men, and then send the boat back with two of them. We will put some of the cutter's ballast into it and try to tow her off. It won't take half-an-hour, and that will not {{interfere}} with your plans, I should think, for the whole night lies before us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{is more to}} {{the purpose}} {{is that it will}} {{approximately}} absorb our whole available capital," [...] said the first speaker, who took up another paper. [...] "Then we have as an alternative scheme several leagues of road and trail cutting, including wooden bridges and a strip that must be dug out of an impassable mountainside. You have to add to it the cost and maintenance of pack-horses and the rates you'd have to pay the owners of the nearest crushing-plant to do your reducing. Gentlemen, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> only <b>move</b> that these estimates stand over, and that in the meanwhile we merely proceed with the heading." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "God {{has been}} so good to me, Mary Louise!" [...] she once exclaimed as they were sitting {{together}} in the garden. [...] "He has given me sight, that I may revel in bookland and in the beauties of flowers and trees and shifting skies and the faces of my friends. He has given me the blessing of hearing, that I may enjoy the strains of sweet music and the songs of {{the birds and the}} voices of those I love. And I can scent the fragrance of the morning air, the perfume of the roses and--yes! even the beefsteak Aunt Hannah is frying for supper. The beefsteak tastes as good to me as it does to you. I can feel the softness of your cheek; I can sing melodies, in my own way, whenever my heart swells with joy. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>move</b> about, by means of this wonderful chair, without the bother of walking. You don't envy me, Mary Louise, because you enjoy almost equal blessings; but you must admit I have reason for being happy." ...|$|E
60|$|The most {{wonderful}} {{things have happened}} and are continually happening to us. All the paper that I possess consists of five old note-books {{and a lot of}} scraps, and I have only the one stylographic pencil; but so long as <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>move</b> my hand I will continue to set down our experiences and impressions, for, since we are the only men of the whole human race to see such things, it is of enormous importance that I should record them whilst they are fresh in my memory and before that fate which seems to be constantly impending does actually overtake us. Whether Zambo can at last take these letters to the river, or whether I shall myself in some miraculous way carry them back with me, or, finally, whether some daring explorer, coming upon our tracks with the advantage, perhaps, of a perfected monoplane, should find this bundle of manuscript, in any case I can see that what I am writing is destined to immortality as a classic of true adventure.|$|E
6000|$|... "I have it," [...] she announced. [...] "Lend me {{a gang of}} your {{boys for}} to-day. I'll build a grass house for myself over {{in the far corner}} of the compound--on piles, of course. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>move</b> in to-night. I'll be {{comfortable}} and safe. The Tahitians can keep an anchor watch just as aboard ship. And then I'll study cocoanut planting. In return, I'll run the kitchen end of your household and give you some decent food to eat. And finally, I won't listen to any of your protests. I know all that you are going to say and offer--your giving the bungalow up to me and building a grass house for yourself. And I won't have it. You may as well consider everything settled. On the other hand, if you don't agree, I will go across the river, beyond your jurisdiction, and build a village for myself and my sailors, whom I shall send in the whale-boat to Guvutu for provisions. And now I want you to teach me billiards." ...|$|E

[...] Once again her pride had given way before this new and awful fear that her errand would be in vain, that she had come here as a suppliant before this rogue, that she had humbled her dignity, entreated him, almost knelt to him, and that he, for some base reason which she could not understand, meant to give himself the {{satisfaction}} of refusing the fortune which she did promise him.|$|R
5000|$|Womack told The Early Show [...] "It's {{very much}} in line with my last three. This is my fourth project. You know, I have the real {{traditional}} country songs on there, and then I have {{some things that are}} a little more contemporary and up-tempo. And--and, but I--you know, I try to find songs from the best songwriters that I can." [...] Womack told Billboard, [...] "Every album seems critical when you are making it. I {{have a lot of confidence}} in my team. You can't predict commercially what an album is going to do. I just have to make the best music <b>I</b> <b>can</b> and <b>move</b> on.
