The data set covers bilateral trade in agricultural goods for 152 countries over the periods 1990 - 93 and 1999 - 2002.

40|$|The {{subject-matter}} of {{this article}} is the recently altered trade policy and practice of Australia and their consistency with the WTO multilateral trading policies and principles. Following its unhappy experience with the power and politics driven trading under GATT, Australia unequivocally supported the legalistic approach of the WTO <b>trading</b> <b>system</b> during the Uruguay Round. Its active participation in the WTO has given it a fair share of global <b>free</b> <b>trade.</b> The rule-based trading framework of the WTO protects, more often than not, Australia from powerful trading states and blocs using their economic clout to gain unfair terms of trade. Australia has recently opted to pursue its multi-track trading together with its commitments to WTO multilateral trade liberalization. Since 2002, it has been negotiating a preferential bilateral <b>free</b> <b>trade</b> agreement with its preferred trading partners. The flurry of such negotiations has resulted in the conclusion of a preferential bilateral <b>free</b> <b>trade</b> agreement with Singapore in 2003. Negotiation towards a similar agreement with the U. S. is ongoing. A preferential trade agreement (PTA) is by nature discriminatory and as such inconsistent with the Most Favoured Nation (MFN) rule under GATT Article I. Despite this apparent contradiction, GATT Article XXIV permits bilateral PTAs as an exception to the MFN rule under certain explicit conditions, which militate against discriminatory, differential and unequal trading deals among WTO members. This article examines {{the extent to which the}} existing and potential PTAs of Australia comply with the conditions of GATT Article XXIV. It concludes that these PTAs are not complementary, if not obstructive alternatives, to the WTO multilateral <b>free</b> <b>trading</b> <b>system.</b> They are not in the best long-term trading interest of Australia either. 19 page(s...|$|R

His party was unable to deal {{effectively}} with the rhetorical onslaught. Although he had improved the organization of the Conservative Party, Disraeli was firmly based in the rural gentry, and had little contact with or understanding of the urban middle class that was increasingly dominating his party. Besides issues of foreign policy, even more important thing Conservatives were unable to effectively defend their economic record on the home front. The 1870s coincided with a long term global depression caused by the collapse of the worldwide railway boom of the 1870s which previously had been so profitable to Britain. The stress was growing by the late 1870s: prices fell, profits fell, employment fell, and there was downward pressure on wage rates that cause much hardship among the industrial working class. The <b>free</b> <b>trade</b> <b>system</b> supported by both parties made Britain defenseless against the flood of cheap wheat from North America, which was exacerbated by the worst harvest of the century in Britain in 1879. The party in power, of course, got the blame, and Liberals repeatedly emphasized the growing budget deficit as a measure of bad stewardship. In the election itself, Disraeli's party lost heavily up and down the line, especially in Scotland and Ireland, and in the urban boroughs.
