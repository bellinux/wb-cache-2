Diffusion coefficients were measured by the incremental outgassing of helium from apatite. The measured range of diffusion parameters is nearly identical for apatites of different chemical composition, grain size, and grain morphology. Isothermal experiments are consistent with spherical diffusion domains which are smaller than the physical grain size. <b>Helium</b> <b>ages</b> may reflect complex thermal histories where samples spend considerable amounts of time in the region where helium is only partially retained. Therefore, the solution to the full radiogenic helium diffusion/production equation is used to interpret <b>helium</b> <b>ages</b> instead of Dodson's (1973) closure temperature formulation. The time required to achieve a steady state between helium production and diffusion at various temperatures can be determined, as well as the range of temperatures defining the helium partial retention zone (the region where helium retentivity is most sensitive to temperature). In general, this zone resides at 40 - 80 °C (2 &# 177; 1 km depth for typical continental geothermal gradients). This is 35 °C cooler than the analogous apatite fission track partial annealing zone.

40|$|We have {{analyzed}} helium ages of apatites {{from several}} boreholes in the Otway basin, Australia, {{to evaluate whether}} laboratory helium diffusivity can be accurately extrapolated to conditions relevant in nature. Downhole apatite helium ages define a broad swath of values from 78 – 71 Ma at the surface (15 °C) to nearly zero at depths corresponding to ambient temperatures of ∼ 80 °C. The width of the swath results from uncertainties in corrected borehole temperatures, differences in the thermal history experienced by the various boreholes, and possibly from slightly different helium diffusivities among the detrital apatite grains studied. In the eastern Otway basin, the shape and position of the <b>helium</b> <b>age</b> profile is in good agreement with predictions based on the extrapolation of laboratory diffusivity data for Durango apatite coupled with published thermal histories for {{this part of the}} basin. In contrast, helium ages are much younger than predicted in the western Otway basin. Based on measured ages from Otway sediments, which have been essentially isothermal over the last few million years, an empirical diffusivity (D/α^ 2) of 2 × 10 ^(− 15) s^(− 1) can be assigned to apatites residing at downhole temperatures of 67 – 97 °C. This empirical diffusivity is consistent with laboratory diffusion measurements, demonstrating that such measurements are reasonably accurate and can be applied with confidence to natural geologic settings.

Helium ages from a new orogen-parallel, constant-elevation sample transect are relatively uniform (∼ 60 Ma) and not correlated with topography, unlike those from a similar, lower elevation transect approx 15 km to the west. We interpret the marked difference in the two orogen-parallel profiles to reflect a headward decrease in long-wavelength, transverse relief {{at the time of}} cooling, consistent with either a concave-up stream gradient, typical of those observed near the headwaters of modern Sierran trunk streams, or a convex gradient like those found along slope breaks of eroding plateau edges. From the San Joaquin drainage we obtained a new helium age-versus-elevation profile, which has a comparable slope to those previously reported for the Yosemite Valley, Kings Canyon, and Mt. Whitney areas. This new profile yields slightly older ages at a given elevation as expected from its position adjacent to the largest major drainage. The age versus elevation profiles imply that the mean denudation rate of the region in the Cenozoic was about 0. 04 to 0. 05 mm/yr. We show that long-wavelength (λ = 70 km) relief inferred from longitudinal <b>helium</b> <b>age</b> variations is a strong function of erosion rate, such that even relatively subdued relief is detectable with <b>helium</b> <b>age</b> profiling provided that denudation rates were low. Using the rate implied by Sierran age-versus-elevation profiles, we infer long-wavelength relief of 1500 ± 500 m in the Late Cretaceous.

Analysis {{of the relationship between}} helium ages and grain size in newly analyzed samples, as well as in samples previously reported, reveals that grain size variations may contribute to the previously reported scatter in helium ages among aliquots of the same sample. In addition, systematic variations in apatite grain size with borehole depth or temperature may also {{have a significant effect on}} the interpretation of borehole <b>helium</b> <b>age</b> data. Incorporation of the observed grain size variations in Otway borehole apatites into forward models based on published thermal histories, principally based on vitrinite reflectance and fission-track data, suggests that existing models for the eastern Otway Basin are broadly consistent with the helium data. In contrast, thermal histories for western basin boreholes, now thought to be at maximum temperatures, predict helium ages that are generally older than the observed ages, implying that basin temperatures were hotter than indicated by the models. This discrepancy is consistent with a Cenozoic heating event in parts of the western Otway Basin similar to that documented for the eastern basin.

By documenting aspects of the low-temperature (40 °– 100 °C) thermal history of the tectonic blocks of the San Bernardino Mountains in southern California, we have placed new {{constraints on the}} magnitude and timing of uplift. Old <b>helium</b> <b>ages</b> (64 – 21 Ma) from the large Big Bear plateau predate the recent uplift of the range and show that only several kilometers of exhumation has taken place since the Late Cretaceous period. These ages imply that {{the surface of the}} plateau may have been exposed in the late Miocene and was uplifted only ∼ 1 km above the Mojave Desert in the last few Myr by thrusting on the north and south. A similar range in <b>helium</b> <b>ages</b> (56 – 14 Ma) from the higher San Gorgonio block to the south suggests that its crest was once contiguous with that of the Big Bear block and that its greater elevation represents a localized uplift that the Big Bear plateau did not experience. The structure of the San Gorgonio block appears to be a gentle antiform, based on the geometry of helium isochrons and geologic constraints. Young ages (0. 7 – 1. 6 Ma) from crustal slices within the San Andreas fault zone indicate uplift of a greater magnitude than blocks to the north. These smaller blocks probably experienced ≥ 3 – 4 km of uplift at rates ≥ 1. 5 mm/yr in the past few Myr and would stand ≥ 2. 5 km higher than the Big Bear plateau if erosion had not occurred. The greater uplift of tectonic blocks adjacent to and within the San Andreas fault zone is more likely the result of oblique displacement along high-angle faults than motion along the thrust fault that bounds {{the north side of the}} range. We speculate that this uplift is the result of convergence and slip partitioning associated with local geometric complexities along this strike-slip system. Transpression thus appears to have been accommodated by both vertical displacement within the San Andreas fault zone and thrusting on adjacent structures...|$|R

40|$|A {{mathematical}} {{framework for}} quantitative evaluation of alpha-stopping effects on (U-Th) /He ages has been developed. Alpha stopping ranges in the ^(238) U, ^(235) U, and ^(232) Th chains vary between ∼ 10 and ∼ 30 μm, depending on decay energy and density/composition of the stopping medium. In {{the case of}} U- and Th-rich accessory minerals (e. g. apatite, zircon, titanite), the dominant effect of long stopping distances is alpha ejection to adjacent minerals. For grains smaller than a few hundred microns in minimum dimension, ejection effects will cause measured <b>helium</b> <b>ages</b> to substantially underestimate true ages. For example, a sphere of 100 μm radius retains only ∼ 82 % of its alphas. For a homogeneous distribution of parent nuclides, the fraction of alphas ejected is ∼ 1 / 4 of the mean alpha range multiplied by the crystal surface to volume ratio, independent of geometry. Removal of the outer 20 μm of a crystal prior to dating eliminates the region which has experienced alpha loss, but may lead to erroneous ages when crystals are strongly zoned with respect to uranium and thorium. By careful characterization of four sieved apatite separates from a single sample, we show {{that it is possible}} to accurately correct (U-Th) /He ages for alpha ejection even when ejection exceeds 35 % of total decays. Our results are useful for identifying the size and shape of grains which are best suited for (U-Th) /He dating and provide the basis for correcting ages when ejection effects are significant.

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the potential of}} the (U-Th) /He system for low-temperature thermochronometry, we have studied helium diffusion and have measured <b>helium</b> <b>ages</b> on Durango fluorapatite and on apatites from a gabbro and two tonalites from the Peninsular Ranges Batholith. Diffusivity at moderate to very low temperatures (as low as 80 °C) was measured to high analytical precision using long duration incremental outgassing experiments. All four apatites displayed remarkably similar helium diffusion behavior. Helium loss apparently occurs via volume diffusion from subgrain domains (< 60 μm) which are nearly identical in size in all samples. At temperatures below 290 °C, diffusivity obeys a highly linear Arrhenius relationship with an implied activation energy of about 36 kcal/mol. Above this temperature, diffusivity deviates from linearity toward lower activation energies. This transition does not arise from multiple diffusion domains, but rather from a reversible change in the physical mechanism of helium diffusion. For thermochronometric purposes the high-temperature diffusion behavior is largely irrelevant because essentially no helium is retained over geologic time at temperatures above 290 °C. Using the results from the low-temperature regime, all samples yield helium closure temperatures in the range 75 ± 7 °C. This value is independent of chemical composition and grain size of the apatites, suggesting that a single closure temperature may apply {{to a wide range of}} samples. The (U-Th) /He ages of these apatites (17 – 120 Ma) range from a small fraction to nearly 100 % of the crystallization age of their host rocks, and are consistent with a low-temperature thermochronometric interpretation.

At both locations apatite fission track (AFT) ages are older than the corresponding He ages; at Clisham they vary from 189 ± 28 Ma to 242 ± 26 Ma, and from 186 ± 6 Ma to 257 ± 12 Ma at Sgorr Dhonuill. Apatite He ages increase linearly with elevation suggesting that the cooling rate remained constant in the late Mesozoic. However, the apatite He age profile requires a period of rapid cooling after &# 8764; 100 Ma. Apatite He ages predicted from the AFT-derived thermal histories are indistinguishable from measured He ages for a rapid cooling event of 1 to 10 Myr duration between 61 and 47 Ma at Sgorr Dhonuill and 65 to 49 Ma at Clisham. The combined apatite FT- and He-derived thermal histories constrain the early Cenozoic geothermal gradient at 39 ± 9 °C/km at Sgorr Dhonuill and 19 ± 6 °C/km at Clisham. Amounts of denudation related to the rapid cooling event vary from 1330 ± 230 m at Sgorr Dhonuill to 2250 ± 750 m at Clisham, in agreement with models that predict greater amounts of denudation where magmatic underplating is thicker. However, the direct correlation between underplating-driven surface uplift and denudation may only be apparent and a more complex link between spatial variation of surface uplift and denudation is suggested.

40|$|Knowledge of the {{diffusion}} domain is of primary importance for age interpretation in noble gas thermochronometers. We {{have developed a}} Monte Carlo method to solve {{the diffusion}} equation in three-dimensional space and have used it to {{examine the effect of}} realistic crystal geometries and anisotropy on noble gas diffusion. The method is based on the simulation of Brownian motion with a modified distribution of collision distances and with a variable mean free path. This approach drastically reduces calculation time while remaining accurate. This original approach is able to treat isotropic and anisotropic diffusion, any 3 D shape, ejection and zonation. A code simulating production, ejection and diffusion from the grain to the external medium has been implemented to compute <b>helium</b> <b>ages</b> of minerals subjected to temperature histories. In parallel, another module has been developed to simulate diffusion experiments and diffusion coefficient determination for all types of He profiles in a grain (homogenous, depleted edge due to ejection, heterogeneous profile due to previous diffusion, etc). Both types of simulations are suitable for isotopic and anisotropic diffusion; we develop examples for apatite and zircon (U–Th) /He thermochronology but the method can be applied to any other noble gas thermochronometer. The Monte Carlo simulation reproduces the He age variation obtained by other calculation methods for simple geometries and for well-known thermal histories, demonstrating the viability of the tool. In the case of isotropic diffusion, we show that generally even for realistic shapes with many ridges the He age resulting from the diffusion can be well calculated by assuming a spherical shape of the same surface/volume (S/V) ratio. The only requirement for adequate representation of grains by spheres is thus accurate knowledge of their true shapes and dimensions. For anisotropic diffusion, we introduce a new concept termed “active radius”, which describes the complex anisotropic diffusion process by isotropic diffusion in a sphere. In this sense, the active radius can be seen {{as an extension of the}} sphere-equivalent radius to the anisotropic case. The active radius can be computed for any geometrical shape without Monte Carlo sampling, and a separate simple code is made available for its computation...|$|R

FT ages from 33 SGM samples range from 3 to 64 Ma. <b>Helium</b> <b>ages,</b> ranging from 3 to 43 Ma, were obtained from 13 of these samples: all of the He ages are the same or younger than their respective FT ages. FT ages from 10 SBM samples were older, ranging from 45 to 90 Ma. The FT and He data document at least three phases of cooling in the SGM, but only two in the SBM. Prior to 7 Ma, the thermal history of the SGM appears to have been nearly identical to many of the core complexes in the Basin and Range of south-eastern California: a major phase of cooling is indicated from 60 to 40 Ma, with a more recent phase beginning at 23 Ma and continuing until 10 Ma. The similarity of this timing to that of core complexes suggests that the SGM also originated as a core complex, when the rocks were adjacent to the Chocolate–Orocopia Mountains, and that some of the range-bounding faults were initially extensional. In the SBM, the two phases of cooling documented by the FT data occurred from 65 to 55 Ma, and from 18 Ma to the present. The timing on the second phase is very poorly constrained and, therefore, we do not speculate on the origin of the SBM. The most recent phase of cooling appears to have begun at 7 Ma in the SGM, {{as the result of the}} onset of contractional deformation. A more accelerated phase of cooling may have begun at 3 Ma. Distinct variations in the total amounts and rates of cooling between different fault-bounded blocks within the SGM are documented since 7 Ma. We use these variations in cooling rates to calculate denudation rates, which are then compared to topographic characteristics for each structural block. These comparisons suggest that more rapid bedrock uplift in the eastern and southern part of the range has strongly affected the present-day physiography. Despite a higher mean elevation, the SBM are much less dissected than the SGM, suggesting that the most recent phase of cooling and bedrock uplift began in the last 3 Myr, much later than the initiation of recent bedrock uplift in the SGM. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{show that}} the exoplanet-host star iota Horologii, alias HD 17051, which belongs to the {{so-called}} Hyades stream, was formed within the primordial Hyades stellar cluster and has evaporated towards its present location, 40 pc away. This result has been obtained unambiguously by studying the acoustic oscillations of this star, using the HARPS spectrometer in La Silla Observatory (ESO, Chili). Besides the fact that ι Hor belongs to the Hyades stream, we give evidence that {{it has the same}} metallicity, <b>helium</b> abundance, and <b>age</b> as the other stars of the Hyades cluster. They were formed together, at the same time, in the same primordial cloud. This result has strong implications for theories of stellar formation. It also indicates that the observed overmetallicity of this exoplanet-host star, about twice that of the Sun, is original and not caused by planet accretion during the formation of the planetary system.

40|$|The {{interpretation}} of transient tracer observations depends on dif•cult {{to obtain information}} on the evolution in time of the tracer boundary conditions and interior distributions. Recent studies have attempted to circumvent this problem by making use of a derived quantity, age, based on the simultaneous distribution of two complementary tracers, such as tritium and its daughter, <b>helium</b> 3. The <b>age</b> is defined {{with reference to the}} surface such that the boundary condition takes on a constant value of zero. We use a two-dimensional model to explore the circumstances under which such a combination of conservation equations for two complementary tracers can lead to a cancellation of the time derivative terms. An interesting aspect of this approach is that mixing can serve as a source or sink of tracer based age. We define an idealized "ventilation age tracer " that is conservative with respect to mixing, and we explore how its behavior compares with that of the tracer-based ages over a range of advective and diffusive parameters. 1...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{calibration}} {{studies have}} expanded {{the range of}} target minerals suitable for cosmogenic ^ 3 He dating to include U and Th-rich phases such as zircon, apatite, and titanite. These minerals often contain large amounts of radiogenic ^ 4 He that present several analytical challenges for precise and accurate ^ 3 He determinations. In this paper we document the abundance sensitivity {{and changes in the}} absolute sensitivity and time evolution of the ^ 3 He signal over a wide range of ^ 4 He pressures in a MAP 215 - 50 noble gas mass spectrometer. Large (> 50 %) decreases in sensitivity with ^ 4 He amount arising from space charge effects were observed but can be corrected for using an isotope dilution–like technique in which ^ 3 He spike is added to a sample midway through the mass spectrometric analysis. Large amounts of ^ 4 He also cause the time evolution of the ^ 3 He signal to become steeper, degrading precision of the initial peak height determination from the intercept. Taken together we find that these effects preclude reliable analysis of samples with ^ 4 He > 1 μmol and that ^ 3 He/^ 4 He ratios of greater than ~ 5 × 10 ^(− 10) are required to routinely measure ^ 3 He to better than 20 % precision. We present some general considerations by which to assess the probability of success of measuring cosmogenic ^ 3 He in these phases as a function of elevation, exposure <b>age,</b> and <b>helium</b> cooling <b>age...</b>|$|R
40|$|We used Hubble Space Telescope {{observations}} {{to study the}} young cluster NGC 1844 in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). We estimated the fraction and the mass-ratio distribution of photometric binaries and report that the main sequence presents an intrinsic breadth which cannot be explained {{only in terms of}} photometric errors, and is unlikely because of differential reddening. We attempted different interpretations of this feature, including stellar rotation, binary stars, and the presence of multiple stellar populations of different <b>ages,</b> metallicity, <b>helium,</b> or C+N+O abundance. Although we have excluded <b>age,</b> <b>helium,</b> and C+N+O variations of being responsible for the main-sequence spread, none of the other interpretations is conclusive.

40|$|We {{compare the}} {{accurate}} empirical mass-luminosity (M-L) relation based on five Hyades binary systems to predictions of stellar models calculated with various input parameters (<b>helium,</b> metallicity, <b>age)</b> or physics (mixing-length ratio, model atmosphere, equation of state, microscopic diffusion). Models {{based on a}} helium content Ysim 0. 28 inferred from the dydz enrichment law are more than 3 sigma beyond the observations, suggesting that the initial helium abundance is lower than expected from its supersolar metallicity. With the photometric metallicity (FeH= 0. 144 pm 0. 013 dex, Grenon (2000) we derive Y= 0. 255 ± 0. 009. Because of the (Y,FeH) degeneracy in the M-L plane, the uncertainty grows to Delta Y= 0. 013 if the metallicity from spectroscopy is adopted (FeH= 0. 14 pm 0. 05 dex, Cayrel de Strobel et al 1997). We use these results to discuss the Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram of the Hyades, in the (Mv,B-V) plane, based on the very precise Hipparcos dynamical parallaxes. Present models fit the tight observed sequence very well except at low temperatures. In the low mass region of the HR diagram sensitive to the mixing-length parameter (aMLT), {{the slope of the}} main sequence (MS) suggests that aMLT could decrease from a solar (or even supersolar) value at higher mass to subsolar values at low mass, which is also supported by the modeling of the vB 22 M-L relation. We find that the discrepancy at low temperatures (B-V≳ 1. 2) remains, even if an improved equation of state or better model atmospheres are used. Finally, we discuss the positions of the stars at turn-off in the light of their observed rotation rates and we deduce that the maximum age of the Hyades predicted by the present models is sim 650 Myr.

40|$|We present {{ultraviolet}} (UV) integrated {{colors of}} 44 Galactic globular clusters (GGCs) observed with the Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) in both FUV and NUV bands. This data-base {{is the largest}} homogeneous catalog of UV colors ever published for stellar systems in our Galaxy. The proximity of GGCs {{makes it possible to}} resolve many individual stars even with the somewhat low spatial resolution of GALEX. This allows us to determine how the integrated UV colors are driven by hot stellar populations, primarily horizontal branch stars and their progeny. The UV colors are found to be correlated with various parameters commonly used to define the horizontal branch morphology. We also investigate how the UV colors vary with parameters like metallicity, <b>age,</b> <b>helium</b> abundance and concentration. We find {{for the first time that}} GCs associated with the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy have (FUV-V) colors systematically redder than GGCs with the same metallicity. Finally, we speculate about the presence of an interesting trend, suggesting that the UV color of GCs may be correlated with the mass of the host galaxy, in the sense that more massive galaxies possess bluer clusters.

40|$|Accurate {{determination}} of cosmogenic 3 He concentrations in olivine and pyroxene phenocrysts requires {{knowledge of the}} amount of magmatic 3 He also in the sample. The magmatic 3 He component is commonly estimated by measuring the magmatic 3 He/ 4 He ratio and assuming that all 4 He is magmatic. However, this approach yields incorrect results if 4 He produced by U and Th decay is also present. Here we propose several strategies to account for the presence of radiogenic 4 He. The optimal approach depends on whether the <b>helium</b> closure <b>age</b> (Tc) is similar to the exposure age (Te) of the analyzed phenocrysts. (i) When Tc = Te, which applies to uneroded lava flows, the ratio of cosmogenic 3 He to radiogenic 4 He is constant and the correction for radiogenic helium is independent of time. We provide a simple expression for a correction factor (R) that can be applied in this case. (ii) In the more common case that Tc > Te, it is necessary to obtain an independent constraint on the closure age to estimate the radiogenic correction. In either case a quantitative estimate of the radiogenic 4 He production rate is required. Because of the long stopping distance of α-particles, this production rate depends on the U and Th concentrations of both phenocryst and host, and also on phenocryst grain size. To illustrate the magnitude and uncertainty of the necessary corrections, we compiled U and Th measurements on phenocrysts and whole rock samples of basalts and andesites, supplemented by new measurements on Hawaiian basalts and Altiplano andesites. Our data and models suggest that some published cosmogenic 3 He production rate determinations may have underestimated the true production rate by up to 5 % because the presence of radiogenic 4 He was not recognized. Similarly, a recent study presenting cosmogenic 3 He derived erosion rates in > 4 Ma Hawaiian olivines probably overestimates true erosion rates by an order of magnitude or more...|$|R
40|$|Titanium {{films were}} {{deposited}} onto molybdenum substrates and then converted into titanium tritides (TiT 1. 5 – 1. 8) films inside a tritiding apparatus loaded with pure tritium gas. Evolution of tritium and helium in the titanium tritide films {{over a period}} of four years was investigated using a thermal desorption technique, together with X-ray diffraction analysis. Results showed that desorption profiles of the tritium varied significantly with the evolution of He contents. Apart from the primary peak from tritium desorption located at a temperature between 610 and 840 K, another higher temperature tritium desorption peak (at ∼ 950 K) was observed, attributed to damages in the lattice structures induced by generation of 3 He bubbles. Release of helium in the tritide film became significant after a long term aging process (i. e., after a few years). Depending on the amount of the 3 He bubbles generated due to the decay of tritium, spectra of the thermal helium desorption showed five peaks in the range from room temperature to ∼ 1750 K, corresponding to different states of <b>helium</b> evolution during <b>aging</b> of the titanium tritide films. The amounts of helium desorption in different stages were estimated, and the dissociation energy of helium from different trap states {{as a function of the}} aging duration was obtained...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} a further step in the {{investigation}} of the morphology of the color-magnitude diagram of Galactic globular clusters, and the fine-tuning of theoretical models, made possible by the recent observational efforts to build homogeneous photometric databases. In particular, we examine here the calibration of the morphological parameter W(HB) vs. metallicity, originally proposed by Brocato et al. (1998), which essentially measures the color position of the red-giant branch. We show that the parameter can be used to have a first-order estimate of the cluster metallicity, since the dispersion around the mean trend with [Fe/H] is compatible with the measurement errors. The tight W(HB) -[Fe/H] relation is then used to show that variations in <b>helium</b> content or <b>age</b> do not affect the parameter, whereas it is strongly influenced by the mixing-length parameter alpha (as expected). This fact allows us, for the first time, to state that there is no trend of alpha with the metal content of a cluster. A thorough examination of the interrelated questions of the alpha-elements enhancement and the color-T(eff) transformations, highlights that there is an urgent need for an independent assessment of which of the two presently accepted metallicity scales is the true indicator of a cluster's iron content. Whatever scenario is adopted, it also appears that a deep revision of the (V-I) -temperature relations is needed. Comment: 15 pages, 21 figures, accepted by A&...|$|R
