2500|$|International Cricket Council (ICC) {{made him}} {{a part of the}} International Panel of ICC Umpires on 2 August 2009. Samarjitsinh Gaekwad, the then {{vice-president}} of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), said, [...] "Hazare has a good umpiring record and his name was discussed during the meet of umpires committee of BCCI. He was selected considering his talent and we are proud to have an international umpire with us now." [...] About his selection, Hazare said,"It is due to the efforts of senior Baroda Cricket Association (BCA) officials that <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the panel," [...] adding,"I have been conveyed about my selection by BCA authorities, but I am yet to receive official letter from BCCI." [...] However the BCCI didn't recommended his name for the 2011 cricket season, citing his performance, which was evaluated by the match referees of the ICC.|$|E

"You are right, Shepherdess," [...] {{answered}} Soa, [...] "the plan is mine; <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> save you, and also," [...] {{she added}} coolly, [...] "to be revenged upon that white thief who loves you, for he shall {{live to see}} you the wife of another man, a wild man." ...|$|E
60|$|But <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> out <b>to</b> be indubitable {{that the}} owners of these lead- mills {{honestly}} and sedulously try to reduce {{the dangers of the}} occupation to the lowest point.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, any way, {{when we get}} it I'll make <b>it</b> up <b>to</b> five hundred. Bicky'll never know. Do {{you suspect}} Mr. Bickersteth would suspect anything, Jeeves, if <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> up <b>to</b> five hundred?" ...|$|R
50|$|In 2007 <b>I</b> finally <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the Bush White House as {{a presidential}} speechwriter. But it {{was not at all}} what I envisioned. It was less like Aaron Sorkin’s The West Wing and more like The Office.|$|R
6000|$|... "Lady Jane!" [...] cried Sir Pitt, {{starting}} up, [...] "this {{is really}} language--" [...] "I {{have been a}} true and faithful wife to you, Sir Pitt," [...] Lady Jane continued, intrepidly; [...] "I have kept my marriage vow as <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> God and have been obedient and gentle as a wife should. But righteous obedience has its limits, and I declare that I will not bear that--that woman again under my roof; if she enters it, I and my children will leave it. She is not worthy {{to sit down with}} Christian people. You--you must choose, sir, between her and me"; and with this my Lady swept out of the room, fluttering with her own audacity, and leaving Rebecca and Sir Pitt not a little astonished at it.|$|E
6000|$|... 'It {{is neither}} a bold nor a diversified country,' said I to myself, 'this country which is three-quarters Flemish, and a quarter French; yet it has its attractions too. Though great lines of railway {{traverse}} it, the trains leave it behind, and go puffing off to Paris and the South, to Belgium and Germany, to the Northern Sea-Coast of France, and to England, and merely smoke it a little in passing. Then I don't know it, {{and that is a}} good reason for being here; and I can't pronounce half the long queer names I see inscribed over the shops, and that is another good reason for being here, since I surely ought to learn how.' In short, I was 'here,' and I wanted an excuse for not going away from here, and <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> my satisfaction, and stayed here.|$|E
60|$|All Edinburgh and the Pentland Hills glinted {{above me}} {{in a kind}} of smuisty brightness, now and again {{overcome}} with blots of cloud; of Leith there was no more than the tops of chimneys visible, and {{on the face of the}} water, where the haar[24] lay, nothing at all. Out of this I was presently aware of a sound of oars pulling, and a little after (as if out of the smoke of a fire) a boat issued. There sat a grave man in the stern-sheets, well muffled from the cold, and by his side a tall, pretty, tender figure of a maid that brought my heart to a stand. I had scarce the time to catch my breath in, and be ready to meet her, as she stepped upon the deck, smiling, and making my best bow, which was now vastly finer than some months before, when first <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> her ladyship. No doubt we were both a good deal changed: she seemed to have shot up taller, like a young, comely tree. She had now a kind of pretty backwardness that became her well, as of one that regarded herself more highly, and was fairly woman; and for another thing, the hand of the same magician had been at work upon the pair of us, and Miss Grant had made us both braw, if she could make but the one bonny.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, {{all that}} WE know--and heaven {{knows what else}} besides!" [...] Then, as she {{released}} me, <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> out <b>to</b> her, <b>made</b> <b>it</b> out perhaps only now with full coherency even to myself. [...] "Two hours ago, in the garden"--I could scarce articulate--"Flora SAW!" ...|$|R

5000|$|Debate ensued {{among some}} critics who felt the three episodes Netflix {{provided}} for review were insufficient. As Hank Stuever {{wrote in his}} review for The Washington Post, [...] "I’ve enjoyed Bloodline so far, but it’s impossible to say if it’s consistently this good, because Netflix would share only three episodes (out of 13) with critics." [...] For HitFix, Alan Sepinwall (who awarded the three episodes a B-) echoed the sentiment, saying, [...] "Well see if they play those time-shifting games to this extent with Bloodline — Todd Kessler has suggested {{to at least one}} reporter that the flash-forwards wont be a series-long (or even season-long) device — but for now, the new show seems more style over substance." [...] He later revised his opinion on the matter, writing that Bloodline ultimately [...] "played fair" [...] with its narrative. He summed up his thoughts on the season in its entirety thusly: [...] "In the end, Mendelsohn was so great that Im glad <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the end, but this one feels better-suited to the anthology miniseries model than as an ongoing." ...|$|E
5000|$|In {{the summer}} of 2009, he took a fiction-writing {{workshop}} led by Gordon Lish. Of the Lish class, Bailey told an interviewer, [...] "The whole concept of the class was basically {{to learn how to}} write a story, period. What this class did was basically strip everything down to the barest essential, which was a sentence. Really, a word, actually, and then a sentence, and then you had to build everything from that first word. The idea was that by the 12th class, {{we would be able to}} have a full story. Very few people made it to a full story. For some, it was really humiliating. ... <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> two and a half pages. It was more than a sentence, but I never finished the story. I was inspired by Lish, but also sort of terrified of him. ... What it taught me, really, was the power of language, thinking of words not so much as a poet but really on a base level, making sure everything you put out there counts." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "I was 14, just {{a little}} older than Bobby. But I knew Uncle Sam needed me, so I lied and signed up. We had beat the Nazzys in Italy, and they shipped me to the Pacific theater. A Tojo torpedo sent our troop ship to the bottom. I could only save three of my buddies: Fatty, Stinky, and Brooklyn. They were kind of like you fellas Bill,, only one of them was from Brooklyn. Out of the sun came a Tojo Zero and put fitty bullets in my back. The blood {{attracted}} sharks. I had to give 'em Fatty. Then things took a turn for the worse. <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> an island, but it was full of Tojos! They were spitting on the U.S. flag! So I rushed 'em, but it was a trap. They opened fire and blew my shins off. Last thing I remember, I beat 'em all to death with a big piece of Fatty. I woke up in a field hospital, and they were sewing my feet to my knees."

6000|$|... "We {{will stand}} or {{fall on the}} same footing, my man," [...] the colonel said, as he walked away, and {{immediately}} I was relieved of duty <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> my business <b>to</b> repeat the conversation to every man I came across.|$|R
60|$|I {{put my hand}} on his shoulder, and I {{guess that}} my voice trembled a trifle as, while reproving him for his act, <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> plain <b>to</b> him that my {{gratitude}} was no less potent a force than his loyalty <b>to</b> me. Then <b>it</b> was that I outlined to him my purpose to defy the regulation that had raised the dead lines, and to take my ship back to New York myself.|$|R
5000|$|Larsen {{said that}} he {{developed}} his philosophical outlook after wandering in Siberia, South America and the United States. [...] "When I was traveling around the country 40 years ago <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> a point <b>to</b> take up a vantage point and greet people." ...|$|R
5000|$|When I {{first started}} off I {{was in the}} human {{interest}} pages of the paper - the fact that I did a sport and the article was about my sport didn't matter - I had a disability and it was warm and fuzzy. It wasn't until <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> where everyone else was, in the sports pages, where any elite athlete deserves to be, that I thought, 'OK they're taking me seriously now, this is good'. Louise Sauvage Sauvage, whose father is from the Seychelles and mother is from Leicestershire, {{was born with a}} severe congenital spinal condition called myelomeningocele, which inhibits the function of {{the lower half of the}} body, giving limited control over the legs. In 1976 she was Perth's Telethon Child as part of a Channel 7 fund-raiser for children with disabilities. She used calipers to help walk until she received her first wheelchair. Her myelomeningocele required her to have 21 surgical operations by the time she was ten years old. As a preteen, Sauvage suffered scoliosis, and at 14, she had surgery to fix a curvature in her spine, using steel rods. The operation was only partially successful, and as an adult, she still has a curve of roughly 49 degrees. [...] She has not had any subsequent surgery to fix the curve in her spine.|$|E
5000|$|The Flag of Argentina {{was created}} by Manuel Belgrano during the Argentine War of Independence. After {{concluding}} the Paraguay campaign, he moved to Rosario to build artilleries. While being in the village he noticed that both the royalist and patriotic forces were using the same colors, Spain's yellow and red. He requested to the First Triumvirate a new cockade, which was approved by a decree on February 18, 1812. The colours of this cockade were white and light blue. Encouraged by this success, he created a flag of the same colours nine days later. The flag was first flown, for the soldiers to swear allegiance to it, on 27 February 1812, on the Batería Libertad (Liberty Battery), by the Paraná River. Although {{it is known that}} this first flag had white and light blue colours, the design is unknown by historians, and could be either a blue-white-blue triband, or white-blue-white. Belgrano {{wrote a letter to the}} Triumvirate to inform it of the new flag, saying that [...] "...being in need to raise a flag, and not having one, <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be done white and light blue according to the colours of the national cockade..."; which did not detail the actual design. Still uninformed of this, the Triumvirate dispatched Belgrano to Salta, to reinforce the Army of the North. This gave room to another unclear detail: whenever Belgrano left the physical flag in Rosario, or took it with him to the North.|$|E

6000|$|And Charles Gould, {{withdrawing}} {{his eyes}} from the wall, said gently, [...] "That Hirsch! What an extraordinary thing! Saved himself by clinging to the anchor, did he?

He came here once {{to talk to me about}} his hide business and some other things. <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> clear <b>to</b> him that nothing could be done." ...|$|R
5000|$|Before the 1920s, Hofmann was {{the strongest}} {{connection}} between German and American eugenicists. World War <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> more difficult <b>to</b> keep up that contact.

60|$|As we {{approached}} the sandy strip <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> out <b>to</b> be {{about half a mile}} long, lying only a few feet above the level of the sea. Hundreds of great, black birds flew out to meet us and sailed over the boat, a sable-winged, hoarse-voiced crowd. When we beached I sprang ashore and ran up the sand to the edge of green. The whole end of the island was white with birds--large, beautiful, snowy birds with shiny black bars across their wings.|$|R
