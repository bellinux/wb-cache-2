The drive shaft broke after one positive stroke which created an interior pressure wave of 162dB. The Concept Design 60-inch was not shown in public after 1998.|$|E

50|$|<b>DC</b> <b>motors</b> {{were the}} first type widely used, since they could be powered from {{existing}} direct-current lighting power distribution systems. A <b>DC</b> <b>motor's</b> speed can be controlled over a wide range, using either a variable supply voltage or by changing the strength of current in its field windings. Small <b>DC</b> <b>motors</b> are used in tools, toys, and appliances. The universal motor can operate on direct current but is a lightweight motor used for portable power tools and appliances. Larger <b>DC</b> <b>motors</b> are used in propulsion of electric vehicles, elevator and hoists, or in drives for steel rolling mills. The advent of power electronics has made replacement of <b>DC</b> <b>motors</b> with AC motors possible in many applications.|$|R

25|$|A commutated <b>DC</b> <b>motor</b> has {{a set of}} {{rotating}} windings {{wound on}} an armature mounted on a rotating shaft. The shaft also carries the commutator, a long-lasting rotary electrical switch that periodically reverses the flow of current in the rotor windings as the shaft rotates. Thus, every brushed <b>DC</b> <b>motor</b> has AC flowing through its rotating windings. Current flows through one or more pairs of brushes that bear on the commutator; the brushes connect an external source of electric power to the rotating armature.|$|E
25|$|A <b>DC</b> <b>motor</b> {{is usually}} {{supplied}} through slip ring commutator as described above. AC motors' commutation {{can be either}} slip ring commutator or externally commutated type, can be fixed-speed or variable-speed control type, and can be synchronous or asynchronous type. Universal motors can run on either AC or DC.|$|E
25|$|Without a {{commutator}} to wear out, {{the life}} of a BLDC motor can be significantly longer compared to a <b>DC</b> <b>motor</b> using brushes and a commutator. Commutation also tends to cause a great deal of electrical and RF noise; without a commutator or brushes, a BLDC motor may be used in electrically sensitive devices like audio equipment or computers.|$|E
25|$|All self-commutated <b>DC</b> <b>motors</b> are by {{definition}} run on DC electric power. Most <b>DC</b> <b>motors</b> are small PM types. They contain a brushed internal mechanical commutation to reverse motor windings' current in synchronism with rotation.|$|R

25|$|Nothing in the {{principle}} {{of any of the}} motors described above requires that the iron (steel) portions of the rotor actually rotate. If the soft magnetic material of the rotor is made {{in the form of a}} cylinder, then (except for the effect of hysteresis) torque is exerted only on the windings of the electromagnets. Taking advantage of this fact is the coreless or ironless <b>DC</b> <b>motor,</b> a specialized form of a PM <b>DC</b> <b>motor.</b> Optimized for rapid acceleration, these motors have a rotor that is constructed without any iron core. The rotor can take the form of a winding-filled cylinder, or a self-supporting structure comprising only the magnet wire and the bonding material. The rotor can fit inside the stator magnets; a magnetically soft stationary cylinder inside the rotor provides a return path for the stator magnetic flux. A second arrangement has the rotor winding basket surrounding the stator magnets. In that design, the rotor fits inside a magnetically soft cylinder that can serve as the housing for the motor, and likewise provides a return path for the flux.|$|E
25|$|Frank J. Sprague {{improved}} on the <b>DC</b> <b>motor</b> in 1884 by {{solving the}} problem of maintaining a constant speed with varying load and reducing sparking from the brushes. Sprague sold his motor through Edison Co. It is easy to vary speed with DC motors, which made them suited {{for a number of}} applications such as electric street railways, machine tools and certain other industrial applications where speed control was desirable.|$|E

25|$|Using {{his newly}} {{developed}} electromagnetic principle, Henry in 1831 created {{one of the}} first machines to use electromagnetism for motion. This was the earliest ancestor of modern <b>DC</b> <b>motor.</b> It did not make use of rotating motion, but was merely an electromagnet perched on a pole, rocking back and forth. The rocking motion was caused by one of the two leads on both ends of the magnet rocker touching one of the two battery cells, causing a polarity change, and rocking the opposite direction until the other two leads hit the other battery.|$|E
25|$|Railways must {{operate at}} {{variable}} speeds. Until the mid 1980s {{this was only}} practical with the brush-type <b>DC</b> <b>motor,</b> although such DC can be supplied from an AC catenary via on-board electric power conversion. Since such conversion was not well developed in the late 19th century and early 20th century, most early electrified railways used DC and many still do, particularly rapid transit (subways) and trams. Speed was controlled by connecting the traction motors in various series-parallel combinations, by varying the traction motors' fields, and by inserting and removing starting resistances to limit motor current.|$|E
25|$|Large brushes are desired for {{a larger}} brush contact area to {{maximize}} motor output, but small brushes are desired for low mass to maximize {{the speed at which}} the motor can run without the brushes excessively bouncing and sparking. (Small brushes are also desirable for lower cost.) Stiffer brush springs {{can also be used to}} make brushes of a given mass work at a higher speed, but at the cost of greater friction losses (lower efficiency) and accelerated brush and commutator wear. Therefore, <b>DC</b> <b>motor</b> brush design entails a trade-off between output power, speed, and efficiency/wear.|$|E
50|$|Brushless <b>DC</b> <b>motors</b> {{are widely}} used as servomotors for machine tool servo drives. Servomotors are used for {{mechanical}} displacement, positioning or precision motion control. In the past <b>DC</b> stepper <b>motors</b> were used as servomotors; however, since they are operated with open loop control, they typically exhibit torque pulsations. Brushless <b>DC</b> <b>motors</b> are more suitable as servomotors since their precise motion is based upon a closed loop control system that provides tightly controlled and stable operation.|$|R

More recent electric vehicles have made use of a variety of AC motor types, as these are simpler to build and have no brushes that can wear out. These are usually induction motors or brushless AC electric motors which use permanent magnets. There are several variations of the permanent magnet motor which offer simpler drive schemes and/or lower cost including the brushless <b>DC</b> electric <b>motor.</b>|$|R

25|$|Because {{the rotor}} is much lighter in weight (mass) than a {{conventional}} rotor formed from copper windings on steel laminations, the rotor can accelerate much more rapidly, often achieving a mechanical time constant under one ms. This {{is especially true}} if the windings use aluminum rather than the heavier copper. But {{because there is no}} metal mass in the rotor to act as a heat sink, even small coreless motors must often be cooled by forced air. Overheating might be an issue for coreless <b>DC</b> <b>motor</b> designs. Modern software, such as Motor-CAD, can help to increase the thermal efficiency of motors while still in the design stage.|$|E
25|$|Newman's Energy Machine was a <b>DC</b> <b>motor</b> {{which the}} inventor, Joseph Newman, claimed to produce {{mechanical}} power exceeding the electrical power being supplied to it (an over-unity or perpetual motion device). In 1979, Newman attempted to patent the device, but {{was rejected by}} the United States Patent Office. When the rejection was later appealed, the United States district court requested that Newman's machine be tested by the National Bureau of Standards (NBS). The NBS concluded in June 1986 that output power was not greater than the input, and it was not a perpetual motion machine. Thus, the patent was again denied. The scientific community has rejected Newman's ideas about electricity and magnetism as pseudoscientific and his claims as false.|$|E
25|$|The Cable Car has two cars, which {{start from}} {{opposite}} ends of the line and pass in the middle.

A 185kW 550V <b>DC</b> <b>motor</b> at the top of the hill drives the pulley. The Cable Car is a funicular rather than a true cable car: the cars are permanently attached to the cable, which stops and starts as required, while a cable car grips and releases a continuously-moving cable. Wheels on the south side of car 1 and the north side of car 2 have double flanges, while the opposite wheels on each car have no flanges, directing the cars to the correct side of the mid-way passing loop at Talavera.|$|E

25|$|Many of the {{limitations}} of the classic commutator <b>DC</b> <b>motor</b> are due to the need for brushes to press against the commutator. This creates friction. Sparks are created by the brushes making and breaking circuits through the rotor coils as the brushes cross the insulating gaps between commutator sections. Depending on the commutator design, this may include the brushes shorting together adjacent sections – and hence coil ends – momentarily while crossing the gaps. Furthermore, the inductance of the rotor coils causes the voltage across each to rise when its circuit is opened, increasing the sparking of the brushes. This sparking limits the maximum speed of the machine, as too-rapid sparking will overheat, erode, or even melt the commutator. The current density per unit area of the brushes, in combination with their resistivity, limits the output of the motor. The making and breaking of electric contact also generates electrical noise; sparking generates RFI. Brushes eventually wear out and require replacement, and the commutator itself is subject to wear and maintenance (on larger motors) or replacement (on small motors). The commutator assembly on a large motor is a costly element, requiring precision assembly of many parts. On small motors, the commutator is usually permanently integrated into the rotor, so replacing it usually requires replacing the whole rotor.|$|E
