Returning home in the morning of the following day from a night time recording session with The Beach Boys, Wilson was unexpectedly greeted in the driveway of the residence by the Family's leader, Charles Manson. At first, Wilson was frightened by Manson, but Manson assured him <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>with</b> no intent to harm Wilson and began kissing his shoes. The two struck a friendship and, over the next few months, members of the Manson Familymostly women who were treated as servantswere housed at Wilson's Sunset Boulevard household, reportedly costing him approximately $100,000 (U.S.).|$|E

25|$|In early 1962, Mangeshkar {{was given}} slow poison. A doctor was called. <b>He</b> <b>came</b> <b>with</b> an x-ray machine to examine her, {{and gave her}} an {{injection}} to render her unconscious, because she was in pain. For three days, she had a close brush with death. After ten days, she began to recover. The doctor told her that somebody had given her slow poison. The slow poison incident rendered her very weak. She was bedridden for nearly 3 months. The most surprising thing was that soon after the incident, the cook {{who used to work}} at Lataji's home, suddenly vanished without taking his wages. The cook had earlier worked with some Bollywood people. Bollywood lyricist Majrooh Sultanpuri used to regularly visit Lataji at her home daily at 6 pm. Majrooh used to first taste the food and then allow Lata to eat. He used to recite poems and stories to keep Lata in good humour.|$|E
25|$|Pōtatau was {{installed}} as King at Rangiaowhia in 1858, after which {{it became a}} target for government control. To guard against this the roads to Rangiaowhia were defended by new pas at Paterangi and Rangiatea (near Te Rahu, north of Te Awamutu). However, General Cameron, in his Invasion of the Waikato, avoided them by taking nearly 1,000 troops overnight from Te Rore via Waiari, just avoiding Paterangi to the north, and Te Awamutu. There were about 200 of Ngati-Apakura and Ngati-Hinetu at Rangiaowhia, supplying food to the garrisons at the pas. At dawn on 21 February 1864 the troops attacked. Most people fled, a few shot at the troops, some sheltered in the churches, 7 were burnt in their whare {{and at least one}} attempted to surrender, but was murdered by troops ignoring their orders. About a dozen houses were burned down. 12 Māori were killed and over 30 taken prisoner. As the village was largely occupied by women, children and older men, the deaths have been regarded as murder, rather than an act of war. The role of Bishop Selwyn is also unclear. <b>He</b> <b>came</b> <b>with</b> the invading forces, but also helped with Māori burials.|$|E

25|$|The main feud {{heading into}} Survivor Series {{included}} André the Giant, One Man Gang, King Kong Bundy, Butch Reed and Rick Rude against Hulk Hogan, Paul Orndorff, Don Muraco, Ken Patera and Bam Bam Bigelow. In January 1987, Hogan {{was awarded a}} trophy for his third year as WWF World Heavyweight Champion while Hogan's best friend André was awarded a smaller trophy than Hogan's, for being undefeated in WWF for 15 years. Hogan congratulated his friend and said that André was the real champion of superstars all around the world. André surprisingly left the place before Hogan could even finish. In February, <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>with</b> a new manager Bobby Heenan. When Hogan came to know about that, he begged André not to keep Heenan as his manager because Heenan was Hogan's longtime enemy. André {{said that he had}} come to challenge Hogan for the WWF World Heavyweight Title at WrestleMania. He ripped off Hogan's Hulkamania shirt and golden chain, turning heel. This culminated in their historic match at WrestleMania III, where Hogan defeated André to retain the title. During the match, he set a record by scoop slamming the 520-pound Frenchman. On August 22, 1987 edition of Prime Time Wrestling, Paul Orndorff fired Bobby Heenan as his manager when he came to know that Heenan had brought in a new wrestler Rick Rude to replace Orndorff. Orndorff appointed Oliver Humperdink as his manager to feud with Rude. Superstar Billy Graham got involved in a feud with Butch Reed, culminating in a match between the duo. One Man Gang interfered in a match where he hit Graham with a big splash on the concrete floor. Don Muraco came to the rescue of Graham and Graham who was scheduled to participate in the main event of the first-ever Survivor Series retired due to an attack by One Man Gang. Muraco replaced him. Ken Patera got involved in a feud with Bobby Heenan and The Heenan Family and turned babyface, and was chosen to be the fourth member on Hogan's team. Many heel managers wanted to manage Bam Bam Bigelow, but Bigelow chose Oliver Humperdink as his manager thus making his WWF debut as a babyface. He also became a part of Hogan's team.|$|E

As time passed, talk of the ancient invasion began to dwindle, though stories of demonic weaponry such as [...] "ARMs" [...] and robotic soldiers still persisted in the minds of many. When a mysterious child named Rudy drifted into the small town of Surf, <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>with</b> an ARM at his side.

2500|$|According to Adventist {{historian}} George Knight, most early Adventists (until 1950) {{believed that}} Jesus Christ {{was born with}} a human nature that was not only physically frail and subject to temptation, but that he also had the fallen predisposition and inclination to sin. Since 1950, the [...] "historic" [...] wing of the church continues to hold this fallen view of Christ's human nature. Mainstream Adventist hold to the belief taught by Ellen White that <b>He</b> <b>came</b> <b>with</b> the effects of Adam’s sin deep within his nature, that Christ took on the fallen nature but not the sinfulness of man.|$|E

When Balachander is said to have narrated the situation to him that Sindhu sings a folk song and most unexpectedly switches to a carnatic tune. Within 24 hours <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>with</b> up the song which became the biggest controversy in his career, he faced staunch opposition from certain classical musicians for having changed the original raga from Khamboji to Saramati ...|$|E

2500|$|While Bouzes {{probably}} {{served under}} Belisarius in this campaign, his specific activities are not mentioned. The Byzantine invasion force failed to capture Nisibis, {{though they did}} capture Sisauranon. In the campaign season of 542, Khosrau I once again invaded Byzantine-held areas. Bouzes, Justus and others retreated {{within the walls of}} Hierapolis. He was one of the co-writers of a letter asking Belisarius to join them there. Belisarius instead moved towards Europum, summoning the other leaders there. Procopius narrates: [...] "At the opening of spring Chosroes, the son of Cabades, for the third time began an invasion into the land of the Romans with a mighty army, keeping the River Euphrates on the right. ... The Emperor Justinian, upon learning of the inroad of the Persians, again sent Belisarius against them. And <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>with</b> great speed to Euphratesia since he had no army with him, riding on the government post-horses, which they are accustomed to call [...] "veredi," [...] while Justus, the nephew of the emperor, together with Bouzes and certain others, was in Hierapolis where he had fled for refuge." ...|$|E
