5|$|Located at the {{junction}} of Sungei Road and Pitt Road, was the former site of the Singapore Ice Works that {{was built in the}} 1930s. The factory was the first <b>ice-making</b> <b>plant</b> in Singapore using large compressors manufactured mainly from Carrier and York corporations. It was popular as a pioneer establishment that brought refrigeration and air-conditioning to Singapore. In 1958, it was renamed as the New Singapore Ice Works. In later years, the factory was bought over by Cold Storage who ran it under their management. However, in 1984, the Housing Development Board (HDB) took over its site for redevelopment. The factory was soon demolished and the plant operations was re-located to Auric Pacific at Fishery Port Road. This facility has since closed down after being in use for over twenty years.|$|E
50|$|The Arena Rink Company {{installed}} an <b>ice-making</b> <b>plant</b> {{shortly after}} taking ownership to lengthen the hockey and skating season. In August 1937 Newfoundland's first artificial ice surface was tested.|$|E
5000|$|In 1906, d' Angeli founded [...] "Hotel d'Angeli's" [...] at the Anna statue junction, where Blacker's Road meets Mount Road. The {{hotel was}} the first in Madras to have an {{electric}} lift, hot water taps, electric fans, imported tiles, <b>ice-making</b> <b>plant</b> and cold storage.|$|E
50|$|Air {{conditioning}} for {{the buildings}} {{is provided by}} three <b>ice-making</b> <b>plants,</b> one for each grade level's section. The units freeze and accumulate ice at night when electricity is cheaper, and allow the ice to melt during the day to cool the air.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{ascertain}} the economic implications of fish landings for the national economy. The study area was stratified with a frame survey into two principal sampling units (PSU) corresponding to the two fishing communities (Ayadehe and Oku Iboku in Itu Local Government Area). Each PSU was assessed for 28 - 31 days per month for seven months. The landings of 36 fishermen operating in the two fishing communities were randomly sampled. Personal interview and complete enumeration were instruments for data collection. The data collected were analyzed statistically with chi-squared at 5 % significance level. The findings revealed that the fishermen were faced with numerous problems. However, it was recommended among others that the provisions of cold storage facilities, <b>ice-making</b> <b>plants,</b> landing jetties, fish processing sheds, more fishing crafts, etc would boost fishing activities and catch landings in the study area...|$|R
50|$|Soon afterwards, {{they were}} {{employed}} by the Raja of Ramnad to electrify his palace and set up an <b>ice-making</b> <b>plant.</b> This was a success and shortly afterwards, they were working to electrify the city of Devakottai in the Chettinad region and Hindu temples all way from Madurai to Rameswaram.|$|E
50|$|After {{passenger}} service ceased, {{the line}} was used for light freight delivery only. Car storage was no longer needed and Southern Pacific Railroad leased the land to various companies for light manufacturing. Warehouse buildings were constructed and housed a celery packing operation, then an <b>ice-making</b> <b>plant,</b> and finally, the manufacturing home base for American Appliance water heaters.|$|E
50|$|Herbie, his parents, and his thirteen-year-old sister, Felicia, {{dwell in}} an aging Homer Avenue {{apartment}} house. Jacob Bookbinder is founder and {{part owner of}} an industrial <b>ice-making</b> <b>plant,</b> known to Herbie and his cousin Cliff Block as The Place, a location that plays both {{a significant role in}} Herbie's fate and an adult sub-plot that frames the climax of the story.|$|E
50|$|The Casino had {{installed}} an artificial <b>ice-making</b> <b>plant</b> in 1895 and the 1895-96 winter season {{saw the first}} introduction of hockey at the rink. Challenge exhibition matches of ice polo between the Canadian Queen's University of Kingston, Ontario, and Western University of Pennsylvania were held at the rink, and Queen's demonstrated the game of ice hockey. Between then and November 1896, the Casino management decided to organize two leagues at the rink; an inter-scholastic league for high schools, and a senior league. Both leagues were amateur. The senior league was named the Western Pennsylvania League.|$|E
50|$|A {{fire started}} in the <b>ice-making</b> <b>plant</b> causing the arena to burn down on January 2, 1918. It began mid-day, when {{the only people in}} the {{building}} were the superintendent James McKeene and his family, eating in their apartment {{on the north side of}} the structure; all escaped safely but they lost most of their belongings, as well as a car stored in the annex. Damage was estimated at $150,000, including the uniforms and sticks of the Wanderers and Canadiens, with only 1/3 covered by insurance. The blaze led the Montreal Wanderers, already on shaky grounds, to disband within days and the Canadiens to move back to Jubilee Arena (it too would be destroyed by fire, the next year). In 1924, the new Montreal Forum was built one block to the east.|$|E

5000|$|The {{ice rink}} ends were not squared-off, but rounded-off. The ends were {{somewhat}} semi-circular, possibly the first design of its kind. A puck could be shot along the outside rim, slide along the corners, pass behind the goal {{and come out}} the other side. This type of shot is common in hockey today, and is called [...] "rimmed around." [...] The rounded-corners design spread to other arenas. In 1902, after Ottawa's Dey Rink was demolished due to a storm, it was rebuilt with rounded ends to match the Montreal Arena. The fence along the ice surface was increased in height to 4 ft, an increase from the Victoria Skating Rink's one foot high boards. The first artificial <b>ice-making</b> <b>plant</b> in Montreal was installed in the Arena in 1915.|$|E
50|$|Leverhulme's {{plan was}} to build an <b>ice-making</b> <b>plant</b> in Stornoway, {{building}} refrigerated cargo ships to take fish to a depot at Fleetwood, where he would build herring-curing facilities, a canning factory and a plant installed to make fish cakes, fish paste, glue, animal feed and fertiliser. To create a market for the fish, he started buying up independent fishmongers throughout Britain, rebranding them Mac Fisheries. But in 1919, servicemen demobilised from World War I and promised land, started occupying plots on the Isle of Lewis. Leverhulme protested and took legal action against the people he considered squatters, but the Scottish Office took {{the side of the}} ex-servicemen, leaving Leverhulme's plan in tatters. Leverhulme announced that he would leave Lewis in 1923, offering to gift the Isle to the locals. But suspicion ran so high, that he was forced to sell again to long-term absentee landlords.|$|E
50|$|Zamboni {{was born}} in 1901 in Eureka, Utah, to Italian immigrants. His parents soon bought a farm in Lava Hot Springs near Pocatello, Idaho, where he grew up. In 1920, he moved with his parents to the harbor {{district}} of Los Angeles, where his older brother George was operating an auto repair shop. After Frank attended a trade school in Chicago, he {{and his younger brother}} Lawrence opened an electrical supply business in 1922 in the Los Angeles suburb of Hynes (now part of Paramount). The following year he married and eventually had three children, a son and two daughters. In 1927, he and Lawrence added an <b>ice-making</b> <b>plant</b> and entered the block ice business. They continued their ice business in 1939, but saw little future in that business with the advent of electrically operated refrigeration units. They decided to use their excess refrigeration equipment to open an ice rink nearby.|$|E
50|$|In 1895, Pittsburgh officials, {{constructed}} the Schenley Park Casino which featured the first artificial <b>ice-making</b> <b>plant</b> in North America. The 1895-96 winter season {{also saw the}} first introduction of hockey in the city. On December 30, 1895, the Pittsburgh Press made mention of a “great international hockey and polo tournament” opening game at the Casino. The newspaper reported that a team consisting of ten players from Queen's University played against a group of local players from Western University (today the University of Pittsburgh) and Pittsburgh Catholic College of the Holy Ghost (today Duquesne University) and a half-hour of exhibition of hockey was played before the polo match. The paper noted that 2,500 to 3,000 fans showed up to watch the game, despite claims of bad weather. No score or records were reportedly kept but the paper did note that the team from Queen's University outplayed the Pittsburghers, who had never played the game before.|$|E
50|$|The ton of {{refrigeration}} {{is equivalent}} to the consumption of one ton of ice per day and originated during the transition from stored natural ice to mechanical refrigeration. Just as horsepower and candlepower were intuitive units of measure for people living through the transition from horse to motorized transport and from flame-based to electric lighting, so was the ton of refrigeration an intuitive unit of measure during a technological change, as the ice trade gradually adopted ever more artificial ice (ice from <b>ice-making</b> <b>plant)</b> in addition to its natural ice supplies. The TR unit was developed during the 1880s. Its definition was set at the level of an industry standard in 1903, when Thomas Shipley of the York Manufacturing Company led the formation of an industry association (the Ice Machine Builders Association of the United States) along with standardization of several equipment specifications. In 1904 these efforts led to the founding of the American Society of Refrigerating Engineers (ASRE), {{which was one of the}} predecessors of ASHRAE.|$|E
5000|$|In 1906, Perry {{built his}} Perry Mansion {{based on the}} Moorish {{architecture}} from his visit to Almadén. The two story structure had nine bedrooms, a wine cellar, nine 10-foot arches, and a 90-foot front porch. By 1913, Perry had installed in Terlingua the Chisos Hotel, a [...] "Company Store", an <b>ice-making</b> <b>plant,</b> telephone service, a company doctor, and mail delivery three times a week. By 1936, he had installed the Chisos Theatre and the Oasis Confectionery Shop. His mainly Mexican miners were provided rent-free dwellings. Perry joined the New York Yacht Club in 1920. He remained a member until 1944, owning during that time three different yachts, none smaller than 59 feet. In Perry's words, [...] "If he had not wanted the yachts, {{he would not have}} made so much money, which he had {{to do in order to}} have them." [...] As a consequence, Terlingua became the [...] "Land of Perry", where he controlled all aspects of life.|$|E
40|$|Although {{comparisons}} of relative {{energy efficiency and}} cost effectiveness for small gas and mechanically pumped liquid overfeed refrigeration systems (arrangements) have been performed, no such comparison has been reported for large batch type ice-making systems. The <b>ice-making</b> <b>plant</b> at the Far East Vertical Shaft, East Rand Proprietary Mines (ERPM) Ltd, South Africa, which produced ice in a batch-type process for cooling its underground workings, utilizes cold flash gas to pump liquid refrigerant to and through its ice-building evaporators. Each of this plant’s three operating units manufactured up to 1000 tons of ice per day to adequately cool this gold mine’s underground workings. For one unit of this plant, this investigation models {{the functioning of the}} existing ‘cold gas’ pumping arrangement, supported by test data. It then investigates, through similar modelling, a more conventional ‘hot gas’ pumping arrangement, and two possible mechanically pumped arrangements for this unit, functioning under similar conditions. The models provide a thermodynamically meaningful comparison of the different liquid overfeed refrigerant pumping arrangements, principally in terms of their energy efficiency and electrical cost effectiveness. They predict that under similar operating conditions, the current cold gas pumping arrangement is more energy efficient and electrically cost effective than both hot gas and conventionally mechanically pumped arrangements. This agrees with the suggestions and conclusions of previous investigations performed on smaller refrigeration systems. However, compared to a theoretical fully mechanically pumped arrangement, the existing cold gas pumped system is predicted to incur larger unproductive refrigeration demand and higher annual electrical operating cost...|$|E
