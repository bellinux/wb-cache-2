The experimental study is done based on theoretical considerations of the membrane characteristics. Through a broad screening of dense symmetric homo- and copolymers with different functional groups, the intrinsic properties such as the mobility or the transport of gases through the matrix were examined in detail. A subset of application-relevant gases was chosen for the experimental part of the study: H 2, CH 4, CO, CO 2, NO 2, ethanol, acetone, acetaldehyde, and water vapor.

Mycotoxins are agricultural contaminants of fungal origin occurring at all latitudes worldwide and being characterized by acute and chronic effects on human health and animal wellness, depending on the species sensitivity. The major mycotoxins of food concern are aflatoxin B 1 and ochratoxin A, the first for its toxicity, and the second for its recurrent occurrence.

The deposition target for 2010 from the NMP 3 will not be realized.

The mass transport of polar and non-polar gases through a polymer membrane matrix was studied by systematic selection of polymers with different degrees of fluorination, as well as polymers whose monomers have ether groups (-O-) in addition to fluorine groups (-F). For the study, a set of application-relevant gases including H 2, CO, CO 2, NO 2, methane, ethanol, acetone, and acetaldehyde as well as various concentrations of relative humidity were used. These gases have different functional groups and polarities, yet have a similar kinetic diameter and are therefore typically difficult to separate. The concentrations of the gases were chosen according to international <b>indicative</b> <b>limit</b> values (TWA, STEL). To measure the concentration in the feed and permeate, we used tin-dioxide-based metal oxide gas sensors with palladium catalyst (SnO 2 :Pd), catalytic sensors (also SnO 2 :Pd-based) and thermal conductivity sensors. This allows a close examination of the interdependence of diffusion and physicochemical operating principle of the sensor. Our goal {{is to increase the}} selectivity of gas sensors by using inexpensive fluoropolymer membranes. The measurements showed that through membranes with low polarity, preferably non-polar gases are transported.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a new methodology for setting harmonic limits in power systems. This approach {{is designed to}} replace the existing harmonic limits detailed in IEC 61000. 3. 6 and IEEE 519. The methodology provides for replacing the ~ 40 or more individual harmonic with three new limits. The new limits are low frequency weighed VTHD, high frequency weighed VTHD and the even harmonic components of VTHD. It is proposed to keep the VTHD limit to make {{a total of four}} limits. The four limit types have been selected because they each correspond directly to known critical physical effects on customer equipment and network components that need to be managed. The low frequency weighed VTHD limit is used to restrict harmonic losses in induction motors. The high frequency weighed VTHD is used to restrict harmonic heating in capacitors. VTHD is used to ensure the peak of the voltage waveforms is neither too low nor too high. Even VTHD is used to ensure voltage waveform symmetry and the control of DC currents. Providing a physical basis {{for each of the four}} limits removes much of the arbitrariness of the existing IEC 61000. 3. 6 and IEEE 519 limits.

To protect consumers’ health, <b>indicative</b> <b>limits</b> for T- 2 /HT- 2 and maximum limits for OTA have been set by the European Commission, requiring food business operators and controlling agencies to conduct routine checks {{for the presence of}} these harmful contaminants. Screening methods are increasingly used for monitoring purposes. Due to the demand for new and improved screening tools, two individual detection methods, T- 2 /HT- 2 and OTA enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), were developed in this study. The T- 2 /HT- 2 ELISA was based on a T- 2 monoclonal antibody with an IC 50 (50 % inhibitory concentration) of 0. 28 ng/mL and 125 % cross-reactivity with HT- 2. As regards the OTA ELISA, a new sensitive monoclonal antibody specific to OTA with an IC 50 of 0. 13 ng/mL was produced. Both developed ELISA tests were then validated in agricultural commodities in accordance with the new performance criteria guidelines for the validation of screening methods for mycotoxins included in Commission Regulation (EU) No 519 / 2014. The T- 2 /HT- 2 ELISA was demonstrated to be suitable for the detection of T- 2 /HT- 2 in cereals and baby food at and above the screening target concentration (STC) of 12. 5 μg/kg and 7. 5 μg/kg, respectively.

By adding the primary particulate contribution from typical urban roads and including a margin for error, it is concluded that the current <b>indicative</b> <b>limit</b> value for PM 2. 5 will largely be met in 2020 assuming 2006 meteorological conditions. Contributions to annual average regional PM 2. 5 concentration from wild fires in Europe in 2006 and from possible climate change between 2006 and 2020 are shown to be small compared with the change in PM 2. 5 concentration arising from changes in emissions between 2006 and 2020. The contribution from emissions from major industrial sources regulated in the UK is estimated from additional CMAQ calculations. The potential source strength of these emissions is a useful indicator of the linearity of the response of the atmosphere to changes in emissions. Uncertainties in the modelling of regional and local sources are taken into account based on previous evaluations of the models. Future actual trends in emissions mean that exceedences of limit values may arise, and these and further research into PM 2. 5 health effects will need {{to be part of the}} future strategy to manage PM 2. 5 concentration...|$|E

Furthermore, infection by parasites might be associated with considerable deterioration of individual host fitness.

We assessed the effect of Hepatozoon parasites on Podarcis vaucheri flight-initiation distance from a simulated predator, a behaviour that is determinant for a successful escape and is therefore likely to have major implications on a lizard’s survival. We found that flight-initiation distance was not dependent on the time of the day or tail condition.

The Carboniferous and Permian rugose corals of the Cordilleran-Arctic-Uralian (C-A-U) Realm, belong to the best known group of animals of those periods. Spitsbergen, situated at that time on the northern margin of the drifting supercontinent Pangea, stands out from the entire C-A-U Realm for its exceptionally large accumulation of their fossils. The climate obtaining in the Carboniferous and Early Permian was favourable to their development. At that time today’s Svalbard Archipelago lay roughly just above the Tropic of Cancer and in those periods and later kept moving northwards until it had reached its present location between the 75 th and 80 th parallels in the northern subpolar zone. The corals described in this monograph come from three areas: the Hornsund region, a Polakkfjellet hill, and the Grønfjorden region. They belong to both, known and new species.

40|$|Early {{embryonic}} {{development in}} Xenopus laevis {{is characterized by}} transcriptional repression which is relieved at the midblastula stage (MBT). Here we show that the relative abundance of TATA-binding protein (TBP) increases robustly at the MBT and that the mechanism underlying this increase is translation of maternally stored TBP RNA. We show that TBP is rate-limiting in egg extract under conditions that titrate nucleosome assembly. Precocious translation of TBP mRNA in Xenopus embryos facilitates transcription before the MBT, without requiring TBP to be prebound to the promoter before injection. This effect is transient {{in the absence of}} chromatin titration and is sustained when chromatin is titrated. These data show that translational regulation of TBP RNA contributes to limitations on the transcriptional capacity before the MBT. Second, we examined the ability of trans-acting factors to contribute to promoter activity before the MBT. Deletion of cis-acting elements does not affect histone H 2 B transcription in egg extract, a finding <b>indicative</b> of <b>limited</b> trans-activation. Moreover, {{in the context of the}} intact promoter, neither the transcriptional activator Oct- 1, nor TBP, nor TFIID enable transcriptional activation in vitro. HeLa cell extract, however, reconstitutes activated transcription in mixed extracts. These data suggest a deficiency in egg extract cofactors required for activated transcription. We show that the capacity for activated H 2 B transcription is gradually acquired at the early gastrula transition. This transition occurs well after the blastula stage when the basal transcription machinery can first be complemented with TBP...|$|R
40|$|Recombination in {{microcrystalline}} silicon c Si H pin {{solar cells}} is studied by electrically detected magnetic resonance EDMR. The EDMR {{response of the}} pin cell under illumination shows a quenching resonance with identical line shape as found in undoped films with coplanar contact geometry even though the current path is perpendicular and parallel to the growth direction, respectively. At room temperature only a single line at g amp; 8776; 2. 005 dominates. This line also appears in the dark forward current, however, with opposite sign. It is assigned to a direct capture recombination at neutral dangling bonds db in the space charge region. At a bias above 0. 6 V, however, the EDMR signal disappears. This behavior is <b>indicative</b> of diffusion <b>limited</b> charge collection as is known from EDMR studies of c Si pn solar cells and can be quantitatively described with a simple diffusion model that was developed for EDMR of crystalline silicon pn junction...|$|R
40|$|Major {{environmental}} {{events that}} fragment populations among multiple island habitats have potential to drive large-scale episodes of speciation and adaptive radiation. A recent palaeolimnological study of sediment cores indicated that Lake Malawi underwent major climate-driven desiccation events 75 000 - 135 000 {{years ago that}} lowered the water level to at least 580 m below the present state and severely reduced surface area. After this period, lake levels rose and stabilized, creating multiple discontinuous littoral rocky habitats. Here, we present evidence supporting the hypothesis that establishment and expansion of isolated philopatric rock cichlid populations occurred after this rise and stabilization of lake level. We studied the Pseudotropheus (Maylandia) species complex, a group with both allopatric and sympatric populations that differ in male nuptial colour traits and tend to mate assortatively. Using coalescent analyses based on mitochondrial DNA, we found evidence that populations throughout the lake started to expand and accumulate genetic diversity after the lake level rise. Moreover, most haplotypes were geographically restricted, and the greatest genetic similarities were typically among sympatric or neighbouring populations. This is <b>indicative</b> of <b>limited</b> dispersal and establishment of assortative mating among populations following the lake level rise. Together, this evidence is compatible with a single large-scale environmental event being central to evolution of spatial patterns of genetic and species diversity in P. (Maylandia) and perhaps other Lake Malawi rock cichlids. Equivalent climate-driven pulses of habitat formation and fragmentation may similarly have contributed to observed rapid and punctuated cladogenesis in other adaptive radiations...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} years several {{communications}} to the Rapid Alarm System for non food products (RAPEX) were issued 1 concerning the presence of cyclohexanone in stink blasters (toys emitting characteristic smell after squeezing) and its possible impact on human health. The scope {{of the present study}} was to identify and quantify the emission of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from this kind of toys and to evaluate possible health risks, in particular for children. Although the stink blasters are intended for outdoor use, a hypothetical indoor use (e. g. use by children in closed environments) has been considered relevant for exposure assessment studies. Specimens for testing were bought in a local market and are similar to the products mentioned in the RAPEX notification. The toys analyzed (following extraction with methanol) contain less than 0. 2 % by weight of cyclohexanone. Cyclohexanone was found in the sponge and the head of the toy (causing the characteristic smell, when squeezed) but also in the body. In addition to these preliminary experiments and in order to evaluate air exposure to cyclohexanone, the stink blasters were placed in the Indoortron facility, a walk-in type environmental chamber of 30 m 3 volume featuring automatic control of parameters such as temperature (T), relative humidity (RH) and air change rates (ach), and tested for emissions after squeezing several times under ¿real world setting¿ conditions (22 C, 50 % RH, 0. 5 ach). By this, the main compounds emitted were cyclohexanone and toluene with concentrations reaching values to 25 ug/m 3 and 32 ug/m 3 respectively. These concentrations are much lower than the <b>indicative</b> occupational exposure <b>limit</b> values of 40 mg/m 3 for cyclohexanone and 192 mg/m 3 for toluene 2. However, within the frame of this study it is not possible to evaluate possible health effects, which might be expected from a chronic exposure to the aforementioned chemicals at low doses.

40|$|A tidally and cross-sectionally {{averaged}} model {{based on}} the temporal evolution of the quasi-steady Hansen and Rattray equations is applied to simulate the salinity distribution and vertical exchange flow along the Hudson River estuary. The model achieves high skill at hindcasting salinity and residual velocity variation during a 110 -day period in 2004 covering {{a wide range of}} river discharges and tidal forcing. The approach is based on an existing model framework that has been modified to improve model skill relative to observations. The external forcing has been modified to capture meteorological time-scale variability in salinity, stratification, and residual velocity due to sea level fluctuations at the open boundary and along-estuary wind stress. To reflect changes in vertical mixing due to stratification, the vertical mixing coefficients have been modified to use the bottom boundary layer height rather than the water depth as an effective mixing length scale. The boundary layer parameterization depends on the tidal amplitude and the local baroclinic pressure gradient through the longitudinal Richardson number, and improves the model response to spring–neap variability in tidal amplitude during periods of high river discharge. Finally, steady-state model solutions are evaluated for both the Hudson River and northern San Francisco Bay over a range of forcing conditions. Agreement between the model and scaling of equilibrium salinity intrusions lends confidence that the approach is transferable to other estuaries, despite significant differences in bathymetry. Discrepancies between the model results and observations at high river discharge are <b>indicative</b> of <b>limits</b> at which the formulation begins to fail, and where an alternative approach that captures two-layer dynamics would be more appropriate...|$|R
