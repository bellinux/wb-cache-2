5|$|Gonopods {{occur in}} a {{diversity}} of shapes and sizes, and {{in the range from}} closely resembling walking legs to complex structures quite unlike legs at all. In some groups, the gonopods are kept retracted within the body; in others they project forward parallel to the body. Gonopod morphology is the predominant means of determining species among millipedes: the structures may differ greatly between closely related species but very little within a species. The gonopods develop gradually <b>from</b> <b>walking</b> legs through successive moults until reproductive maturity.|$|E
5|$|In the station, Dive Coasters {{that use}} non-floorless trains simply use a {{standard}} station. With Dive Coasters that use floorless trains, {{in order to}} allow riders to load and unload the train, a movable floor is necessary. Because the front row has nothing in front of it to stop riders <b>from</b> <b>walking</b> {{over the edge of the}} station, a gate is placed in front of the train to prevent this from happening. Once all the over-the-shoulder restraints are locked, the gate opens and the floor separates into several pieces and moves underneath the station. When the next train enters the station, the gate is closed and the floors are brought back up where the next riders board.|$|E

5|$|Sometimes trace fossils {{have been}} {{referred}} to Megalosaurus or to the ichnogenus Megalosauripus. In 1997, a famous group of fossilised footprints (ichnites) {{was found in a}} limestone quarry at Ardley, twenty kilometres northeast of Oxford. They were thought to have been made by Megalosaurus and possibly also some left by Cetiosaurus. There are replicas of some of these footprints, set across the lawn of the Oxford University Museum of Natural History. One track was of a theropod accelerating <b>from</b> <b>walking</b> to running. According to Benson, such referrals are unprovable, as the tracks show no traits unique to Megalosaurus. Certainly they should be limited to finds that are of the same age as Megalosaurus bucklandii.|$|E
5|$|These {{findings}} were later supported by chromatographic analysis of flavonoid compounds. Chromatograms of A.bradleyi showed {{a combination of}} all the compounds found in A.montanum and all those in A.platyneuron. A.×wherryi showed the same pattern, as it also contains chromosomes from both of those species. A specimen of A.stotleri was subsequently shown to form the same chromatograms as well. This showed that it was not descended to A.pinnatifidum, whose chromatograms contain compounds inherited <b>from</b> <b>walking</b> fern (A.rhizophyllum), and verified that A.stotleri was simply a form of A.bradleyi. Allozyme analysis in the 1980s also supported these hybrid origins of A.bradleyi.|$|E
5|$|The {{design of}} a Floorless Coaster has one main {{difference}} from traditional steel roller coasters around the world: it has no floors between the seats. While a train is in the station, a floor is used only for loading and unloading purposes. Because the front row has nothing {{in front of it}} to stop riders <b>from</b> <b>walking</b> {{over the edge of the}} station, a gate is placed in front of the train to prevent this from happening. Once all the over-the-shoulder restraints are locked, the floor separates into several pieces and moves underneath the station. The gate then opens, allowing the train to move forward. When the train returns to the station, the floor is brought back up and the gate is closed as the next riders board the roller coaster. Aside from the station, a Floorless Coaster has several inversions similar to B's Sitting Coasters.|$|E

5|$|Two thick {{folds of}} skin {{encircle}} the body {{behind the front}} legs and before the hind legs. The rhino has a smaller fold of skin around its neck. The skin itself is thin, , and in the wild, the rhino appears to have no subcutaneous fat. Hair can range from dense (the most dense hair in young calves) to scarce, and is usually a reddish brown. In the wild, this hair is hard to observe because the rhinos are often covered in mud. In captivity, however, the hair grows out and becomes much shaggier, likely because of less abrasion <b>from</b> <b>walking</b> through vegetation. The rhino has a patch of long hair around its ears and a thick clump of hair {{at the end of}} its tail. Like all rhinos, they have very poor vision. The Sumatran rhinoceros is fast and agile; it climbs mountains easily and comfortably traverses steep slopes and riverbanks.|$|E

25|$|Mariners are {{concerned}} about very accurate measurements; however, casual users need not be concerned with differences between magnetic and true North.

By carefully recording distances (time or paces) and magnetic bearings traveled, one can plot a course and return to one's starting point using the compass alone.|$|E
25|$|The UFW, {{which had}} long {{asserted}} {{jurisdiction over the}} field workers, was outraged, especially when the Teamsters {{signed a contract with}} the growers days later without having to do much organizing or build support among the workers. Even as UFW leader César Chávez went on a hunger strike to protest the Teamsters' actions and a state district court imposed a temporary injunction to preempt UFW members <b>from</b> <b>walking</b> off the job, the UFW held secret talks with the Teamsters to avert a strike by the UFW. An agreement to return jurisdiction over the field workers to the farm union was reached on August 12, and FreshPict Foods (then owned by the Purex Corporation) and Inter-Harvest (part of the United Fruit Company) broke ranks with the other lettuce growers and signed contracts with the UFW.|$|E
25|$|In recent years, several {{attempts}} at the macro-scale {{application of the}} piezoelectric technology have emerged to harvest kinetic energy <b>from</b> <b>walking</b> pedestrians. The piezoelectric floors have been trialed {{since the beginning of}} 2007 in two Japanese train stations, Tokyo and Shibuya stations. The electricity generated from the foot traffic is used to provide all the electricity needed to run the automatic ticket gates and electronic display systems. In London, a famous nightclub exploited the piezoelectric technology in its dance floor. Parts of the lighting and sound systems in the club can be powered by the energy harvesting tiles. However, the piezoelectric tile deployed on the ground usually harvests energy from low frequency strikes provided by the foot traffic. This working condition may eventually lead to low power generation efficiency.|$|E

25|$|Carpets {{are used}} {{for a variety of}} purposes, {{including}} insulating a person's feet from a cold tile or concrete floor, making a room more comfortable as a place to sit on the floor (e.g., when playing with children or as a prayer rug), reducing sound <b>from</b> <b>walking</b> (particularly in apartment buildings) and adding decoration or colour to a room. Carpets can be made in any colour by using differently dyed fibers. Carpets can have many different types of patterns and motifs used to decorate the surface. In the 2000s, carpets are used in industrial and commercial establishments such as retail stores and hotels and in private homes. In the 2010s, a huge range of carpets and rugs are available at many price and quality levels, ranging from inexpensive, synthetic carpets that are mass-produced in factories and used in commercial buildings to costly hand-knotted wool rugs which are used in private homes of wealthy families.|$|E
