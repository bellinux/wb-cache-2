5|$|An {{alternative}} approach to designing smaller waveguide filters {{was provided by}} the use of non-propagating evanescent modes. Jaynes and Edson proposed evanescent mode waveguide filters in the late 1950s. Methods <b>for</b> <b>designing</b> these filters were created by Craven and Young in 1966. Since then, evanescent mode waveguide filters have seen successful use where waveguide size or weight are important considerations.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{concept of}} {{concurrent}} engineering (CE) {{has changed the}} traditional process of design to an integrated process, comprising all aspects of design, manufacturing, costing, process control etc. In composite product development, CE is adopted to enhance quality, to reduce time of production, and to reduce cost. There have been several models that consider <b>design</b> <b>for</b> minimal weight, <b>design</b> <b>for</b> cost, <b>design</b> <b>for</b> quality, <b>design</b> <b>for</b> manufacture, <b>design</b> <b>for</b> reliability, <b>design</b> <b>for</b> metal inserts, <b>design</b> <b>for</b> environment etc., separately for composite product development. In the present paper, we apply the graph theoretic approach to DFX analysis methodology <b>for</b> <b>design</b> of composite products. The DFX methodology is new to composite design, and is applied to study the various DFX components, like <b>design</b> <b>for</b> cost (DFC), <b>design</b> <b>for</b> manufacture (DFM), and <b>design</b> <b>for</b> minimal weight (DFMW), simultaneously. In this study, an example for development of fiber reinforced polymer composite (FRP) drive shafts is taken up. Several material combinations like E-glass/epoxy, E-glass/polyester, and HM-carbon/epoxy composite materials are compared {{in light of their}} performance with conventional steel material. The concurrent graph theoretic approach with a permanent function is used to account for the interdependencies existing among the design parameters in studying DFMW, DFM, and DFC...|$|R

5|$|The {{mechanism}} of prion replication has implications <b>for</b> <b>designing</b> drugs. Since the incubation period of prion diseases is so long, an effective drug {{does not need}} to eliminate all prions, but simply needs to slow down the rate of exponential growth. Models predict that {{the most effective way to}} achieve this, using a drug with the lowest possible dose, is to find a drug that binds to fibril ends and blocks them from growing any further.|$|E
5|$|The title monster was {{designed}} by production designer Richard Cassarino, who created the suit for $500, and was built over a diver's wetsuit. Conditions inside the suit were very hot; combined with the humid weather, this caused Clarke, who performed his own stunts in the film, to sweat profusely. The original mask is currently owned by archivist and occasional actor Bob Burns. Cassarino later worked as production designer for the 1958 film Hell Squad, and also was responsible <b>for</b> <b>designing</b> the sea creature costume in the science fiction film Destination Inner Space (1966).|$|E

While the redesign was taking place, construction on the station's original utilitarian design continued. The new design {{was based on the}} form of a Kievan Rus' temple, featuring unique mosaics situated throughout the station. The central hall's height was increased, and the original design's pylons were replaced with much lower columns, finished off with white marble and matte polish. In particular, the white ceiling was divided with diametrical mosaic stripes with brick grouting on the sides, completed by artists Hryhoriy Korin and Volodymyr Fedko.|$|E

Ferguson {{commissioned}} the Louisville architectural firm of Cobb and Dodd—the same firm responsible <b>for</b> <b>designing</b> the Seelbach Hotel and the new capitol building in Frankfort—to design his home in 1901. Construction of the mansion took four years (1901–1905) and cost $100,000, which was approximately ten times the cost of the neighboring Victorian homes. At the time, the mansion was the most expensive home in Louisville. In the 1920s, the Fergusons sold the home to the Pearson family, and it served as the Pearson Funeral Home until the mid-1970s. The house also provided the headquarters for John Y. Brown, Jr.'s successful 1979 gubernatorial campaign. In 1986, the mansion became the headquarters of The Filson Historical Society.|$|E
