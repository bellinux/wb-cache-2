40|$|Sediment {{grain size}} {{plays a major}} role in {{sediment}} biogeochemistry and sediments with different grain size are expected to react differently to organic enrichment. Through a mesocosm approach we tested the behavior of sediments with two types of predominant grain size (sandy and <b>muddy</b> <b>sediments)</b> under two levels of organic enrichment, related to mussel and fish farming. The polychaete Hediste diversicolor was used to simulate macrofauna bioturbation and bioirrigation. H. diversicolor stimulated organic matter (OM) mineralization and nutrient recycling. <b>Muddy</b> <b>sediments</b> had more OM from nature, resulting in higher sulfate reduction rates than sandy sediments. Under low levels of organic enrichment grain size did not have any effect on benthic fluxes (sediment oxygen uptake, total CO 2, ammonium, nitrate, nitrite and phosphate). However, at high levels of organic enrichment, sandy sediments accumulated less OM, less sulfide and less ammonium than <b>muddy</b> <b>sediments,</b> while sediment oxygen uptake and total CO 2 showed similar levels between sandy and <b>muddy</b> <b>sediments.</b> Thus, grain size should be considered a key parameter for site selection of fish farming facilities when aiming for a sustainable aquaculture industry...|$|R

Five major types of sediment were recognized based upon the {{particle-size distribution}}.

These samples and the sand, silt and clay fractions were analyzed for the organic carbon, total hydrogen and total nitrogen. The following resurts were obtained. 1) In the sandy sediments, the clay fractions contained the C, H, N more than the sand and silt fractions. Conversely, in the <b>muddy</b> <b>sediments,</b> the clay fractions contained the C, H, N less than the other fractions. 2) The contents of C, N in the sand fractions decrease {{with an increase in}} the amount of the sand. In the same way, the contents of C, N in the clay fractions decrease with an increase in the amount of the clay. It seems that the sand dilute the contents of C, H, N in the sand fractions and the clay also dilute them in the clay fractions. 3) The C/N ratio varied between 9. 02 and 13. 52 in the <b>muddy</b> <b>sediments</b> which contain a great amout of C, N, and between 7. 52 and 10. 38 in the sandy sediments.

40|$|International audienceMicrobial {{activity}} {{measurements and}} molecular approaches were combined to study temporal variation in nitrogen (N) removal mechanisms from muddy and sandy intertidal sediments (Arcachon Bay, France). Stable isotopes ((NH 4 +) -N- 15 /(NO 3 -) -N- 15) {{were used to}} measure oxidation of NH 4 + to NO 3 -/NO 2 - and its subsequent reduction to N- 2 via denitrification and/or anammox. We found that denitrification mainly fuelled N loss in both sediment types. However in sandy sediments, anammox accounted for relatively higher N- 2 production (45 %). Nitrification-denitrification (D-n) and nitrification-anammox coupling was observed particularly in <b>muddy</b> <b>sediments.</b> Temporal variations in prokaryotic abundance (Bacteria, Archaea) and of functional groups responsible for nitrification and denitrification were studied by qPCR and for anammoxifiers by cloning. Bacterial density in both sediment types varied between 10 (7 - 8) equivalent cell per g(- 1) dry weight sediment and were overall more abundant in <b>muddy</b> <b>sediments.</b> Archaeal equivalent cell varied between 0. 5 and 6. 5 % of the total prokaryotes, with extreme values observed in <b>muddy</b> <b>sediment</b> during October and January respectively. Denitrifiers were 1 - 2 orders higher than ammonium oxidizers and archeal nitrifiers appeared insignificant compared to betaproteobacterial counterpart. Furthermore, nitrifiers exhibited greater fluctuations in sandy <b>sediments</b> compared to <b>muddy</b> ones. Anammoxifiers were mainly restricted to the "Candidatus Scalindua" group, and were detected in both sediment types and all sampling periods providing an indirect proof on the occurrence of anammox. In <b>muddy</b> <b>sediments,</b> N- 2 production presented overall higher rate over sandy sediments and exhibited the same trend as nitrifier abundance. This finding suggests a central role of bacterially-mediated benthic nitrification in supporting dissimilatory processes through generation of NO 3 -/NO 2 and preventing eutrophication in this mesotidal lagoo...|$|R

40|$|The trace {{fossil record}} is {{important}} in determining {{the timing of the}} appearance of bilaterian animals. A conservative estimate puts this time at ≈ 555 million years ago. The preservational potential of traces made close to the sediment–water interface is crucial to detecting early benthic activity. Our studies on earliest Cambrian sediments suggest that shallow tiers were preserved {{to a greater extent than}} typical for most of the Phanerozoic, which can be attributed both directly and indirectly to the low levels of sediment mixing. The low levels of sediment mixing meant that thin event beds were preserved. The shallow depth of sediment mixing also meant that <b>muddy</b> <b>sediments</b> were firm close to the sediment–water interface, increasing the likelihood of recording shallow-tier trace fossils in <b>muddy</b> <b>sediments.</b> Overall, trace fossils can provide a sound record of the onset of bilaterian benthic activity...|$|R

40|$|Burrowing {{bivalves}} {{are associated}} with particular sediment types within sedimentary systems. The degree to which bivalve sediment associations are repeatable across systems has seldom been investigated. To investigate whether such repeatability exists across tidal flats, we compared adult and juvenile distributions of 3 bivalve species (Cerastoderma edule, Scrobicularia plana, Macoma balthica) across 6 European tidal flats. Across systems, the adult bivalves showed fairly repeatable distributions, with C. edule occurring in sandy sediments and AT balthica and S, plana occurring in <b>muddy</b> <b>sediments.</b> Exceptions were observed in systems composed primarily of <b>muddy</b> <b>sediments</b> (Aiguillon Bay and Marennes-Oleron Bay) and the Dutch Wadden Sea. Interestingly, juveniles and adults of C. edule and S. plana showed similar distributions across systems, M. balthica juveniles and adults showed habitat separation in 3 of the 6 studied systems; in 2 of these, {{it has been shown}} previously that juvenile M. balthica settle in mud at high tidal levels and migrate to lower sandier flats later in life. The high occurrence of juvenile M. balthica towards high sandy flats in Mont Saint-Michel Bay suggests that juveniles might choose high tidal fiats rather than <b>muddy</b> <b>sediments</b> per se. A repeatable association in adults and juveniles with respect to sediment could Suggest that juveniles actively settle in the proximity of the adults and/or that juveniles settling away from the adults incur a higher mortality due to either predation, physiological stress, or other factors...|$|R

40|$|During {{an annual}} cycle, {{overlying}} {{water and sediment}} cores were collected simultaneously at three sites (Tavira, Culatra and Ramalhete) of Ria Formosa’s intertidal muddy and subtidal sandy sediments to determine ammonium, nitrates plus nitrites and phosphate. Organic carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus were also determined in superficial sediments. Ammonium and phosphate dissolved in porewater were positively correlated with temperature (P < 0. 01) in <b>muddy</b> and sandy <b>sediments,</b> while the nitrogen-oxidized forms had a negative correlation (P < 0. 02) in <b>muddy</b> <b>sediments</b> probably because mineralization and nitrification/denitrification processes vary seasonally. Porewater ammonium profiles evidenced apeak in the top-most <b>muddy</b> <b>sediment</b> (380 lM) suggesting higher mineralization rate when oxygen is more available, while maximum phosphate concentration (113 lM) occurred in the sub-oxic layer probably due to phosphorus desorption under reduced conditions. In organically poor subtidal sandy sediments, nutrient porewater concentrations were always lower than in intertidal <b>muddy</b> <b>sediments,</b> ranging annually from 20 lMto 100 lM for ammonium and from 0. 05 lM to 16 lM for phosphate. Nutrient diffusive fluxes predicted by a mathematical model were higher during summer, inbothmuddy (104 nmol cm– 2 d– 1 ––NH 4 +; 8 nmol cm– 2 d– 1 ––HPO 4 – 2) and sandy sediments (26 nmol cm– 2 d– 1 ––NH 4 +; 1 nmol cm– 2 d– 1 ––HPO 4 – 2), while during lower temperature periods these fluxes were 3 – 4 times lower. Based on simulated nutrient effluxes, the estimated annual amount of ammonium and phosphate exported from intertidal areas was three times higher than that released from subtidal areas (22 ton year– 1 ––NH 4 +; 2 ton year– 1 ––HPO 4 – 2), emphasizing the importance of tidal flats to maintain the high productivity of the lagoon. Global warming scenarios simulated with the model, revealed that an increase in lagoon water temperature only produces significant variations (P < 0. 05) for NH 4 + in porewater and consequent diffusive fluxes, what will probably affect the system productivity due to a N/P ratio unbalance...|$|R
