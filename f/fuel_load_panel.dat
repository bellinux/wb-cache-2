30|$|Quantifying {{wildland}} fire emissions {{is a critical}} step in evaluating smoke impacts. Smoke emissions estimates {{require the use of}} modeling pathways that combine multiple sources of data and the linking of scientific models in a logical, progressive sequence. Fire emissions are typically modeled using information on fire size and location, coupled with <b>fuel</b> <b>loading</b> maps, which are then processed through consumption models capable of producing emissions estimates. In a complex modeling process, numerous options are available, and managers, scientists, and others who model fire emissions need to understand the uncertainties and differences in this process. Intercomparisons, such as the one conducted here, provide insights into the sensitivity of smoke emissions estimates to the variability present at each step in a modeling pathway. Use of accurate fire information and local fuels data is critical to reducing the amount of uncertainty in the overall modeling chain. The first step to providing better estimates of smoke emissions is to provide better estimates of the fuels available to burn. Under-or over-estimating fire size can lead to inaccurate representations of the amount of fuel available to burn, the amount of fuel consumed during a fire, and subsequently unrepresentative estimates of smoke emissions. Additional uncertainty when modeling smoke emissions can be introduced by the available <b>fuel</b> <b>loading</b> maps. For example, we found that all modeled <b>fuel</b> <b>loading</b> maps studied underestimated total woody <b>fuel</b> <b>loading</b> when directly compared with field-sampled <b>fuel</b> <b>loading</b> data. Locally produced <b>fuel</b> <b>loading</b> maps such as the OkWen custom FCCS <b>fuel</b> <b>loading</b> map can reduce some of the uncertainty due to <b>fuel</b> <b>loading</b> inaccuracies; however, our results suggest that <b>fuel</b> <b>loading,</b> and subsequent smoke emissions, are commonly underestimated on wildfire in the Pacific Northwest. Examination of other fires as part of SEMIP (N. Larkin, unpublished data) shows similar results, suggesting that the uncertainties identified here are important areas for future research and development.|$|R

30|$|In {{contrast}} to studies of burning in shrub-lands and deserts (Davis et al. 1989, Brooks 2002, Wright and Clarke 2008), neither thatch depth nor <b>fuel</b> <b>loading</b> {{had a significant}} relationship with soil temperatures in our sites. This may reflect differences in methods of measurement (thermal paints and temperature dataloggers may have dissimilar response times to heating) or differences in vegetation. Grasslands have more uniform and continuous vegetation cover than shrublands, which are characterized by distinct canopy gaps separating large shrubs, and thus have higher variation in <b>fuel</b> <b>loading.</b> The importance of vegetation structure {{is supported by the}} much smaller range of peak surface temperatures observed in grasslands than in shrublands (Neary et al. 1999). In addition, the plots in our study were established in potential butterfly habitat mostly free of large invasive shrubs and heavy <b>fuel</b> <b>loads</b> that can dramatically increase soil temperatures and heat dosages. A recent study that modeled peak soil temperatures during semi-arid grassland fires in relation to fuel and weather conditions found <b>fuel</b> <b>load</b> to be a much stronger predictor than weather conditions (Augustine et al. 2014), but it evaluated a much larger range of <b>fuel</b> <b>loads</b> and narrower range of weather conditions than occurred on our sites and during our burns. Thus, the potential effect of a wider range of <b>fuel</b> <b>loads</b> on soil temperatures in our system may not be adequately captured here.|$|R

Nat. 140, 477 - 491) {{presented}} {{a model that}} predicts optimal departure <b>fuel</b> <b>loads</b> {{as a function of}} the rate of fuel deposition in time-minimizing migrants. The basis of the model is that the coverable distance per unit of fuel deposited, diminishes with increasing <b>fuel</b> <b>load.</b> This is an effect of the increasing flight costs associated with increasing body mass. Lindstrom & Alerstam (1992) found that birds left at lower <b>fuel</b> <b>loads</b> than their model predicted for which they considered various ecological explanations. Alternatively, we hypothesize that the difference between prediction and empirical data might be a result of extra resting metabolic and transport costs associated with an increase in <b>fuel</b> <b>load</b> during stopover. We develop a new version of the Lindstrom & Alerstam (1992) model taking <b>fuel</b> <b>load</b> associated costs during stopover into account.

40|$|AbstractAtmospheric {{composition}} is {{strongly influenced by}} wildfire emissions, which have a strong variability over time and space. Estimates of fire emissions on large scale {{are based on a}} combination of burned area, combustion completeness, and <b>fuel</b> <b>load.</b> Approaches differ in the derivation of this information, which involves models and observations to different degrees. Due to the lack of highly spatially and temporally resolved observations the variability of <b>fuel</b> <b>load</b> is often not fully taken into account. The <b>fuel</b> <b>load</b> can differ between seasons due to variations in the vegetation productivity, decomposition rates and fire occurrence. On the longer time scale the effect of CO 2 fertilization is expected to influence the vegetation productivity and therefore overall <b>fuel</b> <b>load</b> abundance. All these processes are accounted for in land carbon cycle models. We use the land surface and vegetation model JSBACH as a tool to understand the influence of <b>fuel</b> <b>load</b> seasonality, <b>fuel</b> <b>load</b> variability within land cover types and CO 2 fertilization on fire occurrence and wildfire emissions. We find that using the mean <b>fuel</b> <b>load</b> over time for each grid cell instead of seasonally varying fuels leads to comparable burned area and emissions (only 3 % deviations from the reference). Using minimum or maximum values, however, leads to strong under (0. 54 times the reference) and overestimation (1. 85 times the reference) of the emissions. When using constant <b>fuel</b> <b>load</b> for each vegetation type strong regionally varying, over and underestimations of emissions are found. Over the 20 th century CO 2 fertilization strongly impacts fuel availability. As a consequence, burned area and carbon emissions are almost 20 and 40 % higher at present day. In general, our results confirm the applicability of time constant <b>fuel</b> <b>loads</b> in emission estimation methods for present day, as the seasonality is of minor importance. However, we suggest that considering the variability of fuel driven by climate variability in space can improve the estimates. This result is in line with a number of studies highlighting the importance of fuel limitation for the occurrence of fire. On the longer time scale the influence of CO 2 fertilization is not negligible according to our results, but high uncertainties in the understanding of the process increases the difficulty to account for it in fire carbon emission approaches. This assessment of potential errors in fire emission datasets should help to further improve approaches to estimate fire emissions and to interpret available datasets and differences between them...|$|R
