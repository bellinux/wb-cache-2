The road and post occupied a narrow shelf between a cliff and a steep slope to the sea. The <b>gate</b> <b>housing</b> included two small arms ports, while the blockhouse could cover the gate and the road beyond with its guns firing through embrasures in the heavy concrete guardpost. [...] Tunnels in the cliff wall behind the post contained a magazine, living quarters, and an escape tunnel, like a Maginot ouvrage on a much smaller scale.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Gate</b> <b>House,</b> {{with the}} rest of Upper Burwash, opened in 1913 and has held {{students}} every year since then except 1995, when it was renovated. As an all-male residence from 1913 to 2007 it held a number of unique traditions. For 20 years <b>Gate</b> <b>House</b> hosted an annual party called Novemberfest in the Burwash dining hall. The Victoria Dean of Students cancelled Novemberfest in 2003, when police discovered widespread underage drinking and over 800 people in the dining hall, in violation of the fire code. Another <b>Gate</b> <b>House</b> tradition that no longer occurs is the [...] "stirring the chicken," [...] a dinner and keg party where house members cook chicken fajitas for hundreds of guests. Until 2007, <b>Gate</b> <b>House</b> held secretive first-year initiation ceremonies called Traditionals, which involved writing slogans on campus buildings in chalk, singing songs to the all-women's residence (who would then sing back to them), and leading first-years around the house blindfolded. Since Novemberfest, <b>Gate</b> <b>House</b> continued to have conflict with the Administration. In 2004 the Dean evicted three <b>Gate</b> <b>House</b> residents for allegedly [...] "hog-tying" [...] a first-year student. In 2007 President Paul W. Gooch wrote that <b>Gate</b> <b>House</b> undertook an [...] "escalating series of actions" [...] that were [...] "defiant" [...] and [...] "disparaging of women", in response to Gate members constructing a 2.5-metre snow penis and placing a cooked pig's head in an Annesley bathroom. As punishment, during the fall exam period Gooch evicted two residents and relocated the remainder of <b>Gate</b> <b>House</b> to other places in the residence system, banned all current <b>Gate</b> <b>House</b> students from entering the building in 2008. Since this decision <b>Gate</b> <b>House</b> has become a co-ed residence identical to the other Upper Burwash houses. Notable residents of <b>Gate</b> <b>House</b> include Lester B. Pearson, former Prime Minister of Canada, and Simon Pulsifer, who Time magazine nicknamed [...] "The Duke of Data" [...] for his contributions to Wikipedia.|$|R

50|$|Halton {{lies just}} outside the Metropolitan Green Belt so {{it has not been}} {{protected}} from postwar housing development. At its southern end it is contiguous with Wendover, but it retains a separate, older village centre anchored by St Michael & All Angels Church and a community hall. There is a separate, modern Catholic Church. The Parish also includes RAF Halton, a Royal Air Force (RAF) training station with a grass airfield used for glider training. Most modern housing in the village was built for RAF personnel, but some is now in private hands. A small shop mainly serves the RAF community. The base had a large military hospital employing hundreds of people, which was closed in 1995. The buildings remained until 2007/8 when they were demolished for the Princess Mary <b>Gate</b> <b>housing</b> scheme on land between Halton and Wendover.|$|E

Work on the structural parts (foundations, mobile barrier abutments, <b>gate</b> <b>housing</b> structures), associated structures (breakwaters, small craft harbours, locks) and parts for operating the system (technical buildings, plant) is now at an advanced stage.Currently about 4000 people are employed {{in the construction of}} MOSE.As well as the construction sites at the inlets, fabrication of the main components of MOSE (the hinges, the technological heart of the system which constrain the gates to their housing and allow them to move, and the gates) is also proceeding. Restructuring of the buildings and spaces {{in the area of the}} Venice Arsenal where maintenance of MOSE and management of the system will be located is also underway.|$|E
