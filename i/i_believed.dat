It's a really tough job and because I wrote the whole thing I really believed in this record, as did Nellee Hooper, I was jaded and disappointed.|$|E

25|$|By {{order of}} Albizu Campos, the cadets adopted a {{military}} structure with companies in various towns of the island. Albizu Campos, {{who had served}} as a Lieutenant in the United States Army during World War <b>I,</b> <b>believed</b> that the cadets had to adopt a system of strict military training if they were to become a powerful Puerto Rican Army. He believed that a well-trained and disciplined army would eventually be able to fight against the United States imperialism which ruled the island. Albizu Campos often referred to the cadets as the Ejército Libertador de Puerto Rico (The Liberation Army of Puerto Rico).|$|E
25|$|The rectorate was {{an attempt}} to see {{something}} in the movement that had come to power, beyond all its failings and crudeness, that was much more far-reaching and that could perhaps one day bring a concentration on the Germans' Western historical essence. It will in no way be denied that at the time <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> in such possibilities and for that reason renounced the actual vocation of thinking in favor of being effective in an official capacity. In no way will what was caused by my own inadequacy in office be played down. But these points of view do not capture what is essential and what moved me to accept the rectorate.|$|E

Further, <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> that the phenomenology of occurrent conscious thought is proprietary: it’s a sui generis sort of phenomenology, as unlike (say) auditory and visual phenomenology {{as they are}} unlike each other – a cognitive phenomenology. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> this because <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> that the conscious occurrence {{of any of the}} more familiar sorts of phenomenal properties is neither necessary nor sufficient for the occurrence of conscious thought. <b>I</b> also <b>believe</b> that the phenomenal character of a conscious occurrent thought is individuative: that is, in virtue of its having the phenomenal properties it has, it’s a thought (as opposed to some other kind of mental state) with a specific intentional content. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> this because <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> that we’re able to identify our occurrent conscious thoughts as the thoughts they are, consciously, introspectively and non-inferentially, and that phenomenal properties are the only properties of occurrent conscious states that are so identifiable.

25|$|However, the Easterners, {{who were}} {{by far the}} {{majority}} in court, were not pleased that Yi I was apparently neutral in the conflict, when they believed that Sim Euigyeom had clearly wronged. However, Yi <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> that both Kim and Sim had done {{both good and bad}} things. Sim had prevented a fifth purge of the Sarim (by chasing Yi Lyang and his followers from court in 1563), while Kim had helped form a Sarim government by introducing many new scholars into the government. However, Sim had interfered in politics despite his status as a relative of the queen, while Kim had been close to Yun Wonhyeong despite his being a Seonbi. Yi I therefore believed that both sides were equal in their deeds and misdeeds.|$|E

Religion, however, played an increasingly insignificant role in his life. He would later remark that his continued studies in theology drew him closer to atheism: [...] "I had a very clear feeling that I didn't believe in God and that I had in fact received a certificate in materialist uncertainty; the more I studied religious subjects, the less <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> in God."

He picked up again, but by early 1961 he had a urinary infection. Dorothy felt unable to look after him, so he went to live with Olga in Rapallo, then Venice; Dorothy mostly stayed in London after that with Omar. Pound attended a neo-Fascist May Day parade in 1962, but his health continued to decline. The following year he told an interviewer, Grazia Levi: [...] "I spoil everything I touch.
