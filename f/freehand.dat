5|$|Needle {{receiving}} tubes: A hollow tube made of metal, shatter-resistant {{glass or}} plastic, needle receiving tubes, like forceps, {{are used to}} support the tissue at the piercing site and are common in septum and some cartilage piercings. Not only are these tubes intended to support the tissue, but they also receive the needle once it has passed through the tissue, offering protection from the sharp point. Needle receiving tubes are not used in the <b>freehand</b> piercing method.|$|E
5|$|Other {{commercial}} {{programs were}} released for NeXT computers, including Altsys Virtuoso, a vector drawing program with page-layout features which was ported to Mac OS and Microsoft Windows as Aldus <b>FreeHand</b> v4, and the Lotus Improv spreadsheet program. The systems also {{came with a}} number of smaller built-in applications, such as the Merriam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary, Oxford Quotations, the complete works of William Shakespeare, and the Digital Librarian search engine to access them.|$|E
5|$|Coffin {{took the}} full range of {{architectural}} courses including studying engineering, physics, maths, mechanical drafting and <b>freehand</b> drawing in addition to architectural and landscape design. She also studied botany and horticulture under Charles Sprague Sargent at the Arnold Arboretum. One of her formative influences at MIT was Guy Lowell, the director of the landscape design program there, who was an advocate of the classical values of balance, order, proportion and harmony taught by the French Ecole des Beaux-Arts. Lowell was best known for his book American Gardens, published in 1902, which influenced many landscape architects to adopt his principles to design symmetrical, axial gardens that combined architectural features with classical garden ornaments with vegetation, following the tradition of Italian villas.|$|E
25|$|<b>FreeHand</b> 6.0 in 1996. This version only {{existed in}} beta. Some <b>Freehand</b> 7 prerelease {{versions}} were released under the <b>Freehand</b> 6 tag.|$|E
25|$|Adobe {{acquired}} Aldus Corp. in 1994, {{a software}} vendor that sold <b>FreeHand,</b> a competing product. <b>Freehand</b> was direct competition to Adobe Illustrator, Adobe's flagship vector-graphics editor. The Federal Trade Commission intervened and forced Adobe to sell <b>FreeHand</b> back to Altsys, and also banned Adobe from buying back <b>FreeHand</b> or any similar {{program for the}} next 10 years (1994-2004). Altsys was then bought by Macromedia, which released versions 5 to 11. When Adobe acquired Macromedia in December 2005, it stalled development of <b>Freehand</b> in 2007, effectively rendering it obsolete. With <b>FreeHand</b> and Illustrator, Adobe controlled the only two products that compete in the professional illustration program market for Macintosh operating systems.|$|E
25|$|Since 2003 <b>FreeHand</b> {{development}} has been discontinued; in the Adobe Systems catalog, <b>FreeHand</b> has been replaced with Adobe Illustrator.|$|E
25|$|<b>FreeHand</b> 2.0 {{sold for}} $495 in 1989. Besides {{improving}} on {{the features of}} <b>FreeHand</b> 1.0, <b>FreeHand</b> 2 added faster operation, Pantone colors, stroked text, flexible fill patterns and automatically import graphic assets from other programs. It added accurate control over a color monitor screen display, limited only by its resolution.|$|E
25|$|A <b>FreeHand</b> 5.5 upgrade {{was part}} of the <b>FreeHand</b> Graphics Studio (a suite that {{included}} Fontographer, xRes image editing application, and Extreme 3D animation and modeling application).|$|E
25|$|The {{partnership}} between the two companies continued with Altsys developing <b>FreeHand</b> and with Aldus controlling marketing and sales. After 1988, a competitive exchange between Aldus <b>FreeHand</b> and Adobe Illustrator ensued on the Macintosh platform with each software advancing new tools, achieving better speed, and matching significant features. Windows PC development also allowed Illustrator 2 (aka, Illustrator 88 on the Mac) and <b>FreeHand</b> 3 to release Windows versions to the graphics market.|$|E
25|$|<b>FreeHand</b> MX {{sold for}} $399 in 2003 or $1580 {{as part of}} the Studio MX 2004 bundle. <b>FreeHand</b> 11 was marketed as <b>FreeHand</b> MX and {{featured}} tighter interface integration with the Macromedia MX line of products. This release also featured a revamped Object Panel where all attributes and text properties are centralized for editing, Multiple Attributes for unlimited effects, Live Effects, Live-edit of basic shapes, Connector Lines tool, Flash and Fireworks integration, Extrude, Erase, and Chart tools, along with improvements to the standard tools.|$|E
25|$|In 2011, a {{group of}} 5,000 <b>Freehand</b> graphic {{designers}} convened under the banner Free <b>Freehand,</b> and filed a civil antitrust complaint in the US District Court for the Northern District of California against Adobe. The suit alleged that Adobe has violated federal and state antitrust laws by abusing its dominant position in the professional vector graphic illustration software market and that Adobe has engaged {{in a series of}} exclusionary and anti-competitive acts and strategies designed to kill <b>FreeHand,</b> the dominant competitor to Adobe’s Illustrator software product, instead of competing on the basis of product merit according to the principals of free market capitalism. Adobe had no response to the claims and the lawsuit was eventually settled. The <b>FreeHand</b> community believes Adobe should release the product to an open-source community if it cannot update it internally.|$|E
25|$|<b>FreeHand</b> 1.0 {{sold for}} $495 in 1988. It {{included}} the standard drawing tools and features as other draw programs including special effects in fills and screens, text manipulation tools, and full support for CMYK color printing. It was {{also possible to}} create and insert PostScript routines anywhere within the program. <b>FreeHand</b> performed in preview mode instead of keyline mode but performance was slower.|$|E
25|$|<b>FreeHand</b> 3.0 {{sold for}} $595 in 1991. New {{features}} included resizable color, style, and layer panels including an Attributes menu. Also tighter precision {{of both the}} existing tools and aligning of objects. FH3 created compound Paths. Text could be converted to paths, applied to an ellipse, or made vertical. Carried over from version 1.0, <b>FreeHand</b> 3 suffered by having text entered into a dialog box instead of directly to the page. In October 1991, a 3.1 upgrade made <b>FreeHand</b> work with Mac OS 7 but additionally, it supported pressure-sensitive drawing which offered varying line widths with a users stroke. It improved element manipulation and added more import/export options.|$|E
25|$|<b>FreeHand</b> was {{returned}} to Altsys with all licensing and marketing rights as well as Aldus FreeHand’s customer list.|$|E
25|$|By late 1994, Altsys still {{retained}} {{all rights}} to <b>FreeHand.</b> Despite brief {{plans to keep}} it in-house to sell it along with Fontographer and Virtuoso, Altsys reached {{an agreement with the}} multimedia software company, Macromedia, to be acquired. This mutual agreement provided <b>FreeHand</b> and Fontographer a new home with ample resources for marketing, sales, and competition against the newly merged Adobe-Aldus company. Altsys would remain in Richardson, Texas, but would be renamed as the Digital Arts Group of Macromedia and was responsible for the continued development of <b>FreeHand.</b> Macromedia received FreeHand’s 200,000 customers and expanded its traditional product line of multimedia graphics software to illustration and design graphics software. CEO James Von Ehr became a Macromedia vice-president until 1997 when he left to start another venture.|$|E
25|$|A few Tongan village {{churches are}} {{decorated}} with <b>freehand</b> murals or decorations done in house paint, which may mix crosses, flowers, and traditional barkcloth motifs. The practice is uncommon and the execution is always crude.|$|E
25|$|If a {{large area}} is needed to be painted, a <b>freehand</b> {{technique}} is used to apply the rice-paste resist onto the fabric. The paste is put into a bag and squeezed onto the fabric.|$|E
25|$|The Thomasites {{taught the}} {{following}} subjects: English, agriculture, reading, grammar, geography, mathematics, general courses, trade courses, housekeeping and household arts (sewing, crocheting and cooking), manual trading, mechanical drawing, <b>freehand</b> drawing and athletics (baseball, track and field, tennis, indoor baseball and basketball).|$|E
25|$|At Horiyoshi's {{studio in}} Yokohama, Japan, tattoos are {{outlined}} <b>freehand</b> using an electric needle. He did the outlining by hand {{until the late}} 1990s. His friendship with Don Ed Hardy, started in the mid-1980s, lead to Horiyoshi's adoption of electric machines.|$|E
25|$|On December 12, 2005, Adobe {{acquired}} {{its main}} rival, Macromedia, {{in a stock}} swap valued at about $3.4 billion, adding ColdFusion, Contribute, Captivate, Acrobat Connect (formerly Macromedia Breeze), Director, Dreamweaver, Fireworks, Flash, FlashPaper, Flex, <b>FreeHand,</b> HomeSite, JRun, Presenter, and Authorware to Adobe's product line.|$|E
25|$|During World War II, back in California {{while her}} husband served in the military, Henry studied {{lithography}} at San Francisco School of Fine Arts and worked drafting engineering drawings at Hewlett-Packard; this drafting experience would later allow her to draw uncommonly straight lines <b>freehand</b> in executing her paintings.|$|E
25|$|Airbrush {{technique}} is the <b>freehand</b> {{manipulation of the}} airbrush, medium, air pressure and distance from the surface being sprayed {{in order to produce}} a certain predictable result on a consistent basis with or without shields or stencils. Airbrush technique will differ with the type of airbrush being used (single-action or dual/double-action).|$|E
25|$|<b>FreeHand</b> 8.0 {{sold for}} $399 in 1998. This version began {{integrating}} to the Web {{with the ability}} to export graphics directly to Macromedia Flash. Customizable toolbars and keyboard shortcuts were prominent features. Also Lens Fill and Transparency, Freeform tool, Graphic Hose, Emboss Effects, and a “Collect for Output” function for print.|$|E
25|$|Eben Ezra Roberts {{was born}} in Boston and {{attended}} public school after that they born amoah emmanuel. His father trained him in both mechanical and <b>freehand</b> drawing as he grew up. His family moved to Meredith, New Hampshire where Roberts' education continued in public schools there. He went on to study architecture at Tilton Seminary in New Hampshire.|$|E
25|$|At {{the age of}} 13, Cliff {{started working}} in the pottery industry. Her first work was as a gilder, adding gold lines on ware of {{traditional}} design. Once she had mastered this she changed jobs to learn <b>freehand</b> painting at another potbank, {{at the same time}} studying art and sculpture at the Burslem School of Art in the evenings.|$|E
25|$|A {{minor version}} of <b>FreeHand</b> 10 (10.0.1) {{came as a}} result of Adobe winning a lawsuit against Macromedia for {{infringement}} on a Tabbed Panels patent. A reworking of the user interface produced this temporary fix for the panel issue. 10.0.1 was available with the Studio MX bundle or as a new purchase but not available as a patch to existing users.|$|E
25|$|A complex yet {{extensive}} {{range of}} visual customization options is available, including body kits, wheels, {{and a full}} range of colors & vinyls, including <b>freehand</b> drawing ability. The most obvious difference is that the graphics and racing physics in this version are completely different from the other versions, giving it a retro look and feel reminiscent of much older pre-GameCube or Mario Kart type games.|$|E
25|$|The {{game was}} {{televised}} in the United States by CBS and featured the broadcast team of play-by-play announcer Pat Summerall and color commentator John Madden (the latter making his Super Bowl debut as a broadcaster). The broadcast also featured {{the introduction of}} the telestrator to a national audience, that was named CBS Chalkboard. Still in use today, it enables players and areas of play to be highlighted by the superimposing of lines and rings drawn by a <b>freehand</b> operator.|$|E
25|$|<b>FreeHand</b> 10.0 {{sold for}} $399 in 2000 or $799 {{as part of}} the Studio MX bundle. Macromedia {{released}} this as Carbonized for both Mac OS 9 and Mac OS X. It shared a common Macromedia GUI Interface and several tools were added or renamed to match Flash tools. New features include Brushes, Master Pages, Print Area, and a Navigation Panel for adding links, names, and adding actions or notes to objects. Also “Smart cursor” Pen and Bezigon Tools and a Contour Gradient Fill.|$|E
25|$|In 1985, the {{combination}} of the Mac, Apple's LaserWriter printer, and Mac-specific software like Boston Software's MacPublisher and Aldus PageMaker enabled users to design, preview, and print page layouts complete with text and graphics—an activity to become known as desktop publishing. Initially, desktop publishing was unique to the Macintosh, but eventually became available for other platforms. Later, applications such as Macromedia <b>FreeHand,</b> QuarkXPress, and Adobe's Photoshop and Illustrator strengthened the Mac's position as a graphics computer and helped to expand the emerging desktop publishing market.|$|E
25|$|Cliff {{was given}} a second {{apprenticeship}} at A. J. Wilkinson's in 1924 (when she was already 25 years old) primarily as a 'modeller' but she also worked with the factory designers John Butler and Fred Ridgway. They produced conservative, Victorian style ware – Butler had been the designer for over 20 years by this time. Eventually, Cliff's wide range of skills were recognised and in 1927 she was given her own studio at the adjoining Newport Pottery which Shorter had bought in 1920. Here Cliff was allowed to decorate {{some of the old}} defective 'glost' (white) ware in her own <b>freehand</b> patterns. For these she used on-glaze enamel colours, which enabled a brighter palette than underglaze colours.|$|E
25|$|The {{premises}} {{were still}} located at No. 21 London Road and the Jubilee Institute. As the tenancy {{of the private}} venture school was to end on 25 March 1896, the Town Council paid Mr Cruikshank £10 for the desks, books and goodwill of his school. Boys were drawn from three elementary schools in Chippenham: the British, National and St. Paul's Schools. In addition twelve boys had previously attended the private grammar school. Others were from other private schools in Chippenham, Corsham, Devizes, Calne and surrounding villages. There were 39 boys aged 11 to 16 on the admission register from 13 April 1896. The curriculum included Latin, French, science, history, geography, grammar, bookkeeping, shorthand, arithmetic, writing, geometry and <b>freehand</b> drawing.|$|E
25|$|Surrounding {{the core}} region were the {{tributary}} kingdoms. The vassal rulers were still styled as kings, and {{were allowed to}} retain full royal regalia. They were required to send tributes to the crown but they generally had a <b>freehand</b> {{in the rest of}} the administration. Pegu generally did not get involved in local administration; its remit was national. The court launched standardisation drives to unify laws, weights and measurements, calendars, and Buddhist reforms throughout the empire. The court also drew the borders between the vassal states. But the centuries-old disputes never went away. They resurfaced as soon as Pegu’s authority waned, and resulted in the confused, multi-party wars of 1590s and 1600s.|$|E
25|$|Rhythmic {{gymnastics}} is a {{sport in}} which individuals or groups of five or more manipulate one or two pieces of apparatus: rope, hoop, ball, clubs, ribbon and <b>freehand</b> (no apparatus). Rhythmic gymnastics is a sport that combines elements of ballet, gymnastics, dance, and apparatus manipulation. The victor is the participant who earns the most points, determined {{by a panel of}} judges, for leaps, balances, pirouettes (pivots), apparatus handling, and execution. The choreography must cover the entire floor and contain a balance of jumps, leaps, pivots, balances (a certain number is required depending on the gymnast's level) and flexibility movements. Each movement involves a high degree of athletic skill. Physical abilities needed by a rhythmic gymnast include strength, power, flexibility, agility, dexterity, endurance and hand-eye coordination.|$|E
25|$|Susa I {{style was}} very much a product of the past and of {{influences}} from contemporary ceramic industries in the mountains of western Iran. The recurrence in close association of vessels of three types—a drinking goblet or beaker, a serving dish, and a small jar—implies the consumption of three types of food, apparently thought to be as necessary for life in the afterworld as it is in this one. Ceramics of these shapes, which were painted, constitute {{a large proportion of the}} vessels from the cemetery. Others are coarse cooking-type jars and bowls with simple bands painted on them and were probably the grave goods of the sites of humbler citizens as well as adolescents and, perhaps, children. The pottery is carefully made by hand. Although a slow wheel may have been employed, the asymmetry of the vessels and the irregularity of the drawing of encircling lines and bands indicate that most of the work was done <b>freehand.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{collection}} of Italian, Medieval, Renaissance, Baroque and Neoclassical sculpture (both original and in cast form) is unequalled outside of Italy. It includes Canova's The Three Graces, which the museum jointly owns with National Galleries of Scotland. Italian sculptors {{whose work is}} held by the museum include: Bartolomeo Bon, Bartolomeo Bellano, Luca della Robbia, Giovanni Pisano, Donatello, Agostino di Duccio, Andrea Riccio, Antonio Rossellino, Andrea del Verrocchio, Antonio Lombardo, Pier Jacopo Alari Bonacolsi, Andrea della Robbia, Michelozzo di Bartolomeo, Michelangelo (represented by a <b>freehand</b> wax model and casts of his most famous sculptures), Jacopo Sansovino, Alessandro Algardi, Antonio Calcagni, Benvenuto Cellini (Medusa's head dated c. 1547), Agostino Busti, Bartolomeo Ammannati, Giacomo della Porta, Giambologna (Samson Slaying a Philistine c. 1562, his finest work outside Italy), Bernini (Neptune and Triton c. 1622–3), Giovanni Battista Foggini, Vincenzo Foggini (Samson and the Philistines), Massimiliano Soldani Benzi, Antonio Corradini, Andrea Brustolon, Giovanni Battista Piranesi, Innocenzo Spinazzi, Canova, Carlo Marochetti and Raffaelle Monti. An unusual sculpture is the ancient Roman statue of Narcissus restored by Valerio Cioli c1564 with plaster. There are several small scale bronzes by Donatello, Alessandro Vittoria, Tiziano Aspetti and Francesco Fanelli in the collection. The largest item from Italy is the Chancel Chapel from Santa Chiara Florence dated 1493–1500, designed by Giuliano da Sangallo it is 11.1 metres in height by 5.4 metres square, it includes a grand sculpted tabernacle by Antonio Rossellino and coloured terracotta decoration.|$|E
