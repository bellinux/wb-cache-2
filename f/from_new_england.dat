5|$|Boletus rubroflammeus is a {{mycorrhizal}} species, and its fruit bodies grow scattered or {{in groups}} on the ground under hardwood trees. The fungus fruits in summer and autumn months, and tends to appear after hot weather and heavy rains.

5|$|Boletus subluridellus is a {{mycorrhizal}} fungus, {{and grows}} {{in association with}} deciduous trees, especially oak (genus Quercus).

An eastern North American species, the mushroom is found <b>from</b> <b>New</b> <b>England</b> west to the Great Lakes, north to Quebec in Canada.|$|E

5|$|Lowell is {{considered}} one of the Fireside Poets, a group of writers <b>from</b> <b>New</b> <b>England</b> in the 1840s who all had a substantial national following and whose work was often read aloud by the family fireplace.

5|$|As {{a result}} of heavy {{immigration}} <b>from</b> <b>New</b> <b>England</b> and New York—regions where most major towns had originated as trading centers rather than political or manufacturing centers—many new settlements in Minnesota were laid out so as to heavily favor the business districts rather than the city halls or courthouses.

5|$|Entoloma murrayi, {{commonly}} known as the yellow unicorn Entoloma or the unicorn pinkgill, is a species of fungus in the Entolomataceae family. First described <b>from</b> <b>New</b> <b>England</b> (USA) in 1859, the species is found in eastern North America, Central and South America, and southeast Asia, where it grows on the ground in wet coniferous and deciduous forests. The fungus produces yellow mushrooms that have a characteristic sharp umbo {{on the top of a}} conical cap. The mushroom is inedible and may be poisonous. Other similar species can be distinguished from E.murrayi by differences in color, morphology, or microscopic characteristics.|$|E
5|$|Nonetheless, Alexander Twining and James Harrison set up ice {{plants in}} Ohio and Melbourne {{respectively}} during the 1850s, both using Perkins engines. Twining {{found he could}} not compete with natural ice, but in Melbourne Harrison's plant came to dominate the market. Australia's distance <b>from</b> <b>New</b> <b>England,</b> where journeys could take 115 days, and the consequent high level of wastage– 150 tons of the first 400-ton shipment to Sydney melted on route– made it relatively easy for plant ice {{to compete with the}} natural product. Elsewhere, however, natural ice dominated the entire market.|$|E
5|$|The {{alphabet}} {{was designed}} to be able to write all of the vowels used in the Received Pronunciation as still spoken in 19th century Utah.

As such, many of the vowels in the Deseret alphabet have since merged in the modern era: they are no longer distinguished in many dialects of English.|$|E

5|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} B.curtisii grow singly, scattered, {{or in small}} groups {{on the ground in}} {{coniferous}} or mixed woods, often with pines. Fruit bodies generally appear from August to November. The geographical distribution of the fungus is limited to eastern and southern North America. In the United States, it occurs <b>from</b> <b>New</b> <b>England</b> south to Florida, and west to Texas. The species was newly reported from Mexico in 2001.|$|E
5|$|The {{system that}} would become Hurricane Alicia {{originated}} from {{the western end of}} a frontal trough that stretched <b>from</b> <b>New</b> <b>England</b> to the Gulf of Mexico. Satellite pictures showed a meso-scale low pressure area that had moved off the Alabama and Mississippi coasts near the trough and was possibly the precursor system to Alicia. Pressures in the Gulf of Mexico were high and stayed high during the early development stages. On August 15, a ship recorded a minimal pressure of 1015millibars (29.99inHg), when the system was upgraded into Tropical Storm Alicia. With high environmental pressures around it, Alicia remained a small system.|$|E

5|$|The third type was the Canadian Pacer, {{which was}} {{historically}} better documented {{than the other}} two types. Canadian Pacers were likely the result of breeding pacing horses imported from France with Narragansett Pacers <b>from</b> <b>New</b> <b>England.</b> The resulting horses were known for their ability to race on ice. From there, they were exported to the United States, where North Carolina became a breeding center, later exporting them to Tennessee in the late 1700s. Pedigrees were not maintained, so early breeding histories are often impossible to trace. The Canadian Pacer influenced the Tennessee Walker, the American Saddlebred and the Standardbred.|$|E
5|$|In March 2015, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) {{received}} {{a request to}} reopen {{the investigation into the}} accident. The request was made by L. J. Coon, a retired pilot <b>from</b> <b>New</b> <b>England</b> who felt that the conclusion of the 1959 investigation was inaccurate. Coon suspected a possible failure of the right rudder, or a problem with the fuel system, as well as a possible improper weight distribution. Coon also argued that Peterson may have tried to land the plane and that his efforts should be recognized. In April 2015, the NTSB declined the request, citing that the evidence presented by Coon was insufficient to merit the reconsideration of the original findings.|$|E
5|$|James Garfield {{was born}} the {{youngest}} of five children on November 19, 1831, in a log cabin in Orange Township, now Moreland Hills, Ohio.

He instead wed her sister Eliza, who had been born in New Hampshire. James was named for an older brother, dead in infancy.|$|E

5|$|The {{international}} ice trade {{continued through}} {{the second half of}} the 19th century, but it increasingly moved away from its former, New England roots. Indeed, ice exports from US peaked around 1870, when 65,802 tons (59,288,000kg), worth $267,702 ($4,610,000 in 2010 terms), were shipped out from the ports. One factor in this was the slow spread of plant ice into India. Exports <b>from</b> <b>New</b> <b>England</b> to India peaked in 1856, when 146,000 tons (132 million kg) were shipped, and the Indian natural ice market faltered during the Indian Rebellion of 1857, dipped again during the American Civil War, and imports of ice slowly declined through the 1860s. Spurred on by the introduction of artificial ice plants around the world by the British Royal Navy, the International Ice Company was founded in Madras in 1874 and the Bengal Ice Company in 1878. Operating together as the Calcutta Ice Association, they rapidly drove natural ice out of the market.|$|E
5|$|The {{trade was}} started by the New England {{businessman}} Frederic Tudor in 1806. Tudor shipped ice to the Caribbean island of Martinique, hoping {{to sell it to}} wealthy members of the European elite there, using an ice house he had built specially for the purpose. Over the coming years the trade widened to Cuba and Southern United States, with other merchants joining Tudor in harvesting and shipping ice <b>from</b> <b>New</b> <b>England.</b> During the 1830s and 1840s the ice trade expanded further, with shipments reaching England, India, South America, China and Australia. Tudor made a fortune from the Indian trade, while brand names such as Wenham Ice became famous in London.|$|E
5|$|Although popular legends {{claim that}} Sable Island horses swam ashore from the island's many shipwrecks, or were {{introduced}} by 16th-century Portuguese explorers, {{this is not}} supported by historical or genetic evidence. In reality, the horses were deliberately introduced to the island during the 18th century. The first recorded horses were brought by a Boston clergyman, the Reverend Andrew Le Mercier, in 1737 but most were stolen by passing mariners. The present-day horses are thought by most historians and scientists to have descended mostly from horses seized by the British from the Acadians during the Expulsion of the Acadians. The Acadian horses were descendents of several shipments of French horses, including members of the Breton, Andalusian and Norman breeds, later crossed with horses <b>from</b> <b>New</b> <b>England,</b> including Spanish Barbs. The Boston merchant and shipowner Thomas Hancock purchased some Acadian horses and transported them to Sable Island in 1760, where they grazed the island as pasture. Although {{often referred to as}} ponies due to their small size, they have a horse phenotype and an ancestry composed solely of horses.|$|E
