The effect of <b>dimethylethanolamine</b> pretreatment on cholestasis induced by estradiol 17 beta-D-glucuronide, a potent cholestatic agent, was assessed in this study. <b>Dimethylethanolamine,</b> dissolved in sodium-taurocholate was infused intravenously (0. 3 mg/kg/min) for 15 hr. One group of control rats (estradiol 17 beta-D-glucuronide controls) received the bile salt only.

The estradiol 17 beta-D-glucuronide inhibitory effect on bile flow and biliary lipid secretion was significantly antagonized by <b>dimethylethanolamine</b> pretreatment. The maximum inhibition of bile flow was found 30 min after estradiol 17 beta-D-glucuronide administration, when it decreased from 3. 5 +/- 0. 4 microliters/min/ 100 gm (basal) to 0. 9 +/- 0. 3 microliters/min/ 100 gm in estradiol 17 beta-D-glucuronide controls, whereas in dimethylethanolamine-pretreated rats this decreased only from 3. 2 +/- 0. 4 (basal) to 2. 3 +/- 0. 4 microliters/min/ 100 gm. Bile flow and the biliary secretion of cholesterol, phosphatidylcholine and bile salts were significantly higher in the dimethylethanolamine-pretreated rats than in estradiol 17 beta-D-glucuronide controls (p less than 0. 02) during the cholestatic phase. The inhibitory effect of estradiol 17 beta-D-glucuronide on bile flow was associated with a marked decrease of membrane fluidity (p less than 0. 001) assessed by 1, 6 -diphenyl- 1, 3, 5 -hexatriene fluorescence anisotropy and with a cholesterol enrichment of microsomes, sinusoidal and canalicular liver plasma membranes and inhibition of sinusoidal Na+,K(+) -ATPase activity (p less than 0. 05). These membrane alterations persisted 180 min after estradiol 17 beta-D-glucuronide administration despite complete normalization of bile flow. <b>Dimethylethanolamine</b> pretreatment significantly counteracted the reduction of membrane fluidity (p less than 0. 001), the cholesterol enrichment and the inhibition of Na+,K(+) -ATPase (p less than 0. 05) promoted by estradiol 17 beta-D-glucuronide administration in all membrane subfractions 30 and 180 min after administration.

Two distinct cDNAs, designated GmCK 1 and GmCK 2, were recovered that possessed full-length reading frames, each sharing approximately 32 % identity at the predicted amino acid level with the rat choline kinase. A third unique choline kinase-like cDNA, GmCK 3, was also identified but was not full length. Heterologous expression of GmCK 1 in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and GmCK 2 in both yeast and Escherichia coli demonstrated that each encodes choline kinase activity.

With soybean (tissue culture or leaves), an initial methylation utilizes phosphoethanolamine as substrate, forming phosphomethylethanolamine. The latter is converted to phosphatidylmethylethanolamine, which is successively methylated to phosphatidyldimethyethanolamine and to phosphatidylcholine. With carrot, again, an initial methylation is of phosphoethanolamine. Subsequent methylations occur at both the phospho-base and phosphatidyl-base levels. Both of these patterns differ qualitatively from that previously demonstrated in Lemna (SH Mudd, AH Datko 1986 Plant Physiol 82 : 126 - 135) in which all three methylations occur at the phospho-base level.

Methods Advion microfluidic system was used for performing the synthesis and purification of [18 F]fluoromethyl, [18 F]fluoroethyl or [18 F]fluoropropyl choline employing a two-step approach, starting from the corresponding alkyl-ditosylate and reacting the [18 F]fluorotosylate obtained in the first step with neat <b>dimethylethanolamine.</b> The purification was obtained using a recyclable SPE cartridge set. Results The three products, fluoromethylcholine, fluoroethylcholine and fluoropropylcholine, were obtained in good to optimum yields (22 %- 54 % decay corrected) with a 15 -min procedure. The production could be restarted several times for producing each one of the tracers without decrease in yields and purities, in accordance with a dose-on-demand (DOD) approach. The final products were formulated in isotonic saline solution. Conclusion The described approach gives a proof of principle of the enhanced productivity obtainable using a microfluidic approach; in particular, the possibility to produce the reported tracers in a DOD fashion following a homogeneous synthetic and purification approach will foster further studies on the clinical evaluation of the best fluorocholine analogue for prostate cancer imaging without biasing for differences in radiochemical approach...|$|E
40|$|The obligate {{intracellular}} and promiscuous protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii {{needs an}} extensive membrane biogenesis {{that must be}} satisfied irrespective of its host-cell milieu. We show that the synthesis of the major lipid in T. gondii, phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho), is initiated by a novel choline kinase (TgCK). Full-length (∼ 70 -kDa) TgCK displayed a low affinity for choline (Km ∼ 0. 77 mM) and harbors a unique N-terminal hydrophobic peptide that {{is required for the}} formation of enzyme oligomers in the parasite cytosol but not for activity. Conditional mutagenesis of the TgCK gene in T. gondii attenuated the protein level by ∼ 60 %, which was abolished in the off state of the mutant (Δtgcki). Unexpectedly, the mutant was not impaired in its growth and exhibited a normal PtdCho biogenesis. The parasite compensated for the loss of full-length TgCK by two potential 53 - and 44 -kDa isoforms expressed through a cryptic promoter identified within exon 1. TgCK-Exon 1 alone was sufficient in driving the expression of GFP in E. coli. The presence of a cryptic promoter correlated with the persistent enzyme activity, PtdCho synthesis, and susceptibility of T. gondii to a choline analog, <b>dimethylethanolamine.</b> Quite notably, the mutant displayed a regular growth in the off state despite a 35 % decline in PtdCho content and lipid synthesis, suggesting a compositional flexibility in the membranes of the parasite. The observed plasticity of gene expression and membrane biogenesis can ensure a faithful replication and adaptation of T. gondii in disparate host or nutrient environments...|$|E
40|$|The {{potential}} of ferrate (Fe(VI)) oxidation to remove N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) precursors during water treatment was assessed. Apparent second-order rate constants (kapp) for {{the reactions of}} NDMA and its suspected precursors (dimethylamine (DMA) and 7 tertiary amines with DMA functional group) with Fe(VI) were determined {{in the range of}} pH 6 - 12. Four model NDMA precursors (dimethyldithiocarbamate, dimethylaminobenzene, 3 -(dimethylaminomethyl) indole and 4 -dimethylaminoantipyrine) showed high reactivity toward Fe(VI) with kapp values at pH 7 between 2. 6 × 102 and 3. 2 × 105 M- 1 s- 1. The other NDMA precursors (DMA, trimethylamine, <b>dimethylethanolamine,</b> dimethylformamide) and NDMA had kapp values ranging from 0. 55 to 9. 1 M- 1 s- 1 at pH 7. In {{the second part of the}} study, the NDMA formation potentials (NDMA-FP) of the model NDMA precursors and natural waters were measured with and without pre-oxidation by Fe(VI). For most of the NDMA precursors with the exception of DMA, a significant reduction of the NDMA-FP (> 95 %) was observed after complete transformation of the NDMA precursor. This result was supported by low yields of DMA from the Fe(VI) oxidation of tertiary amine NDMA precursors. Pre-oxidation of several natural waters (rivers Rhine, Neckar and Pfinz) with a high dose of Fe(VI) (0. 38 mM= 21 mg L- 1 as Fe) led to removals of the NDMA-FP of 46 - 84 %. This indicates that the NDMA precursors in these waters have a low reactivity toward Fe(VI) because it has been shown that for fast-reacting NDMA precursors Fe(VI) doses of 20 μM (1. 1 mg L- 1 as Fe) are sufficient to completely oxidize the precursors. close 373...|$|E
40|$|The {{oxidation}} of N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) precursors during {{water treatment}} was investigated using ozone and chlorine dioxide (CIO 2). Second-order rate constants for {{the reactions of}} model NDMA precursors (dimethylamine (DMA) and 7 tertiary amines) with ozone (kapp at pH 7 = 2. 4 × 10 - 1 to 2. 3 × 109 M- 1 s- 1), CIO 2 (kapp at pH 7 = 6. 7 × 10 - 3 to 3. 0 × 107 M- 1 s- 1), and hydroxyl radical (&# 775;OH) (kapp at pH 7 = 6. 2 × 107 to 1. 4 × 1010 M- 1 s- 1) were determined, which showed that the selected NDMA precursors, {{with the exception of}} dimethylformamide (DMFA) can be completely transformed via their direct reaction with ozone. During ozonation, DMFA may be partially transformed through oxidation by the secondary oxidant &# 775;OH. CIO 2 was also shown to effectively transform most of the precursors, with the exceptions of DMA and DMFA. In {{the second part of the}} study, the NDMA formation potentials (NDMA-FP) in synthetic and natural waters were measured with and without pre-oxidation with ozone and CIO 2. A significant reduction in the NDMA-FPs was observed after complete transformation of the model NDMA precursors. Ozonation generally led to more effective reduction of the NDMA-FP than CIO 2. For most of the precursors, the formation of DMA could account for the NDMA-FPs remaining after complete transformation of the model NDMA precursors. In contrast, <b>dimethylethanolamine</b> and dimethyldithio-carbamate yielded other NDMA precursors (not DMA) as their oxidation products. Pre-oxidation by ozone and CIO 2 of several natural waters showed behavior similar to that of the oxidation of model NDMA precursors with a reduction of the NDMA-FP by 32 - 94 % for various natural water sources. close 514...|$|E
40|$|We {{report the}} {{isolation}} of two new opi 3 mutants by EMS mutagenesis, and construction of an insertion allele in vitro using the cloned gene. We have demonstrated that the opi 3 mutations cause a deficiency in the two terminal phospholipid N-methyltransferase (PLMT) activities required for the de novo synthesis of PC (phosphatidylcholine). The opi 3 mutants, under certain growth conditions, produce membrane virtually devoid of PC although, surprisingly, none of the mutants displays a strict auxotrophic requirement for choline. Although the opi 3 mutants grow without supplements, we {{have shown that the}} atypical membrane affects the ability of the mutant strains to initiate log phase growth and to sustain viability at stationary phase. The commencement of log phase growth is enhanced by addition of choline or to a lesser extent DME (<b>dimethylethanolamine),</b> and retarded by addition of MME (monomethylethanolamine). The mutant cells lose viability at the stationary phase of the cell cycle in the absence of DME or choline, and are also temperature sensitive for growth at 37 ° especially in media containing MME. These growth defects have been correlated to the presence of specific phospholipids in the membrane. The opi 3 growth defects are suppressed by an unusual mutation in the phospholipid methylation pathway that perturbs the N-methyltransferase (PEMT) activity immediately preceding the reactions affected by the opi 3 lesion. We believe this mutation, cho 2 -S, alters the substrate specificity of the PEMT. A secondary effect of opi 3 mutations is disruption of the cross pathway regulation of the synthesis of the PI (phosphatidylinositol) precursor inositol. Synthesis of inositol is controlled through regulation of the INO 1 gene which encodes inositol- 1 -phosphate synthase. This highly regulated gene is expressed constitutively in opi 3 mutants. We have used the opi 3 strains to demonstrate that synthesis of either PC or PD (phosphatidyldimethylethanolamine) will restore normal regulation of the INO 1 gene...|$|E
40|$|Anandamide and the {{synthetic}} cannabimimetic drugs AM 404 and WIN 55, 212 - 2 {{were found to}} inhibit the binding of [3 H]batrachotoxinin A 20 -&# 61537;-benzoate (BTX) to voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs) and also to depress VGSC-dependent release of GABA and L-glutamic acid. These effects occur independently of CB- 1 receptor activation since they were not attenuated by AM 251 at concentrations known to antagonize CB- 1 receptors, although at higher concentrations AM 251 inhibited VGSCs also. These results suggest that anandamide and endocannabimimetics {{have the ability to}} depress synaptic transmission by reducing the capacity of VGSCs to support action potentials. In other experiments, I observed that anandamide is synthesized by both resting and depolarized synaptoneurosomes, however, data from filtration and superfusion experiments failed to support the hypothesis that depolarization activates the release of anandamide from these synaptic preparations, even though substantial quantities of anandamide were clearly present in the intracellular compartments. In these investigations, I unexpectedly found that [3 H]ethanolamine (a potential precursor of anandamide) is accumulated by synaptosomes and synaptoneurosomes during extended incubation and released (as [3 H]ethanolamine) in a calcium-dependent fashion during a depolarizing challenge with 30 mM KCl. Ethanolamine also stimulates the release of the pH fluoroprobe acridine orange (AO) from synaptosomes and decreases AO release when synaptosomes are depolarized with KCl. However, ethanolamine and other amino alcohols (methylethanolamine and <b>dimethylethanolamine)</b> stimulate resting and KCl-evoked release of [3 H]-D-aspartate from synaptosomes. All amino alcohols rapidly access synaptic vesicles where they sequester protons, thus accounting for AO efflux. Proton sequestration by amino alcohols increases the ATP-dependent transvesicular membrane potential which in turn enhances D-aspartate uptake into synaptic vesicles. My data suggest a potential role for ethanolamine and related amino alcohols in the regulation of synaptic vesicle filling and release of amino acid neurotransmitters. Depolarization evoked release of ethanolamine from synaptosomes supports the idea that this amino alcohol may also have an important postsynaptic role...|$|E
