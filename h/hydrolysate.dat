40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effect of in-vitro pepsin and pancreatin digestion of proteins extracted from Roselle seed on the production of bioactive peptides. Defatted Roselle seed flour was used to extract different protein fractions namely globulin, albumin and glutelin. The proteins were digested using pepsin (1 h) followed by pancreatin (1 h) in order to produce <b>hydrolysates</b> with good antioxidant activity. The prepared <b>hydrolysates</b> were as effective as antioxidants in model systems, in scavenging of free radicals and acting as reducing agents. This effect was concentration-dependent and was also influenced by the type of protein fraction. The albumin fraction <b>hydrolysates</b> prepared showed the highest antioxidant activity followed by Glutelin and Globulin <b>hydrolysates</b> respectively (Albumin hydrolysates>Glutelin hydrolysates>Globulin <b>hydrolysates).</b> All of the prepared <b>hydrolysates</b> were also found to be effective in enhancing water-holding capacity and cooking yield in a meat model system. Albumin <b>hydrolysates</b> showed the highest improved meat cooking ability followed by Glutelin and Globulin respectively (Albumin hydrolysates>Glutelin hydrolysates>Globulin <b>hydrolysates).</b> The molecular weight distribution analysis of the <b>hydrolysates</b> was determined and most of the peptides were found between 1000 Da and below.
