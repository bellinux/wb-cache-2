5000|$|An {{increasingly}} common and versatile measure of organizational <b>learning</b> is <b>an</b> organizational <b>learning</b> <b>curve</b> demonstrating experience <b>curve</b> <b>effects.</b> <b>A</b> <b>learning</b> <b>curve</b> measures {{the rate of}} <b>a</b> metric of <b>learning</b> relative to <b>a</b> metric for experience. Researcher Linda Argote explains that [...] "large increases in productivity typically occur as organizations gain experience in production." [...] However, Argote also notes that organizations' rates of learning vary. Argote identifies three factors that affect these rates: increased proficiency of individuals, improvements in an organization's technology, and improvements in its structure (such as its routines and methods of coordination). [...] Some organizations show great productivity gains while others show little or no gains, given {{the same amount of}} experience.The experience curves in Fig 1 plot the decreasing unit cost versus the total cumulative units produced, a common way to measure the effect of experience. The linear-linear input form on the left is transformed into the log-log form on the right to demonstrate that the proficiency increase correlates with experience.|$|R
40|$|Background. Cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and {{perioperative}} intraperitoneal chemotherapy (PIC) {{has been}} recognized as a treatment option for pseudomyxoma peritonei. This study reports the survival outcomes, clinicopathological prognostic factors, and <b>a</b> <b>learning</b> <b>curve</b> from <b>a</b> single institution's experience. Methods. Patients with pseudomyxoma peritonei underwent CRS and PIC, which was comprised of hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) and/or early postoperative intraperitoneal chemotherapy (EPIC), according to a standardized treatment protocol in our institution. Clinicopathological factors were analyzed to determine their prognostic value for survival using univariate and multivariate analysis. Time period comparison was performed to study the <b>effect</b> of <b>a</b> <b>learning</b> <b>curve.</b> Results. <b>A</b> total of 106 patients (43 men and 63 women) were treated. The mortality rate was 3 % and severe morbidity rate was 49 %. The median follow-up was 23 (range, 0 - 140) months. The overall median survival was 104 months with a 5 -year survival rate of 75 %. The progression-free survival was 40 months with a 1 -year progression-free survival rate of 71 %. Factors influencing survival include histopathological type of tumor, use of both HIPEC and EPIC, peritoneal cancer index, completeness of cytoreduction, and severe morbidity. The results demonstrate <b>a</b> <b>learning</b> <b>curve</b> where patients with a higher peritoneal cancer index (PCI) were treated, reduced amount of blood products required, more patients undergoing HIPEC and the combined HIPEC and EPIC, more redo-procedures performed, and a longer progression-free survival. Conclusions. This report demonstrates long-term survival outcomes, acceptable perioperative outcomes, and <b>a</b> <b>learning</b> <b>curve</b> associated with the treatment of patients with pseudomyxoma peritonei. 9 page(s...|$|R

We hand-searched reference lists of included studies. We included all randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials (e. g. study using alternation, date of birth, or case record number) that compare any ECTR with any OCTR technique. Safety was assessed by the incidence of major, minor and total number of complications, recurrences, and re-operations. The total time needed before return to work or to return to daily activities was also assessed. We synthesized data using a random-effects meta-analysis in STATA. We conducted a sensitivity analysis for rare events using binomial likelihood. We judged the conclusiveness of meta-analysis calculating the conditional power of meta-analysis. ECTR is associated with less time off work or with daily activities. The assessment of major complications, reoperations and recurrence of symptoms does not favor either of the interventions. There is an uncertain advantage of ECTR with respect to total minor complications (more transient paresthesia but fewer skin-related complications). Future studies are unlikely to alter these findings because of the rarity of the outcome.

40|$|The {{internet}} {{has become a}} more prominent part of people’s lives. Clickstream and other online data have enabled researchers to better understand consumers’ decision-making behavior {{in a variety of}} application areas. This dissertation focuses on using clickstream data in two application areas: the airline industry and the field of education. The first study investigates if airline passengers departing from or arriving to a multi-airport city actually consider itineraries at the airports not considered to be their preferred airport. It was found that customers do consider fares at multiple airports in multi-airport cities. However, other trip characteristics, typically linked to whether a customer is considered business or leisure, were found to have a larger impact on customer behavior than offered fares at competing airports. The second study evaluates airline customer search and purchase behavior near the advance purchase deadlines, which typically signify a price increase. Search and purchase demand models were constructed using instrumented two-stage least squares (2 SLS) models with valid instruments to correct for endogeneity. Increased demand was found before each deadline, even though these deadlines are not well-known among the general public. It is hypothesized that customers are able to use two methods to unintentionally book right before these price increases: (1) altering their travel dates by one or two days using the flexible dates tools offered by an airline’s or online travel agency’s (OTA) website to receive a lower fare, (2) booking when the coefficient of variation across competitor fares is high, as the dynamics of one-way and roundtrip pricing differ near these deadlines. The third study uses clickstream data in the field of education to compare the success of the traditional, flipped, and micro-flipped classrooms as well as their impacts on classroom attitudes. Students’ quiz grades were not significantly different between the traditional and flipped classrooms. The flipped classroom reduced the impact of procrastination on success. In the end, it was found that micro-flipped was most preferred by students as it incorporated several benefits of the flipped classroom without the <b>effects</b> of <b>a</b> <b>learning</b> <b>curve.</b> Ph.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Operation of hip {{resurfacing}} prosthesis is a technically demanding procedure {{accompanied by}} <b>a</b> <b>learning</b> <b>curve.</b> To our knowledge no objective data on this <b>learning</b> <b>curve</b> {{are available in}} the literature. METHODS: For the first 40 resurfacing hip prostheses implanted by a single-surgeon radiographic 'learning curve' analysis was performed. Optimal implant positioning on preoperative digital templating was compared with the eventual implant position postoperatively, measured by six establishes radiographic parameters and compared for four chronological cohorts of patients. RESULTS: <b>A</b> <b>learning</b> <b>curve</b> was clearly present and an optimal result was established in the last cohort. Pitfalls were a relatively steep cup position initially and a stem position in the posterior 1 / 3 of the collum. Besides marginal medialization a fully anatomic reconstruction of the center of rotation was achieved. CONCLUSION: In total hip resurfacing one should recognize the presence of <b>a</b> <b>learning</b> <b>curve.</b> This <b>learning</b> <b>curve</b> appears to be acceptable and a reproducible optimal implant positioning can be achieved quickly...|$|R
