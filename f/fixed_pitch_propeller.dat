25|$|The Merlin was {{designed}} by F.G. Miles of Philips and Powis, {{as a result of}} collaboration with G. Birkett of Birkett Air Service Ltd, and Tata Sons Ltd of India. It was based on the three-seat and four-seat versions of the M.3 Falcon, but with wider fuselage and consequent increased wing span. It was a low-wing monoplane, with fixed main undercarriage in trouser fairings plus a fixed tailwheel. Construction was mainly of wood, with spruce frames and three-ply birch covering, and the wings had hydraulically operated split flaps. It was powered by a 200hp de Havilland Gipsy Six piston engine. It was first designated M.4 Merlin, but all four examples were completed as M.4A Merlin, with <b>fixed</b> <b>pitch</b> <b>propeller</b> instead of the intended variable pitch unit.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the viability of}} a passive variable <b>pitch</b> <b>propeller</b> for small aerial Remotely Piloted Vehicles (RPV’s) and Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS’s) using a self adjusting mechanical pitch control mechanism. The work described in this paper includes the design and testing of a mechanical pitch change mechanism based on a constant torque spring for an off-the-shelf propeller. A propeller performance prediction code, based on the vortex lattice method, in combination with a genetic algorithm (GA) is used to optimize a propeller for given motor performance data. The optimization process includes results for both single point and multipoint design optimization efforts. Background <b>Fixed</b> <b>pitch</b> <b>propellers</b> have been used {{since the beginning of}} powered flight and are still used today because of their simplicity and weight advantage. One of the pitfalls of <b>fixed</b> <b>pitch</b> <b>propellers</b> is that they operate efficiently only at one propeller speed and one flight speed.
