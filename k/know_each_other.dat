5|$|The clique problem {{arises in}} the {{following}} real-world setting. Consider a social network, where the graph's vertices represent people, and the graph's edges represent mutual acquaintance. Then a clique represents a subset of people who all <b>know</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> and algorithms for finding cliques {{can be used to}} discover these groups of mutual friends. Along with its applications in social networks, the clique problem also has many applications in bioinformatics and computational chemistry.|$|E

5|$|William Shatner plays Captain James T. Kirk; Shatner {{felt that}} though dramatic, the script made Kirk look too prejudiced. Kirk's second-in-command, the Vulcan Spock, is portrayed by Leonard Nimoy. DeForest Kelley plays Leonard McCoy, the {{chief medical officer}} of the Enterprise; Kelley's {{appearance}} as the doctor in The Undiscovered Country was to be his last screen role. With Leonard Nimoy the film's executive producer, the 71-year-old Kelley was paid US$1million for the role, assuring a comfortable retirement for the veteran actor. Kelley and Shatner shot their prison scenes {{over the course of}} six to eight nights; the two actors got to <b>know</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> better than they ever had.|$|E
5|$|With a large {{construction}} programme, engineers made up 29.3% of Michaelmas Task Force. An Engineer Section headquarters was organised on 24 December 1943, {{only nine}} days before landing, consisting of five officers and five enlisted men. Later a jeep and a driver were {{borrowed from the}} 114th Engineer Battalion to provide transportation. The officers did not <b>know</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> and therefore were unaware of each other's capabilities. As it turned out, {{none of them had}} experience with amphibious operations, and only one had experience in airbase construction, although this was to be their most important task.|$|E
5|$|At this time, Jean-Paul-François de Noailles, Duc d'Ayen {{was looking}} to marry off some of his five daughters. The young Lafayette, aged 14, seemed a good match for his 12-year-old daughter, Marie Adrienne Françoise, and the duc spoke to the boy's {{guardian}} (Lafayette's uncle, the new comte) to negotiate a deal. However, the arranged marriage was opposed by the duc's wife, who felt the couple, and especially her daughter, were too young. The matter was settled by agreeing {{not to mention the}} marriage plans for two years, during which time the two spouses-to-be would meet {{from time to time in}} casual settings and get to <b>know</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> better. The scheme worked; the two fell in love, and were happy together from the time of their marriage in 1774 until her death in 1807.|$|E

He saw two people in a mid-sized gray carpossibly a Mercury Monarchmake a U-turn at the school bus stop where Dugard was waiting, and a woman forcing Dugard into the car. Probyn gave chase on a bicycle, {{but was unable to}} overtake the vehicle. Some of Dugard's classmates were also witnesses to the abduction. Initial suspects included Probyn and Slayton, though they did not <b>know</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> and Slayton had only had a brief relationship with Terry in 1979, not knowing he had a child. When Dugard was rescued, Slayton expressed an interest in meeting his daughter and taking a paternity test. Dugard refused. Probyn took and passed several polygraph tests, and Slayton was also quickly cleared of suspicion.|$|E

5|$|His signing by the Steelers {{caused a}} social media {{backlash}} by many Steeler fans, with some {{saying that they}} would never support the team again. Fans who supported or were indifferent about the signing called such fans fair weather fans, and also cited that the Steelers have several players with questionable pasts, most notably Roethlisberger and James Harrison. The Animal Rescue League of Western Pennsylvania made a subtle jab at the team on Twitter by saying that they were now more proud to support the Pittsburgh Penguins and subsequently moved an upcoming fundraiser event from Heinz Field to Consol Energy Center. Steelers president Art Rooney II defended the Vick signing on KDKA-TV, saying that they felt that Vick had proven himself since being released from prison. The Steelers had considered signing Vick in 2009—both Vick and Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin are from the same part of Virginia and <b>know</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> well personally—but decided against it due to potential backlash since Vick at the time hadn't proven himself following his release from prison.|$|E

His parents had married shortly before his father, {{a member of the}} American Expeditionary Force, left for the Western Front during World War I. The family moved to New Concord, Ohio, soon after his birth, and his father started his own plumbing company, the Glenn Plumbing Company.

While walking around the scene, she meets Mick and tells him he looks very familiar, but he insists that they do not <b>know</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> Beth gives the murder article a vampire theme, using the puncture wounds as inspiration. The article makes Josef, a 400-year-old vampire friend of Mick's, concerned for the safety of vampires. To get more information on the murder, Mick goes to the morgue, where his friend Guillermo (Jacob Vargas) supplies him with blood. Mick does not detect any traces of vampire contact on the dead woman, eliminating them as her reason of death. Mick then comes across Beth at the dead woman's apartment, where they find a necklace with a vial of blood inside.|$|E
5|$|Valene's {{bitterness}} {{over her}} mother's indifference, {{and the subsequent}} loss of Lucy is not resolved until 1979 when she and Gary move to Knots Landing. Much of this early backstory is told through flashbacks in episodes of Knots Landing, and is only briefly referenced in Dallas. While working in a diner in 1978, Valene decided to wait for Lucy outside her school and they got to <b>know</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> They stayed in {{contact with each other}} in secret for several months afterward. In the fall of 1978, Lucy arranges a reunion for her parents. Gary and Valene move back to Southfork for a short time, but their reunion is again undermined by J.R., who arranged for Gary to take charge of a failing company, hoping that the pressure would drive Gary away. Gary realized that he would fall off the wagon unless he left Southfork, so he departed. J.R. then turned on Valene, trying to bribe her, before ordering her to leave. In December 1979, Valene and Gary are reunited once more in Dallas, and get married for the second time. Gary's parents, Jock Ewing (Jim Davis) and Miss Ellie Ewing (Barbara Bel Geddes), as well as Gary's brother, Bobby (Patrick Duffy), and sister-in-law Pamela Barnes Ewing (Victoria Principal), attend the wedding. Shortly afterward, they move to California to live in a home that Miss Ellie had bought for them as a wedding gift. Valene also appears in the final episode of Dallas during J.R.'s dream, which showed how things would have turned out had J.R. never existed. In this dream, Val meets Gary for the first time when they are both middle aged and they take a liking to each other, highlighting the idea that Gary and Val were always destined to end up together one way or another.|$|E
