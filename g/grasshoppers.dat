5|$|In some countries, <b>grasshoppers</b> {{are used}} as food. In {{southern}} Mexico, <b>grasshoppers,</b> known as chapulines, are eaten {{in a variety of}} dishes, such as in tortillas with chilli sauce. <b>Grasshoppers</b> are served on skewers in some Chinese food markets, like the Donghuamen Night Market. Fried <b>grasshoppers</b> (walang goreng) are eaten in the Gunung Kidul Regency, Yogyakarta, Java in Indonesia. In Native America, the Ohlone people burned grassland to herd <b>grasshoppers</b> into pits where they could be collected as food.|$|E
5|$|<b>Grasshoppers</b> {{are also}} {{featured}} in cinema. The 1957 film Beginning of the End portrayed giant <b>grasshoppers</b> attacking Chicago. In the 1998 Pixar film A Bug's Life, the heroes are {{the members of}} an ant colony, and the lead villain and his henchmen are <b>grasshoppers.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Grasshoppers</b> exemplify a {{range of}} anti-predator adaptations, {{enabling}} them to avoid detection, to escape if detected, {{and in some cases}} to avoid being eaten if captured. <b>Grasshoppers</b> are often camouflaged to avoid detection by predators that hunt by sight; some species can change their coloration to suit their surroundings.|$|E

5|$|After rescuing the Queen, Flik deploys the bird; it {{initially}} fools the <b>grasshoppers,</b> but P.T. Flea, also mistaking {{it for a}} real bird, burns it, exposing it as a decoy. Hopper beats Flik {{in retaliation}} and says that the ants are humble and lowly life forms who live to serve the <b>grasshoppers.</b> However, Flik responds that Hopper actually fears the colony, because he has always known what they are capable of, inspiring the ants and the Circus Bugs to fight back against the <b>grasshoppers.</b> The ants attempt to force Hopper out of Ant Island, but it suddenly begins to rain. In the ensuing chaos, Hopper kidnaps Flik and flees. After the Circus Bugs fail to catch them, Atta rescues Flik. As Hopper pursues them, Flik lures him to the nest of the bird he, Dot, and the Circus Bugs encountered earlier. Thinking that the bird is another decoy, Hopper taunts it before discovering it is real, and is captured and fed to its chicks.|$|E

5|$|<b>Grasshoppers</b> are {{affected}} by diseases caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi and protozoa. The bacteria Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa have both been implicated in causing disease in <b>grasshoppers,</b> as has the entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana. This widespread fungus {{has been used to}} control various pest insects around the world, but although it infects <b>grasshoppers,</b> the infection is not usually lethal because basking in the sun has the result of raising the insect's temperature above a threshold tolerated by the fungus. The fungal pathogen Entomophaga grylli is able to influence the behaviour of its grasshopper host, causing it to climb {{to the top of a}} plant and cling to the stem as it dies. This ensures wide dispersal of the fungal spores liberated from the corpse.|$|E

5|$|Hippeastrum {{species are}} used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species {{including}} Spodoptera picta (Crinum grub) as well as Pseudococcidae (Mealybugs), large, and small narcissus bulb flies (Eumerus strigatus and E funeralis), thrips, mites, aphids, snails and slugs. A fungal disease attacking Hippeastrum is Stagonospora curtisii (red blotch, red leaf spot or red fire). The leaves are also eaten by <b>grasshoppers,</b> and <b>grasshoppers</b> commonly plant egg pods in the ground near Hippeastrum bulbs, which erupt in the spring, covering the plant with nymphs.|$|E
5|$|Male <b>grasshoppers</b> {{spend much}} of the day stridulating, singing more {{actively}} under optimal conditions and being more subdued when conditions are adverse; females also stridulate, but their efforts are insignificant when compared to the males. Late-stage male nymphs can sometimes be seen making stridulatory movements, although they lack the equipment to make sounds, demonstrating the importance of this behavioural trait. The songs are a means of communication; the male stridulation seems to express reproductive maturity, the desire for social cohesion and individual well-being. Social cohesion becomes necessary among <b>grasshoppers</b> because of their ability to jump or fly large distances, and the song can serve to limit dispersal and guide others to favourable habitat. The generalised song can vary in phraseology and intensity, and is modified {{in the presence of a}} rival male, and changes again to a courtship song when a female is nearby. In male <b>grasshoppers</b> of the family Pneumoridae, the enlarged abdomen amplifies stridulation.|$|E
5|$|Most <b>grasshoppers</b> are polyphagous, eating {{vegetation}} {{from multiple}} plant sources, {{but some are}} omnivorous and also eat animal tissue and animal faeces. In general their preference is for grasses, including many cereals grown as crops. The digestive system is typical of insects, with Malpighian tubules discharging into the midgut. Carbohydrates are digested mainly in the crop, while proteins are digested in the ceca of the midgut. Saliva is abundant but largely free of enzymes, helping to move food and Malpighian secretions along the gut. Some <b>grasshoppers</b> possess cellulase, which by softening plant cell walls makes plant cell contents accessible to other digestive enzymes.|$|E
50|$|Dactylotum bicolor, {{also known}} as the rainbow <b>grasshopper,</b> painted <b>grasshopper,</b> or the barber pole <b>grasshopper,</b> is a species of <b>grasshopper</b> in the family Acrididae.

5|$|The fungal {{pathogen}} Metarhizium acridum {{is found}} in Africa, Australia and Brazil where it has caused epizootics in <b>grasshoppers.</b> It is being investigated for possible use as a microbial insecticide for locust control. The microsporidian fungus Nosema locustae, once {{considered to be a}} protozoan, can be lethal to <b>grasshoppers.</b> It has to be consumed by mouth and is the basis for a bait-based commercial microbial pesticide. Various other microsporidians and protozoans are found in the gut.|$|E
5|$|The {{grasshopper}} nematode (Mermis nigrescens) {{is a long}} slender worm that infects <b>grasshoppers,</b> {{living in}} the insect's hemocoel. Adult worms lay eggs on plants and the host becomes infected when the foliage is eaten. Spinochordodes tellinii and Paragordius tricuspidatus are parasitic worms that infect <b>grasshoppers</b> and alter the behaviour of their hosts. When the worms are sufficiently developed, the grasshopper is persuaded to leap into a nearby body of water where it drowns, thus enabling the parasite {{to continue with the}} next stage of its life cycle, which takes place in water.|$|E
5|$|The {{most diverse}} {{superfamily}} is the Acridoidea, with around 8,000 species. The two main families in this are the Acrididae (<b>grasshoppers</b> and locusts) with a worldwide distribution, and the Romaleidae (lubber <b>grasshoppers),</b> found chiefly in the New World. The Ommexechidae and Tristiridae are South American, and the Lentulidae, Lithidiidae and Pamphagidae are mainly African. The Pauliniids are nocturnal and can swim or skate on water, and the Lentulids are wingless. Pneumoridae are native to Africa, particularly southern Africa, and are distinguished by the inflated abdomens of the males.|$|E

5|$|<b>Grasshoppers</b> are {{sometimes}} used as symbols, as in Sir Thomas Gresham's gilded grasshopper in Lombard Street, London, dating from 1563; {{the building was}} for a while {{the headquarters of the}} Guardian Royal Exchange, but the company declined to use the symbol for fear of confusion with the locust.|$|E
5|$|<b>Grasshoppers</b> eat large {{quantities}} of foliage both as adults and during their development, and can be serious pests of arid land and prairies. Pasture, grain, forage, vegetable and other crops can be affected. <b>Grasshoppers</b> often bask in the sun, and thrive in warm sunny conditions, so drought stimulates an increase in grasshopper populations. A single season of drought is not normally sufficient to stimulate a massive population increase, but several successive dry seasons can do so, especially if the intervening winters are mild so {{that large numbers of}} nymphs survive. Although sunny weather stimulates growth, there needs to be an adequate food supply for the increasing grasshopper population. This means that although precipitation is needed to stimulate plant growth, prolonged periods of cloudy weather will slow nymphal development.|$|E

5|$|<b>Grasshoppers</b> have a {{wide range}} of predators at {{different}} stages of their lives; eggs are eaten by bee-flies, ground beetles and blister beetles; hoppers and adults are taken by other insects such as ants, robber flies and sphecid wasps, by spiders, and by many birds and small mammals.|$|E
5|$|<b>Grasshoppers</b> {{have had}} a long {{relationship}} with humans. Swarms of locusts can have devastating effects and cause famine, and even in smaller numbers, the insects can be serious pests. They are used as food {{in countries such as}} Mexico and Indonesia.

5|$|In {{some very}} small insects, the venation may be greatly reduced. In Chalcidoidea (Chalcid wasps), for instance, only the subcosta {{and part of}} the radius are present. Conversely, an {{increase}} in venation may occur by the branching of existing veins to produce accessory veins or by the development of additional, intercalary veins between the original ones, as in the wings of Orthoptera (<b>grasshoppers</b> and crickets). Large numbers of cross-veins are present in some insects, and they may form a reticulum as in the wings of Odonata (dragonflies and damselflies) and {{at the base of the}} forewings of Tettigonioidea and Acridoidea (katydids and <b>grasshoppers</b> respectively).|$|E
