Based on a sample of 21 SSA countries these questions are addressed using Hsiao's Granger-causality. The results are the following.

40|$|The {{controversy}} surrounding {{the direction of}} causality between saving and <b>economic</b> <b>growth</b> motivated this study. The author employed the Granger-causality and co-integration techniques to analyze the relationship between saving and <b>economic</b> <b>growth</b> in Nigeria during the period 1970 - 2007. The Johansen co-integration test indicates that the variables (<b>economic</b> <b>growth</b> and saving) are co-integrated, and that a long-run equilibrium exists between them. In addition, the granger causality test reveals that causality runs from <b>economic</b> <b>growth</b> to saving, implying that <b>economic</b> <b>growth</b> precedes and granger causes saving. Thus, we reject the Solow’s hypothesis that saving precedes <b>economic</b> <b>growth,</b> and accept the Keynesian theory that t is <b>economic</b> <b>growth</b> that leads to higher saving.
