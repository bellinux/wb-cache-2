40|$|Abstract Occupational {{physicians}} are very often confronted with {{questions as to}} the fitness of the postural and locomotor systems, especially the spinal column. Occupational medical assessment and advice can be required by patients with acute symptoms, at routine check-ups, by persons who have problems doing certain jobs, and for <b>expert</b> <b>medical</b> <b>reports</b> as to the fitness of persons with chronic disorders or after operations. Therefore, for occupational medical purposes a physical examination must aim primarily to investigate functions and not structures or radiologic evidence. The physical examination should be structured systematically and according to regions of the body and, together with a specific (pain) anamnesis should {{provide a basis for}} the medical assessment. This paper presents a function-oriented system for physical examination of the locomotor system, named fokus (C) (F unktions o rientierte K oerperliche U ntersuchungs s ystematik, also available on DVD). fokus (C) has been developed with a view to its relevance for occupational medical practice and does not aim primarily to provide a precise diagnosis. Decisive for an occupational medical assessment of disorders of the musculoskeletal system is rather information about functional disorders and any impairment of performance or mobility which they can cause. The division of the physical examination into a rapid screening phase and a subsequent more intensive functional diagnostic phase has proved its practicability in many years of day-to-day use. Here, in contrast to the very extensive measures recommended for orthopaedic and manual diagnosis, for reasons of efficiency and usability of the system in routine occupational medical examinations the examination is structured according to the findings. So it is reduced to that which is most necessary and feasible. </p...|$|R

40|$|To {{operate a}} wheelchair, {{people with severe}} {{physical}} disabilities may require assistance, which can be provided by robotization. However, <b>medical</b> <b>experts</b> <b>report</b> that an excess of assistance may lead to loss of residual skills, {{so that it is}} important to provide just the right amount of assistance. This work proposes a collaborative control system based on weighting the robot's and the user's commands by their respective efficiency to reactively obtain an emergent controller. Thus, the better the person operates, the more control he/she gains. Tests with volunteers have proven, though, that some users may require extra assistance when they become stressed. Hence, we propose a controller that can change the amount of support taking into account supplementary biometric data. In this work, we use an off-the-shelf wearable pulse oximeter. Experiments have demonstrated that volunteers could use our wheelchair in a more efficient way due to the proposed biometric modulated collaborative control...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Cerebral {{ischemic stroke}} {{is a major}} reason for death in Germany and worldwide. Although lots of {{research}} has been done on longtime (3 hrs – 27 days) stroke growth, not much is known about the acute stroke growth. In this paper a method for the image based analysis and visualization of short-time infarct growth in murine model based on time resolved T 2 * MR image sequences is presented. After manual definition of initial healthy and infarct volumes the corresponding histograms are extracted and used for classification of the stroke tissues for every T 2 * image sequence. After automatic classification computed thresholds can beusedto 3 Dvisualizestrokegrowthdynamicallyandanalyzetheinfarct size over time. The method proposed was validated by <b>medical</b> <b>experts</b> in terms of visual comparison to histological images of the brains after stroke. The <b>medical</b> <b>experts</b> <b>reported</b> that the accuracy of the projected infarct size is sufficient for further analysis steps of infarct growth. In summary the method proposed can help to understand the evolution of strokes and may help to get new insights in this disease and improve the therapy for stroke patients in future. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Purpose To {{describe}} {{the pattern of}} ophthalmic medicolegal cases with emphasis on cases of assault, and to acquaint ophthalmologists with rules pertaining to <b>expert</b> testimony and <b>medical</b> <b>reports.</b> Methods A retrospective study was carried out to review files of 247 medicolegal cases from Upper Egypt seen by the senior author in 8 years. These were classified categorically and were analyzed from various characteristics and aspects. The scheme for examination of subjects and for formulating the medicolegal report is described. Results The different categories were assault in 224 cases (90. 5 %), military recruitment evasion in 8 cases (3. 25 %), occupational disability claims in 8 cases (3. 25 %) and medical malpractice in 7 cases (3 %). Thirty two cases (13 %) presented with alleged functional visual loss, of them 25 cases (10 %) were malingering. Traumatic lens subluxation or dislocation was seen in 37 (13. 5 %) cases and phthisis and atrophia bulbi was the presenting sign in 55 (22. 3 %) cases. Twenty percent of assault cases were females. There were no differences in incidence between the provinces in Upper Egypt. Assault tools inflicted injuries are described, {{as well as the}} outcome of these cases. Claims against military recruits could not be substantiated. Occupational claims for damages were false. Alleged medical negligence cases were rejected based on accepted standards of care and not on unexpected complications. Conclusion <b>Medical</b> <b>reports</b> have to be structured, detailed, accurate and unbiased. Data in this work are useful for statistical and planning purposes in the medicolegal domain. </p...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{represents}} an effort at making <b>expert</b> <b>medical</b> testimony, one {{field of the}} medical profession, more accessible to our junior medical colleagues. As there is no department for <b>expert</b> <b>medical</b> testimony at the Belgrade School of Medicine, neither textbooks on providing <b>expert</b> <b>medical</b> testimony, experiences and knowledge are not unified {{and have to be}} collected together from many sources. The work of the <b>medical</b> <b>expert</b> is not aimed at improving the health of a patient, but on the realization of a patient’s rights, which very often depend on the patient’s health. The <b>medical</b> <b>expert</b> confirms <b>medical</b> facts, which may be of legal significance, and, consequently represents a link between medicine and the law. The effects of that link also impinge into the financial sphere. <b>Expert</b> <b>medical</b> testimony is, therefore, an interdisciplinary activity and the <b>medical</b> <b>expert</b> must also have knowledge outside of medical science, in other words, knowledge of the potential legal significance of medical facts. The authors of this paper are professional <b>medical</b> <b>experts</b> and wanted to make precisely that knowledge, which falls outside of medicine but is essential in medical testimony, more accessible to their junior colleagues. This is knowledge of the rights on which their patients can rely from insurance companies (based on health or invalid insurance) or in court. Such knowledge can also help their patients with legal regulations, ethical principles, and establishing their legal rights...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Narrative <b>medical</b> <b>reports</b> {{do not use}} {{standardized}} terminology {{and often}} bring insufficient information for statistical processing and medical decision making. Objectives of the paper are to propose a method for measuring diversity in <b>medical</b> <b>reports</b> written in any language, to compare diversities in narrative and structured <b>medical</b> <b>reports</b> and to map attributes and terms to selected classification systems. Methods A new method based on a general concept of f-diversity is proposed for measuring diversity of <b>medical</b> <b>reports</b> in any language. The method is based on categorized attributes recorded in narrative or structured <b>medical</b> <b>reports</b> and on international classification systems. Values of categories are expressed by terms. Using SNOMED CT and ICD 10 we are mapping attributes and terms to predefined codes. We use f-diversities of Gini-Simpson and Number of Categories types to compare diversities of narrative and structured <b>medical</b> <b>reports.</b> The comparison is based on attributes selected from the Minimal Data Model for Cardiology (MDMC). Results We compared diversities of 110 Czech narrative <b>medical</b> <b>reports</b> and 1119 Czech structured <b>medical</b> <b>reports.</b> Selected categorized attributes of MDMC had mostly different numbers of categories and used different terms in narrative and structured reports. We found more than 60 % of MDMC attributes in SNOMED CT. We showed that attributes in narrative <b>medical</b> <b>reports</b> had greater diversity than the same attributes in structured <b>medical</b> <b>reports.</b> Further, we replaced each value of category (term) used for attributes in narrative <b>medical</b> <b>reports</b> by the closest term and the category used in MDMC for structured <b>medical</b> <b>reports.</b> We found that relative Gini-Simpson diversities in structured <b>medical</b> <b>reports</b> were significantly smaller than those in narrative <b>medical</b> <b>reports</b> except the "Allergy" attribute. Conclusions Terminology in narrative <b>medical</b> <b>reports</b> is not standardized. Therefore {{it is nearly impossible}} to map values of attributes (terms) to codes of known classification systems. A high diversity in narrative <b>medical</b> <b>reports</b> terminology leads to more difficult computer processing than in structured <b>medical</b> <b>reports</b> and some information may be lost during this process. Setting a standardized terminology would help healthcare providers to have complete and easily accessible information about patients that would result in better healthcare. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of the dissertation thesis has been the information-lexical analysis of Czech <b>medical</b> <b>reports</b> and the usability of international classification systems in the Czech healthcare environment. The analysis of <b>medical</b> <b>reports</b> {{has been based on}} the attributes of the Minimal Data Model for Cardiology (MDMC). Narrative <b>medical</b> <b>reports</b> and structured <b>medical</b> <b>reports</b> from the ADAMEK software application have been used. For the thesis SNOMED CT and ICD- 10 classification systems have been used. There has been compared how well attributes of MDMC are recorded in narrative and structured <b>medical</b> <b>reports.</b> The language analysis of the Czech narrative <b>medical</b> <b>reports</b> has been made. A new application for measuring diversity in <b>medical</b> <b>reports</b> written in any language is proposed. The application is based on the general concepts of diversities derived from f-diversity, relative f- diversity, self f-diversity and marginal f-diversity. The thesis has {{come to the conclusion that}} using a free text in <b>medical</b> <b>reports</b> is not consistent and not standardized. The standardized terminology would bring benefits to physicians, patients, administrators, software developers and payers and it would help healthcare providers as it could provide complete and easily accessible information that belongs to the process of [...] ...|$|R
