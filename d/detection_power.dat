50|$|Under ideal {{circumstances}} most detection {{techniques can}} be considered theoretically as interferometers and, as such, their ultimate sensitivities are all roughly equal. This is because, in all these techniques, interferometry is used to linearize the detection transfer function and when linearized, maximum sensitivity is achieved. Under these conditions, photon shot noise dominates the sensitivity and this is fundamental to all the optical detection techniques. However,the ultimate limit {{is determined by the}} phonon shot noise. Since the phonon frequency is many orders of magnitude lower than the photon frequency, the ultimate sensitivity of ultrasonic detection can be muchhigher. The usual method for increasing the sensitivity of optical detection is to use more optical power. However, the shot noise limited SNR is proportional to the square root of the total <b>detection</b> <b>power.</b> Thus, increasing optical power has limited effect, and damaging power levels are easily reached before achieving an adequate SNR.Consequently, optical detection frequent has lower SNR than non-optical contacting techniques. Optical generation (at least in the firmly thermodynamic regime) is proportional to the optical power used and itis generally more efficient to improve the generation rather than the detection (again the limit is the damage threshold).|$|E

Some quality practitioners questioned why the Six Sigma advocates claim {{it is necessary to}} add a 1. 5 [sigma] shift to the process mean when estimating process capability. Bothe [Bothe, D.

For small process mean shifts, it is beyond the control chart <b>detection</b> <b>power,</b> which results in overestimating process capability.

Consequently, our adjustments provide much more accurate capability calculation for gamma processes. For illustration purpose, an application example is presented. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In many {{sensor network}} applications, sensor nodes are {{deployed}} in open environments, and hence {{are vulnerable to}} physical attacks, potentially compromising the node's cryptographic keys.

In this paper, we propose a fuzzy logic for determining a security threshold value in the SEF based sensor networks.

In general, <b>power</b> <b>detection</b> methods are passive intensity-based interrogation schemes, where the spectral shift in the FBG due to the applied measurand is converted into a change in optical power due to the spectral properties of the light source.
