40|$|Hydrophobins {{are small}} surface active {{proteins}} produced by filamentous fungi. These proteins {{are famous for}} their potential to induce primary <b>gushing.</b> Primary <b>gushing</b> is an economically disastrous phenomenon which is provoked by the simultaneous presence of hydrophobins and gaseous CO 2 molecules in carbonated beverages. Although hydrophobins are well known for causing problems in the beverage industry, they could be useful in other technological domains and used as surfactants or emulsifiers, or for the immobilization of proteins and enzymes on solid surfaces, for surface coating of biomaterials and modification of electrodes. Based on {{the large numbers of}} applications of class II hydrophobins, the objective of this work is to study and analyse, both the positive and negative potentials of hydrophobins. First part {{of this study was to}} characterize the two class II hydrophobins: one is not yet being studied (HFB- 2 a- 2 from Trichoderma harzianum) and the other is being much investigated (HFBI from Trichoderma reesei). The second part of this study was to focus especially on <b>gushing</b> and the mechanisms behind solving <b>gushing</b> problem. As the new class II hydrophobin, HFB- 2 a- 2 from Trichoderma harzianum was selected and the characteristics of this hydrophobin were compared to those of HFBI from Trichoderma reesei. Both hydrophobins were extracted and purified from the mycelium of the fungi. Their surface activity and their ability to adhere to solid surfaces were studied. In both cases, HFB- 2 a- 2 was stronger than HFBI. Changes of the water contact angle were studied further for their adherence to the solid surfaces. HFB- 2 a- 2 showed higher ability to change the angle than HFBI. In order to analyse the differences between hydrophobins, their structure and self-assemblies were studied by Rosetta docking simulation. The results showed that HFB- 2 a- 2 has two hydrophobic patches while HFBI has only one. This indicates that such differences in the structure of these proteins result in different characteristics and it was concluded that HFB- 2 a- 2 is a better choice than HFBI to be used as a surface active molecule or for the covering of solid surfaces. Until now, not many class II hydrophobins have been characterized. In our group, the Centre for Microbial Malting Technology (M 2 T), KU Leuven, the characterization of new hydrophobins is in process and the objective is to develop a database with the different characteristics of these proteins. Such a database will be useful for the researchers to select the best hydrophobins for particular applications. Second part of this thesis was concentrating on the negative aspect of hydrophobins in the brewing industry. Since hydrophobins cause <b>gushing,</b> it is of high importance to solve this problem. First, the mechanism by which <b>gushing</b> is inhibited was further investigated. To this end, identified model substances were selected to study the mechanism of <b>gushing</b> inhibiting. For this, it was referred to the mechanism of <b>gushing</b> whichwas already explained in details by Deckers et al., 2012. They have demonstrated that <b>gushing</b> happens because of the interaction of gaseous CO 2 molecules with the hydrophobic patch of hydrophobins. Therefore, it was decided to select non-polar molecules in our study which will interact with hydrophobic patch (es) of hydrophobins. Through this interaction, gaseous CO 2 can no longer interact with the hydrophobins and consequently, <b>gushing</b> will be inhibited. This theory was confirmed by the decrease/ inhibition of <b>gushing</b> when specific non-polar molecules were added to hydrophobin HFBI. It was observed that the addition of some linear saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons with the same length as the hydrophobic patch of hydrophobins, inhibits <b>gushing.</b> In order to understand the mechanism of <b>gushing</b> inhibition and to characterize the interaction between hydrophobins and <b>gushing</b> inhibitors following techniques were used: Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Fiber Optic Surface Plasmon Resonance (FO-SPR), Quartz Crystal Microbalance (QCM) and particle size analysis. FTIR demonstrated that hydrophobins interact with non-polar molecules through non-bonded interactions. Moreover, the immobilization of hydrophobins on a solid surface using FO-SPR and QCM and subsequent interaction with <b>gushing</b> inhibitors indicated very clearly that there is a tendency between these molecules to interact together. Based on FTIR results, this interaction is not of a bonded type. Furthermore, particle size analysis revealed that non-polar molecules attach to hydrophobins and form larger particles which were not present before the addition. Since the interaction of hydrophobins with gaseous CO 2 is mainly responsible for <b>gushing</b> and these results indicate that non-polar molecules interfere with this interaction, the use of non-polar molecules is a solution for solving <b>gushing</b> problem. The effective non-polar molecules against <b>gushing</b> are the ones that are not potentially <b>gushing</b> inducers and have enough hydrophobicity to interact with hydrophobins. The next part of the study was concentrated on the application part of <b>gushing</b> inhibitors. A lipophilic hop extract antifoam was used to analyze the influence on <b>gushing</b> of beer. First, a hop extract antifoam was characterized and its influence on <b>gushing</b> provoked by HFBI was studied. Then the process for using this extract was optimized. The analysis of the hop extract antifoam by GC and GC-MS showed the presence of non-polar molecules, mainly long linear hydrocarbons and fatty acids. The saturated long linear hydrocarbons were <b>gushing</b> inducers while most of the fatty acids were unsaturated and did not induce <b>gushing.</b> Addition of the hop extract antifoam to sparkling water or wort containing hydrophobins, showed that this extract inhibited <b>gushing</b> of water and decreased <b>gushing</b> of wort. The addition to <b>gushing</b> beer had some influence. This indicates that when the hop extract antifoam is used to reduce <b>gushing,</b> the extract must be added before the interaction of hydrophobins and CO 2. After the hydrohobin-CO 2 complexes are formed, the hop extract antifoam is less active. The decreased <b>gushing</b> by hop extract antifoam is explained by the formation of an interface to which hydrophobins attach so that they are no longer available to interact with CO 2 and therefore, <b>gushing</b> is decreased. Furthermore, the hop extract antifoam was also evaluated in order to increase its interaction with hydrophobins. Since this extract provides a surface for hydrophobins to attach, by increasing the specific surface of the extract, higher numbers of hydrophobins will be attached and therefore, less <b>gushing</b> will occur. Better dispersion of the hop extract antifoam will increase the specific surface area. Further research was done to analyse the effect of better dispersion on the effect of hop extract antifoam against <b>gushing.</b> This was evaluated by using (1) high temperature, at the time of the addition of hop extract antifoam during mashing of malt, and (2) use of a magnetic field for dispersion. The addition of hop extract antifoam in the mashing step changed its properties which then became a <b>gushing</b> inducer. The high temperature in mashing breaks the hop extract antifoam matrix containing <b>gushing</b> inducer and inhibitor molecules. Since <b>gushing</b> inducers are the majority, they become available to physically interact with CO 2 molecules and induce <b>gushing.</b> As a result, addition of this extract should be limited to addition in a cold step of brewing. The magnetic field is used in some companies to disperse the hop extract antifoam, before entering the fermenters. The <b>gushing</b> potential of hydrophobins is decreased when the hop extract antifoam is first treated by magnet and then added to the wort. The best result is then obtained when only a low amount of the hop extract antifoam is treated and then added to the wort. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|When weather {{conditions}} are damp, barley crops can be infected by fungi that produce amphiphilic proteins called hydrophobins. We postulated that these hydrophobins contaminate CO 2 bubbles during beer carbonation or shaking. These molecules prevent the dissolution or redissolution of CO 2 and, thus, stabilize CO 2 bubbles. These bubbles contain energy (overpressure) that is released when the beverage container is opened, causing the simultaneous nucleation of many bubbles, {{which leads to}} primary <b>gushing.</b> In this paper, we present validation of our hypothesis and show that dynamic light scattering (DLS) {{can be used as}} a tool to study the primary <b>gushing</b> phenomenon. The results indicate that both hydrophobins and CO 2 are necessary to induce <b>gushing.</b> Indeed, addition of a crude mycelium extract containing hydrophobin HFBI to different beverages such as beer, soda, and sparkling water led to <b>gushing,</b> whereas addition to still mineral water did not. Comparison of a commercial <b>gushing</b> and nongushing beer using DLS revealed the presence of particles with a diameter of approx. 100 nm in the <b>gushing</b> beer.

40|$|Primary <b>gushing</b> is the {{spontaneous}} wild and uncontrolled over-foaming {{due to the}} presence of hydrophobins in over-carbonated beverages. <b>Gushing</b> can only be observed while opening the bottled over-carbonated beverages and can thus cause significant economic losses to the manufacturer. Hydrophobins are proteins produced by filamentous fungi that infect barley when it is harvested during damp conditions. A consensus has now been reached regarding the mechanism of primary <b>gushing.</b> We postulate that hydrophobins contaminate CO 2 nanobubbles formed during carbonation of the beverage or subsequent shaking of the bottle, preventing the re-dissolution of CO 2 and thus stabilizing the CO 2 nanobubbles.

40|$|<b>Gushing</b> is the {{vigorous}} overfoaming of carbonated beverages when the bottle is opened.

The influence of hop oil antifoam on primary <b>gushing</b> showed a complete suppressing effect in sparkling water, a decreasing effect in wort, and no influence on gushing-positive beers. This shows the importance of the critical point of addition of this product in the brewing process. GC and GC-MS analysis show that commercial available lipophilic hop extract comprises fatty acids, either saturated fatty acids (SFA) or unsaturated fatty acids (UFA) (both free and incorporated in mono-, di-, and triglycerides), waxes (long-chain alkanes), and steroid compounds. <b>Gushing</b> analysis of each compound showed that SFA and UFA behave in a different manner regarding <b>gushing.</b> In contrast to SFA and trans-form UFA, cis-form UFAs do not induce <b>gushing.</b> Long-chain alkanes provide sufficient hydrophobic structures to interact with gaseous CO 2 molecules and induce <b>gushing.</b> Because hop antifoam molecules are hydrophobic, they interact with hydrophobins and prevent interaction with CO 2 and,consequently, inhibit the possibilities of development of the explosive nanobubble structure. status: publishe...|$|R
