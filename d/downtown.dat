40|$|A recent Gallup Poll {{discovered}} a significant {{link between the}} emotional attachment residents feel toward their community and the economic growth of that community. The more emotionally attached residents are to their community, {{the more likely they}} will stay there – and spend their money there. The synergistic relationship between successful <b>downtowns</b> and their host community is powerful. <b>Downtowns</b> play instrumental roles in creating communities that people will choose to live in, while people living in and near <b>downtowns</b> help sustain an economically vibrant business environment. This article will discuss the role of <b>downtowns</b> in creating these important place-based attachments. The Gallop results will be compared with two additional surveys to test whether these findings are equally relevant for small and large communities and their <b>downtowns.</b> Special attention will be given to attracting and retaining young people, as the loss of young people is a common problem facing many communities. “Soul of the Community” can offer public places where everyone feels welcome, where social interactions easily occur and where people truly enjoy their surroundings. Research consistently supports the importance of <b>downtowns</b> in attracting residents to their communities. This may be especially true for young, creative people. Richard Florida states that creative people “gravitate to stimulating creative environments … where they feel they can express themselves and validate their identities”. Rebecca Ryan writes “you must have a city … that captures (young peoples’) sensibilities, matches their values, and attracts and engages them ” through density, diversity, and stroll districts.

The 1958 numbering plan for Michigan submitted by the State Highway Department had this route initially marked as I-73. William Swanson in the MDOT Highway Planning Unit later stated that the department also planned to reverse the numbering of I-75 and I-275 between Newport and Davisburg; I-75 would have bypassed <b>downtown</b> Detroit just as it bypassed <b>downtown</b> Flint and <b>downtown</b> Saginaw to the north, and the auxiliary number (I-275) would have been used on the freeway through <b>downtown</b> Detroit.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} highway {{designation}} and routing {{changes in the}} Pontiac were made when US10 was shifted out of <b>downtown</b> to replace M-58 along Telegraph Road west of <b>downtown</b> {{by the middle of}} 1961.

After the change, US10 turned south from Dixie Highway onto Telegraph and then east onto Square Lake to connect back to Woodward. The old route through <b>downtown</b> was assigned the Bus. US10 moniker and M-58 was decommissioned as a highway designation. Two years later, I-75 was completed to the east of Pontiac, and the M-24 bypass of the city was turned over to local control.
