50|$|A common {{misconception}} is that thermal pads are {{for creating}} a more comfortable sleeping or picnic spot. This is what gives rise to their other name 'ground pads'. In fact, {{the purpose of the}} thermal pad is to prevent the loss of body heat into the ground while sleeping. The <b>foam</b> <b>pad,</b> which is filled with air bubbles, slows down the conduction of heat through the pad since air {{is one of the best}} (and cheapest) insulators.|$|E

5000|$|In 1980 a loop {{was built}} into a covered water slide at Action Park in Vernon, New Jersey. Riders were warned to descend with their legs crossed and arms across the chest to {{traverse}} the loop safely. Many ignored this instruction and either got stuck atop the loop (requiring {{the construction of an}} access hatch to free them), or injured themselves, or both. It was closed after a month, and would open at somewhat random intervals until around 1995. Action Park closed in 1996, and the slide was dismantled soon afterward. As of 2012, no other vertical looping water slides have opened at any parks.

50|$|A bouldering mat or {{crash pad}} is a <b>foam</b> <b>pad</b> used for {{protection}} when bouldering. There are various sizes and makes, {{but the most}} common type is a folded mattress, 8 - 10 cm thick, that when unfolded measures about 1 by 1.3 m. Most of bouldering mats often have shoulder straps so as to easily move it between boulders. Bouldering mats often come in either dual or triple density foam inners to provide differing levels of support with the bottom or middle being the softer. With the higher density foam at the top this will prevent the climber's foot from sinking through the foam and either gaining impact on the ground or getting a foot stuck in the mat which would increase the chance of injury. Mats are often used to cover dangerous sections of the ground below a chosen climb such as protruding rocks or grass tufts.|$|E
5000|$|The SX2 and The Extender were {{designed}} and manufactured by Mark McLaughlan (adopted surname - changed {{back to his}} birth name, Mark Grant, in 1997) between the early 1980s and early 1990s. [...] McLaughlan, a Boston area nightclub DJ {{came up with the}} design to make 7" [...] discs easier to handle when mixing. The original design (The Extender) was made up of a platter die-cut from sheets of plastic that McLaughlan would drive on the hood of his car from the supplier in Cambridge, MA to the die-cutter in Ipswich, MA. He would then do the final assembly (bonding a lathe cut acrylic center piece and a <b>foam</b> <b>pad)</b> and packaging by hand. The SX2 (Single Extender, Rev 2) was manufactured by plastic injection at Spirit, Inc. in Wakefield, Massachusetts. One of the main design revisions required for the manufacturing process was a series of 'ribs' {{on the underside of the}} platter to prevent warping from the extreme changes in temperature during the plastic injection process. McLaughlan also incorporated a raised barrier to contain the head (in the event of miscuing) and a polished surface inside the barrier to minimize damage to the stylus. Due to its limited manufacturing run the SX2 has become a sought after rarity among pro DJs.|$|E
40|$|A simple {{alternative}} {{technique has}} been devised protecting delicate equipment against electrostatic discharge (ESD) in settings in which workers wear communication headsets. In the original {{setting in which}} the technique was devised, the workers who wear the headsets also wear anti-ESD grounding straps on their wrists. The alternative technique {{eliminates the need for}} the wrist grounding straps by providing for grounding through the headsets. In place of the electrically insulating <b>foam</b> <b>pads</b> on the headsets, one installs pads made of electrically conductive foam like that commonly used to protect electronic components. Grounding wires are attached to the conductive <b>foam</b> <b>pads,</b> then possibly to the shielding cable which may be grounded to the backshell on the connector. The efficacy of this technique in protecting against ESD has been verified in experiments. The electrical resistance of the pads is a few megohms - about {{the same as that of}} a human body between the fingers of opposite hands and, hence, low enough for grounding. The only drawback of the technique is that care must be taken to place the <b>foam</b> <b>pads</b> in contact with the user s skin: any hair that comes between the <b>foam</b> <b>pads</b> and the skin must be pushed aside because hair is electrically insulating and thus prevents adequate grounding...|$|R

40|$|To {{evaluate}} postural {{control and}} performance in subjects with Down syndrome (SwDS), we measured postural sway (COP) in quiet stance in four 20 -second tests: with eyes open or closed and on hard or foam surface. Ten SwDS and eleven healthy subjects participated, aged 29. 8 (4. 8) and 28. 4 (3. 9), respectively. The time-series recorded with the sampling rate of 100 Hz were used to evaluate postural performance (COP amplitude and mean velocity) and strategies (COP frequency, fractal dimension and entropy). There were no intergroup differences in the amplitude except the stance on <b>foam</b> <b>pad</b> with eyes open when SwDS had larger sway. The COP velocity and frequency were larger in SwDS than controls in all trials on <b>foam</b> <b>pad.</b> During stances on the <b>foam</b> <b>pad</b> SwDS increased fractal dimension showing higher complexity of their equilibrium system, while controls decreased sample entropy exhibiting more conscious control of posture {{in comparison to the}} stances on hard support surface. This indicated that each group used entirely different adjustments of postural strategies to the somatosensory challenge. It is proposed that the inferior postural control of SwDS results mainly from insufficient experience in dealing with unpredictable postural stimuli and deficit in motor learning...|$|E
40|$|The rate of hip {{fractures}} due to falls {{increases with}} age. External hip protectors {{placed over the}} greater trochanter can prevent hip fractures, but the willingness to wear such protective devices is rather low. Most of the commercially available hip protectors consist either of an energy-absorbing <b>foam</b> <b>pad</b> or of a hard shell that distributes the load to the surrounding tissue. In the present study, a fibre-reinforced shell composed of three curved strips bonded with a ring, was designed and lined with shock absorbing foam. The development of the new shell design was based on quasi-static and impact tests of manufactured shells in combination with finite element simulations. The results of the numerical analysis showed the potential protection effect of the shell and indicated how the design can be further improved. First impact tests on an anatomical hip model showed promising results of the new protector shell in combination with a <b>foam</b> <b>pad...</b>|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{multimodal}} {{approach is}} commonly applied to improve knee swelling after total knee arthroplasty. Although {{the use of}} a knee compression pad may improve knee swelling, its impact in the multimodal protocol remains unclear. Methods: A total of 57 knees were {{randomly assigned to one of}} 2 groups receiving treatment with either a compression dressing using a polyethylene <b>foam</b> <b>pad</b> designed to effectively compress the postoperative knee combined with an elastic bandage or a compression dressing with use of an elastic bandage only. All patients were treated with the multimodal approach, including an external cooling system, intravenous tranexamic acid, no pneumonic tourniquet, and periarticular multidrug injection. Results: In intention-to-treat analysis, the circumferences of the thigh measured on postoperative days 1 and 7 were not significantly different between the 2 groups. In addition, there were no differences between the 2 groups in knee flexion angle, perioperative total blood loss, or complication rate. Conclusions: The polyethylene <b>foam</b> <b>pad</b> had no significant beneficial effect on knee swelling in patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty using the multimodal approach...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) is {{currently}} {{defined as a}} group of diseases with progressive cerebellar syndrome, which manifests distinctively by ataxic stance and gait. In patients with SCA, deterioration of postural control occurs due to changes of pathophysiological degenerative nervous system. Control of postural stability is significantly influenced by somatosensory afferentation of soft tissue of foot. The work objective is to determine the effect of deep foot massage on postural stability in the group of patients and to compare obtained results with experiments without deep foot massage. Methods: Seven patients of the Clinic Rehabilitation at the Faculty Hospital, Prague Motol (average age 51. 9 ± 13. 9 years, 5 men, and 2 women) with SCA and clinical signs of cerebellar ataxia were participated in this study. All patients were examined using posturography before and after application of deep foot massage. Measurements were conducted on a firm surface, <b>foam</b> <b>pad</b> with open and closed eyes. Length of COP trajectory, COP area and COP velocity were measured. Results: Significantly lower values of the length and COP velocity were found on the <b>foam</b> <b>pad</b> with closed eyes, when the deep foot massage was applied. Experiments without applications of the deep foot massage did not show any [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Experimental objective. To {{provide a}} safe, simple, {{relatively}} inexpensive, fast, accurate way of quantifying balance performance either in isolation, {{or in the}} face of challenges provided by 3 D high definition moving visual stimuli {{as well as by the}} proprioceptive challenge from standing on a <b>foam</b> <b>pad.</b> This method uses the new technology of the Wii balance board to measure postural stability during powerful, realistic visual challenges from immersive virtual reality. Limitations of current techniques. Present computerized methods for measuring postural stability are large, complex, slow and expensive, and do not allow for testing the response to realistic visual challenges. Protocol. Subjects stand on a 6 cm thick, firm, <b>foam</b> <b>pad</b> on a Wii balance board. They wear a fast, high resolution, low persistence, virtual reality head set (Oculus Rift DK 2). This allows displays of varying speed, direction, depth and complexity to be delivered. The subject experiences a visual illusion of real objects fixed relative to the world, and any of these displays can be perturbed in an unpredictable fashion. A special app (Balance Rite) used the same procedures for analysing postural analysis as used by the Equitest. Power of the technique. Four simple proof of concept experiments demonstrate that this technique matches the gold standard Equitest in terms of the measurement of postural stability but goes beyond the Equitest by measuring stability {{in the face of}} visual challenges, which are so powerful that even healthy subjects fall. The response to these challenges presents an opportunity for predicting falls and for rehabilitation of seniors and patients with poor postural stability. Significance for the field. This new method provides a simpler, quicker, cheaper method of measurement than the Equitest. It may provide a new mode of training to prevent falls, by maintaining postural stability in the face of visual and proprioceptive challenges similar to those encountered in life...|$|E
