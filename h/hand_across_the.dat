25|$|The sweep {{method is}} quick {{and works in}} most cases, as the DV usually just drops down on the diver's right side. In this method the diver is usually face down to upright, and sweeps the right <b>hand</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> waist from left to right, around to the back, {{in contact with the}} body or scuba set, and round as far back as {{possible}} against the cylinder, the straightens the arm backwards and swings it around outwards and forwards in an arc until it is pointing forwards. This will normally capture the hose {{to the front of the}} arm, where the left hand can find it by sweeping along the arm from the right hand to the neck. This method will fail if the DV has been swept over to the left side of the cylinder.|$|E

2500|$|Hand {{quilting}} is {{the process}} of using a needle and thread to sew a running stitch by <b>hand</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> entire area to be quilted. This binds the layers together. A quilting frame or hoop is often used to assist in holding the piece being quilted off the quilter's lap. A quilter can make one stitch at a time by first driving the needle through the fabric from the right side, then pushing it back up through the material from the wrong side to complete the stitch; this is called a stab stitch. Another option is called a rocking stitch, where the quilter has one hand, usually with a finger wearing a thimble, on top of the quilt, while the other hand is located beneath the piece to push the needle back up. A third option is called [...] "loading the needle" [...] and involves doing four or more stitches before pulling the needle through the cloth. Hand quilting is still practiced by the Amish and Mennonites within the United States and Canada, and is enjoying a resurgence worldwide.|$|E
