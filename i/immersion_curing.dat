40|$|There {{are a lot}} of {{arguments}} on which method of curing concrete gives good strength. These different opinions results into this study, which aim at investigating the effects of different curing methods on the strength of concrete. Laboratory test was employed for this study. Normal concretes were prepared using specified mix ratio of 1 : 2 : 4 and 1 : 3 : 6. The cubes tested for compressive strength at 3, 7, 21, and 28 days of curing respectively using four curing methods namely immersion, sprinkling, polythene sheeting and sharp sand coating. Testing indicate that water <b>immersion</b> <b>curing</b> method as well as sprinkling (spraying) methods of curing, provide better results than membrane (polythene sheeting) method of curing. While sharp sand gives least strength. The rate of drying was significant when the specimens were subjected to curing with polythene sheet method of curing. This thus hampered the hydration process and thus affected the compressive strength property of the hardened concrete. The overall findings of this study suggests that concrete should be cured by water immersion or spraying regularly to achieve a better compressive strength in concrete...|$|E
40|$|Novel hybrid sol-gel {{coatings}} {{have been}} developed for aluminum alloys {{as an alternative to the}} restricted use of chromate conversion coatings. They were prepared from two individual sols: zirconium tetrapropoxide (ZTP) and methacrylic acid (MAA) were added to siloxane sol prepared by mixing tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) and organically modified silica 3 -methacryloxypropyl trimethoxysi-lane (MAPTMS). The mixtures were deposited on alloy AA 7075 -T 6 substrate and cured in air under daylight at room temperature or at 100 ◦C without the addition of photo-initiator. Different molar ratios of ZTP and MAA were investigated, as well as the effects of curing temperature and aging time. The corrosion behavior of the coated alloy was examined by electrochemical potentiodynamic measurements and six-month immersion tests in Harrison’s solution, which simulates aircraft conditions. The coatings provided excellent corrosion protection in the atmospheric region and at high anodic potentials up to 7 V, as well as effective protection during long-term <b>immersion.</b> <b>Curing</b> under daylight improved the corrosion properties compared to curing in the dark. The corrosion behavior of synthesized coatings was compared to standard chromate coatings, including primer and topcoat. The morphology of the coatings was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy, and their adhesion to aluminum alloy surface measured using the X-cross cut test. © The Author(s) 2014. Published by ECS.

40|$|The {{results of}} a study on sulfate {{resistance}} of early opening-to-traffic concretes with accelerating admixture, also known as fast-track concretes (FTC), are presented. A total of 11 concretes made with four different cement factors and three different cement types were investigated at both opening and maturity (28 days) ages. Upon curing, the test samples were immersed in a 5 % sodium sulfate solution. Length change, mass loss, and compressive strength were monitored {{for a period of}} 270 days to evaluate the performance of the test specimens exposed to severe sulfate attack. The influence of <b>immersion</b> period, <b>curing</b> age and cement type and factor on bulk characteristics and sulfate resistance were evaluated. The study produced FTC with excellent sulfate resistance. Length change of FTC incorporating accelerating admixture increased with increasing immersion age and stabilized within 3 months from initial contact.

40|$|Abstract: Self-Compacting Concrete (SCC) {{is highly}} {{workable}} concrete with high strength and high performance that can flow {{under its own}} weight through restricted sections without segregation and bleeding. SCC is achieved by reducing the volume ratio of aggregate to cementitious materials, increasing the paste volume and using various viscosity enhancing admixtures and superplasticizers. It is observed that the behaviour of the design concrete mix is significantly affected by variation in humidity and temperature both in fresh and hardened state. In this paper effect of three non-water-based curing techniques on mechanical properties such as compressive strength, split tensile strength, flexural strength and shear strength of M 30 grade self-compacting concrete (SCC) is discussed. For compressive strength {{it is observed that}} <b>immersion</b> method for <b>curing</b> gives maximum compressive strength while the lowest compressive strength is for no curing. Polyethylene film curing gives second highest strength at 28 days. Similarly for split tensile strength, flexural strength & shear strength, the maximum strength is also with <b>immersion</b> method of <b>curing.</b> For split tensile strength curing compound gives almost at par with immersion method while no curing has least strength. Polyethylene film curing gives good results for flexural strength. For shear strength Polyethylene film gives about 82 % of immersion strength. It is concluded that although pond immersion method is best for curing, Polyethylene film and curing compound can deliver more than 90 % compressive and other strengths compared to immersion method...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- Curing is {{essential}} if concrete is {{to perform the}} intended function over the design life of the structure while excessive curing time {{may lead to the}} escalation of the construction cost of the project and unnecessary delays. Where there is a scarcity of water and on sloping surfaces where curing with water is difficult and in cases where large areas like pavements have to be cured, the use of curing compound may be resorted to. The parameters of the study include the curing period [3, 7, 28 and 56 day], curing method [Air <b>curing,</b> plastic films, <b>immersion</b> under water] and the type of cement [Portland pozzolona Cement(PPC) 43 grade,]. In this study specimens i. e. cube, cylinders, Beams were cast and cured under different conditions before testing. Test curing by air, nearly the same results as that of Plastic film but by <b>immersion</b> under water <b>curing</b> strength increase by age. The study demonstrates that the method and duration of curing greatly affects the strength characteristics of concrete. Hence quality control for proper field curing is of the utmost importance. From the test results, it was observed that there was an increase of 41. 7 percent, 31. 7 percent and 42. 1 percent in compressive strength at 7 days when compared to its strength at 3 days for specimens air cured, cured with plastic film and <b>immersion</b> under water <b>curing</b> respectively. On further curing a decrease as compressive strength at 28 days compared to its strength at 7 days was observed for air curing and plastic film curing. The percentage decrease was higher for air cured specimens than plastic film cured specimens. For water curing an increase of 61 percent of compressive strength at 28 days over its strength at 7 days was observed. There was also increase of 40. 2 percent, 52. 61 percent and 30. 72 percent in compressive strength at 56 days when compared to its strength at 3 days for all specimens...|$|R

40|$|Soil such as soft clay is a {{material}} with low strength and easily affected by water {{but it will}} be strong in dry condition. When water is added to the clay, it will flow like liquid. Unstable clay soils often create problematic situations for engineers as the soil do not provide enough strength to support the loads of the constructions upon them. Therefore, lime stabilization is one of the commonest methods of soil stabilization. A little addition of lime percentages can stabilize the clay soil by enhancing the engineering properties of the soil to improve the construction materials. This study involves the clay sample which is taken from Kampung Kedaik Asal, Rompin site and evaluation of its properties in natural state and after lime stabilization. The main objective {{of this paper is to}} estimate the optimum hydrated lime content (OLC) needed to stabilize the soil by using Eades-Grim pH Test, to determine the optimum moisture content (OMC) and maximum dry density (MDD) of the treated soil by Standard Proctor Test and also the strength value of the soil specimens with different percentages of lime content corresponding with different curing period by Unconfined Compressive Strength (UCS) Test.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} curing rate on softening in ethanol, degree of conversion, and wear of resin composites. METHOD: With a given energy density and for each of two different light-curing units (QTH or LED), the curing rate was reduced by modulating the curing mode. Thus, the irradiation of resin composite specimens (Filtek Z 250, Tetric Ceram, Esthet-X) was performed in a continuous curing mode and in a pulse-delay curing mode. Wallace hardness {{was used to determine}} the softening of resin composite after storage in ethanol. Degree of conversion was determined by infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Wear was assessed by a three-body test. Data were submitted to Levene's test, one and three-way ANOVA, and Tukey HSD test (alpha = 0. 05). Results: <b>Immersion</b> in ethanol, <b>curing</b> mode, and material all had significant effects on Wallace hardness. After ethanol storage, resin composites exposed to the pulse-delay curing mode were softer than resin composites exposed to continuous cure (P< 0. 0001). Tetric Ceram was the softest material followed by Esthet-X and Filtek Z 250 (P< 0. 001). Only the restorative material had a significant effect on degree of conversion (P< 0. 001) : Esthet-X had the lowest degree of conversion followed by Filtek Z 250 and Tetric Ceram. Curing mode (P= 0. 007) and material (P< 0. 001) had significant effect on wear. Higher wear resulted from the pulse-delay curing mode when compared to continuous curing, and Filtek Z 250 showed the lowest wear followed by Esthet-X and Tetric Ceram...|$|R
