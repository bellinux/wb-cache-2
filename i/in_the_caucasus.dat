5|$|Both {{ships of}} the class were {{stationed}} in Crete after they entered service, to assist in stabilizing the island {{in the aftermath of}} the Cretan Revolt of 18661869. Nevertheless, the Ottoman fleet remained largely inactive during this period. Both ships saw action during the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878, where they operated against Russian forces in the Black Sea. They were primarily occupied with bombarding Russian coastal positions in support of the Ottoman army <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Caucasus.</b> They also supported an amphibious assault on the port of Sokhumi in May 1877. For the rest of the war, Muin-i Zafer was stationed in Sulina at the mouth of the Danube, while Avnillah assisted in the defense of Batumi <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Caucasus.</b> After the war, both vessels were laid up in Constantinople, and they received a minor refit in 1882.|$|E

In parts of the occupied areas, especially around Van, an Armenian autonomy was briefly set up. The Russian army left the region due to the Revolution of 1917. The Ottoman Empire quickly regained the territories from the small number of irregular Armenian units. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>Caucasus,</b> the Special Transcaucasian Committee was set up after the February Revolution.|$|E

5|$|Russian {{interest}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Caucasus</b> soon waned after Peter's {{death in}} 1725 as its leaders pulled their forces {{back across the}} Terek River. and the gained territories in the North and South Caucasus were ceded back to Iran (now led by Nader Shah) per the treaties of Resht and Ganja of 1732 and 1735, respeticely.|$|E
5|$|The Khazars {{themselves}} first campaigned <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Caucasus</b> {{during the}} Byzantine–Sassanid War of 602–628, {{as a subject}} of the Western Turkic Khaganate. The Turks sacked Derbent and joined the Byzantines in their siege of Tiflis. Their contribution proved decisive for the eventual Byzantine victory in the war. For a few years afterwards, until ca. 632, the Khazars exercised some control over Caucasian Iberia (approximately modern Georgia), Caucasian Albania (modern Republic of Azerbaijan) and Adharbayjan (modern Iranian Azerbaijan).|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} Armenians joined the {{advancing}} 11th Soviet Red Army.

The medieval Armenian capital of Ani, as well as the cultural icon of the Armenian people Mount Ararat, were located in the ceded area. Additionally, Joseph Stalin, then acting Commissar for Nationalities, granted the areas of Nakhchivan and Nagorno-Karabakh (both of which were promised to Armenia by the Bolsheviks in 1920) to Azerbaijan.|$|E

5|$|Following the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk in March 1918, {{which ended}} {{the war on}} the Eastern Front between Imperial Russia and Imperial Germany, {{the main focus of}} the Ottoman Army turned to the Anatolian provinces and territories lost in 1877–1878 during the Russo-Turkish War. The Ottoman Army {{embarked}} on a series of territorial conquests <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Caucasus</b> beginning in northern Persia. Erzerum which had been captured by the Russians in 1916, was retaken on 24 March 1918, followed by Van on 5 April and later Batum, Kars and Tiflis. Reoccupation of these former possessions brought little strategic advantage to the Ottoman Empire, compared with the potential benefits of military success in Palestine.|$|E

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>Caucasus</b> and Transcaucasia, golden jackals {{primarily}} hunt hares and mouse-like rodents, {{and also}} pheasants, francolins, ducks, coots, moorhens, and passerines. Vegetable matter eaten by jackals {{in these areas}} includes fruits, such as pears, hawthorn, dogwood, and the cones of common medlars. The jackal is implicated {{in the destruction of}} grape, watermelon, muskmelon, and nut crops. Near the Vakhsh River, their spring diet consists almost exclusively of plant bulbs and the roots of wild sugar cane, while during winter they feed on wild stony olives. Around the edges of the Karakum Desert, jackals feed on gerbils, lizards, snakes, fish, muskrats, the fruits of wild stony olives, mulberry, dried apricots, watermelons, muskmelons, tomatoes, and grapes.|$|E

5|$|Since the 1960s, {{populations of}} the Caucasian jungle cat living along the Caspian Sea and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Caucasus</b> range states have been rapidly declining.

In Jordan, it is highly {{affected}} by the expansion of agricultural areas around the river beds of Yarmouk and Jordan rivers, where farmers hunted and poisoned jungle cats for attacking poultry. It is also considered rare and threatened in Afghanistan. India exported jungle cat skins in large numbers, until this was banned in 1979; some illegal trade, however, continues in the country, {{as well as in}} Egypt and Afghanistan.|$|E

5|$|The German {{offensive}} against the Soviet Union began early on 22 June 1941 with an artillery barrage. The 16th Panzer Division was subordinated to Heeresgruppe Süd (Army Group South) {{under the command}} of Generalfeldmarschall Von Rundstedt. The goal, together with the 6. Armee and 17. Armee as well as Panzergruppe I, was to follow the pincers of both armies, heading for Kiev and rolling up the Soviet flanks in the process, and finally encircling them at the Dnieper River. The main objective was to conquer the economically important Donets Basin as well as the oil field <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Caucasus.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Turks, based <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Caucasus,</b> {{responded by}} sending 40,000 of their men to ravage the Persian empire in 626, marking {{the start of}} the Third Perso-Turkic War. Joint Byzantine and Göktürk {{operations}} were then focused on besieging Tiflis, where the Byzantines used traction trebuchets to breach the walls, one of the first known uses by the Byzantines. Khosrow sent 1,000 cavalry under Shahraplakan to reinforce the city, but it nevertheless fell, probably in late 628. Ziebel died {{by the end of that}} year, however, saving Epiphania from marriage to a barbarian. Whilst the siege proceeded, Heraclius worked to secure his base in the upper Tigris.|$|E
5|$|The Z-3 {{was to be}} a {{reconnaissance}} {{version and}} would have had additional fuel tanks, increasing its range to 6,000km (3,730mi). Production was due to take place in 1944, just as bomber production was being abandoned. The long-range variants failed to come to fruition. The He 111Z was to have been used in an invasion of Malta in 1942 and as part of an airborne assault on the Soviet cities of Astrakhan and Baku <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Caucasus</b> in the same year. During the Battle of Stalingrad their use was cancelled due to insufficient airfield capacity. Later in 1943, He111Zs helped evacuate German equipment and personnel from the Caucasus region, and during the Allied invasion of Sicily, attempted to deliver reinforcements to the island.|$|E
