40|$|Recently X-ray Computed Tomography (CT) has {{successfully}} entered {{the field of}} industrial quality control, with interesting applications also for metal casting industry, including non-destructive testing and dimensional metrology. In particular, CT benefits of several advantages with respect to traditional dimensional measuring systems, as for example: simultaneous dimensional quality control and material quality control, non-destructive inspection of internal as well as external geometries, and reconstruction of complete and high-density point-clouds in relatively short time. Due to these advantages, CT is increasingly recognised as a very promising non-contact measuring technique and, therefore, several manufacturers and research centres are now investing in the further development of metrological CT systems and in widening their application in industry. This paper investigates accuracy and traceability of dimensional measurements carried out by state of-the- art industrial CT systems, by examining selected results obtained from the “CT Audit” project, {{which is the first}} international interlaboratory comparison of CT systems for dimensional metrology. The project was organized by the Laboratory of <b>Industrial</b> and Geometrical <b>Metrology,</b> University of Padova, Italy, and was carried out in the period from September 2009 to June 2011, involving 15 CT systems, from research institutions and companies working actively on <b>industrial</b> CT <b>metrology</b> in Europe, America and Asia...|$|R
40|$|A high {{precision}} and easy-to-use CCD camera calibration technique for <b>industrial</b> vision <b>metrology</b> is discussed. A well-known method is self-calibration by convergent camera configuration of a two- or three-dimensional target field. Only with this technique {{the central part}} of a sensor area is precisely calibrated, but off the centre the precision rapidly deteriorates. The presented technique is a simultaneous adjustment of both pan and close exposures, which compensates the lack of distortion data in the fringe area of the sensor and offers both uniform and high-precision calibration. Some patterns of camera configuration are compared in an experiment in terms of the precision and its uniformity over the sensor. And the combination of convergent pan exposures and vertical close exposures is proved the best. 1...|$|R
40|$|While {{computed}} tomography (CT) {{has long been}} used for medical applications and material inspection, its application field has recently been broadened to include <b>industrial</b> dimensional <b>metrology.</b> However, the accuracy of CT-based measurements remains yet largely uncertain. Not only are the measurements influenced {{by a number of}} factors and parameters like e. g. workpiece orientation, magnification, edge detection and so on, but also the calibration method matters greatly. This paper investigates the influence of these factors and parameters and the calibration method (rescaling and correction) on accuracy and repeatability of the measurements, using a test object with parallel grooves. The test object is also used to illustrate how more accurate CMM measurements can be used to calibrate CT measurements and to compare different calibration and compensation strategies. status: publishe...|$|R

In this paper, we present the experimental validation of a focus-diverse wavefront sensing (WFS) algorithm with comparative interferometric measurements of a perturbed test mirror. Using sets of defocused point-spread functions measured with the NGST phase retrieval camera, we estimate the wavefront {{of the test}} optic in a perturbed and unperturbed state. Interleaved with the focus-diverse sets, we measure the surface figure of the mirror using a ZYGO interferometer. After reviewing the basic WFS algorithm and describing the experimental setup, we show that we can obtain agreement that is better than 1 / 100 th of a wave rms in the difference of the wavefront estimates obtained in the perturbed and unperturbed states. Essentially, this work demonstrates that our image based WFS methods are generally competitive with standard <b>industrial</b> optical <b>metrology</b> instruments...|$|R

The recent production metrology of hollow structures can not cope with this. An automated, fast and non destructive measurement of the wall thickness is demanded.

The module is based on the ultrasonic time-of-flight method, which can perform distance and thickness measurements even at only one-sided accessibility of the measuring point. A wavelet-based procedure for signal conditioning is presented, which permits a reliable measurement even under critical acoustic conditions. Therefrom production-suited measuring strategies are derived and enhanced by algorithms for decreasing the measurement uncertainty. The mechanical and electrical integration of the measuring module into a machine tool is described in detail.

An instrument made with optical fibers is rugged enough to be used in industrial environments and the fiber- linked optical probe may be miniaturized for accessing tight locations. Among industrial applications developed at IMI we will present several cases for which LCI has been particularly useful such as an elongational rheometer (RME), characterization of wear damages on coating and Laser-induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS). The RME is an instrument in which a polymer sample is stretched in a controlled temperature furnace at up to 350 o C. LCI has been used for monitoring the thickness of the samples. Wear damage is quantified by the volume loss after a wear test. It requires a high depth resolution (axis perpendicular to the surface) but a relatively coarse transverse resolution. The LIBS is a technique that has been used for analyzing the chemical composition of materials as a function of depth.

5000|$|Metrology {{is defined}} by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM) as [...] "the science of measurement, {{embracing}} both experimental and theoretical determinations at any level of uncertainty in any field of science and technology". It establishes a common understanding of units, crucial to human activity. Trading manufactured goods, the ability to accurately diagnose illnesses, and ensuring consumer confidence during the purchase of goods and services all depend on confidence in the measurements made during these processes. This confidence is achieved by metrology's three basic activities: the definition of internationally accepted units of measurement, the realisation of these units of measurement in practice, and the application of chains of traceability (linking measurements to reference standards). These concepts apply to metrology's three main fields: scientific (fundamental) metrology; applied, technical or <b>industrial</b> <b>metrology,</b> and legal metrology.|$|E

40|$|Best Paper Award 2015 We propose an edge-based depth-from-focus {{technique}} for high-precision non-contact <b>industrial</b> inspection and <b>metrology</b> applications. In our system, {{an objective lens}} with a large numerical aperture is chosen to resolve the edge details of the measured object. By motorizing this imaging system, we capture the high-resolution edges within every narrow depth of field. We can therefore extend the measured range and keep a high resolution at the same time. Yet, on the surfaces with a large depth variation, {{a significant amount of}} data around each measured point are out of focus within the captured images. Then, it is difficult to extract the valuable information from these out-of-focus data due to the depth-variant blur. Moreover, these data impede the extraction of continuous contours for the measurement objects in high-level machine vision applications. The proposed approach however makes use of the out-of-focus data to synthesize a depth-invariant smoothed image, and then robustly locates the positions of high contrast edges based on non-maximum suppression and hysteresis thresholding. Furthermore, by focus analysis of both the in-focus and the out-of-focus data, we reconstruct the high-precision 3 D edges for metrology applications...|$|R
40|$|This thesis mainly {{treats the}} {{fabrication}} and applications of micro-optical {{elements in the}} semiconductor materials gallium arsenide (GaAs) and diamond. The recent trend in high-capacity data transfer using light as the information carrier creates new demands on the optoelectronic systems, such as small size, low cost and the integration of many components. Micro-optical components are key elements for building compact optoelectronic systems and are well suited for integration with other devices. Another area where micro-optical elements {{can play an important}} role is the use of lasers in medicine, <b>industrial</b> machining, <b>metrology,</b> etc. In most cases, the laser beam characteristic is not directly suited for the application and external optics is needed to focus, shape or split the laser beam. In {{the first part of this}} thesis, the fabrication of continuous-relief diffractive optical elements, such as diffractive lenses and blazed gratings, in GaAs is examined. The manufacturing technology uses electron-beam lithography followed by plasma etching in an inductively coupled plasma etching system. In the next step, these diffractive elements were monolithically integrated with vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers. In the second part of this thesis a novel topic is examined, diamond micro-optics. Diamond is a unique material in many aspects, it is the hardest material mankind knows, it has an extremely wide optical transmission window, and it possesses the highest thermal conductivity of all solids. Until today, due to difficulties in machining diamond, the realization of diamond optics has been limited. By using the same technology we earlier developed for the fabrication of GaAs optics we demonstrate for the first time continuous-relief structures in diamond of optical quality. Several diamond micro-optical structures are presented; sub-wavelength gratings for reduction of unwanted Fresnel reflections, diffractive fan-out elements used to split a CO 2 -laser beam and refractive microlens arrays. The accuracy of the fabrication process by plasma etching was evaluated by optical and topographical measurements, in all cases the optical components were of very high quality...|$|R
