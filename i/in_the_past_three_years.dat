5|$|In Kansas City, Kansas, two {{religious}} missionaries visit {{two women}} at two different {{homes in the}} same neighborhood who look exactly alike. The second woman yells at them to go away and the two men, inexplicably, get into a fight in the second woman's front yard. Later, two FBI agents who look and sound remarkably similar to Mulder and Scully visit the first woman, Betty Templeton (Kathy Griffin). Betty claims to have never seen the other woman before. The other woman then passes her by in a car and the two agents begin fighting each other, much like the missionaries. They are severely injured after the gruesome mauling. Both agents, who had worked together for seven years, said that they were possessed. Meanwhile, the other woman, Lulu Pfeiffer (also Kathy Griffin), applies for a job at Koko's Copies, but does not get it because she has had 17 jobs in 17 states <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>three</b> <b>years</b> and moves around too much. She becomes aggravated and suddenly, all the copies become black. The other woman, Betty, goes to another job with the same name and same resume.|$|E

25|$|Green channel {{filtering}} {{is another}} technique that {{is useful in}} differentiating lesions rather than vessels. This method {{is important because it}} provides the maximal contrast between diabetic retinopathy-related lesions. Microaneurysms and hemorrhages are red lesions that appear dark after application of green channel filtering. In contrast, exudates, which appear yellow in normal image, are transformed into bright white spots after green filtering. This technique is mostly used according to the 2014 review, with appearance in 27 out of 40 published articles <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>three</b> <b>years.</b> In addition, green channel filtering can be used to detect center of optic disc in conjunction with double-windowing system.|$|E

Also, in the first week of February 2013, as many as four Irrawaddy Dolphins were found dead.|$|E

[...] The lyrics primarily deal with love and heartbreak; in particular, much of the album's lyrical content was inspired by Simpson's breakup with her boyfriend at the time, Josh Henderson. She has {{described the}} album as being [...] "very honest" [...] and [...] "very true to my emotions"—"I wasn't afraid to say that I was hurting and how I got over it." [...] Simpson worked closely with a number of experienced songwriters on the album. The album's producer, John Shanks—who won a Grammy in February 2005, in part for his work as producer on Autobiography—receives songwriting credit alongside Simpson on all but two songs.

2500|$|Earthquake {{prediction}} is {{a branch of}} the science of seismology concerned with the specification of the time, location, and magnitude of future earthquakes within stated limits, But warning of an earthquake that does not occur also incurs a cost: [...] not only the cost of the emergency measures themselves, but of civil and economic disruption. False alarms, including alarms that are canceled, also undermine the credibility, and thereby the effectiveness, of future warnings. In [...] 1999 it was reported [...] that China was introducing [...] "tough regulations intended to stamp out ‘false’ earthquake warnings, in order to prevent panic and mass evacuation of cities triggered by forecasts of major tremors." [...] This was prompted by [...] "more than 30 unofficial earthquake warnings ... <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>three</b> <b>years,</b> none of which has been accurate." [...] The acceptable trade-off between missed quakes and false alarms depends on the societal valuation of these outcomes. [...] The rate of occurrence of both must be considered when evaluating any prediction method.|$|E
