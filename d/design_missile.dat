5000|$|More technically, {{the best}} {{possible}} performance for a supersonic design is typified by two [...] "perfect shapes", the Sears-Haack body which is pointed at both ends, or the von Kármán ogive, which has a blunt tail. Examples of the latter design include the Concorde, F-104 Starfighter and XB-70 Valkyrie, although to some degree practically every post-World War II interceptor aircraft featured such a <b>design.</b> <b>Missile</b> designers are even less interested in low-speed performance, and missiles generally have higher fineness ratios than most aircraft.|$|E
50|$|From 1945 to 1955 under Project Paperclip and its successors, the U.S. {{government}} recruited over 1,600 German and Austrian {{scientists and}} engineers {{in a variety of}} fields such as aircraft <b>design,</b> <b>missile</b> technology and biological warfare. Among the specialists in the latter field who ended up working in the U.S. were Walter Schreiber, Erich Traub and Kurt Blome, who had been involved with medical experiments on concentration camp inmates to test biological warfare agents. Since Britain, France and the Soviet Union were also engaged in recruiting these scientists, the Joint Intelligence Objectives Agency (JIOA) wished to deny their services to other powers, and therefore altered or concealed the records of their Nazi past and involvement in war crimes.|$|E
5000|$|Men Into Space was {{advertised as}} being (for its era) an {{extremely}} accurate preview of manned spaceflight, based on scientific studies and buttressed by technical {{assistance from the}} USAF's ballistic missile and space medicine offices. The spacecraft designs, however, veered inconsistently between early 1950s Wernher Von Braun concept vehicles, and later, totally scaled-down spacecraft proposals. Visual backdrops and conceptual designs of spacecraft, space stations, and a Moon base depended somewhat on contributions from notable astronautics and science fiction artist Chesley Bonestell. The series also availed itself of extensive documentary footage of early missile launches, notably the Atlas missile. It evoked the earlier Disney space exploration documentaries, which in turn owed their look and feel to a widely read, early 1950s series on the subject in the old Collier's Weekly magazine, where Bonestell's art also held sway. At one point in production, a scale model and poster of an Atlas derived <b>design</b> <b>missile</b> with the series spacecraft as the payload was built, with publicity photos of Lundigen holding the model {{in front of the}} large poster. [...] Several scenes used footage from the cancelled Navaho missile program to depict spacecraft landings on a desert runway. The distinctive design of the North American X-10 (different from the close up depictions of the series spacecraft) {{can be seen in the}} desert landing sequences.|$|E

Also discussed are the assessment of aerodynamic drag in tactical missiles, the analysis of supersonic missile aerodynamic heating, the 'equivalent angle-of-attack' concept for engineering analysis, the vortex cloud model for body vortex shedding and tracking, paneling methods with vorticity effects and corrections for nonlinear compressibility, the application of supersonic full potential method to missile bodies, Euler space marching methods for missiles, three-dimensional missile boundary layers, and an analysis of exhaust plumes and their interaction with missile airframes...|$|E

Previous Soviet designs, fuelled with cryogenic LOX and kerosene, commonly took hours to fuel and launch.
