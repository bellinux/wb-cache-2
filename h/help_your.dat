500|$|In {{spite of}} any hard feelings, Voorhis sent Nixon {{a letter of}} {{congratulations}} in early December 1946. The two men met for an hour at Voorhis's office and parted, according to Voorhis, as friends. Voorhis's final letter as a congressman, on December 31, was to his father, who had been his political adviser throughout his congressional career, [...] "It has been primarily due to your <b>help,</b> <b>your</b> confidence, your advice... above all to a feeling I have always had that your hand was on my shoulder. Thanks... God bless you." ...|$|E
500|$|The cantata {{ends with}} the ninth stanza from Luther's German Te Deum, [...] "" [...] (<b>Help</b> <b>Your</b> people, Lord Jesus Christ), a prayer for further help and preservation. It is a four-part setting [...] "with the subtlest touches of flamboyance" [...] in a chorale. No {{performance}} material for the cantata has survived; and the score, where the last two movements appear in free space within movement 7, provides only the four-part setting without mentioning which instruments would play with which voice. Hofmann imagines that {{there might have been}} additional parts for trumpets and timpani for an ending to match the opening of the cantata.|$|E
500|$|The {{story was}} {{collected}} together {{and published by}} Editions Casterman as Objectif Lune in 1953. The title had been Hergé's own choice, having rejected Casterman's suggestion of Tintin and the Nuclear Rocket. For publication in book form, the story was re-coloured, with various changes being made; for instance, in the serialised version, the uniforms worn by staff were green, and they are changed to blue for the book volume. A number of scenes were also deleted. Hergé sent a copy to Ananoff, with a message stating that [...] "Your <b>help,</b> <b>your</b> knowledge, has been invaluable, enabling me to get my little characters to the Moon... and {{to bring them back}} safe and sound." [...] An English-language translation of the book was published in 1959.|$|E

500|$|Former congressman Hoeppel, who {{gathered}} just over {{one percent of}} the vote, wrote Nixon after the election, stating that he had never expected to win, and that his purpose had been [...] "to expose what I considered to be the alien-minded, un-American, PAC, Red, congressional record of the Democratic incumbent". [...] Despite any hard feelings, Voorhis sent Nixon a letter of congratulations in early December 1946. Nixon and Voorhis met for an hour at Voorhis's office, and parted, according to Voorhis, as friends. In 1971, Voorhis said that the two had never spoken again. [...] Voorhis's final letter as a congressman, written on December 31, was to his father, who had been his political adviser throughout his congressional career. [...] Representative Voorhis wrote, [...] "It has been primarily due to your <b>help,</b> <b>your</b> confidence, your advice... above all to a feeling I have always had that your hand was on my shoulder.

500|$|I'm {{proud of}} my service to this country. If you love your country, you serve her. During a time of war, {{during a time of}} {{economic}} hardship, when asked to serve your country in a sensitive position where you can actually bring a background to <b>help</b> <b>your</b> nation, I'm the kind of person who's going to stand up and do it, and I'll take that philosophy to my grave... In terms of the stimulus you talked about, it was failed. [...] And {{let me tell you what}} I talked about with respect to the stimulus. I talked about the need for more tax cuts in the stimulus... We had done historic tax cuts. We created a flat tax in the state of Utah, exactly what needs to happen in this country. We got the economy moving. We became the number-one job creator in this nation and the best managed state. That's exactly what needs to happen in this nation. I am running on my record, and I am proud to run on my record.|$|E
500|$|Like Ice-T's {{gangsta rap}} albums, Body Counts {{material}} focused on various {{social and political}} issues, with songs focusing on topics ranging from police brutality to drug abuse. According to Ernie C, [...] "Everybody writes about whatever they learned growing up, and we were no exception. Like The Beach Boys sing about the beach, we sing {{about the way we}} grew up." [...] Ice-T states that [...] "Body Count was an angry record. It {{was meant to be a}} protest record. I put my anger in it, while lacing it with dark humor." [...] The spoken introduction, [...] "Smoked Pork" [...] features Ice-T taking on the roles of a gangster pretending to be seemingly stranded motorist and a police officer who refuses to aid. The track begins with Mooseman and Ice-T driving their car towards a police car, and then Ice-T asks for the gun Mooseman has and tells Mooseman to stay in the car, much to Mooseman's chagrin, as Mooseman wanted to kill the cop in this round. Ice-T then walks up to the policeman, pretending to be a stranded motorist, asking for help, but the policeman refuses, saying: [...] "Nah, that's not my job! My job's not to <b>help</b> <b>your</b> fuckin' ass out!", then telling him that [...] "my job is eatin' these doughnuts". When the officer recognizes Ice-T, gunshots are heard. The final voice on the track is Ice-T confirming his identity.|$|E

500|$|Many {{people within}} Major League Baseball spoke out {{in support of}} Joyce, {{offering}} their sympathies and noting his exceptional reputation. New York Yankees pitcher Mariano Rivera said, [...] "It happened to the best umpire {{we have in our}} game. The best. And a perfect gentleman. ... It's a shame for both of them, for the pitcher and for the umpire. But I'm telling you he is the best baseball has, and a great guy. It's just a shame." [...] Former Chicago Cubs pitcher Milt Pappas said, [...] "I would tell , 'I feel for you. There have been only 20 perfect games in the history of baseball. The umpire situation was the same one I had—they blew it. At least I had the satisfaction of getting the no-hitter. You don't. I feel for you. You pitched a tremendous game. At least you have the satisfaction of the umpire saying he was sorry. But that doesn't <b>help</b> <b>your</b> situation as far as a perfect game." [...] Pappas' own bid for a perfect game on September 2, 1972, was spoiled when umpire Bruce Froemming called a borderline 3-and-2 pitch to 27th-batter Larry Stahl a ball, issuing a walk to the pinch-hitter. Former Yankees pitcher Don Larsen—who threw the fourth perfect game of the modern era and the only one in World Series history on October 8, 1956—said, [...] "I feel sorry for the umpire, and I just feel real badly for the kid. He's probably wondering right now whose side God is on." ...|$|E

2500|$|Onfim left {{seventeen}} birch bark items. Twelve {{of those}} have illustrations, five only text. One of the drawings features a knight on a horse, stabbing someone {{on the ground with}} a lance, with scholars speculating that Onfim pictured himself as the knight. The writings are clearly homework exercises: Onfim practiced by writing out the alphabet, repeating syllables, and writing psalms, texts that were presumably familiar to him. His writing includes phrases such as [...] "Lord, <b>help</b> <b>your</b> servant Onfim" [...] and fragments from Psalms 6:2 and 27:3; in fact, most of Onfim's writing consists of citations from the Book of Psalms.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, Tijerina was first {{encouraged}} to divert his religious energy into politics. After a sermon in Dallas one day, a man invited him home for lunch. As Tijerina recalls, [...] "He {{said to my}} face, 'I don't like preachers, they {{take advantage of the}} people. What I think you should do is quit talking religion. What the Spanish-American people need is a Spanish-American politician, you may be that … you should study law and history and <b>help</b> <b>your</b> people.'" [...] In June 1956, Tijerina and a few bravos went to Monero, New Mexico, to visit a community that had previously welcomed him. [...] There he learned about land grants, a controversial issue regarding Hispanic property rights. [...] Zebedeo Martínez, Zebedeo Valdez, and other elderly men, all members of the Brotherhood of Jesus, shared the story of how their families were dispossessed of their lands. [...] The next day, they took Tijerina's group to Chama, Tierra Amarilla, and Ensenada to meet with other unhappy heirs.|$|E

2500|$|Ortiz {{said that}} Sukeban Games was founded {{when he and}} Damas started a blog to write about anime and video games. They {{eventually}} managed to grow a [...] "small but awesome" [...] community, which lead them to create a short dating sim for the blog's first anniversary. After enjoying the video game creation process, they decided to continue following that path. The majority of influences for VA-11 HALL-A come from old PC-98 games, because they are [...] "retro" [...] yet also [...] "look futuristic"; especially X-Girl Cyber Punk Adventure which served as the blueprint for the game's aesthetic. According to Ortiz, in the 70s–90s, [...] "the world {{was under the impression}} that Japan was going to take over with its superior technology." [...] As such, the game is set in a parallel universe where Japan did conquer the world through technology, leading to the game's strong Japanese influences. Blade Runner, Neuromancer, Ghost in the Shell, and Bubblegum Crisis were also sources of inspiration. Anime influence has also resulted in the game's female protagonist and mostly female character list. Ortiz says that they focus their games on anime fans rather than mainstream appeal, as [...] "the bigger your audience is the more creative troubles you have. Too many opinions and it's hard to see one that will truly <b>help</b> <b>your</b> creative process." ...|$|E
