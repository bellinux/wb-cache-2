40|$|Hydrogen {{concentrations}} of 0 up to 350 ?mg/kg in a titanium alloy have been determined at National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) with neutron incoherent scattering (NIS) and with cold neutron prompt gamma activation analysis. The latter is a well-established technique, while the former was demonstrated earlier at NIST by counting the neutrons scattered under 45 ° or 60 ° {{and establishing a}} linear relationship between hydrogen concentration and count rate. In this paper, it is shown that the NIS response {{is complicated by the}} dependence of the apparent hydrogen scattering cross section on the sample temperature and the hydrogen chemical binding. It is demonstrated that detection of scattered neutrons at two different angles as well as a more complex theoretical approach (i. e., including Monte Carlo modeling with the <b>free-gas</b> <b>model)</b> are required to correctly interpret NIS measurements. As a result, the process of matching standards and samples becomes less critical. RID/Reactor Instituut DelftDelft University of Technolog...|$|E

Hot {{matter with}} nucleons can be {{produced}} in the inner region of the neutrino-dominated accretion flow in gamma-ray bursts or during the proto-neutron star birth in successful supernovae. The composition and equation of state of the matter depend on the dynamic beta equilibrium under various neutrino opacities. The strong interaction between nucleons may also play an important role. We plan to extend the previous studies by incorporating these two aspects in our model. Methods. The modification of the beta-equilibrium condition from neutrino optically thin to thick was modeled by an equilibrium factor chi ranging between the neutrino-freely-escaping case and the neutrino-trapped case. We employed the microscopic Brueckner-Hartree-Fock approach extended to the finite temperature regime to study the interacting nucleons. Results. We show the composition and chemical potentials of the hot nuclear matter for different densities and temperatures at each stage of beta equilibrium. We also compare our realistic equation of states {{with those of the}} <b>free-gas</b> <b>model.</b> We find {{that it is important to}} properly describe the neutrino opacity and the strong interaction between nucleons, and they should be taken into account in model calculations...|$|E
40|$|Two novel neutron-based {{analytical}} {{techniques have}} been treated in this thesis, Neutron Resonance Capture Analysis (NRCA), employing a pulsed neutron source, and Neutron Incoherent Scattering (NIS), making use of a cold neutron source. With the NRCA method isotopes are identified by the isotopic-specific resonances observed in the neutron capture cross section. The capture events are detected through the prompt-gamma emissions occurring after capture, and the neutron energy at which they occur is determined with the Time of Flight (TOF) method. NRCA was improved to allow for various practical applications, i. e. 1) determination of chlorine in marble matrixes, 2) determination of the calcium to phosphorus ratio in bone, 3) determination of tin isotopes in hydroxyapatite matrixes and 4) determination of lead in bronze archaeological artefacts. The main issue was quenching the background. This was done {{by a combination of}} various expedients: 1) detector shielding, 2) detector material choice, 3) flight path length, 4) selection of gamma energies during data analysis. In NIS the measured hydrogen scattering cross section is employed to determine small hydrogen concentrations in technologically important materials. Early papers regarded the neutron scattering as isotropic and measurements were performed at one scattering angle only. However, the hydrogen scattering cross section is known to depend on hydrogen chemical binding, as expressed in the hydrogen atom's effective mass, and on the thermal motions of the hydrogen atoms in the sample, i. e. sample temperature. Both affect the anisotropy of the incoherent scattering and therefore bias the results. The goal of the research described was to increase the understanding of the NIS method and possibly render it applicable to a variety of hydrogen-containing samples. This was done by measuring at two angles and analysing the data with the aid of Monte Carlo simulations based on a more complex model, i. e. the <b>free-gas</b> <b>model,</b> that accounts for the scattering cross section dependence on hydrogen effective mass and temperature. NIS was performed both on titanium alloy samples loaded with varying hydrogen concentrations and on hydrating cement pastes. XRD (X-Ray Diffraction), MuSR (Muon Spin Resonance) and isothermal calorimetry were employed as supporting techniques for data interpretation. Applied Science...|$|E
30|$|We confine {{our study}} to a {{relatively}} thin homogeneous reservoir within a sub-domain {{of a much larger}} reservoir, with an areal extent far beyond the immediate area of initial production. In keeping with the Dykstra-Parsons model, the reservoir is assumed to occur in discrete layers separated by intercalations of impervious beds which preclude the communication of any vertical pressure gradients. Vertical pressure gradients do not occur in our 2 D sweep study. The displacement of oil by water is not a simple drainage process, because oil imbibition (non-wetting in the pore space) affects the volumetric sweep of the reservoir. Wettability effects and true residual oil left in the pore space after sweep passage are neglected by simplifying Darcy flow. Relative permeability effects included in a Buckley-Leverett model are not considered in our paper. A Buckley-Leverett model uses a transport equation for immiscible displacement of the two phases which is justifiable when assuming a single layer reservoir (homogeneous reservoir properties, capillary pressure effects are negligible, linear displacement and no <b>free-gas).</b> The Dietz <b>model</b> conditions are assumed fulfilled for piston-like oil–water interface displacement that outpaces any gravity forces that would distort the interface during flooding. The capillary pressures of any connate water and oil are different, which would affect the displacement of the oil by injection waterdrive at the pore-space scale, but are neglected in our model. The permeability of porous media can be characterized on a certain modeling scale in numerous mathematical ways (e.g., Rubinstein and Torquato 1989), the most concise still being the description of fluid permeability based on Darcy’s law (e.g., Bear 1972; Bar-Meir 2013).|$|R
