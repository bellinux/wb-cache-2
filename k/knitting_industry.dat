2500|$|The river {{has been}} an {{important}} source of power, from at least 1086, when there was a watermill in Mansfield. A big {{increase in the number of}} mills began in the 1780s, when the frame <b>knitting</b> <b>industry</b> was decimated by the advent of Richard Arkwright's water-powered spinning frame. William Cavendish-Bentinck, 3rd Duke of Portland, encouraged the building of textile mills to relieve unemployment and poverty. Most were converted to do [...] "cotton doubling", and several later became hosiery mills. The conversion of watermills which had formerly ground corn to textile mills led to the building of windmills to carry on milling corn. Although water power has largely ceased, there is still an operational water-mill at Ollerton.|$|E

This building still stands largely unchanged. At the start of the 1900s, the <b>knitting</b> <b>industry</b> needed a bigger factory and had to move to a location outside Bergen. This coincided with the rapid expansion of the sardine industry and in 1910 United Sardine Factories Ltd. (USF) was established. The production of canned goods also expanded the industrial area to 15000 m². Most of these buildings are still intact.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Use {{of various}} dyes {{in order to}} color the {{products}} is a common practice in composite <b>knit</b> <b>industry.</b> The presence of these dyes in water even at low concentration is highly visible and undesirable. This study was carried out for the utilization of orange peel as adsorbent {{for the removal of}} dyes from wastewater and to establish it as a standard wastewater treatment process for composite <b>knit</b> <b>industry.</b> This experiment was performed in the laboratory scale. The materials were obtained and treated for the removal of dyes at different doses. These materials also evaluated for different pH and contact time. This batch adsorption experiment was carried out for finding the effects of adsorbent’s amount, pH and retention time on the removal of dyes from the wastewater. The experiment showed that the removal percentage was 60 - 70 % at pH= 7 with a retention time of 120 minutes. The optimum dose amount of adsorbent was 1. 5 g/ 25 mL. The equilibrium adsorption behavior was examined by applying Langmuir adsorption isotherm model. The adsorption capacity of orange peel is low but comparable to the other available adsorbents...|$|R

40|$|Need for the Study: The study {{entitled}} “Export Performance of the Knitted Garments {{products in}} Tirupur” is undertaken {{to study the}} trend in the industry. Industry faces draw backs and problems to sustain and survive in the economy. The main objective {{of this study is}} to analysis the export performance of the <b>knitted</b> garments <b>industry</b> from 2010 to 2015 based on the wise details of exports. The study also focuses on the various problems faced in the industry both internally and provides suggestions to improve the performance of the <b>knitted</b> garments <b>industry.</b> Scope of the Study: The knitted garments manufacturing and export activities in India mainly located in cochin, kollam, pollachi, and Bangalore. The present study aims at assessing the various seasons and factors that has affected India exports, role of its region exporter and the conditions of overseas marketing. Garments have been one of the foreign exchange earners in the past few years. The study could help the knitted garments board to understand its performance of the knitted garments products exports. It is an attempt on certain specific aspect like exports growth, current status, and performance of knitted garments export.

30|$|Many markets {{do not fit}} the {{description}} of the archetypical atomistic version. Markets are social structures where relationships and reputation matters (Ahrne et al. 2014; Granovetter 1985). Networks influence flows of information, knowledge, ideas, opportunities, resources, and trust in markets (e.g., Ahuja 2000; Burt 2004; Coleman 1988; Powell et al. 1996). Uzzi’s (1997) study of the New York City fashion industry is a case in point. The role of trust, norms, social control, and enforcement in many markets suggests that they exhibit important community mechanisms. Tightly <b>knit</b> <b>industry</b> clusters and interorganizational learning networks, as in the Italian design and the biotechnology industries (Capaldo 2007; Powell et al. 2005), can be understood as market-community hybrids. Knowledge spillovers, shared talent pools, network effects, and agglomeration economies among interdependent competing and collaborating actors characterize clusters (Audretsch and Feldman 1996; Porter 1990) and demonstrate blends of market and community mechanisms.|$|R

30|$|The {{stripping}} of reactive dyes from cotton {{knit fabric}} and its satisfactory performance level {{directly related to}} the processing damage to the fabric. Besides the better striping percentage, the overall fabric quality needs to be considered at the time of stripping. As stripping is a dye destruction process using harsh chemicals, {{there is no way to}} stop completely their adverse effects on fabric quality, but this can be controlled within a certain range. In case of major unevenness 5  g/l hydrose and 5  g/l alkali is commonly used in <b>knit</b> dyeing <b>industries</b> for full stripping of reactive dyes from cotton fabric and according to this study the fabric strength loss and weight loss can be controlled within 5 % for both using such combinations.|$|R

50|$|The town of Bennington {{experienced}} significant {{growth in}} its industries (mainly textile-related) {{in the second}} half of the 19th century. This growth resulted in increased demand for housing for its workers. Safford Street was laid out about 1850, extending away from Main Street, where the Safford Mills were located. Thomas Carrigan, an immigrant machinist from Ireland, moved to Bennington sometime before 1870, and was by 1880 listed as owner of the two Safford Street houses, which were built about 1875. Around 1890, when Bennington's <b>knit</b> goods <b>industry</b> began to expand, Carrigan subdivided his property, which apparently extended all the way to Division Street, and two houses were built facing Division Street, and the two multiunit buildings facing Carrigan Lane were built. The two Safford Street houses have also since been converted into multiunit housing.|$|R

50|$|Knighton {{retained}} its agricultural character into the 19th century, whilst Leicester {{to the north}} and Wigston to the south were becoming centres of the framework <b>knitting</b> cottage <b>industry.</b> The first effects of the expansion of Leicester were felt, not in the village itself, but {{in the area of the}} parish that became known as Stoneygate. Suburban development had its beginnings in the 1770s and 80s with a substantial private dwelling called Stoneygate House, on what later became Toller Road, followed by the conversion of a farmhouse on the Harborough Turnpike, (now London Road) into a 'gentleman's residence' called The Stoney Gate. By the 1840s there were 10 houses strung along the London Road, occupied by some of Leicester's most prosperous tradesmen and industrialists. The trend of wealthy clients getting a house built for their own use continued up to 1863, by which time there were 32 such spacious mansions. From 1865 the side roads began to be opened up, developed by speculative builders, and a more rapid expansion and infilling got underway.|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The paper aims to {{investigate}} how {{the relationships among}} the various actors within the business networks affect the evolution of innovation through steps of the technology life cycle. Design/methodology/approach – The study {{is supported by a}} longitudinal case study referring to a mechanical company operating in the <b>knitting</b> machinery <b>industry.</b> A triangulation method, integrating multiple data sources in a multiple method design, was used to gather data. Findings – The longitudinal study supports the idea that interactions among the actors within the business networks heavily influence the evolution of technology. Research limitations/implications – Although the longitudinal case study reported in the paper refers to a period of about ten years, our findings refer only to a single case study in a specific sector and cannot be generalized. Practical implications – The paper provides important guidelines on how to manage the relationships emerging within a business network in order to influence the development of new technologies. Originality/value – The paper contributes to business networks literature, filling the gaps in information about how the relationships among the actors involved in a network can evolve over time and influence the evolution of technology itself...|$|R
