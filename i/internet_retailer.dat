5|$|Logging was Seattle's {{first major}} industry, {{but by the}} late 19th century, the city had become a {{commercial}} and shipbuilding center as a gateway to Alaska during the Klondike Gold Rush. Growth after World War II was partially due to the local Boeing company, which established Seattle as a center for aircraft manufacturing. The Seattle area developed as a technology center beginning in the 1980s, with companies like Microsoft becoming established in the region. <b>Internet</b> <b>retailer</b> Amazon was founded in Seattle in 1994. The stream of new software, biotechnology, and Internet companies led to an economic revival, which increased the city's population by almost 50,000 between 1990 and 2000.|$|E
5|$|Still, {{very large}} {{companies}} dominate the business landscape. Five {{companies on the}} 2013 Fortune 500 list of the United States' largest companies, based on total revenue, are headquartered in Seattle: <b>Internet</b> <b>retailer</b> Amazon.com (#49), coffee chain Starbucks (#208), department store Nordstrom (#227), and freight forwarder Expeditors International of Washington (#428), and Weyerhaeuser, the forest products company (#363). Other Fortune 500 companies popularly associated with Seattle are based in nearby Puget Sound cities. Warehouse club chain Costco (#22), the largest retail company in Washington, is based in Issaquah. Microsoft (#35) is located in Redmond. Finally, Bellevue is home to truck manufacturer Paccar (#168). Other major companies in the area include Nintendo of America in Redmond, T-Mobile US in Bellevue, Expedia Inc. in Bellevue and Providence Health & Services — the state's largest health care system and fifth largest employer — in Renton. The city {{has a reputation for}} heavy coffee consumption; coffee companies founded or based in Seattle include Starbucks, Seattle's Best Coffee, and Tully's. There are also many successful independent artisanal espresso roasters and cafés.|$|E

40|$|This study investigates <b>Internet</b> <b>retailers</b> in a {{developing}} country. It aims {{to investigate the}} characteristic of business profiles and operations, and to describe performance measurement implemented and its use. Internet-based research was adopted by combining a questionnaire email survey with web content analysis to study Indonesian <b>Internet</b> <b>retailers.</b> The {{results show that the}} majority of Indonesian <b>Internet</b> <b>retailers</b> are immature, small size, and without store-presence. The business operation practices, such as ordering, payment, and communication, indicate some differences from those in developed economies. Though Indonesian <b>Internet</b> <b>retailers</b> are still immature, they have measured various aspects of business performance. Those measured more performance indicators are likely to use the information more intensively to support decision making. This study has limitations such as the small number of responses, which might prevent the generalization of the results. The findings could be used by local <b>Internet</b> <b>retailers</b> to improve the business operations and performance measurement, as well as global <b>Internet</b> <b>retailers</b> entering Indonesian market to adopt some local operation practices...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} performance measurement implemented by <b>Internet</b> <b>retailers,</b> its variation in terms of business format, and its potential effect. A mail survey among UK <b>Internet</b> <b>retailers</b> produced 252 usable responses of small and medium-sized businesses. The results indicate that <b>Internet</b> <b>retailers</b> without store presence are likely to have higher complexity of performance measurement than those with store presence. The potential effect of performance measurement to improve business performance was also observed. The results are limited to UK small-and-medium sized <b>Internet</b> <b>retailers,</b> selling tangible goods. The study suggests <b>Internet</b> <b>retailers</b> to measure various aspect of their performance because of its potential impact in improving operational performance. The paper has contributed to enhance the understanding of performance measurement in e-commerce firms and its impact on performance...|$|R

500|$|In a 2016 {{interview}} with Daunt, {{he stated that}} Amazon [...] "defines how Waterstones acts" [...] and while Waterstones could not compete with the <b>internet</b> <b>retailer</b> digitally, it could offer a credible alternative, believing there was [...] "a future in physical bookselling." [...] Waterstones continued to look at [...] "fixing the basics" [...] during 2016, such as adjusting store opening hours and harnessing data from the loyalty card as well as refurbishment of physical stores, including the Canterbury branch, and work on its e-commerce routes through improvements to product ranking. Stores in Oxford Street Plaza, Edinburgh George Street, and Reading Oracle were closed, Harpenden Books, Glasgow Fort, [...] Tottenham Court Road were opened [...] and Wimbledon and Watford were reopened in new sites. The newly opened stores benefitted from a refreshed brand look, widely welcomed by the book trade. The retailer renewed its partnership with Oxfam to continue {{to raise money for}} the Syrian crisis, donating £5 for each ‘Book of the Month’ sold in-store during November 2016. Daunt made public his concern that the UK EU referendum was likely to impact on company sales due to an expected retail downturn following a ‘no’ vote. He later noted that sales had remained ‘buoyant’ following the decision to leave the EU, but remained pessimistic for the future.|$|E

2500|$|Researchers Jeonghye Choi of Yonsei University, Sam Hui of Stern School of Business at New York University and David Bell of The Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, {{explored}} two imitation {{effects of}} the demand at an <b>Internet</b> <b>retailer,</b> geographic proximity and demographic similarity and concluded that firms can influence the space–time demand path through seeding. The researchers conceived a new seeding strategy called “Proximity-and-similarity-based strategy”, in which the firm seeds the new product by choosing new zip codes that are the most responsive while adjusting the impact of proximity and similarity effects over time, and {{compare it to the}} three strategies presented in Libai, Muller and Peres's research,“support the strong”, “support the weak” and “uniform”. [...] They argue that with time, the “proximity-and similarity-based strategy” performs best because the similarity effect begins to affect new and distant areas. Namely, serving many small pools of similar buyers demographically, who are geographically distant from one another, is crucial for an <b>Internet</b> <b>retailer</b> because then sales increase over time.|$|E

40|$|Enter {{the word}} “cigarettes” in an Internet search engine {{and you will}} {{probably}} find an <b>Internet</b> cigarette <b>retailer</b> (“Internet cigarette retailer”) {{at the top of}} your list of search results. The number of <b>Internet</b> cigarette <b>retailers</b> has increased dramatically in recent years. In 2000, Professor Kurt Ribisl of the University of North Carolina at Chapel-Hill and colleagues undertook the first comprehensive survey of the number of domestic <b>Internet</b> cigarette <b>retailers</b> and identified 88 <b>Internet</b> cigarette <b>retailers</b> operating through hundreds of websites. Four years later, their follow-up study identified 775 domestic <b>Internet</b> cigarette <b>retailers.</b> This trend is a concern because tobacco use is the leading preventable cause of death in the United States. Cigarettes kill 400, 000 Americans every year. Tobacco-related deaths exceed the number of people killed by alcohol, AIDS, car crashes, illegal drugs, murders, and suicides combined. Additionally, smoking-attributable health-care expenditures are approximately $ 75. 5 billion annually. This Synopsis discusses problems associated with <b>Internet</b> cigarette <b>retailers,</b> and the state and federal laws that can be used to address these problems. Section I of this Synopsis discusses the marketing and operation of <b>Internet</b> cigarette <b>retailers.</b> Section II outlines efforts by states to collect their tobacco taxes on sales by <b>Internet</b> cigarette <b>retailers</b> and to prevent <b>Internet</b> cigarette <b>retailers</b> from selling to children. Section III discusses impediments to state action, the most significant being the threat of legal challenges under the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution. This section also addresses Native American sovereignty, as many domestic <b>Internet</b> cigarette <b>retailers</b> operate from within Native American lands...|$|R
