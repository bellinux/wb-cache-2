5|$|Valene Ewing first {{appears in}} Dallas in 1978, {{as the mother}} of Lucy Ewing (Charlene Tilton) and the ex-wife of Gary Ewing (David Ackroyd, later played by Ted Shackelford), the middle son and the black sheep of the Ewing family. Valene and Gary Ewing were first married in their {{adolescence}} in 1961, when <b>Gary</b> <b>was</b> 17 years old and Valene was 15. When a pregnant Valene persuades Gary {{to take her to the}} Southfork Ranch in order to introduce her to his family, they settle down at Southfork, and Miss Ellie gave Gary a job as ranch foreman. However, Gary and Valene were soon pressured and manipulated by Gary's older brother, J.R. Ewing (Larry Hagman), who constantly tried to undermine and destroy their marriage. Meanwhile, Gary's father, Jock Ewing, put pressure on Gary to stand up and face his responsibilities for becoming a teenage husband and father-to-be. When Valene gives birth to their daughter Lucy, J.R. makes it clear that the child is an Ewing and will be raised by the Ewings themselves. J.R.'s constant interference causes Gary and Val's marriage to collapse. Under the pressure, Gary fell victim to alcoholism, became violent in the process and walked out on Val and Lucy. With Gary gone, Valene is then driven off Southfork by J.R., but she soon returns to get baby Lucy and flees to Virginia, and later to Tennessee, where she tries to get help from her mother, Lilimae Clements (Julie Harris), to take them in, but they are turned away. At this point, Valene and Lucy had already been tracked down by heavies that were hired by J.R. and the heavies rip Lucy right out of Valene's arms, and take Lucy back to Southfork to be raised by her paternal grandparents. When Valene later tried to take legal action to get Lucy back, J.R. warned Valene that he'd kill her if she came back to the state of Texas. Valene is prevented from seeing her daughter again for many years as a result of this.|$|E

25|$|In May 1970, {{soon after}} Carlton Gary moved to Albany, {{an elderly woman}} named Marion Brewer was robbed and {{attacked}} in her hotel room. Two months later, 85-year-old Nellie Farmer was robbed in her apartment and strangled to death. After Gary attempted an assault on a third elderly woman, {{he was arrested and}} his fingerprints matched one left {{at the scene of the}} Farmer murder. Gary admitted having taken part in a robbery, but claimed that an accomplice, John Lee Mitchell, was responsible for the actual murder. Gary testified against Mitchell in court and Mitchell was charged, despite no material evidence connecting him to the crime. <b>Gary</b> <b>was</b> only charged with robbery, a sentence he served in the Onondaga County Correctional Institution in Jamesville, New York. He was paroled in 1975 and moved to Syracuse, New York. Here, two more elderly women were attacked, raped, and strangled in their homes; one died and the other survived. Both attacks occurred within four days of each other. The two survivors were not able to identify Gary positively as the crimes occurred in the dark; at least one victim was sure that her attacker was a mustachioed black male, and she was strangled with a scarf. <b>Gary</b> <b>was</b> never charged for any of these crimes but was instead sent back to prison for parole violation and robbery after he was caught trying to sell coins stolen from the same apartment building as one of the surviving Syracuse victims. On August 22, 1977, Gary escaped from his low-security prison by sawing through the bars of his cell and made it back to Columbus, Georgia.|$|E
