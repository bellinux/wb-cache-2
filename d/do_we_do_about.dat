After Hannam's story Marshall rushed to advise staff by email that, CSIRO's climate models [...] "are {{among the best in}} the world", and contributed to proving global climate change. In his email, Marshall wrote: [...] "That question has been answered, and the new question is what <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> it, and how can we find solutions for the climate we will be living with?" [...] The Director of the ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate System Science, UNSW Australia, Professor Andy Pitman, who is trying to secure new government funding for his climate center of excellence, described this assertion as [...] "among the most ill-informed statements I have ever heard from a senior executive." [...] Other experts rallied to vigorously challenge the underpinning logic of CSIROs proposed changes prompting Marshall to issue an official statement on 8 February alleging [...] "incorrect reporting by media". In his statement Marshall claimed that CSIRO's plans had been misrepresented and, although Marshall claimed that the CSIRO would retain the ability to support climate measurement in Australia, he nevertheless defended the decision to reduce climate change modeling and measurement to increase mitigation and adaptation: [...] "No one is saying climate change is not important, but surely mitigation, health, education, sustainable industries, and prosperity of the nation are no less important." [...] In defending his decisions, Marshall told the ABC [...] "I guess I had the realisation that the climate lobby is perhaps more powerful than the energy lobby was back in the '70s - and the politics of climate I think there's a lot of emotion in this debate", adding [...] "In fact it almost sounds more like religion than science to me" [...] Marshall later apologized for his reference to religion at the start of a subsequent Senate Estimates hearing.|$|E

In computer vision, unsupervised segmentation algorithms, although of great interest, often suffer from lack of a well-defined goal and/or explicit ground truth data, thus rendering evaluation difficult. This paper presents a novel method for evaluating such algorithms using a database for which ground truth data is not explicitly available. Unlike methods of evaluation that rely on the existence or creation of explicit ground truth data, the proposed evaluation procedure subjects human observers to a psychovisual test comparing the results of different segmentation algorithms. The test is designed to answer two main questions: <b>does</b> consensus <b>about</b> a `best' segmentation exist, and if it <b>does,</b> what <b>do</b> <b>we</b> learn <b>about</b> segmentation schemes?

40|$|Six {{years into}} the second millennium, the United States stands at the {{pinnacle}} of its economic and political power. Yet in 2003, the U. S. government estimated that approximately 36 million Americans live in poverty. Of that 36 million in 2003, about 12 million were children.

In the following research project, I will examine how evangelical churches and faith based organizations play a unique and critical role in improving the lives of at-risk youth. Focusing on the area of Northwest Pasadena, this research seeks to understand the values and the methods evangelical Christians are using to minister to the poor. Starting from a critical study of biblical texts, an exploration of social justice and poverty in the Bible will highlight an applicable theology to use in outreach ministries.

40|$|Content-Based Image Retrieval is {{important}} for two reasons. First, the oft-cited growth of image archives in many fields, and {{the rapid expansion of}} the Web, mean that successful image retrieval systems are fast becoming a necessity if the mass of accumulated data is to be useful. Second, database retrieval provides a framework within which the important questions of machine vision are brought into focus: successful retrieval is likely to require genuine image understanding. In view of these points, the evaluatio- n of retrieval systems becomes a matter of priority. There is already a substantial literature evaluating specific systems, but little high-level discussion of the evaluation methodologies themselves seems to have taken place. In {{the first part of the}} report, we propose a framework within which such issues can be addressed, analyse possible evaluation methodologies, indicate where they are appropriate and where they are not, and critique query-by-example and evaluation methodologies related to it. In the second part of the report, we apply the results of this analysis to a particular dataset. The dataset is problematic but typical: no ground truth is available for its semantics. Considering retrieval based on image segmentation- s, we present a novel method for its evaluation. Unlike methods of evaluation that rely on the existence or creation of ground truth, the proposed evaluatio- n procedure subjects human subjects to a psychovisual test comparing the results of different segmentation schemes. The test is designed to answer two questions: <b>does</b> consensus <b>about</b> a `best' segmentation exist, and if it <b>does,</b> what <b>do</b> <b>we</b> learn <b>about</b> segmentation schemes for retrieval?

5000|$|Kierkegaard {{challenges}} {{the reader with}} the question, [...] "Do {{you know what the}} discourse is about?" [...] Paul had been given Roman citizenship as a gift from God, he had been given this challenge of trying to guide an infant church into existence along with others chosen by Christ. What <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> the positive gifts we have been given by God? These gifts become thorns if you don't use them. Martin Luther had commented about thorns much in the same way Kierkegaard does here when he wrote to his wife, [...] "Thou mayest tell M. Philipps to correct his postil. He never understood why our Lord, in the gospel, calls riches thorns. Here is the school to learn that. But I shudder to think that thorns, in the Scripture, are always threatened with fire. Wherefore I have the greater patience, if haply, by the help of God, I may be able to bring some good to pass." [...] (Martin Luther, To His Wife 1546) [...] Kierkegaard was grateful for the free gift of intellectual ability, imagination, and dialectical skills and he took these gifts as gifts that should be used in the service of God. Is it better to examine your own positive qualities or the negative qualities associated to your own self? Can knowledge become a thorn in the side? Here is how he said it in 1847 and then 1848, [...] Christ learned obedience from what he suffered-what he suffered when he who possesses the blessing was like a curse for everyone who came near him and for everyone who avoided him, an affliction for his contemporaries, like an affliction for those few who loved him, so that he had to wrench them out into the most terrible decision, so that for his mother he had to be the sword that pierced her heart, for the disciples a crucified love; an affliction for the vacillators, who basically perhaps in the hiddenness of a secret desire grasped the truth of his words but did not dare to join him but for that very reason also kept a thorn in their souls, a split in their inner being, a painful mark of having been his contemporaries; an affliction for the wicked, that he by his purity and holiness had to expose their hearts and make them guiltier than ever. What heavy suffering: to have to be the stumbling stone in order to be the Savior of the world! Soren Kierkegaard, Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits 1847 Hong 1993 p. 254An observer will perceive how everything was set in motion and how dialectically: I had a thorn in the flesh, intellectual gifts (especially imagination) and culture in superabundance, an enormous development as an observer, a Christian upbringing that was certainly very unusual, a dialectical relationship to Christianity which was peculiarly my own, and in addition to this I had from childhood a training obedience, obedience absolute, and I was armed with an almost foolhardy faith that I was able to do anything, only one thing excepted, to be a free bird, though but for a whole day, or to slip out of the fetters of melancholy in which another power held me bound. Finally in my own eyes I was a penitent. The impression this now makes upon me is as if there were a Power which form the first instant had been observant of this and said, as a fisherman says of the fish, Let it run awhile, it is not yet the moment to pull it in. And strangely enough there is something that reaches back in my recollection, impossible as it is for me to say when I began this practice or why such a thing ever occurred to me: I prayed to God regularly, every day, that He would give me zeal and patience to perform the work He would assign me. Thus I became an author. *Soren Kierkegaard, The Point of View of My Work as an Author Lowrie translation, 1939, 1962 p. 82-83 ...|$|E

30|$|The goal of {{this article}} is to spread the results of a {{literature}} review regarding vocational school dropouts. More concretely, it offers an analysis of the practical recommendations that came out of research projects on how to reduce the number of vocational education leavers. Early and sustained intervention is a key part of student success and the fight against dropouts because choosing to quit school before graduating is not a snap decision; rather it is the result of a process that develops over many years (Christenson et al. 2001). Continuous empirical study of the interventions that are carried out, the measures taken to confront early school leaving, and the variables that lead to their success, is needed. However, despite the far-reaching effects and significance of this topic on both an individual (students who have dropped out) and a public level, very few published studies have actually focused on the effectiveness of interventions or specific strategies for confronting the problem. A thorough review of early school leaving (Lehr et al. 2003) revealed that research on school dropout has been overwhelmingly predictive or descriptive (mainly analyzing predictive/explicative causes of dropouts) in nature and that most methodologies used to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions have been of low quality and have very little scientific merit or relevance. This was the same conclusion that the USA’s General Accounting Office (2002) reached in a report that they published confirming that although there were many federal, state, and local programs in place to prevent school dropouts, during the 2  decades leading up to the study few had been rigorously evaluated. Today, we know much more about who is dropping out of the education system and why they are <b>doing</b> it than <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> the recommendations and intervention strategies to combat this phenomenon that emerge from the empirical analyses. This problem is even more serious with regard to vocational education dropouts. Aside from the lack of careful studies in this area, the analysis and organization of interventions carried out at this level is lackluster at best.|$|R

There is no Heisenbergian uncertainty that Alzheimer’s disease (AD) {{has become one of}} the most ominous medical challenges of the 21 st century. It follows that if rapid action is not taken to substantially reduce its expo-nential growth, a socio-economic crisis will develop and devour many government-sponsored health plans within the next few decades. So, what <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> it and how do we do it?

These nostrums, which are charitably called ‘cogni-tive enhancers’, do no such thing, not even in treating mild cognitive impairment or slowing-down conver-sion to AD [1].

In the past many people saw it as a ‘big city’ problem, more likely to occur in places like downtown Toronto or Vancouver.

40|$|There are two {{problems}} {{in the market for}} developing country debt: one is the immediate crisis. What <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> the large volume of outstanding debt? A more subtle but no less important problem is that because contracts are un-enforceable and lenders have incomplete information about risk, capital is mis-allocated. This article examines the latter problem and reviews the nature and causes of the unenforceability. It shows that unenforceability results in higher interest rates on smaller and shorter-term loans than would otherwise be avail-able and discourages investment in developing countries. Similarly, unenforce-ability can explain the perverse timing of capital flows to developing countries, causing credit to flow into the country when income is high, and out when income is low. The article then analyzes the risk associated with three types of information asymmetries: information about the borrowers ' ability to repay, willingness to repay, and use of the loan proceeds. These asymmetries, the author argues, reinforce the effects of unenforceability. The prospects for remedying the immediate crisis are discussed, as is the need to be certain that the proposed solutions do not aggravate these problems. G overnments regularly intervene in credit markets in an attempt to rec-tify market failures. The U. S. government, for example, guarantees loans for students {{on the assumption that the}} market will provide too little credit for investment in human capital.
