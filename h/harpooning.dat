25|$|Hunting for {{sperm whales}} {{during this period}} was a {{notoriously}} dangerous affair for the crews of the 19th-century whaleboats. Although a properly harpooned sperm whale generally exhibited a fairly consistent pattern of attempting to flee underwater {{to the point of}} exhaustion (at which point it would surface and offer no further resistance), it was not uncommon for bull whales to become enraged and turn to attack pursuing whaleboats on the surface, particularly if it had already been wounded by repeated <b>harpooning</b> attempts. A commonly reported tactic was for the whale to invert itself and violently thrash {{the surface of the water}} with its , flipping and crushing nearby boats.|$|E
2500|$|In Japan, {{hunting for}} right whales dates {{back at least}} to the 16th century, {{although}} stranded whales had been utilized for centuries before then. In 1675, Yoriharu Wada invented a new method of whaling, entangling the animals in nets before <b>harpooning</b> them. Initially the nets were made of straw, later replaced by the stronger hemp. A hunting group consisted of 15–20 Seko-bune or [...] "beater" [...] boats, 6 Ami-bune or netting boats and 4 Mosso-bune or tug boats, for a total of 30–35 boats with crews totaling about 400. In addition to right whales, they took gray whales and humpback whales.|$|E

6000|$|It was on {{the third}} day after our forming our camp near the Indian caves that the tragedy occurred. Challenger and Summerlee had gone off {{together}} that day to the lake where some of the natives, under their direction, were engaged in <b>harpooning</b> specimens of the great lizards. Lord John and I had remained in our camp, while a number of the Indians were scattered about upon the grassy slope in front of the caves engaged in different ways. Suddenly there was a shrill cry of alarm, with the word [...] "Stoa" [...] resounding from a hundred tongues. From every side men, women, and children were rushing wildly for shelter, swarming up the staircases and into the caves in a mad stampede.|$|E
60|$|The three boats {{flew over}} the sea, as the men {{strained}} their muscles to the utmost, and for some time they kept almost in line, being pretty equally matched; but gradually the captain shot ahead, and it became evident that his harpooner, Amos Parr, {{was to have the}} honour of <b>harpooning</b> the first whale. Amos pulled the bow oar, and behind him was the tub with the line coiled away and the harpoon bent on to it. Being an experienced whaleman, he evinced no sign of excitement, save in the brilliancy of his dark eye, and a very slight flush on his bronzed face. They had now neared the whale, and ceased rowing for a moment, lest they should miss it when down.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah! my boy, but we {{have the}} strongest {{evidence}} that he was not born there, for you must know that some whalers have a habit of marking their harpoons with date and name of ship; and as we have been told by that good and true man Dr Scoresby, there have been several instances where whales have been captured near Behring Straits with harpoons in them bearing the stamp of ships that were known to cruise on the Baffin's Bay side of America. Moreover, in one or two instances a very short time had elapsed between the date of <b>harpooning</b> on the Atlantic and capturing on the Pacific side. These facts prove, at all events, a `North-west Passage' for whales, and, as whales cannot travel far under ice without breathing, they also tend to prove an open Polar sea.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the <b>harpoon</b> heads excavated from the Moyoro Shell Mound, a famous archaeological {{site of the}} Okhotsk culture in Abashiri City, Hokkaido Prefecture. The site {{is located on the}} left bank of the Abashiri River, which flows into the Okhotsk Sea (Fig. 1). Archaeological finds from the Moyoro Shell Mound, which were excavated from the Pit-dwelling No. 10 in 1948 (Komai ed. 1964), are preserved by the Department of Archaeology, Faculty of Letters, the University of Tokyo. In this paper, <b>harpoon</b> heads made of bone and antlers in this collection will be described and discussed. In addition, some <b>harpoon</b> heads {{in the collection of the}} Hakodate City Museum will also be discussed; these specimens were unearthed from the Moyoro Shell Mound in 1941 and 1942. From the Pit-dwelling No. 10, 23 <b>harpoon</b> heads were excavated (Fig. 2 - 5, PL. 1 - 4). They are classified by the way they are hafted and connected to the line. While only one male <b>harpoon</b> head was found from the floor of the dwelling, 22 female <b>harpoon</b> heads were unearthed from the floor and upper layers, including five unfinished specimens. The female-toggle <b>harpoon</b> heads are subdivided into four types. Type I is an open socket <b>harpoon</b> head, with a line groove also used for lashing the shaft or the foreshaft. Type II is an open socket <b>harpoon</b> head with two line holes to hold the <b>harpoon</b> head and a groove for lashing the shaft or the foreshaft. Type III is a closed socket <b>harpoon</b> head with a thin body. Type IV is an open socket <b>harpoon</b> head with two line holes, which belongs to the Ainu period. The number of <b>harpoon</b> heads of each type found from each layer is shown in Table 2. Type I <b>harpoon</b> heads constitute a large proportion of the unearthed <b>harpoon</b> heads, while only one specimen for each of Type II, Type III, and Type IV was found from the topsoil. Some of the Type I <b>harpoon</b> heads show the traces of reprocessing (Fig. 6). The reduction process of this type of <b>harpoon</b> heads was reconstructed based on these materials (Fig. 7). The Type II <b>harpoon</b> heads in eastern Hokkaido, distributed from Tokoro to Nemuro, are typologically different from the Type II <b>harpoon</b> heads in Southern Kuriles (Fig. 8). Some of the Type III <b>harpoon</b> heads are made of the ribs of sea mammals; this technique is characteristic of this site (Fig. 9) ...|$|R

60|$|Some {{fifty years}} ago there was a curious case of whale-trover litigated in England, wherein the plaintiffs set forth that after a hard chase of a whale in the Northern seas; and when indeed they (the plaintiffs) had succeeded in <b>harpooning</b> the fish; they were at last, through peril of their lives, obliged to forsake not only their lines, but their boat itself. Ultimately the {{defendants}} (the crew of another ship) {{came up with the}} whale, struck, killed, seized, and finally appropriated it before the very eyes of the plaintiffs. And when those defendants were remonstrated with, their captain snapped his fingers in the plaintiffs' teeth, and assured them that by way of doxology to the deed he had done, he would now retain their line, harpoons, and boat, which had remained attached to the whale {{at the time of the}} seizure. Wherefore the plaintiffs now sued for the recovery of the value of their whale, line, harpoons, and boat.|$|E

60|$|We {{pioneers of}} light tackle {{are out of}} the woods now. There was a pride in a fight against odds--a pride of silence, and a fight of example and {{expressed}} standards and splendid achievements. But now we have followers, disciples who have learned, who have profited, who have climbed to the heights, and we are no longer alone. Hence we can scatter the news to the four winds and ask for the comradeship of kindred spirits, of men who love the sea and the stream and the gameness of a fish. The Open Sesame to our clan is just that love, and an ambition to achieve higher things. Who fishes just to kill? At Long Key last winter I met two self-styled sportsmen. They were eager to convert me to what they claimed was the dry-fly class angling of the sea. And it was to jab harpoons and spears into porpoises and manatee and sawfish, and be dragged about in their boat. The height of their achievements that winter had been the <b>harpooning</b> of several sawfish, each of which gave birth to a little one while being fought on the harpoon! Ye gods!

60|$|Seeing, now, {{that there}} were no {{curtains}} to the window, and that the street being very narrow, the house opposite commanded a plain view into the room, and observing more and more the indecorous figure that Queequeg made, staving about with little else but his hat and boots on; I begged him as well as I could, to accelerate his toilet somewhat, and particularly to get into his pantaloons as soon as possible. He complied, and then proceeded to wash himself. At that time in the morning any Christian would have washed his face; but Queequeg, to my amazement, contented himself with restricting his ablutions to his chest, arms, and hands. He then donned his waistcoat, and taking up a piece of hard soap on the wash-stand centre table, dipped it into water and commenced lathering his face. I was watching to see where he kept his razor, when lo and behold, he takes the harpoon from the bed corner, slips out the long wooden stock, unsheathes the head, whets it a little on his boot, and striding up to the bit of mirror against the wall, begins a vigorous scraping, or rather <b>harpooning</b> of his cheeks. Thinks I, Queequeg, this is using Rogers's best cutlery with a vengeance. Afterwards I wondered the less at this operation when I came to know of what fine steel the head of a harpoon is made, and how exceedingly sharp the long straight edges are always kept.|$|E
6000|$|Being thus left alone, Bough, I, the Rosses, Professor Blackie, and an Englishman called M----: {{these people}} were going to remain the night, except the Professor, who is {{resident}} there at present. They were going to dine en compagnie and wished us to join the party; but we had already committed ourselves by mistake to the wrong hotel, and besides, we wished to be off as soon as wind and tide were against us to Earraid. We went up; Bough selected a place for sketching and blocked in the sketch for Mrs. R.; and we all talked together. Bough told us his family history and a lot of strange things about old Cumberland life; among others, how he had known [...] "John Peel" [...] of pleasant memory in song, and of how that worthy hunted. At five, down we go to the Argyll Hotel, and wait dinner. Broth--"nice broth"--fresh herrings, and fowl had been promised. At 5.50, I get the shovel and tongs and drum them at the stair-head till a response comes from below that the nice broth is at hand. I boast of my engineering, and Bough compares me to the Abbot of Arbroath who originated the Inchcape Bell. At last, in comes the tureen and the hand-maid lifts the cover. [...] "Rice soup!" [...] I yell; [...] "O no! none o' that for me!"--"Yes," [...] says Bough savagely; [...] "but Miss Amy didn't take me downstairs to eat salmon." [...] Accordingly he is helped. How his face fell. [...] "I imagine myself in the accident ward of the Infirmary," [...] quoth he. It was, purely and simply, rice and water. After this, we have another weary pause, and then herrings in a state of mash and potatoes like iron. [...] "Send the potatoes out to Prussia for grape-shot," [...] was the suggestion. I dined off broken herrings and dry bread. At last [...] "the supreme moment comes," [...] and the fowl in a lordly dish is carried in. On the cover being raised, there is something so forlorn and miserable about the aspect of the animal that we both roar with laughter. Then Bough, taking up knife and fork, turns the [...] "swarry" [...] over and over, shaking doubtfully his head. [...] "There's an aspect of quiet resistance about the beggar," [...] says he, [...] "that looks bad." [...] However, to work he falls until the sweat stands on his brow and a dismembered leg falls, dull and leaden-like, on to my dish. To eat it was simply impossible. I did not know before that flesh could be so tough. [...] "The strongest jaws in England," [...] says Bough piteously, <b>harpooning</b> his dry morsel, [...] "couldn't eat this leg in less than twelve hours." [...] Nothing for it now, but to order boat and bill. [...] "That fowl," [...] says Bough to the landlady, [...] "is of a breed I know. I knew the cut of its jib whenever it was put down. That was the grandmother of the cock that frightened Peter."--"I thought it was a historical animal," [...] says I. [...] "What a shame to kill it. It's as bad as eating Whittington's cat or the Dog of Montargis."--"Na--na, it's no so old," [...] says the landlady, [...] "but it eats hard."--"Eats!" [...] I cry, [...] "where do you find that? Very little of that verb with us." [...] So with more raillery, we pay six shillings for our festival and run over to Earraid, shaking the dust of the Argyll Hotel from off our feet.|$|E
50|$|The {{toggling}} <b>harpoon</b> is {{an ancient}} weapon and tool used in whaling to impale a whale when thrown. Unlike earlier <b>harpoon</b> versions which had only one point, a toggling <b>harpoon</b> has a two-part point. One half of the point is firmly attached to the thrusting base, while {{the other half of}} the point is fitted over this first point like a cap and attached to the rest of the point with sinew or another string-like material. When the <b>harpoon</b> is thrust into an animal, the top half of the point detaches and twists horizontally into the animal under the skin, making it virtually impossible to pull the rest of the attached <b>harpoon</b> out of the animal while pulling it back to ship or shore. This <b>harpoon</b> technology lodges the toggling head of the <b>harpoon</b> underneath both the animal's skin and blubber, and instead lodges the point in the muscle, which also prevents the <b>harpoon</b> slipping out.|$|R

5000|$|In {{the mid-19th}} century the one flue <b>harpoon</b> was {{replaced}} by the toggling <b>harpoon,</b> which was an iron version of the ancient design used in the Arctic by the native whale hunters there. The toggling iron <b>harpoon</b> was even more successful and rapidly phased out the use of the [...] "common harpoon" [...] (a term which refers to either the one or two flue <b>harpoon).</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Harpoons</b> {{were also}} called throwing-arrows when the pointed head fit loosely into the socket of the {{foreshaft}} {{and the head}} was able to detach from the <b>harpoon</b> when it penetrated an animal, and remain in the wound. There were three main kinds of <b>harpoon</b> that the Aleut’s used: a simple <b>harpoon,</b> with a head that kept its original position in the animal after striking, a compound (toggle-head) <b>harpoon</b> in which the head took a horizontal position in the animal after penetration, and the throwing-lance used to kill large animals.|$|R
5000|$|In 1848 Lewis Temple, an African-American {{blacksmith}} in New Bedford, Massachusetts {{adapted the}} toggling <b>harpoon</b> using a wooden shear pin to initially brace the toggle head, and created {{what came to}} be known as Temple's Toggle and later simply as the toggle iron or iron toggle <b>harpoon.</b> This <b>harpoon</b> became a whaling standard and replaced the fixed-point [...] "two flue" [...] and [...] "single flue" [...] <b>harpoons</b> that were widely used previously.|$|R
50|$|Since the <b>harpooning</b> {{reaction}} is a two-body process {{it does not}} need so high pressure like for three-body reaction. So, the <b>harpooning</b> reaction makes available the excilamps operating at a low pressure of working mixture.

Reaction (3) provides the bulk of the exciplex molecules and generally the <b>harpooning</b> reactions play a secondary role. When helium is used, in contrast, the <b>harpooning</b> reactions contributes about 10-15% of [...] synthesis. Other authors only estimate this contribution at 1% when the ionic pathway is involved. These theoretical conclusions are confirmed by experimental methods for the generality of the buffer gases and for other chlorine donors. The [...] "harpoon" [...] reactions, notwithstanding, are important despite their low contributions. These harpoon reactions are the reactions which are set in motion after the first excitation. Ionic recombinations, which then provide the bulk of the exciplex molecules, kick off 20 ns later.|$|E
50|$|The two flue <b>harpoon</b> was {{the primary}} weapon used in whaling around the world, but it cut through the blubber when under stress. This flaw was {{corrected}} {{with the creation of}} the single flue harpoon; by removing one of the flues, the head of the <b>harpoon</b> was narrowed, making it easier for it to penetrate deep enough to hold fast. In the Arctic, the indigenous people used the more advanced toggling <b>harpoon</b> design. In the early 19th century the one flue <b>harpoon</b> was introduced, which reduced failed <b>harpoons</b> due to the head cutting its way out of the body of the whale. In the mid-19th century, the toggling <b>harpoon</b> was adapted by Lewis Temple, using iron. The Temple toggle was widely used, and quickly came to dominate whaling.|$|R
