5|$|After {{leaving the}} presidency, Johnson {{remained}} for some weeks in Washington, {{then returned to}} Greeneville {{for the first time}} in eight years. He was honored with large public celebrations along the way, especially in Tennessee, where cities hostile to him during the war <b>hung</b> <b>out</b> welcome banners. He had arranged to purchase a large farm near Greeneville to live on after his presidency.|$|E
5|$|Beghe {{was born}} March 12, 1960, in New York City, and has three siblings. He {{attended}} the Collegiate School, a private preparatory school for boys located in New York City. While there, he became best friends with John F. Kennedy, Jr. and actor David Duchovny. Kennedy and Beghe often <b>hung</b> <b>out</b> together outside the Metropolitan Museum of Art and in Central Park, and were monitored by Kennedy's Secret Service detail. As a teenager, Beghe attended summer camp with Erik Rush, now a conservative columnist and author.|$|E
5|$|Early line-ups of the Strand—sometimes {{known as}} the Swankers—also {{included}} Jim Mackin on organ and Stephen Hayes (and later, briefly, Del Noones) on bass. The band members regularly <b>hung</b> <b>out</b> at two clothing shops on the Kings Road in Chelsea, London: John Krivine and Steph Raynor's Acme Attractions (where Don Letts worked as manager) and Malcolm McLaren and Vivienne Westwood's Too Fast to Live, Too Young to Die.|$|E

60|$|Six? There were seven; but in charity to the biographer {{the seventh}} {{ought not to}} be exposed. Still, he <b>hung</b> it <b>out</b> himself, and not only <b>hung</b> it <b>out,</b> but {{thought it was a good}} point in Shelley's favor. For two years Shelley found sympathy and {{intellectual}} food and all that at home; there was enough for spiritual and mental support, but not enough for luxury; and so, at the end of the contented two years, this latter detail justifies him in going bag and baggage over to Cornelia Turner and supplying the rest of his need in the way of surplus sympathy and intellectual pie unlawfully. By the same reasoning a man in merely comfortable circumstances may rob a bank without sin.|$|R

5|$|Inside the LBC, {{visitors}} {{pass through}} a number of exhibits about the bell before reaching the Liberty Bell itself. Due to security concerns following an attack on the bell by a visitor with a hammer in 2001, the bell is <b>hung</b> <b>out</b> of easy reach of visitors, who are no longer allowed to touch it, and all visitors undergo a security screening.|$|E
5|$|The {{memorial}} {{was unveiled}} on Whit Monday, 16 May 1921, by Edward, Prince of Wales (later King Edward VIII), with Lutyens in attendance. At the unveiling ceremony, Lord Fortescue {{gave a speech}} in which he estimated that 11,600 {{men and women from}} Devon had been killed while serving in the war. He later stated that some 63,700 (8,000 regulars, 36,700 volunteers, and 19,000 conscripts) had served in the armed forces. The names of the fallen were recorded on a roll of honour, of which three copies were made: one for Exeter Cathedral, one to be held by the county council, and one which the Prince of Wales placed in a hollow in the base of the war memorial. The prince's visit generated considerable excitement in the area. Thousands of people lined the street to greet his motorcade and shops on the High Street <b>hung</b> <b>out</b> banners with welcoming messages. After the unveiling, Edward spent ten days touring the local area.|$|E
5|$|David Adler's book {{contains}} {{a detailed account}} of the event that made the Fool's Gold Loaf sandwich famous. On the night of February 1, 1976, Elvis Presley was at his home at Graceland in Memphis, entertaining Capt. Jerry Kennedy of the Denver, Colorado police force, and Ron Pietrafeso of Colorado's Strike Force Against Crime. The three men began discussing the sandwich, and Presley decided he wanted one right then. Presley had been to the restaurant before, while in Denver. Kennedy and Pietrafeso were friends of the owners and <b>hung</b> <b>out</b> there often, so they were driven to the Memphis airport and boarded Presley's private jet, the Lisa Marie, and flew the two hours to Denver. When they arrived at Stapleton International Airport at 1:40 AM, the plane taxied to a special hangar where the passengers were greeted by Buck Scott, the owner of the Colorado Mine Company, and his wife Cindy who had brought 30 fresh Fool's Gold Loaves for the men. They spent two hours in the hangar eating the sandwiches, washing them down with Perrier and champagne. Presley invited the pilots of the plane, Milo High and Elwood Davis, to join them. When they were done, they flew back to Memphis without ever having left the Denver airport.|$|E

6000|$|... "Besides, I {{was a mere}} youngster," [...] Graham added. [...] "Though {{that meant}} nothing much. There was a young German tackled {{it at the same}} time I did, with a tenth of my capital. He <b>hung</b> it <b>out,</b> lean years, dry years, and all. He's rated in seven figures now." ...|$|R

25|$|Starkad {{killed the}} nine {{brothers}} but had received seventeen wounds himself, {{and was so}} seriously wounded that his guts <b>hung</b> <b>out.</b> He refused the care of three lowly passers-by, but accepted the treatment of a peasant's son, and could return to Sweden.|$|E
25|$|Initially, Paramount Records {{had been}} McTell's American label {{but had not}} been supportive, and he later signed with Warner Bros. Records.

60|$|Between {{them they}} pushed her nearly out, and then, with Cyril's assistance, John got her across his shoulders. She {{was a heavy}} woman, and the old sailor had great {{difficulty}} in carrying her down. Cyril <b>hung</b> far <b>out</b> of the window till he saw him put {{his foot on the}} ground; then he seized a rung of the ladder, swung himself out on to it, and was soon down.|$|R
5000|$|For {{the most}} part, however, the protests were {{peaceful}} — if often tense. Students at New York University, for example, <b>hung</b> a banner <b>out</b> {{of a window}} which read [...] "They Can't Kill Us All." ...|$|R

Joseph Bagstock, Sir, was held {{out of the window}} by the heels of his boots, for {{thirteen}} minutes by the college clock.' ...|$|R
25|$|During the Battle of the Brávellir {{between the}} Swedish king Sigurd Ring (Ringo) and Harald Wartooth (Haraldus Hyldetan), Starkad fought on the Swedish side.

25|$|Born in Indianapolis, Gordon {{began playing}} sports at the JCC at four, playing soccer, {{and then moved}} quickly on to basketball. He also played {{football}} but his true love was basketball. At the age of 7 he began playing competitive basketball at the historical Municipal Gardens. He {{spent much of his}} time across the street from his home at the Jewish Community Center of Indianapolis, where he played basketball, swam and <b>hung</b> <b>out</b> with friends. It was at the JCC that Gordon announced his departure from college to enter his name into the NBA Draft.|$|E
25|$|In 1813, Halbertsma married Tetsje Sjollema (1793–1836). She {{was from}} Grou, {{and he had}} known her {{for all of his}} life. A year after she died, he remarried, to Reinskje van der Goot (1807–1862), who was also from Grou. When this second {{marriage}} was contracted, he ordered fifty flags to be <b>hung</b> <b>out</b> in the village, and he gave away a fat cow to the poor. One of Halbertsma's sons from his first marriage, Johannes Tsjallings Halbertsma (1827–1884), took over the dairy trade after his father's death, and moved it to the city of Sneek. There Halbertsma's grandsons Hylke (1857–1932) and Herrius (1864–1920) established the dairy Normandia in 1888.|$|E
60|$|The elk was <b>hung</b> up <b>out</b> of {{the reach}} of any wild beasts that might be prowling around, and the next day Henry and Sam Barringford skinned the animal and cut up the meat as Mrs. Morris desired it. The tongue was smoked, {{a small part of the}} {{forequarter}} pickled, and the remainder kept fresh by being hung up where it was cold. That day they dined on elk steaks and all pronounced the fresh meat very acceptable.|$|R
60|$|Before {{the little}} Town Hall, {{the tower of}} which, sorely battered, yet unyielding, seemed to symbolise {{the spirit of the}} garrison, Sir George White and his staff sat on their {{skeleton}} horses. Opposite to them were drawn up the pipers of the Gordon Highlanders. The townsfolk, hollow-eyed but jubilant, crowded the pavement and the windows of the houses. Everyone who could find a flag had <b>hung</b> it <b>out,</b> but we needed no bright colours to raise our spirits.|$|R
60|$|But I saw the stroke, and, {{springing}} {{high into}} the air, avoided it. Then I turned and fled very swiftly, and after me came certain of the soldiers. The way was not far to the last company of the People of the Axe; moreover, it saw me coming, and, headed by Umslopogaas, who walked behind them all, ran to meet me. Then the soldiers who followed to kill me <b>hung</b> back <b>out</b> of reach of the axe.|$|R
25|$|During his {{frequent}} trips to Pakistan, Gilani <b>hung</b> <b>out</b> with heroin users and started using the drug himself. He {{became involved in}} Pakistani drug trafficking. When he was twenty-four, Gilani smuggled half a kilogram of heroin out of Pakistani tribal areas and used Tahawwur Hussain Rana, a Pakistani army doctor who Gilani knew from military school, as an unwitting shield. Several days later, police in Lahore arrested Gilani for drug possession, but he somehow managed to beat the charges. Rana continued {{to be used by}} Gilani {{over the course of his}} career as a drug trafficker; in the late 1990s, after Rana had emigrated to the U.S., Gilani used Rana's legitimate immigration consulting company in Chicago to smuggle drugs.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, Keith went to Nashville, Tennessee, where he <b>hung</b> <b>out</b> and busked on Music Row {{and at a}} place called Houndogs. He {{distributed}} copies of a demo tape the band had made to the many record companies in the city. There was no interest by any of the record labels, and Keith returned home feeling depressed. He had promised himself and God to have a recording contract {{by the time he was}} 30 years old or give up on music as a career. A flight attendant and fan of his gave a copy of Keith's demo tape to Harold Shedd, a Mercury Records executive, while he was traveling on a flight she was working. Shedd enjoyed what he heard, went to see Keith perform live and then signed him to a recording contract with Mercury.|$|E
25|$|On December 30, the New York Post {{reported}} that several sanitation workers confessed that cleanup was intentionally slowed down {{to protest the}} aforementioned budget cuts. On January 3, 2011, WCBS-TV {{reported that}} prosecutors had obtained a video of two sanitation trucks driving down 155th Street in Whitestone, Queens after the blizzard with their plows raised {{so as not to}} remove the snow. Allegations were also made that sanitation workers slept on the job, <b>hung</b> <b>out</b> at a doughnut shop for 11 straight hours while on the job, and drank beer for six or seven hours while on the job. Claims were also made that supervisors encouraged such work stoppages. However, a month later, the New York Times reported that the allegations of a slowdown remained unsubstantiated and that Councilman Daniel Halloran, who had originally reported the confessions, had not named his sources.|$|E

60|$|The herd {{had opened}} up; the mothers had fallen {{back to the}} rear; the calves <b>hung</b> almost <b>out</b> of sight under the shaggy sides of protectors. To try them out Jones darted close and threw his lasso. It struck a cow. With {{activity}} incredible in such a huge beast, she lunged at him. Kentuck, expecting just such a move, wheeled to safety. This duel, ineffectual on both sides, kept up for a while, and all the time, man and herd were jogging rapidly to the north.|$|R
25|$|At age nine, Mitchell {{contracted}} polio in an epidemic, and was hospitalised for weeks. No longer athletic, {{she turned}} her thoughts to her creative talent, and considered a singing or dancing career for the first time. By nine, she was a smoker; she denies claims that smoking has affected her voice. At 11, she moved with her family {{to the city of}} Saskatoon, which she considers her hometown. She responded badly to formal education, preferring a freethinking outlook, and was drawn to art, a pursuit often regarded as peripheral at the time. One unconventional teacher did manage to make an impact on her, stimulating her to write poetry, and her first album includes a dedication to him. In twelfth grade, she flunked out (though she later picked up her studies) and <b>hung</b> <b>out</b> downtown with a rowdy set until deciding that she was getting too close to the criminal world.|$|E
25|$|On Friday, April 12, Martin {{drove to}} Texarkana, from Kilgore. That night, he stayed with his friend, Tom Albritton, at Martin's Texarkana {{residence}} at 1222 Locust (now 1224). The {{next day he}} <b>hung</b> <b>out</b> with Booker at her house during the afternoon. He then picked her up from her regular Saturday night gig at the VFW Club on W. 4th and Oak street Sunday morning around 2 a.m. He was found shot to death four hours later, his body lying on its left side beside {{the north side of}} North Park Road, {{a mile and a half}} from his car. He was buried two days later at his church, Beech Street Baptist, on April 16, at 10 a.m. during heavy rainfall. His mother stated that she had objected to his trip to Texarkana, not due to danger in the town, but because she feared he might wreck his car while driving alone.|$|E
25|$|One travel experience, {{undertaken}} {{by hundreds of}} thousands of hippies between 1969 and 1971, was the Hippie trail overland route to India. Carrying little or no luggage, and with small amounts of cash, almost all followed the same route, hitch-hiking across Europe to Athens and on to Istanbul, then by train through central Turkey via Erzurum, continuing by bus into Iran, via Tabriz and Tehran to Mashhad, across the Afghan border into Herat, through southern Afghanistan via Kandahar to Kabul, over the Khyber Pass into Pakistan, via Rawalpindi and Lahore to the Indian frontier. Once in India, hippies went to many different destinations, but gathered in large numbers on the beaches of Goa and Kovalam in Trivandrum (Kerala), or crossed the border into Nepal to spend months in Kathmandu. In Kathmandu, most of the hippies <b>hung</b> <b>out</b> in the tranquil surroundings of a place called Freak Street, (Nepal Bhasa: Jhoo Chhen) which still exists near Kathmandu Durbar Square.|$|E

5000|$|Irish men {{and women}} both {{had a hard time}} finding skilled work in the U.S. due to the stigmas of being both Irish as well as Catholic. Prejudices ran deep in the north and could be seen in {{newspaper}} cartoons depicting Irish men as drunkards and Irish women as prostitutes. Many businesses <b>hung</b> signs <b>out</b> front of their shops that read [...] "No Irish Need Apply", or [...] "NINA" [...] for short. The initial backlash the Irish received in America lead to their self-imposed seclusion, making assimilation into society a long and painful process.|$|R
