40|$|This study {{proposes a}} linearity-enhanced time-domain {{complementary}} metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) thermostat with process-variation calibration for improving the accuracy, expanding the operating temperature range, and reducing test costs. For sensing temperatures in the time domain, the large characteristic curve of a CMOS inverter markedly affects the accuracy, particularly when the operating temperature range is increased. To enhance the on-chip linearity, this study proposes a novel temperature-sensing cell comprising a simple buffer and a buffer with a thermal-compensation circuit to achieve a linearised delay. Thus, a linearity-enhanced oscillator consisting of these cells can generate an oscillation period with high linearity. To achieve one-point calibration support, an adjustable-gain time stretcher and calibration circuit were adopted for the process-variation calibration. The programmable temperature set point was determined using a reference clock and a second (identical) adjustable-gain time stretcher. A delay-time comparator with a built-in customised <b>hysteresis</b> <b>circuit</b> was used to perform a time comparison to obtain an appropriate response. Based on the proposed design, a thermostat with a small area of 0. 067 mm 2 was fabricated using a TSMC 0. 35 -μm 2 P 4 M CMOS process, and a robust resolution of 0. 05 °C and dissipation of 25 μW were achieved at a sample rate of 10 samples/s. An inaccuracy of − 0. 35 °C to 1. 35 °C was achieved after one-point calibration at temperatures ranging from − 40 °C to 120 °C. Compared with existing thermostats, the proposed thermostat substantially improves the circuit area, accuracy, operating temperature range, and test costs...|$|E
40|$|Radio {{frequency}} over glass (RFoG) is a fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) network. An RFoG {{network is}} essentially a hybrid fiber coaxial (HFC) network, whose coaxial portion has been replaced with a passive point-to-multipoint optical network. Thus, the fiber is brought {{all the way to}} subscriber homes. Downstream and upstream transmissions share the same optical fiber, which is enabled by wavelength division multiplexing. The downstream and upstream signals are transmitted using semiconductor lasers with wavelengths of 1550 nm, and 1310 or 1610 nm, respectively. A radio frequency over glass optical networking unit (R-ONU), also called the micronode, is located at customer premises. A micronode is basically an optical-to-electrical converter: its receiver converts optical downstream signals into electrical and its transmitter electrical upstream signals into optical. The downstream signals are continuous, whereas the upstream signals coming in from the home cable modem operate in burst mode. When an upstream signal is not present in the coaxial input, the bias current of the transmitting laser is turned off. The upstream transmitter turns on when an upstream signal coming from the cable modem is detected. On turn-on, the bias current of the laser is switched on and the upstream RF signal is fed to the laser. This will lead to amplitude modulated (AM) optical signal, where the carrier is the optical power of the laser and the modulating signal the upstream RF signal. The objective of this thesis was to design a concept that enables the burst mode operation of an RFoG micronode upstream transmitter. Different components and electrical architectures were evaluated and compared in order to achieve a design that met the laser turn-on/turn-off requirements of Society of Cable Telecommunications Engineers (SCTE) Radio Frequency over Glass Specification. The specification states that a micronode upstream laser must exhibit turn-on and turn-off times of 1. 3 us and 1. 6 us, respectively. In addition, the specification sets ranges for input RF powers for which the laser must turn on and off. The proposed concept was proven to be suitable for an RFoG micronode. The design achieved turn-on and turn-off times of 700 ns and 600 ns, respectively. It is also shown that by utilizing a <b>hysteresis</b> <b>circuit</b> in a voltage comparator, the range of input powers for laser turn-on and turn-off can be adjusted to meet the specification. Teleste Corporation, for whom this thesis was written, offers a great portfolio in HFC network optical node products.

25|$|Positive {{feedback}} {{occurs when}} the fed-back signal is in phase with the input signal. Under certain gain conditions, positive feedback reinforces the input signal {{to the point where}} the output of the device oscillates between its maximum and minimum possible states. Positive feedback may also introduce <b>hysteresis</b> into a <b>circuit.</b> This can cause the circuit to ignore small signals and respond only to large ones. It is sometimes used to eliminate noise from a digital signal. Under some circumstances, positive feedback may cause a device to latch, i.e., to reach a condition in which the output is locked to its maximum or minimum state. This fact is very widely used in digital electronics to make bistable circuits for volatile storage of information.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The {{conventional}} flip-flop core is {{generalized to}} mul-tistability in full static CMOS without compromising the standard binary CMOS {{features such as}} ratioless device sizing, negligible static power consumption, and wide noise margins.

Simulations indicate the possibility of six-level storage in 5 -V operation. The cell retains noise margins one threshold voltage wide even at such high-level operation.

For near optimum operation: in this mode, however, an accurate system model is required to facilitate controller design. Such a model must be comprehensive and {{take account of the}} non-linearities inherent in the system. The result is a complex formulation which can be made manageable with a computational aid. A digital simulation of a hybrid type {{stepping motor}} and its associated drive circuit is proposed. The simulation is based upon a block diagram model which includes reasonable approximations to the major non-linearities. The simulation is shown to yield accurate performance predictions. The determination of the transfer functions is based upon the consideration of the physical processes involved rather than upon direct input-outout measurements. The effects of eddy currents, saturation, <b>hysteresis,</b> drive <b>circuit</b> characteristics and non-linear torque displacement characteristics are considered and methods of determining transfer functions, which take account of these effects, are offered. The static torque displacement characteristic is considered in detail and a model is proposed which predicts static torque for any combination of phase currents and shaft position. Methods of predicting the characteristic directly from machine geometry are investigated. Drive circuit design for high efficiency operation is considered and a model of a bipolar, bilevel circuit is proposed. The transfers between stator voltage and stator current and between stator current and air gap flux are complicated by the effects of eddy currents, saturation and hysteresis. Frequency response methods, combined with average inductance measurements, are shown to yield reasonable transfer functions.

40|$|Atomtronics is an {{emerging}} interdisciplinary field that seeks new functionality by creating devices and circuits where ultra-cold atoms, often superfluids, {{play a role}} analogous to the electrons in electronics. Hysteresis is widely used in electronic circuits, e. g., it is routinely observed in superconducting circuits and is essential in rf-superconducting quantum interference devices [SQUIDs]. Furthermore, hysteresis is as fundamental to superfluidity (and superconductivity) as quantized persistent currents, critical velocity, and Josephson effects. Nevertheless, in spite of multiple theoretical predictions, hysteresis has not been previously observed in any superfluid, atomic-gas Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). Here we demonstrate hysteresis in a quantized atomtronic circuit: a ring of superfluid BEC obstructed by a rotating weak link. We directly detect hysteresis between quantized circulation states, in contrast to superfluid liquid helium experiments that observed hysteresis directly in systems where the quantization of flow could not be observed and indirectly in systems that showed quantized flow. Our techniques allow us to tune {{the size of the}} hysteresis loop and to consider the fundamental excitations that accompany hysteresis. The results suggest that the relevant excitations involved in hysteresis are vortices and indicate that dissipation {{plays an important role in}} the dynamics.

The direct current (DC) component {{generated in the}} inverter parallel system makes the output filter inductor of inverter be saturation, uneven thermal and electrical stress of each electrical module, which reduce {{the reliability of the}} inverter parallel driving system (Chen et al. 2003). In order to inhibit the DC circulating current, there are some developed methods such as voltage and current double close-loop control, three-state <b>hysteresis</b> control, filter <b>circuit</b> elimination and regulation of the reference sine wave DC component (Chen et al. 2004; He and Xu 2012; He and Zhang 2008). Zhang et al. analyzed the case of two inverters sharing a rectifier module, which will produce a zero sequence circulation current through the DC bus and consume a lot of energy, reduce the efficiency of the system and cause saturation of filter reactor (2006 a). Therefore, inverter units in parallel were suggested to adopt a separate rectifier modules. Zhang et al. (2006 b) and Liu et al. (2011) analyzed the presence of harmonic circulating current caused by dead zone dispersion of switch, delay of driving circuit and over modulation, of which the dead zone of switch is the most influenced component. In recent years, some inhibition technologies of harmonic circulation current are proposed, including control method of the instantaneous voltage feedback, repetitive control method and dual-loop control method of voltage and current (Ogasawara et al. 1992; Kawakami et al. 1994).|$|R

Reliability, robustness and low cost are other important factors. In the Saab Gripen aircraft, {{the design of the}} primary power supply of the electric flight control system was updated by exchanging a switching transistor regulator to a magnetic amplifier (magamp). By introducing a magamp design, weight was saved and a more reliable power supply system at a lower cost was achieved. In this particular case, with the power supply of the electric flight control system in the Saab Gripen fighter, advantage could be taken of a specific permanent magnet generator (PM-generator). The frequency of the generator offered the perfect conditions for a magamp controller. A key parameter in designing magnetic amplifiers (magamps) is low losses. New amorphous alloys offer new possibilities of the technique in designing magnetic amplifiers, because of their extremely low losses.
