5|$|Willis then {{returned}} to England, to face India and Pakistan, playing in one Test against each. Against India he took 4/64 – a career best against that team – and made a Test best 24 with the bat. Pakistan toured in early August, and Willis featured in one Test. <b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>one</b> wicket for 133 runs. He also played one ODI where <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>one</b> wicket caught and bowled as Pakistan achieved a seven wicket victory. At this point, Willis was suffering from a recurring back injury. He played 13 Championship games for Warwickshire during the 1974 season, taking 44 wickets at 21.56 including one five-wicket haul. In November, Willis touring Australia during the 1974/75 Ashes series, playing in five Test matches. He took 17 Test wickets at 30.70, including a best of 5/42, out of 26 first-class wickets at 31.19 overall. He was, however, playing with growing injury concerns which required several painkilling injections.|$|E
5|$|During the 1928–29 Inter-Colonial Tournament, Small {{took four}} for 14 in Trinidad's first match, but contributed little else as Trinidad won the competition. Later in the year, he took seven for 77 for a West Indies XI against an English {{team led by}} Julien Cahn which was playing in Jamaica; he and two others joined the Jamaican team for this game. Trinidad lost to British Guiana in the 1929–30 tournament, and Small did little in the game. An MCC team toured West Indies again that season, and Small played in one of Trinidad's two matches against the touring team. Although he was not successful, he was chosen for the second Test of the four-match series between England and West Indies, played in Trinidad. <b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>one</b> wicket and scored 20 and 5 in the match. This was his final Test match. In three Test matches, he scored 79 runs {{at an average of}} 13.16 and took 3 wickets at 61.33.|$|E
5|$|<b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>one</b> {{touch to}} control a long 60-yard aerial pass from Frank de Boer, brought the ball down through Argentine defender Roberto Ayala's legs, and finally {{finished}} by firing a volley with the outside of his right foot, past keeper Carlos Roa at a tight angle from the right. The goal, cited by Bergkamp as his favourite in his career, was his 36th for the national team, overtaking Faas Wilkes as the record goalscorer. In the semi-finals, the Netherlands lost to Brazil on penalties after drawing 1–1 in normal time. Bergkamp made the All-Star team of the tournament, alongside Frank de Boer and Edgar Davids.|$|E

5|$|Macartney had a {{moderately}} successful debut. He bowled three wicketless overs {{in the first}} innings, before scoring 35 in Australia's reply while batting at No. 7. <b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>one</b> wicket, that of leading English batsman Wilfred Rhodes. With Australia needing 274 runs {{to win in the}} second innings, Noble decided that Macartney's first innings effort warranted promotion to act as Trumper's opening partner. He managed to score only nine, but Australia managed to scrape home to seal a two wicket victory. Macartney's domestic form after his Test debut was sufficient for him to retain his position for the Second Test in Melbourne. Noble persevered with Macartney as Trumper's opening partner and he scored 37 of an 84 run opening partnership in the first innings. He returned to the middle order in the second innings to score 54 and took a total of 1/55 as England squared the series with a narrow one wicket victory.|$|E
5|$|Small {{made his}} {{first-class}} debut for Trinidad on 11 November 1909, playing against a team chosen by WC Shepherd. Small scored 13 and 0 in the match and bowled two over {{without taking a}} wicket. The following January, Small made his first appearance for Trinidad in the Inter-Colonial Tournament; he scored seven runs in his only innings and took four for 16 in British Guiana's first innings. In the final against Barbados, <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>one</b> wicket {{in the game and}} scored 17 and 8 in his two innings. Trinidad won the match. Later that year, Small played against Barbados again, in the final of the next Inter-Colonial Tournament, but had little success in that match, nor in the 1912 tournament when his best score in two games was 15 runs, and he took a total of three wickets. In both instances, Barbados won the tournament.|$|E
5|$|In 1902, {{during the}} {{presidency}} of Julio Argentino Roca, Belgrano's body was exhumed from the atrium of Santo Domingo, to be moved into a mausoleum. This was done on 4 September, by a government commission which included Dr. Joaquín V. González (ministry of interior), Pablo Riccheri (ministry of war), Gabriel L. Souto (president of the commission), Fray Modesto Becco (from the convent), Carlos Vega Belgrano and coronel Manuel Belgrano (descendants of Belgrano), Dr. Armando Claros (subsecretary of the Interior), Dr. Marcial Quiroga (Health Inspector of the Army), Dr. Carlos Malbrán (president of the National Department of Health), Coronel Justo Domínguez, and doctors Luis Peluffo and C. Massot (Arsenal of War). The exhumation revealed a number of preserved bones, pieces of wood, and nails. The bones were placed on a silver plate, and the following day {{there was a great}} controversy in the press: the newspaper La Prensa announced that Joaquín V. González and Riccheri had stolen a pair of teeth. Both were returned the following day. Gonzalez declared that he intended to show the tooth to his friends, and Riccheri that <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>one</b> to Belgrano's biographer, Bartolomé Mitre.|$|E

5|$|Ring then {{played against}} Middlesex in Australia's only match before the Fourth Test. <b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>one</b> wicket in each innings for a match total of 2/57. After only scoring {{two in the}} first innings, Ring opened the batting with McCool in the second innings, with a target of only 22runs. They {{promptly}} reached the target without loss, with Ring unbeaten on 15. This was not enough for Ring to force {{his way into the}} team for the Fourth Test at Headingley. Australia persisted with the same bowling attack and posted 3/404 in the second innings, setting a world record for the highest successful run-chase to win a Test. Former Australian Test leg spinner Bill O'Reilly criticised the Australians for using only one spinner, pointing out that he and Chuck Fleetwood-Smith, a left-arm wrist spinner, had taken 17 wickets between them during the last Anglo-Australian Test at Headingley in 1938. O'Reilly cited the 1934 Headingley Test the same venue in 1934 in which he and Clarrie Grimmett had significant success for Australia, and said {{that at least one of}} McCool or Ring, should have played alongside Johnson. England had been at 2/423 in their first innings, before collapsing to be 496 all out; O'Reilly blamed Australia's lack of early success on the absence of a leg spinner, attributing England's collapse to inept batting.|$|E
5|$|Verity {{regained his}} place in the team for the third Test, {{replacing}} Bowes. The match was highly controversial owing to England's continued and increased use of Bodyline tactics. Verity's main contributions to the match came from his batting: he shared partnerships worth over 90 runs in both innings, scoring 45runs in the first innings and 40 in the second. <b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>one</b> wicket in the game; after 16wicketless overs in the first innings, Verity dismissed Bradman in the second, his first Test wicket against Australia, and England won the match by 338runs. After the third Test, the MCC played New South Wales again. Rain before the beginning of the third day affected the pitch; Bradman, possibly irritated by a minor show of bravado from Verity, scored 71 in conditions which should have been perfect for the Yorkshireman, who took only two wickets. During the fourth Test, Verity took few wickets but Wisden noted that he kept a good length and prevented the Australian batsmen scoring quickly. His batting was important once more. In their first innings, England had lost eight wickets, and were still 76runs behind Australia's score when Verity joined Paynter, who had left a hospital bed where he had been confined with tonsillitis. The two men scored 92runs together, to give England a small lead. Verity scored 23 not out in two-and-three-quarter hours, although he was lucky not to be dismissed several times. Australia were bowled out in their second innings and Verity took two wickets; England scored the required runs to record a six-wicket win which ensured victory in the series—and the Ashes. Verity's bowling was most successful in the final Test, when Jardine allowed him to depart from his role of restricting the batsmen's scoring and bowl a more attacking line and length in an attempt to take wickets. Having taken three for 62 in Australia's first innings, he took five for 33 in the second, assisted by a worn pitch that helped him to spin the ball. He dismissed Bradman for 71 and later took two wickets with successive deliveries.|$|E
25|$|In the {{following}} season of 1927 Morton started umpiring first class matches taking around 300 until {{he retired in}} 1934 the year before he died. <b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>one</b> Test match in 1928.|$|E

25|$|In the 1894–95 season, Broad {{played for}} Nelson against the touring Fijian team. Opening the batting in each innings, he scored 17 and 80 runs, respectively. <b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>one</b> wicket in each innings, bowling one {{over in the}} first and four in the second.

25|$|He {{made his}} ODI {{debut in the}} fifth and final match of India's home series against Sri Lanka in December 2009 at the Feroz Shah Kotla. <b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>one</b> wicket as India bowled first, but his debut was cut short when the umpires ended the match midway through the Sri Lankan innings after deeming the pitch to be unsafe.|$|E

In 2009, the stand was still Somerset's ninth-wicket List A cricket record and the oldest surviving List A record.|$|E
