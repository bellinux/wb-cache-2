It served the environmental needs of the U.S. Army by facilitating the identification and clean-up of contaminants on training lands, due primarily to partially detonated explosives or unexploded ordnance (UXO). Other researchers addressed mobility issues with vehicles over snow and muddy terrain. CRREL researchers participated in defining tactical runway requirements for the C-17 military transport aircraft.|$|E

A 1978 study evaluated the potential use of synthetic aperture radar to achieve 200 meter resolution. The spacecraft was to be launched from the Space Shuttle using a twin stage IUS in December 1984, and arrive in orbit May 1985. The mission was expected to last until November 1985.|$|E

5000|$|... ==== Haystack Radar operations==== The Long-Range <b>Imaging</b> <b>Radar</b> (LRIR) {{system was}} {{originally}} designed to function as an X-band long-range <b>imaging</b> <b>radar.</b> In wideband mode, LRIR runs at 10 GHz with a 1.024 GHz bandwidth. The system was capable of sensitivity of 25 cm resolution, allowing for tracking and imaging satellites out to geostationary orbit distances, as well as deep space objects out to 40000 km range. The radar was upgraded with a completely new antenna capable of dual-band operations, called Haystack Ultrawideband Satellite <b>Imaging</b> <b>Radar</b> (HUSIR). The system is capable of simultaneous operations in X band and W-band, which allows it to better determine the size, shape, orientation, and motion of orbiting objects. The HUSIR design allows for tracking object with 0.5 millidegree accuracy. [...] The W-band operates between 92 and 100 GHz, with a bandwidth of 8 GHz. The system contributes data to the United States Space Surveillance Network (SSN).|$|E

30|$|The {{scope of}} this article is to {{describe}} the signal processing algorithms required to convert GNSS satellites into bistatic <b>imaging</b> <b>radars.</b> Two types of algorithms are needed for this purpose: signal synchronisation and image formation. The signal synchronisation algorithm is a modification of the BASS algorithm, a communications signal processing technique normally used in GNSS for navigation purposes. With regards to image formation, a bistatic BPA has been developed specifically for this topology. The algorithm is generic in the sense that it can accommodate all GNSS transmitting systems, and both moving and fixed receiver configurations, with all their peculiarities. The proposed algorithms were applied to real data collected from a number of topologies, including different GNSS transmitters and different types of receivers, including fixed, onboard a ground moving vehicle or an aircraft. The obtained results highlight not only the functionality of the proposed algorithms, but also the feasibility of the overall system itself. With the advent and progression of the GNSS market, it is believed that GNSS-based <b>radars</b> and <b>imaging</b> <b>radars</b> in particular are a new emerging technology.|$|R
