5000|$|Transparent OXCs (optical switching) - Switching optical {{signals in}} an all-optical device {{is the second}} {{approach}} to realize an OXC. Such a switch is often called a transparent OXC or photonic cross-connect (PXC). Specifically, optical signals are <b>demultiplexed,</b> then the <b>demultiplexed</b> wavelengths are switched by optical switch modules. After switching, the optical signals are multiplexed onto output fibers by optical multiplexers. Such a switch architecture keeps the features of data rate and protocol transparency. However, because the signals are kept in the optical format, the transparent OXC architecture does not allow easy optical signal quality monitoring.|$|E

50|$|The ideal dual-polarization system lies its {{foundation}} onto the perfect orthogonality {{of the two}} polarization states, and any of the single-polarized interfaces at the receiver would theoretically contain only the signal meant to be transmitted by the desired polarization, thus introducing no interference and allowing the two data streams to be multiplexed and <b>demultiplexed</b> transparently without any degradation due to the coexistence with the other.|$|E
50|$|As is {{the case}} with level 1 of the {{plesiochronous}} digital hierarchy (2 Mbit/s), the higher levels of multiplexing are carried out bit by bit (unlike the multiplexing of 64 kbit/s channels in a 2 Mbit/s signal, which is byte by byte), thus making it impossible to identify the lower level frames inside a higher level frame. Recovering the tributary frames requires the signal to be fully <b>demultiplexed.</b>|$|E

50|$|A {{demultiplexer}} can {{be achieved}} by cascading multiple drop sections of the OADM, where each drop element uses an FBG set to the wavelength to be <b>demultiplexed.</b> Conversely, a multiplexer {{can be achieved}} by cascading multiple add sections of the OADM. FBG demultiplexers and OADMs can also be tunable. In a tunable demultiplexer or OADM, the Bragg wavelength of the FBG can be tuned by strain applied by a piezoelectric transducer. The sensitivity of a FBG to strain is discussed below in fiber Bragg grating sensors.|$|E
50|$|When a {{train is}} {{operated}} by a DVT, the control signals are encoded and multiplexed onto the cables by the TDM equipment in the DVT.

50|$|Code-division {{multiplexing}} (CDM) is {{a technique}} in which each channel transmits its bits as a coded channel-specific sequence of pulses.

All channels, each with a different code, can be transmitted on the same fiber and asynchronously <b>demultiplexed.</b> Other widely used multiple access techniques are time-division multiple access (TDMA) and frequency-division multiple access (FDMA).Code-division multiplex techniques are used as an access technology, namely code-division multiple access (CDMA), in Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) standard for the third-generation (3G) mobile communication identified by the ITU.|$|E

50|$|A WSS {{comprises}} a switching array {{that operates}} on light {{that has been}} dispersed in wavelength without the requirement that the dispersed light be physically <b>demultiplexed</b> into separate ports. This is termed a ‘disperse and switch’ configuration. For example an 88 channel WDM system can be routed from a “common” fiber {{to any one of}} N fibers by employing 88 1 x N switches. This represents a significant simplification of a demux and switch and multiplex architecture that would require (in addition to N +1 mux/demux elements) a non-blocking switch for 88 N x N channels which would test severely the manufacturability limits of large-scale optical cross-connects for even moderate fiber counts.|$|E
50|$|Carrier systems {{typically}} transmit multiple {{channels of}} communication simultaneously over the shared medium using various forms of multiplexing. Prominent multiplexing methods of the carrier signal are time-division multiplexing (TDM) and frequency-division multiplexing (FDM). A cable television system {{is an example of}} frequency-division multiplexing. Many television programs are carried simultaneously on the same coaxial cable by sending each at a different frequency. Multiple layers of multiplexing may ultimately be performed upon a given input signal. For example, in the public switched telephone network, many telephone calls are sent over shared trunk lines by time-division multiplexing. For long distance calls several of these channels may be sent over a communications satellite link by frequency-division multiplexing. At a given receiving node, specific channels may be <b>demultiplexed</b> individually.|$|E
50|$|Impulse {{response}} coefficients {{taken at}} intervals of M form a subsequence, {{and there are}} M such subsequences (phases) multiplexed together. The dot product {{is the sum of}} the dot products of each subsequence with the corresponding samples of the x• sequence. Furthermore, because of downsampling by M, the stream of x• samples involved in any one of the M dot products is never involved in the other dot products. Thus M low-order FIR filters are each filtering one of M multiplexed phases of the input stream, and the M outputs are being summed. This viewpoint offers a different implementation that might be advantageous in a multi-processor architecture. In other words, the input stream is <b>demultiplexed</b> and sent through a bank of M filters whose outputs are summed. When implemented that way, it is called a polyphase filter.|$|E
