5|$|Bivalves {{have long}} {{been a part of}} the diet of coastal and {{riparian}} human populations. Oysters were cultured in ponds by the Romans, and mariculture has more recently become an important source of bivalves for food. Modern knowledge of molluscan reproductive cycles <b>has</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> the development of hatcheries and new culture techniques. A better understanding of the potential hazards of eating raw or undercooked shellfish <b>has</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> improved storage and processing. Pearl oysters (the common name of two very different families in salt water and fresh water) are the most common source of natural pearls. The shells of bivalves are used in craftwork, and the manufacture of jewellery and buttons. Bivalves have also been used in the biocontrol of pollution.|$|E
5|$|During some Christmases of {{the first}} decade of the 21st century, the Baby Jesus statue was often stolen from the outdoor nativity scene in Jönköping in Sweden, once thrown into the nearby lake of Vättern. This <b>has</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> the nativity scene, {{resembling}} a wooden stable, being closed by nights.|$|E
50|$|Selective {{breeding}} for dog breeds caused constricting breed-specific bottlenecks. These bottlenecks <b>have</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> dogs <b>having</b> {{an average}} of 2-3% more genetic loading than gray wolves.

5|$|In 1800 {{there were}} three red deer on the island, later {{replaced}} by goats and then by a small herd of black cattle.

5|$|Insects {{were among}} the {{earliest}} terrestrial herbivores and acted as major selection agents on plants. Plants evolved chemical defenses against this herbivory and the insects, in turn, evolved mechanisms to deal with plant toxins. Many insects make use of these toxins {{to protect themselves from}} their predators. Such insects often advertise their toxicity using warning colors. This successful evolutionary pattern has also been used by mimics. Over time, this <b>has</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> complex groups of coevolved species. Conversely, some interactions between plants and insects, like pollination, are beneficial to both organisms. Coevolution <b>has</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> the development of very specific mutualisms in such systems.|$|E
5|$|Lead metal {{has several}} useful {{mechanical}} properties, including high density, low melting point, ductility, and relative inertness.

5|$|The {{continuing}} {{search for}} Burgess Shale fossils {{since the mid-1970s}} <b>has</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> the description in the 1980s of an arthropod Sanctacaris and in 2007 of Orthrozanclus, which looked like a slug with a small shell at the front, chain mail over the back and long, curved spines round the edges. Recent digs have discovered species yet to be formally described and named. They have also unearthed more and sometimes better fossils of animals that were discovered earlier, for example Odontogriphus was for many years known from just one poorly preserved specimen, but {{the discovery of a}} further 189 formed the basis for a detailed description and analysis in 2006. Re-examination of Walcott's collection also continues, and <b>has</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> the reconstruction of the large marine animal Hurdia in 2009.|$|E
