40|$|A {{description}} is given {{of the design}} of a prototype "packaged" nuclear power plant. The purpose of the plant is to alleviate fuel oil logistics and storage problems posed by remote auxiliary DEW Line radar statibns north of the Arctic Circle. The ALPR (redesignated SL- 1) is a 3 Mwt, heterogeneous, highly enriched uranium- fueled, naturalcirculation boiling water reactor, ccoled and moderated with light water. Steam at 300 psig, dry and saturated (421 deg F) is passed directly from the reactor to a conventional turbine-generator to produce electric power (300 kw nominal) and space-heating (400 kw) requirements consistent with rigid mechanical and structural specifications prescribed by the military, and dictated by the extreme geophysics prevailing at the ultimate site. The over all design criteria emphasize: simplicity and reliability of operation and maintenance, with minimum supervision; minimum on-site construction; maximum use of standard components; limited water supply; utilization of local gravel for biological shielding; transportability by air lift; and nominal 3 -year fuel operating lifetime per core loading. The "packaged" concept is incorporated for the <b>initial</b> <b>erection.</b> The plant is not designed for relocation. The design criteria for the prototype necessitate special features. The fuel plates are clad with an alurninurn-nickel alloy (X 8001). Burnable-poison (BIO) strips are mechancally attached to the fuel assemblies to compensate the excess reactivity required for a nominal 3 -year core operating lifetime. The control rods are actuated by rackand-pinion drive extensions which incorporate rotary seals. Fuel exchange is accomplished without the removal of the pressure vessel head. The electrical power generated is used to operate plant auxiliaries; the "net electric power" is dissipated by resistors. The hot water for space heating is heated in a heat exchanger by 20 -psig steam, use being made of the latent heat of vaporization, and all the heat is dissipated by a finned-tube, air-cooled heat exchanger.
