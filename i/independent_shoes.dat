5000|$|The Woodlark Building is a {{historic}} commercial building in downtown Portland, Oregon, United States that is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The nine-story building was designed by Doyle, Patterson & Beach, and constructed in 1911-12. It {{has been described as}} [...] "one of Portland's earliest commercial skyscrapers". From its completion until 1924, it was the headquarters of two jointly owned and very similarly named pharmaceutical companies based in Portland, the retail Woodard, Clarke & Company, and the wholesale Clarke-Woodward Company. It was converted into an office building in 1924. The retail space on the ground floor, mezzanine and basement has held a variety of businesses, in succession over the building's history, among the longest-lasting ones being a drugstore (1912-1927), a Sherman Clay piano and music store (1930-1974), and an <b>independent</b> <b>shoe</b> store (2000-2016).|$|R

50|$|To this day, Eva Sonnino's designs remain {{emblematic of}} Bernardo Sandals. They remain Bernardo's most {{successful}} designs. Starting {{in the mid}} 1960s, all Vogue and Harpers Bazaar ads for Bernardo Sandals credited Eva Sonnino as being the designer. While her designs were essential for Bernardo's success, so were the management talents of her husband, Dino Sonnino, who {{in the early years}} was Bernardo's top salesman, being the only one, traveling around the country, knocking on doors of department store buyers and <b>independent</b> <b>shoe</b> stores, often not getting a moment's attention but not letting himself be discouraged. Beyond his management talent, his perseverance, courage, and determination were essential to raise the company from being unknown to a fashion icon. Eva and Dino Sonnino were quite a husband and wife team, creating a successful high fashion company practically from scratch in less than fifteen years. Had Bernardo Sandals been sold to a company understanding how to operate in the high fashion sector back in the late 1960s when it was by far the leading brand in women's sandals, it would most probably be a leader today in women's high fashion shoes and accessories.|$|R

50|$|In the past, the Sugar House {{community}} council had mostly shunned big-box stores, and {{a cluster of}} curbside businesses existed along the intersection of 2100 South and Highland Drive/1100 East, including <b>independent</b> clothing and <b>shoe</b> stores, music shops, artist studios, public art galleries, two coffee shops, a head shop called Wizards & Dreams, and an adult interest store called Blue Boutique. However, recent redevelopment of the Granite Block have forced many of these stores to either relocate or close. Zoning changes have created concerns that the new development will be less friendly to local businesses.|$|R
40|$|The large {{majority}} of prosthetic feet are aimed at low-heeled shoes, with a few models allowing a heel height of up to 5 cm. However, {{a survey by the}} American Podiatric Medical Association indicates that most women wear heels over 5 cm; thus, current prosthetic feet limit most female prosthesis users in their choice. Some prosthetic foot components are heel-height adjustable; however, their plantar surface shapes do not change to match the insole shapes of the shoes with different heel heights. The aims of the study were therefore (1) to develop a model that allows prediction of insole shape for various heel height shoes in combination with different shoe sizes and (2) to develop and field-test low-cost prototypes of prosthetic feet whose insole shapes were based on the new model. An equation was developed to calculate insole shapes <b>independent</b> of <b>shoe</b> size. Field testing of prototype prosthetic feet fabricated based on the equation was successful and demonstrated the utility of the equatio...|$|R
40|$|Background: This study aims to {{investigate}} the effect of taekwondo footwear on unilateral stance stability and use of postural control strategies and to determine whether taekwondo footwear influences the somatosensory inputs for postural stability and postural strategies in young adults. Methods: A quasi-randomized crossover trial was conducted on 33 healthy young adults at a university research laboratory. <b>Independent</b> variables, including <b>shoe</b> conditions (shoes on and shoes off) and visual conditions (eyes open and eyes closed), were taken into account. The center of gravity (COG) sway velocity in unilateral stance and the strategy scores in the sensory organization test were measured. No intervention {{was given to the}} participants. Results: There was no significant interaction between the two factors (the shoe and visual conditions) for COG sway velocities (P =. 447) and strategy scores (P =. 320). The shoe condition was not significant in either COG sway velocity (P =. 484) or strategy score (P =. 126). The visual condition was significant for COG sway velocity (P <. 001) but not for strategy score (P =. 573). The mean ± SD COG sway velocity with eyes open was 0. 7 ° ± 0. 2 °/sec and with eyes closed was 1. 7 ° ± 0. 6 °/sec (P <. 001). Conclusions: Taekwondo footwear is unlikely to affect somatosensory inputs and balance performance in young adults. Department of Rehabilitation Science...|$|R
40|$|Background: Prevention of {{slipping}} accidents requires {{provision of}} adequate friction {{through the use}} of suitable combinations of footwear and underfoot surfaces. Shoe sole tread groove is one of the important factors on friction coefficient during walking. Objective: To measure the effect of different shoe sole tread groove depths and different surfaces on the required quotient of friction (Q), heel strike velocity and occurrence time of ground reaction forces (GRF) in stance phase during walking on slippery and dry surfaces. Methods: In this semi-experimental study, 22 healthy men were studied under different conditions. The studied <b>independent</b> variables were <b>shoe</b> groove depths (included 1, 2. 5 and 5 mm) and type of walking surface (dry and slippery). Biomechanical gait analysis was carried out with 396 single steps. Data were collected by motion analysis system and two force platform. Results: The occurrence time of GRF was significantly faster on dry surface than slippery surface (p< 0. 01). Q was significantly lower on slippery surface and with groove depths of 1 and 2. 5 mm. The highest value of Q was observed with the deepest groove depth of 5 mm. Heel strike velocity did not differ significantly in the 6 conditions tested. Conclusion: Tread groove depth is a significant factor affecting the Q at the shoes-surface interface on dry and slippery floors. It seems that deeper groove is more appropriate for maintaining the stability during walking. The walking surface affects the occurrence time of GRF; the force components occur sooner on the dry than slippery surface. </p...|$|R
40|$|Despite the {{differences}} in materials, racing flats have begun to be used not only for racing, but also for daily training. As there are data suggesting a gender difference in overuse injuries in runners, shoe choice may affect loading patterns during running. The purpose was to determine differences in plantar pressure between genders when running in training shoes and racing flats. In-shoe plantar pressure {{data were collected from}} 34 subjects (17 m, 17 f) who ran over-ground in both a racing flat and training shoe. Contact area (CA), maximum force (MF), and contact time under the entire foot and beneath eight foot regions were collected. Each variable was analyzed using a shoe by gender repeated measures ANOVA (alpha= 0. 05). In men, MF was increased in the racing flats (p= 0. 016) beneath the medial midfoot (MMF), yet was increased beneath the medial forefoot (MFF) in the training shoe (p= 0. 018). Independent of gender, CA was decreased in the racing flats beneath the entire foot (p= 0. 029), the MMF (p= 0. 013), and the MFF (p= 0. 030), and increased beneath the lateral forefoot (LFF) (p= 0. 023). In the racing flats, MF was increased beneath the entire foot (p < 0. 001) and the LFF (p < 0. 001). <b>Independent</b> of the <b>shoe,</b> CA was decreased in men beneath the MFF (p= 0. 007) and middle forefoot (p < 0. 001), while MF was increased in the LFF (p= 0. 002). The LFF is an area of increased stress fracture risk in men. Based on the gender differences in loading, running shoe design should be gender specific in an attempt to prevent injurie...|$|R
