5000|$|In 1993, Merck started {{performing}} SAR {{studies of}} NK1 receptor antagonists, based on both CP-96345 and CP-99994. L-733,060 {{is one of}} the compounds that were developed from CP-99994. It has a 3,5-bistrifluoromethyl benzylether piperidine in place of 2-methoxy benzylamine moiety of CP-99994 compound. To improve oral bioavailability, the piperidine nitrogen was functionalized in order to reduce its basic nature. The group that gave the best effects on basicity was 3-oxo-1,2,4-triazol-5-yl moiety and it gave compounds such as L-741671 and L-742694.A morpholine nucleus that was introduced in L-742694 was found to enhance NK1 binding affinity. This nucleus was preserved in further modifications. In order to prevent possible metabolic deactivation, several refinements such as methylation on the C alfa of the [...] benzyl ring and fluorination on the phenyl ring were introduced. These changes produced the compound MK-869, which showed high affinity for the NK1 receptor and high oral activity (figure 3). MK-869 is also called aprepitant, and was studied in pain, migraines, emesis and psychiatric disorders. These studies led to the FDA-approved drug Emend for chemo therapy-induced nausea and vomiting, and is available for oral use. A water-soluble phosphoryl prodrug for intravenous use, called <b>fosaprepitant,</b> is also available and is marketed as Ivemend. Aprepitant was also believed to be effective in the treatment of depression. It entered phase III trials before the development for this indication was discontinued.|$|E
40|$|Background. This paper {{reviews the}} {{existing}} literature on <b>fosaprepitant,</b> an intravenous neurokinin- 1 anatgonist {{for the prevention of}} chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting. Objectives: To describe the development of <b>fosaprepitant</b> and to situate the intravenous form of aprepitant in the current market of available antiemetics. Methods: Literature was screened and selected in order to compare the intravenous form of the already commonly used NK- 1 receptor antagonist aprepitant. Results: Aprepitant is the first and still the only marketed neurokinin- 1 (NK- 1) antagonist. Interestingly, the first studies were performed with <b>fosaprepitant</b> dimeglumine (MK- 0517 or L- 785, 298), the water-soluble prodrug of aprepitant. <b>Fosaprepitant</b> is converted into aprepitant within 30 min after intravenous administration.

Aims: To update the evidence underlying the use of <b>fosaprepitant</b> to prevent CINV. Evidence review: Aprepitant in combination with a serotonin antagonist and a corticosteroid controls acute and delayed symptoms of CINV in patients receiving moderately to highly emetogenic chemotherapy. Bioequivalence of <b>fosaprepitant</b> with aprepitant has recently been demonstrated, which has led to its inclusion in clinical guidelines for treatment of acute CINV with highly, and some regimens of moderately, emetogenic chemotherapy. Early studies of the clinical efficacy of <b>fosaprepitant</b> have shown improvement over treatment with ondansetron. Both aprepitant and <b>fosaprepitant</b> are well tolerated with most adverse events observed of mild or moderate intensity. Conflicting economic evidence has shown that whilst aprepitant provides an increased quality of life in patients treated for CINV, there are differing views over its absolute cost in relation to standard therapy. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of aprepitant, however, appears to lie within acceptable bounds. Place in therapy: <b>Fosaprepitant</b> and aprepitant are recommended in guidelines for preventing CINV due to moderately and highly emetogenic chemotherapy. <b>Fosaprepitant</b> is bioequivalent to aprepitant, and could offer potential benefits for patients who may be unable to tolerate oral administration of antiemetics during an episode of nausea or vomiting.

40|$|Luigi Celio, Francesca Ricchini, Filippo De BraudMedical Oncology Unit 1, Department of Medical Oncology, Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale Tumori, Milan, ItalyAbstract: Control of chemotherapy-induced {{nausea and}} {{vomiting}} (CINV) {{is a crucial}} factor in ensuring that patients undergoing cancer chemotherapy can get the full benefit of therapy. Current antiemetic guidelines recommend that the neurokinin- 1 receptor (NK- 1 R) antagonist aprepitant should be used {{as part of a}} combination regimen with dexamethasone and a serotonin receptor antagonist for the prevention of CINV in patients receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy (HEC). <b>Fosaprepitant</b> is a water-soluble N-phosphoryl derivative of aprepitant that, when infused, is rapidly metabolized back to an active aprepitant. The existing literature in PubMed about <b>fosaprepitant</b> was screened and selected in order to address the emerging data from two randomized clinical trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of a single-dose <b>fosaprepitant</b> regimen. These phase III trials demonstrated that <b>fosaprepitant</b> given as a single intravenous dose of 150 mg was either noninferior to the conventional 3 -day aprepitant or significantly superior to placebo for the prevention of acute and delayed CINV in patients receiving high-dose cisplatin. In both trials, <b>fosaprepitant</b> was well tolerated although more frequent infusion-site adverse events were observed with <b>fosaprepitant.</b> The new dosage regimen of <b>fosaprepitant,</b> therefore, would be an option for CINV control in patients receiving cisplatin-based chemotherapy. The clinical efficacy is consistent with the findings from a time-on-target, positron-emission tomography study evaluating the NK- 1 R occupancy in the central nervous system (CNS) over 5 days after a single-dose infusion of 150 mg <b>fosaprepitant</b> in healthy participants. The single-dose regimen is capable of blocking more than 90 % of the NK- 1 Rs in the CNS for at least 48 hours after infusion, which is sufficient to control delayed CINV for 2 to 5 days after HEC. The new dosage regimen of <b>fosaprepitant</b> can provide a simplified treatment option that maintains high protection while ensuring adherence to scheduled antiemetic medication throughout most of the 5 -day period encompassing the major risk for CINV.

40|$|<b>Fosaprepitant</b> is a prodrug of aprepitant, a neurokinin 1 (NK 1) {{receptor}} antagonist used in prophylactic antiemetic regimens used {{prior to}} cytotoxic chemotherapy. <b>Fosaprepitant</b> {{is being developed}} to provide a parenterally administered alternative to the orally administered aprepitant. <b>Fosaprepitant</b> is rapidly converted to aprepitant and an intravenous dose of 115 mg is bioequivalent to 125 mg orally, with similar plasma concentrations at 24 hours. In phase I and II trials <b>fosaprepitant</b> shows efficacy, but the large randomized efficacy studies have utilized aprepitant. When it is added to dexamethasone and a 5 HT 3 receptor antagonist on day 1 prior to chemotherapy aprepitant improves the control of acute post chemotherapy emesis and when continued on days 2 and 3 with dexamethasone it demonstrated even greater improvement in the control of delayed emesis. This has been shown with both cisplatin-containing regimens and those based upon cyclophosphamide and an anthracycline. <b>Fosaprepitant</b> is well tolerated with mild to moderate venous irritation being the only additional toxicity to those seen with oral aprepitant, {{and that is a}} function of dose, concentration, and infusion rate.

40|$|Purpose A phase III study adding {{aprepitant}} to a 5 HT 3 receptor antagonist (5 HT 3 -RA) plus dexamethasone in {{germ cell}} tumor (GCT) patients treated with 5 -day cisplatin combination chemotherapy demonstrated {{a significant improvement}} in complete response (CR) (J Clin Onc 30 : 3998 - 4003, 2012). <b>Fosaprepitant</b> has demonstrated non-inferiority compared to aprepitant in single-day cisplatin chemotherapy and is approved as a single-dose alternative. This single-arm phase II study is the first clinical trial evaluating <b>fosaprepitant</b> in patients receiving multi-day cisplatin regimen. Methods GCT patients receiving a 5 -day cisplatin combination chemotherapy were enrolled. <b>Fosaprepitant</b> 150 mg was given IV on days 3 and 5. A 5 HT 3 -RA days 1 – 5 (days 1, 3, and 5, if palonosetron) plus dexamethasone 20 mg days 1 and 2 and 4 mg po bid days 6, 7, and 8 was administered. Rescue antiemetics were allowed.

Patients and methods: This MAGIC post hoc analysis evaluated CINV prevention efficacy and safety of APF 530 versus ondansetron, each with <b>fosaprepitant</b> and dexamethasone, in patient subgroup receiving an anthracycline plus cyclophosphamide (AC) regimen. Patients were randomized 1 : 1 to APF 530 500  mg subcutaneously (granisetron 10  mg) or ondansetron 0. 15  mg/kg intravenously (IV) (≤ 16  mg); stratification was by planned cisplatin ≥ 50  mg/m 2 (yes/no). Patients were to receive <b>fosaprepitant</b> 150  mg IV and dexamethasone 12  mg IV on day  1, then dexamethasone 8  mg orally once daily on day 2 and twice daily on days 3 and 4. Patients were mostly younger females (APF 530 arm, mean age 54. 1  years, female, 99. 3 %; ondansetron arm, 53. 8  years, female 98. 3 %). The primary end point was delayed-phase (> 24 – 120 hours) complete response (CR). Results: APF 530 versus ondansetron regimens achieved numerically better CINV control in delayed and overall (0 – 120 hours) phases for CR, complete control, total response, rescue medication use, and proportion with no nausea. APF 530 trends {{are consistent with the}} overall population, although not statistically superior given the underpowered AC subgroup analysis.

40|$|The neurokinin 1 {{receptor}} (NK- 1 R) is {{the main}} receptor for the tachykinin family of peptides. Substance P (SP) is the major mammalian ligand and {{the one with the}} highest affinity. SP is associated with multiple processes: hematopoiesis, wound healing, microvasculature permeability, neurogenic inflammation, leukocyte trafficking, and cell survival. It is also considered a mitogen, and it has been associated with tumorigenesis and metastasis. Tachykinins and their receptors are widely expressed in various human systems such as the nervous, cardiovascular, genitourinary, and immune system. Particularly, NK- 1 R is found in the nervous system and in peripheral tissues and are involved in cellular responses such as pain transmission, endocrine and paracrine secretion, vasodilation, and modulation of cell proliferation. It also acts as a neuromodulator contributing to brain homeostasis and to sensory neuronal transmission associated with depression, stress, anxiety, and emesis. NK- 1 R and SP are present in brain regions involved in the vomiting reflex (the nucleus tractus solitarius and the area postrema). This anatomical localization has led to the successful clinical development of antagonists against NK- 1 R in the treatment of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV). The first of these antagonists, aprepitant (oral administration) and <b>fosaprepitant</b> (intravenous administration), are prescribed for high and moderate emesis...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND We {{examined}} {{the efficacy of}} olanzapine {{for the prevention of}} nausea and vomiting in patients receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy. METHODS In a randomized, double-blind, phase 3 trial, we compared olanzapine with placebo, in combination with dexamethasone, aprepitant or <b>fosaprepitant,</b> and a 5 -hydroxytryptamine type 3 –receptor antagonist, in patients with no previous chemotherapy who were receiving cisplatin (≥ 70 mg per square meter of body-surface area) or cyclophosphamide–doxorubicin. The doses of the three concomitant drugs administered before and after chemotherapy were similar in the two groups. The two groups received either 10 mg of olanzapine orally or matching placebo daily on days 1 through 4. Nausea prevention was the primary end point; a complete response (no emesis and no use of rescue medication) was a secondary end point. RESULTS In the analysis, we included 380 patients who could be evaluated (192 assigned to olanzapine, and 188 to placebo). The proportion of patients with no chemotherapy-induced nausea was significantly greater with olanzapine than with placebo in the first 24 hours after chemotherapy (74 % vs. 45 %, P = 0. 002), the period from 25 to 120 hours after chemotherapy (42 % vs. 25 %, P = 0. 002), and the overall 120 -hour period (37 % vs. 22 %, P = 0. 002). The complete-response rate was also significantly increased with olanzapine during the three periods: 86 % versus 65 % (P< 0. 001), 67 % versus 52 % (P = 0. 007), and 64 % versus 41 % (P< 0. 001), respectively. Although there were no grade 5 toxic effects, some patients receiving olanzapine had increased sedation (severe in 5 %) on day 2. CONCLUSIONS Olanzapine, as compared with placebo, significantly improved nausea prevention, as well as the complete-response rate, among previously untreated patients who were receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy.
