40|$|The {{relationship}} between welfare states and women’s representation <b>in</b> <b>parliaments</b> {{has been of}} great interest to scholars. However, different strands of the literature on gender and political representation suggest opposing directions of causality. On the one hand it is argued that a rise in welfare spending increases women’s representation <b>in</b> <b>parliaments,</b> but on the other hand, more women <b>in</b> <b>parliaments</b> is said to expand welfare spending. This paper analyses the problem empirically and finds that the lagged values of women’s parliamentary representation are better predictors of welfare spending than the lagged values of spending are of women’s percent <b>in</b> <b>parliaments.</b> <b>In</b> other words, women make the welfare state and welfare spending does not make female representatives...|$|R

5|$|As Article 39A of the Constitution states, the GRC scheme entrenches the {{presence}} of minority MPs <b>in</b> <b>Parliament,</b> ensuring that interests of minority communities are represented <b>in</b> <b>Parliament.</b> Article 39A(1)(a) of the Constitution allows for a maximum number of six MPs for each GRC so as to provide flexibility in ensuring that a GRC with a rapidly expanding population is properly managed. As the population of a constituency grows, it becomes increasingly difficult for an MP to singlehandedly represent all his or her constituents' views. A team of MPs arguably has greater access to more constituents, {{and the fact that}} there are different MPs in the team suggests they can more effectively provide representation <b>in</b> <b>Parliament</b> of a wide range of constituents' views.|$|E

5|$|Since its inception, {{the scheme}} {{has been widely}} criticised. It has been {{considered}} undemocratic as it allows candidates {{who do not have}} the mandate of the people to air their views <b>in</b> <b>Parliament.</b> Furthermore, members of the opposition have criticized the scheme for creating an unequal playing field in a general election by enabling the ruling People's Action Party (PAP) to argue that the electorate need not vote for opposition candidates as there will already be some opposition representation <b>in</b> <b>Parliament.</b> Despite this critique, several opposition politicians have accepted NCMP seats, including Lee Siew-Choh, J. B. Jeyaretnam, Steve Chia and Sylvia Lim. NCMPs have raised notable points <b>in</b> <b>Parliament</b> with regards to various public policy issues such as criminal procedure, education, health and social welfare.|$|E
5|$|The NCMP {{scheme was}} {{introduced}} in 1984, and was a significant modification of the traditional Westminster system of government. Since the ruling People's Action Party had won all parliamentary seats in the four general elections since independence, Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew argued that the NCMP scheme would ensure that opposition voices would be heard <b>in</b> <b>Parliament.</b> According to him, this would be beneficial to Singapore as it would give the younger generation of Singaporeans {{a chance to see}} what an opposition can or cannot do. When the first constitutional amendment was made to initiate the NCMP scheme, between three and six NCMPs were allowed <b>in</b> <b>Parliament.</b> The Constitution was amended again in 2010 to allow for a maximum of nine NCMPs <b>in</b> <b>Parliament.</b>|$|E
