5|$|When Silva {{was arrested}} in October 2012, he confessed {{to the murder of}} Martínez Pérez. Investigators and {{authorities}} in Veracruz concluded that the journalist was killed during a robbery. But when placed before a judge, Silva retracted his confession and stated that he had been tortured, held hostage for over a week, and threatened by Veracruz authorities in order to make him confess to the assassination. Silva said that officials had threatened to kill his mother, his last remaining family member. During a press conference, the Veracruz authorities relied solely on the confession of Silva as evidence against him. None of them made references to <b>DNA,</b> <b>fingerprint,</b> or blood samples from the murder scene. Sources close to the Committee to Protect Journalists stated that the samples collected at the crime scene do not match those of any of the criminals listed on the national database. This should rule out both Silva and Domínguez (who is still at large) from the murder, because both of them have extensive criminal records. Proceso news magazine immediately took a critical stance toward the investigation and said that they did not believe that the Veracruz authorities were capable of completing a clean investigation. The Committee to Protect Journalists believes that the murder case was possibly fabricated, and that Silva was likely used as a scapegoat by the authorities. Just a few items were stolen from Martínez Pérez's house while valuable goods were left behind, so they allege that theft was not the real motive behind her murder. According to Mexican law, Proceso was allowed to participate in the investigation, so they appointed a top journalist to cover every detail of it. Proceso has complained that the Veracruz authorities have lied to them regarding possible developments in the investigation.|$|E

40|$|The {{application}} of <b>DNA</b> <b>fingerprinting</b> {{has become very}} broad in forensic analysis, patient identification, diagnostic medicine, and wildlife poaching, since every individual`s DNA structure is identical within all tissues of their body. <b>DNA</b> <b>fingerprinting</b> was initiated {{by the use of}} restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP). In 1987, Nakamura et al. found that a variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) often occurred in the alleles. The probability of different individuals having the same number of tandem repeats in several different alleles is very low. Thus, the identification of VNTR from genomic DNA became a very reliable method for identification of individuals. <b>DNA</b> <b>fingerprinting</b> is a reliable tool for forensic analysis. In <b>DNA</b> <b>fingerprinting,</b> knowledge of the sequence of tandem repeats and restriction endonuclease sites can provide the basis for identification. The major steps for conventional <b>DNA</b> <b>fingerprinting</b> include (1) specimen processing (2) amplification of selected DNA segments by PCR, and (3) gel electrophoresis to do the final DNA analysis. In this work we propose to use laser desorption mass spectrometry for fast <b>DNA</b> <b>fingerprinting.</b> The process and advantages are discussed...|$|R

Hybridization of this plasmid to AccI-digested genomic DNAs of 26 C. neoformans strains generated 21 unique <b>DNA</b> <b>fingerprints.</b> The <b>DNA</b> <b>fingerprints</b> of isolates within the same serotype were more similar to one another than to those from different serotypes.

50|$|To {{combat the}} {{vulnerability}} of this species, a number of conservation projects have been put into action over recent years. One example was {{the construction of a}} two-metre-high, predator-proof fence around 25 km2 of the park in 2000. A second population of wombats has been established at Richard Underwood Nature Refuge at Yarran Downs near St. George in southern Queensland. This second population was established in 2008 and is also in a reserve surrounded by a predator-proof fence. Within Epping Forest National Park, increased attention and funds have been given for wombat research and population monitoring, fire management, maintenance of the predator-proof fence, general management, and control of predators and competitors, and elimination of invasive plant species. In addition, the species recovery plan of 2004 to 2008 included communication and community involvement in saving the species and worked to increase the current population in the wild, established other populations within the wombat's historical range, and worked with zoos to establish a captive husbandry program. Also, a volunteer caretaker program allows volunteers to contribute in monitoring the population and keeping the predator fence in good repair. Finally, <b>DNA</b> <b>fingerprint</b> identification of wombat hairs allows research to be conducted without an invasive trapping or radio-tracking program. Due to the combined efforts of these forces, the northern hairy-nosed wombat population is slowly making a comeback.|$|E
