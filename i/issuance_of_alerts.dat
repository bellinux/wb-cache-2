40|$|New {{astronomy}} projects generate observation images continuously {{and these}} images are converted into tabular catalogs online. Furthermore, each such new table, called a sample table, is compared against a reference table on the same patch of sky to annotate the stars that match those in the reference and to identify transient objects that have no matches. This cross match must be done within {{a few seconds to}} enable timely <b>issuance</b> <b>of</b> <b>alerts</b> as well as shipping of the data products off the pipeline. To perform the online cross match of tables on celestial objects, we propose two parallel algorithms, zoneMatch and gridMatch, both of which divide up celestial objects by their locations in the spherical coordinate system. Specifically, zoneMatch divides the observation area by the declination coordinate of the celestial sphere whereas gridMatch utilizes a two-dimensional grid on the declination and the right ascension. With the reference table indexed by zones or grid, we match the stars in the sample table through parallel index probes on the reference. We implemented these algorithms on a multicore CPU as well as a desktop GPU, and evaluated their performance on both synthetic data and realworld astronomical data. Our results show that gridMatch is faster than zoneMatch at the cost of memory space and that parallelization achieves speedups of orders of magnitude.

40|$|We {{describe}} our task-based {{approach to}} defining the guideline-based decision-support services that the EON system provides. We categorize uses of guidelines in patient-specific decision support into {{a set of}} generic tasks [...] making of decisions, specification {{of work to be}} performed, interpretation of data, setting <b>of</b> goals, and <b>issuance</b> <b>of</b> <b>alert</b> and reminders [...] that can be solved using various techniques. Our model includes constructs required for representing the knowledge used by these techniques. These constructs form a toolkit from which developers can select modeling solutions for guideline task. Based on the tasks and the guideline model, we define a guideline-execution architecture and a model of interactions between a decision-support server and clients that invoke services provided by the server. These services use generic interfaces derived from guideline tasks and their associated modeling constructs. We describe two implementations of these decision-support services and discuss how this work can be generalized. We argue that a well-defined specification of guideline-based decision-support services will facilitate sharing of tools that implement computable clinical guidelines...|$|R
40|$|Rapid {{detection}} {{of local and}} regional earthquakes and <b>issuance</b> <b>of</b> fast <b>alerts</b> for impending shaking is considered beneficial to save lives, reduce losses, and shorten recovery times after destructive events (Allen et al., 2009). Over the last two decades, several countries have built operational earthquake early warning (EEW) systems, including Japan (Hoshiba et al., 2008), Mexico (Espinosa-Aranda et al., 1995), Romania (Mărmureanu et al., 2011), Turkey (Erdik et al., 2003), Taiwan (Hsiao et al., 2011), and China (Peng et al., 2011). Other countries, such as the United States (Böse, Allen, et al., 2013), Italy (Satriano et al., 2011), and Switzerland (Behr et al., 2015), are currently developing systems or evaluating algorithms in their seismic real-time networks...|$|R
40|$|Alert {{programs}} {{are central to}} strategies to reduce pollution exposure and manage its impact. To be effective alerts have to change behavior, but evidence that they do that is sparse. Indeed the majority of published studies fail to find a significant impact <b>of</b> <b>alerts</b> on the outcome behavior that they study. Alerts particularly seek to influence energetic cardio-vascular outdoor pursuits. This study {{is the first to}} use administrative data to show that they are effective in reducing participation in such a pursuit (namely cycle use in Sydney, Australia), and to our knowledge the first to show that they are effective in changing any behavior in a non-US setting. We are careful to disentangle possible reactions to realised air quality from the ‘pure’, causal effect <b>of</b> the <b>issuance</b> <b>of</b> an <b>alert.</b> Our results suggest that when an air quality alert is issued, the amount of cycling is reduced by 14 – 35 %, which is a substantial behavioral response. The results are robust to the inclusion of a battery of controls in various combinations, alternative estimation methods and non-linear specifications. We develop various sub-sample results, and also find evidence <b>of</b> <b>alert</b> fatigue...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the major}} {{challenges}} facing the integration of Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) in the National Airspace System (NAS) {{is the lack of}} an onboard pilot that can comply with the legal requirement identified in the US Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) that pilots see and avoid other aircraft. UAS will be expected to demonstrate the means to perform the function of see and avoid while preserving the safety level of the airspace and the efficiency of the air traffic system. This paper introduces a Sense and Avoid (SAA) concept for integration of UAS into the NAS that is currently being developed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and identifies areas that require additional experimental evaluation to further inform various elements of the concept. The concept design rests on interoperability principles that take into account both the Air Traffic Control (ATC) environment as well as existing systems such as the Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS). Specifically, the concept addresses the determination of well clear values that are large enough to avoid <b>issuance</b> <b>of</b> TCAS corrective Resolution Advisories, undue concern by pilots of proximate aircraft and <b>issuance</b> <b>of</b> controller traffic <b>alerts.</b> The concept also addresses appropriate declaration times for projected losses of well clear conditions and maneuvers to regain well clear separation...|$|R
30|$|Focusing on {{the timing}} variables, the <b>issuance</b> <b>of</b> debt (Column 1) is preceded by <b>issuances</b> <b>of</b> debt (Issuer Debt in t- 4 to t- 12 {{statistically}} significant) and hybrid instruments (both Issuer Hybrid Instruments in t- 4 to t- 12 and Issuer Hybrid Instruments in t- 4 to t- 12 statistically significant), but not <b>issuances</b> <b>of</b> capital. Similarly, <b>issuances</b> <b>of</b> hybrid instruments are preceded by other <b>issuances</b> <b>of</b> hybrid instruments and by <b>issuances</b> <b>of</b> debt. However, {{the probability of}} issuing capital is not correlated with the <b>issuance</b> <b>of</b> debt but increases with the <b>issuances</b> <b>of</b> hybrid instruments {{during the last three}} months. Table  4 shows that the coefficients that are statistically different from zero are also statistically different across types <b>of</b> <b>issuances.</b> Therefore, banks that finance their growth with <b>issuances</b> <b>of</b> debt also increase their <b>issuances</b> <b>of</b> hybrid instruments, which indicates that they are managing their regulatory capital holdings using hybrid instruments to comply with the higher requirements due to the increase in debt holdings. Further evidence for this finding is provided by the variable Low Capital, which is positive and statistically significant at 10 % in hybrid instruments whereas it is not statistically significant for capital, which indicates that banks whose regulatory capital is close to the minimum are likely to issue hybrid instruments but not capital instruments. Given that the threshold of 8 % is exogenous, the <b>issuance</b> <b>of</b> capital instruments might be a response to maintain or increase their Basel ratios by using only hybrid capital, which means they want to minimize the cost of regulatory compliance.|$|R
