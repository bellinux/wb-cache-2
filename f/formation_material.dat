5000|$|To {{inquire into}} {{the origin and}} fate of a galaxy's halo gas is to inquire into the {{evolution}} of said galaxy. HVCs and IVCs are significant features of a spiral galaxy's structure.

The Milky Way has approximately 5 billion solar masses of star forming material within its disk and a SFR of 1-3 [...] yr−1.

40|$|This report {{describes}} the laboratory {{testing of the}} reactions of acetic, formic, hydrochloric, ad hydrofluoric acids with calcium carbonate, kaolin, sepiolite, and two <b>formation</b> <b>materials</b> at geothermal temperatures. In general, a workable test procedure was developed which provided information regarding the relative reactivities of selected minerals or <b>formation</b> <b>materials</b> with {{three of the four}} acids investigated. Tests with hydrochloric acrid were complicated by reactions of the acid with the test vessel materials and therefore, only very limited work could be done with this acid at the desired temperatures. In spite of these difficulties, information regarding the amount of soluble material in the various acids was obtained. From this under the different reaction conditions could be calculated. Additional information regarding the formation of solid secondary reaction products upon cooling of the reacted acid was also obtained. The implication of the mineral reactivities with the different acids and the formation of secondary solids on geothermal acidizing operations are discussed. In addition, some selected scale inhibitors (for calcium carbonate) were tested for their hydrothermal stability. Their efficiency in inhibiting the formation of calcium carbonate scale before and after aging at 500 {degree}F was measured. The implications of the loss of efficiency of these materials and recommendations for their use in the field are discussed. [DJE- 2005...|$|R

Sustainable architecture attempts to reduce the collective environmental impacts during the production of building components, during the construction process, as well as during the lifecycle of the building (heating, electricity use, carpet cleaning etc.) This design practice emphasizes efficiency of heating and cooling systems; alternative energy sources such as solar hot water, appropriate building siting, reused or recycled building materials; on-site power generation - solar technology, ground source heat pumps, wind power; rainwater harvesting for gardening, washing and aquifer recharge; and on-site waste management such as green roofs that filter and control stormwater runoff.

5000|$|Lead {{researcher}} Ivan Ramirez {{explained the}} significance of finding solar siblings: [...] "We {{want to know where}} we were born. If we can figure out in what part of the galaxy the Sun formed, we can constrain conditions on the early solar system. That could help us understand why we are here." [...] He also said there was a [...] "small, but not zero" [...] chance that planets with life might orbit solar sibling stars, because during the frequent collisions during planetary <b>formation</b> <b>material</b> might have travelled from one system to another. He said the siblings might be [...] "key candidates" [...] in the search for extraterrestrial life. A scenario for transfer of life by this means might require life or a precursor molecule to be shielded from radiation for millions of years, dormant within an outgoing chunk of planetary debris one meter or more in diameter that is produced by a meteorite impact, until this new meteorite impacts on a different planet. Such an unlikely event might have transferred life from another planet to Earth or vice versa.|$|E

40|$|AbstractA {{reactive}} transport modeling approach {{was used to}} assess key geochemical reactions between wellbore cement, formation mineralogy, and injected supercritical CO 2 at the Krechba natural gas field at In Salah, Algeria. Characterization of these reactions is important for understanding changes in porosity and permeability and the propagation or sealing of fractures in the formation or wellbore cement. Experiments involving the reaction of CO 2 with reservoir mineral assemblages and wellbore cement under in situ conditions, combined with geochemical modeling, were used to identify candidate reactive mineral phases and reaction rates specifically applicable to CO 2 injection at In Salah. These findings informed a {{reactive transport}} model which considered advective transport of CO 2 along the wellbore-formation interface and diffusive transport of CO 2 and brine constituents into juxtaposed wellbore cement. Model results indicate shallow carbonation of the cement along the interface, leading to changes in cement porosity. Diffusive transport of cations such as Ca, Fe, and Al between the cement and formation materials results in mineralogical changes in the <b>formation</b> <b>material</b> immediately adjacent to the cement, including localized dissolution of calcite and precipitation of siderite, magnesite, gibbsite, smectite, and amorphous silica. In contrast to the cement, the modeled porosity changes in the <b>formation</b> <b>material</b> appear to be minor. Taken together, these results suggest (1) significant retardation of the rate of advance of CO 2 along the interface, and (2) relatively minor impacts to permeability...|$|E
