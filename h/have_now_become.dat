5|$|The geology of the moor and {{prolonged}} peat extraction {{has provided a}} unique environment which provides a habitat {{for a range of}} flora and fauna. Much of the nature reserve managed by the Somerset Wildlife Trust is based around abandoned peatworkings which <b>have</b> <b>now</b> <b>become</b> flooded. It is particularly noted for the millions of starlings which congregate at the site.|$|E
5|$|The IB is {{developing}} a pilot online version of the IBDP and currently offers several online courses to IBDP students. Eventually, it expects to offer online courses to any student who wishes to register. Additionally, the IB has developed pilot courses that include World Religions; Sports, Exercise and Health Sciences, Dance, and a transdisciplinary pilot course, Literature and Performance, Global Politics. These pilot courses <b>have</b> <b>now</b> <b>become</b> part of the mainstream courses.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, {{the problem}} of ammonia levels in the final {{effluent}} was addressed by {{the construction of a}} system using anoxic zones and diffuse air activated sludge treatment. This dramatically reduced ammonia levels, and was the most significant factor in the re-establishment of fish stocks in the lower River Don. In 1990, the outdated filter presshouse and incineration plant were replaced by a new sludge-dewatering plant and a fluidized-bed incinerator. The new plant made the old sludge beds, situated to the east of the River Don and on the island formed by the Don and the Holmes Cut, redundant, and these <b>have</b> <b>now</b> <b>become</b> a nature reserve. Further improvements to the process were completed by 2005. These included an upgrade to the wet scrubbing system, in order to remove heavy metals and acid gases such as sulphur dioxide, hydrogen chloride and hydrogen fluoride from the flue gases produced by the incinerator, and the addition of a tertiary adsorption filter, which removes mercury and dioxins. The improvements were designed to ensure that the plant met the standards set out in the Waste Incineration Directive.|$|E

5|$|Jack is {{contacted}} by Atlas via radio, and is guided to safety from the Splicers and {{the perils of}} the run down city. Atlas requests Jack's help in stopping Ryan, directing him to a docked bathysphere where he claims Ryan has trapped his family. When Jack encounters a wandering Little Sister and its fallen Big Daddy, Atlas urges Jack to kill the Little Sister to harvest her ADAM for himself; Dr. Tenenbaum overhears this and intercepts Jack before he harms the Little Sister, urging him to spare the child and any other Little Sisters he encounters, providing him with a plasmid that would force the sea slug out of her body. Jack eventually works {{his way to the}} bathysphere, but Ryan destroys it before Jack can reach it. Enraged, Atlas directs Jack towards Ryan's mansion through Ryan's army of Splicers and Big Daddies. At times, Jack is forced to travel through areas controlled by Ryan's allies that <b>have</b> <b>now</b> <b>become</b> deranged, such as Sander Cohen, a former musician that now takes enjoyment in watching the death and misery of others.|$|E

25|$|The {{traditional}} nomadic Qashqai travelled {{with their}} flocks {{each year from}} the summer highland pastures north of Shiraz roughly 480km or 300mi south to the winter pastures on lower (and warmer) lands near the Persian Gulf, to the southwest of Shiraz.

25|$|While Lewis {{has only}} one town, Stornoway, with a {{population}} of approx 8,000, there are also several large villages and groupings of villages on Lewis, such as North Tolsta, Carloway and Leurbost with significant populations. Near Stornoway, Laxdale, Sandwick and Holm, although still de facto villages, <b>have</b> <b>now</b> <b>become</b> quasi-suburbs of Stornoway. The population of the greater-Stornoway area including these (and other) villages would be nearer 12,000.|$|E
25|$|Though Africanized bees display certain {{behavioral}} {{traits that}} make them less than desirable for commercial beekeeping, excessive defensiveness and swarming foremost, they <b>have</b> <b>now</b> <b>become</b> the dominant type of honey bee for beekeeping in Central and South America due to their genetic dominance as well as ability to out-compete their European counterpart, with some beekeepers asserting that they are superior honey producers and pollinators.|$|E
25|$|Cultural {{continuity}} {{has been}} maintained for centuries in the exclusive worship of goddesses and deities in Kathmandu {{and the rest}} of the country. These deities include the Ajima, Taleju (or Tulja Bhavani), Digu taleju, and Kumari (the living goddess). The artistic edifices <b>have</b> <b>now</b> <b>become</b> places of worship in the everyday life of the people, therefore a roster is maintained to observe annual festivals.

25|$|Disc brakes {{were most}} popular on sports cars {{when they were}} first introduced, since these {{vehicles}} are more demanding about brake performance. Discs <b>have</b> <b>now</b> <b>become</b> the more common form in most passenger vehicles, although many (particularly light weight vehicles) use drum brakes on the rear wheels to keep costs and weight down as well as to simplify the provisions for a parking brake. As the front brakes perform most of the braking effort, this can be a reasonable compromise.|$|E
25|$|Before postal codes as {{described}} here were used, large cities were often divided into postal zones or postal districts, usually numbered from 1 upwards within each city. The newer postal code systems often incorporate the old zone numbers, as with London postal district numbers, for example. Ireland still uses postal district numbers in Dublin. In New Zealand, Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch were divided into postal zones, but these fell into disuse, and <b>have</b> <b>now</b> <b>become</b> redundant {{as a result of}} a new postcode system being introduced.|$|E
25|$|Vehicles with {{a single}} driving wheel. Besides motorcycles, which are {{generally}} not classified as automobiles, this group includes most three-wheeled cars. These were quite common in Europe in the mid-20th Century, but <b>have</b> <b>now</b> <b>become</b> rare there. They are still common {{in some areas of}} the developing world, such as India. Some early four-wheeled cars also had only one driving wheel to avoid the need for a differential. However, this arrangement led to many problems. The system was unbalanced, the driving wheel would easily spin, etc. Because of these problems, few such vehicles were made.|$|E

25|$|Christian country music, {{sometimes}} referred to as country gospel music, is a subgenre of gospel music with a country flair, is also known as inspirational country. Christian country over the years has progressed into a mainstream country sound with inspirational or positive country lyrics. In the mid-1990s, Christian country hit its highest popularity. So much so that mainstream artists like Larry Gatlin, Charlie Daniels and Barbara Mandrell, just to name a few, began recording music that had this positive Christian country flair. These mainstream artists <b>have</b> <b>now</b> <b>become</b> award winners in this genre.|$|E
25|$|Habituation {{is shared}} across species {{and is the}} {{simplest}} form of learning. Here a person’s response to a stimulus weakens when it becomes familiar. For example, with drink driving advertising in New Zealand, a decade ago we saw cars smashing into each other as a scare tactic. The content of these adverts has become less and less shocking the more we {{have been exposed to}} them. We <b>have</b> <b>now</b> <b>become</b> so desensitised to them that a humour approach has to be taken and the latest example is the ‘Legend’ advert.|$|E
25|$|Elsewhere, Big Daddy (who has {{gathered}} {{a large group}} of zombies) learns that they can walk safely underwater. He leads the zombies to cross the river to the human city. They take the guards by surprise and begin massacring the people. As a result of the zombies making it into the city, the electric fences that once kept the zombies out <b>have</b> <b>now</b> <b>become</b> a wall to trap them and the humans inside. Seeing the city overrun, Kaufman runs with his money, and encounters a zombie Cholo in the parking garage. As the two struggle, Big Daddy kills both with a propane tank.|$|E
