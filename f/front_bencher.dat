2500|$|However, these Green sympathies are not {{universal}} within Labor's Left and the {{two groups}} often find themselves competing in elections, making the Greens' growing popularity a threat to Labor.

5000|$|Most Rumpers still {{regarded}} many purged colleagues as “members of parliament” {{and remained}} {{hopeful that the}} excluded members would be readmitted. “The Rump {{did not think of}} itself as a corporate political entity distinct in membership, aims and character from the Long Parliament”. [...] Despite the rump’s lack of distinctiveness, there were a variety of reasons why people {{wanted to be a part}} of the Rump Parliament. Some members stayed in the Rump Parliament because they genuinely supported revolutionary changes, while others were only there for financial advantage, civilian power, or to satisfy their relish for political activity. Because of the varied energies within the Rump, the parliament divided into two categories, <b>front</b> <b>benchers</b> and back benchers, meaning, those who attended parliament regularly and those who did not.|$|R
50|$|Post-independence prose {{literature}} in Gujarati had two distinct trends, traditional and modern. The former dealt more with ethical values {{and its main}} writers were Gulabdas Broker, Mansukhlal Jhaveri, Vishnuprasad Trivedi and others. Existentialism, surrealism and symbolism influenced the latter. The modernists also wanted {{to do away with}} moral values and religious beliefs. Eminent writers of this trend comprise Niranjan Bhagat, Chandrakant Bakshi, Suresh Joshi, Madhu Rye, Raghuveer Chaudhari, Dhiruben Patel, Saroj Pathak, and others. There was also a noticeable segment of Popular writers like Vithal Pandya, Sarang Barot, Dinkar Joshi, Harkisan Mehta and Ashwinee Bhatt whose novels found a place in the hearts of common people. Their novels reached every corner of Gujarat and also to vast Gujarati readers outside Gujarat through newspapers and magazines.Gujarati prose has recorded growth and literary feats quite rapidly in less than two hundred years and now can be counted among the <b>front</b> <b>benchers</b> in Indian literature.|$|R

60|$|But {{where were}} our <b>front</b> <b>benchers</b> to nest if not here? The {{alternative}} to Heartbreak House was Horseback Hall, {{consisting of a}} prison for horses with an annex for the ladies and gentlemen who rode them, hunted them, talked about them, bought them and sold them, and gave nine-tenths of their lives to them, dividing the other tenth between charity, churchgoing (as a substitute for religion), and conservative electioneering (as a substitute for politics). It {{is true that the}} two establishments got mixed at the edges. Exiles from the library, the music room, and the picture gallery would be found languishing among the stables, miserably discontented; and hardy horsewomen who slept at the first chord of Schumann were born, horribly misplaced, into the garden of Klingsor; but sometimes one came upon horsebreakers and heartbreakers who could make the best of both worlds. As a rule, however, the two were apart and knew little of one another; so the prime minister folk had to choose between barbarism and Capua. And of the two atmospheres it is hard to say which was the more fatal to statesmanship.|$|R
2500|$|Each {{debate in}} Parliament {{begins with a}} motion, which is a formal {{proposal}} that a certain course of action {{be taken by the}} House. The MP who moves a motion has not more than one hour for his or her opening speech explaining the reasons for the motion, but Parliament may vote to extend this time by 15 minutes. The Speaker (or chairman, if Parliament is in committee) then proposes the motion {{in the form of a}} question, following which other MPs may debate the motion. MPs who wish to speak must rise in their places and catch the eye of the Speaker. They may speak only if called upon by the Speaker. MPs must speak from the [...] unless they are <b>front</b> <b>benchers,</b> in which case they may speak at the Table of the House if they wish.

In general, MPs may only speak once to any question, though they may be heard again to clarify their speeches if misunderstood or to seek a clarification of another MP's speech. If they do so, they are not allowed to introduce new matters. After MPs have spoken, the mover may exercise a right of reply for up to one hour; again, Parliament may grant an extension of up to 15 minutes.|$|R

40|$|Executive summary: Of the 1, 093 {{members who}} have served in the House of Representatives from 1901 {{to the end of}} the 43 rd Parliament in August 2013, 300 (27. 4 %) have been named and/or {{suspended}} or ‘sin binned’ for disorderly behaviour in the Chamber. This study outlines the bases of the House’s authority to deal with disorderly behaviour, and the procedures available to the Speaker to act on such behaviour. It then analyses the 1, 352 instances of disorderly behaviour identified in the official Hansard record with a view to identifying patterns over time, and the extent and degree of such behaviour. It does not attempt to identify the reasons why disorderly behaviour occurs as they are quite complex and beyond the scope of this paper. • The authority for the rules of conduct in the House of Representatives is derived from the Australian Constitution. The members themselves have broad responsibility for their behaviour in the House. However, it is the role of the Speaker or the occupier of the Chair to ensure that order is maintained during parliamentary proceedings. This responsibility is derived from the standing orders. Since its introduction in 1994, the ‘sin bin’ has become the disciplinary action of choice for Speakers. • With the number of namings and suspensions decreasing in recent years, the ‘sin bin’ (being ordered from the chamber for one hour) appears to have been successful in avoiding the disruption caused by the naming and suspension procedure. However, as the number of ‘sin bin’ sanctions has increased, it may be that this penalty has contributed to greater disorder because members may view it as little more than a slap on the wrist and of little deterrent value. • Most disorderly behavior (90 %) occurs during Question Time and in the parliamentary proceedings which often take place during or just after it. Such behaviour also tends to increase daily as the sitting week progresses. • <b>Front</b> <b>benchers</b> and parliamentary office holders account for about 57 % of instances of disorderly behaviour. Opposition members are sanctioned 90 % of the time no matter which party occupies that role. No prime minister has been sanctioned for disorderly behaviour but two deputy prime ministers and seven opposition leaders have, although not all have been ordered from the House. Christopher Pyne leads the list of members most disciplined on 45 followed by Anthony Albanese on 34. Women members have accounted for 15 % of disciplinary actions since they first entered Parliament in 1943. • Members were disciplined most frequently under the Speakership of Peter Slipper followed by Anna Burke, David Hawker and Harry Jenkins. • On four measures of disorderly behaviour (number of disciplinary actions, number of sitting weeks in which a member was disciplined, number of days when four or more members were disciplined, number of different members disciplined), the Rudd/Gillard Parliaments (42 nd and 43 rd, 2008 – 2013) were more disorderly than the Howard Parliaments (38 th to 41 st, 1996 – 2007). The most disorderly Parliament was the 43 rd...|$|R
