40|$|This study {{examined}} the effects of religion and gender on drinking behaviors among a sample of 148 older Korean immigrants living in a metropolitan area in Canada. Face-to-face interviews were conducted using standardized questions. The mean age of the participants was 74 years (range: 60 - 97 years). Logistic regression models were used to assess the effects of religion on <b>drinking</b> and <b>heavier</b> drink-ing and gender differences in correlates of current <b>drinking</b> and <b>heavier</b> <b>drinking.</b> Results revealed that being married and having lower religiosity were significant correlates that increased the odds of being a current drinker. Older Korean men tend to engage in <b>heavier</b> <b>drinking</b> behavior. Higher religiosity, not mere affiliation to Protestant churches, decreased the odds of <b>heavier</b> <b>drinking</b> for both men and women. The odds of <b>heavier</b> <b>drinking</b> increased for depressed men. Study limita-tions and implications are presented in a cultural context...|$|R
40|$|Aims: To {{identify}} a typology of <b>heavier</b> <b>drinking</b> styles in Great Britain {{and to identify}} socio-demographic trends in the typology over the period 1978 - 2010. Methods: We applied multiple correspondence analysis and agglomerative hierarchical clustering to beverage-specific quantity-frequency measures of alcohol consumption in the repeated cross-sectional General Lifestyle Survey of Great Britain, 1978 - 2010. The cluster analysis focuses on the 60, 043 adult respondents over this period reporting average drinking levels above the UK Government guidelines. We projected sex, age, income, education, socio-economic status and tobacco consumption variables onto the clusters to inspect socio-demographic trends in <b>heavier</b> <b>drinking.</b> Results: We identified four stable clusters of heavier drinking: (a) high volume beer; (b) beer and spirit combination; (c) all beverage and (d) wine and spirit only. The socio-demographic characteristics of the clusters were distinct from both {{each other and the}} general population. However, all clusters had higher median incomes and higher smoking rates than the population. Increases in the prevalence of <b>heavier</b> <b>drinking</b> were driven by a 5 -fold increase in the contribution of the female-dominated, wine and spirit only cluster. Conclusions: Recent changes in per capita alcohol consumption in Great Britain occurred {{within the context of a}} stable typology of <b>heavier</b> <b>drinking</b> styles and shifting socio-demographics. Identifying these trends is essential to better understand how drinking cultures develop over time and where potentially problematic drinking styles may emerge. Our findings suggest that careful attention to patterns and cultures of consumption is more important than relying on headline consumption data, for both understanding drinking behaviours and targeting interventions. Short Summary: This analysis of alcohol consumption survey data identifies four styles of <b>heavier</b> <b>drinking</b> in Great Britain, which remain unchanged over the period 1978 - 2010. The socio-demographic characteristics of the drinking styles are distinct from both each other and the general population, with increased participation of female and older drinkers over time...|$|R

40|$|Objective: Extensive use of {{specific}} social contexts (bars and parties, for instance) by homosexuals and bisexuals {{is thought to}} be a factor in the higher rates of drinking among these groups. However, much of the empirical evidence behind these assumptions has been based on studies with methodological or sampling shortcomings. This article examines the epidemiological patterns of alcohol contexts in relation to sexual identity, using a large, national, probability population survey. Method: We used the 2000 National Alcohol Survey for these analyses. The prevalence of spending leisure time in each of two social contexts (bars and parties) that are associated with <b>heavier</b> <b>drinking</b> is examined by sexual orientation (heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual and self-identified heterosexuals with same sex partners). In addition, we compare levels of drinking within these contexts by sexual orientation within these groups. Results: Exclusively heterosexual women spent less time in these two contexts relative to all other groups of women. Gay men spent considerably more time in bars compared with the other groups of men. Heterosexual women who reported same sex partners drink more at bars, and bisexual women drink more alcohol at both bars and parties than exclusively heterosexual women. For men, {{there were no significant differences}} for average consumption in any of these contexts. Entry of background and demographic variables into logistic regression analyses did little to modify these associations. Conclusions: There is empirical evidence that some groups of homosexual and bisexual women and men spend more time than heterosexual individuals in <b>heavier</b> <b>drinking</b> contexts. The frequency of being in these two social contexts does not appear to be associated with <b>heavier</b> <b>drinking</b> within these contexts for men, but it may be related to <b>heavier</b> <b>drinking</b> in those places among some groups of women...|$|R
40|$|Consuming harmful {{amounts of}} alcohol is {{considered}} a contributing factor in over 200 diseases. <b>Heavy</b> episodic <b>drinking</b> is a particularly risky drinking pattern, with possible consequences such as acute alcohol intoxication, injuries and violence.

40|$|Aims: A {{low level}} of {{response}} (LR), or low sensitivity, to alcohol as established by alcohol challenges {{has been shown to}} predict future <b>heavier</b> <b>drinking,</b> alcohol-related problems and alcohol use disorders. To date, only one study has evaluated the predictive validity of a second measure of LR as determined by the Self-Report of the Effects of Alcohol (SRE) Questionnaire. The current analyses evaluate the ability of SRE scores as determined at age 12 to predict <b>heavier</b> <b>drinking</b> and alcohol-related problems 2 years later in a sample from the United Kingdom. Methods: The subjects were 156 boys (54. 5 %) and girls from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) who had reported consuming one or more standard drinks by age 12 and who were followed up 2 years later. Results: The age 12 SRE scores correlated with the number of drinks per week, maximum drinks and the number of alcohol problems both at baseline and at age 14 follow-ups. In these evaluations, a larger number of drinks required for effects on the SRE (i. e. a lower LR per drink consumed) related to heavier intake and alcohol-related difficulties. Simultaneous entry multiple regression analyses revealed that the age 12 SRE score maintained a significant relationship with age 14 higher number of drinks per week and the number of alcohol problems even when the age 12 values for alcohol intake and problems were used as covariates. Conclusion: The SRE scores appear to have value in predicting future <b>heavier</b> <b>drinking</b> and alcohol problems in 12 -year olds that go beyond the information offered by the earlier drinking pattern alone...|$|R

40|$|Background: Resistance {{to alcohol}} {{hangover}} {{may be a}} risk factor for alcohol use disorder. Previous research to establish the prevalence of hangover resistance in a drinking population has either not used comparable intoxication levels or has considered hangover resistance over a limited time frame. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the prevalence of lifetime hangover negative (LHN) drinkers across comparable eBAC values ranging from 0 to 500  mg/dl. Methods: Students at an eastern Canadian university were surveyed about their <b>heaviest</b> <b>drinking</b> episode in the past month and indicated whether they had ever experienced a hangover in their lifetime (LHN) and, if they had, the hangover severity they experienced the next day. eBACs were calculated and the percentage of LHN drinkers was computed at each 10  mg/dl eBAC increment from 0 to 500  mg/dl. Results: Most LHN drinkers (58 % female, 71 % male) had an eBAC on their <b>heaviest</b> <b>drinking</b> occasion below 80  mg/dl.

During that time he received money from his superiors left in dead-letter boxes in the Bronx and Manhattan. It is known he occasionally drew attention to himself by indulging in <b>heavy</b> <b>drinking</b> sessions and heated arguments with his Finnish wife Hannah. For six months Häyhänen checked the thumbtack and no one had made contact. He also checked a dead-drop location he had memorized. There he found a hollowed-out nickel. However, prior to opening the coin Häyhänen had misplaced it, either buying a newspaper with it or using it as a subway token. For the next seven months the hollow nickel travelled around the New York City economy, unopened. The trail of the hollow nickel ended when a thirteen-year-old newsboy was collecting for his weekly deliveries. The newsboy accidentally dropped the nickel and it broke in half, revealing a microphotograph containing a series of numbers.

40|$|BACKGROUND: This study {{examined}} alcohol use patterns among {{men and women}} with depression seeking outpatient psychiatric treatment, including factors associated with recent <b>heavy</b> episodic <b>drinking</b> and motivation to reduce alcohol consumption. METHODS: The sample consisted of 1, 183 patients aged 18 and over who completed a self-administered, computerized intake questionnaire and who scored ≥ 10 on the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II). Additional measures included current and past alcohol questions based on the Addiction Severity Index, <b>heavy</b> episodic <b>drinking</b> (≥ 5 drinks on 1 or more occasions in the past year), alcohol-related problems on the Short Michigan Alcoholism Screening Test (SMAST), and motivation to reduce drinking using the Stages of Change Readiness and Treatment Eagerness Scale (SOCRATES). RESULTS: Among those who consumed any alcohol in the past year (73. 9 % of the sample), <b>heavy</b> episodic <b>drinking</b> in the past year was reported by 47. 5 % of men and 32. 5 % of women. In logistic regression, prior-year <b>heavy</b> episodic <b>drinking</b> was associated with younger age (p = 0. 011), male gender (p = 0. 001), and cigarette smoking (p = 0. 002). Among patients reporting <b>heavy</b> episodic <b>drinking,</b> motivation to reduce alcohol consumption was associated with older age (p = 0. 008), greater usual quantity of alcohol consumed (p < 0. 001), and higher SMAST score (p < 0. 001). CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to prior clinical studies, we examined subdiagnostic alcohol use and related problems among psychiatric outpatients with depression. Patients reporting greater drinking quantities and alcohol-related problems also express more motivation to reduce drinking, providing intervention opportunities for mental health providers that should not be overlooked...|$|R

Design and Methods The total sample comprised 170 men aged 18 – 25 years who completed an online questionnaire exploring beliefs and attitudes towards MARA. Results Those who reported <b>heavy</b> episodic <b>drinking</b> were more likely to be involved in an incident of MARA. In addition, those who were involved in MARA had higher levels of trait aggression, concern for social honour and expected positive consequences of aggression in bars than did those without such involvement. The relationship between socially constructed masculinity factors (a combined variable reflecting masculinity, social honour and expected positive consequences) and MARA was mediated by <b>heavy</b> episodic <b>drinking.</b> Social honour accounted for almost all of the predictive power of masculinity factors. <b>Heavy</b> episodic <b>drinking</b> and trait aggression remained significant predictors of MARA in a multivariate model.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{effect of}} {{perceived}} neighborhood cohesion (NC) on daily smoking/heavier drinking {{has not been}} previously examined among Chinese. This study examines the association between perceived NC, education, and daily smoking/heavier drinking, and assesses interaction between low NC and lower education on smoking/drinking. METHODS: A randomly selected representative sample of 12, 302 participants aged over 15 from the Hong Kong Jockey Club FAMILY Project was used. Perceived NC {{was defined as the}} perception of bonds among neighbors and measured using Sampson et al. ’s five-item scale (1997). <b>Heavier</b> <b>drinking</b> was defined as alcohol consumption of more than 168 grams (for males) and 120 grams (for females) per week, or engagement in binge drinking in the past month. Synergy indices (SI) were used to examine the interaction effect between NC and education on smoking/drinking. RESULTS: Low NC was associated with daily smoking (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 1. 51; 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 1. 18 - 1. 92) and <b>heavier</b> <b>drinking</b> (AOR = 1. 64; 95 % CI = 1. 13 - 2. 38) among females only. Studying their combined effect, low NC was associated with smoking (AOR = 1. 75; 95 % CI: 1. 35 - 2. 26) and drinking (AOR = 1. 66; 95 % CI: 1. 15 - 2. 39) among females with secondary education only. The proportions of smoking/drinking were the largest among females with low NC and secondary education. This group also reported the largest odds to smoke (AOR = 5. 49; 95 % CI = 3. 25 - 9. 26) or drink (AOR = 1. 77; 95 % CI = 1. 08 - 2. 91). SI between low NC and secondary education were larger than 1, indicating that their combined effect is larger than the addition of their individual effects. Interaction accounted for 43 % and 28 % of the combined effect of low NC and secondary education on smoking and drinking, respectively. CONCLUSION: Females characterized by low perceived NC and lower education level are associated with higher odds of daily smoking or <b>heavier</b> <b>drinking</b> and may benefit from targeted prevention programs. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R
