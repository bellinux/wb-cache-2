50|$|Although {{the output}} of modern {{computers}} is generally all {{in the form of}} <b>dot</b> <b>matrices</b> (technically speaking), computers may internally store data as either a <b>dot</b> <b>matrix</b> or as a vector pattern of lines and curves. Vector data encoding requires less memory and less data storage, in situations where the shapes may need to be resized, as with font typefaces. For maximum image quality using only <b>dot</b> <b>matrix</b> fonts, it would be necessary to store a separate <b>dot</b> <b>matrix</b> pattern for the many different potential point sizes that might be used. Instead, a single group of vector shapes is used to render all the specific <b>dot</b> <b>matrix</b> patterns needed for the current display or printing task.|$|R
50|$|A <b>dot</b> <b>matrix</b> {{is useful}} for marking {{materials}} other than paper. In manufacturing industry, many product marking applications use <b>dot</b> <b>matrix</b> inkjet or impact methods. This {{can also be used}} to print 2D matrix codes, e.g. Datamatrix.|$|R

5000|$|Often {{considered}} the [...] "backbone" [...] of many industrial and back-office systems, {{there are several}} types of line matrix printers used today across diverse enterprise production environments including: manufacturing, supply chain, distribution & logistics, transportation, finance and banking. <b>Dot</b> <b>matrix</b> printers, also known also as impact printers, represent the oldest printing technology, are still widely used today, due to its lowest 'cost per page' ratio. <b>Dot</b> <b>matrix</b> printers are divided on two main groups: serial <b>dot</b> <b>matrix</b> printers and line matrix [...] printers.|$|R
50|$|A <b>dot</b> <b>matrix</b> is a 2-dimensional {{patterned}} array, used {{to represent}} characters, symbols and images. Every type of modern technology uses <b>dot</b> <b>matrices</b> for display of information, including cell phones, televisions, and printers. They are also used in textiles with sewing, knitting, and weaving.|$|R
50|$|Comb printers, {{also called}} line matrix printers, {{represent}} the fifth major design. These printers are {{a hybrid of}} <b>dot</b> <b>matrix</b> printing and line printing. In these printers, a comb of hammers prints {{a portion of a}} row of pixels at one time, such as every eighth pixel. By shifting the comb back and forth slightly, the entire pixel row can be printed, continuing the example, in just eight cycles. The paper then advances and the next pixel row is printed. Because far less motion is involved than in a conventional <b>dot</b> <b>matrix</b> printer, these printers are very fast compared to <b>dot</b> <b>matrix</b> printers and are competitive in speed with formed-character line printers while also being able to print <b>dot</b> <b>matrix</b> graphics. The Printronix P7000 series of line matrix printers are still manufactured as of 2013.|$|R
5000|$|In 1952-1954, {{he filed}} five patent {{applications}} for a <b>dot</b> <b>matrix</b> teletypewriter (aka [...] "teletype writer 7 stylus 35 dot matrix"), later granted in 1957 (see German patent #1,006,007). In April 1953, {{he was hired}} by Telefonbau und Normalzeit GmbH (TuN, later called Tenovis). In 1956, TuN introduced the device to the Deutsche Bundespost (German Post Office), which did not show interest. In his final contract with TuN (dated May 31, 1957), he sold the five patent applications to TuN for 12,000 Deutsche Marks and 50% of the device's net future profits (while retaining rights for the U.S. market). Photos and working papers of the <b>dot</b> <b>matrix</b> teletypewriter prototype were submitted to his first U.S. employer, General Mills, in 1957. A set of working papers for the <b>dot</b> <b>matrix</b> teletypewriter were published in 1961. At Boeing in 1966-1967, the <b>dot</b> <b>matrix</b> teletypewriter design was the basis for a portable facsimile machine (using <b>dot</b> <b>matrix),</b> which was prototyped and evaluated for military use by teams at Boeing, including sales.|$|R

40|$|Thesis {{submitted}} to the Department of Electrical Engineering in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the Masters Technology in Electrical Engineering in the Faculty of Engineering at the Cape Peninsula University of TechnologyDifferent LED <b>dot</b> <b>matrix</b> driving topologies and concurrent data transfer methods were investigated in this dissertation. The LED <b>dot</b> <b>matrix</b> driving topologies was first implemented and then tested. The designs tested were: the constant voltage, constant current, bi-polar and use of an existing LED <b>dot</b> <b>matrix</b> display driving integrated circuit (IC). All four driving topologies were evaluated to determine the brightest design. It {{was found that the}} constant current design performed the best, while the existing driving IC did not function at all. The bi-polar was a very close second while the constant voltage design performed the worst. The improvements in the bi-polar design with respect to the refresh rate were not enough to warrant the use of the bi-polar design in future permutations of the hardware. It was decided to improve the constant current driving topology and use this as the backbone for the LED <b>dot</b> <b>matrix</b> displays. Since the size of LED <b>dot</b> <b>matrix</b> displays are increasing, a smarter driving algorithm in conjunction with hardware needed to be developed. It was therefore decided to subdivide a large LED <b>dot</b> <b>matrix</b> display into smaller sections called panels. These panels can be connected in a horizontal, vertical, or {{a combination of the two}} to suit the user requirements. The panels were connected to adjacent panels to aid in determining the display size and configuration. Display graphics data was then sent to all the panels concurrently even though each panel still updated serially. This improved the brightness and refresh rate of the entire LED <b>dot</b> <b>matrix</b> display. Controlling this display required the use of a powerful processor as the algorithm had to subdivide graphics and distribute these to the panels to be displayed. Making use of pseudo-addressing, each panel connected to the system was assigned a temporary address. A Raspberry Pi computer was used to implement and execute the display algorithm. For connecting the Raspberry Pi computer to the LED <b>dot</b> <b>matrix</b> display panels, an interface card was developed. This interface card was only activated once the Raspberry Pi was connected. The on-board microcontroller on the interface card controlled the LED <b>dot</b> <b>matrix</b> display brightness. This was done by measuring the ambient light and adjusting the digital resistors placed on the LED <b>dot</b> <b>matrix</b> panels. The value of these resistors in conjunction with the current sources used in the hardware design determined the brightness of the display...|$|R

50|$|Some companies, such as Printek, DASCOM, WeP Peripherals, Epson, Okidata, Olivetti, Compuprint, Lexmark, and TallyGenicom still produce serial printers. Printronix is now {{the only}} {{manufacturer}} of line printers. Today, a new <b>dot</b> <b>matrix</b> printer actually costs more than most inkjet printers and some entry level laser printers. Despite this initial price difference, the printing costs for inkjet and laser printers are a great deal higher than for <b>dot</b> <b>matrix</b> printers, and the inkjet/laser printer manufacturers effectively use their monopoly over arbitrarily priced printer cartridges to subsidize the initial cost of the printer itself. <b>Dot</b> <b>matrix</b> ribbons are a commodity and are not monopolized by the printer manufacturers themselves.|$|R
