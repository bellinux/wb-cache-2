25|$|To {{prevent their}} camp being located or {{compromised}} by German radio direction <b>finding</b> <b>equipment</b> or informers, Tonkin regularly moved its location. The location of new camps {{had to be}} close to water and a drop zone for parachute supply. The camp located near to Verrières was near to their drop zone at La Font d'Usson and had an adequate water supply. The SAS Squadron had been at Verrières between 25 June and 1 July. The local population had also become aware of the camp and Tonkin was warned by Maingard that if the locals knew, informers would soon tell the Germans. Tonkin ordered the squadron to move to a new camp just south in the Bois des Cartes. This new camp was also close to their drop zone at La Font d'Usson where they were expecting a supply drop over the night of 3/4 July. On their arrival at the new camp at Bois des Cartes, the water supply from the well failed and due to this Tonkin decided to return to Verrières until a more suitable camp site could be found.|$|E
