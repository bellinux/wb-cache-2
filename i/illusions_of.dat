5|$|As he {{nears the}} cabin, the {{imaginary}} Barry appears and tells Alan {{that he will}} have to reject all the illusions before he can face off against the insane version of Alan, including the apparition of Barry. Alan is ready to accept that, forcing Alan to fight Taken <b>illusions</b> <b>of</b> Dr. Hartman, Barry, and the Andersons, defeating them all before he is able to reenter the cabin. His crazed side is in a paranoid state on the cabin floor, and when Alan touches him, the two are made whole again. Alan realizes that he cannot let himself fall into a delusional state again for fear of never being able to escape, and returns to the typewriter to start a new story—"Return".|$|E
5|$|The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr., {{was filmed}} {{primarily}} on the Warner Bros. soundstages. Town and street scenes were staged on the Western backlot, known as Laramie Street. It {{was one of the}} last Western shows to use the backlot. Cuse said that logistics were a problem because so many of the Hollywood Western sets and towns had been torn down by the 1990s. Outdoor scenes were shot on the Warner Bros. ranch in Valencia, California; Bronson Canyon in Los Angeles; and the Valuze Ranch in Santa Clarita, California. Some of the locomotive scenes from Brisco were filmed on location at Railtown 1897 State Historic Park in Jamestown, California. A painting used in the show as a backdrop to create <b>illusions</b> <b>of</b> greater depth perspectives is exhibited at the park.|$|E

5|$|More recent historians, such as Michael Hicks and A. J. Pollard, {{have tried}} to see Warwick {{in light of the}} {{standards}} of his own age, rather than holding him up to contemporary constitutional ideals. The insults Warwick suffered at the hands of King Edward – including Edward's secret marriage, and the refusal of the French diplomatic channel – were significant. His claim to prominence in national affairs was not a product of <b>illusions</b> <b>of</b> grandeur; it was confirmed by the high standing he enjoyed among the princes on the continent. Furthermore, Warwick's cause was not considered unjust by his contemporaries, which can be seen by the earl's popularity exceeding that of the king {{at the time of his}} first rebellion in 1469. On the other hand, while Warwick could not easily suffer his treatment by the king, it was equally impossible for Edward to accept the earl's presence on the political scene. As long as Warwick remained as powerful and influential as he was, Edward could not fully assert his royal authority, and eventual confrontation became inevitable.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} begins with Vives {{waking up and}} seeing two women in the bed with him. He remembers being seduced by them when he was drunk the night before. Realizing this, he packs his {{belongings}} and leaves the house. He is seen driving a car until it runs out fuel which forces him to travel by foot where he eventually arrives at a town. In another house, a woman (played by Fabián) wakes up recalling the events of her abusive husband (played by Zamora). She enters a church and says a prayer. Later, Vives is seen hanging out with two men at an outdoor bar when he spots the woman whom he immediately becomes smitten with. Afterwards, he {{and the two men}} are fishing on a boat when Vives sees the woman again. He begins having <b>illusions</b> <b>of</b> him and the woman having a happy life together which drives him insane in his room. That night, the woman finds her husband making love to another woman in a car. Upon discovering this, she leaves the house. At the same time, the town is holding a festival where Vives is celebrating with the townsfolk. The video concludes with him and the woman seeing each other once more and they decide to go out together.|$|E

30|$|This article {{examines}} Vietnamese Australian gamblers’ views on luck and winning {{to explore their}} subjective perspectives. <b>Illusion</b> <b>of</b> control beliefs {{have been identified as}} a predictor of gambling frequency and a risk factor for problem gambling. Culture-specific beliefs regarding luck and winning may further strengthen universal <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> control beliefs. Twenty-one Vietnamese-Australian gamblers were interviewed with regard to their subjective views of luck and winning at gambling. It was hypothesized that regular gamblers would hold substantial <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> control beliefs, that culture-specific schemas would be present in their beliefs about gambling outcomes, and that universal schemas commonly found in gamblers from other cultural backgrounds would also be present. The results indicated that Vietnamese Australian gamblers held both universal <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> control beliefs and some culture-specific beliefs. The implications of culture-specific schemas in reinforcing <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> control beliefs are discussed.|$|R

25|$|Architectural {{interest}} in Cubism {{centered on the}} dissolution and reconstitution of three-dimensional form, using simple geometric shapes, juxtaposed without the <b>illusions</b> <b>of</b> classical perspective. Diverse elements could be superimposed, made transparent or penetrate one another, while retaining their spatial relationships. Cubism had become an influential factor {{in the development of}} modern architecture from 1912 (La Maison Cubiste, by Raymond Duchamp-Villon and André Mare) onwards, developing in parallel with architects such as Peter Behrens and Walter Gropius, with the simplification of building design, the use of materials appropriate to industrial production, and the increased use of glass.|$|E
25|$|Although cleverer {{than the}} Prince, Baldrick, knowing {{his place in}} the medieval pecking-order, holds him in awe. He often leads cheers in the Prince's honour (along with Lord Percy, who tries hard to join in), fills his head with <b>illusions</b> <b>of</b> grandeur, and often ends up doing his dirty work. This {{included}} carrying the decapitated body of Richard III and sleeping with the Spanish Infanta, Edmund's fiancée, making her unchaste in hopes that this would prevent the marriage. The latter task resulted in several injuries, including a seriously blackened eye. When Baldrick is abandoned by Edmund in the final episode, a tear falls from his eye.|$|E

25|$|Many {{of these}} weapons and {{implements}} have their origins in the wrathful arena of the battlefield and the funereal realm of the charnel grounds. As primal images of destruction, slaughter, sacrifice, and necromancy these weapons were wrested {{from the hands of}} the evil and turned - as symbols - against the ultimate root of evil, the self-cherishing conceptual identity that gives rise to the five poisons of ignorance, desire, hatred, pride, and jealousy. In the hands of siddhas, dakinis, wrathful and semi-wrathful yidam deities, protective deities or dharmapalas these implements became pure symbols, weapons of transformation, and an expression of the deities' wrathful compassion which mercilessly destroys the manifold <b>illusions</b> <b>of</b> the inflated human ego.|$|E
25|$|Individual differences, such as {{skill at}} {{engaging}} active coping techniques and comfort with expressing emotions, may modify {{the tendency to}} successfully employ emotional approach coping. Individuals high in perceived emotional intelligence may also {{be more likely to}} use emotional approach coping skillfully. Holding unrealistic perceptions of control may make the use of coping through emotional approach less likely because expressing and processing emotions could lead to evaluations that result in acknowledgement of <b>illusions</b> <b>of</b> control. Personality attributes, such as hope, can also moderate the effectiveness of emotional approach coping. Women with breast cancer who were high in hope and reported coping with emotional expression, had fewer medical appointments for cancer-related complaints, enhanced physical health and decreased distress compared to women who did not cope using emotional expression.|$|E

Catecismo á los ateos. ¿Qué son las escuelas laicas? Romanones, ¡á la barra! (1913) re-prnted earlier pamphlets and went on with new onslaught on secular education, based on outdated <b>illusions</b> <b>of</b> Rousseau. Finally, ¡Viva el Rey! Psicología social y literaria (1914) tackled major issues like monarchy, strikes, self-government and labor organization, though it also discussed literature. Apart from publications he did not neglect attending public meetings, delivering addresses across Spain at gatherings flavored with Carlism or social-Catholicism.|$|E

It was hypothesised that global personal hopefulness, <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> control, and short-term gambling hope would predict harm to self scores (problem gambling). A hierarchical regression analysis showed support for the hypothesis.

40|$|The <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> transparency, the {{tendency}} for people to overestimate how obvious their internal states appear to outside observers, was examined in 25 school-age children. While previous researchers studied undergraduate participants, we aimed to expand the developmental literature by investigating whether children exhibit the <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> transparency {{in the same manner}} as undergraduates. We presented each child with three pleasant-tasting drinks and two unpleasant-tasting drinks. Two undergraduate observers and the children rated facial expressions after each sip. Our results supported our hypothesis with no <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> transparency for the unpleasant drinks; however, an illusion was found for the pleasant drinks. The children 2 ̆ 7 s inability to follow display rules may explain the absence <b>of</b> the <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> transparency for the unpleasant condition...|$|R
25|$|In weightlessness, astronauts {{must rely}} {{much more on}} vision to {{maintain}} their spatial orientation, because the otolith organs can no longer signal the “down” direction. During prolonged exposure, however, reliance seems to shift toward an intrinsic, body vertical reference. The erroneous <b>illusions</b> <b>of</b> self-motion during head movements performed during and after return to Earth gravity are presumably due to a re-interpretation of vestibular inputs. Ground-based {{studies suggest that the}} CNS resolves the “tilt-translation” ambiguity based on the frequency content of the linear acceleration detected by the otolith organs, with low frequency indicating “tilt” and high frequency indicating “translation”. A crossover exists at about 0.3Hz where the otolith signals are then ambiguous. Exposure to weightlessness presumably results in a shift of this crossover frequency, which could then contribute to spatial disorientation and SMS.|$|E
25|$|Roh {{used this}} term to {{describe}} painting that signaled {{a return to}} realism after expressionism's extravagances, which sought to redesign objects to reveal the spirits of those objects. Magical realism, according to Roh, instead faithfully portrays the exterior of an object, {{and in doing so}} the spirit, or magic, of the object reveals itself. One could relate this exterior magic {{all the way back to}} the 15th century. Flemish painter Van Eyck (1395–1441) highlights the complexity of a natural landscape by creating <b>illusions</b> <b>of</b> continuous and unseen areas that recede into the background, leaving it to the viewer's imagination to fill in those gaps in the image: for instance, in a rolling landscape with river and hills. The magic is contained in the viewer's interpretation of those mysterious unseen or hidden parts of the image.|$|E
25|$|According to Vasari, Uccello’s first {{painting}} was a Saint Anthony between the saints Cosmas and Damianus, a commission {{for the hospital}} of Lelmo. Next, he painted two figures in the convent of Annalena. Shortly afterwards, he painted three frescoes with scenes {{from the life of}} Saint Francis above the left door of the Santa Trinita church. For the Santa Maria Maggiore church, he painted a fresco of the Annunciation. In this fresco, he painted a large building with columns in perspective. According to Vasari, people found this to be a great and beautiful achievement because this was the first example of how lines could be expertly used to demonstrate perspective and size. As a result, this work became a model for artists who wished to craft <b>illusions</b> <b>of</b> space in order to enhance the realness of their paintings.|$|E

25|$|Foreign {{policy was}} the {{responsibility}} of Józef Beck, under whom Polish diplomacy attempted balanced approaches toward Germany and the Soviet Union, unfortunately without success, {{on the basis of}} a flawed understanding of the European geopolitics of his day. Beck had numerous foreign policy schemes and harbored <b>illusions</b> <b>of</b> Poland's status as a great power. He alienated most of Poland's neighbors, but is not blamed by historians for the ultimate failure of relations with Germany. The principal events of his tenure were concentrated in its last two years. In the case of the 1938 Polish ultimatum to Lithuania, the Polish action nearly resulted in a German takeover of southwest Lithuania. Also in 1938, the Polish government opportunistically undertook a hostile action against the Czechoslovak state as weakened by the Munich Agreement and annexed a small piece of territory on its borders. In this case, Beck's understanding of the consequences of the Polish military move turned out to be completely mistaken. In the end, the German occupation of Czechoslovakia ushered in by the Munich Agreement markedly weakened Poland's own position. Furthermore, Beck mistakenly believed that Nazi-Soviet ideological contradictions would preclude their cooperation.|$|E

30|$|Elucidation <b>of</b> the <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> {{control that}} {{emphasizes}} the role of coincidences between behavior and environmental changes {{is an important step}} toward providing a basic background for understanding behavioral and learning mechanisms that are related to the origins of false beliefs (Blanco, 2017; Blanco et al., 2009, 2011, 2012, 2013; Matute, 1996; Matute et al., 2007). The present data support this approach to better understand the general notion <b>of</b> the <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> control. Similar to the findings of Benvenuti et al. (2017), the present results demonstrate that aspects of the social environment can influence the <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> control (emphasized by Langer’s seminal paper) and may be accommodated in the learning approach to the <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> control. Social influence may be responsible for increasing the probability of responding in a noncontingent task.|$|R
