25|$|White chocolate, {{although}} {{similar in}} texture {{to that of}} milk and dark chocolate, <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>contain</b> any cocoa solids. Because of this, many countries <b>do</b> <b>not</b> consider white chocolate as chocolate at all. Because it <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>contain</b> any cocoa solids, white chocolate <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>contain</b> any theobromine, {{so it can be}} consumed by animals.|$|R
5|$|Although (reportedly) {{molybdenum}} {{was deliberately}} alloyed with steel in one 14th-century Japanese sword (mfd. ca. 1330), that art was never employed widely {{and was later}} lost. In the West in 1754, Bengt Andersson Qvist examined a sample of molybdenite and determined that it <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>contain</b> lead and thus was not galena.|$|E
5|$|Following the Local Government Act 1888, the {{remaining}} county {{came under the}} control of Middlesex County Council except for the parish of Monken Hadley, which became part of Hertfordshire. The area of responsibility of the Lord Lieutenant of Middlesex was reduced accordingly. Middlesex <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>contain</b> any county boroughs, so the county and administrative county (the area of county council control) were identical.|$|E
5|$|Szabó's {{first four}} {{full-length}} films featured the actor András Bálint in roles based on Szabó himself. While Bálint {{also appeared in}} Budapest Tales, this was Szabó's first feature film that <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>contain</b> {{a significant amount of}} autobiographical material. He did not make another autobiographical film until Meeting Venus, eighteen years later.|$|E

5|$|Another type of {{mounting}} that became fashionable around the mid-Heian period is the kenukigata, or hair-tweezer style, {{named for the}} characteristically shaped hilt, which is pierced along the center. In this style, the hilt is fitted with an ornamental border and <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>contain</b> any wooden covering. Like kazari-tachi, swords with this mounting were used for ceremonial purposes but also in warfare, as an example held at Ise Grand Shrine shows.|$|E
5|$|Issho ni A-SO-BO also {{contained}} several serious errors. Petit Ferret addressed {{these issues in}} two patches. The first patch added missing voice data from the original game CD; customers were given the option of downloading the patch or exchanging for a new CD. Ferret released the second patch on July 7, 2003; it corrected grammatical errors, adjusted the game's difficulty, and enhanced stability. The second patch <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>contain</b> the first's fixes.|$|E

The leaked episode <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>contain</b> the new arrangement of the theme tune by Murray Gold. The leak was ultimately traced to a third party company in Canada which had a legitimate preview copy. The employee responsible was fired by the company and the BBC considered further legal action.|$|E

5|$|The English and Danish editions {{differed}} in several significant ways. The English edition was somewhat shorter and more concise, and included newer information that Heilmann had acquired {{by studying the}} actual fossils of Archaeopteryx in Berlin, {{as well as from}} foreign scientists who sent him photographs and plaster casts. It also contained considerably less harsh language towards Boas and others with whom he disagreed. Curiously, the English edition <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>contain</b> the transformational sequences inspired by D'Arcy Thompson, though Heilmann still briefly acknowledged the use of his methods in reconstructing his Proavis.|$|E
5|$|The aircrew had {{an unusually}} high ratio of crew to passengers, as six {{deadheading}} crew were on board. Twelve passengers occupied the upper deck first class, while in business almost all of 24 seats were taken; in economy class, approximately 80 seats <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>contain</b> passengers. There were 22 {{children under the age}} of 12 years aboard. One hundred and thirty passengers planned to connect to other destinations such as Tokyo, Hong Kong, and Taipei.|$|E
5|$|The {{games were}} {{the first in the}} series that <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>contain</b> all of the Pokémon from {{previous}} generations. Sugimori stated that the team tried to include all the new Pokémon as well as some from previous generations. When asked about any features that could not be included due to technical restrictions, Masuda noted that he wanted each individual Pokémon to make up to three different cries depending on its mood.|$|E

5|$|The {{mission of}} Michaelmas Task Force was to (1) seize the Saidor area; (2) {{establish}} facilities for a fighter group; (3) {{assist in the}} establishment of air forces in the area; (4) assist {{in the establishment of}} light naval forces in the area; and (5) construct minimal port and base facilities. Notably, it <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>contain</b> any explicit instruction to fight the Japanese. Lieutenant General Frank Berryman's Australian II Corps would cooperate by exploitation along the coast, while the Australian 7th Division would contain Japanese forces in the Bogadjim area by fighting patrols.|$|E
5|$|A neutron {{spectrometer}} {{on board the}} Lunar Prospector spacecraft detected enhanced concentrations of hydrogen close to {{the northern and southern}} lunar poles, including the crater Shackleton. At the end of this mission in July 1999, the spacecraft was crashed into the nearby crater Shoemaker in the hope of detecting from Earth-based telescopes an impact-generated plume containing water vapor. The impact event did not produce any detectable water vapor, and this may be an indication that the hydrogen is not in the form of hydrated minerals, or that the impact site <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>contain</b> any ice. Alternatively, {{it is possible that the}} crash did not excavate deeply enough into the regolith to liberate significant quantities of water vapor.|$|E
5|$|Beer {{was spread}} through Europe by Germanic and Celtic tribes {{as far back}} as 3000 BC, and it was mainly brewed on a {{domestic}} scale. The product that the early Europeans drank might not be recognised as beer by most people today. Alongside the basic starch source, the early European beers might contain fruits, honey, numerous types of plants, spices and other substances such as narcotic herbs. What they <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>contain</b> was hops, as that was a later addition, first mentioned in Europe around 822 by a Carolingian Abbot and again in 1067 by Abbess Hildegard of Bingen.|$|E

5|$|Citing Hirabayashi, Chief Justice Stone {{wrote the}} opinion of the court, and {{determined}} that the curfew and exclusion orders were valid, even as applied to citizens of the United States. Stone’s opinion was three pages and <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>contain</b> any concurring opinions or dissents, while the Hirabayashi decision had thirty-four pages and two concurring opinions. In Yasui the court affirmed his conviction of the misdemeanor, but ordered re-sentencing since the lower court had determined that the curfew was not valid, and that Yasui had forfeited his citizenship. The Supreme Court remanded (returned) the case back to the district court to determine a sentence in light of these circumstances.|$|E
5|$|Digital {{intermediate}} (DI) {{was conducted}} at Annapurna Studios in Hyderabad. A high-end DI system was imported and the process took six months to complete. Singer Chinmayi, who dubbed for Samantha in Eega, found the process difficult because the footage <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>contain</b> the animated fly. Rajamouli approached Anuj Gurwara to write the dialogue for the Hindi-dubbed version titled Makkhi. The Hindi dubbing began in Hyderabad, and Gurwara dubbed for Nani in the film. Ajay Devgan and his wife Kajol, acting as parents telling the film's story to their child at bedtime, provided voiceovers during the opening credits of Makkhi. The visuals accompanying the closing credits were altered to show the fly mimicking the antics of Devgan, Salman Khan, and Akshay Kumar.|$|E
5|$|In February 2009, U2 {{released}} their 12th studio album, No Line on the Horizon. The album received generally favourable {{reviews and}} debuted at {{number one in}} over 30 countries, but its sales of 5million units were comparatively low by U2 standards and it <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>contain</b> a hit single. Having spent time in Fez, Morocco, recording and absorbing exotic musical influences, the group intended the record to be more experimental than their previous two. However, critics {{found it to be}} more conventional than expected. During the five-and-a-half year gestation period for Songs of Innocence, lead singer Bono expressed uncertainty on several occasions over how U2 could remain relevant musically after the relatively lukewarm commercial performance of No Line on the Horizon.|$|E
