5|$|In April 1955, a Caltrans {{official}} {{announced that}} US 80 {{would be built}} as a freeway for its entire length in California, {{as it was to}} be included in the Interstate Highway System. In the meantime, while plans moved further along on US 101, the mayor of San Diego asked the California Highway Commission to keep the US 80 project on track. However, the construction was put on hold because of lower traffic levels on US 80, compared to other local highways. State Assemblyman Hegland raised the issue in the Assembly Highway subcommittee in December, stating that the construction of the freeway would <b>help</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> and the Port of San Diego. State Senator Collier went even further and blamed the delay on San Diego County officials, in addition to linking the delay to damaging the program to develop the port. The bridge over the Colorado River was replaced in 1956, at a cost of $1.2 million, and was in use until 1978, when the I-8 bridge was built.|$|E

25|$|During {{election}} night, Milanović gave {{an interview}} to the three major television networks where he congratulated Ivo Josipović and called on Jadranka Kosor {{to hold a meeting}} with him where they would discuss the major political differences between their two parties {{and find a way to}} agree on how to <b>help</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> further. The prime minister responded the very same night when she congratulated Josipović saying she invited the opposition leader for a coffee over six months ago claiming he refused. Milanović responded the next day by saying he doesn't want finger-pointing, but a constructive discussion about jobs, the budget and tax reform. They came to an agreement the following week and they held a meeting on 21 January.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the end of}} the {{currency}} peg, the ringgit appreciated to as high as 3.16 to the US dollar in April 2008. The ringgit had also enjoyed a period of appreciation against the Hong Kong dollar (HKD) (from 0.49 to 0.44 to the MYR) and the renminbi (CNY) (0.46 to 0.45 to the MYR) as recently as May 2008. The initial stability of the ringgit in the late-2000s had led to considerations to reintroduce {{the currency}} to foreign trading. In a CNBC interview in September 2010, Najib Tun Razak, the then Prime Minister and Finance Minister of Malaysia, was quoted in stating that the government was planning the reentry of the ringgit into off-shore trading if the move will <b>help</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy,</b> with the condition that rules and regulations were put in place to prevent abuses.|$|E
25|$|The BEF's {{manpower}} shortage was {{not solely}} {{the fault of}} the politicians. 120,000 men of the BEF general reserve were kept in Britain to <b>help</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> by spending their wages there. There were too many troops in the Middle East (2 divisions were rushed from there to France after the German offensive began), but this was partly the fault of Robertson who had attempted to prevent action there by submitting inflated estimates of troop requirements. 88,000 BEF men were on leave when the German offensive began. Haig seems to have had little sympathy with the government’s political constraints – he was unhappy at their lack of vigour in conscripting organised labour (diary 23 December 1917, 10 March), whilst as late as 29 March, following the first German Spring Offensive, Haig would press for the extension of conscription to Ireland (not just for military reasons but “for the good of Ireland”, and disagreeing with the King). Although there were about 1.5m soldiers under Home Forces Command in the UK at any one time, nearly a third of these were sick or wounded and another third engaged on legitimate work for various branches of the Army. Only around a third were potentially available for service on the Western Front, the majority of these being in training or under nineteen. Eighteen-year olds had to be sent to France after the German Spring Offensives in 1918.|$|E

500|$|The {{road was}} {{originally}} planned as a parkway in 1932, {{running from the}} Ben Franklin Bridge in Camden to Atlantic City, but it never materialized. [...] The idea for a limited access road between the Philadelphia area and Atlantic City resurfaced in the 1950s when South Jersey officials, led by State Senator Frank S. Farley, pushed for an expressway between the two areas to <b>help</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> of Southern New Jersey. The New Jersey State Highway Department authorized traffic studies for a toll road between Turnersville and Atlantic City in 1958 and 1959, and the New Jersey Expressway Authority Act in 1962 called for a five-member agency (the New Jersey Expressway Authority) with representatives from four Southern New Jersey counties {{to be responsible for}} issuing bonds to build and maintain the Atlantic City Expressway.|$|E

2500|$|In 2009, an ICE {{audit of}} American Apparel's {{employment}} records uncovered discrepancies in the documentation of about 25% of the company's workers, implying mainly {{that they were}} undocumented immigrants. About 1,500 workers were let go in September of that year as a result. American Apparel responded with questions {{of the effectiveness of}} such an action and said [...] " [...] will not <b>help</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy,</b> will not make us safer. No matter how we choose to define or label them [...] are hard-working, taxpaying workers.” The ICE audit highlighted a new strategy from President Obama which announced they were shifting away from high-profile raids. According to CEO Dov Charney, American Apparel promised its workers who were fired for improper immigration documentation that they would be given [...] "priority treatment, in terms of being interviewed for future positions with the company," [...] if and when they [...] "got [...] immigration papers in order." [...] Commenting on the loss of 1,500 workers due to concerns over illegal immigration Charney said [...] "It broke our efficiencies and generated a situation where we were late delivering garments. It lost us an enormous amount of money. It cost us agility." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1999, {{near the}} height of the dot com boom, The New York Times {{approached}} Krugman to write a bi-weekly column on [...] "the vagaries of business and economics in an age of prosperity." [...] His first columns in 2000 addressed business and economic issues, but as the 2000 US presidential campaign progressed, Krugman increasingly focused on George W. Bush's policy proposals. According to Krugman, this was partly due to [...] "the silence of the media – those 'liberal media' conservatives complain about..." [...] Krugman accused Bush of repeatedly misrepresenting his proposals, and criticized the proposals themselves. After Bush's election, and his perseverance with his proposed tax cut {{in the midst of the}} slump (which Krugman argued would do little to <b>help</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> but substantially raise the fiscal deficit), Krugman's columns grew angrier and more focused on the administration. As Alan Blinder put it in 2002, [...] "There's been a kind of missionary quality to his writing since then ... He's trying to stop something now, using the power of the pen." [...] Partly as a result, Krugman's twice-weekly column on the Op-Ed page of The New York Times has made him, according to Nicholas Confessore, [...] "the most important political columnist in America... he is almost alone in analyzing the most important story in politics in recent years – the seamless melding of corporate, class, and political party interests at which the Bush administration excels." [...] In an interview in late 2009, Krugman said his missionary zeal had changed in the post-Bush era and he described the Obama administration as [...] "good guys but not as forceful as I'd like...When I argue with them in my column this is a serious discussion. We really are in effect speaking across the transom here." [...] Krugman says he's more effective at driving change outside the administration than inside it, [...] "now, I'm trying to make this progressive moment in American history a success. So that's where I'm pushing." ...|$|E

2500|$|The first budget {{introduced}} by Martin in February 1994, {{who had become}} the Finance Minister in November 1993 {{was described as a}} [...] "mild and tame" [...] budget focused only on the target of reducing the deficit to 3% of GNP within three years, and brought in modest cuts, mostly to defence spending. Until the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the Chrétien government tended to be hostile towards defence spending with the government's white paper [...] "Defence 94" [...] declaring that in a post-Cold War world there would be less and less need for armed forces, which accordingly meant reduced budgets for the military. The Canadian historian Jack Granatstein in his 2004 book Who Killed the Canadian Military? accused the Chrétien government of putting the military in the uncomfortable position in the 1990s of having to do more and more UN peacekeeping missions while cutting defence spending at the same time. Granatstein accused Chrétien of having [...] "finished off the Canadian Forces" [...] through a policy of heavy cuts inspired by a deep personal dislike of the military and of using the military as UN peacekeepers rather preparing to fight a war. Outside of defence spending, there were few cuts in the 1994 budget. In a radio interview with Ron Collister in March 1994, Chrétien stated: [...] "To go to our goal of 3 per cent of GNP, all the cuts been announced in the budget. There will not be a new round." [...] According to the diplomat James Bartleman, Chrétien told him in early 1994 that major cuts to government spending outside of defence were out of the question, and instead he hoped that economy would grow enough on its own that the deficit would disappear without any cuts. Chrétien's plans in early 1994 for economic growth were to increase exports by embracing globalization and free trade with as many nations as possible, arguing that the export offensive would stimulate the economy out of the early 1990s recession. The 1994 budget was widely criticised by journalists such as Andrew Coyne as useless in even achieving its target of reducing deficit to 3% of GNP within three years, let alone eliminating the deficit, and led to a celebrated clash between Coyne and Martin in the boardroom of the Globe and Mail newspaper. Investor reaction to the 1994 budget was very negative with many concluding that the Liberals had no serious interest in dealing with the debt problem with one economist recalling that after the 1994 budget the consensus amongst economists was that [...] "They don’t get it. They just don’t get it". David A. Dodge, the Deputy Finance Minister complained repeatedly to Martin throughout 1994 that the 3% target was meaningless as Canada did not plan to join the European Union, that it was unlikely to be achieved with the current levels of cuts outlined in the 1994 budget, and would even if achieved would do nothing to <b>help</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy.</b> Accordingly, Dodge advocated far more drastic cuts, policy advice that both Martin ignored until late 1994 and Chrétien until early 1995. Dodge had appointed deputy finance minister by Mulroney in 1992, and thus his views were something to the right of both Martin and Chrétien. In April 1994, interest rates in Canada started a steady rise that would continue until early 1995.|$|E
