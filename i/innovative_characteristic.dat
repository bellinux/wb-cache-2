50|$|The Embryophyta are {{the most}} {{familiar}} group of green plants that form vegetation on earth. Living embryophytes include hornworts, liverworts, mosses, ferns, lycophytes, gymnosperms and flowering plants, and emerged within the Charophyte green algae. The Embryophyta are informally called land plants because they live primarily in terrestrial habitats, while the related green algae are primarily aquatic. All are complex multicellular eukaryotes with specialized reproductive organs. The name derives from their <b>innovative</b> <b>characteristic</b> of nurturing the young embryo sporophyte {{during the early stages}} of its multicellular development within the tissues of the parent gametophyte. With very few exceptions, embryophytes obtain their energy by photosynthesis, that is by using the energy of sunlight to synthesize their food from carbon dioxide and water.|$|E

For firms acquiring small private firms and former subsidiaries—but not public targets—the evidence is consistent with three propositions: (1) A firm's commitment to internal R&D is negatively affected by the decision to acquire; (2) Low R&D productivity increases the likelihood of acquisition; (3) A large knowledge stock predisposes firms to acquire because they perceive they are capable of selecting and absorbing targets. We conclude that acquisitions of small private firms and former subsidiaries are a viable R&D strategy to explore a range of potential future innovation trajectories for large public firms...|$|R

40|$|A novel feedback-based rate {{adaptation}} scheme is introduced and investigated in this paper. Its main <b>innovative</b> <b>characteristic</b> is the modulation {{of the rate}} increment by the distance between a flow’s present rate and an assumed targeted maximum rate as dictated by the associated application. The previous along with the shaping of the rate decrement by the reported flow’s losses are responsible for a dynamic and self-adjusting behavior that is shown to improve convergence to fairness, the oscillatory behavior of the rate and the induced packet losses {{when compared with the}} basic Additive Increase Multiplicative Decrease (AI/MD) scheme. Numerical results illustrate the good properties and intrinsic advantages of the proposed scheme both under the considered modeling assumptions, as well as under more real networking conditions by employing the ns- 2 simulator. A brief comparison of the proposed scheme with the TCP-compatible schemes TFRC, IIAD and the non-AI/MD schemes AIPD, LIMPD, is included as well. Because of the aforementioned induced behavior and assumed flow’s characteristics (min and max rates), the proposed congestion control scheme seems to be appropriate for regulating the rate of streaming applications...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} structure-finding {{algorithm}} designed to identify galaxy groups in photometric-redshift data sets: the probability friends-of-friends (pFoF) algorithm. This algorithm is derived {{by combining the}} FoF algorithm in the transverse direction and the photometric-redshift probability densities in the radial dimension. The <b>innovative</b> <b>characteristic</b> of our group-finding algorithm is the improvement of redshift estimation via the constraints given by the transversely connected galaxies in a group, {{based on the assumption}} that all galaxies in a group have the same redshift. Tests using the Virgo Consortium Millennium Simulation mock catalogs allow us to show that the recovery rate of the pFoF algorithm is larger than 80 % for mock groups of at least 2 x 10 ^ 13 M-sun, while the false detection rate is about 10 % for pFoF groups containing around at least eight net members. Applying the algorithm to the Canadian Network for Observational Cosmology Survey group catalogs gives results which are consistent with the mock catalog tests. From all these results, we conclude that our group-finding algorithm offers an effective yet simple way to identify galaxy groups in photometric-redshift catalogs...|$|E
40|$|Motivation is a {{critical}} factor in the academic performance, especially in the EHEA context, where the active learning must be promoted. In the case of engineering education, it is particularly necessary to care the student motivation by several reasons. The difficulty of engineering degrees can hinder the motivation of students and it can affect the high levels of absenteeism and dropping out. Thus, it is important to work up frameworks to evaluate and enhance, in addition to technical competences, other competences such as motivation. This paper presents the definition of a motivational framework composed by several instruments, resources, mechanisms and technologies. It allows teachers and academic institutions to evaluate and enhance the motivation of their students. But the most <b>innovative</b> <b>characteristic</b> of the framework lies in the student side; it also allows students to self-evaluate and enhance their motivation by performing questionnaires, recommendations and complementary training activities. In order to validate the proposed solutions, a case study has been successfully performed with 152 students of the Technical University of Madrid. The empirical experience has enabled to confirm the usefulness of the provided framework and to explore motivational aspects related with the engineering education...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Today, GPS is {{the most}} popular and widely used {{three-dimensional}} positioning technology in the world. However, in many everyday environments such as indoors or in urban areas, GPS signals are not available for positioning (due to the very weak signals). Even with high sensitivity GPS receivers, positioning for urban and indoor environments cannot be guaranteed in all situations, and accuracies are typically of the order of tens to hundreds of meters at best. Other emerging technologies obtain positions from systems that are not designed for positioning, such as mobile phones or television. As a result, the accuracy, reliability and simplicity of the position solution is typically very poor in comparison to GPS with {{a clear view of the}} sky. Locata is a new positioning technology, developed to address the failure of current technologies for reliable ubiquitous (outdoor and indoor) positioning. In this paper key aspects of the new technology are discussed, with particular emphasis on the positioning network (LocataNet). An <b>innovative</b> <b>characteristic</b> of the LocataNet is its ability to propagate (autonomously) into difficult environments and over wide areas. Through an experimental LocataNet installation, a key mechanism for achieving this is tested, and real-time stand-alone positioning (without a base station and additional data link) with sub-centimeter precision is demonstrated...|$|E

30|$|The YouTrace project {{intends to}} be a social {{platform}} that {{allows users to}} collaborate {{with the construction of}} a map-of-the-world [7] (Fig.  1). A key element is the Map Generation Engine that is responsible for aggregating the users’ traces into a single map. A YouTrace user can upload their traces while contributing to the construction of a joint map of the world. The users can then receive an updated map that will allow, for example, a more efficient car navigational application. An <b>innovative</b> <b>characteristic</b> of collaborative mapping is the strength of its dynamics, as opposed to the current static maps, as we are well aware: Roads are constantly being updated and aggregated as new traces are introduced. The collected traces can then provide information for more efficient route planning as the traces are a useful and realistic source about road/trajectory usage, average speeds and user preferences on road alternatives. Besides providing a dynamic map of the world, YouTrace can also be a useful source of information about users mobility and city dynamics. This information can be extremely valuable to urban planners, as they can base their planning decisions on more realistic information (as opposed to surveys or probabilistic reasoning). YouTrace users can access the system through a web portal that will be responsible for feeding the Map Generation Engine with traces, which in turn, will be added to the map.|$|E
40|$|The {{gradually}} {{growing demand}} for experimentation of protocols designed for wireless networks in real environments {{has resulted in the}} development of experimental network facilities (testbeds). Most currently deployed testbeds have been designed so as to offer services to experimenters that lie within the testbed's premises, thus limiting the accessibility to external users. The requirement for multi-user access of network resources has led several large-scale testbeds to provide remote access services to certified experimenters. However, management and maintenance of large-scale remotely accessible testbeds is a rather challenging task that requires proper hardware, as well as software custom-built tools. In order to provide for remote switching of testbed nodes, NITOS has developed a new chassis manager (CM) card and also a custom framework that allows for monitoring and controlling of the nodes' operational mode. In addition, NITOS CM card provides for gathering of various types of sensor measurements, through the attached temperature, humidity and light intensity sensor modules. Another <b>innovative</b> <b>characteristic</b> of the proposed card is that it provides the experimenters with the ability to monitor the energy consumption of each testbed node, which is rather important for experimentation with power optimization schemes.

30|$|Teachers of {{secondary}} vocational educational institutions (VET) in four {{cities in the}} Netherlands are cooperating in developing a curriculum for at-risk students. The schools {{are part of a}} project called “Playing for Success 15 – 23 ”, which was launched as an early school leaver (ESL)-programme for secondary vocational students aged 15 – 23 and inspired by the British “Playing for Success” concept (Sharp et al. 2007). The <b>innovative</b> <b>characteristic</b> of this curriculum is the cooperation with professional sports organizations, such as a professional soccer club. In this program, at-risk students are assigned to a 8 – 10  week curriculum enacted in a professional environment such as a soccer stadium or top sports arena. The goal of this cooperation is to motivate at-risk students and engage them in learning {{and on the other hand}} to develop learning opportunities especially tailored to the educational needs of these students. The aim of this study is to examine whether dropout prevention, now typically located in a regular ‘bricks and mortar’ school environment, can be extended to a soccer stadium or top sports arena and to examine whether a professional, appealing environment with well-known sportspeople and a curriculum with many “binding” learning experiences reinforces the success of the ESL-programme.” We assume that teacher impact really matters (Hattie 2003; Timperley and Alton-Lee 2008) and therefore we focus on teachers’ views on effective dropout prevention and teachers’ pedagogical-didactical strategies for creating positive and motivating learning experiences for at-risk students.|$|E
