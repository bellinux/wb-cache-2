The <b>facility</b> <b>has</b> seen a large increase in smaller customers after 2004, when the Svalbard Undersea Cable System started providing a fiber Internet connection. Concessions for downloading are only issued to civilian satellites, yet some data has been indirectly used by armed forces. There is a disagreement as to whether this constitutes a breach of the Svalbard Treaty.|$|E

Geological disposal has been studied since 1985, and a permanent deep geological repository was required by law in 2003. Sites in Gansu Province near the Gobi desert in northwestern China are under investigation, with a final site expected to be selected by 2020, and actual disposal by about 2050.|$|E
5|$|Located at the {{junction}} of Sungei Road and Pitt Road, was the former site of the Singapore Ice Works that {{was built in the}} 1930s. The factory was the first ice-making plant in Singapore using large compressors manufactured mainly from Carrier and York corporations. It was popular as a pioneer establishment that brought refrigeration and air-conditioning to Singapore. In 1958, it was renamed as the New Singapore Ice Works. In later years, the factory was bought over by Cold Storage who ran it under their management. However, in 1984, the Housing Development Board (HDB) took over its site for redevelopment. The factory was soon demolished and the plant operations was re-located to Auric Pacific at Fishery Port Road. This <b>facility</b> <b>has</b> since closed down after being in use for over twenty years.|$|E

5|$|Svalbard Satellite Station {{was built}} because of Longyearbyen's {{excellent}} location to download data from satellites in polar orbit. Located at Platåberget above Hotellneset, {{it was built}} as a cooperation between NASA and the Norwegian Space Centre, but has since 2001 been operated by Kongsberg Satellite Services. EISCAT operates an incoherent scatter radar to study the northern lights. The Svalbard Global Seed Vault, administered by the Global Crop Diversity Trust, is a secure underground facility capable of storing millions of crop seeds. The <b>facility</b> <b>has</b> been designed to protect against natural and human disasters, including global warming, floods and fires and nuclear holocaust. The site was chosen {{for a number of}} factors including its remoteness, sound geology and the ambient temperature of the permafrost.|$|E

5|$|Alma is {{nonetheless}} freed when her storage chamber is opened by ATC researcher {{and leader of}} Project Origin, Harlan Wade (Grant Goodeve), who felt guilty over the company's treatment of Alma and who was actually her father. The player is then called to sabotage the structure's reactor, running a gauntlet against Alma's ghosts before the whole location explodes. In {{the aftermath of the}} detonation, a Delta Force Black Hawk helicopter extracts the Point Man from the rubble, rescuing him. While the player and the survivors of the F.E.A.R. team survey the results of the explosion from the helicopter, Jin wonders what happened to Alma. Just then, the helicopter loses power, and Alma is seen pulling herself up into the cabin: the destruction of the Origin <b>facility</b> <b>has</b> not stopped her quest to get closer to her son.|$|E
