50|$|In non-diesel {{internal}} combustion engines, {{gasoline direct injection}} (GDI), also known as petrol direct injection, <b>direct</b> <b>petrol</b> <b>injection,</b> spark-ignited direct injection (SIDI) and fuel-stratified injection (FSI), is a variant of fuel injection employed in modern two-stroke and four-stroke gasoline engines. The gasoline is highly pressurized, and injected via a common rail fuel line directly into the combustion chamber of each cylinder, as opposed to conventional multipoint fuel injection that injects fuel into the intake tract or cylinder port. Directly injecting fuel into the combustion chamber requires high-pressure injection, whereas low pressure is used injecting into the intake tract or cylinder port.|$|E

40|$|The Light Duty Inter-Laboratory Correlation Exercise has {{conducted}} testing at 9 test laboratories in the EU, Korea and Japan {{in order to}} demonstrate the practicality, robustness, repeatability and reproducibility of the particle emissions measurement techniques proposed by the Particle Measurement Programme (PMP).

A DPF equipped Peugeot 407 was tested at all participating laboratories to allow the inter-laboratory reproducibility of measurements to be assessed.

5000|$|The Golf Mk5 GT {{features}} {{a choice of}} either 1.4 L petrol engine in twincharger (TSI) configuration, or a 2.0 litre TDI diesel engine.plus a 2.0 (fsi) <b>direct</b> <b>injection</b> <b>petrol</b> engine has 150 bhp. TSI petrol and diesels are available as [...] versions. The 125kW diesel engine has 350 N·m (258 ft·lbf) of torque, {{which is more than}} the range topping R32. The petrol engined offering contains the new TSI engine, which is based on the recent Fuel Stratified Injection (FSI), but with a pair of chargers forcing the induction of the air. The chargers are a single supercharger that disengages after a specified rev-range, at which point charging of the air is handled by a single turbocharger. This system benefits from both of the efficiency of the supercharger in the lower rev ranges, with the longevity of the turbocharger higher in the rev range. This results in little turbo lag, constant power delivery along the rev range, and better fuel efficiency than similarly powered 2.4 L V6 engine due to its small size. However, the power delivery of the petrol TSI engine was criticised as being very jerky by Jeremy Clarkson.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: SI {{engines are}} highly {{susceptible}} to excess emissions when started at low ambient temperatures. This phenomenon has multiple air quality and climate forcing implications. <b>Direct</b> <b>injection</b> <b>petrol</b> engines feature a markedly different fuelling strategy, and so their emissions behaviour is somewhat different from indirect <b>injection</b> <b>petrol</b> engines. The excess emissions of direct injection engines at low ambient temperatures should also differ. Additionally, the direct injection fuel delivery process {{leads to the}} formation of PM, and DISI engines should show greater PM emissions at low ambient temperatures. This study reports on laboratory experiments quantifying excess emissions of gaseous and solid pollutants over a legislative driving cycle following cold start at a low ambient temperature for both engine types. Over the legislative cycle for testing at- 7 °C (the UDC), emissions of HC, CO, NOx and CO 2 were higher when tested at- 7 °C than at 24 °C. Massive increases in emissions of HC and CO were observed, together with more modest increases in NOx and CO 2 emissions. Results from the entire driving cycle showed excess emissions in both phases (though they were much larger for the UDC). The DISI vehicle showed lower increases in fuel consumption than the port injected vehicles, but greater increases in emission of HC and CO. DISI particle number emissions increased by around 50 %; DISI particle mass by over 600 %. The observed emissions deteriorations varied somewhat by engine type and from vehicle to vehicle. Excesses were greatest following start-up, but persisted, even after several hundred seconds...|$|R

50|$|In most petrol engines, {{the fuel}} and air are usually {{pre-mixed}} before compression (although some modern petrol engines now use cylinder-direct <b>petrol</b> <b>injection).</b> The pre-mixing was formerly {{done in a}} carburetor, {{but now it is}} done by electronically controlled fuel injection, except in small engines where the cost/complication of electronics does not justify the added engine efficiency. The process differs from a diesel engine in the method of mixing the fuel and air, and in using spark plugs to initiate the combustion process.
