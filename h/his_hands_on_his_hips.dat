5|$|Yardley {{continued}} {{to employ a}} leg side field as he and Barnett bowled outside leg stump. During one over, Bradman did not attempt a single shot and then put <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>hips</b> to express his displeasure at England's tactics. During the 15 minutes before tea, the Australian captain did not add a single run and was heckled by the crowd. Bradman reached tea on 78, and 55 minutes after the resumption of play, he cover drove Bedser to reach his century in 218 minutes. It was his 28th Test century, and his 18th in Ashes Tests. The last 29 runs took 70 minutes to accumulate, {{and it was one}} of Bradman's slower innings as Yardley focused on stopping runs rather than taking wickets. Nevertheless, Bradman had appeared comfortable after the early stages of his innings, and patiently scored most of his runs between mid-off and mid-on, often from the back foot. After Bradman had reached his milestone, many of the spectators began to leave the ground, content with what they had seen.|$|E

During one over, Bradman did not attempt a single shot and then put <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>hips.</b> During the 15 minutes before the tea break, Bradman did not add a single run and was heckled by the crowd for his lack of scoring. The Australian captain reached the tea break on 78; 55 minutes after the resumption of play he played a cover drive against Bedser to reach his century in 218 minutes. It was his 28th Test century, and his 18th in Ashes Tests; the last 29 runs took 70 minutes. It {{was one of his}} slower innings as Yardley focused on stopping runs rather than taking wickets.

After the Australian captain had reached his milestone, many of the spectators began to leave the ground, content with what they had seen. Bradman added a further 30 in the last hour to end with 130. Australia batted to stumps on the second day without further loss, ending at 4/293, a lead of 128.|$|E
500|$|Australia {{had been}} scoring slowly, {{as they would}} {{throughout}} the day, [...] and following Hassett's entrance, the Australians slowed further as Bradman changed the team strategy to one of attempting to bat only once. Hassett almost holed out early when he knocked a ball from Alec Bedser {{up in the air}} and it just evaded the grasp of wicket-keeper Godfrey Evans. Yardley continued to employ leg theory, as he and Charlie Barnett bowled outside leg stump; this tactic stifled the Australian scoring but also limited wicket-taking opportunities. During one over, Bradman did not attempt to hit a single ball and put <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>hips</b> to express his displeasure at England’s tactics. During the 15 minutes before tea, the Australian skipper did not add a single run and was heckled by the crowd. In the last session, Bradman brought up one of his slowest ever centuries, as Yardley focused on stopping runs rather than taking Australian wickets. Bradman reached stumps on 130. Hassett also batted patiently, with one period of 20 minutes during which his score remained on 30. Australia closed the second day at 4/293 to lead by 128, with Hassett on 41, having combined for an unbroken stand of 108 with Bradman.|$|E

2500|$|Plant enjoyed {{great success}} with Led Zeppelin {{throughout}} the 1970s {{and developed a}} compelling image as the charismatic rock-and-roll front man, similar to his contemporaries, the Who singer Roger Daltrey, Mick Jagger of the Rolling Stones and Jim Morrison of the Doors. With his mane of long blond hair and powerful, bare-chested appearance, Plant helped to create the [...] "god of rock and roll" [...] or [...] "rock god" [...] archetype. On stage, Plant was particularly active in live performances, often dancing, jumping, skipping, snapping his fingers, clapping, making emphatic gestures to emphasise a lyric or cymbal crash, throwing back his head, or placing <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>hips.</b> As the 1970s progressed he, {{along with the other}} members of Led Zeppelin, became increasingly flamboyant on-stage, and wore more elaborate, colourful clothing and jewellery.|$|E
2500|$|Muralitharan had bowled two overs {{before lunch}} from umpire Steve Dunne's or the Members' End {{of the ground}} with umpire Hair at square leg and these passed without incident. At [...] he took up the attack from umpire Hair's or the {{southern}} end. Muralitharan's third over was a maiden with all deliveries again passed as legitimate but in his fourth Hair no-balled him twice for throwing on the fourth and sixth balls. The umpire continued to call him three times in his fifth over on the second, fourth and sixth balls. While the bowler stood with <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>hips</b> perplexed, the five calls provoked an immediate response by the Sri Lankan captain Arjuna Ranatunga who left the field at [...] {{in order to take}} advice from his team management. He returned at [...] and continued with Muralitharan who was called two more times in his sixth over on the second and sixth balls. At [...] Ranatunga removed the bowler from the attack, although he reintroduced him at [...] at umpire Dunne's end. Although Hair reports in his book, [...] "Decision Maker", {{that at the end of}} the tea break he stated that he would call Muralitharan no matter which end he bowled he did not do so. Muralitharan completed another twelve overs without further no-balls and, after bowling Mark Waugh, finished the day with figures of 18–3–58–1.|$|E
