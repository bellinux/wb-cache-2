40|$|The {{objective}} of the paper is to explain a modern Hilbert transform method for analysis and identification of mechanical non-linear vibration structures {{in the case of}} quasiperiodic signals. This special kind of periodicity arises in experimental vibration signals. The method is based on the Hilbert transform of input and output signals in a time domain to extract the instantaneous dynamic structure characteristics. The paper focuses on the dynamic analysis and identification of three groups of dynamics systems: o <b>Forced</b> <b>vibrations</b> of linear and non-linear SDOF systems excited with quasiperiodic force signal. o Combined <b>forced</b> <b>vibrations</b> of quasiperiodic time varying linear and non-linear SDOF systems excited with harmonic signal. o Combined self-excited and <b>forced</b> <b>vibrations</b> of non-linear SDOF systems excited with harmonic signal. The study focuses on signal processing techniques for nonlinear system investigation, which enable us to estimate instantaneous system dynamic parameters (natural frequencies, damping characteristics and their dependencies on a vibration amplitude and frequency) for different kinds of system excitation...|$|R

5000|$|When {{a single}} vortex is shed, an {{asymmetrical}} flow pattern forms {{around the body}} and changes the pressure distribution. This means that the alternate shedding of vortices can create periodic lateral (sideways) forces on the body in question, causing it to vibrate. If the vortex shedding frequency {{is similar to the}} natural frequency of a body or structure, it causes resonance.

50|$|Ambient {{vibrations}} were however supplanted - {{at least}} for some time - by <b>forced</b> <b>vibration</b> techniques that allow to increase the amplitudes and control the shaking source and their system identification methods. Even though M. Trifunac showed in 1972 that ambient and forced vibrations led to the same results, the interest in ambient vibration techniques only rose in the late 1990s. They have now become quite attractive, due to their relatively low cost and convenience, and to the recent improvements in recording equipment and computation methods.
