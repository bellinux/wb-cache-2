50|$|For {{reflecting}} telescopes, {{which use}} a curved mirror {{in place of}} the objective lens, theory preceded practice. The theoretical basis for curved mirrors behaving similar to lenses was probably established by Alhazen, whose theories had been widely disseminated in Latin translations of his work. Soon after the invention of the refracting telescope Galileo, Giovanni Francesco Sagredo, and others, spurred on by their knowledge that curved mirrors had similar properties as lenses, discussed the idea of building a telescope using a mirror as the image forming objective. The potential advantages of using parabolic mirrors (primarily a reduction of spherical aberration with elimination of chromatic aberration) led to several proposed designs for reflecting telescopes, the most notable of which was published in 1663 by James Gregory and came to be called the Gregorian telescope, but no working models were built. Isaac Newton has been generally credited with constructing the first practical reflecting telescopes, the Newtonian telescope, in 1668 although due to their difficulty of construction and the poor performance of the speculum metal mirrors used it took over 100 years for reflectors to become popular.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this article is to present the first imaging {{experiments}} to demonstrate the functional equivalence between a conventional rotational gantry and a fixed-beam imaging geometry, and the feasibility of an iterative image-reconstruction technique under <b>gravitational</b> <b>deformation.</b> Methods and materials: Experiments were performed using an Elekta Axesse with Agility MLC and XVI, a custom-built rotating phantom stage, a Catphan QA phantom, and a porcine heart. For the imaging equivalence, a conventional cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) of the Catphan was acquired, as well as a set of 660 x-ray projections with a static gantry and rotating Catphan. Both datasets were reconstructed with the Feldkamp-Davis-Kress (FDK) algorithm, and the resultant volumetric images were compared using standard metrics. For imaging under <b>gravitational</b> <b>deformation,</b> a conventional CBCT of the Catphan and a set of 660 x-ray projections with a static gantry and rotating Catphan were also acquired with a porcine heart. The conventional CBCT was reconstructed using FDK. The projections that were acquired with the heart rotating were sorted into angular bins and reconstructed with prior image constrained compressed sensing using a deformation-blurred FDK prior. Deformation was quantified with B-spline transformation-based deformable image registration. Results: For imaging equivalence, the difference between the two Catphan images was consistent with Poisson noise. For imaging under <b>gravitational</b> <b>deformation,</b> the conventional CBCT porcine heart image (ground truth at 0 degrees) matched the static gantry, rotating heart reconstruction with a mean magnitude of < 3 mm and maximum magnitude of < 5 mm of the deformation vector field. The mean deformation of the rotating heart was 3. 0 to 8. 9 mm, up to 16. 1 mm maximum deformation. Deformation was mainly observed in the direction of gravity. Conclusions: We have demonstrated imaging equivalence in cone beam CT reconstructions between rigid phantom images acquired with a conventional rotating gantry and with a fixed-gantry and rotating phantom.

The north-south, half-dome shaped Maiella anticline lies in the easternmost part of the Apennine fold-and-thrust belt. Its backlimb is bordered by the Caramanico Fault, a normal fault with a maximum downthrown of about 3. 5 km that separates the western slope of the Maiella Massif from the Caramanico Valley. The southwestern Maiella area is affected by deep-seated <b>gravitational</b> slope <b>deformation</b> indicated by major double crest lines, down-hill and up-hill facing scarps, a pattern of crossing trenches, bulging at the base of slopes and the presence of different types of landslide and talus slope deposits.

40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{development}} of a large-scale <b>gravitational</b> <b>deformation</b> involving the eastern lateral moraine of the Athabasca Glacier in Jasper National Park, Alberta, Canada, is described. Interpretation and analysis of sequential aerial photographs indicates that a 540 -m-wide segment of the eastern lateral moraine began to deform in the early 1950 s; however, significant movement only began in the late 1960 s. Since then, the moraine has undergone progressive <b>gravitational</b> <b>deformation</b> leading to a network of fractures, bulging, and {{the development of}} a large gap in the moraine crest. Geographic information system analysis of topographic changes between 1967 and 2006 indicates that the displaced volume of the moraine is approximately 9. 0 × 10 5 m 3. In the last 39 years, the moraine crest has displaced 55 m (1. 4 m yr - 1) down towards the glacier. The development of slope instability is linked to a combination of debuttressing from recent glacier recession, deformation of the moraine, as well as the movement of a large, mobile, debris-mantled slope impinging the upslope margin of the lateral moraine. This case study illustrates the importance of glacial conditioning and local geomorphological factors in creating conditions for large-scale moraine instability in recently deglacierized alpine basins...|$|E

We performed detailed structural field mapping, annual differential Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) surveys, and generated a detailed topographic model based on airborne and terrestrial laser scanning. Kinematic analyses of the structural data indicates that deformation is complex and varies over the slope. Both sliding and toppling are locally feasible.

The plant occupies a carbon-atic slope that is extensively involved in <b>gravitational</b> <b>deformations,</b> which are responsible for underground failures such as cracks and collapses of karst caves. To distinguish among different types of recorded events, an automated procedure was implemented taking into account duration, peak of ground acceleration (PGA) and its variation within the accelerometric array. The main sequence of underground failures so far recorded was related to the L'Aquila seismic sequence occurred in April 2009. Moreover, a very intense sequence of underground failures occurred in September 2011 that was not related to seismic events, i. e. only due to the gravitational processes affecting the slope. These evidences prove that the ongoing <b>gravitational</b> slope <b>deformations</b> have a key role in predisposing and/or causing the underground failures within the karst rock mass of the Peschiera Spring slope. A control index (CI) is daily computed as a function of sub-indexes which are derived from the rate of cumulative Arias intensity of underground failures, the frequency of underground failures and the frequency of earthquakes.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to analyze, evaluate and improve the current pointing performance of AUT’s 30 -metre radio telescope. The telescope currently uses the "fivept" pointing procedure of the NASA Field System (used for scheduling and operation of the 30 -metre) to collect pointing offsets. “pdplt”, another pro- gram in the Field System, is used to process, generate and apply a pointing model to correct for errors in pointing. The Field System pointing model allows up to 30 terms to account for various pointing errors, of which 8 terms are currently being used. Previous research had identified a sinusoidal pattern in the residual pointing offsets that significantly reduces pointing accuracy [1]. We develop an alternative pointing methodology that significantly improves the pointing accuracy by (a) applying a source selection method, (b) applying an outlier removal procedure and (c) using additional terms to remove the sinusoidal pattern. The “fivept” pointing procedure is used to build the pointing database. A script written in Bash is used to preprocess the offsets and the R programming language is used to process, analyze and evaluate new pointing models. Three new terms are added to the existing model that effectively suppress the sinusoidal pattern. The end result improves the pointing accuracy significantly, with the RF axis being able to point within an error ellipse that is smaller than 10 % of the FWHM. We speculate about possible reasons for the origin of the sinusoidal pattern of the pointing offsets.
