But I <b>do</b> <b>remember</b> hearing them. I remember the weird cadence of their song in the dark distance; I remember the brittle sound of the camel's hooves crushing the frozen snow; and I remember the mysterious tinkling of their silver bridles.|$|E

[...] "I came around to liking Phil Ochs' music, guitar included," [...] Christgau wrote. [...] "My affection [...] no doubt prejudiced me, so it is worth [...] that many observers who care more for folk music than I <b>do</b> <b>remember</b> both his compositions and his vibrato tenor {{as close to the}} peak of the genre." ...|$|E
500|$|As I was {{reporting}} to the Triton, I remember saying, [...] "This ship is an unusual one. We've {{got to do something}} special with it. What could it be?" [...] We talked about it a little bit, and nobody had any ideas. Finally, I got an idea. We'll do a stunt. We'll go around the world from North Pole to South Pole. That was my brainstorm. If {{you take a look at}} a map of the world, you'll see that's not a very easy way to go. [...] So we didn't do that. But I <b>do</b> <b>remember</b> thinking of it. And I made a speech to the crew, advising them of my thinking—that we were going to put this ship on the map. Well, that died out. Suddenly ... a phone call came, asking me if I could be in Washington tomorrow.|$|E
500|$|Al Jean, showrunner since season thirteen, {{has also}} {{been the subject of}} criticism, with some arguing that the show has {{continued}} to decline in quality under his tenure. Former writers have complained that under Jean, the show is [...] "on auto-pilot", [...] "too sentimental", and the episodes are [...] "just being cranked out." [...] Some critics believe that the show has [...] "entered a steady decline under Jean and is no longer really funny." [...] John Ortved, author of , characterized the Jean era as [...] "toothless", and criticized what he perceived as the show's increase in social and political commentary. Jean responded: [...] "Well, it's possible that we've declined. But honestly, I've been here the whole time and I <b>do</b> <b>remember</b> in season two people saying, 'It's gone downhill.' If we'd listened to that then we would have stopped after episode 13. I'm glad we didn't." ...|$|E

500|$|As a child, Stephen {{was often}} sickly and afflicted by {{constant}} colds. [...] When {{the boy was}} almost two, his father wrote in his diary that his youngest son became [...] "so sick that we are anxious about him." [...] Despite his fragile nature, Crane was an intelligent child who taught himself to read {{before the age of}} four. His first known inquiry, recorded by his father, dealt with writing; at the age of three, while imitating his brother Townley's writing, he asked his mother, [...] "how do you spell O?" [...] In December 1879, Crane wrote a poem about wanting a dog for Christmas. Entitled [...] "I'd Rather Have –", it is his first surviving poem. Stephen was not regularly enrolled in school until January 1880, but he had no difficulty in completing two grades in six weeks. Recalling this feat, he wrote that it [...] "sounds like the lie of a fond mother at a teaparty, but I <b>do</b> <b>remember</b> that I got ahead very fast and that father was very pleased with me." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} day, Erdrick {{arrived at}} Tantegel Castle {{to speak with}} King Lorik and offered his help to defeat the Dragonlord. After searching the land for clues to the Dragonlord's whereabouts, Erdrick found that the Dragonlord lived on an island that could be accessed only via a magical bridge that only a [...] "Rainbow Drop" [...] could generate. After venturing to the island, Erdrick was never heard from again. Many years later, during King LorikXVI's reign, the Dragonlord attacked the kingdom again and captured Princess Gwaelin. Many heroes tried to rescue the princess and recover the Ball of Light from the Dragonlord's castle, called Charlock, but none succeeded. The prophet Mahetta predicted that [...] "One day, a descendant of the valiant Erdrick shall come forth to defeat the Dragonlord." [...] However, when the descendant (the game's hero) arrives, {{many of the people}} of Alefgard have forgotten the story of Erdrick, and those few who <b>do</b> <b>remember</b> consider it a myth and do not believe in Mahetta's prophecy. King Lorik starts to mourn the decline of his kingdom.|$|E
500|$|Jean {{continued}} as showrunner after the movie. Critics {{have argued that}} the quality of the show has declined in Jean's tenure. Jacob Burch, an administrator of the website NoHomers.com, {{said in an interview that}} the show [...] "seems less cohesive, more about trying to get the jokes in there, instead of make a story and let the jokes come off of that" [...] and adds [...] "I just think there's only so much you can do [...]" [...] Steven Hyden of The A.V. Club argues in an online debate over this issue that [...] "The Simpsons has come to rely too much on wacky Homer shtick and tired, meaningless guest stars" [...] and that the writers are [...] "content to amuse themselves with in-jokes, non sequiturs, and self-consciously silly plot twists." [...] Jean responded to this criticism by saying: [...] "Well, it's possible that we've declined. But honestly, I've been here the whole time and I <b>do</b> <b>remember</b> in season two people saying, 'It's gone downhill.' If we'd listened to that then we would have stopped after episode 13. I'm glad we didn't." ...|$|E

He saw it fall upon the {{trembling}} hands, and heard the one prolonged low cry go upward.|$|R

500|$|... "Da Art of Storytellin' (Part 1)" [...] {{tells the}} story of a self-destructive {{childhood}} friend named Sasha Thumper who dies of a drug overdose. Commenting on the song's lyrical content, author Mickey Hess remarks that André 3000 [...] "manages to walk the fine line between emotionalism and masculinity by articulating this highly emotional narrative with an almost emotionless tone." [...] The next track, [...] "Da Art of Storytellin' (Part 2)", is an apocalyptic song that represents the group's vision of [...] "the last song recorded in the world", with André 3000 commenting, [...] "I <b>do</b> <b>remember</b> thinking, 'What if it was the end of the world and we had to get to the Dungeon on some X-Men superhero shit. I think I was vibing on some end-of-the-world, last-recorded-song shit'". Following is [...] "Mamacita", which features Dungeon Crew rapper Madasa in a meditation on male-female relationships, inspired by an ex-girlfriend of André 3000 who began pursuing women after their breakup. [...] "SpottieOttieDopaliscious" [...] relates a story of ill-fated romance, with André 3000 describing the infatuation during an encounter with a woman at a club and Big Boi noting the hopelessness of the relationship as the song progresses.|$|E
500|$|Throughout {{the course}} of the show, Val was often played up as the good girl character. When asked about whether Val was a weak character, Van Ark said: [...] "God, no. No she wasn’t. For the very reason that she went through so much and landed on both feet. She was strong in a {{realistic}} kind of way. I <b>do</b> <b>remember</b> that TV Guide did a quote that the three of us can be compared to Earth, Wind and Fire. Michele was the Earth, I was the Wind and Donna was the Fire. I think that really captured it." [...] Van Ark was later asked about who she saw Val as today. She said, [...] "Of course the dysfunctional elements would come out. Why even bother otherwise? But of course they would persevere and still be together after all. I think Valene was headed to, and my sister’s like this, after years of doing everything for her husband and her children, Valene was going to further her achievements in the professional world. I think if you saw Valene today she’d be much more accomplished as a writer and would be very successful overall." [...] The actress also said: ...|$|E
500|$|... "Little Things" [...] {{was written}} by British singer-songwriters Ed Sheeran and Fiona Bevan, and {{produced}} by Jake Gosling. In February 2012, One Direction expressed interest in working with Sheeran for their second studio album. In June 2012, Sheeran disclosed that One Direction would be recording two of his songs. In October 2012, Sheeran acknowledged Bevan's songwriting credit {{in an interview with}} British radio network Capital FM: [...] "The great thing about it is I wrote that song with a girl called Fiona Bevan when I was 17 and we lost the song. I've kept in touch with Fiona, we've done gigs and stuff and about two months ago she sent me the tune and was like, 'Oh, do you remember this?' I was like, 'Yeah, I <b>do</b> <b>remember</b> that', and I was in the studio with the One Direction boys at the time and I was playing it and they were like, 'We really like that'. It's got one of my favourite lines that I've ever written in a song." [...] On 15 October 2012, Louis Tomlinson confirmed via social networking website Twitter that [...] "Little Things" [...] would serve as the second single of their second studio album Take Me Home.|$|E

500|$|Jean {{returned}} full-time to The Simpsons {{during the}} tenth season (1998). He once again became show runner with {{the start of}} the thirteenth season in 2001, this time without Reiss. Jean called it [...] "a great job with a lot of responsibility," [...] and cited [...] "the fact that people love it so much" [...] as [...] "great." [...] He adds, however, that [...] "the hardest thing at this point is just thinking of fresh ideas. People are so on top of things that we've done before, so the challenge now is to think of an idea that's good, but hasn't been seen." [...] Jean's return was initially welcomed, with MSNBC's Jon Bonné stating: [...] "Jean, who took the show's helm from executive producer Mike Scully in 2001, has guided the show away from its gag-heavy, Homer-centric incarnation...these are certainly brighter days for the show's long-time fans." [...] However, some critics have argued that the quality of the show has declined in recent years during Jean's tenure. Jean has responded to this criticism by saying: [...] "Well, it's possible that we've declined. But honestly, I've been here the whole time and I <b>do</b> <b>remember</b> in season two people saying, 'It's gone downhill.' If we'd listened to that then we would have stopped after episode 13.

While he dictated the Sefer HaNisraf to Reb Noson, the latter said that he did not understand it at all; later he said, [...] "What I <b>do</b> <b>remember</b> is that it spoke about the greatness of the mitzvah of hospitality and preparing the bed for a guest". Rebbe Nachman never showed the Sefer HaGanuz to anyone. In 1808 Rebbe Nachman burned all the copies of the Sefer HaGanuz and the Sefer Ha-nisraf.|$|E
