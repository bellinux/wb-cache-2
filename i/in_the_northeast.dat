5|$|Starting in 1997, Greyhound {{had faced}} {{significant}} competition <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>northeast</b> from Chinatown bus lines. By 2003, more than 250 buses, operated by competitors like Fung Wah and Lucky Star Bus were competing fiercely from curbsides in the Chinatowns of New York City, Boston, Philadelphia, and Washington, D.C. When operating on inter-city routes, the Chinatown buses offered prices about 50% less than Greyhound's. Between 1997 and 2007, Chinatown buses took 60% of Greyhound's market share <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>northeast</b> United States.|$|E

5|$|Church growth <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Northeast</b> {{was also}} {{accompanied}} by revivalism. While calmer and more reserved {{than those in}} the South, the revivals of the Second Great Awakening transformed religion <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Northeast,</b> and they were often led by Presbyterians and Congregationalists. The Plan of Union led to the spread of New England theology (also known as the New Divinity and New Haven theology), originally conceived by Congregationalists. The New England theology modified and softened traditional Calvinism, rejecting the doctrine of imputation of Adam's sin, adopting the governmental theory of atonement, and embracing a greater emphasis on free will. It was essentially an attempt to construct a Calvinism conducive to revivalism. While the Synod of Philadelphia condemned the New Divinity as heretical in 1816, the General Assembly disagreed, concluding that New England theology did not conflict with the Westminster Confession.|$|E
