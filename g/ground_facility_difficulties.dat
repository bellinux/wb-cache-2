40|$|Experimental {{testing is}} an {{important}} aspect of validating complex integrated safety critical aircraft technologies. The Airborne Subscale Transport Aircraft Research (AirSTAR) Testbed is being developed at NASA Langley to validate technologies under conditions that cannot be flight validated with full-scale vehicles. The AirSTAR capability comprises a series of flying sub-scale models, associated ground-support equipment, and a base research station at NASA Langley. The subscale model capability utilizes a generic 5. 5 % scaled transport class vehicle known as the Generic Transport Model (GTM). The AirSTAR <b>Ground</b> <b>Facilities</b> encompass the hardware and software infrastructure necessary to provide comprehensive support services for the GTM testbed. The <b>ground</b> <b>facilities</b> support remote piloting of the GTM aircraft, and include all subsystems required for data/video telemetry, experimental flight control algorithm implementation and evaluation, GTM simulation, data recording/archiving, and audio communications. The <b>ground</b> <b>facilities</b> include a self-contained, motorized vehicle serving as a mobile research command/operations center, capable of deployment to remote sites when conducting GTM flight experiments. The <b>ground</b> <b>facilities</b> also include a laboratory based at NASA LaRC providing near identical capabilities as the mobile command/operations center, as well as the capability to receive data/video/audio from, and send data/audio to the mobile command/operations center during GTM flight experiments...|$|R

50|$|Returning to Australia in 1952, Bradfield was {{appointed}} Director of Airports for the Department of Civil Aviation and {{was responsible for}} designing expansions of Essendon Airport in Melbourne as the second international airport in Australia. In 1957 {{he was promoted to}} Assistant Director-General (<b>ground</b> <b>Facilities),</b> and in 1964 became First Assistant Director-General (<b>Ground</b> <b>Facilities).</b> Faced with the growing challenges to airport infrastructure posed by the growth of the number and size of passenger jets entering service, requiring redesigns of runways and taxiways, and larger terminals. Bradfield was instrumental in the plans and designs for a new international airport for Melbourne at Tullamarine, which were formally unveiled in August 1965.|$|R

40|$|Besides space {{laboratories}} for in-orbit experimentation, Earth based {{facilities for}} laboratory experimentation are {{of paramount importance}} for the enhancement on liquid bridge knowledge. In spite of the constraints imposed by simulated microgravity (which force to work either with very small size liquid bridges or by using the Plateau tank technique, amongst other techniques), the availability and accessibility of Earth facilities can circumvent {{in many cases the}} drawbacks associated with simulated microgravity conditions. To support theoretical and in orbit experimental studies on liquid bridges under reduced gravity conditions, several <b>ground</b> <b>facilities</b> were developed at IDR. In the following these <b>ground</b> <b>facilities</b> are briefly described, and main results obtained by using them are cited...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of reentry space vehicles requires a precise qualification of their thermal protection system materials. The material catalytic properties should be determined for test conditions {{relevant to the}} real flight mission program. However, perfect reproduction of the flight environment in a <b>ground</b> <b>facility</b> is practically impossible for reacting flows and one is obliged to resort to a partial simulation. In an attempt to overcome such an issue, we present a methodology that allows establishing under which hypothesis and approximations the flowfield inside a <b>ground</b> <b>facility</b> is equivalent, regarding the heat flux load, to the real flowfield experienced by a space vehicle. The analytical results of the theory are compared with numerical predictions and agree favorably with them...|$|R
