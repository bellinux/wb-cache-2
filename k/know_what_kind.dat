5|$|I {{was just}} trying to make a point. I wanted to show people {{how easy it is to}} {{manipulate}} someone's voice. If I can do it with a clip I pulled off of TV, imagine what they are doing on records and during live performances. The entire industry has been so manipulated, because there's such an emphasis on perfection, so when something like this happens, it causes such a stir. I knew something had to have happened to make it jump so fast. It's wild how much the story's been twisted. It's just always been fun for me to manipulate artists, and make it sound crazy. It was just for a good laugh. It was a goof, just for fun. I do a lot of parodies on my YouTube channel, and it just so happens this one got a little out of hand. It was just what I've learned in school, and it's fun I could fool so many people and get away with it. A lot of people had a lot of laughs because of it, so why should I apologize? If you can't poke fun at yourself, I don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>kind</b> of person you are.|$|E
500|$|Iginla is {{well known}} for his kind-hearted nature. Former Flames General manager Craig Button {{described}} Iginla as being grounded: [...] "He doesn't carry himself with any attitude or arrogance. He's confident in his abilities. He's self-assured. He's genuine. He's a better person than he is a player, and we all <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>kind</b> of player he is." [...] In 2002, while in Salt Lake City for the Winter Olympic Games, Iginla struck up a conversation with four Calgarians sitting next to his table, and found out they were sleeping in their car outside of the hotel. He excused himself from the conversation, and booked them accommodations at his own expense at the hotel his family was staying in.|$|E
500|$|On May 29, 2008, Beghe {{attended}} {{a protest against}} the Church of Scientology held outside the Scientology building on East 46th Street in New York City. He addressed the 50 protesters gathered {{across the street from}} the Scientology building, and told them: [...] "What you guys are doing means so much to me, and so much to these people ... It just kills me. It makes me want to cry. You don’t <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>kind</b> of good you’re doing." [...] He then walked across the street in an attempt to enter the Scientology building, but was prevented from entering by three hired private security guards. He returned to the group of protesters and tried to phone the president of the Church of Scientology of New York, John Carmichael: [...] "I called and asked for John Carmichael and said I was Jason Beghe. Then they hung up." ...|$|E

500|$|Despite Travolta's earlier statements, {{plans for}} a sequel never came to fruition. According to James Robert Parish's Fiasco: A History of Hollywood's Iconic Flops, the {{disastrous}} performance of Battlefield Earth {{and the collapse of}} Franchise Pictures made it very unlikely that a live-action sequel will be made. In a 2001 interview, Travolta stated that a sequel was not planned: [...] "Ultimately the movie did $100million when you count box office, DVD sales, video, and pay per view… But I don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>kind</b> of number it would have to do to justify filming {{the second part of the}} book. And I don't want to push any buttons in the press and stir anybody up about it now." [...] Author Services announced in 2001 that Pine Com International, a Tokyo-based animation studio, would produce 13one-hour animated television segments based on the book and rendered in a manga style. The plans appear to have fallen through, and according to Parish, [...] "little has been heard of the series since." ...|$|E
500|$|In Moore's senior year, {{he led the}} Public League {{in scoring}} with 25.1points per game and was named Public League Most Valuable Player. He {{finished}} his career at South Philadelphia High with 1,186points. He was on the All-State Second Team and the Philadelphia Daily News named him to their All-City Team. In addition, Moore participated in the All-Star Labor Classic. Hoop Scoop named him the 166th {{best player in the}} Class of 2007. On January9,2007, Moore committed to Temple University over the University of Nebraska. He said that he originally wanted {{to move out of the}} city, but Nebraska was simply too far. Ultimately, his relationship with Temple coach Fran Dunphy, who began recruiting Moore at a summer Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) event, proved to be the deciding factor. Moore said that he [...] "not only <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>kind</b> of coach 's going to be, but he's going to help turn me into a man." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{conflicts}} between Welles and Ritt attracted media attention. Immediately after filming was completed, {{during an interview}} with Life, Welles explained {{that the cause of}} his behavior was that he did not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>kind</b> of [...] "monkeyshines" [...] his co-stars would be or the [...] "caprices" [...] they would receive from him. He also stated that they overcame the differences and completed the film. [...] Welles later wrote a letter to Ritt praising his work and apologizing for his interference during the making of the movie. Ritt replied, expounding his admiration for Welles. Despite the mutual apologies, during an interview in 1965, Ritt recalled an incident on the set. While the film was being shot, it was often stopped by bad weather. During a day suitable for shooting, he found Welles not ready for the scene, instead reading a newspaper in Spanish. Ritt decided to skip Welles' scene and shoot the next one. He attributed Welles' later cooperation to the incident, which Welles had found humiliating. [...] Ritt thus earned the nickname [...] "the Orson Tamer" [...] throughout the Hollywood community.|$|E

"Television {{was still}} so new that nobody really <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>kinds</b> of shows the {{audience}} would watch," [...] Burns wrote, [...] "but I figured {{that people would}} like the same things on television that they liked in vaudeville, so we did shows with pretty girls and animals." ...|$|R
500|$|This {{silence was}} an {{exception}} to the practice of oral history among black families. Minnie Lee Langley knew James and Emma Carrier as her parents. She kept the story from her children for 60 years: [...] "I didn't want them to know what I came through and I didn't discuss it with none of them... I just didn't want them to <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>kind</b> of way I come up. I didn't want them to know white folks want us out of our homes." [...] Decades passed before she began to trust white people. Some families spoke of Rosewood, but forbade the stories from being told: Arnett Doctor heard the story from his mother, Philomena Goins Doctor, who was with Sarah Carrier the day Fannie Taylor claimed she was assaulted, and was in the house with Sylvester Carrier. She told her children about Rosewood every Christmas. Doctor was consumed by his mother's story; he would bring it up to his aunts only to be dissuaded from speaking of it.|$|E
500|$|Joseph R. Atilano of Inquirer Entertainment praised [...] "Circles" [...] {{as one of}} the catchiest {{songs of}} the album and {{compared}} the track to songs by Rihanna and Nicki Minaj. Kitty Empire of The Observer commented that the [...] "sing-song verse is redolent of Rihanna". Montreal Gazette editor T'cha Dunlevy simply described it as [...] "a raunchy flip of the bird to haters". HitFix writer Melinda Newman called it a [...] "shape-shifting" [...] and compared Aguilera to Gwen Stefani [...] "as she adopts a patois". Annie Zaleschi of The A.V. Club was mixed, naming it a [...] "bitter '90s alt-rock crossed with M.I.A.'s antagonistic attitude; it should be an angry kiss-off. Instead, cringe-inducing lyrics sap its ire". For Michael Gallucci of PopCrush, the song [...] "dips back to the bubblegum pop of Aguilera's debut for the verses, but pumps a ton of distortion into her voice during the refrains. 'Circles' doesn't seem to <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>kind</b> of song it wants it to be, so it settles for two not very good ones".|$|E
500|$|Producer {{and writer}} Chip Johannessen {{felt that the}} scene in this episode in which a human hair is {{discovered}} with a message inscribed upon it was a [...] "perfect" [...] moment, in that it [...] "told you everything about this guy ... but {{you had no idea}} what he was or what he was going to do next ... you <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>kind</b> of crazy motherfucker would do that, but where he is or what he's going to do next, who knows". The episode's opening nightmare sequence, in which Jordan Black (Brittany Tiplady) is terrified by a clown crawling along the ceiling, was inspired by the childhood nightmares of Morgan and Wong, and left Tiplady suffering from bad dreams herself for several nights after filming. Producer John Peter Kousakis recalls having visited the episode's set late during production, having felt that make-up effects supervisor Toby Lindala had been doing [...] "fabulous" [...] work on the series' prosthetic body parts. Walking on set to find Lindala's recreation of a quartered corpse, Kousakis remarked [...] "we're doing something special here, but we're also doing something really outrageous". Lance Henriksen also found this scene too graphic to film all at once, taking time between shots to compose himself.|$|E

500|$|Fans of {{the show}} speculated that Dylan would be paired with Nick's ex-wife, Sharon Newman (Sharon Case), to which Case responded by stating, [...] "Everybody’s speculating about Dylan, the new {{character}} coming to town but, all I can say is, I think it’s fun because it’s a hoot to speculate". Luke Kerr of Zap2it noted how fast Dylan met Sharon, and said they could potentially be a [...] "popular pairing with fans". Of working with Case, Burton stated: [...] "Sharon Case is actually very fun, and she makes me laugh. So half the time in scenes where I am laughing, I am really laughing at Sharon! [...] She has that personality where she makes me laugh." [...] He also noted that fans {{of the show}} on Twitter have seen how [...] "comfortable" [...] and [...] "easy" [...] the character's on-screen relationship is. Dylan later shares a one-night stand with Chelsea Lawson (Melissa Claire Egan), who was pregnant with Adam Newman's (Michael Muhney) child; she decides to pass the baby off as Dylan's, and the two later marry. Egan described the character's decision to keep the child's paternity a secret as a [...] "ticking time bomb". Burton stated that Dylan is [...] "not the sharpest tool in the shed", since he believed what Chelsea was telling him. When asked about the child, Burton said: [...] "This kid is everything to him, so once we figure out whose it is, if it’s not his, it’s {{not going to be}} a good situation for anybody." [...] When asked if Dylan could forgive Chelsea, Burton added: [...] "That’s a tough one. I don’t <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>kind</b> of mental state this is going to put Dylan in, to even think about that." ...|$|E

Writing a 32-bit binary value to a memory location on a little-endian system and outputting the memory location (with growing addresses {{from left to right}}) shows that the order is reversed (byte-swapped) compared to usual big-endian notation. This is the way a hexdump is displayed: because the dumping program is unable to <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>kind</b> of data it is dumping, the only orientation it can observe is monotonically increasing addresses. The human reader, however, who knows {{that he or she is}} reading a hexdump of a little-endian system and who knows what kind of data he or she is reading, reads the byte sequence 0Dh,0Ch,0Bh,0Ah as the 32-bit binary value 168496141, or 0x0a0b0c0d in hexadecimal notation.
