40|$|Abstract: The {{demand for}} the {{development}} of underground spaces has been sharply increased in lieu of saturated ground spaces because the residents of cities have steadily increased since the 1980 s. The traditional widely used excavation methods (i. e., explosion and shield) have caused many problems, such as noise, vibration, extended schedule, and increased costs. The vibration-free (and explosion-free) excavation method has currently attracted attention in the construction site because of the advantage of definitively solving these issues. For such reason, a new excavation method that utilizes the expansion of vermiculite with relatively fewer defects is proposed in this study. In general, vermiculite materials are rapidly expanded in volume when they receive thermal energy. <b>Expansion</b> <b>pressure</b> can be produced by thermal expansion of vermiculite in a steel tube, and measured by laboratory tests. The experimental tests are performed with various influencing parameters in an effort to seek the optimal condition to effectively increase <b>expansion</b> <b>pressure</b> at the same temperature. Then, calibrated <b>expansion</b> <b>pressure</b> is estimated, and compared to each model. After analyzing test results for <b>expansion</b> <b>pressure,</b> it is verified that vermiculite expanded by heat can provide enough internal pressure to break hard rock during tunneling work...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. It is very {{important}} to determine the <b>expansion</b> <b>pressure</b> or residual contact pressure of tube-to-tubesheet joint. The <b>expansion</b> <b>pressure</b> and the residual contact pressure are affected by the geometry, material mechanical properties of the tube and tubesheet. In the basic theory of calculating the residual contact pressure of tube-to-tubesheet joints, the elastic-perfectly material is assumed. Because of the strain-hardening of the materials, linear strain-hardening or power strain-hardening were adopted in some analyzing models of the hydraulically expanded tube-to-tubesheet joint. In this paper, a general strain-hardening material model is adopted and an analytical model is proposed and validated by finite element analysis results. The elastic-perfectly model, linear strain-hardening model or power strain-hardening can be the special case of the present model...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{level of}} the contact {{pressure}} and the stresses induced during the hydraulically expanded tube–to-tubesheet process are the key factors for the integrity of a leak free expanded joint. The modelling {{of this type of}} joint requires an adequate representation of the material behavior in order to accurately evaluate important joint parameters such as the residual contact pressure and induced residual stresses. Maintaining a lower bound safe limit of the initial residual contact pressure over the lifetime of the expanded joint insures its durability. A design tool that addresses a proper material-geometry combination in conjunction with the required <b>expansion</b> <b>pressure</b> is developed. The proposed model is based on strain hardening material behavior of the tube and the tubesheet. The interaction of these two components is simulated during the whole process of the application of the <b>expansion</b> <b>pressure.</b> Particular emphasis is put on influence of reverse yielding and Bauschinger effect on the residual contact pressure. The results from the analytical model are confronted to those of the numerical FEA model.

40|$|During the {{installation}} of a pipe pile, the soil around the pile will be squeezed out. This paper deals with this squeezing effect of open-ended pipe piles using the cylindrical cavity expansion theory. The characteristics of soil with different tension and compression moduli and dilation are involved by applying the elastic theory with different moduli and logarithmic strain. The closed-form solutions of the radius of the plastic region, the displacement of {{the boundary between the}} plastic region and the elastic region and the <b>expansion</b> <b>pressure</b> on the external surface of the pipe piles are obtained. When obtaining these solutions, the soil plug in the open-ended pipe pile is considered by employing an incremental filling ratio to quantify the degree of soil plugging. Moreover, the effects of the ratio of tension and compression moduli, angle of dilation and incremental filling ratio on the radius of the plastic region and the <b>expansion</b> <b>pressure</b> on the external surface of the pipe pile are investigated. The parametric analyses show that it is necessary and important to consider the difference between the tension modulus and compression modulus, dilation angle and incremental filling ratio for studying the squeezing effect of open-ended pipe pile installation.
