5|$|Many of Portland's middle- and upper-class citizens, {{including}} Dow, believed drunkenness {{was a great}} {{threat to}} the city's moral and financial well-being. In 1827, he became {{a founding member of}} the Maine Temperance Society. The group initially focused its efforts on the evils of <b>distilled</b> <b>beverages,</b> but by 1829, Dow declared he would abstain from all alcoholic beverages. At the same time, he associated himself with anti-Masonic and anti-slavery causes, and became more involved with politics generally. In the 1832 presidential election, unsatisfied with both Andrew Jackson and Henry Clay, Dow backed William Wirt, a minor-party candidate.|$|E

25|$|Clear {{evidence}} of the distillation of alcohol comes from the Arab chemist Al-Kindi, in 9th-century Iraq. The process later spread to Italy, where it was described by the School of Salerno in the 12th century. Fractional distillation was developed by Tadeo Alderotti in the 13th century. A still was found in an archaeological site in Qinglong, Hebei province, in China, dating to the 12th century. <b>Distilled</b> <b>beverages</b> were common during the Yuan dynasty (13th–14th centuries).|$|E
25|$|By the 1730s {{the effects}} of alcohol abuse were {{damaging}} Shawnee communities. Rum as well as brandy and other <b>distilled</b> <b>beverages</b> had become important trade items and essential elements in diplomatic councils, treaty negotiations, and political transactions and had become part of Native American gift-giving rituals. The result was the erosion of civility, an increase in violence and widespread health problems. Alcohol made men less reliable hunters and allies, destabilized village economics and contributed to a rise in poverty.|$|E
25|$|Barley (Hordeum vulgare) {{a member}} of the grass family, is a major cereal grain grown in {{temperate}} climates globally.

Barley has been used as animal fodder, as a source of fermentable material for beer and certain <b>distilled</b> <b>beverages,</b> and as a component of various health foods.

500|$|The U.S. {{state of}} Oregon has an {{extensive}} history of laws regulating {{the sale and}} consumption of alcoholic beverages, dating back to 1844.

2500|$|Despite {{the looming}} PNL threat, Pogor, {{who had also}} been reelected {{chairman}} of the Iași appellate court, and N. Gane were absentee deputies, and were probably convinced that the Catargiu cabinet was about to crumble. Maiorescu, the acting Minister of Education and proponent of an unpopular education reform, was perplexed by their decision: [...] "Gane and Pogor should present themselves in Bucharest immediately ! Are we going to engage in politics or not? Is there any solidarity between those of you in Iași and me?" [...] Their effective abandon contributed to Maiorescu's resignation in January 1876, then to the arrival in power of a PNL ministry, surprisingly headed by the formerly ultra-"White" [...] Epureanu. The Junimists were soundly defeated in the subsequent elections of July 1876. Pogor managed to preserve his seat in the new legislature, which voted on Romanian independence during the War of '77. He was thus involved in parliamentary discussions about the thorny issue of antisemitic discrimination favored by the PNL: in early 1878, {{he was one of}} the few deputies who questioned the law preventing Romanian Jews from trading in <b>distilled</b> <b>beverages.</b>|$|E

50|$|<b>Distilled</b> <b>beverages</b> {{generally}} have an alcohol concentration higher than 30%. Beer and wine, {{which are not}} <b>distilled</b> <b>beverages,</b> are limited to a maximum alcohol content of about 20% ABV, as most yeasts cannot reproduce when the concentration of alcohol is above this level; as a consequence, fermentation ceases at that point.|$|E
