5|$|Wollstonecraft's feminist critics {{charged that}} the {{masculine}} role for women that she envisioned—one designed for the public sphere but which women could not perform in the public sphere—left women without a specific social position.

5|$|A {{number of}} saints and {{historical}} figures have followed and presented specific approaches to Christian meditation.

The Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius of Loyola use meditative mental imagery, {{with the goal of}} knowing Christ more intimately and loving him more ardently. <b>In</b> <b>The</b> <b>Way</b> <b>of</b> Perfection, St. Theresa of Avila taught her nuns how to try to get to know Christ by using meditation and mental prayer.

5|$|An {{important}} omission {{from the}} Atomic Energy of 1946 was {{any mention of}} non-governmental use of nuclear energy, since military applications overshadowed all others at the time.

5|$|Both {{operations}} were {{hampered by the}} German need to rely on their Croatian allies {{as well as the}} fact that both forces were ill-equipped for operations in mountainous terrain during extreme winter conditions.

5|$|During the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms {{period of}} China (907–960), while the {{fractured}} political realm of China saw no threat in a Tibet {{which was in}} just as much political disarray, there was little <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> Sino-Tibetan relations. Few documents involving Sino-Tibetan contacts survive from the Song dynasty (960–1279). The Song were far more concerned with countering northern enemy states of the Khitan-ruled Liao dynasty (907–1125) and Jurchen-ruled Jin dynasty (1115–1234).|$|E

5|$|In June 1940, the Wehrmacht had conquered most of Western Europe and Scandinavia.

5|$|In {{the last}} months of the war, Goebbels' speeches and {{articles}} took on an increasingly apocalyptic tone.

Berlin had little <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> fortifications or artillery (or even Volkssturm units, 'civilian soldiers'), as almost everything had been sent to the front. Goebbels noted in his diary on 21 January that millions of Germans were fleeing westward. He tentatively discussed with Hitler the issue of making peace overtures to the western allies, but Hitler again refused. Privately, Goebbels was conflicted at pushing the case with Hitler since {{he did not want to}} lose the confidence of his Führer.|$|E
