5|$|Camp Morton's first Confederate prisoners {{arrived on}} February 22–23, 1862.

For the remainder of the war, Camp Morton typically housed between 3,000 and 6,000 prisoners.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis {{research}} aims {{to examine}} inter-organizational cooperation and its network during emergency response of West Java Earthquake 2009, in Indonesia. In order to do so, the concepts from social network analysis {{will be used to}} examine and reveal the pattern of the network. In addition to the several social network measurements, qualitative finding and analytical results will be contrasted with the current institutional arrangement to improve cooperation at the time of emergency response. While, the network identified is similar to the most effective inter-organizational cooperation pattern predicted, as a result, the <b>humanitarian</b> <b>aids</b> delivery performance in this earthquake was somewhat under-performed. Therefore, internal capacity building of disaster-related agencies and network formulation prior the disaster is still needed for better <b>humanitarian</b> <b>aids</b> delivery at the time of disaster...|$|R

Carabane has remained one of the calmest areas of Casamance throughout the conflict. Nonetheless, a few small incidents were reported around April 2000. The rebels may have wanted to take advantage of Carabane's reputation to attract media attention.|$|E

Negotiations under US Special Envoy Richard Holbrooke broke down on 23March 1999, and he handed the matter to NATO, which started a 78-day bombing campaign on 24March 1999. Operation Allied Force targeted the military capabilities of {{what was then the}} Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. During the crisis, NATO also deployed one of its international reaction forces, the ACE Mobile Force (Land), to Albania as the Albania Force (AFOR), to deliver <b>humanitarian</b> <b>aid</b> to refugees from Kosovo.|$|E

5|$|The European Community {{attempted}} to provide <b>humanitarian</b> <b>aid</b> to the 12,000 civilians trapped within the perimeter, {{but only one}} aid convoy made it through. On 12 October, the Croatians suspended military action to allow the convoy to pass, but the JNA used the pause as cover to make further military gains. Once the convoy set off, the JNA delayed it for two days and used the time to lay mines, bring in reinforcements and consolidate JNA control of the road out of Vukovar. When the convoy arrived, it delivered medical supplies to Vukovar's hospital and evacuated 114 wounded civilians.|$|E

International <b>humanitarian</b> <b>aid</b> organisation Medecins Sans Frontieres was among the groups that were put under pressure. Other organisations affected included the Sierra Club and Avaaz. Cases of sedition were filed against individuals criticising the government. This led to discontent within the BJP regarding Modi's style of functioning and drew comparisons to the governing style of Indira Gandhi.|$|E
