5|$|After some deliberation, with {{opinions}} {{sought and}} obtained from Percival Keith, Norris Bradbury, Darol Froman, Elmer E. Kirkpatrick, Kenneth Nichols and Edward Teller, {{it was decided}} that this could be done safely if appropriate precautions were taken. On 28 November 1946, the K-25 plant began producing 94 percent product. At this point, they ran into a serious flaw in the gaseous diffusion concept: <b>enrichment</b> in uranium-235 also enriched the product in the unwanted and fairly useless uranium-234, making it difficult to raise the <b>enrichment</b> to 95 percent. On 6 December 1946, production was dropped back to a steady 2.56kg per day enriched to 93.7 percent uranium-235, along with 1.9 percent uranium-234. This was regarded as satisfactory product by the Los Alamos Laboratory, so on 26 December 1946 <b>enrichment</b> activity at Y-12 was curtailed. The Manhattan Project ended a few days later. Responsibility for the K-25 facility then passed to the new Atomic Energy Commission on 1 January 1947.|$|E
5|$|As 1943 {{gave way}} to 1944, many {{problems}} remained. Tests began on the machinery at K-25 in April 1944 without a barrier. Attention turned to a new process developed by Kellex. Finally, in July 1944, Kellex barriers began to be installed in K-25. K-25 commenced operation in February 1945, and as cascade after cascade came online, {{the quality of the}} product increased. By April 1945, K-25 had attained a 1.1% <b>enrichment.</b> Uranium partially enriched in K-25 was fed into the calutrons at Y-12 to complete the <b>enrichment</b> process.|$|E
5|$|Because {{uranium-235}} {{was known}} to be fissionable, it was the first material pursued in the approach to bomb development. As the first design developed (as well as the first deployed for combat), it is sometimes known as the Mark I. The vast majority of the work {{came in the form of}} the isotope <b>enrichment</b> of the uranium necessary for the weapon, since uranium-235 makes up only 1 part in 140 of natural uranium. <b>Enrichment</b> was performed at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, where the electromagnetic separation plant, known as Y-12, became fully operational in March 1944. The first shipments of highly enriched uranium were sent to the Los Alamos Laboratory in June 1944.|$|E

40|$|Ciprofloxacin (CIP) {{biodegradation}} {{was investigated}} using <b>enrichments</b> {{obtained in the}} presence of magnetite nanoparticles, CIP and human fecal sewage. CIP addition inhibited methanogenic activity and altered the bacterial community composition. The magnetite-supplemented <b>enrichments</b> significantly promoted CIP biodegradation, especially {{in the presence of}} 2 -bromoethanesulfonate (BES). When BES was added, CIP biodegradation in the magnetite-supplemented <b>enrichments</b> was 67 % higher than in the magnetite-unamended <b>enrichments.</b> Fe (II) concentrations were also significantly increased in the BES and magnetite-supplemented <b>enrichments.</b> This indicated {{that there might be a}} positive relationship of CIP biodegradation with microbial reduction of Fe (III) to Fe (II). As for the magnetite-supplemented <b>enrichments,</b> DNA-sequencing analysis revealed that Stenotrophomonas was the dominant genus, while Desulfovibrio became the dominant genus in the presence of BES. These two genera might be related to Fe (III) reduction in the magnetite. The findings provide a strategy for improving CIP biodegradation during waste treatment. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

5|$|Like the United States, the Soviet Union (USSR) {{carried out}} {{research}} on multiple <b>enrichment</b> technologies for the Soviet atomic bomb project. A trial electromagnetic process {{was carried out}} in 1946 with a calutron using a magnet taken from Germany. A site was chosen for an electromagnetic plant at Sverdlovsk-45 in 1946. The pilot plant, known as Plant 418, was completed in 1948. A more efficient design was developed in which the particle beams were bent by 225° instead of 180° as in the American calutron. It was used to complete the uranium <b>enrichment</b> process after technical difficulties were encountered with the gaseous diffusion process. Uranium enriched to about 40 percent uranium-235 was brought to Sverdlovsk-45 for final <b>enrichment</b> to between 92 and 98 percent. After the problems with the gaseous diffusion process were resolved in 1950, it was decided not to proceed with a full-scale electromagnetic plant. , it remains operational. In 1969, a research calutron known as S-2 was built at Arzamas-16 for high-efficiency separation of isotopes of heavy elements like plutonium.|$|E

40|$|A {{fragment}} of the nifH gene was amplified from anaerobic microbial <b>enrichments</b> initiated with marine planktonic invertebrates, including copepods and euphausids. A {{number of the}} nifH sequences from these <b>enrichments</b> were phylogenetically related to Cluster III nifH sequences of Clostridium pasteurianum and Desulfovibrio gigas. nifH fragments were cloned and sequenced from strains of Desulfobacter curvatus, Desulfonema limicola, and Chromatium purpuratum {{in order to provide}} the basis for identifying nifH sequences amplified from uncultivated microorganisms in the <b>enrichments.</b> Nitrogenase genes from Desulfonema limicola and Desulfobacter curvatus clustered with the sequence from Desulfovibrio gigas. Some of the nifH gene sequences from the zooplankton-derived microbial <b>enrichments</b> clustered with these sequences {{as well as a number}} of previously reported sequences from marine microbial mats, termite guts and intact invertebrate zooplankton. Some of the nitrogen-fixing phylotypes in the <b>enrichments</b> appeared to be active, since nitrogenase activity was detected by the acetylene reduction technique in the <b>enrichments.</b> Multiple copies of nifH were amplified from the Desulfobacter curvatus culture, with one of the sequences clustering with non-vanadium second alternative anfH sequences, but no anfH sequences were recovered from the <b>enrichments.</b> The results demonstrate that there are nitrogen-fixing anaerobes associated with planktonic crustacea, and the identified nifH phylotypes could be important in oceanic nitrogen fixation. z 1999 Federatio...|$|R
40|$|Microbial {{community}} {{structure was}} linked to degradation potential in benzene-, toluene- or xylene- (BTX) degrading, iron-reducing <b>enrichments</b> derived from an iron-reducing aquifer polluted with landfill leachate. <b>Enrichments</b> were characterized using 16 S rRNA gene-based analysis, targeting of the benzylsuccinate synthase-encoding bssA gene and phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) profiling in combination with tracking of labelled substrate. 16 S rRNA gene analysis indicated the dominance of Geobacteraceae, and one phylotype in particular, in all <b>enrichments</b> inoculated with polluted aquifer material. Upon cultivation, progressively higher degradation rates with a concomitant decrease in species richness occurred in all primary incubations and successive <b>enrichments.</b> Yet, the same Geobacteraceae phylotype remained common and dominant, indicating its involvement in BTX degradation. However, the bssA gene sequences in BTX degrading <b>enrichments</b> differed considerably from those of Geobacter isolates, suggesting that the first steps of toluene, but also benzene and xylene oxidation, are carried out by {{another member of the}} <b>enrichments.</b> Therefore, BTX would be synthrophically degraded by a bacterial consortium in which Geobacteraceae utilized intermediate metabolites.
