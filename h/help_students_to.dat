25|$|After the two {{series of}} homilies, he wrote three works to help {{students}} learn Latin, the Grammar, the Glossary and the Colloquy. In his Grammar, he translated the Latin grammar into English, creating what is considered the first vernacular Latin grammar in medieval Europe. In his glossary the words are not in alphabetical order, but grouped by topics. Finally, his Colloquy was intended to <b>help</b> <b>students</b> <b>to</b> learn how to speak Latin through a conversation manual. It is {{safe to assume that}} the original draft of this, afterwards maybe enlarged by his pupil and copyist, Ælfric Bata, was by Ælfric, and represents what his own scholar days were like.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the ways}} that Biko and the BCM sought to achieve {{psychological}} empowerment was through community development. Community projects were seen not only as a way to alleviate poverty in black communities but also as a means of transforming society psychologically, culturally, and economically. They would also <b>help</b> <b>students</b> <b>to</b> learn about the [...] "daily struggles" [...] of ordinary black people and to spread Black Consciousness ideas among the population. Among the projects that SASO set its members to conduct in the holidays were repairs to schools, house-building, and instructions on financial management and agricultural techniques. Healthcare was also a priority, with SASO members focusing on primary and preventative care.|$|E
500|$|Chao claimed that, because GR embeds {{the tone}} of each {{syllable}} in its spelling, it may <b>help</b> <b>students</b> <b>to</b> master Chinese tones. One study of GR, however, found the opposite to be true. GR uses a complicated system of tonal spelling that obscures the basic relationship between spelling and tone; for example, the difference between tones 1 and 2 is variously indicated as mha vs. ma, ching vs. chyng, chang vs. charng, etc. [...] Although tonal spelling has been adopted {{as part of the}} normal romanization of a number of Asian languages (e.g. Hmong), all such systems indicate different tones in a simple and consistent fashion by adding letters {{to the end of a}} syllable (e.g. in Hmong, -b indicates high tone, -s indicates low tone, -j indicates high-falling tone, etc.).|$|E

2500|$|Prestige {{of colleges}} {{correlates}} with age, {{such that the}} oldest east-coast schools tend to have accumulated the most prestige {{by virtue of their}} longevity. There is widespread consensus that the fit between a student and a school is an important factor. Several reports suggest that [...] "fit should trump prestige every single time," [...] and that it is better for a school to match a student in terms of social, cultural, and academic qualities and not be chosen simply because of a school's prestige. Others see college admissions as essentially a choice between [...] "price and prestige". Elite colleges have been compared to designer labels, a valuable credential in the job market, and an entryway into top graduate schools. Some advisors specialize in helping students find a good fit—a suitable list of colleges—which helps students in the long run. They <b>help</b> <b>students</b> <b>to</b> explore their values and needs, and provide counseling to help both students and parents find a college or university program that helps students meet long-term goals. Questions include thinking about life goals, which activities a person likes best, and what style of learning works best for the student. Evaluating personal preferences is important and can take time. One advisor suggests it is important for a student to think through what is best, and choose on this basis, and [...] "do not listen to your friends" [...] since they have different needs and wants. [...] "One of the worst ways {{to make a decision about}} where to go to college is to follow a friend because he or she is having a good time at that school," [...] wrote one advisor. Since [...] "barely half" [...] of students entering college as first-year students ever graduate from college later in their lives, getting the right fit is important for parents and students to avoid wasting money.
