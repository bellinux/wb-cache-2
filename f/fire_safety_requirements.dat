40|$|The {{key issue}} {{addressed}} by this dissertation {{is that a}} number of heritage buildings undergoing the adaptive reuse are having building components such as timber structure, timber staircase which cannot meet the current <b>fire</b> <b>safety</b> regulation. Given this, it is imperative to begin researching the reasons why the timber component in heritage buildings cannot comply with the current statutory fire resistance requirement and find out the methods in preserving the timber component. The dissertation will focus on timber floor which is a highly important component in meeting the <b>fire</b> <b>safety</b> <b>requirement</b> as it provides the compartment separation to inhabit the rapid spread of fire and smoke in a building and as the same time it is usually a character defining element having heritage value. The dissertation will try to find out the different methods of conserving the timber floor of the heritage building under adaptive reuse with examples. The different methods will be evaluated based on the fire performance, statutory acceptance and conservation principles and the appropriate method will be matched to the adaptive reuse heritage buildings in Hong Kong. published_or_final_versionConservationMasterMaster of Science in Conservatio...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{fundamental}} concept behind performance based <b>fire</b> <b>safety</b> {{engineering is}} that a properly designed structure {{should be able to}} satisfy some specified <b>fire</b> <b>safety</b> <b>requirement.</b> This design process is normally done by simulating fire evolution in the structure and evaluating safety criteria. Of the multitude of scenarios over which to sample and test, some knowledge of the likely configuration and use of the structure will impact the choice of scenarios where attention should be focused. While perfect knowledge of the fire size and the configuration of any given compartment is impossible in the design stage, there are bounds on the fuel load and configuration of a compartment. One method for bounding the likely distribution of configurations and fuel loading is through the use of probabilistic descriptions of these “random variables”. In this manuscript we evaluate the impact of randomly prescribed fire sizes and randomly specified vent opening sizes on the distribution of the layer height within a compartment. As is well known, the impact of the fire and the evolution of the layer height are strongly coupled to the ventilation characteristics of the compartment. In previous work, we have investigated the evolution of layer height distribution {{as a function of the}} fire size distribution. In this paper, we extend that work from the univariate distributions that were analyzed to the more complex bivariate case of random fire size and vent opening area. We again apply the quadrature method of moments to the problem and develop an analogous method of solution as we developed earlier. We again find that the moment methods compare quite well to the MC simulations even though the computational cost of the moment based models is orders of magnitude less expensive. We present the results and discuss options for extension of these methods beyond simple zone type models...|$|R

40|$|It is {{critical}} for the construction industry to ensure that new building designs and materials, including wall and floor assemblies (e. g., a studded wall with insulation and drywall) provide an acceptable level of <b>fire</b> <b>safety.</b> A key <b>fire</b> <b>safety</b> <b>requirement</b> that is specified in building codes is the minimum fire resistance rating, which {{is a measure of}} the ability of an assembly to limit fire spread within a building. A manufacturer of building materials (e. g., insulation or drywall) is required to perform full-scale fire resistance furnace tests to determine the fire resistance ratings of assemblies that use their products. Fire resistance test facilities are very limited and these tests are very expensive to perform. Therefore, it can be difficult to properly assess the impact of changes to individual components on the overall fire performance of an assembly during the design process. As part of a project to develop methods of using small-scale fire test data to predict full-scale fire resistance test results, the heat transfer through scale models of common wall assembly designs was measured during cone calorimeter tests using an incident heat flux of 75 kW/m 2. Wall assemblies consisting of single and double layers of 12. 7 mm (1 / 2 in.) regular and lightweight gypsum board, and 15. 9 mm (5 / 8 in.) type X gypsum board, along with mineral wool insulation and wood studs were tested. Temperature measurements made at various points within these assemblies are presented in this paper, and are discussed using results from thermal gravimetric analysis tests of the three types of gypsum board. Implications of this research to the development of heat transfer models and scaling relationships are also briefly discussed...|$|R
