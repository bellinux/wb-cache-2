40|$|In-plane {{deformation}} of thermoplastic weft-knit textile composites under tensile loading in both macro and micro-scale is studied. An interlock knitted preform {{was produced by}} co-knitting polyester filament yarns as fabric reinforcement with polypropylene yarns as matrix material. The benefits of knitting over other fibre architectures are detailed. Energy absorption capacity for specific engineering applications is discussed. Comparison of tensile properties is made between composites and their individual components. The methods of producing <b>interlock</b> <b>limited</b> knitted fabric preforms are explained. Compression moulding of these produced flat thermoplastic composite panels. The hot-pressing process is examined. The method and equipment used in tensile testing are specified. The tensile curves of pure PP matrix, fabric preform and knitted composites in the walewise, coursewise and diagonal directions are noted. The walewise direction demonstrated better tensile properties. The matrix contribution {{on most of the}} load sustained in the elastic region allied with other factors provided a better combination of properties in the knitted composites than in individual components.

40|$|A {{new digital}} beam {{position}} monitor (DBPM) {{system has been}} developed and successfully tested at the PSI proton accelerators. The DBPM hardware consists of an analogue RF front-end (RFFE), a VMEbus backplane module (VBM), and the PSI VME PMC Carrier board (VPC). The RFFE combines the 2 nd RF harmonic (101. 26 MHz) beam signals of pickup coils with a 101. 31 MHz pilot signal. The RFFE output signals are undersampled and down-converted to base-band (no analogue mixer) by ADCs and DDCs (Direct Digital Downconverters) on the VBM. The DDCs send the digitised beam and pilot signal amplitudes to a Virtex 2 Pro FPGA on the VPC board. The FPGA calculates the beam positions at different averaging rates, checks <b>interlock</b> <b>limits,</b> and provides triggered storage of beam position waveforms. Furthermore, the FPGA performs automatic gain control of voltage-controlled amplifiers (VCAs) of RFFE and VBM. By continuous normalisation of beam to pilot signal, nonlinearities and temperature drifts of the electronics are eliminated. Compared to the old analogue BPM electronics, the new DBPMs offer an increased dynamic range (0. 2 µA to 2 mA instead of 5 µA to 2 mA) and larger bandwidth (10 kHz instead of 10 Hz) ...|$|R

40|$|This paper reviews {{several aspects}} of beam-limiting and radiation- <b>limiting</b> <b>interlocks</b> used for {{personnel}} protection at high-intensity accelerators. It is based heavily on the experience at the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center (LANSCE) where instrumentation-based protection is used extensively. Topics include the need for ``active`` protection systems, system requirements, design criteria, and means of achieving and assessing acceptable reliability. The experience with several specific devices (ion chamber-based beam loss interlock, beam current limiter interlock, and neutron radiation interlock) designed and/or deployed to these requirements and criteria is evaluated...|$|R
50|$|In the 1930s, {{following}} {{the integration of}} train and bus services, summer train service was trimmed to about a dozen trains each way on all three main routes. This intensive service ran on an entirely single-track system controlled by staff and ticket safeworking, with limited semaphore signalling. As it was exempt from the 1889 Railways Act due to the Island's railways falling under Tynwald's oversight, it lacked signal interlockings except at Douglas and St John's, though <b>limited</b> <b>interlocking</b> {{in the form of}} slot detectors was fitted at passing loops from 1927 onwards. Continuous vacuum brakes were not fitted until 1925-27. In spite of this the railway has seen very few serious accidents (see below).|$|R
50|$|The Texas League is a Minor League Baseball league which {{operates}} in the South Central United States. It {{is classified as}} a Double-A league. The league was founded in 1888 and ran through 1892. It was called the Texas Association in 1895, the Texas-Southern League in 1896 and again as the Texas League from 1897-1899. It was revived as a Class D league in 1902, moved to Class C in 1904 where it played through 1910 (except for 1906 as Class D again), played at Class B until 1920, and finally moved up to Class A in 1921. The Texas League, like many others, shut down during World War II. From 1959 to 1961, the Texas League and the Mexican League formed the Pan American Association. The two leagues played a <b>limited</b> <b>interlocking</b> schedule and post-season championship. By 1971, the Texas League and the Southern League had both decreased to seven teams. They played an interlocking schedule with the Southern League known as the Dixie Association. The two leagues played separate playoffs.|$|R
40|$|Railway {{interlocking}} {{is designed}} to prevent trains from colliding. Generally speaking current systems are safe due to the processes that signalling systems have to follow as well as implementation procedures that interlockings are compliant with. Even the processes and procedures are very advanced; there are still train crashes that are triggered by interlocking faults. However, the interlocking faults are mainly related to poor maintenance of the systems or/and changes to the original designs without correct authorisation. While those areas are worth exploring to search some improvements {{it is also important}} that interlocking will progress its development toward intelligent transport system reinforcing maintenance functions. Rail signalling systems went toward eliminating human factor by introducing machine based decision making on whether to proceed or stop. Development of electrical and electronic systems found interlocking moving toward relay solutions that became very common and are still used on railways. Finally computer based interlocking was introduced and successfully implemented in 90 's. Interlocking logic of those solutions has not been formalised {{so that it can be}} progressed toward intelligent transport systems. <b>Interlocking</b> functions are <b>limited</b> to ensure train operations are safe. Maintenance functions (e. g. fault prediction) or functions to enhance passengers' management are currently not implemented in rail interlockings. This paper elaborates on currently implemented rail interlockings, compares various technologies implemented in those interlockings and proposes a base for consistent development of formal interlocking methods.

40|$|In this {{dissertation}} three {{essays on}} corporate governance and politically connected firms are presented. The first essay “Interlocked Boards of Directors, Corporate Governance and Earnings Quality” studies {{the effects of}} interlocked boards of directors on voluntary governance disclosures, governance practices and earnings quality. The Canadian environment, where director interlocks are prevalent, is examined. A checklist of twenty voluntary disclosure measures from proxy statements is developed and a direct measure of interlocking directorships is employed. It is found that interlocked boards of directors are negatively associated with voluntary governance disclosures and positively associated with earnings quality. From an accounting perspective, greater earnings quality provides evidence that regulator rules and policies <b>limiting</b> <b>interlocks</b> may be unnecessary. Research has shown that firms can benefit when they are politically connected. The extant literature has shown that politically connected firms benefit from procurement contracts, reduced regulatory issues and lower costs of capital. However, with more politicians joining corporate boards, the effect of political connectedness on corporate governance remains unclear. The second essay is entitled “Politically Connected Directors and Corporate Governance”, and it examines the association between politically connected directors and corporate governance. A sample of high ranking politicians that have joined firm boards of directors is examined. I find that firms with politician directors have higher corporate governance scores. Additional tests also indicate that an addition of a politician to {{a board of directors}} increases the governance quality. The extant literature has also demonstrated that both political connections and cross-listing can benefit firms in various aspects, such as superior stock returns and a lower cost of capital. The third paper, entitled “The Value of Political Connections for Cross-Listed Firms”, examines whether cross-listed firms can obtain incremental financial benefits by also being politically connected. 142 Canadian cross-listed firms are examined {{to determine the extent of}} their political connections and to assess whether any incremental benefits are gained in politically connected cross-listed firms. The results show that politically connected cross-listed firms have higher analyst following, higher market valuations and greater market liquidity...|$|R
