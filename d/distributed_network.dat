Lowell Observatory continues to be an active astronomical observatory and a popular visitors center which hosts educational displays and tours. It has a <b>distributed</b> <b>network</b> of small telescopes which together create images of celestial bodies with much higher resolutions than any other single telescope can produce. Current research is involved in observations of near-Earth phenomena such as asteroids and comets. The observatory is also involved in a $30 million project with the Discovery Channel to build the Discovery Channel Telescope, a sophisticated, ground-based telescope with advanced optical capabilities for future projects. Lowell Observatory and NOFS are also collaborators on the major project, the Navy Prototype Optical Interferometer, on nearby Anderson Mesa. NOFS is heavily involved with the science of star catalogs and astrometry, or the positions and distances of stars and celestial objects.|$|E

25|$|With {{the help}} of the {{computing}} power of over half a million PlayStation 3 consoles, the distributed computing project Folding@home has been recognized by Guinness World Records as the most powerful <b>distributed</b> <b>network</b> in the world. The first record was achieved on September 16, 2007, as the project surpassed one petaFLOPS, which had never previously been attained by a distributed computing network. Additionally, the collective efforts enabled PS3 alone to reach the petaFLOPS mark on September 23, 2007. In comparison, the world's second-most powerful supercomputer at the time, IBM's BlueGene/L, performed at around 478.2teraFLOPS, which means Folding@home's computing power is approximately twice BlueGene/L's (although the CPU interconnect in BlueGene/L is more than one million times faster than the mean network speed in Folding@home). As of May 7, 2011, Folding@home runs at about 9.3 x86 petaFLOPS, with 1.6petaFLOPS generated by 26,000 active PS3s alone. In late 2008, a cluster of 200 PlayStation 3 consoles was used to generate a rogue SSL certificate, effectively cracking its encryption.|$|E

The {{goal of a}} claytronics matrix is to dynamically form three-dimensional shapes. However, the vast number of catoms in this <b>distributed</b> <b>network</b> increases complexity of micro-management of each individual catom. So, each catom must perceive accurate position information and command of cooperation with its neighbors. In this environment, software language for the matrix operation must convey concise statements of high-level commands {{in order to be}} universally distributed. [...] Languages to program a matrix require a more abbreviated syntax and style of command than normal programming languages such as C++ and Java.|$|E

2500|$|In 2003, Ian McNab {{outlined}} {{a plan to}} turn this idea into a realized technology. [...] Because of strong acceleration, this system would launch only sturdy materials, such as food, water, and – most importantly – fuel. Under ideal circumstances (equator, mountain, heading east) the system would cost $528/kg, compared with $5,000/kg on the conventional rocket. The McNab's railgun could make approximately 2000 launches per year, {{for a total of}} maximum 500 tons launched per year. Because the launch track would be 1.6km long, power will be supplied by a <b>distributed</b> <b>network</b> of 100 rotating machines (compulsator) spread along the track. [...] Each machine would have a 3.3-ton carbon fibre rotor spinning at high speeds. [...] A machine can recharge {{in a matter of hours}} using 10MW power. [...] This machine could be supplied by a dedicated generator. [...] The total launch package would weigh almost 1.4tons. [...] Payload per launch in these conditions is over 400kg. There would be a peak operating magnetic field of 5T—half of this coming from the rails, and the other half from augmenting magnets. This halves the required current through the rails, which reduces the power fourfold.|$|E
40|$|Abstract- The <b>Distributed</b> Jammer <b>Network</b> (DJN) is {{composed}} {{to a large}} number of tiny, low-power jammers, which are described inside a target network and emit radio energy to disrupt its communications. <b>Distributed</b> Jammer <b>Network</b> (DJN) can be deployed to form a low-power jamming dust that is more attractive than traditional high-power jammers because of its much reduced effect on self-interference. As for the jamming mechanism, it is assumed that jammers in <b>Distributed</b> Jammer <b>Network</b> (DJN) are reactive jammer senses a wide frequency range and jams the channel in which it detects radio activity.
