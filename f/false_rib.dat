50|$|The terms true and <b>false</b> <b>rib</b> {{describe}} rib pairs {{that are}} {{directly or indirectly}} attached to the sternum. The phrase true rib (costae verae), or fixed rib, refers to the first seven, or vertebrosternal, rib pairs. The phrase <b>false</b> <b>rib</b> (costae spuriae), or vertebrochondral ribs refers to the eighth-to-twelfth pairs of ribs. The eighth-to-tenth pairs of ribs connect to the sternum indirectly via the costal cartilages of the ribs above them. Their elasticity allows ribcage movement for respiratory activity.|$|E
50|$|Ribs are {{described}} {{based on their}} location and connection with the sternum. Ribs that articulate directly with the sternum are called true ribs, whereas those that connect indirectly via cartilage are termed <b>false</b> <b>ribs.</b>|$|R
5000|$|It {{consists}} of the ribs and sternum.The ribs of the thorax are numbered in ascending order from 1-12. 11 & 12 are known as floating ribs {{because they have no}} anterior attachment point in particular the cartilage attached to the sternum, as 1-7 are, and therefore are termed [...] "floating". Whereas ribs 8-10 are termed <b>false</b> <b>ribs</b> as their costal cartilage articulates with the costal cartilage of the rib above.|$|R
50|$|The {{internal}} {{intercostal muscles}} (intercostales interni) are {{a group of}} skeletal muscles located between the ribs. They are eleven in number on either side. They commence anteriorly at the sternum, in the intercostal spaces between the cartilages of the true ribs, and at the anterior extremities of the cartilages of the <b>false</b> <b>ribs,</b> and extend backward {{as far as the}} angles of the ribs, hence they are continued to the vertebral column by thin aponeuroses, the posterior intercostal membranes.|$|R
50|$|All {{first-hand}} {{accounts of}} the duel agree that two shots were fired; however, Hamilton and Burr's seconds disagreed on the intervening time between the shots. It was common for both principals in a duel to fire {{a shot at the}} ground to exemplify courage, and then the duel could come to an end. Hamilton apparently fired a shot above Burr's head. Burr returned fire and hit Hamilton in the lower abdomen above the right hip. The large-caliber lead ball ricocheted off Hamilton's third or second <b>false</b> <b>rib,</b> fracturing it, and caused considerable damage to his internal organs, particularly his liver and diaphragm, before becoming lodged in his first or second lumbar vertebra. According to Pendleton's account, Hamilton collapsed immediately, dropping the pistol involuntarily, and Burr moved toward Hamilton in a speechless manner (which Pendleton deemed to be indicative of regret) before being hustled away behind an umbrella by Van Ness because Hosack and the rowers were already approaching.|$|E
5000|$|The duel {{began at}} dawn on July 11, 1804, {{along the west}} bank of the Hudson River on a rocky ledge in Weehawken, New Jersey. Coincidentally, the duel took place {{relatively}} close to the location of the duel that ended the life of Hamilton's eldest son, Philip, three years earlier. After the seconds measured the paces, Hamilton, according to both William P. Van Ness and Burr, raised his pistol [...] "as if to try the light" [...] and had to wear his spectacles to prevent his vision from being obscured. Hamilton also refused the hairspring set of dueling pistols (that would make the pulling of the trigger lighter) offered by Nathaniel Pendleton. Vice President Burr shot Hamilton, delivering what proved to be a fatal wound. Hamilton's shot broke a tree branch directly above Burr's head. Neither of the seconds, Pendleton nor Van Ness, could determine who fired first, as each claimed that the other man had fired first. Soon after, they measured and triangulated the shooting, but could not determine from which angle Hamilton fired. Burr's shot, however, hit Hamilton in the lower abdomen above the right hip. The bullet ricocheted off Hamilton's second or third <b>false</b> <b>rib,</b> fracturing it and causing considerable damage to his internal organs, particularly his liver and diaphragm, before becoming lodged in his first or second lumbar vertebra. Biographer Ron Chernow considered the circumstances to indicate that, after taking deliberate aim, Burr fired second, while biographer James Earnest Cooke suggested that Burr took careful aim and shot first, and Hamilton fired while falling, after being struck by Burr's bullet.|$|E
50|$|The head is very solid, without {{pronounced}} stop or sculls. The neck is low set, short, with dewlap. The body {{is fairly}} broad, proportionate, muscles rather flat. The ribcage appears very long because of developed <b>false</b> <b>ribs.</b> The legs are straight, with heavy boning and moderate yet defined angulation. Leg bones {{must be in}} proportion, and shall never {{give the impression that}} any bone is short. The rump is broad. The typical gait is a gallop; however CAO can trot for hours without wearing themselves out.|$|R
60|$|Section 81. The thorax is bounded dorsally by the {{vertebral}} column, and ventrally by the sternum. The sternum {{consists of}} segments, the sternebrae (st.); anteriorly {{there is a}} bony manubrium (mb.), posteriorly a thin cartilaginous plate, the xiphisternum (xi.). Seven pairs of ribs articulate by cartilaginous ends (sternal ribs) with the sternum directly, as indicated in the figure; five (<b>false)</b> <b>ribs</b> are joined, {{to each other and}} to the seventh, and not to the sternum directly. The last four ribs have no tuberculum (Section 77).|$|R
50|$|The upper lateral {{limit of}} the abdomen is the subcostal margin (at or near the subcostal plane) formed by the cartilages of the <b>false</b> <b>ribs</b> (8, 9, 10) joining one another. The lower lateral limit is the {{anterior}} crest of the ilium and Poupart's ligament, which runs from the anterior superior spine of the ilium to {{the spine of the}} pubis. These lower limits are marked by visible grooves. Just above the pubic spines on either side are the external abdominal rings, which are openings in the muscular wall of the abdomen through which the spermatic cord emerges in the male, and through which an inguinal hernia may rupture.|$|R
50|$|This breed {{comprises}} numerous breed types. They {{differ in}} size, color, head types, and hair types. Central Asians tend {{to form a}} social group, consisting of different members bearing different duties; thus puppies with different working qualities are normally born in the same litter. These breed features, as well as different traditional names for the breed, give grounds for complications with breed standard. Most important, purebred Central Asians have unique breed characteristics. Breed-specific dog anatomy includes exclusive features, such as very noticeable extremely flexible joints, <b>false</b> <b>ribs,</b> specific head set, and very strong neck with massive dewlap. Expressive, almost human eyes, revealing inimitable intelligence, finish the portrait.|$|R

60|$|For {{the whole}} of that day we worked our devious course, by great labor and at {{uncertain}} intervals, to the southward; and at night we fastened the Walrus to a floe, in waiting {{for the return of}} light. Just as the day dawned, however, I heard a tremendous grating sound {{against the side of the}} vessel; and rushing on deck, I found that we were completely caught between two immense fields, which seemed to be attracted towards each other for no other apparent purpose than to crush us. Here it was that the expedient of Captain Poke made manifest its merits. Protected by the massive timbers and <b>false</b> <b>ribs,</b> the bilge of the ship resisted the pressure; and as, under such circumstances, something must yield, luckily nothing but the attraction of gravitation was overcome. The skids, through their inclination, acted as wedges, the links pressing against the keel; and in the course of an hour the Walrus was gradually lifted out of the water, maintaining her upright position, in consequence of the powerful nip of the floes. No sooner was this experiment handsomely effected, than Mr. Poke jumped upon the ice, and commenced an examination of the ship's bottom.|$|R
50|$|The Temple of San Luis Obispo, {{with the}} {{adjoining}} Capilla Abierta (Open Chapel) {{were built in}} the 16th century by the Franciscans as part of the Monastery of San Luis. The first church was built by Friar Juan de Rivas which opened in 1532. The larger complex was constructed between 1585 and 1591. The church is relatively simply decorated with only roses on the jamb of the main doors. In the central nave, there is a large relief of Saint Francis with the stigmata. The church has only one nave with a polygonal space for the main altar. This is covered by a barrel vault with <b>false</b> <b>ribs</b> painted on the ceiling. The interior has a lavish Mexican Baroque altarpiece done in cedar representing the Visit of the Virgin. The paintings on this altar were done by Baltasar de Echave The cloister has frescos with scenes of flora and fauna and human figures, as well as portraits of Martin de Valencia and Saint Clare. Friar Martin de Valencia died in Ayotzingo and is interred in the Tlalmanalco church.Tlalmanalco {{was one of the first}} sites to have a “open chapel,” and is one of the very few places where one can be found intact today. In the open chapel was where mass was offered to natives who would not enter the dark confines of the typical church. The Capilla Abierta is done in Mexican Baroque style and is considered an interesting example of “tequitqui” art. The word “tequitqui” is from Nahuatl, meaning “vassal.” This expression was used to refer to artistic works, especially sculpture, that had Christian themes but was done by indigenous craftsmen. The Capilla Abierta has a trapezoidal layout, left incomplete. Five arches with capitals finished with reliefs and a frieze that follows the outline of the arches filled with human figures. These arches were reserved for persons of high social rank. The arch behind these was most likely reserved for the altar. The interior is “proto- renaissance” and decorated with Italian-style motifs and figures that seem to represent indigenous bestiary. Images includes telamons, male goats (to represent lust) and a portrait of Friar Martin de Valencia, and Saint Claire. The mix of Christian and indigenous motifs has been studied by Gustavo Curiel and others. According to Curiel, the images seem to represent the clash between idolatry, associated with the devil and Christianity in competition for the soul.|$|R
40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the sensitivity of}} postmortem computed tomography (PMCT) in rib fracture detection validated against autopsy. Fifty-one forensic cases underwent a postmortem CT prior to forensic autopsy. Two image readers (radiologist and forensic pathologist) assessed high resolution CT data sets for rib fractures. Correct recognition rates (CRR), sensitivity and specificity values were calculated over all observations as well as individually for every rib and region. Additionally, for partial rib fractures the sensitivity of autopsy was calculated vice versa. 3876 entries in each study protocol (autopsy, PMCT radiologist and PMCT forensic pathologist) were investigated. A total of 690 fractures (autopsy), 491 (PMCT and radiologist) and 559 (PMCT and forensic pathologist) were detected. The CRR was 0. 85. Sensitivity and specificity of PMCT for rib fracture detection were 0. 63 (0. 58 radiologist, 0. 68 forensic pathologist) and 0. 97 (both readers 0. 97), respectively. Low CRR and sensitivity values were obtained for antero-lateral fractures. Partial rib fractures were better detected by PMCT. PMCT has a rather low sensitivity for rib fracture detection when validated against autopsy and indicates that clinical CT may also demonstrate a reasonable number of <b>false</b> negatives. Partial <b>rib</b> fractures often remain undetected at autopsy...|$|R
