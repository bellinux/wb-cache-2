Sir Jasper’s marriage to Lady Fidget is beneficial to his business; therefore he treats her as his asset. He constantly asks Horner to “watch” her so that she will have no opportunity to make a cuckold out of him. Furthermore, there is a struggle for dominance between men and women. As Pinchwife says, ‘”If we do not cheat women, they’ll cheat us” is the very basis for the chief plot of the play, “which centers upon the exchange of positions of dominance within his own family.” [...] Pinchwife decides to marry a country woman in the hopes that she will not be clever enough to know how to cheat, but his extremes in preventing her exposure to men leads to his downfall. Only the women are expected to remain faithful to their husbands.

Moreover, the objective approach was used in analyzing this study because this only dealt with literary work itself without studying the authorÂ’s life.

The purposes of this research are to find out the <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>moral</b> values in Narit Maja and to describe its realization in the Acehnese society. This research applies the theory <b>of</b> universal <b>moral</b> values by Kinnier et. al (2000) which focuses on four types <b>of</b> <b>moral</b> values and their elements. In addition, this study is conducted by using descriptive qualitative as the method.

The technique of collecting data is the documentation and interview technique.

Those are commitment to something greater than oneself, self-respect but with humbleness or respect to others, self- discipline and acceptance of personal responsibility and the last moral value is caring for others do not murder, abuse, steal from, cheat, or lie to others. Furthermore, the realization <b>of</b> <b>moral</b> values in Narit Maja toward the Acehnese society can be seen until nowadays.
