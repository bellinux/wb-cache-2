This would make it much more <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>detect</b> because it would be lost in Makemake's glare much of the time and, along with its dark surface, would contribute to previous surveys failing to observe it.|$|E
5|$|Although argon is non-toxic, it is 38% denser than air and {{therefore}} considered a dangerous asphyxiant in closed areas. It is <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>detect</b> {{because it is}} colorless, odorless, and tasteless. A 1994 incident, in which a man was asphyxiated after entering an argon-filled section of oil pipe under construction in Alaska, highlights the dangers of argon tank leakage in confined spaces and emphasizes the need for proper use, storage and handling.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the paucity}} of {{surviving}} attributed works, it is <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>detect</b> any evolution in Lochner's style. Art historians are unsure if his style became progressively more or less influenced by Netherlandish art. Recent dendrochronological examination of attributed works indicate that his development was not linear, suggesting that the more advanced Presentation in the Temple is of 1445, predating the more Gothic Saints panels now divided between London and Cologne.|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to identify and describe how system dynamic can be useful to improve the decision making on projects, and leverage their execution. For this, the problems in the current project management frameworks are discussed and pointed some consequences of these deficiencies. A descriptive-exploratory research is presented through a qualitative case study in the Connected Amazon Program. Some improvement in decision making through the use of soft modeling of system dynamic were observed, anticipating problems that could occur in the Program execution. These problems are <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>detected</b> with current project management tools, which suggests that the use of system dynamics can complement traditional modeling, leveraging the project planning and execution. ...|$|R

5|$|Inexpensive {{powdered}} S.luteus fruit {{bodies are}} sometimes {{added to the}} more expensive B.edulis mushroom soup powder, a fraudulent practice that is <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>detect</b> with microscopy because the tissues are no longer intact. This adulteration can be determined chemically, however, by testing for increased levels of the sugar alcohols arabitol and mannitol. The practice can also be determined with a DNA-based method that is sensitive enough to detect the addition of 1–2% of S.luteus to B.edulis powder.|$|E
5|$|Lack of {{differentiation}} between homosexual and heterosexual women in medical studies that concentrate on health issues for women skews results for lesbians and non-lesbian women. Reports are inconclusive about occurrence {{of breast cancer}} in lesbians. It has been determined, however, that the lower rate of lesbians tested by regular Pap smears makes it more <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>detect</b> cervical cancer at early stages in lesbians. The risk factors for developing ovarian cancer rates are higher in lesbians than heterosexual women, perhaps because many lesbians lack protective factors of pregnancy, abortion, contraceptives, breast feeding, and miscarriages.|$|E
5|$|The Soviet Air Force {{practice}} of harassing German ground forces using antiquated Polikarpov Po-2 and R-5 biplanes {{at night to}} drop flares and fragmentation bombs, inspired the Luftwaffe to form its own Störkampfstaffeln (harassment squadrons). On 23 July 1942, Junkers offered the Ju 87 B-2, R-2 and R-4s with Flammenvernichter ("flame eliminators"). On 10 November 1943, the RLM GL/C-E2 Division finally authorised the design in directive No. 1117. This new equipment made the Ju 87 more <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>detect</b> from the ground in darkness.|$|E

30|$|The {{diagnosis}} of COFs is not straight forward because {{the symptoms are}} diverse, {{and it may be}} <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> clinically <b>detect</b> the fracture lines.

30|$|Based on {{the above}} analysis, {{it can be}} {{concluded}} that (1) the existing color models are application-specific; however, there is no splicing detection-oriented color model to the best of the authors’ knowledge; (2) some of the edges (or splicing artifacts) are <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> be <b>detected</b> in a single channel; (3) multi-channel information should be considered in the process of image splicing detection.|$|R
5|$|The {{internal}} {{structure of the}} ear, which has large numbers of auditory neurons, gives an improved ability to detect low-frequency sounds at a distance, which could include rustling made by prey moving in vegetation. The tawny owl's hearing is ten times better than a human's, and it can hunt using this sense {{alone in the dark}} of a woodland on an overcast night, but the patter of raindrops makes it <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>detect</b> faint sounds, and prolonged wet weather can lead to starvation if the owl cannot hunt effectively.|$|E
5|$|The mildest form of hepatic {{encephalopathy}} is <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>detect</b> clinically, {{but may be}} demonstrated on neuropsychological testing. It is experienced as forgetfulness, mild confusion, and irritability. The first stage of {{hepatic encephalopathy}} is characterised by an inverted sleep-wake pattern (sleeping by day, being awake at night). The second stage is marked by lethargy and personality changes. The third stage is marked by worsened confusion. The fourth stage {{is marked by a}} progression to coma.|$|E
5|$|Vulcanoids, {{should they}} exist, would be <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>detect</b> {{due to the}} strong glare of the nearby Sun, and {{ground-based}} searches can only be carried out during twilight or during solar eclipses. Several searches during eclipses were conducted in the early 1900s, which did not reveal any vulcanoids, and observations during eclipses remain a common search method. Conventional telescopes cannot be used to search for them because the nearby Sun could damage their optics.|$|E
30|$|In practice, the {{matching}} performance of keypoints affects the available number of overlapping images. However, matching performance {{is closely related}} to the texture of the surrounding environment.

How to improve the keypoints’ matching performance in such region is still a question that needs to be further explored.|$|R

5|$|A nearly {{vertical}} {{region of}} the HR diagram, known as the instability strip, is occupied by pulsating variable stars known as Cepheid variables. These stars vary in magnitude at regular intervals, giving them a pulsating appearance. The strip intersects {{the upper part of}} the main sequence in the region of class A and F stars, which are between one and two solar masses. Pulsating stars in this part of the instability strip that intersects {{the upper part of the}} main sequence are called Delta Scuti variables. Main-sequence stars in this region experience only small changes in magnitude and so this variation is <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>detect.</b> Other classes of unstable main-sequence stars, like Beta Cephei variables, are unrelated to this instability strip.|$|E
5|$|Volcanic ash {{clouds are}} very <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>detect</b> from {{aircraft}} as no onboard cockpit instruments exist to detect them. However, {{a new system}} called Airborne Volcanic Object Infrared Detector (AVOID) has recently been developed by Nicarnica Aviation, a daughter company of the Norwegian Institute for Air Research, which will allow pilots to detect ash plumes up to 100 km (62 mi) ahead and fly safely around them. The system uses two fast-sampling infrared cameras, mounted on a forward-facing surface, that are tuned to detect volcanic ash. This system can detect ash concentrations of <1 mg/m3 to > 50 mg/m3, giving pilots approximately 7–10 minutes warning. The camera is currently being tested by easyJet airline company.|$|E
5|$|A wake low, or wake depression, is a {{mesoscale}} low-pressure {{area which}} trails the mesoscale high following a squall line. Due to the subsiding warm air {{associated with the}} systems formation, clearing skies {{are associated with the}} wake low. Once <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>detect</b> in surface weather observations due to their broad spacing, the formation of mesoscale weather station networks, or mesonets, has increased their detection. Severe weather, in the form of high winds, can be generated by the wake low when the pressure difference between the mesohigh preceding it and the wake low is intense enough. When the squall line {{is in the process of}} decay, heat bursts can be generated near the wake low. Once new thunderstorm activity along the squall line concludes, the wake low associated with it weakens in tandem.|$|E

5|$|During their {{terrestrial}} phase, crested and marbled newts {{depend on}} a landscape that offers cover, invertebrate prey and humidity. The precise requirements of most species are still poorly known, as the newts are much more <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>detect</b> and observe on land. Deciduous woodlands or groves are in general preferred, but conifer woods are also accepted, especially in the far northern and southern ranges. The southern marbled newt is typically found in Mediterranean oak forests. In the absence of forests, other cover-rich habitats, as for example hedgerows, scrub, swampy meadows, or quarries, can be inhabited. Within such habitats, the newts use hiding places such as logs, bark, planks, stone walls, or small mammal burrows; several individuals may occupy such refuges at the same time. Since the newts in general stay very close to their aquatic breeding sites, {{the quality of the}} surrounding terrestrial habitat largely determines whether an otherwise suitable water body will be colonised.|$|E
5|$|The F-22 was {{designed}} to be highly <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>detect</b> and track by radar. Measures to reduce radar cross-section include airframe shaping such as alignment of edges, fixed-geometry serpentine inlets that prevent line-of-sight of the engine faces from any exterior view, use of radar-absorbent material (RAM), and attention to detail such as hinges and pilot helmets that could provide a radar return. The F-22 was also designed to have decreased radio emissions, infrared signature and acoustic signature as well as reduced visibility to the naked eye. The aircraft's flat thrust-vectoring nozzle reduces infrared emissions to mitigate the threat of infrared homing ("heat seeking") surface-to-air or air-to-air missiles. Additional measures to reduce the infrared signature include special paint and active cooling of leading edges to manage the heat buildup from supersonic flight.|$|E
5|$|The strongest {{clues to}} the {{function}} of the cerebellum have come from examining the consequences of damage to it. Animals and humans with cerebellar dysfunction show, above all, problems with motor control, {{on the same side of}} the body as the damaged part of the cerebellum. They continue to be able to generate motor activity but lose precision, producing erratic, uncoordinated, or incorrectly timed movements. A standard test of cerebellar function is to reach with the tip of the finger for a target at arm's length: A healthy person will move the fingertip in a rapid straight trajectory, whereas a person with cerebellar damage will reach slowly and erratically, with many mid-course corrections. Deficits in non-motor functions are more <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>detect.</b> Thus, the general conclusion reached decades ago is that the basic function of the cerebellum is to calibrate the detailed form of a movement, not to initiate movements or to decide which movements to execute.|$|E
