40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{performance of}} the knock detection technique typically used in engine control systems, and the margin for possible improvement. We introduce a knock signal model and obtain an analytical result for the associated receiver operating characteristic of the standard <b>knock</b> <b>detector.</b> To show the improvement potential, we derive the theoretical upper bound of performance. A special case with unknown model parameters is also considered. Numerical results stimulate the research of improved detectors...|$|E
40|$|It is {{well known}} that spark advance is a key {{parameter}} in spark ignition engine management. Increasing fuel cost and emission regulation strictness require a higher engine efficiency, which can be improved by an accurate regulation of the spark advance. Under high load conditions, an optimal spark advance choice leads the engine to run next to the knock limit, so the management and control system needs to be equipped with a knock sensor in order to preserve the engine from damage. The authors developed a low-cost knock sensor whose sensing element is a thin washer of polyvinylidine fluoride (PVDF), a fluoropolymer characterized by a great piezoelectric effect if polarized. The sensor has been tested on a spark ignition CFR engine (the standard single-cylinder test engine used by ASTM for octane number determination of spark ignition engine fuel) and compared with a commercial accelerometer and a pressure sensor, in terms of knocking detection capability, measured knock intensity (KI) and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Knocking tests have also been carried out on a Renault series production engine. The collected data show that PVDF ensures a reliable detection of knock, a precise measurement of knock energy and accurate information about the frequency content of the perceived vibration. The sensor worked for several hours without depolarizing and, above all, owing to the great piezoelectric effect of PVDF, the use of a charge amplifier was unnecessary. PVDF proved to have great potential as a <b>knock</b> <b>detector</b> in spark ignition engines at a very low cost...|$|E
40|$|Proof-mass {{actuators}} {{are typically}} used to supply a secondary control force to a supporting {{structure for the}} purpose of improving its performance through active vibration control. These devices comprise a magnetic proof-mass that accelerates in response to an input current, and the resulting inertia provides a reaction force on the actuator casing and the structure itself. Due to design constraints and the need to prevent actuator damage, the displacement of the proof-mass is usually bounded by its stroke length, which is determined by the distance between the actuator end stops. If the proof-mass reaches the end of the stroke, it will collide with the end stops, thereby imparting large shocks to the supporting structure that may destabilise the closed-loop system. This phenomenon, known as stroke saturation, is strongly nonlinear and invalidates the linear Nyquist stability criterion, which significantly complicates the assessment of closed-loop stability. As an example, stroke saturation may occur when using proof-mass actuators in active car suspensions, due to large impulsive forces from the road. The aim of this thesis is to examine the dynamical behaviour of several proof-mass actuators using experimental measurements, including the effects of stroke saturation and other nonlinearities. The experimental data is used to establish a Simulink model of an inertial actuator by applying nonlinear identifcation techniques. It is found that the actuator dynamics can be represented using a nonlinear single-degree-of-freedom system, where the actuator nonlinearities are modelled using various polynomial and piecewise terms. This is conformed by comparing the model results with the experimental data. Using the Simulink model, it is shown that the actuator nonlinearities significantly reduce the closed-loop gain margin by exploiting regions of potential instability that are present in the underlying linear closed-loop system. Therefore, the relationship between the actuator nonlinearities and the closed-loop stability depends on the choice of underlying linear controller, as the actuator nonlinearities tend to accentuate underlying stability issues rather than induce instability by themselves. To prevent stroke saturation from destabilising the closed-loop system, an on-off control law may be applied by implementing a <b>knock</b> <b>detector</b> and deactivating the control signal for a short time period once stroke saturation is detected. Provided that a suitable deactivation period is specified, the on-off control law is able to prevent stroke saturation from destabilising the closed-loop system, thereby increasing the closed-loop gain margin...|$|E
40|$|Variable {{compression}} {{engines are}} a mean {{to meet the}} demand on lower fuel consumption. A high compression ratio results in high engine efficiency, but also increases the knock tendency. On conventional engines with fixed compression ratio, knock is avoided by retarding the ignition angle. The variable compression engine offers an extra dimension in knock control, since both ignition angle and compression ratio can be adjusted. The central question is thus for what combination of compression ratio and ignition angle the maximum efficiency is achieved, considering the set of compression ratios and ignition angles that give a sufficiently low knock intensity. Four knock detection methods are proposed, compared and evaluated with respect to robustness for noise and choices of parameter values. Three of the <b>knock</b> <b>detectors</b> are categorised as on-line, and are designed for giving feedback about knock occurrence to the engine control unit. The methods can determine both whether or not knock is present and the crank angle at knock onset. A study of the relationship between knock oscillation properties and knock-onset is performed. It is concluded that the logarithm of the normalised knock energy depends almost linearly on the rate of knock occurrence. A new formulation of multi-zone engine models is presented. The formulation makes it easy to increase or decrease the number of zones during the simulation. One of many possible applications is the investigation of engine efficiency. An analysis of experimental data shows how the engine efficiency changes with compression ratio and ignition angle. An engine torque model is developed and validated, from which the optimal choice of compression ratio and ignition angle can be calculated with high accuracy...|$|R
40|$|This {{project has}} {{documented}} and demonstrated {{the feasibility of}} technologies and operational choices for companies who operate the large installed fleet of integral engine compressors in pipeline service. Continued operations of this fleet is required to meet the projected growth of the U. S. gas market. Applying project results will meet {{the goals of the}} DOE-NETL Natural Gas Infrastructure program to enhance integrity, extend life, improve efficiency, and increase capacity, while managing NOx emissions. These benefits will translate into lower cost, more reliable gas transmission, and options for increasing deliverability from the existing infrastructure on high demand days. The power cylinders on large bore slow-speed integral engine/compressors do not in general combust equally. Variations in cylinder pressure between power cylinders occur cycle-to-cycle. These variations affect both individual cylinder performance and unit average performance. The magnitude of the variations in power cylinder combustion is dependent on a variety of parameters, including air/fuel ratio. Large variations in cylinder performance and peak firing pressure can lead to detonation and misfires, both of which can be damaging to the unit. Reducing the variation in combustion pressure, and moving the high and low performing cylinders closer to the mean is the goal of engine balancing. The benefit of improving the state of the engine ''balance'' is a small reduction in heat rate and a significant reduction in both crankshaft strain and emissions. A new method invented {{during the course of this}} project is combustion pressure ratio (CPR) balancing. This method is more effective than current methods because it naturally accounts for differences in compression pressure, which results from cylinder-to-cylinder differences in the amount of air flowing through the inlet ports and trapped at port closure. It also helps avoid compensation for low compression pressure by the addition of excess fuel to achieve equalizing peak firing pressure, even if some of the compression pressure differences are attributed to differences in cylinder and piston geometry, clearance, and kinematics. The combination of high-pressure fuel injection and turbocharging should produce better mixing of fuel and air in lean mixtures. Test results documented modest improvements in heat rate and efficiency and significant improvements in emissions. The feasibility of a closed-loop control of waste-gate setting, which will maintain an equivalence ratio set point, has been demonstrated. This capability allows more direct tuning to enhance combustion stability, heat rate, or emissions. The project has documented the strong dependence of heat rate on load. The feasibility of directly measuring power and torque using the GMRC Rod Load Monitor (RLM) has been demonstrated. This capability helps to optimize heat rate while avoiding overload. The crankshaft Strain Data Capture Module (SDCM) has shown the sensitivity to changes in operating conditions and how they influence crankshaft bending strain. The results indicate that: balancing reduces the frequency of high-strain excursions, advanced timing directly increases crankshaft dynamic strain, reduced speed directly reduces strain, and high-pressure fuel injection reduces crankshaft strain slightly. The project demonstrated that when the timing is advanced, the heat rate is reduced, and when the timing is retarded, the heat rate is increased. One reason why timing is not advanced as much as it might be is the potential for detonation on hot days. A low-cost <b>knock</b> <b>detector</b> was demonstrated that allowed active control to use timing to allow the heat rate benefit to be realized safely. High flow resistance losses in the pulsation control systems installed on some compressors have been shown to hurt efficiency of both compressor and engine/compressor system. Improved pulsation control systems have the potential to recover almost 10 % of available engine power. Integrity enhancements and reduced component failure probability will enhance aggregate deliverability. In addition to improving the efficiency of fuel conversion, all increases in compressor efficiency will reduce the fraction of available engine power that must go to overcome losses and, thereby, will add to deliverability. Project results confirm an earlier survey of a large range of compressor efficiency. If the bottom half of the efficiency range is upgraded with improved technology, such that the resulting performance approaches the best documented efficiency, the aggregate system-wide capacity could be increased by 10 % with no new installed compression. An additional phase was added to the original scope of work to investigate the perceived imbalance in airflow between power cylinders in two-stroke integral compressor engines...|$|E
