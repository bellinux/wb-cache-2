The recent advent of modularity in many universities has resulted in an increase ofthe complexity of the problem, making the manual achievement of an acceptable solution a tedious andsometimes almost impossible problem. Examination scheduling is the process of assigning exams totime slots in a predetermined period of time and, simultaneously, to assign rooms and invigilators toeach exam, satisfying a set of different constraints. This includes avoiding <b>double</b> <b>bookings</b> for rooms,teachers and students, room capacity and type constraints, exam sequence and spreading constraints,preassignments and availability of resources.

40|$|Switch {{allocation}} and queuing discipline has a first-order {{impact on}} network performance and hence overall system performance. Unfortunately, {{there is a}} fundamental tension between quality of switch allocation and clock-speed. On one hand, sophisticated switch allocators such as iSLIP include dependencies that make pipelining hard. On the other hand, simpler allocators which are pipelineable (and hence amenable to fast clocks) degrade throughput. This paper proposes apSLIP which uses three novel ideas to adaptively pipeline iSLIP at fast clocks. To address the dependence between the grant and request stages in iSLIP, we allow superfluous requests to occur and leverage the VOQ architecture which naturally enables easy availing of the corresponding grants. To address the dependence between the reading and updating of priority counters in iSLIP, we use stale priority values and solve the resulting <b>double</b> <b>booking</b> by privatizing the priority counters and separating the arbitration into odd and even stream. Further, we observe that while iSLIP can exploit multiple iterations to improve its matching strength, such additional iterations deepen the pipeline and add to the network latency. The improved matching strength helps high-load scenarios whereas the increased latency hurts low-load cases. Therefore, we propose an adaptive-effort pipelined iSLIP – apSLIP – which adapts between one iteration (shallow-pipeline) at low loads and two iterations (deep pipeline) at high loads. Simulations reveal that compared to an aggressive 2 -cycle router apSLIP improves, on average, end-to-end packet latency in an 8 x 8 network by 43 % and high-load application performance in a 3 x 3 network by 19 % without affecting the low-load benchmarks...|$|E

The organization must be efficiently schedule the staff to meet the continuous and potentially changing business demands. Staff scheduling becomes challenging when the need to balance various personnel shifts and try to accommodate their preferences. In our report, we have attempted to address the lifeguard scheduling problem at Shute Park Aquatic and Recreation Center (SHARC). The aquatic center offers a variety of classes all year around for all age groups. The lifeguards and swim instructors are part-time employees and mostly students, over 16 years of age. The primary metrics used to schedule lifeguard staff are availability of personnel, avoid <b>double</b> <b>booking</b> when already working in other areas of SHARC, gender diversity, performance, and assessment by supervisor based on previous history. There are situations of last minute cancellations and thus a substitute has to be scheduled for those emergency situations. Currently the SHARC manager uses Microsoft Word for scheduling lifeguards. This paper attempts to propose a scheduling tool based on excel to cope with the emergency substitute scheduling of the lifeguards and document the process rather than relying on a person’s memory. Through this paper we attempt the following: 1) To address the issue of last minute scheduling and find a reliable person to cover. 2) To develop a model that be used for automation of life guard scheduling process. 3) To provide an Excel based program replacing the current word based for automated scheduling at no extra cost. 4) To achieve scheduling of personnel at least cost...|$|E

50|$|However, some of {{the very}} first online {{calendars}} that were developed did not perform too well as online diary planners. Though they were impressive enough initially with their multifaceted social networking abilities, they could not manage to impress their users {{over a long period of}} time. They helped users to add appointments straightaway. Users did not need to sort through dropdown menus to choose meeting dates and times. That way, the online calendars functioned like secretaries. Users just had to key their meeting schedules into the application and the online diary planner would flash the data and remind them in time. But users soon began to be put off with these first-generation online calendars. They complained that they could view only one-month’s appointments on the calendar. Which means if they wanted to schedule a conference over one month away, they would be unable to do so because the application allowed viewing a calendar only 30 days at a time. Also, if users set a meeting date that was far in the future, months from the date on which the details were entered, the online calendar would not show the details until and unless that month arrived. This disadvantage of the initially launched online calendars became a bane for most users. Then, there was the privacy issue. Such open calendars that intended users to connect with as many people as they could meant that others would be able to view the users’ calendars. Moreover, these online diary planners were unable to warn their users if more than one appointment was made within the same time slot. In other words, they could not prevent <b>double</b> <b>bookings.</b> Further, many people found the idea of an online calendar weird because they felt that it is impossible to access the Internet everywhere!

40|$|BACKGROUND: Non-attended {{appointments}} have {{impacts on}} the operations of dental clinics. These impacts vary from lost productivity, loss of income and loss of clinical teaching hours. METHODS: Appointment data were analysed to assess the percentage of completed, failed to attend (FTA) and cancelled appointments at an Australian remote rural student dental clinic training facility. The demographic and time characteristics of FTA and cancelled appointments were analysed using simple and multivariate multinomial regression analysis, to inform interventions that may be necessary. RESULTS: Over the 2 -year study period a total of 3, 042 appointments were made. The percentage of FTA was 21. 3 % (N[*]=[*] 648) and cancelled appointments 13. 7 % (N[*]=[*] 418). The odds of an FTA were in excess of 4 times higher in patients aged 19 - 25  years (OR[*]=[*] 4. 1; 95 % CI[*]=[*] 2. 3 - 7. 3) and 26 - 35  years (OR[*]=[*] 4. 4; 95 % CI[*]=[*] 2. 5 - 7. 9) compared to patients 65  years and older. The odds of an FTA was 2. 3 (95 % CI[*]=[*] 1. 8 - 3. 1) times higher in public patients compared to private patients. The odds of a cancellation was 1. 7 (95 % CI[*]=[*] 1. 1 - 2. 6) times higher on a Friday compared to a Monday and 1. 8 (95 % CI[*]=[*] 1. 1 - 2. 9) times higher on the last appointment of the day compared to the first appointment.

40|$|Delay {{in the air}} {{transport}} occurs when passengers, baggage or cargo do not arrive at their destination at the time indicated in the contract of carriage. The causes of delay in the carriage of passengers are booking errors or <b>double</b> <b>booking,</b> delayed departure of aircraft, incorrect information regarding the time of departure, failure to land at the scheduled destination and changes in flight schedule or addition of extra landing stops. Delay in the carriage of baggage or cargo may have different causes: no reservation, lack of space, failure to load the baggage or cargo at the right place, or to deliver the covering documents at the right place. The Montreal Convention of 1999 Article 19 provides that 'The carrier is liable for damage occasioned by delay in the carriage by air of passengers, baggage or cargo. Nevertheless, the carder shall not be liable for damage occasioned by delay if it proves that it and its servants and agents took all measures that could reasonably be required to avoid the damage or {{that it was impossible}} for it or them to take such measures'. The Montreal Convention Article 22 provides liability limits of the carrier in case of delay for passengers and their baggage and for cargo. In the carriage of persons, the liability of the carrier for each passenger is limited to 4, 150 SDR. In the carriage of baggage, the liability of the carrier is limited to 1, 000 SDR for each passenger unless a special declaration as to the value of the baggage has been made. In the carriage of cargo, the liability of the carrier is limited to 17 SDR per kilogram unless a special declaration as to the value of the cargo has been made.

40|$|The new {{possibilities}} offered by information & communication technologies (ICTs) within the work-place and elsewhere have attracted wide attention by {{economic and social}} actors. One outcome is the institutional ‘push’ for all businesses to embrace these technologies and ‘get online’. However, {{it is evident that}} take-up amongst businesses has been highly uneven with some cautious in their adoption and, thus, many have not fully exploited the possibilities offered. To understand this variety in the adoption and use of online technologies (which in some cases includes their nonadoption and non-use) it is necessary to examine practices and establish underlying dynamics surrounding new forms of ICTs. This thesis will investigate the practices associated with the adoption and use of ICTs in the hotel industry. Three basic questions are addressed. The first relates the online practices of hoteliers, including the use of online intermediary services, the nature of uptake and the implications for both practices and relations with customers. The second relates to any externalities which condition a hotelier’s practices. The third is concerned with how to conceptual explain observations – findings. Investigation of these questions has resulted in an empirically rich study. This has involved a multi-method approach that allows online practices to be viewed through different lenses and from an adapted Social Shaping of Technology perspective. The population of Scottish serviced accommodation providers was compiled and used to determine the uptake of online practice. Interviews revealed specific practices. Published material provided insight into contextual issues, particularly those relating to institutional developments. The research shows that there were three principle strategies for the adoption of the new technologies. First, they were embedded by the users themselves (‘internalisation’) – often through much effort and processes of configuration – into their ‘busy day’. The process of ‘learning’ (or learning by trying) was found to be an integral feature of uptake. Secondly, some users opted for an alternative solution where, rather than design their own website, they adopted the offerings of online intermediaries (such as online booking facilities) (‘intermediation’). However, the appropriation of online intermediation was found to be both costly and fraught with new kinds of risks (e. g. <b>double</b> <b>bookings)</b> and uncertainty (e. g. no guarantees of bookings). Thirdly, a further option (‘localisation’) was for local groups of hoteliers to collectively produce an online presence that promotes the locality and thereby indirectly provides benefits to their businesses. The analysis was performed using a modified version of Silverstone’s (1992) ‘domestication’ framework. However, ‘localisation’ questioned the assumptions underpinning ‘domestication’, suggesting the need for a more sophisticated analytical device, such as offered by the metaphor of ‘tailoring’. It is concluded that the apparently deterministic institutional view of the benefit of online technologies and the imperative that they are fully exploited to give competitive advantage, can be at odds with the locally contingent and diverse nature of online practices. The research found that the new online practices did not entirely replace traditional ones, but emerged as complementary to them...|$|R
