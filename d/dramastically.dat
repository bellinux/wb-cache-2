In this study, {{composite}} metastable (Ti 0. 5 Al 0. 5) N, (Ti 0. 475 Al 0. 475 Nb 0. 05) N and (Ti 0. 45 Al 0. 45 Nb 0. 1) N coatings were respectively {{deposited on}} a wrought martensite steel 1 Cr 11 Ni 2 W 2 MoV by arc ion plating technique. All coatings possessed a dense structure, although droplets existed {{on the surface}} of the coatings. It was identified by XRD that the phase structure of all the coatings was the same B 1 NaCl with a small mount of Îµ phase. Oxidation-resistance of (Ti,Al,Nb) N coatings at 800 oC for up to 50 hr was investigated and the results showed that the introduction of niobium into the coatings <b>dramastically</b> improved the oxidation-resistance of the coatings in air. (Ti 0. 45 Al 0. 45 Nb 0. 1) N possessed more excellent oxidation-resistance than (Ti 0. 475 Al 0. 475 Nb 0. 05) N...|$|E
