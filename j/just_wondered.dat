My word! it was sickening, especially that kind of school-treat swing and bump at the end. I never could bear swinging. Still, it was all for the best, as I shouldn't have gone a yard along that sphinx's tail without tumbling off, tight-rope walking not being in my line; and I'll tell you what, you are just the best three fellows in the whole world.

5000|$|On 15 March, Oscar Whisky {{was moved}} up in {{distance}} {{to contest the}} World Hurdle over three miles at Cheltenham. He was made the 4/1 second favourite behind Big Buck's, who was attempting to win {{the race for the}} fourth consecutive year. He tracked the favourite for much of the race but weakened in the closing stages and finished fifth behind Big Buck's, beaten thirteen lengths by the winner. In April, Oscar Whisky was matched against the 2012 Champion Hurdler Rock On Ruby and the 2011 Triumph Hurdle winner Zarkandar as he attempted to win his second Aintree Hurdle. He tracked the leader Rock On Ruby before taking the lead after the second last. As in 2011, Thousand Stars emerged as his most serious challenger, and as in the previous year, Oscar Whisky prevailed by a neck after a prolonged struggle. After the race Henderson explained that the horse had returned very tired and [...] "wobbly" [...] after his run in the World Hurdle, adding [...] "I <b>just</b> <b>wondered</b> if we had enough time to get him back. The boys have done brilliantly at home. They help me with them so much and it's thanks to them. To get him back after what happened at Cheltenham was tremendous". Dai Walters described the result as [...] "a dream come true".|$|E

40|$|If {{you have}} taught Religious Education in a Catholic {{secondary}} school, {{then you may}} have {{sat down at the}} end of the class or the school day and <b>just</b> <b>wondered</b> why you bothered. Before reading this article further, give yourself a few moments to reflect on this question: “What for you is the best and most special about teaching Religious Education?” How did you answer the question? Was your response negative or positive? Did you reach for the instant cynical remark, “When I finished teaching the class!” Or, did you imagine yourself taking great pride in accomplishing deeper understandings among your students? Maybe your response was one of mixed feelings. These responses are important because the disposition of a teacher towards his or her RE teaching is a key factor in the quality of Religious Education provided to secondary students in Catholic schools. This article outlines the findings of the second phase of a study about the teaching experiences of recently assigned RE teachers and the resultant changes in their outlook about RE teaching...|$|E
