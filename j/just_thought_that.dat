500|$|Writing for Rough Guides in 2006, Chris Ingham said Harrison was [...] "rightly annoyed" [...] {{with his}} former record company. Ingham added that, with the [...] "excellent Volume II" [...] (Best of Dark Horse 1976–1989) no longer in print, The Best of George Harrison was {{therefore}} the artist's only available compilation album and [...] "hardly a satisfying one-stop sampler". Reviewing Let It Roll for the music website Popdose, in 2009, Jon Cummings wrote that [...] "the compilation gods have never been kind to [...] " [...] and described the 1976 album as [...] "downright insulting". In her role as compiler of Let It Roll, Harrison's widow Olivia said of The Best of George Harrison: [...] "That album always bothered me... I <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> is really not fair and I {{think we have to}} put something in that place, and that's really what this [...] is." ...|$|E
500|$|The album {{includes}} one acoustic song, [...] "Hero of War", {{which is}} about an Iraq War Veteran looking back on his war experiences. It is described by Rolling Stone as an [...] "ambivalent aggro-folk track". McIlrath said of the song, [...] "I {{wanted to take the}} perspective [...] of 'What is the war going to be looked back on as?'" [...] In another interview McIlrath stated, [...] "It was a way to document what's going on, like other artists documented for their generation and for generations to come." [...] He went on to say, [...] "There are not many songs...talking about what's going on during eight years of occupation in Iraq. That, combined with meeting active soldiers and retired soldiers at our shows and hearing those stories {{about what is going on}} on the ground amid all the bullshit, showed me the differences from what is really happening to what is happening in the news media. I <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> this needed to go into a song." ...|$|E

Weiss {{revealed that the}} closing scene involving Hodor's name origin and subsequent death was an idea that was presented to them directly from George R. R. Martin. Benioff stated, [...] "We had this meeting with George Martin where we're trying {{to get as much}} information as possible out of him, and probably the most shocking revelation he had for us was when he told us the origin of Hodor and how that name came about. I just remember Dan and I looking at each other when he said that and just being like, 'Holy shit.'" [...] Weiss continued, [...] "It {{was just one of the}} saddest and most affecting things. Even sitting in a hotel room having someone tell you this was going to happen in the abstract in some way and that 'hold the door' was the origin of the name Hodor, we <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> was a really, really heart-breaking idea." ...|$|E
5000|$|Apple {{said that}} with the song, she wanted to explore {{different}} moods and the [...] "ups and downs" [...] of a relationship. [...] "When {{you get to the}} middle the song, that spell of confusion takes you out of the element for a minute, which is, of course, what happens emotionally. But the beat never changes." [...] Apple said the song is [...] "really <b>just</b> <b>thoughts</b> <b>that</b> were running through my head that were in that rhythm".|$|R

"I {{wrote the}} initial idea for 'One Sweet Day' with Walter, and I had the chorus...and I stopped and said, 'I really wanna {{do this with}} Boyz II Men,' because...obviously I'm {{a big fan of}} theirs and I <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> the work was crying out for them, the vocals that they do, so I put it away and said, 'Who knows if this could ever happen, but I just don't wanna finish this song because I want it to be our song if we ever do it together. [...] whole idea of when you lose people that are close to you, it changes your life and changes your perspective. When they came into the studio, I played them the idea for the song and when [...] was finished, they looked at each other, a bit stunned, and told me that Nathan [...] "Nate" [...] Morris had written a song for his road manager who had passed away. It had {{basically}} the same lyrics and fitted over the same chord changes. It was really, really weird, we finished the song right then and there. We were all kinda flipped about it ourselves. Fate {{had a lot to do}} with that. I know some people won't believe it, but we wouldn't make up such a crazy story." ...|$|E
500|$|Two {{weeks prior}} to the group {{starting}} university, they decided that they would take a second gap year, and perform new material which the band felt did not suit their current outfit. Cave stated that [...] "I felt as though I couldn't write about anything personal, so I would make up semi-comical stories that weren't really important to anyone, not even me." [...] Fear of Flying disbanded in October 2007 with a MySpace bulletin stating [...] "Fear of Flying is DEAD ... White Lies is alive!", before introducing a darker sound and a new name that reflected their maturity. Cave stated that the band deleted their MySpace account [...] "without any token farewell gigs". McVeigh said that the current musical climate {{had an effect on}} the split, stating that [...] "Maybe a few years ago, we would have signed a deal and had a chance to make three albums [...] In the current climate...we’d have been dropped". When asked about the name change in an interview with a radio station in San Francisco, Jack Brown said that [...] "We <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> we should perform these songs as a different band. We had songs that we felt weren't suitable for the band that we were in and we thought White Lies would be the perfect vehicle for the songs." ...|$|E
500|$|On 14 October 2005 Eon Productions, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Sony Pictures Entertainment {{announced}} {{at a press}} conference in London that Daniel Craig would be the sixth actor to portray Bond in the Eon series (although seventh film Bond overall). A tuxedo- and lifejacket-clad Craig arrived via a Royal Navy speedboat. Craig had based his acceptance of the role on the strength of the script for the first film, Casino Royale; he later recalled that [...] "once I sat down and read the story, I <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> I wanted to tell ... I'm a big Bond fan, and I love what he represents". Significant controversy followed the decision, with some critics and fans expressing doubt the producers had made the right choice. Throughout the entire production period, Internet campaigns such as danielcraigisnotbond.com expressed their dissatisfaction and threatened to boycott the film in protest. Craig, unlike previous actors, was not considered by the protesters to fit the tall, dark, handsome and charismatic image of Bond to which viewers had been accustomed. Many disparagingly called him [...] "James Blonde", believing the [...] blond-haired blue-eyed rugged Craig to be far fitting from the traditional tall, dark and suave actors who had earlier portrayed him. The Daily Mirror ran a front-page news story critical of Craig, with the headline, The Name's Bland – James Bland.|$|E
5000|$|... "Strawberry Kisses" [...] is a pop song {{written by}} Jeff Franzel, Andy Marvel and Marjorie Maye, {{produced}} by Chong Lim for Nikki Webster's first album Follow Your Heart (2001). It was released as the album's first single on 11 June 2001 in Australia and 27 May 2002 in the UK as a CD single. Webster states the song as being [...] "fresh, really bright and chirpy". To this date, it is number 2 on the List of Top 25 singles for 2001 in Australia. She also states [...] "After I {{first heard the}} demo, I was singing it that night and I <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that's</b> a fantastic sign of a good song - something people remember".|$|R

He said, in a 1997 interview, [...] "I <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> 'fuck <b>that,</b> I can't be singing this song' and I had to go away and sort myself out". Listening back to the song he admits to being very proud of his vocal performance.|$|R
2500|$|The {{arrival of}} the Butcher family in May 1988 {{signified}} an {{end of an era}} for the soap, as Den and Angie Watts (Leslie Grantham and Anita Dobson) vacated their positions as landlord and landlady of The Queen Victoria public house, leaving Frank (Mike Reid), and his girlfriend Pat Wicks (Pam St. Clement) to take over tenancy. Ricky (Sid Owen) and Diane, played by Sophie Lawrence, Frank's teenage children came with Frank. Lawrence was 15 at the time, and she got the part in EastEnders straight after leaving stage school. Lawrence has commented, [...] "I always <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> I would be a dancer and go into a West End musical and that I would be very, very happy. Then I got EastEnders when I was 15 and it kind of changed my life." ...|$|E
2500|$|At Christmas in 1956, Townes's {{father gave}} him a guitar, which he practiced while {{wandering}} the countryside. He would later tell an interviewer that [...] "watching Elvis Presley's October 28, 1956, performance on The Ed Sullivan Show was {{the starting point for}} me becoming a guitar player... I <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> Elvis had {{all the money in the}} world, all the Cadillacs and all the girls, and all he did was play the guitar and sing. That made a big impression on me." [...] In 1958 the family moved to Boulder, Colorado. Van Zandt would remember his time in Colorado fondly and would often visit it as an adult. He would later refer to Colorado in [...] "My Proud Mountains", [...] "Colorado Girl", and [...] "Snowin' On Raton". Townes was a good student and active in team sports. In grade school, he received a high IQ score and his parents began grooming him to become a lawyer or senator. Fearing that his family would move again, he willingly decided to attend the Shattuck School, Faribault, Minnesota. He received a score of 1170 when he took the SAT in January 1962. His family soon moved to Houston, Texas.|$|E

That's all I wanted {{to put in the}} song. I <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> was so gangsta. It was kind of weird, too, now that I really think about it. She used to take her bullets out of the gun and leave the clip in her room and let me play with her gun. I was an only child so I probably got on her nerves that much that she finally gave me her burner, like, 'Here, get the fuck out my face.' [...] I {{just wanted to say that}} so bad." [...] He also added on how he incorporated one of his neighborhood friends on to the record: [...] " [...] speak on my homeboy Rat Tone. He's one of my big homies from my hood. He showed me my first [...] when I was like 11-years-old. I was amazed by it. I thought that shit was tight. They used to have all the shiny shit. That's how we talked. We would call a gun 'fly.'

Chazelle has shared screenplay credit with director Ed Gass-Donnelly on The Last Exorcism Part II, 2013. He is also credited as the screenwriter on 2013's Grand Piano, a thriller that has an anxious pianist dealing with a death threat during a concert. Chazelle has stated in interviews that he was working as a 'writer for hire' but had the ambition to direct his own script. Chazelle described Whiplash as a writing reaction to being stuck on another script. 'I <b>just</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>that's</b> not working, let me put it away and write this thing about being a jazz drummer in high school.' He stated he initially did not want to show the script around, as it felt too personal, and [...] "I put it in a drawer." ...|$|R

2500|$|Mercy {{is one of}} four {{characters}} {{created by}} a team of 13 writers aged between 17 and 22 for the Internet spin-off series EastEnders: E20. The characters were created in August 2009 and open auditions were held for the cast at Theatre Royal Stratford East. Mojekwu's casting was announced on 25 November 2009, on which she commented: [...] "I feel so blessed to be part of EastEnders: E20. My first day on set was just crazy. I was on Albert Square—a dream come true—I'm enjoying every second." [...] When Mojekwu was asked in an interview with media website Digital Spy how she felt about being the only main cast member from EastEnders: E20 not appearing in EastEnders, she said: [...] "If I was meant to go into the main show, then I would have done. Obviously I'd have loved to but for someone like my character, it'll be the support of the viewers that decide her fate. I don't feel upset or anything, I <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> it's the way these things go." [...] It was announced on 24 January 2010 that Mercy would appear in EastEnders later in 2010. Executive producer Diederick Santer said that once he had seen the completed episodes of EastEnders: E20, he wanted Mercy in the main show as well, and stated: [...] "Mercy's also been a huge hit with E20 viewers—she's funny, warm, sensitive and rather mysterious. [...] I'm delighted Bunmi will be bringing those qualities to the wider EastEnders audience." [...] Mercy and her grandmother Grace's introduction to EastEnders made them the first Nigerian family to appear in the series. Mojekwu was surprised at how long it took the programme to represent her community in the series, but congratulated them for doing so, saying [...] "they {{have a long way to}} go in representing us." [...] Mercy's younger sister Faith Olubunmi was introduced in series 3 of E20.|$|E
2500|$|Rabbi Simeon the Just was so {{skeptical of}} the reasons for which nazirites might have {{interrupted}} their status that he found only one that he really trusted. He said that only once in his life had he eaten of the trespass-offering brought by a defiled tear in connection with an interrupted nazirite vow. On that occasion a nazirite came from the South country, and Simeon the Just saw that he had beautiful eyes, was of handsome appearance, and with thick locks of hair symmetrically arranged. Simeon the Just asked him what reason the nazirite had seen to destroy this beautiful hair by shaving it for the nazirite vow. The nazirite replied that he was a shepherd for his father and once he went to draw water from a well and gazed upon his reflection in the water, and his evil desires rushed upon him and sought to drive him from the world through sin. But the shepherd swore that day that he would shave his beautiful hair off for the sake of Heaven. Simeon the Just immediately arose and kissed the nazirite's head, praying that there would be many nazirites such as him in Israel. And Simeon the Just said that it was of this nazirite that [...] says, [...] "When either {{a man or a woman}} shall separate themselves to vow a vow of a nazirite, to separate themselves unto the Lord ..." [...] Rabbi Mani inquired why Simeon the Just did not eat of the guilt-offering of a nazirite. If it was because the nazirite was a sinner because he tormented himself, depriving himself of wine, that would be inconsistent with ever eating of the sin-offering (for example) for tasting forbidden fat or of the sin-offering for tasting blood. Simeon the <b>Just</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> people made the nazirite vow in a fit of temper, and since they vowed in a fit of temper they would ultimately come to regret it. And once they regretted it, their sacrifices become like those of people who slaughtered unconsecrated animals in the Temple court (which would be disrespectful and forbidden). This nazirite, however, vowed after due mental deliberation and his mouth and heart were in agreement.|$|E

500|$|Colin Greenwood {{admitted}} that the band, in attempting to make the disparate elements work together, [...] "felt like irresponsible schoolboys who were doing this... naughty thing, 'cause nobody does a six-and-a-half-minute song with all these changes. It's ridiculous". The song was at first intended to be humorous, and took its title from Marvin the Paranoid Android in Douglas Adams' The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series of books. Yorke said the title [...] "was chosen as a joke. It was like, 'Oh, I'm so depressed.' And I <b>just</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>that's</b> great. That's how people would like me to be. And {{that was the end}} of writing about anything personal in the song. The rest of the song is not personal at all." [...] In an early interview, Colin Greenwood described it [...] "just a joke, a laugh, getting wasted together over a couple of evenings and putting some different pieces together". The band used Queen's [...] "Bohemian Rhapsody" [...] and the work of the Pixies as reference points while writing; yet Ed O'Brien denies they wrote [...] "a 'Bohemian Rhapsody' for the nineties", and Jonny Greenwood considers it too tense and simple to rival Queen's song.|$|R
