5|$|In {{response}} to cellular stresses– such as infection, <b>heat</b> <b>shock,</b> or oxidative damage– <b>heat</b> <b>shock</b> proteins that identify misfolded or unfolded proteins and target them for proteasomal degradation are expressed. Both Hsp27 and Hsp90—chaperone proteins have {{been implicated in}} increasing {{the activity of the}} ubiquitin-proteasome system, though they are not direct participants in the process. Hsp70, on the other hand, binds exposed hydrophobic patches on the surface of misfolded proteins and recruits E3 ubiquitin ligases such as CHIP to tag the proteins for proteasomal degradation. The CHIP protein (carboxyl terminus of Hsp70-interacting protein) is itself regulated via inhibition of interactions between the E3 enzyme CHIP and its E2 binding partner.|$|E

40|$|Washed spores of Dictyostelium discoideum, strains NC- 4 H, NC- 4 D, and V- 12, germinated rapidly {{after being}} <b>heat</b> <b>shocked</b> {{at or near}} 45. 0 C for 30 min. Cultures of the slime molds were grown in {{association}} with Escherichia coli B/r as the host bacterium; spores taken from plates of synthetic medium had a higher final germination value than spores from complex medium containing peptone and yeast extract. Young spores germinated more rapidly than older spores. Optimal germination occurred between pH 6. 0 and 7. 0, and, of the buffers tested, potassium phosphate allowed the most rapid germination.

5|$|An RNA {{thermometer}} (or RNA thermosensor) is a temperature-sensitive non-coding RNA molecule which regulates gene expression. RNA thermometers often regulate genes required during {{either a}} <b>heat</b> <b>shock</b> or cold shock response, {{but have been}} implicated in other regulatory roles such as in pathogenicity and starvation.|$|E
5|$|Most known RNA {{thermometers}} {{are located}} in the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of messenger RNA encoding <b>heat</b> <b>shock</b> proteins—though it has been suggested this fact may be due, in part, to sampling bias and inherent difficulties of detecting short, unconserved RNA sequences in genomic data.|$|E

5|$|Though {{predominantly}} {{found in}} prokaryotes, a potential RNA thermometer {{has been found}} in mammals including humans. The candidate thermosensor <b>heat</b> <b>shock</b> RNA-1 (HSR1) activates heat-shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1) and induces protective proteins when cell temperature exceeds 37°C (body temperature), thus preventing the cells from overheating.|$|E
5|$|A {{specific}} {{example of}} an RNA thermometer motif is the FourU thermometer found in Salmonella enterica. When exposed to temperatures above 45°C, the stem-loop that base-pairs opposite the Shine-Dalgarno sequence becomes unpaired and allows the mRNA to enter the ribosome for translation to occur. Mg2+ ion concentration {{has also been shown}} to affect the stability of FourU. The most well-studied RNA thermometer is found in the rpoH gene in Escherichia coli. This thermosensor upregulates <b>heat</b> <b>shock</b> proteins under high temperatures through σ32, a specialised heat-shock sigma factor.|$|E

The non-inhibitory serpin ovalbumin is the most abundant protein in egg white. Its exact function is unknown, but it is thought to be a storage protein for the developing foetus. <b>Heat</b> <b>shock</b> serpin 47 is a chaperone, essential for proper folding of collagen.

40|$|Six {{hours after}} <b>heat</b> <b>shocking</b> 2 - to 3 -month-old {{male and female}} Sprague-Dawley rats at 42 degrees C for 15 min, we {{analyzed}} tau protein immunoreactivity in SDS extracts of cerebrums and peripheral nerves by using immunoblot analysis and immunohistochemistry with the anti-tau monoclonal antibody Tau- 1, which recognizes a phosphate-dependent non-phosphorylated epitope, and with 125 I-labeled protein A. In the cerebral extracts, we found altered phosphorylation of tau in heat-shocked females, characterized by a marked reduction {{in the amount of}} nonphosphorylated tau, a doubling of the ratio of total (phosphorylated plus nonphosphorylated) tau to nonphosphorylated tau, and the appearance of the slowest moving phosphorylated tau polypeptide (68 kDa). Similar, but milder, changes were observed in male rats. These changes progressively increased in females from 3 to 6 h after <b>heat</b> <b>shocking.</b> In contrast, both phosphorylated tau and nonphosphorylated tau were reduced in peripheral nerves after <b>heat</b> <b>shocking.</b> In immunoblots of SDS extracts from Alzheimer disease-affected brain, the two slowest moving phosphorylated tau polypeptides (62 kDa and 66 kDa, respectively) were detected by Tau- 1 after dephosphorylation and by Tau- 2 (an anti-tau-monoclonal antibody that recognizes a phosphate-independent epitope) without prior dephosphorylation only in regions that contained tau immunoreactivity in histologic preparations. In addition, quantitative immunoblot analysis of cortex and the underlying white matter with Tau- 1 and 125 I-labeled protein A showed that the amount of phosphorylated tau progressively increased in the Alzheimer disease-affected cerebral cortex, while concurrently a proportionally lesser amount of tau entered the white matter axons. The similar findings for the rat heat-shock model and Alzheimer disease suggest that life stressors {{may play a role in}} the etiopathogenesis of Alzheimer disease...|$|R

5|$|Serpins are {{the most}} widely {{distributed}} and largest superfamily of protease inhibitors. They were initially believed to be restricted to eukaryote organisms, but have since been found in bacteria, archaea and some viruses. It remains unclear whether prokaryote genes are the descendants of an ancestral prokaryotic serpin or the product of horizontal gene transfer from eukaryotes. Most intracellular serpins belong to a single phylogenetic clade, whether they come from plants or animals, indicating that the intracellular and extracellular serpins may have diverged before the plants and animals. Exceptions include the intracellular <b>heat</b> <b>shock</b> serpin HSP47, which is a chaperone essential for proper folding of collagen, and cycles between the cis-Golgi and the endoplasmic reticulum.|$|E
5|$|The 20S {{proteasome}} is both ubiquitous {{and essential}} in eukaryotes. Some prokaryotes, including many archaea and the bacterial order Actinomycetales also share homologs of the 20S proteasome, whereas most bacteria possess <b>heat</b> <b>shock</b> genes hslV and hslU, whose gene products are a multimeric protease {{arranged in a}} two-layered ring and an ATPase. The hslV protein has been hypothesized to resemble the likely ancestor of the 20S proteasome. In general, HslV is not essential in bacteria, and not all bacteria possess it, whereas some protists possess both the 20S and the hslV systems. Many bacteria also possess other homologs of the proteasome and an associated ATPase, most notably ClpP and ClpX. This redundancy explains why the HslUV system is not essential.|$|E
5|$|Folding@home is {{also used}} to study protein chaperones, <b>heat</b> <b>shock</b> {{proteins}} which play essential roles in cell survival by assisting with the folding of other proteins in the crowded and chemically stressful environment within a cell. Rapidly growing cancer cells rely on specific chaperones, and some chaperones play key roles in chemotherapy resistance. Inhibitions to these specific chaperones are seen as potential modes of action for efficient chemotherapy drugs or for reducing the spread of cancer. Using Folding@home and working closely with the Center for Protein Folding Machinery, the Pande lab hopes to find a drug which inhibits those chaperones involved in cancerous cells. Researchers are also using Folding@home to study other molecules related to cancer, such as the enzyme Src kinase, and some forms of the engrailed homeodomain: a large protein which may be involved in many diseases, including cancer. In 2011, Folding@home began simulations of the dynamics of the small knottin protein EETI, which can identify carcinomas in imaging scans by binding to surface receptors of cancer cells.|$|E

40|$|We {{present the}} results of 2 D, moving mesh, viscous hydrodynamical {{simulations}} of accretion onto merging supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries. We include viscous <b>heating,</b> <b>shock</b> <b>heating,</b> and radiative cooling, and simulate {{the transition from the}} "pre-decoupling" epoch, where the inspiral timescale is longer than the viscous timescale, to the "post-decoupling" epoch, where the inspiral timescale is shorter than the viscous timescale. We find that there is no abrupt halt to the accretion at decoupling, but rather the accretion shows a slow decay, with significant accretion well after the expected decoupling. Moreover, we find that the luminosity in X-rays is significantly higher prior to the merger, as orbital energy from the SMBH binary is converted to <b>heat</b> via strong <b>shocks</b> inside the cavity, and radiated away. Following the merger, the cavity refills viscously and the accretion rate relaxes to the Shakura-Sunyaev value, while the X-ray luminosity drops as the shocks quickly dissipate...|$|R
5|$|The {{cause is}} not entirely clear, but {{is thought to be}} multifactorial. It has even been {{suggested}} that aphthous stomatitis is not a single entity but rather a group of conditions with different causes. Multiple research studies have attempted to identify a causative organism, but aphthous stomatitis appears to be non-contagious, non-infectious and not sexually transmissible. The mucosal destruction is thought {{to be the result of}} a T cell (T lymphocyte) mediated immune response which involves the generation of interleukins and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α). Mast cells and macrophages are also involved, secreting TNF-α along with the T cells. When early aphthous ulcers are biopsied, the histologic appearance shows a dense inflammatory infiltrate, 80% of which is made up of T cells. Persons with aphthous stomatitis also have circulating lymphocytes which react with peptides 91–105 of <b>heat</b> <b>shock</b> protein 65–60, and the ratio of CD4+ T cells to CD8+ T cells in the peripheral blood of individuals with aphthous stomatitis is decreased.|$|E

40|$|We {{present the}} results of a {{calculation}} of the thermal spectrum from a 2 D, moving mesh, high-accuracy, viscous hydrodynamical simulation of an accreting supermassive black hole binary. We include viscous <b>heating,</b> <b>shock</b> <b>heating,</b> and radiative cooling, evolving for longer than a viscous time so that we reach a quasi-steady accretion state. In agreement with previous work, we find that gas is efficiently stripped from the inner edge of the circumbinary disk and enters the cavity along accretion streams, which feed persistent "mini-disks" surrounding each black hole. We also find that emission from the shock-heated mini-disks and accretion streams prevents any deficit in high-energy emission that may be expected inside the circumbinary cavity, and instead leads to a characteristic brightening of the spectrum beginning in soft X-rays...|$|R
40|$|Using mouse {{erythroleukemia}} cells {{we performed}} a comprehensive morphological and biochemical study of the nuclear matrix obtained after exposure of isolated nuclei to 37 degrees C or from cells <b>heat</b> <b>shocked</b> in vivo at 43 or 45 degrees C. At the ultrastructural level {{it was possible to}} see that {{in the absence of a}} 37 degrees C incubation of purified nuclei, the final matrix lacked well-defined nucleolar remnants but a peripheral lamina was clearly visible, as well as a sparse fibrogranular network which was located at the periphery of the structures. On the contrary, after a 37 degrees C nuclear incubation, very electron-dense nucleolar remnants were observed along with an abundant meshwork dispersed throughout the interior of the structures. When intact cells were <b>heat</b> <b>shocked</b> in vivo, electron-dense residual nucleoli were present only when isolated nuclei had been exposed to 37 degrees C in vitro, whereas without such an incubation, they were not as easily distinguishable and appeared less electron-dense. In the latter case the inner network was more evenly distributed. After purified nuclei were incubated at 37 degrees C for 45 min, the high salt and DNase I resistant fraction retained about 18 % of the nuclear protein whereas if the heating was omitted protein recovery dropped to 6 %. An increase in the recovery of intact structures in the matrix fraction was the main reason for the higher protein recovery. Heating nuclei in vitro further increased the amount of nuclear protein present in the matrix fraction even if intact cells had been <b>heat</b> <b>shocked</b> in vivo. No major qualitative differences were seen when the polypeptide pattern of the various types of nuclear matrices was analyzed on one-dimensional polyacrylamide gels and this finding was further supported by Western blot analysis with a monoclonal antibody to lamins A and C. These results show that heating mainly stabilizes the nucleolar remnants of the matrix and to a lesser extent the inner network, but the morphology of the final structures is different depending on whether the stabilization is performed in vivo or in vitro...|$|R

40|$|International audienceSeveral {{studies in}} the fly Drosophila melanogaster have shown that a mild stress can {{increase}} longevity, resistance to strong stresses (e. g., heat, fungal infection, cold) and delay behavioral aging.
