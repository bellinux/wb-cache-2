40|$|Conceptual {{rainfall}} runoff (CRR) models usually require calibration {{to identify their}} parameter values, whereas their model structure is selected prior to modelling. Consid- erable efforts have been directed into calibration of lumped CRR models. Identification of the model structure {{on the basis of}} available data still remains unclear. The data-based mechanistic (DBM) approach does minimal assumptions of the model structure, which is identified using powerful statistic techniques. Moreover, there is a similarity between the CRR and DBM model. formulations. Based on this similarity, an integration of CRR and DBM models is proposed and evaluated. Two calibration strategies are investigated in the Upper Illinois river catchment (USA) for lumped modelling. Results show that the identi- fied TF model improves the simulated flow, especially in the time to peak, in comparison to the modelled flow of the conceptual model. It is suggested that this improvement is di- rectly related to the lag time parameter considered in the TF model between the effective rainfall and the flow. Semi-distributed {{rainfall runoff}} models provide advantages over lumped models in representing the effect of spatially variable inputs, outputs and catchment properties. However they are affected by parameter identifiability. Four calibration strategies are considered to analyse the ability to meaningful simulate flow at interior locations. Results show that there are no significant improvements at the catchment outlet when <b>internal</b> <b>gauges</b> are included. The behavioural parameter sets defined at the catchment outlet tend to be non-behavioural at the <b>internal</b> <b>gauges.</b> This tendency increases with the distance from the catchment outlet to the <b>internal</b> <b>gauges.</b> Considering only spatial variability of rainfall rather than also of parameter values did not improve the simulations at the out- let or at the <b>internal</b> <b>gauges,</b> compared to lumped modelling results. Calibration only at the catchment outlet using independent sampling of the internal subcatchments achieved similar results. Identification of lumped and semi-distributed CRR models is carried out using the RRTMSD modelling toolbox developed for this work. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

In this study, the Modified Shuffled Complex Evolution (MSCE) optimization algorithm is applied to automatically calibrate the physically-based spatially-distributed hydrological model SHETRAN in the 705 -km 2 semi-arid Cobres basin in southern Portugal, with a spatial resolution of 2 km and a temporal resolution of 1 h. Twenty-two parameters are calibrated for the main types of land-use and soil. Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) is 0. 86 for calibration and 0. 74 for validation for basin outlet; NSE is respectively 0. 65 and 0. 82 for calibration, 0. 69 and 0. 63 for validation of <b>internal</b> <b>gauging</b> stations Albernoa and Entradas.

40|$|Objectives: The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{determine}} the possible differences in deflection between two needles of same length and external gauge but with different internal gauges during truncal block of the inferior alveolar nerve. The initial working hypothesis was that greater deflection may be expected with larger <b>internal</b> <b>gauge</b> needles. Study design: Four clinicians subjected 346 patients to inferior alveolar nerve block and infiltrating anesthesia of the buccal nerve trajectory for the surgical or conventional extraction of the lower third molar. A nonautoaspirating syringe system with 2 types of needle was used: a standard 27 -gauge x 35 -mm needle with an <b>internal</b> <b>gauge</b> of 0. 215 mm or an XL Monoprotect® 27 -gauge x 35 -mm needle with an <b>internal</b> <b>gauge</b> of 0. 265 mm. The following information was systematically recorded for each patient: needle type, gender, anesthetic technique (direct or indirect truncal block) and the number of bone contacts during the procedure, the patient-extraction side, the practitioner performing the technique, and blood aspiration (either positive or negative). Results: 346 needles were used in total. 190 were standard needles (27 -gauge x 35 -mm needle with an <b>internal</b> <b>gauge</b> of 0. 215 mm) and 156 were XL Monoprotect®.

40|$|We {{study the}} sub-structure of the heterotic Kähler moduli space {{due to the}} {{presence}} of non-Abelian <b>internal</b> <b>gauge</b> fields {{from the perspective of the}} four-dimensional effective theory. <b>Internal</b> <b>gauge</b> fields can be supersymmetric in some regions of the Kähler moduli space but break supersymmetry in others. In the context of the four-dimensional theory, we investigate what happens when the Kähler moduli are changed from the supersymmetric to the non-supersymmetric region. Our results provide a low-energy description of supersymmetry breaking by <b>internal</b> <b>gauge</b> fields as well as a physical picture for the mathematical notion of bundle stability. Specifically, we find that at the transition between the two regions an additional anomalous U(1) symmetry appears under which some of the states in the low-energy theory acquire charges. We compute the associated D-term contribution to the four-dimensional potential which contains a Kähler-moduli dependent Fayet-Iliopoulos term and contributions from the charged states. We show that this D-term correctly reproduces the expected physics. Several mathematical conclusions concerning vector bundle stability are drawn from our arguments. We also discuss possible physical applications of our results to heterotic model building and moduli stabilisation. © 2009 SISSA...|$|E
