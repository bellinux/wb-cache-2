In this study, {{the effects of}} on-track dwell time on a hard disk drive (HDD) multidentate perfluoropolyether media lubricant were investigated. It was found that increasing dwell times increase the magnitude of lubricant depletion to a point, after which the depletion does not increase with increasing dwell time. Light interference with the media and high skew angles were shown to increase depletion. Once the dwell is complete, {{it was found that}} the lubricant reflows into the depletion region. This reflow was shown to be accelerated by increasing humidity and temperature. The rates for both depletion and reflow were measured and used to develop a simple model. This model was used to predict the final depletion depth for a sample that experienced a sequence of on- /off- track <b>dwell</b> <b>steps.</b> Experimental verification of this model found that it is reasonably accurate, especially for short dwell times and long off-track reflow periods...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. On {{the basis}} of a five bar linkage it is {{possible}} to generate actinomorphic coupler curves if certain conditions, related to the kinematic dimensions and the gear ratio between the two cranks, are fulfilled. These symmetric coupler curves can then be used to realize a step mechanism by adding two additional links, taking advantage of the typical curvature characteristics of the generated coupler curve The following article starts with a short literature survey about five bar linkages in general and their use as <b>dwell</b> or <b>step</b> mechanisms in particular. Then it will be shown how the curvature properties of the coupler curves generated by five bar linkages can be determined by graphical means. It will be shown how this procedure can be advantageously applied {{with the help of an}} interactive geometry program, using the geometric determination of the curvature properties, such that an optimal step mechanism can be derived...|$|R

The sample paths thus obtained are qualitatively alike to those experimentally recorded. Furthermore, our model is proved to be susceptible of a consistent parameters regulation yielding step frequencies, mean <b>step</b> <b>dwell</b> time and dwell time distribution in excellent agreement with the experimental evidence...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanism}} by which conventional kinesin walks along microtubules is poorly understood, but may involve alternate binding to the microtubule and hydrolysis of ATP by the two heads. Here we report a single amino-acid change that affects stepping by the motor. Under low force or low ATP concentration, the motor moves by successive 8 -nm steps in single-motor laser-trap assays, indicating that the mutation does not alter the basic mechanism of kinesin walking. Remarkably, under high force, the mutant motor takes successive 16 -nm displacements that can be resolved into rapid double 8 -nm steps with a short <b>dwell</b> between <b>steps,</b> followed by a longer dwell. The alternating short and long dwells under high force demonstrate that the motor stepping mechanism is inherently asymmetric, revealing an asymmetric phase in the kinesin walking cycle. Our findings support an asymmetric two-headed walking model for kinesin, with cooperative interactions between the two heads. The sensitivity of the 16 -nm displacements to nucleotide and load {{raises the possibility that}} ADP release is a force-producing event of the kinesin cycle...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: We {{present the}} results of a pilot study to test the {{feasibility}} of a brachytherapy dosimetry audit. Methods: The feasibility study was conducted at seven sites from four Australian states in both public and private centres. A purpose-built cylindrical water phantom was imaged using the local imaging protocol and a treatment plan was generated to deliver 1 Gy to the central (1 of 3) thermoluminescent dosimeter (TLD) from six dwell positions. Results: All centres completed the audit, consisting of three consecutive irradiations, within a 2 -h time period, {{with the exception of one}} centre that uses a pulsed dose rate brachytherapy unit. All TLD results were within 4. 5 % of the predicted value, with the exception of one subset where the <b>dwell</b> position <b>step</b> size was incorrectly applied. Conclusions: While the limited data collected in the study demonstrated considerable heterogeneity in clinical practice, the study proved a brachytherapy dosimetry audit to be feasible. Future studies should include verification of source strength using a Standard Dosimetry Laboratory calibrated chamber, a phantom that more closely mimics the clinical situation, a more comprehensive review of safety and quality assurance (QA) procedures including source dwell time and position accuracy, and a review of patient treatment QA procedures such as applicator position verification...|$|R
40|$|V 1, a {{water-soluble}} {{portion of}} vacuole-type ATPase (V-ATPase), is an ATP-driven rotary motor, similar to F 1 -ATPase. Hydrolysis of ATP is coupled to unidirectional {{rotation of the}} central rotor D and F subunits relative to the A 3 B 3 cylinder. In this study, we analyzed the rotation kinetics of V 1 in detail. At low ATP concentrations, the D subunit rotated stepwise, pausing every 120 °. The <b>dwell</b> time between <b>steps</b> revealed that V 1 consumes one ATP per 120 ° step. V 1 generated torque of ≈ 35 pN nm, slightly lower than the ≈ 46 pN nm measured for F 1. Noticeably, the angles for both ATP cleavage and binding were apparently the same in V 1, {{in sharp contrast to}} F 1, which cleaves ATP at 80 ° posterior to the binding of ATP. Thus, the mechanochemical cycle of V 1 has marked differences to that of F 1...|$|R
40|$|Vacuole-type ATPases (VoV 1) and FoF 1 ATP synthases couple ATP hydrolysis/synthesis in the soluble V 1 or F 1 portion with proton (or Na+) {{flow in the}} membrane-embedded Vo or Fo portion through {{rotation}} of one common shaft. Here we show at submillisecond resolutions the ATP-driven {{rotation of}} isolated V 1 and the whole VoV 1 from Thermus thermophilus, by attaching a 40 -nm gold bead for which viscous drag is almost negligible. V 1 made 120 ° steps, commensurate {{with the presence of}} three catalytic sites. <b>Dwells</b> between the <b>steps</b> involved at least two events other than ATP binding, one likely to be ATP hydrolysis. VoV 1 exhibited 12 dwell positions per revolution, consistent with the 12 -fold symmetry of the Vo rotor in T. thermophilus.

40|$|Molecular motors such as kinesin, myosin, and F 1 -ATPase are {{responsible}} for many important cellular processes. These motor proteins exhibit nanometer-scale, stepwise movements on micro- to millisecond timescales. So far, methods developed to measure these small and fast movements with high spatial and temporal resolution require relatively complicated experimental systems. Here, we describe a simple dark-field imaging system that employs objective-type evanescent illumination to selectively illuminate a thin layer on the coverslip and thus yield images with high signal/noise ratios. Only by substituting the dichroic mirror in conventional objective-type total internal reflection fluorescence microscope with a perforated mirror, were nanometer spatial precision and microsecond temporal resolution simultaneously achieved. This system {{was applied to the}} study of the rotary mechanism of F 1 -ATPase. The fluctuation of a gold nanoparticle attached to the γ-subunit during catalytic <b>dwell</b> and the <b>stepping</b> motion during torque generation were successfully visualized with 9. 1 -μs temporal resolution. Because of the simple optics, this system will be applicable to various biophysical studies requiring high spatial and temporal resolution in vitro and also in vivo...|$|R
40|$|We have {{analyzed}} {{the mechanics of}} individual kinesin molecules by optical trapping nanometry. A kinesin molecule was adsorbed onto a latex bead, which was captured by an optical trap and brought into contact with an axoneme that was bound to a glass surface. The displacement of kinesin during force generation was determined by measuring {{the position of the}} beads with nanometer accuracy. As the displacement of kinesin was attenuated because of the compliance of the kinesin-to-bead and kinesin-to-microtubule linkages, the compliance was monitored during force generation and was used to correct the displacement of kinesin. Thus the velocity and the unitary steps could be obtained accurately over a wide force range. The force-velocity curves were linear from 0 to a maximum force at 10 microM and 1 mM ATP, and the maximum force was approximately 7 pN, which is larger by approximately 30 % than values previously reported. Kinesin exhibited forward and occasionally backward stepwise displacements with a size of approximately 8 nm. The histograms of <b>step</b> <b>dwell</b> time show a monotonic decrease with time. Model calculations indicate that each kinesin head steps by 16 -nm, whereas kinesin molecule steps by 8 -nm...|$|R
40|$|The global {{attention}} {{has always been}} focussed on the adverse environmental impacts of conventional energy sources. In contrast nonconventional energy sources, particularly the renewable ones, have enjoyed a [`]clean' image vis a vis environmental impacts. The only major exception to this general trend has been large hydropower projects; experience has taught us {{that they can be}} disastrous for the environment. The belief now is that minihydel and microhydel projects are harmless alternatives. But are renewable energy sources really as benign as is widely believed? The present essay addresses this question in the background of Lovin's classical paradigm, which had postulated the hard (malignant) and soft (benign) energy concepts in the first place. It critically evaluates the environmental impacts of major renewable energy sources. It then comes up with the broad conclusion that renewable energy sources are not the panacea they are popularly perceived to be; indeed in some cases their adverse environmental impacts can be as strongly negative as the impacts of conventional energy sources. The paper also <b>dwells</b> on the <b>steps</b> we need to take so that we can utilize renewable energy sources without facing environmental backlashes of the type we got from hydropower projects. ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} {{the relationship between}} place and identity {{in a small town}} in a rural setting in England. I use an approach inspired by phenomenology, where I look at how people <b>dwell,</b> their everyday <b>steps</b> over this particular landscape. I claim, contrary to some social theorists, that place continues to play an important part in everyday life in postmodern space, as people are searching for belonging to some place or other. Place can therefore be seen to be one important factor in the production of identity. Welderfield is an ambiguous place. Situated in the midst of England it has by no means escaped the flows of globalisation or other effects of our postindustrial space, yet for many of the residents evidence of postmodernity is played down. Instead, there is a focus on pleasant social practices imbued with elements of the past. There seems to be what I call a romanticising by the residents over this town in a quest for a rural identity. This, I claim, is done through place-making: Particular pieces of the landscape become invested with meaning through our everyday activities, and thus become places as opposed to merely points in the topography. I suggest that people through their place-making practices produce certain senses of place, and that this in turn partly determines how people see themselves. The conflict I witnessed between the traditional and the modern, between nostalgia and the present, is minimized through each individual place-making practice. I conclude that the residents of Welderfield experience affiliation to their place despite of, or perhaps even because of, processes of globalisation in postmodernity. I suggest that in this place, a sense of groundedness prevails over uprootedness, and that this in turn produces a certain identity which I have called a rural identity...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: High {{dose rate}} (HDR) {{brachytherapy}} is a treatment method {{that is used}} increasingly worldwide. The development of a sound quality assurance program for the verification of treatment deliveries can be challenging due to the high source activity utilized {{and the need for}} precise measurements of dwell positions and times. This paper describes the application of a novel phantom, based on a 2 D 11 x 11 diode array detection system, named 2 ̆ 2 magic phantom 2 ̆ 2 (MPh), to accurately measure plan dwell positions and times, compare them directly to the treatment plan, determine errors in treatment delivery, and calculate absorbed dose. Methods: The magic phantom system was CT scanned and a 20 catheter plan was generated to simulate a nonspecific treatment scenario. This plan was delivered to the MPh and, using a custom developed software suite, the dwell positions and times were measured and compared to the plan. The original plan was also modified, with changes not disclosed to the primary authors, and measured again using the device and software to determine the modifications. A new metric, the 2 ̆ 2 position-time gamma index, 2 ̆ 2 was developed to quantify the quality of a treatment delivery when compared to the treatment plan. The MPh was evaluated to determine the minimum measurable <b>dwell</b> time and <b>step</b> size. The incorporation of the TG- 43 U 1 formalism directly into the software allows for dose calculations to be made based on the measured plan. The estimated dose distributions calculated by the software were compared to the treatment plan and to calibrated EBT 3 film, using the 2 D gamma analysis method. Results: For the original plan, the magic phantom system was capable of measuring all dwell points and dwell times and the majority were found to be within 0. 93 mm and 0. 25 s, respectively, from the plan. By measuring the altered plan and comparing it to the unmodified treatment plan, the use of the position-time gamma index showed that all modifications made could be readily detected. The MPh was able to measure dwell times down to 0. 067 ± 0. 001 s and planned dwell positions separated by 1 mm. The dose calculation carried out by the MPh software was found to be in agreement with values calculated by the treatment planning system within 0. 75...|$|R
40|$|This paper proposes the {{theoretical}} lens of governmentality (Barry, Osborne, 2 ̆ 6 Rose, 1996; Burchell, Gordon, 2 ̆ 6 Miller, 1991; Dean, 1999; Foucault, 1991; Rose, 1999) for {{making sense of}} the historical, political and ethical constitution of the learning advisor in Australian higher education. To begin, the paper draws on Lewis Carroll 2 ̆ 7 s Through the looking glass, and what Alice found there as a narrative tactic to demonstrate how the space of learning advising can be understood as a most curious place to <b>dwell.</b> Rather than <b>stepping</b> into the looking glass to discover this world of strangeness, I suggest that we must step out of the looking glass to turn and see - clearly, darkly - how strangeness is already part of our professional lifeworld with its spatial contortions, its temporal reversals, and its illogical diversions. I then suggest that if we venture to examine ourselves through the lens of governmentality we can begin to see how learning advising is merely a figment of the liberal imagination - an effect of the dynamic interaction of power, knowledge and ethics in liberal society. Through this lens, learning advising can be understood as a discursively complex, relational, polysemic and contested space in the academy that is ontologically vulnerable to political thought and action, and epistemologically and axiomatically vulnerable to its ebb and flow. To elaborate, I suggest that learning advising is a relational space because its intelligibility is an effect of the convergence of historical circumstance, political reasoning, and perceived social and economic crises that reconfigure the university as an apparatus of government, and reconstitute the higher education student as the object of government. I argue that it is in this three way moral relationship with the university and the student that the learning advisor is politically and ethically constituted. I go on to suggest that the historical proliferation of these configurations and constitutions have layered and folded through this space multiple truths that intersect (polysemic) and compete (contested) for domination causing its inhabitants speak with an ontological stammering (Lather, 2003). The final part of the paper suggests that agency in this space is {{not simply a matter of}} attempting to ground one 2 ̆ 7 s identity, politics and agency in the notion of a foundational subject or teleological notions of progress, but to learn to dwell ethically and tactically in the complexity of the space willed to us by history (de Certeau, 1988; Readings, 1997). Dwelling, I suggest, requires us to live poetically, with a 2 ̆ 7 commitment to thought 2 ̆ 7 (Foucault, 1997; Readings, 1997) and a healthy skepticism for all things that resemble reification (Fendler, 1999), as a provocation to ever more critical and creative practice (Gitlin, 2008) ...|$|R
