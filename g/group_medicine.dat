40|$|Recent {{strategies}} in managed care and managed competition illustrate how health care reforms may reproduce {{the patterns of}} economic organization of their times. Such a reform approach {{is not a new}} development in the United States. The work of the 1927 - 1932 Committee on the Costs of Medical Care exemplifies an earlier effort that applied forms of economic organization to medical care. The committee tried to restructure medicine along lines consistent with its economic environment while attributing its models variously to science, profession, and business. Like current approaches, the committee's reports defined costs as the major problem and business models of organization as the major solution. The reports recommended expanded financial management and <b>group</b> <b>medicine,</b> which would include growth in self-supporting middle-class services such as fee clinics and middle-rate hospital units. Identifying these elements as corporate practice of medicine, the American Medical Association-based minority dissented from the final report in favor of conserving individual entrepreneurial practice. This continuum in forms of economic organization has limited structural reform {{strategies in}} medicine {{for the remainder of the}} century...|$|E

40|$|Objective　To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} the traditional Chinese medicine SanZiPaiTanTang combined with ambroxol in the treatment of airway mucus hypersecretion in rats with asthma. Methods　Forty SD rats were randomly divided into 5 groups (8 each) : normal group, asthma group, SanZiPaiTanTang <b>group</b> (Chinese <b>medicine</b> <b>group),</b> ambroxol <b>group</b> (Western <b>medicine</b> <b>group),</b> SanZiPaiTanTang combined with ambroxol group (The combinational group). The rat asthma model was reproduced with ovalbumin (OVA), and all these rats were morphologically scored on the 42 th and 56 th day. Airway inflammation was observed pathologically with HE staining, and the expression of lung tissue mucin (MUC 5 AC) was examined by immunohistochemistry. The IL- 13 content in serum was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and the proliferation of goblet cells in airway was detected by periodic acid Schiff (PAS) staining. Results　The morphological score and airway inflammation decreased in all drug treated groups as compared with those in asthma group. The MUC 5 AC levels were higher in asthma group than in normal group (0. 530 ± 0. 035 vs 0. 132 ± 0. 020, P< 0. 05), the combination group (0. 254 ± 0. 029), the Chinese <b>medicine</b> <b>group</b> (0. 359 ± 0. 025) and the Western <b>medicine</b> <b>group</b> (0. 386 ± 0. 030) (P< 0. 05), while the difference between combinational <b>group</b> and Chinese <b>medicine</b> <b>group</b> or Western <b>medicine</b> <b>group</b> was statistically significant (P< 0. 05). The IL- 13 contents markedly decreased in the combinational <b>group,</b> Chinese <b>medicine</b> <b>group</b> and Western <b>medicine</b> <b>group</b> compared with that in asthma group (42. 41 ± 3. 15, 46. 31 ± 3. 07, 43. 05 ± 2. 70 vs 51. 65 ± 4. 07, P< 0. 05), and the difference between the combinat <b>group</b> and Chinese <b>medicine</b> <b>group</b> was statistically significant (P< 0. 05), but no significant difference was found between the combinational group and the Western <b>medicine</b> <b>group.</b> The goblet cell hyperplasia area was significantly lower in the three drug treated groups than in asthma group (41. 21 ± 2. 88, 48. 10 ± 3. 44, 51. 06 ± 3. 51 vs 63. 25 ± 5. 02, P< 0. 05), and the difference between combinational <b>group</b> and Chinese <b>medicine</b> <b>group</b> or Western <b>medicine</b> <b>group</b> was statistically significant (P< 0. 05). Conclusion　SanZiPaiTanTang combined with ambroxol can suppress the hypersecretion of airway mucus in asthma rats probably by reducing the expression of IL- 13 and the proliferation of goblet cells, and its efficacy is higher than that of Chinese medicine or Western medicine alone.

In our study we compared medicine therapy in idiopathic epilepsy and war induced PTE. The test group was consisted of 50 war-disabled persons, and the control group consisted of 50 adult men who had idiopathic epilepsy. Our questionnaires were analyzed by statistical methods.

40|$|Background: The {{efficacy}} {{of different types}} of bisphosphonates has already been established in the treatment of osteoporosis and some studies have also shown some correlation to its side effects on oral health. Aim and Objective: To determine the role of different bisphosphonate drugs (inhibitor osteoclast-mediated bone resorption) in the treatment osteoporosis and their adverse effects jaw under one study over a period of 24 months. Materials and Methods: This is a longitudinal study of selected patients and the changes were studied during follow-ups that were designed at 6, 9, 12, 24 months. Four groups (16 patients in each) were formed with patients undergoing treatment for osteoporosis and were administered different bisphosphonates <b>group</b> <b>medicine</b> (Alandronate- short acting; Ibandronate- medium acting; Zoledronic acid- long acting) and effects and side-effects on jaw were studied during follow-up. Results: After 2 years, the patients receiving bisphosphonates (groups A, B, C) had significant increase in their mean (±SE) spinal bone density (4. 2 ± 0. 8 % and 5. 2 ± 0. 7 %, respectively; P < 0. 017). The rate of new vertebral fractures was reduced by half in the bisphosphonate-treated patients as compared with the patients who only received calcium and vitamin Db (group D) (29. 5 vs. 62. 9 fractures per 1, 000 patient-years; P = 0. 043); also there were seen osteonecrosis-like symptoms in jaw more in zoledronic-acid-using patients and as compared to oral bisphosphonates. Conclusion: Bisphosphonate therapy for 2 years significantly increases spinal bone mass and reduces the incidence of new vertebral fractures in osteoporotic patients, but also has risk factor for jaw bone necrosis associated with it...|$|E

Ulcer indexes and degree of mucosal degree in rats at different time points after gavage were observed. Twenty-eight days after gavage, interleukin (IL) - 1 β was given to induce ulcer recurrence so as to observe the recurrent severity and rate of ulcer in each group. ResultsCompared with model <b>group</b> and western <b>medicine</b> <b>group,</b> treatment in combination group could prominently reduce the ulcer index of rats with peptic ulcer, and increase the healing rate and inhibition rate of peptic ulcer.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{study the}} effects of Feiyanning Decoction, a {{compound}} traditional Chinese herbal medicine, on the ratio of CD 4 +CD 25 + regulatory T cells and expression of transcription factor Foxp 3 in mice with Lewis lung cancer. METHODS: Thirty-two male wild-type C 57 BL/ 6 mice aging from 6 to 8 weeks were inoculated with Lewis lung cancer cells to establish the tumor-bearing model of Lewis lung carcinoma and were randomly divided into model <b>group,</b> Chinese <b>medicine</b> <b>group,</b> chemotherapy <b>group</b> and Chinese <b>medicine</b> combined with chemotherapy group. After intervention for 14 d with corresponding drugs, behaviors, physical signs and changes of feed consumption of the mice were observed. All mice were sacrificed after drug treatment, and tumors and organs were removed to weigh and calculate organ indexes (lung index, spleen index and thymus index). The percentages of CD 4 +CD 25 + regulatory T cells in the thymus, spleen and tumor were determined by flow cytometry. The expression of Foxp 3 mRNA in the thymus, spleen and tumor tissues was detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Compared with those in the model group, the mice in the Chinese <b>medicine</b> <b>group</b> showed significant reductions in spleen and thymus indexes and tumor weight, and elevation in the body weight without tumor (P< 0. 05). The numbers of CD 4 +CD 25 + regulatory T cells in spleen, thymus and tumor were lower in the Chinese <b>medicine</b> <b>group</b> than in the model group (P< 0. 05). The expression of Foxp 3 mRNA in spleen, thymus and tumor was significantly down-regulated in the Chinese <b>medicine</b> <b>group</b> compared with the model group (P< 0. 05). There {{were no significant differences in}} CD 4 +CD 25 + regulatory T cell ratio and Foxp 3 mRNA expression between the Chinese medicine combined with chemotherapy group and the chemotherapy group.
