60|$|Ormsgill had, as it happened, {{been busy}} that morning with an English lawyer {{whom he had}} met at the hotel, and had taken {{him over to the}} office of the Vice-Consul, who signed a {{document}} the lawyer drew out. He had also made other preparations for a journey, but he had sent the priest no word that he was going back to Africa. This, he felt, was not necessary, since Father Tiebout would expect him. He leaned bareheaded against the rails, with the furrows showing plainly on his bronzed face, while the Trade breeze, which was fresh that afternoon, swept the cool veranda and piled the long Atlantic swell rumbling on the beach. He could see the spray fly high and white, and the <b>dust</b> <b>whirl</b> down the glaring road that led to the Spanish city, and once more he felt his blood stir in harmony with the throb of restless life in the frothing sea. Still, the task before him was difficult, and he set about it diffidently.|$|E
50|$|Retired to Keene's Castleton Farm, Sweep was {{the leading}} sire by {{earnings}} in 1918 and again in 1925. He was a great sire and broodmare sire, with three daughters that produced Kentucky Derby winners. They were Beaming Beauty, dam of Bubbling Over; Brushup, dam of War Admiral; and <b>Dust</b> <b>Whirl,</b> dam of Whirlaway. Both War Admiral and Whirlaway became Triple Crown champions.|$|E
50|$|Very small steam devils {{may have}} a poorly defined column and no {{identifiable}} clear inner core. Such vortices are more properly called steam whirls by analogy with the <b>dust</b> <b>whirls</b> of land.|$|R
6000|$|The {{hands of}} God...! And yet...! What other forces were arrayed? ... What would become of us all, poor atoms of earthly <b>dust</b> <b>whirled</b> {{in the wind}} which cometh whence and goeth whither no man may know. It was not for myself... Margaret...! ...|$|R
60|$|Osborne {{did not go}} to town on Saturdays, and he and Ruth {{were sitting}} in a shady corner of the lawn during the hot {{afternoon}} when a cloud of <b>dust</b> <b>whirled</b> up among the firs. The speed with which it streaked the climbing forest had its significance to Ruth, but when a big gray car flashed across an opening her expression changed.|$|R
60|$|Soon {{after he}} had spoken, a flash leaped from {{overhead}} and the prairie was flooded with dazzling radiance. It {{was followed by a}} roll of thunder, and a roar as the rain came down. For a few moments the <b>dust</b> <b>whirled</b> up and there was a strong smell of earth; then the air was filled with falling water. George stood still in the deluge, rejoicing, while the great drops lashed his upturned face, until Edgar laughingly pushed him toward the house.|$|R
60|$|The <b>dust</b> <b>whirled</b> behind them, and the cropped hedgerows spun past; they swung giddily round a curve at a bridge, and the throb of {{the engine}} grew louder as they breasted the hill. Dark firs {{streamed}} down to meet them; {{here and there a}} leafless birch and an oak that gleamed like burnished copper swept by. There was a tinkle of running water in the wood; and, now that they were out of the sunshine, the air felt keen. Ahead, the ascending road unrolled like a white riband through faint, shifting lights and lilac shadow.|$|R
60|$|The towns rose stark {{from the}} prairie in unsoftened ugliness, {{and there was}} nothing to stir the {{imagination}} in the great waste of sun-bleached grass. Day by day, while the <b>dust</b> <b>whirled</b> by them, and the gaunt telegraph posts came up out of the far horizon and sank into the east, they raced across the wide levels. The red dawns burned behind them, the sunsets flamed ahead, and still there was only dust and grass, chequered here and there with bands of stubble, while driving grit and ugliness were the salient features of the little stations they stopped at.|$|R
60|$|Then {{lips were}} set tight, and steady eyes blazed, {{as a man}} grimed with sweat and dust who reeled in his saddle swept out from the forest on a jaded horse. Most of those who watched him had a heavy stake in that race, for it was with Alton's {{prosperity}} they must stand or fall; but the bushman's code of honour {{is as high as}} it is simple, and they sprang aside to give the rider a free passage. The man blinked at them in a curious dazed fashion, as he rode on, the <b>dust</b> <b>whirling</b> behind him and the lather dripping tinged with red from the horse's whitened sides.|$|R
5000|$|The French {{magazine}} L'Illustration on its 12 January 1918 issue {{reported on}} a telegraph cable from 31 December 1917 that Guatemala city had been completely destroyed: two hundred thousand people were left homeless and there were about two thousand deaths. The city's monuments were lost. In 1920, Prince Wilhelm of Sweden arrived to Guatemala on a trip along Central America; his journey took him to Antigua Guatemala and Guatemala City where {{he saw that the}} recovery efforts were still not done and the city still lay in ruins. There was still <b>dust</b> <b>whirling</b> in thick clouds, penetrating everywhere [...] - [...] clothes, mouth and nostrils, eyes and skin pores [...] - [...] visitors got sick until they got used to the dust; the streets were not paved and only one in three houses was occupied, as the others were still in ruins.|$|R
6000|$|He {{became almost}} {{speechless}} for a minute, {{and then went}} on, [...] "Do {{you know what the}} place is? Have you seen that awful den of hellish infamy, with the very moonlight alive with grisly shapes, and every speck of <b>dust</b> that <b>whirls</b> in the wind a devouring monster in embryo? Have you felt the Vampire's lips upon your throat?" ...|$|R
6000|$|But him {{the child}} of Thetis in the fight [...] Met on a windy winter day, when high The <b>dust</b> was <b>whirled,</b> and wrapp'd them like the night [...] That falleth on the {{mountains}} stealthily [...] When the floods come, and down their courses dry The torrents roar, and lightning flasheth far: [...] So rang, so shone their harness terribly Beneath the blinding thunder-cloud of war.|$|R
50|$|<b>Dust</b> Storms, <b>whirl</b> {{winds and}} dusty winds blow from various {{quarters}} {{towards the end}} of May. The Southwest wind sets in during April, it is the strongest in June and continues till September. Cyclonic storms with varying wind velocity affects once in 3 or 4 years during the month of November-December. The Northeast monsoon is accompanied by winds which can affect crops, but during Southwest monsoon the air is calm and undisturbed.|$|R
60|$|Then they wound through dusky woods {{out of the}} hot valley, {{and down}} the long white road across a sun-baked moor, where the <b>dust</b> <b>whirled</b> behind them in a rolling cloud. However, {{the men in the}} {{foremost}} vehicle got little of it, and Ingleby felt that the drive would have been pleasant in different circumstances, as he watched the blue hills that rose in the dazzling distance, blurred with heat. Only one white fleecy cloud flecked the sweep of cerulean, and the empty moor lay still under the drowsy silence of the Sunday afternoon. It seemed to him most unfitting that the harsh voices of his companions, the clatter of hoofs, and the doleful tooting of the cornet, should jar upon it. Then as they dipped into a hollow they came upon other travellers, all heading in the same direction, who hurled somewhat pointed jests at them as they passed; but these did not exactly resemble the men in the wagonettes. Their attire was by no means neat, and they had not in the least the appearance of men about to discharge a duty, while several of them carried heavy sticks.|$|R
6000|$|They shouted {{together}} {{with such a}} common intensity of direction that I halted and looked seaward. I saw the tall fountain flung by a shot that had just missed the great warship. A second rose still nearer us, a third, and a fourth, and then a great uprush of <b>dust,</b> a <b>whirling</b> cloud, leapt out of the headland whence the rocket had come, and spread with a slow deliberation right and left. Hard on that an enormous crash, and {{the man with the}} full voice leapt and cried, [...] "Hit!" ...|$|R
60|$|Summer had come, and the grass, {{which grew}} {{scarcely}} ankle-deep {{on the great}} levels, was once more white and dry, but in the hollows that had held the melting snow it stood waist-high, scented with peppermint, harsh and wiry, and Winston had set out with every man he had to harvest it. Already a line of loaded wagons crawled slowly across the prairie, and men and horses moved half-seen amid the <b>dust</b> that <b>whirled</b> about another sloo. Out of it came the trampling of hoofs and the musical tinkle of steel.|$|R
60|$|Villette owns {{a climate}} as variable, though not so humid, {{as that of}} any English town. A night of high wind {{followed}} upon that soft sunset, and all {{the next day was}} one of dry storm--dark, beclouded, yet rainless,--the streets were dim with sand and <b>dust,</b> <b>whirled</b> from the boulevards. I know not that even lovely weather would have tempted me to spend the evening-time of study and recreation where I had spent it yesterday. My alley, and, indeed, all the walks and shrubs in the garden, had acquired a new, but not a pleasant interest; their seclusion was now become precarious; their calm--insecure. That casement which rained billets, had vulgarized the once dear nook it overlooked; and elsewhere, the eyes of the flowers had gained vision, and the knots in the tree-boles listened like secret ears. Some plants there were, indeed, trodden down by Dr. John in his search, and his hasty and heedless progress, which I wished to prop up, water, and revive; some footmarks, too, he had left on the beds: but these, in spite of the strong wind, I found a moment's leisure to efface very early in the morning, ere common eyes had discovered them. With a pensive sort of content, I sat down to my desk and my German, while the pupils settled to their evening lessons; and the other teachers took up their needlework.|$|R
50|$|Kif {{sets off}} with the last {{remaining}} buggalo, Amy's personal pet Betsy, {{in an effort to}} draw out the rustlers. Professor Farnsworth sends Fry, Leela, and Bender along with him. As the group tell ghost stories, Amy jumps out of the bushes to join them. Kif and the crew find the stolen buggalo hidden in the crater of Olympus Mons when the ground shakes. They find a way to eject the buggalo from the crater, but when they are about to head back to the ranch, the same strange sound from the barbecue begins, and another <b>dust</b> storm <b>whirls</b> in.|$|R
40|$|The article {{presented}} an analytical review of existing designs of cyclone dust collectors, lists their main advantages {{compared to other}} vehicles of similar purpose. Classification of cyclone dust collectors, design features, advantages and disadvantages, application of back-and-flow cyclone, flow cyclone and <b>whirl</b> <b>dust</b> collectors are described. The factors influencing {{the efficiency of the}} cyclone apparatuses are analyzed. Advanced designs of cyclones CN are offered...|$|R
60|$|The {{military}} {{needs of}} the States be three: (a) Frontier warfare, an employment well within {{the grip of the}} present army of twenty-five thousand, and in the nature of things growing less arduous year by year; (b) internal riots and commotions which rise up like a <b>dust</b> devil, <b>whirl</b> furiously, and die out long before the authorities at Washington could begin to fill up even the third skeleton battalions, much less hunt about for material for the fourth; (c) civil war, in which, as the case in the affair of the North and South, the regular army would be swamped in the mass of militia and armed volunteers would turn the land into a hell.|$|R
6000|$|I hate a motive, like a {{lingering}} bottle [...] Which with the landlord makes too long a stand, [...] Leaving all-claretless the unmoisten'd throttle, [...] Especially with politics on hand; [...] I hate it, as I hate a drove of cattle, [...] Who <b>whirl</b> the <b>dust</b> as simooms <b>whirl</b> the sand; [...] I hate it, as I hate an argument, [...] A laureate's ode, or servile peer's 'content.' ...|$|R
60|$|Austin {{wondered}} {{whether he had}} any eyebrows left when that furnace was filled, but it was done at last, {{and then there was}} coal to be trimmed from the bunkers. The <b>dust</b> that <b>whirled</b> about the shovels blackened and choked him, but he worked on savagely. Every man was needed, with half the Spaniards sick, and he felt that if this was the cost of success it was not fitting that he should shirk his part in it. Social distinctions counted for nothing there; the barriers of creed and nationality had also melted. They were all privates in that forlorn hope, with death as the penalty of failure, and while they could not be more, none of them that day dared be less, than men.|$|R
60|$|Up to {{this date}} the Boer forces which dogged the column had been {{annoying}} but not seriously aggressive. On the 19th, however, affairs took an unexpected turn. The British scouts rode in to report a huge <b>dust</b> cloud <b>whirling</b> swiftly northwards {{from the direction of}} the Vaal River--soon plainly visible to all, and showing as it drew nearer the hazy outline of a long column of mounted men. The dark coats of the riders, and possibly the speed of their advance, showed that they were Boers, and soon it was rumoured that it was no other than Christian De Wet with his merry men, who, with characteristic audacity, had ridden back into the Transvaal in the hope of overwhelming Barton's column.|$|R
60|$|For at {{that moment}} a heavier gust of wind than usual swept down upon the arena, lifted a suffocating cloud of <b>dust,</b> and <b>whirled</b> it around the tiers of benches and the balcony, {{and for a moment}} seemed to stop the performance. I heard an exclamation from the geologist, who had risen to his feet. I fancied I heard even a faint cry from Miss Mannersley; but the next moment, as the dust was slowly settling, we saw a sheet of paper in the air, that had been caught up in this brief cyclone, dropping, dipping from side to side on {{uncertain}} wings, until it slowly descended in the very middle of the arena. It was a leaf from Miss Mannersley's sketchbook, the one on which she had been sketching.|$|R
60|$|Wisbech felt {{inclined}} {{to hold his}} breath as he watched Nasmyth climb down {{the face of the}} trestle, but in another minute or two he was clambering up again with several other men behind him. There was another hoot of the whistle, and, as Wisbech glanced up the track, a great locomotive broke out from among the pines. It was veiled in <b>whirling</b> <b>dust</b> and flying fragments of ballast, and smoke that was grey instead of white, for the track led down-grade, and the engineer had throttled the steam. The engine was a huge one, built for mountain hauling, and the freight cars that lurched out of the forest behind it were huger still. Wisbech could see them rock, and the roar which they made and which the pines flung back grew deafening. Most of the cars had been coupled up in the yards at Montreal, and were covered thick with the <b>dust</b> that had <b>whirled</b> about them along two thousand four hundred miles of track, and they were still speeding on through the forests of the West, as they had done through those of far-off Ontario.|$|R
60|$|Alton sprang forward through it, {{and a big}} {{leather belt}} {{suddenly}} stopped, but the girl could never clearly remember what happened next, for the <b>dust</b> still <b>whirled</b> about her. There, however, {{appeared to be a}} brief altercation, and as Alton moved towards him the other man dropped his hand to his belt. Guessing what the action meant, Alice Deringham shrank back with a little shiver, and her father appeared to grasp the man's shoulder. Alton swayed suddenly sideways, and then hurled himself forward, while next moment two men fell violently against the wrecked machine. One of them seemed to be helpless in the grasp of the other, and staggering clear of the planer they went reeling through the mill. Then there was a splash in the river, and Alton returned alone, breathless and somewhat white in face.|$|R
5|$|Various {{types of}} tornadoes include the {{multiple}} vortex tornado, landspout and waterspout. Waterspouts {{are characterized by}} a spiraling funnel-shaped wind current, connecting to a large cumulus or cumulonimbus cloud. They are generally classified as non-supercellular tornadoes that develop over bodies of water, but there is disagreement over whether to classify them as true tornadoes. These spiraling columns of air frequently develop in tropical areas close to the equator, and are less common at high latitudes. Other tornado-like phenomena that exist in nature include the gustnado, <b>dust</b> devil, fire <b>whirls,</b> and steam devil.|$|R
60|$|The {{country people}} see at times certain apparitions whom they name now 'fallen angels' now 'ancient {{inhabitants}} of the country,' and describe as riding at whiles 'with flowers upon {{the heads of the}} horses.' I have assumed in the sixth poem that these horsemen, now that the times worsen, give way to worse. My last symbol Robert Artisson was an evil spirit much run after in Kilkenny {{at the start of the}} fourteenth century. Are not those who travel in the <b>whirling</b> <b>dust</b> also in the Platonic Year?--W. B. Y.|$|R
60|$|Mills and I {{exchanged}} but a {{few words}} as we walked down towards {{the centre of the}} town. In the chill tempestuous dawn he strolled along musingly, disregarding the discomfort of the cold, the depressing influence of the hour, the desolation of the empty streets in which the dry <b>dust</b> rose in <b>whirls</b> in front of us, behind us, flew upon us from the side streets. The masks had gone home and our footsteps echoed on the flagstones with unequal sound as of men without purpose, without hope.|$|R
60|$|I thought I {{would watch}} for the Count's return, {{and for a long}} time sat doggedly at the window. Then I began to notice that there were some quaint little specks {{floating}} in the rays of the moonlight. They were like the tiniest grains of <b>dust,</b> and they <b>whirled</b> round and gathered in clusters in a nebulous sort of way. I watched them with a sense of soothing, and a sort of calm stole over me. I leaned back in the embrasure in a more comfortable position, so that I could enjoy more fully the aerial gambolling.|$|R
60|$|Blinky was first, {{leading a}} pack horse. Pan {{followed}} next, {{and the other}} four men strung out behind, with bobbing pack horses between. This ridge was the high ground between Marco Valley and Hot Springs Valley. Soon the trail led down, and it was dusty. The rising sun killed the chill in the air, {{and by the time}} the hunters had reached level ground again it was hot. There was alkali dust to breathe, always an abomination. From above, Pan had espied a green spot fifteen miles or more down the valley. A number of <b>dust</b> devils were <b>whirling</b> around it.|$|R
60|$|They went on {{towards the}} thresher, walking delicately among the flinty stubble, {{until they reached}} the edge of the <b>whirling</b> <b>dust.</b> Overhead the straw was rushing down through a haze of smoke. Below, half-naked men toiled savagely about the big machine. Steam was roaring from the engine, for the {{threshers}} were firing recklessly, and the thudding clank of the engine and hum of the clattering mill were almost deafening. There was a constant passing upwards of golden sheaves, a constant downward stream of straw, and the dusty air seemed filled with toiling men and kicking teams.|$|R
60|$|It {{was late}} at night when they rode into the wooden town. Here and there a window was flung open; but the night was thick and dark, and {{there was little to}} see but the <b>dust</b> that <b>whirled</b> about the dimly flitting forms. That, however, was nothing unusual, for of late squadrons of stockriders and droves of weary cattle had passed into the town; and a long row of shadowy frame houses had been left behind before the fears of any citizen were aroused. It was, perhaps, their silent haste that betrayed the horsemen, for they rode in ordered ranks without a word, as men who have grim {{business}} in hand, until a hoarse shout went up. Then a pistol flashed in the darkness in front of them, doors were flung open, lights began to blink, and a half-seen horseman came on at a gallop down the shadowy street. He pulled his horse up within a pistol-shot from the homesteaders, and sat still in his saddle staring at them.|$|R
60|$|It {{had been}} {{arranged}} that {{the bride and}} bridegroom should pass their honeymoon in Brittany, {{and then return to}} Danville's estate near Lyons. The parting was hurried over, as all such partings should be. The carriage had driven off; Trudaine, after lingering long to look after it, had returned hastily to the house; the very <b>dust</b> of the <b>whirling</b> wheels had all dispersed; there was absolutely nothing to see; and yet there stood Monsieur Lomaque at the outer gate; idly, as if he was an independent man--calmly, as if no such responsibilities as the calling of Madame Danville's coach, and the escorting of Madame Danville back to Lyons, could possibly rest on his shoulders.|$|R
60|$|Then, for wheat {{is seldom}} stacked in that country, {{as the days}} grew shorter and the evenings cool, the smoke of the big thrasher {{streaked}} the harvest field, and the wagons went jolting between humming separator and granary, until the later was gorged to repletion and the wheat was stored within a willow framing beneath the chaff and straw that streamed from the chute of the great machine. Winston had around him the best men that dollars could hire, and toiled tirelessly with the grimy host in the <b>whirling</b> <b>dust</b> of the thrasher and amid the sheaves, wherever another pair of hands, or the quick decision that would save an hour's delay, was needed most.|$|R
60|$|Rather overpowering, indeed, {{was it to}} sit on {{the floor}} of Death Valley, miles from the slopes that {{appeared}} so far away. It was flat, salty, alkali or borax ground, crusted and cracked. The glare hurt my eyes. I felt moist, hot, oppressed, in spite of a rather stiff wind. A dry odor pervaded the air, slightly like salty dust. Thin <b>dust</b> devils <b>whirled</b> on the bare flats. A valley-wide mirage shone clear as a mirror along the desert floor to the west, strange, deceiving, a thing both unreal and beautiful. The Panamints towered a wrinkled red grisly mass, broken by rough canyons, with long declines of talus like brown glaciers. Seamed and scarred! Indestructible by past ages, yet surely wearing to ruin! From this point I could not see the snow on the peaks. The whole mountain range seemed an immense red barrier of beetling rock. The Funeral Range was farther away and therefore more impressive. Its effect was stupendous. Leagues of brown chocolate slopes, scarred by slashes of yellow and cream, and shadowed black by sailing clouds, led up to the magnificently peaked and jutted summits.|$|R
