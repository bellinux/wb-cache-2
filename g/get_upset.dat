5|$|The boys of South Park Elementary School are anxiously {{awaiting}} the night's episode of Terrance and Phillip, {{which ended in}} a cliffhanger last season, while the girls at the school express disgust over the show and the boys' obsession with fart jokes. Cartman retaliates by farting in a little girl's face, which causes all the boys to laugh. After school, the boys gather in Cartman's house to watch the episode. To their horror, it is then revealed that, as an April Fools Day joke, the channel is airing a new show called the Queef Sisters, about Canadian sisters Katherine (voiced by Trey Parker) and Katie Queef (voiced by Matt Stone). They {{are very similar to}} Terrance and Phillip, but instead of fart jokes, they make queef jokes. The show starts a queefing movement across the country, and men everywhere <b>get</b> <b>upset</b> and disgusted by the queefs, although the women do not understand what the problem is. Though the women of South Park argue that there is no difference between queefing and farting, the men are revolted by queefs, while still finding their own fart jokes amusing.|$|E

25|$|Often, Vysotsky would {{neglect to}} check the tuning of his guitar, which is {{particularly}} noticeable on earlier recordings. According to some accounts, Vysotsky would <b>get</b> <b>upset</b> when friends would attempt to tune his guitar, leading some {{to believe that he}} preferred to play slightly out of tune as a stylistic choice. Much of this is also attributable to the fact that a guitar that is tuned down more than 1 whole step (Vysotsky would sometimes tune as much as 2 and a half steps down) is prone to intonation problems.|$|E

When Demonius points out that his guests are having fun regardless, Satan flies into a rage. The guests <b>get</b> <b>upset</b> and start to leave, and Satan realizes that, in trying to have a party like the girls on My Super Sweet 16, he became like one of them.

25|$|Although fantasy {{comes from}} an imaginative realm, Martin sees an honest {{necessity}} to reflect the real world where people die sometimes ugly deaths, even beloved people. The deaths of supernumerary extras or orcs have no major effect on readers, whereas a friend's death has much more emotional impact. Martin kills off main characters because he finds it very irritating to know early in the story who as the hero will come through unscathed. Martin dislikes this lack of realism, comparing the situation to a soldier scared the night before a battle. Martin wants his readers to feel {{that no one is}} safe as they turn the page. Martin prefers a hero's sacrifice to say something profound about human nature, and points readers not wanting to <b>get</b> <b>upset</b> or disturbed to the plenty of books for comfort reading.|$|E
25|$|To begin, affective {{emotions}} {{and the effect}} infidelity has on affective jealousy. Both {{men and women alike}} feel some kind of jealousy when they suspect their significant other is being unfaithful (Johnson, 2017). If some individual suspects {{that he or she is}} being cheated on they begin to question their partners actions and may possibly act in more frustrated ways towards them than they normally would. For example, they may ask more questions about the whereabouts of their partner or <b>get</b> <b>upset</b> more frequently and more often whenever they feel that their partner is lying or going out without them. Bursts of frustration without thinking it through or realizing why an individual is having those emotions can be an affective response in a difficult situation. The affective use of jealousy in a seemingly unfaithful relationship is caused by the accusing partner anticipating the infidelity from the other.|$|E

[...] "One thing we are very conscious of—and I know some fans <b>get</b> <b>upset</b> about this—is we really try to treat the characters as living, breathing, well-rounded individuals.

[...] "People <b>get</b> <b>upset</b> {{because they think it}} is not natural to skip and stutter the music. But I do it because it is natural. The stuttering can help you create a new groove", he said. The track starts with a [...] "strummy" [...] acoustic guitar introduction, as described by Michael Paoletta from Billboard, on the four-chord progression of Bm–Fm–A–E sequence. The folk rock inspired song has elements of electronica and folk at its core. Its rhythm is [...] produced by a four piece bass drum—which fades in and out abruptly—and atmospheric synth-strings, which are added later in the song.|$|E

500|$|He {{returned}} to writing scripts for British television, including Gentry with Roger Daltrey for ITV in 1987, and the 1989 adaptation of Susan Hill's novel The Woman in Black for transmission on ITV on Christmas Eve. Lynne Truss, reviewing a repeat {{broadcast of the}} production on Channel 4 for The Times in 1994, wrote that: [...] "Clip-clop is not usually a noise to <b>get</b> <b>upset</b> about. But {{it will be an}} interesting test, today, to go up behind people and whisper 'clip-clop', to find out whether they saw The Woman in Black last night. People who made the bold decision to watch this excellent drama will respond to any 'clip-clop' by gratifyingly leaping in the air and grabbing the backs of their necks." [...] The adaptation nearly went unmade; Kneale had written the script in ten days but been advised by his agent to wait before submitting it to the producers Central Independent Television so that they would not think he had rushed it. When he did submit the script three weeks later, he discovered that Central had been about to cancel the production as they had assumed that Kneale, then 67, {{had not been able to}} complete the work due to his age.|$|E
500|$|Dwarves {{need to be}} {{provided}} with food and drink (mostly {{in the form of}} alcohol). A dwarf will get negative thoughts for drinking plain water and even for drinking the same type of alcohol, making it necessary to grow different crops for producing different drinks. Things like not having a separate bedroom can upset a dwarf. They may make friends and sometimes marry; females give birth. Dwarves can <b>get</b> <b>upset</b> by sustaining injuries, having poor clothing, losing their pets, friends or relatives; interacting with or seeing their corpses can aggravate this. A frustrated dwarf may break furniture or attack others. Continuous stress will cause them to throw tantrums and eventually go insane, whether going [...] and attacking their comrades in a homicidal rage, becoming suicidally depressed and jumping off a cliff, or simply going [...] "stark raving mad" [...] and stumbling around randomly until their untimely death. Their quality of life can be improved by giving them luxurious personal bedrooms and a well-decorated dining room, medical care, and providing them with a variety of drinks and well-cooked meals. A chain reaction where a single dwarf's unhappiness causes the entire fortress's population to start throwing tantrums can begin when one dwarf throws a tantrum, attacks and kills another one with many friends, which drastically affects the happiness of many more.|$|E
500|$|According to Stevens, {{in one of}} {{his first}} games as head coach, he was nervous and [...] "felt like our team played on edge" [...] because of it. He decided that a team's play will reflect the mood of its coach; a calm coach means a team that will remain poised in {{difficult}} game situations, while a nervous coach means a team that plays on edge. [...] "I don’t want to lose a game because of my approach," [...] he told himself. Accordingly, he developed a strategy of always remaining calm and focused during games. He rarely raises his voice or gets emotional, instead quietly observing on the sideline with folded arms. He does not <b>get</b> <b>upset</b> about bad calls by referees or player mistakes, preferring to focus on [...] "the next play" [...] rather than what just happened. Butler player Willie Veasley explained Butler's 2010 Final Four run by saying, [...] "When those big runs [...] came, Coach called a timeout and said a few calm words. Then he said he believes in us, he loves us and we're going to win the game." [...] On the rare occasion Stevens feels the need to correct a player, he does it with [...] "positive reinforcement, just at a little louder decibel", according to former assistant coach Matthew Graves. Above all, Stevens wants his players to be confident, not living in fear of being yanked for making a bad play.|$|E

500|$|Sportswriters {{and fans}} have {{frequently}} called for Henderson to be {{inducted into the}} Hockey Hall of Fame on the strength of his performance. [...] Commentator and former NHL coach Don Cherry argued that Henderson's status as hero of the [...] "greatest series in hockey history" [...] was enough to qualify him. [...] Henderson himself does not believe he belongs: [...] "So many Canadians <b>get</b> <b>upset</b> that I’m not in the Hall of Fame, and I tell them all the time if I was on the committee, I wouldn’t vote for me. Quite frankly, I didn’t have a Hall of Fame career." [...] Henderson has been honoured by Canada's Sports Hall of Fame on two occasions: he was first inducted as an individual in 1995, and again ten years later along with his 1972 teammates. The Summit Series team has also been honoured with a star on Canada's Walk of Fame. Henderson has been inducted into the Ontario Sports Hall of Fame (1997), the IIHF Hall of Fame (2013) and has been honoured by Hockey Canada with the Order of Hockey in Canada as part of its 2013 class. He was named a Member of the Order of Canada in December 2012 in recognition of [...] "his engagement in support of a range of social and charitable causes" [...] along with his achievements on the ice. In 2014, he was named to the Order of Ontario.|$|E

During the mixing process for the album, Iommi and Butler had a falling out with Dio. Misinformed by their then-current mixing engineer, Iommi and Butler accused Dio of sneaking into the studio at night to raise the volume of his vocals. In addition, Dio was not satisfied with the pictures of him in the artwork. Butler also accused Dio and Appice of working on a solo album during the album's mixing without telling the other members of Black Sabbath. [...] "Ronnie wanted more say in things," [...] Iommi said. [...] "And Geezer would <b>get</b> <b>upset</b> with him and that is where the rot set in. Live Evil is when it all fell apart. Ronnie wanted to do more of his own thing, and the engineer we were using at the time in the studio didn't know what to do, because Ronnie was telling him one thing and we were telling him another. At the end of the day, we just said, 'That's it, the band is over'". [...] "When it comes time for the vocal, nobody tells me what to do. Nobody! Because they're not as good as me, so I do what I want to do," [...] Dio later said. [...] "I refuse to listen to Live Evil, because there are too many problems. If you look at the credits, the vocals and drums are listed off to the side. Open up the album and see how many pictures there are of Tony, and how many there are of me and Vinny".|$|E

The next day, Bart's class stops at the Krusty Burger after a field trip and Bart is shocked to discover Homer sitting at a booth alone. Homer comes clean and explains to Bart that his job interview did not go so well when his interviewer, the Rich Texan, discovered that Homer knows nothing about copper tubing. Bart convinces Homer that he should tell Marge what has happened and Homer calls her from a pay phone. But when Homer hears Marge’s happy voice he cannot bring himself to disappoint her and tell her the truth about his [...] "new" [...] job. Instead he concocts a story about him having to fly on the [...] "company" [...] jet for work and instructs Marge to meet him at the airport in an hour. Homer pays a Marine to fly him into the air, so he can tell Marge up in the air with luxury so she would not <b>get</b> <b>upset.</b> Once in the air, Marge cannot believe all the luxuries the private jet has to offer. Homer sits Marge down to tell her the truth, but just before he can, the plane endures turbulence. Homer and Marge head into the cockpit to see what the problem is, only to discover that the pilot had passed out. Homer shoves the pilot aside and takes hold of the jet’s controls. As the jet is about to hit the ocean, Marge pulls the jet's yoke up giving the jet altitude. Marge pulls out her cell phone and calls Colby Kraus and frantically asks for his guidance. Thanks to Colby's motivation, Homer manages to land the plane safely on the ground, however, his attempt to taxi back to the terminal fails and the plane falls into the ocean. After being airlifted out of the plane, Homer explains to Marge that flying in private jets is simply too dangerous and that he plans {{to go back to work}} at the Power Plant.|$|E
