40|$|AbstractSouth Sumatera Province is a {{belonging}} wealthy {{province in}} Indonesia, but {{quality of life}} of many people still underline in poverty. The bigger potential of natural sources are natural rubber. Therefore technology innovation roadmap to industrial development of rubber-raw material in South Sumatera Province should be created and developed. That's important to orientation and increasing added-value of natural rubber products. It's become a lower course industrial of higher competitiveness and then increasing prosperity people of South Sumatera Province. Research has done with collaboration of several crumb <b>rubber</b> <b>industrial,</b> the R&D of South Sumatera Province, and incubator centre of rubber finished goods development. They should be produced of various rubber products with application SHIP Approach and Appropriate Technology in surveys and reviews.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the dynamic response of <b>industrial</b> <b>rubbers</b> (styrene-butadiene random copolymers, SBR) in torsion and compare against common small amplitude oscillatory shear measurements {{by using a}} torsion rectangular fixture, a modified torsion cylindrical fixture, and a conventional parallel plate fixture, respectively, in two different rheometers (ARES 2 kFRTN 1 from TA Instruments, USA and MCR 702 from Anton Paar-Physica, Austria). The effects of specimen geometry (length-to-width aspect ratio) on storage modulus and level of clamping are investigated. For cylindrical specimens undergoing torsional deformation, we find that geometry and clamping barely affect the shear moduli, and the measurements essentially coincide with those using parallel plates. In contrast, a clear dependence of the storage modulus on the aspect ratio is detected for specimens having rectangular cross section. The empirical correction used routinely in this test is based on geometrical factors and can account for clamping effects, but works only for aspect ratios above a threshold value of 1. 4. By employing a finite element analysis, we perform a parametric study {{of the effects of}} the aspect ratio in the cross-sectional stress distribution and the linear viscoelastic torsional response. We propose a new, improved empirical equation for obtaining accurate moduli values in torsion at different aspect ratios, whose general validity is demonstrated in both rheometers. These results should provide a guideline for measurements with different elastomers, for which comparison with dynamic oscillatory tests may not be possible due to wall slip issues...|$|R
50|$|The initial {{milk tank}} wagon designs {{were based on}} a 12 ft two axle railway wagon chassis. There was a ladder either side to allow filling via an <b>industrial</b> <b>rubber</b> hose into a {{flip-top}} dome casing, while a steel pipe exited {{at the bottom of the}} tank with a tap either end of the chassis between the buffer beams for extraction. All designs unlike typical goods wagons used vacuum braking, due to their high-speed deployment. The various designs that railway companies used followed a common pattern, but even at this early stage differences appeared making them easy to spot. While GWR designs used flat-strip metal as bracing, LMS and SR designs used rounded steel bracing. SR designs had additional V-shaped support bracing either end, and had additional wooden packing behind each of the buffers. LMS designs had a catwalk around the filling dome.|$|E
5000|$|Her {{breakthrough}} {{came with}} her Black Acrylic collection (1986-1989). Gralnick began making brooches from black acrylic sheet, using geometric forms described as recalling [...] "machines and architecture" [...] but that [...] "also read as pure abstraction". Her black acrylic brooches maintained {{the connection to}} jewelry by contrasting matt and polished surfaces {{and the addition of}} precious materials like gold. It originated from an encounter with [...] "a house that had been sheathed in black rubber by its eccentric owner. The <b>industrial</b> <b>rubber,</b> entirely inappropriate for a residence, rendered the house rather mysterious." [...] She was also inspired by record that shattered in her apartment. [...] "Gralnick glued the broken vinyl pieces of the record into a small houselike structure that sat on her bench for about a year before she began her investigations into acrylic, which eventually led to this breakthrough series." [...] Her work was not only a statement on wealth and privilege, but a reaction to American studio jewelry of the time. Gralnick's turn to black fits within a larger aesthetic shift in the jewelry and fine art world in the 1980s and 1990s, where dark themes such as death, trauma and postindustrial decay were common as artists grappled {{with the end of the}} Cold War, the spread of AIDs, a worldwide economic recession, and the fin de siècle cultural fears of the coming new millennium. The collection garnered attention for its bold and surreal quality at the time, and in 2002 the American Craft Museum included some of Gralnick's [...] "black work" [...] in an exhibition and catalog of jewelry from the 1980s called [...] "Zero Karat". This collection emphasized the desire of jewelers of the 1980s to move away from the traditional use of gold and stones to make jewelry.|$|E
