40|$|In {{the present}} paper some macroscopical {{observations}} on red lymphonodus of goats are described it being author's aim to clarify the anatomical structure and physiological meaning of the tissues. Twentyfive goats were examined of ages ranging from foetus to 2 years old (Table. 1). The results obtained are summarized as follows : 1) The number of red lymphonodi in one body was 0 - 154, 53 being the average. However, the individual deviation {{was so great that}} the author could not discern definite relations between the number of red lymphonodi and sexes or diseases etc. (Table. 2). 2) There were tendencies to indicate that the large, deep-coloured red lymphonodi and ellipsoidal or flat forms become numerous with increase of age (Tables 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7). 3) About 94 % {{of the total number of}} the red lymphonodi detected in examined goats were under 5 mm in diameter (Table 3). 4) Localization of the red lymphonodus showed individual difference. However, it is situated usually in the aorta regions, otherwise it is found also at retropharyngei, submaxillares, cervicales craniales, cervicules mediales, cervicales caudales, axillares, mediastinales craniales, bifurcationis pharyngei, diaphragmaticus, mediastinales caudales, mesenterici, renales, porta hepatis, gastrici, <b>iliaci</b> laterales, V. portae, omentales, and cavwn pelvis. Among these regions in which the author observed the red lymphonodus, the regions of retropharyngei, diaphragmaticus <b>iliaci</b> laterales, and omentales were not discussed in TEJIMA's report. So the appearance of red lymphonodi in these several regions in goats is a first-finding of the present author (Table 8). 5) In embryos or new born animals within two days, the author could find them in the region of aorta only, however, in specimens older than five days the distribution of these bodies became wide throughout the regions above mentioned. 6) According to their colours and forms, the author classified the red lymphonodi into 36 types (Table 9). Generally the light-coloured and globe-shaped ones were numerous : this tendency was especially clear in young animals (Table 10). 7) The author found a number of abnormally shaped nodi, which may be differentiated into the following types; the combined-form, the fat-included-form, the spotted-form and the complicated-form. A great number of abnormal forms were found in the neighbourhood of large arteries. Most of the combined forms in which the red lymphonodi were combined with normal lymphonodi, and also the fat-included-forms, were light coloured. Most of the combined forms in which the red lymphonodi combined with each other were dark coloured...|$|R
40|$|The article {{analyzes}} {{the features of}} the structure of the lymphoid lobules of the parenchyma of the superficial somatic (Limphonodi subiliaci, L. cervicales superficiales), profund somatic (L. axillares proprii L. poplitei), somatovisceral (L. <b>iliaci</b> mediales, L. retropharyngei mediales) and visceral (L. mediastinales caudales, L. ileocolici) lymph nodes of newborn bull calves of domestic cattle. To visualize clearly the boundaries of the structural components of lymphoid lobules we used the author’s modification of the impregnation of total median frozen histological sections with silver nitrate. We have established a high level of tissue differentiation of the lymph nodes, a significant development of the lymphoid parenchyma, the division of the parenchyma into lymphoid lobules, the presence in the lobules of all the main structural components that are represented by two morphotypes. The first morphotype is ribbon-like perisinusoidal cords (interfollicular zone, paracortical and medullary cords). The second morphotype is rounded lymphoid formations (central zones of deep cortex units, lymphatic nodules). Lymphoid lobules are located along the marginal sinus in one row, they are better developed and differentiated in the visceral lymph nodes. In all the lymph nodes, the lymphoid lobules have a similar histoarchitectonic, and each structural component of the lymphoid lobules has a specific architectonic of the reticular meshwork and the density of the location of the fibroblastic reticulocytes. We determined that the structures of the first morphotype which provide the migration of lymphocytes, the detection of antigens and the accumulation of plasmocytes are more developed. We have established that the relative volume of structures of the first morphotype is 4. 5 – 8. 0 times larger than the volume of the structures of the second morphotype, which provide clonal proliferation of T and B lymphocytes, especially in deep somatic lymph nodes. Among the zones of the second morphotype, predominate T-dependent zones, the relative volume of which considerably exceeds the volume of B-dependent zones (lymphoid nodules) : in the superficial somatic lymph nodes by 14 – 30 times, profound somatic by 12 – 14 times, somatovisceral by 6 – 7 times and visceral by 4. 5 – 5. 5 times. We determined that lymphatic nodules can form in different parts of compartments: in the interfollicular zone and paracortical cords of all lymph nodes and in the medullary cords of the visceral lymph nodes. The study shows that the parenchyma of the lymph nodes of newborn bull calves has a high degree of maturity, contains a full set of structural markers of immunocompetence, among which predominate the components that support lymphocyte migration, antigen detection and accumulation of plasma cells...|$|R
40|$|This article {{analyzes}} {{patterns of}} structural and functional {{organization of the}} parenchyma of different groups of lymph nodes, structural features of their connective tissue frame and lymphatic sinuses. We studied superficial and deep somatic (Limphonodi mandibulares, L. cervicales superficiales, L. axillares proprii, L. poplitei), somatovisceral (L.  retropharyngei mediales, L. <b>iliaci</b> mediales), visceral (L. mediastinales caudales, L. jejunales) features of mature male dromedaries (Camelus dromedarius Linnaeus, 1758). We used a complex of traditional macroscopic and histological techniques, and also immunohistochemical staining of lymph node sections for identifying the features of localization of T- and B-lymphocyte populations in the parenchyma of the nodes. We found that the parenchyma of camels’ lymph nodes {{is characterized by a}} spongy type structure {{in the form of a}} complex of partly concrescent round-oval fragments of lymphoid tissue, surrounded by large lymphatic spaces (sinuses). The connective tissue frame of the lymph nodes is represented by a two-layer (connective tissue-muscular) capsule and two types of trabeculae: two-layered (connective-muscular, type I), which contain blood and lymphatic vessels, as well as lymphatic cysternas, and single-layered, formed only by a smooth muscular system (type II). Intranodal lymphatic sinuses are subdivided into subcapsular, peritrabecular and medullary sinuses. The subcapsular sinuses and sinuses related to trabeculae of type I and their branching is the most developed. At the tissue level, the lymph node parenchyma has a clearly manifested lobular structure. Lymphoid lobules in the lymph node parenchyma are positioned diffusely (mosaically) and consist of four main cellular zones: transit and cell-cell interaction (analogous to the cortical plateau), clonal proliferation of T- and, respectively, B-lymphocytes (deep cortex units, lymphatic nodules), accumulation of plasmocytes and synthesis of antibodies (brain cords). The lymphoid lobes (compartments) of the lymph nodes parenchyma are bipolar, their tops formed by the zones of transit and cell-cell interaction, and also by the zones of proliferation of B lymphocytes, and the bases by a complex of brain cords (zone of accumulation of plasmocytes and synthesis of antibodies). The zone of T-lymphocytes proliferation is in intermediate position and underlies the subunits of the parenchyma. The tops of the lymphoid lobes are located along the sinuses of the trabeculae of type I and the bases along the sinuses of the trabeculae of type II, which form the efferent lymphatic vessels. The maximum relative capacity of all studied lymph nodes was typical for zones of plasmocyte accumulation and synthesis of antibodies (19 – 27 %), the minimum capacity was typical for transit and cell-cell interaction zones (3 – 8 %). The relative capacity of zones of clonal proliferation of T- and B-lymphocytes in most lymph nodes was 1. 5 – 3. 0 times less than that of the zone of plasmocyte accumulation and antibody formation and was, respectively, 8 – 16 % and 9 – 18 %. The study showed that the structure of the lymph nodes parenchyma of dromedaries is not absolutely unique. As in other mammal species, it is subdivided into specialized cell zones which are connected in lymphoid lobules. Specific features of parenchyma structure include: diffuse (mosaic) location of lymphoid lobules; absence of signs of regulated localization of lymphoid lobules relative to the capsule and the sinus bordering the nodes...|$|R

40|$|The {{healing of}} large {{segmental}} bone defects caused by degenerative, inflammatory or traumatic diseases pose a major clinical and socioeconomic problem. Current treatment methods for {{the reconstruction of}} large segmental bone defects include bone distraction, vascularised, autologous or allogenic bone grafting and even cages that are used as scaffolds. Because of procedure associated complications, such as pin infections in the Ilizarov-technique or an increased donor site morbidity, the risk of infection, poor healing rates and the frequently insufficient amount of recovered bone, {{there has been a}} longstanding history of research in this field. The aim {{of this study was to}} examine a 40 mm osteotomy defect model, stabilised by a hybrid ring fixator, in the tibia of the sheep and its qualification to enable the investigations of regenerative therapies. In particular, as such a therapeutic approach, a poly-l-(lactid) -ε-caprolacton/β-tricalciumphosphat-scaffold was put into the 40 mm tibial defect and tested if it is qualified to support the regeneration in a critical segmental bone defect. Additionally, in one group the PCL/β-TCP-scaffold was filled with autologous bone graft to investigate its effect in combination with the bone substitute on the bone defect healing. Twelve merino-mix-sheep were randomly assigned in two groups. A 40 mm osteotomy defect in the right tibia was set and stabilised by a hybrid ring fixator. In the first group the osteotomy defect was filled with the scaffold alone, which was formed into hollow cylindrical shape. In the second group the hollow cylindrical shaped scaffold was filled with autologous cancellous bone from the <b>iliaci</b> crest. Twelve weeks after surgical treatment, the defect zone was removed for radiological, histomorphological, histomorphometrical and immunhistochemical examination of the defect healing. The hybrid ring fixator used in this study proved to be an adequate stabilization system for the study of regenerative therapies in a 40 mm osteotomy defect model. And also the use of the composit scaffold (PCL-β-TCP) proved to be appropriate to support the regeneration in a segmental critical size defect. It remained stable in its form, served as a placeholder in the defect, prevented a prolapse of soft or muscle tissue into the defect and allowed by its microstructure and migration of cells and ingrowth of loose connective tissue and blood vessels. By combining the scaffold (chronOS strip®) and autologous cancellous bone the bone formation was initially accelerated and also increased, but not statistically significant. After twelve weeks the second group (chronOS strip® + ABG) showed an advanced healing result. After eight weeks the radiographs showed two animals of this group with a bridging of the 40 mm osteotomy defect and an increased callus formation after twelve weeks. According to the histomorphometrical investigations after 12 weeks in both groups, the main part was formed of connective tissue. Conforming to the new bone formation neither the computertomographic nor the histomorphometric measurements showed a significant increase of new bone formation by autologous bone graft compared to the first group. Certainly, in the second group some animals showed increased results. The bone mineral density and the bone mineral content in both groups showed similar median values. Two animals in the second group showed a unilateral bony bridging of the defect on the lateral side with partially already remodeled bone tissue organized to lamellar bone. Histologically, there was no further qualitative difference in the new formed bone, only the cortical bone in the second group appeared loosened. The vascularization and the osteoclast density were similar in both groups. Hence, the delay of the defect healing is not due to the insufficient vascularization or excessive bone resorption by osteoclasts. In both groups the onset of degradation of the scaffold by giant cells could be observed in a similar fashion. The addition of autologous bone graft (group 2) resulted for some animals in a distinct increase of new bone formation, vascularization, osteoclast and giant cell density. However, no statistically significant difference was achieved compared between the groups. Nonetheless, the used scaffold served in both groups as a guiding structure that enabled the ingrowth of loose connective tissue, vessels, osteoclasts and giant cells into the defect...|$|R
