5|$|In 1948 Kathleen married Frank Cole, a World War II veteran, {{and moved}} the family to Virginia. Godwin was further {{inspired}} by her mother's determination to continue writing after having a second child. According to Godwin, {{much of her time}} growing up was spent in the newsroom, where her mother worked. She also witnessed her mother's plays and novels being rejected. Godwin's autobiography creates the impression that much of her own writing was intended to accomplish the things <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> <b>could</b> not. As Cole's salary increased {{and he was able to}} support the family, Godwin's mother focused on being a wife and homemaker, eventually not writing at all.|$|E
5|$|The {{family moved}} to Sawbridgeworth, Hertfordshire while Davison was still a baby; {{until the age of}} 11 she was educated at home. When her parents moved the family back to London she went to a day school, then spent a year {{studying}} in Dunkirk, France. When she was 13 she attended Kensington High School and later won a bursary to Royal Holloway College in 1891 to study literature. Her father died in early 1893 and she was forced to end her studies because <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> <b>could</b> not afford the fees of £20 a term.|$|E
5|$|During this period, Copeland {{received}} {{far more}} personal {{attention from the}} Bradley family than <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> <b>could</b> give each of her six children. Raised in a lapsed Christian household, when Copeland lived with the Bradley family, she attended their synagogue and celebrated Shabbat with them, enjoying their family's closeness. In addition to Bradley's intensive ballet training, her husband, a modern-dance teacher, served as Copeland's pas-de-deux instructor and partner. The summer before her fifteenth birthday, Bradley began to homeschool Copeland for 10th grade to free up more time for dance. At fifteen years old, Copeland won {{first place in the}} Los Angeles Music Center Spotlight Awards at the Chandler Pavilion in March 1998. Copeland said {{it was the first time}} she ever battled nervousness. The winners received scholarships between $500 and $2500. Copeland's victory in the 10th annual contest among gifted high school students in Southern California secured her recognition by the Los Angeles Times as the best young dancer in the Greater Los Angeles Area.|$|E

6000|$|Letty {{smiled at}} him approvingly, then went to comfort <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> who <b>could</b> not recover her tranquillity so soon. But Christie stood aloof, looking at her lover with {{something}} more than admiration in the face that kindled beautifully as she exclaimed: ...|$|R
50|$|Their <b>mother</b> <b>could</b> {{not afford}} to raise both of them, so she gave Patricia Susan Lamb up for {{adoption}} when she was five months old. She was adopted by Hector and Gladys Wilson who also lived in Aldershot. They renamed her Ann Patricia Wilson. When Ann was 14, her aunt {{told her that she}} was adopted. When she asked <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> if she was adopted, <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> told Ann that she was adopted because <b>her</b> birth <b>mother</b> <b>could</b> not care for her and that Ann's birth <b>mother</b> allowed <b>her</b> (Gladys) to care for Ann.|$|R
5|$|A {{paramedic}} is let into a {{house to}} the sounds of panic. Earlier, the fastidious Angela prepares to host a party for the 79th birthday of her mother, Maggie. Angela's daughter, Katie, heads to her room to complete her homework. When Angela moves a cake, she reveals the head of Jim, her husband. Jim plans to play a trick on Pat—a practical joker and the husband of Angela's sister, Carol (a recovering alcoholic)—by hiding under the cake. Maggie, Carol and Pat—the latter wearing a wolf mask—arrive at the house. As the three settle, Pat plugs in his mobile to charge—something Jim had asked Angela to prevent—and secretly places ice in a bucket. Carol privately drinks from a sunscreen bottle while ostensibly unblocking the toilet after <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> <b>could</b> not flush it. Angela is proud that the party food is from Marks's, but Carol mocks Angela's middle class affectations. Maggie wants a photograph with the food on the table, and Carol lights the cake's candles, which burn towards to the flammable fake cake—under which Jim is still hiding. Katie greets her nana and aunt, with Maggie insisting that she tell the joke from Pat's card. Panicking, Angela blows out the candles. The room clears, and Jim is left frustrated.|$|E
500|$|Verna confesses {{that she}} once sexually {{assaulted}} former professional basketball player Scottie Pippen. When Pete tells Tracy that actress Novella Nelson {{will be his}} [...] "mother", Tracy says he had his sights on actress Phylicia Rashad or professional tennis player Serena Williams to be his [...] "mother". When Liz learns that <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> <b>could</b> have been an astronaut's wife, Margaret explains {{that it was not}} that simple as she had just graduated from secretary school and got a job as a secretary at Sterling Cooper. The latter is a fictional advertising agency on the AMC program Mad Men. In addition, actor Jon Hamm, who plays the lead role on Mad Men, has had a recurring role on 30 Rock as a love interest for Tina Fey's character. Later, Liz gets angry at her mother's admission of not marrying Buzz Aldrin and tells her that actress Laura Linney [...] "could've played you in the HBO original movie Moon Wives." ...|$|E
500|$|Byron had {{arranged}} for Allegra to be educated in the convent precisely because he, unlike his former lover Clairmont, thought favourably of the manners and attitudes of Italian women who had received convent educations. [...] He disapproved {{of what he called}} Clairmont's [...] "loose morals" [...] and [...] "Bedlam behavior" [...] and didn't want her to influence Allegra. He also believed that his daughter, given her illegitimacy, would have a far better chance of marrying well in Italy than she would in England. A Roman Catholic girl with a suitable dowry, raised in a convent, would have a decent chance of marrying into high Italian society. He wanted the child to become a Roman Catholic, which he viewed as the [...] "best religion." [...] "If Claire thinks that she shall ever interfere with the child's morals or education, she mistakes; she never shall," [...] wrote Byron in a letter to Richard Belgrave Hoppner in September 1820. [...] "The girl shall be a Christian and a married woman, if possible." [...] <b>Her</b> <b>mother</b> <b>could</b> see Allegra, he added, only with the [...] "proper restrictions." [...] Byron wrote to Hoppner in March 1821 that Allegra would receive better care in the convent than she would with him. His mistress, Teresa, Countess Guiccioli, had had a happy experience at the convent boarding school where she had lived from the age of five, and had persuaded Byron that a convent school would be the best place for Allegra. He also viewed the convent as the safest place for her with revolution brewing in the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies.|$|E
50|$|Years after Alexander Hamilton's death, Angelica's {{condition}} {{reached a}} point where <b>her</b> aging <b>mother</b> <b>could</b> no longer care for her. Angelica was eventually placed in the care of a Dr. MacDonald of Flushing, Queens, where she remained {{for the rest of her}} life.|$|R
5000|$|She {{was raised}} in the Byzantine {{tradition}} and spoke fluent Greek, which she learned from <b>her</b> <b>mother.</b> She <b>could</b> write French, Italian, and possibly Latin, but throughout her life spoke mainly Greek. Due to her outspoken manner, Pope Pius II called her the [...] "Greek torrent".|$|R

2500|$|When Bow was 16, {{her mother}} Sarah fell from a second-story window and {{suffered}} a severe head injury. She was later diagnosed with [...] "psychosis due to epilepsy". From her earliest years, Bow had {{learned how to}} care for her mother during the seizures, as well as how to deal with her psychotic and hostile episodes. She said <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> <b>could</b> be [...] "mean" [...] to her, but [...] "didn't mean to... she couldn't help it". Still, Bow felt deprived of her childhood; [...] "As a kid I took care of my mother, she didn't take care of me". Sarah worsened gradually, and when she realized her daughter was set for a movie career, Bow's mother told her she [...] "would be much better off dead". One night in February 1922, Bow awoke to a butcher knife held against her throat by her mother. Clara was able to fend off the attack, and locked her mother up. In the morning, Bow's mother had no recollection of the episode, and later she was committed to a sanatorium by Robert Bow.|$|E
2500|$|Throughout {{the early}} 1920s, {{following}} a disastrous {{investment in a}} failed gypsum mine, Earhart's inheritance from her grandmother, which was now administered by her mother, steadily diminished until it was exhausted, [...] Consequently, with no immediate prospects for recouping her investment in flying, Earhart sold the [...] "Canary" [...] {{as well as a}} second Kinner and bought a yellow Kissel [...] "Speedster" [...] two-passenger automobile, which she named the [...] "Yellow Peril". Simultaneously, Earhart experienced an exacerbation of her old sinus problem as her pain worsened and in early 1924 she was hospitalized for another sinus operation, which was again unsuccessful. After trying her hand at a number of unusual ventures that included setting up a photography company, Earhart set out in a new direction. Following her parents' divorce in 1924, she drove her mother in the [...] "Yellow Peril" [...] on a transcontinental trip from California with stops throughout the West and even a jaunt up to Banff, Alberta. The meandering tour eventually brought the pair to Boston, Massachusetts, where Earhart underwent another sinus operation, which was more successful. After recuperation, she returned to Columbia University for several months but was forced to abandon her studies and any further plans for enrolling at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology because <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> <b>could</b> no longer afford the tuition fees and associated costs. Soon after, she found employment first as a teacher, then as a social worker in 1925 at Denison House, a Boston settlement house. At this time, she lived in Medford, Massachusetts.|$|E
60|$|Alison winced, for {{she remembered}} that <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> <b>could</b> on {{occasion}} be painfully rude.|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, Aria {{attempts}} {{to tell the}} truth about her father to <b>her</b> <b>mother,</b> but 'A' tells <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> before she <b>could.</b> This led to her parents' separation and her brother, Mike's, change in behavior.|$|R
50|$|Mezulla had {{a temple}} {{in the holy}} city of Arinna, which was the second most {{important}} in the city after that of <b>her</b> <b>mother.</b> No other temples of Mezulla are known, but worship of her is also attested in Ḫattuša, Taḫurpa, and other north Hittite cities. Like <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> she <b>could</b> also be worshipped {{in the form of a}} silver solar disc.|$|R
5000|$|Zintuḫi, {{whose name}} is Hattian for [...] "granddaughter", was worshipped along with <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> and grandmother. Like <b>her</b> <b>mother,</b> she <b>could</b> be invoked as an {{intermediary}} with the Sun goddess of Arinna. Queen Puduḫepa mentions her with the unclear epithet [...] "Clothes pin on her breast." [...] She had her own temple in Arinna, {{but she was not}} otherwise worshipped separately from the Sun goddess of Arinna.|$|R

60|$|Tata said {{something}} in a voice so low that <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> <b>could</b> not make it out.|$|E
60|$|<b>Her</b> <b>mother</b> <b>could</b> not repress her {{consciousness}} of the nuptial vision conjured up by the girl's consent.|$|E
60|$|Clara was {{conscious}} {{that she was}} thoroughly dissatisfied with <b>her</b> <b>mother,</b> but she <b>could</b> not exactly say why it was so. She did return <b>her</b> <b>mother's</b> kiss, but she did it coldly, and with lips that were not eager.|$|R
60|$|She {{turned and}} left the room. As she mounted the stairs that led to her own and her sister's rooms on the floor above, <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> helplessly followed. Irene went first to her own room {{at the front of}} the house, and then came out leaving the door open and the gas flaring behind <b>her.</b> The <b>mother</b> <b>could</b> see that she had tumbled many things out of the drawers of her bureau upon the marble top.|$|R
60|$|As she was {{thinking}} of this Mrs. Trevelyan came into the room. Nora felt that though she might dread to meet <b>her</b> <b>mother,</b> she <b>could</b> be bold enough on such an occasion before her sister. Emily had not done so well with her own affairs, as to enable her to preach with advantage about marriage.|$|R
6000|$|There was no apology in her tone; it {{was rather}} that of one who was defying censure; and <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> <b>could</b> only gasp out—- ...|$|E

50|$|While {{investigating}} a fake goods case, Sai and Kiu encounter Kiu's {{father at the}} hub of were all the activity takes place. Kiu suspects her father is still {{up to no good}} especially since <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> seems to be in need of money fast. To Kiu's surprise the money <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> is desperate for is given to another man and not her father. Kiu discovers this other man in <b>her</b> <b>mother's</b> life <b>could</b> do great damage to her family.|$|R
60|$|The {{two women}} went on talking in whispers. Elsa had heard, of course, what they said: {{and since she}} was alone a hot blush of shame mounted to her cheeks. It was horrid of people to talk in that way about her future husband, and she marvelled how <b>her</b> own <b>mother</b> <b>could</b> lend herself to such gossip.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, REALLY! And {{when you}} say the wives of the doctors share these jealousies----Mrs. McGanum and I haven't any {{particular}} crush on each other; she's so stolid. But <b>her</b> <b>mother,</b> Mrs. Westlake--nobody <b>could</b> be sweeter." ...|$|R
6000|$|All Henrietta's {{consideration}} for <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> <b>could</b> not {{prevent her from}} bursting into tears. [...] "O mamma, I {{did not know it}} would be so like going away from dear grandmamma." ...|$|E
60|$|She flitted {{away into}} the {{darkness}} with a little broken laugh. She passed me {{half an hour later}} in the Customs' house with a languid impassive stare which even <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> <b>could</b> not have excelled.|$|E

5000|$|Eliza Courtney {{was born}} in France, in Aix-en-Provence on 20 February 1792. She was brought to Falloden, Northumberland in {{northern}} England and adopted by her paternal grandparents. Unlike <b>her</b> <b>mother's</b> legitimate children from her marriage, Eliza was not raised {{as part of the}} Devonshire House set in London. <b>Her</b> <b>mother,</b> Georgiana, <b>could</b> not acknowledge her daughter and visited her in secret until her own death. Several anguish-ridden poems from mother to daughter survive; two are reproduced below: ...|$|R
6000|$|And {{that was}} all that was then said about Luke even between Rachel and <b>her</b> <b>mother.</b> How <b>could</b> they speak about him? Mrs. Ray also {{believed}} that he would be no more seen in Baslehurst; and Rachel was well aware that such was <b>her</b> <b>mother's</b> belief, although it had never been expressed. What could be said between them now,--or ever afterwards,--unless, indeed, Rowan should take some steps to make it necessary that his doings should be discussed? ...|$|R
5000|$|One of {{the many}} {{children}} who rode the train was Lee Nailling. Lee's mother died of sickness; after her death Lee's father {{could not afford to}} keep his children.
