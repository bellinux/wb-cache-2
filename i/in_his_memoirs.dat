5|$|British {{documents}} {{show that the}} British government was shaken by satyagraha. Nonviolent protest left the British confused {{about whether or not}} to jail Gandhi. John Court Curry, a British police officer stationed in India, wrote <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>memoirs</b> that he felt nausea every time he dealt with Congress demonstrations in 1930. Curry and others in British government, including Wedgwood Benn, Secretary of State for India, preferred fighting violent rather than nonviolent opponents.|$|E
5|$|By {{the summer}} of 1346, Kantakouzenos stood {{on the verge of}} victory. He left Thrace under the control of his son Matthew and moved on to Selymbria, close to Constantinople. He did not attack the capital, but waited for almost a year for the city to surrender. <b>In</b> <b>his</b> <b>memoirs,</b> he {{explains}} {{that he did not want}} to turn his Turks on the city, although contemporaries such as Gregoras accused him of indecision and of needlessly prolonging the war.|$|E

5|$|Camp commandant Rudolf Höss was {{pursued by}} the British Intelligence Corps, who arrested him at a farm near Flensburg, Germany, on 11 March 1946.

He was convicted of murder, {{returned}} to Auschwitz and hanged at the site of his crimes on 16 April 1947.|$|E
5|$|Chief of Staff of the Russian 1st Army, Aleksey Yermolov, related <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>memoirs</b> {{that the}} Russian left was {{shifting}} position when the French Army arrived sooner than expected; thus the Battle of Shevardino became a delaying effort {{to shield the}} redeployment of the Russian left. The construction of the redoubt and its purpose is still disputed by historians to this day.|$|E
5|$|Diefenbaker was {{commissioned}} a lieutenant into the 196th (Western Universities) Battalion, CEF in May 1916. In September, Diefenbaker {{was part of}} a contingent of 300 junior officers sent to Britain for pre-deployment training. Diefenbaker related <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>memoirs</b> that he was hit by a shovel, and the injury eventually resulted in his being invalided home. Diefenbaker's recollections do not correspond with his army medical records, which show no contemporary account of such an injury, and his biographer, Denis Smith, speculates that any injury was psychosomatic.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{the crowded}} nature of Rome at the time, Octavius {{was taken to}} his father's home village at Velletri to be raised. Octavius only {{mentions}} his father's equestrian family briefly <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>memoirs.</b> His paternal great-grandfather Gaius Octavius was a military tribune in Sicily during the Second Punic War. His grandfather had served in several local political offices. His father, also named Gaius Octavius, had been governor of Macedonia. His mother, Atia, was the niece of Julius Caesar.|$|E
5|$|In 1844, Longstreet met {{his future}} first wife Maria Louisa Garland, called Louise by her family. She was the {{daughter}} of Longstreet's commander, Lt. Col. Garland. Little is known of their courtship or marriage. Longstreet never once mentioned Louise <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>memoirs,</b> and there are no surviving letters between the two. Most anecdotes about their relationship come through the writings of Longstreet's second wife, Helen Dortch Longstreet.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>his</b> <b>memoirs,</b> Diefenbaker did {{not mention}} the elder Atherton's initial {{approach}} but wrote that he was in Australia at a parliamentary conference {{at the time of the}} Canoe River crash. An Australian lawyer pointed out the case to Diefenbaker; he thought it interesting but noted that he was not a member of the Law Society of British Columbia. Diefenbaker wrote that he planned to meet Edna in Hawaii on his way back from Australia. Instead she wired him, requesting that he meet her in Vancouver.|$|E

5|$|Some contemporaries {{alleged that}} Bonaparte was put {{under house arrest}} at Nice for his {{association}} with the Robespierres following their fall in the Thermidorian Reaction in July 1794, but Napoleon's secretary Bourrienne disputed the allegation <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>memoirs.</b> According to Bourrienne, jealousy was responsible, between the Army of the Alps and the Army of Italy (with whom Napoleon was seconded at the time). Bonaparte dispatched an impassioned defense {{in a letter to}} the commissar Saliceti, and he was subsequently acquitted of any wrongdoing.|$|E
5|$|The biographer Montague Haltrecht {{suggests}} that Solti seized the breach of his Los Angeles contract as a convenient pretext {{to abandon the}} Philharmonic in favour of Covent Garden. However, <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>memoirs</b> Solti wrote that he wanted the Los Angeles position very much indeed. He originally considered holding both posts in tandem, but later acknowledged {{that he had had}} a lucky escape, as he could have done justice to neither post had he attempted to hold both simultaneously.|$|E
5|$|Grace {{comments}} <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>memoirs</b> that he {{was glad}} to make his hundredth century at Gloucestershire's ground. Excluding the two centuries not considered first-class by some modern statisticians, Grace's hundredth century came later in the same month when he scored 169 for Gloucestershire against Middlesex at Lord's. He scored his final first-class century in July 1904 for London County, reaching 166 against the Marylebone Cricket Club. He played first-class cricket for another four seasons, and scored 15 and 25 for the Gentlemen of England in his final outing, an innings defeat against Surrey.|$|E

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>his</b> <b>memoirs,</b> Ismay {{recalled}} {{that he never}} solved the puzzle of how to convey his very genuine concerns of the time to the right people. A thrown sticky bomb simply would not reliably stick to a vertical surface. However, the bomb would stick if it was thrown onto {{the top of a}} tank where the plates were more or less horizontal – and thinner – but this reduced the throwing range to twenty yards at the most – getting that close would only be possible in an ambush or in street fighting.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>his</b> <b>memoirs,</b> Władysław Szpilman also {{compared}} {{himself to}} Crusoe and, like Fogelman, emphasized the isolation and hopelessness which characterized the Warsaw Crusoes. Szpilman's memoir {{served as a}} basis for a screenplay, written as early as 1945 by the Polish writers Jerzy Andrzejewski and Czesław Miłosz, entitled Robinson of Warsaw. The movie that was eventually filmed, Miasto Nieujarzmione ("Unyoked city"), was heavily censored by the communist authorities, and its original theme changed {{to such an extent that}} Miłosz requested his name be removed from the film's credits. The experience with the film contributed to Miłosz's disillusionment with cinema as an artistic medium.|$|E
5|$|Kalinovka was {{a peasant}} village; Khrushchev's teacher, Lydia Shevchenko, later stated {{that she had}} never seen a village as poor as Kalinovka had been. Nikita worked as a herdsboy from an early age. He was schooled for a total of four years, part in the village parochial school and part under Shevchenko's tutelage in Kalinovka's state school. According to Khrushchev <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>memoirs,</b> Shevchenko was a {{freethinker}} who upset the villagers by not attending church, and when her brother visited, he gave the boy books which had been banned by the Imperial Government. She urged Nikita to seek further education, but family finances did not permit this.|$|E

5|$|Khrushchev {{assisted}} in the purge of many friends and colleagues in Moscow oblast. Of 38top Party officials in Moscow city and province, 35 were killed—the three survivors were transferred {{to other parts of}} the USSR. Of the 146Party secretaries of cities and districts outside Moscow city in the province, only 10 survived the purges. <b>In</b> <b>his</b> <b>memoirs,</b> Khrushchev noted that almost everyone who worked with him was arrested. By Party protocol, Khrushchev was required to approve these arrests, and did little or nothing to save his friends and colleagues.|$|E
5|$|The Second and Third of May 1808 {{are thought}} to have been {{intended}} as parts of a larger series. Written commentary and circumstantial evidence suggest that Goya painted four large canvases memorializing the rebellion of May 1808. <b>In</b> <b>his</b> <b>memoirs</b> of the Royal Academy in 1867, José Caveda wrote of four paintings by Goya of the second of May, and Cristóbal Ferriz—an artist and a collector of Goya—mentioned two other paintings on the theme: a revolt at the royal palace and a defense of artillery barracks. Contemporary prints stand as precedents for such a series. The disappearance of two paintings may indicate official displeasure with the depiction of popular insurrection.|$|E
5|$|After Louise's death, {{and after}} bearing {{criticism}} of his war record from other Confederates for decades, Longstreet refuted most of their arguments <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>memoirs</b> entitled From Manassas to Appomattox, a labor of five years that was published in 1896. His final years were marked by poor health and partial deafness. In 1902 he suffered from severe rheumatism {{and was unable to}} stand {{for more than a few}} minutes at a time. His weight diminished from 200 to 135 pounds by January 1903. Cancer developed in his right eye, and in December he had X-ray therapy in Chicago to treat it. He contracted pneumonia and died in Gainesville on January 2, 1904, six days before his 83rd birthday. Longstreet's remains are buried in Alta Vista Cemetery. He outlived most of his detractors, and was one of only a few general officers from the Civil War to live into the 20th century.|$|E
