50|$|The shelf {{surrounding}} {{an island}} {{is known as}} an <b>insular</b> <b>shelf.</b> The continental margin, between the continental shelf and the abyssal plain, comprises a steep continental slope followed by the flatter continental rise. Sediment from the continent above cascades down the slope and accumulates as a pile of sediment {{at the base of}} the slope, called the continental rise. Extending as far as 500 km (310 mi) from the slope, it consists of thick sediments deposited by turbidity currents from the shelf and slope. The continental rise's gradient is intermediate between the slope and the shelf, on the order of 0.5-1°.|$|E
50|$|Upeneus moluccensis prefers sandy or muddy {{substrates}} {{where it}} searches for its food, mainly benthic crustaceans using chemoreceptors on its barbels. As they grow larger fish form a {{greater part of}} their diet. In the Mediterranean they spawn from late July up to September, the spawn and larvae are planktonic, settling to a benthic habit at 4-5 cm in length and becoming sexually mature when they are about a year old, c. 10 cm in length. They form large schools which are normally quite fast swimmers, occasionally stopping to feed. It is normally found at depths of 10-80m on continental or <b>insular</b> <b>shelf</b> regions.

40|$|The north <b>insular</b> <b>shelf</b> of Molokai is {{a smooth}} plain, gently dipping seaward, with three slight steps, one {{occurring}} between the 30 - and 60 -foot isobaths, one between the 150 - and 180 -foot isobaths, and one near the 300 -foot isobath. The shelf break occurs near the 500 -foot isobath. Off East Molokai Volcano the shelf is cut by eleven submarine canyons; along West Molokai it is unbroken {{except for one}} canyon. About half the canyons have bowl-shaped heads; the remainder have V-shaped heads. The canyons originate about 1 mile offshore. Seismic reflection data show that the <b>insular</b> <b>shelf</b> is covered by a thin veneer of sediments, 0. 005 to 0. 025 seconds of reflection time, thickening seaward. The veneer is underlain by another series of reflectors, the deepest being 0. 05 seconds 1 mile from shore and 0. 25 seconds 3 miles from shore. The Molokai submarine canyons appear to have originated from subaerial erosion, which was followed by island subsidence with sediment deposition on the shelf and transport in the canyons. The geomorphology of the north slope of Molokai appears to have developed through erosion and deposition operating upon a subsiding volcanic island, rather than through the action of a giant submarine landslide...|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{asymmetric}} <b>insular</b> <b>shelf</b> in trapping long gravity waves around an island is investigated numerically {{by using a}} simple model. The model consists of a steep-sided, circular island which rises {{from the top of}} a circular sill of larger radius. The center of the island is placed off-center of the sill by Δr distance. The results are : (1) As the asymmetry becomes pronounced, the region of higher amplitude response shifts to the direction of the broader shelf. (2) The transfer function {{in the case of an}} asymmetric island can be estimated roughly by using the solution of a symmetric island model whose width of the round shelf coincides with the broadest width of the shelf in the asymmetric model. In water level observations at four stations around Oshima Island, a spectrum peak of period approximately 8 minutes could often be detected at the westernmost station. To understand this feature, numerical calculations were made both for the realistic Oshima-Island model (with actual bathymetry), and for the Island-Shelf model (which roughly approximated the topography of the Oshima Island area). And it was found that the oscillations of the observed peak period of 8 min. corresponded to a (1, 0) mode of edge wave. This mode is modified by the asymmetry of the <b>insular</b> <b>shelf</b> and forms a standing wave pattern with a node extending in the southwesterly direction vis-a-vis Oshima Island...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Three rivers {{discharge}} {{onto the}} narrow <b>insular</b> <b>shelf</b> of Mayaguez and Afiasco bays {{on the west}} coast of Puerto Rico. The bays are bounded offshore by a discontinuous line of reefs. The resulting pattern of carbonate and terrigenous sediments reflects both the source materials and the physical processes dis-tributing sediments. The carbonate sediments are found only near and on elevated reef structures. Terrigenous ediments are widely distributed and are encroaching over the coral reef areas. A change in sediment distribution is occurring that will eventually result in loss of the reef environment except on the shelf edge. This change is the result of increased sediment load in the rivers. LOCATION AND PHYSIOGRAPHY Mayaguez and Afiasco bays are {{near the center of the}} west coast of Puerto Rico (Fig. 1). The shoreline of the two bays meet at AI-garrobo Point, but offshore there is no physical separation of the bays (Fig. 2). The Afiasco, Yaguez, and Guanajibo rivers supply terrige-nous sediments derived from igneous rock en-vironments. Reefs on the shelf margin and patch reefs supply biogenic sediments. The <b>insular</b> <b>shelf</b> is 2 to 4 km wide at Afiasco Bay and 5 to 6 km wide at Mayaguez Bay. Water depth at the shelf break is 15 to 25 m. The Cabo Rojo Platform south of the study area is a broad shelf dominated by modern carbon-ate deposition. A submerged barrier-reef sys-tem (Macintyre, 1972) forms the shelf break in Afiasco and Mayaguez bays, except for gaps in the barrier located off the mouths of the riv-ers.
