5|$|After leaving Apogee, Jackson {{entered into}} {{a joint venture with}} Clair Brothers to design a digital {{loudspeaker}} controller for control of complex concert sound systems.

From the same garage in which he started Apogee, Jackson developed the proprietary Clair iO: a two-input, six-output digital audio matrix with opto-isolated output circuits. An essential element of the system was its ability to be controlled by wireless tablet computer by an audio engineer walking around to various seating sections in a concert venue, to tailor the system's response more precisely.|$|E

5|$|The {{depositions}} that Hutchinson {{collected and}} sent to London were eventually published in a pamphlet entitled A Fair Account of the Late Unhappy Disturbance in Boston. Drawn mainly from depositions by soldiers, its account of affairs sought to blame selfish Bostonians for denying the validity of Parliamentary laws.

However, as it was not published until well after the first pamphlet had arrived in London, <b>it</b> <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> having a much smaller {{impact on the public}} debate there.|$|E

The document was transferred to the National Archives and Records Administration in Washington in August 2010.|$|E

There were questions raised about naming the game the eleventh in the series, since it was not clear whether the game would have a structured story, which <b>it</b> <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> having, and the title of Final Fantasy Online was suggested.
