25|$|The Painted Chamber is {{furnished}} with reproduction oak furniture {{to show what}} it looked like when new (not dark with age and polish). The painted panelling has a larger design than that the Great Parlour and is less decorative. It was discovered under layers of <b>emulsion</b> <b>paint</b> and thought to date from the 17th century. The room is displayed as the mistress's chamber; a small table by the window obtains the maximum light for sewing. The floorboards have been relaid in a 17th-century manner. In 1609, a floor was laid at a cost of five shillings and tenpence for seven days' work, as recorded in the account book. The painted panelling creates a three-dimensional effect imitating the grainy effect of wood. The wild 'squiggles' were intended to imitate walnut, a wood becoming more fashionable in the late-17th century. It was expensive so painting was used to imitate it. The paint had a linseed oil base, and feathers and combs were dragged over it to create the grained effect.|$|E
40|$|<b>Emulsion</b> <b>paints</b> {{have been}} widely {{promoted}} {{on the basis of}} their ability to "breathe" or transmit water vapour. In Canada, their chief use has been on concrete structures. However, in localities where stucco is used, there may be a desire to apply <b>emulsion</b> <b>paints</b> for decorative purposes. Concern has been expressed that their use might lead to spalling of the rendering surface because of repeated freezing and thawing cycles. The work reported here shows that application of <b>emulsion</b> <b>paints</b> to old rendering is satisfactory.

She decided to open the club, which was located in her cellar, on 29 August 1959, for her sons, their friends and young people to meet and listen to the popular music of the day, unlike The Cavern Club, which had a jazz-only policy at that time. Mona charged half a crown annually for membership—to [...] "keep out the rough elements"—and served soft drinks, snacks, cakes, and coffee from an espresso machine, which no other club had at that time.

2500|$|Calcium {{carbonate}} {{is widely}} used as an extender in paints, in particular matte <b>emulsion</b> <b>paint</b> where typically 30% by weight of the paint is either chalk or marble. It is also a popular filler in plastics. Some typical examples include around 15 to 20% loading of chalk in unplasticized polyvinyl chloride (uPVC) drain pipe, 5 to 15% loading of stearate coated chalk or marble in uPVC window profile. PVC cables can use calcium carbonate at loadings of up to 70 phr (parts per hundred parts of resin) to improve mechanical properties (tensile strength and elongation) and electrical properties (volume resistivity). [...] Polypropylene compounds are often filled with calcium carbonate to increase rigidity, a requirement that becomes important at high use temperatures. Here the percentage is often 20–40%. It also routinely used as a filler in thermosetting resins (sheet and bulk molding compounds) and has also been mixed with ABS, and other ingredients, to form some types of compression molded [...] "clay" [...] poker chips. [...] Precipitated calcium carbonate, made by dropping calcium oxide into water, is used by itself or with additives as a white paint, known as whitewashing.|$|E
30|$|The {{historical}} development, {{properties and}} conservation-related {{concerns about the}} use of acrylic <b>emulsion</b> <b>paints</b> by artists have been published in detail elsewhere [1]-[4]. Briefly, the polymeric composition of artists’ acrylic <b>emulsion</b> <b>paints</b> has evolved since their introduction to the market. The early formulations were based on a poly ethyl acrylate/methyl methactylate (pEA/MMA) copolymer and some Talens acrylic paints remain based on this [5]. In the 1980 s, poly n-butyl methacrylate/methyl methacylate (pnBA/MMA) was widely substituted for pEA/MMA. In the late 2000 s, a further change the base emulsion formulation took place with the incorporation of terpolymers and copolymers of 2 -EHA by some artists’ paint manufacturers [6].|$|R

40|$|The {{solvents}} {{contained in}} <b>emulsion</b> <b>paints</b> which are labelled low-pollution paints mainly consist of glycol derivatives.

These products differ from conventional varnishes which contain mainly aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons with an average solvent content of 37 %. While the solvent concentrations of conventional varnishes decrease rapidly under standardized and practical conditions, low-pollution <b>emulsion</b> <b>paints</b> are characterized by a strongly retarded solvent release. The average eight-hour air concentrations found for the respective glycol derivatives during painting are below 5 mg/m" 3. The maximum 2 -butoxyethanol concentration of 17. 4 mg/m" 3 is 5. 7 times lower than the relevant lower toxic limit. (orig.)

40|$|VeoVa 9, {{the vinyl}} ester {{of a highly}} {{branched}} monocarboxylic acid containing 9 carbon atoms, is usually copolymerised with VeoVa 10, and/or vinyl acetate, to produce high-quality latices for <b>emulsion</b> <b>paints.</b> It has been found recently that VeoVa 9 is also an attractive comonomer for (meth) acrylics. For example, VeoVa 9 /methyl methacrylate/butyl acrylate copolymer latices having widely different monomer ratios and a good monomer conversion can be prepared readily. The use of the three monomers in combination allows the design of emulsion polymers for widely varying applications. Products having glass transition temperatures between - 40 and + 100 -degrees-C and a water resistance superior to that of their VeoVa- 9 -free analogues, the all-acrylics, can be made. Independent of each other, the polymer properties can be adapted easily to the specific end-use requirements by a correct choice of the ratio of monomers. In view of their attractive performance the VeoVa 9 /(meth) acrylate-copolymer latices are considered to show considerable promise, for instance, as binders in high-quality aqueous paints, such as glossy <b>emulsion</b> <b>paints,</b> metal paints, tile coatings, wood stains and top-quality flat wall paints...|$|R

Although acrylic <b>emulsion</b> <b>paints</b> have {{been the focus of}} museum-led research over the past decade, the impact of artists’ technique and conservation treatment on the upper-most surface of these paints remains essentially unexplored; This paper summarises previous studies using vibrational (FTIR) spectroscopy and presents initial assessments of paint surfaces using X-ray spectroscopies (XPS and NEXAFS) aimed at characterising artists’ acrylic paint film surfaces after natural ageing and wet surface cleaning treatment. Both techniques were found to be well suited for surface-sensitive investigations of the organic materials associated with artists’ acrylic paints, including explorations into: (A) cleaning system residues, (B) surfactant extraction from paint surfaces, (C) the identification of migrated surfactant, and (D) monitoring pigment changes at the paint/air interface of paint films; It has been shown is that these X-ray spectroscopic techniques can be used for the analysis of almost purely organic materials in a way that complements mass spectroscopic techniques, FTIR and XRF. This investigation forms part of broader, currently ongoing, multi-technique investigation into the properties of artists’ acrylic paints and development of conservation treatments for works-of-art made with these materials...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{outlines the}} results of an investigation into two recently launched artists’ acrylic <b>emulsion</b> <b>paints.</b> Golden OPEN Acrylics and Winsor and Newton (W&N) Artists’ Acrylic (replacement for the discontinued Finity range) paints contain formulation modifications aimed at increasing drying/working time (both paints) and decreasing wet to dry colour shift (W&N). The paints were characterised for their polymeric composition, pigment content, surface chemistry, water extractable components and surface gloss. Analytical results indicate that a 2 -ethylhexyl acrylate monomer (2 -EHA) has been either added or substituted into the acrylic polymer, and that the PEO-type surfactants often present in established formulations have either been reduced/not used. Simulated surface cleaning tests were also performed to explore pigment transfer and solubility issues. Pigment transfer was found to be both brand and pigment dependent, with the Golden OPEN colours proving less vulnerable than the range of W&N paints tested. Of the cleaning systems tested, the range of aqueous systems, soot sponge and the first generation Dow microemulsions resulted in some pigment transfer from these relatively young paint films. Findings will contribute to a growing body of knowledge on acrylic <b>emulsion</b> <b>paints</b> with a view to informing further research and the preservation of works of art...|$|R

50|$|Rheology {{generally}} {{accounts for}} the behavior of non-Newtonian fluids, by characterizing the minimum number of functions that are needed to relate stresses with rate of change of strain or strain rates. For example, ketchup can have its viscosity reduced by shaking (or other forms of mechanical agitation, where the relative movement of different layers in the material actually causes the reduction in viscosity) but water cannot. Ketchup is a shear thinning material, like yogurt and <b>emulsion</b> <b>paint</b> (US terminology latex paint or acrylic paint), exhibiting thixotropy, where an increase in relative flow velocity will cause a reduction in viscosity, for example, by stirring. Some other non-Newtonian materials show the opposite behavior, rheopecty: viscosity going up with relative deformation, and are called shear thickening or dilatant materials. Since Sir Isaac Newton originated the concept of viscosity, the study of liquids with strain rate dependent viscosity is also often called Non-Newtonian fluid mechanics.|$|E
