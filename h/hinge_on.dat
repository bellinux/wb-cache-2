5|$|Fields {{serve as}} {{foundational}} notions in several mathematical domains. This includes different branches of analysis, {{which are based}} on fields with additional structure. Basic theorems in analysis <b>hinge</b> <b>on</b> the structural properties of the field of real numbers. Most importantly for algebraic purposes, any field may be used as the scalars for a vector space, which is the standard general context for linear algebra. Number fields, the siblings of the field of rational numbers, are studied in depth in number theory. Function fields can help describe properties of geometric objects.|$|E
5|$|Ian Drake, an {{assistant}} professor of Political Science and another critic of the compact, has argued that the constitution both requires and prohibits Congressional approval of the compact. In Drake's view, only a constitutional amendment could make the compact valid. Authors Michael Brody, Jennifer Hendricks, and Bradley Turflinger have examined the compact and concluded that the NPVIC, if successfully enacted, would pass constitutional muster. Brody has put forth a unique theory that the legality of the NPVIC could potentially <b>hinge</b> <b>on</b> the notion that faithless electors are not necessarily obligated to vote for the candidate to whom they are pledged.|$|E
5|$|When Maxwell {{concluded}} his argument, ex-Governor Bradley {{spoke on}} Taylor's behalf. After reiterating Taylor's legal {{claim to the}} office of governor, he answered the question of jurisdiction by citing Thayer v. Boyd, a similar case in which the court had assumed jurisdiction. He further quoted authorities who opined that an elected office was property, using this to contend that Taylor's rights under the Fourteenth Amendment had been violated, thus giving the court jurisdiction. Also, Bradley asserted, the election of some members of the Assembly's contest committee would <b>hinge</b> <b>on</b> the decision of that very committee. At least one member of the committee was known to have wagered on the election's outcome. These facts should have nullified the decision of the committee and the Assembly {{on the grounds that it}} had left some members as judges of their own cases. Finally, Bradley cited irregularities in the proceedings of the contest committee, including insufficient time given for the review of testimony provided in written form by Taylor and Marshall's legal representation. Following Bradley's argument, the court recessed until May 14, 1900.|$|E

5|$|The {{cases of}} Taylor and Marshall were {{appealed to the}} Kentucky Court of Appeals, then to the Supreme Court of the United States. In the case of Taylor v. Beckham, Bradley countered Democrats' claims that the federal courts should not have {{jurisdiction}} by citing Thayer v. Boyd, a similar {{case in which the}} court had assumed jurisdiction. He further quoted authorities who opined that an elected office was property, using this to contend that Taylor's rights under the Fourteenth Amendment had been violated, thus giving the court jurisdiction. Also, Bradley asserted, the election of some members of the General Assembly's contest committee would <b>hinge</b> <b>on</b> the decision of that very committee. At least one member of the committee was known to have wagered on the election's outcome. These facts should have nullified the decision of the committee and the Assembly {{on the grounds that it}} had left some members as judges of their own cases, Bradley argued. Finally, Bradley cited irregularities in the proceedings of the contest committee, including giving insufficient time for the review of testimony provided in written form by Taylor and Marshall's legal representation. The court refused to intervene in the case, however, because it found that there were no federal questions involved. The lone justice dissenting from that opinion was Kentuckian John Marshall Harlan.|$|E

25|$|For example, a {{field is}} zero-dimensional, since the only prime ideal is the zero ideal. The {{integers}} are one-dimensional, since chains {{are of the}} form (0) ⊊ (p), where p is a prime number. For non-Noetherian rings, and also non-local rings, the dimension may be infinite, but Noetherian local rings have finite dimension. Among the four axioms above, the first two are elementary consequences of the definition, whereas the remaining two <b>hinge</b> <b>on</b> important facts in commutative algebra, the going-up theorem and Krull's principal ideal theorem.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{this and}} several similar peer {{reviewed}} papers, {{there is not}} a consensus as to whether such devices can produce a continuous output of work. Garret Moddel at University of Colorado has highlighted that he believes such devices <b>hinge</b> <b>on</b> the assumption that the Casimir force is a nonconservative force, he argues that there is sufficient evidence (e.g. analysis by Scandurra (2001)) to say that the Casimir effect is a conservative force and therefore even though such an engine can exploit the Casimir force for useful work it cannot produce more output energy than has been input into the system.|$|E
25|$|Although the GCFC bid team met all the {{criteria}} during their {{presentation to the}} AFL Commission, several stadium issues continued to delay the process. Initially, the Government of Queensland intended to uphold a contract clause that stated a second AFL team in Queensland must play all home games at the Gabba until 2016. The clause was later loosened and the AFL sought out joint funding for the redevelopment of Carrara Stadium. The AFL was able to conjure up the funds needed for the redevelopment but it would all <b>hinge</b> <b>on</b> whether the Queensland Labor Party would be re-elected in the 2009 state election.|$|E

Upon the stool, the Chief is sacred, the holy intermediary between people and ancestors. His powers theoretically are more apparent than real. His powers <b>hinge</b> <b>on</b> his attention to the advice and decisions of the Council of Elders. The chief can be impeached, de-stooled, if the Elders and the people turn against him. He can be reduced to man, subject to derision for his failure.|$|E
25|$|The {{effect of}} {{intoxication}} on criminal responsibility varies by jurisdiction and offense. The criminal code in question may require proof of {{various levels of}} intent. This may range from premeditation, through various degrees of intent or willingness to commit a crime, general recklessness, and finally no intent at all in some instances of strict liability. Intoxication {{may serve as a}} defense against proving more specific forms of intent. If so, its potential effectiveness will sometimes <b>hinge</b> <b>on</b> whether the defendant's intoxication was voluntary or involuntary: the defense would be denied defendants who had voluntarily disabled themselves by knowingly consuming an intoxicating substances, but allowed to those who had consumed it unknowingly or against their will.|$|E
25|$|From 1949 to 1953, Clement's {{first three}} novels were two-, three-, and four-part Astounding serials under Campbell: Needle (Doubleday, 1950), Iceworld (Gnome Press, 1953), and Mission of Gravity (1954), his best-known novel, {{published}} by Doubleday's Science Fiction Book Club (established 1953). The latter novel features a {{land and sea}} expedition across the superjovian planet Mesklin to recover a stranded scientific probe. The natives of Mesklin are centipede-like intelligent beings about 50 centimeters long. Various episodes <b>hinge</b> <b>on</b> the fact that Mesklin's fast rotational speed causes it to be considerably deformed from the spherical, with effective surface gravity that varies from approximately 3 gn at the equator to approximately 700 gn at the poles.|$|E

25|$|The {{trochanter}} is the basal {{segment of}} the telopodite; {{it is always a}} small segment in the insect leg, freely movable by a horizontal <b>hinge</b> <b>on</b> the coxa, but more or less fixed {{to the base of the}} femur. When movable on the femur the trochantero femoral hinge is usually vertical or oblique in a vertical plane, giving a slight movement of production and reduction at the joint, though only a reductor muscle is present. In the Odonata, both nymphs and adults, there are two trochanteral segments, but they are not movable on each other; the second contains the reductor muscle of the femur. The usual single trochanteral segment of insects, therefore, probably represents the two trochanters of other arthropods fused into one apparent segment, since it is not likely that the primary coxotrochanteral hinge has been lost from the leg. In some of the Hymenoptera a basal subdivision of the femur simulates a second trochanter, but the insertion of the reductor muscle on its base attests that it belongs to the femoral segment, since as shown in the odonate leg, the reductor has its origin in the true second trochanter.|$|E

500|$|There is {{no clear}} {{distinction}} between a language and a dialect, notwithstanding a famous aphorism attributed to linguist Max Weinreich that [...] "a language is a dialect with an army and navy". For example, national boundaries frequently override linguistic difference in determining whether two linguistic varieties are languages or dialects. Hakka, Cantonese and Mandarin are, for example, often classified as [...] "dialects" [...] of Chinese, {{even though they are}} more different from each other than Swedish is from Norwegian. Before the Yugoslav civil war, Serbo-Croatian was considered a single language with two dialects, but now Croatian and Serbian are considered different languages and employ different writing systems. In other words, the distinction may <b>hinge</b> <b>on</b> political considerations as much as on cultural differences, distinctive writing systems, or degree of mutual intelligibility.|$|E
500|$|Several {{criticisms of}} the Book of Abraham have been brought forth that <b>hinge</b> <b>on</b> {{evidence}} found in the [...] "Egyptian Alphabet and Grammar". One such argument focuses on the aforementioned document and its connection to Joseph Smith Papyrus XI, {{also known as the}} [...] "Small Sensen" [...] papyrus (i.e. the small scrap of papyrus attached to left side of JSP I). The [...] "Egyptian Alphabet and Grammar" [...] contains an arrangement of correlated characters from the Small Sensen papyrus: on the left-hand side of a given page, a series of Egyptian character appear, and on the right, an apparent translation of these characters is given. This suggests that whoever created the correlation was attempting to perform a direct, literal, and comprehensive translation (as opposed to a merely spiritual or divined translation, as some apologists contend).|$|E
