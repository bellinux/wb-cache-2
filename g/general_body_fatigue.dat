40|$|Tibial impact {{acceleration}} measured during {{running is}} known to increase with <b>general</b> <b>body</b> <b>fatigue.</b> The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine if localized muscle fatigue of the shank muscles would also cause an increase in peak tibial acceleration. The human pendulum system was used to control impact velocity and joint angle. There were 24 women participating in the study: 12 between the ages of 20 [...] 25, and 12 between 50 [...] 60 years. Each lay supine on the pendulum, and their unshod dominant heel was impacted into a vertical force plate with a velocity between 1 [...] 1. 15 m/s, and a force approximating 1. 8 [...] 2. 8 x body weight. A uni-axial accelerometer at the tibial tubercle measured peak tibial acceleration, time to peak acceleration and the slope of the acceleration/time curve. EMG activity of the tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius was used to define and monitor fatigue. The dorsiflexors and plantarflexors were fatigued on two separate days, at least a week apart. Statistical analysis revealed a significant decrease in peak acceleration and acceleration slope following fatigue. There were no significant main effects or interactions for age group or muscle group. In conclusion, localized muscle fatigue of the dorsiflexors or plantarflexors resulted in a significant decrease in the peak acceleration and acceleration slope measured at the knee, which is opposite to the effect of <b>general</b> <b>body</b> <b>fatigue.</b> Paper copy at Leddy Library: Theses 2 ̆ 6 Major Papers - Basement, West Bldg. / Call Number: Thesis 2003.

40|$|Amongst toxic heavy metals, lead {{ranks as}} one of the most serious {{environmental}} poisons all over the world. Exposure to lead in the home and the workplace results in health hazards to many adults and children causing economic damage, which is due to the lack of awareness of the ill effects of lead. We report the case of a 22 year old man working in an unorganized lead acid battery manufacturing unit, complaining about a longer history of <b>general</b> <b>body</b> ache, lethargy, <b>fatigue,</b> shoulder joint pain, shaking of hands and wrist drop. Patient had blue line at gingivodental junction. Central nervous system (CNS) examination showed having grade 0 power of extensors of right wrist & fingers. Reflexes: Supinator- absent, Triceps- weak and other deep tendon reflexes- normal. Investigations carried out during the admission showed hemoglobin levels of 8. 3 g/dl and blood lead level of 128. 3 μg/dl. The patient was subjected to chelation therapy, which was accompanied by aggressive environmental intervention and was advised not to return to the same environmental exposure situation. After repeated course of chelation therapy he has shown the signs of improvement and is on follow up presently...|$|R
40|$|Despite the {{acknowledged}} {{importance of}} fatigue on performance in sport, ecologically sound studies investigating fatigue {{and its effects}} on sport-specific skills are surprisingly rare. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the effect of moderate and high intensity total <b>body</b> <b>fatigue</b> on passing accuracy in expert and novice basketball players. Ten novice basketball players (age: 23. 30 ± 1. 05 yrs) and ten expert basketball players (age: 22. 50 ± 0. 41 yrs) volunteered to participate in the study. Both groups performed the modified AAHPERD Basketball Passing Test under three different testing conditions: rest, moderate intensity and high intensity total <b>body</b> <b>fatigue.</b> Fatigue intensity was established using a percentage of the maximal number of squat thrusts performed by the participant in one minute. ANOVA with repeated measures revealed a significant (F 2, 36 = 5. 252, p = 0. 01) level of fatigue by level of skill interaction. On examination of the mean scores it is clear that following high intensity total <b>body</b> <b>fatigue</b> there is a significant detriment in the passing performance of both novice and expert basketball players when compared to their resting scores. Fundamentally however, the detrimental impact of fatigue on passing performance is not as steep in the expert players compared to the novice players. The results suggest that expert or skilled players are better able to cope with both moderate and high intensity fatigue condition...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. As the {{aluminum}} alloy car body {{was used to}} the lightweight design of railway vehicle, the fatigue reliability has become a key issue. In order to analyze the fatigue strength of aluminum alloy car <b>body,</b> the Goodman <b>fatigue</b> limit diagram was drawn according to the mechanical characteristics of aluminum alloy. The car body finite element model was established. The static strength and fatigue strength analysis load cases of car body were determined based on the EN 12663 standard. After calculating and preparing post-processing analysis program, the car <b>body</b> <b>fatigue</b> strength was evaluated. The results show that under the static strength load cases, the maximum equivalent stress of car body which appears {{in the corner of}} the door is 225. 481 MPa and the maximum vertical deformation of car body is 6. 87 mm, both of them meet the static strength and stiffness requirements; Under the fatigue load cases, the minimum safety factor of car <b>body</b> <b>fatigue</b> strength is 2. 41,which meets the fatigue strength requirement. The fatigue strength analysis method of aluminum alloy car body provides the reference data for lightweight design of car body...|$|R

40|$|The fatigue {{defined as}} lack {{ability of a}} person to produce {{required}} power or the inability to maintain and duration the generated power for doing targeted activity. The effect of fatigue in creating sport injuries and consequently treatment costs, staying away from sport as well as reducing the quality of athletic performance is evidence for everyone. Research {{that has been done}} in the field of fatigue have had an overall overview of this issue. The objective of this research was doing a comparison the effect of body and lower limbs fatigue on the performance and risk factors of lower limbs in the women novice athletes. In this study, 45 novice female athletes were selected as available. A pre-test including functional tests and the test of landing error without applying <b>body</b> <b>fatigue</b> protocol And lower limbs were done from the subjects and after a day resting in the second day after applying ABT fatigue protocol in the <b>body</b> <b>fatigue</b> group and Bosko fatigue protocol in the lower limbs group the functional tests and landing error was done. Kolmogorov-Smirnov, ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis tests in the 0. 05 significance used for data statistical analysis. Results indicated that the <b>fatigue</b> of <b>body</b> and lower limbs leads to increase significance and risky factors of lower limbs injuries and reducing significance of dynamic balance in all directions. Also there was not observed a meaningful difference between average changes in risk factors for lower extremity injuries, dynamic balance (in all directions) on invoice women of <b>body</b> <b>fatigue</b> group and lower limbs. The body and lower limbs fatigue leads to reduce dynamic balance and increasing risk factors of lower limbs...|$|R
