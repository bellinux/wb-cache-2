5|$|The Civil Aeronautics Board {{concluded}} that the severity of Frank's injuries and the numerous particulates found embedded in his body could only be attributed to his proximity to an explosion. Furthermore, the chemical compounds detected {{in the area around}} the explosion's point of origin were consistent with those generated by a dynamite explosion. The manganese dioxide samples collected from the seats near the focal point and from Frank's body indicated that a <b>dry</b> <b>cell</b> <b>battery</b> was located very near to the explosive. The CAB determined that, based on the blast pattern, a dynamite charge had been placed underneath the window seat of row 7.|$|E

40|$|Many {{families}} own {{portable radios}} but use them very sparingly {{due to the}} high cost of <b>dry</b> <b>cell</b> <b>batteries</b> (which can cost the equivalent of three days' food). By converting existing radios to work from the sun, not only are running costs greatly decreased, but it also reduces the pollution caused when batteries are discarded. For a small radio, the cost of conversion can be as little as $ 1. A small company in the UK has come up with the simple solution of DIY solar conversion kits. These kits contain sheets of solar 'glass', leads, lead connectors, plastic moulding (to fix leads to glass) and glue. The smallest kit can be divided up to convert 30 small radios to solar power and costs just £ 15 plus postage. Each kit is supplied with detailed instructions and an example showing how things fit together; such assembly-work would make an ideal small-scale local enterprise. The leads are fitted to each end of a piece of 'glass' and connected into the radio's battery compartment, in place of the usual <b>dry</b> <b>cells.</b> For night-time use, either <b>dry</b> <b>cell</b> <b>batteries</b> or rechargeable NiCads can be used.
