He has not been practising steering as you have, but as there seem to be no rocks about, that won't matter so much. I ought to be able to keep her straight, if you three paddle hard.

"You know, moreover, of what {{consequence}} it is, {{that the}} missioners, who {{are sent to}} the Indies, should be proper for the end proposed; and it is convenient, on that account, that you come to Portugal and Rome: for not only many more will be desirous of going on those missions, but you will make a better choice of missioners, and will see more clearly to what parts such and such are proper to be sent. You judge yourself of what consideration it is, not to be mistaken in these affairs; and whatsoever relation you can send us, your letters are not sufficient {{to give us a}} true notion of what labourers are fitting for the Indies. It is necessary that you, or some one as intelligent as you, should know and practise those who are designed for those countries.

6000|$|Reginald {{was glad}} to get away, and I went to Lady Susan, curious, indeed, to hear her account of it. [...] "Did I not tell you," [...] said she with a smile, [...] "that your brother would not leave us after all?" [...] "You did, indeed," [...] replied I very gravely; [...] "but I flattered myself you would be mistaken." [...] "I should not have hazarded such an opinion," [...] {{returned}} she, [...] "if it had not at that moment {{occurred to me that}} his resolution of going might be occasioned by a conversation in which we had been this morning engaged, and which had ended very much to his dissatisfaction, from our not rightly understanding each other's meaning. This idea struck me at the moment, and I instantly determined that an accidental dispute, in which I might probably be as much to blame as himself, should not deprive you of your brother. If you remember, I left the room almost immediately. I was resolved to lose no time in clearing up those mistakes as far as I could. The case was this--Frederica had set herself violently against marrying Sir James." [...] "And can your ladyship wonder that she should?" [...] cried I with some warmth; [...] "Frederica has an excellent understanding, and Sir James has none." [...] "I am at least very far from regretting it, my dear sister," [...] said she; [...] "on the contrary, I am grateful for so favourable a sign of my daughter's sense. Sir James is certainly below par (his boyish manners make him appear worse); and had Frederica possessed the penetration and the abilities which I could have wished in my daughter, or had I even known her to possess as much as she does, I should not have been anxious for the match." [...] "It is odd that you should alone be ignorant of your daughter's sense!" [...] "Frederica never does justice to herself; her manners are shy and childish, and besides she is afraid of me. During her poor father's life she was a spoilt child; the severity which it has since been necessary for me to show has alienated her affection; neither has she any of that brilliancy of intellect, that genius or vigour of mind which will force itself forward." [...] "Say rather that she has been unfortunate in her education!" [...] "Heaven knows, my dearest Mrs. Vernon, how fully I am aware of that; but I would wish to forget every circumstance that might throw blame on the memory of one whose name is sacred with me." [...] Here she pretended to cry; I was out of patience with her. [...] "But what," [...] said I, [...] "was your ladyship going to tell me about your disagreement with my brother?" [...] "It originated in an action of my daughter's, which equally marks her want of judgment and the unfortunate dread of me I have been mentioning--she wrote to Mr. De Courcy." [...] "I know she did; you had forbidden her speaking to Mr. Vernon or to me on the cause of her distress; what could she do, therefore, but apply to my brother?" [...] "Good God!" [...] she exclaimed, [...] "what an opinion you must have of me! Can you possibly suppose that I was aware of her unhappiness! that it was my object to make my own child miserable, and that I had forbidden her speaking to you on the subject from a fear of your interrupting the diabolical scheme? Do you think me destitute of every honest, every natural feeling? Am I capable of consigning HER to everlasting: misery whose welfare it is my first earthly duty to promote? The idea is horrible!" [...] "What, then, was your intention when you insisted on her silence?" [...] "Of what use, my dear sister, could be any application to you, however the affair might stand? Why should I subject you to entreaties which I refused to attend to myself? Neither for your sake nor for hers, nor for my own, could such a thing be desirable. When my own resolution was taken I could nor wish for the interference, however friendly, of another person. I was mistaken, it is true, but I believed myself right." [...] "But what was this mistake to which your ladyship so often alludes! from whence arose so astonishing a misconception of your daughter's feelings! Did you not know that she disliked Sir James?" [...] "I knew that he was not absolutely the man she would have chosen, but I was persuaded that her objections to him did not arise from any perception of his deficiency. You must not question me, however, my dear sister, too minutely on this point," [...] continued she, taking me affectionately by the hand; [...] "I honestly own that there is something to conceal. Frederica makes me very unhappy! Her applying to Mr. De Courcy hurt me particularly." [...] "What is it you mean to infer," [...] said I, [...] "by this appearance of mystery? <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>your</b> daughter at all attached to Reginald, her objecting to Sir James could not less deserve to be attended to than if the cause of her objecting had been a consciousness of his folly; and why should your ladyship, at any rate, quarrel with my brother for an interference which, you must know, it is not in his nature to refuse when urged in such a manner?" ...|$|E
