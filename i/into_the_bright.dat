5|$|The {{music video}} begins with Clarkson {{standing}} in a room wearing a white wedding dress. Holding a bouquet of red rose, she is surrounded by her bridesmaids as they prepare for her wedding. She sits down on a sofa and sees a wedding photo of her fiancé with another woman as a storm begins to form outside. The bridesmaids try to close the windows but fail so they {{run out of the}} room leaving Clarkson alone, who is seen dropping the bouquet of rose as well as the wedding photo from her hands onto the floor. The next scene shows Clarkson walking down the aisle in a church wearing a black dress. She sees a bride standing at the altar with her fiancé, getting married. When she draws the veil of the bride, she realizes that the bride is the woman from the photo. Clarkson, who is now wearing a white wedding dress, runs out of the church and into a dark swamp. A montage of Clarkson singing with her band in a dark swamp is shown alternately with scenes of Clarkson running in the forest and laying on the ground. Clarkson is also seen standing inside an abandoned house, wearing a voluminous black dress. As the rain starts to fall, Clarkson finally collapsed, kneeling on the ground while looking at and being comforted by her other self who is singing with the band. The scene shifts to a present day, where Clarkson is standing at the altar, exchanging vows with her fiancé. Before he puts the ring on her finger, she looks at the guests and notices that the woman from the photo is among the audience. She sees her fiancé exchanging a smile with the woman as the woman blows him a kiss. Clarkson then reaches for the ring and throws it at her fiancé, before running away from the altar. She throws her wedding bouquet into the lap of the woman and shoves her way past the wedding guests who are trying to stop her from leaving. The video ends with Clarkson stepping out the doors <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bright</b> sunlight.|$|E
500|$|Hubert Humphrey {{was first}} elected to public office in 1945 as Mayor of Minneapolis. He served two, two-year terms, and gained a {{reputation}} as an anti-Communist and ardent supporter of the Civil Rights Movement. He gave a rousing speech at the 1948 Democratic National Convention arguing for {{the adoption of a}} pro-Civil Rights plank, exclaiming [...] "The time has arrived in America for the Democratic Party {{to get out of the}} shadow of states' rights and to walk forthrightly <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bright</b> sunshine of human rights." [...] That same year, he was elected to the United States Senate, where he worked closely with Senate Majority Leader Lyndon Johnson. Humphrey's persona and tactics in the Senate led to his nickname of [...] "The Happy Warrior". Contemporaries noted that he succeeded in politics because of a likable personality and ability to connect with voters on a personal level.|$|E
500|$|Humphrey's {{progress}} with {{civil rights in}} Minneapolis gained national attention, with many cities inquiring about how they could establish their own civil rights commissions. In 1947, he was reelected with 102,000 votes over his opponent's 52,000 votes. As a delegate to the 1948 Democratic National Convention, he led the call for a strong civil rights plank. In his address, he said, [...] "There {{are those who say}} to you– we are rushing this issue of civil rights. I say we are 172 years late. There are those who say– this issue of civil rights is an infringement on states rights. The time has arrived for the Democratic Party {{to get out of the}} shadow of state's rights and walk forthrightly <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bright</b> sunshine of human rights." [...] Humphrey was elected to the United States Senate in the 1948 election and served many years as a prominent Minnesota politician, including Vice President of the U.S. from 1965–1969.|$|E

In the copy of Gone with the Wind that Johnny gave him before dying, Ponyboy finds a note from Johnny {{describing}} how he will die proudly after saving the kids from the fire. Johnny also urges Ponyboy to [...] "stay gold". Ponyboy decides to write his English assignment about the recent events, and begins his essay with the opening line of the novel: [...] "When I stepped out <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bright</b> sunlight from {{the darkness of the}} movie house, I had only two things on my mind: Paul Newman and a ride home..." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{overlying}} Tonto Group {{is separated}} from the Dox Sandstone {{and the rest of}} folded and faulted Unkar Group by a prominent angular unconformity, {{which is part of the}} Great Unconformity. Typically, the surface of this unconformity is a remarkably flat, ancient erosional surface, often argued to be a peneplain, that cuts across units such as the Bass Formation, Hatakai Shale, and Dox Sandstone. Resistant beds within the Unkar Group, such as Cardenas Basalt and Shinumo Quartzite, form ancient hills, called monadnocks, that rise as much as [...] high above this ancient plain. Thin drapes of Tapeats Sandstone of the Tonto Group now cover most of these ancient monadnocks. However, a few of these monadnocks protrude up <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bright</b> Angel Shale. These monadnocks served locally as sources of coarse-grained sediments that accumulated during the marine transgression to form the Tonto Group.|$|E

The large crowd {{gathered}} at the railyard, including a number of railroad employees, burst into applause and shouted their approval as the locomotive's nose emerged from the shop building and <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bright</b> sunshine. The American flag and the Arkansas state flag affixed to the right and left sides of the shiny black engine gave a patriotic air to the event. Members of the Cotton Belt Railroad Historical Society invested over 35,000 man-hours into this restoration project. Jake Commer praised the efforts the Cotton Belt Route had extended stating, [...] "They helped us so much I can't even begin to tell you about all of it. If it hadn't been for the railroad, we couldn't have done it." ...|$|E

50|$|In Bengali literature, {{it started}} with Kallol, a modernist {{movement}} magazine, established in 1923. The most popular among the group were Kazi Nazrul Islam (1899-1976), Mohitlal Majumder (1888-1952), Achintyakumar Sengupta (1903-1976), Satyendranath Dutta (1882-1922), and Premendra Mitra (1904-1988). Then Bengali poetry got <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>brightest</b> light of modernism in the 1930s, through the movement of a few other little magazines, such as Buddhadeb Bosu's Kabita and Sudhindranath Datta's Parichay.|$|R

2500|$|Nonmedical use of {{ketamine}} {{began on}} the West Coast of the United States in the early 1970s. Early use was documented in underground literature such as The Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers. It was used in psychiatric and other academic research through the 1970s, culminating in 1978 with the publishing of psychonaut John Lilly's The Scientist, and Marcia Moore and Howard Alltounian's Journeys <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bright</b> World, which documented the unusual phenomenology of ketamine intoxication. The incidence of nonmedical ketamine use increased {{through the end of}} the century, especially in the context of raves and other parties. However, its emergence as a club drug differs from other club drugs (e.g. MDMA) due to its anesthetic properties (e.g., slurred speech, immobilization) at higher doses; in addition, there are reports of ketamine being sold as [...] "ecstasy". The use of ketamine as part of a [...] "postclubbing experience" [...] has also been documented. Ketamine's rise in the dance culture was rapid in Hong Kong by the end of the 1990s. Before becoming a federally controlled substance in the United States in 1999, ketamine was available as diverted pharmaceutical preparations and as a pure powder sold in bulk quantities from domestic chemical supply companies. Much of the current ketamine diverted for nonmedical use originates in China and India.|$|E

40|$|Cyan {{variants}} of {{green fluorescent protein}} are widely used as donors in Forster resonance energy transfer experiments. The popular, but modestly bright, Enhanced Cyan Fluorescent Protein (ECFP) was sequentially improved <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>brighter</b> variants Super Cyan Fluorescent Protein 3 A (SCFP 3 A) and mTurquoise, the latter exhibiting a high-fluorescence quantum yield and a long mono-exponential fluorescence lifetime. Here we combine X-ray crystallography and excited-state calculations to rationalize these stepwise improvements. The enhancement originates from stabilization of the seventh beta-strand and the strengthening of the sole chromophore-stabilizing hydrogen bond. The structural analysis highlighted one suboptimal internal residue, which was subjected to saturation mutagenesis combined with fluorescence lifetime-based screening. This resulted in mTurquoise 2, a brighter variant with faster maturation, high photostability, longer mono-exponential lifetime and the highest quantum yield measured for a monomeric fluorescent protein. Together, these properties make mTurquoise 2 the preferable cyan variant of green fluorescent protein for long-term imaging and as donor for Forster resonance energy transfer to a yellow fluorescent protein...|$|R
