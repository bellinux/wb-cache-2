Objective: This investigation studied, for the first time, the antiproliferative effect of Pistacia lentiscus <b>fixed</b> <b>oil</b> and its phenolic extract on BHK 21 cancer cells. Materials and methods: Oil was extracted from fruits harvested in northwest Tunisia and the phenolic fraction was obtained by mixing with methanol. The anti-proliferative activity of the two tested substances on BHK 21 cells were investigated in vitro using trypan blue assays. Cells were treated with different concentrations of P. lentiscus oil (0. 009, 0. 018, 0. 036, and 0. 09 g/mL) and the phenolic extract (0. 007, 0. 014, 0. 03, and 0. 07 g/mL) for 24, 48, and 72 h.
