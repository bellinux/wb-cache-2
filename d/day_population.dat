While Tamm was not directly affected by the Napoleonic Wars, it still suffered from the economic strain put on the entire region. Shortly after the war, in 1816, a famine hit, marking a temporary decline in Tamm's development.

50|$|The {{opening of}} the Monticello and Port Jervis Railroad in the 1870s stimulated the lumbering, tanning and {{quarrying}} industries. The railroad entered Forestburgh at the Town's northern border and extended through it in a southernly direction along the Bushkill Creek Valley. In addition to assisting the Town's industrial base, the railroad also brought summer residents from New York City. The population of the Town in 1870 was 916, greater than the present <b>day</b> <b>population</b> of 833.|$|E
50|$|Besides {{looking to}} the 1822 arrangement, Javier de Burgos took as his model the {{departments}} of France. While many of the borders and inclusions in the provinces may at first appear arbitrary from a historical and geographical point of view, he was operating under a set of rational criteria: area (it {{was intended to be}} possible to travel between the capital and any point in the province in a single <b>day),</b> <b>population</b> (wherever feasible, the provinces had populations between 100,000 and 400,000), and geographic coherence.|$|E

Gorillas normally travel [...] per <b>day.</b> <b>Populations</b> feeding on high-energy foods that vary spatially and seasonally tend to have greater day ranges than those feeding on lower-quality but more consistently available foods.

50|$|Based on archaeologial and {{linguistic}} evidence, scholars believe that {{beginning in the}} last centuries BCE, people speaking languages of the Western Bantu family entered the country and introduced agriculture and iron working. Studies of DNA from Cabinda have found no traces of any population groups other than the Bantu in the modern <b>day</b> <b>population.</b> They expected to find evidence of combined ancestry. This {{makes it difficult to}} explain the existence of an earlier population, save that they were completely and rapidly replaced by the Bantu speakers without intermarriage (although intermarriage may have occurred in the central parts of Angola). Also, part of the Khoisan withdrew to what is now Southern Angola as well as Northern Botswana and Northern Namibia, where significant groups are still living.|$|E
5000|$|Demographically, it was {{the most}} diverse city in Poland, with {{significant}} numbers of foreign-born inhabitants. In addition to the Polish majority, there was a significant Jewish minority in Warsaw. According to the Russian census of 1897, out of the total population of 638,000, Jews constituted 219,000 (around 34% percent). Warsaw's prewar Jewish population of more than 350,000 constituted about 30 percent of the city's total population. In 1933, out of 1,178,914 inhabitants 833,500 were of Polish mother tongue. World War II changed the demographics of the city, and to this day there is much less ethnic diversity than in the previous 300 years of Warsaw's history.

50|$|The Denver Pacific's rival, the Colorado Central {{line from}} Golden, was not {{completed}} until 1877. By this time, Denver had established its supremacy over its rival {{as the population}} center and capital city of the newly admitted State of Colorado. The railroad brought residents, tourists, and much-needed supplies. In the 1870s, {{it is estimated that}} the railroad brought 100 new residents to Denver each <b>day.</b> <b>Population</b> statistics bear this out, for Denver's population soared from 4,759 in 1870 to over 35,000 by 1880. In addition to bringing new residents, it put Denver on the map as a tourist destination and brought 1,067 visitors in its first month of operation. That first month also brought 13,000,000 lb of freight. Denver now had the people and supplies it needed to flourish and solidify its dominance in the region.|$|E
50|$|Within {{this area}} two rates would be levied: an Equalisation Rate (General) of 1 {{shilling}} and 6 pence in the pound and an Equalisation Rate (Poor) of 1 shilling in the pound. These two rates, it was estimated, would raise about 8 million pounds. The {{product of the}} general rate would be distributed among the various local authorities of the equalisation area {{in proportion to the}}ir <b>day</b> <b>population,</b> thereby making those who lived in outer London but worked in the centre, contribute to services in the central boroughs. The product of the poor rate was to be distributed in proportion to the night population of each poor law union: one third being distributed generally and two thirds to unions containing overcrowded areas. These were defined as areas where the population density was more than two persons per room.|$|E
50|$|Historically, Białystok {{has been}} a {{destination}} for internal and foreign immigration, especially from Central and Eastern Europe. In addition to the Polish minority, {{there was a significant}} Jewish majority in Białystok. According to Russian census of 1897, out of the total population of 66,000, Jews constituted 41,900 (around 63% percent). Białystok's prewar Jewish population of more than nn,nnn constituted about xx percent of the city's total population. World War II changed all of this, in 1939, ca. 107,000 persons lived in Białystok, but in 1946 - only 56,759, and to this day there is much less ethnic diversity than in the previous 300 years of the city's history. Currently the city's population is 97% Polish, 2.5% Belarusian and 0.5% of a number of minorities including Russians, Lipka Tartars, Ukrainians and Romani. Most of the modern <b>day</b> <b>population</b> growth is based on internal migration and urbanization.|$|E

40|$|The {{separation}} of populations by ice sheets into large refugia {{can account for}} much of the genetic diversity found in present <b>day</b> <b>populations.</b> The evolutionary implications of small glacial refugia have not been as thoroughly explored. To examine refugial origins of North American mountain sheep Ovis spp., we analyzed a 604 bp portion of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region from 223 O. dalli and O. canadensis. Major refugia were identified in eastern Beringia and southern North America, and we found evidence for two smaller refugia situated between the Laurentide and Cordilleran glaciers. Our results are the first to demonstrate support for survival of any organism in the latter two refugia. These refugia also appear to have conserved a genetic signal that confirms past hybridization of O. dalli and O. canadensis...|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} of 3 Pseudomonas aeriuginosa strains as biocontrol agents of rootinfecting fungi Macrophomina phaseolina, Fusarium solani and Rhizoctonia solani and the root-knot nematode Meloidogyne javanica was tested on chili and uridbean under greenhouse conditions. All the three strains significantly reduced nematode populations in soil, invasion, multiplication and gall formation due to M. javanica. Root infection by fungi was also effectively suppressed following P. aeruginosa application. Bacterial antagonists exhibited better biocontrol and growth promoting activity in 15 -day-old plants {{than did those}} harvested at 30 or 45 <b>days.</b> <b>Population</b> of the bacterium in the rhizosphere declined rapidly after 15 days of nematode inoculation.
