5000|$|Programming <b>is</b> mostly <b>NPR</b> <b>news</b> and talk, {{with some}} KUNI {{produced}} music {{programs in the}} evenings and on weekends. It is now a part of Iowa Public Radio, operating {{with the other two}} public radio station clusters at the University of Iowa and Iowa State University. It is the flagship of IPR's [...] "News and Studio One" [...] service, which combines <b>NPR</b> <b>news</b> and talk programming with an extension of the [...] "Live from Studio One" [...] AAA program that aired on KUNI for years before the creation of IPR.|$|R
50|$|Between 1979 and March, 1986, KUHF's format <b>was</b> <b>NPR</b> <b>news</b> and jazz. In March 1986 local {{commercial}} classical music station KLEF changed its format and donated its 12,000+ disc library {{of music to}} KUHF, {{with the proviso that}} the University of Houston commit KUHF to a format that served Houston's classical music audience, recently disfranchised by the loss of KLEF. The broadcasting of classical music was explained by citing that the charter of KUHF was to provide music unavailable, otherwise, to Houston. KUHF began airing classical music during the day and late night jazz from 10PM to 5AM, with <b>NPR</b> <b>news</b> in the morning and afternoon drive time hours. During the summer, former KLEF Operations Manager John Proffitt was hired as the new General Manager for KUHF, and he arrived at his new position on August 3. After the next on-air fundraiser in October, which <b>was</b> aimed at <b>NPR,</b> classical and jazz listeners, KUHF eliminated its remaining jazz broadcasting. KUHF GM Proffitt defended eliminating several genres of jazz from Houston radio on the basis that the number of daytime classical listeners far exceeded the overnight number of jazz listeners.|$|R

5000|$|On July 17, 2015, Classical South Florida's stations, {{including}} WPBI, {{were sold}} to Educational Media Foundation and switched to EMF's K-Love contemporary Christian format (with WPBI's call sign changed to WFLV), while WFLV-HD2 and W270AD <b>are</b> still running <b>NPR</b> <b>news</b> and talk under the previous WPBI call sign. On October 16, 2015, {{it was announced that}} Miami-Dade County Public Schools owned WLRN-FM will lease the HD2 of WFLV and the translator W270AD from the Educational Media Foundation and will relaunch [...] "WPBI News" [...] in November as [...] "101.9, NPR For The Palm Beaches".

50|$|For {{the most}} part, NWPR behaves like two large networks. Seven stations, based on KWSU, {{broadcast}} <b>NPR</b> <b>news</b> and talk. Eleven other stations, based on KRFA, broadcast {{a mix of}} NPR programming and classical music. One station, KJEM 89.9, broadcasts 24-hour jazz music without any <b>NPR</b> <b>news</b> or talk programming.|$|R
50|$|The station's {{broadcasts}} consist principally of jazz {{music and}} <b>NPR</b> <b>news.</b>|$|R
50|$|WNSC-FM {{signed on}} in 1979, and was {{originally}} known as WPRV. It <b>was</b> the first <b>NPR</b> {{station in the}} Charlotte area; the market's flagship NPR station, WFAE, didn't sign on until 1981. From its sign-on until 2001, it aired a format of <b>NPR</b> <b>news</b> and classical music {{along with the rest}} of what was then the South Carolina Educational Radio Network (SCERN).|$|R

5000|$|Select <b>NPR</b> member {{stations}} <b>were</b> {{provided with}} satellite uplink equipment {{to meet the}} mission of NPR {{to provide access to}} the satellite system by independent, 3rd parties who would enhance the programming of public radio beyond NPR's own programming as well as provide for back-hauls of news reports to <b>be</b> aired on <b>NPR's</b> <b>news</b> programs or feeds of promotional material and other not for broadcast or [...] "closed circuit" [...] content. These 15 strategically located uplinks located in regions throughout the country were also to provide revenue from use by commercial entities who would pay for NPR to transmit its programming via its satellite system. Because NPR, at the time, had the only operational satellite network that could transmit in high quality, full fidelity, stereo sound, several music based commercial programs <b>were</b> distributed via <b>NPR's</b> satellite system such as Rockline, Hollywood Live, several live concerts, and some Westwood One content. These uplinks allowed producers of program to send pre-recorded or live material to an uplink in their region instead of having to send by mail or haul it by expensive telco lines to NPR's MOTC (Main Origination Technical Center, the analog PRSS predecessor to NPR's NOC) Washington uplink. Some of the very first stations to have their own uplink facilities to PRSS were KUT in Austin, Texas, and Minnesota Public Radio, both in 1980, and KUSC, Los Angeles, who provided the bulk of the commercial radio revenue uplinks, at about the same time.|$|R

50|$|In September 2004, KOSU {{moved to}} a new 1,100-foot tower near Guthrie that gave it primary {{coverage}} of Oklahoma City. Previously, <b>NPR</b> <b>news</b> and talk had gotten spotty reception in much of the area since KCSC went all-classical in 1996. The University of Oklahoma's NPR outlet, KGOU, needed a second full-power station, KROU, to cover a large portion of Oklahoma City, and even then this left much of central Oklahoma without a clear signal for <b>NPR</b> <b>news</b> programming until KOSU activated its new tower.|$|R
5000|$|On July 1, 2011, WYPM ended {{separate}} operations, and now simulcasts WITF-FM's <b>NPR</b> <b>news</b> format {{throughout the}} day. The move was undertaken to [...] "simplify operations and reduce costs." ...|$|R

50|$|Since 2010, WKAR's {{programming}} {{has been}} simulcast on WKAR-FM's HD subcarrier during the AM station's hours of operation. Originally on the FM station's second channel (HD2), it {{moved to a}} new third channel (HD3) in 2012. The <b>NPR</b> <b>news</b> and talk format continues after the AM signoff, providing a 24/7 NPR service to Lansing listeners with HD Radio receivers. This feed is also streamed via the station's website. Before 2010, Michigan Radio flagship WUOM in Ann Arbor was the only source of 24-hour <b>NPR</b> <b>news</b> programming for Lansing; its signal easily covers most of the Lansing area.|$|R
5000|$|Interlochen Center for the Arts {{acquired}} {{and launched}} sister station WICA in 2000 to feature a news- and talk-oriented format, {{and since that}} time WIAA and its two satellites (WICV and WIAB) have devoted almost all of their broadcast schedule to classical music and have not aired <b>NPR</b> <b>news</b> shows such as [...] "Morning Edition" [...] and [...] "All Things Considered", although they do feature hourly <b>news</b> updates from <b>NPR.</b> <b>NPR</b> <b>news</b> shows <b>are,</b> however, available over a portion of IPR Music Radio's listening area on CMU Public Radio, and within the coverage areas of the IPR News Radio stations (see below).|$|R
5000|$|Until 2001, the {{stations}} {{were known as}} the [...] "South Carolina Educational Radio Network," [...] airing a mix of classical music and <b>NPR</b> <b>news</b> and talk. However, since much of the state gets grade B coverage from at least two full NPR member stations, the ETV Commission opted to split the radio stations into two networks. Four stations continued to air a mix of classical music and NPR programming, while three aired an expanded schedule of <b>NPR</b> <b>news</b> and talk. The eighth station, WNSC-FM in Rock Hill, began airing exclusively jazz music {{in order to avoid}} programming duplication with WFAE in Charlotte.|$|R
50|$|In 2001, {{the station}} (along with WJWJ-FM Beaufort/Charleston and WHMC Conway/Myrtle Beach) began a {{separate}} program schedule {{from the rest}} of the SCERN stations, with a format of <b>NPR</b> <b>news,</b> talk and information.|$|R
50|$|The FCC {{granted a}} license for WUOM (for University Of Michigan) at 91.7 in {{the brand new}} FM band; the station {{went on the air}} in 1948, {{broadcasting}} from studios in Angell Hall on the UM campus. In 1949 the station moved across the street to newly completed studios on the fifth floor of the Administration Building, now known as the Literature, Science & Arts Building. Michigan Radio remained in those studios until August 23, 2003, when it moved off campus to the Argus Building on Ann Arbor's Old West Side. Its signal covers most of the southeastern and central Lower Peninsula, from Lansing to Detroit. The station provides 24-hour <b>NPR</b> <b>news</b> service to the state capital for listeners without HD Radio sets. Lansing's main <b>NPR</b> <b>news</b> member, WKAR-AM, must sign off at sundown and WKAR-FM airs the Classical 24 network from 7 pm to 5 am weeknights with minimal if any interruption for <b>news.</b> While an <b>NPR</b> <b>news</b> and talk station is available on WKAR-FM's HD subcarrier, this still leaves conventional radio listeners out in the cold.|$|R
