40|$|The aim of {{the project}} was to develop the Fizeau {{interferometer}} configuration {{to take advantage of the}} benefits derived from its “downlead insensitivity” to temperature and polarisation fading. This sensing interferometer was investigated and implemented in conjunction with various processing interferometers with the view to achieve optimised performances for Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) application. A comprehensive theoretical analysis has been carried for Signal-to-Noise ratio of these OCT systems. Balanced detection indenting two detectors with anti-phase signals was also investigated to improve further the SNR. The analysis showed that the SNR (67 dB) of the balanced Fizeau interferometer improved by 30 dB from that of standard Fizeau interferometer implementing a single detector. Experimentally, the best SNR for this configuration was achieved by adding an <b>electronic</b> <b>rectifier</b> based demodulation system for the signal after balanced detection. The OCT systems investigated in this project were developed based on a broadband source operating in the 1550 nm wavelength-band to facilitate improvement in the depth of penetration of light directed into imaged samples.

40|$|As one of {{the basic}} {{components}} of phononics, thermal diodes transmit heat current asymmetrically similar to <b>electronic</b> <b>rectifiers</b> and diodes in microelectronics. Heat can be conducted through them easily in one direction while being blocked in the other direction. In this work, we report an easily-fabricated mesoscale chemical vapor deposited (CVD) diamond thermal diode without sharp temperature change driven by the gradient grain structure of CVD diamond membranes. We build a spectral model of diamond thermal conductivity with complete phonon dispersion relation to show significant thermal rectification in CVD diamond membranes. To explain the observed thermal rectification, the temperature and thermal conductivity distribution in the CVD diamond membrane are studied. Additionally, the effects of temperature bias and diamond membrane thickness are discussed, which shed light on tuning the thermal rectification in CVD diamond membranes. The conical grain structure makes CVD diamond membranes, and potentially other CVD film structures with gradient grain structure, excellent candidates for easily-fabricated mesoscale thermal diodes without a sharp temperature change...|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{usage of}} non-linear electrical loads {{in the low}} voltage grid, leads to new challenges to the electrical network. These loads, such as <b>electronic</b> <b>rectifiers</b> or converters will strain the grid by introducing current harmonics. They create a voltage drop over the grid impedance, with respective spectra, {{that leads to a}} non-sinusoidal grid voltage. PV inverters that feed the grid decentrally and can support the grid with reactive power are generally capable of not only supplying the grid with a sinusoidal active current, but also specific non-sinusoidal reactive currents depending on the quick response of the current control. A compensating current can be determined with the measured grid voltage and respectively the complex and frequency dependent grid impedance, which ideally eliminates the voltage harmonics. For that, the grid voltage signal needs to be analysed by a group of digital filters tuned to different harmonics. Thus, from the filter results and the knowledge of the grid impedance angle or adequate control algorithms, the compensating current can be determined and adjusted...|$|R

These harmonics have many well known adverse {{impacts on the}} power system. So {{it is necessary to}} improve the power quality of the rectifiers. This paper presents a novel single phase rectifier in which capacitors are used in parallel with diodes in one leg of the rectifier. A general analytical model of the proposed topology is obtained. The closed form expressions for the rectifier waveforms helps in parameter selection that leads to optimal performance in terms of input current THD. A comparative study of different topologies of rectifiers are done in terms of input voltage, current waveform distortion, output dc voltage ripple, and desired target for dc output voltage. The proposed topology reduces the total harmonic distortion from 145 percent in normal rectifier to 63 percent while maintaining voltage ripple less then 0. 3 percent. The proposed topology keeps dc bus ripple small while simultaneously providing better THD. The passive components considered for improving harmonic injection are 2 small capacitors.

40|$|International audienceThe {{electrical}} properties of Schottky contacts on the (100) surface of Boron doped diamond films epitaxially grown on Ib substrates are investigated in this work. The role of Boron doping concentration and extended defects detected by cathodoluminescence is correlated to current voltage characteristics, rectifying efficiency and high voltage {{performance of the}} diodes up to 1 kV and more. The influence of surface treatment prior to metal deposition is highlighted and the choice of metal for the Schottky contact is discussed. The paramount importance of using an oxidised diamond surface at the Schottky contacts and outside is demonstrated. Decreasing the series resistance of diodes is obtained {{with a stack of}} two layers, the upper one being lightly doped while the deeper one contains Boron concentrations close to the metallic conductivity threshold (4 x 10 (20) B/cm(3)). Several architectures are studied. The ohmic contact directly laid on the heavily doped layer permits forward current densities of 66 A/cm(2) under 4 V at room temperature and switching times in the nanosecond range. This set of results shows that p-type diamond is an adequate semiconductor for implementing high speed, high power and high voltage <b>electronic</b> <b>rectifiers...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract Several DC loads in {{data center}} and telecom {{industry}} are fed by power <b>electronic</b> <b>rectifiers.</b> The same rectifiers {{are used to}} charge a number of batteries which serve as a backup power source in case of power outage or failure of rectifiers. However, the stored energy in the backup batteries is not utilized efficiently due to reliable source of power from the mains. Therefore, the industry is demanding a highly efficient PFC converter with bidirectional power flow. Significant improvement has been observed {{in the performance of}} power converters since the existence of wide band gap (WBG) devices in the power electronics industry. WBG devices provide high breakdown voltage and high thermal conductivity which enable to produce a more efficient and higher power density converter. In this master thesis, a novel bidirectional PFC converter with totem pole topology is presented for energy storage application. The totem pole topology employs two fast WBG switches and another two slow but very low on-resistance Si MOSFET switches. Since the current is not flowing through the body diode of power MOSFETs the reverse recovery dissipation of the active switches are significantly reduced. The proposed topology provides high PF with minimum input current harmonics, high efficiency and high power density. A literature review on wide band gap devices such as SiC and GaN has been done. The dual benefits of low on-resistance and reverse recovery charge from GaN enhance the performance of the totem pole topology, especially in terms of efficiency. Whereas, high thermal conductivity property of SiC enable to down size the heat sink and hence increase power density. A brief study is made on the functionality of the proposed converter for smart grid application together with battery capacities in telecom network. The research indicates that there is a huge potential of stored energy in the telecom site. Therefore, bidirectional PFC boost converter will be a power solution for efficient and cost effective use of electricity storage that also can feed power back to the grid. The proposed topology has been studied using computer simulation and tested in laboratory experiment. Based on the specification, a prototype is produced by employing SiC MOSFETs...|$|R

40|$|Note: Author’s {{signature}} redacted from title page. The {{percentage of}} D-C motors {{being used in}} industry is greater than ever before. One {{reason for this is}} that in the last twenty years the development of the <b>electronic</b> tube <b>rectifier</b> has facilitated the economical conversion of A-C power to D-C power. The recent improvement of dry disk rectifiers, particularly selenium rectifiers, suggests that they may soon seriously compete with tube rectifiers in many applications. The writer has attempted in this thesis to do two things. Firstly: to outline the theory of rectification, dwelling particularly upon the advantages and disadvantages of the commonly used rectifier circuits. This material has been augmented with numerous oscillograms which are so often lacking in texts and technical literature. Secondly: to point out the advantages and disadvantages of dry disk rectifiers as applied to rectifier-motor drives. This work is not original, but rather a compilation of information found scattered throughout the literature. The use of a multi-rectifier-motor drive is suggested; this type of drive has not, to the writers knowledge, been discussed elsewhere in the literature. Time limitations have made a study of this drive impossible...|$|R
