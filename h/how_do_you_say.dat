500|$|In the Court of Appeals seat, Sotomayor {{gained a}} {{reputation}} for vigorous and blunt behavior toward lawyers appealing before her, sometimes {{to the point of}} brusque and curt treatment or testy interruptions. [...] She was known for extensive preparation for oral arguments and for running a [...] "hot bench", where judges ask lawyers plenty of questions. Unprepared lawyers suffered the consequences, but the vigorous questioning was an aid to lawyers seeking to tailor their arguments to the judge's concerns. The 2009 Almanac of the Federal Judiciary, which collected anonymous evaluations of judges by lawyers who appear before them, contained a wide range of reactions to Sotomayor. Comments also diverged among lawyers willing to be named. Attorney Sheema Chaudhry said, [...] "She's brilliant and she's qualified, but I just feel that she can be very, <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>say,</b> temperamental." [...] Defense lawyer Gerald B. Lefcourt said, [...] "She used her questioning to make a point, as opposed to really looking for an answer to a question she did not understand." [...] In contrast, Second Circuit Judge Richard C. Wesley said that his interactions with Sotomayor had been [...] "totally antithetical to this perception that has gotten some traction that she is somehow confrontational." [...] Second Circuit Judge and former teacher Guido Calabresi said his tracking showed that Sotomayor's questioning patterns were no different from those of other members of the court and added, [...] "Some lawyers just don’t like to be questioned by a woman. [...] was sexist, plain and simple." ...|$|E

His interview with Obama was on the Senator's first day. Uninterested in Favreau's résumé, Obama instead questioned Favreau on what motivated him to work in politics, and what his theory of writing was. He described this theory to Obama as, [...] "A speech can broaden the circle of people who care about this stuff. <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> to the average person that's been hurting: 'I hear you, I'm there?'
