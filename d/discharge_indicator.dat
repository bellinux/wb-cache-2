40|$|AbstractObjectivesThis project {{evaluated}} if {{by focusing}} on process changes and tool use rather than key indicator rates, the use of evidence-based therapies in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) would increase. BackgroundThe use of tools designed to improve quality of care in the American College of Cardiology AMI Guidelines Applied in Practice Pilot Project resulted in improved adherence to evidence-based therapies for patients, but overall, tool use was modest. MethodsThe current project, implemented in five hospitals, was modeled after the previous project, but with greater emphasis on tool use. This allowed early identification of barriers to tool use and strategies to overcome barriers. Main outcome measures were AMI quality indicators in pre-measurement (January 1, 2001 to June 30, 2001) and post-measurement (December 15, 2001 to March 31, 2002) samples. ResultsOne or more tools were used in 93 % of patients (standard orders = 82 %, and discharge document = 47 %). Tool use was associated with significantly higher adherence to most <b>discharge</b> quality <b>indicator</b> rates with increases in aspirin, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and smoking cessation and dietary counseling. Patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) had low rates of <b>discharge</b> <b>indicators.</b> Patients undergoing percutaneous coronary revascularization {{were more likely to}} receive evidence-based therapies. ConclusionsThese data validate the results of the pilot project that quality of AMI care can be improved through the use of guideline-based tools. Identifying and overcoming barriers to tool use led to substantially higher rates of tool use. The low rates of adherence to quality indicators in patients undergoing CABG suggest that these patients should be particularly targeted for quality improvement efforts...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{small and}} {{medium-sized}} basins or in rivers characterized by intermittent discharges, with low or negligible/null observed values {{for long periods of}} the year, the correct representation of the discharge regime is important for issues related to water management and to define the amount and quality of water available for irrigation, domestic and recreational uses. In these cases, only one index as a statistical metric is often not enough; it is thus necessary to introduce Flow Duration Curves (FDC). The aim of this study is therefore to combine a stochastic index flow model capable of reproducing the FDC record period of a river, regardless of the persistence and seasonality of the series, with the theory of total probability in order to calculate how often a river is dry. The paper draws from preliminary analyses, including a study to estimate the correlation between <b>discharge</b> <b>indicators</b> Q 95, Q 50 and Q 1 (discharges exceeding 95 %, 50 % or 1 % of the time, respectively) and some fundamental characteristics of the basin, as well as to identify homogeneous regions in the target area through the study of several geomorphological features and climatic conditions. The stochastic model was then applied in one of the homogeneous regions that includes intermittent rivers. Finally, the model was regionalized by means of regression analysis in order to calculate the FDC for ungauged basins; the reliability of this method was tested using jackknife validation. ...|$|R

Objective {{is to describe}} and to compare outcome quality of care offered by three hospitals providing in-patient rehabilitative treatment exemplified for patients with chronic headache. Methods We performed a prospective three center observational study on patients suffering from chronic headache. Patients underwent interventions commonly used according to internal guidelines of the hospitals. Measurements were taken at three points in time (at admission, at discharge and 6 months after <b>discharge).</b> <b>Indicators</b> of outcome quality included pain intensity and frequency of pain, functional ability, depression, {{quality of life and}} health related behavior. Analyses of differences amongst the hospitals were adjusted by covariates due to case-mix situation. Results 306 patients from 3 hospitals were included in statistical analysis. Amongst the hospitals, patients differed significantly in age, education, diagnostic subgroups, beliefs, and with respect to some pain-related baseline values (covariates). Patients in all three hospitals benefited from intervention to a clinically relevant degree. At discharge from hospital, outcome quality differed significantly after adjustment according to case-mix only in terms of patients' global assessment of treatment results. Six months after discharge, the only detectable significant differences were for secondary outcomes like improved coping with stress or increased use of self-help. The profiles for satisfaction with the hospital stay showed clear differences amongst patients. Conclusion The results of this case study do not suggest a definite overall ranking of the three hospitals that were compared, but outcome profiles offer a multilayer platform of reliable information which might facilitate decision making. </p...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Hospitals {{that provide}} stroke care vary in {{performance}} related to discharge care planning and secondary stroke prevention. Aim: To design and pilot a quality improvement program to reduce disparities between hospitals for discharge planning and secondary prevention. Methods: Three <b>discharge</b> <b>indicators</b> collected in Queensland hospitals within the Australian Stroke Clinical Registry (AuSCR) were used: 1) discharge care plan; 2) antihypertensive medication prescription; and 3) antiplatelet medication prescription if an ischemic event. An aggregated performance score {{was calculated for}} each hospital. Clinicians from an exemplar hospital with ‘top performance’ {{were part of a}} focus group to elicit their success factors. Two hospitals with performance levels below their peers then participated in an evidence-based, multifaceted interven- tion that included data reviews; sharing of exemplar hospital success factors and two workshops resulting in development of an action plan. AuSCR data were reviewed 2 – 3 months after workshop 2 and compared to the pre-intervention results. Results: The aggregated score improved for each site post intervention (site 1 : 18 % [p = 0. 01]; site 2 : 30 % [p = 0. 005]). Both achieved signiﬁcant improvements for adherence to discharge care planning (site 1 : 46 % [p = 0. 004]; site 2 : 67 % [p < 0. 001]) and one site signiﬁcantly improved adherence to prescription of antihypertensive medications at discharge (site 2 : 31 % [p = 0. 04]). Due to ceiling effects no signiﬁcant improvement was observed in adherence to prescription of antiplatelet medication.

Such reconstructions provide insights into the role of anthropogenic vs natural forcings in the actual climatic trend. Here, we present the palynological analysis of a 36 cm-long core collected from the Mackenzie Through in the Canadian Beaufort Sea. Dinocyst assemblages were used to quantitatively reconstruct the evolution of sea surface conditions (temperature, salinity, sea ice) and freshwater palynomorphs influxes were used as local paleo-river <b>discharge</b> <b>indicators</b> over the last ~ 150 yr. Dinocyst assemblages are dominated by autotrophic taxa (68 to 96 %). Pentapharsodinium dalei is the dominant specie throughout most of the core, except at the top where the assemblages are dominated by Operculodinium centrocarpum. Quantitative reconstructions of sea surface parameters display a serie of relatively warm, lower sea ice and saline episodes in surface waters, alternately with relatively cool and low salinity episodes. The warm episodes are characterized with high dinocyst productivity. Variations of dinocyst influxes and reconstructed sea surface conditions are closely linked to large scale atmospheric circulation patterns such as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and to a lesser degree, the Arctic Oscillation (AO). Positive phases of the PDO correspond to increases of dinocyst influxes, warmer and saltier surface waters, which we associate with upwelling events of warm and relatively saline water from Pacific origin. Freshwater palynomorph influxes increased in three phases from AD 1857 until reaching maximum values in AD 1991, suggesting that the Mackenzie River discharge followed the same trend when its discharge peaked between AD 1989 and AD 1992. The PDO mode seems to dominate the climatic variations at multi-annual to decadal timescales in the Western Canadian Arctic and Beaufort Sea areas...|$|R

This study assessed brown and rainbow trout spawning habitat quality using grain-size distributions, pebble counts and sieve analyses, bed mobility estimates, painted tracers and shear stress, and secondary discharge data in the Bear River, from Combie Reservoir to the Wolf Creek confluence in the Sierra Nevada Foothills of California. Median diameters of potential spawning sediment in three of seven sediment samples were within the optimal size range for spawning (D 50, 15 - 30 mm), however, spawning sediment was limited in the selected representative study reach. Bed mobility estimates indicated fine sediment transport (< 10 mm) and immobility of potential spawning sediment (D 50, 15 - 30 mm), suggesting optimal trout spawning habitat conditions. Analysis of average monthly discharge in the Bear River from 2010 to 2013 indicated that flow conditions for brown and rainbow trout spawning are within the optimal range (0. 27 to 56 cms), as defined by trout water velocity requirements and study site geometry. For both brown and rainbow trout spawning habitat quality, less than optimal conditions were determined for sediment size and availability.

Cunninghamella bertholletiae can also grow at higher temperatures, {{which can be}} helpful in testing contaminated surfaces to differentiate between benign and pathogenic fungi. Infections from the six different taxonomic families of Mucorales have virtually indistinguishable clinical courses. Furthermore, the difficulty of culturing C. bertholletiae and other species within Mucorales from tissue samples [...] makes laboratory analysis necessary to determine the causative organism of a mucormycosis. Polymerase chain reaction-based sequencing of fungal isolates is preferred as a reliable diagnostic tool due to possible difficulty of isolating C. bertholletiae from patients in culture. However, preliminary antifungal treatment should never be delayed if C. bertholletiae infection is suspected, as infections can often cause rapid and invasive tissue damage. Genetic differences within the species C. bertholletiae can also be important determinants of pathogenicity and virulence. Recently, DNA barcoding of the Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) region of C. bertholletiae ribosomal DNA was performed to improve upon current diagnostic techniques, providing more accurate and detailed between- and within-species discrimination compared to traditional analysis of colony colour and morphology, maximum growth temperature, and reproductive characteristics.|$|R
40|$|Pathogen {{indicators}} {{normally used}} in water quality indicator because {{large numbers of}} the bacteria are always present in the faeces of humans, but are not naturally found in water. Since these bacteria don’t live long in water once outside the intestine, their presence in water means there has been recent contamination through effluent discharges or other sources. Like other enteric pathogens, a common mode of transmission for E. coli is via contaminated water, food and by direct person to person contact. Infection often causes severe bloody diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and possibly fever. In some cases, infection can lead to kidney failure and possibly death.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Considerations {{about the}} {{application}} of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) should include the expected probability of survival. The survival probability after CPR may be more accurately estimated by the occurrence in time of the prearrest morbidity of patients. OBJECTIVE: To identify risk factors for poor survival after CPR {{in relation to the}} dynamics of prearrest morbidity. METHODS: Medical records of CPR patients were reviewed. Prearrest morbidity was established by categorizing the medical diagnoses according to 3 functional time frames: before hospital admission, on hospital admission, and during hospital admission. Indicators of poor survival after CPR were identified through a logistic regression model. RESULTS: Included in the study were 553 CPR patients with a median age of 68 years (age range, 18 - 98 years); 21. 7 % survived to hospital <b>discharge.</b> Independent <b>indicators</b> of poor outcome were an age of 70 years or older (odds ratio [OR]= 0. 6, 95 % confidence interval [CI]= 0. 4 - 0. 9), stroke (OR= 0. 3, 95 % CI= 0. 1 - 0. 7) or renal failure (OR= 0. 3, 95 % CI= 0. 1 - 0. 8) before hospital admission, and congestive heart failure during hospital admission (OR= 0. 4, 95 % CI= 0. 2 - 0. 9). Indicators of good survival were angina pectoris before hospital admission (OR= 2. 1, 95 % CI= 1. 3 -. 3. 3) or ventricular dysrhythmia as the diagnosis on hospital admission (OR= 11. 0, 95 % CI= 4. 1 - 33. 7). Based on a logistic regression model, 17. 4 % of our CPR patients (n= 96) were identified as having a high risk for a poor outcome (< 10 % survival). CONCLUSIONS: Time of prearrest morbidity has a prognostic value for survival after CPR. Patients at risk for poor survival can be identified on or during hospital admission, but {{the reliability and validity of}} the model needs further research. Although decisions will not be made by the model, its information can be useful for physicians in discussions about patient prognoses and to make decisions about CPR with more confidenc...|$|R
40|$|Groundwater {{reserves}} form {{an important}} component of drinking water supply options in Western Australia; however, an understanding of their importance in maintaining ecologically significant aquatic communities prior to their exploitation is required to ensure those ecological values are maintained. This ongoing study began in 2005 and is examining the fish migration patterns, population demographics and community structure in the Blackwood River and its tributaries within and outside the surface expression zone of a major south-west aquifer, the Yarragadee. These patterns are being related to environmental variables and the reliance of these communities on groundwater discharge is being assessed. Many of the spatial and temporal variations in migration patterns are attributed to differences in hydrological regimes of these systems. Groundwater input into the Blackwood is proportionally most significant in summer and autumn and this creates refuge habitats for these endemic species. Sites receiving most groundwater discharge having considerably greater abundances of salt-intolerant freshwater endemic species than those upstream of the discharge.

Cs measured in water discharges are used to determine if released amounts of PCBs are compatible with increases revealed in the river. As water velocity can greatly vary along a river stretch and influences the uptake at each site in a different way, differences in velocity have {{to be taken into account}} to correctly interpret Cs. LDPE strips were exposed to velocities between 1. 6 and 37 cm s− 1 using a channel system built in the field. Relationships between velocity and Cs were established for each iPCB to determine the expected change in Cs due to velocity variations. For PCBs 28 and 52, this change does not exceed a factor 2 for velocity variations in the range from 1. 6 to 100 cm s− 1 (extrapolated data above 37 cm s− 1). For PCBs 101, 138, 153 and 180, this change only exceeds a factor 2 in the case of large velocity variations.

This prospective cohort study aimed to investigate the currently undefined prevalence of EHV- 1 and - 4 in young Thoroughbreds at an auction sale in South Africa, and associations between clinical signs, physiological stress and viral detection. Ninety, two-year old Thoroughbreds (51 colts, 39 fillies) were consigned from eight farms and sampled at a South African auction sale. The horses were monitored for pyrexia and nasal discharge. Nasal swabs were collected for quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assay to detect EHV- 1 and - 4 and faecal samples were collected for enzyme immunoassay (EIA) to determine faecal glucocorticoid metabolite (FGM) concentrations. EHV- 4 nucleic acid was detected in some and EHV- 1 nucleic acid in none of the population. Pyrexia and nasal <b>discharge</b> were poor <b>indicators</b> of EHV- 4 status. Variation in FGM concentrations was best explained by transportation and preparation for auction.

40|$|The aim of {{this project}} was to {{evaluate}} the present state and possible changes of water resources in Lake Ladoga and its drainage basin {{for the purposes of}} the sustainable development of North-Western Russia and Finland. The group assessed the state of the water resources in quantitative and qualitative terms, taking the system of sustainable development indicators suggested by the International Commission on Sustainable Development as a basis for assessment. These include pressure indicators (annual withdrawals of ground and surface water, domestic consumption of water per capita), state indicators (ground water reserves, concentration of faecalcoliform in fresh water, biochemical oxygen demand), and response indicators (waste-water treatment coverage, density of hydrological networks). The group proposed the following additional indicators and indices for the complex evaluation of the qualitative and quantitative state of the region's water resources: * Pressure indicators (external load, coefficient of anthropogenic pressure) * State indicators and indices (concentrations of chemicals in water, concentrations of chemicals in sediments, index of water pollution, critical load, critical limit, internal load, load/critical load, concentration/critical limit, internal load/external load, trophic state, biotic indicators and indices) * Response <b>indicators</b> (<b>discharges</b> of pure water, polluted water, partly treated water and the ratio between these, trans-boundary fluxes of pollutants, state expenditure on environmental protection, human life span) The assessment considered both temporal and spatial aspects and produced a regional classification of the area according to the index of water pollution. Mathematical models were developed to describe and forecast the processes under way in the lake and can be used to estimate the influence of climatic changes on the hydrological regime, as well as the influence of anthropogenic load on the trophic state of Lake Ladoga and to assess the consequences of accidental discharges of polluting admixtures of different kinds into the lake. The results of this mathematical modelling may be of use to decision-makers responsible for the management of water resources...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} on 57 local breed cows suffering from various degrees of endometritis. The clinical examination included visual examination of vagina supported by uterine palpation per rectum; the laboratory examination included the bacterial isolation from the uterine swabs and histopathological examination of the uterine biopsies. Animals were randomly divided in to three groups of 15 cows each and 12 cows were considered as a control group received no treatment and observed for three consecutive estrous cycles. The first group was treated {{with a mixture of}} oxytetracycline (4 g) and tylosin (2 g), second group was treated with cephquenome sulfate 0. 5 g, and the third group was treated with lugol's solution (30 ml) 2 %. These treatments were applied as a single intrauterine infusion and the clinical recovery was evaluated at the next estrous cycle by considering the absence of abnormal vagina <b>discharge</b> as an <b>indicator</b> of clinical recovery. Cows that showed clinical cure were inseminated artificially and the pregnancy diagnosis was preformed at least 75 days after insemination by rectal palpation. Retained placenta was the most important predisposing factor of endometritis 50. 8 %, results of the bacterial examination demonstrated that E. coli was the most prevalence bacteria (27. 4 %). Histopathological examination of uterine biopsy showed a high incidence ratio of chronic endometritis (42. 1 %). Results of the treatment showed a higher response and conception rate in the second group (using of cephquenome) 73. 3 % and 63. 3 %, respectively, followed by first group (using mixture of oxytetracycline and tylosin) 60 % and 55. 5 %, respectively, then the third group (using of lugol's solution) 40 % and 50 %, respectively. The lowest cure and conception rates were observed in the control group 25 % and 33. 3 %, respectively. This study pointed out a positive relationship between the nature of the vaginal discharge and each of the bacteriological and histopathological examination and revealed the importance of the early treatment of endometritis especially using of cephquenome sulfate...|$|R
40|$|Microbial risks {{need to be}} {{properly}} handled {{for the provision of}} healthy drinking water. The mitigation of pathogens in the water source lowers the risk for infection associated with nominal and suboptimal drinking water treatment. Several recent waterborne outbreaks have been related to point discharges of sewage in surface waters, involving pathogenic bacteria, viruses and parasites. Diffuse sources further contribute with faecal matter, although these are difficult to estimate compared to point discharges. As rainfall often results in pathogen peak concentrations in surface waters, the microbial levels during rainfall events need particular consideration. Different approaches have been used in this thesis to assess the microbial release from point and diffuse faecal sources in surface waters under dry and wet weather conditions. Wastewater discharges as a point source from the urban sewer systems along the River Göta älv were investigated, and several log-unit higher microbial loads were found in wet weather compared to dry weather. Results from a pathogen sampling program combined with quantitative microbial risk assessments indicated the highest infection risk for noroviruses and enteroviruses. The ability to close the river raw water intake for Gothenburg prevented pathogen peak concentrations from reaching the water treatment plants. To regulate this pathogen barrier, information on upstream <b>discharge</b> events, rainfall, <b>indicator</b> bacteria and turbidity was found more appropriate than the reliance on a single threshold value for E. coli. Bacteroidales human (BacH) and ruminant (BacR) genetic markers, targeting faecal matter from humans and ruminants, were quantified in water samples collected around the Lake Rådasjön. Positive correlations with cultivable faecal indicators in event samples provided support for the impact of human faecal matter from on-site sewers. The human and ruminant markers were detected in soil at several log-units lower levels compared to faecal matter. In microcosm trials, the inactivation of the genetic markers agreed with the faecal indicator bacteria and somatic coliphages, and decay coefficients were used in hydrodynamic modelling for the Lake Rådasjön. A Bayesian Monte Carlo approach including expert judgements on faecal sources was successfully applied to provide a reliability measure for findings of genetic markers at specific sampling sites...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: (1) To {{compare the}} {{effectiveness}} of two clinical protocols {{for the management of}} vaginal discharge in the situations where no laboratory facilities are available but speculum examination is possible and where basic laboratory facilities are available. (2) To determine clinical and simple laboratory indicators for diagnosis of patients with vaginal discharge in the local setting. DESIGN: Alternate allocation of subjects to one of two management protocols. SUBJECTS: Women presenting to university gynaecology outpatients department with a complaint of vaginal discharge. METHODS: Subjects were alternately allocated management according to one of two protocols: one without (group A) and one with (group B) immediate access to results of basic laboratory tests. Full clinical assessment including speculum examination and microbiological assessment for infection with gonorrhoea, chlamydia, candida, trichomonas, and bacterial vaginosis was performed on all women. Follow up assessment of clinical and microbiological response was performed 1 - 2 weeks later. RESULTS: At initial assessment, both groups were similar in all respects except that more group B women had inflammation of the vulva. The prevalences of various conditions were: candidiasis 22 %, bacterial vaginosis 38 %, trichomoniasis 4 %, chlamydia 4 %, gonorrhoea 0. 4 %. There was no association between any demographic characteristic and diagnosis of cause of the discharge. Both protocols resulted in clinically and statistically significant improvements for women with candidiasis, bacterial vaginosis, and trichomoniasis. There were no clinically important differences in outcomes between the two protocols. The sensitivities and specificities of various indicators were: curd-like vaginal discharge for candidiasis, 72 % and 100 %; homogeneous vaginal discharge for bacterial vaginosis or trichomoniasis, 94 % and 88 %; absent or scanty lactobacilli for bacterial vaginosis, 99 % and 68 %; > 20 % clue cells for bacterial vaginosis, 81 % and 99 %; visible endocervical mucopus for chlamydia or gonorrhoea, 36 % and 86 %; microscopic endocervical mucopus for chlamydia or gonorrhoea, 64 % and 69 %. CONCLUSIONS: Both protocols were equally effective in managing women with abnormal vaginal <b>discharge.</b> Simple clinical <b>indicators</b> for candidiasis, bacterial vaginosis, or trichomonas as in protocol A are sufficiently sensitive and specific for use in situations with no laboratory support. A modification to protocol A could increase detection of bacterial vaginosis at basic health service level. Further work is needed to identify appropriate indicators for infection with chlamydia or gonorrhoea. ...|$|R
40|$|Background: Outcome after {{head injury}} is heterogeneous; in particular, late outcome {{including}} disability and {{increased risk of}} mortality are only partly explained by {{the severity of the}} injury and demographic factors (McMillan et al., 2014; McMillan et al., 2012; Whitnall et al., 2006). The allostatic load model conceptualises how stressors can chronically elevate physiological activity and impact on health (McEwen, 1998 b). Allostatic load {{has been shown to be}} associated with psychosocial functioning, morbidity, and mortality and can predict these outcomes at follow-up; however, it has never been investigated with outcome in the head injury population. The studies in this thesis explore the extent to which allostatic load is associated with cognitive and disability outcome, and change in disability over time after head injury. Methods: A systematic search was conducted to inform how to measure allostatic load; 15 indicators of health were assessed representing immune, cardiovascular, anthropometric, metabolic, and neuroendocrine system functioning, and were combined using a summation z-score method to create allostatic load scores. Four empirical studies were conducted to investigate the relationship between allostatic load and outcome after head injury; at discharge from hospital in severe head injury participants (n = 35), at 6 month follow-up (n = 28), late (median 27 years) after head injury (n = 41), and late after repeat concussion in retired international rugby players (n = 48). Allostatic load was also compared with cognitive function late after head injury and repeat concussion and with change in disability between hospital discharge and 6 month follow-up, and from 6 months post-discharge to late after injury. In all the studies, the allostatic load scores of head injury participants were compared to that of non-head injured comparison participants. Results: The studies within this thesis found limited evidence to suggest that allostatic load was associated with outcome after head injury. There was no association between allostatic load and disability outcome, change in disability over time, or cognitive function in the severe head injury studies. There was a significant relationship between higher neuroendocrine component scores at hospital discharge and worse disability outcome at 6 month follow-up, indicating possible pathophysiological consequences of neuroendocrine indicators early after injury. Also, the finding that head injury participants had higher anthropometric and metabolic component scores than comparison participants late after injury, and that greater disability over a median of 27 years was associated with higher metabolic component scores, indicates that brain damage causes an increase in secondary outcomes of allostatic load, which potentially has implications of an increased risk of morbidities over time. There was no association between allostatic load and frequency of concussions and therefore a number of outcomes in the retired international rugby player group; with the exception of an unexpected inverse relationship between allostatic load and time to complete a fine motor co-ordination task. Conclusion: Findings from this thesis do not support the hypothesis that accumulated physiological dysregulation explain the heterogeneity after head injury. Some of the findings in this thesis require further study to investigate the pathophysiological consequences of higher neuroendocrine <b>indicators</b> at hospital <b>discharge</b> and metabolic <b>indicators</b> late after injury. Also it is important to understand the causes of increased metabolic and anthropometric component scores late after head injury to explore potential interventions to reduce possible increased risk of morbidities and mortality. The atypical findings in the investigation of allostatic load and repeat concussion indicate the accumulation of allostatic load in elite athletes is different to the general population. As none of the studies presented in this thesis found evidence for an association between allostatic load and disability outcome, there is a clear need for more research into factors that predict the heterogeneity of outcome after head injury...|$|R
