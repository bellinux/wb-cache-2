40|$|The {{anomalous}} {{survival of}} neonatal C 3 <b>H</b> <b>skin</b> grafts on CBA mice is {{correlated with the}} emigration of passenger leukocytes from the graft vasculature. Thus, newborn homografts whose leukocyte populations are eliminated by X-irradiation or by transient sojourn on an intermediate adult C 3 H host, do not display prolonged survival. Moreover, the continued presence of the newborn grafts is not requisite {{to the maintenance of}} the unresponsive state, an observation consonant with the demonstration that CBA mice bearing long-term neonatal C 3 <b>H</b> <b>skin</b> grafts are leukocyte chimeras. In contrast, neonatal male C 57 skin grafts may persist on C 57 females after heavy irradiation of the donor, or after passage on an intermediate adult male host. In addition, tolerance is broken by removal of long-persistant newborn grafts from hitherto unresponsive females, and chimerism is not detectable in female C 57 mice tolerant of infant male isografts. Finally, leukocytes of neonatal C 3 H origin, inoculated subcutaneously into CBA males, may occasionally render these animals unresponsive to subsequent adult C 3 <b>H</b> <b>skin</b> homografts, whereas those taken from infant C 57 males usually sensitize their adult female hosts. Thus, passenger leukocytes are implicated in the extended survival of C 3 H neonatal homografts on CBA recipients, but not in the persistence of H-Y-incompatible neonatal skin isografts on C 57 females...|$|E

40|$|Thaumatin-like {{proteins}} (TLPs) and chitinases are the {{two main}} groups of pathogenesisrelated (PR) proteins found in wine that cause protein haze formation. Previous {{studies have found that}} phenolics are also involved in protein haze formation. In this study, Sauvignon Blanc grapes were harvested and processed in two vintages (2011 and 2012) by three different treatments: (1) hand harvesting with whole bunch press (H-WB); (2) hand harvesting with destem/crush and 3 <b>h</b> <b>skin</b> contact (H-DC- 3); and (3) machine harvesting with destem/crush and 3 <b>h</b> <b>skin</b> contact (M-DC- 3). The juices were collected at three pressure levels (0. 4 MPa, 0. 8 MPa and 1. 6 MPa), some juices were fermented in 750 mL of wine bottles to determine the bentonite requirement for the resulting wines. Results showed juices of M-DC- 3 had significantly lower concentration of proteins, including PR proteins, compared to those of H-DC- 3, likely due to the greater juice yield of M-DC- 3 and interactions between proteins and phenolics. Juices from the 0. 8 – 1. 6 MPa pressure and resultant wines had the highest concentration of phenolics but the lowest concentration of TLPs. This supported the view that TLPs are released at low pressure as they are mainly present in grape pulp but additional extraction of phenolics largely present in skin occurs at higher pressing pressure. Wine protein stability tests showed a positive linear correlation between bentonite requirement and the concentration of chitinases, indicating the possibility of predicting bentonite requirement by quantification of chitinases. This study contributes to an improved understanding of extraction of haze-forming PR proteins and phenolics that can influence bentonite requirement for protein stabilizatio...|$|E
40|$|Neonatal {{skin grafts}} have the {{capacity}} to outlive adult skin grafts, especially in situations involving H- 2 antigen compatibility of donor and host. Neonatal grafts can induce a state of tolerance in their hosts; in many cases, recipients exposed to neonatal allografts fail to reject adult grafts from the same donor strain. In the H- 2 antigen compatible C 3 H ↔ CBA combination, survival of neonatal skin grafts is correlated with the emigration of passenger leukocytes from the graft vasculature. Removal of a neonatal C 3 <b>H</b> <b>skin</b> graft has no effect on the unresponsive state of the host with respect to subsequent grafts of adult tissue. Donor leukocytes arc present in various tissues of the tolerant CBA host, and treatments (such as irradiation) that eliminate the normal leukocytic population of a neonatal C 3 <b>H</b> <b>skin</b> graft also eliminate the likelihood of skin graft survival and block the establishment of tolerance. In the C 57 BL/ 6 (B 6) male-to-female system, survival of neonatal skin grafts is not correlated with emigration of passenger cells. Removal of a neonatal male B 6 graft breaks the tolerance of the female host. The tolerant female is not a leukocyte chimera, and irradiation of the neonatal graft or replacement of the passenger cells with adult male cells does not eliminate the likelihood of graft survival nor does it block the establishment of tolerance. Moreover, passenger cells play no part in tolerance to Sk antigen incompatible grafts; Sk (skin-specific) antigens do not occur in lymphocytes. The anomalous survival of neonatal skin rafts, evidently promoted by different mechanisms in different donor-host combinations, remains to be clarified. And it remains also to be determined whether the idiosyncratic performance of certain neonatal passenger cells has any physiological relevance...|$|E

Subsequently, skin was irradiated with 1 MED and 2 MED, respectively, and after 24 <b>h</b> <b>skin</b> biopsies were analysed immunohistologically for the number of apoptotic cells and presence of pyknotic nuclear debris.

No differences were detected in the numbers of apoptotic keratinocytes between patients and controls or in the amount of pyknotic nuclear debris following 1 and 2 MED irradiation, respectively. Absolute UVB doses were correlated with the number of apoptotic keratinocytes; dose-responses did not differ significantly between patients and controls. Conclusions. Increased sensitivity of SLE patients to UVB, although associated with a history of malar rash, is not related to increased induction of apoptosis or increased levels of secondary necrosis in the skin.

After 7 - 10 d, cells grown in Ilr 3 -containing medium were screened for their capacity to suppress cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) generation against self-MHC antigens in allogeneic mixed lymphocyte cultures. Cells capable of suppressing anti-OH CTL generation were cloned by limiting dilution. Several suppressor clones were established that exhibited strong suppression of anti-H- 2 k, anti-H- 2 Kk/Ik, and anti-H- 21) k CTL generation, but failed to suppress anti-H- 2 d and anti-H- 2 b responses. When tested in a skin allograft model, intravenous injections of these bone marrow-derived anti-self suppressor cells (2. 5 x 107 cells) together with I 1 r 3 induced prolongation of C 3 <b>H</b> <b>skin</b> allografts in anti-mouse lymphocyte serum-treated B 6 AFi mice. Injection of 11, 3 alone had no effect on allograft survival. Moreover, these cells failed to prolong B 10 AKM skin allografts on B 6 AFt recipients.

40|$|Protein {{stabilization}} {{of white wine}} is a process whereby proteins which may later {{give rise to a}} haze are removed prior to bottling. This is normally achieved by fining with bentonite, a clay material that has a strong affinity for proteins and other larger molecules. It is now well-established that pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins, which are originally derived from grape berries, are mostly responsible for haze formation. In this study, PR proteins in specific Sauvignon Blanc grape tissues were identified and quantified. Changes in the PR protein composition of grape skin and pulp during ripening and in response to environmental stresses (UV exclusion and powdery mildew infection) were determined, followed by evaluation of the impact of these changes on the extraction of PR proteins into juice. In addition, as grape harvesting and processing conditions can influence the extraction of proteins and other grape components that may interact with them, the effects of harvesting and grape processing on juice composition were investigated and protein heat instability in corresponding wines determined. Finally, the effect of skin contact on juice composition was examined in an experiment designed to investigate how the interactions between proteins and phenolics affect the extraction of grape components. Using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) technology, the main soluble PR proteins in wine, thaumatin-like proteins (TLPs) and chitinases, were identified as present in both Sauvignon Blanc grape skin and pulp, but not in the seed. The majority of identified proteins were involved in metabolism and energy. Proteins identified in grape seed were less diverse than those identified in grape skin and pulp. The sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) analysis of fractions of protein extracts separated by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) indicated the individual elution time of TLPs and chitinases. Thus, the area of these peaks was accordingly used for relative quantification of TLPs and chitinases in protein extracts of grape tissues. Ripening of Sauvignon Blanc grapes coincided with the increase in phenolic content on a per berry basis in both grape skin and pulp, but the phenolic concentration on per kg fresh weight basis showed a decreasing trend in grape skin during ripening. This suggested that the accumulation of phenolics in skin during ripening was less than the dilution effect caused by berry growth. Tannin was only detected in grape skin and the changes in tannin content was similar to total phenolics. Accumulation of proteins along with the increase of °Brix during ripening was observed in both grape skin and pulp. PR proteins were synthesized and accumulated in both skin and pulp from véraison until harvest. This increase of PR proteins in grape berries was also reflected in the corresponding juice. In addition, the concentration of PR proteins in grape berries showed a positive correlation with the concentration of total proteins. UV exclusion and powdery mildew infection resulted in decreased phenolic concentration and increased PR protein concentration, respectively, which was in agreement with previous studies. Furthermore, the results showed that the concentration of PR proteins in the resultant juice was predominantly determined by the concentration of PR proteins in grape pulp, but the concentration of PR proteins in the skin and interactions of proteins with phenolics/tannin during the juicing process may modulate the final concentration of PR proteins in juice. The UV exclusion treatment compared to the control treatment resulted in a lower concentration of PR proteins in grape skin, but not in the pulp. However, the corresponding juice showed a higher concentration of PR proteins from UV exclusion treatment suggesting the loss of PR proteins as a result of phenolic-protein interactions in UV exclusion treatment was less than control as the concentration of phenolics in grapes was significantly reduced by UV exclusion. Significantly higher concentration of PR proteins in grapes from highly scarred berries with powdery mildew infection was reflected in the resultant juice. In addition, the lower concentration of tannin in juice from these berries also suggested the loss of tannin as a result of interactions between tannin and proteins. The harvesting and grape processing experiment showed that the year and vineyard site had a major impact on juice and wine composition. For grapes harvested in the same vineyard and vintage, machine harvesting resulted in a lower concentration of proteins, particularly PR proteins, than hand harvesting with destem, crush and 3 <b>h</b> <b>skin</b> contact. These juices and wines therefore required less bentonite addition for protein stabilization as bentonite requirement had been observed to be positively correlated with concentration of chitinases in juice and wine. The results suggested that the phenolic-protein interaction and juice oxidation, which was greater in mechanical harvesting than hand harvesting may have resulted in the loss of PR proteins. Furthermore, the potential increase in PR proteins as a result of 3 <b>h</b> <b>skin</b> contact was likely having little impact on final concentration of PR proteins in juice. Pressing treatments also affected juice composition since desteming, crushing and 3 <b>h</b> <b>skin</b> contact resulted in greater juice yield and higher concentration of phenolics and proteins (including PR proteins) than whole bunch pressing. Greater extraction of phenolics was also found in juice obtained at higher pressing pressure. Investigation of the effects of skin contact showed that juice treated with 24 <b>h</b> <b>skin</b> contact had the highest concentration of total phenolics and chitinases using both fresh berries and berries that were chilled for 24 h. Thus, longer skin contact will increase the protein concentration in juice, in particular the haze forming PR proteins, but the degree of this increase might be reduced along with more phenolic compounds co-extracted from skin as a result of phenolic-protein interactions. The effect of such interaction on reducing protein concentration was reflected in decreased concentration of bovine serum albumin (BSA) in extractants after skin extraction. The concentration of phenolic and tannin in skin extracts by using extractants added with BSA was lower than by using extractants without addition of BSA, also indicating the occurrence of phenolic-protein interactions. In addition, compared to mechanically pressed juice in which no tannin was observed, hand-squeezed juice had considerable amount of tannin but lower protein concentration. This suggested that hand squeezing was likely more effective in extracting grape skin components (mainly phenolics) through repeatedly squeezing and rubbing the mixture of skin and pulp, while mechanical pressing was likely more effective to extract grape pulp components (mainly proteins) through continuously applying high pressing pressure. This PhD project has revealed the distribution of haze forming TLPs and chitinases in Sauvignon Blanc grape skin and pulp. The concentration of PR proteins in juice is predominantly determined by their concentration in grape pulp, but the extraction of phenolics from grape skin might modulate the final concentration of PR proteins in juice through the phenolic-protein interaction during juicing process. The wine protein heat instability has been found positively correlated with the concentration of chitinases. Thus, any practices that can reduce extraction of chitinases into juice are important to improve the protein stabilization in final wine products...|$|E

Previous studies have demonstrated that chronic ethanol consumption can also disrupt skin barrier function, leading to increased trans{{dermal penetration}}. This observation becomes much more relevant if a single drinking episode induces similar changes. The {{purpose of this study was}} thus to examine the transdermal penetration of three model chem-icals after acute ethanol consumption. Wistar rats were gavaged with either 10, 6, 4. 3, 3, 1. 5 g/kg ethanol or saline and allowed to recover for 2 or 24 <b>h.</b> Blood and <b>skin</b> ethanol levels were determined and in vitro penetration experiments performed. The herbicide paraquat, industrial solvent N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), and insect repellent N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET) were used as is model chemicals. Absorption was determined and directly compared between ethanol- and saline-treated skin by calculating enhancement ratios. Blood ethanol levels range from 0. 25 to 0. 015 % at 2 <b>h</b> with <b>skin</b> levels at 12 – 18 % of blood values. Ethanol enhances the absorption of paraquat, DMF, and DEET in a dose-dependent fashion. Paraquat and DEET showed no appre-ciable reduction in enhancement between 2 and 24 h postgavage for the 10 -g/kg dose, but DMF did. Enhancement ratios were higher at 24 h for 10 than for 6 g/kg animals, demonstrating a dose-response relationship for recovery time. These studies imply that increased absorption of topical chemical occurs after alcohol ingestion. Both acute and chronic ethanol consumption can compromise the dermal barrier.
