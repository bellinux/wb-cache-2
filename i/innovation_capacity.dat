Building on a rich panel data set covering 270 German labor market regions and four industries, it is particularly shown that subsidies for R&D cooperation are a suitable policy measure for stimulating the innovation efficiency of regions. The empirical findings moreover suggest that regions with low <b>innovation</b> <b>capacities</b> benefit from subsidized inter-regional cooperation involving partners with diverse industrial and sectoral backgrounds. Establishing inter-regional cooperation that give access to related knowledge and skills is more important for regions with large <b>innovation</b> <b>capacities.</b> <b>innovation</b> policy, regional innovation efficiency, R&D subsidies, cooperation networks, knowledge networks...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{unanimous}} results of the economic literature is that innovation is a critical factor for sustained economic growth. Despite this consensus, previous research on aid effectiveness has not studied the impact of aid resources devoted to promote developing countries’ <b>innovation</b> <b>capacities.</b> For this reason, this paper analyzes the impact of Official Development Assistance for Science and Technology (ODA-ST) through an endogenous growth model. The econometric estimation for the period 1993 - 2008 offers five main conclusions: i) ODA-ST effectively stimulates economic growth, ii) aid impact may be higher in countries with low <b>innovation</b> <b>capacities</b> iii) <b>innovation</b> exerts the strongest impact on growth, iv) income inequalities are an important obstacle for growth, and v) there is a a slow process of divergence in per capita income levels among developing countries...|$|R

40|$|From the 1970 s onward, the {{macroeconomic}} {{context in}} Argentina and Brazil {{was characterized by}} drastic economic changes and instability. Numerous studies have documented the generally negative effect of this environment on the <b>innovation</b> <b>capacities</b> of the manufacturing sector. This paper, however, analyses the possible emergence of new <b>innovation</b> <b>capacities</b> in the period, bringing two important phenomena to light. First, a quite substantial number of firms, even in unstable settings, redoubled their innovation efforts. Second, these firms are mainly found in {{a small group of}} sectors associated with the countries’ static advantages or in sectors favoured by specific sectoral regimes. The findings, although exploratory, are a contribution to the debate on the development of innovative capacities in unstable macroeconomic contexts and the ability of sectors associated with the two countries’ static advantages to generate spaces of innovation and value creation...|$|R

The most relevant result {{is that it is}} not possible to develop CSI in EPS in the short term, nor within the context of 21 st-century Socialism nor any other development model adopted in Venezuela due to the non-existent and / or precarious "culture of innovation" and "culture of partnership" in Venezuelan society in general, as these are essential conditions to advancing innovative, partnership processes.

50|$|Empirical {{evidence}} worldwide {{points to}} a positive link between technological innovation and economic performance. The drive of biotech firms in Germany {{was due to the}} R&D subsidies to joint projects, network partners, and close cognitive distance of collaborative partners within a cluster. These factors increased patent performance in the biotech industry. Additionally, <b>innovation</b> <b>capacity</b> explains much of the GDP growth in India and China between 1981-2004 but especially in the 1990s. Their development of a National Innovation System through heavy investment of R&D expenditures and personnel, patents, and high-tech/service exports strengthened their <b>innovation</b> <b>capacity.</b> By linking the science sector with the business sector, establishing incentives for innovative activities, and balancing the import of technology and indigenous R&D effort, both countries experienced rapid economic growth in recent decades. Also, the Council of Foreign Relations asserted that {{since the end of the}} 1970s, the U.S. has gained a disproportionate share of the world’s wealth through their aggressive pursuit of technological change, demonstrating that technological innovation is a central catalyst of steady economic performance. Concisely, evidence shows that innovation contributes to steady economic growth and rise in per capita income.|$|E

40|$|Do {{technology}} {{teachers in}} secondary schools and academic stakeholders share the national vision of knowledge and innovation when implementing Design and Technology curricula? Directions for an innovation climate have been endorsed by the federal government, and demanded by various industry groups, since 1996. This paper explores {{the extent to which}} education providers of secondary schooling have embraced the call for teaching and developing <b>innovation</b> <b>capacities</b> through technology curriculum. The Australian Science, Technology and Engineering Council (ASTEC) in 1996 underpinned “foresight” as an essential dimension to our thinking which attempts to capture the dynamics of change and the need to incorporate “technacy” in primary and secondary school and teaching practices for fostering <b>innovation</b> <b>capacities</b> among students. Various national reports have since added to this agenda including the Department of Education, Science and Training (DEST) report ‘Australia’s Teachers: Australia’s Future: Advancing Innovation, Science, Technology and Mathematics’ and the posting by DEST signalling Australia’s newest national research priority to foster the uptake of innovation in human capital.
