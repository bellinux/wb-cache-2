5000|$|The Green's {{function}} elements connecting {{pairs of}} source and field patches {{defined by the}} mesh form a matrix, which is solved numerically. Unless the Green's function is well behaved, at least for pairs of patches near each other, the Green's function must be integrated over either or both the source patch and the field patch. The form of the method in which the integrals over the source and field patches are the same is called [...] "Galerkin's method". Galerkin's method is the obvious approach for problems which are symmetrical with respect to exchanging the source and field points. In frequency domain electromagnetics, this is assured by electromagnetic reciprocity. The cost of computation involved in naive Galerkin implementations is typically quite severe. One must loop over elements twice (so we get n2 passes through) and for each pair of elements we loop through <b>Gauss</b> <b>points</b> in the elements producing a multiplicative factor proportional {{to the number of}} Gauss-points squared. Also, the function evaluations required are typically quite expensive, involving trigonometric/hyperbolic function calls. Nonetheless, the principal source of the computational cost is this double-loop over elements producing a fully populated matrix.|$|E

In the proposed approach, the macroscale problem and the mesoscale problems are weakly coupled and solved separately using the finite element method on time intervals for several waveform relaxation iterations.

40|$|In this article, a new {{multiple}} resolution volume rendering {{method for}} Finite Element Analysis (FEA) data is presented. Our method {{is composed of}} three stages: At the first stage, the <b>Gauss</b> <b>points</b> of the FEA cells are calculated. The function values, gradients, diffusions, and influence scopes of the <b>Gauss</b> <b>points</b> are computed. By representing the <b>Gauss</b> <b>points</b> as graph vertices and connecting adjacent <b>Gauss</b> <b>points</b> with edges, an adjacency graph is created. The adjacency graph is used to represent the FEA data in the subsequent computation. At the second stage, a hierarchical structure is established upon the adjacency graph. Any two neighboring vertices with similar function values are merged into a new vertex. The similarity is measured by using a user-defined threshold. Consequently a new adjacency graph is constructed. Then the threshold is increased, and the graph reduction is triggered again to generate another adjacency graph. By repeating the processing, multiple adjacency graphs are computed, and a Level of Detail(LoD) representation of the FEA data is established. At the third stage, the LoD structure is rendered by using a splatting method. At first, a level of adjacency graph is selected by users. The graph vertices are sorted based on their visibility orders and projected onto the image plane in back-to-front order. Billboards are used to render the vertices in the projection. The function values, gradients, and influence scopes of the vertices are utilized to decide the colors, opacities, orientations, and shapes of the billboards. The billboards are then modulated with texture maps to generate the footprints of the vertices. Finally, these footprints are composited to produce the volume rendering image...|$|E

The Principle of Virtual Work was used to derive the differential equation of composite beam.

The derived formulation was validated with previous research work for linear problem and nonlinear problem. The nonlinear geometrical {{are taken into account}} to study the performance of Mfree handling the nonlinear problem and the performances are compared with FEM. The algorithms of the solution procedure for both methods were written in MATLAB.

The parameters considered in this study were the size of support domain, as number of nodes, number of Gauss cell and number of <b>Gauss</b> <b>point.</b> The result of the parametric study showed that five bending nodes and nine axial nodes with as equal to four give the appropriate result considering both accuracy and stability.

40|$|A {{hierarchical}} multiscale {{framework is}} proposed {{to model the}} mechanical behaviour of granular media. The framework employs a rigorous hierarchical coupling between the FEM and the discrete element method (DEM). To solve a BVP, the FEM is used to discretise the macroscopic geometric domain into an FEM mesh. A DEM assembly with memory of its loading history is embedded at each <b>Gauss</b> integration <b>point</b> of the mesh {{to serve as the}} representative volume element (RVE). The DEM assembly receives the global defor-mation at its <b>Gauss</b> <b>point</b> from the FEM as input boundary conditions and is solved to derive the required constitutive relation at the specific material point to advance the FEM computation. The DEM computa-tion employs simple physically based contact laws in conjunction with Coulomb’s friction for interparticle contacts to capture the loading-history dependence and highly nonlinear dissipative response of a granular material. The hierarchical scheme helps to avoid the phenomenological assumptions on constitutive relation in conventional continuum modelling and retains the computational efficiency of FEM in solving large-scale BVPs. The hierarchical structure also makes it ideal for distributed parallel computing to fully unleash its predictive power. Importantly, the framework offers rich information on the particle level with direct link to the macroscopic material response, which helps to shed lights on cross-scale understanding of granular media.
