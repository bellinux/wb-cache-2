Three-dimensional computational models are harnessed to analyze and predict {{the influence of the}} mechanical tabs aspect ratio and number on the mixing characteristics and performance of the <b>gas</b> <b>mixer.</b> Attention is concentrated on the influence of mechanical tabs on the air-fuel ratio, pressure loss and mixing quality. The optimum design of the mechanical tab was realized with aspect ratio of 0. 32 and 4 tabs with 45 o tab angle.

40|$|The {{consumption}} of energy is increasing at staggering rate {{around the globe}} due to a rise in population and its standard of living. The energy is obtained from fossil fuels at the cost global warming. It results several harmful effects for both environmental and human welfare. These impacts can be narrowed down by using alternative renewable energy that is generated from natural resources such as biomass, solar heat and light, wind, rain, tides, waves etc. Dual fuel diesel engines allow the cultivation of alternative fuels for a cleaner combustion. Biogas, a fuel derived from biomass, mainly contains methane (CH 4) along with a certain quantity of carbon dioxide (CO 2). In a dual fuel engine, biogas {{can be used as}} a primary fuel and diesel as a pilot fuel. This requires the necessary modification in the engine that includes the installation of a <b>gas</b> <b>mixer</b> at the inlet manifold of the engine. A properly designed <b>gas</b> <b>mixer</b> for a biogas premixed charge dual fuel engine can result in a proper mixing of biogas with air. This ensures to a better combustion and higher efficiency of the engine. In this paper, the flow behavior in a newly designed <b>gas</b> <b>mixer</b> has been investigated with the help of computational fluid dynamics based software. The contours of pressure, turbulence intensity, velocity and mass fraction of CH 4 obtained are discussed, and compared across an existing design. It is observed that the new design of the mixer promotes a homogenous mixing of biogas with air...|$|E

This sturdy flow board combines ease fabrication, low cost and gas economy.

The LDV was used as an orthogonal, three component system to measure the flow field downstream of the exit of a series of IEGM's and a reference axisymmetric splitter configuration. The LDV system was also used as a one component system to measure the internal axial flow within the nozzle tailpipe downstream of the mixers.

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references (leaves 78 - 83). Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. The efficiency of certain mixing elements in achieving conditions suited for single point sampling is evaluated. Experimental measurements of velocity and tracer gas concentration are taken to determine the same. Readings are taken under conditions of statistically steady developing flow in a straight duct. Mixing is evaluated for inlet intensities of 1. 5 %, 10 % and 20 %, achieved by introducing various bi-plane grids and for a commercial static <b>gas</b> <b>mixer.</b> Reynolds number is varied between 5000 and 16000 and has negligible effect on mixing. The obtained data highlighted the importance of inlet turbulence intensity over Reynolds number in the process of turbulent dispersion of a dilute gas. All mixing data are obtained for Reynolds number around 15000. A semi-empirical correlation to predict the extent of mixing, as characterized by the Coefficient of Variation (COV) over a U. S. EPA sampling grid, with a given turbulent intensity profile is proposed and its results match favorably with the data. The correlation incorporates the idea of a history of intensity influencing the mixing at any downstream point and is much better than an earlier correlation which failed to incorporate the history of fluctuations. It could be included as a sub-model in software like DEPOSITION. Experiments with the commercial static <b>gas</b> <b>mixer</b> show that, unlike the bi-plane grids, the turbulence downstream of the mixer is not homogenous. The results showed enhanced mixing that attained the specified ANSI N 13. 1 1999 criteria rapidly and selection of the release point for tracer gas plays a significant role in determining the extent of mixing. The <b>gas</b> <b>mixer</b> does not introduce significant pressure losses. It is also seen that while flow straighteners reduce flow swirl, they may not be effective for achieving a uniform velocity profile. Numerical computations are performed with commercially available computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software (FLUENT[], Version 5. 4), and the performance of the turbulence and particle tracking models is evaluated. Flow field predictions match favorably with experimental data.

The size of intake air passage, the number and size of the radial holes and tubes varies to achieve adequate gas or air mixing for the particular engine. Measurement of air flow necessary for engine operation is the selection criteria of mixers. The power obtained from engine is dependent {{on the size of the}} mixer. It can be seen from the experimental result that a smaller mixer caused higher pressure at the throat in compare to the analytical result. High pressure caused low velocity at the throat.

40|$|A <b>gas</b> <b>mixer</b> {{prototype}} {{is developed}} for mixing air and synthesis gas or “syngas” as a fuel. Syngas is being {{recognized as a}} viable energy source worldwide, particularly for stationary power generation. Syngas has a very low energy density, so a mixer with λ (ratio of actual to stoichiometric air-fuel ratio) {{in the range of}} 1. 1 to 1. 7 is expected. In this study, three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling is used to design venturi mixer, coaxial mixer and coaxial mixer with vortex generator. CFD modeling is used to investigate and analyze the influence of the throat diameter, gas chamber thickness and gas exits diameter on mixer characteristics and performance of the venturi mixer. While on the coaxial mixer model, CFD is used to analyze the influences of the primary nozzle exit diameter, constant pressure mixing chamber geometry, constant area mixing chamber geometry, divergent passage geometry, syngas inlet position and primary nozzle exit position on the coaxial mixer characteristics and performance. To design appropriate vortex generator, computational models are used to analyze the influence of the mechanical tab angle, number of tabs and geometry on the mixing characteristics and performance of the coaxial mixer. Attention is focused on the effect of mixers and vortex generator tabs geometry on the air-fuel ratio, pressure loss and mixing quality. Based on the numerical results, an optimized design of venturi <b>gas</b> <b>mixer,</b> coaxial mixer and vortex generator is decided and made. The optimized design of the venturi mixer has λ in the range of 1. 2 to 1. 3, good mixing quality and pressure loss of 46 Pa on air flow rate 100 m 3 /h. The optimized design of the coaxial mixer has λ ranging from 1. 1 to 1. 7 corresponding to pressure losses from 28 to 19 Pa at 100 m 3 /h air-flow rate.

At λ about 1. 2 and 100 m 3 /h air flow rate, the mixing quality of the optimized venturi mixer, coaxial mixer and coaxial mixer equipped with vortex generator have coefficient of variation (CoV) of 0. 67, 0. 88 and 0. 29 respectively...|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} dough {{aeration}} on measured bulk rheology of dough were investigated by preparing doughs with various gas contents and assessing their rheology under large deformation biaxial extension using the SMS Dough Inflation System. Doughs were mixed to various gas contents using a laboratory-scale mixer, the Tweedy 1, at various mixer headspace pressures. In order {{to consider the}} effect of oxidation processes, doughs were mixed in air, in nitrogen and in a controlled oxygen-nitrogen atmosphere in which the partial pressure of oxygen was kept constant. In the latter two cases a flow rate of <b>gas</b> through the <b>mixer</b> was maintained, while the doughs mixed in air had a static headspace. Dough aeration was quantified using density measurements. The dough rheology tests were performed under two different modes: constant volumetric air flow rate; and constant strain rate at two levels, 0. 1 and 0. 05 s− 1. Analysis of the stress–strain data of an inflating dough bubble using an exponential model enabled the strain hardening index, failure strain and failure stress to be determined. The strain hardening index, failure strain and failure stress decreased with gas content, indicating that gas bubbles in dough disrupt the integrity of dough structure. The faster strain rate tended to give higher values of all parameters and to be more discriminating, while testing at a constant volumetric air flow rate gave lower values. Doughs mixed under a constant partial pressure of oxygen resulted in the strain hardening index being minimally affected by the gas content, although failure strain and failure stress decreased with increasing gas content in the dough. The flow of <b>gas</b> through the <b>mixer</b> appeared to affect dough aeration and rheology, {{and the rate of}} work input was found to increase with increasing mixer headspace pressures. These suggest that dough aeration not only affects the rheology of static dough through the physical presence of gas bubbles following mixing, it also affects the development of its rheological properties within the mixer, through the physical presence of the bubbles affecting the rate of work input that develops the doughs, and also through the turnover of air that supplies oxygen to facilitate this development...|$|R

30|$|Oxygenator: {{there are}} two types of oxygenator; bubble oxygenators, which are used for {{perioperative}} extracorporeal circulation during heart surgery, and membrane oxygenators, which avoid hemolysis associated with bubbling [25, 26]. Only membrane oxygenators are used for peripheral ECMO. There are two types of membrane: flat and tubular [28]. The former have flat silicone membranes or membranes assembled in layers. Oxygenators with tubular membranes comprising nonporous hollow fibers generally made of polymethylpentene avoid loss of plasma components. The oxygenator should be located downstream of the pump and permit gas exchange by artificially reproducing the function of the alveolar capillary membrane. It also ensures heat exchange and warms the blood of the extracorporeal circuit [25]. It has an inlet and an outlet and is connected to a <b>gas</b> <b>mixer,</b> which is used to adjust the oxygen fraction delivered by the extracorporeal circuit (FECO 2) and the gas flow (sweep gas rate). Oxygenators are tested for measurement of pressure as a function of flow rates. The pressure gradient generated by the passage of the blood through the oxygenator should be lower than 50  mmHg/L/minute. The pressure drop corresponds to the transmembrane pressure gradient. Treatment goals distinguish oxygenation and decarboxylation. Membrane performance is evaluated by the rated flow of the oxygenator which corresponds to the amount of desaturated (75 %) venous blood that can be nearly fully saturated (95 %) in a given time. The flow rate is adjusted to that of the assist system. Most oxygenators support sweep flow rates of 10  mL/minute to 100  L/minute [25]. The oxygenator should be placed below the level of the patient. The gas outlet port should be directed downwards to limit the risk of obstruction [25].|$|E
40|$|SummaryObjectiveTo {{examine the}} effect of O 2 and the role, and source, of {{reactive}} oxygen species (ROS) on pH regulation in articular chondrocytes. MethodsCartilage from equine metacarpo/tarsophalangeal joints was digested (collagenase) to isolate chondrocytes and loaded with 2 ′, 7 ′-bis- 2 -(carboxyethyl) - 5 (6) -carboxylfluorescein, a pH-sensitive fluorophore. O 2 tension was maintained using Eschweiler tonometers and a Wosthoff <b>gas</b> <b>mixer.</b> Cells were exposed to agents which alter ROS levels, mitochondrial inhibitors and/or inhibitors of protein phosphorylation. ROS levels were determined by dichlorofluorescein and mitochondrial membrane potential measured using JC- 1. ResultspH homeostasis was dependent on ROS. Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE) activity was inhibited at low O 2 tension (acid efflux reducing from 2. 30 ± 0. 05 to 1. 27 ± 0. 11 mMmin− 1 at 1 %). NHE activity correlated with ROS levels (r 2 = 0. 65). ROS levels were increased by antimycin A (with levels at 1 % O 2 tension increasing from 59 ± 9 % of the value at 20 % to 87 ± 7 %), but reduced by rotenone, myxothiazol and diphenyleneiodonium. Hypoxia induced depolarisation of the mitochondrial membrane potential (with JC- 1 red–green fluorescence ratio at 1 % O 2 tension decreasing to 40 ± 10 % of the value at 20 %). The response to changes in O 2 and to antimycin A was inhibited by staurosporine, wortmanin and calyculin A. ConclusionThe fall in ROS levels in hypoxia reduces the ability of articular chondrocytes to regulate pH, inhibiting NHE activity via changes in protein phosphorylation. The site of ROS generation is likely to be mitochondrial electron transport chain complex III. These effects are important to understanding normal chondrocyte function and response to altered O 2 tension...|$|E

40|$|The young {{field of}} {{microfluidics}} {{has been growing}} due to its utility in chemical and biological applications. Microfluidic devices can be rapidly and inexpensively fabricated from silicone elastomers, making them ideal for prototyping and subsequent production. Further, the behavior of fluid flows in micrometer-diameter channels can be accurately predicted - due to the properties of laminar flow and purely diffusive mixing - decreasing experimental uncertainties, while allowing access {{to a wide range}} of experiments impossible with traditional methods. The projects presented here fall into two separate areas of biophysics, although they are all facilitated by microfluidics. Chapter 2 deals with the control of the gas content in the medium of cell cultures. This is an important consideration, as the oxygen concentration, [O₂], available to cells has been shown to affect their metabolism, growth, and gene expression. The first project is a microfluidic chemostat supplying nine different [O₂] to bacteria growing in chambers beneath the gas channels. Here, we compared the growth rates of E. coli growing at nine different [O₂] simultaneously. Section 2. 2 introduces a multi-channel, computer- controlled <b>gas</b> <b>mixer</b> that can provide up to ten arbitrary gas mixtures to a microfluidic device. Finally, Section 2. 3 describes gas control strips for use with mammalian cell cultures in standard multiwell culture plates.

40|$|Anaesthesia {{devices are}} a {{critical}} part of the medical equipment in any hospital. Safe operation of these devices is of the highest importance to the lives of the patients. To ensure this, the device has to detect when a component is malfunctioning. During development, the device is tested to insure that possible errors are detected, reported and that the device reacts properly. This thesis was performed at Dräger Medical, in Lübeck, Germany, to analyze and attempt to improve the development of anaesthesia devices. In the anaesthesia device, the <b>gas</b> <b>mixer</b> unit consists of several valves and pressure sensors whose function is to deliver the correct gas mixture to the patient. To verify that any malfunctions in the components are detected correctly, errors are simulated in a laboratory setting. This simulation of malfunctioning valves and pressure sensors is currently done manually at Dräger Medical. This manual procedure is very time-intensive, and limited in terms of complexity and the accuracy. To reliably and cost-effectively test for errors, an automated test procedure would be preferred. Such a procedure is able to perform complex test during extended periods of time. The repeatability and the accuracy can also be higher. A new approach using a computer that controls the simulation hardware was developed. The hardware {{needs to be able to}} manipulate the valves and pressure sensors in the mixer and accept commands from a computer to facilitate complex automatic testing. For this purpose, a 32 -bit microcontroller with appropriate connectivity was chosen. For sensor manipulation, several modules controlled by the microcontroller were designed and assembled. For communicating with the microcontroller, a graphical user interface was designed in LabVIEW. This offers the operator full manual control over the simulation hardware as well as the possibility to automate the testing procedure through the use of scripts.
