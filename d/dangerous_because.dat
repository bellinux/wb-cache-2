5|$|Tests {{have shown}} that all divers are {{affected}} by nitrogen narcosis, though some experience lesser effects than others. Even though {{it is possible that}} some divers can manage better than others because of learning to cope with the subjective impairment, the underlying behavioral effects remain. These effects are particularly <b>dangerous</b> <b>because</b> a diver may feel they are not experiencing narcosis, yet still be affected by it.|$|E
5|$|Traversing a {{crossroads}} at night was considered <b>dangerous</b> <b>because</b> {{it was the}} place and time of the ala’s supper; the unfortunate person who stepped on an “ala’s table” could become blind, deaf, or lame. Ale gather at night on the eves of greater holidays, divert men from their ways into gullies, and torture them there by riding them like horses.|$|E
5|$|Meth {{mouth is}} very {{difficult}} to treat unless the patient stops using methamphetamine; persistent drug use makes changes in hygiene or nutrition practices unlikely. Many drug users lack access to dental treatment, and few are willing to participate in such a course of action, often because of poverty. Those who are willing to seek dental treatment often resist discussing their drug use. Providing dental treatment to individuals who use methamphetamine can also be <b>dangerous,</b> <b>because</b> the potential combination of local anesthetic and methamphetamine can cause serious heart problems. There is also an increased risk of serious side effects if opioid medications are used in the patient's treatment.|$|E
50|$|A {{product that}} is not a safe product is a {{dangerous}} product. A product is not <b>dangerous</b> solely <b>because</b> other products are safer or it was feasible to make the product itself safer (reg.2).|$|R
50|$|In 2006, {{conservative}} author David Horowitz listed her among America's 100 most <b>dangerous</b> professors <b>because</b> of {{her strong}} voice on {{social justice and}} human rights. She died at a Skokie, Illinois hospice in 2012.|$|R
50|$|Like {{many other}} tunnels in Norway, the Ryggedal Tunnel has {{condensation}} problems. Condensation {{can lead to}} <b>dangerous</b> situations <b>because</b> the pavement suddenly becomes damp when entering the tunnel. The tunnel's infrastructure was upgraded in 2015.|$|R
5|$|Potassium is an {{extremely}} active metal that reacts violently with oxygen in water and air. With oxygen it forms potassium peroxide, and with water potassium forms potassium hydroxide. The reaction of potassium with water is <b>dangerous</b> <b>because</b> of its violent exothermic character {{and the production of}} hydrogen gas. Hydrogen reacts again with atmospheric oxygen, producing water, which reacts with the remaining potassium. This reaction requires only traces of water; because of this, potassium and the liquid sodium-potassium — NaK — are potent desiccants {{that can be used to}} dry solvents prior to distillation.|$|E
5|$|As Apollo 17 was {{the final}} lunar mission of the Apollo program, several {{different}} scientific objectives were identified {{in order to maximize}} the scientific productivity of the mission. Landing sites considered for previous missions, but were rejected were reconsidered. Taurus–Littrow was one of several potential landing sites considered for Apollo 17 along with Tycho crater, Copernicus crater, Tsiolkovskiy crater on the far side, among others. All but Taurus–Littrow were eventually eliminated for scientific and/or operational reasons. A landing at Tycho was thought to be too <b>dangerous</b> <b>because</b> of the rough terrain found there, a landing on the far side in Tsiolkovskiy would add the expense of communications satellites necessary to maintain contact between the crew and ground control during surface operations, and a landing in Copernicus was regarded as low priority.|$|E
5|$|Cersei Lannister {{meets with}} Tommen Baratheon, who {{brings up the}} High Sparrow. Tommen is {{reluctant}} to provoke him, but Cersei says he is <b>dangerous</b> <b>because</b> he has no respect for the Crown. Tommen tells Cersei that Margaery's walk of atonement will happen soon. Cersei relays the information to Kevan Lannister and Olenna Tyrell in the Small Council chamber. Tyrell is horrified and pledges her army to defeat the Sparrows. Kevan has been ordered not to attack by Tommen, but agrees to stand down his army after Cersei says that by destroying the Sparrows he can have back his son Lancel, who {{is part of the}} order, and that Tommen will forgive him when he has Margaery back.|$|E

5|$|Men were lowered by bucket {{down the}} airshafts to dig by candlelight. They were paid £1.50 per week to shovel 20 tons (20.32 tonnes) {{of rock and}} earth per 12–hour shift, seven days a week. Conditions were {{constantly}} wet, with foul air and gunpowder fumes and the danger of roof–collapse. The tunnel cuts through hard sandstone, shale and clay, and there are seven major faults in the rock near the centre point. The work was <b>dangerous</b> <b>because</b> the rock at the Horsforth end was difficult to blast, and there was frequent flooding and subsidence. About 1,563,480,000 gallons (7,107,580,080 litres) of water were pumped out of the workings between 1845 and 1849. Metal sheets had {{to be used to}} divert water inside the tunnel.|$|E

25|$|Liquid ammonia is <b>dangerous</b> <b>because</b> it is {{hygroscopic}} {{and because}} it can freeze flesh. See Gas carrier#Health effects of specific cargoes carried on gas carriers for more information.|$|E
30|$|OGC {{compliant}} implementations may silently ignore certain coverage parts. This is {{the most}} <b>dangerous</b> situation <b>because</b> wrong results can be generated and go unnoticed as both service providers and clients expect tools to work, based on OGC compliance tests passed.|$|R
5000|$|... motorists who {{cannot be}} prosecuted for <b>dangerous</b> driving <b>because</b> they were driving {{elsewhere}} than on a road or public place, or {{because they were not}} warned that prosecution was intended pursuant to section 1 of the Road Traffic Offenders Act 1988 ...|$|R

25|$|Preparation of {{solutions}} greater than 6M (35%) in concentration is most <b>dangerous,</b> <b>because</b> the heat produced may {{be sufficient to}} boil the diluted acid: efficient mechanical stirring and external cooling (such as an ice bath) are essential.|$|E
25|$|Grizzly {{bears are}} {{especially}} <b>dangerous</b> <b>because</b> {{of the force}} of their bite, which has been measured at over 8 megapascals (1160 psi). It {{has been estimated that}} a bite from a grizzly could even crush a bowling ball.|$|E
25|$|Table saws are {{especially}} <b>dangerous,</b> <b>because</b> the operator holds the material being cut, {{instead of the}} saw, {{making it easy to}} accidentally move hands into the spinning blade. In contrast, with other types of circular saws, the material remains stationary, as the operator guides the saw into the material.|$|E
2500|$|Dangerous Reading: {{reading was}} seen as a <b>dangerous</b> pursuit <b>because</b> it was {{considered}} rebellious and unsociable {{especially in the case of}} women, because reading could stir up dangerous emotions such as love and that if women could read, they could read love notes ...|$|R
50|$|Leone {{was sentenced}} to 18 years in prison in April 2008, with {{eligibility}} for parole in six years. The judge said {{he was unable to}} designate him a <b>dangerous</b> offender <b>because</b> there was insufficient evidence that he would commit similar offences if released.|$|R

25|$|The water {{reservoirs}} of the Dnieper River in Ukraine pose {{a significant}} {{threat of a}} large-scale human-made disaster if their dams fail. Such a threat is typical for reservoir dams; however, the Dnieper reservoirs are especially <b>dangerous</b> <b>because</b> of the geographical conditions, {{as well as the}} consequences of the Chernobyl disaster and other nuclear-related environmental threats in the region.|$|E

25|$|Passive noise {{canceling}} headphones can {{be considered}} <b>dangerous</b> <b>because</b> {{of a lack of}} awareness the listener may have with their environment. Noise cancelling headphones are so effective that a person {{may not be able to}} hear oncoming traffic or pay attention to people around them. There is also a general danger that music in headphones can distract the listener and lead to dangerous situations.|$|E

25|$|Dioxins {{accumulate}} in food chains {{in a fashion}} similar to other chlorinated compounds (bioaccumulation). This means that even small concentrations in contaminated water can be concentrated up a food chain to <b>dangerous</b> levels <b>because</b> of the long biological half life and low water solubility of dioxins.|$|R
50|$|Dickson McCunn: an {{affluent}} retired grocer, whose unostentatious and dour but stubborn and determined nature {{makes him a}} surprising hero. Dickson McCunn is formidable and <b>dangerous</b> partly <b>because</b> he seems unremarkable and ordinary, and friends and enemies alike are taken by surprise when he acts boldly.|$|R
25|$|Helping Jews was {{extremely}} <b>dangerous</b> <b>because</b> people involved exposed {{themselves and their}} families to a Nazi punishment by death. The official policies of the Polish government in exile and the Polish Underground State called for providing assistance to the Jews. Right-wing organizations such as the National Radical Camp (ONR) and the National Armed Forces (NSZ) remained virulently antisemitic throughout the occupation period and some people preyed on the Jewish victims.|$|E
25|$|The shot {{tends to}} be used only in the late stages of limited overs matches, due to the {{favourable}} field settings. The region behind the wicket {{tends to be}} more lightly patrolled by fielders at that phase of the game, so the risk-benefit status of the shot is more relatively favourable to the batsman. It is also physically <b>dangerous</b> <b>because</b> an incorrectly deflected or missed ball can hit the batsman in the head.|$|E
25|$|In 1965, the St Helen's House {{building}} was declared <b>dangerous</b> <b>because</b> of falling tiles and masonry. The school {{moved to a}} new site on Moorway Lane, Littleover, in 1966. In 2006 Richard Blunt was granted a 299-year leasehold on the House by Derby City Council. Plans to convert the building into a hotel were scrapped following the economic downturn and the house was converted into offices instead, the first company taking possession in 2013.|$|E
