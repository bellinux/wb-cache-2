25|$|Supportive {{psychotherapy}} is {{also used}} in an inpatient or outpatient setting by a trained professional that focuses on areas such as coping skills, improvement of social skills and social interactions, communication, and self-esteem issues. People with SPD {{have a tendency to}} miss differences that causes an inability to pick up environmental cues and limits their experience. The perception of varied events only increases their fear for intimacy and limits them in their interpersonal relationships. Their aloofness may limit their opportunities to refine the social skills and behavior necessary to effectively pursue relationships. Socialization groups may <b>help</b> <b>people</b> <b>with</b> SPD. Educational strategies in which people who have SPD identify their positive and negative emotions also may be effective. Such identification helps them to learn about their own emotions and the emotions they draw out from others and to feel the common emotions with other people with whom they relate. This can <b>help</b> <b>people</b> <b>with</b> SPD create empathy with the outside world.|$|E

25|$|Melodic {{intonation}} therapy (MIT) is {{method used}} by music therapists and speech-language pathologists to <b>help</b> <b>people</b> <b>with</b> communication disorders caused by {{damage to the}} left hemisphere of the brain by engaging the singing abilities and possibly engaging language-capable regions in the undamaged right hemisphere. In MIT common words and phrases are turned into melodic phrases, generally starting with two step sing-song patterns and eventually emulating typical speech intonation and rhythmic patterns.|$|E
25|$|Changes in the {{schedule}} or environment, delusions, hallucinations, misperceptions, and sleep problems also may trigger behavior changes. It can <b>help</b> <b>people</b> <b>with</b> DLB to encourage exercise, simplify the visual environment, {{stick to a}} routine, and avoid asking too much (or too little) of them. Speaking slowly and sticking to essential information improves communication. The potential for visual misperception and hallucinations, {{in addition to the}} risk of abrupt and dramatic swings in cognition and motor impairment, should put families on alert to the dangers of driving with DLB.|$|E
25|$|Counseling psychologists {{study and}} use {{many of the}} same {{interventions}} and tools as clinical psychologists, including psychotherapy and assessment. Traditionally, counseling psychologists <b>help</b> <b>people</b> <b>with</b> what might be considered normal or moderate psychological problems—such as the feelings of anxiety or sadness resulting from major life changes or events. Many counseling psychologists also receive specialized training in career assessment, group therapy, and relationship counseling, although some counseling psychologists also work with the more serious problems that clinical psychologists are trained for, such as dementia or psychosis.|$|E

25|$|Many {{people with}} anxiety {{disorders}} benefit from joining a self-help or support group (telephone conference-call support groups or online support groups being of particular help for completely housebound individuals). Sharing problems and achievements with others, {{as well as}} sharing various self-help tools, are common activities in these groups. In particular, stress management techniques and various kinds of meditation practices and visualization techniques can <b>help</b> <b>people</b> <b>with</b> anxiety disorders calm themselves and may enhance the effects of therapy, as can service to others, which can distract from the self-absorption that tends to go with anxiety problems. Also, preliminary evidence suggests aerobic exercise may have a calming effect. Since caffeine, certain illicit drugs, and even some over-the-counter cold medications can aggravate the symptoms of anxiety disorders, they should be avoided.|$|E
25|$|Melodic Intonation Therapy is used {{to treat}} non-fluent aphasia and {{has proved to be}} {{effective}} in some cases. However, there is still no evidence from randomized controlled trials confirming the efficacy of MIT in chronic aphasia. MIT {{is used to}} <b>help</b> <b>people</b> <b>with</b> aphasia vocalize themselves through speech song, which is then transferred as a spoken word. Good candidates for this therapy include left hemisphere stroke patients, non-fluent aphasias such as Broca's, good auditory comprehension, poor repetition and articulation, and good emotional stability and memory. It has been hypothesized that MIT is effective because prosody and singing both rely on areas of the right hemisphere; it may be these right-hemisphere areas that are recruited for natural speech production after intensive training. An alternative explanation is that the efficacy of MIT depends on neural circuits involved in the processing of rhythmicity and formulaic expressions (examples taken from the MIT manual: “I am fine,” “how are you?” or “thank you”); while rhythmic features associated with melodic intonation may engage primarily left-hemisphere subcortical areas of the brain, the use of formulaic expressions is known to be supported by right-hemisphere cortical and bilateral subcortical neural networks.|$|E
