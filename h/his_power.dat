5|$|In January 1964, General Khánh ousted General Dương Văn Minh as {{the leader}} of South Vietnam's {{military}} junta in a bloodless coup. Although Khánh had made considerable efforts to consolidate <b>his</b> <b>power,</b> opposition to his rule began to grow as he tightened censorship laws, banned protests and allowed police arbitrary search and imprisonment powers. Khánh drafted a new constitution, which would have expanded <b>his</b> <b>power</b> within the military junta. In response to General Khánh's political manoeuvres the South Vietnamese people, predominately Buddhists, held large demonstrations in the cities calling {{for an end to the}} draconian laws which had limited the people’s political freedom. Fearing that <b>his</b> <b>power</b> could be weakened by those demonstrations, General Khánh immediately repealed his constitution and new police powers. He promised to reinstate civilian rule and remove members of the Catholic-based Cần lao from power.|$|E
5|$|Pain {{consolidated}} much of <b>his</b> <b>power</b> in Shropshire and Herefordshire at Bridgnorth Castle, often {{using that}} site {{as a place}} of business in preference to Shrewsbury, which had previously been the main centre of business for his predecessors as sheriff. As well as Waleran, Pain imprisoned a Welsh hostage there in 1128, Llywelyn ab Owain, the nephew of Maredudd ap Bleddyn, ruler of the Welsh principality of Powys. Besides Bridgnorth, Pain used his possession of Ludlow Castle to consolidate <b>his</b> <b>power</b> in the Welsh Marches. During Henry's reign, the Welsh border was a zone of frequent raids and conflict between the Anglo-Normans and the Welsh.|$|E
50|$|Long ago, Ringmaster {{was once}} a genie, but he used <b>his</b> <b>powers</b> only for himself, not to grant wishes to humans, so the other genies decided to strip him of <b>his</b> <b>powers.</b> He was still immortal, however, and still possessed great {{strength}} and knowledge. He vowed to regain <b>his</b> <b>powers</b> someday and get his revenge.|$|R
5000|$|Shaktimaan's {{powers are}} {{virtually}} limitless. He can do practically anything he imagines. The only limit to <b>his</b> <b>powers</b> is <b>his</b> own belief in {{himself and his}} {{knowledge of how to}} manifest <b>his</b> <b>powers.</b> <b>His</b> <b>powers</b> come from <b>his</b> chakras. (Note: Although we’ll call them chakras in the vedas, in the series dialogue they will also be called energy centers.) ...|$|R
50|$|Originally, Doctor Light derives <b>his</b> <b>powers</b> from <b>his</b> suit, {{but over}} time he internalizes this ability, and could use <b>his</b> <b>powers</b> without having to use his costume.|$|R
5|$|The country became {{divided between}} Saif bin Sultan II {{and his cousin}} Bal'arab bin Himyar, rival Imams. Finding <b>his</b> <b>power</b> dwindling, Saif bin Sultan II asked for help from Nader Shah of Persia.|$|E
5|$|After {{locating}} the Temple of Persephone and confronting the Queen of the Underworld, Kratos {{is given a}} choice: renounce <b>his</b> <b>power</b> and be with his deceased daughter (at a cost to mankind) or proceed with his mission. Kratos sacrifices his weapons and power {{to be reunited with}} his daughter, but discovers that Persephone is embittered by Zeus' betrayal and her imprisonment in the Underworld with her husband Hades. While he was distracted by his reunion with Calliope, Persephone's ally Atlas was using the power of the kidnapped Helios to destroy the Pillar of the World, which would also end Olympus. Choosing to abandon Calliope forever, Kratos takes back <b>his</b> <b>power</b> and binds Atlas to the Pillar of the World he sought to destroy, forcing the Titan to hold {{the weight of the world}} on his shoulders. Kratos then battles Persephone to the death. Although victorious, he is warned by a dying Persephone that his suffering will never end. Atlas also warns Kratos that he will eventually regret helping the gods and that he and Atlas will meet again. Kratos then rides the Sun Chariot back to the mortal world and into the sky as Morpheus retreats.|$|E
5|$|Also at Royal Rumble 1995, The Undertaker faced Irwin R. Schyster {{as part of}} The Undertaker's {{feud with}} Ted DiBiase's Million Dollar Corporation. During the match, King Kong Bundy, another Corporation member, {{interfered}} and enabled the Corporation to steal The Undertaker's urn, which {{was said to be}} the source of <b>his</b> <b>power.</b>|$|E
50|$|Protoplasman is the comic-relief superhero of the Big Bang world, {{who works}} closely with Knight Watchman either as a partner or as an assistant. Although <b>his</b> <b>powers</b> are {{sometimes}} described as elasticity, {{that appears to be}} false information. When using <b>his</b> <b>powers,</b> Protoplasman seems to take on a liquid-like form, suggesting that <b>his</b> <b>powers</b> are derived from fluidity, rather than elasticity.|$|R
50|$|Ultiman {{must also}} {{recharge}} <b>his</b> <b>powers</b> from a meteorite. Repeated exposures appear to slowly poison him, {{causing him to}} experience steadily more severe symptoms each time before recovering with <b>his</b> <b>powers</b> restored.|$|R
5000|$|In [...] "Brave New World," [...] Hiro tests <b>his</b> <b>powers</b> {{out after}} <b>his</b> brain tumor is removed and learns that {{removing}} the brain tumor has restored full control over <b>his</b> <b>powers</b> to Hiro. Hiro is easily able to teleport himself and Ando to Central Park where the Carnival is with no issues. There, Hiro {{is asked to}} teleport over a dozen people away from the Carnival. Hiro has everyone hold hands and manages to succeed in teleporting everyone thanks to Ando supercharging <b>his</b> <b>powers</b> which give him the boost to <b>his</b> <b>powers</b> he needs to teleport such {{a large group of}} people.|$|R
5|$|Also in 1404, Władysław held {{talks at}} Vratislav with Wenceslaus IV of Bohemia, who offered to return Silesia to Poland if Władysław {{supported}} him in <b>his</b> <b>power</b> struggle within the Holy Roman Empire.

5|$|As Zahir {{consolidated}} <b>his</b> <b>power</b> {{and reduced}} external threats to his {{rule in the}} 1760s, his sons aspired for more influence and ultimately fought against their father and each other {{in order to secure}} their place as Zahir's successor. Besides support from elements of the Zaydani clan, Zahir's sons maintained their own power bases, largely derived from their mothers' clans, and also made their own alliances with other powerful actors in the region. Zahir was victorious in the many conflicts he had with his sons, but their frequent dissent weakened his rule and played a contributory role to his downfall in 1775. Prior to his sons' individual rebellions, Zahir had eliminated other relatives who challenged <b>his</b> <b>power.</b>|$|E
5|$|Charon– The former ferryman of the River Styx in the Underworld who guided {{lost souls}} to their final destination. Kratos {{encountered}} Charon on the River Styx twice.

The character was voiced by Dwight Schultz in Chains of Olympus.|$|E
50|$|Bouncing Boy lost <b>his</b> <b>powers</b> for a {{short period}} of time after he accidentally bounced into a matter-shrinking facility.

He later regained <b>his</b> <b>powers</b> after the formula which originally gave him <b>his</b> <b>powers</b> was recreated for him in Adventure #351 (1966). He then re-joined the Legion of Super-Heroes.|$|R
50|$|Kenuichio Harada is the illegitimate son of Shingen Yashida. He is a Japanese mutant {{who uses}} <b>his</b> <b>powers</b> to charge <b>his</b> katana. <b>His</b> <b>powers</b> and <b>his</b> samurai-style armor {{made of a}} silvery metal led to the moniker Silver Samurai.|$|R
50|$|In {{the wake}} of M-Day—an event in which a mentally ill Scarlet Witch depowered over 90% of the mutant population, Shatter {{was one of the}} many who lost <b>his</b> <b>powers.</b> The {{energies}} of <b>his</b> <b>powers</b> were detected in The Collective.|$|R
5|$|Domesday {{makes it}} obvious that Urse {{was the most}} {{powerful}} layman in Worcester, and {{the only person who}} could contest <b>his</b> <b>power</b> in the county was the Bishop of Worcester. The power struggle continued into the 12th century, as Urse's descendants still contested the bishops. Only one other layman is recorded as having a castle in Worcestershire in Domesday, and he held much less land than Urse.|$|E
5|$|Following Llywelyn's {{death in}} 1240, Gwynedd's power {{declined}} {{and many of}} its eastern lands were taken by Henry III of England in 1247. Llywelyn's grandson, Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, took power in 1255 and imprisoned his brother Owain ap Gruffudd before extending <b>his</b> <b>power</b> across Wales. Llywelyn extended the castle with an additional tower to the south, similar to that built at Dolforwyn, probably in order to provide additional accommodation.|$|E
5|$|Following {{problems}} with <b>his</b> <b>power</b> unit {{in both the}} Chinese and Russian Grand Prix, Lewis Hamilton received a redesigned MGU-H unit, {{in a bid to}} solve the troubles which hampered him earlier. However, Mercedes were unable to guarantee that the problem would not appear again.|$|E
50|$|Baldwin's {{powers are}} {{constantly}} evolving and <b>his</b> original Speedball <b>powers</b> are {{shown to be}} returning to him. Robbie no longer needs the Penance suit to activate <b>his</b> <b>powers</b> but chose to wear it for a time to help remedy the guilt he feels, {{as well as for}} the benefits to <b>his</b> <b>powers.</b>|$|R
50|$|Alex {{was later}} {{captured}} by Larry Trask and his Sentinels, who were bent on controlling or eradicating all mutants. Trask fashioned a costume for Alex {{that would help}} him control <b>his</b> <b>powers</b> and Alex was given the code name Havok. Trask {{turned out to be}} a mutant himself and the Sentinels were defeated by the X-Men. Havok lost control of <b>his</b> <b>powers,</b> however, and <b>his</b> excess energy was absorbed by Sauron. Havok then gained control of <b>his</b> <b>powers.</b>|$|R
5000|$|After {{learning}} how to astral project, Barbas manipulates Cole Turner into getting rid of <b>his</b> <b>powers.</b> After taking <b>his</b> <b>powers</b> Barbas is once again free from Purgatory.

5|$|Historian Thomas Vogel opines that Rommel {{was not a}} Nazi, if {{one uses}} the {{definition}} the Nazis themselves used, considering that although he did everything in <b>his</b> <b>power</b> to make his country strong again, he showed no support towards the racial policies or {{other aspects of the}} regime.|$|E
5|$|In 491 BC, Darius sent emissaries {{to all the}} Greek city-states, {{asking for}} a gift of 'earth and water' in token of their {{submission}} to him. Having had a demonstration of <b>his</b> <b>power</b> the previous year, the majority of Greek cities duly obliged. In Athens, however, the ambassadors were put on trial and then executed; in Sparta, they were simply thrown down a well. This meant that Sparta was also now effectively at war with Persia.|$|E
5|$|In 997, at a royal meeting near Clonfert, Brian Boru, King of Munster, {{met with}} his long-time rival Máel Sechnaill mac Domnaill, {{who was at the}} time High King of Ireland. Although the idea of the high-kingship is {{considered}} mainly an anachronistic invention, it came into vogue in the 10th century to denote a king who had enforced <b>his</b> <b>power</b> over external territories. Máel Sechnaill assumed the Irish high-kingship after the Battle of Tara in 980.|$|E
50|$|According to Lakota belief, Inyan, the Rock, {{was present}} at the very beginning, and so was the omnipresent spirit Wakan Tanka, the Great Mystery, and the {{darkness}} Han. Inyan wanted to exercise <b>his</b> <b>powers,</b> or compassion, so he created Maka (the Earth) as part of himself to keep control of <b>his</b> <b>powers.</b> But he sacrificed much of his blood by doing so, which became water, and he shriveled up, became hard, and begins losing <b>his</b> <b>powers.</b> The water cannot retain <b>his</b> <b>powers,</b> and Skan was created. Maka complains to Inyan that everything is cold and dark, and so he creates Anpao, the Dawn. As Anpao's red light was not enough for Maka, Inyan creates Wi, the Sun.|$|R
50|$|Chlorophyll Kid {{can stimulate}} plant growth. After the {{accident}} {{he is to}} be able to mold and weave plants to his liking.

5|$|Monmouth was {{executed}} for treason on 15 July 1685. Many {{of his supporters}} were tried during the Bloody Assizes, led by Judge Jeffreys, and were condemned to death or transportation.

50|$|Some years later, Brain Storm {{turned up}} again, this time {{without the benefit}} of <b>his</b> <b>powers.</b> He kidnapped the Terrorsmith in the hopes of using <b>his</b> <b>powers</b> to reactivate <b>his</b> own lost abilities.
