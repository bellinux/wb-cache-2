5|$|Designs for {{the asylum}} {{departed}} from comic interpretations {{of a large}} mansion and instead developed an entire island, with hints of Alcatraz prison, composed of multiple buildings to allow for greater variety and exploration. Each building was designed with a different architectural style to make the facility appear believable and to imbue each location with a history. The medical building was inspired by Victorian architecture and its metalwork structure was intended to inspire feelings of horror. The <b>intensive</b> <b>treatment</b> unit has a Gothic, industrial aesthetic. The catacombs beneath the facility, inspired by early twentieth-century brickwork and Victorian industry, were meant to feel oppressive. The maximum security area was designed to feel claustrophobic and was retrofitted like a bunker, and the Arkham mansion displays a High Gothic style. The designers integrated crooked lines into environmental objects, such as trees and drainpipes, where possible. 40 rooms, 34 corridors, 3 exterior areas, and 3 Scarecrow-induced hallucination areas were designed for the game.|$|E

40|$|This TIP, Substance Abuse: Clinical Issues in <b>Intensive</b> Outpatient <b>Treatment,</b> {{was written}} to help clinicians address the {{expansion}} of <b>intensive</b> outpatient <b>treatment</b> (IOT) represented by the development and adoption of new approaches to treat {{a wider variety of}} clients. Researchers and clinicians have begun to question the acute care model of treatment for substance use disorders; this reexamination has led to a more robust collaboration between researchers and practitioners. The resulting focus on evidence-based treatment approaches informs most of the material in this TIP. The consensus panel presents 14 guiding principles of IOT, supported by research and clinical experience. This TIP also situates IOT within the continuum of care framework established by the American Society of Addiction Medicine, including outpatient treatment and continuing community care. The volume describes the core services every program should offer, the enhanced services that should be available on site or through links with community-based services, and the process of assessment, placement, and treatment planning that helps clinicians address each client's needs. Based on research and clinical experience, the consensus panel discusses major clinical challenges of IOT and surveys the most common treatment approaches used in IOT programs, including family-based services. More specialized sections address treatment of specific groups of clients: women; adolescents and young adults; persons involved with the criminal justice system; individuals with co-occurring disorders; racial and ethnic minorities; persons with HIV/AIDS; lesbian, gay, and bisexual individuals; persons with physical or cognitive disabilities; rural populations; individuals who are homeless; and older adults.

25|$|He managed {{only one}} World Cup {{appearance}} though, after England failed {{to qualify for}} both the 1974 and 1978 tournaments. He finally reached a World Cup in 1982 when England got to the finals in Spain.

In a last, desperate effort to play in a World Cup (he knew {{that he would not be}} around for the 1986 competition) he secretly hired a car and drove from Spain to a specialist he knew in Germany for <b>intensive</b> <b>treatment.</b> He recovered sufficiently to appear as a substitute for the last 26 minutes of England's final Second Round game against hosts Spain. Unfortunately, though, his brief experience of World Cup football saw him miss a point-blank header which would have broken the deadlock, in a game England needed to win to progress to the semi-finals. England drew the game 0-0 and were eliminated from the competition.|$|E

50|$|B-cell lymphomas {{include both}} Hodgkin's lymphomas and most non-Hodgkin lymphomas. They are {{typically}} divided into {{low and high}} grade, typically corresponding to indolent (slow-growing) lymphomas and aggressive lymphomas, respectively. As a generalisation, indolent lymphomas respond to treatment and are kept under control (in remission) with long-term survival of many years, but are not cured. Aggressive lymphomas usually require <b>intensive</b> <b>treatments,</b> with some having a good prospect for a permanent cure.|$|R
40|$|Patients with {{recurrent}} lymphoma have a poor prognosis, {{even when}} a new remission can be obtained. In follicular lymphomas this remission is shorter. In aggressive lymphomas less than 10 % of the patients survive for 5 years. Salvage treatments include drugs that were not administered in the induction of treatment. In follicular lymphomas new drugs which interfere with adenosine deaminase are very promising. In view of the bad results of rescue treatment and of the good sensitivity of lymphomas, even when recurrent, to radiotherapy and chemotherapy, <b>intensive</b> <b>treatments</b> combined with allogeneic or autologous graft of haematopoietic stem cells have been tested, and the results obtained seem {{to be better than}} those of conventional treatments. The position of these new treatments will be more clearly defined when the results of randomized studies are known. However, the prognosis of recurrent lymphoma can be further improved by reducing the toxicity of <b>intensive</b> <b>treatments</b> with the use of haematopoietic growth factors, by ridding the graft of malignant cells and by stimulating the post-graft immune defence to diminish the incidence of recurrences...|$|R

2500|$|Most {{patients}} {{in the early years}} of ECT were given treatment two or three times a week, or occasionally daily; a few psychiatrists experimented with more <b>intensive</b> <b>treatment.</b> At St James Hospital, Portsmouth, William Liddell Milligan gave neurotic patients ECT up to four times daily. His aim was [...] "to reduce the patient to the infantile level, in which he is completely helpless and doubly incontinent". Robert Russell and Lewis Page tried a slightly different regime, giving patients one or two sessions of ECT a day but with several additional electric shocks during the convulsion. This treatment was given to over 3,800 patients at the Three Counties Hospital. Arlesey, Bedfordshire. The Page-Russell technique was taken up by Scottish-American psychiatrist D Ewen Cameron who used it to [...] "depattern" [...] his patients at the McGill University in Canada. It later emerged that the CIA had put funds into Professor Cameron’s work.

With the assistance {{and support of the}} Honorable Judge Robert E. Lewis (1927-1993), the city of Gadsden, and the Gadsden City Board of Education, the C.I.T.Y. Program began enrolling students on February 1, 1981. [...] C.I.T.Y. is designed to be a multidimensional program emphasizing habilitation (i.e., equipping at-risk youth on juvenile probation with skills needed {{to meet the demands of}} modern society). [...] Its objectives are: [...] 1. to identify the at-risk youth’s individual strengths and weaknesses, 2. to provide an individualized environment in which the at-risk youth can develop skills, and 3. to alter the natural environment of the at-risk youth so that new acquired skills are nurtured and encouraged. [...] To achieve these objectives, C.I.T.Y. offers academic remediation in reading, math, language; intensive counseling that involves behavior modification, consumer education, and job readiness training. [...] After all objectives have been met, C.I.T.Y. provides GED preparation, return to public school, and placement into technical school, college, job, or military service. [...] In 1983, C.I.T.Y. Program of Etowah County (Gadsden) received the National Council of Juvenile and Family Court Judges Unique and Innovative Project Award. [...] On October 1, 2009, C.I.T.Y.’s name was changed to Special Programming for Achievement Network (S.P.A.N.) and presently functions under the directorship of the Alabama Department of Youth Services.

40|$|PurposeThis {{study was}} {{designed}} to evaluate the clinical characteristics of childhood diabetes mellitus (DM) according to its classification as well as the clinical course of latent autoimmune diabetes (LAD) that initially showed noninsulin dependence despite autoantibody positivity. MethodsA total of 91 subjects diagnosed between 2001 and 2015 were enrolled in the study. They were classified into 3 groups: type 1 DM, LAD, and type 2 DM. Clinical features and laboratory findings were compared among groups. ResultsAmong 91 subjects, type 1 DM, LAD, and type 2 DM were 51 (56. 0 %), 7 (7. 7 %), and 33 (36. 3 %), respectively. In LAD, age at diagnosis and BMI Z-scores were higher, as compared with those in type 1 DM. Initial serum c-peptide levels were higher in LAD than those in type 1 DM, but lower than those in type 2 DM. In LAD, the mean follow-up duration was 4. 56 years, and 43 % of the patients ultimately required <b>intensive</b> insulin <b>treatment</b> with dosage of > 0. 5 U/kg/day. HbA 1 C and serum c-peptide levels at the time of <b>intensive</b> insulin <b>treatment</b> were 9. 43 ± 0. 93 % and 1. 37 ± 1. 36 ng/mL, respectively. Recent serum c-peptide/glucose ratio was lower in the group requiring <b>intensive</b> insulin <b>treatment</b> than the group without <b>intensive</b> insulin <b>treatment,</b> with P-value of 0. 057 (0. 003 ± 0. 005 vs. 0. 071 ± 0. 086). ConclusionInitial autoantibody evaluation is useful for classification and management. Close monitoring of the patients with LAD is important due to the expected need for <b>intensive</b> insulin <b>treatment</b> within several years...|$|R
