40|$|Our {{previous}} experiments {{evaluating the}} interactive effects of dietary L-carnitine and Paylean have primarily focused on improved meat quality benefits of feeding carnitine in combination with Paylean. Although there were numeric trends for improved growth performance in the previous experiments conducted at university facilities, the responses were not statistically significant. A recent study conducted in a commercial <b>finishing</b> <b>facility</b> demonstrated improved growth performance in pigs fed carnitine for the 4 -week period prior to slaughter. The cause for the growth response observed in the commercial facility compared to the two previous studies conducted at a university research facility may have been related to feed intake, stress, or the larger sample size compared to the first studies. In addition, pigs in the commercial facility study were fed carnitine from 97 lb until slaughter. Therefore, the objectives of this experiment were to confirm the growth performance results of the previous trial in a commercial <b>finishing</b> <b>facility</b> and to evaluate the interactive effect of L-carnitine and Paylean on growth performance and carcass characteristics when supplemented for only 3 weeks prior to slaughter...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present and compare {{previous}} efforts aiming to investigate whether previous wastewater disposal practices in selected (four) metal <b>finishing</b> <b>facilities,</b> located at Asopos river basin (near Athens at East-Central Greece), and resulted in relevant soil contamination. The work is focused mainly on Cr and Ni, which are the primary elements of concern in the Asopos river Basin area. To assess the natural geochemical levels of Cr and Ni, 30 soil samples were collected from locations that were assumed free of contamination. In these 30 soil samples, Cr concentration varied from 60 to 418 mg/kg, and Ni concentrations varied between 91 and 1200 mg/kg. A second group of soil samples consisted of more than 100 samples from drill cores and surface soil samples, assumed affected by the disposal of effluents of the metal <b>finishing</b> <b>facilities</b> and/or the relevant drainage of runoff water. A third group of samples consisted of 10 more surface soil samples collected in summer 2015 (campaigns by Sybilla ltd in the framework of EU IED Directive Baseline Site Investigation Study for two metal finishing units). The above mentioned groups of data were evaluated and compared with a fourth group of data (collected from Inofyta industrial area in the framework of EU funded project LIFE-CHARM “Chromium in Asopos groundwater system: Remediation technologies and Measures”). The conclusion of this study is that there is no indication of downstream pollution migration from the land-based treated effluents disposal of the above mentioned metal <b>finishing</b> <b>facilities.</b> Cr and Ni concentrations in the lower soil layers were of the same order of magnitude to those of the reference soils.

40|$|A mobile {{biofilter}} {{testing laboratory}} was developed where {{two types of}} wood chips (western cedar and hardwood) were examined to treat odor emissions from a deep-pit swine <b>finishing</b> <b>facility</b> in central Iowa.

40|$|Variability in pig {{growth is}} an {{intrinsic}} characteristic of swine production.

40|$|Handling and {{transport}} losses can encompass several challenges experienced frequently by producers and packers alike. Marketing {{and transport}}ation stress not only costs the industry due to mortalities, but has {{direct impact on}} the quality of pork delivered to the consumer (Barton-Gade, 1992; Geverink et al., 1996; Hambrecht, 2005).;The primary objective of the current study was to determine if loading system affects the incidence of losses during transportation or at the packing plant, welfare parameters at the time of marketing, and meat quality attributes. Two loading systems (prototype loading gantry [P] vs. traditional chute [T]) were compared on the first pigs marketed from a <b>finishing</b> <b>facility</b> (first pull [FP] pigs) and on the last pigs marketed from a <b>finishing</b> <b>facility</b> (closeout [CO] pigs).;Loading system influenced the total number of dead pigs (P 3 ̆c 0. 06) and total losses (P 3 ̆c 0. 03) in FP pigs. Results indicated that pigs loaded on the P chute during the FP have fewer total deads and total losses. Loading system also influenced welfare parameters (P 3 ̆c 0. 01) of both FP and CO pigs at the time of marketing. Pigs loaded on the P chute experienced significantly fewer electric prods, slips, falls, vocalizations, and pile ups, regardless of time of marketing.;Loading system did influence several meat quality attributes evaluated. In a comparison of FP pigs, loins from pigs loaded with the P loading system had higher (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) initial and 24 h pH and tended to have higher (P = 0. 08) JCS cut values, but lower (P = 0. 03) loin L* values. The higher JSC cut values and lower L* values indicate a darker, redder color meat. Among CO pigs, loins from pigs loaded with the P loading system had higher (P = 0. 01) 24 h pH and JCS rib values, but lower (P = 0. 06) L* values. Understanding key factors influencing losses during this time frame enables targeted interventions to improve both welfare and meat quality. This investigation has provided data to support changes in facility design that may ultimately lead to the improvement of performance, welfare, and pork quality...|$|E
40|$|A {{strategy}} for providing partial biofiltration {{of a critical}} minimum amount of ventilation air (CMVR) from a hybrid ventilated swine <b>finishing</b> <b>facility</b> was developed and tested. The CMVR, defined as the minimum treated exhaust air that suppressed nighttime curtain opening movement, was set at 81 m 3 h- 1 pig- 1 {{with the intention of}} providing enough fan ventilation to suppress inlet curtain movement during stable atmospheres, providing biofiltering for a high percentage of exhaust air. Two side-by-side 300 -head hybrid ventilated deep-pit swine finishing rooms were used for this research, one room as the control (CTL) with the other treatment (TRT). The TRT room was fitted with a wood-chip based biofilter for scrubbing the CMVR. In terms of total room emissions, the TRT room had an average odor emission 37 % less than the CTL room. Ammonia emission was 58 % lower for the TRT room as compared to the CTL room.
