5|$|Heritage turkey breeds {{have been}} a focus for the {{organization}} since 1997, when a survey showed only 1,335 breeding stock birds of all breeds. A {{study conducted by the}} Conservancy and Virginia Tech concluded that heritage turkey breeds had stronger immune systems than those breeds typically used by industrial <b>growers,</b> <b>and</b> as such were more likely to survive disease epidemics. This study and other programs increased awareness of heritage turkey breeds and by 2003 the breeding population stood at 4,275 turkeys of all breeds. By 2007 this had grown to more than 10,000 birds and 17 breeds were no longer considered to be almost extinct. As of 2010, the number is estimated to be close to 15,000.|$|E
5|$|In 1886, the agronomist William Farrer, {{established}} the research farm 'Lambrigg' {{on the banks}} of the Murrumbidgee south of present-day Tuggeranong. Farrer experimented with rust and drought-resistant wheat; the varieties he bred were widely used by Australian <b>growers,</b> <b>and</b> he was later credited with establishing Australia as a major producer. Tharwa Bridge, the oldest surviving bridge in the region, was opened in 1895 and was the first crossing over the Murrumbidgee River. By 1911, when the region came under federal control, the population had grown to 1,714 settlers.|$|E
40|$|Variety release {{decisions}} {{involve a}} number of tradeoffs, usually between <b>grower</b> <b>and</b> end-user characteristics as well as significant uncertainties about agronomic, quality, and economic variables. In this study, methodologies were developed to value tradeoffs for <b>grower</b> <b>and</b> end-user characteristics for wheat. The models capture effects of variability in agronomic, quality, and economic variables. The models were applied for three experimental varieties which have since been released and for two hypothetical varieties. Results indicate two of the experimental varieties provide improvements in <b>grower</b> <b>and</b> end-use value {{over most of the}} incumbents. Comparison of a risk adjusted portfolio model consisting of characteristics of end-use <b>and</b> <b>grower</b> values with traditional stochastic dominance techniques (tested for level of significance) indicate similar results. However, the portfolio model incorporates aspects of correlation between <b>grower</b> <b>and</b> end-use values simultaneously.

25|$|Popcorn will pop when freshly harvested, but not well: {{its high}} {{moisture}} content leads to poor expansion and chewy pieces of popcorn. Kernels {{with a high}} moisture content are also susceptible to mold when stored. For these reasons, popcorn <b>growers</b> <b>and</b> distributors dry the kernels until they reach the moisture level at which they expand the most. This differs by variety and conditions, but is generally {{in the range of}} 14–15% moisture by weight. If the kernels are over-dried, the expansion rate will suffer and the percentage of kernels that pop at all will decline.|$|E

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were {{to determine the effects of}} microbial phytase supplementation over a range of Non-Phytate Phosphorus (NPP) on some serum parameters of broiler chickens fed corn-soybean meal diets.

At 21 and 42 day of age, Serum Ca, P, Mg, Albumin and total protein were measured.

25|$|This section {{contains}} the cushion irises or royal irises, {{a group of}} plants noted for their large, strongly marked flowers. Between 30 and 60 species are classified in this section, depending on the authority. Compared with other irises the cushion varieties are scantily furnished with narrow sickle-shaped leaves and the flowers are usually borne singly on the stalks; they are often very dark and in some almost blackish. The cushion irises are somewhat fastidious <b>growers,</b> <b>and</b> to be successful with them they must be planted rather shallow in very gritty well-drained soil. They should not be disturbed in the autumn, and after the leaves have withered the roots should be protected from heavy rains until growth starts again naturally.|$|E

25|$|Javas {{had nearly}} {{vanished}} {{by the end}} of the 20th century, having been pushed to fringes of the poultry world by the intense focus on one or two breeds by commercial <b>growers,</b> <b>and</b> the introduction of innumerable new and exotic breeds to poultry fancy. Beginning in the 1990s, breeders and conservation organizations began to make a more concerted effort to save the Java. In particular, the Garfield Farm Museum in Illinois has played a pivotal role in the preservation of Javas in the 21st century. Beginning with Mottled and Black Javas, sports from the Garfield flock have revived the White variety. The Garfield Farm was also supported by the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago, which hatched Java chicks as part of their exhibit on genetics.|$|E
