And they don't just grab Petra. Now they can grab Jars of Clay, dc Talk or Newsboys.|$|E

25|$|Trailer Choir {{was founded}} in 2004 by Marc Fortney, known as Butter, along with Vinny Hickerson and Crystal Hoyt, who are {{respectively}} known as Big Vinny and Crystal in the group. Trailer Choir had originally started as a loose association of musicians, usually including Fortney and Hickerson, that played cover shows at fraternities and clubs {{in order to make}} some money and <b>have</b> <b>some</b> <b>fun,</b> rather than as an intended career path. Wanting to add original music without losing the audience led the group to writing and playing the party anthem style they are known for. They then started performing original shows during the week, while continuing to play the frat houses and clubs on the weekend.|$|E
25|$|Henry and Ellen Smith are {{a middle-aged}} married couple who have {{settled into a}} routine life {{in the suburbs of}} New York. Henry feels that the spice has gone out of their marriage, while Ellen is more content with their lot in life. When the couple comes into a {{financial}} windfall, Henry suggests that they take separate vacations. Reluctantly, Ellen agrees, and Henry departs to test the waters of New York City's nightlife. In the city, he meets up with Skeets, and the two go out on the town, eventually ending up pursuing Gloria Dawn and her friend Merle, Broadway dancers. After sitting at home and bemoaning her fate with her housekeeper, Whiffen, for a several days, eventually Ellen decides what is good for the goose is good for the gander, and she also departs to <b>have</b> <b>some</b> <b>fun</b> in New York.|$|E
25|$|By using tape, I {{could do}} a thirty-five or forty-minute show, then edit {{it down to the}} twenty-six or twenty-seven minutes the program ran. In that way, we could take out jokes, gags, or {{situations}} that didn't play well and finish with only the prime meat of the show; the solid stuff that played big. We could also take out the songs that didn't sound good. It gave us a chance to first try a recording of the songs in the afternoon without an audience, then another one in front of a studio audience. We'd dub the one that came off best into the final transcription. It gave us a chance to ad lib as much as we wanted, knowing that excess ad libbing could be sliced from the final product. If I made a mistake in singing a song or in the script, I could <b>have</b> <b>some</b> <b>fun</b> with it, then retain any of the fun that sounded amusing.|$|E

500|$|To escape their {{reputation}} for being overly serious and self-righteous, U2 decided to alter their image by being more facetious. Bono said, [...] "All through the Eighties we tried to be ourselves and failed when the lights were on. Which is what set us up for Zoo TV. We decided to <b>have</b> <b>some</b> <b>fun</b> being other people, or at least other versions of ourselves." [...] The Edge said, [...] "We were quite thrilled {{at the prospect of}} smashing U2 and starting all over again." [...] The group viewed humour as the appropriate response to their negative perception and that although their message would not change, they needed to change how they delivered it to their audience.|$|E

500|$|Johnson was sportsmanlike; on one {{occasion}} in South Africa, when Eastern Province batsman Ray Connell was bowled after the ball deflected from his head, Johnson replaced the bails, allowing him to continue batting. [...] During the Adelaide Test in 195051 he [...] "walked", ensuring that the unlucky John Warr took at least one wicket for the series. [...] Johnson was not above some gamesmanship, resorting to time-wasting tactics to avoid defeat in the final Test of the 1956 series against England. [...] He was willing to <b>have</b> <b>some</b> <b>fun</b> on occasion; when in the West Indies he convinced a local pilot {{to allow him to}} fly the plane carrying the Australian team between Trinidad and nearby Tobago, to the later displeasure of the Australian Board of Control.|$|E
500|$|The song {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics. The Phoenix music editor Daniel Brockman said that [...] "Gaga ups the ante {{in terms of}} catchy song writing and sheer high-in-the-club-banging-to-the-beat abandon." [...] He also commented on the lyrics saying that [...] "'Let's <b>have</b> <b>some</b> <b>fun,</b> this beat is sick / I wanna take a ride on your disco stick' might be the trashiest-yet-awesomest refrain I've heard on a major-label record this year." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine criticized the song for [...] "cheap" [...] lyrics and [...] "painfully enunciat without any resemblance of actual sex appeal". While reviewing The Fame, BBC said that the song sounded robotic in the line [...] "I wanna take a ride on your disco stick", though deemed it a brilliant track which [...] "leaves us awarding Gaga the yearbook title of 'pop star most likely to kill'." ...|$|E

It was all cute and harmless. Kinda like The Lone Gunmen themselves." [...] Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a [...] "B+" [...] and called it [...] "the second part of a story which didn’t really need one" [...] but {{also noted that the}} [...] "laid-back, let’s just hang out and <b>have</b> <b>some</b> <b>fun</b> vibe" [...] of the episode made the entry [...] "very, very easy to watch." [...] Furthermore, he praised the scene wherein Scully is drugged, calling it [...] "hilarious" [...] and [...] "glorious".|$|E

500|$|Following script rewrites, Cherry {{pitched the}} series to ABC, who {{picked up the}} pilot. ABC {{executives}} were, however, concerned about {{the title of the}} series, which Cherry had selected before even writing the script. They suggested renaming the series Wisteria Lane or The Secret Lives of Housewives, but Cherry insisted on keeping the original title. He later commented, [...] "I put 'desperate' [...] to try to indicate, however subtly... I'm going to <b>have</b> <b>some</b> <b>fun</b> with the imagery, to take it to some interesting places. Most critics got the joke. Some people see the word 'housewives' and it pushes a button in them and they seem to lose all reason." [...] The project was officially announced on October 23, 2003 as a cross between American Beauty and Knots Landing. While Desperate Housewives, along with fellow new series Grey's Anatomy and Lost, would later help reverse ABC's flagging fortune, network executives Lloyd Braun and Susan Lyne were fired shortly after greenlighting these risky and expensive pilots.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} {{addresses}} a [...] "good girl gone wild" [...] singing about her [...] "burning hot desire" [...] to <b>have</b> <b>some</b> <b>fun.</b> It contains references to singer Cyndi Lauper's [...] "Girls Just Want to Have Fun" [...] (1983), with lyrics like [...] "Girls, they just wanna have some fun" [...] and [...] "The room is spinning / It {{must be the}} Tanqueray / I'm about to go astray / My inhibitions gone away". In the intermediate verses, Madonna utters [...] "forgive me", which is a Catholic term used as a sexual reference. The lyrics, once placed {{in the context of}} Madonna's career [...] "attains a new meaning" [...] according to Josh Haigh from Attitude magazine. Explaining it, he said that the meaning behind the lyrics was how Madonna, being a Catholic girl herself, decided that she would not be tied down by anyone else's rules, and consequently {{became one of the most}} recognizable musical artists.|$|E
500|$|The North American {{release was}} {{scheduled}} for July 11, 2008, but was delayed until August 15, before being brought forward to August 13. As {{a result of the}} move from July, 20th Century Fox moved its family comedy Meet Dave in the open slot. The August 13 release date was also the opening weekends for the animated family film [...] and the horror film Mirrors. Studios consider the third week of August to be a weaker performing period than earlier in the summer because of students returning to school. Previous R-rated comedies such as The 40-Year-Old Virgin and Superbad were released in mid-August and performed well at the box office. Reacting to Tropic Thunders release date, Rob Moore, vice chairman of Paramount Pictures, stated: [...] "For a young person at the end of summer, you want to <b>have</b> <b>some</b> <b>fun</b> and forget about going back to school.

500|$|With {{the season}} reinventing the series again, {{composer}} Bear McCreary expanded {{the sound of}} the score [...] "in a big way". In addition to introducing new themes for the characters of Lash and Rosalind Price, McCreary made some changes to the orchestra: [...] "To represent Lash, I brought in larger percussion: merciless pounding taikos that I digitally compressed and distorted. This new, mangled percussion sound is horrific, and will become increasingly important as the season progresses." [...] McCreary also brought in trombones [...] "to get the scariest sound possible," [...] which resulted in the recording space being reconfigured when they were recorded. For Price, her scenes with Coulson [...] "give the series the feeling of a dense political thriller...I really leaned into that, musically. I introduce light acoustic percussion, mostly egg shakers, to give the pulsing synths a softer edge. And I used an acoustic piano to play the [...] "Rosalind Theme" [...] at key moments in her scenes...her music is meant to add intrigue and suspicion, and simultaneously allow us to <b>have</b> <b>some</b> <b>fun</b> with their witty banter." [...] For [...] "Maveth", McCreary used a 90-piece orchestra rather than the series' typical 50 or 70 players.|$|E
500|$|Roger advises Lane {{about how}} to ensnare a client at dinner. Roger informs Lane to find the man's source of regret, and make it {{relatable}} to himself, forming a [...] "conspiracy" [...] of feeling between the pair. Pryce's dinner does not go smoothly; the Jaguar representative appears to have no regrets in his life, and Lane is forced to plan another lunch to try again at confirming the new business. Upon hearing of this failure, Pete tactfully tells Lane to maintain a friendly relationship with the target, and to let Accounts take the business from there. Roger compliments Pete's letting Lane down softly and taking the task off his hands, forming a renewed alliance with Pete. At the dinner meeting, Edwin, the Jaguar representative, assures Don, Roger, and Pete they have his business, {{but he wants to}} <b>have</b> <b>some</b> <b>fun.</b> The executives quickly learn what kind of fun Edwin has in mind and they visit a local brothel, where Edwin, Roger, and Pete all cheat on their wives, leaving Don at the bar. Don later shares a cab with Pete on the way home in which the latter, drunk, criticizes Don as hypocritical for judging Pete's adulterous actions. Don explains he is not judging; he merely didn't know Pete was miserable. Pete replies sarcastically that he has everything, and Don warns him not to throw it away.|$|E
