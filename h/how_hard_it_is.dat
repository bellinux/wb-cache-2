Not for nothing have we scored 18 goals against two (both of them freaks) conceded in five ties all away from home. What can I say {{to do justice}} to that {{brilliant}} goalkeeper Gil Merrick, to wonderful young Trevor Smith and to the matchless Jeff Hall and Ken Green? Once again they mixed the old cement and constructed that brilliant wall of a defence. Sunderland would have needed to call in a firm of demolition contractors to destroy it.|$|E

She believes that Kōichi, Shige and Keizō don't care {{how hard it was}} for their father when he lost their mother. Kyōko believes that strangers and even Noriko would've been more respectful towards her. Noriko responds that while she understands Kyoko's disappointment with her siblings, she also explains that everyone has their own life to lead and that the drift between parents and children is inevitable. She convinces Kyoko not to be too harsh on her siblings because one day she too will understand <b>how</b> <b>hard</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> for them to have to take time from both their families and their own lives.|$|E

500|$|In {{the early}} months of 1950 Chance of a Lifetime was {{released}} into British cinemas; it was a film in which Jacques [...] "really made her mark", according to her biographer, Andy Merriman. Chance of a Lifetime is a social and industrial relations drama based in a plough factory whose manager cedes control to the workforce. Jacques played Alice, a welder: when she was offered her fee for 17 days filming, she replied [...] "I've done this job welding Bailey and Pontoon Bridges and I know <b>how</b> <b>hard</b> <b>it</b> <b>is.</b> That's not enough money!"

Being sensitive to how difficult it must be to manage the house and kids by herself, Jim does not tell her who the investor is during their phone conversations and pretends to be stressed over the meeting; Pam, in turn, affects to be having no problems so that she will not add to Jim's supposed stress.

Originally Lambert had casts taken of Robinson's face, hand and feet to create the statue of the saint which would {{be used as a}} decoration. The actor only enacted the live scenes. However during post-production, Lambert found that the statue did not look like Robinson, who was asked to re-shoot the {{respective}} scenes. He had to act as the statue and required special make-up for the retakes. The actor recalled that standing like a statue was difficult since [...] "first of all, I didn't realize <b>how</b> <b>hard</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> on the back to stand absolutely tall and straight and not move.

He said that like other male characters, taken alone Connor may seem a stereotypical teen boy, but considered with rest of the cast offers a complex image of modern masculinity. Greenwalt also compared Connor's journey with others in terms of identity, which he considers a poignant theme within the series. He found it ironic that Connor who was [...] "initially the most damaged of all the characters", was the only one able to [...] "reconcile his actions and new man existence together" [...] and be at peace with himself in the end.|$|E

[...] He refused to categorise the match as a [...] "friendly" [...] much like it is traditionally viewed as: [...] "There is a trophy and medals at stake. We won it last season and our players want to win it again." [...] Ferguson described the 3–0 defeat in the previous season's Shield as a [...] "humiliation", before discussing how it made the team prepare for the challenges ahead: [...] "I have reminded the players <b>how</b> <b>hard</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> to lose when you are playing for United these days – it makes so many other people happy."

In {{addition}} to work in Nepal, she has volunteered in Uganda and India, where she spent a week working with Mother Teresa that included assisting in a leprosy clinic. That trip inspired Cruz to help start a foundation to support homeless girls in India, where she sponsors two young women. She donated her salary from her first Hollywood film, The Hi-Lo Country, to Mother Teresa's mission. In the early 2000s, she spent time in Nepal photographing Tibetan children for an exhibition attended by the Dalai Lama. She also photographed residents at the Pacific Lodge Boys' Home, {{most of whom are}} former gang members and recovering substance abusers. She said: [...] "These kids break my heart.

In the episode [...] "Duets", Kurt suspects new glee club member and transfer student Sam Evans (Chord Overstreet) is gay and recruits Sam to be his teammate in the club's duets competition. Finn attempts to dissuade Kurt from partnering with Sam by predicting that Sam will be bullied to the point of quitting the club if he sings a duet with another male student.

500|$|Reception to {{the novel}} was {{positive}} and many reviewers praised the realistic setting and behaviours of the main characters. Koelling [...] noted how the novel has a balance of cute anthropomorphic characterisation and also gives a realistic view of <b>how</b> <b>hard</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> for the bears to survive on their own. Koelling also recommended the novel to Warriors fans. Kirkus Reviews praised how [...] "Hunter creates a richly sensuous world filled with cruelty, beauty, tenderness, savagery and just enough underlying legendary background to add mystery", but felt {{that there is little}} advancement of the plot due to the time introducing and developing the characters. Still, the reviewer felt that the novel would appeal the animal fantasy lovers for the its extreme detail. Publishers Weekly found the novel written more loosely than the Warriors series, but still appealing to readers as they follow the bears survival. Draper praised the fast pace and how Erin Hunter [...] "is apt at creating and sustaining the adrenaline-charged mood of these youngsters on their own". Matt Berman, writing for Half Moon Bay Review, praised the cliffhanger ending which would invite in more readers for the second novel, but felt that Warriors fans would be disappointed while [...] "animal lovers will find this story’s mix of anthropomorphism and realism appealing, and Hunter may find an entirely new audience".|$|E
500|$|Into the Wild {{received}} generally positive reviews. Booklist {{thought the}} novel [...] "spine-tingling" [...] {{and noted that}} [...] "the cat characters are true to their feline nature, making this sure to appeal to fans of Clare Bell's long-popular Ratha's Creature (1983) and its sequels and also to followers of Brian Jacques' ongoing Redwall series." [...] Publishers Weekly praised the excitement and also added that the book would please any person who [...] "has ever wondered what dreams of grandeur may haunt the family cat". The review also praised {{the world of the}} cats and themes put into the book. Although School Library Journal thought the book not as well written as the Redwall series, it did note that the novel presented an [...] "intriguing world with an intricate structure". The review also felt that was too many supporting characters, but [...] "there are standouts who give dimension to the tale". The amount of violence was also noted in the review. Kirkus Reviews joked the book would have cat owners look at their pets nervously before writing how Hunter doesn't have [...] "any hint of sentimentality. Snapping bones, flowing blood, and sudden death abundantly demonstrate how these cats walk on the thin edge of survival". The review noted how teens would see <b>how</b> <b>hard</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> for Firepaw to fit in. Washington Times notes the tension rising between Tigerclaw and Firepaw and praised the scene where Longtail challenges Firepaw's right to be in the Clan.|$|E

Denied dignity, and without anything useful to do, the new Duke of Windsor and his Duchess would be international society's most notorious parasites for a generation, while they thoroughly bored each other... She had thought of him as emotionally a Peter Pan, and of herself an Alice in Wonderland. The book they had written together, however, was a Paradise Lost."
