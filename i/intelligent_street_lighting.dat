40|$|Abstract — <b>Street</b> <b>lights</b> are {{the large}} {{consumer}} {{of energy in}} the cities, using upto fifty percent of the city’s energy. An <b>intelligent</b> <b>street</b> <b>light</b> management system based on LED lamps and wireless communication technologies can be designed and installed in the cities. Though, it will have initial cost of investment for replacing the traditional wired systems but lots of power can be saved by using this system. An <b>intelligent</b> <b>street</b> <b>light</b> system can detect vehicles and vary the intensity of the <b>street</b> <b>light</b> by using LED lamps as per the traffic flow. It can also help in monitoring and controlling of <b>street</b> <b>light</b> system and fault detection of the lamps through wireless technology...|$|R

If the sensor sense night, PlC microcontroller will switch on the Passive Infrared (PIR) sensor and lamp in dim condition and but if it day, there is nothing happen towards the system. Next, when PIR sensor senses the motion or movement, PlC microcontroller will switch the condition of lamp from dim to full brightness. The lamp will be in full brightness condition until the PIR sensor did not sense any movement anymore and it will back to dim conditon.

40|$|Faceted {{freeform}} reflectors {{were designed}} for <b>intelligent</b> <b>street</b> <b>lighting</b> with LED cluster arrays for main traffic roads. Special {{attention was paid to}} achieve highly efficient illumination on both wet and dry road surfaces. CIE reflection tables W 4 and C 2 were applied in the simulation for these two conditions, respectively. The reflector design started with plane facets, then - to avoid artifacts from the images of the individual LEDs - plane facets were replaced with cylindrical facets. To get even more flexibility for the design and optimization, freeform facets were employed, modeled by extruding two different conic curves together. Besides of achieving well-proportioned road luminance distribution, the basic shapes of the reflectors were formed to control stray light caused by multiple reflections within the reflector and by reflection of light from neighbor clusters within the cluster array. The merit functions include useful transmission of light to the road as well as overall and lengthwise uniformity according to road illumination standards. Due to the large amount of variables, the optimization was carried out sequentially facet by facet. The design loops included compromising with manufacturing limitations for plastics molding and thorough analysis of conformity with DIN EN 13201 standards for ME road lighting classes. The calculated reflector profiles are realized by plastic injection molding...|$|E
