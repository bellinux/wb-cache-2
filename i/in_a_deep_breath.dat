60|$|Dauncey drew <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> of realisation, and {{his face}} for a moment glowed.|$|E
60|$|Dane drew <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> {{when his}} {{companion}} concluded; then {{held out a}} big hand.|$|E
60|$|Bill drew <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath.</b> All this was, he supposed, unavoidable, {{but it was}} not pleasant.|$|E
6000|$|... "One would {{scarcely}} believe," [...] Wrayson remarked, {{leaning back}} in his chair and drawing <b>in</b> <b>a</b> long <b>deep</b> <b>breath,</b> [...] "that we are within three miles of one of the noisiest and most bustling of French watering places." ...|$|R
60|$|The Captain, laying his {{ponderous}} hand {{upon his}} chest, to assist himself <b>in</b> fetching <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath,</b> looked at Mr Carker {{from head to}} foot, and looked round the little room, {{as if he did}} not clearly understand where he was, or in what company.|$|R
60|$|Hare {{slipped to}} the bush, drew <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> long <b>breath</b> that stilled his agitation, and peered over the cliff. The crude {{shingles}} {{of the cabin}} first rose into sight; then beyond he saw the corral {{with a number of}} shaggy mustangs and a great gray horse. Hare stared blankly. <b>As</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> dream he saw the proud arch of a splendid neck, the graceful wave of a white-crested mane.|$|R
60|$|Jane {{drew back}} with a startled air, and opened her mouth, all agog, to let <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "This is {{something}} like," [...] remarked the eldest Rover, {{as he drew}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> of fresh air. [...] "Doesn't look like the storm of last night, eh, Sam?" ...|$|E
60|$|Winston was {{not quite}} sure what he answered, but he drew <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath,</b> for he had made the plunge and felt that the worst was over. His {{companion}} evidently noticed the gasp of relief.|$|E
5000|$|Take <b>a</b> <b>Deep</b> <b>Breath</b> is {{the second}} {{full-length}} album by Canadian band, Brighton Rock. The album was released <b>in</b> 1988. Take <b>a</b> <b>Deep</b> <b>Breath</b> is Brighton Rock's most commercially successful album, peaking at #22 on the Canadian album chart. The album was also certified Gold by the CRIA. [...] Gerry McGhee announced on April 30th, 2013 that Take <b>a</b> <b>Deep</b> <b>Breath</b> will be remastered by Warner Records.|$|R
5000|$|Breathe In. Breathe Out. {{is named}} after a song that she {{recorded}} with Matthew Koma, which according to Duff, [...] "stuck with her" [...] throughout the recording process of the album. She further explained: [...] "Over {{the past few years}} of my life it's just been something that really helped me—just taking <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> <b>in</b> and letting <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> out. It can be a good thing, it can be a struggle, it can be a power thing—it's just a good reminder for everyone to remember to do that. It's a relief." ...|$|R
40|$|<b>In</b> humans, <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> {{is known}} to induce {{cutaneous}} vasoconstriction in the warm state, and vasodilatation in the cold state. To investigate whether vasodilatation in the cold state is related to reduction of sympathetic vasoconstrictor nerve traffic, we studied the effect of <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> on vascular resistance <b>in</b> <b>a</b> skin area on the dorsum of the hand, in which release of noradrenaline from sympathetic nerves was blocked by iontophoretic pretreatment with bretylium tosylate. Simultaneous measurements were made in two control areas. In eight healthy subjects, data were obtained from <b>deep</b> <b>breaths</b> taken before bretylium in the warm state, after general cooling to a finger skin temperature below 25 °C and after rewarming to above 32 °C. In the warm state before bretylium pretreatment, the <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> evoked short-lasting vasoconstrictions at all sites. In the cold state there was no change of vascular resistance in the bretylium-pretreated area, whereas in the control areas an initial tendency towards vasoconstriction {{was followed by a}} significant transient vasodilatation. After rewarming, transient vasoconstrictions reappeared at the control sites, whereas only a transient vasodilatation occurred at the bretylium-pretreated site. In six healthy subjects we also monitored the effects of <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> on skin sympathetic nerve activity (recorded by microneurography in the peroneal nerve), and skin vascular resistance within the innervation zone of the impaled nerve fascicle in the foot. Data from thirty <b>deep</b> <b>breaths</b> per subject were averaged. In the cold state, the <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> induced <b>a</b> strong increase <b>in</b> neural discharge, followed by a transient reduction of nerve traffic lasting approximately 15 s and associated with a subsequent reduction of vascular resistance. We conclude that the deep breath-induced vasodilatation in the cold state is due to reduction of sympathetic vasoconstrictor nerve traffic. The vasodilatation after bretylium treatment in the warm state raises the possibility that <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> induces two simultaneous neural reactions, a vasoconstrictor and an active vasodilator component, the latter being weaker and normally masked by the strong vasoconstrictor component...|$|R
6000|$|... “I hope so,” and Tony drew <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath.</b> “It {{would be}} a merciful relief to feel I had seen the last of him. Why {{in the name of}} all that’s {{wonderful}} are you afraid he has gone?” ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Well, I’m ready,” went on Phil, as he {{arose from}} the bench. “Say, but isn’t it just a glorious day for the outing?” he added, casting his eyes around and drawing <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> of the pure, cold air.|$|E
60|$|Then {{she looked}} up the sweep of pine-trees to the towering sunlit cliffs and the high heaven above {{and then back to}} his face. She drew <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> of the sweet {{mountain}} air. Her eyes were soft and grave, and there was the faintest of smiles upon her resolute lips.|$|E
40|$|Good {{afternoon}} Mr. President {{and members}} of the Nevada Senate. It is a privilege to be before you in this capacity. If we would all find comfort in that standing place we are, and close our eyes. Take <b>in</b> <b>a</b> very <b>deep</b> <b>breath,</b> and expel it. <b>As</b> we breathe <b>in</b> and breathe out, this is the very life force known as God. The center and source of itself and all that it creates: God. The beginning, the now and the always, forever present; all that is known and unknown. And as that one creator of all that is, each person who is present right now, wherever that presence is, is a unique and divine expression of God. One of <b>a</b> kind, unique <b>in</b> every way. In the experience of the legislative process—for all that has led up to this day and this moment, and all that is yet to be—God is ever-present, expressing as each individual participating in this process. And for those who are elected to be there, those who have chosen to be there and those who serve in other capacities, each is a divine expression—moment to moment—with ideas, thoughts, exchanges, actions and reactions, that are forever divine just as they are. How grateful I am that as you go forward, with this day and all of those that follow, each person shows up as only he or she can. What a gift that is to all of us. For each person involved in this process, has said yes to public service, yes to the needs and interests of the State of Nevada. This shows up in all ways, moment to moment. Yes, I am grateful for this, for all who are present and those who are not—for who they are, who we are and how we express in our unique ways. For all of this is God, divine direction and love in action. For this I am so grateful. And so it is. AMEN...|$|R
5000|$|Process {{received}} widespread acclaim {{from music}} critics. On Metacritic, the album holds an average critic score of 86, based on 27 critics, indicating [...] "universal acclaim". In NME, Jonny Ensall described the album as a [...] "finely crafted and devastating {{take on the}} loss of his mother to cancer, as well as his inner turmoil at how success has dragged him away from his roots." [...] Entertainment Weekly critic Eric Renner Brown said, [...] "Sampha executes a sonically adventurous vision that's entirely his own and builds on his enormous potential." [...] Alexis Petridis from The Guardian wrote, [...] "Sisay shows off a genuinely individualistic approach to arrangement. The panic of [...] "Plastic 100°C" [...] floats along on a gentle wave of what sounds like harp or maybe koto. [...] "Kora Sings" [...] features a thrilling patchwork of scampering percussion, electronic noise and field recordings of rain and children speaking. The samples on [...] "Reverse Faults" [...] are melded into an insistent, slightly groggy pulse that's both compelling and unsettling. Nothing feels in thrall to current trends in R&B, either sonically or emotionally: Sisay may have been a constant, quiet presence on other people's records last year, but Process doesn't sound much like any of them. Instead, it's a weighty, powerful album with an identity entirely of its own. And while clearly not constructed with commercial ambition at the forefront of its mind, it's certainly good enough to make an unlikely star of the man behind it." [...] Marcus J. Moore from Pitchfork said that [...] "it's a remarkable, meditative work, as he processes grief and navigates self-discovery." [...] Clayton Purdom from The A.V. Club wrote: [...] "Process is <b>an</b> exercise <b>in</b> finding beauty in even the tragedy of a parent's death, a record of singular probity and hard-earned optimism. It's the best R&B debut since FKA Twigs' LP1." [...] Alexander Smail from The Skinny gave the album a perfect score, stating: [...] "Process is <b>an</b> exercise <b>in</b> catharsis, <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> <b>in</b> that lays Sampha's soul bare through gorgeous vignettes of his life. He worries, he regrets, he aches. He's human." ...|$|R
60|$|Heyst drew <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath.</b> The girl {{gave him}} a quick, wide-eyed glance.|$|R
60|$|The Captain led {{off with}} a miss in baulk. Malooney gripped his cue, drew <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath,</b> and let fly. The result was ten: a cannon and all three balls in the same pocket. As {{a matter of fact}} he made the cannon twice; but the second time, as we {{explained}} to him, of course did not count.|$|E
6000|$|... "I think we'll {{see some}} icebergs soon," [...] {{announced}} Captain Williamson, one evening. [...] "I can feel 'em in the air," [...] {{and he threw}} back his head to take <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath.</b> Many old sailors who have been in northern waters affirm that they can often [...] "smell" [...] icebergs before the bergs can be seen.|$|E
60|$|His words thrilled Bradley to the heart. He was in {{the world}} now. Des Moines and its capitol were dwarfed and overshadowed by this great {{national}} city, to which all roads ran like veins to a mighty heart. He lifted his shoulders <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath.</b> It was glorious to be a congressman, but still more glorious to be {{a citizen of the}} world.|$|E
60|$|Bill {{fastened}} a gimlet eye {{upon his}} brother-in-law and drew <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath.</b>|$|R
60|$|The old man stopped abruptly, {{and taking}} his outstretched hand, drew <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath.</b>|$|R
60|$|He {{expelled}} <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath,</b> and for <b>a</b> space stood staring <b>in</b> silence at <b>a</b> passing slug.|$|R
60|$|They strode on {{down the}} hot, stale smelling street, and Lister {{appeared}} to draw <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> of relief when they turned into the broad road that runs close by the surf-swept beach to the harbor. Though there were tall white stores and houses on its seaward side the night breeze swept down it exhilaratingly fresh and cool, and Lister bared his hot forehead to it.|$|E
60|$|I drew <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath,</b> and the {{movements}} of expectant listeners grew more audible when, reminded that his impressions were not asked for, Wilkins stepped down. Hope was beginning to dawn, for I could see that Dixon was {{on the trail of}} a conspiracy. Everybody seemed eager, the prosecutor as much so as the rest, and there was a deep silence when Dixon folded up the paper on which he had been making notes.|$|E
60|$|Then a sonorous pounding, and the thud of {{the screw}} joined in; {{and by the}} time the jet of steam had died away, the Shasta was quivering all through, while her masts stood upright and did not slant back again. Her {{windlass}} was also slowly gathering the clanking cable in, until at last it rattled furiously as she leaped astern. Then a hoarse shout of exultation went up, and Jimmy drew <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> of relief as he strode across his bridge.|$|E
60|$|Stoutenburg, having gained his point, {{jumped to}} his feet and drew <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> of satisfaction.|$|R
60|$|He breathed <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> {{and looked}} around the room before his gaze fixed again on Duane.|$|R
60|$|I drew <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath,</b> {{and slowly}} pressed on the trigger. The buck stood {{still as a}} stone.|$|R
60|$|He {{lifted his}} rifle and fired. He {{was a cool}} shot, and he wounded the beast upon its left shoulder. I could see the great crimson stream gush out all at once across the shapely sides, {{staining}} the flame-coloured stripes and reddening the black shadows. The tiger drew back, gave a low, fierce growl, and then crouched among the jungle. I saw {{he was going to}} leap; he bent his huge backbone into a strong downward curve, took <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath,</b> and stood at bay, glaring at us. Which elephant would he attack? That was what he was now debating. Next moment, with a frightful R'-r'-r'-r', he had straightened out his muscles, and, like a bolt from a bow, had launched his huge bulk forward.|$|E
60|$|At last, {{however, the}} loghouse rose, a lonely mound of whiteness, {{out of the}} prairie, and Winston drew <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> of contentment when a dusky figure {{appeared}} {{for a moment in}} the doorway. His weariness seemed to fall from him, and once more his companion wondered at the tirelessness of the man, as floundering on foot beside them he urged the team through the powdery drifts beneath the big birch bluff. Winston did not go in, however, when they reached the house, and when, five minutes later, Maud Barrington came out, she saw him leaning with a drawn face very wearily against the sleigh. He straightened himself suddenly at the sight of her, but she had seen sufficient, and her heart softened towards him. Whatever the man's history had been he had borne a good deal for her.|$|E
6000|$|Le Neve let {{his hand}} drop flat, {{and allowed the}} stone to fall from it. As he did so the two others stood back a pace, as if {{guarding}} him, but kept their hands still ready to seize the engineer's arm if he made the slightest attempt at motion. Eustace felt they were watching him as one might watch a madman. For a moment they were silent. Trevennack {{was the first to}} speak. His voice had an earnest and solemn ring in it, like a reproving angel's. [...] "How can you tell what precious life may be passing below?" [...] he said, with stern emphasis, fixing Le Neve with his reproachful eye. [...] "The stone might fall short. It might drop out of sight. You might kill whomsoever it struck, unseen. And then"--he drank <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath,</b> gasping--"you would know you were a murderer." ...|$|E
60|$|I took <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> like <b>a</b> man who {{is about}} to jump <b>an</b> {{obstacle}} <b>in</b> his path.|$|R
60|$|Sheila took <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath,</b> but did {{not look}} up. 'I am entirely in your hands,' she replied.|$|R
60|$|Then {{placing the}} horn {{to his lips}} and drawing <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath,</b> he blew with his utmost force.|$|R
