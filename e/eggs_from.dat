5|$|All Portia species eat eggs {{of other}} spiders, {{including}} eggs {{of their own}} species and of other cursorial spiders, and can extract <b>eggs</b> <b>from</b> cases ranging from the flimsy ones of Pholcus to the tough papery ones of Philoponella.

5|$|Unlike the Rouen duck, {{the other}} popular meat variety in England in the 19th century, Aylesbury ducks lay <b>eggs</b> <b>from</b> early November. Aylesbury ducks fatten quickly and by eight weeks after {{hatching}} weigh up to , {{large enough to}} eat but still young and extremely tender. Consequently, their meat came onto the market from February onwards, after {{the close of the}} game season but before the earliest spring chickens were on sale. Rouen ducks, whose mallard-like coloration made them less valuable, lay <b>eggs</b> <b>from</b> early February and take six months to grow large enough to eat. As a consequence, Aylesbury ducks were sold primarily in the spring and summer, and Rouen ducks in the autumn and winter.|$|E
5|$|M. mutabilis {{is known}} solely at the Ikh-Shunkht {{locality}} from the Barun Goyot Formation, {{dating from the}} Santonian to Campanian. M. rugustus is also known from the Barun Goyot Formation, which represents a sand-dune filled eolian environment. Compared to the Nemegt Formation, large dinosaurs are rare at Barun Goyot, where the fauna is dominated by protoceratopsids, oviraptorids, and ankylosaurids. Other types of fossil <b>eggs</b> <b>from</b> the Barun Goyot Formation include Protoceratopsidovum, Gobioolithus, Faveoloolithus, Dendroolithus, Spheroolithus, and Subtiliolithus.|$|E
5|$|Macroolithus rugustus is {{abundant}} in the Nemegt Formation, which dates to the late Campanian to early Maastrichtian. This formation represents depositions of a meandering river. Well-preserved dinosaur remains are common in the Nemegt Formation, including oviraptorosaurs, titanosaurs, troodontids, tyrannosaurs, ankylosaurs, pachycephalosaurs, hadrosaurs, ornithomimosaurs, alvarezsaurs, and therizinosaurs. Remains of small animals are relatively rare, but several types of birds are known from Nemegt, {{as well as several}} types of multituberculate mammals. Other fossil <b>eggs</b> <b>from</b> the Nemegt Formation include Ovaloolithus, Spheroolithus, Elongatoolithus, and Laevisoolithus.|$|E

5|$|Teleosts may spawn in {{the water}} column or, more commonly, on the substrate. Water column spawners are mostly limited to coral reefs; the fish will rush towards the surface and release their gametes. This appears to protect the <b>eggs</b> <b>from</b> some predators and allow them to {{disperse}} widely via currents. They receive no parental care. Water column spawners are more likely than substrate spawners to spawn in groups. Substrate spawning commonly occurs in nests, rock crevices or even burrows. Some eggs can stick to various surfaces like rocks, plants, wood or shells.|$|E
5|$|The duckers of Aylesbury {{would buy}} <b>eggs</b> <b>from</b> the breeders, or {{be paid by}} a breeder to raise the ducks on their behalf, and would raise the ducklings in their homes between November and August as a {{secondary}} source of income. Duckers were typically skilled labourers, who invested surplus income in ducklings. Many of the tasks related to rearing the ducks would {{be carried out by}} the women of the household, particularly the care of newly hatched ducklings.|$|E
5|$|The most {{commonly}} cited human threat to birds is habitat loss. Other threats include overhunting; accidental mortality due to collisions with buildings and vehicles; long-line fishing bycatch; pollution (including oil spills and pesticide use), competition; predation; hybridisation from nonnative introduced or invasive species; and climate change. The collection of specimens for taxidermy and <b>eggs</b> <b>from</b> the wild has at times {{had a serious}} effect on some species. It is now forbidden in many countries, such as by the British Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981.|$|E

5|$|Western {{burrowing}} owls {{were originally}} {{listed as a}} species of special concern by the California Department of Fish and Game in 1979. California's population declined 60% from the 1980s to the early 1990s, and continues to decline at roughly 8% per year. A 1992–93 survey reported little to no breeding burrowing owls {{in most of the}} western counties in the Bay Area, leaving only Alameda, Contra Costa, and Solano counties as remnants of a once large breeding range. Bald eagles were once common in the Bay Area, but habitat destruction and thinning of <b>eggs</b> <b>from</b> DDT poisoning reduced the California state population to 35 nesting pairs. Bald eagles disappeared from the Bay Area in 1915, and only began returning in recent years. In the 1980s an effort to re-introduce the species to the area began with the Santa Cruz Predatory Bird Research Group and the San Francisco Zoo importing birds and <b>eggs</b> <b>from</b> Vancouver Island and northeastern California, and there are now nineteen nesting couples in eight of the Bay Area's nine counties. Other once absent species that have returned to the Bay Area include Swainson’s hawk, white tailed kite, and the osprey.|$|E
5|$|A {{third round}} of {{guidelines}} was issued in April 2012 when the company {{announced that it would}} begin phasing in a plan to stop purchasing poultry and pork products from suppliers that caged animals. With this announcement, Burger King became the first American Fast food company to promise to purchase 100% of its <b>eggs</b> <b>from</b> companies that did not utilize wire battery cages and pork from suppliers that did not use gestational cages for sows. This is an increase of the percentage of cage free products from 9% of egg purchases and 20% of pork purchases the company made in 2008. The plan should be completed by 2017.|$|E

5|$|Brood {{parasitism}} demonstrates close coevolution of {{host and}} parasite, {{for example in}} cuckoos. These birds do not make their own nests, but lay their eggs in nests of other species, ejecting or killing the eggs and young of the host and thus having a strong {{negative impact on the}} host's reproductive fitness. Their eggs are camouflaged as eggs of their hosts, implying that hosts can distinguish their own <b>eggs</b> <b>from</b> those of intruders and are in an evolutionary arms race with the cuckoo between camouflage and recognition. Cuckoos are counter-adapted to host defences with features such as thickened eggshells, shorter incubation (so their young hatch first), and flat backs adapted to lift eggs out of the nest.|$|E
5|$|Camouflage {{is found}} in many butterflies. Some like the oakleaf {{butterfly}} and autumn leaf are remarkable imitations of leaves. As caterpillars, many defend themselves by freezing and appearing like sticks or branches. Others have deimatic behaviours, such as rearing up and waving their front ends which are marked with eyespots {{as if they were}} snakes. Some papilionid caterpillars such as the giant swallowtail (Papilio cresphontes) resemble bird droppings. Some caterpillars have hairs and bristly structures that provide protection while others are gregarious and form dense aggregations. Some species are myrmecophiles, forming mutualistic associations with ants and gaining their protection. Behavioural defences include perching and angling the wings to reduce shadow and avoid being conspicuous. Some female Nymphalid butterflies guard their <b>eggs</b> <b>from</b> parasitoidal wasps.|$|E
5|$|Earwigs {{are among}} the few non-social insect species that show {{maternal}} care. The mother will {{pay close attention to}} the needs of her eggs, such as warmth and protection, though {{studies have shown that the}} mother does not pay attention to the eggs as she collects them. The mother has been shown to pick up wax balls by accident, but they would eventually be rejected as they do not have the proper scent. The mother will also faithfully defend the <b>eggs</b> <b>from</b> predators, not leaving them to eat unless the clutch goes bad. Another distinct maternal care unique to earwigs is that the mother continuously cleans the eggs to protect them from fungi. Studies have found that the urge to clean the eggs persists for days after they are removed; when the eggs were replaced after hatching, the mother continued to clean them for up to 3 months.|$|E

5|$|Female moths are {{attracted}} to flowering soybean fields. The most severe infestations occur between flowering and when pods become fully developed. Large-scale outbreak is associated with time of peak flowering, when most pods are developed, and peak moth flight, for giant. Moths are also attracted to drought stressed soybeans or fields with poor growth. Dry weather leads to quick drying of corn plants, compelling moths to leave and seek other hosts. Heavy rainfall also decreases corn earworm populations because it drowns pupae in their soil chambers, limits moth flight, washes <b>eggs</b> <b>from</b> leaves, and creates favorable conditions for fungal diseases that kill caterpillars.|$|E

5|$|Many Macroolithus {{specimens}} in South China have {{double- or}} multiple-layering of cones {{on the inner}} surface of the eggshell, a pathological condition known as ovum in ovo. It is especially prevalent among eggs nearest to the Cretaceous-Tertiary (K-T) boundary, which represents {{the end of the}} Mesozoic Era. This pathology is correlated with a higher concentration of trace elements like Co, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, Sr, V, and Zn. Experiments on modern birds have demonstrated that exposure to high levels of these elements will cause them to be incorporated into the eggshell, but the precise mechanism behind the pathological multi-layering is unknown. These abnormalities presumably affected hatchability of the eggs and may {{have played a role in}} the extinction of the dinosaurs. However, the embryonic remains inside three multilayered Macroolithus-like <b>eggs</b> <b>from</b> Ganzhou appear unaffected.|$|E
