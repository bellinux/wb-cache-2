To model the flexibility of the DDM, a lumped parameter approximation was used to capture the compliance of individual parts within the <b>drive</b> <b>linkage.</b> These stiffness approximations were then validated using FEA and iteratively updated in the model to converge on the actual distributed parameter equivalent stiffnesses. The goal of the analyses is to determine the deflections in the mechanism and whether or not the deflections are in the region of elastic or plastic deformation.

40|$|Upon observing an {{abnormal}} {{closure of the}} Space Shuttle s External Tank Doors (ETD), a dynamic model was created in MSC/ADAMS to conduct deflection analyses of the Door Drive Mechanism (DDM). For a similar analysis, the traditional approach would be to construct a full finite element model of the mechanism. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to describe an alternative approach that models the flexibility of the DDM using a lumped parameter approximation to capture the compliance of individual parts within the <b>drive</b> <b>linkage.</b> This approach allows for rapid construction of a dynamic model in a time-critical setting, while still retaining the appropriate equivalent stiffness of each linkage component. As a validation of these equivalent stiffnesses, finite element analysis (FEA) was used to iteratively update the model towards convergence. Following this analysis, deflections recovered from the dynamic model can be used to calculate stress and classify each component s deformation as either elastic or plastic. Based on the modeling assumptions used in this analysis and the maximum input forcing condition, two components in the DDM show a factor of safety less than or equal to 0. 5. However, to accurately evaluate the induced stresses, additional mechanism rigging information would be necessary to characterize the input forcing conditions. This information would also allow for the classification of stresses as either elastic or plastic...|$|E

40|$|A {{large body}} of {{evidence}} strongly suggests that the p 53 tumor suppressor pathway is central in reducing cancer frequency in vertebrates. The protein product of the haploinsufficient mouse double minute 2 (MDM 2) oncogene binds to and inhibits the p 53 protein. Recent studies of human genetic variants in p 53 and MDM 2 have shown that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) can affect p 53 signaling, confer cancer risk, and suggest that the pathway is under evolutionary selective pressure (1 - 4). In this report, we analyze the haplotype structure of MDM 4, a structural homolog of MDM 2, in several different human populations. Unusual patterns of linkage disequilibrium (LD) in the haplotype distribution of MDM 4 indicate the presence of candidate SNPs that may also modify {{the efficacy of the}} p 53 pathway. Association studies in 5 different patient populations reveal that these SNPs in MDM 4 confer an increased risk for, or early onset of, human breast and ovarian cancers in Ashkenazi Jewish and European cohorts, respectively. This report not only implicates MDM 4 as a key regulator of tumorigenesis in the human breast and ovary, but also exploits for the first time evolutionary <b>driven</b> <b>linkage</b> disequilibrium as a means to select SNPs of p 53 pathway genes that might be clinically relevant...|$|R
40|$|The {{analysis}} of mutualistic networks {{has become a}} central tool in answering theoretical and applied questions regarding our understanding of ecological processes. Significant gaps in knowledge do however need to be bridged in order to effectively and accurately be able to describe networks. Main concern are the incorporation of species level information, accounting for sampling limitations and understanding linkage rules. Here I propose a simple method to combine plant pollinator effort-limited sampling with information about plant community to gain understanding of what <b>drives</b> <b>linkage</b> rules, while accounting for possible undetected linkages. I use hierarchical models to estimate the probability of detection of each plant-pollinator interaction in 12 Mediterranean plant-pollinator networks. As {{it is possible to}} incorporate plant traits as co-variables in the models, this method {{has the potential to be}} used for predictive purposes, such as identifying undetected links among existing species, as well as potential interactions with new plant species. Results show that pollinator detectability is very skewed and usually low. Nevertheless, 84 % of the models are enhanced by the inclusion of co-variables, with flower abundance and inflorescence type being the most commonly retained co-variables. The predicted networks increase network Connectance by 13 %, but not Nestedness, which is known to be robust to sampling effects. However, 46 % of the pollinator interactions in the studied networks comprised a single observation and hence could not be modeled. Th...|$|R

40|$|In the {{synthesis}} of high-speed cam profiles, we must compensate for the elastic deflections induced by large inertial effects generated during operation. Thus, differential equations with kinematic constraints need to be solved. The governing dynamic equations are in homogeneous, periodic, linear, ordinary differential equations which possess multiple unstable and high vibrational regions at various operating speed zones. These regions {{are found to be}} intrinsically determined by the changing geometry of the follower linkage during operation;This dissertation considers two types of cam <b>driven</b> <b>linkages.</b> Parts I and II consider a cam driving a lumped inertia through a massless elastic slider-crank follower linkage with concentrated masses located at two of the joints. The output shaft and the links are subject to torsional and axial deflection, respectively. Part III considers a cam driving a lumped mass through an elastic slider-crank follower linkage with a curved beam coupler. The coupler is modeled using finite element techniques, and the output shaft is subject to torsion only;In both Parts I and III an iterative procedure, taking the elasticity, damping, and changing geometry of the linkage into account, is developed for synthesizing the cam profile to produce a desired output motion at a given design speed. The response improves as iteration proceeds. The number of iteration is limited by the numerical truncation because the value of a parameter decreases at each iteration. The iterative procedure lowers all the high amplitude vibrations in Part I and some of the high amplitude vibrations in Part III;In Part II the location of a single dominant pair of complex characteristic multipliers on the complex plane is used to explain the formation of high amplitude vibrations at certain speeds. These multipliers, which are eigenvalues of the discrete transition matrix for a complete cycle of operation, also predict the effects of inaccurate damping ratio estimates;For either type of linkage considered, design speeds should not be chosen close to the intrinsically high vibration speeds which can be found through simulation of the initial trial design...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{the issue}} of the {{kinematic}} &ndash; as opposed to dynamic &ndash; preshaping of self-adaptive robotic fingers <b>driven</b> by <b>linkages</b> is discussed. A method to obtain designs of these fingers capable of various behaviours during their closing motions is presented. The method is based on using triggered passive elements in carefully selected joints of the finger and the selection or optimization of geometric parameters to obtain particular kinematic relationships between the motions of the phalanges. This method is very general and can be applied to any self-adaptive robotic finger in order to obtain many different types of closing motions. Examples given in this paper are focusing on two different preshaping motions, the first one aims at allowing pinch grasps while the second mimics a human finger.
