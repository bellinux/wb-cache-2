5|$|Arthur Holmes (1890–1965) {{was born}} in England and became Regius Professor of Geology at the University of Edinburgh in 1943. His magnum opus was Principles of Physical Geology, first {{published}} in 1944, in which he proposed the idea that slow moving convection currents in the Earth's mantle created 'continental drift' {{as it was then}} called. He also pioneered the discipline of geochronology. He lived long <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> theory of plate tectonics become widely accepted, and he is {{regarded as one of the}} most influential geologists of the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|Aware {{that his}} ship was {{suffering}} {{the worst of}} the casualties, L'Héritier ordered his men to attempt to board the British ship of the line, but first one and then another attempt to do so was driven back with heavy casualties. The lighting of Hercule had gone out {{at the beginning of the}} engagement, leaving her crew confused, and as a result, only around 40 men answered when L'Héritier ordered the boarding; he was himself injured twice, to the head by a sabre and to the thigh by a pike, while leading the assault. At 10:30, after an hour of continual bombardment L'Héritier surrendered: Hercules hull had been torn open, five guns were dismounted with others damaged and more than two fifths of the crew killed or wounded. Jason was approaching fast and the rest of Bridport's fleet was close <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> muzzle flashes from the battle.|$|E

25|$|Wednesday couldn't {{keep the}} forward {{momentum}} going however, {{and by the}} turn of the new millennium again found itself on the brink of relegation – a 3–3 draw at Arsenal in May 2000 was <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> Owls tumble to into the First Division. Having spent large sums building squads that were ultimately ineffective, the club's finances took a turn for the worse, and in 2003 they were relegated for a second time in four years, to the Second Division.|$|E

25|$|The FSLN {{originated}} in the milieu of various oppositional organizations, youth and student groups in the late 1950s and early 1960s. The University of Léon, and the National Autonomous University of Nicaragua (UNAN) in Managua {{were two of the}} principal centers of activity. Inspired by the Revolution and the FLN in Algeria, the FSLN itself was founded in 1961 by Carlos Fonseca, , Tomás Borge and others as The National Liberation Front (FLN). Only Tomás Borge lived long <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> Sandinista victory in 1979.|$|E
25|$|Zevon stated {{previously}} {{that his}} illness {{was expected to}} be terminal within months after diagnosis in the fall of 2002; however, he lived to see the birth of twin grandsons in June 2003 and the release of The Wind on August 26, 2003. Owing in part to the first VH1 broadcasts of Nick Read's documentary Warren Zevon: Keep Me in Your Heart, the album reached number 12 on the U.S. charts, Zevon's highest placement since Excitable Boy. When his diagnosis became public, Zevon wryly told the media that he just hoped to live long <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> next James Bond movie, a goal he accomplished.|$|E
25|$|Ten years later, she {{undertook}} {{one final}} singing {{tour of the}} United States; however, {{it turned out to}} be a critical, financial and personal failure, owing to the deterioration of her voice through age and wear and tear. From then on she restricted herself to the occasional concert here or there, or to private performances mounted at a little theater she had built in her impressive residence, Craig-y-Nos Castle in Wales. She last sang in public on 24 October 1914, taking part in a Red Cross concert at London's Royal Albert Hall that had been organized to aid victims of World War I. She lived long <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> war end, dying in 1919 of natural causes.|$|E

25|$|At {{the same}} {{exhibition}} Paul Cézanne {{was represented by}} ten works. He wouldn't live long <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> end of the show. Cézanne died 22 October 1906 (aged 67). His works included Maison dans les arbres (no. 323), Portrait de Femme (no. 235) and Le Chemin tournant (no. 326). Constantin Brâncuși entered three plaster busts: Portrait de M. S. Lupesco, L'Enfant and Orgueil (no. 218 - 220). Raymond Duchamp-Villon exhibited Dans le Silence (bronze) and a plaster bust, Œsope (no. 498 and 499). His brother Jacques Villon exhibited six works. Kees van Dongen showed three works, Montmartre (492), Mademoiselle Léda (493) and Parisienne (494). André Derain exhibited Westminster-Londres (438), Arbres dans un chemin creux (444) and several other works painted at l'Estaque.|$|E
25|$|Wardell died at his home, Upton Grange, in Edward Street, North Sydney on 19 November 1899 {{of heart}} failure and pleurisy. He is buried in the Catholic section of Gore Hill Cemetery. He did not live long <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> final {{finishing}} touches to St Patrick's Cathedral, and St Mary's Cathedral was far from finished. His legacy to Australia has been to give that country two cathedrals which rank among the finest modern examples of gothic architecture. St Patrick's Cathedral {{is considered one of}} the few Australian buildings to be of world significance. However, Wardell's work was more than the design of two cathedrals, his work was versatile and skilful in both the Gothic and classical styles and has given both Sydney and Melbourne some of their most distinguished 19th-century buildings.|$|E
25|$|Adelaide United's first {{match was}} at home against Wellington Phoenix. A single goal by Sergio Cirio in the 31st minute was <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> game end {{in favor of the}} home team. United progressed to a Round of 16 home match against Brisbane Roar, where goals by Cirio and Bruce Djite within the first half left the score 2–0. In the quarter-final stage, Adelaide United were drawn away to Sydney FC. Goals scored by Cirio and Sydney FC captain Alex Brosque took the match into extra time, where Djite found the net on twice to end the game 1–3. In the semi-finals, United took on Central Coast Mariners at home. A brace from Cirio either side of a goal from Awer Mabil saw the match end 3–2, with Adelaide {{progressing}} to the first ever FFA Cup Final.|$|E

25|$|Beerus has {{appeared}} in several Dragon Ball games, the first being Dragon Ball Heroes. In the 2015 game Dragon Ball Xenoverse, Beerus pretends to be possessed by Demigra before revealing gods are immune to his powers, Beerus then engaging him in battle with the player and after besting him fighting the player and Trunks with Whis in a test, Beerus allowing the player to defeat Demigra after he passes, staying awake long <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> player overcome Demigra in battle. Beerus {{also serves as a}} mentor, teaching his moves to the player. In the 2016 sequel Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2, Beeerus becomes angered by the bad taste of the pudding made by the Supreme Kai of Time, causing Whis and the player to have to subdue him. Beerus and Whis leave Earth while Freeza is attacking it when contacted by the Supreme Kai of Time, allowing Freeza to destroy Earth without Whis' prevention and the pair discovering they have been deceived by Towa. Beerus and the player fight Whis before Beerus and Whis depart from the main story.|$|E

500|$|She next {{starred in}} the musical {{adaptation}} of Neil Simon's The Goodbye Girl with music by Marvin Hamlisch (1993). Peters won her second Tony for Best Leading Actress in a Musical for her performance as Annie Oakley in the 1999 Broadway revival of Annie Get Your Gun. Among many glowing notices, critic Lloyd Rose of the Washington Post commented: [...] " [...] banishes all thoughts of Ethel Merman about two bars into her first number, 'Doin' What Comes Natur'lly.' Partly this is because Merman's Annie was a hearty, boisterous gal, while Peters plays an adorable, slightly goofy gamine. ... For anyone {{who cares about the}} American musical theater, the chance to see Peters in this role is reason <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> show." [...] Playbill went even further: [...] "Arguably the most talented comedienne in the musical theatre today, Peters manages to extract a laugh from most every line she delivers." ...|$|E

500|$|Count, later (1845) Prince Mikhail Vorontsov (30 May 1782 – 18 November 1856), Viceroy of New Russia, {{builder of}} the palace. He was renowned for {{his success in}} the Napoleonic wars. As the Viceroy of the Caucasus from 1844 to 1853, he {{supervised}} {{the conduct of the}} Caucasian War. Having completed the palace, Vorotsov, now suffering progressive blindness, spent little time there. His commitments to the expanding Russian Empire took him to Tiflis; there, he waged wars on the rebellious local tribes. The now elderly Vorontsov, a confirmed anglophile, was particularly distressed by the outbreak of the Crimean War, which, in England, was heavily promoted by his English nephew, Sidney Herbert. Embarrassed and distressed, he retired from public life to the privacy of Odessa. [...] Vorontsov died in 1856, having lived just long <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> signing of the Peace of Paris. Vorontsov's tomb in the Odessa Cathedral was ruined by the Soviets, but his remains survived the Soviet era and were returned to the newly rebuilt cathedral in 2005.|$|E
500|$|During the Garfield administration, Secretary of State James G. Blaine {{attempted}} to invigorate United States diplomacy in Latin America, urging reciprocal trade agreements and offering to mediate disputes among the Latin American nations. Blaine, venturing a greater involvement in affairs {{south of the}} Rio Grande, proposed a Pan-American conference in 1882 to discuss trade {{and an end to}} the War of the Pacific being fought by Bolivia, Chile, and Peru. Blaine did not remain in office long <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> effort through, and when Frederick T. Frelinghuysen replaced him at the end of 1881, the conference efforts lapsed. [...] Frelinghuysen also discontinued Blaine's peace efforts in the War of the Pacific, fearing that the United States might be drawn into the conflict. [...] Arthur and Frelinghuysen continued Blaine's efforts to encourage trade among the nations of the Western Hemisphere; a treaty with Mexico providing for reciprocal tariff reductions was signed in 1882 and approved by the Senate in 1884. Legislation required to bring the treaty into force failed in the House, however, rendering it a [...] Similar efforts at reciprocal trade treaties with Santo Domingo and Spain's American colonies were defeated by February 1885, and an existing reciprocity treaty with the Kingdom of Hawaii was allowed to lapse.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{being the}} longest {{statement}} of the facts {{in any of the}} four appellate opinions generated by the case, Cardozo's was described by Posner as [...] "elliptical and slanted". It has also been deemed [...] "highly abstract". According to Professor Walter O. Weyrauch in his 1978 journal article, [...] "Cardozo's famous opinion reduced the complicated facts of the case to a bare minimum. Mrs. Palsgraf was transformed into a 'plaintiff' without age, family status, or occupation. The opinion omitted the nature of her injury, the amount of damages that she sought, {{and the size of the}} jury award." [...] For example, Cardozo describes Palsgraf (whom he does not name, nor mention her daughters) as standing on the LIRR's platform, rather than waiting for a train, thus downplaying her status as a customer entitled to a high degree of care by the railroad. The explosive package is described as small, though the witnesses had described it as large. The scales are described as being [...] "at the other end of the platform, many feet away" [...] from the explosion, but the record does not support this statement. This characterization may have been based on testimony by Lillian Palsgraf, who had gone to buy a paper from a newsstand [...] "at the other end of the platform", but who was yet close <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> package fall. Cardozo's characterization of distance would be challenged by the plaintiff in her motion for reargument, which would be denied with the rejoinder that however close she was to the explosion, she was not so close as to bring her within the zone of foreseeable risk.|$|E
