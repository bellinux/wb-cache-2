5|$|The Ancient Greek term acra {{was used}} to {{describe}} other fortified structures during the Hellenistic period. The Acra <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>called</b> the Seleucid Acra to distinguish it from references to the Ptolemaic Baris as an acra and from the later quarter in Jerusalem which inherited the name Acra.|$|E
5|$|The University of Paris, {{founded in}} the 12th century, <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>called</b> the Sorbonne after one of its {{original}} medieval colleges. It was broken up into thirteen autonomous universities in 1970, following the student demonstrations in 1968. Most of the campuses today are in the Latin Quarter where the old university was located, while others are scattered around {{the city and the}} suburbs.|$|E
5|$|The current {{format of}} the {{competition}} involves a qualification phase, which currently takes place over the preceding three years, to determine which teams qualify for the tournament phase, which <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>called</b> the World Cup Finals. 32 teams, including the automatically qualifying host nation(s), compete in the tournament phase for the title at venues within the host nation(s) {{over a period of}} about a month.|$|E

50|$|Mudflows <b>are</b> <b>often</b> <b>called</b> mudslides, a term applied indiscriminately by {{the mass}} media {{to a variety of}} mass wasting events. Mudflows often start as slides, {{becoming}} flows as water is entrained along the flow path; such events <b>are</b> <b>often</b> <b>called</b> flow slides.|$|R
5|$|The {{smallest}} region, the flocculonodular lobe, <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>called</b> the vestibulocerebellum. It is {{the oldest}} part in evolutionary terms (archicerebellum) and participates mainly in balance and spatial orientation; its primary connections are with the vestibular nuclei, although it also receives visual and other sensory input. Damage to this region causes disturbances of balance and gait.|$|E
5|$|While Dhumavati {{generally}} {{is associated with}} only inauspicious qualities, her thousand-name hymn tells about her positive aspects, too. She <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>called</b> as bestower of boons and tender-hearted. Her hymn says that she lives {{in the midst of}} women and is worshipped by them. Her hymn sings of her as the giver of children.|$|E
5|$|A two-minute minor penalty <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>called</b> for lesser infractions such as slashing, tripping, elbowing, roughing, {{too many}} players, illegal equipment, holding, or interference. Five-minute major {{penalties}} are called for especially violent instances of most minor infractions {{that result in}} intentional injury to an opponent, {{as well as for}} fighting. Players are released from the penalty box when either the penalty time expires, or the opposition scores a goal (or three goals for the instance of a major penalty).|$|E

5|$|Grand Forks is {{the third-largest}} {{city in the}} State of North Dakota (after Fargo and Bismarck) and is the county seat of Grand Forks County. According to the 2010 census, the city's {{population}} was 52,838, while the total {{of the city and}} surrounding metropolitan area was 98,461. Grand Forks, along with its twin city of East Grand Forks, Minnesota, forms the center of the Grand Forks, ND-MN Metropolitan Statistical Area, which <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>called</b> Greater Grand Forks or The Grand Cities.|$|E
5|$|LARP {{has also}} been {{referred}} to as live role-playing (LRP), interactive literature, and free form role-playing. Some of these terms are still in common use; however, LARP has become the most commonly accepted term. It is sometimes written in lowercase, as larp. The live action in LARP is analogous to the term live action used in film and video to differentiate works with human actors from animation. Playing a LARP <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>called</b> larping, and one who does it is a larper.|$|E
5|$|Nitrogen gas is an {{industrial}} gas {{produced by the}} fractional distillation of liquid air, or by mechanical means using gaseous air (pressurised reverse osmosis membrane or pressure swing adsorption). Nitrogen gas generators using membranes or pressure swing adsorption (PSA) are typically more cost and energy efficient than bulk delivered nitrogen. Commercial nitrogen is often a byproduct of air-processing for industrial concentration of oxygen for steelmaking and other purposes. When supplied compressed in cylinders it <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>called</b> OFN (oxygen-free nitrogen). Commercial-grade nitrogen already contains at most 20ppm oxygen, and specially purified grades containing at most 2ppm oxygen and 10ppm argon are also available.|$|E
50|$|Graded derivations of superalgebras (i.e. Z2-graded algebras) <b>are</b> <b>often</b> <b>called</b> superderivations.|$|R

5|$|No longer deemed {{politically}} controversial, ao dai {{fashion design}} {{is supported by}} the Vietnamese government. It <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>called</b> áo dài Việt Nam to link it to patriotic feelings. Designer Le Si Hoang is a celebrity in Vietnam and his shop in Saigon is the place to visit for those who admire the dress. In Hanoi, tourists get fitted with ao dai on Luong Van Can Street. The elegant city of Huế in the central region is known for its ao dai, nón lá (leaf hats), and well-dressed women.|$|E
5|$|A {{pneumothorax}} is {{an abnormal}} collection of {{air in the}} pleural space between the lung and the chest wall. Symptoms typically include sudden onset of sharp, one-sided chest pain and shortness of breath. In a minority of cases the amount of air in the chest increases when a one-way valve is formed by an area of damaged tissue, leading to a tension pneumothorax. This condition can cause a steadily worsening oxygen shortage and low blood pressure. Unless reversed by effective treatment, it can result in death. Very rarely both lungs may be affected by a pneumothorax. It <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>called</b> a collapsed lung, although that term may also refer to atelectasis.|$|E
5|$|Freedom from Fear is {{the last}} of a series of four oil {{paintings}} entitled Four Freedoms, painted by Norman Rockwell. The works were inspired by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in a State of the Union Address delivered to the 77th United States Congress on January 6, 1941; the speech itself <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>called</b> the Four Freedoms. The Four Freedoms theme was eventually incorporated into the Atlantic Charter, and it became part of the charter of the United Nations. The series of paintings was printed in The Saturday Evening Post, accompanied by essays from noted writers, on four consecutive weeks in early 1943: Freedom of Speech (February 20), Freedom of Worship (February 27), Freedom from Want (March 6) and Freedom from Fear (March 13). Eventually, the series was widely distributed in poster form and became instrumental in the U.S. Government's Second War Bond Drive.|$|E

5|$|Heterodontosaurids {{are named}} for their {{strongly}} heterodont dentition. There were three premaxillary teeth. In the Early Jurassic Abrictosaurus, Heterodontosaurus, and Lycorhinus, {{the first two}} premaxillary teeth were small and conical, while the much larger third tooth resembled the canines of carnivoran mammals and <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>called</b> the caniniform or 'tusk'. A lower caniniform, larger than the upper, took the first position in the dentary and was accommodated by the arched diastema of the upper jaw when the mouth was closed. These caniniforms were serrated on both the anterior and posterior edges in Heterodontosaurus and Lycorhinus, while those of Abrictosaurus bore serrations only on the anterior edge. In the Early Cretaceous Echinodon, {{there may have been}} two upper caniniforms, which were on the maxilla rather than the premaxilla, and Fruitadens from the Late Jurassic may have had two lower caniniforms on each dentary.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the stands}} have more {{traditional}} names, but {{have since been}} renamed because of sponsorship deals. The JCT600 Stand is the ground's main stand, and <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>called</b> the latter by fans, but {{is also known as}} the Sunwin stand owing to the former sponsor. The Kop, was the former standing area, and its name was derived, like at many stadia across the country, from the Battle of Spion Kop. The East Stand, sponsored by Northern Commercials, is also named the Midland Road stand, because of the road {{on that side of the}} ground. The TL Dallas Stand is also known as the Bradford end, because it is nearest to the city centre.|$|E
5|$|Only {{the most}} highly skilled Chacoans shaped and set stone; others carried {{supplies}} and mixed mortar. The width of a given wall was determined by its place in a structure. The first story of a two-story wall is always wider than the second. Chacoan walls are often called core-and-veneer, but only the widest walls had cores. The Chacoans tried to build walls with two flush faces, but because the stones were typically quite small, to build a wider wall they built up a space between the two faces; this spacing <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>called</b> the core. In most walls, the core consisted of roughly shaped stone or rubble laid {{at the same time}} as the two faces. In others, the faces were built up independently, and the core packed between them. Chacoan walls derive their stability from the degree of contact between stones in the faces and the width of the wall itself, not from the strength of the core.|$|E

5|$|Past {{experiences}} {{or general}} knowledge <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>called</b> upon in conversation, {{so it is}} a useful context for children to learn words. Recalling past experiences allows the child to call upon their own visual, tactical, oral, and/or auditory references. For example, if a child once went to a zoo and saw an elephant, but did not know the word elephant, an adult could later help the child recall this event, describing the size and color of the animal, how big its ears were, its trunk, and the sound it made, then using the word elephant to refer to the animal. Calling upon prior knowledge is used not only in conversation, but often in book reading as well to help explain what is happening in a story by relating it back to the child's own experiences.|$|E
5|$|Penetration follows attachment: Virions {{enter the}} host cell through receptor-mediated {{endocytosis}} or membrane fusion. This <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>called</b> viral entry. The infection {{of plant and}} fungal cells {{is different from that}} of animal cells. Plants have a rigid cell wall made of cellulose, and fungi one of chitin, so most viruses can get inside these cells only after trauma to the cell wall. However, nearly all plant viruses (such as tobacco mosaic virus) can also move directly from cell to cell, in the form of single-stranded nucleoprotein complexes, through pores called plasmodesmata. Bacteria, like plants, have strong cell walls that a virus must breach to infect the cell. However, given that bacterial cell walls are much less thick than plant cell walls due to their much smaller size, some viruses have evolved mechanisms that inject their genome into the bacterial cell across the cell wall, while the viral capsid remains outside.|$|E
5|$|The Sautrāntika school held {{a form of}} phenomenalism {{that saw}} the world as imperceptible. It held that {{external}} objects exist only as a support for cognition, which can only apprehend mental representations. This influenced the later Yogacara school of Mahayana Buddhism. The Yogācāra school <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>called</b> the mind-only school because of its internalist stance that consciousness is the ultimate existing reality. The works of Vasubandhu have often been interpreted as arguing for some form of Idealism. Vasubandhu uses the dream argument and a mereological refutation of atomism to attack the reality of external objects {{as anything other than}} mental entities. Scholarly interpretations of Vasubandhu's philosophy vary widely, and include phenomenalism, neutral monism and realist phenomenology.|$|E
