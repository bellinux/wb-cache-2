Call had a generally negative critical reception, largely due to a perceived lack of synergy with the film and the franchise. Roger Ebert praised Ryder's acting, but felt {{that she did not}} bring a strong presence or purpose to the film except as a <b>familiar</b> <b>face</b> to younger viewers. Nordling agreed in a 2012 Ain't It Cool News analysis, saying that Call's synthetic origin is unnecessary and her only role is that of a surrogate audience.|$|E
5|$|In September 1933, Bruce was {{appointed}} by Lyons to replace the ailing Sir Granville Ryrie as High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, giving him ambassadorial rank. He formally resigned from parliament on 7 October 1933. Bruce would excel in the new post, becoming a trusted confidant among Conservative politicians and a <b>familiar</b> <b>face</b> in British government circles, which led to him at one point considering entering British politics formally. Bruce was particularly close to Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin, with whom he frequently consulted, and was notably influential in pressing for Edward VIII's abdication in 1936. His importance and power in London was {{due in part to}} the free rein that Lyons gave him a rarity in the history of the position. Combined with the turmoil and frequent ministerial changes within the Commonwealth Department of External Affairs, Bruce was generally credited as Australia's most influential and credible international representative during his posting, often determining matters of foreign policy in his own right.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigated}} whether personally <b>familiar</b> <b>faces</b> are preferentially {{processed in}} conditions of reduced attentional resources {{and in the}} absence of conscious awareness. In the first experiment, we used Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP) to test the susceptibility of <b>familiar</b> <b>faces</b> and faces of strangers to the attentional blink. In the second experiment, we used continuous flash interocular suppression to render stimuli invisible and measured face detection time for personally <b>familiar</b> <b>faces</b> as compared to faces of strangers. In both experiments we found an advantage for detection of personally <b>familiar</b> <b>faces</b> as compared to faces of strangers. Our data suggest that the identity of faces is processed with reduced attentional resources and even in the absence of awareness. Our results show that this facilitated processing of <b>familiar</b> <b>faces</b> cannot be attributed to detection of low-level visual features and that a learned unique configuration of facial features can influence preconscious perceptual processing...|$|R

The predictions of these models were assessed in recognition tasks with unfamiliar, famous, and personally <b>familiar</b> <b>faces.</b> Whereas larger autonomic responses were only triggered for personally <b>familiar</b> <b>faces,</b> priming effects in reaction times to these faces, presumably reflecting cognitive recognition processes, were equal to those of famous faces. Activation of stored structural representations of <b>familiar</b> <b>faces</b> (face recognition units) was assessed by recording the N 250 r component in event-related brain potentials. Face recognition unit activation increased from unfamiliar over famous to personally <b>familiar</b> <b>faces,</b> suggesting that there are stronger representations for personally familiar than for famous faces. Because the topographies of the N 250 r for personally and famous faces were indistinguishable, a similar network of face recognition units can be assumed for both types of faces...|$|R

40|$|International audienceInvestigations of {{the neural}} {{correlates}} of face recognition have typically used old/new paradigms where subjects {{learn to recognize}} new faces or identify famous <b>faces.</b> <b>Familiar</b> <b>faces,</b> however, include one's own face, partner's and parents' faces. Using event-related fMRI, we examined the neural correlates of these personally <b>familiar</b> <b>faces.</b> Ten participants were presented with photographs of own, partner, parents, famous and unfamiliar faces and responded to a distinct target. Whole brain, two regions of interest (fusiform gyrus and cingulate gyrus), and multiple linear regression analyses were conducted. Compared with baseline, all <b>familiar</b> <b>faces</b> activated the fusiform gyrus; own faces also activated occipital regions and the precuneus; partner faces activated similar areas, but in addition, the parahippocampal gyrus, middle superior temporal gyri and middle frontal gyrus. Compared with unfamiliar <b>faces,</b> only personally <b>familiar</b> <b>faces</b> activated the cingulate gyrus {{and the extent of}} activation varied with face category. Partner faces also activated the insula, amygdala and thalamus. Regions of interest analyses and laterality indices showed anatomical distinctions of processing the personally <b>familiar</b> <b>faces</b> within the fusiform and cingulate gyri. Famous faces were right lateralized whereas personally <b>familiar</b> <b>faces,</b> particularly partner and own faces, elicited bilateral activations.

40|$|An {{experiment}} is reported {{in which participants}} matched complete images of unfamiliar, moderately familiar, and highly <b>familiar</b> <b>faces</b> with simultaneously presented images of internal and external features.

500|$|In the 1966 NBA Playoffs, the Sixers again met the Celtics, and for {{the first}} time had home-court advantage. However, Boston easily won the first two games on the road, winning 115–96 and 114–93; Chamberlain played within his usual range, but his {{supporting}} cast shot under 40%. This caused sports journalist Joe McGinnis to comment: [...] "The Celtics played like champions and the Sixers just played." [...] In Game 3, Chamberlain scored 31 points and 27 rebounds for an important road win, and the next day, coach Schayes planned to hold a joint team practice. However, Chamberlain said he was [...] "too tired" [...] to attend, and even refused Schayes' plea to at least show up and shoot a few foul shots with the team. In Game 4, Boston won 114–108. Prior to Game 5, Chamberlain was nowhere to be found, skipping practice and being non-accessible. Outwardly, Schayes defended his star center as [...] "excused from practice", but his teammates knew the truth and were much less forgiving. In Game 5 itself, Chamberlain was superb, scoring 46 points and grabbing 34 rebounds, but the Celtics won the game 120–112 and the series. Cherry is highly critical of Chamberlain: while conceding he was the only Sixers player who performed in the series, he pointed out his unprofessional, egotistical behavior as being a bad example for his teammates. Prior to the 1966–67 NBA season, the friendly but unassertive Schayes was replaced by a <b>familiar</b> <b>face,</b> the crafty but firm Alex Hannum. In what Cherry calls a tumultuous locker room meeting, Hannum addressed several key issues he observed during the last season, several of them putting Chamberlain in an unfavorable light. Sixers forward Chet Walker testified that on several occasions, players had to pull Chamberlain and Hannum apart to prevent a fistfight. Fellow forward Billy Cunningham observed that Hannum [...] "never backed down" [...] and [...] "showed who was the boss". By doing this, he won Chamberlain's respect. When emotions cooled off, Hannum pointed out to Chamberlain that he was on the same page in trying to win a title; but to pull this off, he – like his teammates – had to [...] "act like a man" [...] both on and off the court. Concerning basketball, he persuaded him to change his style of play. Loaded with several other players who could score, such as future Hall-of-Famers Hal Greer and newcomer Billy Cunningham, Hannum wanted Chamberlain to concentrate more on defense.|$|E

40|$|Early {{processing}} {{stages in the}} perception of <b>familiar</b> and unfamiliar <b>faces</b> were studied in four experiments by varying the type of available facial information in a four alternative forced choice recognition task. Both reaction time and recognition accuracy served as dependent measures. The observed data revealed an asymmetry in processing <b>familiar</b> and unfamiliar <b>faces.</b> A markedly weak inversion effect and strong blurring effect suggest a limited usage of spatial relations within early {{processing stages}} of unfamiliar faces. Recognition performance for whole <b>familiar</b> <b>faces</b> did not deteriorate due to blurring or the presentation of isolated internal features, suggesting a low level of representation for featural properties of <b>familiar</b> <b>faces.</b> Based on the data we propose that recognition of <b>familiar</b> <b>faces</b> relies much more on spatial relations among features, particularly internal features, than on featural characteristics.

40|$|AbstractA viewpoint-dependent aftereffect occurs after {{prolonged}} {{viewing of}} a stimulus {{of a particular}} orientation, {{with the result that}} the test image is perceived to be facing away from the adapting orientation. Prior psychophysical work has led to the suggestion that the visual brain encodes a limited range of viewpoint information with regard to complex images. In this study, we investigated whether <b>familiar</b> <b>faces</b> were susceptible to a viewpoint aftereffect. <b>Familiar</b> <b>faces</b> are believed to be represented in a view-invariant manner, whereas unfamiliar faces are represented in a viewpoint-dependent manner. Adaptation to both <b>familiar</b> and unfamiliar <b>faces</b> influenced the perception of viewpoint of subsequent face images. However, category-specific transfer of a repulsive viewpoint-dependent aftereffect was observed with unfamiliar faces.
