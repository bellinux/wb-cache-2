40|$|Understanding {{the biology}} behind the epidemicity and {{persistence}} of Acinetobacter baumannii {{in the hospital}} environment is critical to control outbreaks of infection. This study investigated the contributing factors to the epidemicity of carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii (CRAB) sequence type (ST) 191 by comparing the differences in biofilm formation, expression of biofilm-associated genes, and resistance to desiccation between major <b>epidemic</b> (n = 16), minor <b>epidemic</b> (n = 12), and sporadic (n = 12) clones. Biofilm mass was significantly greater in the major <b>epidemic</b> than the minor <b>epidemic</b> and sporadic clones. Major and minor <b>epidemic</b> clones expressed biofilm-associated genes, abaI, bap, pgaABCD, and csuA/BABCDE, higher than the sporadic clones in sessile conditions. The csuC, csuD, and csuE genes were more highly expressed in the major <b>epidemic</b> than minor <b>epidemic</b> clones. Interestingly, minor <b>epidemic</b> clones expressed more biofilm-associated genes than the major <b>epidemic</b> clone under planktonic conditions. Major <b>epidemic</b> clones were more resistant to desiccation than minor <b>epidemic</b> and sporadic clones on day 21. In conclusion, the <b>epidemic</b> CRAB ST 191 clones exhibit a higher capacity to form biofilms, express the biofilm-associated genes under sessile conditions, and resist desiccation than sporadic clones. These phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of CRAB ST 191 {{may account for the}} epidemicity of specific CRAB ST 191 clones in the hospital...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we analyze dynamic {{switching}} networks, {{wherein the}} networks switch arbitrarily among {{a set of}} topologies. For this class of dynamic networks, we derive an <b>epidemic</b> threshold, considering the SIS <b>epidemic</b> model. First, an <b>epidemic</b> probabilistic model is developed assuming independence between states of nodes. We identify {{the conditions under which}} the <b>epidemic</b> dies out by linearizing the underlying dynamical system and analyzing its asymptotic stability around the origin. The concept of joint spectral radius is then used to derive the <b>epidemic</b> threshold, which is later validated using several networks (Watts-Strogatz, Barabasi-Albert, MIT reality mining graphs, Regular, and Gilbert). A simplified version of the <b>epidemic</b> threshold is proposed for undirected networks. Moreover, in the case of static networks, the derived <b>epidemic</b> threshold is shown to match conventional analytical results. Then, analytical results for the <b>epidemic</b> threshold of dynamic networksare proved to be applicable to periodic networks. For dynamic regular networks, we demonstrate that the <b>epidemic</b> threshold is identical to the <b>epidemic</b> threshold for static regular networks. An upper bound for the <b>epidemic</b> spread probability in dynamic Gilbert networks is also derived and verified using simulation.

40|$|Social {{influence}} in online social networks bears resemblance to <b>epidemic</b> spread in networks {{and has been}} studied through epidemiological models. The <b>epidemic</b> threshold is a fundamental metric used to evaluate <b>epidemic</b> spread in networks. Previous work {{has shown that the}} <b>epidemic</b> threshold of a network is exactly the inverse of the largest eigenvalue of its adjacency matrix. In this work, however, we indicate that such a threshold ignores spatial dependence among nodes and hence underestimates the actual <b>epidemic</b> threshold. Focusing on regular graphs, we analytically derive a more accurate <b>epidemic</b> threshold based on spatial Markov dependence. Our model shows that the <b>epidemic</b> threshold indeed depends on the spatial correlation coefficient between neighboring nodes and decreases with the death rate. Through both analysis and simulations, we show that our proposed <b>epidemic</b> threshold incorporates a certain spatial dependence and thus achieves a greater accuracy in characterizing the actual <b>epidemic</b> threshold in regular graphs.
