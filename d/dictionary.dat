25|$|Chinese {{character}} <b>dictionaries</b> often allow {{users to}} locate entries in several ways. Many Chinese, Japanese, and Korean <b>dictionaries</b> of Chinese characters list characters in radical order: characters are grouped together by radical, and radicals containing fewer strokes come before radicals containing more strokes (radical-and-stroke sorting). Under each radical, characters are listed by their {{total number of}} strokes. It is often also possible to search for characters by sound, using pinyin (in Chinese <b>dictionaries),</b> zhuyin (in Taiwanese <b>dictionaries),</b> kana (in Japanese <b>dictionaries)</b> or hangul (in Korean <b>dictionaries).</b> Most <b>dictionaries</b> also allow searches by total number of strokes, and individual <b>dictionaries</b> often allow other search methods as well.|$|R

40|$|Previously, {{researchers}} {{examined the}} effects of utilising monolingual <b>dictionaries</b> compared to bilingual and bilingualised <b>dictionaries</b> in an EFL learning environment as to their efficacy in improving culture-specific skills in translation. This study was set to investigate the comparative effects of using only monolingual <b>dictionaries</b> as opposed to using bilingualised <b>dictionaries</b> during vocabulary acquisition in a Translation course. Participants consisted of 60 Level II students of English. A test comprising 100 low-frequency words and 100 sentences manipulating each word as a translational writing task was administered {{at the end of the}} semester. Three experimental groups, one studying vocabulary with monolingual <b>dictionaries,</b> another with bilingual <b>dictionaries,</b> and a third with bilingualised <b>dictionaries</b> were used for checking the efficacy with which any/all of the three types of <b>dictionaries</b> can best help students acquire new lexicon. The study tested participants on their comprehension of and ability to use these words using sentences of their own on translational writing tasks. Results suggest that bilingualised <b>dictionaries</b> are more effective than monolingual and bilingual <b>dictionaries</b> and that bilingualised <b>dictionaries</b> are more effective than monolingual <b>dictionaries,</b> the last two <b>dictionaries</b> being the least effective. Suggestions for further work and implications for ELT pedagogy have been forwarded at the end...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{reproduction}} {{of culture in}} <b>dictionaries</b> constitutes {{one of the fundamental}} prob-lems of lexicographers today.

This article attempts to discuss the relevance of the {{reproduction of}} Gabonese cultural aspects in <b>dictionaries</b> in French and the Gabonese languages. One of the main problems the compilers of these <b>dictionaries</b> encountered was the transfer and the translation of some cultural aspects.

40|$|CD-ROM <b>dictionaries</b> are <b>dictionaries</b> on {{a compact}} disk {{read-only}} medium, which basically contain {{the same information}} as their paper counterparts. During the last ten years, {{a significant number of}} CD-ROM <b>dictionaries</b> have appeared on the market. Given that the content of CD-ROM <b>dictionaries</b> is almost identical to that of paper <b>dictionaries,</b> in what way do they differ from their traditional counterparts? Do CD-ROM <b>dictionaries</b> offer any specific advantages over paper <b>dictionaries</b> for translators? This thesis will address these and other questions. Before establishing {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} CD-ROM <b>dictionaries,</b> we had to examine their main characteristics. We first established various criteria for evaluating the characteristics of ten CD-ROM <b>dictionaries.</b> These criteria, in tabular form, were used to evaluate the <b>dictionaries</b> in terms of user-friendliness, presentation, content, search capabilities, text management options, and technical environment. However, these tables say little about users' consultation and search habits. We therefore administered a test to twelve subjects in order to gather data on the use of three CD-ROM and three paper <b>dictionaries.</b> We also asked six of these subjects to fill out a questionnaire in order to obtain their feedback on both types of <b>dictionaries.</b> Using the tables and test results, we were able to draw a comparison between CD-ROM and paper <b>dictionaries</b> and determine their advantages and disadvantages. This study shows that CD-ROM <b>dictionaries</b> have definite advantages over their paper counterparts: flexible consultation, easy handling, speedy navigation, powerful and varied search capabilities, and useful text management options. Nevertheless, they have some considerable drawbacks, especially regarding technical aspects. In conclusion, it is safe to say that CD-ROM <b>dictionaries</b> have the potential to increase translators' productivity as long as translators know how to take full advantage of the dictionaries' capabilities...|$|R
