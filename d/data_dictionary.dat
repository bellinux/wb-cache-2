2500|$|Although Btrieve {{was fairly}} popular, {{it was an}} API {{database}} engine. The killer-app database manager on the PC, dBase II and its successors, were database management systems (DBMS) {{which could be used}} either as a free-standing, general-purpose application, or a database programming language. Btrieve was also more expensive than dBase, although run-time licensing was free of charge. Btrieve grew to a developer base of over 5,000 users and was widely used in the financial area. The company took some time to create a user-interface for the product, however in 1984 they released Xtrieve, a menu-driven program that used a new [...]DDF <b>data</b> <b>dictionary</b> to enforce relational database rules.|$|E
2500|$|In November 1990, Wang {{announced}} their first personal computers running Unix. Previously, Wang's {{presence in the}} UNIX and open systems markets had been modest. In 1987, Wang developed a new typesetting system in conjunction with Arlington MA-based Texet Corp. The system used Xerox printers and UNIX workstations from Sun, but the product vanished before coming to market, partially because few Wang employees could use or support UNIX. UNIX ran on the VSInteractive Systems first ported IN/ix (their IBM360 version of SYS5 UNIX) to run in a VSOS Virtual machine circa 1985, and then Wang engineers completed the port so that it ran [...] "native" [...] on the VS hardware soon thereafterbut performance was always sub-par as UNIX was never {{a good fit for}} the inherently batch-mode nature of the VS hardware, and the line-at-a-time processing approach taken by the VS workstations; indeed, the workstation code had to be largely rewritten to bundle up each keystroke into a frame to be sent back to the host when running UNIX so that [...] "tty" [...] style processing could be implemented. PACE, which offered its <b>data</b> <b>dictionary,</b> excellent referential integrity, and speedy application development, {{was in the process of}} being ported to UNIX under the name OPEN Pace. A client server RDBMS model, built on the original product's ideology, OPEN Pace was demonstrated at the North American PACE User Group Conferences in both Boston and Chicago. OPEN Pace, along with a new Windows-based word processor called UpWord (which was at the time considered a strong contender to retake Wang's original market leadership from Microsoft), were touted as their new direction. However, after a marketing study suggested that it would require large capital investments in order to be viable competitors against Microsoft, both products were simply abandoned.|$|E

Skills needed to navigate the database include the ability to browse database tables, to link multiple tables in a database query, and to apply simple logic in a database query for extracting the appropriate information. The database {{was developed in the}} PC-based ParadoxJ 4. 0 database management system but may be used in other relational database management packages provided they are compatible with the electronic file formats. Database files are provided on CD-ROM in two formats, the original ParadoxJ 4. 0 format and a FoxProJ/DBase IIIJ format. Comprehensive documentation of electronic files is provided in this chapter, including field definitions for database tables and diagrams of database linkages. Practical examples for common queries and applications of the database are provided in this chapter. 3. 2 <b>Data</b> <b>Dictionaries</b> and Glossaries <b>Data</b> <b>dictionaries</b> for all database tables are provided in this report.
