40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the impact of}} decreasing MFI interest rates on household deposits and saving goals in 12 Monetary Union member countries in the years 2009 - 2015. It analyses tendencies in household <b>deposits</b> (overnight, <b>with</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>maturity</b> and redeemable at notice), and attempts to link them with certain household saving motives (target, retirement and precautionary). The paper identifies those deposit categories which appeared as sensitive to declining interest rates and indicates the Eurozone countries whose populations are expected to revise their savings plans. Precise implications are drawn for target saving motives of households in Austria, Cyprus and Malta. However, {{in the case of}} two other motives, the analysis does not conclude on the impact of decreasing MFI interest rates...|$|R

40|$|In The Role of Deposit Insurance in the Emerging Financial Services Industry, Chairman William M. Isaac of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) {{suggests}} that major {{reform of the}} federal depository insurance system is necessary to assure sound banking practices {{in a period of}} widespread deregulation of financial markets. Isaac identifies three recent changes in the financial services industry which have created a need to re-evaluate the role of deposit insurance: expansion of the product lines which banks are allowed to offer, partial removal of constraints on interstate banking, and gradual elimination of interest rate ceilings on bank <b>deposits.</b> We <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> Isaac that these changes present a serious challenge to the present system of financial services regulation; we disagree, however, with his proposed reforms...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the possibility of}} on-site multi-element analysis of part-per-million order Cu 2 + and Zn 2 + in an aqueous solution by underwater laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (underwater LIBS) of a Pt electrode on which Cu 2 + and Zn 2 + are electrodeposited in advance. Atomic emission lines of Cu and Zn are simultaneously observed. To apply a calibration-free LIBS (CF-LIBS) approach to the present system, we estimate the Zn/Cu ratio in the laser ablation plasma from the emission spectra. Although the Zn/Cu ratio in the <b>deposit</b> <b>agrees</b> <b>with</b> the ratio in the solution, the ratio in the plasma considerably deviates from the ratio in the deposit. We demonstrate the possibility of quantitative analysis even {{in such a case}} by correcting the deviation using a simple model considering heat propagation and thermal evaporation during liquid-phase laser ablation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A new {{vertebrate}} tracksite {{in southeastern}} Coahuila, northern Mrxico, {{known as the}} E 1 Pelillal tracksite (Latest Campanian, Cerro del Pueblo Formation) has yielded an important ichno-fauna that includes the tracks of turtles, crocodilians, a small theropod inosaur, a mammal-like organism and the tracks of pterosaurs. The pterosaurian manus impressions share an extraordinary similarity, in size and morphology, with the Jurassic ichnogenus Pteraichnus Stokes 1957 and are referred to Pteraichnus sp.; however, the pes impressions differ {{in that they are}} rather very elon-gated. According to the geological features and ichnofauna the E 1 Pelillal tracksite represents a shallow, freshwater o lacustrine <b>deposit,</b> which <b>agrees</b> <b>with</b> our knowledge about he habitat prefer-ence of Cretaceous pterosaurs. This newly discovered tracksite in southeastern Coahuila, Mexico, offers great potential for palaeoichnological research and is thus becoming important in the under-standing of the palaeoecosystems during the Late Cretaceous insouthern North America...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study of}} FeNi-based thin film materials <b>deposited</b> <b>with</b> Mo, Al and B using a co-sputtering process. The existence of soft magnetic properties in combination with strong magneto-mechanical coupling makes these materials attractive for sensor applications. Our findings show that FeNi <b>deposited</b> <b>with</b> Mo or Al yields magnetically soft materials and that <b>depositing</b> <b>with</b> B further increases the softness. The out-of-plane magnetic anisotropy of FeNi thin films is reduced by <b>depositing</b> <b>with</b> Al and completely removed by <b>depositing</b> <b>with</b> B. The effect of <b>depositing</b> <b>with</b> Mo {{is dependent on the}} Mo concentration. The coercivity of FeNiMo and FeNiAl is reduced to less than a half of that of FeNi, and a value as low as 40 A/m is obtained for FeNiB. The surfaces of the obtained FeNiMo, FeNiAl and FeNiB thin films reveal very different morphologies. The surface of FeNiMo shows nano-cracks, while the FeNiAl films show large clusters and fewer nano-cracks. When FeNi is <b>deposited</b> <b>with</b> B, a very smooth morphology is obtained. The crystal structure of FeNiMo strongly depends on the depositant concentration and changes into an amorphous structure at a higher Mo level. FeNiAl thin films remain polycrystalline, even at a very high concentration of Al, and FeNiB films are amorphous, even at a very low concentration of B. 2014 by the authors...|$|R
