The present study was designed to investigate the reactivity of IgE in bovine gelatin-sensitive children to gelatins from various animals, and the antigenic cross-reactivity between the gelatins. Serum samples taken from 10 children who showed anaphylaxis to vaccines containing bovine gelatin were used in this study. The level of anti-bovine gelatin IgE in these serum samples ranged from 11 · 0 to 251 Ua/ml. The IgE in most of the children reacted to kangaroo and mouse gelatins, to which they had had little or no exposure as a food or a vaccine stabilizer. The IgE binding to kangaroo and mouse gelatins was completely inhibited by bovine gelatin, whereas reciprocal inhibition was not complete, indicating that antigenic cross-reactivity is present between the mammalian gelatins. Only one child had strong IgE reactivity to <b>fish</b> <b>gelatins,</b> and this reactivity was not inhibited by bovine gelatin, indicating that no antigenic cross-reactivity exists between bovine and <b>fish</b> <b>gelatins.</b> Most of the children who displayed sensitivity to bovine gelatin showed IgE reactivity to other mammalian gelatins.

Low molecular weight <b>fish</b> <b>gelatin</b> (LMW–FG, ∼ 55 kDa) and high molecular weight <b>fish</b> <b>gelatin</b> (HMW–FG, 120 kDa) were used to prepare 20 wt% corn oil-in-water emulsions (pH 3. 0, 10 mM imidazole-acetate buffer). Emulsions with monomodal particle size distributions and small mean droplet diameters (d 43 ≈ 0. 35 μm for LMW–FG and 0. 71 μm for HMW–FG) could be produced at protein concentrations ≥ 4. 0 wt%. However, optical microscopy showed that there was always a small population of large droplets present in the emulsions after homogenization and some oil destabilization (≥ 2 wt%).
