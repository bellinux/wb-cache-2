5|$|Although no fossil {{evidence}} has been dated within the last 1,000 years, the hippopotamus has been surprisingly common in the oral legends of the Malagasy. In 1648, Étienne de Flacourt became the French governor of Madagascar and {{he wrote in his}} Histoire de la grande isle de Madagascar about hearing stories from the Malagasy about an animal called the mangarsahoc which closely resembled the hippopotamus. In different regions of Madagascar, stories were recorded of the tsy-aomby-aomby, the omby-rano, and the laloumena, all animals that resembled <b>hippopotami,</b> but few other animals on the island. In 1902, a colonial administrator named Raybaud asserted that stories he heard in the highlands could only be about Malagasy hippos still living as late as 1878. The strength of these oral traditions led the IUCN to classify the Malagasy <b>hippopotami</b> as recent extinctions.|$|E

5|$|Cecil House, {{also called}} Exeter House or Burghley House, {{was built in}} the 16th century by Lord Burghley as an {{expansion}} of an existing Tudor house. Exeter House was demolished in 1676 and Exeter Exchange built on the site. A menagerie was built on the upper floors in 1773, which was later run by Edward Cross, who housed lions, tigers, monkeys and <b>hippopotami.</b> In 1826, an elephant, Chunee, nearly broke free from its cage and had to be destroyed; the skeleton was later put on display. The exchange was demolished in 1829, with the menagerie moving to the Surrey Zoological Gardens, and replaced by Exeter Hall, noted for its Evangelical meetings. This was demolished in 1907, and the site is now occupied by the Strand Palace Hotel.|$|E
5000|$|Several {{species of}} small hippopotamids have also become extinct in the Mediterranean {{in the late}} Pleistocene or early Holocene. Though these species are {{sometimes}} known as [...] "pygmy hippopotami" [...] they are not believed to be closely related to C. liberiensis. These include the Cretan dwarf <b>hippopotamus</b> (<b>Hippopotamus</b> creutzburgi), the Sicilian <b>hippopotamus</b> (<b>Hippopotamus</b> pentlandi), the Maltese <b>hippopotamus</b> (<b>Hippopotamus</b> melitensis) and the Cyprus dwarf <b>hippopotamus</b> (<b>Hippopotamus</b> minor).|$|R
5|$|Three {{species of}} <b>hippopotamus,</b> the European <b>hippopotamus</b> (<b>Hippopotamus</b> antiquus), <b>Hippopotamus</b> major and <b>Hippopotamus</b> gorgops, ranged {{throughout}} continental Europe and the British Isles. All three species became extinct {{before the last}} glaciation. Ancestors of European hippos {{found their way to}} many islands of the Mediterranean Sea during the Pleistocene. The Pleistocene also saw a number of dwarf species evolve on several Mediterranean islands, including Crete (<b>Hippopotamus</b> creutzburgi), Cyprus (the Cyprus dwarf <b>hippopotamus,</b> <b>Hippopotamus</b> minor), Malta (<b>Hippopotamus</b> melitensis), and Sicily (<b>Hippopotamus</b> pentlandi). Of these, the Cyprus dwarf <b>hippopotamus</b> survived {{until the end of the}} Pleistocene or early Holocene. Evidence from an archaeological site, Aetokremnos, continues to cause debate on whether or not the species was encountered, and was driven to extinction, by man.|$|R

5|$|Dio and Martial record some of {{the animals}} that were exhibited. Dio notes a hunt {{involving}} cranes and another involving four elephants, and Martial mentions elephants, lions, leopards, at least one tiger, hares, pigs, bulls, bears, wild boar, a rhinoceros, buffalo and bison (most likely the wisent). Other exotic animals {{may have been used}} but are not mentioned; ostriches, camels and crocodiles were commonly used in the games. Giraffes are unlikely to have been featured; Julius Caesar had brought a single giraffe to Rome in 46 BC. Another is not recorded in Europe until the Medici giraffe in 1486, although they were first seen in Rome in 58 BC, and were impressive enough to be detailed in the games of Augustus and Commodus, {{there is no mention of}} <b>hippopotami</b> at Titus' games.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, Norton played Mike Shiner, a prickly Broadway {{actor in}} the black comedy film Birdman and was {{nominated}} for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for the role. On February 20, 2014, {{it was announced that}} Norton was directing Motherless Brooklyn. In June 2014, Norton's Class 5 Films and RatPac Entertainment acquired the film rights to the non-fiction article American Hippopotamus, by Jon Mooallem, about the meat shortage in the U.S. in 1910 and the attempts made by Major Frederick Russell Burnham, Captain Fritz Joubert Duquesne and Congressman Robert Broussard to import <b>hippopotami</b> into the Louisiana bayous and persuade Americans to eat them. The film highlights the rivalry between Burnham and Duquesne, two famous spies who had been under orders to assassinate each other. Norton, William Migliore and Brett Ratner were to produce this feature film.|$|E
5|$|The {{forms in}} which the gods are shown, {{although}} diverse, are limited in many ways. Many creatures that are widespread in Egypt were never used in divine iconography. Others could represent many deities, often because these deities had major characteristics in common. Bulls and rams were associated with virility, cows and falcons with the sky, <b>hippopotami</b> with maternal protection, felines with the sun god, and serpents with both danger and renewal. Animals that were absent from Egypt {{in the early stages}} of its history were not used as divine images. For instance, the horse, which was only introduced in the Second Intermediate Period (c. 1650–1550 BC), never represented a god. Similarly, the clothes worn by anthropomorphic deities in most periods changed little from the styles used in the Old Kingdom: a kilt, false beard, and often a shirt for male gods and a long, tight-fitting dress for goddesses.|$|E

5|$|Much of this {{acceptance}} {{has been}} based on the erroneous assumption that the canines are grooved instead of ridged; grooved canines in Euchambersia would parallel the fangs of various venomous snakes as well as the venom-delivering incisors of the living solenodons. This interpretation, which has consistently appeared in literature published after 1986, was determined by Julien Benoit {{to be the result of}} the propagation of Broom's overly reconstructed diagram of the skull, without the context of the actual specimens. This line of evidence has been raised to support the necessity of a re-evaluation the hypothesis of a venomous bite in Euchambersia. Additionally, Benoit argued that grooved and ridged canines are not necessarily associated with venomous animals either, as shown by their presence in <b>hippopotami,</b> muntjacs, and baboons, in which they play a role in grooming or sharpening the teeth; in the latter two, ridged canines are also accompanied by a distinct fossa in front of the eye, which is entirely unconnected with venom. Furthermore, grooved and ridged teeth in non-venomous snakes are used to reduce suctional drag when capturing slippery prey like fish or invertebrates.|$|E

As a result, the ecology of Lake Kariba is vibrant. A number of fish species have been introduced to the lake, notably the sardine-like kapenta (transported from Lake Tanganyika), which now supports a thriving commercial fishery. Other inhabitants of Lake Kariba include Nile crocodiles and <b>hippopotami.</b>|$|E
25|$|Malta {{stands on}} an {{underwater}} ridge that extends from North Africa to Sicily. At {{some time in}} the distant past, Malta was submerged, as shown by marine fossils embedded in rock in the highest points of Malta. As the ridge was pushed up and the Strait of Gibraltar closed through tectonic activity, the sea level was lower, and Malta was on a bridge of dry land that extended between the two continents, surrounded by large lakes. Some caverns in Malta have revealed bones of elephants, <b>hippopotami,</b> and other large animals now found in Africa, while others have revealed animals native to Europe.|$|E

50|$|The <b>hippopotamus</b> often signifies {{chaos and}} evil in ancient Egypt, as the <b>hippopotamus</b> was {{believed}} to be the incarnation of the god Seth, the opponent of the good gods Osiris and Horus(photo). Horus then avenged his father Osiris by killing Seth, who is incarnated as a <b>hippopotamus.</b> The king then takes the role of Horus whenever he kills the <b>hippopotamus.</b> From the First Dynasty onwards, some pictures have been found with scenes in which the king hunts alone, as the <b>hippopotamus</b> became the symbol of chaos and evil. Hunting the <b>hippopotamus</b> displayed the king's unmatched power, as depicted in King Dewen's cylindrical seal, where he wrestles and pins down the <b>hippopotamus</b> weaponless. Other pictures have been found of tomb owners in the New Kingdom killing the <b>hippopotamus,</b> these pictures are believed to have an exclusive religious significance.|$|R

500|$|The divine {{struggle}} involves many episodes. [...] "Contendings" [...] {{describes the}} two gods appealing to various other deities to arbitrate the dispute and competing {{in different types}} of contests, such as racing in boats or fighting {{each other in the}} form of <b>hippopotami,</b> to determine a victor. In this account, Horus repeatedly defeats Set and is supported by most of the other deities. Yet the dispute drags on for eighty years, largely because the judge, the creator god, favors Set. In late ritual texts, the conflict is characterized as a great battle involving the two deities' assembled followers. The strife in the divine realm extends beyond the two combatants. At one point Isis attempts to harpoon Set as he is locked in combat with her son, but she strikes Horus instead, who then cuts off her head in a fit of rage. Thoth replaces Isis's head with that of a cow; the story gives a mythical origin for the cow-horn headdress that Isis commonly wears.|$|E
500|$|Chapters 20, 21, and 22 {{discuss the}} [...] "disguising-coloration" [...] of mammals, {{including}} the whales which [...] "are {{equipped with a}} full obliterative shading of surface-colors". The bats are admitted to have {{very little in the}} way of countershading, unlike all other families in the order. Thayer notes that a few species with strong defences such as hedgehogs, porcupines, echidnas, pangolins and [...] "some armadillos" [...] are exceptions, along with some beasts which [...] "enjoy a like security by virtue of their gigantic bigness", including the elephants, rhinoceroses, and <b>hippopotami.</b> The domestic hare is shown to be strongly countershaded with a pair of photographs [...] "from life", one sitting and one [...] "laid on its back, outdoors, so that the obliterative shading is reversed". Chapter 21 asserts that zebras [...] "must be extraordinarily inconspicuous" [...] against vegetation, a claim derided by Theodore Roosevelt (see below). Chapter 22 addresses the problem of the [...] "few [...] whose bold, clear patterns seem to defy that foremost obliterative law." [...] These include the skunks, the African zoril (striped polecat) and the teledu (stink badger) of Java, which all have dark underparts and white upperparts.

2500|$|The {{predecessor}} of the {{zoological garden}} is the menagerie, {{which has a}} long history from the ancient world to modern times. The oldest known zoological collection was revealed during excavations at Hierakonpolis, Egypt in 2009, of a ca. 3500 BCE menagerie. The exotic animals included <b>hippopotami,</b> hartebeest, elephants, baboons and wildcats. King Ashur-bel-kala of the Middle Assyrian Empire created zoological and botanical gardens in the 11th century BCE. In the 2nd century BCE, the Chinese Empress Tanki had a [...] "house of deer" [...] built, and King Wen of Zhou kept a [...] zoo called Ling-Yu, or the Garden of Intelligence. Other well-known collectors of animals included King Solomon of the Kingdom of Israel and Judah, queen Semiramis and King Ashurbanipal of Assyria, and King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia. By the 4th century BCE, zoos existed in most of the Greek city states; Alexander the Great is known to have sent animals that he found on his military expeditions back to Greece.

5|$|The Malagasy <b>hippopotamus</b> {{was first}} {{described}} in the mid-19th century by Alfred Grandidier, who unearthed nearly 50 individual hippos from a dried-up swamp at 'Ambolisatra' (thought to be Ambolisaka, near Lake Ihotry), {{a few miles from}} the Mozambique Channel. As many as four different species of <b>hippopotamus</b> were subsequently identified by various researchers. In a careful revision of the fossil record of the Malagasy hippos, Solweig Stuenes concluded that there were only two species of <b>hippopotamus</b> which she classified as <b>Hippopotamus</b> lemerlei and <b>Hippopotamus</b> madagascariensis. In 1990, Faure and Guerin discovered a distinct third species of hippo, which they named <b>Hippopotamus</b> laloumena. In a review of Stuenes work, Harris suggested that Hip. madagascariensis had much in common with the extant pygmy <b>hippopotamus</b> of West Africa. Since the extant pygmy <b>hippopotamus</b> was placed in the genus Hexaprotodon, he used the name Hex. madagascariensis. Some taxonomists, however, consider the modern pygmy hippo to belong to the genus Choeropsis, so this species may also be classified as C. madagascariensis.|$|R
