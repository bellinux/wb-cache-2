40|$|Aim: The {{present study}} was {{undertaken}} to study the etiopathology of dead-in-shell embryos of PB- 2 male x Indigenous female crossbred chicken egg. Materials and Methods: A total of 1377 eggs were incubated which was collected from a flock of crossbreed bird (PB- 2 xIndigenous) chicken. Out of which 568 (41. 25 %) egg failed to pip out, were utilized for further study. All the <b>dead</b> <b>in</b> <b>shell</b> embryos were examined for different anomalies and pathological condition thorough necropsy examination. For bacteriological isolation a piece of liver, lung and yolk sac contents were collected from 25 nos. of <b>dead</b> <b>in</b> <b>shell</b> embryos and send to the Department of Microbiology for further examination. Results: A total of 241 (42. 42 %) egg were recorded as dead-in-shell embryos out of 568 eggs which were fail to pip out. The percentage of dead-in-shell was higher on 21 st day (61. 34 %) than 18 th day (38. 66 %) of incubation. Out of 241 nos. of <b>dead</b> <b>in</b> <b>shell</b> embryos, 47 (19. 50 %) cases showed malpositions, 19 (7. 88 %) malformation, 6 (2. 49 %) adhesion, 4 (1. 66 %) dehydra-tion, 67 (27. 80 %) pathological condition and 98 (40. 66 %) cases showed no definite abnormalities and 327 (57. 57 %) numbers of egg were found as infertile.

40|$|The {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} compare and evaluate the hatchability and survival rate of a sand incubator and natural hen incubation technique and to estimate the profitability of the two different incubation techniques. The {{results of this study}} indicated that fertility, hatchability and <b>dead</b> <b>in</b> <b>shell</b> there were no significant difference (P> 0. 05) among the treatments. Embryonic mortality, normal DOC, abnormal DOC and chick weight showed significant differences (P< 0. 05) among the treatments. Higher embryonic mortality (17 %) in broody hen than (9. 2 %) in sand incubator was observed. On the first batch, the net return per 100 eggs in sand incubation was 177. 83 ETB ($ 9. 3) which is higher net return / profit from that of the broody hen incubation (- 441. 05 ETB) or ($- 23. 0) which were not profitable for the first batch at 70. 80 % hatchability.

40|$|Accumulations of <b>dead</b> <b>shells</b> <b>in</b> both modern coastal {{settings}} {{and in the}} rock record contain valuable information on past ecosystems and environmental conditions. However, death assemblages are not simply snapshots of living communities; rather, the abundances of different species have been biased due to differential rates of postmortem destruction. In order to constrain the nature and degree of bias in modern molluscan death assemblages in a shallow marine environment, I deployed mesh-bag experiments including six species of bivalves into a natural marine environment on the Texas coast. The mesh bag design for tethering shells allowed for maximum exchange between ambient environmental conditions and the shells while the apparatus was deployed. The apparatuses were recovered after 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 16 weeks, 8 months, and 12 months. Shells were examined under a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) to analyze integrity, document degradation, and investigate patterns of biological, chemical, and physical abrasion and destruction. SEM analysis indicates that some shells clearly degraded, while others did not, even after 12 months. <b>In</b> addition, epifaunal <b>shells</b> experienced postmortem encrustation by sessile organisms more than infaunal shells, indicating a species-level preservational bias...|$|R
50|$|Apart {{from the}} Mollusca (molluscs), Linnaeus {{included}} a very diverse and rather mismatched assemblage {{of animals in}} the categories.

Historically, systematic works on phylum-level taxa since Linnaeus have largely been about splitting up Vermes and sorting the animals into natural systematic units. The first major revision was done by Jean-Baptiste Lamarck in his 1801 Système des Animaux sans Vertebres. In this work, he categorized echinoderms, arachnids, crustaceans and annelids, which he separated from Vermes. The work Lamarck started still goes on today.|$|R
40|$|A subchronic toxicity/reproduction {{study was}} {{performed}} in Japanese quails that were fed a diet containing 0, 24, 60, and 150 mg tri-n-butyltin oxide (TBTO) per kg basal diet for 6 weeks. Eggs produced during the 6 weeks of treatment were incubated and hatched, and chicks hatched from eggs collected in weeks 5 and 6 of exposure were reared for 2 weeks. In parent quail, neither diminished food consumption nor any overt toxic or histopathologic signs were observed following exposure to TBTO. A statistically significant decrease in hatchability and increase in percent of chicks found <b>dead</b> <b>in</b> the <b>shell</b> were observed following TBTO exposure at concentrations of 60 and 150 mg/kg food. However, no significant, adverse effects were recorded on total egg production, eggshell thickness and cracked eggs. Blood chemistry parameters of birds measured at {{the last day of}} TBTO treatment revealed a statistically significant decrease in serum aspartate aminotransferase (ASAT) enzyme activity among both sexes in all treatment groups. In addition, a statistically significant dose-related decrease in serum calcium level was observed in females only, while serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) levels were statistically significantly reduced in male birds in all treatment groups (approximately 50 % of the controls). Moreover, a significant decrease in hepatic microsomal 7 -ethoxyresorufin (EROD) activity was recorded in females fed 24 and 60 mg TBTO/kg diet and males fed 60 and 150 mg TBTO/kg diet, whereas pentoxyresorufin-o-deetylase (PROD) activity was only significantly decreased in males fed 150 mg TBTO/kg diet. No TBTO related effects were found on serum alanine aminotransferase (ALAT), serum total thyroxine (TT 4), luteinizing hormone (LH) or retinol levels in both sexes. In summary, TBTO affected mainly reproduction in Japanese quail at a dose where no overt toxicity is observe...|$|R
40|$|Heat {{exchangers}} {{are important}} heat transfer apparatus in oil refining, chemical engineering, environmental protection, {{electric power generation}} etc. The present work modifies the existing Bell-Delaware method used for conventional heat exchanger, taking into consideration the helical geometry of Helixchanger. Thermal analysis was carried out to study the impacts of various baffle inclination angles on fluid flow and heat transfer of heat exchangers with helical baffles. The analysis was conducted for conventional shell and tube heat Exchanger and Helixchanger for five baffle inclination angles. Analysis results indicate that continual helical baffles can reduce or even eliminate <b>dead</b> regions <b>in</b> the <b>shell</b> side of shell-and-tube heat exchangers. The pressure drop varies drastically with baffle inclination angle and shell-side Reynolds number. The variation of the pressure drop is relatively large for small inclination angle. However, for α> 350, the effect of α on pressure drop is very small. Compared to the segmental heat exchangers, the heat exchangers with continual helical baffles have higher heat transfer coefficients to the same pressure drop. The detailed knowledge on the heat transfer and pressure drop across the shell side will provide further basis flow for further optimization of shell-and-tube heat exchangers...|$|R
40|$|A {{survey of}} benthic {{communities}} {{in the vicinity of}} Isla Cancun and Isla Contoy, Territory of Quintana Roo, Mexico, demonstrates that invertebrate death assemblages (i. e., future fossil assemblages) in this region reflect the in-place accumulation of remains of living benthic communities through long periods of time. Samples were collected with a diver-operated suction dredge, and 290 molluscan species were identified and counted. Although nearly three-fourths of the species are known only as <b>dead</b> <b>shells</b> <b>in</b> the samples, almost all individuals occurring alive in any sample are represented by dead shells of their species in the same sample. Worn shells are uncommon, and a count of disarticulated bivalve valves revealed a nearly even left-right distribution. A series of twelve Q-mode cluster analyses, utilizing five different similarity coefficients and data based on both the presence or absence and the relative abundances of species, demonstrates that the same associations of samples tend to occur whether living animals only or dead remains only are considered. A Q-mode analysis based on the relative abundances of 180 species in the death assemblages of all 50 samples results in distinct clusters corresponding directly to each of the major environments sampled. An R-mode analysis of 66 common species in the death assemblages yields three distinct groups of organisms from environments of (a) restricted circulation, (b) open marine circulation and (c) swift currents. These results imply that large-scale transport of shell material and mixing of faunas from different environments are negligible in the areas sampled. Rankings of samples in terms of species diversity and total abundance indicate that most samples occupy roughly the same position in the lists whether only dead shells or only living organisms are considered. Associations computed between sample couplets with Chi-square tests and various similarity coefficients demonstrate that the death assemblages in each couplet are similar, whereas the living communities are not. Histograms of growth ring counts and size-frequency distributions of Chione cancellata in lagoon and strait samples resemble a mortality curve expected for a single generation of a living population of that species. The assemblages of <b>dead</b> <b>shells</b> <b>in</b> the sediments of this region represent "time-averaged communities" (Walker and Bambach, 1971), produced by the averaging of benthic communities during sedimentation as patchily distributed populations migrate across the bottom and leave a record of their mortality behind them in the sediment...|$|R

Here we present new data on the geographical distribution and ecological characteristics of the helicinid Pleuropoma extincta (Odhner, 1917). The species is confined to the limestone outcrops of the Chillagoe Formation where it occurs abundantly both as living populations on the limestone rock and associated vegetation, and as <b>dead</b> <b>shells</b> <b>in</b> the litter deposits.

Differences in whorl counts of sub-fossil P. extincta shells from archaeological excavations at Hay Cave, in tropical northeastern Australia, are then investigated.
