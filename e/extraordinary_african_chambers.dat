50|$|The <b>Extraordinary</b> <b>African</b> <b>Chambers</b> (Chambres Africaines Extraordinaires, CAE) is a {{tribunal}} established {{under an}} agreement between the African Union and Senegal to try international crimes committed in Chad from 7 June 1982 to 1 December 1990. This period corresponds to the regime of former Chadian President Hissène Habré. The <b>Extraordinary</b> <b>African</b> <b>Chambers</b> were opened 8 February 2013 in Dakar, Senegal. The magistrate Ciré Aly Bâ is the current administrator of the <b>Extraordinary</b> <b>African</b> <b>Chambers</b> in the Senegalese courts.|$|E
50|$|On 30 May 2016, the <b>Extraordinary</b> <b>African</b> <b>Chambers</b> found Habré {{guilty of}} rape, sexual slavery, and {{ordering}} {{the killing of}} 40,000 people during his tenure as Chadian president and sentenced him to life in prison. The verdict {{marked the first time}} an African Union-backed court convicted a former ruler for human-rights abuses and {{the first time that the}} courts of one country have prosecuted the former ruler of another country for crimes against humanity.|$|E
40|$|From 20 July onwards, Chad’s {{previous}} despot, Hissène Habré, {{will be in}} {{the dock}} on charges of crimes against humanity, torture and war crimes before the <b>Extraordinary</b> <b>African</b> <b>Chambers</b> (EAC) in the Senegalese court system. His trial will be Africa’s first to proceed to trial under the guise of universal jurisdiction – the principle that international crimes have no borders. Its decisive start signals a judicial rendez-vous with the ghosts of Chad’s brutal past and will bring to a close a protracted legal drama, meandering through a myriad of jurisdictions. Next to being a catalysing forum for witness testimony, the Habré trial will above all be a litmus test for ‘Pan-African’ justice...|$|E

40|$|The {{judgment}} rendered by the <b>Extraordinary</b> <b>African</b> <b>Chambers</b> in the Habré case, {{has been}} saluted {{as a great}} accomplishment around the world. Being the first judicial decision of an African national court condemning a former head of state of another African country, the judgment is painted as a success story for universal jurisdiction. This paper assesses the state of affairs in Africa as far as universal jurisdiction is concerned after that judgment. It analyses relevant legal instruments and practices of the African Union and some individual African states. It concludes that although the judgment in the Habré case sends a positive sign, a lot {{still needs to be}} done for universal jurisdiction to be a significant tool in the fight against impunity in Africa. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Magister Legum - LLMHybrid Courts are {{the latest}} {{innovation}} in the prosecution of international crimes after {{the era of the}} International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) and the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY). Examples include; the <b>Extraordinary</b> <b>African</b> <b>Chambers</b> in the Courts of Cambodia, the Regulation 64 Panels in the courts of Kosovo and the Special Court for Sierra Leone. The hybrid court model at its inception was believed to be the panacea for the short comings of purely international tribunals. The characteristic location of the tribunals in the locus of the atrocities and the participation of local judicial officers alongside their international counterparts was expected to promote legitimacy and foster capacity building for conflict ravaged transitional states. Despite the criticisms of the model today, a new hybrid court has recently been inaugurated to prosecute Hissène Habré the former President of Chad, for international crimes committed during his presidency. The promulgation of the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Senegal suggests that the model continues to be useful, especially for Africa. This is of particular significance since international criminal justice has lately come under attack on the continent. The on-going feud between the African Union and the International Criminal court is only the most prolific example of this. This research paper explores the dimensions of the challenges facing the legitimacy of international criminal justice in Africa {{and the extent to which}} the hybrid court model can provide a solution for them. In order to do so, the study begins by addressing the meaning of legitimacy within the African context. A general discussion of hybrid tribunals, as well as the specific manifestations of the model in Africa so far, follows. The Special Court for Sierra Leone and the <b>Extraordinary</b> <b>African</b> <b>Chambers</b> in the Courts of Senegal are distinguishable from each other in structure and are thus juxtaposed in order to illuminate possible improvements on the hybrid court model for the future...|$|E
