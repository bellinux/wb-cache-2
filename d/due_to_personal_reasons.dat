5|$|Following {{rumors of}} cast members from Beverly Hills, 90210 {{appearing}} on the spin-off, The CW confirmed that Shannen Doherty, Jennie Garth, Tori Spelling and Joe E. Tata would be returning in recurring roles as their original characters. Sachs was familiar with Garth, and talked to her about a possible role in the series. Garth agreed to star on the series without reading a script after brainstorming ideas with Sachs. The producers offered Garth a role as a series regular, but she opted to sign on as a recurring character. Doherty decided to appear after talking with Sachs, but her appearance {{was moved to the}} second episode. Sachs described Tata's casting as an accident; a friend told Sachs that he had seen Tata in a store, which led to the offer of a recurring role in the series. Sachs said that Tata was ecstatic about the idea and agreed. After reading the script, Spelling expressed interest in returning, and the writers decided to give her character her own fashion line. Spelling was scheduled to appear in the premiere, but <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>personal</b> <b>reasons</b> and the birth of her daughter, she opted to appear later in the season. On August 11, it was reported that Spelling had pulled out of the series after discovering that she was receiving less pay than Garth and Doherty. Spelling asked for her salary of $20,000 per episode to be increased to match their salaries—$40,000 to $50,000 per episode—but when denied she left the show altogether.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{being born}} in Lagos, Nigeria, Odubade {{grew up in}} East Sussex. He {{attended}} The Bishop Bell School in Eastbourne. He began his football career in England, playing in the Sussex County League for Eastbourne Town in 2002. He scored over 70 times in just two seasons at the East Sussex club in all competitions, before attracting the attention of then–Yeovil Town manager Gary Johnson {{before the start of}} the 2004–05 season, he subsequently joined the club on a one-year contract in July 2004 after a successful trial. He made his debut as a substitute for the Somerset side in a 4–3 defeat against Torquay United in the Football League Trophy in September 2004. He made his second Yeovil appearance in a 3–1 victory away at Histon in an FA Cup tie, scoring his only goal for the club deep into injury-time. He made a further four appearances for the side, before leaving the club in February 2005 <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>personal</b> <b>reasons,</b> and subsequently joined Conference South side Eastbourne Borough two days later. Odubade made his Eastbourne Borough debut in the club's 2–0 victory against Basingstoke Town just three days after signing for the club, playing 45 minutes of the match. In the following game, he scored twice as Eastbourne came from back from a two-goal deficit to draw 2–2 at Cambridge City, scoring both goals within the space of five minutes. Odubade made it five goals in his first three games for Eastbourne, as he scored a hat-trick in the club's 4–0 home victory against Thurrock. He also scored Eastbourne's third goal in a 3–1 win in the following game against Newport County, latching onto a long ball and beating the goalkeeper first time. Throughout March 2005, Odubade scored in four consecutive games, netting against Cambridge City, Havant & Waterlooville, Sutton United, and Hayes to take his tally to ten goals for the club.

40|$|In this paper, three {{laws are}} {{obtained}} for multiple-input multiple-output feedback systems, {{which are in}} entropy domain, frequency domain, and time domain, respectively. The system setup is that with causal plants and causal controllers. Those laws characterize the performance limitations of such systems imposed by the feedback mechanism. Some new notions are proposed to facilitate the analysis: negentropy rate, extended spectral flatness (extended Wiener entropy), Gaussianity-whiteness measure (joint Shannon-Wiener entropy), etc. Two approaches are adopted: the integrated approach and the divided approach. And 'uncertainty principles' are found in minimum variance control. Besides, performance limitations in minimum variance estimation and filtering are obtained. In the end, the special case of linear time-invariant feedback systems is discussed. Comment: This paper has been withdrawn by the author <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>personal</b> <b>reason...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper aims at obtaining {{universal}} {{laws and}} absolute lower bounds of feedback systems using information theory. The feedback system setup {{is that with}} causal plants and causal controllers. Three laws (entropy rate never decreases, generalized Bode integral, and absolute lower bound in variance minimization) are obtained, which are in entropy domain, frequency domain, and time domain, respectively. Those laws characterize the fundamental limitations of such systems imposed by the feedback mechanism. Two new notions, negentropy rate and Gaussianity-whiteness measure (joint Shannon-Wiener entropy), are proposed to facilitate the analysis. Topics such as whiteness-Gaussianity-variance decomposition, Gaussianing-whitening control (the maximum Gaussianity-whiteness measure principle), whitening control (spectrum/spectral flattening control), generalized Bode plot, and so on are also discussed. The special case of linear time-invariant feedback systems is considered in the end. Comment: This paper has been withdrawn by the author <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>personal</b> <b>reason...</b>|$|R

40|$|Increasingly more {{attention}} is paid to the privacy in online applications <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the widespread data collection for various analysis purposes. Sensitive information might be mined from the raw data during the analysis, and this led to a great privacy concern among people (data providers) these days. To deal with this privacy concerns, multitudes of privacy-preserving computation schemes are proposed to address various computation problems, and we have found many of them fall into a class of problems which can be solved by greedy algorithms. In this paper, we propose a framework for distributed greedy algorithms in which instances in the feasible set come from different parties. By our framework, most generic distributed greedy algorithms can be converted to a privacy preserving one which achieves the same result as the original greedy algorithm while the private information associated with the instances is still protected.
