5|$|Shortly {{after taking}} office, Yanayev joined {{a group of}} more {{conservative}} Communist politicians who hoped to persuade <b>Gorbachev</b> <b>to</b> declare a state of emergency, led by KGB chairman Vladimir Kryuchkov.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the {{comparatively}} youthful Mikhail Gorbachev became General Secretary in 1985, the Soviet economy was stagnant and faced a sharp fall in foreign currency earnings {{as a result of}} the downward slide in oil prices in the 1980s. These issues prompted <b>Gorbachev</b> <b>to</b> investigate measures to revive the ailing state.|$|E
5|$|On March 11, 1985, {{power in}} the Soviet Union was assumed by Mikhail Gorbachev. The {{worsening}} economic situation in the entire Eastern Bloc, including the Soviet Union, together with other factors, forced <b>Gorbachev</b> <b>to</b> carry {{out a number of}} reforms, not only in the field of economics (uskoreniye) but in the political and social realms (glasnost and perestroika). Gorbachev's policies soon caused a corresponding shift in the policies of Soviet satellites, including the People's Republic of Poland.|$|E
5000|$|The movie rewinds <b>to</b> <b>Gorbachev’s</b> visit <b>to</b> East Germany. We {{then see}} the real {{celebrations}} {{of the fall of}} the Berlin Wall and the peaceful reunification of Germany: [...] "History...took a different course.".|$|R
5000|$|Mikhail <b>Gorbachev</b> {{referred}} <b>to</b> Jesus as [...] "the first Socialist".|$|R
2500|$|Ligachyov {{became one}} of Gorbachev’s primary critics, accused of leading a {{conservative}} faction. Although publicly endorsing perestroika, Ligachyov was opposed <b>to</b> <b>Gorbachev’s</b> attempts <b>to</b> expand Soviet authority and limit the responsibilities of party officials. Ligachyov {{did not support the}} decision to end the CPSU’s monopoly of political power in 1990, nor did he support <b>Gorbachev’s</b> response <b>to</b> the gradual withdrawal of Soviet authority in Eastern Europe, saying, for example, that [...] "We should not overlook the impending danger of the accelerated reunification of Germany".|$|R
5|$|Despite Reagan urging <b>Gorbachev</b> <b>to</b> {{tear down}} the Berlin Wall, there are some such as Romesh Ratnesar of Time who commented {{that there is little}} {{evidence}} that the speech had any impact on the decision to {{tear down the}} wall, let alone an impact on the people he addressed. Another critic was Liam Hoare in a 2012 article in The Atlantic, who pointed to the many reasons for the tendency for American media to focus on the significance of this particular speech, without weighing the complexity of the events as they unfolded in both East and West Germany and the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|In August 1990 several leading {{officials}} {{tried to}} persuade <b>Gorbachev</b> <b>to</b> force Ryzhkov to resign from his post. Gorbachev did not bow to this pressure, fearing that Ryzhkov's removal would lead to increased activity by many of his pro-republican first secretaries and Politburo members. Ryzhkov's numerous supporters were not concerned about policy issues; they backed him simply because he opposed some of Gorbachev's economic and political reforms. In July 1990, as the Politburo underwent restructuring at the 28th Party Congress, all government officials except Gorbachev and Vladimir Ivashko, the Deputy General Secretary, were excluded with Ryzhkov losing his Politburo seat by default. Nevertheless, Ryzhkov, along with many others, was elected {{a member of the}} Presidential Council. On 19 October 1990 the Russian Supreme Soviet, by a vote of 164 to 1 with 16 abstentions, forced the resignation of Ryzhkov and his cabinet and the implementation of the 500 Days Programme. In stark contrast, Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union support for Ryzhkov's economic reform plan increased. Ryzhkov's economic reform plan was passed by an overwhelming majority, with 1,532 deputies in favour, 419 against and 44 deputies abstaining. The parliamentary Interregional Group's vote of no confidence in Ryzhkov's government also failed, with 199 members in favour of Ryzhkov and his cabinet's resignation, 1,685 against and 99 abstaining. As the result of a propaganda war launched against Ryzhkov by Gorbachev supporters, several leading members of the Council of Ministers and its Presidium urged Ryzhkov to resign so that the Soviet Government could reach a compromise with the Russian Government. To make matters worse, the Russian Government which was headed by Ivan Silayev, stopped following Ryzhkov's orders, and Silayev refused to visit the Moscow Kremlin.|$|E
25|$|On 24 April 1990, Nazarbayev {{was named}} the first President of Kazakhstan by the Supreme Soviet. He {{supported}} Russian President Boris Yeltsin against the attempted coup in August 1991 by Soviet hardliners. Nazarbayev {{was close enough to}} Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev for <b>Gorbachev</b> <b>to</b> consider him for the post of Vice President of the Soviet Union; however, Nazarbayev turned the offer down.|$|E
25|$|When Mikhail <b>Gorbachev</b> came <b>to</b> {{power in}} Moscow, many {{conservative}} Republicans were dubious {{of the growing}} friendship between him and Reagan. <b>Gorbachev</b> tried <b>to</b> save communism in the Soviet Union first by ending the expensive arms race with America, then in 1989 by shedding the East European empire. Communism finally collapsed in the Soviet Union in 1991.|$|R
5000|$|This {{was before}} <b>Gorbachev</b> rose <b>to</b> power in 1985. Reagan later {{wrote in his}} {{autobiography}} An American Life that he [...] "did not see the profound changes that would occur in the Soviet Union after <b>Gorbachev</b> rose <b>to</b> power." [...] To confront the Soviet Union's serious economic problems, Gorbachev implemented bold new policies for freedom and openness called glasnost and perestroika.|$|R
50|$|As Mikhail <b>Gorbachev</b> {{attempted}} <b>to</b> {{revive the}} economy of the Soviet Union, he introduced glasnost (openness) and perestroika (restructuring).|$|R
25|$|After the summit, Bush {{would seek}} {{cooperative}} relations with Gorbachev throughout {{the remainder of}} his term, believing that the Soviet leader was the key to peacefully ending the Soviet domination Eastern Europe. When Lithuania declared independence from the USSR in 1990, Bush avoided criticizing Gorbachev out of the fear of undermining or alienating the Soviet leader. He did, however, pressure <b>Gorbachev</b> <b>to</b> begin negotiations with the Lithuanian government.|$|E
25|$|The Berlin Wall officially {{remained}} guarded after 9 November 1989, {{although the}} inter-German border had become effectively meaningless. The official {{dismantling of the}} Wall by the East German military did not begin until June 1990. In July 1990, the day East Germany adopted the West German currency, all border-controls ceased and West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl convinced <b>Gorbachev</b> <b>to</b> drop Soviet objections to a reunited Germany within NATO in return for substantial German economic aid to the Soviet Union.|$|E
25|$|Ligachyov's {{career began}} {{in his native}} Siberia {{and took him to}} some of the highest {{functions}} of the Party. He was often regarded as Gorbachev's second man, holding important posts such as Secretary for Ideology. However, Ligachyov lost his posts in 1990, a year before the dissolution of the Soviet Union, resigning from his political career at the 28th Party Congress. Ligachyov was critical of Yeltsin and <b>Gorbachev</b> <b>to</b> an extent, although he is often held as most remarkable for being Gorbachev's primary critic.|$|E

500|$|Yanayev had {{initially}} {{been rejected by}} the Supreme Soviet, but he was finally approved due <b>to</b> <b>Gorbachev's</b> insistence, only days after Shevardnadze had resigned from office due <b>to</b> <b>Gorbachev's</b> willingness <b>to</b> give leeway to conservatives. Some weeks after Yanayev's election, a senior Soviet official described Yanayev as [...] "Gorbachev's Quayle—a conservative nonentity, no threat <b>to</b> <b>Gorbachev,</b> and his selection would pacify the right-wing". At the beginning of January1991, Yanayev headed a committee working on {{the formation of a}} new cabinet. Later, he was sent to the Soviet city of Kuznetsk to negotiate with a newly formed independent trade union, making this the first time since 1917 that a Russian government official had negotiated with a trade union. However, after gaining the attention of the Soviet government, the unionists withdrew their plans for a strike.|$|R
50|$|After {{the failure}} of the Emergency Committee, and <b>Gorbachev</b> has {{returned}} <b>to</b> Moscow to negotiate a new Union Treaty are deadlocked, and <b>Gorbachev</b> finally began <b>to</b> lose control levers, which are gradually retreating to Yeltsin and heads of other union republics.|$|R
25|$|Andropov died in 1984, and {{indicated}} that he wanted <b>Gorbachev</b> <b>to</b> succeed him as general secretary. Instead, the aged Konstantin Chernenko took power, even though he himself was terminally ill. After Chernenko's death the following year, {{it became clear to}} the party hierarchy that younger leadership was needed. Gorbachev was elected general secretary by the Politburo on 11 March 1985, only three hours after Chernenko's death. Upon his accession at age 54, he was the youngest member of the Politburo. He was also the first person to be elected party leader after having initially failed in a previous bid for the post.|$|E
25|$|Technically the Wall {{remained}} guarded {{for some}} time after November 9, though at a decreasing intensity. On June 13, 1990, the official dismantling of the Wall by the East German military began in Bernauer Straße. On July 1, the day East Germany adopted the West German currency, all border controls ceased, although the inter-German border had become meaningless {{for some time}} before that. That month, the final obstacle to German reunification was removed when West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl convinced <b>Gorbachev</b> <b>to</b> drop Soviet objections to a reunited Germany within NATO in return for substantial German economic aid to the Soviet Union.|$|E
500|$|Former West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said {{he would}} never forget {{standing}} near Reagan when he challenged <b>Gorbachev</b> <b>to</b> tear down the Berlin Wall. [...] "He was a stroke of luck for the world, especially for Europe." ...|$|E
50|$|In {{his visit}} to Cuba in April 1989, <b>Gorbachev</b> {{attempted}} <b>to</b> convince Castro {{to take a more}} positive attitude towards reformism and more flexibility in fixing Cuba’s economy. Gorbachev was only the second Soviet leader to visit Latin America, and rather than resolve the increasing tensions between the two nations, the visit was mostly a symbolic gesture. Despite Soviet Foreign Minister Shevardnadze declaring the meeting a “milestone in Soviet-Cuban relations,” Soviet-Cuban relations rapidly declined following <b>Gorbachev’s</b> return <b>to</b> Moscow.|$|R
50|$|In February 1989, Eduard Shevardnadze, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union, {{delivered}} <b>Gorbachev's</b> reply <b>to</b> Khomeini when {{he traveled}} to Iran.|$|R

500|$|... "Tear {{down this}} wall!" [...] {{is a line}} from a speech made by US President Ronald Reagan in West Berlin on June 12, 1987, calling for {{the leader of the}} Soviet Union, Mikhail <b>Gorbachev,</b> <b>to</b> open up the barrier which had divided West and East Berlin since 1961.|$|E
500|$|Speaking at the Berlin Wall on June 12, 1987, Reagan {{challenged}} <b>Gorbachev</b> <b>to</b> go further, saying [...] "General Secretary Gorbachev, if {{you seek}} peace, if you seek prosperity for the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, if you seek liberalization, {{come here to}} this gate! Mr. Gorbachev, open this gate! Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!" ...|$|E
500|$|Author James Mann {{disagreed}} with both critics like Hoare, who saw Reagan's speech as having no real effect, {{and those who}} praised the speech as key to shaking Soviet confidence. In a 2007 opinion article in The New York Times, he put the speech {{in the context of}} previous Reagan overtures to the Soviet Union, such as the Reykjavik summit of the previous year, which had very nearly resulted in an agreement to eliminate American and Soviet nuclear weapons entirely. He characterized the speech as a way for Reagan to assuage his right-wing critics that he was still tough on communism, while also extending a renewed invitation to <b>Gorbachev</b> <b>to</b> work together to create [...] "the vastly more relaxed climate in which the Soviets sat on their hands when the wall came down." [...] Reagan, claimed Mann, [...] "wasn't trying to land a knockout blow on the Soviet regime, nor was he engaging in mere political theater. He was instead doing something else on that damp day in Berlin 20 years [...] – he was helping to set the terms {{for the end of the}} cold war." ...|$|E

25|$|Reagan met {{four times}} with Soviet leader Mikhail <b>Gorbachev,</b> who ascended <b>to</b> power in 1985, and their summit {{conferences}} {{led to the}} signing of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. <b>Gorbachev</b> tried <b>to</b> save Communism in the Soviet Union first by ending the expensive arms race with America, then by shedding the East European empire in 1989. The Soviet Union collapsed on Christmas Day 1991, ending the U.S–Soviet Cold War.|$|R
5000|$|His loyalty <b>to</b> <b>Gorbachev</b> was unquestioned, and he {{was with}} him at many of the key moments as Soviet leader. He was at his side when <b>Gorbachev</b> failed <b>to</b> {{convince}} the East German Politbüro to reform at a strained meeting in East Berlin in October 1989. The two shared a celebratory private glass of champagne when Gorbachev was elected the first (and last) Soviet president in March 1990.|$|R
500|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the 1988 earthquake in the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic, Ryzhkov promised to rebuild the city of Spitak within two years. A Politburo commission was established to provide guidance for the local ASSR Government with Ryzhkov elected its chairman. The commission then travelled to the ASSR to assess damage caused by the earthquake. [...] During Gorbachev's subsequent visit to the ASSR, and aware of local feelings following the disaster, Ryzhkov persuaded the less sensitive <b>Gorbachev</b> <b>to</b> forgo use of his limousine in favor of public transport. When Gorbachev left the ASSR, Ryzhkov remained to coordinate the rescue operation and made several television appearances which increased his standing amongst the Soviet leadership and the people in general. With his standing thus boosted, on 19 July 1988, at the Central Committee Plenum, Ryzhkov criticised nearly every one of Gorbachev's policies, further complaining that as Party Secretary he should devote more time to the Party. In the end, Ryzhkov failed in his promise to rebuild Spitak, partly due to the Soviet Union's mounting economic problems, and partly because many of the city's Soviet era buildings had not been designed with adequate earthquake protection, making their reconstruction more difficult.|$|E
500|$|In 1987, he {{travelled}} to Moscow to meet Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in {{what was}} perceived as a difficult time in West German-Soviet relations, after chancellor Kohl had angered Moscow by comparing <b>Gorbachev</b> <b>to</b> Joseph Goebbels. During a speech at the Kremlin, Weizsäcker said: [...] "The Germans, who today live separated into East and West, have never stopped and will never stop to feel like one nation." [...] His speech was, however, censored in the official Communist Party newspaper Pravda. However, when German foreign minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher protested against this to his Soviet counterpart Eduard Shevardnadze, the speech was then printed unabridged in the lesser paper Izvestia. Weizsäcker also appealed to the Soviet authorities to agree to a pardon for the last inmate in the Spandau Prison, former Deputy Führer Rudolf Hess. This proved unsuccessful, and Hess committed suicide six weeks later. The visit was nevertheless considered a success, as Gorbachev was quoted afterwards saying that [...] "a new page of history was opened", after the two had discussed matters of disarmament. Also in 1987, Erich Honecker became the first East German leader to visit the Federal Republic. While state guests in Germany are usually welcomed by the President, Honecker was still not greeted officially by Weizsäcker, but by chancellor Kohl, since the Federal Republic did not consider the GDR a foreign state. Weizsäcker did however receive Honecker later at his seat of office, the Hammerschmidt Villa.|$|E
500|$|Entering the {{presidency}} in 1981, Reagan implemented sweeping new political and economic initiatives. His supply-side economic policies, dubbed [...] "Reaganomics", advocated tax rate reduction to spur economic growth, control of the money supply to curb inflation, economic deregulation, and reduction in government spending. In his first term he survived an assassination attempt, spurred the War on Drugs, and fought public sector labor. Over his two terms, the economy saw a reduction of inflation from 12.5% to 4.4%, and an average annual growth of real GDP of 3.4; while Reagan did enact cuts in domestic discretionary spending, tax cuts and increased military spending contributed to increased federal outlays overall, even after adjustment for inflation. During his re-election bid, Reagan campaigned {{on the notion that}} it was [...] "Morning in America", winning a landslide in 1984 with the largest electoral college victory in American history. Foreign affairs dominated his second term, including ending of the Cold War, the bombing of Libya, and the Iran–Contra affair. Publicly describing the Soviet Union as an [...] "evil empire", and during his famous speech at the Brandenburg Gate, President Reagan challenged Soviet General Secretary Mikhail <b>Gorbachev</b> <b>to</b> [...] "tear down this wall!". He transitioned Cold War policy from détente to rollback, by escalating an arms race with the USSR while engaging in talks with Gorbachev, which culminated in the INF Treaty, shrinking both countries' nuclear arsenals. Reagan's presidency came during the decline of the Soviet Union and just ten months after the end of his term, the Berlin Wall fell, Germany reunified the following year, and on December 26, 1991, nearly three years after he left office, the Soviet Union collapsed.|$|E
50|$|At the 1988 Party Conference <b>Gorbachev</b> {{launched}} reforms <b>to</b> {{reduce the}} party's {{control over the}} government including proposals for multicandidate elections to regional and local legislatures and the positions of local and regional party first secretaryships. While <b>Gorbachev</b> was able <b>to</b> receive approval for his reforms from the party, {{the membership of the}} CPSU was becoming increasingly resistant <b>to</b> <b>Gorbachev's</b> policies and rather than being a locus for change became a bulwark of conservatism. Increasingly, Gorbachev bypassed the party in order to implement his reforms relying instead on governmental bodies.|$|R
