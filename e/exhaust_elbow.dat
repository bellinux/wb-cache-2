40|$|As {{part of a}} {{study of}} the effects of fuel {{composition}} on the combustor performance of a turbojet engine, an investigation was made in a single I- 16 combustor with the standard I- 16 injection nozzle, supplied by the engine manufacturer, at simulated altitude conditions. The 10 fuels investigated included hydrocarbons of the paraffin olefin, naphthene, and aromatic classes having a boiling range from 113 degrees to 655 degrees F. They were hot-acid octane, diisobutylene, methylcyclohexane, benzene, xylene, 62 -octane gasoline, kerosene, solvent 2, and Diesel fuel oil. The fuels were tested at combustor conditions simulating I- 16 turbojet operation at an altitude of 45, 000 feet and at a rotor speed of 12, 200 rpm. At these conditions the combustor-inlet air temperature, static pressure, and velocity were 60 degrees F., 12. 3 inches of mercury absolute, and 112 feet per second respectively, and were held approximately constant for the investigation. The reproducibility of the data is shown by check runs taken each day during the investigation. The combustion in the <b>exhaust</b> <b>elbow</b> was visually observed for each fuel investigated...|$|E
40|$|The {{topic of}} this thesis is the {{development}} of a numerical model to investigate the heat and mass transport in an EAF freeboard. Some of the challenges presently faced by European steelmakers are increasing costs for raw materials and energy, as well as strict environmental policies. These can be addressed by improving the energy efficiency of the EAF steelmaking process by reducing off-gas and cooling losses. This can be achieved by increasing the degree of combustion of CO and H 2 in the furnace freeboard. A better understanding of the mechanisms that cause unwanted emissions during the steelmaking process can also help to develop new methods to reduce pollutants. The long term motivation behind the topic of this thesis is therefore to create a numerical EAF model with which the influence of process innovations on the fluid flow field, energy transport and chemical reactions within the freeboard of an electric arc furnace can be analysed. At this stage, the main objective is to qualitatively investigate the influence of the arc region on the amount of post-combustion within the freeboard. The effect of a change in the foamy slag height on the resulting amount of post-combustion is also investigated. The numerical EAF model represents the power-on/flat-bath stage of the steelmaking process in an exemplary AC electric arc furnace for quasi-steady state heat loss conditions. The AC EAF has a capacity of 100 tons of steel, a transformer rating of 90 MVA and and an inner vessel diameter of 6. 1 m. A simplified time-averaged arc model based on the channel arc model was developed in order to include the influence of the arc region on the conditions within the freeboard. The plasma arcs {{are not part of the}} solution domain, but are represented as segmented cylindrical surfaces extending from each electrode tip to the bath surface. In contrast to previous models, this simplified arc model includes not only the energy input due to the intense thermal radiation, but also the kinetic energy input due to the arc in- and outflow as well as the energy input due to the heating of the entrained furnace atmosphere in the arcs. The graphite electrodes are part of the solution domain, whereby the Joule heating due to the AC current flowing through the electrodes is taken into account. For the energy balance of the solution domain the energy input from the arc region plus the Joule heating in the electrodes represents the electric power input from the secondary circuit. This energy contribution is much smaller than the true electric power input, as it equates the amount needed, in addition to the other energy inflows, to cover the stationary power losses. The discrete ordinates thermal radiation model available in the CFD code ANSYS FLUENT (Version 14. 5) was chosen to model the thermal radiation exchange, whereby the thermal radiation absorption coefficient of the furnace atmosphere is calculated with the weighted-sum-of-grey-gases-model. Species transport with volumetric reactions and the finite-rate/eddy dissipation turbulence chemistry interaction is used to calculate the mass transfer and chemical reactions within the freeboard. The furnace atmosphere is defined to be a mixture of CO, CO 2, H 2 O, N 2 and O 2. The post combustion of CO to CO 2 is simulated according to the gas-shift reaction available for the oxidation of CO in FLUENT. The realizable k-ε model with standard wall functions for the near wall treatment was selected to simulate the turbulent viscous flow. The geometry of the EAF model extends from the uppermost layer of the metal bath to the beginning of the off-gas extraction downstream of the post-combustion gap. The foamy slag is modelled as a solid layer and the top layer of the bath, also considered as a solid, is included. These two layers allow the simulation of downward absorption and redistribution of energy from the arc region, which is reflected by the resulting temperature distribution at the foamy slag layer surface. Burners, lances or injectors are not included at present. The decarburization of the molten metal bath is taken into account by the definition of a homogenous source of CO at the surface of the foamy slag layer. An average value for the graphite electrode consumption is modelled by a corresponding CO source and O 2 sink at the electrode surfaces. Ingress air is defined to enter the freeboard through the slag door, roof gap and electrode gaps and air flows in at the post-combustion gap. It is assumed that a small amount of steam enters the vessel through the electrode gaps due to electrode cooling. The upper vessel, roof, <b>exhaust</b> <b>elbow</b> and exhaust extraction are cooled by water cooled panels. The walls of the lower vessel, balcony and roof delta zone are defined to consist of refractory material and are cooled by natural convection and thermal radiation to the ambient on the outside of the vessel. The results obtained with the numerical EAF model are used to evaluate the influence of the inclusion of the energy input due to the heating and increase in momentum of the furnace atmosphere drawn into and flowing out of the arc region on the conditions within the freeboard. Furthermore, the impact of the arc region flow on the post-combustion of CO to CO 2 in the freeboard for a free-burning arc length of 230 mm is compared to that for a free-burning arc length of only 50 mm. The modelling of the arc region has a large influence on the flow field, temperature distribution and post-combustion. The results show that due to the inclusion of the arc in- and outflow a total increase in the simulated energy input within the vessel of 4. 42 MW results. This is due to the correspondingly higher temperatures and circulation leading to an increase in the post-combustion of CO to CO 2 within the freeboard. The inclusion of the arc in- and outflow should therefore not be neglected in future EAF models. An increased slag height not only protects the cooling panels from the thermal radiation of the arcs. It also leads to a reduction in the interaction between the flow in the arc region and in the freeboard. This in turn reduces the amount of mixing of CO from the slag layer with the ingress air and therefore also the amount of post-combustion in the freeboard. As a result a decrease in the free-burning arc length from 230 mm to 50 mm leads to a reduction in the total energy input within the solution domain of 3. 22 MW. The numerical EAF simulation model developed during this thesis delivers valuable information which helps one to understand the heat and mass transfer processes taking place within the EAF freeboard. Furthermore, several important insights were gained concerning necessary future developments of the model...|$|E

50|$|On the 32 and 320, {{the engine}} exhaust exits above the waterline, usually via a rubber flap valve, {{and with no}} marine {{silencer}} used in the system {{due to lack of}} space available. Partly in order to offer some degree of attenuation of the (noticeable) exhaust booming noise, a characteristic of Corvettes, the latest 340 models have specially built 90 degree GRP <b>exhaust</b> <b>elbows</b> fitted to allow the engine exhaust to exit under water. These elbows have a small by-pass outlet with a flapper valve to prevent back flow. Also, the shape of the underside section is designed to promote suction to ensure that back pressure is within limits. To accommodate the underwater exhaust outlet, the trim tabs had to be cut away locally. Also on the 340, a fixed cavitation plate was added on the centreline between the trim tabs, {{as an extension of the}} hull lower surface. This fixed “interceptor” type trim tab helped bring the bow down at speed to improve the running angle and trim.|$|R

This study has successfully demonstrated this improvement and further engine testing (and possible manufacturing) is presently underway at Caterpillar Inc. Laboratories. Basically this program involved two subcontracts: one to Virginia Tech to develop sintering procedures for CMZP, and one to Caterpillar, Inc. to develop slip casting procedures for CMZP. Nearly 100 kg of CMZP were prepared by MATVA, Inc. and Virginia Tech for use by Caterpillar. Virginia Tech developed detailed sintering procedures for CMZP and Caterpillar developed slip casting procedures and manufactured several <b>exhaust</b> manifold <b>elbows.</b> These elbows have been cast into prototype cylinder heads and {{have been shown to be}} acceptable replacements for metal manifolds.

40|$|This article {{observes that}} dreams of {{treasure}} may {{not only be}} about getting rich. In Greece, a country with an illustrious ancient past and a less glorious present, history represents a vital national resource and enduring topic of social concern, not to say anxiety. Dreams of treasure arise as unconscious by-products of this intense historical consciousness in Greece. The treasures considered here are secretions of history, deposited at the moments of rupture that historians subsequently use to demarcate historical periods. Drawing upon the formulations of Heidegger and Binswanger, I further view these dreams as apperceptions of the temporality of being. The dream of treasure involves a divinatory look into the future to discover a past that will enrich the present. The motivations of historicization and temporalization thus converge in this case to create the dream of treasure as a significant cultural phenomenon in Greece.
