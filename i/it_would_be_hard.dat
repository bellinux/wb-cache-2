5|$|In 1922, {{he wrote}} and {{published}} privately a pamphlet This is the World that Man Made, or The New Creation that {{was influenced by the}} rationalist writing of Ray Lankester. In it Pick was pessimistic that mankind was not achieving its creative potential. He returned to the subject in lectures he gave in the 1930s when he outlined his concern that at some not too distant point progress in civilisation would come to a natural end and a stable condition would arise where, he believed, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> to maintain creativity and an entropic decline would follow. Later, {{in the last year of}} his life and with the Second World War under way, he published two booklets on post war reconstruction, Britain Must Rebuild and Paths to Peace. Pick wrote the introduction to the English translation of Walter Gropius's The New Architecture and the Bauhaus published in 1935.|$|E
5|$|After {{all that}} has been said and done, {{what are we to}} make of Lloyd George’s legacy as a war leader? On the home front he {{achieved}} varied results in tackling difficult, and in some instances, unprecedented problems. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> to have improved on his dealings with labour and the program to increase homegrown food, but in the sectors of manpower, price control and food distribution he adopted the same approach as his predecessor, taking action only in response to the changing nature of the conflict. In the vital area of national morale, while he did not have the technical advantages of Churchill, his personal conduct damaged his ability to do more to inspire the nation. All things considered, it is unlikely that any of his political contemporaries could have handled matters at home as effectively as he did, although it can be argued that if someone else had been in charge, the difference would not have been sufficient to change the final outcome. In his conduct of the war he did advance the cause of the Entente significantly in some ways, but in determining strategy, one of the most important tasks for which a prime minister must be responsible, he was undeniably a failure. To sum up, while Lord George's contributions outweighed his mistakes, the margin is too narrow, in my opinion, to include him In the pantheon of Britain's outstanding war leaders.|$|E
25|$|Carrying out a {{military}} plan in winter {{was not the}} major failure of the operation.

The IX and X Corps marched with maximum effectiveness given the conditions. The majority of the units managed to move to the correct positions.

25|$|The rise of DJs {{was really}} the next step for the Japanese hip hop scene. Before 1985, there weren't very many DJs on the radio, but with the {{increase}} in the number that year, it led to the opening of the first all hip hop club in 1986. But despite the fact that DJing caught on rather quickly, it was initially thought that rapping wasn't going to have the same cache as <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> to rap in Japanese.|$|E
25|$|Notably, while every {{witness to}} the Commission gave {{evidence}} of frequent corporal punishment, applied contrary to the regulations and therefore criminally, no Church witness came forward to certify a single such case. Difficulties arose where complainants or the accused were involved in parallel criminal or civil cases, such as the vaccine trials performed on inmate children. With such divergent views the CICA's task has been difficult and contentious, but it has agreed with the evidence given by the complainants.

25|$|Among the Doric temples, the Peisistratid Olympieion at Athens has {{a special}} position. Although this {{building}} was never completed, its architect apparently attempted to adapt the Ionic dipteros. Column drums built into the later foundations indicate that it was originally planned as a Doric temple. Nonetheless, its ground plan follows the Ionic examples of Samos so closely that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> to reconcile such a solution with a Doric triglyph frieze. After the expulsion of Hippias in 510 BC, work on this structure was stopped: Democratic Athens {{had no desire to}} continue a monument of tyrannical self-aggrandisation.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{his support}} among {{elements}} of the party, Zuma remained a powerful political figure, retaining a high position in the ANC even after his dismissal as the country's deputy president. A panel of political analysts convened in November 2005 agreed {{that if he was}} to be found innocent of the corruption charges brought against him, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> for any other potential ANC candidate to beat Zuma {{in the race for the}} country's presidency in 2009. However, these analysts also questioned whether Zuma was indeed a left-wing candidate of the sort that many of his supporters seem to seek, and noted that the global and national economic constraints that have shaped Mbeki's presidency would be no different in the next presidential term.|$|E
25|$|Decentralization {{is also a}} key ideological idea to technoliberalism, {{sought to}} work though the {{deregulation}} of rules that stop businesses competing with the government services. Decentralization means distributing the power away {{from the center of}} an organization, diffusing authority outwards to workers in the field. The rapid growth of information technology has aided this concept as the likes of the internet have made the distribution of information accessible and cheap. On the other hand, is the ideological idea of free markets. Strongly enforced rules would be needed here as this type of market would be based on supply and demand with little government control. Technoliberalist's believe that knowledge and technology can be geographically transferred without much difficulty or state action, envisaging a completely free market where buyers and sellers are allowed to transact unreservedly, based on a mutual agreement on price without state intervention in the form of taxes, subsidies or regulation. Whilst this is an idealized view, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> to implement.|$|E

25|$|On 12 August 2008, Komsomolskaya Pravda {{reported}} that in South Ossetia several soldiers were wounded and one was killed, who were from Tatarstan.

Lieutenant Aleksandr Popov was participating in the exercises on the height near Tskhinvali when his group was requested by the intelligence to reinforce them. According to Popov's mother, Popov told her he could see how the Georgians fired on Tskhinvali one week before the war. The mother of Eldar Lotfullin, 23-year-old contract soldier, said {{that she was able to}} call her son for the last time at around 10 PM MSK on 7 August 2008. Eldar Lotfullin told journalist that the Georgian tanks fired on his barracks on 8 August.

25|$|One {{theory is}} that these {{problems}} are caused by a structural contradiction within the euro system, the {{theory is that}} there is a monetary union (common currency) without a fiscal union (e.g., common taxation, pension, and treasury functions). In the Eurozone system, the countries are required to follow a similar fiscal path, but they do not have common treasury to enforce it. That is, countries with the same monetary system have freedom in fiscal policies in taxation and expenditure. So, even though there are some agreements on monetary policy and through the European Central Bank, countries may not be able to or would simply choose not to follow it. This feature brought fiscal free riding of peripheral economies, especially represented by Greece, as it is hard to control and regulate national financial institutions. Furthermore, there is also a problem that the Eurozone system has a difficult structure for quick response. Eurozone, having 18 nations as its members, require unanimous agreement for a decision making process. This would lead to failure in complete prevention of contagion of other areas, as <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> for the Eurozone to respond quickly to the problem.|$|E
25|$|After {{close to}} a month without {{international}} cricket, Australia toured India for two Tests and three one-day games in October, in {{what would be the}} team's last Test series ahead of the summer's Ashes in Australia. Haddin again failed to recover sufficiently for the series and Paine was named wicket-keeper. In a drawn three-day first-class match before the Test series, Paine scored a slow 45 and zero; failing to capitalise on his promotion to four in the batting order for the second innings. Returning to the traditional wicket-keepers spot of seven for the Test series, Paine battled to his highest Test score, 92 from 196 balls, in the first innings of the First Test in Mohali. In hot conditions, he displayed good shot selection and concentration, despite suffering from cramp in the latter stages of his innings. Still, when Australia was bowled out soon after his dismissal, Paine assumed wicket-keeper duties for India’s innings, where he took two catches. In his team's second innings, however, Paine scored only nine, as Australia collapsed to set India a target of 216 runs. They achieved the score with just one wicket remaining; Paine taking one catch. After the Test, Melbourne newspaper The Herald Sun, wrote an article saying that Paine could become Australia's future Test captain. The Second Test saw him continue his good form with the bat, scoring 59 and 9, but Australia lost the match and the series 2–0. Afterwards, former Australian wicket-keeper Rodney Marsh suggested <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> for Haddin to regain his spot in the Australian team for the Ashes. India won the opening one-dayer and therefore took the series 1–0 when rain washed out the remaining two matches. Paine struggled in the match, compiling 9 from 24 balls.|$|E

[...] Stephen Saito of IFC.com wrote, [...] "It touches on larger themes of mass unemployment, cultural alienation and technology as a crutch. But ultimately, it's really an expertly done character study that's a dramatic change of pace from director Jason Reitman's previous two films." [...] Jonathan Romney of The Independent wrote, [...] "Its cynical wit almost places it in the Billy Wilder bracket: Up In The Air is as eloquent about today's executive culture as The Apartment was about that of 1960. It is a brutal, desolate film – but also a superb existential rom-com, and the most entertaining lesson in contemporary socio-economics that you could hope for." [...] Roger Ebert gave the film four stars and wrote, [...] "This isn't a comedy. If it were, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> to laugh in these last days of 2009. Nor is it a tragedy.
