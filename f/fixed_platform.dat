500|$|The last provincial {{election}} {{had been}} held in June 1917, and four years was the normal life of a legislature in Canada. [...] Stewart called an election for July 19. [...] Though the Liberals' fortunes had been sagging in the post-war years, there remained no doubt that they could again defeat the Conservatives; their real challenge was evidently from the newly politicized UFA. [...] Bolstering this challenge by increasing farmers' discontent was a collapse of agricultural prices. [...] The UFA had no leader, no <b>fixed</b> <b>platform,</b> and no inclination to attack Stewart or his government. [...] What it did have was superior organization, and on election day this organization made itself felt {{in the form of}} thirty-nine UFA members elected to fourteen Liberals. [...] Stewart, who has been acclaimed in his own riding of Sedgewick, announced that he would resign as Premier as soon as the UFA had selected somebody to replace him. [...] Once it selected Herbert Greenfield, Stewart made good on his pledge, and Greenfield replaced him August 13.|$|E

2500|$|In the Cornish {{examples}} {{the motive}} power {{was provided by}} waterwheels, {{or one of the}} mine's steam engines. The steam engine or water wheel would be linked to a series of beams – known as [...] "rods" [...] – [...] fastened together and reaching {{to the bottom of the}} mineshaft. [...] These were arranged to offer a reciprocating motion of, typically, twelve to fifteen feet (three to five metres). Small foot platforms were attached to the rods at the same distance apart as the engine stroke and fixed platforms were built onto the shaft walls, spaced to coincide with the top and bottom positions of each of the moving platforms. The moving platforms were often small, typically [...] square, to make the miner stand close to the centre-line of the rod and thus keep a safe distance from the sides of the shaft. For the same reason, grab handles were fitted directly above each one. To go up or down, the miner would step onto the travelling platform and allow himself to be carried to the next <b>fixed</b> <b>platform,</b> where he would step off and wait. At the end of the next stroke the next moving platform would line up and he could step onto it and repeat the process. [...] Miners could ascend and descend at the same time: the pause at the changeover point was made long enough for two men to change places. Counterweights – large boxes filled with stones attached through [...] "see-sawing" [...] horizontal beams – were installed to avoid the full weight of the shaft and men bearing on the top linkage. In the deepest mines, which could sink to more than 350fathoms (640metres), extra counterweights were provided at regular intervals, in horizontal side galleries.|$|E
