40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the effect of various rates of phosphorus fertilizer and efficiency amount of broadcasting and banding methods on yield and yield components of corn (Zea mays L.), a field experiment were arranged in a split-plot design based on a randomized complete block design with four replications at the Research field, Ramin Agricultural and Natural Resources University, Mollathani, Khouzestan, Iran, during 2008 growing season. Treatments included: phosphorus various amounts (0, 150 and 300 kg. ha- 1) as main factor from triple-super phosphate source, and fertilization methods (broadcast fertilizer, banding fertilizer in depths of 10, 20 cm and <b>double</b> <b>banding</b> application in depths of 10 and 20 cm), as sub factor. The results indicated that interaction of phosphorus fertilizer various rates and fertilization methods {{did not have a}} significant effect on yield and yield components of corn grain (exception biological yield). However, all various phosphorus fertilizer rates and fertilization methods caused significant differences among grain yield, harvest index and the number grain per row. Between the number of grains per m 2 and 1000 -Kernel were signification differences while fertilizer rates were not significantly different on traits. The number row per ear was not affected by any treatments. In addition, grain yield of <b>double</b> <b>banding</b> treatment was 34 % higher than broadcast fertilizer (control) and in fertilizer rate of 150 kg. ha- 1 36 % it was higher than 0 kg. ha- 1...|$|E
40|$|AbstractJC virus (JCV) encodes a small basic phosphoprotein {{from the}} late coding region called agnoprotein, which {{has been shown to}} play {{important}} regulatory roles in the viral replication cycle. In this study, we report that agnoprotein forms highly stable dimers and higher order oligomer complexes. This was confirmed by immunoblotting and mass spectrometry studies. These complexes are extremely resistant to strong denaturing agents, including urea and SDS. Central portion of the protein, amino acids spanning from 17 to 42 is important for dimer/oligomer formation. Removal of 17 to 42 aa region from the viral background severely affected the efficiency of the JCV replication. Extracts prepared from JCV-infected cells showed a <b>double</b> <b>banding</b> pattern for agnoprotein in vivo. Collectively, these findings suggest that agnoprotein forms functionally active homodimer/oligomer complexes and these may be important for its function during viral propagation and thus for the progression of PML...|$|E
40|$|Polymorphism of {{microsatellite}} markers {{is often}} associated with the simple sequence repeat motif targeted. AT-rich microsatellites tend to be highly variable and this appears to be notable, especially in legume genomes. To analyze the value of AT-rich microsatellites for common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), we developed a total of 85 new microsatellite markers, 74 of which targeted ATA or other AT-rich motif loci and 11 of which were made for GA, CA or CAC motif loci. We evaluated the loci for the level of allelic diversity in comparison to previously characterized microsatellites using a panel of 18 standard genotypes and genetically mapped any loci polymorphic in the DOR 364 × G 19833 population. The majority of the microsatellites produced single bands and detected single loci, however, 15 of the AT-rich microsatellites produced multiple or <b>double</b> <b>banding</b> patterns; while only one of the GA or CA-rich microsatellites did. The polymorphism information content (PIC) values averaged 0. 892 and 0. 600 for the AT and ATA motif microsatellites, respectively, but only 0. 140 for the CA-rich microsatellites. GA microsatellites, which had a large average number of repeats, had high to intermediate PIC, averaging 0. 706. A total of 45 loci could be genetically mapped and distribution of the loci across the genome was skewed towards non-distal locations with a greater prevalence of loci on linkage groups b 02, b 09 and b 11. AT-rich microsatellites were found to be a useful source of polymorphic markers for mapping and diversity assessment in common bean that appears to uncover higher diversity than other types of simple sequence repeat markers.

This lattice covers the entire surface Divalent cations arc important in the stabilization of this particular hexagonal array of particles When a synaptic disc-rich fraction is treated with chelating agents (EDTA or EGTA), definite changes occur in the hexagonal lattice.

40|$|Melting of DNA in {{a segment}} bounded {{at both ends}} by regions of greater {{stability}} during electrophoresis in denaturing gradient gels show complex properties, not accommodated with standard melting theory. Compact bands of some DNA molecules become anomalously broadened at the retardation level in a denaturing gradient, or <b>double</b> <b>bands</b> may appear in a uniform denaturant concentration. These properties are associated only with molecules for which the distribution of stability calculated by the Poland-Fixman-Freire algorithms indicates that the region of lowest stability does not extend to an end of the molecule. Retention of helicity at the ends is shown by {{the difference in the}} effect of base substitution in the end domains and in the least stable domain. Both the appearance of <b>double</b> <b>bands</b> and band broadening can be explained by invoking a hypothetical metastable intermediate in melting, which is converted into the equilibrium melted form at a relatively slow rate, depending on both denaturant concentration and field strength. A kinetic model permits plausible rate constants to be inferred from the patterns.

40|$|The {{characteristics}} of lead- and n~anganese-activated ca mium fluorophosphates and homologous materials containing aluminum, barium, calcium, strontium, mag-nesium, zinc, sodium, and potassium as partial replacements for cadmium are described. With low activator concentrations in cadmium fluorophosphate, a <b>double</b> <b>band</b> emission is obtained with peaks at 4500. ~ and 5900. ~. At high activator concentrations the blue peak is suppressed.
