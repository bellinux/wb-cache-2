40|$|The unjacketed core {{compressibility}} in a {{porous rock}} {{is the change}} in pore volume due to change in pore pressure for constant differential pressure. This parameter affects how the saturated bulk modulus of a rock {{is related to the}} drained <b>frame</b> <b>modulus</b> and the pore fluid compressibility. Recent measurements of poroelastic constants and effective medium theories are used to estimate how the pore compressibility depends on effective stress and how uncertainty in the pore compressibility affects uncertainty in Gassmann' equation estimates of the saturated bulk modulus. Results for Berea sandstone and for models of sand-clay mixtures show that the estimate of the change in the saturated bulk modulus due to substitution of different fluids in the rock may differ in size by a factor of two or more if the pore compressibility is approximately equal to the fluid compressibility instead of the grain compressibility. In general, the order of magnitude and sign of the pore compressibility cannot be determined from solid and fluid compressibility information alone...|$|E
40|$|A {{suite of}} sand {{samples from the}} Gulf of Mexico {{was used for the}} study. Although samples are limited, current results are significant. In this {{abstract}} we summarize measured results and reveal the application for DHI techniques. Summary In deep-water sedimentary processes, compaction is a major force for porosity reduction, which incorporates sediment texture such as grain size and sorting. Measured data suggest that porosity, fluid saturation and differential pressure are main parameters to affect velocities of weakly cemented deep-water sands. Geological compaction and possible weak cementation can reduce porosity from 35 % to less than 25 % and increase rock <b>frame</b> <b>modulus,</b> especially shear modulus. This causes an increase of dry modulus with decreasing porosity associated with an increase in burial depth. However, water saturation effect on bulk modulus from dry state tends to be less dependent on porosity. This is consistently different from the sorting effect on the velocities observed on artificial samples made by sand and glass bean mixture (Zimmer, et al., 2002). Texture of deep-water sands Core samples come from two wells with the water depth of 4000 ft and two reservoir formations at depths of 12000 ft (shallow) and 17700 ft (deep) respectively. Porosity, bulk and grain density were measured as shown in Figure 1. Data shows that there are three groups of samples, separated by porosity: 8 shallow samples have very high porosity (VHP) of 30 to 35 %; 17 deep samples have high porosity (HP) ranged from 24 to 30 %. The low porosity samples are silt and shale, which is not focus for this study...|$|E
40|$|Biot's theory - which {{explains}} how sediments respond to stresses - {{has been applied}} to different sea-bed sediments. To successfully use Biot's theory as a predictive tool, sensitivity studies showed the following experimental measurements are required: the <b>frame</b> bulk <b>modulus.</b> the shear modulus, the tortuosity, the permeability and the porosity. These properties were determined for turbidite sediments from the North Atlantic Ocean (Site 1). and carbonates from the Western Indian Ocean -. (Site 2). The following experimental observations " were made: the permeability varies over 7 orders of magnitude for turbidites from Site 1 due to technique dependent and intrinsic reasons; in-situ shear moduli are 4 times greater than values determined from samples in the laboratory; shear modulus results from resonant column and bender element transducer techniques agree well: experiments designed for obtaining the <b>frame</b> bulk <b>modulus</b> are problematic, {{and it is difficult to}} determine pore size / geometry parameters apart from the tortuosity. Biot's theory was used to predict the response of sea-bed sediments to hydrodynamic and ultrasonic stresses. A new low frequency hydrodynamic boundary-value solution was developed from Biot's theory, allowing predictions of tidally-induced pore-pressures. Comparisons between predictions and in-situ measurements at Site 1 were favourable, verifying Biot's theory at low frequencies. At ultrasonic frequencies, Biot predictions of the velocity and attenuation of fast and slow compressional waves were compared to experimental measurements. The slow wave was argued to be induced at free-flow boundaries. and was found to be very difficult to detect in soft water-saturated sediments. A qualitative agreement was shown between Biot fast wave attenuation predictions and new experimental attenuation measurements on a bar of sandstone. For Sites 1 and 2, Biot predictions for the increases in the fast wave velocity for high porosity - permeability sediments agreed with experimental measurements. Elsewhere in the literature, this behaviour has been linked to an increase of the <b>frame</b> bulk <b>modulus</b> with increases in porosity. Alternatively, it was argued such increases in fast wave velocity can be attributed to Biot's dispersion mechanism. and hence are a verification of his theory at high frequencies...|$|R
40|$|Acoustic {{data from}} two long cores, {{comprising}} marine clays and silts taken from Emerald Basin off Nova Scotia, are presented. High‐resolution measurements of compressional wavevelocity,attenuation, and power law exponent are made using ultrasonic frequencies between 100 to 1000 kHz. The observed {{values of the}} frequency dependence of attenuation suggest that a nonconstant Q mechanism is needed to explain these data, and Biot–Stoll theory is used to model the experimental results. An inversion scheme is used to constrain physical parameters in the Biot–Stoll dispersion relation. The inversion shows {{that there is a}} restricted range of permeability and grain size. By assigning reasonable values for grain size in the inversion, the Biot–Stoll model predicts unique values for the permeability and <b>frame</b> bulk <b>modulus</b> that agree well with estimates made by other means...|$|R
40|$|This report {{includes}} {{discussions of}} elastic and viscoelastic models for water-saturated porous media, and measurements and computations of elastic constants including compressibility, incompressibility (bulk modulus), rigidity (shear modulus), Lamé's constant, Poisson's ratio, density, and compressional- and shear-wave velocity. The sediments involved are from three major physiographic provinces in the North Pacific and adjacent areas: continental terrace (shelf and slope), abyssal plain (turbidite), and abyssal hill (pelagic). It is concluded that for small stresses (such {{as from a}} sound wave), water-saturated sediments respond elastically, and that the elastic equations of the Hookean model {{can be used to}} compute unmeasured elastic constants. However, to account for wave attenuation, the favored model is ‘nearly elastic,’ or linear viscoelastic. In this model the rigidity modulus μ and Lamé's constant λ in the equations of elasticity, are replaced by complex Lamé constants (μ + iμ′) and (λ + iλ′), which are independent of frequency; μ and λ represent elastic response (as in the Hookean model), and iμ′ and iλ′ represent damping of wave energy. This model implies that wave velocities and the specific dissipation function 1 /Q are independent of frequency, and attenuation in decibels per unit length varies linearly with frequency in the range from a few hertz to the megahertz range. The components of the water-mineral system bulk modulus are porosity, the bulk modulus of pore water, an aggregate bulk modulus of mineral grains, and a bulk modulus of the structure, or frame, formed by the mineral grains. Good values of these components are available in the literature, except for the <b>frame</b> bulk <b>modulus.</b> A relationship between porosity and dynamic <b>frame</b> bulk <b>modulus</b> was established that allowed computation of a system bulk modulus that was used with measured values of density and compressional-wave velocity to compute other elastic constants. Some average laboratory values for common sediment types are given. The underlying methods of computation should apply to any water-saturated sediment. If this is so, values given in this paper predict elastic constants for the major sediment types...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{interpretation}} of seismoelectrical signals {{is a difficult}} task because coseismic and seismoelectric converted signals are recorded simultaneously and the seismoelectric conversions are typically several orders of magnitude smaller than the coseismic electrical signals. The seismic and seismoelectric signals are modeled using a finite-element code with perfectly matched layer boundary conditions assuming a linear poroelastic body. We present a stochastic joint inversion of the seismic and seismoelectrical data based on the adaptive Metropolis algorithm, to obtain the posterior probability density functions of the material properties of each geologic unit. This includes the permeability, porosity, electrical conductivity, bulk modulus of the dry porous <b>frame,</b> bulk <b>modulus</b> of the fluid, bulk modulus of the solid phase, and shear modulus of the formations. A test {{of this approach is}} performed with a synthetic model comprising two horizontal layers and a reservoir partially saturated with oil, which is embedded in the second layer. The result of the joint inversion shows that we can invert the permeability of the reservoir and its mechanical properties. © 2010 Society of Exploration Geophysicist...|$|R
40|$|An ac {{conductivity}} {{as well as}} dielectric relaxation {{property of}} La 2 NiO 4. 1 is reported in the temperature range of 77 [*]K– 130 [*]K and in the frequency range of 20 [*]Hz– 1 [*]MHz. Complex impedance plane plots show that the relaxation (conduction) mechanism in this material is purely a bulk effect arising from the semiconductive grain. The relaxation mechanism has been discussed in the <b>frame</b> of electric <b>modulus</b> spectra. The scaling behavior of the modulus suggests that the relaxation mechanism describes the same mechanism at various temperatures. The logarithmic angular frequency dependence of the loss peak is found to obey the Arrhenius law with the activation energy of ~ 0. 09 [*]eV. The frequency-dependent electrical data are also analyzed {{in the frame of}} ac conductivity formalism. The ac conductivity has been found to follow a power-law behavior at a limited temperature and frequency region where Anderson localization plays {{a significant role in the}} transport mechanism for La 2 NiO 4. 1...|$|R
40|$|In a porous medium {{saturated}} with a fluid electrolyte, mechanical and electromagnetic disturbances are coupled. The coupling is electrokinetic in nature {{since it is}} due to an excess of electrolyte ions that exist in an electric double layer near the grain sur-faces within the material. Mechanically-induced streaming currents generated by point sources in homogeneous, isotropic porous media are presented. The electrically-induced streaming current is shown to be second-order in the electrokinetic coupling coefficient and can be neglected. This decouples the mechanical behavior from the electromagnetic behavior {{with respect to the}} induced fluxes and simplifies the analysis of the relative fluid flow and dynamic streaming current. We used Biot theory to calculate the amount of induced relative flow by the solution to Green's function. The transport coefficients-conductivity, dynamic permeability, and the electrokinetic coupling coefficient-and their sensitivity with respect to porosity, dc permeability, and frequency changes are evaluated. Conductivity decreases with increasing dc permeability. It has a k 01 / 2 dependence when grain surface conductances are more important than the bulk fluid phase conductivity. Stationary phase relative flow and streaming current solutions are calculated for an explosive and vertical point source acting on the bulk and a volume injection source acting on the fluid. The streaming currents are induced both by P and S waves. The streaming current decreases with increasing fluid conductivity. This is consistent with the decrease of the diffuse double layer thickness and (-potential. The porosity effect on the streaming current induced by S waves is different from the currents induced by the P waves. The porosity affects the bulk moduli of the solid. Its effect, combined with the <b>frame</b> bulk <b>modulus</b> and compressibility of the saturatin...|$|R
40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) This thesis {{presents}} a comprehensive, macroscopic material {{model for the}} in-plane behaviour of brick masonry and describes its incorporation into an incremental, non-linear finite element computer model capable of simulating the behaviour of masonry {{at all levels of}} applied load. The material model is derived from a large number of biaxial tests on half scale brick masonry panels and consists of elastic and in-elastic deformation characteristics and a failure criterion. In the elastic range, the brick masonry behaves, on average, isotropically. However, its in-elastic stress-strain relations and failure criterion are significantly influenced by the presence of mortar joints acting as planes of weakness. The material model allows the brick masonry to be modelled as a continuum. Despite the fact that the influence of individual bricks and joints is averaged, depending on the state of stress, the failure can occur in the joints alone, in a combined mechanism involving both brick and joint or by crushing and s palling of the masonry. The results of the finite element model have been verified by comparing the results of racking and vertical load tests on steel frames with brick masonry infill. Infilled frames of varying height/length ratio and frame/wall stiffness and infill panels of differing curing history (and hence differing strength) have been considered. Sensitivity analyses of the parameters of the material model have been carried out with reference to racking tests on infilled <b>frames.</b> The <b>modulus</b> of elasticity and the strength parameters were found to be the most significant properties of masonry. The model has also been used to carry out a study of infilled frame and shear wall behaviour. In both cases various geometries and relative strength parameters have been used and their significance on the strength of walls investigated. These studies illustrate the potential of the model as both a research tool and as an aid to design...|$|R
40|$|Ultra high {{performance}} concrete (UHPC) with 28 d compressive strengths up to 200 N/mm 2 contain high amounts of cement and silica fume at low w/c-ratios {{as well as}} highly effective superplasticizers. Such compositions enhance chemical and autogenous shrinkage. The development of stress due to restraint and thus the risk of cracking {{as well as the}} relaxation behaviour of UHPC was investigated under isothermal conditions (20 °C) using the rigid cracking <b>frame.</b> The elastic <b>modulus,</b> tensile splitting strength, free deformation and the stress induced by restraining the autogenous deformation were measured from initial setting up to an age of 28 days. The effect of cement type, w/c-ratio and silica fume content on the development of deformation and restraint stress due to hydration reactions and self-desiccation were investigated. For Portland cement concrete at early ages between 12 and 15 h the risk of cracking was very high. At ages above 28 days the stress due to the restraint of the autogenous deformation was independent of the type of cement. The stress was about 40 % of the splitting tensile stress. However, later crack formation and failure due additional stress at discontinuities (e. g. air voids, corners, notches) can not be excluded. ...|$|R
40|$|Three {{expeditions to}} the Ontong-Java Plateau {{and the eastern}} {{equatorial}} Pacific obtained unusually good samples of calcareous sediment from box and piston cores; water depths ranged from 1600 m to 4900 m. Two sedimentary environments are represented. Dissolution, dilution, and winnowing cause reductions (with increasing water depth) of CaCO 3, percent sand, mean grain size, sediment rigidity, and sound velocity. The best indices to predict sound velocity are percent sand, mean grain size, and the velocity ratio; this ratio varies from about 1. 05 {{on top of the}} Plateau to about 1. 00 at 4400 m. Hollow tests of Foraminifera act as solid particles in transmitting sound. Density and porosity are good predictors of velocity in the east Pacific but not in the Plateau area because of large amounts of hollow Foraminifera. There is no significant increase in sound velocity as CaCO 3 increases from 35 to about 75 percent; above that percent, increases in velocity are mainly due to increases in sand-size particles. Eastern Pacific sediment has higher porosities and lower densities (than the Plateau samples) because of less CaCO 3 and more biogenous silica. Biogenous silica content causes good correlation between density and CaCO 3 content in the eastern Pacific but not in the Plateau sediment; density or impedance cannot be used to determine CaCO 3 content in sediment lacking significant amounts of biogenous silica. As water depth increases from 1600 m to 4900 m, percent sand and mean grain size decrease markedly but total porosity increases only 1 to 3 percent. This is due to dissolution and breakdown of hollow tests of Foraminifera and transfer of intraparticle porosity (within the tests) to interparticle porosity between the grains. New estimates of intraparticle porosity range from 13 percent in clayey sand to zero in silty clay. New relations between the <b>frame</b> bulk <b>modulus</b> and porosity allow computations of elastic properties which indicate very small differences in bulk moduli or densities over wide ranges of grain sizes and water depths, but large changes in dynamic rigidities cause both shear and compressional wave velocities to decrease with increasing water depth...|$|R
40|$|The {{understanding}} of the settling behaviour and subsequent consolidation of sediments deposited under water has been hampered by the difficulty of recovering high quality samples. There is a need therefore to correlate in situ seismo-acoustic properties of these soils to the geotechnical properties required by engineers. To this end a laboratory study was made during which an instrumented sedimentation column was developed. This apparatus allowed the successful monitoring of compressional wave velocity, shear wave velocity, electrical resistivity, pore pressure and bulk density {{in a number of}} natural marine sediments consolidating under self weight introduced into the column as a homogeneous slurry. The seismo-acoustic responses of the sediment samples were observed during primary consolidation, a period of over a thousand hours in some cases. Shear waves were found to be small amplitude waves travelling at velocities of less than Ilm/s. Shear wave velocity was subject to time dependent increase, or creep, thought to be a result of continued clay particle floc interaction during secondary consolidation. The velocity increased with decreasing porosity and increasing overburden but the effect of creep meant that no unique velocity-porosity relationship exists. Empirical relationships were established {{in order to determine the}} degree of consolidation and frame compressibility via shear wave velocity measurement. The Biot theory was used to predict the variation of compressional wave velocity as a function of porosity, bulk density and permeability. <b>Frame</b> and shear <b>modulus</b> measurements indicated that the model is justified in assuming weak soil frame parameters and a mass coupl ing factor equal to unity. The continually changing velocity relationship with porosity and bulk density can be satisfactorily modelled using the Geertsma and smit model. The full Biot model was found to predict permeability with reasonable accuracy in high porosity sediments but failed when applied to lower porosity soils. Results suggested that the soils studied exhibited anisotropy with respect to permeability...|$|R
