40|$|The NSV {{project was}} {{initiated}} at the Electronics and Nuclear Instrumentation Department (DEIN) of the French Atomic Energy Agency (CEA) in 1994. The main goals were {{the development of}} new signal validation methods to be applied on-line to neutron sensors in nuclear power plants. The methods used today are based on the use of DC reference curves, e. g. saturation curves for boron <b>ionisation</b> <b>chambers,</b> which requires the inhibition of the measurement, and are frequently not sensitive enough to predict any future sensor degradation. Some theoretic work done on fission and boron <b>ionisation</b> <b>chambers</b> signal modelling proved that these signals carry very interesting information regarding the sensor integrity not only in the DC part, but also in the AC part.

40|$|It {{needs no}} {{introduction}} that good measurements regarding BNCT dosimetry are of vital interest. Above all, calculations for patient treatment planning are initially {{based on these}} measurements. Closely related, well understood dosimetry of mixed neutron and gamma fields is necessary to explain the outcomes of the many experiments performed. It is believed that the sometimes confusing and incomprehensible outcomes in BNCT research are due to incorrect dosimetry, i. e. misleading measurements. A popular detector {{used to describe the}} absorbed neutron and gamma doses is the <b>ionisation</b> <b>chamber.</b> To understand better the behaviour and intricacies of this detector, the collected and measured current is directly simulated with MCNPX. This Monte Carlo code is able to track neutrons, gammas and electrons all around and in the <b>ionisation</b> <b>chamber.</b> The calculated dose deposited by the electrons in the gas is proportional to the current measured. Protons and alphas emanating from the wall and/or gas materials due to nuclear reactions can also cause ionisations and thus add to the current. A custom-made program has been written to simulate this contribution. The issue in this study is that a disagreement between simulated and measured current can be caused by the computer code and/or measurement set-up and/or unknown influences of source and/or materials. Therefore, the model of the <b>ionisation</b> <b>chamber</b> as well as the neutron and gamma source descriptions are validated step-by-step. After having obtained enough confidence in the model it can be concluded that <b>ionisation</b> <b>chamber</b> measurements can be significantly affected by neutron interactions (this is energy dependent). Neutrons can increase the measured current due to unknown and unconsidered beta-, proton- and/or alpha-producers in the wall material and gas; this dose component does not exist without the presence of the <b>ionisation</b> <b>chamber.</b> JRC.
