50|$|Because the <b>folk</b> <b>songs</b> {{of various}} areas are {{categorized}} under Dongbu <b>folk</b> <b>songs,</b> their vocal styles and modes are limited. Therefore, currently, scholars {{are attempting to}} categorize the Dongbu <b>folk</b> <b>songs</b> further, based on different musical features. These songs are mostly simple and bright. Namdo <b>folk</b> <b>songs</b> are those of Jeolla Province {{and a part of}} Chungcheong Province. While the <b>folk</b> <b>songs</b> of other regions are mostly musically simple. The <b>folk</b> <b>songs</b> of the Namdo region, where the famous musical genres pansori and sanjo were created, are rich and dramatic. Some Namdo <b>folk</b> <b>songs</b> are used in pansori or developed by professional singers and are included as part of their repertories. Jeju <b>folk</b> <b>songs</b> are sung on Jeju Island. Jeju <b>folk</b> <b>songs</b> are more abundant in number than any other regional <b>folk</b> <b>songs,</b> and approximately 1600 songs are transmitted today. Jeju <b>folk</b> <b>songs</b> are characterized by their simple and unique melodic lines and rich texts.|$|R

5|$|As well {{as using}} <b>folk</b> <b>song</b> tunes in his compositions, Vaughan Williams was an {{important}} figure in the first English <b>Folk</b> <b>Song</b> revival. He collected his first song, Bushes and Briars, from Mr Charles Pottipher, a seventy-year-old labourer from Ingrave, Essex in 1903, {{and went on to}} collect over 800 songs, as well as some singing games and dance tunes. For 10 years he devoted up to 30 days a year to collecting folk songs from singers in 21 English counties, though Essex, Norfolk, Herefordshire and Sussex account for over two thirds of the songs in his collection. He recorded a small number of songs using a phonograph but the vast majority were recorded by hand. He was a regular contributor to the <b>Folk</b> <b>Song</b> Society's Journal, a member of the society's committee from 1904 to 1946, and when in that year the society amalgamated with the English Folk Dance Society he became president of the English Folk Dance and Song Society, a position he held until his death.|$|E

5|$|It {{was later}} {{claimed by the}} Nazis that Wessel also wrote the music to the song, but it was {{considered}} {{more likely that the}} tune was in reality adapted from a World War I German Imperial Navy song, and was probably originally a <b>folk</b> <b>song.</b> The authorship of the melody was finally determined by a German court in 1937 as not by Wessel.|$|E

5|$|The {{scholarly}} {{study of}} music in the United States includes work relating music to social class, racial, ethnic and religious identity, gender and sexuality, as well as studies of music history, musicology, and other topics. The academic study of American music {{can be traced back}} to the late 19th century, when researchers like Alice Fletcher and Francis La Flesche studied the music of the Omaha peoples, working for the Bureau of American Ethnology and the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology. In the 1890s and into the early 20th century, musicological recordings were made among indigenous, Hispanic, African-American and Anglo-American peoples of the United States. Many worked for the Library of Congress, first under the leadership of Oscar Sonneck, chief of the Library's Music Divisions. These researchers included Robert W. Gordon, founder of the Archive of American <b>Folk</b> <b>Song,</b> and John and Alan Lomax; Alan Lomax was the most prominent of several <b>folk</b> <b>song</b> collectors who helped to inspire the 20th century roots revival of American folk culture.|$|E

Its symphony is embellished with percussive sounds, British and Irish <b>folk</b> <b>song</b> elements, and stylistic innovations from contemporary arranger Gerald Wilson.|$|E

5|$|Called {{by nearly}} a dozen {{different}} names and with varying words, melodies and purpose but common themes, the song's history reflects many of the evolutionary changes and cross-currents of American music. It begins early in the 19th century with a backwoods preacher who wrote hymns, persists through that century, manifests itself in a 1930s gospel blues recording done in a prison by a blind inmate convicted of murder, and sees use in the 1950s as a <b>folk</b> <b>song,</b> before attaining its realization by Jefferson Airplane. Several of these different variants of the song are still performed in the 21st century.|$|E
5|$|Grove lists {{more than}} thirty works by Vaughan Williams for {{orchestra}} or band {{over and above the}} symphonies. They include two of his most popular works—the Fantasia on a Theme by Thomas Tallis (1910, revised 1919), and The Lark Ascending, originally for violin and piano (1914); orchestrated 1920. Other works that survive in the repertoire in Britain are the Norfolk Rhapsody No 1 (1905–06), The Wasps, Aristophanic suite—particularly the overture (1909), the English <b>Folk</b> <b>Song</b> Suite (1923) and the Fantasia on Greensleeves (1934).|$|E

He employed Orthodox liturgical {{themes in the}} Russian Easter Festival Overture, <b>folk</b> <b>song</b> in Capriccio Espagnol and orientalism in Scheherazade, possibly his best known work. He proved a prolific composer but also a perpetually self-critical one. He revised every orchestral work {{up to and including}} his Third Symphony—some, like Antar and Sadko, more than once. These revisions range from minor changes of tempo, phrasing and instrumental detail to wholesale transposition and complete recomposition.|$|E
40|$|<b>Folk</b> <b>songs</b> are the {{valuable}} cultural storehouse {{of a people}} or an ethnic group, because the original life styles, thoughts, view of marriage and love of a people all find their expressions in <b>folk</b> <b>songs.</b> <b>Folk</b> <b>songs</b> {{have been trying to}} tell the rise and decline of its cultures and its peoples in their own ways. They began to come into being almost from the time when the people or the ethnic group formed. Home is an eternal topic in most <b>folk</b> <b>songs.</b> Homesick songs make up a premier category of Horqin <b>folk</b> <b>songs.</b> The image of home is also indispensable in American cowboy songs. This paper tries to build a bridge between two seemingly distant cultures by comparing the image of home in Mongolian Horqin lyric <b>folk</b> <b>songs</b> with that in American western cowboy songs. Both of these <b>folk</b> <b>songs</b> are trying to present the real stories of authentic people as their topics even if some rhetorical devices are employed sometimes in order to show more vivid characters. Characters in both songs are lonely. The spiritual and physical loneliness of the characters in both songs is so much alike. But the dissimilarities are more obvious. The different historical and cultural backgrounds and the distinct geographical and social environment of two <b>folk</b> <b>songs</b> are the best explanation to these dissimilarities. </p...|$|R

In its most common form it relies on a double repetition, rather than a rhyming scheme, which is a frequently employed device in children's rhymes and stories.

We took the southern part of Chittagong (Lohagara, Satkania, Chandanaish and Patiya) as our research area, selected a village namely Chunati in the systematic sampling and more than 100 people were interviewed through focus group discussion and key informant interviews. The sufficient literature review is also done. People in this area love nature a lot. Here music personnel were born from time to time who not only worked for the musical development but also created consciousness among people to love nature and save it. We discussed about the origin of <b>Folk</b> <b>Songs,</b> pattern of <b>Folk</b> <b>Songs</b> to clarify the importance of <b>Folk</b> <b>Songs</b> of Chittagong for its connection to Folklore and at the same time for promoting the idea of Nature Conservation. Of course, this part of studies deserves more attention in the field of research. Our ultimate goal should be to conserve and promote <b>Folk</b> <b>Songs</b> of Chittagong with yearlong heritage that automatically will later enrich Folklore and Nature Conservation...|$|R
