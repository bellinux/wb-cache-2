It is shown that this innovative plaster is able to degrade indoor air pollutants such as VOC´s, Ammonia and Formaldehyde efficiently even at low UV intensities. The simultaneous formation of harmless CO 2 indicates the complete mineralisation of organic compounds during this photocatalytic oxidation process. As demonstrated in a field test, the indoor air improving effect of the commercial product maxit airfresh is working in practice...|$|R
5000|$|For quality work, {{or where}} the wall is out of plumb {{requiring}} a large variation in render thickness, a thin [...] "scratch" [...] render coat is first applied then a second coat finished as described above. After around 24 hours the render has dried but before the <b>final</b> <b>plaster</b> <b>coat</b> is applied a trowel is used to scrape loose sand grains from the surface which would otherwise spoil the plaster finish.|$|R
40|$|Incorporating {{phase change}} {{materials}} (PCM) in plasters {{is an effective}} solution both for more efficient use of energy and its consumption reduction, because it allows the use of free energy in the environment, by latent heat storage. As PCM has not binder properties, {{it is expected to}} decrease mechanical properties of the final mortar. Also the density of the mortar decreases due to PCM lighter specific weight. In order {{to be used as a}} <b>final</b> <b>coat</b> for wall <b>plastering,</b> it must verify the requirements of the respective European Standard. This paper presents the results of the composition development and mechanical properties (flexural, compressive and adhesive strengths) testing and validation of three different gypsum mortars, in order to select the appropriate one for thermal testing in test cells. The results show that the effective decrease in the studied characteristics of the mortar does not inhibit the use for plastering, as requirements are achieved by the three studied compositions.

40|$|Paper is coated {{to improve}} the {{printability}} and the visual properties. The factors that determine the coating structure are important because the structure determines the physical, optical, and printing properties. This work focuses on determining {{a relationship between the}} rheological properties of the coating, the application method, and the <b>final</b> <b>coating</b> structure. Coatings with different polymers and pigments were characterized in terms of steady shear and viscoelastic properties. These coatings were applied onto plastic film and paper with a laboratory rod coater, a spray coater, and a high-speed blade coater. The <b>final</b> <b>coating</b> structure after drying was characterized in terms of void fraction, water absorption rate, gloss, and light scattering coefficient. A relationship between the viscoelasticity of the suspensions and the <b>final</b> <b>coating</b> structure was found for the associative thickeners. However, the concentration and molecular weights of cellulosic thickeners did change the wet state rheology, but the <b>final</b> <b>coating</b> structure was not changed.

Lacquer is applied to seal and protect the object, and then decoration is added.

50|$|In three <b>coat</b> <b>plastering</b> it is {{standard}} {{to apply a}} second layer in the same fashion, leaving about a half inch of rough, sandy plaster (called a brown coat or browning (UK)). A smooth, white finish coat goes on last. After the plaster is completely dry, the walls are ready to be painted. In this article's photo ("lath seen from the back...") the curls of plaster are called keys and are necessary to keep the plaster on the lath. Traditional lime based mortar/plaster often incorporates horsehair which reinforces the plasterwork, thereby helping to prevent the keys from breaking away.|$|R

Cure time is only {{for two or three}} <b>coat</b> <b>plastering</b> that may have lime in the finish. It is recommended to wait a few days or weeks before painting a lime finish wall. Plastering walls with one coat is actually faster than taping since you don't have to wait for three separate coats to dry for 24 hours, as in taping. If heavy patchwork is involved, then yes, there is also await time. However, that is typically for drying time not curing.|$|R
