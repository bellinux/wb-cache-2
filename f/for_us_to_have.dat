25|$|A {{proposition}} {{was made}} by me that since our books were often referr'd to in our disquisitions upon the inquiries, it might be convenient <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> them altogether where we met, that upon occasion they might be consulted; and by thus clubbing our books to a common library, we should, while we lik'd to keep them together, have each of us the advantage of using the books {{of all the other}} members, which would be nearly as beneficial as if each owned the whole.|$|E
500|$|Stargate {{producers}} {{were not}} sure actor Richard Dean Anderson would return for the episode, so they devised many scenes where Anderson was [...] "in" [...] the episode but not actually shown. [...] However, Anderson was willing to return and appeared in several scenes. In the DVD special Stargate SG-1: Behind the 200th Cooper said, [...] "it {{was a big deal}} <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> [...] back for the 200th episode. We obviously didn't think we could do it without him." ...|$|E

500|$|The team hosted {{an event}} to honor wounded {{veterans}} of Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom at Heinz Field. Players signed autographs and held on-field drills with the veterans, while soldiers and Marines spoke of their experiences. Chris Hoke, {{who attended the}} event said, [...] "These {{are the people who}} fight <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> our freedom and be who we are as Americans. To come out here and spend a couple hours with them and hear their stories is unbelievable. There's nothing better than this." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite {{their history}} in the competition, Liverpool manager Roy Evans, felt this would not count for {{anything}} in the final: [...] "Our players haven't really got that much Wembley experience, certainly {{not in terms of}} finals. It will be good <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> Ian Rush and John Barnes out there." [...] Striker Rush had picked up a hamstring injury while playing for the Welsh national team against Bulgaria, but was expected to be fit. Midfielder Mark Kennedy would not feature in the final as he was ineligible.|$|E
500|$|As some Arsenal {{players were}} seen consoling each other, manager Arsène Wenger {{was left to}} rue the defeat and said that his Arsenal side could not take their chances: [...] "It was not a huge {{advantage}} <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> Hagi sent off, sometimes you defend better with 10 men because everybody is focused." [...] He was displeased with the penalty shoot-out and criticised Spanish referee Antonio López Nieto for deciding the penalty shoot-out {{to take place in}} front of Galatasaray fans. Wenger was also unhappy with the decision made by UEFA officials regarding a coin toss during extra time, which would affect where the spot kicks would be taken.|$|E

60|$|I {{asked the}} captain {{if he was}} willing to venture with these hands on board the ship: for, as for me, and my man Friday, I did not think it was proper <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> stir, <b>having</b> seven men left behind; and it was {{employment}} enough <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> keep them asunder, and supply them with victuals.|$|R
500|$|According to a chronicled account, {{during the}} meeting, Ibrahim Pasha {{attempted}} {{to address the}} reluctance of the notables in sending their kinsmen and peasants to the army, asking that as Muslims at war with Christian nations, [...] "is it not necessary <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a big standing army?" [...] The notables replied in the affirmative, but asserted that their men were already trained {{in the art of}} war and like the generations before them, they would [...] "willingly shed blood" [...] for the [...] "fatherland" [...] and [...] "defend their country" [...] from [...] "the enemies of our religion". Ibrahim Pasha countered that their fighters would need to be professionally trained, telling them [...] "War is not the place for a herd of useless men".|$|E

[...] The broadcast was produced by Marty Callner and directed by Hamish Hamilton. The broadcast was Madonna's first since 1993, when [...] from Sydney, Australia became HBO's most-watched original program of the year.|$|E

Rahman was unsure how to answer, but after exchanging several more emails, they met in Mumbai. Rahman summarized their first meeting by saying [...] "when I talked to him, I had some interest and I wanted to see the film. He had a first cut of the film already, and when I saw that I was really interested and wanted to do it. So I left another film to do this one. I made time for it".|$|E

500|$|Hunter and Morse {{are written}} off the {{series in the}} episode [...] "Parting Shot", both leaving S.H.I.E.L.D., as Palicki and Blood [...] "physically had to go leave to shoot the pilot ... they had to stop being on S.H.I.E.L.D. {{and get ready for}} the pilot and then shoot the pilot and all of that, so it didn't make sense <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> all these episodes with them and then not have them in two or three episodes, and then go, [...] "Oh, we were just over here," [...] and then come back and go away again." [...] On whether they could return to the series at some point, Bell said, [...] "I can't answer that, but I can say it would be kind of {{cheating}} to make Mack cry like that only to buy it back—not that we haven't brought characters back from the dead. We want to earn stuff." ...|$|E

[...] However, on 18 January 1912 they discovered Amundsen's tent, some supplies, a letter to King HaakonVII of Norway (which Amundsen politely asked Scott to deliver) and a note stating that Amundsen had arrived there with four companions on [...] 1911.|$|E
500|$|On April 9, 1987, {{a two-hour}} meeting with {{three members of}} the FHLBB San Francisco branch was held, again in DeConcini's office, to discuss the government's {{investigation}} of Lincoln. Present were Cranston, DeConcini, Glenn, McCain, and additionally Riegle. The regulators felt that the meeting was very unusual and that they were being pressured by a united front, as the senators presented their reasons for having the meeting. DeConcini began the meeting by saying, [...] "We wanted to meet with you because we have determined that potential actions of yours could injure a constituent." [...] McCain said, [...] "One of our jobs as elected officials is to help constituents in a proper fashion. ACC [...] is a big employer and important to the local economy. I wouldn't want any special favors for them.... I don't want any part of our conversation to be improper." [...] Glenn said, [...] "To be blunt, you should charge them or get off their backs," [...] while DeConcini said, [...] "What's wrong with this if they're willing to clean up their act? ... It's very unusual <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a company that could be put out of business by its regulators." [...] The regulators then revealed that Lincoln was under criminal investigation on a variety of serious charges, at which point McCain severed all relations with Keating.|$|E

Even amid the smoke of the battle I could see that the British leader was moving painfully, yet I must confess bravely, in order to remain at the head of his men.|$|R

2500|$|Some dancers {{themselves}} {{make this}} historical connection.

[...] "I feel the same kind of spirit and emotions." [...] Another woman, whose troupe used the [...] "red songs" [...] written during that era, was more political. [...] "The can always remind us what the Chinese leaders did <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a good life today and how they fought hard for the ordinary people in China." ...|$|E
2500|$|While {{the school}} board {{condemned}} some nearby properties, Hooker agreed to sell its property to {{the school board}} for $1.

[...] However, the board rejected the company's proposal that the deed require the land to be used for park purposes only, with the school itself to be built nearby.|$|E

25|$|The current {{regulation}} does not prohibit travel by <b>U.S.</b> citizens <b>to</b> Cuba per se, {{but it makes}} it illegal <b>for</b> <b>U.S.</b> citizens <b>to</b> <b>have</b> transactions (spend money or receive gifts) in Cuba under most circumstances without a US government Office of Foreign Assets Control issued license. Since even paying unavoidable airfare ticket taxes into a Cuban airport would violate this transaction law, it is effectively impossible for ordinary tourists to visit Cuba without breaking the monetary transaction rule.|$|R
2500|$|In September 2007, Sharpton {{was asked}} whether he {{considered}} it important <b>for</b> the <b>US</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a black president.

But I'm warming up to Obama, but I'm not there yet." ...|$|R
