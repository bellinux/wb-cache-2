25|$|On 23 December 1903, the French {{government}} authorized {{construction of}} the Canal du Nord, a 93 kilometre long canal from Arleux to Pont-l'Évêque. The Canal du Nord would accommodate barges up to 300 tonnes and because it both increased waterway capacity and decreased transport distance, it was expected to decrease <b>freight</b> <b>costs</b> by up to 30%.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, {{the lowest}} cost of Gen2 EPC inlay was {{offered by the}} now-defunct company SmartCode, at a price of $0.05 apiece in volumes of 100 million or more. Nevertheless, further {{conversion}} (including additional label stock or encapsulation processing/insertion and <b>freight</b> <b>costs</b> to a given facility or DC) and of the inlays into usable RFID labels and the design of current Gen 2 protocol standard will increase the total end-cost, especially with the added security feature extensions for RFID Supply Chain item-level tagging.|$|E
25|$|In 1875, the Canal Company {{announced}} {{its intention to}} double the lengths of the locks to allow double boats {{to pass through the}} canal, i.e. two boats, one behind the other, which could be towed, reducing <b>freight</b> <b>costs</b> by 50%. The Maryland Coal Company experimented with such boats, but the floods in the late 1870s destroyed these dreams. The first lock to be extended to allow double boats was Edwards Ferry (Lock 25). Locks 25–32 were extended as such, as well as others, for a total of 14 extended locks on the canal.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} vendor-buyer channels subject to trade credit and quantity discounts for <b>freight</b> <b>cost.</b> We {{deal with the}} problems of determining the vendor's credit period, the buyer's retail price and order quantity while still maximizing profits. We focus on how channel coordination can be achieved using trade credit and how trade credit can be affected by quantity discounts for <b>freight</b> <b>cost.</b> We show that profits for both parties increase under channel coordination when the credit period is kept within an appropriate range. This range becomes wider as the discount for freight rates increases. Channel coordination Quantity discounts <b>Freight</b> <b>cost</b> Trade credit...|$|R

Or a pricing method in which customers are charged <b>freight</b> <b>cost</b> from a base point; the base point may be chosen arbitrarily, but the location of one of the company's manufacturing plant is commonly used.|$|R
40|$|Demand {{conditions}} being equal, {{the market}} with the lowest <b>freight</b> <b>cost</b> {{is in a position}} to make the highest bid to the local shipper in a given surplus area. Changing crop conditions, however, may create demand for feed grains in territories normally not in the market. When such demands arise the market serving the deficit areas must bid equal to, or above, {{the market with}} the favorable <b>freight</b> <b>cost</b> in order to draw grain from an equal or slightly higher <b>freight</b> <b>cost</b> area. When production in the western feeding area, served by Kansas City, falls to or below 82 percent of normal, Kansas City is forced to bid from 1 to 5 cents above Chicago to draw corn from north central Iowa where freight rates are equal to both markets. In years when production in the western area reaches this low level the price differential usually exists for a period of 12 to 14 months, from mid-summer of the small crop year to mid-summer of the following crop year...|$|R
25|$|Various tactics {{adopted to}} work around {{inflation}} include decreasing the quantity of an item within a set (such as removing a pencil within a larger pack) to reduce the production costs and replacing third-party brands with their own-brand alternatives. Examples of branded products being replaced include After Eights and Toblerone, both being confectionery products. Poundland planned to launch a Toblerone replacement in July 2017, by offering a closely resembling own-brand product named Twin Peaks, though following a legal battle from Toblerone's manufacturer, the product had to be redesigned to be distinctly different. The retailer dismisses concerns about a weaker pound, as this reduces <b>freight</b> <b>costs</b> which counteracts the impact.|$|E
25|$|With {{the conquest}} of Italy, {{prepared}} viae were extended from Rome and its vicinity to outlying municipalities, sometimes overlying earlier roads. Building viae was a military responsibility and thus came {{under the jurisdiction of}} a consul. The process had a military name, viam munire, as though the via were a fortification. Municipalities, however, were responsible for their own roads, which the Romans called viae vicinales. The beauty and grandeur of the roads might tempt us to believe that any Roman citizen could use them for free, but this was not the case. Tolls abounded, especially at bridges. Often they were collected at the city gate. <b>Freight</b> <b>costs</b> were made heavier still by import and export taxes. These were only the charges for using the roads. Costs of services on the journey went up from there.|$|E
500|$|Natural ice became {{essential}} to the transportation of perishable foods over the railroads; slaughtering and dressing meat, then transporting it, was much more efficient in terms of <b>freight</b> <b>costs</b> and opened up the industries of the Mid-West, while, as the industrialist Jonathan Armour argued, ice and refrigerator cars [...] "changed the growing of fruits and berries from a gamble...to a national industry".|$|E

50|$|Some {{companies}} {{have adopted a}} process called self billing to pay freight bills. The customers calculate their <b>freight</b> <b>cost</b> themselves and instruct the freight forwarder to invoice using credit notes.

500|$|When the TAPS group {{initially}} {{proposed the}} pipeline in 1969, the proposed cost was $900 million, and the pipeline would {{be completed by}} 1972. By January 1970, the projected cost had risen from $900 million to $2 billion. In October 1973, Alyeska further refined its figures and anticipated a cost of between $3.1 billion and $3.5 billion, {{with the potential for}} a billion more. One year later, Alyeska released its most detailed cost estimate to that point: $5.982 billion. By June 1975, that figure had again risen to $6.4 billion. At the time, it was estimated that $3 billion of the cost rise to that point was due to inflation, while another $2 billion was due to environmental costs. In July 1976, amid the second year of construction, the project's cost was raised to $7.7 billion. The increase, Alyeska reported, was due to material and <b>freight</b> <b>costs,</b> repairs needed to poorly built sections of pipeline, and contingency estimates.|$|E

2500|$|In 1875, {{the company}} decided to {{experiment}} with double boats (one boat tied to another, pulled {{by a team of}} mules) allowing them to decrease <b>freight</b> <b>costs</b> by 50%. The company extended 14 locks to do so. Locks 25 through 32 were extended for that reason. 11 locks were extended at the lower end (like Lock 25) and 3 were extended at the upper end, for a total of 14 extended locks on the canal. While since that time the stones from the downstream extensions have often been removed, the early mule rise (i.e. the towpath rise before the lock appears 120 feet earlier than normal) indicates the locks extended at the lower end. Lander Lock (No. 29) {{is a good example of}} this. While physical evidence shows that locks 25, 27, 29–33, 37, 38, 43, & 60 also were lengthened, Canal records only mention locks 5-7 being lengthened ...|$|E

40|$|Soybean meal has {{provided}} {{the major source of}} protein in Oregon poultry feeds for the past 30 years. More than 60, 000 tons are used for this purpose each year in Oregon. Soybean meal obtained from the Midwest includes a <b>freight</b> <b>cost</b> of more than $ 40 per ton, an annual cost to poultrymen of about $ 2. 5 million. This additional <b>freight</b> <b>cost</b> has generated much interest in the use of locally grown soybeans in an effort to reduce the cost of poultry feeds. It has long been known that raw soybeans contain factors that affect the availability of nutrients to poultry or other monogastric animals. These factors may cause decreased fat and protein digestibility; decreased availability of the sulfur amino acids, methionine and cystine; reduced availability of some minerals; and interference with pancreatic enzymatic utilization. Several workers have reported that feeding raw soybeans to growing birds causes a growth depression. With replacement pullets, this cause...|$|R

(Monkman Pass Highway) littered the region and by 1937 the volunteers had passed the Alberta-British Columbia border and reached Kinuseo Falls, building a fishing resort there. However, the war brought an end to Monkman's career - the highway project ended in 1939 and he died on September 26, 1941 back at Grande Prairie. His legacy now lives on in British Columbia's Monkman Provincial Park and Monkman Falls.|$|E

50|$|Transportation is {{implicit}} {{in the notion of}} inter-industry flows. It is explicitly recognized when transportation is identified as an industry - how much is purchased from transportation in order to produce. But this is not very satisfactory because transportation requirements differ, depending on industry locations and capacity constraints on regional production. Also, the receiver of goods generally pays <b>freight</b> <b>cost,</b> and often transportation data are lost because transportation costs are treated as part {{of the cost of the}} goods.|$|R
