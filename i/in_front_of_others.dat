5|$|Kennedy decided {{toward the}} end of 1871 to end his {{business}} partnership with Eddy. She had accused him <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>others</b> of cheating at cards; it was one of several scenes she had caused between them and he walked out on her. There was a temporary reconciliation, but he was unhappy about the abandonment of head rubbing, and after a dispute between Eddy and a student over a refund was played out in the local press, he decided to go his own way.|$|E

In the episode, Michael Scott (Steve Carell) trains his office replacement, Deangelo Vickers (Ferrell) on how to properly host the branch's annual Dundie Awards. Michael soon learns that Deangelo has a terrible problem with speaking <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>others.</b> Meanwhile, Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) deals with her dislike of her boyfriend, Gabe Lewis (Zach Woods).|$|E

25|$|According to {{psychologist}} B. F. Skinner, phobias {{are controlled}} by escape and avoidance behaviors. For instance, a student may leave the room when talking {{in front of the}} class (escape) and refrain from doing verbal presentations because of the previously encountered anxiety attack (avoid). Major avoidance behaviors could include an almost pathological/compulsive lying behavior in order to preserve self-image and avoid judgement <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>others.</b> Minor avoidance behaviors are exposed when a person avoids eye contact and crosses his/her arms to avoid recognizable shaking. A fight-or-flight response is then triggered in such events.|$|E
25|$|In Hispanic {{cultures}} shyness and inhibition {{with authority}} figures is common. For instance, Hispanic students may feel shy towards being praised by teachers <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>others,</b> because in these cultures students are rewarded in private with a touch, a smile, or spoken word of praise. Hispanic students may seem shy {{when they are}} not. It is considered rude to excel over peers and siblings; therefore {{it is common for}} Hispanic students to be reserved in classroom settings. Adults also show reluctance to share personal matters about themselves to authority figures such as nurses and doctors.|$|E
25|$|Frigg, a major goddess and Odin's wife, {{says that}} what Loki and Odin {{did in the}} ancient past should not be spoken of <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>others,</b> and that ancient matters should always remain hidden. Loki brings up that Frigg is the {{daughter}} of Fjörgyn, a personification of the earth, and that she had once taken Odin's brothers Vili and Vé into her embrace. Frigg responds that if there was a boy like her now-deceased son Baldr in the hall, Loki {{would not be able to}} escape from the wrath of the gods. Loki reminds Frigg that he is responsible for the death of her son Baldr.|$|E

25|$|Picasso's Landscape with Two Figures {{is almost}} entirely Cézannian, in its color, in its {{reduction}} to simplified forms and in its loose brushwork. Picasso still shows a sense of depth perspective through shading, despite some flattening of the surface. Metzinger's painting is less influenced by Cézanne in its brushstrokes, hardly visible in this photograph. Its quasi-Nabis post-Symbolist treatment can be observed, but Metzinger vacates all depth of field. The background and foreground have become one. The only devices that indicate depth are (1) elevation in the picture plane; lower is closer and further is higher, and (2) objects <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>others</b> obscure the object in the background, such as the central nude appears {{in front of the}} nude she holds with her right hand.|$|E
25|$|It {{is clear}} to Lizaveta Prokofyevna and General Yepanchin that their {{daughter}} {{is in love with}} the Prince, but Aglaya denies this and angrily dismisses talk of marriage. She continues to mock and reproach him, often <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>others,</b> and lets slip that, as far as she is concerned, the problem of Nastassya Filippovna is yet to be resolved. Myshkin himself merely experiences an uncomplicated joy in her presence and is mortified when she appears to be angry with him. Lizaveta Prokofyevna feels it is time to introduce the Prince to their aristocratic circle and a dinner party is arranged for this purpose, to be attended by a number of eminent and influential persons. Aglaya, who does not share her parents' respect for these people and is afraid that Myshkin's eccentricity will not meet with their approval, tries to tell him how to behave, but ends by sarcastically telling him to be as eccentric as he likes, and to be sure to wave his arms about when he is pontificating on some high-minded subject and break her mother's priceless Chinese vase. Feeling her anxiety, Myshkin too becomes extremely anxious, but he tells her that it is nothing compared to the joy he feels in her company. He tries to approach the subject of Nastasya Filippovna again, but she silences him and hurriedly leaves.|$|E

When tasks are completed, players will earn a number of stamps for their current merit stamp card, which can be exchanged for upgrades. Players take part in battles using the Wizard Companion book, which contains various spells that are activated using drawings with the stylus.

[...] His experience with Matinee's team of writers and animators was positive; they were more proactive than Lacewood's, brainstorming his ideas and turning them into viable scripts and storyboards. [...] Director Frank Saperstein performed the final edit, polishing up the scripts. [...] Lat, however, had the final say with regards to cultural depictions, overriding several suggestions such as characters kissing <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>others</b> and the use of Western street slang, as these were unpalatable to the Malaysian public. [...] He also enforced accuracy in the depictions of objects such as bullock carts, noting that the American artists thought Malaysian carts were identical to their Mexican counterparts.|$|E
500|$|Shuichi is {{interested}} in doing indoor activities, and does not partake in activities favored by boys of the same age, such as playing sports. Shuichi enjoys and is skillful in baking sweet foods, though is never shown cooking other, more conventional foods. After starting an exchange diary with Yoshino, Shuichi becomes interested in writing stories, and even joins the drama club as a writer with Saori {{in junior high school}} after they co-write a rendition of Romeo and Juliet performed by members of their class. Shuichi has an honest personality, and easily gets along [...] with others. As a child, Shuichi has an obedient, dutiful attitude. However, upon entering puberty, Shuichi sometimes experiences outbursts of intense emotion. Shuichi can be overly sensitive at times and is often shown crying <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>others.</b> Due to these personality quirks, it is easier for Shuichi to associate with girls of the same age. Accordingly, Shuichi has few male friends.|$|E

She is often shy and quiet <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>others,</b> and takes an interest in activities such as drawing and cooking. Yumina transfers into Flawless early in the story, and often voluntarily takes care of the household chores for Yuri's family. , the last of Tayutama heroines, is an honor student from Flawless. She is calm and intelligent, and tends to act as an elder sister figure to other Flawless students.Translated quote: [...] "... Once you wear that uniform as a Flawless student, you are the same as a blood-related sister to me." [...] She is skilled in various martial arts, and is in particular proficient in kenjutsu.|$|E

Such speech pattern is especially more pronounced in areas where arranged marriage are prominent and within households where the husband is considerably older than the wife. Husbands generally address their wives by their first name, pet name, or “younger sibling” (dhik or mbak lik) while wives generally address their husbands as “elder brother” (mas), this is often due to actual age differences, and it serves the females' vanity to not be called [...] "older sister" [...] (mbak).|$|E
2500|$|In {{his younger}} years, Jesperson was given less {{attention}} than his siblings and treated differently {{by the rest}} of his family. After moving to Selah, Washington, Jesperson had trouble fitting in and making friends because of his large size. His brothers didn't help him, instead they nicknamed him [...] "Igor" [...] or [...] "Ig", a name that stuck throughout his school years. Because of this, he was a shy child, content to play by himself much of the time. He would often get into trouble for behaving badly, sometimes violently, and would be severely punished by his father. This included beatings (sometimes with a belt <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>others)</b> and, in one case, he received an electric shock from his father.|$|E
2500|$|Unprogrammed worship (also {{known as}} waiting worship, [...] "silent worship", or holy communion {{in the manner}} of Friends) is based on the {{practices}} of George Fox and the Early Friends, who based their religious beliefs and practices on their interpretation of how the early Christians worshipped God their Heavenly Father. Friends gather together in [...] "expectant waiting upon God" [...] to experience his still small voice leading them from within. There is no plan on how the meeting will proceed, and actual practice varies widely between Meetings and individual worship services. Friends believe that God plans what will happen, with his spirit leading people to speak. When a participant feels led to speak, he or she will stand and share a spoken message of ("vocal ministry") <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>others.</b> When this happens, Quakers believe that the spirit of God is speaking through the speaker. After someone has spoken, it is customary to allow a few minutes pass in silence for reflection on what has been said, before further vocal ministry is given. Sometimes a meeting is entirely silent, sometimes many speak. These meetings lasted for several hours in George Fox's day. Modern meetings are often limited to an hour, ending when two people (usually the elders) exchange the sign of peace by handshake. This handshake is often shared by the others. This style of worship is the norm in Great Britain, Ireland, the continent of Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Southern Africa, Canada, and parts of the United States (particularly yearly meetings associated with Friends General Conference and Beanite Quakerism)—constituting about 11% of Quakers. Those who worship in this style hold each person to be equal before God and capable of knowing the light of God directly. Anyone present may speak if they feel led to do so. Traditionally, Recorded Ministers were recognised for their particular gift in vocal ministry. This religious practice continues among Conservative Friends and Liberal Friends (e.g. New York Yearly Meeting). Many meetings where Liberal Friends predominate abolished this religious practice. London Yearly Meeting of Friends abolished the acknowledging and recording of Recorded Ministers in 1924.|$|E
