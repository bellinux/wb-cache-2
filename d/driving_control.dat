25|$|Whilst {{retaining}} {{the dimensions of}} the Titan TD7 and Tiger TS11, the 1945 Titan PD1 and Tiger PS1 were entirely new designs featuring a new E181 7.4-litre engine with pushrod valve operation and a brand new four-speed constant mesh gearbox. The export versions with an O prefix for overseas markets, the OPS1, not only had longer wheelbases (where legally applicable) but were equipped with the pre-war design overhead-camshaft E87 engine, which had the same nominal 100bhp output but was larger at 8.6 litres. No UK operator took the OPS1 but Potteries Motor Traction took a batch of long-wheelbase OPD1 Titans as single-deckers, later rebodying them as double decks once overall length rules had been relaxed to allow this. When fitted with left-hand drive, the Tiger became the LOPS1, this prefix attaching to all left-hand drive Leyland buses (and Leyland-designed British United Traction trolleybuses) until the mid-1960s when later designs adopted a suffix letter for <b>driving</b> <b>control</b> position.|$|E

The March Driving Helper is fitted with hand-operated driving controls that are primarily intended to enable persons with leg disabilities to drive and include a control lever for operating the accelerator and the brakes with the left hand. These hand-operated controls are incorporated in the Autech <b>Driving</b> <b>Control</b> package, developed originally by Autech Japan for Nissan vehicles and featuring an outstanding design, operating ease and reliability.|$|E
50|$|The Olympic {{was planned}} {{to cover all}} home and export market {{requirements}} for underfloor-engined single deckers over seven variants, with superstructure production shared between two UK plants and one overseas. Nomenclature was based on market, position of <b>driving</b> <b>controls</b> and wheelbase/overall length, the latter dimensions denoted {{by the number of}} seats to standard seating plan.|$|R
50|$|C-class trams towed {{steam and}} cable trailers, and many ran coupled together. There were also {{examples}} of C and D classes being coupled. Some of these C/C and C/D combinations became permanent, with inner end <b>driving</b> <b>controls</b> being removed. They mainly operated from Ridge Street Tram Depot {{and to a}} lesser extent from Rushcutters Bay, Ultimo and Waverley.|$|R
50|$|The cab {{includes}} heating, air conditioning, and acoustic insulation; the <b>driving</b> <b>controls</b> are 'dial-less' - {{information is}} displayed using electronic panel displays. The cab design includes consideration for GSM-R and ERTMS.

50|$|The {{new design}} {{was the first}} {{high-speed}} train design in modern times that had inter-vehicle articulation and distributed traction. The design used Alstom Onix IGBT based traction inverters; the weight reduction associated with IGBT technology allowed an axle load of within 17 tonnes per axle. The trainsets were to {{be made up of}} modules of 3-car sets with two powered bogies per module. Each motor bogie had two body-mounted self-ventilated motors, one per axle, rated at 600 kW. The traction electronics used two taps per transformer per module, each powering two parallel connected inverters, with a separate inverter for each motor. There were two carriage designs: the <b>driving</b> <b>control</b> cars, and intermediate cars; and two designs of bogie: powered and unpowered.|$|E
50|$|Paris's east-west axis across {{has long}} been heavily travelled: Line 1 of the Métro began {{approaching}} saturation in the 1940s, necessitating the construction of Line A of the RER in the 1960s and '70s; which became the busiest urban routes in Europe (by 2010 {{there were more than}} a million passengers each working day). To improve service, the SACEM (Système d'aide à la conduite, à l'exploitation et à la maintenance --"Assisted <b>driving,</b> <b>control</b> and maintenance system") was installed on the central run of Line A in September 1989. This improved efficiency and reduced the interval between trains to just two minutes, though an improvement ultimately insufficient to absorb the increasing demand. To cater permanently to demand on the busy artery between Gare Auber and Gare de Lyon new rail lines would have to be built.|$|E

50|$|TE10 {{locomotives}} have A-B-A or A-B-B-A unit configurations, {{which called}} 3TE10M, and 4TE10S respectively. B-unit of 3TE10 have reduced set of <b>driving</b> <b>controls,</b> intended for service {{movement of the}} locomotive. The last 3-unit TE10 rebuild called 3TE10MK, equipped with computer-aided cab controls. Most of these locomotives work on BAM rail line, located on Russian Far East.|$|R
5000|$|The PlayStation 3 version, Alone in the Dark: Inferno, has {{received}} far more favorable reviews {{due to the}} improved movement and <b>driving</b> <b>controls</b> {{as well as the}} extra scenes.

50|$|The Coventry was an {{advanced}} design and featured a similar layout {{to the more}} compact Daimler, but with a more conventional suspension and drive system. It included duplicate <b>driving</b> <b>controls</b> to allow rapid disengagement in combat. There were two production versions. The Mark 1 employed a three-man turret with a 2-pounder gun and a 7.92 mm coaxial Besa machine gun.|$|R
5000|$|As {{mentioned}} above, the Lincoln LS {{shared a}} platform and equipment with the Jaguar S-Type. The DEW98 platform {{on which the}} cars were based was a rigid chassis that featured independent double wishbone (short-long arm; SLA) front and rear suspensions for excellent handling and ride quality. Enhancing ride quality further, as well as increasing interior space, was the LS' large 114.5 in wheelbase. Four-wheel antilock disc brakes were standard while Ford's AdvanceTrac traction control system was available as an option for improved <b>driving</b> <b>control.</b> A number of suspension components, {{as well as the}} hood, decklid, and front fenders, used aluminum to save weight. The LS came with standard 16-inch alloy wheels while 17-inch wheels were available through an optional sport package. The sport package for only an extra $1000.00, gave a stiffer suspension, 17-inch rims and a [...] "slap shift" [...] selecter. The battery of the LS was positioned in the spare tire well inside the car's trunk because too little room for it was left in the engine bay. However, moving the heavy battery and its interconnecting cables {{to the rear of the}} vehicle contributed to its near-50/50 weight distribution.|$|E
5000|$|By {{the early}} 1960s {{transistors}} {{had replaced the}} tube and electric motors <b>driving</b> <b>control</b> surfaces were more common. The first low cost [...] "proportional" [...] systems did not use servos, but rather employed a bidirectional motor with a proportional pulse train that consisted of two tones, pulse width modulated (TTPW). This system, and another commonly known as [...] "Kicking Duck/Galloping Ghost", was driven with a pulse train that caused the rudder and elevator to [...] "wag" [...] though a small angle (not affecting flight owing to small excursions and high speed), with the average position determined by the proportions of the pulse train. A more sophisticated and unique proportional system was developed by Hershel Toomin of Electrosolids corporation called the Space Control. This benchmark system used two tones, pulse width and rate modulated to drive 4 fully proportional servos, and was manufactured and refined by Zel Ritchie, who ultimately gave the technology to the Dunhams of Orbit in 1964. The system was widely imitated, and others (Sampey, ACL, DeeBee) tried their hand at developing what was then known as analog proportional. But these early analog proportional radios were very expensive, putting {{them out of the}} reach for most modelers. Eventually, single-channel gave way to multi channel devices (at significantly higher cost) with various audio tones driving electromagnets affecting tuned resonant reeds for channel selection.|$|E
50|$|The main {{generator}} was a 12-pole machine with the rating changed to , 780/545V, 1050/1500A at 750 rpm. (The continuous rating {{has also been}} quoted as , 630V, 1300A). The four traction motors were now connected as series parallel pairs being rated at , 315V, 650A at 460 rpm, with a gear ratio 18:67. Pairs of motors connected in series provided a higher maximum tractive effort (usually quoted as 45000 lbf kN although 47000 lbf kN could be achieved) but the downside being that a series pair connected machine was more prone to slipping than one with an all parallel grouping. Full power was available between 7 and 77.5 mi/h km/h, an improvement over Class 25/0 locomotives with all other ratings unchanged from the earlier series. The traction motor’s continuous rating of 650 amps was not far removed from its one-hour short term or 'emergency' rating of 680 amps, and this could only be monitored manually. On heavy trains close monitoring of the ammeters was necessary to avoid motor damage. Though the body shell remained similar to D5151 {{there were a number}} of refinements. The air horns were relocated to either side of the headcode panel. The cab skirt and body fairing were discontinued, though the support lugs remained. A new <b>driving</b> <b>control</b> panel was fitted. The fuel and water tanks were also redesigned with a fuel capacity of 510 imp gal (also quoted in sources as being 500 or 560 imp gal).|$|E
5000|$|With this system, a {{grapple loader}} {{is mounted on}} the rear of a short frame chassis with an operator's cab mounted between loader and chassis cab. The loader is {{operated}} from this cab, and all <b>driving</b> <b>controls</b> are also routed to the operator's cab enabling the [...] "rear steer" [...] unit to drive backwards along the route and load into separate haul trucks.|$|R
50|$|By 1904 {{motor bus}} {{services}} in country districts {{began to be}} a real cause of competition for the railway. The GWR was seeking methods of catering economically for light passenger traffic, using steam railcars. These consisted of a passenger coach into which was built a four-wheeled steam locomotive, duplicate <b>driving</b> <b>controls</b> being provided at the opposite end from the locomotive. The very limited power of the small traction unit was always an issue, and on the steeply graded Forest of Dean Railway section it proved impracticable. Instead higher capacity units known as auto-trains, consisting of a tank locomotive coupled to one or two coaches were used. The coach remote from the locomotive had <b>driving</b> <b>controls</b> and a mechanical linkage enabled the driver to operate the locomotive regulator. Some configurations marshalled an intermediate trailer between the driving trailer and the locomotive, and in the extreme this could be done both ends of the locomotive, giving four passenger coaches.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper proposes {{an active}} braking control {{dynamical}} system {{in order to}} establish a safe and efficient vehicle <b>driving</b> stability <b>control</b> test system. Aiming at Chery A 3 sedan, set up the active braking control dynamic simulation system base on MATLAB/Simulink. Adopting the brake <b>driving</b> integration ESP <b>control</b> strategy, analyze and verify the stability control performance of independent vehicle system and vehicle ESP test system based on active braking control respectively in under steering and excessive steering two test conditions. The analyzing results indicate that the test system based on active braking control can effectively assist vehicle travelling in the absence of ESP control or ESP control system failure; when vehicle has ESP <b>control</b> system, the <b>driving</b> stability <b>control</b> performance of this system and independent vehicle system has remarkable consistency. The active braking control system provides a basis for research of vehicle <b>driving</b> stability <b>control</b> test. 1...|$|R
