50|$|Each exam (Proba) {{is marked}} from 1 to 10 with 10 being the best, using two {{decimals}} for written exams (e.g. 9.44 or 9.14 {{is a valid}} mark) and an integer for an oral exam. Each exam is corrected and <b>graded</b> <b>by</b> <b>two</b> separate correctors (no computers are involved, as {{this is not a}} standardized test) agreeing on the mark based on a nationwide guideline. The total mark for the Bacalaureat is the arithmetic mean average of the six or eight marks obtained (0.01 precision). To pass, a student must obtain an average score of at least 6.00 and at least 5.00 at each of the individual exams. A student scoring a perfect 10 will be warded with special honors (Absolvent cu Merite Deosebite). In July 2005, 78 candidates out of a total 179878 scored a perfect 10 (0.04%) while 149435 (83.07%) students passed the Bacalaureat. In case of failure (respins), the student is allowed to retake only the exams he failed, until he manages to graduate but no more than 5 times. A September session is held especially for those failing in the June/July session or for those unable to attend the exam in the summer. In case a student is not content with the mark received, one may contest it in 24 hours after finding his or her score. If passed, unlike the case with most high school completion exams, he or she may not retake it (although this matters less in Romania than in the United States or Germany).|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{determine}} whether abdominal 3. 0 T MRI {{can be used}} for evaluation of Crohn's disease (CD) compared with ileocolonoscopy (CS), and to determine patient preference for MRI as opposed to CS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty patients scheduled for CS underwent MRI. At CS, disease severity was graded and the Crohn's Disease Endoscopic Index of Severity (CDEIS) was determined. Radiological <b>grading</b> (<b>by</b> <b>two</b> observers) was compared with endoscopic grading and CDEIS. Patient experience and preference were determined. RESULTS: In respectively 10 (observer 1) and 13 patients (observer 2) exact agreement between radiological and endoscopic grading was found.

Each found a similar distribution of grade through the series, and a virtually identical influence of grade on prognosis. This close agreement occurred despite a 30 % disagreement as to grade in individual cases. It is suggested therefore, that this technique while of relevance to analysis of groups of cases is of very limited reliability in individual patient prognosis. MANY {{attempts have been made}} to establish objective criteria for evaluating cancer activity both clinically and histologically. The latter usually depend on the numerical scoring of histological features, predominantly those of tumour tissue organisation and nuclear morphology, although some workers have also taken into consideration stromal features thought to reflect host defence responses. Broders (1920) described four grades of malignancy in squamous carcinomas, the percentage of nuclei containing mitotic figures being his only criterion. Patey and Scarff (1929 a, 1929 b), using a more complex method of grading breast cancer based on the work of Greenough (1925), demonstrated a clear correlation between a low grade and a good prognosis. More recently, Bloom has described the application of the same technique to a large series of cases (Bloom, 1950 a, a detaile...|$|R

Sections of paraffin-embedded {{specimens}} of liver obtained from Bedlington terriers were stained with rhodanine for copper and examined and <b>graded</b> <b>by</b> <b>two</b> pathologists. Their results correlated well with each other, {{as well as}} with the results of quantitative determinations of hepatic copper content. Copper toxicosis was established by cytochemistry in 20 of 21 specimens, indicating a sensitivity of 95 %. The method is highly specific-none of the 19 specimens obtained from unaffected dogs displayed copper-containing granules suggestive of copper toxicosis. Copper cytochemistry appears to be a satisfactory substitute for chemical analysis of hepatic copper content. Some Bedlington terriers inherit, in an autosomal recessive pattern, a defect in copper metabolism which results in the accumulation of excessive amounts of copper which cause progressive liver di~ease. ~*~**. l o The defect can be recognized by liver biopsy with subse-quent histologic examination and analysis of hepatic copper content in affected pups as young as six months of age.
