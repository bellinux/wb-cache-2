This was due to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and other Democratic leaders cutting the vice president out of any direct talks with Congress, feeling that Biden had given too much away during previous negotiations.|$|E
5|$|In March 2006, a {{visit to}} India led to renewed ties between the two countries, {{reversing}} decades of U.S. policy. The visit focused particularly on areas of nuclear energy and counter-terrorism cooperation, <b>discussions</b> <b>that</b> would lead eventually to the India–United States Civil Nuclear Agreement.|$|E
5|$|After winning {{re-election}} by defeating Republican opponent Mitt Romney, Obama {{was sworn}} in {{for a second term}} in 2013. During his second term, Obama promoted inclusiveness for LGBT Americans, with his administration filing briefs that urged the Supreme Court to strike down same-sex marriage bans as unconstitutional (United States v. Windsor and Obergefell v. Hodges). Obama advocated for gun control in response to the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, and issued wide-ranging executive actions concerning climate change and immigration. In foreign policy, Obama ordered military intervention in Iraq in response to gains made by ISIL after the 2011 withdrawal from Iraq, continued the process of ending U.S. combat operations in Afghanistan, promoted <b>discussions</b> <b>that</b> led to the 2015 Paris Agreement on global climate change, initiated sanctions against Russia following the invasion in Ukraine and again after Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections, brokered a nuclear deal with Iran, and normalized U.S. relations with Cuba. Obama left office in January 2017 with a 60% approval rating. He currently resides in Washington, D.C. His presidential library will be built in Chicago.|$|E

5|$|At the convention, held August 5–8, Agnew {{abandoned}} his favorite son status, placing Nixon's name in nomination. Nixon narrowly secured the nomination {{on the first}} ballot. In the <b>discussions</b> <b>that</b> followed about a running mate, Nixon kept his counsel while various party factions thought they could influence his choice: Strom Thurmond, the senator from South Carolina, told a party meeting that he held a veto on the vice presidency. It was evident that Nixon wanted a centrist, though there was little enthusiasm when he first proposed Agnew, and other possibilities were discussed. Some party insiders thought that Nixon had privately settled on Agnew early on, and that the consideration of other candidates {{was little more than}} a charade. On August 8, after a final meeting of advisers and party leaders, Nixon declared that Agnew was his choice, and shortly afterwards announced his decision to the press. Delegates formally nominated Agnew for the vice presidency later that day, before adjourning.|$|E
5|$|By 2003, Madonna {{suggested}} {{that she was in}} a revolutionary mood, which led to journalistic <b>discussions</b> <b>that</b> another image makeover would take place for her. Still recovering from the commercial disappointment of Swept Away, Madonna changed her image completely to resemble that of a fighter, with inspirations from pictures of Argentinian guerrilla leader Che Guevara. French design team M/M Paris (Michael Amzalag and Mathias Augustyniak) were responsible for the artwork of American Life. The duo are best known for their collaborations with musicians and Madonna hired the duo after discussing the concept for just six minutes. The photo shoot for the album was done by photographer Craig McDean in January 2003 at Los Angeles, and cost a reported $415,000. McDean had already worked with Madonna for the cover of Vanity Fair magazine in October 2002; this shoot had a military theme, with Madonna posing in dark green and black clothes, combat boots, and guns.|$|E
5|$|When Árbenz {{was sworn}} in as defense {{minister}} under President Arévalo, he became the first to hold the portfolio since it had previously been known as the Ministry of War. In the fall of 1947, Árbenz, as defense minister, objected to the deportation of several workers after they had been accused of being communists. Well-known communist José Manuel Fortuny was intrigued by this action and decided to visit him, and found Árbenz to be different from the stereotypical Central American military officer. That first meeting was followed by others until Árbenz invited Fortuny to his house for <b>discussions</b> <b>that</b> usually extended for hours. Like Árbenz, Fortuny was inspired by a fierce nationalism and a burning desire to improve the conditions of the Guatemalan people, and, like Árbenz, he sought answers in Marxist theory. This relationship would strongly influence Árbenz in the future.|$|E

5|$|It was Warelwast {{who told}} Anselm in 1103 {{that the king}} would not permit his return to England. This came after a failed joint mission by Warelwast and Anselm to Paschal {{attempting}} to resolve the dispute between Henry and the archbishop over the king's investiture of bishops, a dispute generally known as the Investiture Controversy. It is quite likely that the king had given instructions that if the mission failed, Warelwast was to inform Anselm that he should only to return to England if he agreed with the king's position in the dispute. In 1106 Warelwast was the king's negotiator in the <b>discussions</b> <b>that</b> led to the settlement of the Investiture Controversy in England. The king ultimately lost little, relinquishing the right to actually give the symbols of episcopal authority to a newly elected bishop in return for continuing to receive homage from the bishops. Early in 1106 Warelwast was sent to Bec Abbey, where Anselm was residing in exile, to inform him of the settlement and deliver to the archbishop the king's invitation to return to England. In May 1107 Warelwast acted as the king's envoy at Paschal's council at Troyes, where Paschal was attempting to secure support for Bohemond of Antioch's proposed campaign against Byzantium. Warelwast probably relayed to the pope the news that King Henry would make no contribution to Bohemond's efforts.|$|E
25|$|The pronophilines {{have been}} {{involved}} in diverse biogeographical <b>discussions</b> <b>that</b> aim to explain their current distribution, diversity and endemism.

But although the talks continued into February 2010, the Clinic eventually rejected the confidential purchase price and terms offered by Benefis.|$|E
25|$|On 27 October 1947 Razakars and Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen {{staged a}} {{demonstration}} at {{the houses of}} the members of delegation, Monckton, the Nawab, and Sir Sultan Ahmed, making it impossible for them to leave for Delhi as intended. The <b>discussions</b> <b>that</b> followed bore no fruit, and on 1 November the Nawab of Chhatari, finding his position intolerable, resigned as President of the Executive Council. Monckton also insisted on resigning.|$|E
25|$|After the War of Independence and truce {{called in}} July 1921, {{representatives of the}} British {{government}} and the Irish treaty delegates, led by Arthur Griffith, Robert Barton and Michael Collins, negotiated the Anglo-Irish Treaty in London from 11 October to 6 December 1921. The Irish delegates set up headquarters at Hans Place in Knightsbridge and it was here in private <b>discussions</b> <b>that</b> the decision was taken on 5 December to recommend the treaty to Dáil Éireann.|$|E

25|$|The Homosexual Front of Revolutionary Action (Frente Homosexual de Acción Revolucionaria) {{protested the}} 1983 roundups in Guadalajara, Jalisco. The onset of AIDS during the mid-1980s created {{considerable}} debate and public discussion about homosexuality. Many voices, both supportive and opposing (such as the Roman Catholic Church), participated in public <b>discussions</b> <b>that</b> increased awareness {{and understanding of}} homosexuality. LGBT groups were instrumental in initiating programs to combat AIDS, which was a shift in focus that curtailed (at least temporarily) the emphasis on gay organizing.|$|E
25|$|DMOZ's editor removal {{procedures}} are overseen by DMOZ's staff and meta editors. According to DMOZ's official editorial guidelines, editors are removed for abusive editing practices or uncivil behaviour. <b>Discussions</b> <b>that</b> {{may result in}} disciplinary action against volunteer editors {{take place in a}} private forum which can only be accessed by DMOZ's staff and meta editors. Volunteer editors who are being discussed are not given notice that such proceedings are taking place. Some people find this arrangement distasteful, wanting instead a discussion modelled more like a trial held in the U.S. judicial system.|$|E
25|$|Harrison Ford, {{who played}} Deckard in the film, {{has said that}} he did not think Deckard was a replicant, and {{has said that he}} and {{director}} Ridley Scott had <b>discussions</b> <b>that</b> ended in the agreement that the character was human. According to several interviews with Scott, Deckard is a replicant. Deckard collects photographs which are seen on his piano, yet has no obvious family beyond a reference to his ex-wife (who called him a “cold fish"). In a scene in which Deckard talks with Rachael, their pupils both appear to shine—a characteristic of replicants.|$|E

25|$|In the Italian culture {{emotional}} expressiveness during interpersonal {{interaction is}} encouraged. From {{a young age}} children engage in debates or <b>discussions</b> <b>that</b> encourage and strengthen social assertiveness. Independence and social competence during childhood is also promoted. Being inhibited is looked down upon and those who show this characteristic are viewed negatively by their parents and peers. Like other cultures where shyness and inhibition is viewed negatively, peers of shy and inhibited Italian children reject the socially fearful, cautious and withdrawn. These withdrawn and socially fearful children express loneliness and believe themselves to be lacking the social skills needed in social interactions.|$|E
25|$|However, {{these efforts}} cause critique, mainly due to postponing. The {{institution}} of the bike tunnel at the main railway station, originally planned for 2016, is currently (2016) delayed to at least 2019. Pro Velo, a nationwide interest group, has publicly questioned whether the masterplan already failed. The critique aims at badly governed traffic management at construction sites, missing possibilities to park bikes in the city as well as rather diffident ambitions. In response, the responsible city department points to the big investments made every year and mentions ongoing <b>discussions</b> <b>that</b> would finally lead to even better results.|$|E
25|$|St. Thomas's {{became the}} parish church {{for a new}} Parish of Mount Merrion in 1956, after {{conclusion}} of <b>discussions</b> <b>that</b> had begun in 1948. Trevor Hipwell, senior curate of Taney, was appointed as its first Rector, occupying a newly built rectory by the church. A few years later, in 1965, the church was extended. In 1994, Mount Merrion Parish {{was placed in a}} Group with the Parish of Booterstown (which had previously absorbed Carysfort Parish), and the two parishes, still with separate Select Vestries, share a rector, at the St. Thomas Rectory. The Joint Parish Office is also at the Mount Merrion site, and services are celebrated at both sites.|$|E
