25|$|Manx2's Belfast-Cork route was {{operated}} on the Air Operator Certificate (AOC) of Flightline S.L., based in Barcelona. As such Flightline {{was responsible for}} controlling all operational matters relating to that service. In practice many day-to-day decisions were taken by Manx2 in its Isle of Man office. One such decision was the pairing of Lopez and Cantle to crew flight 7100 on 10 February. Correct adherence to European aviation regulations (<b>EU-OPS)</b> by the AOC-holder should have prevented this inappropriate pairing of a newly promoted captain with a relatively inexperienced first officer. It had come about because Cantle was drafted in to replace the pilot who was originally rostered as first officer for the flight when he became unavailable. Flightline {{was not aware of}} the change in personnel.|$|E

On 6 May, the Civil Aviation Authority in the United Kingdom issued a Safety Notice advising all operators within the United Kingdom that the second amendment to the <b>EU-OPS</b> 1 operating standard would come into force on 16 July 2011. The amendment, originally published in September 2008, introduced a new method for calculating Aerodrome Operating Minimums and stipulated that Non-Precision Approaches should follow a continuous descent profile, unless otherwise approved by the CAA.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to the legal requirements, Collective Labour Agreements (CLAs) at company level often include FTL provisions, specifically tailored to the conditions of that company. These CLA rules cannot set lower safety levels than <b>EU-OPS,</b> {{and in most cases}} they actually provide for stricter FTL provisions than the national laws or <b>EU-OPS.</b> They therefore provide for higher safety levels than required by law.|$|E
50|$|With this <b>EU-OPS</b> Subpart Q, the EU introduced, for {{the first}} time in history, a harmonized, legally binding minimum set of FTL safety rules aimed at {{preventing}} pilot fatigue across Europe. While individual EU countries can apply stricter FTL rules at national level, they are not allowed to go below the minimum set by <b>EU-OPS,</b> unless they apply for a specific derogation.|$|E

Since obtaining its Air Operator's Certificate, the carrier has gained all the statutory <b>EU-OPS</b> (regulations specifying minimum safety and related procedures for commercial passenger and cargo fixed-wing aviation) and Federal Aviation Administration Safety Agency (EASA) approvals. It also obtained the IATA Operational Safety Audit (IOSA) certification in September 2011.|$|E

Similarly, <b>EU-OPS</b> 1.030/JAR-OPS 3.030 states that an operator shall establish for each aeroplane, an MEL approved by the CAA that will be based upon the relevant MMEL accepted by the CAA. In addition, an operator shall not operate an aeroplane other than in accordance with the MEL unless permitted by the CAA.|$|E
