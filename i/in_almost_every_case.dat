Physical examination revealed that hypertension and obesity were extremely rare and also that anemia and symptoms of the gastrointestinal tract were common. Hookworm infection was prevalent (67. 5 %). Anemia was seen in 31 %. Judging from hemoglobin levels, 36. 4 % of children below 6 years, 35. 1 % of children 6 - 14 years, 14. 2 % of adult males, 36. 5 % of adult nonpregnant females and 36. 4 % of pregnant females had anemia respectively. Hypochromia and microcytosis were frequently seen in the blood smears. Eosinophilia was also marked in all age and sex groups. Serum iron levels and % saturation of transferrin were low in high percentage except in adult males. In regard to serum vitamin B(12) and folic acid, low values were scarecely observed in all groups. Megaloblastic anemia was not detected at all. Total serum protein was relatively low (though within normal limits) in children below 6 years. It {{can be said that}} the anemia is due to iron deficiency <b>in</b> <b>almost</b> <b>every</b> <b>cases</b> <b>in</b> this district and vitamin B(12) and folic acid do not contribute to the anemia.

Out of 1,028incidents of black bears acting aggressively toward people, recorded from 1964 to 1976 in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, 107 resulted in injury, and occurred mainly in tourist hotspots where people regularly fed the bears handouts. <b>In</b> <b>almost</b> <b>every</b> <b>case</b> where open dumps or handouts {{that had previously}} attracted black bears were ceased, the number of aggressive encounters with bears has decreased precipitously over time.

The aim of this work is to find out how the interactive whiteboard is used in tuition and whether its use is expedient in terms of the specific Leeds of pupils with Mild Intellectual Disability. The theoretical part deals with the mental disability itself, its aetiology, specifics and mainly cognitive functions of people with mental disabilities. There is outlined the systém of Czech education dealing with pupils with mild intellectual disabilities too.

In the practical part, the author deals with the work of pupils with mild intellectual disabilities on interactive whiteboard and its use during instruction.

The fundamental finding of reseach, which responds to identified research questions, is that the interactive whiteboards is often used in schools, but selectively and expediently in various ways.

Even after the resumption of antiplatelet therapy, the patient did not show relapse of symptoms and had a favourable course. <b>In</b> <b>almost</b> <b>every</b> reported <b>case</b> treated conservatively, hematoma contraction has been confirmed by CT or upper gastrointestinal endoscopy within 4 to 7 [*]days after onset.
