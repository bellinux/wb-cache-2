5|$|Fishing is {{a popular}} {{activity}} in the BWCAW. Game species include northern pike, muskellunge, walleye, largemouth and smallmouth bass, and panfish. Trout including brook trout, brown trout, lake trout, rainbow trout and splake are also found. Limited stocking of walleye, brown trout and lake trout <b>is</b> <b>done</b> <b>on</b> some lakes.|$|E
5|$|Rowing is {{pursued by}} the Reading Rowing Club and the Reading University Boat Club, both next to Caversham Bridge, whilst Reading Blue Coat School trains at Sonning {{adjacent}} to the Redgrave Pinsent Rowing Lake in Caversham, which provides training facilities for the GB National Squad. However almost all club rowing <b>is</b> <b>done</b> <b>on</b> the River Thames. The annual Reading Town Regatta takes place near Thames Valley Park, with the Reading Amateur Regatta taking place in June, usually {{two weeks before the}} Henley Royal Regatta.|$|E
5|$|The next larger scale, cell biology, {{studies the}} {{structural}} and physiological properties of cells, including their internal behavior, interactions with other cells, {{and with their}} environment. This <b>is</b> <b>done</b> <b>on</b> both the microscopic and molecular levels, for unicellular organisms such as bacteria, {{as well as the}} specialized cells of multicellular organisms such as humans. Understanding the structure and function of cells is fundamental to all of the biological sciences. The similarities and differences between cell types are particularly relevant to molecular biology.|$|E

5|$|To the Muslims, Hajj is {{associated}} with religious {{as well as social}} significance. Nevertheless, {{it should be noted that}} the obligation for performing this pilgrimage is only fulfilled if it <b>is</b> <b>done</b> <b>on</b> the eighth to twelfth day of the last month of the Islamic calendar. If in a given year, an adult Muslim is in good health and his life and wealth is safe, they must perform the Hajj in the same year. Delaying it is considered sinful unless the delay is caused by reasons beyond his/her control.|$|E
5|$|Vertical {{broaching}} machines {{can be designed}} for push broaching, pull-down broaching, pull-up broaching, or surface broaching. Push {{broaching machines}} are similar to an arbor press with a guided ram; typical capacities are 5 to 50 tons. The two ram pull-down machine {{is the most common}} type of broaching machine. This style machine has the rams under the table. Pull-up machines have the ram above the table; they usually have more than one ram. Most surface broaching <b>is</b> <b>done</b> <b>on</b> a vertical machine.|$|E

5|$|Once all {{the tissue}} {{compartments}} have reached saturation {{for a given}} pressure and breathing mixture, continued exposure will not increase the gas loading of the tissues. From this point onwards the required decompression remains the same. If divers work and live at pressure for a long period, and are decompressed {{only at the end}} of the period, the risks associated with decompression are limited to this single exposure. This principle has led to the practice of saturation diving, and as there is only one decompression, and it is done in the relative safety and comfort of a saturation habitat, the decompression <b>is</b> <b>done</b> <b>on</b> a very conservative profile, minimising the risk of bubble formation, growth and the consequent injury to tissues. A consequence of these procedures is that saturation divers are more likely to suffer decompression sickness symptoms in the slowest tissues, whereas bounce divers are more likely to develop bubbles in faster tissues.|$|E

40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted at}} Cereal Crops Research Institute Pirsabak Nowshera during 2002 - 03 on six wheat cultivars/advance lines to identify the best suitable time of planting in the central agro-ecological zone of NWFP. Randomized complete block design was used with 3 replications. Six planting dates were used from October 25 th to December 15 th with 10 days increment. Data were recorded on Days to 50 % heading, Days to maturity, Plant height and Grain yield. Maximum number of days (132) to 50 % heading were recorded when planting <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>on</b> October 25 th Minimum number of days (114) were reported when planting <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>on</b> December, 15 th. Maximum number of days (178) to maturity were recorded when planting <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>on</b> October 25 th. Number of days to maturity decreased as planting was delayed with 10 days increment. Minimum number of days (130) were recorded when planting was delayed till 15 th of December. Highest plant height (98 cm) was recorded when planting <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>on</b> October 25 th and November 05 th. Plant Height decreased as planting was delayed. Minimum Plant height (85 cm) was recorded when planting was delayed till 15 th of December. Maximum grain yield (3937 kg ha - 1) was recorded when planting <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>on</b> November 05 th. Grain yield decreased as planting was delayed with 10 days increment. Minimum grain yield (2274 kg ha - 1) was observed when planting <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>on</b> 15 th of December. A negative correlation was recorded between planting dates and days to 50 % heading, days to maturity, Plant height and Grain yield. The yield losses due to late planting recorded were 8 % when planting <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>on</b> November 15 th, 22 % loss when planting <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>on</b> 25 th November, 34 % losses were incurred when planting <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>on</b> December 5 th and 42 % losses were recorded when planting was further delayed till December 15 th. Hence it is concluded that {{first two weeks of}} November is the best time for obtaining higher yields from the recommended cultivars...|$|R
