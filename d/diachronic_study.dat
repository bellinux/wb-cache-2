5000|$|Synchrony and {{diachrony}} are {{two different}} and complementary viewpoints in linguistic analysis. A synchronic approach (from Greek συν- [...] "together" [...] and χρόνος [...] "time") considers a language at {{a moment in time}} without taking its history into account. Synchronic linguistics aims at describing a language at a specific point of time, usually the present. By contrast, a diachronic approach (from δια- [...] "through" [...] and χρόνος [...] "time") considers the development and evolution of a language through history. Historical linguistics is typically a <b>diachronic</b> <b>study.</b>|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to attempt to read the text of Genesis 18 - 19 {{in line with the}} {{canonical}} approach of Brevard S Childs in order to critique his programme through its actual praxis. In chapter 1 a historical introduction to the discipline of 'biblical theology' and its texts provides a background against which to contextualise Childs's own work and its historical development. A detailed description of the approach in terms of its historical justification and its actual praxis appears in chapter 2. There certain common criticisms are encountered and refuted. It is also suggested that Childs's approach is often the target of unwarranted criticism based upon an assumed foundationalist view of hermeneutics. In chapter 3, this is developed further and it is argued that the non-foundationalist hermeneutics of Stanley E. Fish provide a heuristically powerful way of understanding the canonical approach and its 'community of faith'. Two aspects of the praxis of the canonical approach form the core of chapter 4 : the necessary role of narrative presuppositions and the potential role of <b>diachronic</b> <b>studies</b> of biblical texts. A description of presuppositions necessary for understanding Genesis 18 - 19 are drawn from Genesis 1 - 17 and outlined, and the <b>diachronic</b> <b>studies</b> of H. Gunkel is used as an exemplar to test the illumination which <b>diachronic</b> <b>studies</b> may provide to readers of the canonical text. In chapters 5 and 6, a detailed exegesis is provided of the canonical text of Genesis 18 and Genesis 19. A short section on the effects of this exegesis on subsequent Old Testament texts completes chapter 6. In conclusion, the experience of reading the texts in this way is used to point out certain aspects and implications of the canonical approach which are missed when the approach is considered in purely theoretical terms...|$|R

40|$|The article {{reports on}} a cross-linguistic {{synchronic}} and <b>diachronic</b> corpus <b>study</b> on indefinites. The study covered five indefinite expressions, each in a different language. The main goal {{of the study was}} to verify the distribution of these indefinites synchronically and to attest their historical development. The methodology we used is a form of functional labeling which combines both context (syntax) and meaning (semantics) using as a starting point Haspelmath’s (1997) functional map. In the article we identify Haspelmath’s functions with logico-semantic interpretations and propose a binary branching decision tree assigning each instance of an indefinite exactly one function in the map. On Haspelmath’s proposal an indefinite will always express a set of functions that are contiguous on the map. A further prediction is that, if an indefinite acquires new functions, it will develop first those that are adjacent to the original function. The main result of the synchronic studies is that none of the indefinites investigated violates the function contiguity. The main conclusion of the <b>diachronic</b> <b>studies</b> is that the acquisition of new functions is not unidirectional...|$|R
