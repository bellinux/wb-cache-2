40|$|When {{strained}} Stranski-Krastanow {{islands are}} used as “self-assembled quantum dots,” a key goal is to control the <b>island</b> <b>position.</b> Here we show that nanoscale grooves can control the nucleation of epitaxial Ge islands on Si(001), and can drive lateral motion of existing islands onto the grooves, even when the grooves are very narrow and shallow compared to the islands. A position centered on the groove minimizes energy. We use as prototype grooves the trenches which form naturally around islands. During coarsening, the shrinking islands move laterally to sit directly astride that trench. In subsequent growth, we demonstrate that islands nucleate on the “empty trenches” which remain on the surface after complete dissolution of the original islands...|$|E

As a result the discontinuities in the ambipolar electric field profile are smoothed. 1...|$|E

40|$|In the {{framework}} of the new continuous transfer and extraction scheme of the CERN PS, a series of measurements has been done to explore the phase space and the topology of the resonance islands.

The underlying relation is derived from first principles and illustrated with an explicit example and numerical test. Possible influences on the measurement, like filamentation processes inside the islands, are discussed and evaluated. The exact knowledge of the theoretical <b>island</b> <b>position</b> in phase space is very important for the determination of the capture efficiency.

40|$|The {{degradation}} of plasma confinement in tokamaks by magnetic islands motivates {{to better understand}} their possible suppression using Electron Cyclotron Current Drive (ECCD) and to investigate the various strategies relevant for this purpose.

A basic control system has been implemented in the code, allowing testing advanced strategies that require feedback on <b>island</b> <b>position</b> or phase. We focus in particular on the robustness of the control strategies towards the uncertainties that apply on the control and ECCD systems, such as the risk of misalignment of the current deposition or the possible inability to generate narrow current deposition...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanisms}} of the misfit strain relaxation in heteroepitaxial islands are investigated in twodimensional molecular dynamics simulations. Stress distributions are analyzed for coherent and dislocated islands. Thermally-activated nucleation of misfit dislocations upon annealing at an elevated temperature and their motion from {{the edges of}} the islands towards the positions corresponding to the maximum strain relief is observed and related to the corresponding decrease of the total strain energy of the system. Differences between the predictions of the energy balance and force balance criteria for the appearance of misfit dislocations is discussed. Simulations of an island located at different distances form the edge of a mesa indicate that the energy of the system decreases sharply as the <b>island</b> <b>position</b> shifts toward the edge.

40|$|Mass {{analysis}} with linear quadrupole mass filters is possible by forming “islands” in the stability diagram with auxiliary quadrupole excitation. In this work, computer simulations {{are used to}} calculate stability boundaries, <b>island</b> <b>positions,</b> and peak shapes and ion transmission for mass {{analysis with}} linear quadrupole mass filters that have added octopole fields of about 2 to 4 %. Rod sets with exact geometries that have quadrupole and octopole fields only in the potential, and round rod sets, with multipoles up to N = 10 (the twenty pole term) included in the calculations, show the same stability boundaries, <b>island</b> <b>positions,</b> and peak shapes. With the DC voltage applied to the rods so that the Mathieu parameter a 0, the resolution and transmission are poor preventing conventional mass analysis. In principle, mass analysis in an island is possible with operation at either of two tips. Provided the correct island tip is chosen for mass analysis, peak shapes comparable to those with a > 0 and no excitation are possible, both with a > 0 and with a < 0. In the latter case, {{the use of an}} island of stability allows mass analysis when the added octopole otherwise prevents conventional mass analysis...|$|R
40|$|Anomalous {{scattering}} of high power millimetre waves from gyrotrons at 140 and 110 &nbsp;GHz is investigated for plasma with rotating islands at TEXTOR. The magnetic field and plasma density influence the spectral {{content of the}} scattered waves and their power levels significantly. Anomalous strong scattering occurs in two density regimes, one at low densities and one at high densities, that also depend on the magnetic field. The two regimes are separated by a quiescent regime without anomalous scattering. Investigations suggest that scattering in the high-density regime is generated at the low-field side intersection of the gyrotron beam and the <b>island</b> <b>position.</b> The transition from the quiescent regime to the high-density regime occurs when the gyrotron frequency is twice the upper hybrid frequency at this position. There {{is some evidence that}} the scattering in the low-density regime is generated near the plasma centre.

40|$|Abstract. Active {{control of}} MHD instabilities is {{important}} {{in order to improve}} tokamak performance. This paper describes experimental work done on FTU tokamak in this field, in particular for the automatic suppression of Tearing Modes (TM) via simultaneous detection and tracking of <b>island</b> <b>position,</b> sawteeth inversion radius and Electron Cyclotron Heating (ECH) power deposition. Effective control in real time is achieved through the implementation of a system for automatic detection of TM onset, and stabilizing reaction with ECH/ECCD. The system is composed by a particular arrangement of the 140 GHz, 4 x 0. 5 MW ECH set-up, and a DSP-based (Digital Signal Processor) unit for the analysis of ECE and Mirnov data, and for the control of gyrotron power supplies. Main emphasis is given to the intrinsic capability of the arrangement for a fast reaction to an early warning of the TM appearance. In order to improve ECH power deposition identification by synchronous detection of ECE oscillations and ECH power modulation, special techniques based on non-periodic pulse sequences have been implemented. 1...|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} {{tunneling}} conductance of nano-scale quantum ``shuttles'' {{in connection with}} a recent experiment (H. Park et al., Nature, 407, 57 (2000)) in which a vibrating C^ 60 molecule was apparently functioning as the island of a single electron transistor (SET). While our calculation starts from the same model of previous work (D. Boese and H. Schoeller, Europhys. Lett. 54, 66 (2001)) we obtain quantitatively different dynamics. Calculated I-V curves exhibit most features present in experimental data with a physically reasonable parameter set, and point to a strong dependence of the oscillator's potential on the electrostatics of the island region. We propose that in a regime where the electric field due to the bias voltage itself affects <b>island</b> <b>position,</b> a "catastrophic" negative differential conductance (NDC) may be realized. This effect is directly attributable to the magnitude of overlap of final and initial quantum oscillator states, and as such represents experimental control over quantum transitions of the oscillator via the macroscopically controllable bias voltage.
