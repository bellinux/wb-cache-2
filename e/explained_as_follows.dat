2500|$|These {{patterns}} can be <b>explained</b> <b>as</b> <b>follows.</b> If [...] is an integer, then (a, , [...] ) is a Pythagorean triple. (In fact every Pythagorean triple (a, b, c) can {{be written}} in this way with integer n, possibly after exchanging a and b, since [...] and a and b cannot both be odd.) The Pythagorean triples thus lie on curves given by , that is, parabolas reflected at the a-axis, and the corresponding curves with a and b interchanged. If a is varied for a given n (i.e. on a given parabola), integer values of b occur relatively frequently if n is a square or a small multiple of a square. If several such values happen to lie close together, the corresponding parabolas approximately coincide, and the triples cluster in a narrow parabolic strip. For instance, 382 = 1444, 2×272 = 1458, ...|$|E
60|$|How, then, can {{we explain}} these several facts in embryology,--namely the very general, but not {{universal}} {{difference in structure}} between the embryo and the adult;--of parts in the same individual embryo, which ultimately become very unlike and serve for diverse purposes, being at this early period of growth alike;--of embryos of different species within the same class, generally, but not universally, resembling each other;--of {{the structure of the}} embryo not being closely related to its conditions of existence, except when the embryo becomes at any period of life active and has to provide for itself;--of the embryo apparently having sometimes a higher organisation than the mature animal, into which it is developed. I believe that all these facts can be <b>explained,</b> <b>as</b> <b>follows,</b> on the view of descent with modification.|$|E
60|$|How, then, can {{we explain}} these several facts in embryology--namely, the very general, though not universal, {{difference}} in structure between the embryo and the adult; the various parts in the same individual embryo, which ultimately become very unlike, and serve for diverse purposes, being at an early period of growth alike; the common, but not invariable, resemblance between the embryos or larvae of the most distinct species in the same class; the embryo often retaining, while within the egg or womb, structures which are of no service to it, either at that or at a later period of life; on the other hand, larvae which have {{to provide for their}} own wants, being perfectly adapted to the surrounding conditions; and lastly, the fact of certain larvae standing higher in the scale of organisation than the mature animal into which they are developed? I believe that all these facts can be <b>explained</b> <b>as</b> <b>follows.</b>|$|E

5000|$|In part, due to misunderstandings {{about how}} deferent/epicycle models worked, [...] "adding epicycles" [...] {{has come to}} be used as a {{derogatory}} comment in modern scientific discussion. The term might be used, for example, to describe continuing to try to adjust a theory to make its predictions match the facts. There is a generally accepted idea that extra epicycles were invented to alleviate the growing errors that the Ptolemaic system noted as measurements became more accurate, particularly for Mars. According to this notion, epicycles are regarded by some as the paradigmatic example of bad science. Part of the problem may be due to the misconception of the epicycle as an explanation of a body's motion rather than merely a description. Toomer <b>explains</b> <b>as</b> <b>follows,</b> ...|$|R
30|$|As {{shown in}} Figs.  8 and 9, the {{ignition}} temperature of modified CWSs increases {{compared with the}} origin one and the modified CWS (BR 1 and BR 3) apparent activation energy are larger than BRYM, so the modified CWSs (BR 1 and BR 3) are not easier to be ignited than the raw CWS.

50|$|This can be <b>explained</b> <b>as</b> <b>follows.</b> Each {{point in}} the image can be {{considered}} to be illuminated by a finite area in the object. The size of this area is determined by the diffraction-limited resolution of the lens which is given by the Airy disk whose diameter is 2.4λu/D, where λ is the wavelength of the light, u is the distance between the object and the lens, and D is the diameter of the lens aperture. (This is a simplified model of diffraction-limited imaging).|$|E

The theorem states that if every subset of k boys (for each k such that 0 ≤ k ≤ r) between them know k or more girls, then each boy can be paired off with a girl that he knows. It is obvious {{that this is a}} necessary condition for pairing to take place; what is surprising is that it is sufficient.|$|E
