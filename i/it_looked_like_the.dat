5|$|The 1942 Papuan {{campaign}} {{threw up}} {{a host of}} serious medical problems. The poor diet, mainly caused by the difficulty of supply by air or over jungle tracks, caused malnutrition and vitamin deficiencies. Poor hygiene led to dysentery. Malaria was hyperendemic, and when Fairley and Mackerras visited Papua in June 1942 they found high rates of infection among the troops even before the fighting had begun. At Milne Bay the incidence was so high in September 1942 that <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> garrison would be wiped out {{in a matter of}} months. The biggest killer, though, was typhus. Of the 2,839 soldiers who came down with it, 257 (9 percent) died. It fell to Burston promulgate the policies and practices that diminished the danger from disease and allowed the Australian Army to fight in New Guinea.|$|E
5|$|In the semi-finals, the Kerala Blasters {{were set}} {{to take on the}} regular season winners, Chennaiyin. The first leg took place at home for the Kerala Blasters, the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium in Kochi, on 13 December 2014. The match could not have been any better for the Kerala Blasters as goals from Ishfaq Ahmed, Iain Hume, and Sushanth Mathew gave the Kerala Blasters a 3–0 {{advantage}} heading to Chennai. The second leg took place three days later at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium in Chennai. Despite heading into the game leading 3–0 on aggregate, the Blasters managed to concede three goals to Chennaiyin in the second leg and thus bring the game into extra-time. Just as <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> game was going to be settled in a penalty shoot-out, the Blasters managed to steal the tie when Stephen Pearson scored in the 117th minute and thus help the Kerala Blasters win 4–3 on aggregate.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} played on 18 November on an icy pitch (straw had not been spread over the pitch the night before), which nearly caused the game to be cancelled. The All Blacks kicked off, and had {{the best of the}} first ten minutes. Scotland {{eventually}} got a scrum near the All Blacks goal-line, and after winning the scrum, passed to Ernest Simson, who dropped a goal to put Scotland ahead 4–0. It {{was the first time the}} All Blacks had been behind on tour. The All Blacks replied with a try under the posts, which was unconverted. A second try was then scored, by Smith; again it went unconverted. Scotland then scored an unconverted try, to lead at half time 7–6. With less than ten minutes to go the score remained 7–6 and <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> All Blacks might lose their first match on tour. However, with four minutes to go the All Blacks had a scrum on halfway; the resulting movement finished with George Smith crossing for a try. Bill Cunningham then scored a try with seconds remaining, and the All Blacks were victorious 12–7.|$|E

25|$|The league {{went down}} to the last round with Ulster and Leinster both in contention. Following Leinster's victory over Edinburgh and with Ulster losing against the Ospreys, <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> cup would go to Dublin but David Humphreys kicked a last minute 40-metre drop goal to clinch the game and the league for Ulster.|$|E
25|$|So {{following}} a rough week during which <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> festival {{might even be}} cancelled for the year, the event was on again. The commercialization took further root with many more in-your-face sponsors and even the omnipresent MTV coming to Petrovaradin fortress {{for the first time}} to shoot a documentary on Novi Sad and the festival, as well as to publicize a human trafficking awareness campaign. The insatiable British music press also discovered the festival, resulting in some very affirmative reviews in NME and Mojo.|$|E
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> Leafs {{were ready}} to accept an offer for Sittler from the Quebec Nordiques when Imlach had another heart attack in August 1980. Ballard used the {{opportunity}} to name himself acting general manager and hold talks with Sittler, and the two agreed that Sittler {{would return to the}} team as captain for the 1980–81 season. Ballard also signed Börje Salming to a new contract with terms that Imlach had refused to offer. Before the end of 1981, Imlach was back running the Leafs as general manager.|$|E

25|$|With {{yet another}} new head coach (Jimmy Gardner), the Hamilton Tigers roared {{off to an}} {{impressive}} 10–4–1 start in the 1924–25 NHL season. Only halfway through the season, they had more wins than any other season in their NHL history. The team slumped somewhat {{in the second half}} of the season but still managed to finish first overall with a record of 19 wins, 10 losses, and 1 tie, just ahead of the Toronto St. Patricks. <b>It</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> franchise would have a chance at winning the Stanley Cup for the first time since winning it as the Bulldogs over a decade prior in 1913.|$|E
25|$|On paper, <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> Karmanos/Rutherford {{group was}} the frontrunner. Not {{only was the}} Karmanos/Rutherford group better financed, but one of Esposito's key backers, the Pritzker family, had backed out {{a few months before}} the bid. Esposito {{eventually}} recruited a consortium of Japanese businesses headed by Kokusai Green, a golf course and resort operator. The prospect of Japanese backing tipped the scales in the Esposito group's favor, and they were awarded an expansion franchise for the 1992–93 season, as was a group in Ottawa (which became the Senators). One of the team's limited partners was New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner, who lived in Tampa during the year.|$|E
25|$|Trevor Hoffman came on {{to try to}} {{earn the}} save in the ninth. After {{inducing}} two groundouts back to himself, it seemed like Hoffman, who, at the time, was second all-time in career saves, would finally send the American League to a loss in an All-Star Game {{for the first time}} in a decade. However, Paul Konerko hit a single to left past third baseman Miguel Cabrera, and was pinch-run for by José Lopez. Troy Glaus hit a ground rule double down the left field line, forcing Lopez to hold at third. While <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> National League received a break (as Lopez could have possibly scored the tying run if the ball stayed in play), Hoffman allowed a two-strike triple to Michael Young, who went on to win the MVP, scoring Lopez and Glaus and putting the AL up 3–2.|$|E

25|$|The Wings {{were quickly}} {{selected}} as favorites {{to win the}} Stanley Cup and they were right. With so much talent on one team, including the first time three 500-goal scorers {{were on the same}} team, they quickly got off to a great start, winning 22 of their first 27 games. After finishing with 116 points and {{the best record in the}} NHL (by 15 points), the Wings had earned the first seed in the Western Conference and met the Vancouver Canucks in the first round. After the Canucks took the first 2 games, <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> Canucks were going to sweep the Red Wings and the Red Wings were going to have their 2nd straight early exit. Their Captain, Steve Yzerman gave a closed-door speech to the team. Only the players in the locker room knew what was said, but the Wings headed to Vancouver and won four straight games to take the series.|$|E
25|$|Two rookies faced off in Game1 for {{the first}} time in history: Anthony Reyes for St. Louis and Justin Verlander for Detroit. <b>It</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> Tigers were going to get to Reyes early in the bottom of the first, when Craig Monroe doubled and Magglio Ordóñez walked. Carlos Guillén singled Monroe in, giving the Tigers a 1–0 lead. However, in the top of the second, Scott Rolen hit a long home run to left field, tying the score at 1–1. Rolen was 0-for-15 in his career in the World Series before hitting the home run. The {{previous}} mark had been 0-for-13, set by Benny Kauff of the New York Giants in the 1917 World Series. In the third inning the Cards broke through, first when Chris Duncan's RBI double scored Yadier Molina to give the Cardinals the lead. On Verlander's next pitch, 2005 National League MVP Albert Pujols banged a two-run home run, punishing the rookie who elected to pitch to the dangerous Pujols, rather than walk him with first base open and two outs and pitch to Jim Edmonds.|$|E
25|$|Critics of {{familial}} DNA database searches {{argue that}} the technique is an invasion of an individual's 4th Amendment rights. Privacy advocates are petitioning for DNA database restrictions, arguing that the only fair way to search for possible DNA matches to relatives of offenders or arrestees {{would be to have}} a population-wide DNA database. Some scholars have pointed out that the privacy concerns surrounding familial searching are similar in some respects to other police search techniques, and most have concluded that the practice is constitutional. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in United States v. Pool (vacated as moot) suggested that this practice is somewhat analogous to a witness looking at a photograph of one person and stating that <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> perpetrator, which leads law enforcement to show the witness photos of similar looking individuals, one of whom is identified as the perpetrator. Regardless of whether familial DNA searching was the method used to identify the suspect, authorities always conduct a normal DNA test to match the suspect's DNA with that of the DNA left at the crime scene.|$|E

25|$|After {{losing the}} Florida titles, Luke and Butch {{returned}} to the UWF and started a second run with the UWF World Tag Team Championship after beating Brad Armstrong and Tim Horner on 16 October. The Sheepherders held the UWF tag team titles until the UWF was bought out by Jim Crockett and merged into Jim Crockett Promotions to form the forerunner of WCW. When the UWF merged Luke and Butch began working for JCP, participating in the third Jim Crockett, Sr. Memorial, Tag Team Tournament Cup losing to The Midnight Express (Bobby Eaton and Stan Lane) in the second round. At , the Sheepherders faced off against the NWA United States Tag Team Champions the Fantastics, but did not win the gold.

25|$|Nick Barmby {{marked his}} 500th career {{appearance}} {{against one of}} his former clubs as Middlesbrough visited Hull City for the first ever top-flight match between the two sides. Hull lined up with former Boro captain George Boateng in midfield after his departure during the summer. The previous four league meetings between the two sides had all ended in 0–0 draws, and <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> match was heading for another until Tuncay opened the scoring on 79 minutes. Boro's lead didn't last long however, as Bernard Mendy's shot hit the post and rebounded off of goalkeeper Ross Turnbull to go down as an own goal. It got worse for the visitors as just a few minutes later, Hull were awarded a soft penalty when Wheater tangled with Geovanni – a challenge which also saw the Middlesbrough defender receive a red card. TV replays showed that Geovanni was offside when the ball was played to him, but nothing was awarded by the assistant referee. Marlon King converted the penalty to give Hull a 2–1 victory.|$|E
25|$|On {{the night}} of 10 July the Allies landed in Sicily. A landing had been expected, but after initial {{resistance}} the Italian forces were overwhelmed and in several cases, as in Augusta (the island's most fortified stronghold), they collapsed without fighting. In the first days, <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> Italians could defend Sicily, but after that {{it became apparent that}} Sicily was going to be lost. On 16 July, Bastianini went to Palazzo Venezia (the Duce's seat) to show to Mussolini a telegram to be sent to Hitler, where he reproached the Germans for not having sent reinforcements. After the Duce's approval, the undersecretary asked for the authorization to establish contacts with the Allies. Mussolini agreed, under the condition of not being directly involved. The secret emissary was the Vatican banker Giovanni Fummi, who was supposed to reach London via Madrid or Lisbon. On the same evening, Bastianini crossed the Tiber, meeting Cardinal Maglione, Vatican Secretary of State, who received a document explaining the Italian position about a possible unilateral exit from the war.|$|E

25|$|Around 12:00 (UTC) the {{formation}} lap for the Grand Prix started with race starting {{a few minutes}} later. With the air temperature at 31°C (88°F) and the track temperature at 49°C (120°F), <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> conditions were favouring the Brawn cars. The race started with Lewis Hamilton, Heikki Kovalainen and Rubens Barrichello as the top three after the first lap. Kimi Räikkönen had a good start making his way to fourth from sixth on the grid. Jenson Button had a poor start dropping to ninth {{in the first few}} corners, while Luca Badoer starting {{from the back of the}} grid jumped six positions to 14th at the start. Romain Grosjean then tapped the rear of Badoer's Ferrari, causing the Italian to spin. Grosjean had to pit for repairs, as did Timo Glock after he and Sébastien Buemi collided, the Swiss driver also pitting for a new nose. Mark Webber down in ninth got on the radio claiming that Button had cut the chicane to stop Webber's attempt of a pass. Button then fell behind Webber although it is unclear whether it was a legitimate pass or Jenson let the Red Bull driver through.|$|E
25|$|England {{needed a}} victory {{to keep the}} five-match One-day International series alive, and with Australia needing six runs off the last over, <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> Australians would secure the series with two matches to spare. However, Katherine Brunt had the last say, as she first had Cathryn Fitzpatrick stumped and then helped to run out Julie Hayes for a duck. Suddenly, Australia needed four from the last ball to win, and they could only get one, as England went into scenes of jubilation - having secured their first victory over the Australian women since 1993. Earlier, Claire Taylor had lifted England to 200 for 7 with her 82, taking on Fitzpatrick who conceded 61 runs in her 10 overs. All the six Australian bowlers got one wicket, however, with the seventh being a run out. Australia's opener Belinda Clark {{recorded}} another poor score with a six-ball duck, and Australia continued to lose wickets at regular intervals. Yet, at 195 for 5 with an over to spare, the wise money would normally {{have been on the}} tourists, but thanks to Brunt, it went England's way instead.|$|E
25|$|Beginning at WrestleMania 32, a {{match between}} Big Show and NBA star Shaquille O'Neal had been teased from various media outlets, {{including}} WWE. Shaq {{was a surprise}} entrant in the 2016 André the Giant Memorial Battle Royal where he and Big Show faced off, but the other participants eliminated both of them. In July at the 2016 ESPY Awards on the red carpet, Show and Shaq had another brief confrontation. A match was proposed for WrestleMania 33, which Shaq accepted. In January 2017, the two began calling each other out on social media, posting workout videos of themselves preparing for the potential match. Big Show then began to doubt Shaq's commitment to the match. By the end of February, Shaq said that <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> match {{was not going to}} happen, but he would still train just in case. The following week, Shaq said that discussions were back on between him and WWE. However, Big Show's announcement as a participant in the 2017 André the Giant Memorial Battle Royal indicated that the match was off. According to Dave Meltzer of Wrestling Observer Newsletter, the match was canceled due to monetary reasons, as both parties could not agree on a deal. Big Show said that he really wanted to do the match, especially since this would probably be his last WrestleMania and blamed Shaq's weight as a reason for why Shaq backed out.|$|E
