5000|$|Fine {{blanking}} presses {{are similar}} to other metal stamping presses, {{but they have a}} few critical additional parts. A typical compound fine blanking press includes a hardened die punch (male), the hardened blanking die (female), and a guide plate of similar shape/size to the blanking die. The guide plate is the first applied to the material, impinging the material with a sharp protrusion or stinger {{around the perimeter of the}} die opening. Next a counter pressure is applied opposite the punch, and finally the die punch forces the material through the die opening. Since the guide plate holds the material so tightly, and since the counter pressure is applied, the material is cut in a manner more like extrusion than typical punching. Mechanical properties of the cut benefit similarly with a hardened layer at the cut edge of the part. [...] Because the material is so tightly held and controlled in this setup, part flatness remains very true, distortion is nearly eliminated, and <b>edge</b> <b>burr</b> is minimal. Clearances between the die and punch are generally around 1% of the cut material thickness, which typically varies between 0.5 - 13 mm. Currently parts as thick as 19 mm can be cut using fine blanking. Tolerances between ±0.0003 - 0.002 in are possible, depending on base material thickness and tensile strength, and part layout.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} impact of <b>edge</b> <b>burr</b> faults on total power loss in {{electrical}} machine core laminations. Analytical techniques, experimental work and FEM modelling have been utilised to investigate {{the effect of the}} phenomenon from different aspects. Measurements of overall specific total loss and analytical techniques were used to separate the power loss components over wide magnetising frequency ranges. Two techniques were used in this project for <b>edge</b> <b>burr</b> simulation; these include (1) the short circuiting of two Epstein-size and three Epstein-size and large-size, non-oriented steel laminations by lead-free solder in the rolling and transverse directions and (2) the by clamping system method, which was designed for the application of edge burrs on toroid cores. Various sizes of artificial edge burrs were applied at set points and then in a random manner to confirm their effect and show the extent of their effect in different case scenarios and the tests were completely repeatable. 3 -D FEM modelling for toroid cores was also used to study {{the impact of}} core geometry on the total core loss. This method provided a clear explanation for why smaller toroid cores have higher power loss than the larger ones. The research presented in this thesis can be utilised by electrical steel manufacturers and electrical machine designers to evaluate the impact of <b>edge</b> <b>burr</b> faults on the properties of magnetic cores.

An ectopic expression of SASH 1 is associated with decreased cell viability of breast cancer. The aim of this study was to explore the association between SASH 1 expression and the ultrasonographic features in breast cancer. Patients and methods: A total of 186 patients diagnosed with breast cancer were included in this study. The patients received preoperative ultrasound examination, and the expression of SASH 1 was determined using immunohistochemistry methods. Spearman’s rank correlation analysis was used to analyze the correlation between SASH 1 -positive expression and the ultrasonographic features. Results: The positive expression of SASH 1 was observed in 63 (33. 9 %) patients. The positive expression rate of SASH 1 was significantly decreased in patients with breast cancer (63 / 186, 33. 9 %) compared with controls (P< 0. 001). The positive expression rate of SASH 1 was significantly decreased in patients with <b>edge</b> <b>burr</b> sign (P= 0. 025), lymph node metastasis (P= 0. 007), and a blood flow grade of III (P= 0. 013) compared with patients without those adverse ultrasonographic features.

It is shown that the orbital drilling approach is feasible to machine the hole of hardened steel with smooth surface and little burrs using an AlTiN coating WC drill bite.

An experimental setup consisting of a 25 W CO 2 laser, three CNC linear stages, and a high speed spindle was used to implement the LAMM process. Micro-endmills between 100 and 300 µm in diameter were used to perform slotting and side-cutting operations with and without laser preheat on four materials: AISI 316, AISI 422, Ti- 6 Al- 4 V, and Inconel 718. Experimental procedures were first studied and best practices were established including: acoustic emission based methods for tool-workpiece contact detection, laser-tool alignment strategies, assist gas chip removal, and appropriate ranges of machining parameters. ^ Finite volume based modeling of the 3 -D laser heating process was performed {{in order to determine}} the effect of laser operating parameters on the material removal temperature, peak temperature, and variation in temperature across the material removal area. A novel thermal paint based method was used to determine the absorptivity of each surface and validate the thermal model. A 2 -D finite element model of the chip formation process was developed. Material plasticity was considered using Johnson-Cook constitutive models. The FE model incorporated an arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian adaptive mesh scheme, heat generated by plastic deformation, and the edge radius of the cutting tool. Variations in material removal temperatures, cutting speed, uncut chip thickness, and cutting edge radius were analyzed on the bases of peak tool temperatures and cutting forces. ^ Slotting and side-cutting LAMM experiments were performed based on the results of the numerical models. LAMM results were compared to conventional (no-laser) on the bases of: surface roughness, <b>edge</b> <b>burrs,</b> tool wear, tool life, acoustic emissions, and the microstructure of remaining work material. Significant improvements in all quantitative and qualitative measures were found with LAMM. Neither degradation nor significant change in the remaining workpiece microstructure was observed during multi-pass LAMM at material removal temperatures up to 450 °C. Process improvements with LAMM were heavily dependent on the work material, machining configuration, and operating parameters.

One of the main concerns in mi- cromachining is burr formation which can incur high production costs due to time-consuming deburring operations. Although deburring operations are commonly carried out in macroscale milling, in micro machining they can be difficult to use.

Additionally, indoor toxicity and the in vitro control effect of PCN were further studied to determine its potential mechanisms of action on B. cinerea. PCN was inhibitory against B. cinerea with a 50 % effective concentration (EC 50) of 108. 12 μg/mL; the toxicity of PCN was equivalent to that of carbendazim (CBM). The best in vitro control effect of PCN against grey mould in strawberry (fruit) reached 75. 32 %, which was slightly higher than that of CBM. The field control effect of PCN against grey mould reached a maximum of 72. 31 % at a PCN concentration of 700 μg/mL, which was 1. 02 times higher than that of CBM. Fungistatic activity was observed at low concentrations of PCN, while high concentrations of PCN resulted in fungicidal activity against B. cinerea. This natural compound strongly inhibited both spore and sclerotium germination of B. cinerea, with the best relative inhibition rates of 77. 03 % and 82. 11 %, respectively. The inhibitory effect of PCN on mycelial growth of B. cinerea was significant and reached levels of 87. 32 %. Scanning electron microscopy observations revealed that after 48 h of PCN treatment, the mycelia appeared loose, locally twisted, and folded, with exudation of contents; the mycelia was withered and twisted, with <b>edge</b> <b>burrs,</b> deformations, ruptures and a sheet-like structure. Transmission electron microscopy observations revealed that after 48 h of PCN treatment, the structure of the cell nucleus was unclear and the vacuoles had ruptured; additionally, various organelles exhibited disordered structures, there were substantial non-membrane transparent inclusions, the cells were plasmolysed, the cell walls were collapsed in some cases, and the hyphal tissue was essentially necrotic. A PCN dosage of 35 - 140 μg/mL had no effect on the cell membrane permeability of the mycelia, while a PCN dosage of 700 μg/mL resulted in significant permeability.

40|$|Abstract: Deburring is a {{critical}} step {{in the manufacture of}} a machined part. The two-pass control concept of this paper removes burrs and produces a consistent chamfer, even with fixture, part, and robot errors. The approach requires a robot for gross positioning of the cutter and an around-the-arm end effector capable of measuring orthogonal force between cutter and workpiece, measuring cutter position with respect to end-effector frame of reference, and actively controlling the cutter-applied orthogonal force. In the first pass, compliance control (orthogonal to workpiece) removes burrs by programming the cutter to act as a low-pass filter on the burrs, where the cutter bandwidth is less than burr time-frequency content, while complying to the fixture, part, and robot errors. In the second pass, chamfer depth variations are smoothed out using chamfer control, where chamfer depth is controlled by computing an estimated real-time chamfer depth, and using this estimate in a feedback loop that varies the cutter-workpiece force to maintain a commanded chamfer depth. The chamfer depth estimator removes repeatable fixture, part, and robot errors by using cutter position measurements from the first pass. Cutting experiments on <b>edges</b> with <b>burrs</b> show that compliance control improved on the force control approach in compensating for burrs, and chamfer control was able to produce a consistent chamfer depth.

40|$|Numerous {{papers have}} been {{published}} associated {{with the development of}} thin hard coatings having diverse architectures (e. g., multicomponent, multilayer, graded, nanocomposite etc.) and deposition of these thin coatings on cutting tools to enhance their performance and life. While considerable success has been reported on enhancing the cutting process (i. e., increasing productivity, reducing manufacturing costs, improving product quality and competitiveness) by the application of coatings such as TiN, TiC, TiAlN, TiCrN etc., there are also number of cases where coatings have failed to improve the performance and life of the cutting tools. Often the coating itself is blamed for the poor performance of the coated cutting tools, but in practice the characteristics and condition of the cutting edges prior to coating deposition might have even greater impact in failure of the system. For example, if the cutting edges are very sharp, the coating will start to break off from that sharp point and the whole purpose of coating application on the cutting tool would be undermined. The paper presents the results of success and failure stories of coated cutting tools and the necessary steps should be taken to achieve the objective of improved performance from the coated tools.

40|$|AbstractMicroholes for {{gasoline}} direct injection (GDI) nozzles were obtained in martensitic stainless steel AISI 440 C with conventional micro-EDM and two laser based processes: water-jet guided μs-laser and fs-laser. Since the analyzed drilling methods heavily differ for their thermal input on materials, the three processes were compared {{from the perspective of}} the microstructural changes induced in the bulk material after drilling. Moreover, the sharpness of the edges was taken into account as distinctive feature for a comparison among the three processes, being the spray atomization maximized by a cavitation process inside the microhole. A tailored procedure was optimized to prepare the samples for Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and metallographic analyses. The cross sections of micro-EDM drilled samples revealed the presence of a recast (white) layer of 1 - 2 μm in thickness even using the lowest spark energy in the tested range. Samples drilled by water-jet guided μs-laser are affected by the same phenomenon, with an even more pronounced effect. Moreover, they showed the extrusion of the melt material along the hole axis under the action of the water-jet conveying the beam. The extremely fast cooling of this layer also makes the machined surfaces prone to cracking. Conversely, metallographic analysis of cross sections of ultrashort pulsed laser drilled samples, showed no modification of the base metal microstructure in the sub-surface regions, thus testifying that the fs-pulsed laser drilling was an almost pure ablation process and not affected by a remarkable liquid phase as for the other two thermal processes. Periodicity and dimensions of laser induced periodic surface structures (LIPSS) generated by ultrashort pulsed laser were characterized by means of Scanning Electron Microscopy.

40|$|An {{excellent}} {{quality of}} shearing edge implies that a smooth cutting edge without tearing will be observed {{on the whole}} edge surface. This {{is one of the}} most significant features of the fine-blanking process. To achieve this good blanking edge quality in fine-blanking, quite a large number of factors need to be considered simultaneously during the operation, such as blanking speed, processing material, product shape, lubrication and tool geometry. Thus, the objective of this paper is mainly to study the influence of tool geometry change in fine-blanking for different materials. This is because the nose radius usually seriously deteriorates with increasing service period in mass production, which eventually causes the entire loss of the specific features of the fine-blanking process. Therefore, a tailor-made experimental study was carried out to investigate the relationship between the punch nose radius and the shearing edge quality, such as the shearing <b>edge</b> surface finish, <b>burr</b> height and die-roll height, during fine-blanking for different types of materials. Consequently, findings show that an increase in the punch nose radius produces a higher percentage of fracture of the blanked edge and increases the amount of burr height.

40|$|Although {{deburring}} {{technology is}} used in precision manufacturing and high-quality machining, deburring is still considered a difficult problem. Precision parts require care to achieve precise dimensions and surface quality and in subsequent finishing operations. Deburring and edge finishing typically receive little attention from designers and manufacturing engineers. Due to deburring difficulties, it can {{account for more than}} 30 % of the total production cost when components are small. Efficient and effective deburring of miniature and/or precision components is very difficult. Therefore, this work applies a highly efficient and fully automatic novel electrochemical system that uses a rotating barrel. The effects of the main factors, such as barrel rotational speed, electrical current density, electrolyte temperature and process time, are investigated. Finally, optimal conditions are identified by applying the design of experiment to the required <b>edge</b> quality. The <b>burrs</b> on brass gears are dissolved and removed properly and the radius of the fillet of the gears after deburring has a small standard deviation of 5. 9 μm within only 5 minutes when using the proposed system of a rotational barrel with electrochemical deburring. This electrochemical system is an effective and efficient system to remove burrs from miniature metal parts...|$|R
40|$|To reduce carbon emission, {{transportation}} {{sector has}} adapted lithium-ion battery-based hybridization {{of gasoline and}} diesel engines due to its efficiency, the availability of technologies, and nationwide infrastructures. To cut prismatic and cylindrical electrodes for lithium-ion batteries, die cutting and rotary knife slitting have been used. Both techniques have disadvantages such as tool wear, process instability, inconsistency of cut quality, and redesign of mechanical cutting processes due to various battery sizes. High speed remote laser cutting overcomes these disadvantages with characteristics such as contact-free process, high energy concentration, low noise level, fast processing speed, very narrow heat affected zone, applicability to nearly all materials, and flexibility of laser power. Optimization of key parameters, or power and scanning speed, has been presented for laser cutting of electrodes for lithium-ion batteries. An acceptable clearance width is observed. The line energy is defined as dividing laser power by scanning speed and spot size. A good quality of cut surface, with no defects, such as delamination, <b>burrs,</b> <b>edge</b> bending, or microsized material attachments, is achieved with line energies between 0. 8 x 10 (12) and 2. 5 x 10 (12) J m(- 3) for anode and 0. 31 x 10 (12) Jm(- 3) and less than 3. 5 x 10 (12) Jm(- 3) for cathode...|$|R
40|$|The {{past years}} have seen {{emphasis}} on increasing the quality of machined workpieces {{while at the same}} time reducing the cost per piece. Accompanying this is the decreasing size and increasing complexity of workpieces. This has put continual pressure on improvements in the machining process in terms of new processes, new tooling and tool materials, and new machine tools. This often falls under the terminology of High Performance Cutting (HPC) — the theme of this conference. A recent CIRP keynote / 1 / outlined and explained some of these drivers for enhancement in machining technology. Fundamental to this continual improvement is understanding edge finishing of machined components, specially burrs. Deburring, like inspection, is a non-productive operation and, as such, should be eliminated or minimized to the greatest extent possible. nderstanding of the fundamentals of burr formation leads us to procedures for preventing or, at least, minimizing, burr formation. This depends on analytical models of burr formation, studies of tool/workpiece interaction for understanding the creation of burrs and, specially, the material influence, data bases describing cutting conditions for optimal edge quality, and design rules for burr prevention as well as standard terminology for describing <b>edge</b> features and <b>burrs.</b> Ultimately, engineering software tools must be available so that design and manufacturing engineers can use this knowledge interactively in their tasks to yield a mechanical part whose design and production is optimized for burr prevention along with the other critical specifications. This paper reviews recent work done in all these areas with an emphasis on research at the University of California at Berkeley...|$|R
