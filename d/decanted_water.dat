5000|$|Ragi mudde, a store {{house of}} multi nutrients, {{has only two}} ingredients, the Ragi (finger millet) flour and water. A {{tablespoon}} of Ragi flour is first mixed with water {{to make a very}} thin paste and later added to a thick bottomed vessel containing water on a stove top. As this mixture boils and reaches the brim of the vessel, ragi flour is added which forms a mound on top of boiling water. The flour is allowed to cook in this fashion on medium high flame. Later {{with the help of a}} wooden stick (ಮುದ್ದೆ ಕೋಲು: mudde kolu / ಹಿಟ್ಟಿನ ದೊಣ್ಣೆ: [...] hiTTin doNNe), the flour is beaten to a smooth dough like consistency with no lumps. This hot dough is then rested on low heat before rounding them on a wooden board into tennis sized balls with wet hands. Thus prepared Ragi balls are broke down into smaller balls using fingers and swallowed hot dipping them in 'saaru' ಹೆಸ್ರು/ 'hesru' ಹೆಸ್ರು, chutney or gojju. It is not supposed to be chewed. Mudde, by itself, does not have a strong taste. Ragi Mudde is traditionally eaten with saaru (predominantly vegetarian, but sometimes also made from meat), but can also be eaten with yogurt or butter milk. The saaru is often flavoured by mixing a dash of spicy, freshly ground green-chilli paste (ಖಾರ [...] "Khaara"), in one's plate - according to taste. [...] "Ragi Mudde-Bassaru" [...] is a popular combination among the farming communities in Karnataka. Bassaru is made from the <b>decanted</b> <b>water,</b> which remains after (an assortment of) pulses are steamed (usually along with a couple of pods of garlic). This water takes up the earthy flavour of the pulses to nicely complement the earthy flavour of the 'Mudde' itself. Browned onions, red chillies, and some garlic are browned, and then ground into a paste along with grated coconut. This is added to the water, and the mixture is finally seasoned with Chaunk. The steamed pulses themselves are often used to prepare a dry side salad known as 'palya' (ಪಲ್ಯ).|$|E

There are increasing reports of the involvement of the organisms in biofilms. This present study describes a sampling device that can be inserted directly into pipes within water distribution systems, allowing biofilm formation in situ. Calcofluor White M 2 R staining and fluorescent in situ hybridization with morphological analyses using epifluorescent microscopy were used to analyse biofilms for filamentous fungi, permitting direct observation of the fungi. DAPI (4 =, 6 -diamidino- 2 - phenylindole) was applied to detect bacteria. Filamentous fungi were detected in biofilms after 6 months on coupons exposed to raw water, <b>decanted</b> <b>water</b> and at the entrance of the water distribution system.

30|$|Safety issues {{associated}} {{with the construction of}} FCPW impoundments include embankment failures and coal slurry spillage due to subsidence in close proximity mines. Stability concerns started with the Buffalo Creek disaster in 1972, which killed 125 people and injured 1, 190 others (NRC 2002) and prompted National regulation regarding coal waste embankment design, construction, operation and closure. Another 32 -million gallon coal slurry spill occurred in 1994 near Davella, Kentucky. Here subsidence drained slurry into in a sealed underground mine only about 10  m below the impoundment. A similar but much more severe slurry spill occurred at a site near Inez, Kentucky in 2000. In this case about 1 million liters of <b>decant</b> <b>water</b> and 130 million liters of FCPW fines drained into a subsidence feature (Stewart and Robinson 1994; NRC 2002). A number of smaller FCPW spills have also occurred in Appalachia (Canon 1981; NRC 2002). Potential environmental impacts of current waste disposal practices are not limited to a relatively few catastrophic events. Implementation of proper management practices is necessary for prevention of groundwater contamination and mitigation of surface water impact to the receiving water body.|$|R

40|$|Mine tailing ponds are {{environmental}} hazards {{because of high}} susceptibility to leaching and erosion by water and wind. Vegetation establishment is an effective technique to reclaim tailing ponds but requires knowledge of the spatial relationship between the structural composition and {{physical and chemical properties}} of soils. In this study we have demonstrated the use of electrical resistivity imaging (ERI), combined with soil chemical analyses, to determine the structural and chemical composition of mine tailing ponds to assess efficient measures of environmental protection. We used a Syscal R 1 resistivity meter to generate two-and three-dimensional (2 -D/ 3 -D) ERI images from El Lirio and Brunita mine tailing ponds. Soil samples were collected at 1 -m intervals to a depth of 15 m, and were analyzed for pH, electrical conductivity and cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu), lead (Pb) and zinc (Zn) contents. Results show that materials in the ponds can be classified into three categories: fine tailings – low ER (, 8 V-m), coarse waste rock – intermediate ER (8 – 150 V-m), and bedrock – high ER (. 150 V-m). Our interpretation of the 2 -D/ 3 -D ERI images with respect to the historical depositions of materials in the ponds show that at El Lirio, <b>decant</b> <b>water</b> outlet was initially at the center and advance...|$|R

40|$|Intensive {{mining and}} ore {{processing}} activities concerning phosphate and polymetallic sulphidic ores and concentrates have generated throughout Europe millions of tonnes {{of hazardous wastes}} which contain high residual concentrations of heavy elements and radionuclides in mobile forms. Under the action of several physicochemical mechanisms, toxic and radioactive elements contained in the wastes are mobilised, migrate to the surroundings and cause severe and widespread contamination of soils, surface and ground waters. In order to assess the risk posed by each source of pollution at each affected area and to select a viable remedial action, a risk assessment study based on a source-pathway-target basis is considered necessary. This study utilises all available data concerning wastes, probable transfer routes and target groups affected and defines the magnitude of risk for each case. In this paper, two areas of Eastern-Europe, Vromos Bay in Bulgaria and Navodari in Romania are used as case studies. At Vromos Bay, several million tonnes of flotation tailings containing heavy and radioactive elements have been disposed at a tailings dam and by the Black Sea coast. At Navodari, several million tonnes of phosphogypsum tailings and pyritic cinders also containing heavy and radioactive elements have been disposed at tailing dumps. Besides, in the latter case, <b>decant</b> <b>waters</b> often without neutralisation are discharged with a pipeline to the Black Sea. For both areas, {{and in order to}} define a viable remediation scheme, a risk assessment study was undertaken, based on a complete environmental characterisation of the pollution sources.

50|$|One {{variation}} on the standard design of a lamella clarifier being developed {{is the way the}} effluent is collected {{at the top of the}} inclined plates. Rather than the effluent flowing over the top of the inclined plates to the outlet channel it flows through orifices at the top of the plates. This design allows for more consistent back pressure in the channels between the plates and hence a more consistent flow profile develops. Obviously this design only works for relatively clean effluent streams as the orifices would quickly become blocked with deposits which would severely reduce the efficiency of the unit. Another new design includes an adjustable upper portion of the vessel so that vessel height can be changed. This height adjustment is relative to a deflector, which directs the inlet stream.

40|$|The {{telescoping}} weir is {{an innovative}} structure {{that has the}} ability to closely control the environmental water quality during decantation and drainage of water from the dredged material surface of Confined Dredged Material Containment Facilities (CDF) by mechanically lowering and/or raising the weir crest to the desired elevation. The telescoping weir is designed to meet a range of water and dredged material storage levels common to most CDF sites. The express design life also as a capacity per area i. e. 2. 5 MCY per 100 AC of a 15 -ft high telescoping weir is ten to fifteen years depending on the filling rate, consolidation and surface area. The telescoping weir consists of a set of vertically nested cylinders set on end with one cylinder within the other. The telescoping weir is set within and attached to the base of a reaction frame that provides support for it and the machinery that controls the telescoping movements of the weir. The telescoping weir is raised and lowered by a set of mechanical screw jacks that operate simultaneously either manually or by a solar/battery-powered motor. The bottom cylinder is fixed to a foundation that is anchored {{to the bottom of the}} CDF and connected to a discharge pipe. The upper cylinders are extended in a telescoping manner to position the rim of the top cylinder to any desired elevation below or above the water surface. As the cylinders are lowered below the <b>water</b> surface, the <b>decant</b> <b>water</b> flows over the weir crest into the interior sections and exits through the discharge pipe in the lower section and returns to the receiving body of water. Improved safety and ease of operation of the telescoping weir and its ability to extend storage capacity of CDF’s by 10 to 20 percent are very attractive aspects. Operational success and increased storage capacity at Craney Island has shown the telescoping weir to be technically, economically and operationally feasibility.

The static and kinetic testing conducted further characterized the residues by assessing their acid generating and metal leaching capacity. Geochemical modeling of process residues is not widely reported in the literature due in part to the complexity of the mineralogical assemblage.

This work, through calibrated models, was successfully able to model the residue that led to a greater understanding of factors impacting the chemistry of groundwater and surface water and enabled the prediction of longer term subsurface conditions in the residue impoundment. [...] The design of a mine waste disposal site is waste and site specific and is complex. Using a risk-based decision-making to assess design options for a mine waste disposal project is novel and effective approach. This approach integrated the results from the mineralogical characterization and contaminant fate and transport modeling and included uncertainty in the human health and ecological risk analysis; then incorporated this risk analysis in a multi-criteria decision making analysis to evaluate the optimal mine waste disposal alternative...|$|R

Samples from different phases of <b>water</b> treatment (<b>decanted,</b> filtered and chlorinated) were compared with not treated samples. Coliphages quantification was made by Simple Layer and Membrane Filter methods. Most Probable Number (NMP) and Membrane Filter methods were used to assessment of Total Coliforms, Coliforms Thermotolerants and Heterotrophic Bacteria. The standard strain of E. coli C ATCC 13706 was used as coliphages host. The averages of quantified coliphages were of 2267, 25 UFP/ 100 mL in samples with out treatment; 2, 11, 2, 04 and 1, 07 UFP/ 100 mL in the <b>water</b> samples from <b>decanted,</b> filtered and chlorinated treatment respectively. Total Coliforms and Coliforms Thermotolerants were not detected in samples of chlorinated water. The correlation between coliphages and Total Coliforms in samples of <b>decanted</b> and filtered <b>water</b> (r = 0, 3793 and r = 0, 3629 respectively) were significant (p 0, 05). Correlations between coliphages and the Coliforms Thermotolerants were significant with water samples from treatment decanted, filtered and chlorinated (r = 0, 7129; 0, 5326 and 0, 4612, p 99, 99 % for the CT and CTT...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the initial}} {{constraints}} of any dredging project is deciding where to place dredged material. When placed upland, materials can be used beneficially, as beach nourishment or for habitat restoration, or can be placed in an upland confined disposal facility (CDF). Several times the solids volume in water is required to fluidized and hydraulically pump the materials. Once in the CDF, materials settle out of suspension, with clarified <b>water</b> <b>decanted.</b> This paper describes in general a current weir design used by the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) and illustrates the innovations of the new Jacksonville District standard weir. The new outfall structure is safer, easier to construct, and has inherent environmental protection features. It also has a longer life cycle and lower lifecycle cost than traditional structures. This paper also discusses a new composite weir system {{that is in the}} patent and construction phase. These new corrosion-resistant systems have the capability of revolutionizing and standardizing water control structures due to basic changes in material selection and operational controls. The construction, management, and maintenance of weir systems are a significant cost incurred by USACE navigation projects; improved systems are available that can reduce maintenance costs while improving the safety of personnel who operate them...|$|R
40|$|M. Sc. Water is {{essential}} to life on our planet (Miller, 1999) because no living organism can survive without it (Kupchella & Hyland, 1993). Thus there is a demand for clean, unpolluted water to be in substantial supply. There is growing awareness worldwide of the environmental legacy of coal mining activities that have been undertaken with little {{concern for the environment}} (EMCBC, 2001). Coal mining by its nature consumes, diverts and can seriously pollute water resources (Miller, 1999). Acid mine drainage is a major problem on coalmines throughout the world (Kupchella & Hyland, 1993), and South Witbank Colliery, the main focus of this study, is no exception. Various studies that have been undertaken at South Witbank Colliery have shown that the <b>water</b> <b>decanting</b> from the mine is highly acidic (pH 2 – pH 4), and as such cannot be released into the natural watercourse (streams). Some form of water treatment to nullify or neutralise the acid levels of the mine water is necessary. Currently a temporary liming plant is being utilised to treat the water and to reduce its acidity levels to between pH 5. 0 – pH 9. 5, however, this plant is seen as a limited treatment option as it does not guarantee that the acidic nature of the water will be sufficiently nullified. This study endeavours to identify and analyse a variety of permanent, long-term water treatment methods relevant to acid mine water mitigation at South Witbank Colliery. Four long-term water treatment methods, namely artificial wetlands, anoxic limestone drains, transfer of water to a water treatment plant, and construction of a permanent liming facility at South Witbank Colliery, were identified and discussed. Artificial wetland technology has not been proven for treatment on such variable pollutant loads as present in the South Witbank Colliery mine <b>water</b> <b>decant.</b> A constraint to this technology also lies in its necessity for large surface area requirements, which is restricted due to site subsidence and sinkhole formation (as a result of shallow mining). This technology is also known to increase water evaporation rates, which may result in additional water removal from an already stressed resource. The anoxic limestone drain water treatment technology is considered unsuitable for the study area, ultimately due to it having more a pre-treatment functionality than a total treatment one. It is also limited due to its ability to address only certain water quality variables. If considered for use in a partnership with other acid mine drainage water treatment technologies, its use might be more viable than when considered as a stand-alone treatment technology. Transferring of the acid mine drainage <b>water</b> <b>decant</b> from South Witbank Colliery to a water treatment plant is a feasible option. The Brugspruit Water Pollution Control Works, operated by the Department of Water Affairs and Forestry, is the most likely option. The water treatment would become the responsibility of DWAF, thereby ensuring that the treated water is compliant with specified water quality standards and requirements. The attractiveness of this option is that it minimizes the short and long term water management requirements for South Witbank Colliery, but is ultimately dependant on a formal contract being negotiated between the relevant parties. Construction of a permanent liming facility at South Witbank Colliery is possible and, in comparison to the current temporary liming plant, is likely to treat the water adequately so as to comply with specified water quality standards and requirements. A permanent facility would allow for more water to be treated than is currently possible at the temporary liming plant. Due to this option being based on proven technology increases its feasibility in terms of use at South Witbank Colliery. Given that water is a scarce resource in South Africa, the implementation of these water treatment options is dependent on the acceptability of each option by the Department of Water Affairs and Forestry. Of the four treatment options identified the latter two, namely transfer of water to a water treatment facility and construction of a permanent liming plant, are considered to be the most suitable solutions for the treatment of acid mine drainage at South Witbank Colliery...|$|R
40|$|Inland salt lakes of {{the arid}} and {{semi-arid}} zones of Western Australia are unique systems. An unpredictable rainfall pattern and a transient water regime ensure these lakes remain dry {{for much of}} the year. Lake Yindarlgooda in the Eastern Goldfields of Western Australia is a typical inland salt lake that has been subjected to additional stresses. This thesis is the outcome of investigations conducted on the lake from 2001 to 2003. Emphasis is on the limnology and biota of the lake, including an adjacent wetland, and impacts on the aquatic ecosystems caused predominantly by mining. Lake Yindarlgooda is a large, shallow hypersaline lake situated on the Yindarlgooda Palaeoriver. It is sodium chloride dominated and has naturally high background levels of nickel. Sites impacted by the leaching of hypersaline <b>decant</b> <b>water</b> from a leach residue storage facility (LRSF) were differentiated from control sites using multivariate statistics. Salinity was found to be a major determinant {{in the structure of the}} biological communities in the lake systems. Different biotic communities with low taxonomic diversity were recorded in Lake Yindarlgooda and Swan Refuge, a nearby hyposaline clay pan. The benthic microbial communities were dominated by halotolerant diatoms, notably Amphora coffeaeformis, Navicula incertata and Hantzschia baltica. Variation in the diatom assemblages between the playa sites and the clay pan were noted, influenced by habitat type and salinity. Within Lake Yindarlgooda, the diatom assemblages in the control and impact sites were found to be similar. A narrow salinity spectrum dictated the taxa present. Many of the benthic diatoms collected during the dry phase were encysted, having entered dormancy. The invertebrate fauna in Lake Yindarlgooda and Swan Refuge belonged to the Crustacea. A larger percentage of hyposaline invertebrate taxa were recorded from Swan Refuge, while those in Lake Yindarlgooda were typically halotolerant species. The Ostracoda showed the greatest diversity and their abundance was higher in the southern control sites while the Anostracan, Parartemia sp., dominated the northern impact sites of the playa. The riparian zone of Lake Yindarlgooda supported a diverse plant community, dominated by the Chenopodiaceae. The marginal vegetation communities along the shores of Lake Yindarlgooda were found to be similar, indicating habitat homeogeneity. Within the riparian zone both biological and physical soil crusts occupied large areas not inhabited by vascular plants. The biological soil crust identified was composed of an association between the filamentous cyanobacterium Microcoleus sp. and a moss species (Musci). Both biological and physical soil crusts were found to have functional roles in stabilising the surrounding low dunes. The soil crusts in the northern control sites were badly degraded as a result of trampling by livestock, while those in the southern control sites were protected and were intact. Only one Parartemia species was found to inhabit Lake Yindarlgooda, Parartemia n. sp. d. It was collected in salinities ranging from 50 to 140 g L- 1. The population appeared to be oviparous, recruitment mostly from resting eggs. The male to female ratios varied between sites, as did the number of juveniles compared to the adults. The northern impact sites had a more mature Parartemia population than the southern control sites and appeared to have undergone a second recruitment. Examination of the surface sediment found a well established Parartemia “egg bank” in the northern impact sites with egg numbers much higher than in the southern control sites. The ultrastructure of the Parartemia resting egg was identical to that of Artemia. Differences in the external features and internal structure of the resting egg of Parartemia n sp. d and Parartemia n. sp g from Lake Miranda, another saline lake, were identified. This study showed morphological variation of the egg within Parartemia, a finding not previously recorded. Rehydration trials on the Parartemia egg bank indicated that the increase in sediment salinity from the LRSF had a negative effect on the hatching of the resting eggs. In salinities above 60 mS cm- 1 hatching was less successful. The conditions provided in the trials were similar to those in Lake Yindarlgooda. The hatching technique was repeated on sediment from Lake Miranda with similar results. These trials were considered a valuable monitoring tool in the assessment of impacts on the biota of temporary lakes in the absence of water. This study demonstrated that in the absence of water the egg and spore/seed bank can be used as a proxy for monitoring temporary lakes. It was also found to be valuable in understanding the distribution and diversity of the biotic communities in Lake Yindarlgooda. This study provides the first integrated reference information on a Western Australian inland salt lake against which any future impact may be assessed...|$|R
40|$|Tailings {{management}} is typically constrained by many {{factors that are}} taken as given. These include the tailings production rate that must be accommodated, the desire to deliver the tailings cheaply and easily as a slurry using centrifugal pumps, and a tailings footprint limited {{by the desire to}} minimise capital costs leading to a rapid tailings rate of rise and a low settled density. Other constraints include wall raises being delayed due to limited capital, inadequate tailings water and rainfall run-off management, and the net present value (NPV) approach to capital expenditure that puts off expenditure at the expense of performance. All of these constraints result in the tailings occupying much more volume than is necessary, being difficult to rehabilitate, and not being capable of supporting a beneficial post-mining land use or function. Ultimately, such constrained tailings storage facilities will assume very large dimensions, but each will typically be developed as a series of smaller storages that are filled rapidly and added to progressively. The optimal stage to efficiently recover process water is in the process plant, but this is limited by the desire to use centrifugal pumps rather than the more costly positive displacement pumps, which also require greater management of tailings deposition. Process water can also be recovered from the tailings storage facility (TSF) <b>decant.</b> Tailings <b>water</b> that is not recovered from the plant or the decant will be lost to entrainment within the tailings, seepage to the foundation or through the wall, or evaporation. However, tailings water is not always suitable for reuse in the plant, particularly when it becomes contaminated by the processing, and it may simply be stored on the TSF. This will exacerbate the seepage of contaminated water to the environment, and will limit the densification of the tailings that would otherwise occur due to desiccation of the tailings on exposure. If a larger tailings footprint were developed early, cycling of tailings deposition in thin lifts between a number of cells could occur, maintaining the dormant cells dry to enhance desiccation and densification, and ultimate rehabilitation. The end result would be a much reduced stored volume of tailings, the potential for upstream raising, and ease of rehabilitation to a high level. The higher initial capital cost would be overtaken by reduced ongoing capital, operating and closure costs...|$|R
40|$|Even though mining-related uranium {{pollution}} in the Wonderfonteinspruit (WFS) has been an ongoing concern since the mid 1960 s, media attention recently increased considerably focussing on pollution-related health risks that unsettle the general public. In view of recent findings that uranium (U) might be more toxic than previously thought such concerns need to be addressed. This even more so as South Africa {{has embarked on a}} nuclear expansion program aimed, amongst others, at extending mining and processing of uranium (U). This paper explores the impacts mining over the past decade had on U-pollution of water resources in the WFS catchment. The analysis is mainly based on close to 3400, mostly unpublished, values on U-concentrations of water samples gathered between 1997 and 2008. Results indicate that U-levels in water resources of the whole catchment increased markedly since 1997 even though U-loads emitted by some large gold mines in the Far West Rand were reduced. This apparent contradiction is explained by the contribution of highly polluted <b>water</b> <b>decanting</b> from the flooded mine void in the West Rand. Over the reference period, an average of some 3, 5 t of dissolved U have been released into the fluvial system from monitored discharge points alone. However, since WFS dries up well before it joins the Mooi River this U-load does not usually impact on the water supply system of downstream Potchefstroom directly. It may, however, indirectly reach Potchefstroom since much of the water from the WFS recharges the underlying karst aquifer of the Boskop Turffontein Compartment (BTC...|$|R
40|$|Solar Disinfection {{of water}} (SODIS) is a {{treatment}} method that traditionally exposes low turbidity water filled in clear bottles to direct sunlight up to 6 h. Typically, water should have turbidity lower than 30 NTU before solar exposure; however turbidities of water sources in communities vary and can reach higher than 200 NTU. In {{order to reduce}} turbidity, flocculating agents like Moringa oleifera (Moringa) may be used. In this study we assess the efficacy of Moringa to clear turbid water as a pretreatment for SODIS. We initially evaluate two preparations– powdered seeds and an aqueous filtrate of the seeds, to determine if these can benefit SODIS in turbid, E. coli contaminated water (Experiment 1). We show that powdered Moringa seeds reduce turbidity best and that SODIS treatment of highly turbid water was effective regardless of reduced turbidity. Overnight, however; a bio-active sludge layer formed. We then determined if 24 h Moringa pretreatment and <b>decanting</b> can maintain <b>water</b> quality {{over an extended period}} (Experiment 2). After 24 h Moringa treatment showed a 2. 1 log reduction in E. coli, increasing following SODIS (6 -log) E. coli without nightly recovery or sludge formation. Untreated turbid controls showed SODIS disinfection after 6 h direct sunlight; however, nightly regrowth and sludge layer formation occurred by 48 h. These results suggest that SODIS is capable of inactivating bacteria in highly turbid water at 6 h; however, active biofilm sludge layers formed by 48 h. We conclude that, for longer term water storage, we find a combination of Moringa seed powder pretreatment prior to SODIS to be optimal. PUBLISHEDpeer-reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Uranium (U) {{pollution}} {{of the surface}} water and groundwater of the Wonderfonteinspruit (WFS) catchment caused by gold mining over {{more than a century}} has been an ongoing concern for several decades. Triggered by a recent increase in media attention, political pressure on governmental authorities has mounted to assess the associated health risks and implement appropriate mitigation measures. However, owing to the complexity of the catchment arising from the presence of a mul-titude of dischargers, a complex karst hydrology and large-scale modifications thereof by deep-level gold mining, most attempts to address the issue to date have been limited to uncoordinated ad hoc studies generally suffering from a lack of temporal and spatial representivity of the underlying data. Part 2 of a series of 2 papers aimed at quantifying the extent of mining-related U pollution in the WFS catchment, this paper addresses the {{pollution of}} surface water, groundwater, as well as mine effluent. Based on close to 3 400 measured U concentrations (mostly unpublished) of water samples gathered between 1997 and 2008, an overview of U levels and associated loads in the WFS catchment is provided. Results indicate that U levels in water resources of the whole catchment have increased markedly, even though U loads emitted by some large gold mines in the Far West Rand have been significantly reduced. A major contributing factor is highly polluted <b>water</b> <b>decanting</b> from the flooded mine void in the West Rand, which was diverted to the WFS. Over the reference period, an aver-age of some 3. 5 t of dissolved U has been released into the fluvial system from monitored discharge points alone. However...|$|R
