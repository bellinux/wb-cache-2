5|$|News of Cross Days first {{surfaced}} in the December 2008 issue of Tech Gian, a magazine published by Enterbrain, on October 21, showing first ever screenshots, reporting on the story and characters, and mentioning that Cross <b>Days</b> <b>would</b> contain 3D animation with a meticulously reworked plot and male protagonist. Also in October, ASCII Media Works and Gakken published articles about the game in their respective issues of Dengeki G's Magazine, Dengeki Hime and Megami Magazine.|$|E

The Liverpool website records that, {{during the summer of}} 1933 when he returned to Glenbuck after completing his first season as a professional, he decided to develop his throw-in skills. He was an early exponent of the long throw-in and, according to the site, he practiced by throwing balls over a row of houses and the small boys of the village helped by fetching them back for him.|$|E
5|$|The {{bulk of the}} 1st Army {{were able}} to cross the Danube and began to prepare defences. By the evening of 10 April, the 1st Army was ordered to {{withdraw}} from this line and form a defensive line behind the Sava from Debrc to the confluence with the Vrbas river, for which one or two <b>days</b> <b>would</b> be needed. On the night of 10/11 April, the whole 2nd Army Group continued its withdrawal, but units of the 2nd Army on the left flank of the 1st Army that included significant numbers of Croats began to dissolve due to the fifth column activities of the fascist Ustaše and their sympathisers.|$|E

5|$|Although zduhaći (plural) {{could be}} women and children, most were adult men. Their supernatural power {{was thought to}} be inborn. In many regions it was {{regarded}} that the zduhaći were born with a caul—white or red, depending on the regional belief. The mother would dry the caul and sew into a piece of garment always worn by the child, such as a pouch attached under the child's armpit. In the clan of Kuči, eastern Montenegro, the mother would preserve the caul hiding it from all eyes, and hand it to her son when he grew up. The caul was supposed to protect him when he flew as a zduhać. If the caul was destroyed, the child's supernatural power would be lost. A birthmark of a zduhać in Herzegovina could be a tuft of hair growing on his shoulder or upper arm. In Montenegrin Littoral, the caul played no role in the birth of zduhaći, who were rather born on certain Fridays at a set hour. There was also a belief in Herzegovina that male children who were conceived on the eves of great feast <b>days</b> <b>would</b> become zduhaći.|$|E
5|$|<b>Days</b> <b>would</b> be {{structured}} so that activities would be planned throughout, with occupational therapy carrying on into evenings and at weekends. A typical day would include breakfast then flower arranging until 10:30, {{followed by an}} hour in the occupation room for therapy. After their work, the patients would go for a walk or join in community singing until 2pm. Between 2pm and 8pm there would be more time in the occupation room, a period of rest and time in the garden. At 8 pm there would be community games and country dancing. Casson believed it was important to keep the therapy room separate {{from the rest of the}} department, as it was specialised knowledge. She also insisted that certain activities, such as knitting, were not used as it was not sufficient distraction from the patient's fantasy system. Some concern existed that patients would not accept being put to work, but of her 100 patients in 1931, only six refused the therapy. A member (and later fellow) of the British Homeopathy Society, Casson also included homeopathic treatments in her programme for the patients.|$|E
5|$|Einsteinium is a soft, silvery, {{paramagnetic}} metal. Its {{chemistry is}} typical of the late actinides, with a preponderance of the +3 oxidation state; the +2 oxidation state is also accessible, especially in solids. The high radioactivity of einsteinium-253 produces a visible glow and rapidly damages its crystalline metal lattice, with released heat of about 1000 watts per gram. Difficulty in studying its properties is due to einsteinium-253's decay to berkelium-249 and then californium-249 {{at a rate of about}} 3% per day. The isotope of einsteinium with the longest half-life, einsteinium-252 (half-life 471.7 <b>days)</b> <b>would</b> be more suitable for investigation of physical properties, but it has proven far more difficult to produce and is available only in minute quantities, and not in bulk. Einsteinium is the element with the highest atomic number which has been observed in macroscopic quantities in its pure form, and this was the common short-lived isotope einsteinium-253.|$|E

5|$|Eliza Farnham's 1856 {{account of}} the Donner Party was based largely on an {{interview}} with Margaret Breen. Her version details the ordeals of the Graves and Breen families after James Reed and the second relief left them in the snow pit. According to Farnham, seven-year-old Mary Donner suggested to the others that they should eat Isaac Donner, Franklin Graves, Jr., and Elizabeth Graves, because the Donners had already begun eating the others at Alder Creek, including Mary's father Jacob. Margaret Breen insisted {{that she and her}} family did not cannibalize the dead, but Kristin Johnson, Ethan Rarick, and Joseph Kingwhose account is sympathetic to the Breen familydo not consider it credible that the Breens, who had been without food for nine <b>days,</b> <b>would</b> have been able to survive without eating human flesh. King suggests Farnham included this into her account independently of Margaret Breen.|$|E
5|$|Expressions {{of sympathy}} and {{solidarity}} from the European film community manifested in renewed assurances of continued {{support from the}} production's German partners, ARTE, and the French National Film Centre (whose support was conditional on the film having 51% of its dialogue in French). New French financing was secured from production company Mezzanine Film, and in Hungary, the Hungarian Motion Picture Foundation (MMKA) and the Minister of Culture pledged to back the production if a guarantee could {{be made that the}} film would be finished safely. A compromise filming schedule was negotiated whereby a quarter of the shoot would take place in Eastern Europe rather than Corsica and fewer shooting <b>days</b> <b>would</b> be allotted. This allowed the original €5 million budget to be reduced by €700,000 to the amount available. With the funding promises secured and a revised shooting schedule, the film's producers forged a new co-production contract in July 2005.|$|E
5|$|School Days was 0verflow's tenth game to develop. News of School Days first {{surfaced}} on October 5, 2004 when 0verflow {{posted a}} link to the game's then-live website and development log on their official site. In the blog, 0verflow revealed that School Days had been in pre-production for roughly two years and would be a fully animated game. Updates {{on the development of the}} game were scheduled for Tuesdays and Fridays, and the company encouraged fans to attend Dream Party 2004, an upcoming anime convention at Tokyo Big Sight in Ariake, on October 11, where it would make its first public showcase of the game and characters. A follow-up of the venue was made on October 15. Toward the end of the month on October 26, 0verflow posted that new information about School <b>Days</b> <b>would</b> be circulated in the November issue of Tech Gian, an adult magazine published by Enterbrain.|$|E

5|$|The 2nd Army {{was able}} to {{evacuate}} Baranja and organised a defence of the left flank of the 2nd Army Group, now threatened by the 8th Panzer Division, but Croat reservists began to desert their units due to the fifth column activities of the fascist Ustaše and their sympathisers. This significantly reducing the combat power of the 2nd Army. By the evening of 10 April, the 2nd Army Group was ordered to withdraw from this line and form a defensive line behind the Sava, from Debrc to the confluence with the Vrbas river, for which one or two <b>days</b> <b>would</b> be needed.

25|$|Wreden {{reported}} {{that more than}} 100,000 sales were made within {{the first three days}} of being available; this was far more revenue than he was expecting, considering that sales from these three <b>days</b> <b>would</b> be enough to allow him to live comfortably and become a full-time developer for the next five years.

25|$|The first 20 <b>days</b> <b>would</b> be {{paid for}} in full by Medicare with the {{remaining}} 80 days requiring a co-payment of $161 per day as of 2016.

If a beneficiary uses some portion of their Part A benefit and then goes at least 60 days without receiving facility-based skilled services, the 90-day hospital clock and 100-day nursing home clock are reset and the person qualifies for new benefit periods.|$|E
