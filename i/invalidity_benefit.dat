40|$|Disablement {{pensions}} (<b>Invalidity</b> <b>benefits)</b> - Resumé As I {{am interested}} in the situation of disabled people {{and the ability of}} the community to take care properly of these needy people I decided to write a thesis on the subject of disablement pensions (or <b>invalidity</b> <b>benefits).</b> The aim of this thesis was to give a reader an overview of how different countries regulate the conditions under which <b>invalidity</b> <b>benefits</b> are provided. At the same time I would like to describe in detail and evaluate above named national legislations in the same structure, if possible. The first chapter deals with historical aspects. After the origins of social security are mentioned, I already focus on the historical development of invalidity benefits' legislation in european and czech context. The next chapter is an analysis of <b>invalidity</b> <b>benefits</b> at the international level. Especially the achievements of the International Labour Organization, the Council of Europe and the European Union in the field of disablement pensions are highlighted. It is completed by a brief description of bilateral agreements on social security.

40|$|International audienceThe French {{pattern of}} early {{transitions}} out of employment is basically {{explained by the}} low age at "normal" retirement and by the importance of transitions through unemployment insurance and early-retirement schemes before access to normal retirement. These routes have exempted French workers from massively relying on disability motives for early exits, contrarily to the situation that prevails in some other countries where normal ages are high, unemployment benefits low and early-retirement schemes almost non-existent. Yet the role of disability remains interesting to examine in the French case, at least for prospective reasons {{in a context of}} decreasing generosity of other programs. The study of the past reforms of the pension system underlines that disability routes have often acted as a substitute to other retirement routes. Changes in the claiming of <b>invalidity</b> <b>benefits</b> seem to match changes in pension schemes or controls more than changes in such health indicators as the mortality rates. However, our results suggest that increases in average health levels {{over the past two decades}} have come along with increased disparities. In that context, less generous pensions may induce an increase in the claiming of <b>invalidity</b> <b>benefits</b> partly because of substitution effects, but also because the share of people with poor health increases...|$|R

40|$|Social {{security}} expenditure totalled ATS 745 {{billion in}} 1998, the 2. 8 percent growth of nominal expenditure being 0. 7 percent below nominal GDP growth. The social expenditure ratio, i. e., {{the share of}} social expenditure in GDP, stood at 28. 5 percent in 1998, thus continuing its downward trend for the fourth consecutive year. The trend is expected to remain unchanged in 1999, as the cyclical upswing results in employment growth and a reduction of unemployment. At the same time, the budget consolidation measures (austerity budgets) are reinforcing this development. Measured by its social expenditure ratio, Austria ranks seventh in Europe. The ratios are higher in the Nordic countries as well as France and Germany. With a social expenditure ratio of 28. 7 percent, Austria was 0. 5 percentage point below the EU average in 1997. However, the structure of social security spending in Austria differs greatly from the European average. Expenditure for old-age pensions and survivor benefits is 3. 3 percentage points above the EU average and family benefits exceed {{the average of the}} fifteen member states by 1. 9 percentage points. The way Austrian social security is financed also differs from the EU average: contributions by public and private employers are 1 percentage point below the average, while employee contributions to social security are 3. 6 percentage points above the EU average; the share of tax money flowing into social security exceeds the average by 1. 6 percentage points. Old-age benefits (38. 2 percent for old-age pensions and 10. 3 percent for survivor benefits) account for the largest share of social benefits, followed by health care expenditure (25. 8 percent) and family benefits (10. 2 percent). <b>Invalidity</b> <b>benefits</b> are the fourth largest expenditure item (8. 6 percent), while unemployment benefits account for no more than 5. 6 percent of all social benefit payments. The shares of old-age pensions and <b>invalidity</b> <b>benefits</b> increased between 1997 and 1998. Spending rose most strongly (+ 10. 8 percent) in the field of <b>invalidity</b> <b>benefits</b> (including early retirement for reasons of partial invalidity) as well as early retirement after long-term insurance coverage (+ 4. 9 percent) and unemployment benefits (+ 4. 1 percent). Changes in legislation resulted in a steep decline of spending for parental leave (– 21. 5 percent) and child-birth benefits (– 75. 4 percent), although family benefit expenditure as a whole increased by 1. 6 percent.

40|$|Calculated on {{the basis}} of the European System of Integrated Social Protection Statistics (ESSPROS), social {{expenditures}} (including social security, health and old-age pensions) in Austria rose by 0. 2 percent in 1997. The ratio of social expenditures to GDP, on the other hand, fell from 29. 6 percent in 1996 to 28. 8 percent in 1997. After levelling off in 1995, the ratio actually declined in the wake of the first and second austerity packages. In 1997, it was lower for the second consecutive year, and the trend appears to have continued in 1998 as a consequence of the economic upswing, which was, however, accompanied by an ongoing rise in the unemployment rate. Ever since 1995, real social expenditures have been growing at a lesser rate than the GDP. Social expenditures in 1997 concentrated on four major items: retirement benefits (social security pensions including survivors' pensions, 48. 4 percent), health care (25. 8 percent), family- or child-related benefits (10. 5 percent) and <b>invalidity</b> <b>benefits</b> (8. 3 percent). Above-average growth rates were registered for <b>invalidity</b> <b>benefits</b> granted to persons of working age and unemployment benefits, although the latter were declining from 1996 to 1997. Child-related expenditures showed substantial fluctuations (growth until 1995, cuts afterwards). As a proportion of GDP, social expenditures in Austria is slightly above the EU- 15 average. But the structural composition of social outlays differs markedly from the EU average: in Austria retirement benefits (including survivors' pensions) are higher by 3. 8 percentage points, and child-related benefits by 2. 5 percentage points, than the EU average, whereas expenditures on unemployment benefits is 2. 8 percentage points below the European average.

40|$|International {{comparisons}} of sickness absence rates {{are difficult to}} make because of different national social security arrangements or recording procedures. Therefore a cross national study of sickness absence in Belgium, West Germany, and the Netherlands focused firstly on "contextual" aspects of sickness absence such as work incapacity benefit schemes, job security regulations, {{and the role of}} occupational physicians. Substantial differences were observed in regulations, local definitions, and available data. Those differences provide hypotheses for possibly divergent absence levels as well. For instance, Belgium shows the most diversified control procedures, the lowest level of sickness benefits, and the most rigid qualifying criteria for <b>invalidity</b> <b>benefits.</b> Sickness absence data were obtained from companies of four different clusters, each consisting of a comparable Belgian, German, and Dutch organisation. Conceptual, administrative, and statistical sources of bias were accounted for by selecting companies which resemble each other as to their product, production process, size, and geographical location: by using standardised definitions, absence data, and indices (observation period 1 January 1980 to 1 January 1982); and by measuring population variables to eliminate obvious explanations in terms of workforce composition. Controlled comparisons in these multiple clusters showed considerable and consistent differences in sickness absence rates. Whereas Belgian employees had 20. 3 days of sickness absence (standardised for sex, age, and occupation) a year, German and Dutch employees had 28. 5 and 39. 1 days off a year respectively.

Countries did not differ in the numbers of clients seen per day or the gender balance of clients. Mean age of clients was highest in Scotland (44 years) and lowest in Northern Ireland (39 years). A higher proportion of clients seen in Northern Ireland were friends or relatives of problem drinkers seeking help than in the other countries. English agencies reported much larger proportions of 'Irish' clients than those in Scotland. Northern Irish agencies showed the highest proportion of married clients and also the lowest proportion of those divorced, separated or widowed, the highest proportion of whom was found in Scotland. The country recording the highest proportion of clients in insecure accommodation was England. Northern Irish agencies had the highest proportion of clients in employment and the lowest proportion on sickness or <b>invalidity</b> <b>benefits.</b> The highest proportion of professional staff delivering treatment on census day was recorded in Northern Ireland. Clients in Northern Ireland were less likely to complain about physical health consequences of drinking and more likely to complain about psychological consequences.

Known drug use was higher in agencies in Northern Ireland than in England and Scotland. Clients seen by agencies in Northern Ireland appear to form a distinct group from those seen in Scotland and England.

40|$|The {{prevention}} of age discrimination in Sweden {{did not have}} any solvent grounds until directive 2000 / 78 /EG was implemented into Swedish law. Today age discrimination has been banned for just over two years. This ground of discrimination has, compared to other existing grounds of discrimination in Swedish law, a lot more opportunities to make exceptions from. Given the fact that the exemption rules are vague, it is difficult to determine whether the protection against age discrimination is in fact a protection at all. The purpose of this essay is to describe what the law regarding age discrimination means. Is the protection against age discrimination appropriate or are the prohibitions against age discrimination deficient? Both Swedish and EU-law applies in this essay, since the Swedish Discrimination Act has been influenced by EU-law. From the prohibition of age discrimination there are a few exemptions which are permissible under Swedish and EU-law. There are three possibilities to make exemptions to the age discrimination ban in Swedish law, one of which can be made in individual contracts and collective agreements as regards the right to pension- survivor - or <b>invalidity</b> <b>benefits.</b> The other two exemptions are more general and vague and therefore do not provide much guidance. Consequently, the main {{question is whether or not}} the Swedish Discrimination Act provides a protection with no actual effect, since the preparatory works mention situations where exceptions to the prohibition of age discrimination are considered to be permitted. In 2001 a mandatory rule came into force in the Employment Protection Act (LAS) which gave employees the right, to remain in their post until the month in which he or she reaches the age of 67. The issue however occurs after the employer has reached this age and whether or not this rule constitutes a direct discrimination by law...|$|R
40|$|From data {{provided}} by a national census of treatment for alcohol problems in 1996, this paper reports findings on differences between types of treatment agencies in England and Wales. The overall response rate was 44 % but {{no significant differences were}} found between responding and non-responding agencies in size and composition of staff. The highest mean number of clients per day was seen in NHS trust services and charitable organizations. Private (for profit) agencies showed both the highest mean age of clients and the highest proportion of men among agency types, while NHS trusts saw the highest proportion of women. Charities and voluntary organizations reported higher than average proportions of clients living in insecure accommodation. Private (for profit) agencies showed both the lowest proportion of unemployed clients and the highest proportion of those on sickness or <b>invalidity</b> <b>benefits.</b> Seventy-three per cent of clients attending NHS trust services were seen by nurses, medical or non-medical professionals; only 8 % of clients attending private (for profit) agencies were seen by these professional groups. Worries about physical health were far more common among clients attending private (for profit) agencies and legal/financial problems occurred much more often among those attending voluntary/statutory partnerships. The highest proportion of clients in residential treatment was shown in private (for profit) agencies and the lowest in voluntary/statutory partnerships and NHS trusts. Nearly all (90 %) treatment carried out by voluntary/statutory partnerships was in the form of 'counselling', while approximately half the clients seen by charities and independent (non-profit) organizations were in day or residential treatment. While in the overall sample, the mean percentage of clients also attending Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) was 9 %, this rose to 23 % of clients attending independent (non-profit) agencies. The highest proportions of clients with reported illicit drug use was in voluntary/statutory partnerships and the lowest in independent (non-profit) agencies. This paper provides a 'snapshot' of the variation in treatment services for alcohol problems in England and Wales, which can be used to detect trends in treatment provision in the future...|$|R

40|$|After {{shooting}} {{up in the}} early 1990 s, due to additional benefits such as {{the second year of}} parental leave, tax credits for children and the long-term care benefit, and leveling off at 29. 7 percent in 1994 and 1995, the social expenditure/GDP ratio began to shrink at last, to 29. 5 percent, in 1996, thanks to the effect of the first austerity package and {{in the face of a}} weakening economy and growing unemployment. As defined by the European System of Integrated Social Protection Statistics (ESSPROS), social outlays in Austria totaled ATS 714 billion in 1996, equivalent to 29. 5 percent of its gross domestic product, and down from 29. 7 percent in 1994 and 1995 in spite of the slump and high unemployment rates. During the 1980 s, changes in the social expenditure/GDP ratio reflected mainly cyclical variations: it rose throughout the period of sluggish growth until 1987, but fell back below the 1980 level when the economy recovered. Structural grounds, i. e., the introduction and improvement of benefit levels, such as the second year of parental leave, improved eligibility criteria for women's pensions, tax credits for children and the long-term care benefit, caused the social expenditure/GDP ratio to shoot up again in 1991 to 1994. In spite of the subsequent cyclical downswing, the ratio leveled off in 1995 and actually declined in 1996 as a consequence of the first austerity package. In view of the economic upswing and ongoing efforts at further consolidation, the trend is likely to continue in 1997 and 1998. In 1991 to 1996, social spending grew by altogether 36. 5 percent. Above-average growth rates were registered for unemployment benefits (+ 61. 5 percent), <b>invalidity</b> <b>benefits</b> (+ 55. 5 percent) and family benefits (+ 43. 4 percent). The scope of social expenditures in Austria is similar to that of other European countries of comparable economic and social structures. As a proportion of GDP, Austria's 1995 ratio was slightly above the EU average of 28. 4 percent which was depressed by the meager level of social spending in the southern European countries. The structural composition of social outlays in Austria differs markedly from the EU average insofar as old age pensions claim a much larger share (Austria 48 percent, EU 44 percent) whereas the share of spending on unemployment (6 percent and 8 percent, respectively) and on health care and invalidity (33 percent versus 36 percent) are distinctly lower in Austria.

In fact, most of benefits are earnings related and entitlement is conditional upon a contribution record. Social security contributions are paid by both employers and employees. However, in France, {{there is also a}} non-contributory element, a Beveridgean component.

Since the late 1970 s, several kinds of minimum incomes or social minima have been set up to compensate for the failures of the Bismarckian sector (the social insurance system). There are at least eight different minimum incomes: minimum income for old people over sixty-five years, allowance for disabled adults, integration allowance, specific solidarity allowance, lone parent allowance, minimum income for disabled people (for those who have small <b>invalidity</b> insurance <b>benefits),</b> widowhood allowance, and mini...|$|R
40|$|Randomized {{response}} (RR) is {{a well-known}} method for measuring sensitive behavior. Yet this method is not often applied because: (i) of its lower efficiency and the resulting need for larger sample sizes which make applications of RR costly; (ii) despite its privacy-protection mechanism the RR design may not be followed by every respondent; and (iii) the incorrect belief that RR yields estimates only of aggregate-level behavior but that these estimates cannot be linked to individual-level covariates. This paper addresses the efficiency problem by applying item randomized-response (IRR) models {{for the analysis of}} multivariate RR data. In these models, a person parameter is estimated based on multiple measures of a sensitive behavior under study which allow for more powerful analyses of individual differences than available from univariate RR data. Response behavior that does not follow the RR design is approached by introducing mixture components in the IRR models with one component consisting of respondents who answer truthfully and another component consisting of respondents who do not provide truthful responses. An analysis of data from two large-scale Dutch surveys conducted among recipients of <b>invalidity</b> insurance <b>benefits</b> shows that the willingness of a respondent to answer truthfully is related to the educational level of the respondents and the perceived clarity of the instructions.

40|$|This study {{occupies}} {{itself with}} legal aspects of invalidity from youth. It represents {{an issue that}} is very significant from the social point of view although not regulated as single problem by law. However the whole theme infiltrates to another specific fields: social insurance, assessment medicine, psychology, juristic section, medicinal issue, ethics, upbringing and special pedagogy in a broad meaning. Current Czech law regulation of theme concerning benefits for persons with long-term unfavorable health state is based on concept of full and partial <b>invalidity</b> pension as <b>benefits</b> within pension insurance scheme and pension increase for incapacity (helplessness). Generally full and partial <b>invalidity</b> pension <b>benefits</b> originate from reduction of gainful activity and reaching of relevant time period of pension insurance. According to a survey it is evident that number of awarded full and partial invalidity pensions has increased in Jihočeský" region. Respecting diagnostic flags structure the greatest occurrence of full invalidity pensions from youth has been recorded in group of intermediate cephalonia. Solving of social insurance of the elderly is planned under the pension reform at the present. The main goal of invalidity pension is permission to live {{as close as possible to}} normal state thus to face up to a handicap and to secure appropriate family, social and work life. In fine we could deduce that there should be confirmation of obligatory conversion of full invalidity pension to old-age pension when reaching retirement age within Czech pension reform. In my study I have focused on some factors decisive for occurrence of full or partial invalidity. It represents socially significant problems in broad range of relations that establish or could establish. Long-term loss or reduction of ability to work have negative impact not only on individuals but also affect social status of their families and thus negatively influence the whole society. Exclusion from work process traumatizes young people. Pension benefits provided to the disabled from youth are not deduced from tolled premiums. That is the reason I think this should be solved out of the pension insurance system as well as pension increase for incapacity (helplessness). Costs on these benefits would be compensated by state budget within pension insurance system in the near future with perspective of transmission of these benefits to other social scheme. In this connection it is necessary to emphasize that mankind should be made sure that there is basic perception and crucial aim of social welfare in focusing on level and quality of life of individuals and their families not affected by unfavorable social or economic influences as well as their health state and well-being that will not be compounded by diseases and injuries. This fact will substantially affect the strategy of modern social policy...|$|R
40|$|Labor force {{participation}} of men over age 50 fell {{sharply in the}} UK between the early 1970 s and early 1990 s. Despite {{the fact that the}} state retirement pension does not become available to men until age 65, half of men aged 60 - 64 were economically inactive in the mid 1990 s. The main element of the state retirement pension is flat rate, and for most people is unaffected by any potential contributions made after age 60. Additional amounts of the earnings related component, SERPS, are earned as a result of extra contribu- tions. Overall the state retirement pension system offers no incentives for people to retire early. However, other benefits are available to people before the age of 65. Once the age of 60 is reached there is no availability for work test for receipt of means-tested benefits and there appears to be widespread use of <b>invalidity</b> and sickness <b>benefits</b> as a route into early retirement. Once these are accounted for a substantial incentive for early withdrawal from the labor market is apparent. The combination of this with the reduced demand for, and wages available to, low skilled labor can explain the reduced labor force participation that is observed. The state pension system, though, is complemented by extensive occupational pension coverage. For those in the occupational system the rules of their own scheme are likely to be an important element in their retirement decision. We show that the retirement behavior of those with and without occupational pensions is substantially different. Those without are more likely to withdraw from the labor market very early. A large share of those with occupational pensions retires from the age of 55 when relatively generous benefits are likely to become available. In many schemes there are incentives to retire before age 65...|$|R
40|$|The Social Security Scheme was {{launched}} in 1990, covering formal sector private employees for non-work related sickness, maternity and <b>invalidity</b> including cash <b>benefits</b> and funeral grants. The scheme is financed by tripartite contributions from government, employers and employees, each of 1. 5 % of payroll (total of 4. 5 %). The scheme decided to pay health care providers, whether public or private, on a flat rate capitation basis to cover both ambulatory and inpatient care. Registration of the insured with a contractor hospital was a necessary consequence of the chosen capitation payment system. The aim {{of this paper is}} to review the operation of the scheme, and to explore the implications of capitation payment and registration for utilisation levels and provider behaviour. A key weakness of the scheme's design is suggested to be the initial decision to give employers not employees the responsibility for choosing the registered hospitals. This was done for administrative reasons, but it contributed to low levels of use of the contractor hospitals. In addition, low levels of use were also probably the result of the potential for cream skimming, cost shifting from inpatient to ambulatory care and under-provision of patient care, though since monitoring mechanisms by the Social Security Office were weak, these effects are difficult to detect conclusively. Mechanisms to improve utilisation levels were gradually introduced, such as employee choice of registered hospitals and the formation of sub-contractor networks to improve access to care. A beneficial effect of the capitation payment system was that the Social Security Fund generated substantial reserves and expenditures on sickness benefits were well stabilised. The paper ends by recommending that future policy amendments should be guided by research and empirical findings and that tougher monitoring and enforcement of quality of care standards are required.
