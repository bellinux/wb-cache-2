2500|$|During the interval, Spofforth made an {{announcement}} to his team-mates in the dressing-room: [...] "This thing can be done.!" [...] In spite of being reduced to fifteen for two early on, England {{made a good}} start in its pursuit of a victory target of 85. The score rose to 51 for two, with Grace and Ulyett hitting out strongly. Spofforth changed ends, and Neville Cardus wrote thus of this move: [...] "Now I was behind his arm; <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>his</b> superb break-back. And he bowled mainly medium pace at this time. With each off-break <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>his</b> right hand, {{at the end of}} the swing over, finish near the left side, 'cutting' under the ball. Sometimes his arm went straight over and continued straight down in the follow-through – and then the batsmen had to tackle fierce topspin. There was the sense of the inimical in his aspect now. He seemed taller than he was half an hour ago, the right arm more sinuous. There was no excitement in him he was ... cold-blooded." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kirsten {{told police}} he went to Cornell’s room at 12:15a.m., but couldn't access the locked room. He then had a {{telephone}} conversation with Vicky Cornell. [...] "I told Vicky that they wouldn’t come {{open the door and}} she told me to kick it open. I did. Upon entry, I found the bedroom door locked. I called the hotel operator and told her that I needed security to open the bedroom door. They refused again, and I told them that I’m going to damage the hotel room and (they) need to send security, call 911 and call an ambulance. I kicked the bedroom door 6-7 times before it somehow popped open. I went inside and the bathroom door was partially opened and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>his</b> feet." [...] Kirsten told police in a signed statement. Kirsten said that Vicky {{was on the phone with}} him the whole time asking for updates, [...] "She told me that she called the front desk and they hung up on her. It was a female. She called back a couple minutes later and a male answered, saying that it was (the first) that he was hearing about the incident." [...] Kirsten said in his statement that he loosened the band around Cornell's neck then tried to resuscitate him by compressing his chest. Medical personnel arrived at 12:56 a.m and tried to resuscitate the singer with no success. Cornell was pronounced dead at 1:30a.m., an hour and 15 minutes after his bodyguard was first contacted by Cornell's wife. It's unknown how long it took the bodyguard to gain entry to the hotel room and find Cornell.|$|E
60|$|At {{the sound}} of his voice {{something}} seemed to come back to the face of the older man. He rose slowly to his feet. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>his</b> white fingers trembling, but <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>his</b> eyes suddenly fill with a new and stronger light.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that <b>his</b> {{breath was}} failing, and I bent low {{to catch his}} words.|$|R
25|$|<b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> <b>his</b> face, {{but he had}} a {{short neck}} and large head.|$|R
60|$|Rupert's {{surprise}} was now more natural, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that <b>his</b> interest--shame on our propensities for it!--was very natural, too.|$|R
60|$|In {{the rays}} of the lantern <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>his</b> perplexed face peering down.|$|E
60|$|Neither of us {{looked at}} each other; but <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>his</b> hand {{deliberately}} making bread pills.|$|E
60|$|If she {{had been}} a man Ray would have struck her. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>his</b> white teeth clenched {{fiercely}} together.|$|E
60|$|He {{spoke in}} a new, angry voice; but <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> <b>his</b> face, his back being to the light.|$|R
60|$|He was all {{interested}} attention, {{and waited for}} me to go on, though <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> in <b>his</b> eyes the certitude that my convictions had been shaken.|$|R
60|$|I had {{scarcely}} {{believed him}} capable {{of so much}} feeling. When he resumed his seat and former attitude <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that <b>his</b> face was almost gray.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>his</b> upturned {{face as he}} floated onwards {{down the}} stream, through the meadow! It was full of deep resignation.|$|E
6000|$|... "If <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>his</b> wife, I sh'd caution {{her about}} lettin' him climb {{mountains}} too much. A'n't your father afraid he'll ovado?" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>his</b> dilemma. It was {{the best}} man who should go, and yet it {{was the best}} man whom he could least spare.|$|E
60|$|As I {{looked down}} at the little factor, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that <b>his</b> face was flushed and that he bore every {{appearance}} of having had an extra glass.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I {{suppose we}} must go on to Tampel," [...] said Anscombe rather faintly, for <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that <b>his</b> wound was giving him {{a good deal of}} pain.|$|R
60|$|Aca. It was my honour made my duty err; <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> <b>his</b> prisoners forced away, To whom I owed my life, and you the day.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{shall see}} that," [...] I cried, {{springing}} forward, {{but he was}} already gone, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>his</b> tall form moving away through the gathering darkness.|$|E
6000|$|... "I felt at {{once that}} he had; <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>his</b> {{animation}} was extravagant. He need not have troubled himself, I {{was not going to}} run after him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Cuss him!' Dick said to me, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>his</b> hold on {{his rifle}} tighten, 'what {{does he look}} at Queen May like that for? You mark my words, Abe, trouble will come of this.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, I don't know," [...] said Kendricks, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that <b>his</b> fancy was {{beginning}} {{to play with the}} situation; [...] "I don't see why it isn't a charming scheme." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Tell me," [...] said Holmes--and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> by <b>his</b> {{eyes that}} he was much excited--"was this a mere {{addition}} to the first or did it appear to be entirely separate?" ...|$|R
60|$|Then I told my story, and Mr. Poplington {{said it was}} a mercy I was not killed, and Jone didn't say much, but <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that <b>his</b> teeth was grinding.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{have all}} heard of him," [...] said the baronet, looking round curiously; [...] "and must all feel an {{interest}} in what concerns so brave and just a man. I would <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>his</b> counterpart." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>his</b> black figure clearly {{outlined}} against the green behind him. I noted him, {{and the energy}} with which he walked but he passed from my mind again as I hurried on upon my errand.|$|E
60|$|Wish <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>his</b> face, though. Explain better. Why {{the barber}} in Drago's always looked my face when I spoke {{his face in}} the glass. Still hear it better here than in the bar though farther.|$|E
60|$|I went down, unfastened the door, {{and let him}} in, {{and locked}} the door again. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> <b>his</b> face. He was hatless, and his coat was unbuttoned.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ross is my name. I {{have been}} {{watching}} by you!" [...] He looked surprised for an instant, and then <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that <b>his</b> habit of judging for himself came into play.|$|R
60|$|Paul {{had neither}} spoken nor moved; {{at the moment}} his back was toward me, a fact which I regretted because <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> <b>his</b> face to learn if he changed color.|$|R
60|$|Another flow {{of tears}} seemed imminent, but Tripp hurled {{himself into the}} {{crevasse}} and dammed it. Confound him, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>his</b> game. He {{was trying to make}} a story of it for his sordid ends and profit.|$|E
6000|$|... 'What a nest for owls and serpents! No {{wonder the}} snakes live here,' said Strickland, {{climbing}} {{farther into the}} roof. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>his</b> elbow thrusting with the rod. 'Come out of that, whoever you are! Heads below there! It's falling.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ye {{should have}} changed at Berwick,' the station-master said, still gruffly, 'and come {{on by the}} slow train.' <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>his</b> careful Scotch soul was vexed (incidentally) at our extravagance in paying the extra fare to Edinburgh and back again.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> by <b>his</b> {{face that}} he had heard of me. Everybody had heard of me since my duel with the six fencing masters. My manner, however, served to put him at his ease with me.|$|R
60|$|She {{stepped back}} again before <b>I</b> <b>could</b> attempt to answer, and next instant with a hideous, {{concentrated}} effort, Oro bending himself double, thrust upon the rod, as <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> from <b>his</b> open mouth, shouting while he thrust.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Ravenor softly {{pulled down}} the green {{lampshade}} on the side nearest to him, and in the subdued light <b>I</b> <b>could</b> scarcely <b>see</b> <b>his</b> face, but I felt that his interest in my story was growing.|$|R
