Studies in coal mining gas drainage operations, particularly in coal seams that are deeply undersaturated and have low permeability, found the rate of reservoir pressure reduction was prohibitively slow. In such conditions, lengthy production delays have been experienced while additional gas drainage drilling is undertaken in an attempt to reduce seam gas content below specified threshold limits.

40|$|Methane is {{a highly}} {{explosive}} gas released during coal mining that presents an imminent problem when mixed with oxygen in regard to maintaining safe working conditions in underground and highwall mines. The Moura Mine’s current Addcar highwall coal mining operation in Central Queensland has identified that high methane concentrations on the northern side of the mine have restricted production rates and penetration depths of mining equipment {{in comparison to the}} southern side, with lower methane concentrations (Conway, B 2006, pers. comm., 11 April).

Further research has suggested that <b>injection</b> of <b>inert</b> <b>gases</b> can provide an effective means to control methane concentrations in highwall mining applications (Volkwein 1993 & 1997). Trials at the Moura Mine of the <b>injection</b> of various <b>inert</b> <b>gases</b> (nitrogen, boiler gas and carbon dioxide) at different injection configurations on the current highwall mining operation have been inconclusive (Kunst, G 2006, pers. comm., 16 July).

Specifically, for example, a three-dimensional CFD analysis would provide a more comprehensive representation of the current highwall mining operation.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this project is to develop mechanistic models specific to CO 2 sequestration in BP’s Tiffany coal bed methane (CBM) field. In this study, the original field model was modified to match the field performance of a 5 -spot pattern {{in the northern part}} of the Tiffany Field where BP plans to perform a micro-pilot test. The modified model consists of one high-permeability fast layer sandwiched between two low-permeability slow layers. In this mechanistic model, the fast layer represents well-cleated and fractured coal from all geological layers while the slow layers represent coal with little or no fracture development from the same geological layers. The model successfully matched the performance of the 5 -spot pattern during the enhanced recovery period (N 2 injection). However, in order to match nitrogen breakthrough times and nitrogen cut the vertical transmissibility between layers had to be set to zero. During <b>gas</b> <b>injection,</b> nitrogen was allowed to enter all three layers, not just the high-permeability fast layer. However, because the permeabilities of the slow layers were low and there is no communication between the fast and the slow layers, most of the injected nitrogen entered the high-permeability fast layer. This suggests that the future <b>gas</b> <b>injection</b> and CO 2 sequestration may be restricted to only one third of the total available pay. For future <b>gas</b> <b>injections,</b> the modified model predicted early CO 2 breakthrough with high CO 2 cut. This suggests that the actual CO 2 sequestration capability of the Tiffany Field might not be as high as originally expected.

CFD simulations indicate that <b>inert</b> <b>gas</b> <b>injection</b> close to the face is ineffective even at higher flow rates in the order of 1. 0 to 2. 0 m 3 /s.

The study also indicates that just injecting inert gas into the goaf does not ensure prevention of heating incidents in the entire length of panels or all longwall panels. A number of parameters such as panel ventilation system, goaf caving conditions, and longwall retreat rate and goaf gas drainage can make a specific inertisation strategy ineffective and the inertisation strategies need to be modified based on the specific conditions at the mine sites...|$|E

The following work {{is focusing on}} the case of non-flammable liquid as the process liquid in case the working area around the equipment may contain quantities of explosive gases. As stated by Alfa Laval documentation, the major risk is leaking of the explosive atmosphere into the separator from the surrounding environment which may result in producing zone 1 or zone 2 of hazardous area classification. Zone 1 : Area in which an explosive gas-air mixture is likely to occur for short periods in normal operation. 1 Zone 2 : Area in which an explosive gas-air mixture is not likely to occur, and if it occurs it will only exist for a very short time due to an abnormal condition. 1 According to Alfa Laval design package, there is a need of continuous <b>inert</b> <b>gas</b> <b>injection</b> into the separator during the process {{in order to reduce the}} oxygen concentration and keep it in the safe level (inert gas purging) and this policy is aimed to meet the requirements of ATEX-directive 94 / 9 /EC/ 2003.

40|$|To recover oil {{remaining}} in petroleum reservoirs after waterflooding, the gravitationally stable mode of gas injection {{is recognized as}} a promising tertiary oil recovery process. Understanding the phenomena occurring {{over the course of}} the gravity-assisted <b>inert</b> <b>gas</b> <b>injection</b> (GAIGI) process is thus important. Extensive studies on both secondary and tertiary modes of gravity drainage have shown promising results in recovering oil from homogeneous water-wet glass bead packs, sand packs, and sandstone cores, respectively. However, it is not realistic to anticipate similar flow mechanisms and recovery results in all types of reservoirs because the natural hydrocarbon reservoirs are all heterogeneous in terms of their permeability, porosity, and wettability. Such heterogeneities cause irregular displacement patterns, and nonuniform fluid distribution. The impact of heterogeneity of the porous media on the GAIGI process has not been fully addressed in the experimental studies carried out to date; therefore, this thesis aims to fill in the gap of knowledge on this area. The impact of reservoir wettability and pore structure heterogeneities at the macroscopic scale on the recovery efficiency of the GAIGI process was investigated through a systematic experimental study for tertiary recovery of waterflood residual oil. To obtain heterogeneous (in terms of wettability) packings, isolated inclusions of oil-wet consolidated glass beads were embedded in a continuum of unconsolidated water-wet glass beads. Similarly, the heterogeneous porous media exhibiting permeability heterogeneity consisted of large-pore-size isolated regions randomly distributed in a small-pore-size continuum. Upon waterflooding, significantly higher waterflood residual oil saturation was established in both cases of heterogeneous media in comparison to water-wet homogeneous porous media. The amount of waterflood residual oil varied linearly with the volume fraction of heterogeneities in the packings. Experimental results obtained from tertiary gravity drainage experiments demonstrated that the continuity of water-wet portions of the heterogeneous porous media facilitates the residual oil recovery through the film flow mechanism, provided that the oil spreading coefficient is positive. In addition, owing to the high waterflood residual oil content of the heterogeneous media tested, the oil bank formation occurred earlier and grew faster than that in homogeneous media, resulting in a higher oil recovery factor. However, the favorable wettability conditions in both the homogeneous and heterogeneous porous media exhibiting permeability heterogeneity resulted in slightly lower reduced residual oil saturation after the GAIGI process compared to that in the heterogeneous media with wettability heterogeneity under the same condition of withdrawal rate. In addition, the oil recovery factor at gas breakthrough was found to be inversely related to the production rate due to the functionality of gravity and viscous forces over the course of gravity drainage. These two forces were combined into a dimensionless form, defined as the gravity number (Ngv=Kogg/oVpg). It was discovered that there is a correlation between the oil recovery factor at gas breakthrough and the gravity number for both the heterogeneous and homogeneous media. The correlation of recovery factor at gas breakthrough versus the gravity number in heterogeneous media followed a similar trend as that found for homogeneous water-wet porous media. However, at a given gravity number, the recovery factor in heterogeneous media was greater than that in the homogeneous media. This implies that heterogeneous media will be better target reservoirs for applying the GAIGI process compared to the homogeneous reservoirs...|$|E
40|$|Gas {{injection}} reactors in general, and bubble column reactors in particular, are {{key elements}} of many pyrometallurgical flow charts. Nevertheless, the phenomena and interactions that govern these reactors are not yet fully understood. From a multiscale point of view, the main bottleneck is situated at a mesoscopic level on which individual bubbles are considered. While simulations and water models can be very helpful to widen this bottleneck, experimental observations of gas bubbles in real pyrometallurgical systems remain indispensable for validation and fine-tuning of mesoscopic system descriptions. Unfortunately, the opacity of these systems enforces the use of indirect imaging techniques with limited temporal or spatial resolution. In addition, accurate tracking of the gas-liquid interface requires tomography, further complicating the design of an experimental setup. In this doctoral study an alternative and innovative approach is suggested that circumvents these two main restrictions. By injecting gas in a thin sheet of liquid entrapped between two flat and closely spaced plates, bubbles in a Hele-Shaw flow regime are generated. The resulting quasi-two-dimensional multiphase flow phenomena can be fully captured from a single point of view. Moreover, when using a transparent plate material that is not wetted by the liquid, even bubbles in opaque liquids can be visualized directly. This approach is explored for <b>inert</b> <b>gas</b> <b>injection</b> in liquid metals. To demonstrate the feasibility of the suggested Hele-Shaw based approach, buoyancy driven nitrogen bubbles in liquid mercury are observed at room temperature in a Hele-Shaw cell of 1 mm thickness. By using a moving high speed camera to make continuous close up recordings of individual bubbles, the position and geometry of these bubbles are quantified with a high resolution along their entire path. After a thorough evaluation of the experimental accuracy, this information is used for {{a detailed analysis of}} bubble volume variations. It is clear that a hydrostatic pressure gradient accounts for the most of the observed bubble growth. Yet, a careful assessment of the variations for smaller bubbles suggests that an accurate bubble description should also account for significant dynamic pressure variations that are largely flow regime dependent. Contrary to aqueous systems, in mercury transitions between these regimes can readily be observed along the trajectory of individual, expanding bubbles. A mapping for bubbles with diameters between 4 mm and 20 mm shows the existence of two different regimes: smaller bubbles adopt a constant round-to-elliptical shape and travel along a linear path while larger bubbles exhibit a periodically distorted shape and follow a swirling trajectory. The transition between this linear and periodic regime can be attributed to a shift from capillary to inertia dominated flow with increasing bubble size. Furthermore, a quantitative mapping of the bubble velocity shows that the transition {{goes hand in hand with}} a steep acceleration, and that the linear regime is marked by a negative correlation between the Eötvös number and the Reynolds number while the opposite is true for the periodic regime. To demonstrate the applicability of the suggested Hele-Shaw based approach for industrially relevant systems, a high-temperature experimental setup is developed. With this setup, nitrogen bubbles are observed in liquid zinc at 700 &# 176;C in a fused quartz cell with a thickness of 1. 5 mm. At low oxygen levels, cell walls are not wetted by the liquid zinc and bubbles can be visualized directly through the transparent cell walls, using the same moving high speed camera as for mercury. In the range of diameters between 5. 9 and 9. 0 mm, this reveals a single periodic flow regime in which bubbles follow a sinusoidal path with a characteristic frequency of 3. 31 Hz. In addition, systematic intermediate accelerations are observed of which the exact origin remains unexplained. A direct extrapolation of the observations in a Hele-Shaw cell to industrially relevant geometries is not straightforward. As a consequence, such experiments will never be able to completely replace three-dimensional observations. Nevertheless, the suggested approach seems very promising as a first step in the study of gas bubbles in liquid metals. After all, in a Hele-Shaw cell, the same effects and interactions that govern unconfined bubbles can be studied. In addition, the resolution of the observations is unseen for bubbles in liquid metals, especially at high temperatures. This makes them highly suitable for detailed validations of simulation results. Therefore it is expected that this approach can contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms that govern gas injection in pyrometallurgy and support future developments in this field. nrpages: 144 status: publishe...|$|E
