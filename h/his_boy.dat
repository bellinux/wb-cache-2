5|$|The {{second phase}} was {{contingency}} training, {{which focused on}} astronauts learning the skills required to survive if the landing did not occur where planned. The group started their training by being dropped off {{in the middle of}} the jungle in Panama. They performed the survival training in pairs, carrying only their parachutes and survival kits. Chaffee, with help from <b>his</b> <b>Boy</b> Scout training, foraged for enough food to survive during the three-day training mission. Following the jungle training, the astronauts traveled to an entirely different environment: the desert of Reno, Nevada. For clothing, the astronauts had only long underwear, shoes, and robes they manufactured from their parachutes. Lizards and snakes were the main source of food, and the astronauts used their parachutes as makeshift tents for shelter for the two days of desert training.|$|E

25|$|Throughout {{the times}} {{covered by the}} Chronicles of Narnia, Calormen and Narnia {{maintain}} an uneasy, albeit generally peaceable, coexistence. The Horse and <b>His</b> <b>Boy</b> and The Last Battle contain plot lines that focus on Calormen, {{while some of the}} other books have peripheral references. In The Horse and <b>His</b> <b>Boy</b> the main characters (one a young member of the Calormene nobility) escape from Calormen to Archenland and Narnia whilst the Calormene cavalry under Prince Rabadash attempts to invade Narnia and capture the Narnian Queen Susan for his bride. The rather small (200 horse) Calormene invasion force is rebuffed at the gates of the Kingdom of Archenland. In The Last Battle, there is a reference to King Erlian having fought a war with the Calormenes. King Tirian is - until the events narrated in the book - at peace with them, and some level of trade and travel exist between Narnia and Calormen. The Narnian King does but maintain a supply of Calormene armour and weapons for the purpose of conducting undercover operations in their country - suggesting a kind of cold war.|$|E

25|$|Fans of {{the series}} often have strong {{opinions}} over {{the order in which}} the books should be read. The issue revolves around the placement of The Magician's Nephew and The Horse and <b>His</b> <b>Boy</b> in the series. Both are set significantly earlier in the story of Narnia than their publication order and fall somewhat outside the main story arc connecting the others. The reading order of the other five books is not disputed.|$|E
