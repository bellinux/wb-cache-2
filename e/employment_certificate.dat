Cataloged from PDF version of Internship report. Includes bibliographical references (page 55). During my internship in Banglalink “Conversion Project” was assigned {{to me by my}} supervisor. This project was mainly about converting temporary employees into permanent. This conversion project problem was many employees has to come to head office at Dhaka from regional office outside or in Dhaka but far way from head office. If there was automation this wouldn‟t have been happened. Employees time have saved. For <b>employment</b> <b>certificate</b> and NOC employees from far away has to come to collect NO and <b>employment</b> <b>certificate.</b> If there is fully automated system employees don‟t have to come. Bangalink doesn‟t only depend on resource and capabilities or threats and opportunities. so, this imply Banglalink doesn‟t Industrial organization model blindly or Resource based view model blindly. They follow both. This is because they have to focus both resources and on industry. In Banglalink hygiene factors employees salary, even a simple thing like AC is also hygiene factor. In Bangalink satisfiers are employees increment and promotion. Banglalink fulfills ERG theory‟s lower order physiological and security needs but not fully. Employees growth need is not fully satisfied because Banglaink don‟t provide extensive trainings to their employees. In Bangalink when one employee perform well get promotion so other employee learn from it. The other employee performs well because he knows if he perform well he will get promotion or increment. this practical implication of social learning theory. Banglalink has all the components of Best Practice but as entry level employees don‟t receive extensive training and selection procedure is not perfect. That‟s why we can‟t say Banglalink practice is Best Practice. Taniya NashinB. Business Administratio...|$|E

40|$|Does the undocumented {{status of}} 1. 5 -generation Latinos (those who {{migrated}} {{at a young}} age) in the United States affect their political, civic, and public selves? Our approach to this question begins with a theoretical framework based {{on the concept of}} abjectivity, which draws together abject status and subjectivity. We argue that the practices of the biopolitics of citizenship and governmentality-surveillance, immigration documents, <b>employment</b> forms, birth <b>certificates,</b> tax forms, drivers' licenses, credit card applications, bank accounts, medical insurance, car insurance, random detentions, and deportations-enclose, penetrate, define, limit, and frustrate the lives of undocumented 1. 5 -generation Latino immigrants. We examine data from a random-sample telephone survey of 805 Latinos and 396 whites in Orange County, California, to provide general patterns that distinguish 1. 5 -generation Latino immigrants from their first-generation counterparts and to suggest the contours of their lives as undocumented immigrants. We then examine in-depth interviews with 80 respondents also in Orange County who provide extensive qualitative information and personal narratives. The analysis shows how abjectivity and illegality constrain daily life, create internalized fears, in some ways immobilize their victims, and in other ways motivate them to engage politically to resist the dire conditions of their lives. © 2012 by The Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Emery-Dreifuss muscular {{dystrophy}} (EDMD) {{is a very}} rare genetic disorder affecting skeletal and heart muscles. The {{aim of this study}} was to identify factors which might influence the ability to work in EDMD patients in Poland. Material and Methods: The study included 24 patients suffering from either of the two EDMD forms: 17 with emerinopathy (EDMD 1; EDMD caused by mutations in the emerin gene) and 7 with laminopathy (EDMD 2; EDMD caused by the lamin A/C gene mutations). After clinical evaluation of EDMD course, study participants were questioned about their education, current and former <b>employment,</b> and disability <b>certificates</b> and pensions. Results: 54 % of the study participants were employed, and 90 % of them had job position corresponding to their education. Undertaking work did not correlate with the level of physical performance or disease complication, but it revealed statistically significant correlation with a higher level of education (p = 0. 015). Only 23 % of professionally active patients were employed in a sheltered workplace. Disability certificate was granted to all EDMD 2 and to 90 % of EDMD 1 patients. All EDMD 2 and 50 % of EDMD 1 patients received a disability pension, which reflects more severe course of EDMD 2. Conclusions: Higher level of education increased the chance of employment, even if significant disability was present. Therefore, I hypothesize that advice on education and jobcounseling should be applied as early as possible after the diagnosis of EDMD...|$|R
5000|$|North Carolina {{first made}} an effort to hire {{qualified}} teachers in 1845. This act required school committees to [...] "contract with a suitable teacher for their respective district, with strict regard to be had to the qualification and moral character of said teacher." [...] In 1847, the law was made more precise, and a committee of examination was created to appraise the adequacy of the teachers in the common schools. The provision stated, [...] "the board of superintendents are authorized and empowered to appoint a committee of examination, consisting of not more than five persons, whose duty it shall be to examine into the qualifications, both mental and moral, of all such persons as may apply for employment as teachers in any of the common schools in their respective counties. No person shall be employed as a teacher in any of the common schools in any county of the State in which an examining committee is appointed, unless he obtain from a majority of the committee of examination for the county in which he seeks <b>employment</b> a <b>certificate</b> of his good moral character and sufficient mental qualifications as such teacher." [...] In 1852, the law was amended, establishing a committee of no more than five persons, with whom {{the chairman of the board}} is established. The amended act also stated, [...] "no certificate issued to a teacher shall be good for a term for more than one year, and shall not be good for any county other than the county that issued the certificate." [...] A new administrative position was created in 1872, giving title to the new [...] "County Examiner." [...] The position duties involved, [...] "the County Examiner of each county shall examine all applicants for teachers' certificates at the courthouse of each county on the first Thursday of January and July of every year, and continue the examination from day to day during the remainder of the week, if necessary, till all applicants are examined. He shall grant certificates to all applicants of sufficient moral and mental qualification. If any person shall apply for an examination and certificate at any other time, the applicant shall pay the Examiner a fee of one dollar.

40|$|Quelles seront les incidences du nouveau Code civil sur la Loi sur les normes du travail ? De même que sa réciproque, quel sera l'effet de la Loi sur les normes sur l'interprétation des dispositions du Code ? Cette {{relation}} synergique qui devra s'établir entre les textes des deux législations fait l'objet de la présente étude. Cette analyse est à la fois comparative et prospective. L'auteur a retenu {{six points}} de comparaison : la prééminence des textes, la notion de salarié, le service continu, la rupture du lien d'emploi, le certificat de travail et l'aliénation d'entreprise. The {{purpose of the}} new Civil Code of Quebec is to adapt the general law to {{the context of the}} Quebec reality {{at the dawn of the}} twenty-first century. It is of the utmost importance for all citizens. Needless to say, the Code will directly affect labour legislation. The proposed analysis sets forth the consequences of the new Civil Code on the Labour Standards Act and, conversely, the incidence of the Labour Standards Act on the understanding of the applicable provisions of the Code. The analysis is both comparative and prospective. Six items are analysed for comparison purposes: the preeminence of the enactments, the concept of employee, the concept of continuous service, the breach of the <b>employment</b> relationship, the <b>certificate</b> of <b>employment</b> and the alienation of an undertaking. The preeminence of the enactments. In case of insurmountable conflict, the Labour Standards Act should prevall over the general law as codified. Because the standards enacted are of necessary application, the Labour Standards Act shall apply notwithstanding the Civil Code of Quebec. The concept of employee. The two legislative enactments (art. 2085 C. C. Q. and s. 1 (10) L. S. A.), if read together, show various similarities (requirement of master-servant relationship, no particular formality is required, forms of compensation are various, etc.). The two enactments contemplate the same reality. Moreover, the standards developed by the case law under the Labour Standards Act will be very useful for distinguishing between the employee and the independent contractor, as defined in the Civil Code. The concept of continuous service. The analysis highlights the weak points resulting from the combined effect of arts. 2090 and 2091 C. C. Q. Thus, it may be possible for an employer to avoid the tacit renewal by granting a series of fixed term contracts. This way, the employer would not be bound to pay an indemnity in lieu of a notice of termination in case of termination. This solution chosen by the legislator is hardly compatible with the letter, the meaning and the spirit of s. 124 L. S. A. Breach of the employment relationship. Under this heading, the comparison of the applicable sections raises some questions :— How to reconcile the serious reason specified in article 2094 C. C. Q. and the concept of serious fault (s. 82. 1 L. S. A.) ?— How to reconcile the serious reason and the concept of good and sufficient cause (s. 124 L. S. A.) ?— Does the payment of an indemnity by the employer pursuant to s. 82 L. S. A. exclude a claim for a notice of termination based on art. 2091 C. C. Q. ?The <b>certificate</b> of <b>employment.</b> The Civil Code states in art. 2096 that upon termination of an employment contract, the employer shall provide the employee with a <b>certificate</b> of <b>employment.</b> Such a <b>certificate</b> is also required under the Labour Standards Act. Here again this doubling raises questions :— Is it possible to add comments on the quality of work done by the employee?— Which consequences result from the fallure to provide this document?Alienation of an undertaking. Article 2097 of the Civil Code supplements ss. 96 and 97 L. S. A. by protecting the employment contract. It will now be possible to argue that the purchaser of an undertaking will be bound to explain the grounds justifying a dismissal which occurred immediately before the sale of the undertaking. Such a proof will be made in the context of a complaint of dismissal without a good and sufficient cause (s. 124 L. S. A.). From this analysis, the author draws certain conclusions :— Case law relating to the Labour Standards Act will be very useful to the interpretation of the Civil Code. The links between certain provisions justifies this approach. — The relationship of some provisions (art. 2094 C. C. Q.) with others contained in the Labour Standards Act (s. 82. 1) is not clear. — The contribution of case law which provides a liberal and extensive interpretation of the Labour Standards Act will likely have a material impact on the interpretation of the chapter of the Civil Code relating to the employment contract. — The new Code does not lighten the burden of the citizen in case of dismissal. It would have been desirable to unify the applicable rights and remedies...|$|R
