5|$|In March 2011 a new {{reform of}} the Stability and Growth Pact was initiated, aiming at {{straightening}} the rules by adopting an automatic procedure for imposing of penalties in case of breaches of either the 3% deficit or the 60% debt rules. By {{the end of the}} year, Germany, France and some other smaller EU countries went a step further and vowed to create a fiscal union across the eurozone with strict and enforceable fiscal rules and automatic penalties embedded in the <b>EU</b> <b>treaties.</b> On 9 December 2011 at the European Council meeting, all 17 members of the eurozone and six countries that aspire to join agreed on a new intergovernmental treaty to put strict caps on government spending and borrowing, with penalties for those countries who violate the limits. All other non-eurozone countries apart from the UK are also prepared to join in, subject to parliamentary vote. The treaty will enter into force on 1 January 2013, if by that time 12 members of the euro area have ratified it.|$|E

25|$|There is no {{precedent}} for an EU member state dividing into two sovereign countries after joining the EU. Supporters of independence stated that an independent Scotland {{would become an}} EU member by treaty amendment under Article 48 of the <b>EU</b> <b>treaties.</b> Opponents said that {{this would not be}} possible and that an independent Scotland would need to apply for EU membership under Article 49, which would require ratification by each member state.|$|E
25|$|Now {{that the}} Schengen Agreement {{is part of}} the acquis communautaire, it has, for EU members, lost the status of a treaty, which could only be amended {{according}} to its terms. Instead, amendments are made according to the legislative procedure of the EU under <b>EU</b> <b>treaties.</b> Ratification by the former agreement signatory states is not required for altering or repealing {{some or all of the}} former Schengen acquis. Legal acts setting out the conditions for entry into the Schengen Area are now made by majority vote in the EU's legislative bodies. New EU member states do not sign the Schengen Agreement as such, instead being bound to implement the Schengen rules as part of the pre-existing body of EU law, which every new entrant is required to accept.|$|E
25|$|The {{financial}} crisis of 2007–08 prompted {{a number of}} reforms in the eurozone. One was a u-turn on the eurozone's bailout policy {{that led to the}} creation of a specific fund to assist eurozone states in trouble. The European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) and the European Financial Stability Mechanism (EFSM) were created in 2010 to provide, alongside the International Monetary Fund (IMF), a system and fund to bail out members. However the EFSF and EFSM were temporary, small and lacked a basis in the <b>EU</b> <b>treaties.</b> Therefore, it was agreed in 2011 to establish a European Stability Mechanism (ESM) which would be much larger, funded only by eurozone states (not the EU as a whole as the EFSF/EFSM were) and would have a permanent treaty basis. As a result of that its creation involved agreeing an amendment to TEFU Article 136 allowing for the ESM and a new ESM treaty to detail how the ESM would operate. If both are successfully ratified according to schedule, the ESM would be operational by the time the EFSF/EFSM expire in mid-2013.|$|E

500|$|A {{growing number}} of investors and economists say Eurobonds {{would be the best}} way of solving a debt crisis, though their {{introduction}} matched by tight financial and budgetary co-ordination may well require changes in <b>EU</b> <b>treaties.</b> On 21 November 2011, the European Commission suggested that eurobonds issued jointly by the 17 euro nations would be an effective way to tackle the financial crisis. Using the term [...] "stability bonds", Jose Manuel Barroso insisted that any such plan would have to be matched by tight fiscal surveillance and economic policy coordination as an essential counterpart so as to avoid moral hazard and ensure sustainable public finances.|$|E
500|$|The <b>EU</b> <b>treaties</b> contain {{so called}} {{convergence}} criteria, {{specified in the}} protocols of the Treaties of the European Union. As regards government finance, the states agreed that the annual government budget deficit should not exceed 3% {{of gross domestic product}} (GDP) and that the gross government debt to GDP should not exceed 60% of GDP (see [...] ). For eurozone members there is the Stability and Growth Pact, which contains the same requirements for budget deficit and debt limitation but with a much stricter regime. In the past, many European countries have substantially exceeded these criteria {{over a long period of}} time. Around 2005 most eurozone members violated the pact, resulting in no action taken against violators.|$|E

Starting from {{the presumption that}} this behaviour needs to be analysed {{in the light of}} the domestic government-opposition dynamics, a set of hypotheses on the causes and consequences of party behaviour in <b>EU</b> <b>Treaty</b> referendums is developed and reviewed for the EU member states in which a referendum was held or anticipated. As it turns out, with the exception of some right-conservative parties, all mainstream parties endorsed the Constitutional Treaty. However, because significant proportions of opposition party supporters are bound to go to the ‘No' side, government parties are eventually crucial in securing a majority in favour of <b>EU</b> <b>Treaty</b> revisions...|$|R

500|$|The Parliament {{also has}} a great deal of {{indirect}} influence, through non-binding resolutions and committee hearings, as a [...] "pan-European soapbox" [...] with the ear of thousands of Brussels-based journalists. There is also an indirect effect on foreign policy; the Parliament must approve all development grants, including those overseas. For example, the support for post-war Iraq reconstruction, or incentives for the cessation of Iranian nuclear development, must be supported by the Parliament. Parliamentary support was also required for the transatlantic passenger data-sharing deal with the United States. Finally, Parliament holds a non-binding vote on new <b>EU</b> <b>treaties</b> but cannot veto it. However, when Parliament threatened to vote down the Nice Treaty, the Belgian and Italian Parliaments said they would veto the treaty on the European Parliament's behalf.|$|E
500|$|Originally EU leaders {{planned to}} change {{existing}} <b>EU</b> <b>treaties</b> {{but this was}} blocked by British prime minister David Cameron, who demanded that the City of London be excluded from future financial regulations, including the proposed EU financial transaction tax.

Cameron subsequently conceded that his action had failed to secure any safeguards for the UK. Britain's refusal {{to be part of the}} fiscal compact to safeguard the eurozone constituted a de facto refusal (PM David Cameron vetoed the project) to engage in any radical revision of the Lisbon Treaty. John Rentoul of The Independent concluded that [...] "Any Prime Minister would have done as Cameron did".|$|E
