In 1975, Isaac Asimov noted that the timing of the Moon's orbit is <b>in</b> <b>tandem</b> <b>with</b> the Earth's own orbit around the Sun—looking down on the ecliptic, the Moon never actually loops back on itself, and in essence it orbits the Sun in its own right.|$|E

Introduced cattle and horses have since taken over this ecological role.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, <b>in</b> <b>tandem</b> <b>with</b> larger Serb and Czech {{national}} units, Romanian prisoners on the Trans-Siberian Railway {{were involved}} in creating new armed formations. Their original goal was to show to the Entente that Romanians were still eager {{to fight against the}} Central Powers, but the Romanians also defended the line in skirmishes with the Bolshevik or anarchist cells. They resisted especially when the Bolshevik Russian government asked them to surrender all weapons.|$|E
5|$|One {{class of}} honest signal is the aposematic warning signal, {{generally}} visual, given by poisonous or dangerous {{animals such as}} wasps, poison dart frogs, and pufferfish. Warning signals are honest indications of noxious prey, because conspicuousness evolves <b>in</b> <b>tandem</b> <b>with</b> noxiousness. Thus, the brighter and more conspicuous the organism, the more toxic it usually is. The most common and effective colours are red, yellow, black and white.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time as Ferdinand, Tac HQ ran Otterington. This {{deception}} built a threat against Rimini in the east of Italy, in support of Alexander's proposed assault on the centre of the Gothic Line. It developed a pincer movement, <b>in</b> <b>tandem</b> <b>with</b> Ferdinand's threat to the west. However, once Otterington had gotten underway, with a major buildup of dummy armour, Alexander changed his plans and decided to push against Rimini. Clarke hastily implemented Ulster, a double bluff in which Otterington was revealed as a sham in the hope it would distract attention from that sector.|$|E
5|$|Based on the {{mechanical}} experience {{gained from the}} Merchant Navy locomotives, Bulleid incorporated his chain-driven valve gear into what became the new design. This now-infamous component was unique in British locomotive design. It gained notoriety because {{it was difficult to}} access when things went wrong and, <b>in</b> <b>tandem</b> <b>with</b> the fast-moving Bulleid steam reverser, could cause irregular valve movements. The entire system was in a sealed oil bath, another unique design, that provided constant lubrication to the moving parts.|$|E

5|$|In 1885, <b>in</b> <b>tandem</b> <b>with</b> {{his work}} at All Souls, Henson acted as tutor to Lyle Rathbone, son of the philanthropic {{businessman}} William Rathbone. The family lived in Birkenhead, where for six months Henson stayed with them. He had ample leisure time, much of which he spent in visiting local churches and nonconformist chapels. This process left him struggling with doctrinal questions, but sure of a religious vocation. The day after his return to Oxford in October 1885 he went into St Mary's, Iffley, and {{with his hand on}} the altar vowed to dedicate himself to God and the Church.|$|E
5|$|In a {{land where}} {{approximately}} 90% of the original island forest has been destroyed, ruffed lemurs cling to {{only a small fraction}} of their original range. Completely dependent upon large fruiting trees, neither species appears to be flexible with its habitat choice, with selective logging resulting in significantly lower population densities. Although they can survive in very disturbed habitats with lower population densities, they are still especially vulnerable to habitat disturbance. Decreased genetic diversity, <b>in</b> <b>tandem</b> <b>with</b> hunting, natural disasters, predation, and disease, can easily wipe out small populations.|$|E

5|$|In the 21st century {{there have}} been three large {{fundraising}} campaigns at the Gallery: in 2004, to buy Raphael’s Madonna of the Pinks, in 2008, for Titian's Diana and Actaeon, and in 2012, Titian's Diana and Callisto. Both Titians were bought <b>in</b> <b>tandem</b> <b>with</b> the National Gallery of Scotland for £95m. Both of these major works were sold from the famous collection of the Duke of Sutherland. The National Gallery is now largely priced out of the market for Old Master paintings and can only make such acquisitions with the backing of major public appeals; the departing director Charles Saumarez Smith expressed his frustration at this situation in 2007.|$|E
5|$|Surrounded is {{the third}} box set by Icelandic {{musician}} Björk. It was released on 27 June 2006 through One Little Indian.

While the box set did not impact any record charts, music critics gave mixed to positive reviews to Surrounded. Most of them were positive towards its packaging and affirmed it was an effective showcase of Björk's catalogue. Nonetheless, criticism was targeted towards its opportunistic nature and technicalities.|$|E
5|$|The {{contract}} with ESRO resulted in TSS providing telemetry for ESRO-IA, ESRO-IB, ESRO-2B, HEOS-1, HEOS-2, TD-1A and ESRO-4, {{all of which}} had low-Earth orbits.

Tromsø Satellite Station worked well <b>in</b> <b>tandem</b> <b>with</b> Andøya Rocket Range and became an international center for study of the auroral zone. The University of Tromsø was established in 1968 and started teaching in 1972.
