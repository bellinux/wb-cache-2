Slemmer and his {{second in command}}, Second Lieutenant J. H. Gilman, met Chase outside the fort. Slemmer refused to allow Chase and Farrand in the fort, even though Chase said he had built the fort and would learn nothing from entering it. Slemmer replied that Chase {{did not know what}} preparations he had made and Chase proceeded to state his business. Lieutenant Gilman reported that Chase said he wanted to avoid bloodshed and that he had written his demand in proper form and would read it. Lieutenant Gilman reported that Chase's voice shook and his eyes filled with tears as he began his demand that the U.S. Army surrender Fort Pickens, a structure that he had designed and built as a captain with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Chase handed the paper to Farrand to read but Farrand could not see it well at night without his glasses so Gilman <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> it aloud.|$|E

500|$|By the 1920s, {{there was}} still little {{published}} in English about the French marshals, and Phipps' proposed Lives of the Marshals was enthusiastically anticipated by scholars of the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars. Despite his diligent activity on the project, Phipps' work was complicated by the regular appearance of new material, which he felt he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>read,</b> verify, and digest; he sometimes incorporated the new material into his own work, and sometimes counter-balanced it with other material. Phipps was convinced {{of the importance of}} his subject, particularly the experience of the future marshals in the Republican armies. The French field armies of the Revolutionary Wars (17931800) formed the military education of the future marshals. Although there was great interest in the marshals, little had been published in either French or English about their early military experience. Phipps called these revolutionary armies the Schools for Marshals. Furthermore, he postulated, [...] "the Consulate and the Empire cannot be judged until the Revolutionary period has been studied in detail." ...|$|E

[...] Some of the reprinted material was abridged, [...] but despite this, Famous Fantastic Mysteries did an important service to its readers by making works available that had been long out of print, and which in some cases had only been previously published in the U.K., making their appearance in the magazine the first chance many subscribers would have <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> them.|$|E

[...] It was funny, I had to go over historical facts and like, biology and weird formulas I had no idea about." [...] Conrad explained that she is playing a character on The Hills, [...] "because America likes dumb people", and that [...] "The idea in the episode is that they make fun of me for being dumb, and then discover that I'm actually a genius, [...] It's a more exaggerated version of who I am, but fun to play." ...|$|E

500|$|The Nikkatsu Company {{conceived}} Branded to Kill as a low-budget hitman film, a subgenre of the studio's yakuza-oriented movies. Their standard B movie shooting {{schedule was}} applied, one week for pre-production, 25 days to shoot {{and three days}} for post-production. The budget was set at approximately [...] yen. Shortly before filming began, with the release date already set, the script was deemed [...] "inappropriate" [...] by the head office and contract director Seijun Suzuki {{was brought in to}} do a rewrite. Studio head Kyūsaku Hori told Suzuki he had <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> it twice before he understood it. Suzuki suggested they drop the script but was ordered to proceed. The rewrite was done with his frequent collaborator Takeo Kimura and six assistant directors, including Atsushi Yamatoya (who also played Killer Number Four). The eight men had worked under the joint pen name Hachiro Guryu ("Group of Eight") since the mid-1960s. Nikkatsu was building leading man Joe Shishido into a star and assigned him to the film. They specified that the script was to be written with this aim. The film also marks Shishido's first nude scene. Suzuki originally wanted Kiwako Taichi, a new talent from the famous theatre troupe Bungakuza, for the female lead but she took a part in another film. Instead, Suzuki selected Annu Mari, another new actress who had been working in Nikkatsu's music halls. In casting the role of Hanada's wife, Suzuki selected Mariko Ogawa from outside of the studio as none of the contract actresses would do nude scenes.|$|E
500|$|The film began {{shooting}} in September 1981. The project was filmed {{under the cover}} name A Boy's Life, as Spielberg did not want anyone to discover and plagiarize the plot. The actors <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> the script behind closed doors, and everyone on set had to wear an ID card. The shoot began with two days {{at a high school}} in Culver City, and the crew spent the next 11 days moving between locations at Northridge and Tujunga. The next 42 days were spent at Culver City's Laird International Studios, for the interiors of Elliott's home. The crew shot at a redwood forest near Crescent City for the production's last six days. The exterior Halloween scene and the [...] "flying bicycle" [...] chase scenes were filmed in Porter Ranch. Spielberg shot the film in roughly chronological order to achieve convincingly emotional performances from his cast. In the scene in which Michael first encounters E.T., his appearance caused MacNaughton to jump back and knock down the shelves behind him. The chronological shoot gave the young actors an emotional experience as they bonded with E.T., making the quarantine sequences more moving. Spielberg ensured the puppeteers were kept away from the set to maintain the illusion of a real alien. For {{the first time in his}} career, he did not storyboard most of the film, in order to facilitate spontaneity in the performances. The film was shot so adults, except for Dee Wallace, are never seen from the waist up in its first half, as a tribute to Tex Avery's cartoons. The shoot was completed in 61 days, four days ahead of schedule. According to Spielberg, the memorable scene where E.T. disguises himself as a stuffed toy in Elliott's closet was suggested by colleague Robert Zemeckis, after he read a draft of the screenplay that Spielberg had sent him.|$|E
500|$|Abi was {{introduced}} into the series in 2006, by executive producer Kate Harwood. The character and her casting was announced on 25 May 2006. She and her immediate family, father Max (Wood), mother Tanya (Joyner) and older sister Lauren (Duggan, recast to Jossa in 2010), are {{an extension of the}} Branning family, who have appeared in EastEnders since 1993. Fitzgerald, in her first major television role, began filming for the soap in May 2006 and made her first on-screen appearance in July. Fitzgerald's mother commented on her daughter's casting: [...] "Personally, I feel I want to show how proud we are of her and to thank everyone who has prayed for her and helped her in any way. At first, it is just the look they go for. Then it is more intensive and she <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> from a script. By the second audition, she was still up against 60 or 70 people. You start thinking about it when she gets to the third audition, but when the agent rang up and said she had got the part it was an overwhelming feeling. You don't know what it means until that point". Fitzgerald was offered the part about three months after her final audition. As Fitzgerald was only 10 years old when she got the part, she was required to balance her filming requirements with schooling in Northampton, and learning lines. In 2012, she told Inside Soap that she thought she had messed up her audition, and did not realise how big the show was until she was older. In 2014, she told BBC Radio 1 that when she met Wood and Joyner, her on-screen parents, she realised it did not matter that she had messed up her lines in her last audition, because she looked like them both. Fitzgerald was required to cry on her first day of filming, and admitted in 2014 that this was embarrassing, and she was unable to produce tears, but was [...] "just making noises". Fitzgerald was chaperoned by her mother until she was 16.|$|E

500|$|The {{read-through}} for [...] "The Angels Take Manhattan" [...] {{took place}} in the Upper Boat Studios on 23 March 2012, alongside that for the episode [...] "Asylum of the Daleks". The final episode Gillan and Darvill shot as Amy and Rory was actually the previous episode, [...] "The Power of Three". Nevertheless, Gillan and Smith got very emotional filming the final graveyard scene. Amy and Rory's scene on the rooftop was filmed in a car park in Cardiff, Wales, with a greenscreen standing in for the New York skyline. To create the effect of the two plunging down, Gillan and Darvill were suspended upside-down by wires and raised and lowered. Much of the episode was filmed in Central Park in New York City in April 2012. The filming was attended by thousands of American fans, which surprised the cast and crew. Other scenes were shot at night in the city, {{as well as by the}} East River in front of the Brooklyn Bridge and in the Tudor City apartment complex. Moffat was in New York City when he came up with the story, and thought it was appropriate for the Weeping Angels. He described the city as [...] "a different backdrop" [...] to shoot a Doctor Who story in, and made use of its architecture. Fellow executive producer Caroline Skinner felt that the location [...] "has such scale and romance" [...] which [...] " [...] the episode a real atmosphere and a very different tone for Doctor Who". The week spent filming in the city was done by a [...] "small unit by American standards" [...] according to producer Marcus Wilson. They did not take any props of Angels or the TARDIS, which were instead added in post-production. Filming for the episode also occurred at a cemetery in Llanelli. During post-production, the New York skyline was inserted into the cemetery scenes. Gillan insisted on reading Amy's afterword to Smith when his reaction was filmed. They were not expecting it to be in front of a crowd in Central Park, and Smith said he had to [...] "treat this like a play". Because the content was so secret, Gillan <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> very quietly and Smith could not hold the real page because a spectator might take a picture of it. Gillan found that she only had one page of the script, and had to improvise the rest.|$|E
