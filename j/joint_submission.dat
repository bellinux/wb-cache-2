40|$|This paper {{describes}} three {{relatively recent}} innovations in the Dutch agri-environment programme which have helped nature management to be contiguous with natural features allowing the landscape {{to be managed}} whole rather than piecemeal—and thus generate higher quality and greater scope in environmental management. The first two, <b>joint</b> <b>submissions</b> by neighbouring farmers and payments related {{to the level of}} environmental output delivered, are scheme innovations. The third, Environmental Co-operatives (EC) —clubs of neighbouring farmers that inter alia co-ordinate and help manage the scheme innovations—is an institutional innovation. None has an equivalent in the UK. Evidence from interviews with farmer and non-farmer members, policy makers, academics and other interested parties show the role EC play in overcoming some of the postulated problems of the two scheme innovations. Not all the problems have been overcome, and cost-benefit analyses have not been conducted, nevertheless there is sufficient evidence to suggest that these innovations have benefited all actors involved: farmers, the government, the environment and the rural economy. Analysis of UK agri-environment policy using actor network theory (ANT) suggests the UK government will need to show similar levels of trust in and commitment to the farming community before these innovations could be introduced in the UK. ...|$|R

MFCC and Audio Spectral. With these runs, first we try to evaluate the performance of different visual and audio descriptors for high-level feature extraction; second, we investigate the use of context and video knowledge in reranking the detection results. The evaluation results show that the reranking schemes significantly improve the performance of the concept detectors, especially for those context-dependent concepts. Figure 1 illustrates the framework of our system and how the five runs are generated. In the following sections, we describe the details of descriptor extraction, and the approaches for classification and reranking.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} our {{approaches and}} {{results of the}} four TRECVID 2008 tasks we participated in: high-level feature extraction, automatic video search, video copy detection, and rushes summarization. In high-level feature extraction, we jointly submitted our results with Columbia University. The four runs submitted through CityU aim to explore context-based concept fusion by modeling inter-concept relationship. The relationship is modeled not based on semantic reasoning, but by observing how concepts correlate to each other, either directly or indirectly, in LSCOM common annotation [1]. An observability space (OS) [2] is thus built on top of LSCOM [1] and VIREO- 374 [3] for performing concept fusion. Since 19 of the 20 concepts evaluated this year appeared in VIREO- 374, we apply OS to re-rank the results of both old models from VIREO- 374 and new models from a <b>joint</b> baseline <b>submission</b> with Columbia. - A CityU-HK 1 : re-rank A CU-run 5 using OS – {{both positive and negative}} correlated concepts are used. - A CityU-HK 2 : re-rank A CU-run 5 using OS – only positive correlated concepts are used. - A CityU-HK 3 : re-rank old models from VIREO- 374 using OS – both positive and negative correlated concepts are used. - A CityU-HK 4 : re-rank old models from VIREO- 374 using OS – only positive correlated concepts are used. In automatic search, we focus on concept-based video search. The search is beyond semantic reasoning, where we consider the fusion of detectors using concept semantics, co-occurrence, diversity, and detector robustness. Two runs are submitted based on the works in [2, 4]. - F A 2 CityUHK 1 1 : multi-modality fusion of concept-based search (Run- 2), query example based search (Run- 4 and Run- 5), and text baseline (Run- 6). - F A 2 CityUHK 2 2 : concept-based search by fusing semantics, observability, reliability and diversity of concept detectors [2]. - F A 2 CityUHK 3 3 : concept-based search using semantics reasoning [4, 5]. - F A 2 CityUHK 4 4 : query-by-example – using VIREO- 374 detection scores as features. - F A 2 CityUHK 5 5 : query-by-example – using motion histograms as features...|$|R
