2500|$|The Colbert Report premiered in October 2005. The {{first guest}} <b>was</b> <b>Stone</b> <b>Phillips,</b> a partial {{influence}} on the character. In the debut episode, Colbert coined the word truthiness, defined as [...] "a quality characterizing a [...] "truth" [...] that a person making an argument or assertion claims to know intuitively [...] "from the gut" [...] or because it [...] "feels right" [...] without regard to evidence, logic, intellectual examination, or facts." [...] was named Word of the Year for 2005 by the American Dialect Society and for 2006 by Merriam-Webster. The character's forceful nature confused some in the program's early days. During an appearance on the segment [...] "Better Know a District" [...] in the show's first season, a frustrated Barney Frank declined to continue, deeming the conversation too dumb. In one early episode, the Colbert character purported to be {{a former member of}} a 1980s new wave group, Stephen & the Colberts, and released a fictional music video from the band for the song [...] "Charlene (I'm Right Behind You)".|$|R

60|$|Thus {{at length}} {{we came to}} the bend, which was more than half way down the precipice, being, so far as I could judge, about two hundred and fifty feet from its lip, and say one hundred and fifty from the darksome bottom of the narrow gulf. <b>Here</b> <b>were</b> no <b>stones,</b> but only some rough ice, on which we sat to rest.|$|R
50|$|Before {{the present}} church <b>was</b> built, <b>here</b> <b>was</b> a <b>stone</b> church from the 12th century. The former church {{was too small}} {{and they wanted to}} build a new church.

5000|$|This Rock {{has become}} an object of veneration in the United States. I have seen bits of it {{carefully}} preserved in several towns in the Union. Does this sufficiently show that all human power and greatness is in the soul of man? <b>Here</b> <b>is</b> a <b>stone</b> which the feet of a few outcasts pressed for an instant; and the stone becomes famous; it is treasured by a great nation; its very dust is shared as a relic.|$|R
50|$|The {{settlement}} {{is built around}} the megalithic monuments positioned in vertical and horizontal directions. These are locally called the daro-daro and the naitaro respectively. Daro-daro represents males and naitaro represents females. The funerary site where the <b>stones</b> <b>are</b> found is on a terraced land which is approached by climbing 7 stone steps {{in the first stage}} and 70 steps at the second stage (a total of 80 steps is also mentioned).

2500|$|The Sierra Madre Oriental, locally {{called the}} Sierra Norte, {{is a series}} of rugged {{mountains}} covered in abundant vegetation, which has had an isolating effect on the people here over the centuries. [...] The Valle de Piedras Encimadas (Valley of the Stacked <b>Stones)</b> <b>is</b> located near the town of Zacatlán. It is really a series of small valleys covering 400 hectares filled with conifer forest. The attraction <b>here</b> <b>are</b> the <b>stone</b> formations which resemble stones stacked one over the other which take on numerous forms. Some have been said to resemble objects such as dogs, elephants, human heads and monsters. Most of the area is only accessible by foot or horseback.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Here</b> the <b>stone</b> <b>is</b> {{seen to be}} {{continually}} accelerated inward so as {{to follow}} a circular path of radius r. The inward radial acceleration of aradial=v2/r {{is caused by a}} single unbalanced centripetal force T. The fact that the tension force is unbalanced means that, in this frame, the centrifugal (radially-outward) force on the <b>stone</b> <b>is</b> zero.|$|R

60|$|The tomb, I {{have not}} the least doubt, was Gothic;--and the {{breaking}} of it to pieces was not in order to restore it afterwards, that a living architect might get the job of restoration. <b>Here</b> <b>is</b> a <b>stone</b> {{out of one of}} Giovanni Pisano's loveliest Gothic buildings, which I myself saw with my own eyes dashed out, that a modern builder might be paid for putting in another. But Pope Urban's tomb was not destroyed to such end. There was no qualm of the belly, driving the hammer,--qualm of the conscience probably; at all events, a deeper or loftier antagonism than one on points of taste, or economy.|$|R

Ragavan in {{his book}} Tamil Culture in Ceylon while {{identifying}} Mathakal with the ancient sea port of Jambukola states as follows: [...] "This port finds mention in Sinhalese chronicles as Jambukola, where landed the sacred Bo-tree sapling brought by Sangamitta. There is also the tradition that <b>here</b> <b>was</b> received a <b>stone</b> image of Parvati, reminiscent of which is its alternate name, Matha-kal, literally stone-mother, simplified into Mathakal." ...|$|R

5000|$|Zamora <b>was</b> {{interviewed by}} <b>Stone</b> <b>Phillips</b> on Dateline {{in a show}} {{broadcast}} in April 2007. Her appeals were exhausted, and with her lawyer's permission she took a polygraph test administered by Dateline. Her story was now that Graham {{and she had been}} breaking up, and that Graham was using the murder to [...] "tie her to him". She noted that she obstructed justice by cleaning the car afterwards and was an accessory after the fact; however, Zamora pointed out that the jury had convicted her of intending to kill Jones, which she denied. When she took the polygraph, the administrator repeatedly told her to stop her exaggerated breathing, a counter-measure for such tests. He said that he believed he had enough to actually say that Zamora had failed the crucial question on whether she had intended to kill Jones. Two other independent polygraph administrators, who were not at the test, were contacted by Dateline and asked to review the results; they said that they could offer no opinion due to counter-measures. Zamora responded to Phillips that she was nervous and hyperventilating despite being told all the questions in advance and reviewing them with the administrator before the test.|$|R

[...] "This," [...] said Hapley, [...] "is the reverse of mimicry. Instead of a butterfly looking like a <b>stone,</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> a <b>stone</b> looking like a butterfly!" [...] Once something hovered and fluttered round his head, but by an effort of will he drove that impression out of his mind again.|$|R
