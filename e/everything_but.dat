5|$|Burton Pynsent House is a {{historic}} country-house in Britain, situated in the parish of Curry Rivel, Somerset, England. It is a Grade II* listed building. The house was built in stages between 1565 and 1765, when it was bequeathed to William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham by William Pynsent, {{who did not want}} the house to go to Lord North.

5|$|Lambeosaurus, {{best known}} through L. lambei, was {{quite similar to}} Corythosaurus in <b>everything</b> <b>but</b> {{the form of the}} head adornment. Compared to Corythosaurus, the crest of Lambeosaurus was shifted forward, and the hollow nasal {{passages}} within were {{at the front of the}} crest and stacked vertically. It also can be differentiated from Corythosaurus by its lack of forking nasal processes making up part of the sides of the crest, which is the only way to tell juveniles of the two genera apart, as the crests took on their distinctive forms as the animals aged.|$|E

5|$|American trumpeter Chet Baker {{recorded}} the tune in 1987 for the documentary Let's Get Lost (1989) {{and it was}} released on the soundtrack album. He also covered it in concert on June 14, 1987, in Tokyo, creating an extended version totaling seven minutes and fifty-three seconds. After his death in 1988, it was released on his posthumous album Chet Baker in Tokyo (1988). At a 1998 benefit concert for the Walden Woods Project in Concord, Massachusetts, ska musician Gwen Stefani sang it alongside a jazz orchestra. It was later included on the accompanying promotional CD for AT customers, titled Stormy Weather (1998). Other renditions were made by Kate Dimbleby and Jimmy Scott for their 1998 albums, Good Vibrations and Holding Back the Years, respectively. The Reputation featured it on their eponymous debut album in 2002, followed with covers performed by <b>Everything</b> <b>but</b> the Girl and Alison Moyet in 2003 and 2004, respectively.|$|E

5|$|Once {{he moved}} to Nutting, Bushnell took over the {{majority}} of the engineering work for the game; Dabney has stated that he advised Bushnell on some of the design, and that some of the construction was done by Steve Bristow, an intern at Ampex. There is disagreement in interviews with Bushnell and Dabney as to how much work Dabney did on the final cabinet, with Dabney claiming credit for the controls, sound, power supply, initial wooden cabinet, and invention of the hyperspace color inversion, while Bushnell claims credit for <b>everything</b> <b>but</b> the sound, cabinet, power supply, and monitor. By August 1971, an initial prototype of the game—now named Computer Space to be similar to Computer Quiz—was complete, and Syzygy moved on to location testing. They installed the game at the Dutch Goose bar near Stanford University, where it met with great success. Nutting was heartened by the response and rushed to make several finished cabinets for the Music Operators of America (MOA) Music & Amusement Machines Exposition in October. Further location tests found a less enthusiastic response from customers confused by the game mechanics and controls, and Syzygy hurriedly tried to adjust the game to be more understandable to players.|$|E
