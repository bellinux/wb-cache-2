25|$|At 18:10 local time, Pukanić {{approached}} his Lexus LS 600h L with Niko Franjić, the Nacional <b>director</b> <b>of</b> <b>marketing.</b> According to first news report, a bomb {{placed in the}} trash can next to the car exploded soon after.

500|$|In October 1980, Luis Vigdor, {{assistant}} vice-president for bullion and numismatic operations of Manfra, Tordella & Brookes, {{then one of}} the largest coin firms in the country, compared the medallions and the efforts to market them unfavorably to the South African Krugerrand. According to Vigdor, they were difficult to market due to their lack of notation of weight, fineness and country of origin. He also criticized the marketing, asserting that people were unlikely to buy gold at the post office, and that the medallions were advertised poorly. Vigdor contrasted the medallions' marketing program with the widespread success of the Krugerrand and the vigorous attempts to market them around the world. Commenting on the poor sale of the medallions, assistant <b>director</b> <b>of</b> <b>marketing</b> for the Mint Francis Frere said in 1984: [...] "it just hasn't worked. They're not selling.

500|$|The {{scale of}} the game was much reduced from the earlier concept, {{focusing}} primarily on Dagoth Ur and a smaller area of land. It was decided that the game world would be populated using the methods the team had developed in Redguard; that is, the game objects would be crafted by hand, rather than generated using the random algorithmic methods of Arena and Daggerfall. By 2000, Morrowind was to be unequivocally a single-player game, with no chance of multiplayer extension. In the words of Pete Hines, Bethesda's <b>Director</b> <b>of</b> <b>Marketing</b> and PR: [...] "No. Not on release, not three months after, no no no." [...] The project, despite the reduced scale, became a massive investment. According to the team's reasonings, the endeavor took [...] "close to 100 man-years to create". To accomplish this feat, Bethesda tripled their staff and spent {{their first year of}} development on The Elder Scrolls Construction Set, allowing the game staff to easily balance the game and to modify it in small increments rather than large. According to project leader Todd Howard, the Construction Set came {{as the result of a}} communal yearning to develop a [...] "role-playing operating system", capable of extension and modification, rather than a particular type of game. Despite the additional staff, designer Ken Rolston would later state that, compared to Oblivion, Morrowind had a small design team.|$|E
500|$|The game {{garnered}} {{praise for}} its graphics, audio, and gameplay features.

Matt Barton and Bill Loguidice of Gamasutra stated the audio-visuals and gameplay's depth balanced the excessive difficulty. They praised the game's [...] "catch and rescue" [...] feature, {{as well as the}} minimap. Cuciz also praised the minimap, stating that the game is impossible without it and that it allows players to plan strategies. Author John Sellers praised the audio-visuals and the connection between the game's plot and gameplay. At the time of its release, Stan Jarocki, <b>director</b> <b>of</b> <b>marketing</b> at then competitor Midway Manufacturing, described the game as [...] "amazing". Next Generation ranked the arcade version as number 13 on their 1996 [...] "Top 100 Games of All Time", saying that its balanced play difficulty makes gamers keep coming back for more instead of giving up. In 2008, Guinness World Records listed it as the number six arcade game in technical, creative, and cultural impact. That same year, Retro Gamer rated the game number ten on their list of [...] "Top 25 Arcade Games", citing it as a technical achievement and a difficult title with addictive gameplay. Also in 2008, Edge ranked Defender the sixth best game from the 1980s. The editors described its design as very [...] "elegant" [...] despite a lack of narrative and characters.|$|E
