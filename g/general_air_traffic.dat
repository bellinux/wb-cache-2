40|$|The {{transition}} from the current air traffic system {{to the next generation}} air traffic system will require the introduction of new automated systems, including transferring some functions from air traffic controllers to on-board automation. This report describes a new design verification and validation (V&V) methodology for assessing aviation safety. The approach involves a detailed computer simulation of work practices that includes people interacting with flight-critical systems. The research is {{part of an effort to}} develop new modeling and verification methodologies that can assess the safety of flight-critical systems, system configurations, and operational concepts. The 2002 Ueberlingen mid-air collision was chosen for analysis and modeling because one of the main causes of the accident was one crew's response to a conflict between the instructions of the air traffic controller and the instructions of TCAS, an automated Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System on-board warning system. It thus furnishes an example of the problem of authority versus autonomy. It provides a starting point for exploring authority/autonomy conflict in the larger system of organization, tools, and practices in which the participants' moment-by-moment actions take place. We have developed a <b>general</b> <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> system model (not a specific simulation of berlingen events), called the Brahms Generalized Ueberlingen Model (Brahms-GUeM). Brahms is a multi-agent simulation system that models people, tools, facilities/vehicles, and geography to simulate the current air transportation system as a collection of distributed, interactive subsystems (e. g., airports, air-traffic control towers and personnel, aircraft, automated flight systems and air-traffic tools, instruments, crew). Brahms-GUeM can be configured in different ways, called scenarios, such that anomalous events that contributed to the berlingen accident can be modeled as functioning according to requirements or in an anomalous condition, as occurred during the accident. Brahms-GUeM thus implicitly defines a class of scenarios, which include as an instance what occurred at berlingen. Brahms-GUeM is a modeling framework enabling "what if" analysis of alternative work system configurations and thus facilitating design of alternative operations concepts. It enables subsequent adaption (reusing simulation components) for modeling and simulating NextGen scenarios. This project demonstrates that BRAHMS provides the capacity to model the complexity of air transportation systems, going beyond idealized and simple flights to include for example the interaction of pilots and ATCOs. The research shows clearly that verification and validation must include the entire work system, on the one hand to check that mechanisms exist to handle failures of communication and alerting subsystems and/or failures of people to notice, comprehend, or communicate problematic (unsafe) situations; but also to understand how people must use their own judgment in relating fallible systems like TCAS to other sources of information and thus to evaluate how the unreliability of automation affects system safety. The simulation shows in particular that distributed agents (people and automated systems) acting without knowledge of each others' actions can create a complex, dynamic system whose interactive behavior is unexpected and is changing too quickly to comprehend and control...|$|E

40|$|The {{relationship}} between shift pattern, fatigue, unrealistic optimism, stress and subjective well-being, {{may affect the}} safety of <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> controllers and their likelihood of continuing in the occupation. The aim of this thesis was therefore to investigate the effect of shift pattern (fixed or rotating) on fatigue, unrealistic optimism, stress and subjective well-being among Mongolian <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> controllers. A battery of four separate questionnaires (and nine demographic items) was completed by 124 Mongolian <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> controllers (response rate 71 %), of whom there were 31 females and 93 males. Length of employment ranged from two months to 28 years. The main findings were that <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> controllers who work rotating shifts reported higher subjective fatigue, lower subjective well-being and higher stress compared to their colleagues working in fixed shifts. In addition, there was strong evidence of unrealistic optimism towards both <b>general</b> life and <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> control specific events. Subsequent investigation revealed that unrealistic optimism towards an <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> control specific events, was approximately two times less than that towards general life events. There {{was no evidence that}} shift pattern, fatigue, unrealistic optimism, stress and subjective well-being were related to the length of employment of participants or the likelihood of continuing in their chosen profession. As unrealistic optimism may affect judgment and decision-making (and it can lead to unnecessary risk-taking in aviation), this lower level of unrealistic optimism towards <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> specific negative events {{is considered to be a}} positive finding. However, it was noted that the overall mean of the perceived stress score of Mongolian <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> controllers was higher than that of New Zealand <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> controllers, although lower than New Zealand college students and a smoking-cessation sample. Mongolian <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> controllers are prey to both unrealistic optimism and the effect of shift pattern on their fatigue, stress and well-being.

50|$|As {{with the}} San Diego airport, the Tijuana International Airport at 1,100 acres (448 hectares) lacked {{the space to}} build {{parallel}} runways with a 4,300-foot (1.3 kilometer) separation to allow for simultaneous aircraft operations. As a 1,200 foot runway separation requires a 3-minute delay between departures to protect lighter aircraft from wake turbulence created by heavy jets such as the Boeing 747 and 767, Airbus A300, DC-10, MD-11 and L1011, a runway separation of 2,500 feet (760 meters) is recommended to allow for simultaneous VFR operations (Visual Flight Rules) of all type aircraft. The Tijuana airport's access roads and terminal configuration also lacked the capacity to move a high volume of departure, arrival and interconnecting passengers to support {{the next generation of}} super-jumbo jets being designed at the time (the Boeing 747-400 stretch version and the Airbus A380).

Guidance application provides indication to the pilot to navigate on the airport surface whereas control application provides steering indications.

However, precise requirements on aircraft localization service on the airport surface, in terms of accuracy, integrity, continuity and availability, have not been completely expressed by existing standards. This paper proposes a methodology to derive these requirements based on FHA (Functional Hazard Analysis) method.
