An important objective of the LGA was to improve the councillors’ representative role and to revive local governance for citizens. Ten {{years have passed since}} the introduction of the law, but not all of its objectives have been reached, in particular with regard to the strengthening of the representative role of councillors. Citizens still judge councillors the same as before the introduction of the LGA. Although the position of the council towards the Board of Mayor and Aldermen did improve, councillors did not enhance their external orientation in their relation to the citizenry. It seems that in the realization of the LGA, the political-philosophical foundation of the term ‘representative’ has barely been discussed. Neither the Royal Committee that proposed the legislative reforms or the Dutch government stated their <b>definition</b> <b>and</b> <b>objectives</b> with regard to the representative role explicitly. As a result, the LGA was manifested in municipalities in various ways and the representative role of councillors in particular became the least improved function.

While the research questions and perspectives in each of the articles are different from one another, the articles are similar in that they all examine the same course, more specifically, clinical practicum in rehabilitation counseling. The focus of the first article (Chapter 2), "Content Analysis of Rehabilitation Education/Rehabilitation Research, Policy and Education: 1995 - 2015," was to conduct a content analysis of Rehabilitation Education (later renamed Rehabilitation Research, Policy, and Education [RE/RRPE]) to determine publication trends.

After a short description of the <b>definition</b> <b>and</b> <b>objectives</b> of the exercise, its content and main findings are shown together with results from other analyses performed within DG JRC – Seville, showing {{the impact of the}} degree of concentration at the company’s level on the overall industrial R&D stance. There seems to be a correlation between R&D intensity growth and net sales growth. Despite a competitive total amount of R&D investment, the average overall R&D intensity of the sampled European Union companies is much smaller than for their non-EU counterparts. This is related to a smaller proportion of output from sectors with high intrinsic R&D intensity, which is particularly noticeable in IT Hardware and Software and Computer Services. Although R&D investment amounts are comparable for the biggest firms, the share of R&D performers at the middle and the bottom of the EU- 500 Scoreboard is much smaller in the EU than in the non-EU. The analysis indicates that national, regional and sectoral patterns deviate considerably from the overall picture of the EU. An entire section of the paper is dedicated to an inter-sector comparison of R&D-related indicators. The issue of concentration of R&D investment among top companies investing in research is investigated in more detail, in large companies, by sector of activity and by location.

Bank environmental supervision activities ensure diligence of Borrowers in implementing mitigation measures. A recent review of the Bank’s experience with EA concluded that arrangements for monitoring and supervision could be made more effective. The 1992 Wapenhans Task Force Report “Effective Implementation: Key to Development Impact ” emphasized the importance of managing the quality of projects under implementation.

In current age, all health areas are interested in the investment optimization and outcomes in about prevention and illness care.

Many local governments and public agencies have been struggling to set up such systems to serve the needs and meet public requirements. Urban life shelters the advertisement reality which is presented at various places, on vehicles, shops etc. in daily life. It {{can be said that}} advertisement is a part of daily life in urban area, especially in city centers. In addition, one of the main sources of revenue for municipalities comes from advertising and notices. The advertising sector provides a great level of income today. Therefore advertising is individually very important for local governments and urban management. Although it is valuable for local governments, it is also very important for urban management to place these advertisement signs and billboards in an orderly fashion which is pleasing to the eye. Another point related to this subject is the systematic control mechanism which is necessary for collecting taxes regularly and updating. In this paper, first practical meaning of notice and advertisement subject, problem <b>definition</b> <b>and</b> <b>objectives</b> are described and then legal support and daily practice are revised. Current practice and problems are mentioned. Possibilities of measuring and obtaining necessary information by using digital images and transferring them to spatial databases are studied.

40|$|Including the {{aviation}} {{sector in the}} European trading scheme is certainly an improvement from the current situation, provided that it results in actual mitigation of emissions. However, there are serious concerns with a trading in which airline companies could buy rights from other sectors {{on the basis of}} “one tonne CO 2 for one tonne CO 2 ”, i. e. without including effects of other gases and aerosols – in particular because aviation generates high clouds (cirrus) that have relatively large short term regional impacts (near the latitude of emission). Indeed, if companies buy emission quotas that only represent CO 2 (e. g. reduction of CO 2 emissions in the electricity production sector), and use these quotas as additional allowances for aviation, the impact on the climate is obviously not the same. This trading is not "climate neutral " as it should be: transactions could reduce the actual positive effect on climate as compared to a fixed target for aviation. Measuring {{the aviation}} effects {{in a way that is}} appropriate for the emission trading and mitigation framework involves choices of <b>definitions</b> <b>and</b> <b>objectives</b> that imply value-judgements which should not be mistaken for scientific uncertainties.

40|$|The {{technical}} capability to network together simulators for al kinds of applications {{has already been}} proven. There are, however, still many unresolved issues regarding the ability of simulations to interoperate in a logically meaningful manner. One of the major concerns in development and validation of distributed simulations is the capability to qualify and quantify the 'over-all' simulation fidelity. In order to properly apply distributed simulations to civil aviation applications, such capabilities are mandatory. Therefore, the Delft University of Technology, in co-operation with the Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research, started a fundamental research program on fidelity assessment methodologies for distributed simulations. This paper {{presents the results of}} a literature survey into fidelity research, and our approach to managing simulation fidelity. Amongst other things, the survey showed a lack of formal <b>definitions</b> <b>and</b> <b>objective</b> fidelity quantification practices. Here a preliminary fidelity theory is developed, which underlies our evolving 'Fidelity Management Overlay' (FiMO) process model. The FiMO provides a structured approach for the specification of fidelity characterizations, their quantification where possible, and the transformation of fidelity characterizations during the whole development trajectory of HLA-based simulations. The theory is illustrated with examples from a recently developed distributed 'Free Flight' simulation. © 2000 by Delft University of Technology.

However the proposed approach {{does not take into account}} the non-CO 2 effects of the aviation sector. Propositions regarding measures to limit the emissions of nitrogen oxides are in preparation and a study on this topic (Faber, 2008) was prepared on request by the European Commission. This note will thus focus on ways to include the contrails and cirrus clouds into the scheme and provide an incentive to mitigate these impacts while taking the tradeoff with the carbon dioxide emissions into account. Measuring the aviation effects in a way that is appropriate for the emission trading and mitigation framework involves choices of <b>definitions</b> <b>and</b> <b>objectives</b> that imply value-judgments which should not be mistaken for scientific uncertainties. Trading requires that a common measure of impacts of different emissions types must be decided. For the Kyoto gases, it was decided that this is equivalent CO 2, an approximate measure of the global average climate effect over 100 years. Taking all uncertainties into account, our evaluation based on the existing literature (including effects of cirrus clouds excluded from many earlier analyses) is that...|$|R

Chapter One explains the aims of the study, <b>definition</b> <b>and</b> <b>objectives</b> of the subject of material culture. The state of material culture scholarship in the Sudan is also discussed with special emphasis on the study of boats in the Sudan. Chapter Two is a general survey of the history and develop= ment of boat building in the Sudan from ancient times to the modern and contemporary period. For this the writer depends on the archaeological evidence, works of classical writers, works of medieval Arab writers, works of the European travellers of the early modern period, works of the historians of the modern period and the ethnographic evidence collected by the present writer about the contemporary boat builders and users. This last category provides material for the contents of Chapters Three, Four and Six. Chapter Three is a documentary chapter about the work of the boat builder, describing his technical skills, how he assembles the hull planking and prepares the rigging, the processes he follows and the tools he uses. Moreover, the terms used to describe the parts of the boat and the tools are also documented. Chapter Four deals with the types of boats in the Sudan at different centres {{on the basis of their}} functions. Regional variations in construction, rigging details, technical terms are also dealt with. The adaptability of river transport to its surroundings and the problem of cultural borrowing and contact is also discussed. Chapter Five is a broad survey of the history of the different cultural influences that formed the fabric of the present Sudanese cultural setting. The materials cited in Chapter Six show how these different cultural influences described in Chapter Five have created the present cultural blend. This syncretism of diverse cultural influences is reflected by the terminology of boat building and handling, some texts of the song tradition and beliefs and practices in their historical and social perspective. ...|$|E
40|$|M. A. This {{research}} study intended {{to explore the}} nature of supervision as practised in the Gauteng Department of Health and Social Development, Ekurhuleni region. The main goal {{of this study was}} to conduct in-depth research to determine how the field social workers and supervisors perceive supervision in terms of the administrative, educational and supportive functions. The objectives of the study were: to conceptualise social work supervision with regard to the administrative, educational and supportive functions, to conduct an empirical study to explore the nature of supervision as implemented in the Ekurhuleni region of the Department of Social Development, and to formulate conclusions and recommendations according to the findings. The study was guided by a research question which was formulated as follows: “How do the field social workers and supervisors perceive the supervision that is practised in the Department of Health and Social Development, Ekurhuleni region, in terms of the functions of supervision, and how can the quality of supervision be improved?” A quantitative research approach was used in this study. The researcher intended to explore and describe, in a statistical way, the nature of supervision as practised in the Department of Health and Social Development, Ekurhuleni region. This study is applied research because it concentrates on the quality of supervision and how to improve the quality of it – which is a practical problem focused on problem-solving. The research design in this study was a randomized, cross-sectional, quantitative survey design, and a group-administered questionnaire as data collection method was used. The research population consisted of the supervisors and social workers in the service of the Department of Health and Social Development, Ekurhuleni Region. A sample of forty-six social workers completed the questionnaires. In analysing the data, non-parametric tests were used. Primarily, the Mann-Whitney U test and the Kruskall-Wallis test were used. The literature study emphasised the importance of supervision in social work practice. Supervision is a vital method to enable social workers to grow personally as well as professionally, in order to render an effective and efficient service to the client system. An overall view was provided regarding the <b>definition</b> <b>and</b> <b>objectives</b> of supervision, the characteristics of an effective supervisor, the models of supervision, and the phases in the supervisory process. The study focused mainly on the three functions of supervision – namely, the administrative, educational and supportive functions, which described the different roles of the supervisor comprehensively. The study found that supervision, as it is practised in the Department of Health and Social Development, Ekurhuleni region, is not structured enough, and that more training should be given to newly appointed supervisors, as well as in-service training to supervisors. Recommendations have been made in order to enhance the quality of supervision and, ultimately, service delivery to the client system...|$|E
40|$|The {{interest}} in complete systems (robots), i. e., autonomous, self-sufficient, embodied, and situated rather than {{only on a}} specific part (physical or theoretical) is becoming necessary from embodied cognitive science and understanding natural intelligence perspectives. Robots have also to be reactive when generating actions (behaviors), i. e., {{at a rate that}} is commensurate with the dynamics of environments in which they are embedded. This has motivated, in robotics and particularly in robotic soccer, several researchers to underline the necessity of behavior learning, lifelong learning, opening then the opportunity to learned knowledge transfer. By another way, soft computing, involving Intelligent Systems (IS) and Hybrid Intelligent Systems (HIS) implying particularly Neural Networks (NN), Fuzzy Logic (FL), Genetic Algorithms (GA), and Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART) has been recognized to improve the learning, adaptation, generalization, and prediction capabilities from past experiences in real dynamics environments. The aim of this work focalizes on the intelligent behavior control leading to intelligent behaviors achieving a fast, cooperative and adversarial robot team (RoboCup) in order to provide GMD mobile robots with more autonomy, intelligence, and real-time processing capabilities. First, an overview is given on both Robot World Cup Initiative (RoboCup) and RoboCup project developed at AiS-GMD. Second, the problem <b>definition</b> <b>and</b> <b>objectives,</b> of this work, from embodied cognitive science and understanding natural intelligence perspectives are presented.

Indeed, just as young soccer players must learn to control the ball before learning any complex strategies, robots must also acquire low-level skills before exhibiting complex behaviors: the most sophisticated understanding of how to act as part of a team is useless without the ability to execute the necessary individual behaviors. Thus, to react in real-time, FPGA architectures characterized by their high flexibility and compactness are suggested for the NN integration. Afterwards, behavior learning to predict using NN: towards a fast, cooperative and adversarial robot team (RoboCup) is suggested to enhance the elementary behavior "Kick". In fact, for instance, through experience one might learn to predict for particular game situations (e. g., chess positions) whether they will lead to a win. In robotic soccer, one might also learn to predict for particular situations (e. g., teammate and opponent positions) whether they will lead to a success. Thus, the suggested NN-prediction demonstrated, during the 4 th World Championships RoboCup' 2000, cooperative and adversarial behaviors especially face to situations where the successfulness of "Kick" is not guaranteed. With such intelligent elementary behavior "Kick", GMD mobile robots involve multiple players, implying then cooperation and coordination among the players of the team (teammates) and taking into account the players of the adversary team (opponents). By another way, the signals of sensors are often noisy or they are defective giving incorrect data. This problem is efficiently handled by NN with their inherent features of adaptivity and high fault and noise tolerance making them robust. Thus, FPGA architectures for elementary behaviors with their high operating speeds, low power consumption and reprogrammable features as well as NN-Prediction provides GMD mobile robots with real-time processing capabilities, more autonomy, intelligence, and flexibility making them more robust and reliable and consequently lead them towards a fast, cooperative and adversarial robot team (RoboCup). Finally, in order to achieve fast, cooperative and adversarial robot team (RoboCup), some interesting alternatives for future works are presented related to 1) soft computing, involving IS and HIS, based learning of elementary behaviors and their integration in FPGA architectures for fast moving robot team; 2) behavior learning to predict using soft computing involving IS and HIS: towards fast, cooperative and adversarial robot team; 3) Dual Dynamics Simulator (DDSim) as pedagogical tool for soft computing involving IS and HIS implying particularly NN, FL, GA, and ART, e. g., NN, Fuzzy Neural Networks (FNN), and Fuzzy ArtMap Neural Networks (FAMNN); and 4) reinforcement learning (Q-Learning) and lifelong learning (Learned Knowledge Transfer) ...|$|E
40|$|This text {{has been}} {{proposed}} for the Encyclopedia of Complexity and Systems Science edited by Springer Nature and should appear in 2018. This text is intended as {{an introduction to the}} topic of asynchronous cellular automata and is presented as a path. We start from the simple example of the Game of Life and examine what happens to this model when it is made asynchronous (Sec. 1). We then formulate our <b>definitions</b> <b>and</b> <b>objectives</b> to give a mathematical description of our topic (Sec. 2). Our journey starts with the examination of the shift rule with fully asynchronous updating and from this simple example, we will progressively explore more and more rules and gain insights on the behaviour of the simplest rules (Sec. 3). As we will meet some obstacles in having a full analytical description of the asynchronous behaviour of these rules, we will turn our attention to the descriptions offered by statistical physics, and more specifically to the phase transition phenomena that occur {{in a wide range of}} rules (Sec. 4). To finish this journey, we will discuss the various problems linked to the question of asynchrony (Sec. 5) and present some openings for the readers who wish to go further (Sec. 6) ...|$|R
