40|$|As a {{promising}} {{solution to the}} reduction of fuel consumption and CO 2 emissions in road transport sector, hybrid electric powertrains are confronted with complex control techniques {{for the evaluation of}} the minimal fuel consumption, particularly the excessively long computation time of the design-parameter optimization in the powertrain's early design stage. In this work, a novel and simple GRaphical-Analysis-Based method of fuel Energy Consumption Optimization (GRAB-ECO) is developed to estimate the minimal fuel consumption for parallel hybrid electric powertrains in light- and <b>heavy-duty</b> <b>application.</b> Based on the power ratio between powertrain's power demand and the most efficient engine power, GRAB-ECO maximizes the average operating efficiency of the internal combustion engine by shifting operating points to the most efficient conditions, or by eliminating the engine operation from poorly efficient operating points to pure electric vehicle operation. A turning point is found to meet the requirement of the final state of energy of the battery, which is charge-sustaining mode in this study. The GRAB-ECO was tested with both light- and heavy-duty parallel hybrid electric vehicles, and validated in terms of the minimal fuel consumption and the computation time. Results show that GRAB-ECO accurately approximates the minimal fuel consumption with less than 6 % of errors for both light- and heavy-duty parallel hybrid electric powertrains.

5000|$|CCS {{have been}} {{successfully}} installed in thousands of projects worldwide. However, it is incumbent to differentiate between low load applications, such as slope and channel applications, and new <b>heavy-duty</b> <b>applications,</b> {{such as in the}} base layer of asphalt pavement structures of heavily trafficked motorways and highways. While all polymeric materials used in CCS creep over time and under loading, the question is; what is the rate of degradation, under which conditions, how will this impact performance, and when will it fail? The lifespan of CCS in slope protection applications, for example, is less critical as vegetative growth and root interlock stabilize the soil. This in effect compensates for any long-term loss of confinement in the CCS. Similarly, load support applications for low volume roads that are not subject to heavy loading usually have a short design life; therefore minor loss of performance is tolerable. However, in critical applications such as reinforcement of the structural layer of asphalt highway pavements, long-term dimensional stability is critical. The required design life for such roads under heavy traffic loads is typically 20-25 years, requiring verifiable long-term durability.|$|E
