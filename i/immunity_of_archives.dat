40|$|Abstract—In {{order to}} respond to {{algebraic}} attacks, {{it is important to}} construct Boolean functions with high algebraic <b>immunity</b> <b>of</b> the graphs. In this paper, the complicated problem <b>of</b> algebraic <b>immunity</b> <b>of</b> the graph is converted to the simpler problem of annihilators of the single-output assistant function. Based on this, we propose a new method for constructing singleand multi-output Boolean functions with high algebraic <b>immunity</b> <b>of</b> the graphs. This method can also give many more general single-output Boolean functions with maximum algebraic immunity. Index Terms—Boolean function, algebraic attack, algebraic immunity, multivariate equations. I...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to answer the {{question}} whether there are universal norms of customary international law governing the <b>immunity</b> <b>of</b> international organisations and their property and address the obstacles to the development of the UN Convention governing the <b>immunity</b> <b>of</b> international organisations. Through comparative legal analysis, the Author proves that state immunities result from international and national laws. In the case <b>of</b> <b>immunities</b> derived from international law, there are no universal standards defining the scope <b>of</b> the jurisdiction <b>immunity</b> <b>of</b> a state and its property. Jurisdictional <b>immunity</b> <b>of</b> international organisations has as its only source international law (many states also regulate the issue in their domestic law). The study showed that international regulations move in contradictory directions: as regards the states, there is a move away from absolute immunity, while for international organisations the expansion of the catalogue <b>of</b> authorized <b>immunity</b> and its scope is observed...|$|R

40|$|Abstract − Different {{types of}} {{board-level}} noise filter networks are evaluated for their effectiveness {{to improve the}} <b>immunity</b> <b>of</b> CMOS ICs against transient-induced latchup (TLU) under system-level electrostatic discharge (ESD) test. By choosing proper components in each noise filter network, the TLU <b>immunity</b> <b>of</b> CMOS ICs can be greatly improved. All the experimental evaluations have been verified with the SCR test structures and the ring oscillator fabricated in a 0. 25 -μm CMOS technology. Some of such board-level solutions can be further integrated into the chip design to effectively improve TLU <b>immunity</b> <b>of</b> CMOS IC products. I...|$|R

40|$|We {{studied in}} this paper the effects of {{pregnancy}} on nonspecific <b>immunity</b> <b>of</b> neutro-philes and specific <b>immunity</b> <b>of</b> T-lymphocytes. The number of neutrophiles increased and that of lymphocytes conversely decreased during pregnancy. The phagocytic activity of neutrophiles derived from pregnant woman was enhanced by the autoserum as same as that derived from normal non-pregnant woman. By the contrast, the lymphocytes derived from pregnant woman showed low blastogenic respons iveness to Con A. The sera from pregnant women remarkably suppressed the blastogenic activity of lymphocytes prepared from both normal and pregnant women. Moreover, the lymphocytes from pregnant woman was much more sensitive to suppression by the serum fact or {{as compared with the}} lymphocytes from non-pregnant woman. The suppression by the serum was not due to cortizole that increased in the serum during pregnancy. These results suggest that specific cellular <b>immunity</b> <b>of</b> T-lymphocytes was suppressed to avoid fetal rejection and that nonspecific <b>immunity</b> <b>of</b> neutrophiles was enhanced to escape microbial infections during pregnancy...|$|R
