It was described by Barbara Cartlidge, author of the reference book Twentieth Century Jewelry, as a [...] "milestone in the history of modern jewelry."

Never mind the name of what is beside it; let us stick to the bottle, and {{distinguish}} it, if you like, by giving it a name of our own. Suppose we call it 'our Stout Friend'? Very good. Our Stout Friend, by himself, is a most harmless and useful medicine. He is freely dispensed every day {{to tens of thousands}} of patients all over the civilized world. He has made no romantic appearances in courts of law; he has excited no breathless interest in novels; he has played no terrifying part on the stage. There he is, an innocent, inoffensive creature, who troubles nobody with the responsibility of locking him up! But bring him into contact with something else--introduce him to the acquaintance of a certain common mineral substance, of a universally accessible kind, broken into fragments; provide yourself with (say) six doses of our Stout Friend, and pour those doses consecutively on the fragments I have mentioned, at intervals of not less than five minutes. Quantities of little bubbles will rise at every pouring; collect the gas in those bubbles, and convey it into a closed chamber--and let Samson himself be in that closed chamber; our stout Friend will kill him in half an hour! Will kill him slowly, without his seeing anything, without his smelling anything, without his feeling anything but sleepiness. Will kill him, and tell the whole College of Surgeons nothing, if they examine him after death, but that he died of apoplexy or congestion of the lungs! What do you think of that, my dear lady, in the way of mystery and romance? Is our harmless Stout Friend as interesting now as if he rejoiced in the terrible popular fame of the Arsenic and the Strychnine which I <b>keep</b> <b>locked</b> <b>up</b> there? Don't suppose I am exaggerating! Don't suppose I'm inventing a story to put you off with, as the children say. Ask Benjamin there," [...] said the doctor, appealing to his assistant, with his eyes fixed on Miss Gwilt. [...] "Ask Benjamin," [...] he repeated, with the steadiest emphasis on the next words, [...] "if six doses from that bottle, at intervals of five minutes each, would not, under the conditions I have stated, produce the results I have described?" ...|$|E

5000|$|Patrick Watkins, {{also known}} as Oberlus, was a real Irish sailor who, in 1807, {{spent two years in}} one of the islands of the Galapagos {{archipelago}} during which he captured and enslaved other sailors. In the literature, the life of Oberlus was initially described in sufficient detail in The Encantadas by the American writer Herman Melville. An essay on the tyrant-hermit Oberlus inspired the Spanish writer Alberto Vázquez-Figueroa to write the novel [...] "La iguana". In the novel, there appears Carmen, whom Oberlus <b>keeps</b> <b>locked</b> <b>up,</b> raping and making her bear his child. Vázquez-Figueroa initially discussed a potential adaptation with Italian film producer Franco di Nunzio, who sent him to Monte Hellman. The original script consisted of numerous long monologues, as it was arranged in the form of Carmen's letters to his mother. This option did not suit Monte Hellman, and he agreed to become a director only if the script was completely rewritten.|$|R

Anti-virus protection is often missing. As a result, schools prefer to <b>keep</b> PCs <b>locked</b> <b>up.</b>|$|R
