5|$|Most Scouts {{choose to}} work on the Explorer badge that is related to the section of Scouting their Troop belongs to, but there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> a Scout can not do an Explorer badge from another section. The only {{difference}} between the three Explorer badges is the three compulsory interest badges that are required, and the design of the badge.|$|E
5|$|There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> the writ {{of error}} should be {{confined}} to civil cases. A man's life, his liberty, and his good name, are as dear to him as his property; and inferior courts are as liable to err in one case as in the other. There {{is nothing in the}} nature of the cases which should make a difference; nor is it a novel doctrine that a writ of error should lie in a criminal case. They have been frequent in that country from which we have drawn almost all our forms of judicial proceedings.|$|E
25|$|There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>why,</b> in {{a society}} which has reached the general level of wealth ours has, the first kind of {{security}} should not be guaranteed to all without endangering general freedom; that is: some minimum of food, shelter and clothing, sufficient to preserve health. Nor {{is there any reason}} why the state should not help to organize a comprehensive system of social insurance in providing for those common hazards of life against which few can make adequate provision.|$|E

25|$|So too, many of {{the spirits}} {{especially}} concerned with the operations of nature are conceived as neutral or even benevolent; the European peasant fears the corn-spirit only when he irritates him by trenching on his domain and taking his property by cutting the corn; similarly, there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> the more insignificant personages of the pantheon should be conceived as malevolent, and {{we find that the}} Petara of the Dyaks are far from indiscriminate and malignant, being viewed as invisible guardians of mankind.|$|E
25|$|The folio size, 307 × 445mm, has {{the ratio}} of 1.45:1. The printed area had the same ratio, and was shifted {{out of the middle}} to leave a 2:1 white margin, both {{horizontally}} and vertically. Historian John Man writes that the ratio was chosen to be close to the golden ratio of 1.61:1. To reach this ratio more closely the vertical size should be 338mm, but there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> Gutenberg would let this non-trivial difference of 8mm go by in a work so detailed in other aspects.|$|E
25|$|The lack of R18+ and X18+ {{ratings for}} games {{has been the}} subject of {{complaint}} in the gaming community, particularly on the basis that there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> adults should not be able to see content in games that they would see in a film. One of the main opponents to the introduction of a R18+ rating for video games was the former South Australian Attorney-General Michael Atkinson who has vetoed every attempt to induce one. Following his resignation after the 2010 South Australian elections there appears to be no likelihood of a future veto in the face of public opinion supporting the new classification. In August 2008, Australian video game show Good Game announced that a meeting of the Attorneys-General in March of that year resulted in a decision that the Australian public would be consulted before a final decision on the status of a R18+ rating for video games would be made.|$|E
60|$|She thought {{more and}} more along that line. There <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> she shouldn't <b>be</b> Capes' friend. He did like her, anyhow; he was always pleased to be with her. There <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> she shouldn't <b>be</b> his {{restrained}} and dignified friend. After all, that was life. Nothing was given away, and no one came so rich to the stall as to command all {{that it had to}} offer. Every one has to make a deal with the world.|$|R

25|$|The {{reason that}} the Zariski {{topology}} does not work well {{is that it is}} too coarse: it has too few open sets. There seems to be no good way to fix this by using a finer topology on a general algebraic variety. Grothendieck's key insight was to realize that there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> the more general open sets should be subsets of the algebraic variety: the definition of a sheaf works perfectly well for any category, not just the category of open subsets of a space. He defined étale cohomology by replacing the category of open subsets of a space by the category of étale mappings to a space: roughly speaking, these {{can be thought of as}} open subsets of finite unbranched covers of the space. These turn out (after a lot of work) to give just enough extra open sets that one can get reasonable cohomology groups for some constant coefficients, in particular for coefficients Z/nZ when n is coprime to the characteristic of the field one is working over.|$|E
500|$|Emily Eavis, the {{organiser}} of the festival, {{said she}} was honoured Jay-Z was headlining the event saying: [...] "He is absolutely the right act for our festival," [...] she said. [...] "There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> {{we should not have}} the greatest living hip-hop artist on at Glastonbury." [...] Eavis also cited that Jay-Z was far from the first hip-hop artist to appear at Glastonbury. the Roots, Cypress Hill, and De La Soul had all previously performed at the Glastonbury Festival.|$|E
500|$|The Chief Justice also {{suggested}} that the rationale in the Reynolds case might be given effect by continuing to find the defendant liable for defamation but {{reducing the amount of}} damages payable depending on how much care he or she took to ensure the accuracy of the information published. He noted: [...] "There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> a defendant who has published a defamatory statement should be allowed to get off scot-free for injuring the plaintiff's reputation simply because he has satisfied the 'responsible journalism' test." ...|$|E

500|$|According to Avalon Production, Makedonsko Devojče 2 was {{the best-selling}} album in Macedonia {{in the year}} of its release. The songs were well {{received}} by the concertgoers in Macedonia and Serbia and were among the audience's favorites later on. During an interview with the television channel N1, Gočeva revealed that all the songs had become evergreens in Macedonia. When asked about her future projects and whether she would return to recording pop music as she did before the release of music inspired by Macedonian folklore as in Makedonsko Devojče 1 and Makedonsko Devojče 2 or she would continue {{in the same direction as}} those two albums, Gočeva said that [...] "there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> I would not make one more project like that".|$|E
500|$|In October 1875 Edward {{set off for}} India on an {{extensive}} eight-month tour of the sub-continent. His advisors remarked on his habit of treating all people the same, regardless of their social station or colour. In letters home, he complained of {{the treatment of the}} native Indians by the British officials: [...] "Because a man has a black face and a different religion from our own, there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> he should be treated as a brute." [...] Consequently, Lord Salisbury, the Secretary of State for India, issued new guidance and at least one resident was removed from office. At the end of the tour, Queen Victoria was given the title Empress of India by Parliament, in part {{as a result of the}} tour's success.|$|E
500|$|In {{the days}} leading to the [...] "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes" [...] premiere, the {{watchdog}} group Commercial Alert filed a complaint against producers to the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States. Commentators from the group criticized distillery brand Jack Daniel's for its decision to sponsor Mad Men, citing that it violates industry codes that prohibit alcohol marketing, as well [...] "depictions of irresponsible drinking, overt sexual activity or sexually lewd images". Robert Weissman, the director for Commercial Alert, stated that based on AMC's website, [...] "it appears that the sponsorship arrangement will violate numerous provisions of the industry's self-regulatory marketing code." [...] He continued: [...] "There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> a company {{should be able to}} escape normal enforcement and implementation of the Code simply because it chooses to violate the code in such brazen manner that curing the violation would cause non-trivial complications for a major television series." [...] In association with the complaint, Weissman urged in his letter that the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States become more proactive in regulating the distilleries' initiatives in the entertainment industry. [...] "Our complaint in this instance is not with the portrayal of heavy alcohol consumption, or even with the glorification of such heavy consumption; it is specific to industry sponsorship of and entwinement with such portrayals. Quite different issues are raised where artists choose to depict such activities in the absence of industry sponsorship." ...|$|E

2500|$|Some critics {{discussed}} {{the implications of}} this statement. New York Times columnist Edward Rothstein said that [...] "Ms. Rowling may think of Dumbledore as gay"; however, [...] "there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> anyone else should". The East Tennessee State University's student [...] newspaper accused Rowling of lying, saying her answer was a publicity stunt. Michelle Smith quoted the Death of the Author principle, stating that Rowling's subsequent commentary is irrelevant {{to the understanding of the}} books.|$|E
2500|$|There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> in {{a society}} which has reached the general level of wealth which ours has {{attained}} [...] should not be guaranteed to all without endangering general freedom. There are difficult questions about the precise standard which should thus be assured... but {{there can be no}} doubt that some minimum of food, shelter, and clothing, sufficient to preserve health and the capacity to work, can be assured to everybody. Indeed, for a considerable part of the population of England this sort of security has long been achieved.|$|E
2500|$|The -ize {{spelling}} {{is often}} incorrectly {{seen as an}} Americanism in Britain. However, the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) recommends -ize and notes that the -ise spelling is from French: [...] "The suffix…whatever the element {{to which it is}} added, is in its origin the Greek , Latin -izāre; and, as the pronunciation is also with z, there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> in English the special French spelling should be followed, in opposition to that which is at once etymological and phonetic." [...] The OED lists the -ise form separately, as an alternative." ...|$|E

2500|$|While {{some have}} {{stressed}} her queer, feminist, pro-immigration, and democratic politics, her statements on immigration include sentiments {{that would be}} considered racist today. In a 1934 interview published in The New York Times she stated: That {{is the reason why}} I do not approve of the stringent immigration laws in America today. We need the stimulation of new blood. It is best to favor healthy competition. There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> we should not select our immigrants with greater care, nor why we should not bar certain peoples and preserve the color line for instance. But if we shut down on immigration completely we shall become stagnant.|$|E
2500|$|Hayek {{also wrote}} that the state {{can play a role}} in the economy, and specifically, in {{creating}} a safety net. [...] He wrote, [...] "There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>why,</b> in a society which has reached the general level of wealth ours has, the first kind of security should not be guaranteed to all without endangering general freedom; that is: some minimum of food, shelter and clothing, sufficient to preserve health.

2500|$|There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> in a {{free society}} {{government}} should not assure to all, protection against severe deprivation {{in the form of an}} assured minimum income, or a floor below which nobody need to descend. To enter into such an insurance against extreme misfortune may well be in the interest of all; or it may be felt to be a clear moral duty of all to assist, within the organised community, those who cannot help themselves. [...] So long as such a uniform minimum income is provided outside the market to all those who, for any reason, are unable to earn in the market an adequate maintenance, this need not lead to a restriction of freedom, or conflict with the Rule of Law.|$|E
