40|$|Graduation date: 1939 This {{thesis is}} a {{discussion}} <b>of</b> the major <b>bee</b> diseases found in Oregon with notes on minor ailments <b>of</b> <b>bees</b> and on diseases not yet present {{followed by a}} history of the introduction and spread of the more important diseases, a history <b>of</b> <b>bee</b> legislation in Oregon and a discussion of the distribution and occurrence <b>of</b> American <b>foulbrood</b> and <b>European</b> <b>foulbrood</b> in Oregon as shown by inspection reports of the state apiary inspector for 1935, 1937 and 1938. A bibliography of 39 titles is included. Chapter I. American foulbrood is the most serious disease <b>of</b> <b>bees.</b> It is an infectious disease of the later larval stages and pupal stage caused by Bacillus larvae. The disease is practically always fatal to the colonies contracting it, no race <b>of</b> <b>bees</b> is resistant to it, it is spread largely by beekeepers in manipulating their bees, can be spread in package bees and in commercial honey although neither are important factors {{and it is difficult to}} control except by burning diseased colonies as soon as they are found. Some work is being done on breeding resistant stock and this work has some prospect of being successful since a method of controlling the mating of the queen has been discovered. Chapter II. <b>European</b> <b>foulbrood</b> is an infectious disease <b>of</b> <b>bees</b> attacking the brood <b>of</b> <b>bees</b> in the earlier larval stages while the sugar content of the digestive tract is still relatively high. It is caused by Bacillus alvei, a germ that assumes quite variable morphological forms during its development. Italian, Caucasian and Carniolan bees are usually resistant taken as colonies and not as individuals. The disease may be spread in honey and pollen and on equipment. It may be controlled by strengthening infected colonies and requeening with queens of resistant stock. Chapter III. Sac brood is an infectious disease caused by a filterable virus which does not live long in honey, pollen nor in dead larvae. Its principal damage is in weakening colonies and its seriousness is not usually realized because most of the dead larvae are removed by the bees. Nosema-disease and paralysis are diseases <b>of</b> adult <b>bees,</b> both <b>of</b> them are present in Oregon but are of little importance. Dissentery <b>of</b> <b>bees</b> in winter and early spring is due to stores with too high a water content. Parafoulbrood is not present in Oregon. Isle of Wight disease, caused by a mite in the trachea, is not present in North America. Septicemia and fungus diseases <b>of</b> <b>bees</b> are <b>of</b> little importance. Chapter IV. Instructions are given for methods of diagnosing the common bee diseases in the apiary with a chart listing symptoms of the common diseases. Chapter V. Bee diseases have been known since before the Christian era but it was not until 1903 that the different types of brood diseases were separated and their causative organisms isolated. It is not known just when or how American foulbrood was brought to Oregon but it was present in Malheur county in 1907 and was found in nearly all parts of the state by 1920. It is now present in every county in the state. There was a virulent type <b>of</b> <b>European</b> <b>foulbrood</b> in Clatsop county in 1908 and the disease was common in western Oregon by 1920. At present it is decreasing in importance and is seldom found in central and eastern Oregon. Sac brood is found all over the state but is generally confused with poisoning. Spray poisoning is serious only in Jackson, Hood River and Wasco counties. The first inspection law was passed in 1905, the next in 1917, another in 1920 and the present law in 1933. The first three were ineffective. Chapter VI. The present distribution <b>of</b> <b>bee</b> diseases is given by counties for 1935, 1937 and 1938 as shown by inspection records...|$|R

40|$|Paenibacillus larvae, the {{etiological}} {{agent of}} the globally occurring epizootic American <b>Foulbrood</b> (AFB) <b>of</b> honey <b>bees,</b> causes intestinal infections in honey bee larvae which develop into systemic infections inevitably leading to larval death. Massive brood mortality might eventually lead to collapse of the entire colony. Molecular mechanisms of host-microbe interactions in this system and of differences in virulence between P. larvae genotypes are poorly understood. Recently, it was demonstrated that the degradation of the peritrophic matrix lining the midgut epithelium is a key step in pathogenesis of P. larvae infections. Here, we present the isolation and identification of PlCBP 49, a modular, chitin-degrading protein of P. larvae and demonstrate that this enzyme is crucial for the degradation of the larval peritrophic matrix during infection. PlCBP 49 contains a module belonging to the auxiliary activity 10 (AA 10, formerly CBM 33) family of lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) which are able to degrade recalcitrant polysaccharides. Using chitin-affinity purified PlCBP 49, we provide evidence that PlCBP 49 degrades chitin via a metal ion-dependent, oxidative mechanism, as already described {{for members of the}} AA 10 family. Using P. larvae mutants lacking PlCBP 49 expression, we analyzed in vivo biological functions of PlCBP 49. In the absence of PlCBP 49 expression, peritrophic matrix degradation was markedly reduced and P. larvae virulence was nearly abolished. This indicated that PlCBP 49 is a key virulence factor for the species P. larvae. The identification of the functional role of PlCBP 49 in AFB pathogenesis broadens our understanding of this important family of chitin-binding and -degrading proteins, especially in those bacteria that can also act as entomopathogens...|$|R

40|$|American <b>foulbrood</b> disease <b>of</b> honey <b>bees</b> {{is caused}} by the {{bacterium}} Paenibacillus larvae. Infection occurs per os in larvae and systemic infection requires a breaching of the host peritrophic matrix and midgut epithelium. Genetic variation exists for both bacterial virulence and host resistance, and a general immunity is achieved by larvae as they age, the basis of which has not been identified. To quickly identify a pool of candidate genes responsive to P. larvae infection, we sequenced transcripts from larvae inoculated with P. larvae at 12 hours post-emergence and incubated for 72 hours, and compared expression levels to a control cohort. We identified 75 genes with significantly higher expression and six genes with significantly lower expression. In addition to several antimicrobial peptides, two genes encoding peritrophic-matrix domains were also up-regulated. Extracellular matrix proteins, proteases/protease inhibitors, and members of the Osiris gene family were prevalent among differentially regulated genes. However, analysis of Drosophila homologs of differentially expressed genes revealed spatial and temporal patterns consistent with developmental asynchrony as a likely confounder of our results. We therefore used qPCR to measure the consistency of gene expression changes for a subset of differentially expressed genes. A replicate experiment sampled at both 48 and 72 hours post infection allowed further discrimination of genes likely to be involved in host response. The consistently responsive genes in our test set included a hymenopteran-specific protein tyrosine kinase, a hymenopteran specific serine endopeptidase, a cytochrome P 450 (CYP 9 Q 1), and a homolog of trynity, a zona pellucida domain protein. Of the known honey bee antimicrobial peptides, apidaecin was responsive at both time-points studied whereas hymenoptaecin was more consistent in its level of change between biological replicates and had the greatest increase in expression by RNA-seq analysis...|$|R
40|$|<b>European</b> <b>Foulbrood</b> (EFB) is an {{important}} disease <b>of</b> honey <b>bee</b> larvae that has increased in prevalence in recent years, in both the UK and other countries. EFB {{is caused by the}} gram-positive bacterium Melissococcus plutonius. To date, most molecular epidemiology studies on M. plutonius have concentrated on developing detection methods, and using these to identify the bacteria in honey bees and honey bee hive products, though recently two genomes of M. plutonius have been published. In this thesis a genome sequence for the Type Strain is generated, and used to draw inferences about the accuracy of the published sequences. Genome sequence for other, field-collected isolates were generated and used to identify mobile genetic elements and to elucidate the evolutionary history of M. plutonius. The genome sequences were also used to design the first strain typing scheme for this pathogen, despite this pathogen being previously described as genetically homogenous. Previously undetectable diversity of M. plutonius is explored at a landscape level, showing geographical structuring of populations of the bacterium both within and among countries. The drivers of the observed structure are investigated, with both anthropogenic movements by beekeepers and natural transmission by bees implicated in the maintenance of M. plutonius population structure. This thesis demonstrates the role of the beekeeper in spreading the bacterium through the sale <b>of</b> live <b>bees</b> and through contaminated equipment. Asymptomatic larvae are shown to be carriers of the bacterium (and to go on to develop disease) and a potential role for social wasps as a vector of the pathogen was discovered...|$|R

Microbiological analysis of 394 honey samples obtained from bee hives from Buenos Aires province (Argentina) from three years of sampling (1999 – 2001) yielded 219 positive cases (55. 6 %). The incidence of P. l. larvae infected honey samples for 1999 was 68. 1 % (n = 160), for 2000 47. 1 % (n = 102), and 46. 2 % for 2001 (n = 132). The mean values of spore contamination for the three-year study showed a continuous reduction, probably due to good practices of disease management by beekeepers by breeding bees for hygienic behaviour and reduction of antibiotic treatments for control of AFB. P. l. larvae populations isolated from honey were characterized {{on the basis of}} DNA fingerprints using the repetitive-sequence-based polymerase chain reaction technique (rep-PCR) with BOX- and REP- sequencespecific primers. Four distinctive patterns, named A, B, C, and D, were distinguishable among the isolates. Genotype D was not observed in previous studies; this finding could be correlated with a new introduction of the disease in Argentina since 1997 when only three genotypes (A, B, and C) were confirmed. The rep-PCR fingerprint patterns obtained were compared with the patterns generated by a world-wide collection of P. l. larvae strains. The same 4 genotypes patterns were found within a collection of strains from 18 different countries of the world. It is {{important to point out that}} pattern C was only found in Argentina and in one sample from Uruguay located in the border line, suggesting that genotype C could have been derived from genotype A and disseminated to Uruguay from Argentina.

Both treatments had similar success rates with respect to elimination of EFB in 2000. Shook swarm plus OTC treatment resulted in {{a lower level of}} EFB recurrence in the 2001 season than OTC treatment alone. Colonies treated with the shook swarm plus OTC method showed a recurrence rate of 4. 8 %, whereas those treated with OTC alone had a recurrence in 21. 1 % of cases. The differences were shown to be significant at the 10 % level. These results suggest that the shook swarm plus OTC method could be a valid method for EFB treatment and control in the UK...|$|R
