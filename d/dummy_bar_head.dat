40|$|A silicon {{substrate}} with {{the dimensions of}} 100 × 140 × 0. 3 [*]mm was grown directly from liquid silicon with gas pressure. The silicon melt in the sealed melting part was injected into the growth part at applied pressure of 780 – 850 Torr. The solidified {{silicon substrate}} was then transferred by {{the pull of the}} cooled <b>dummy</b> <b>bar.</b> A desirable structure with a liquid-solid interface perpendicular to the pulling direction was formed when the mold temperature in the solidification zone of the growth part was much higher than that of the <b>dummy</b> <b>bar,</b> as this technique should be able to overcome thermal loss through the molds and the limited heat flux derived from the very narrow contact area between the silicon melt and the <b>dummy</b> <b>bar.</b> In addition, because the metallic impurities and expansion of volume during solidification are preferably moved to a liquid phase, a high-quality silicon substrate, without defects such as cracks and impurities in the substrate, could be manufactured in the interface structure. The present study reports the experimental findings on a new and direct growth system for obtaining silicon substrates characterized by high quality and productivity, as a candidate for alternate routes for the fabrication of silicon substrates...|$|R

50|$|Starting a {{continuous}} casting machine involves placing a <b>dummy</b> <b>bar</b> (essentially a curved metal beam) up through the spray chamber to close off {{the base of the}} mould. Metal is poured into the mould and withdrawn with the <b>dummy</b> <b>bar</b> once it solidifies. It is extremely important that the metal supply afterwards be guaranteed to avoid unnecessary shutdowns and restarts, known as 'turnarounds'. Each time the caster stops and restarts, a new tundish is required, as any uncast metal in the tundish cannot be drained and instead freezes into a 'skull'. Avoiding turnarounds requires the meltshop, including ladle furnaces (if any) to keep tight control on the temperature of the metal, which can vary dramatically with alloying additions, slag cover and deslagging, and the preheating of the ladle before it accepts metal, among other parameters. However, the cast rate may be lowered by reducing the amount of metal in the tundish (although this can increase wear on the tundish), or if the caster has multiple strands, one or more strands may be shut down to accommodate upstream delays. Turnarounds may be scheduled into a production sequence if the tundish temperature becomes too high after a certain number of heats or the service lifetime of a non-replaceable component (i.e., the submerged entry nozzle (SEN) in a thin-slab casting machine) is reached.|$|R
40|$|Alternate bars {{were formed}} by {{sediment}} transport in a flume with Froude-modelled flow and relative roughness characteristic of gravel-boulder channels with steep slopes. The flume (0. 3 m wide x 7. 5 m long) {{was filled with}} a sand-gravel mixture, which was also fed into the top of the flume at a constant rate under constant discharge. Channel slope was set at 0. 03. Initially, coarse particles accumulated on incipient <b>bar</b> <b>heads</b> near one side of the flume and diverted flow and bedload transport across the flume toward a pool scoured against the opposite flume wall downstream. Sorting in the pool directed coarse particles onto the next <b>bar</b> <b>head</b> downstream. Alternate sequences of pools and coarse <b>bar</b> <b>heads</b> were thereby linked down the entire flume by interactions of sediment sorting, flow, and channel morphology. During episodes of bar construction, unsorted bedload invaded interior bar surfaces and was deposited. Persistent deposition of coarse particles on <b>bar</b> <b>heads</b> prevented downstream migration of bars by inhibiting bar-head erosion and bedload transport over bars. Likely factors leading to bar-head stabilization in modelled gravel-bed channels are coarse mixed-size sediment, steep channel gradients, and shallow depths.

Although bed shear stress and total bed load transport rate varied substantially within the reach and from day to day (Ferguson et al., this issue), the median diameter D 50 of bed load was remarkably constant. The bed initially fined from chute to <b>bar</b> <b>head</b> but became more uniform. Sediment deposited on the <b>bar</b> <b>head</b> also had a near constant D 50, {{similar to that of the}} bed load truncated at the same lower size limit. Both load and deposition were finer on average than the bed, suggesting overall selective transport despite little sign of local sorting. In contrast to median diameters, maximum sizes (D(max)) of sediment in motion and deposited on the <b>bar</b> <b>head</b> varied substantially and showed a weak but significant dependence on shear stress. Inferring selective entrainment from this evidence alone would be dubious because D(max) was also found to increase systematically with the mass of sediment sampled. However, two different methods of analysis of fractional transport rates throughout the size range also showed size-selective entrainment and transport. In the marginal transport conditions of this study, size sorting appears to occur but only weakly and mainly in the coarser fractions...|$|R
40|$|Two {{new types}} of sandbars are found in {{distributary}} channels of the modern Ganjiang Delta, Poyang Lake, China, respectively named as branching-point bar (BPB) and merging-point bar (MPB). BPB is defined as sandbar formed at the branching point of a channel where one channel branches into two. MPB is defined as sandbar formed at the merging point of two channels. BPB results from current velocity decrease at the branching point. BPB, arrowhead-shaped and growing towards upstream through upstream accretion, {{can be divided into}} <b>bar</b> <b>head,</b> middle and tail. <b>Bar</b> <b>head</b> refers to {{the lower part of the}} bar below average low water level, submerges under water whether in rainy seasons or dry seasons, and no plants grow on it. Bar middle refers to the middle part of the bar between average low and average high water levels, and sparse plants grow on it. Bar tail refers to the upper part of the bar above average high water level, and plants grow densely on it. From <b>bar</b> <b>head</b> to <b>bar</b> tail, sediment becomes finer and sorting degree becomes poorer; plant fossils increase in number, and silting-mud layers increase both in number and thickness. Vertically BPB shows a fining-upward sequence. BPB can be classified into 3 types: baby BPB with only <b>bar</b> <b>head,</b> child BPB with <b>bar</b> <b>head</b> and middle, and adult BPB with <b>bar</b> <b>head,</b> middle and tail. Generally from the lower delta plain to upper delta plain, BPB becomes more and more mature. If a channel is suddenly abandoned, BPB at different stages may be preserved. MPB is very similar to BPB in depositional characteristics, and main differences lie in its origin and growth direction. Discovery of BPB and MPB has important implications in finding remaining oil in oilfields. Previously, geologists considered point bars on convex bank of meandering channels or longitudinal bars and transverse bars in the middle of braided channels as favorable locations for finding remaining oil. Our study shows such locations as branching points and merging points of channels are also significant because BPB and MPB develop at these locations. Remaining oil has been found at branching points of channels in Pubei Oilfield, Songliao Basin, Northeast China...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper and}} its {{companion}} (Ashworth et al., this issue) discuss measurements of channel change and associated flow and sediment transport processes in a representative chute-and-bar reach within a proglacial gravel-bed river, the Sunwapta River in the Canadian Rockies.

At first the chute aggraded, then sediment was eroded from the chute and deposited in a prograding lobe {{to one side of}} the original <b>bar</b> <b>head</b> between two distributaries. Measurements of velocity, shear stress, and gravel transport rate revealed day-to-day changes in the divergent pattern of flow and sediment transport. The off-center location of the lobe reflected an initial asymmetry in the pattern of flow and sediment transport, but as the lobe grew, the flow and transport gradually switched away to the other distributary. Width-averaged bed load transport rates do not agree well with average rates inferred from <b>bar</b> <b>head</b> deposition or from volumes and spatial patterns of scour and fill; the indirect estimates are considered more reliable than those based on direct sampling for necessarily brief durations.

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} produce AZ 91 and AZ 31 {{magnesium}} alloy billets semisolid continuous casting by using an inclined cooling plate was carried out. The molten magnesium alloy in an electric furnace was flowed on the inclined cooling plate and then poured in a tundish. The slurry prepared using this process was solidified by drawing a <b>dummy</b> <b>bar</b> from a water-cooled copper mold, consequently producing a billet. As a result, we could produce the magnesium alloy billets by semisolid continuous casting. Magnesium alloy billets with refined and globular primary α crystals were successfully and continuously cast by optimizing the solidification conditions. In this case, the grain size of AZ 91 billets was about 55 μm and that of AZ 31 billets was 50 μm. The AZ 91 billets produced by semisolid continuous casting were employed in thixocasting experiments. The experiments revealed that thixocasting could produce the mobile phone casings with spherical primary α crystals at 858 K. Moreover, we proved that the difference of shot cycle did not influence the microstructures for up to 251 shots...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the design and}} behaviour of narrow cast in-situ joints between precast concrete elements in which continuity of reinforcement is achieved through overlapping <b>headed</b> <b>bars.</b> The use of <b>headed</b> <b>bars</b> minimises the required reinforcement lap length and hence joint width, thereby, maximising the area of precast concrete units. Confining reinforcement {{in the form of}} transverse bars and vertical shear studs is installed within the joint. Improved understanding of the behaviour of such joints is obtained by means of experimental testing and numerical analysis. In total, 32 tensile specimens and five flexural specimens were tested. The main longitudinal reinforcement in all specimens consisted of 25 mm diameter <b>headed</b> <b>bars</b> with 70 mm square heads. The tests investigated the influence on joint performance of concrete strength, confining shear studs, transverse <b>bar</b> arrangement, <b>headed</b> <b>bar</b> lap length and spacing, and out-of-plane offset of precast planks. For tensile specimens, a lap length of 100 mm with four 16 mm transverse bars and concrete compressive strength of 28 MPa was sufficient for <b>headed</b> <b>bar</b> yield. Ductile flexural failure, with <b>headed</b> <b>bar</b> yield, was achieved with the same lap length, two 20 mm transverse bars and concrete compressive strength of 39 MPa. A nonlinear finite element model (NLFEM) is presented with results showing that it captures the behaviour of the joint well. Additional parametric studies carried out with the validated NLFEM provide otherwise unavailable insights into joint behaviour. In conjunction with an appropriate safety format, the model is considered suitable for the design of standard joint configurations. Analytical models based on the strut-and-tie method and upper bound plasticity are presented.
