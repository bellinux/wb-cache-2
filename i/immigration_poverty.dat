40|$|This paper explores for {{the first}} time the {{relationship}} between <b>immigration</b> and <b>poverty</b> in Spain. Using the EU Statistics on Income and Living Conditions 2006, we find that both moderate and severe poverty are more acute among migrants than among nationals and social transfers play no substantial role in reducing poverty in the former case. In addition, using an econometric non-linear decomposition, we show the gap in deprivation incidence is fully explained by the different effects of household characteristics on poverty reduction for immigrants and locals. ...|$|R

40|$|Just over {{a century}} ago, reformers {{established}} the juvenile court to address a relatively new class of citizens: children. To that point, childhood had not been viewed as a distinct developmental phase. With the family as the basic unit of economic production, children worked alongside their parents, and fathers were responsible for meting out discipline. In the late 19 th century, however, Progressives began to attribute special significance to children as essentially pure and malleable. Determined to address what they viewed as the interlocking problems of urbanization, <b>immigration,</b> <b>poverty</b> and vice, ‘child savers ’ sought {{to intervene in the}} lives of young people before they encountered the slippery slope of immorality (Platt, 1969). In Judging Juveniles: Prosecuting Adolescents in Adult and Juvenile Courts, Aaron Kupchik argues that the parens patriae philosophy born dur-ing the child-saving movement is still alive and well, despite widespread calls for juveniles who commit adult crimes to ‘do adult time’. In this work, he explores the previously unexamined link between contemporary cultura...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} I first analyze the wage effects of {{immigrants}} on native {{workers in the}} US economy and its top immigrant-receiving states and metropolitan areas. Then I quantify the consequences of these wage effects on the poverty rates of native families. The goal is to establish whether the labor market effects of immigrants have significantly affected the percentage of "poor" families among U. S. -born individuals. I consider the decade 2000 - 2009 during which poverty rates increased significantly in the U. S. As a reference, I also analyze the decade 1990 - 2000. To calculate the wage impact of immigrants I adopt a simple general equilibrium model of productive interactions, regulated by the elasticity of substitution across schooling groups, age groups and between US and foreign-born workers. Considering the inflow of immigrants by age, schooling and location I evaluate their impact in local markets (cities and states) assuming no mobility of natives and on the US market as a whole allowing for native internal mobility. Our findings show that for all plausible parameter values there is essentially no effect of <b>immigration</b> on native <b>poverty</b> at the national level. At the local level, only considering the most extreme estimates and only in some localities, we find non-trivial effects of <b>immigration</b> on <b>poverty.</b> In general, however, even the local effects of immigration bear very little correlation with the observed changes in poverty rates and they explain a negligible fraction of them. ...|$|R

Development means boosting human potentials for the improved utilization of his environment. Rational utilization depends on economical, social and cultural particulars.

The variety of Latina/o cultural forms, identities and experiences are embedded in particular histories, regional economies and political processes in both the United States and the countries of origin of Latina/o groups; they also emerge {{in a context of}} changing and unequal power relations both within the United States and among nations. We will pay particular attention to issues of <b>immigration,</b> <b>poverty,</b> ethnicity and transnationalism among Latinas/os and how gender, sexuality, race and class intersect with each debate. While this course assumes a panethnic label, Latina/o, class discussion begins with a critical analysis of ethnic labels and lays the intellectual foundation for us to discuss and analyze the diversity among Latinas/os; the sources of this diversity; how Latinas/os are understood by policy makers and academics; and important issues affecting Latinas/os today.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{is an attempt to}} explore the {{position}} of the memory and postmemory of Central and Eastern Europe in contemporary Canadian literature. The analysis is inspired by Simona Škrabec’s concept of the 20 th century Central Europe seen as diverse and evolving “space of dispersion. ” In this context, the book situates the novels and memoirs, published in Canada {{at the turn of the}} 20 th and 21 st century and written by immigrants and their descendants from Central and Eastern Europe, as the texts which try to recreate the images of 'Old Places' filtered through the experience of living in transcultural Canada. The analyses of the selected texts by Janice Kulyk Keefer, Lisa Appignanesi, Irena F. Karafilly, Anne Michaels, Norman Ravvin, and Eva Stachniak are predominantly based on Marianne Hirsch’s idea of “postmemory” and Pierre Nora’s “lieux de mémoire". These two concepts capture the broad spectrum of attitudes to the past, remembering and forgetting, and sites of memory as exemplified in the discussed texts. While all of the chosen novels and memoirs explore the problem of post/memory and un/belonging caused by <b>immigration,</b> <b>poverty,</b> and the trauma of World War Π, they try to address the question of identity of immigrants (or their descendants) created on the border between the memory and postmemory of the past and the contemporary reality of transcultural Canada. As a result of this, the post/memory and the recreated after/images of Central and Eastern Europe offer both therapy and consolation as well as testimony to the past and its sites of memory...|$|E
