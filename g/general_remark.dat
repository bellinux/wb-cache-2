500|$|The {{new plan}} {{appeared}} to make everybody happy, and a $2 million joint-services contract {{managed by the}} Air Force was awarded to Avro to build and test two Avrocars, which the Army {{referred to as the}} VZ-9-AV (with AV standing for [...] "Avro," [...] an unusual departure from normal U.S. Army nomenclature), {{the latest in a series}} of [...] "VZ" [...] aircraft. Army interest in the Avrocar program was apparently very high. Bernard Lindenbaum of the Air Force Flight Dynamics Laboratory recalls a trip to Washington in the late 1950s to request additional funding for a study on helicopter drag reduction. Although the funding was approved, he overheard an Army <b>General</b> <b>remark</b> that the Huey would be the last helicopter the Army would buy since the helicopter would be replaced by the Avrocar.|$|E
2500|$|Throughout {{the entire}} {{period of the}} main {{response}} to the tsunami disaster – from December 2004 {{for the next four}} or five years – there was much debate about both the size and form of way that assistance was delivered. [...] For example, just one day after the tsunami, on 27 December 2004, UN Undersecretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs Jan Egeland reportedly categorised the contributions of rich countries as [...] "stingy". This was widely misinterpreted in the media as categorising the overall response to the tsunami whereas Mr Egeland later explained that at the time he had been making a <b>general</b> <b>remark</b> about overall global aid flows in recent years. Speaking at a press conference later Mr. Egeland said, [...] "It {{has nothing to do with}} any particular country or the response to this emergency. We are in early days and the response has so far been overwhelmingly positive". The U.S. government, led by President George W. Bush and Secretary of State Colin Powell, added another US$20 million on 28 December to the original U.S pledge of US$15 million, bringing the total up to US$35 million (not including direct aid rendered by naval vessels dispatched to the region). Initially, the U.S. Navy dispatched P-3C Orion patrol aircraft and an aircraft carrier to assist with relief operations.|$|E

60|$|I {{stopped to}} say a word to Mr. Warren, in the vestry-room, after the people were dismissed, for he had not passed the night with us at the Nest, though his {{daughter}} had. After we had said a word about the occurrence of the morning, the good rector having heard a rumor of the arrest of certain incendiaries, without knowing who they were, I made a more <b>general</b> <b>remark</b> or two previously to quitting the place.|$|E
60|$|In {{the midst}} of such replies as 'Frenchman, sir,' 'Porteghee, sir,' 'Dutchman, sir,' 'Prooshan, sir,' and other {{conflicting}} testimony, he now heard a feeble voice asking, both in Italian and in French, for water.

60|$|Here again, the raven was in {{a highly}} {{reflective}} state; {{walking up and down}} when he had dined, with an air of elderly complacency which was strongly suggestive of his having his hands under his coat-tails; and appearing to read the tombstones with a very critical taste. Sometimes, after a long inspection of an epitaph, he would strop his beak upon the grave to which it referred, and cry in his hoarse tones, 'I'm a devil, I'm a devil, I'm a devil!' but whether he addressed his observations to any supposed person below, or merely threw them off as a <b>general</b> <b>remark,</b> is matter of uncertainty.|$|E

No one is trying to tarnish this person; no one has thought of it.

I wrote to him one of my usual letters, that are compounded of all things in nature and art, and took an occasion to allude to a certain Mr. Paul Powis, with a <b>general</b> <b>remark</b> that he had formerly served, together with a particular inquiry if he knew any thing about him. All this, no doubt, you think very officious; but believe me, dear Eve, where there was as much interest as I felt and feel in you, it was very natural." ...|$|E
60|$|It was a <b>general</b> <b>remark</b> at the Bell Rock, {{as before}} noticed, that fish were never plenty in its {{neighbourhood}} excepting in good weather. Indeed, the seamen used {{to speculate about}} the state of the weather from their success in fishing. When the fish disappeared at the rock, it was considered a sure indication that a gale was not far off, as the fish seemed to seek shelter in deeper water from the roughness of the sea during these changes in the weather. At this time the rock, at high-water, was completely covered with podlies, or the fry of the coal-fish, about six or eight inches in length. The artificers sometimes occupied half an hour after breakfast and dinner in catching these little fishes, but were more frequently supplied from the boats of the tender.|$|E
6000|$|In the meantime, {{while his}} friend {{stood with his}} {{stop-watch}} in his hand, with a visage lengthened {{under the influence of}} these reflections, Sir Bingo, with an instinctive tact, which self-preservation seemed to dictate to a brain neither the most delicate nor subtle in the world, premised his enquiry by some <b>general</b> <b>remark</b> on fishing and field-sports. With all these, he found Tyrrel more than passably acquainted. Of fishing and shooting, particularly, he spoke with something like enthusiasm; so that Sir Bingo began to hold him in considerable respect, and to assure himself that he could not be, or at least could not originally have been bred, the itinerant artist which he now gave himself out--and this, with the fast lapse of the time, induced him thus to address Tyrrel.--"I say, Mr. Tyrrel--why, you have been one of us--I say"---- ...|$|E

60|$|It {{was quite}} an accident, {{and the way in}} which it came about was this. Mr Chuckster, being a gentleman of a {{cultivated}} taste and refined spirit, was one of that Lodge of Glorious Apollos whereof Mr Swiveller was Perpetual Grand. Mr Swiveller, passing through the street in the execution of some Brazen errand, and beholding one of his Glorious Brotherhood intently gazing on a pony, crossed over to give him that fraternal greeting with which Perpetual Grands are, by the very constitution of their office, bound to cheer and encourage their disciples. He had scarcely bestowed upon him his blessing, and followed it with a <b>general</b> <b>remark</b> touching the present state and prospects of the weather, when, lifting up his eyes, he beheld the single gentleman of Bevis Marks in earnest conversation with Christopher Nubbles.|$|E
60|$|The {{door had}} opened {{while they were}} talking, and Mr. Patrick McEachern had walked solidly into the room. The {{ornaments}} on the Chippendale tables jingled as he came. Secretly he was somewhat embarrassed at finding himself {{in the midst of}} so many people. He had not yet mastered the art of feeling at home in his own house. At meals he did not fear his wife's guests so much. Their attention was in a manner distributed at such times, instead of being, as now, focused upon himself. He stood there square and massive, outwardly the picture of all that was rugged and independent, looking about him for a friendly face. To offer a <b>general</b> <b>remark,</b> or to go boldly and sit down beside one of those dazzling young ladies, like some heavyweight spider beside a Miss Muffet, was beyond him. In his time he had stopped runaway horses, clubbed mad dogs, and helped to break up East Side gang fights, when the combatants on both sides were using their guns lavishly and impartially; but his courage failed him here.|$|E
60|$|It was {{observed}} by every one present that the prisoner's face betrayed traces of acute mental suffering. He was deadly pale. His eyes never once wandered {{to the crowd}} in the Court. When certain witnesses appeared against him, he looked at them with a momentary attention. At other times he kept his eyes on the ground. When the evidence touched on his wife's illness and death, he was deeply affected, and covered his face with his hands. It was a subject of <b>general</b> <b>remark</b> and general surprise that the prisoner, in this case (although a man), showed far less self-possession than the last prisoner tried in that Court for murder--a woman, who had been convicted on overwhelming evidence. There were persons present (a small minority only) who considered this want of composure {{on the part of the}} prisoner to be a sign in his favor. Self-possession, in his dreadful position, signified, to their minds, the stark insensibility of a heartless and shameless criminal, and afforded in itself a presumption, not of innocence, but of guilt.|$|E
