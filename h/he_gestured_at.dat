5000|$|In 2004, Waltrip went winless {{and dropped}} five {{spots in the}} standings. In 2005 Waltrip only had seven top tens and one pole. It {{included}} a runner up at Phoenix despite hitting the wall on the next to last lap. He had an incident with Robby Gordon at New Hampshire. After Waltrip intentionally wrecked Robby Gordon and spun as a result, Gordon furiously tried to back his damaged racecar into Waltrip's. When Gordon failed to hit Waltrip's car with his own, he climed out of his racecar and threw his helmet at Waltrip's driver side door. Waltrip repeated the words Gordon said the previous year in another helmet-tossing incident: [...] "He just threw a helmet at my car." [...] Waltrip was fined $10,000 after <b>he</b> <b>gestured</b> <b>at</b> Gordon for the damage on his car from the helmet, but he and Teresa Earnhardt appealed and the fine was overturned after a short investigation proved the charge false. Gordon however was fined $50,000 and put on probation {{for the rest of}} the year after he was discovered to have said [...] "You know everybody thinks Michael is this good guy. He's not the guy he acts he is. The caution was out, and he wrecked me, and he's a piece of shit." [...] Waltrip and Gordon conferred later on, apologized, and continued their careers. After the 2005 season, Waltrip left DEI for Bill Davis Racing.|$|E
50|$|The crowd clears {{when the}} {{policeman}} places the {{hand in the}} box previously carried by the young man and gives it to the young woman. The androgynous young woman contemplates something happily while {{standing in the middle}} of the now busy street clutching the box. She is then run over by a car and a few bystanders gather around her. The young man and the young woman watch these events unfold from the apartment window. The young man seems to take sadistic pleasure in the androgynous young woman's danger and subsequent death, and as <b>he</b> <b>gestures</b> <b>at</b> the shocked young woman in the room with him, he leers at her and grasps her breasts.|$|R
60|$|When at some {{distance}} from the multitude, the old man turned slowly round, displaying a face of antique majesty rendered doubly venerable by the hoary beard that descended on his breast. <b>He</b> made a <b>gesture</b> <b>at</b> once of encouragement and warning, then turned again and resumed his way.|$|R
500|$|While Smith {{was having}} {{problems}} with the Padres' owners, the St. Louis Cardinals also found themselves unhappy with their shortstop, Garry Templeton. [...] Templeton's relationship with Cardinal Nation had become increasingly strained and finally {{came to a head}} during a game at Busch Stadium on August 26, 1981, when (after being heckled for not running out a ground ball) <b>he</b> made obscene <b>gestures</b> <b>at</b> fans, and had to be physically pulled off the field by manager Whitey Herzog.|$|R
60|$|It was Dr. Martineau who {{presently}} {{brought this}} disquisition upon Avebury {{to a stop}} by a very remarkable <b>gesture.</b> <b>He</b> looked <b>at</b> his watch. He drew it out ostentatiously, a thick, respectable gold watch, for the doctor was {{not the sort of}} man to wear his watch upon his wrist. He clicked it open and looked at it. Thereby he would have proclaimed his belief this encounter was an entirely unnecessary interruption of his healing duologue with Sir Richmond, which must now be resumed.|$|R
50|$|Victorino's success {{carried over}} into the 2008 NLCS, as he {{continued}} to make crucial hits and defensive plays for the Phillies. In Game 2 he was 2 for 5 with 4 RBIs. After the game, Victorino was informed that his grandmother had died. Game 3 saw Victorino in the midst of controversy. After being brushed back by Hiroki Kuroda, Victorino began to gesture towards the non-English-speaking pitcher that it was alright that he throw inside, just as long as he did not do so at his head. After grounding out to second, <b>he</b> continued to <b>gesture</b> <b>at</b> Kuroda and benches from both teams cleared. Victorino quickly became the villain for Dodger fans and was booed each time he came up to bat. After the game, Victorino was fined $2,500 by the league for his part in the incident. Victorino was quick to silence the crowd during Game 4 when he hit a game-tying two run home run. In their first trip to the fall classic since 1993, the Phillies {{went on to win the}} 2008 World Series by defeating the Tampa Bay Rays.|$|R
50|$|Returning to France a lector {{of sacred}} {{theology}} Didon taught Scripture {{for a brief}} time, and in 1868 began {{a career as a}} preacher in Paris. A desire to communicate his faith to others, coupled with accomplished art, enabled him {{to make the most of}} his oratorial abilities. He had strong features, a large forehead, black eyes, a vibrating voice which he perfectly controlled, and an ease in emphasizing his words by <b>gestures.</b> <b>He</b> was <b>at</b> his best when preaching on social subjects. He delivered the funeral oration of Archbishop Georges Darboy, of Paris, who had been shot by the Communists 24 May 1871. In the following year he preached Lenten and Advent conferences in the principal churches of Paris, many of which he published.|$|R

30|$|This {{study was}} limited to {{examining}} the presence of <b>gestures</b> <b>at</b> all, ignoring important characteristics such as the rate of gestures and the particular meanings of gestures as they related to standard deviation. Our main results reveal that a sampling of easily accessible videos (as determined by the YouTube search algorithm) reveals few videos with iconic <b>gestures</b> <b>at</b> all. Future studies might examine only videos that contain hands to pursue important questions about the rate of gesture and the meaning and effectiveness of particular gestures.|$|R
