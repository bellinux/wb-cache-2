5|$|Apart from Du Tertre's crude 1667 {{drawing and}} Labat's 1722 derivative, a few {{contemporary}} paintings depict red macaws {{that may be}} the Lesser Antillean macaw. A color plate accompanying a 1765 volume of Buffon's encyclopaedia Histoire Naturelle (no. 12 in Planches Enluminées, entitled L'Ara Rouge) shows a red macaw with entirely red tail feathers and more red on the tertial and scapular feathers of the wing than are present on the scarlet macaw. Copies of the plate differ in the nuances used, but are identical in pattern. The painting suggests that a specimen may have been present in <b>Europe</b> <b>at</b> the time. The Swedish zoologist Carl Linnaeus cited the plate in his 1766 description of the scarlet macaw, but his description does not match the bird shown. A 1626 painting by the Dutch artist Roelant Savery, which also includes a dodo, shows a red macaw that agrees with the descriptions of the Lesser Antillean macaw. A second macaw in the painting may be the hypothetical extinct Martinique macaw (A. martinicus), but though many parrots were imported into <b>Europe</b> <b>at</b> the time from all over the world, it is impossible to determine the accuracy of such paintings today.|$|E

5|$|By the summer, 1940, the Chain Home radar {{stations}} {{along the}} English and Scottish coasts {{was able to}} track incoming aircraft from continental <b>Europe</b> <b>at</b> all but the lowest altitudes.

Hostility to the use of capital punishment was widespread in Western <b>Europe</b> <b>at</b> this time and most Western European countries had ceased using it.|$|E

5|$|Able {{to attack}} the HEIC ships individually, Caroline pulled {{alongside}} <b>Europe</b> <b>at</b> 06:30 and began a heavy fire into the merchant ship, which intermittently replied with her available guns. Within 30 minutes, Europes rigging was tattered, many of her guns dismounted {{and a number of}} her crew wounded or killed. Moving past his now disabled opponent, Féretier next attacked Streatham, which had slowed in an unsuccessful attempt to support Europe. Now alone against the frigate, Streatham came under heavy fire at 07:00 and by 08:00 was badly damaged, with casualties in her crew, her guns all dismounted and her lascars hiding below decks. With further resistance hopeless, Dale hauled down the company flag and surrendered.|$|E

Despite considerable damage, she was repaired and placed back in service. In late 1921, Siboney was switched to New York–Cuba–Mexico routes, which were a popular and inexpensive way for Americans to escape Prohibition. In late 1940, she was chartered to American Export Lines to return Americans fleeing <b>Europe</b> <b>at</b> the outset of World War II, making seven roundtrips from Jersey City, New Jersey, to Lisbon.|$|E
5|$|An {{analysis}} {{conducted using}} X-ray fluorescence {{has found that}} the pendant was made from a highly debased gold alloy, with only 37% of the alloy consisting of gold and the remainder consisting of silver with some copper.

The link with Francia is illustrative of the trading and cultural links that existed between Anglo-Saxon England and continental <b>Europe</b> <b>at</b> the time.|$|E
