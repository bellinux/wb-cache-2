40|$|Abstract. A novel heparan sulfate {{proteoglycan}} (HSPG) {{present in}} the extracellular matrix of rat liver has been partially characterized. Proteoglycans were purified from a high salt extract of total microsomes from rat liver and found to consist predominantly (~ 90 %) of HSPG. A polyclonal antiserum raised against this fraction specifically recognized HSPG by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting. The intact, fully glycosylated HSPG migrated as a broad smear (150 - 300 kD) by SDS-PAGE, but after deglycosylation with trifluoromethanesulfonic acid only a single ~ 40 kD band was seen.

40|$|We {{have studied}} the effect of cell density on the lateral {{diffusion}} of major histocompatibility (MHC) antigens in the plasma membranes of fibroblasts using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching. The percent recovery of fluorescence was decreased in fibroblasts grown in confluent cultures. While recovery of fluorescence was measurable in greater than 90 % of the cells from sparse cultures, measurable recovery was detected in only 60 - 80 % of the cells from dense cultures; no mobile antigens were detectable in 20 - 40 % of cells examined. The diffusion coefficient on human skin fibroblast cells that did show recovery was the same for cells grown in sparse or dense conditions. In WI- 38, VA- 2, and c 1 1 d cultures the diffusion coefficients of mobile antigens were smaller in cells from dense cultures. Changes in lateral diffusion occurred with increased cell-cell contact and with age of cell culture but were not observed in growth-arrested cells or in sparse cells cultured in medium conditioned by confluent cells. Decreased mobile fractions of MHC antigens were observed when cells were plated on <b>extracellular</b> <b>matrix</b> <b>materials</b> derived from confluent cultures. Treatment of the <b>extracellular</b> <b>matrix</b> <b>materials</b> {{with a combination of}} proteolytic enzymes or by enzymes that degrade proteoglycans abolished this effect. Matrices produced by cells from other cell lines were less effective in inducing changes in mobile fractions and purified matrix components alone did not induce changes in lateral diffusion. Finally, there were no differences in the proportion of MHC antigens that were resistant to Triton X- 100 extraction in sparse and dense cells. These results suggest that cell-cell interactions mediated through <b>extracellular</b> <b>matrix</b> <b>materials</b> can influence the lateral diffusion of {{at least part of the}} population of MHC antigens...|$|R

In addition, cytoglobin, which is the fourth globin in mammals and function as a local gas sensor, provides a new perspective on the involvement of stellate cells in fibrosis and carcinogenesis, possibly through its anti-oxidative properties and is a promising new marker that discriminates between myofibroblasts derived from stellate cells and those from portal fibroblasts...|$|R

To investigate the biological consequences of a possible autocrine modality of microvascular endothelial cell activation by endogenous bFGF in these tumors, mouse brain microvascular endothelial cells were stably transfected with a retroviral expression vector harboring a human bFGF cDNA. When grown on tissue culture plastic, bFGF-transfected clones show a transformed morphology and increased saturation density. bFGF-transfectants have an invasive behavior when seeded on three-dimensional fibrin gel and originate endothelial cell sprouts when embedded within fibrin.

In addition to collagens, {{a variety of}} non-collagenous glycoproteins such as fibronectin also accumulate in the kidney of diabetics. The effect of diabetes on degradative pathways, in particular those involving non-collagenous proteins, are relatively unexplored. In this study, we determined {{the expression of the}} major matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) responsible for degrading the non-collagenous matrix glycoprotein fibronectin. Furthermore, the modulation of these MMPs by advanced glycation end products (AGE), a key factor in the diabetic milieu, was explored. Exposure of mesangial cells to AGEs led to a significant reduction in MMP- 7, but not MMP- 3 or - 10. MMP- 7 expression was normalized by both aminoguanidine, an inhibitor of glycation product formation, or by a neutralizing anti-transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) antibody. In streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats, the diminution in MMP- 7 expression and excessive fibronectin accumulation were attenuated by aminoguanidine. Humans with type 2 diabetes and nephropathy displayed similar alterations in MMP- 7 to their rodent counterparts.

Glycosaminoglycan (GAG) metabolism is compared in secondary cultures of mouse mammary epithelial cells maintained on plastic or type I collagen gel substrates. The incorporation of 35 SO 42 - into GAG during brief labeling indicates no difference between substrates {{in the rate of}} GAG synthesis. During prolonged labeling, however, accumulation of [35 S]GAG in cultures on colllagen exceeds that of cultures on plastic. This increased accumulation is due to a markedly reduced rate of GAG degradation. GAG degradation does not occur in the medium, indicating that degradation is localized to the cells. The cultures on collagen contain a slowly degrading cell-associated [35 S]GAG pool and a ruthenium red-stained basal lamina, neither of which is present in cultures on plastic. The cell-associated [35 S]GAG in cultures on collagen is, in part, localized {{to the site of the}} ultrastructurally identified basal lamina.

Significant work has been conducted on the roles of alginate and Psl in biofilm development, however we know little regarding Pel. In this study, we demonstrate that Pel can serve two functions in biofilms. Using a novel assay involving optical tweezers, we demonstrate that Pel is crucial for maintaining cell-to-cell interactions in a PA 14 biofilm, serving as a primary structural scaffold for the community. Deletion of pelB resulted in a severe biofilm deficiency. Interestingly, this effect is strain-specific. Loss of Pel production in the laboratory strain PAO 1 resulted in no difference in attachment or biofilm development; instead Psl {{proved to be the}} primary structural polysaccharide for biofilm maturity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Pel plays a second role by enhancing resistance to aminoglycoside antibiotics. This protection occurs only in biofilm populations.

Deposition of immunoreactive thrombospondin into <b>extracellular</b> <b>matrix</b> <b>material</b> elaborated by cultured cells was more rapid in response to platelet-derived growth factor A-chain homodimer than in response to angiotensin II or transforming growth factor-β 1. Transforming growth factor-β 1 inhibited the proliferation of cultured smooth muscle cells prior to their onset of matrix elaboration in culture; however, once this had commenced, growth factor treatment resulted in the stimulation of proliferation. Angiotensin-induced endothelin production by cultured smooth muscle cells did not contribute to the stimulated synthesis of extracellular matrix glycoconjugates elicited by angiotensin II, since the composition of matrix material elaborated by cells exposed to endothelin directly was the same as controls. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

Transformed cells on collagen produce and accumulate more [3 H]collagen, yet are less effective in basement membrane formation than normal cells, indicating that the accumulation of collagen alone and the effect of interstitial collagen thereupon do not suffice.
