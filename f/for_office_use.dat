Moscow accounts for 17% of retail sales in Russia and for 13% of all construction activity in the country. Since the 1998 Russian financial crisis, business sectors in Moscow have shown exponential rates of growth. Many new business centers and office buildings have been built in recent years, but Moscow still experiences shortages in office space. As a result, many former industrial and research facilities are being reconstructed to become suitable <b>for</b> <b>office</b> <b>use.</b> Overall, economic stability has improved in recent years; nonetheless, crime and corruption continue still hinder business development.|$|E
25|$|At its peak, Broad Street was the third-busiest {{station in}} London (after Liverpool Street and Victoria). At {{the start of}} the 20th century, more than one train per minute arrived or {{departed}} Broad Street during rush hour, with over 27 million passengers in 1902. Intermediate station traffic stagnated due to bus and tram competition, and Haggerston and Shoreditch stations were closed in 1940 following bomb damage in World War II. The line remained busy up to the 1950s, receiving traffic from the East Coast main line, West Coast main line and other routes. However, it declined following the war and was closed in 1986. While Broad Street station's site was immediately sold <b>for</b> <b>office</b> <b>use,</b> becoming the Broadgate development, the route north was mothballed. The present Haggerston and Dalston Junction stations have been built next to and on the original sites, but Shoreditch High Street station is on a new alignment connecting the two routes.|$|E

5000|$|Tappenden was {{subsequently}} charged with discreditable conduct under the Ontario Police Act, which prohibits police officers from {{becoming involved in}} politics. An OPP spokesman said that Tappenden had been denied {{a leave of absence}} to run <b>for</b> <b>office</b> (<b>using</b> his vacation days instead), and that the Police Act took precedence over the Public Service Act in police matters. [...] The leaders of Ontario's Liberal and New Democratic parties defended Tappenden, and a Globe and Mail editorial opined that he should be given the right to seek public office. [...] A board dealing with civil service complaints later decided, by a vote of 2 to 1, that Tappenden had been within his rights to run <b>for</b> <b>office</b> and that the Police Act should be changed.|$|R

2500|$|The modern {{movement}} of the 1960s produced new forms of chairs: the butterfly chair (originally called the Hardoy chair), bean bags, and the egg-shaped pod chair that turns. It also introduced the first mass-produced plastic chairs such as the Bofinger chair in 1966. Technological advances led to molded plywood and wood laminate chairs, as well as chairs made of leather or polymers. Mechanical technology incorporated into the chair enabled adjustable chairs, especially <b>for</b> <b>office</b> <b>use.</b> [...] Motors embedded in the chair resulted in massage chairs.|$|E
2500|$|One {{example of}} such a machine is called a hyfrecator. This term began in 1940 as a Birtcher Corporation brandname Hyfrecator for [...] "High Frequency Eradicator", but now serves generically to {{describe}} a general class of single-electrode, non-isolated (earth-referenced) low-powered electrosurgical machines intended mainly <b>for</b> <b>office</b> <b>use.</b> An accidental circuit completion path through an earth-ground creates the danger of a burn at a site far away from the probe electrode, and for this reason single-electrode devices are used only on conscious patients who would be aware of such complications, and only on carefully insulated tables.|$|E
50|$|Prior to the 1950s open-plan offices mostly {{consisted}} of large regular rows of desks or benches where clerks, typists, or technicians performed repetitive tasks. Such designs were {{rooted in the}} work of industrial engineers or efficiency experts such as Frederick Winslow Taylor and Henry Ford. In the 1950s a German team named Quickborner developed the <b>office</b> landscape, which <b>used</b> conventional furniture, curved screens, large potted plants, and organic geometry to create work groups on large, open floors. Office landscape was quickly supplanted by office-furniture companies which developed cubicles based on panel-hung or systems furniture.

2500|$|When completed, {{the hotel}} had two grand openings–one for {{local and state}} officials, and a second for the general public. The hotel was {{supposed}} to be [...] "the hotel" [...] in Meridian, and at the beginning of its commission, it attracted business away from Hotel Meridian and the Union Hotel. With the drastic decline in business due to the Great Depression, it never reached its predicted splendor. The hotel was generally used by wealthier citizens and official visitors to the city; the general public rarely stayed in its rooms. For a short time, exhibits from the Meridian Art League were held in the hotel. These exhibits were eventually moved to the Meridian Museum of Art. The hotel was in business well into the 1950s, before being sold a number of times. The building was eventually purchased by Lauderdale County in 1969 and converted <b>for</b> <b>office</b> <b>use</b> as the Raymond P. Davis County Annex Building.|$|E
