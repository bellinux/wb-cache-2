5|$|This one <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{the most}} amount of input. I oversaw everything—the {{building}} of the sets, everyone's costumes, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> meetings with make-up and hair and the cinematographer, everybody. Casting, finding the right cat—just every aspect. Kind of like making a little movie. We basically sat down and just threw out all every idea we could possibly conceive of {{and of all the}} things we wanted. All the imagery we wanted—and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> a few set ideas, for instance the cat and the idea of Metropolis. I definitely wanted to have that influence, that look on all the men—the workers, diligently, methodically working away.|$|E
5|$|Here {{came the}} Rabbi, his back bent, his face shaved... His mere {{presence}} among the deportees added {{a touch of}} unreality to the scene. It was like a page torn from some story book... One by one they passed in front of me, teachers, friends, others, all those <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been afraid of, all those I once could have laughed at, all those <b>I</b> <b>had</b> lived with over the years. They went by, fallen, dragging their packs, dragging their lives, deserting their homes, the years of their childhood, cringing like beaten dogs.|$|E

5|$|I {{should say}} I {{wanted to write}} poetry in the {{beginning}} because <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{fallen in love with}} words. The first poems I knew were nursery rhymes and before I could read them for myself <b>I</b> <b>had</b> come to love the words of them. The words alone. What the words stood for was of a very secondary importance... I fell in love, that is the only expression I can think of, at once, and am still at the mercy of words, though sometimes now, knowing a little of their behaviour very well, I think I can influence them slightly and have even learned to beat them now and then, which they appear to enjoy. I tumbled for words at once. And, when I began to read the nursery rhymes for myself, and, later, to read other verses and ballads, I knew that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> discovered the most important things, to me, that could be ever.|$|E

Although I could not decipher their meaning, it was impossible for me to think of them as having been entirely accidental. The feeling is constantly growing on me that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been the first to hear the greeting of one planet to another.|$|E

5|$|McDowell's {{statement}} of admission {{was published in}} David McKittrick's book Lost Lives:"There was very little planning.

5|$|That week {{confined}} {{to my room}} actually saved my life. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been scheduled to go up on a gunnery flight the afternoon that I was confined.

Shortly after he took off, while {{on his way to}} the gunnery range, he developed engine trouble and had to crash-land near the Hindenburg-Kattowitz railroad. He was killed in the crash.|$|E
25|$|We had {{to create}} our own {{journals}} because {{it was impossible to}} obtain entry into the official journals of psychiatry and medicine.

25|$|Why did {{the date}} of Benjamin Britten's death – 4 December 1976 – touch such a chord in me? During this time I was {{obviously}} {{at the point where}} I could recognise the magnitude of such a loss. Inexplicable feelings of guilt, more than that even, arose in me. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> just discovered Britten for myself. Just before his death I began to appreciate the unusual purity of his music – <b>I</b> <b>had</b> had the impression of the same kind of purity in the ballads of Guillaume de Machaut. And besides, for a long time <b>I</b> <b>had</b> wanted to meet Britten personally – and now it would not come to that.|$|E

I did have a go at it, but I just didn’t have the patience. It seemed impossible to me. I decided to make do with what <b>I</b> <b>had,</b> and I made some plastic fingertips for myself.
