40|$|Abstract This paper {{presents}} {{a new approach}} which was developed to find an optimal combi nation of candidate metrics for creating a fish-based estuarine biotic index (EBI) for defining the quality status of an estuarine area. The key idea was that a powerful index should minimise two prediction errors simultaneously: <b>falsely</b> <b>declaring</b> {{the status of a}} site as disturbed while it is not (Type I error) and the reverse, <b>falsely</b> <b>declaring</b> a disturbed site as undisturbed (Type II error). The balance between both errors is an inherent characteristic of an index and can b...|$|R

5000|$|With {{an example}} of two {{declarative}} sentences, (D1) [...] "It is false" [...] and (D2) [...] "Zayd is sitting", Ṭūsī explains how one declarative sentence (D1) can declare another declarative sentence (D2) to be false: [...] "It is false that Zayd is sitting". There is no paradox in the above two declarative sentences because they have different subjects. To generate a paradox a declarative sentence must declare something about itself. If (D1) <b>falsely</b> <b>declares</b> itself to be not (D1) then this false declaration referencing to itself as being [...] "false" [...] creates a paradox.|$|R
