5|$|So much {{controversy}} has swirled around my career this past decade that very little attention <b>ever</b> <b>gets</b> paid to my music. The songs {{are all but}} forgotten. While I have no regrets regarding the choices I've made artistically, I've learned to appreciate {{the idea of doing}} things in a simpler way. So without a lot of fanfare, without any distractions, I present to you this collection of ballads. Some are old, some are new. All of them are from my heart.|$|E
5|$|Leslie (Amy Poehler) is {{organizing}} {{the making of}} a time capsule, meant to be opened 50 years in the future and filled with items that encapsulate the spirit of Pawnee. A citizen named Kelly Larson (Will Forte) comes to Leslie's office and makes a passionate plea for the Twilight books to be included. When Leslie refuses because the books have no connection to Pawnee, Kelly handcuffs himself to a pipe in her office until she reconsiders. He is able to stay several days because he brought food, water and a pillow. During his stay, Kelly notices Tom (Aziz Ansari) appears sad, and correctly deduces Tom is having romantic issues; Tom's girlfriend Lucy (Natalie Morales) has dumped him because Tom cannot get over the fact that his ex-wife, Wendy (Jama Williamson), is dating Ron (Nick Offerman). Kelly encourages Tom to read Twilight, to which he initially scoffs, but after reading them finds he loves the books. Lucy later visits Tom and tells him she still likes him, and if he <b>ever</b> <b>gets</b> past his Ron & Wendy-jealousy problems he should call her.|$|E

Writing of the incident before the media attention, he said, [...] "If this thing <b>ever</b> <b>gets</b> out, they'll be howling for Patton's scalp, {{and that will be}} the end of Georgie's service in this war. I simply cannot let that happen. Patton is indispensable to the war effort– one of the guarantors of our victory." [...] Still, following the capture of Messina in August 1943, Patton did not command a force in combat for 11 months.|$|E

500|$|The {{authors of}} the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, called it [...] "an {{unsurpassed}} episode. It's hard {{to know where to}} start dishing out the praise— Leonard Nimoy's guest appearance, the Monorail song, Marge's narration, the truck full of popcorn..." [...] Robert Canning of IGN strongly praised the episode, stating [...] "It is by far one of the most loved episodes of The Simpsons and can safely be called a classic by any fan. From beginning to end, there's joke after joke after hilarious joke. There's nothing in this half-hour that doesn't work, and {{no matter how many times}} I watch this episode, it never, <b>ever</b> <b>gets</b> old." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of Slant Magazine named it the show's best episode, stating [...] "It's the one you think of when you think of a Simpsons episode", and is [...] "maybe the show's funniest, and it most perfectly encapsulates what may be the show's overriding theme: People are really stupid and self-serving, but if you give them long enough, they'll eventually bumble toward the right answer." ...|$|E
500|$|The film {{received}} mixed {{to negative}} reviews from critics. Thomas Sutcliffe for The Independent writes that: [...] "while flight is the sustaining theme, the film never soars. The characterisation is Cluedo with pretensions, and the dialogue suspends the actors in that ungainly, undignified dangle which you associate with stage flying, the wires robbing them of all powers of independent movement." [...] While {{he describes the}} scene which culminates the lesbian storyline as [...] "radiant" [...] and [...] "beautifully acted by Vanessa Redgrave and Dorothy Tutin", he opines of the acting in general that [...] "for the most part, these people are simply Winterson's puppets, jerked around by the symbolic demands of the plot." [...] He deems Kidron's directing [...] "a kind of surrender, dutifully supplying visual equivalents for Winterson's sterile symmetries but despairing of any greater vivacity", and is particularly critical of Winterson's screenplay, noting that: [...] "everything unrolls at the same stately pace, a religious procession bearing the reliquaries of Winterson's prose. It's as though the author thinks every word is infinitely precious. She's right, though perhaps {{not in the way}} she imagines." [...] Variety′s David Rooney agrees the film's coming-out scene is a [...] "potential jewel" [...] and [...] "captivatingly played", however, in line with Sutcliffe's criticisms, opines that the film's pacing means that [...] "the scene is lobbed in and robbed of its impact". He summarises the film as [...] "a willfully theatrical, sporadically magical romantic comedy embracing three barely compatible narrative strands, not one of which <b>ever</b> <b>gets</b> full flight clearance". Rooney deems the film [...] "Damaged beyond repair by a mannered scripting style and evident recutting", and opines that [...] "Jeanette Winterson's preposterous dialogue and comic mistiming serves up more misses than hits". Of the film's major themes, he writes that: [...] "Questions about the line between truth and falsehood, genuine and fake, are too flimsily voiced to mean much. Likewise, the intro of race issues in the closing voiceover only makes the haphazard mix even more lumpy".|$|E
500|$|... "Grotesque" [...] {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics. Reviewer Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave the episode an A− {{and noted that}} while the episode is [...] "ponderous and pretentious", {{this aspect of the}} entry turns it into [...] "a benefit". VanDerWerff wrote, [...] "here's the thing: 'Grotesque' is absolutely [...] self-serious, just as much as I feared it would be. It also, unquestionably, works. The reason it works is very simple: It's pretty scary". Critical Myth's John Keegan gave the episode a largely positive review, awarding it an 8 out of 10. He noted, [...] "Overall, this is a solid effort by Howard Gordon. It’s good {{to see some of the}} methods that earned Mulder his nickname, and the underlying dynamic between Mulder and Scully is very well played. The central premise is vague enough to fall within the confines of the unusual, if not necessarily paranormal, and the supporting cinematography and score rise to the occasion." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode five stars out of five, and praised the themes of the episode, writing that, [...] "Because 'Grotesque' certainly surprises, and shocks, and even appals —this is the closest The X-Files <b>ever</b> <b>gets</b> to staring into the face of insanity." [...] Furthermore, Shearman and Pearson praised Duchovny's acting, calling it [...] "his best performance yet seen in the series". Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a positive review and awarded it three-and-a-half stars out of four. She referred to the episode as [...] "one of [...] darkest ever" [...] and called it [...] "a triumph for director Manners, cinematographer Bartley, and The X-Files art department." [...] Vitaris, however, was critical of the episode's closing monologue, noting that [...] " [...] spells out what the camera is saying a hundred times more effectively with its finale shot of a pairing of a gargoyle." [...] Jonathan Dunn, writing for What Culture, described [...] "Grotesque" [...] as a [...] "deep, dark, twisted psychological moment for The X-Files that I absolutely love" [...] and included it in the [...] "5 Episodes [...] That Could Be Made Into Movies" [...] list.|$|E

500|$|In September 2014, {{talking about}} whether {{the ending of the}} season would also be a {{satisfying}} end to the series, Bell said [...] "we're not thinking of it as a series finale as much as a season finale ... I think we have some momentum coming in [...] and I think we pick up on it. I'm optimistic that we can keep the plane in the air a little longer." [...] He also talked {{about whether the}} themes of family and connectedness from the first season would be re-explored in the second, saying [...] "What we always look for are the human elements in the big story. That's what television does well, it makes you care about people, and whether it's literal family or anytime you have a team of people working together, it takes on some sort of family metaphor." [...] Bell reiterated the idea of family following the end of the season, saying [...] "In many ways, the whole metaphor {{at the heart of the}} show is family—you've got Coulson and May and then a bunch of younger people, and it allows us to play out different dynamics; literally, this season, we had Skye's biological parents versus her surrogate parents. And at the same time, we had Skye growing up. We had her going from a slightly sulky hacker season one to training to become an agent to becoming our first full-fledged superhero and so as we grow up, we separate from our parents... In our minds, her mom wasn't a villain so much; she was an antagonist, but if you look at why she feels the way she does, Jiaying really earned that position." [...] Discussing the reveal that Skye is actually Daisy Johnson, Maurissa Tancharoen explained thatJohnson is a character that we always liked. We always knew there was a potential to evolve Skye into something else. It took a little bit of time, but we were happy when we were able to land on Daisy Johnson, and actually have that work in our mythology. But as with everything that we do on the show, we pull from the properties, and we do our own spin to it. So we are kind of merging a few concepts and storylines. We've spent a season and a half with Skye. We've seen her evolve as a person, we've grown to like her as a person, we've seen her evolve as an agent. And now, finally bringing her to her origin story—I think there's just a lot more emotional weight to it, because you already know her as just Skye, and now she will have this ability that she may not understand, that she may not want ... We're going to focus on Skye, and how that affects the people around her, and how the relationships may shift. Because we've seen through the course of our series so far; we've spoken about how S.H.I.E.L.D. treats gifteds or views them, and they're categorized, things like that. What does that mean when one of your own is now considered someone with an ability? How do you categorize her?Whedon elaborated that [...] "We're going to walk her through the steps of discovering what this really means, and coming to terms with it. All that stuff is really interesting to us, and in television, because we have time to explore, we can take her origin on all sorts of different paths." [...] Additionally, Whedon talked about how the character would be referred to on the show after the reveal, saying, [...] "She's still Skye, because she thinks she's Skye. I think her dad thinks she's Daisy, and we'll see if she <b>ever</b> <b>gets</b> to the point where she believes that that's something that she would want to call herself. But right now, she has her own identity." ...|$|E
2500|$|Iris's bright {{surface and}} small {{distance}} from the Sun make it the fourth-brightest object in the asteroid belt after Vesta, Ceres, and Pallas. [...] It has a mean opposition magnitude of +7.8, {{comparable to that of}} Neptune, and can easily be seen with binoculars at most oppositions. At typical oppositions it marginally outshines the larger though darker Pallas. But at rare oppositions near perihelion Iris can reach a magnitude of +6.7 (next time on October 31, 2017 reaching a magnitude of +6.9), which is as bright as Ceres <b>ever</b> <b>gets.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The show made self-deprecating {{references}} to the theme music controversy in the episode [...] "Mr. Monk and the TV Star", where obsessed fan Marci Maven and Sharona both express distaste for the new theme music to a CSI parody called Crime Lab: SF. In the epilogue of the story, Marci implores Monk to promise her that he will never change the theme music if he <b>ever</b> <b>gets</b> his own show. When Monk agrees to the promise (only so he {{can go back to}} bed), the original music is heard as the scene fades to credits, and it plays through the credits.|$|E

[...] He further explained that some of the tracks finish prematurely, [...] "like actual cues in older soundtracks where they've been ripped out of much longer original masters that nobody <b>ever</b> <b>gets</b> to hear." [...] Sandison described Tomorrow's Harvests final track, [...] "Semena Mertvykh", as having [...] "a deliberate feeling of complete futility." [...] However, he later claimed that the album was [...] "loaded with patterns and messages" [...] and that the duo used more subliminals on Tomorrow's Harvest than they had on their previous studio albums.|$|E
2500|$|By 1917, Bomeisler had {{recovered}} sufficiently from his injury to {{enlist in the}} U.S. Army following the entry of the United States into World War I. [...] After initial training at Plattsburgh, New York, Bomeisler was assigned to Camp Upton at Yaphank on Long Island, where he also played on the camp's football team along with former Harvard football star Bob Storer. [...] Bomeisler' photograph, practicing a bayonet charge, was published under the headline, [...] "His Football Training Will Stand Him In Good Stead Now." [...] The article noted: [...] "If Bomeisler <b>ever</b> <b>gets</b> a chance for action he, no doubt, will account for {{a few of the}} enemy.

2500|$|Initial {{critical}} reaction to Q: Are We Not Men? A: We Are Devo! was somewhat mixed. Tom Carson, writing in Rolling Stone, claimed that [...] "There's not {{an ounce of}} feeling anywhere, and the only commitment is to the distancing aesthetic of the put-on", and opined that [...] "Devo lacks most of Eno's warmth and much of Bowie's flair for mechanized melodrama. For all its idiosyncrasies, the music here is utterly impersonal." [...] Critic Robert Christgau of The Village Voice gave the album a positive rating of a B+, but noted, [...] "In small doses it's as good as novelty music <b>ever</b> <b>gets,</b> and there isn't a really bad cut on this album. But it leads nowhere." [...] Nonetheless, it was voted {{one of the best}} albums {{of the year in the}} Village Voices [...] Pazz & Jop critics poll for 1978. In January 1980, Trouser Press also named it one of the best albums of 1978.|$|E

2500|$|Executive Producer Santer said, [...] "With all {{the turmoil}} facing the Mitchells this year, {{it feels like}} a great time to bring back Sam, the {{original}} Mitchell sister. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank Kim Medcalf for her great work playing Sam Mitchell for three years and welcome Danniella back to pick up the baton once again." [...] In an interview with media website Digital Spy, Santer discussed the reasoning behind his decision to reintroduce Sam: [...] "What makes Sam interesting for me is that she's Ricky's first love and first wife. As Bianca and Ricky spend more time together [...] the inevitability of them at some point coming together increases. What's stopping them? Well, it's Sam. Sam and Ricky had a good thing going all those years ago. All Ricky <b>ever</b> <b>gets</b> off Bianca is indifference, whereas Sam - and who knows quite why - is less than indifferent towards him and it makes a nice change".|$|E
2500|$|The A.V. Club {{called the}} album a [...] "guilty pleasure" [...] in their mixed review, adding [...] " [...] When {{you get down}} to it, the samples and interludes on Zombie's solo debut, Hellbilly Deluxe, are merely window {{dressing}} for compact, overdriven, anthemic money shots like 'Superbeast', 'Demonoid Phenomenon', and 'Living Dead Girl'." [...] In their 2010 review of the album, Bloody Disgusting wrote [...] "Putting aside the futuristic sounds and crisp production, everything about the album screamed out vintage horror. I imagined creepy black and white laboratories where glass vials and tubes bubbled with menacing liquids. I pictured a dark night where clouds slowly moved past a full moon. I envisioned foggy forests where tree branches looked like skeleton arms. With that kind of atmosphere, the album already felt like a fine wine: aged and more enjoyable for it." [...] They later criticized the length of the album, and claimed that some songs felt like [...] "filler" [...] tracks. PopStops also praised the album, writing [...] "This is an album that rarely <b>ever</b> <b>gets</b> out of overdrive. Zombie growls his lyrics over a bed of car crash crunching guitars and pounding industrial rhythms. No surf music here." ...|$|E
