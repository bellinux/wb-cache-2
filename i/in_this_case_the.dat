5|$|A few {{different}} animals establish commensal {{interactions with}} L.gigas, {{which means that}} both organisms maintain a relationship that benefits (the commensal) species but not the other (<b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>case,</b> <b>the</b> queen conch).

5|$|A {{good example}} of {{convergence}} in plants is the evolution of edible fruits such as apples. These pomes incorporate (five) carpels and their accessory tissues forming the apple's core, surrounded by structures from outside the botanical fruit, the receptacle or hypanthium. Other edible fruits include other plant tissues; for example, the fleshy part of a tomato is {{the walls of the}} pericarp. This implies convergent evolution under selective pressure, <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>case</b> <b>the</b> competition for seed dispersal by animals through consumption of fleshy fruits.|$|E
