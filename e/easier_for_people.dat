In terms of urban planning and use, two-way traffic improves circulation within the area. The city wanted to improve downtown as a destination, rather than a place to pass through. The council also want to have downtown St. Catharines on the Wine Route, a driving tour of Niagara wineries and an Ontario Wine Council initiative to boost the number of visitors to the region's many wineries. The Wine Route was modified to officially redirect winery goers through the downtown starting in 2012. The first phase of two-way traffic was completed in 2009, with St. Paul and King streets being converted. The cost of the conversion was $3.5million and was shared with Niagara Region. In 2012, most observers concluded that the change had achieved its goals; it garnered national media attention.|$|E

[...] These commands can vary greatly and control almost every application of the phone. The commands given {{do not have to}} be specific and can be used with natural language. Siri can be accessed by holding down the home button for a short amount of time (compared to using the regular function). An impact of Siri, as shown by Apple video messages, is that it is much <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> <b>people</b> to use device functions while driving, exercising, or when they have their hands full. It also means people with trouble reading, seeing, or typing can access the phone more easily.|$|E

As Lord Chief Justice, Mansfield had {{done much to}} reform the way the courts worked, making it <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> <b>people</b> {{to gain access to}} legal aid, and also making the process much less expensive. He was also noted for his insistence that equity should be applied by all courts, not just the Court of Chancery, a view that provoked much disagreement during his lifetime, but was eventually confirmed by Parliament in the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873, which allowed all courts to take cases of equity. He also established the principle that rather than blindly following precedent, judges should seek to find loopholes in rules that were no longer applicable, something that later received the support of Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., who said, [...] "It is revolting to have no better reason for a rule of law than that so it was laid down in the time of Henry IV. It is more revolting still if the grounds upon which it was laid down have vanished long since, and the rule simply persists from blind imitation of the past." [...] He made his judgements on the principle that [...] "as the usages of society alter, the law must adapt itself to the various situations of mankind", leading John Baker to describe him as [...] "one of the boldest of judicial spirits".|$|E

500|$|Seth navigates {{the city}} on foot—cars, bicycles, and public {{transportation}} rarely even appear–as he talks with friends or rifles through used book shops. [...] For literary theorist Barbara Postema, the character fits the archetype of Walter Benjamin's flâneur—the wandering urban pedestrian {{out of touch with}} his own time and obsessed with the past. [...] Seth pines for a past not his own and obsessively collects consumer items from earlier in the 20th century. [...] His focus is primarily on the period from the 1930s to the 1950s, a time he feels particularly [...] "Canadian". [...] He goes as far as to wear an old-fashioned overcoat and broad-rimmed hat, for which passing teenagers taunt him, saying he looks like Clark Kent or Dick Tracy. [...] He declares to Chester: [...] "I do think life was simpler then... <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> <b>people</b> to find personal happiness." [...] Brown disagrees, saying, [...] "I think it's always been difficult for people to be happy." [...] Seth dreads the future and allows his memories of childhood to dominate his thoughts, but recognizes and criticizes his own obsessions: [...] "There's something in the decay of old things that provokes an evocative sadness for the vanished past. [...] If those buildings were perfectly preserved it wouldn't be the same." [...] Despite this consciousness, he continues to pursue his collecting.|$|E
