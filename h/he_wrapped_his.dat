His subordinate Pang De slew Guo Yuan and they defeated the enemy.|$|E
500|$|Walker is {{best remembered}} {{for a pair}} of one-handed catches he made in 2001. [...] Prior to the 2002 NFL Draft, Baltimore Ravens Senior vice {{president}} of football operations, Ozzie Newsome referred to Walker's collegiate catches as some of the best catches he has seen in college in a long time. [...] One of the one-handed catches was a touchdown catch {{in the back of the}} end zone against the Iowa Hawkeyes football team in a 32–26 comeback from a 21–7 deficit on October 27, 2001. [...] The Post-Standard, Walker's hometown newspaper, described his grab in the Iowa game this way: [...] "There he was in the corner of the end zone, as two Iowa defensive backs stalked him like [...] [...] The ball, delivered high and wide, seemed an improbable stretch, an impossible goal. [...] And yet, as it spiraled toward him, Marquise Walker leaped and lifted his right arm. [...] His fingertips grazed the leather and tipped it skyward.

2500|$|Ha had {{previously}} heard of Master Leng’s ability to tear at {{the flesh of}} his opponents with his bare hands, so <b>he</b> <b>wrapped</b> <b>his</b> torso with a leather strap prior to the fight. [...] Both men met on the lei tai some time later and signed a contract that stated the fight could end in death. [...] The crowd watched as both initiated combat. [...] After a few moments, Leng (apparently seeing the leather straps through his ripped clothing) bypassed Ha’s armor by forcing his hand {{down from the top}} of the wrap and tore out the triad boss’ bowels. [...] When Ha fell dead to the stage, his men tried attacking Leng to exact revenge, but the local police quickly arrested Leng to protect him. He was eventually set free.|$|E

60|$|Their {{fire was}} {{heaviest}} on the British right, where Wolfe himself led the charge, {{at the head}} of the Louisbourg Grenadiers.

60|$|Having eaten, however, he {{felt more}} like his normal self--more {{conscious}} of his actions.

The snow was falling in thin close flakes, and a biting north-easterly wind was blowing those flakes into his face and down his collar. <b>He</b> <b>wrapped</b> <b>his</b> cloak tightly around him.

"He had {{not gone}} far before he {{realised}} that the cautions which had been impressed upon him by the landlord, and {{which he had been}} inclined to look upon as self-interested advice, were only too well justified.

5000|$|Kerrang! {{published}} two {{reviews of}} Rogues Gallery in 1985.

[...] So saying she led him into a room, in which he found the Earl seated near the fireplace, and wrapped in furs.

60|$|He laid {{hold of her}} {{arm with}} rude, {{powerful}} clutch. One pull drew her sliding half {{out of the saddle}} into his arms. She fell with her breast against his, not wholly free of stirrups or horse, and there she hung, utterly powerless. Maddened, writhing, she tore to release herself. All she could accomplish was to twist herself, raise herself high enough to see his face. That almost paralyzed her. Did he mean to kill her? Then <b>he</b> <b>wrapped</b> <b>his</b> arms around her and crushed her tighter, closer to him. She felt the pound of his heart; her own seemed to have frozen. Then he pressed his burning lips to hers. It was a long, terrible kiss. She felt him shake.|$|E
60|$|The boy obeyed with alacrity, {{while the}} other, hastening his movements, began to skin the bear.

The warmth of the bearskin, however, restored him a little, and Cheenbuk, sitting down beside him, took his head upon his lap, and tried to shelter him from the storm, which had burst forth and was raging furiously by that time--fine snow filling the atmosphere, while the wind drove it in huge volumes up the valley.|$|E
