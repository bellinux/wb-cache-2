5|$|I was {{as student}} in the sixties, engaged {{in the civil rights}} movement, anti-Vietnam War protests. I'd come from New York to attend the University of Wisconsin. It was an {{exciting}} time. A lot of active students wound up in different cities and communities as organizers. I chose Racine, Wisconsin. I spent three years there. We had developed a legal clinic and we had a whole health program, but the city was too small. I had, of course, heard about Uptown in Chicago, and the challenges. So I wound up here in 1976. <b>I</b> <b>waited</b> tables. I did photography, took pictures for attorneys. Ultimately we started our own print shop in order to print our own newspapers and magazines.|$|E

He wanted his brother to win. <b>I</b> <b>waited</b> a bit and then I attacked and I caught him and the break. Then I went off by myself. I {{was going to win}} Paris–Roubaix. At the entrance to the vélodrome, there were crowds everywhere, blocking the way. I looked around for where to go and I was directed round the outside wall of the track, to where the team cars had to park. It wasn't like nowadays, when there's television and everything. Then it was more chaotic and the whole road was blocked. People said I should have known the way into the track. But how do you know a thing like {{that at the end of}} Paris–Roubaix, when you've raced all day over roads like that? A gendarme signalled the way to go and that's the way I went.|$|E

500|$|On 24 June, Pirlo {{produced}} a Man of the Match {{performance in the}} quarter-finals against England, as Italy won 4–2 on penalties after the game had finished 0–0 in extra time. Pirlo scored in the shoot-out with an audacious chipped penalty down {{the centre of the}} goal, also known as a Panenka. Following the match Pirlo spoke of his eloquent penalty, stating, [...] "At the moment I saw the goalkeeper making strange movements, so <b>I</b> <b>waited</b> for him to move and hit it like that... It was easier for me to chip it at that stage. Maybe my effort put some pressure on England." [...] Pirlo completed more passes than the entire England midfield, as he managed 131 passes, the most of any player during the match, and the second most in a single match {{in the history of the}} European Championship, behind Xavi, with an 87% pass completion rate, as Italy finished the match with 63% ball possession. He also ran 11.58 kilometres throughout the match, covering more distance than any England player.|$|E
500|$|McEntire {{made her}} first {{recordings}} for Mercury on January 22, 1976, when she released her debut single. Upon its release that year, [...] "I Don't Want to Be a One Night Stand" [...] failed {{to become a}} major hit on the Billboard country music chart, peaking at number 88 in May. She completed her second recording session September 16, which included the production of her second single, [...] "(There's Nothing Like The Love) Between a Woman and Man", which reached only number 86 in March 1977. [...] She recorded a third single that April, [...] "Glad <b>I</b> <b>Waited</b> Just for You", which reached number 88 by August. That same month, Mercury issued her self-titled debut album. The album was a departure from any of McEntire's future releases, as it resembled the material of Tanya Tucker and Tammy Wynette, according to AllMusic reviewer Greg Adams. The album itself did not chart the Billboard Top Country Albums chart upon its release. After releasing two singles with Jacky Ward ("Three Sheets in the Wind" [...] b/w [...] "I'd Really Love to See You Tonight"; and [...] "That Makes Two of Us" [...] at No. 20 and No. 26, respectively), Mercury issued her second studio album in 1979, Out of a Dream. The album's cover of Patsy Cline's [...] "Sweet Dreams" [...] became McEntire's first Top 20 hit, reaching No. 19 on the Billboard country chart in November 1979.|$|E

2500|$|Brian and Patrick {{continued}} to combat homophobia in the NHL after Brendan's death; Patrick, along with Brian Kitts and Glenn Witman, founded You Can Play {{as a tribute}} to his brother. The name You Can Play originates from a piece Patrick Burke wrote for outsports.com. In the piece, Patrick talks about the overwhelmingly positive experience surrounding Brendan's coming out: [...] "I waited to get a negative email, or to read a damning article, or to hear a snide comment at a game. <b>I</b> <b>waited,</b> and <b>I</b> <b>waited,</b> and I waited…and I got what I should have expected the entire time: love, support, and admiration." [...] He talks of letters and emails that poured in to his family, and he also talks of fellow scouts and hockey personnel pulling him aside and giving their support. He summarizes his feelings in the revelation that across the hockey world, what matters is whether or not you can play. [...] "If you can play, we welcome you." [...] The quote was adapted to the catchier [...] "If you can play, you can play" [...] by the campaign.|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to his career as an entertainer, Jones' other first love was horses. Training as a jockey in his teens, Jones later said, [...] "I made one huge mistake.

Everyone makes mistakes in life and for me that was the biggest." [...] He held an amateur rider's licence and rode in his first race at Newbury in Berkshire, England for trainer Toby Balding.|$|E

"I {{was reading}} a {{magazine}} as <b>I</b> <b>waited</b> my turn at a barber shop one day when, triggered by a particular article and the photographs that went with it, there floated up out of some hitherto unexplored subcellar of me a character who was to dominate {{my life as a}} writer for the next six years and more. He was a plump, bald, ebullient southerner who had once served five years in a prison on a charge of exposing himself before a group of children and was now the head of a religious diploma mill in Florida and of a seedy, flat-roofed stucco church called the Church of Holy Love, Incorporated. He wore a hat that looked too small for him. He had a trick eyelid that {{every once in a while}} fluttered shut on him. His name was Leo Bebb." ...|$|E
2500|$|Wes Craven {{said his}} {{inspiration}} for the basis of Freddy Krueger's power stemmed from several stories in the Los Angeles Times about a series of mysterious deaths: All the victims had reported recurring nightmares and died in their sleep. Additionally, Craven's original script characterized Freddy as a child molester, which Craven said was the [...] "worst thing" [...] he could think of. The {{decision was made to}} instead make him a child murderer in order to avoid being accused of exploiting the spate of highly publicized child molestation cases in California around the time A Nightmare on Elm Street went into production. Craven's inspirations for the character included a bully from his school during his youth, a disfigured homeless man who had frightened him when he was 11, and the 1970s pop song [...] "Dream Weaver" [...] by Gary Wright. In an interview, he said, [...] "When I looked down there was a man very much like Freddy walking along the sidewalk. He must have sensed that someone was looking at him and stopped and looked right into my face. He scared the living daylights out of me, so I jumped back into the shadows. <b>I</b> <b>waited</b> and waited to hear him walk away. Finally I thought he must have gone, so I stepped back to the window. The guy was not only still looking at me but he thrust his head forward as if to say, 'Yes, I'm still looking at you.' The man walked towards the apartment building's entrance. I ran through the apartment to our front door as he was walking into our building on the lower floor. I heard him starting up the stairs. My brother, who is ten years older than me, got a baseball bat and went out to the corridor but he was gone." ...|$|E
