His family, hoping he will change, <b>does</b> <b>nothing.</b> However, one day, he hears two servants whispering about him not having a wife, so he decides to find a talented, rich, and beautiful witch and marry her to gain everyone's envy.|$|E

If it uses Russian or certain Eastern European languages, Fusob <b>does</b> <b>nothing.</b> Otherwise, it proceeds on to lock the device and demand ransom.

5|$|If {{a runner}} {{advances}} because the defense <b>does</b> <b>nothing</b> {{to try to}} stop the advance, the scorer may rule that the advance was due to defensive indifference and no stolen base is credited. However, a throw is not required for a stolen base. If a fielder begins to visibly make an attempt to prevent an advance but then elects not to throw, the advance is not due to defensive indifference.|$|E

5|$|It is {{not clear}} what portion of the statute the Court upholds since it {{expressly}} refuses to decide whether the dues prohibition and fund administration provisions are valid. Section 93(b) <b>does</b> <b>nothing</b> more than impose those two restrictions on unions whose officials are disqualified under the criteria set forth in § 86. It does not, by its terms, provide a mechanism for disqualifying any union officer. Therefore, while it appears that the Court holds that a State is free to disqualify certain individuals from acting as union officials {{as long as it does}} not impose sanctions on the union itself, it {{is not clear}} that anything in § 93(b) enables the State to do that.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Marge and Lisa {{arrive at}} the beach, but {{discover}} {{that the ability to}} help the animals is reserved for celebrities, who are already doing the job. The two are put to work cleaning rocks, and soon abandon the job and drive home. While picking up Bart, Homer learns about {{the true nature of the}} burlesque house, but <b>does</b> <b>nothing</b> about Bart working there. Principal Skinner visits the house and sees Bart as the door greeter. He reports it to the Lovejoys and the Flanders, who confront Homer about the matter. Homer declares that he has no problem with Bart working there just as Marge returns home unexpectedly.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} is outdoor learning. Program leaders believe that the outdoors environment provides a context for learning that is physically demanding and entirely different from that experienced every day at home and in school. The outdoors stimulates new ways of thinking and approaching both task- and group-related problems. As participants learn they can exceed what they perceive to be their physical limits, they find their mental capacity also grows. White Stag uses the physical environment to tire the individual and open their minds to new ways of thinking. The program <b>does</b> <b>nothing</b> indoors that can be done outdoors, and encourages physical fitness through outdoor activities. Using the outdoors avoids the negative association of a standard classroom environment.|$|E

5|$|Shakespeare {{borrowed}} {{the character of}} Banquo from Holinshed's Chronicles, a history of Britain published by Raphael Holinshed in 1587. In Chronicles Banquo is an accomplice to Macbeth {{in the murder of}} the king, rather than a loyal subject of the king who is seen as an enemy by Macbeth. Shakespeare may have changed this aspect of his character to please King James, who was thought at the time to be a descendant of the real Banquo. Critics often interpret Banquo's role in the play as being a foil to Macbeth, resisting evil where Macbeth embraces it. Sometimes, however, his motives are unclear, and some critics question his purity. He <b>does</b> <b>nothing</b> to accuse Macbeth of murdering the king, even though he has reason to believe Macbeth is responsible.|$|E
5|$|With {{the release}} of WWE SmackDown! vs. Raw 2006 was the {{inclusion}} of a stamina system, which was a measure of the superstars' stamina. The stamina system was measured by a meter on the HUD; the meter decreased when performing a variety of moves. The meter increases, however, when the player <b>does</b> <b>nothing</b> with the superstar or holds down a selected button that increased the stamina, which varied depending on the player's system. When the superstar's stamina was low, the wrestler reacted by moving slower when performing moves, walking, and running. If the meter decreased completely, the superstar fell to the ground until the meter increased. This system is disabled by default for WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2008 and was disabled until 2K took over the series, with 2K16.|$|E

Tobias is the more concerned parent when Julia becomes hysterical, although he <b>does</b> <b>nothing</b> but ask Agnes to console her. It is Tobias who takes the gun away from his daughter, and it is Tobias to whom Julia apologizes for her outburst.|$|E

25|$|In early 2004, a glitch at Amazon.com {{revealed}} that Dave Eggers (of McSweeney’s and The Believer magazine) had posted an anonymous response to reviews he believed were posted by ULA members (as {{reported by the}} New York Times). David Eggers suggested that a series of negative reviews at amazon.com {{were the result of}} ULA members retaliating against an article about them in The Believer. As a policy, the ULA <b>does</b> <b>nothing</b> anonymously, and says the negative reviews were not posted by members of the ULA.|$|E
25|$|After the vacuous traveller, an idle lord appears, yawning {{with the}} pain of sitting on an easy chair. He <b>does</b> <b>nothing</b> at all. Immediately after him, Annius speaks. He is the natural {{predator}} for idling nobles, for he is a forger of antiquities (named for Annio di Viterbo) who teaches the nobles to value their false Roman coins above their houses and their forged Virgil manuscripts above their own clothing. He serves Dulness by teaching her servants to vaunt their stupidity with their wealth.|$|E

25|$|Miss Mary Crawford: The {{pretty and}} charming sister of Mr Crawford and Mrs Grant, {{who takes a}} keen {{interest}} in Edmund Bertram in spite of his being a second son.

She is aware of her brother Henry's plan to toy with Fanny's heart, but <b>does</b> <b>nothing</b> to discourage him or warn Fanny. Fanny believes her to be driven primarily by mercenary considerations.|$|E
25|$|Anti-Semitism, {{like all}} forms of racism, distorts the truth {{in order to put}} a whole race of people in a bad light. This film <b>does</b> <b>nothing</b> of the sort. It draws out from the {{historical}} objectivity of the Gospel narratives sentiments of forgiveness, mercy, and reconciliation. It captures the subtleties and the horror of sin, as well as the gentle power of love and forgiveness, without making or insinuating blanket condemnations against one group. This film expressed the exact opposite, that learning from the example of Christ, there should never be any more violence against any other human being.|$|E

2500|$|For {{what we have}} to keep in mind is {{that the}} mother and the unborn child are not like two tenants in a small house, which has, by unfortunate mistake, been rented to both: the mother owns the house.
