Total phospholipid content was higher in CaM (0. 503 mM) and lower in MM (0. 101 mM) compared to HM (0. 324 mM) or CoM (0. 265 mM).

40|$|A {{study was}} {{performed}} {{to determine if the}} addition of a <b>fortifier</b> to expressed breast milk (EBM) affected gastric emptying in low birthweight infants. Using ultrasonography, the gastric emptying of EBM alone was compared with that containing a <b>fortifier,</b> in a blind, crossover study. Twenty two low birthweight infants were studied: median (range) gestation 31. 5 weeks (28 - 37); birthweight 1495 g (1000 - 2480 g). The gastric antral cross-sectional area (ACSA) was measured by ultrasonography before each feed and then sequentially after its completion until the ACSA returned to its pre-feed value.

The mean difference (standard error) between half emptying times for EBM alone and for EBM with added <b>fortifier</b> was not significant: 1. 48 (4. 9) minutes.

40|$|AIM—To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} fortification on the osmolality of human milk.  METHODS—The osmolality of 47 samples of human milk was determined at baseline, just after, and 24 hours after supplementation with five different human milk <b>fortifiers</b> (HMF) at 4 °C.  RESULTS—Ten minutes after HMF supplementation the osmolality of human milk {{was significantly higher than}} the sum of the respective values of HMF dissolved in water and human milk, measured separately at baseline (p< 0. 0001), {{with the exception of the}} HMF containing only proteins. After 24 hours a further increase in osmolality was observed. Linear regression analysis showed that total dextrin content (r= 0. 84) was the main determinant of the increase.  CONCLUSIONS—Human milk and HMF interact to induce a rapid increase in osmolality higher than would be expected from composition alone. This rise could be explained by the amylase activity of human milk, inducing hydrolysis of the dextrin content of HMF, leading to small osmotically active molecules of oligosaccharides. The high osmolality of fortified human milk should be considered in the nutritional management of preterm infants. ...|$|R

In this study, the textural, rheological, microstructural and volatile aroma compound release properties of non-fat stirred yoghurts with varying CN: WP were compared. Yoghurts were manufactured using different <b>fortifiers</b> (whey protein isolate, sodium caseinate, low-heat skim milk powder) to achieve varying CN: WP at total protein levels of 4, 4. 5 and 5 %. At all protein levels, yoghurts with lower CN: WP were firmer and stiffer than those with higher CN: WP. Yield stress of gels increased when the CN: WP deviated from the unfortified CN: WP, 3. 2 : 1. Samples with low CN: WP also had a more elastic gel at 4. 5 and 5 % total protein. Alteration of CN: WP did not significantly alter volatile aroma compound release from yoghurts. The results demonstrate that CN: WP, and not only total protein or total solids, is an essential consideration when formulating non-fat stirred yoghurts with acceptable qualities.
