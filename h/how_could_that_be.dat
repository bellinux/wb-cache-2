6000|$|... "Good heavens!" [...] cried Elizabeth; [...] "but <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>that</b> <b>be?</b> How could {{his will}} be disregarded? Why {{did you not}} seek legal redress?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But whose spirit? Whose?" [...] I persisted. [...] "When I am {{here alone}} in the garden, why, it is just peace. <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>that</b> <b>be,</b> if an evil spirit haunted here?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am sure Sir Magnus {{will not}} care for our coming now. Besides, <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>that</b> <b>be</b> {{retiring}} into private life? Sir Magnus, as ambassador, has his house always full of company." ...|$|E
5000|$|Play the part: Remember {{to be as}} you write, scholarly, literate, {{practically}} a god. You must understand that when you seem smart, when you seem to believe in yourself, others will do the same, because, <b>how</b> <b>could</b> someone <b>that</b> <b>is</b> so smart and so pompous be wrong? ...|$|R
60|$|Mr. Ferrars {{caught her}} meaning, {{and the next}} moment had leaped over the gutter, and splashed into the water meadow, but in utter {{hopelessness}} of being beforehand with the runaway steed! <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>that</b> gate <b>be</b> other than fatal? The horse was nearing it--the pursuer far behind--Mr. Ferrars not half way over the fields.|$|R
6000|$|Von Bork {{shook his}} head. [...] "I don't see <b>how</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be.</b> There is a {{definite}} treaty there. She could never recover from such a humiliation." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "To Woodstock Lodge, to {{look after}} my uncle's property," [...] {{answered}} Markham Everard: [...] "I am informed that soldiers have taken possession--Yet <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>that</b> <b>be</b> if thou foundest the party drinking in Woodstock?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, poor child!" [...] said I; [...] "no {{doubt it}} must have been sick, and being a burden, has been left behind. But stay. <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>that</b> <b>be</b> {{possible}} if it was found between the camp and this village?" ...|$|E
6000|$|But how {{was this}} aid to be procured? From the {{surgeons}} of the French fleet, which probably still {{lay in the}} bay of Nukuheva, it might easily have been obtained, could I have made my case known to them. But <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>that</b> <b>be</b> effected? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But these {{stones are}} all shaped," [...] said {{the father of}} the family. [...] "It is {{difficult}} to see <b>how</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> have <b>been</b> done without something harder than stone." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Six out and six back. Nothing simpler. You say {{yourself}} <b>that</b> {{the horse}} <b>was</b> fresh and glossy {{when you got}} in. <b>How</b> <b>could</b> it <b>be</b> <b>that</b> if it had gone twelve miles over heavy roads?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But <b>how</b> <b>could</b> it <b>be</b> <b>that</b> Job Lord {{would be}} allowed to choose a {{prisoner}} from among those taken at Breed's hill?" [...] Archie continued in bewilderment, and I cried, eyeing the prisoner sharply all the while: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "For twenty years!" [...] I exclaimed. [...] "Oh, Jack, {{you must}} be wrong; for <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>that</b> <b>be?</b> I was only {{eighteen}} when all this happened. How could my real father have been twenty years away from me, when I was only eighteen, and I remember him so perfectly?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My lord," [...] said Braid-Beard, {{waving his}} pipe, {{this thing is}} just as I say. Imbedded in amber, do we not find little fishes' fins, porpoise- teeth, sea-gulls' beaks and claws; nay, butterflies' wings, and {{sometimes}} a topaz? And <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>that</b> <b>be,</b> unless the substance was first soft? Amber is gold-fishes' brains, I say." ...|$|E
6000|$|Certainly, {{whether you}} think this true or not, St. John thought it true; for he says so most {{positively}} in the text. He says that the Life was manifested--showed plainly upon earth, {{and that he had}} seen it. And he says that he saw it in a man, whom his eyes had seen, and his hands had handled. <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>that</b> <b>be?</b> ...|$|E
5000|$|During a 1992 Vanity Fair interview, Nicholson stated, [...] "I don't {{believe in}} God now. I can still work up an envy {{for someone who}} has a faith. I can see <b>how</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> a deeply {{soothing}} experience." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't quite {{understand}} <b>how</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be.</b> Even if the hail has almost spoiled the crop, {{you have the}} men, and it won't cost you any more if you keep them busy saving {{as much of it}} as is possible." ...|$|R
3000|$|Initially Lean {{was popular}} within {{production}} companies, but during recent years many public organisations have also become highly {{interested in the}} method, {{and it has been}} introduced to the healthcare system as well. But is it possible to use a production system from industry in the hospital sector? A system on a large scale trying to standardise and depersonalise production, taking away the normal personal variance in how we do things. <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>that</b> possibly <b>be</b> used in diagnosing and treating the great variety of human diseases? [...]...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh!" [...] he exclaimed; {{on which}} she saw how much, how hopelessly he was afraid. She had {{supposed}} at the café that it was of his rebellion, of his gathering motive; but <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>that</b> <b>be</b> when his temptations--that temptation for example of the train they had just lost--were after all so slight? Mrs. Wix was right. He was afraid of his weakness--of his weakness.|$|E
60|$|My father enacted that {{he should}} be treated as usual. But <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>that</b> <b>be</b> when papa himself did not know how changed were his own ways from his kindly {{paternal}} air of confidence? All trust had been undermined, so that Clarence could not cross the threshold without being required to state his object, and, if he overstayed the time calculated, he was cross-examined, and his replies received with a sigh of doubt.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{never thought}} of it, but why not?" [...] asked Leo quietly. [...] "Do you {{remember}} a certain scene in the Caves of Kor yonder, when the living looked upon the dead, and dead and living were the same? And {{do you remember what}} Ayesha swore, that she would come again--yes, to this world; and <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>that</b> <b>be</b> except by re-birth, or, what is the same thing, by the transmigration of the spirit?" ...|$|E
60|$|As for the {{carrying}} all these things, they might easily furnish themselves with mules or horses for carriage, while they had {{money to pay}} for them, and you may judge <b>how</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> wanting, by what has been said of the country.|$|R
6000|$|The old Gunga squatted {{close on}} his stool, and grinned as graciously as he could. [...] "I am poor and growing old," [...] he said, [...] "and I cannot catch fish as once I <b>could.</b> <b>How</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> done, O Royal Traveller?" ...|$|R
60|$|The notary {{scratched}} his lantern jaws and asked <b>how</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> brought about when every {{gate of the}} palace was shut because of the plague. Still, perhaps, it might be managed, he added, if a certain sum were forthcoming to bribe various janitors and persons in authority.|$|R
6000|$|Clara {{felt very}} uncomfortable. The awful thought had come upon {{her that this}} ambassadress {{had come to her}} as a proxy with a {{proposal}} of marriage. But <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>that</b> <b>be?</b> She had not spoken more than three or four times with her nephew, and knew nothing more of him than he had told her on the evening before. It was impossible, then. And yet what could his aunt mean by this discussion of his private affairs? ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No, no, no, Tam. <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>that</b> <b>be</b> {{with one}} who has done what you have for us? There is good in you--noble goodness, Tam; and who could have put it there but God, the Holy Spirit? I believe myself He was leading you all the time, though you did not know it; making you a better man first, and now, through this brave {{kindness}} to us, bringing you back {{to be a real}} true Christian and know Him.' ...|$|E
60|$|But again, {{the devil}} asked our Lord {{to fall down}} and worship him. Now <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>that</b> <b>be</b> a temptation to pride? Surely that was asking our Lord to do {{anything}} but a proud action, rather the most humiliating and most base of all actions. My friends, {{it seems to me that}} if our Lord had fallen down and worshipped the evil spirit, He would have given way to the spirit of pride utterly and boundlessly; and I will tell you why.|$|E
6000|$|It was {{owing to}} this {{overlapping}} of creeds that the celebrated population- puzzle arose among the denser gentry {{of the district}} around Nether-Moynton: <b>how</b> <b>could</b> it <b>be</b> <b>that</b> a parish containing fifteen score of strong full-grown Episcopalians, and nearly thirteen score of well-matured Dissenters, numbered barely two-and-twenty score adults in all? ...|$|R
2500|$|According to Rowling, {{fleshing}} {{out this}} back story {{was a matter}} of reverse planning: [...] "The basic idea [...] Harry ... didn't know he was a wizard ... and so then I kind of worked backwards from that position to find out <b>how</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be,</b> <b>that</b> he wouldn't know what he <b>was...</b> <b>That's...</b> When he <b>was</b> one year old, the most evil wizard for hundreds and hundreds of years attempted to kill him. He killed Harry's parents, and then he tried to kill Harry—he tried to curse him.... Harry has to find out, before we find out. And for some mysterious reason, the curse didn't work on Harry. So he's left with this lightning-bolt shaped scar on his forehead, and the curse rebounded upon the evil wizard who has been in hiding ever since".|$|R
6000|$|Wilson {{went back}} to his {{principal}} and reported the failure of his mission. Luigi was incensed, and asked <b>how</b> it <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> the old gentleman, who was by no means dull-witted, held his trifling nephew's evidence in inferences to be of more value than Wilson's. But Wilson laughed, and said: ...|$|R
60|$|Now, <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>that</b> <b>be?</b> In {{the same}} way that some time before that, as St. Luke tells us, the power of the Lord was present to heal those same Pharisees; and they were for the time amazed, and glorified God, and were filled with fear at His mighty works; but not healed. Their souls were not cured of their sin and folly by any means; for we find in the very next chapter, that because Jesus cured a palsied man on the Sabbath-day they were filled with madness, and {{consulted}} together how to kill Him.|$|E
60|$|The {{question}} is simply this. Did God, who made all things, make right and wrong? Many people think so. They think that God made goodness. But {{how can that}} be? For if God made goodness, {{there could have been}} no goodness before God made it. That is clear. But God was always good, good from all eternity. But <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>that</b> <b>be?</b> How could God be good, before there was any goodness made? That notion will not do then. And all we can say is that goodness is eternal and everlasting, just as God is: because God was and is and ever will be eternally and always good.|$|E
6000|$|The nomination-day brought Flora, Meta, {{baby and}} {{all to be}} very quiet, as was said; but <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>that</b> <b>be?</b> when every boy {{in the house was}} frantic, and the men {{scarcely}} less so. Aubrey and Gertrude, and the two jackdaws, each had a huge blue and orange rosette, and the two former went about roaring [...] "Rivers for ever!" [...] without the least consideration for the baby, who would have been decked in the same manner, if Ethel would have heard of it without indignation, at her wearing any colour before her christening white; as to Jack and Jill, though they could say their lesson, they were too much distressed by their ornaments to do ought but lurk in corners, and strive to peck them off.|$|E
6000|$|... 'You know I {{always had}} wondered, {{when my father}} was telling any of the {{circumstances}} of the fire to me, <b>how</b> it <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> a woman <b>could</b> sleep so soundly as to be unaware of her horrid position till it was too late even to give shout or sound of any kind.' ...|$|R
50|$|Seven {{years before}} writing his book, he had {{realized}} that the Erie Canal, slowly nearing completion across the state, would require hundreds of bridges. His iron bowstring truss was a solution to <b>how</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> accomplished quickly and cheaply. With a thousand dollars he had saved, he built the first one across the canal at Utica in 1841.|$|R
2500|$|In a 2001 interview, Rowling said Voldemort {{was invented}} as a nemesis for Harry Potter (the protagonist of the novels), and she {{intentionally}} did not flesh out Voldemort's backstory at first. [...] "The basic idea [...] didn't {{know he was}} a wizard ... And so then I kind of worked backwards from that position to find out <b>how</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be,</b> <b>that</b> he wouldn't know what he was. ... When he was one year old, the most evil wizard for {{hundreds and hundreds of}} years attempted to kill him. He killed Harry's parents, and then he tried to kill Harry—he tried to curse him. ... Harry has to find out, before we find out. And—so—but for some mysterious reason the curse didn't work on Harry. So he's left with this lightning bolt shaped scar on his forehead and the curse rebounded upon the evil wizard, who has been in hiding ever since." ...|$|R
