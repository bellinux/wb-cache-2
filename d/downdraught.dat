25|$|Later in {{the same}} year, the GTV6, {{a version of the}} GTV with the SOHC V6 2.5L engine from the Alfa Romeo Alfa 6 luxury saloon, was released. As a result, the hood {{received}} a bulge to clear the top of the intake and became its most pronounced feature. With Bosch L-Jetronic fuel injection instead of the six <b>downdraught</b> Dell'Orto carburettors in the early Alfa 6 installation, the V6 was much easier to start and retained its state of tune much better. The V6 received rave reviews from the motoring press, which had previously lambasted the same engine in the Alfa 6 because of the carburettor problems. It found its true home in the GTV6 Gran Turismo body where it could stretch its legs better than in the less sporting Alfa 6 saloon. The fuel injection installation eventually made it into the second series of the Alfa 6 as well. The GTV went through a number of revisions, including a new gear ratios and an updated interior in 1984.|$|E
2500|$|The two XP-51Bs were a more {{thorough}} conversion than the Mustang X, with a tailor-made engine installation and a complete redesign of the radiator duct. The airframe itself was strengthened, with the fuselage and engine mount area receiving more formers because of the [...] greater weight of the Packard V-1650-3 compared with the V-1710. The engine cowling was completely redesigned to house the Packard Merlin, which, because of the intercooler radiator mounted on the supercharger casing, was [...] taller and used an updraught carburetor, rather than the <b>downdraught</b> variety of the Allison. The new engine drove a four-bladed -diameter Hamilton Standard propeller that featured cuffs of hard molded rubber. To cater for the increased cooling requirements of the Merlin, a new fuselage duct was designed. This housed a larger radiator, which incorporated a section for the supercharger coolant, and, forward of this and slightly lower, an oil cooler was housed in a secondary duct which drew air through the main opening and exhausted via a separate exit flap.|$|E

5000|$|Thunderstorm — A {{thunderstorm}} {{is a type}} {{of storm}} that generates lightning and the attendant thunder. It is normally accompanied by heavy precipitation. Thunderstorms occur throughout the world, with the highest frequency in tropical rainforest regions where there are conditions of high humidity and temperature along with atmospheric instability. These storms occur when high levels of condensation form in a volume of unstable air that generates deep, rapid, upward motion in the atmosphere. The heat energy creates powerful rising air currents that swirl upwards to the tropopause. Cool descending air currents produce strong <b>downdraughts</b> below the storm. After the storm has spent its energy, the rising currents die away and <b>downdraughts</b> break up the cloud. Individual storm clouds can measure 2-10 km across.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The Naval Research Laboratory Coupled Ocean/Atmosphere Mesoscale Prediction System (COAMPS) {{has been}} {{extended}} to perform as a large-eddy simulation (LES) model. It has been validated {{with a series of}} boundary-layer experiments spanning a range of cloud nighttime, and includes a nighttime stratocumulus case, a trade wind cumulus layer, shallow cumulus convection over land, and a mixed regime consisting of cumulus clouds under broken stratocumulus. COAMPS-LES results are in good agreement with other models for all the cases simulated. Exact numerical budgets for the vertical velocity second (w 02) and third moment (w 03) have been derived for the stratocumulus and trade wind cumulus cases. For the w 03 budget in the stratocumulus, the buoyancy contribution from the updraughts and <b>downdraughts</b> largely cancel each other due to their similar magnitudes but opposite signs. In contrast, for the cumulus layer, the negative buoyancy contribution from the environmental <b>downdraughts</b> is negligible and the positive contribution from the updraughts completely dominates due to the conditional instability in the environment. As a result, w 03 is significantly larger in the cumulus than in the stratocumulus layer...|$|R

We have {{carried out a}} number of 5 h real time simulations. The results show that, if convection is deep enough, cumulus clouds tend to occur in groups. A typical cloud size is 3 km, whereas cloud groups have a diameter of about 15 km. <b>Downdraughts</b> {{play an important role in}} producing these groups. For shallow convections this grouping or clumping of clouds does not take place, although the flow in this case is also strongly organized (formation of stratocumulus).

5000|$|Such a {{claim is}} too broad and again contradicts {{the fact that}} updraughts {{in front of a}} {{thunderstorm}} are often laminar.

40|$|Turbulence in the {{convective}} {{boundary layer}} (CBL) uniformly heated from below and {{topped by a}} layer of uniformly stratified fluid is investigated for zero mean horizontal flow using large-eddy simulations (LES). The Rayleigh number is effectively infinite, the Froude number of the stable layer is 0. 09 and the surface roughness height relative to {{the height of the}} convective layer is varied between 10 - 6 and 10 - 2. The LES uses a finite-difference method to integrate the three-dimensional grid-volume-averaged Navier–Stokes equations for a Boussinesq fluid. Subgrid-scale (SGS) fluxes are determined from algebraically approximated second-order closure (SOC) transport equations for which all essential coefficients are determined from the inertial-range theory. The surface boundary condition uses the Monin–Obukhov relationships. A radiation boundary condition {{at the top of the}} computational domain prevents spurious reflections of gravity waves. The simulation uses 160 × 160 × 48 grid cells. In the asymptotic state, the results in terms of vertical mean profiles of turbulence statistics generally agree very well with results available from laboratory and atmospheric field experiments. We found less agreement with respect to horizontal velocity fluctuations, pressure fluctuations and dissipation rates, which previous investigations tend to overestimate. Horizontal spectra exhibit an inertial subrange. The entrainment heat flux at the top of the CBL is carried by cold updraughts and warm <b>downdraughts</b> in the form of wisps at scales comparable with the height of the boundary layer. Plots of instantaneous flow fields show a spoke pattern in the lower quarter of the CBL which feeds large-scale updraughts penetrating into the stable layer aloft. The spoke pattern has also been found in a few previous investigations. Small-scale plumes near the surface and remote from strong updraughts do not merge together but decay while rising through large-scale <b>downdraughts.</b> The structure of updraughts and <b>downdraughts</b> is identified by three-dimensional correlation functions and conditionally averaged fields. The mean circulation extends vertically over the whole boundary layer. We find that updraughts are composed of quasi-steady large-scale plumes together with transient rising thermals which grow in size by lateral entrainment. The skewness of the vertical velocity fluctuations is generally positive but becomes negative in the lowest mesh cells when the dissipation rate exceeds the production rate due to buoyancy near the surface, as is the case for very rough surfaces. The LES results are used to determine the root-mean-square value of the surface friction velocity and the mean temperature difference between the surface and the mixed layer as a function of the roughness height. The results corroborate a simple model of the heat transfer in the surface layer...|$|R

40|$|Close to {{the surface}} large {{coherent}} eddies consisting of plumes and <b>downdraughts</b> cause convergent winds blowing towards the plume axes, which in turn cause wind shears and generation of turbulence.

In this context we introduce the stability-dependence of the roughness length. The latter is important over very rough surfaces, when the height of the roughness elements becomes comparable with the large-eddy Monin–Obukhov length. A consistent theoretical model covering convective regimes over all types of natural surfaces, from the smooth still sea to the very rough city of Athens, is developed; it is also comprehensively validated against data from measurements at different sites and also through the convective boundary layer.

40|$|A local meso [...] {{scale model}} is {{expected}} to provide a three-dimensional picture of the atmosphere now, today and tomorrow. From this, the atmospheric state at any point at any moment of time can be derived. We wish to treat the local-scale processes in a physically correct way with less assumptions.

In principle, this means development from tuning to calculation, from complicated to simple, from hidden assumptions to transparent equations. With the new local model we hope to utilize the available information- observations, properties of the underslying surface- more eectively. Why physical parametrizations? Physical parametrizations were developed to handle the sources and sinks of prognostic variables due to (large) sub-grid-scale processes: turbulent eddies, organized convection with updraughts and <b>downdraughts,</b> circulations forced by the local topography and vegetation etc. These pro-cessess are relatively close to the resolved scales, thus their denition depends on the scale.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} {{a new theory}} of the convective heat/mass transfer. It focuses on (i) advanced treatment of turbulent mixing caused by large-scale semi-organised eddies overlooked in the classical theory and (ii) interactions between large eddies and surface roughness elements up to very high obstacles such as buildings, rocks and hills. Large-scale structures in the shear-free convective boundary layers consist of strong plumes and wider but weaker <b>downdraughts.</b> Close to the surface they cause local “convective winds ” blowing towards the plume axes. The latter generate turbulence, {{in addition to its}} generation by the buoyancy forces, and strongly enhance turbulent fluxes of heat and other scalars. This mechanism is especially important over very rough surfaces. The proposed advanced model is validated against data from measurements over different sites and also through large-eddy simulation of convective boundary layers (CBLs) over a range of surfaces from very smooth to extremely rough. Excellent correspondence between model results, field observations and large-eddy simulations is achieved. The obtained resistance and heat/mass transfer laws are recommended for practical use in meso-scale, weather-prediction, climat...|$|R

40|$|We study a simple, kinematical {{model of}} a galactic {{fountain}} flow and show that a horizontal field in the galactic plane can be pumped into the halo to a height of several kiloparsecs.

Such a flow traps the large scale magnetic field in the disc and deposits it {{at the top of}} the fountain flow. Unlike previously studied models of topological pumping, in our case the flow is not constrained to a closed box and horizontal magnetic flux can leak out at the top.

40|$|Observations are {{described}} of a Mesoscale Convective System (MCS) {{with a cold}} pool which propagated across southern England on 25 August 2005. The observations were made {{as part of the}} Convective Storm Initiation Project (CSIP).

In detail, however, unsteady transitions occurred involving the formation of two distinct lines of showers ahead of the initial linear system. In each case the cold pool merged with cold <b>downdraughts</b> from the new showers leading to a discontinuous propagation of the system. One of these lines formed independently of the MCS, very probably on a sea-breeze convergence line. The mechanism for formation of the other is unknown, but it is possible that it was triggered by ascent associated with gravity waves generated by the MCS. The merged cold pool was deeper and colder and propagated faster than the original system, eventually forming a bow echo and arc cloud as it propagated across the English Channel. Until completion of the merger, the propagation velocity of the overall system had been controlled by a combination of the above mechanisms rather than simply by cold pool dynamics...|$|R

Field measurements also showed high air velocity values in zones close to the windows in cases when air supply inlets were installed. This effect appears because of the lower window surface temperature, generating down directed cold air movement.
