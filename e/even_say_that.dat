25|$|One could <b>even</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> in {{the years}} before 1780 the {{prospects}} of the economy were improving: because of the economic growth in the German hinterland there were possibilities of growth in distributional trade in colonial commodities, and industrial products (Dutch or other European). Such possibilities were indeed realized in the 20th century, when the Netherlands again became a major distributional hub. The agricultural sector still enjoyed high productivity, whereas the nearby British markets for dairy products and produce offered opportunities for increased exports (which were indeed soon realized). Only, the high-cost structure of the labor market, high taxes, structural overvaluation of the guilder, all militated against most forms of industrial production, let alone export industries. Without the necessary reforms to remedy these problems the Netherlands were unlikely to participate in the industrial renaissance that Great Britain, and later other neighboring countries, started to experience {{in the latter part of}} the 18th century.|$|E

[...] The use of pizza delivery by Papa John's Pizza in the film was regarded by Common Sense Media, a media website for parents, reviewer Heather Boerner, as [...] "overly integrated product placement". [...] She criticized the product placement, writing, [...] "Not only is the pizza delivery guy included {{in more than half}} of the DVD, but the logo is present and the kids are shown munching ecstatically on the pizza at the end of the movie. [...] They <b>even</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> the pizza is great, and how the delivery guy was nice. It's enough to make a commercial-conscious parent gag".|$|E
500|$|The Black Stone plays {{a central}} role in the ritual of istilam, when pilgrims kiss the Black Stone, touch it with their hands or raise their hands towards it while repeating the takbir, [...] "God is Greatest". They perform this in the course of walking seven times around the Kaaba in a {{counterclockwise}} direction (tawaf), emulating the actions of Muhammad. At the end of each circuit, they perform istilam and may approach the Black Stone to kiss it at the end of tawaf. In modern times, large crowds make it practically impossible for everyone to kiss the stone, so it is currently acceptable to point in the direction of the Stone on each of their seven circuits around the Kaaba. Some <b>even</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> the Stone is best considered simply as a marker, useful in keeping count of the ritual circumambulations [...] that one has performed.|$|E

500|$|The two men {{discussed}} [...] "natural aristocracy." [...] Jefferson said, [...] "The natural aristocracy I {{consider as}} the most precious gift of nature for the instruction, the trusts, and government of society. And indeed {{it would have been}} inconsistent in creation to have formed man for the social state, and not to have provided virtue and wisdom enough to manage the concerns of society. May we not <b>even</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> the form of government is best which provides most effectually for a pure selection of these natural [...] into the offices of government?" [...] Adams wondered if it ever would be so clear who these people were, [...] "Your distinction between natural and artificial aristocracy does not appear to me well founded. Birth and wealth are conferred on some men as imperiously by nature, as genius, strength, or beauty. ... When aristocracies are established by human laws and honour, wealth, and power are made hereditary by municipal laws and political institutions, then I acknowledge artificial aristocracy to commence." [...] It would always be true, Adams argued, that fate would bestow influence on some men for reasons other than true wisdom and virtue. That being the way of nature, he thought such [...] "talents" [...] were natural. A good government, therefore, had to account for that reality.|$|E

Kellner previously played in Fiddler's Green, which is alluded to in the song [...] "Arschloch und Spaß dabei" [...] ('Asshole and enjoying it'): [...] "man sagt sogar, dass Wolfram früher Folk-Musik g'macht hätt" [...] ("They <b>even</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> Wolfram used to play folk music") [...]|$|E

Former campaign staffer Ed Rollins said [...] "They were all good professionals...There was no backstabbing. It's insulting that she would <b>even</b> <b>say</b> <b>that.</b> If she wants to know what went wrong with the campaign, maybe she needs to take a good look in the mirror." ...|$|E

5000|$|Anger {{is not at}} all bad for relationships. Happy {{couples are}} as {{frequently}} angry as unhappy couples. It seems that how people react to anger and how destructive they get is the crucial factor rather than the frequency of anger or fights.

2500|$|He {{founded the}} gossip {{magazine}} Interview, a stage for celebrities he [...] "endorsed" [...] {{and a business}} staffed by his friends. He collaborated with others on all of his books (some of which were written with Pat Hackett.) He adopted the young painter Jean-Michel Basquiat, and the band The Velvet Underground, presenting them {{to the public as}} his latest interest, and collaborating with them. One might <b>even</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> he produced people (as in the Warholian [...] "Superstar" [...] and the Warholian portrait). He endorsed products, appeared in commercials, and made frequent celebrity guest appearances on television shows and in films (he appeared in everything from Love Boat to Saturday Night Live and the Richard Pryor movie Dynamite Chicken).|$|E
2500|$|In {{her private}} life, Hepburn {{preferred}} to wear casual and comfortable clothes, {{contrary to the}} haute couture she wore on screen and at public events. Despite being admired for her beauty, she never considered herself attractive, stating in a 1959 interview that [...] "you can <b>even</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> I hated myself at certain periods. I was too fat, or maybe too tall, or maybe just plain too ugly... you can say my definiteness stems from underlying feelings of insecurity and inferiority. I couldn't conquer these feelings by acting indecisive. I found {{the only way to}} get the better of them was by adopting a forceful, concentrated drive." [...] In 1989, she stated that [...] "my look is attainable ... Women can look like Audrey Hepburn by flipping out their hair, buying the large glasses and the little sleeveless dresses." ...|$|E
2500|$|The main {{concentration}} {{of the book is}} to present an analysis of Caraka Samhita, the crucial source book on Indian medicine. According to Chattopadhyaya, [...] "discarding scripture orientation, they [...] insist on the supreme importance of direct observation of natural phenomena and on the technique of rational processing of the empirical data. They go even to the extent of claiming that the truth of any conclusion thus arrived at is to be tested ultimately by the criterion of practice". For them, [...] "everything in nature occurs according to some immutable laws, the body of which is usually called svabhava in Indian thought" [...] and [...] "from the medical viewpoint there can be nothing which is not made of matter". They <b>even</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> [...] "a substance is called conscious when it is endowed with the sense-organs". Further, Chattopadhyaya shows: ...|$|E

Nixon <b>even</b> <b>says</b> <b>that</b> he wants to break the oil companies. Despite all this talk the U.S. is still dependent.|$|R
5000|$|The Mentuck {{case has}} become infamous, as the Mr Big {{procedure}} has become {{viewed by the}} courts as [...] "ingenious, not insidious". One author, writing in 2007, <b>even</b> <b>says</b> <b>that</b> the technique is [...] "indiscriminate and pernicious". A newspaper has taken to publish at intervals the story of Mentuck due to its importance.|$|R
2500|$|Hillsong {{has been}} criticised for its {{involvement}} with Gloria Jean's Coffees and Mercy Ministries, an evangelical charity {{with a similar}} stance on abortion and the former perspective on sexuality issues. Complaints by former residents of Mercy Ministries include [...] "emotionally cruel and medically unproven techniques", such as exorcism and residents being required to sign over social welfare payments to Mercy Ministries. Hillsong responded by praising the work of Mercy Ministries and stating that [...] "we {{are not involved in}} the operational aspects of the organization." [...] The church also said: [...] "We have heard many wonderful testimonies about how the work of Mercy has helped the lives of young women facing often debilitating and life-controlling situations. Some would <b>even</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> Mercy Ministries has saved their life." [...] Mercy Ministries was closed down on 31 October 2009, preceding which Hillsong had distanced itself from the organisation despite earlier funding and staffing elements of it.|$|E
2500|$|Though {{compared}} to the boom years of the Golden Age the 18th-century Dutch economy looked less attractive (which earned this epoch the disdainful epithet [...] "periwig era" [...] in the Dutch Orangist historiography of the 19th century), it still had its strengths. The [...] "decline" [...] of {{the economy as a}} whole was more relative, {{compared to}} its competitors, than absolute. The disappearance of whole industries, though regrettable, was no more than a consequence of secular economic trends, like the comparable industrial realignments of the 20th century (ironically, in both cases the textile industry was involved). One could <b>even</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> by the shift from industry to [...] "service" [...] sectors, the structure of the Dutch economy became even more [...] "modern." [...] (Indeed, one may see an analogy with the changes in the mature British economy a century later). However, the degree of foreign direct investment by the Dutch at the end of the 18th century was even greater than that of the British at the beginning of the 20th century: more than twice GNP versus 1.5 times GNP).|$|E
2500|$|The Tosefta {{reported}} that Jewish judicial proceedings adopted the oath that Abraham imposed in [...] And Rav Judah said that Rav {{said that the}} judge adjures the witness with the oath stated in [...] "And I will make you swear by the Lord, the God of heaven." [...] Ravina explained that this accorded with the view of Rabbi Haninah bar Idi, who said that Jewish judicial proceedings require swearing by the Name of God. Rav Ashi replied that one might <b>even</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> it accorded with {{the view of the}} Rabbis, who said that a witness can be adjured with a Substitute for the Name of God. They concluded that the witness needs to hold something sacred in his hand, as Abraham's servant did when in [...] he put his hand under Abraham's thigh and held Abraham's circumcision. Rava said that a judge who adjures by [...] "the Lord God of heaven" [...] without having the witness hold a sacred object errs and has to repeat the swearing correctly. Rav Papa said that a judge who adjures with tefillin errs and has to repeat the swearing. The law follows Rava, but not Rav Papa, as tefillin are considered sacred.|$|E
2500|$|In Deuteronomy chapter 4, verses 1 and 8 {{state that}} Moses {{is about to}} teach the laws [...] "today". Verse 8, in the Hebrew text, <b>even</b> <b>says</b> <b>that</b> the [...] "entire Torah" [...] is to be taught today. However, verse 5 {{suggests}} that the laws have already been delivered {{some time in the}} past.|$|R

2500|$|Copernicus cited Aristarchus and Philolaus in {{an early}} {{manuscript}} of his book which survives, stating: [...] "Philolaus believed in the mobility of the earth, and some <b>even</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> Aristarchus of Samos was of that opinion." [...] For reasons unknown (although possibly out of reluctance to quote pre-Christian sources), he did not include this passage in {{the publication of his}} book. Inspiration came to Copernicus not from observation of the planets, but from reading two authors. In Cicero he found an account of the theory of Hicetas. Plutarch provided an account of the Pythagoreans Heraclides Ponticus, Philolaus, and Ecphantes. These authors had proposed a moving Earth, which did not, however, revolve around a central sun. When Copernicus' book was published, it contained an unauthorized preface by the Lutheran theologian Andreas Osiander. This cleric stated that Copernicus wrote his heliocentric account of the Earth's movement as a mere mathematical hypothesis, not as an account that contained truth or even probability. Since Copernicus' hypothesis was believed to contradict the Old Testament account of the Sun's movement around the Earth (Joshua 10:12-13), this was apparently written to soften any religious backlash against the book. However, {{there is no evidence that}} Copernicus himself considered the heliocentric model as merely mathematically convenient, separate from reality.|$|E
