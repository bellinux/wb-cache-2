This paper mainly adopts {{the virtual}} {{instrument}} {{to realize the}} test on the accuracy of precise <b>transmission</b> <b>chains,</b> and a precise transmission testing system has been developed. The system based on the LABVIEW software can realize data acquisition, signal processing and display of results, meanwhile，it can dynamically analyze the precision of the <b>transmission</b> <b>chain.</b> The results of the actual measurements show that the testing system can accurately and rapidly measure the precision index, furthermore, it has the characteristics of high accuracy, good real-time performance, flexible operation, easy to modify the measurement program. the system can not only be used in signal measurement and analysis, but also can automatically record and store data. What is more, it can real-time display dynamic precision and transmission error curve of precise <b>transmission</b> <b>chain,</b> It is Suitable for the precision measurement and error analysis of high precision <b>transmission</b> <b>chains</b> (such as harmonic gears, planetary gears and so on),and has a good application value in this field...|$|R

40|$|In {{many social}} systems, groups of {{individuals}} can find remarkably efficient solutions to complex cognitive problems, sometimes even outperforming a single expert. The {{success of the}} group, however, crucially depends on how the judgments of the group members are aggregated to produce the collective answer. A large variety of such aggregation methods have been described in the literature, such as averaging the independent judgments, relying on the majority or setting up a group discussion. In the present work, we introduce a novel approach for aggregating judgments - the <b>transmission</b> <b>chain</b> - which {{has not yet been}} consistently evaluated in the context of collective intelligence. In a <b>transmission</b> <b>chain,</b> all group members have access to a unique collective solution and can improve it sequentially. Over repeated improvements, the collective solution that emerges reflects the judgments of every group members. We address the question of whether such a <b>transmission</b> <b>chain</b> can foster collective intelligence for binary-choice problems. In a series of numerical simulations, we explore the impact of various factors on the performance of the <b>transmission</b> <b>chain,</b> such as the group size, the model parameters, and the structure of the population. The performance of this method is compared to those of the majority rule and the confidence-weighted majority. Finally, we rely on two existing datasets of individuals performing a series of binary decisions to evaluate the expected performances of the three methods empirically. We find that the parameter space where the <b>transmission</b> <b>chain</b> has the best performance rarely appears in real datasets. We conclude that the <b>transmission</b> <b>chain</b> is best suited for other types of problems, such as those that have cumulative properties...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the problem of}} transcoding as it may occur in, for instance, the following situation. Suppose a satellite transmits an MPEG-compressed video signal at say 9 Mbit/s. This signal must be relayed at a cable head end. However, since the cable capacity is only limited, the cable head end will want to relay this incoming signal at a lower bit-rate of, say, 5 Mbit/s. The problem is how to convert a compressed video signal of a given bit-rate into a compressed video signal of a lower bit-rate. The specific transcoding problem discussed in this paper {{is referred to as}} bit-rate conversion. Basically, a transcoder used for such a purpose will consist of a cascaded decoder and encoder. It is shown in the paper that the complexity of this combination can be significantly reduced. The paper also investigates the loss of picture quality that may be expected when a transcoder is in the <b>transmission</b> <b>chain.</b> The loss of quality as compared to that resulting in the case of transmission without a transcoder is studied by means of computations using simplified models of the <b>transmission</b> <b>chains</b> and by means of using computer simulations of the complete <b>transmission</b> <b>chain.</b> It will be shown that the presence of two quantizers, i. e. cascaded quantization, in the <b>transmission</b> <b>chain</b> is the main cause of extra losses, and it will be shown that the losses in terms of SNR will be some 0. 5 ¿ 1. 0 dB greater than {{in the case of a}} <b>transmission</b> <b>chain</b> without a transcoder...|$|R

40|$|The {{question}} of how much the outcomes of cultural evolution are shaped by the cognitive capacities of human learners has been explored in several disciplines, including psychology, anthropology and linguistics. We address this question through a detailed investigation of <b>transmission</b> <b>chains,</b> in which each person passes information to another along a chain. We review mathematical and empirical evidence that shows that under general conditions, and across experimental paradigms, the information passed along <b>transmission</b> <b>chains</b> will be affected by the inductive biases of the people involved—the constraints on learning and memory, which influence conclusions from limited data. The mathematical analysis considers the case where each person is a rational Bayesian agent. The empirical work consists of behavioural experiments in which human participants are shown to operate in the manner predicted by the Bayesian framework. Specifically, in situations in which each person's response is used to determine the data seen by the next person, people converge on concepts consistent with their inductive biases irrespective of the information seen by the first member of the chain. We then relate the Bayesian analysis of <b>transmission</b> <b>chains</b> to models of biological evolution, clarifying how chains of individuals correspond to population-level models and how selective forces can be incorporated into our models. Taken together, these results indicate how laboratory studies of <b>transmission</b> <b>chains</b> can provide information about the dynamics of cultural evolution and illustrate that inductive biases can {{have a significant impact on}} these dynamics...|$|R

40|$|IntroductionSierra Leone {{experienced}} an unprecedented Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak {{in all its}} districts. Koinadugu District {{was the last to}} report an EVD case. Several outbreak response strategies were implemented. As part of lessons learnt, we conducted an observational study to describe the <b>transmission</b> <b>chain</b> in the district and the impact of the control measures implemented to contain the outbreak. MethodsWe reconstructed the <b>transmission</b> <b>chain,</b> positioning both confirmed and probable cases, described the distribution of the EVD confirmed cases {{in the context of the}} routes of transmission (Community, Funeral or Health facility setting) and assessed the impact of control measures using the surveillance data collected during the outbreak. ResultsAll 142 confirmed and probable EVD cases registered were fully resolved in the <b>transmission</b> <b>chain.</b> 72. 5 % of all the EVD cases in the district were exposed in the community, 26. 1 % exposed during funerals, and 1. 4 % exposed in the health facility setting. Health-care workers contributed little to the EVD outbreak. 71. 1 % of EVD transmission occurred among family members. Female EVD cases generated more secondary cases than their male counterparts (P[*]=[*] 0. 03). With removal of EVD cases from the community and admission to the community care center (CCC), the EVD transmission in the community decreased to substantially lower rates. In addition, transmission due to exposure in health facilities was further reduced with the implementation of full infection and prevention controls. ConclusionThis study details the <b>transmission</b> <b>chain</b> of EVD in a rural district setting and the public health interventions implemented to successfully limit the outbreak to just one of 11 chiefdoms. Heightened community-based surveillance for early case detection, swift isolation of suspect cases, efficient contact tracing and monitoring, and good infection prevention and control measures in health facilities were highly effective in limiting transmission and, eventually, breaking the <b>transmission</b> <b>chain.</b> CCCs were also instrumental in achieving early isolation and basic care for suspect cases, while ensuring that their family members who were close contacts remained in the community for easy contact tracing and monitoring. These were very useful lessons learnt that would inform the management of future outbreaks...|$|R
