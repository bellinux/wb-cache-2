5|$|A {{national}} recession greatly {{affected the}} city's economy in 1982, as areas of Texas and Oklahoma <b>heavily</b> <b>dependent</b> on oil suffered the freefall in gas prices {{due to a}} glut, and a mass exodus of oil industries. Tulsa, <b>heavily</b> <b>dependent</b> on the oil industry, {{was one of the}} hardest hit cities by the fall of oil prices. By 1992, the state's economy had fully recovered, but leaders worked to expand into sectors unrelated to oil and energy.|$|E

5|$|Historically, Sarawak's {{economy was}} {{stagnant}} during {{the rule of}} previous three white Rajahs. After the formation of Malaysia, Sarawak GDP growth rate has risen due to increase in petroleum output and the rise in global petroleum prices.

The per capita GDP in Sarawak was lower {{than the national average}} from 1970 to 1990. As of 2016, the urban-rural income gap remained a major problem in Sarawak.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} half of the twentieth century, the {{extractive}} industries of the West of Scotland underwent a metamorphosis. The small pits were either worked out or were mechanised and merged. A similar process took place in the iron and steel production industries, and the medium scale iron works in many locations closed down. Many railway branch lines had been <b>heavily</b> <b>dependent</b> on business from the mineral industries, and could not be sustained when they had gone, but some continued as passenger lines where they served sizable communities.|$|E
5|$|Station to Station is {{the tenth}} studio album by English {{musician}} David Bowie, released by RCA Records in 1976.

The album was recorded after he completed shooting Nicolas Roeg's The Man Who Fell to Earth, and the cover artwork featured a still from the movie. During the sessions Bowie was <b>heavily</b> <b>dependent</b> on drugs, especially cocaine, and later claimed that he recalled almost nothing of the production.|$|E
40|$|Non-tariff {{measures}} such as food safety standards are used to achieve the non-trade objective of protecting consumers' health and safety. However, {{they can also be}} used as a trade protection tool to drive a price wedge between domestic and foreign producers. This study investigates the protectionist intent of EU food safety standards using a sample of EU food imported from African countries with a specific focus on tomatoes and citrus fruits. We formalize what protectionism is by comparing EU standards to the internationally scientific referenced benchmarks regulated jointly by both the Food and Agricultural Organization and the World Health Organization. Our results show that the EU tomato sector is less dependent on imports and is overprotected by more stringent standards relative to the international benchmarks. Conversely, we find that the EU orange and lime and lemon sectors are <b>heavily</b> import <b>dependent</b> and are under-protected relative to the international standards. These results largely support the hypothesis that <b>heavily</b> import <b>dependent</b> sectors are less protected...|$|R
40|$|The Japanese {{language}} has rather simple morphology and semanticsoriented syntax. It is also <b>heavily</b> context <b>dependent</b> {{in the sense}} that many constituents can be omitted. Thus we need to formalize Japanese grammar to take morphology, syntax, semantics and pragmatic factors into account. Based on CUProlog which is a constraint logic programming language, we have developed a grammar formalism for Japanese. In this paper, we show its outline and some running examples. 1 Introduction We have developed a constraints based grammar formalism for the Japanese language. We find that the Japanese language is <b>heavily</b> context <b>dependent</b> {{in the sense that}} many syntactic constituents can be omitted and we have to recover them with the context. Thus we need to formalize a Japanese grammar to include syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic elements even in describing a small part of its usage. First we give a brief introduction to Japanese grammar. Then we introduce our base system, CUProlog, which is a con [...] ...|$|R

Arriving in Australia in February 1942, the 49th Pursuit Group moved to the Darwin area in March and April 1942. By this time, Darwin had been bombed a number of times. The 49th Pursuit Group became its {{principal}} defense. Conditions in the area were still primitive, and spare parts and equipment were scarce. Lacking adequate logistical support, the Americans were <b>heavily</b> <b>dependent</b> on their Australian allies.

5|$|The Imperial Roman {{army of the}} Principate (30 BC – 284 AD) {{underwent}} a significant transformation {{as a result of}} the chaotic 3rd century. Unlike the army of the Principate, the army of the 4th century was <b>heavily</b> <b>dependent</b> on conscription and its soldiers were paid much less than in the 2nd century. Barbarians from outside the empire probably supplied a much larger proportion of the late army's recruits than in the army of the 1st and 2nd centuries, but there is little evidence that this adversely affected the army's performance.|$|E

However, aquaculture, or fish farming, which has been practiced since about 3,500 BCE. in China, is becoming increasingly important in many nations. Overall, about one-sixth of the world's protein {{is estimated to be}} provided by fish. That proportion is considerably elevated in some developing nations and regions <b>heavily</b> <b>dependent</b> on the sea. In a similar manner, fish have been tied to trade.|$|E

5|$|For decades Salford's {{economy was}} <b>heavily</b> <b>dependent</b> on {{manufacturing}} industry, especially textiles and engineering. Since the Second World War however, Salford has experienced decades of growing unemployment as these sectors diminished and new sectors chose to locate {{in out of}} town locations with better transport links. Between 1965 and 1991 the city lost over 49,000jobs, or more than 32% of its employment base. Several factors contributed to this decline, not least changes in the national and international economies, {{the introduction of new}} technology and the concentration of investment in London and South East England. The biggest job losses were experienced in Salford's traditional industries and although the service sector expanded during this period, it was unable to compensate for the decline in manufacturing.|$|E
5|$|Indian {{agriculture}} is <b>heavily</b> <b>dependent</b> on the monsoon {{as a source}} of water. In some parts of India, the failure of the monsoons results in water shortages, resulting in below-average crop yields. This is particularly true of major drought-prone regions such as southern and eastern Maharashtra, northern Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Western Orissa, Gujarat, and Rajasthan. In the past, droughts have periodically led to major Indian famines. These include the Bengal famine of 1770, in which up to one third of the population in affected areas died; the 1876–1877 famine, in which over five million people died; the 1899 famine, in which over 4.5 million died; and the Bengal famine of 1943, in which over five million died from starvation and famine-related illnesses.|$|E
