40|$|ABSTRACT: Slightly tapered {{truncated}} cones were manufactured from graphite/epoxy preimpregnated unidirectional {{tape and}} were loaded in compression. Different amounts of side loads were introduced by orienting the loading axis {{away from the}} central axis of the cone. The cones were crushed under quasi-static conditions, and their energy absorption was measured. For small amounts of side load, the <b>energy</b> <b>absorbency</b> was improved; however, {{as the amount of}} side load is increased further, the energy absorption capability of the structure is reduced significantly. Furthermore, a tendency for the specimen to topple is observed {{as a result of the}} moment induced by the side loads which reduces the energy absorption properties even further...|$|E
40|$|A {{postal survey}} {{was carried out}} of the 90 most {{accessible}} climbing walls in England, Scotland and Wales to determine the incidence and nature of injuries requiring emergency treatment associated with their use. Over a two year period, representing 1. 021 million visits to the 56 walls used by more than 30 climbers per week, 55 significant injuries were recorded. The rate of injury {{was not related to}} any identified design or safety feature of the walls, although upper limb injuries were proportionally more common in walls which provided thinner fixed landing mats rather than thicker, moveable crash mats. The overall rate of injury was very low and climbers seem to modify risk taking behaviour and thus compensate for the level of safety equipment available. It may be possible to reduce the injury rate further by providing seamless ground cover with matting of adequate <b>energy</b> <b>absorbency...</b>|$|E
40|$|The dynamic {{mechanical}} properties of limestone are studied with 5 types of impact pressure acting on limestone samples in axial direction in this paper. The rubber shaper with {{a diameter of}} 5 [*]mm and thickness of 2 [*]mm is adopted. Besides the conical punch of split pressure bar of Hopkinson with a diameter of 50 [*]mm is also used. The half-sinusoid pulse is obtained by using the pulse shaper method and special punch method; the constant strain rate deformation of the sample is realized. Dynamic compressive properties and failure modes of limestone under different impact pressure are investigated. In addition, energy dissipation is studied {{in the process of}} experiment. The results show that the dynamic compressive strength of limestone has an exponent relation to strain rate. The failure strain, degree of fragmentation, incident energy, and absorption energy increase, while the <b>energy</b> <b>absorbency</b> decreases with the increasing of strain rate. However, the initial elastic modulus is not sensitive to the strain rate. The research method and conclusions have reference value for the dynamic {{mechanical properties}} of other brittle materials...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThin {{films of}} copper oxide were {{prepared}} by chemical bath deposition (CBD) method on substrates of glasses by Alternate immersions method (AI) {{at room temperature}} for 20 second using heated liquid of sodium hydroxide up to 70 ° and copper thiosulfate complex. The substrates were annealed at different temperatures (200 - 300 - 400) in the air; the crystalline structure of prepared samples was studied by using XRD and (SEM) technologies. The results were indicated to; the crystalline structure of prepared films was related to temperature of annealing of copper-oxide (Tenorite), cubic of Cu 2 o (Cuprite). Optical studies showed that the prohibited rang between (1. 3 - 2. 4) ev was related to annealing temperature (monoclinic). Therefore, application of solar cells is very promising as a suitable material for conversion of photovoltaic <b>energy</b> with high <b>absorbency</b> solar and low thermal issue. Real and imaginary dielectric constants were calculated (ɛ 1 and ɛ 2). Significant improvement in structure as a follower of annealing temperature required by oxide layer, SEM image showed that porous structure were distinctive materials for the manufacture of gas sensors...|$|R
40|$|Effects {{of engine}} {{placement}} on flutter {{characteristics of a}} very flexible high-aspect-ratio wing are investigated using the code NATASHA (Nonlinear Aeroelastic Trim And Stability of HALE Aircraft). The analysis was validated against published results for divergence and flutter of swept wings and found to be in excellent agreement with the experimental results of the classical wing of Goland. Moreover, modal frequencies and damping obtained for the Goland wing were found in excellent agreement with published results based on a new continuum-based unsteady aerodynamic formulation. Gravity for this class of wings {{plays an important role}} in flutter characteristics. In the absence of aerodynamic and gravitational forces and without an engine, the kinetic energy of the first two modes are calculated. Maximum and minimum flutter speed locations coincide with the area of minimum and maximum kinetic energy of the second bending and torsion modes. Time-dependent dynamic behavior of a turboshaft engine (JetCat SP 5) is simulated with a transient engine model and the nonlinear aeroelastic response of the wing to the engine's time-dependent thrust and dynamic excitation is presented. Below the flutter speed, at the wing tip and behind the elastic axis, the impulse engine excitation leads to a stable limit cycle oscillation; and for the ramp kind of excitation, beyond the flutter speed, at 75 % span, behind the elastic axis, it produces chaotic oscillation of the wing. Both the excitations above the flutter speed are stabilized, on the inboard portion of the wing. Effects of engine placement and sweep on flutter characteristics of a backswept flying wing resembling the Horten IV are explored using NATASHA. This aircraft exhibits a non-oscillatory yawing instability, expected in aircraft with neither a vertical tail nor yaw control. More important, however, is the presence of a low frequency “body-freedom flutter” mode. The aircraft center of gravity was held fixed during the study, which allowed aircraft controls to trim similarly for each engine location, and minimized flutter speed variations along the inboard span. Maximum flutter speed occurred for engine placement just outboard of 60 % span with engine center of gravity forward of the elastic axis. The body-freedom flutter mode was largely unaffected by the engine placement except for cases in which the engine is placed at the wing tip and near the elastic axis. In the absence of engines, aerodynamics, and gravity, a region of minimum kinetic energy density for the first symmetric free-free bending mode is also near the 60 % span. A possible relationship between the favorable flutter characteristics obtained by placing the engines at that point and the region of minimum kinetic energy is briefly explored. Effects of multiple engine placement on a similar type of aircraft are studied. The results showed that multiple engine placement increases flutter speed particularly when the engines are placed in the outboard portion of the wing (60 % to 70 % span), forward of the elastic axis, while the lift to drag ratio is affected negligibly. The behavior of the sub- and supercritical eigenvalues is studied for two cases of engine placement. NATASHA captures a hump body-freedom flutter with low frequency for the clean wing case, which disappears as the engines are placed on the wings. In neither case is there any apparent coalescence between the unstable modes. NATASHA captures other non-oscillatory unstable roots with very small amplitude, apparently originating with flight dynamics. For the clean-wing case, in the absence of aerodynamic and gravitational forces, the regions of minimum kinetic energy density for the first and third bending modes are located around 60 % span. For the second mode, this kinetic energy density has local minima around the 20 % and 80 % span. The regions of minimum kinetic energy of these modes are in agreement with calculations that show a noticeable increase in flutter speed at these regions if engines are placed forward of the elastic axis. High Altitude, Long Endurance (HALE) aircraft can achieve sustained, uninterrupted flight time if they use solar power. Wing morphing of solar powered HALE aircraft can significantly increase solar <b>energy</b> <b>absorbency.</b> An example of the kind of morphing considered in this thesis requires the wings to fold so as to orient a solar panel to be hit more directly by the sun's rays at specific times of the day. In this study solar powered HALE flying wing aircraft are modeled with three beams with lockable hinge connections. Such aircraft are shown to be capable of morphing passively, following the sun by means of aerodynamic forces and engine thrusts. The analysis underlying NATASHA was extended to include the ability to simulate morphing of the aircraft into a “Z” configuration. Because of the “long endurance” feature of HALE aircraft, such morphing needs to be done without relying on actuators and at as near zero energy cost as possible. The emphasis of this study is to substantially demonstrate the processes required to passively morph a flying wing into a Z-shaped configuration and back again. Ph. D...|$|E
