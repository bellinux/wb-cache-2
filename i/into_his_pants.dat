500|$|Drake's {{shirt is}} always tucked <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>pants</b> {{on only one}} side, an {{attribute}} which commentators have labeled the [...] "half-tuck". The term, first coined by video game designer Tim Schafer, led to Naughty Dog altering Drake's appearance to have his shirt almost tucked in from the front, and half tucked in at the back, an inside joke Naughty Dog co-president Evan Wells labeled a [...] "three-quarters-tuck." [...] The half-tuck {{was part of a}} larger effort to ensure Drake's design was asymmetrical. Tim Schafer commented [...] "It was all super next-gen, but the most next-gen thing about it to me was Drake's shirt. Check it out: Somehow it's tucked in, and yet not tucked in, at the very same time. Of all the technical marvels contained in Uncharted, this was the one that really mystified me." ...|$|E
500|$|Harrison Ford reprises {{the role}} of Dr. Henry [...] "Indiana" [...] Jones, Jr. To prepare for the role, the 64-year-old Ford spent {{three hours a day}} at a gym, practiced with the bullwhip for two weeks, and relied on a high-protein diet of fish and vegetables. Ford had kept fit during the series' hiatus anyway, as he hoped for another film. He {{performed}} many of his own stunts because stunt technology had become safer since 1989, and he also felt it improved his performance. It is also said that he still fit <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>pants</b> from Raiders of the Lost Ark. He argued, [...] "The appeal of Indiana Jones isn't his youth but his imagination, his resourcefulness. His physicality {{is a big part of}} it, especially the way he gets out of tight situations. But it's not all hitting people and falling from high places. My ambition in action is to have the audience look straight in the face of character and not at the back of a capable stuntman's head. I hope to continue that no matter how old I get." [...] Ford felt his return would reduce U.S. ageism (he refused to dye his hair for the role), because of the film's family appeal: [...] "This is a movie which is geared not to [...] segment of the demographic, an age-defined segment ... We've got a great shot at breaking the movie demographic constraints." [...] He told Koepp to add more references to his age in the script. Spielberg said Ford was not too old to play Indiana: [...] "When a guy gets to be that age and he still packs the same punch, and he still runs just as fast and climbs just as high, he's gonna be breathing a little heavier at the end of the set piece. And I felt, 'Let's have some fun with that. Let's not hide that. Spielberg recalled the line in Raiders that said, [...] "It's not the years, it's the mileage," [...] and felt he could not tell the difference between Ford during the shoots for Last Crusade and Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.|$|E

His habits include tucking his sweater <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>pants,</b> {{breathing}} {{through his}} mouth, {{and playing the}} violin in Gifted and Talented Class/program, when everyone else wants him to be quiet.

60|$|Rivera's seconds {{were not}} half-caring {{for him in}} the {{intervals}} between rounds. Their towels made a showing, but drove little air <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>panting</b> lungs. Spider Hagerty talked advice to him, but Rivera knew it was wrong advice. Everybody was against him. He was surrounded by treachery. In the fourteenth round he put Danny down again, and himself stood resting, hands dropped at side, while the referee counted. In the other corner Rivera had been noting suspicious whisperings. He saw Michael Kelly make his way to Roberts and bend and whisper. Rivera's ears were a cat's, desert-trained, and he caught snatches of what was said. He wanted to hear more, and when his opponent arose he maneuvered the fight into a clinch over against the ropes.|$|R

50|$|When the New York Police Department {{tapped on}} Mirra's car window hours later, he {{appeared}} to be sleeping: his head had fallen forward so his chin rested on his chest and his eyes were closed. He was shot three times, twice behind the ear and once in the cheek. A fourth bullet was lodged in his left knee.

An associate of Berger said Berger took one copy in September 2003 and four copies in October 2003, allegedly by stuffing the documents <b>into</b> <b>his</b> socks and <b>pants.</b> Berger subsequently lied to investigators when questioned about the removal of the documents.|$|R
5000|$|The {{team that}} Gretzky played on at age six was {{otherwise}} composed of ten-year-olds. His first coach, Dick Martin, remarked that he handled the puck {{better than the}} ten-year-olds. According to Martin, [...] "Wayne was so good {{that you could have}} a boy of your own who was a tremendous hockey player, and he'd get overlooked because of what the Gretzky kid was doing." [...] The sweaters for ten-year-olds were far too large for Gretzky, who coped by tucking the sweater <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>pants</b> on the right side. Gretzky continued doing this throughout his NHL career.|$|E

Kaps taps his foot for the bandleader to keep playing. It does and so does the salt. The music ends again and again the salt going. Kaps is {{laughing}} in embarrassment. He looks at the bandleader and utters “Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da,” and the band plays the Sousa march again.|$|E
50|$|Donald {{throws the}} starfish off his bottom and it lands {{right in front}} of Pluto. After Pluto sniffs at it, it begins to rapidly run away. Pluto chases it right up to the waves where he gets buried in the sand. The starfish hops right over him, hits him on the nose, and escapes while Pluto looks on in frustration.
