50|$|The {{deposition}} of particulate pollutants into the lungs is necessary before the particles can {{travel through the}} mucus into the lung tissue. There are four mechanisms of deposition: interception, impaction, <b>gravitational</b> <b>settling,</b> and Brownian diffusion. Interception happens when a particle is removed after brushing up against an obstacle. Impaction happens when the particle collides into {{the surface of the}} respiratory tract due to the high inertia. <b>Gravitational</b> <b>settling</b> is influenced by the force of gravity which causes the particle to settle on the respiratory tract. Brownian motion causes the random collision of gas molecules against the particle, until the particle goes into the respiratory tract.|$|E

40|$|The {{mechanics}} of sediment transport are of fundamental importance for fluvio-deltaic morphodynamics. The present study focuses on quantifying particle motions and trajectories {{across a wide}} range of flow conditions. In particular, a continuous model is presented that predicts particle travel distances for saltation and suspension based on Rouse number and relative grain roughness. By utilizing a series of eight video cameras in a plexiglass flume direct measurements of the distributions of particle travel distances (excursion lengths) were obtained. To this end, experiments were carried out in dark under black lights with fluorescent painted plastic and quartz sand particles. For relatively high Rouse numbers indicating bed load dominant transport regime (P≥ 2. 5), particle motion is governed by the effect of <b>gravitational</b> forces (<b>settling</b> velocities) and measured excursion lengths closely follow a Gaussian distribution. For P= 2. 5, particle motion is equally subjected to both gravitational and turbulent forces. Consequently, measured excursion lengths exhibit a bimodal distribution with two distinct peaks. As turbulent fluctuations increase and dominate particle motion over gravity (P< 2. 5), distributions of excursion lengths become unimodal and negative-skewed with mean values deviating from the modes. The predicted trend of linearly increasing excursion lengths with decreasing Rouse numbers is consistent with measured excursion lengths across {{a wide range of}} Rouse numbers (P= 1. 8 - 8. 9). Furthermore, measured excursion lengths are observed to fit within the predicted range of excursion lengths with no significant difference between measured excursion lengths of plastic and quartz sand particles. </p...|$|R
5000|$|The first {{principle}} {{underlying the}} null point theory {{is due to}} the gravitational force; finer sediments remain in the water column for longer durations allowing transportation outside the surf zone to deposit under calmer conditions. The <b>gravitational</b> effect, or <b>settling</b> velocity determines the location of deposition for finer sediments, whereas a grain's internal angle of friction determines the deposition of larger grains on a shore profile. The secondary principle to the creation of seaward sediment fining is known as the hypothesis of asymmetrical thresholds under waves; this describes the interaction between the oscillatory flow of waves and tides flowing over the wave ripple bedforms in an asymmetric pattern. [...] "The relatively strong onshore stroke of the wave forms an eddy or vortex on the lee side of the ripple, provided the onshore flow persists, this eddy remains trapped in the lee of the ripple. When the flow reverses, the eddy is thrown upwards off the bottom and a small cloud of suspended sediment generated by the eddy is ejected into the water column above the ripple, the sediment cloud is then moved seaward by the offshore stroke of the wave." [...] Where there is symmetry in ripple shape the vortex is neutralised, the eddy and its associated sediment cloud develops {{on both sides of the}} ripple. This creates a cloudy water column which travels under tidal influence as the wave orbital motion is in equilibrium.|$|R

40|$|We present new {{major and}} trace element data {{for a set}} of closely spaced (< 1. 8 km) dredges along a well-studied portion of the East Pacific Rise (EPR) axis near 90 ° 30 ′N (9 ° 17 ′N to 90 ° 50 ′N). With the {{exception}} of enriched mid-ocean ridge basalt (E-MORB) at 9 ° 35 ′N, the lavas are all normal mid-ocean ridge basalt (N-MORB) with a limited range of MgO (8. 40 – 6. 22 wt %). Major element and trace element data favor derivation of the melts from a single parental composition by low pressure crystallization of olivine, plagioclase and clinopyroxene in the ratio of 16 : 62 : 22. This model is consistent with liquid line of descent models but inconsistent with petrographic observations in that most of the N-MORB lavas have only plagioclase phenocrysts. We ascribe this to <b>gravitational</b> crystal <b>settling</b> of mafic phases and flotation of plagioclase, supported by crystal size distribution data and density relations. Most likely this occurred in the axial magma chamber (AMC) that underlies the EPR in this area. The chemistry of axial lavas varies along axis and correlates roughly with elevation of the axis and depth to the AMC. We interpret these correlations as favoring an AMC that is chemically zoned along-axis, with Fe-rich melts at its distal ends. This favors a central injection of MgO-rich melt with lateral along-axis shallow transport. The height of eruptions along axis is apparently controlled by magma density such that least dense MgO-rich melts build local volcanic constructs of the highest elevation. The E-MORB lavas are older than the N-MORB and probably erupted {{at a time when the}} AMC was absent or was much smaller in size than presently. E-MORB could have originated by deep melting processes or very shallow contamination of N-MORB. Its presence in the 9 ° 30 ′N area supports the notion that magma chambers are not truly steady state. Instead they probably come and go on a time scale of 3000 – 6000 years. A single parental magma seems to supply melts to the AMC along the entire 60 km segment of the EPR, suggesting that central supply injection sites are widely spaced. Based on our data, there is no evidence for petrologic segmentation corresponding to 4 th-order tectonic segmentation in this area; however, it may be present below the resolution of our sampling...|$|R
40|$|Gabbroic {{rocks in}} sills {{commonly}} display well organized magnetic fabrics that are generally attributed to magma flow. Yet {{in a number}} of cases, magnetic fabrics that are considered proxies for flow fabrics, form at a high angle to the intrusive - host rock wall. A symmetrical oblique magnetic fabric observed in opposite margins of a dike has been interpreted as the result of viscous drag against the margin, a model referred to as fabric imbrication. In this study tested if a similar viscous drag model could also apply to sills. The Karoo Large Igneous Province (LIP) of South Africa offers unparalleled opportunities to investigate fabrics, internal zonation and magma flow in mafic sills of thicknesses ranging from 5 to 50 m. Exceptionally; Karoo sills can reach a 1000 m in thickness (e. g., Insizwa). Geochemical studies suggest that the Karoo gabbro sills have a consistent tholeiitic magma composition across the entire Karoo Basin, especially as far as major elements are concerned. It is also practically undeformed and upon initial inspection unweathered, making it a well suited natural laboratory to test fabric models in gabbro sills. Magnetic fabrics are generally considered a good proxy for magmatic fabrics. The anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility has been measured on oriented hand specimens collected across vertical profiles through two representative sills. Scalar parameters such as magnetic susceptibility, degree of anisotropy and shape factor show variations with height in the intrusion. The variations in these parameters can be interpreted in terms of magmatic dynamic and static processes such as, for example, thermal convection, <b>gravitational</b> crystal <b>settling</b> or magmatic mush compaction. Directional parameters provide additional constrains on the dynamic vs. static nature of fabric-forming processes. Petrographic studies indicate that the primary carrier of the magnetic properties of the Karoo gabbros is titanomagnetite. Accessorily, pyrrhotite and hematite are present, but not in sufficient quantities to account for more than 1 % of the sampled intrusions magnetic properties. Hydrous phyllosilicates are present in one sample, suggesting some alteration has occurred at the upper contact of the Country Club Road sill. Magnetic fabrics of the studied sills reveal complex susceptibility and remanence fabrics as a function of stratigraphic height. The proposed fabric development model does not sufficiently describe the observations, thus these fabrics were formed by a combination of mechanisms, both early and late in the cooling history of the intrusions. The observed magnetic fabrics display properties consistent with both the fabric imbrication model and the proposed viscous shear model. It is possible that crystal settling, melt segregation and possibly convection processes also were likely integral to the formation of the magnetic fabrics of the studied Karoo sills, though further studies are necessary...|$|R

All roof beams may slip off supports, and collapse. Equipment may slip off from supports and fall onto the floor.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate source term (UO{sub 2 }F{sub 2 } and HF) during such a seismic event.

40|$|This thesis {{focused on}} the {{development}} and analysis of {{a new class of}} magnetic fluids for recovery of recombinant proteins from fermentation broth. Magnetic fluids are colloidally stable dispersions of magnetic nanoclusters in water that do not <b>settle</b> <b>gravitational</b> and moderate magnetic fields due to their small size. The magnetic nanoclusters possess large surface area for protein adsorption without any porous structure, resulting in much faster mass transfer than in traditional separations. The magnetic nanoclusters consist of 25 - 200 nm clusters of 8 nm magnetite (Fe₃ 0 ₄) cores coated with poly(acrylic acid-co-styrenesulfonic acid-co-vinylsulfonic acid). For use in separation, clusters must be recoverable from solution. Individual nanoparticles are too small to be recovered efficiently, while 50 nm or larger clusters of primary particles are easily recovered. Cluster size depends on polymer molecular weight and hydrophobicity as well as the amount of polymer present at nucleation. When a polymer coating with optimal molecular weight is used in limited amounts, clusters are formed. When the clusters are subsequently coated with additional polymer, the clusters are stable in high ionic strength environments (> 5 M NaCl), while retaining the necessary cluster size for efficient magnetic recovery. (cont.) Models have been developed to predict the optimal molecular weight, and the cluster size obtained with limited amounts of polymer or polymers other than the optimal molecular weight. The models and methods have been verified with other polymer coatings, indicating that the methods can be used to synthesize a wide range of stable nanoclusters. Due to rapid mass transfer, the rate-limiting step of the purification scheme is recovery of the nanoclusters from solution with high gradient magnetic separation (HGMS). The nanoclusters can be recovered extremely efficiently, up to 99. 9 % at high flow rates, up to 10, 000 cm/hr. A detailed model of HGMS has been developed to quantitatively predict capture, and simpler methods have been developed to predict the maximum capture and capacity of the column without computationally expensive simulations. The use of the nanoclusters for protein purification was studied both with model proteins the recombinant protein drosomycin from Pichia pastoris fermentation broth. The nanoclusters have high adsorptive capacities of up to 900 mg protein/mL adsorbent, nearly an order of magnitude higher than the best commercially available porous adsorbents. Adsorption can be performed both by ion exchange and hydrophobic interactions, allowing nearly pure drosomycin to be recovered from clarified fermentation broth in a single step. (cont.) When used in whole cell broth, the nanoclusters bind to proteins {{on the surface of the}} Pichia pastoris cells at conditions where drosomycin is bound, limiting the effectiveness of the separation. When proteins are bound at conditions where nanoclusters do not bind to cells, cell clarification and protein purification can be performed in one fast step. A simple model of the cell binding has been developed, providing guidelines for use of magnetic nanoparticles in the presence of cells. by Andre Ditsch. Thesis (Ph. D.)
