25|$|Neutron {{poisoning}} and tritium {{production from}} lithium-6 - Lithium-6 {{is a strong}} neutron poison; using LiF with natural lithium, with its 7.5% lithium-6 content, prevents reactors from starting. The high neutron density in the core rapidly transmutes lithium-6 to tritium, losing neutrons that are required to sustain break-even breeding. Tritium is a radioactive isotope of hydrogen, which is nearly identical, chemically, to ordinary hydrogen. In the MSR the tritium is quite mobile because, in its elemental form, it rapidly diffuses through metals at high temperature. If the lithium is isotopically enriched in lithium-7, and the isotopic separation level is high enough (99.995% lithium-7), the amount of tritium produced {{is only a few}} hundred grams per year for a 1GWe reactor. This much smaller amount of tritium comes mostly from the lithium-7 - tritium reaction and from beryllium, which can produce tritium indirectly by first transmuting to tritium-producing lithium-6. LFTR designs that use a lithium salt, choose the lithium-7 isotope. In the MSRE, lithium-6 was successfully removed from the fuel salt via isotopic enrichment. Since lithium-7 is at least 16% heavier than lithium-6, and is the most common isotope, lithium-6 is comparatively easy and inexpensive to extract. Vacuum distillation of lithium achieves efficiencies of up to 8% per stage and requires only heating in a vacuum chamber. However, about one fission in 90,000 produces helium-6, which quickly decays to lithium-6 and one fission in 12,500 produces an atom of tritium directly (in all reactor types). Practical MSRs operate under a blanket of dry inert gas, usually helium. LFTRs offer a good chance to recover the tritium, since it is not highly diluted in water as in CANDU reactors. Various methods exist to trap tritium, such as <b>hydriding</b> it to titanium, oxidizing it to less mobile (but still volatile) forms such as sodium fluoroborate or molten nitrate salt, or trapping it in the turbine power cycle gas and offgasing it using copper oxide pellets. ORNL developed a secondary loop coolant system that would chemically trap residual tritium so that it could be removed from the secondary coolant rather than diffusing into the turbine power cycle. ORNL calculated that this would reduce Tritium emissions to acceptable levels.|$|E

40|$|One of the {{challenges}} for gaining a more fundamental understanding of the behaviour of hydrogen in nanocrystalline metals is the quantification in real‐time of the amount and rate of hydrogen uptake and release. In this respect, we recently developed a new experimental technique for studying the <b>hydriding</b> behaviour of metallic thin films in‐situ, based on high resolution curvature measurements [1]. In the thin film geometry, such curvature changes during <b>hydriding</b> arise from the constrained volume expansion upon interaction of hydrogen with the metallic thin film. The use of thin film model systems was also shown to allow more easily to separate the different rate‐controlling steps involved during <b>hydriding.</b> In the current paper, we extend this work to adress specific mechano‐chemical coupling effects during <b>hydriding,</b> and illustrate how these may lead to significant improvements in both hydrogen storage capacity as well as uptake and release rate. In the case of room temperature <b>hydriding</b> of nanocrystalline thin films for instance, a first characteristic regime was observed {{at the beginning of}} hydrogen uptake, the kinetics of which are significantly enhanced by the presence of pre‐existing tensile internal stresses in the film. Based on such in‐situ curvature data, {{we have been able to}} quantify the effect of such pre‐existing internal stresses on relevant kinetic and thermodynamic <b>hydriding</b> parameters for a number of tailored nanocrystalline thin film microstructures.
