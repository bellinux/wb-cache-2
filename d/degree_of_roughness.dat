My brother, perceiving my trouble, said, [...] "Sir, if you do not carry her, you will break her heart"; but he made the same reply, adding, [...] "Your father would be grievously angry if I should." [...] "I will venture that," [...] said I. And thus, with much entreaty, he was prevailed on; and O how glad was I to think I was going. Soon after we set out, my father came to my brother's, and asked his men whom his daughter rode behind? They said, Mr. Bunyan. Upon hearing this, his anger was greatly inflamed; he ran down the close, thinking to overtake me, and pull me off the horse, but we were gone out of his reach.|$|E

One of their own philosophers observes that in one or two generations the nation will probably combine the ease and elegance of the old character with force and solidity.

50|$|In {{order to}} ensure optimum {{cleanability}} of the surfaces of machines and equipment, they must fulfill certain requirements. Where surfaces {{come into contact with}} media, no deposits may be formed which could impair product quality. Therefore, the surface roughness of such areas should be below 0.8 µm (see EHEDG doc. 8). If the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>roughness</b> is exceeded, resistances may develop during disinfection processes. These occur when microorganisms only come into contact with disinfectants but are not killed by them. When ascertaining the cleanability of a surface with regard to particles, the analysis can be carried out in correlation with the surface cleanliness classes described in VDI 2083 Part 9.1. Surface roughness can be measured, for example, using profile methods (DIN EN ISO 11562) or AFM (atomic force microscope).

Named as circulating light sources (CLS), its multiple light sources aligned in a circle illuminate sequentially, and produce images including shadow of the object surface.
