5|$|When {{diamonds}} {{are grown}} by the high-pressure high-temperature technique, nickel, cobalt {{or some other}} metals are usually added into the <b>growth</b> <b>medium</b> to facilitate catalytically the conversion of graphite into diamond. As a result, metallic inclusions are formed. Besides, isolated nickel and cobalt atoms incorporate into diamond lattice, as demonstrated through characteristic hyperfine structure in electron paramagnetic resonance, optical absorption and photoluminescence spectra, and the concentration of isolated nickel can reach 0.01%. This fact is by all means unusual considering the large difference in size between carbon and transition metal atoms and the superior rigidity of the diamond lattice.|$|E
5|$|Louis Pasteur (1822–1895) exposed boiled broths to the air, in {{vessels that}} {{contained}} a filter to prevent particles from passing {{through to the}} <b>growth</b> <b>medium,</b> and also in vessels without a filter, but with air allowed in via a curved tube so dust particles would settle and not {{come in contact with}} the broth. By boiling the broth beforehand, Pasteur ensured that no microorganisms survived within the broths {{at the beginning of his}} experiment. Nothing grew in the broths in the course of Pasteur's experiment. This meant that the living organisms that grew in such broths came from outside, as spores on dust, rather than spontaneously generated within the broth. Thus, Pasteur dealt the death blow to the theory of spontaneous generation and supported the germ theory of disease.|$|E

25|$|Impedance {{microbiology}} is a rapid microbiological {{technique used}} to measure the microbial concentration (mainly bacteria but also yeasts) of a sample by monitoring the electrical parameters of the <b>growth</b> <b>medium.</b> It is {{based on the fact that}} bacteria metabolism transforms uncharged (or weakly charged) compounds into highly charged compounds thus changing the <b>growth</b> <b>medium</b> electrical properties. The microbial concentration is estimated on the time required for the monitored electrical parameters to deviate from the initial baseline value.|$|E

The fact that GLB44 is grown in vegetable juice means GLB44 does not contain any of the seven major allergens for which the U.S. Food and Drug Administration requires additional labeling: lactose, gluten, soya, peanuts, tree nuts, fish or crustacean shellfish.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{effects of}} {{different}} concentrations of IAA exogenously applied to Proteaceae plants {{of the genus}} Leucadendron laxum {{on a variety of}} rooting medium were studied. The aim {{of the study was to}} evaluate the rooting response of tip cuttings of nature-grown shrubs using an intermittent mist propagation system in a shaded tunnel. The IAA treatments included a control, 500, 1000, 2000 and 4000 ppm IAA auxins. The <b>growth</b> <b>mediums</b> tested were: a) bark/polystyrene (1 : 1); b) peat moss/polystyrene (1 : 1); c) bark/river sand /polystyrene (1 : 1 : 1); and d) perlite/river sand (1 : 1). Each treatment was replicated in ten pots. Overall, the exogenous supply of IAA had a positive effect in the advancement of rooting in L. laxum grown in a) peat/polystyrene and b) bark/river sand/polystyrene mediums. With regard to <b>growth</b> <b>mediums,</b> results indicated that the a) bark/ polystyrene and b) peat/polystyrene mediums were significantly superior in promoting different aspects of rooting when compared with the other mediums. Evidence from this study was conclusive that the shade tunnel was an economical and successful environment in rooting L. laxum...|$|R

40|$|Norepinephrine {{stimulates the}} growth of a range of {{bacterial}} species in nutritionally poor SAPI minimal salts medium containing 30 % serum. Addition of size-fractionated serum components to SAPI medium indi-cated that transferrin was required for norepinephrine stimulation of growth of Escherichia coli. Since bacte-riostasis by serum is primarily due to the iron-withholding capacity of transferrin, we considered the possibility that norepinephrine can overcome this effect by supplying transferrin-bound iron for growth. Incubation with concentrations of norepinephrine that stimulated bacterial <b>growth</b> in serum-SAPI <b>medium</b> resulted in loss of bound iron from iron-saturated transferrin, as indicated by the appearance of monoferric and apo- isoforms upon electrophoresis in denaturing gels. Norepinephrine also caused the loss of iron from lactoferrin. The pharmacologically inactive metabolite norepinephrine 3 -O-sulfate, by contrast, did not result in iron loss from transferrin or lactoferrin and did not stimulate bacterial <b>growth</b> in serum-SAPI <b>medium.</b> Norepinephrine formed stable complexes with transferrin, lactoferrin, and serum albumin. Norepinephrine-transferrin and norepinephrine-lactoferrin complexes, but not norepinephrine-apotransferrin or norepinephrine-albumin com-plexes, stimulated bacterial <b>growth</b> in serum-SAPI <b>medium</b> in the absence of additional norepinephrine.

25|$|Fungi are not plants, {{and require}} {{different}} conditions for optimal growth. Plants develop through photosynthesis, {{a process that}} converts atmospheric carbon dioxide into carbohydrates, especially cellulose. While sunlight provides an energy source for plants, mushrooms derive all of their energy and growth materials from their <b>growth</b> <b>medium,</b> through biochemical decomposition processes. This {{does not mean that}} light is an unnecessary requirement, since some fungi use light as a signal to induce fruiting. However, all the materials for growth must already be present in the <b>growth</b> <b>medium.</b> Instead of seeds, mushrooms reproduce sexually during underground growth, and asexually through spores. Either of these can be contaminated with airborne microorganisms, which will interfere with mushroom growth and prevent a healthy crop. Mycelium, or actively growing mushroom culture, is placed on growth substrate to seed or introduce mushrooms to grow on a substrate. This is also known as inoculation, spawning or adding spawn. Its main advantages are to reduce chances of contamination while giving mushrooms a firm beginning.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} an {{on-going}} RMIT University project {{that aims to}} link campus greening initiatives with learning and teaching outcomes with a particular emphasis on sustainability-what it means {{and how it can}} provide a useful framework for evaluation. The focus is on education for and through sustainability rather than education about sustainability. Stage 1 of the project involved designing, developing and evaluating green roofs to consider what is best practice sustainable design. It began with a series of comparative precedent and practice based case studies and background research on various typologies, <b>growth</b> <b>mediums</b> and plant materials. From these initial studies, pilot green roof modules were developed. The modules tested suitable vegetation and alternative <b>growth</b> <b>mediums.</b> The project was then taken into a living laboratory context, where third-year students built, maintained, and monitored the performance of the green-roof modules. Stage two of the project aims to build on these outcomes through further student-led environmental monitoring including the development and testing of techniques to evaluate biodiversity and productive landscape benefits as well as microclimatic condition. The final stage of the project will focus on the development and testing of a Post Occupancy Evaluation Framework for the roof garden pilot project to inform future design development and curriculum innovation...|$|R

30|$|Many {{members of}} the P. aeruginosa group {{isolated}} from either patients or oil sludge were known to produce rhamnolipids (Muller et al. 2012). Biosynthesis of rhamnolipids depended on three key enzymes RhlA, RhlB, and RhlC (Ochsner et al. 1994 a, b; Rahim et al. 2001; Rehm et al. 1998). To test whether transcription of these genes in the ZS 1 isolate was induced upon <b>growth</b> in <b>medium</b> with glucose as sole carbon source, we performed quantitative reverse transcriptase (qRT)—PCR analysis. To this end, we found that transcription of all three enzymes-encoding genes was induced with the peak at 35  h after <b>growth</b> in MS <b>medium</b> supplemented with 2 % glucose (Fig.  2 b).
