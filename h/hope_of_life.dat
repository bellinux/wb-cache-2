2500|$|From this Letter {{we learn}} that Henry VIII sent Cromwell money while in the Tower and {{it appears to have}} given him more than a <b>hope</b> <b>of</b> <b>life.</b> Moreover, Thomas Cromwell was granted the {{extraordinary}} 'privilege' of being told of the charges against him and who his accusers were. When Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk was himself arrested in 1546, he [...] "prayed the lords to intercede with the king, that his accusers might be brought face to face, to say what they had against him and he did not doubt but it should appear he was falsely accused. He desired to have no more favour than Cromwell had, he himself being present when Cromwell was examined." [...] He added that Cromwell [...] "desired, if he might not see his accusers, that he might at least know what the matters were and if he did not answer truly to every point, he desired not to live an hour longer. He had always been pursued by great enemies about the king so that his fidelity was tried like gold." ...|$|E

Yes, I {{understand}} it now: death {{will open the}} lips and bring forth the truth, when the dearest <b>hopes</b> <b>of</b> <b>life,</b> when the sharpest pang of the heart fail to do so. Had he not been sure that life with him was gone, {{he never would have}} spoken of his love. He was a weak, foolish man.

6000|$|It has {{not been}} {{hitherto}} known, either that Sprot kept back Letter IV till almost his dying day, or that he then, at last, revealed it. Lord Cromarty’s averment that it was found in Sprot’s kist was disbelieved.

6000|$|Sprot now confesses that {{he knows}} he is to die, deposes that no man has promised him life, {{and that he has}} stated nothing in <b>hope</b> <b>of</b> <b>life.</b> With tears he deplores that he has taken God’s name in vain, in {{swearing}} to the truth of his depositions before that of July 5.

6000|$|Now, {{different}} {{was their}} state indeed, {{and there in}} that high place, whence perhaps many a wretched creature had been cast to death, whence certainly the Portuguese maiden had sought her death, these two happy beings were not ashamed to give thanks to Heaven for the joy which it had vouchsafed to them, and for their <b>hopes</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> full and long to be travelled hand in hand.

60|$|So the Argonauts escaped {{for that}} time: but Father Zeus saw that foul crime; {{and out of}} the heavens he sent a storm, and swept the ship far from her course.
