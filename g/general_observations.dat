5|$|Abnormalities of behavior, {{also called}} {{abnormalities}} of activity, include observations of specific abnormal movements, {{as well as}} more <b>general</b> <b>observations</b> of the patient's level of activity and arousal, and observations of the patient's eye contact and gait. Abnormal movements, for example choreiform, athetoid or choreoathetoid movements may indicate a neurological disorder. A tremor or dystonia may indicate a neurological condition or the side effects of antipsychotic medication. The patient may have tics (involuntary but quasi-purposeful movements or vocalizations) which may be a symptom of Tourette's syndrome. There are a range of abnormalities of movement which are typical of catatonia, such as echopraxia, catalepsy, waxy flexibility and paratonia (or gegenhalten). Stereotypies (repetitive purposeless movements such as rocking or head banging) or mannerisms (repetitive quasi-purposeful abnormal movements such as a gesture or abnormal gait) may be a feature of chronic schizophrenia or autism.|$|E

However, Brown also prepared a paper of more <b>general</b> <b>observations.</b> Entitled Observations, systematical and geographical, on the herbarium collected by Professor Christian Smith, {{in the vicinity of the}} Congo, during the expedition to explore that river, under the command of Captain Tuckey, in the year 1816, this appeared first as Appendix V of the official account of Tuckey's expedition, published posthumously under Tuckey's name in 1818, as Narrative of an expedition to explore the River Zaire.|$|E
25|$|Grimm joined other {{academics}} (known as the Göttingen Seven) {{who signed}} a protest against the King of Hanover's abrogation of the constitution which had been established some years before. As a result, he was dismissed from his professorship and banished from the Kingdom of Hanover in 1837. He returned to Kassel with his brother, who had also signed the protest. They remained there until 1840, when they accepted an invitation from the King of Prussia to move to Berlin, where they both received professorships and were elected members of the Academy of Sciences. Jacob was not under any obligation to lecture and he seldom did so, but spent his time working together with his brother on their great dictionary. During their time in Kassel, Jacob regularly attended the meetings of the academy, where he read papers on widely varied subjects. The best-known of those subjects are Lachmann, Schiller, old age, and the origin of language. He also described his impressions of Italian and Scandinavian travel, interspersing his more <b>general</b> <b>observations</b> with linguistic details, {{as is the case}} in all his works. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1857.|$|E

Beckinsale had {{claimed that the}} Daily Mail invaded her and her daughter's privacy by publishing photographs of the actress embracing and kissing her then new boyfriend Len Wiseman. The article was headlined [...] "Mummy's latest love scene leaves Lily unimpressed" [...] and included a picture in which her four-year-old daughter appeared to be ignoring her mother's romantic actions. The Commission found that [...] "the photographs had been taken {{in a public place}} and did not reveal any private details about Lily—such as her health or schooling—but were restricted to <b>general</b> <b>observations</b> about her apparent reaction to her surroundings." [...] In August 2003, Beckinsale received a published apology from the Daily Mail after the newspaper reported that she had [...] "spent time in a clinic" [...] following her split from boyfriend Michael Sheen. The apology was issued after the actress {{filed a complaint with the}} Press Complaints Commission. In 2009 Beckinsale was awarded £20,000 in damages by the British High Court after taking legal action against Express Newspapers. The Daily Express had falsely reported that the actress was [...] "facing heartbreak" [...] after missing out on a part in a remake of Barbarella.|$|E
