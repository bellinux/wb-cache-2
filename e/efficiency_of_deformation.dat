40|$|The {{satellite}} multi-temporal radar interferometry {{technology has}} been often widely used to monitor the regional ground deformation. However, due to {{the limitations of the}} lifetime and revisit cycle, a single satellite platform cannot provide sufficient data sources for estimating and analyzing the long-time deformation monitoring (e. g. spanning 5 to 10 years). In order to extend the time span of deformation monitoring, this paper proposes the model-constrained small baseline subset (MC-SBAS) method by using the multi-platform SAR images. This method can integrate the SAR datasets from different satellites and improve the <b>efficiency</b> <b>of</b> <b>deformation</b> monitoring. The validation is performed by taking the Southern California as the study area and using 10 ERS SAR images (acquired between 2002 and 2005) and 20 EnviSat ASAR images (acquired between 2004 and 2008). In this validation, the spatiotemporal deformation information with the extending time span of 6. 5 years in the study area is extracted by the MC-SBAS method, thus extending the time span of deformation tracking to 6. 5 years. The quality of deformation results derived from both MC-SBAS and the conventional SBAS method is assessed and compared by using the ground truth data obtained from the 6 GPS tracking stations. The validation result shows that the root mean squared error (RMSE) between the MC-SBAS and GPS results is 8. 7 mm, which is less than the RMSE between the SBAS and GPS results (11. 7 mm). In addition, the continuity and accuracy in the deformation time series derived from MC-SBAS are improved remarkably...|$|E

In contrast, in studies using large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) as model membranes, ArfGAP 1 functioned as an uncoating factor inhibiting COPI vesicle formation.

During the excavation process of a deep soft rock tunnel, the rock wall may be compacted due to large deformation.

40|$|Radial basis {{function}} interpolation {{is often}} employed in mesh deformation algorithms for unstructured meshes, {{for example in}} fluid–structure interaction or design optimization problems. This {{is known to be}} a robust methodology that results in high quality deformed meshes. The applicability of this method to large problems is currently hampered by its prohibitive computational cost, however, which is caused by the need to solve a dense system of equations. The computation time grows as O(N 3 b) if a direct solver is employed for the solution (where Nb denotes the number of boundary nodes in the mesh), while alternative iterative solvers often suffer from an unfavorable convergence behavior. In this paper, we present the inverse fast multipole method as a novel fast approximate direct solver with a computational cost scaling as O(Nb). The linear complexity is achieved by transforming the dense system into an extended sparse system, along with the compression of certain matrix blocks into low-rank factorizations. The solver is inexact, although the error can be controlled and made as small as needed; a low accuracy solver can hence be used as an efficient preconditioner in an iterative scheme. Numerical benchmarks are presented, demonstrating that the proposed approach enhances the computational <b>efficiency</b> <b>of</b> mesh <b>deformation</b> algorithms based on radial basis function interpolation significantly, without jeopardizing their robustness and qualitystatus: publishe...|$|R

Previous analysis does not consider the bulk <b>deformation</b> <b>of</b> the CVT components. However, the bulk <b>deformation</b> <b>of</b> the CVT components is not negligible to predict the <b>efficiency</b> <b>of</b> the unit.

40|$|In {{the first}} part of this work 3 D-kinematics of the Earth's surface {{deformations}} is in detail analyzed. For this purpose, two new approaches are implemented that are based on the Lagrangian and Isoparametric representations <b>of</b> <b>deformation.</b> Although from mathematical point of view, the study of the 3 D-kinematics <b>of</b> <b>deformations</b> looks a straightforward extension of its counterpart in two-dimensions; characteristics like the network configuration raise complexities that challenges this process. It is shown that the 3 D-representation of the Earth's surface deformations is an ill-posed problem. The conditioning of the problem has been analytically and numerically analyzed. In this connection, a diagnosis method has been formulated for the sensitivity analysis <b>of</b> <b>deformation</b> tensor. The <b>efficiency</b> <b>of</b> this method has been verified using the simulated <b>deformations</b> <b>of</b> this study. The stability of least-squares solution for the 3 D-Isoparametric and Lagrangian representations of the synthetic and real <b>deformations</b> <b>of</b> this study has been analyzed by the discrete Picard condition. Truncated Singular Value Decomposition (TSVD) is proposed as a simple and efficient technique for regularizing the solution when the stability of least-squares solution is not assured. To come up with a tradeoff between the stability and resolution of regularized solutions, perturbation theory of the TSVD solution is used for finding an optimum regularization parameter. The <b>efficiency</b> <b>of</b> the method has been verified by analyzing the relative errors for synthetic deformations. Regularized solutions conform to the other available results on the post-seismic pattern <b>of</b> crustal <b>deformations</b> in the test area of this study. A statistical method has been devised for analyzing the deformation changes in space or time which is based on the assumptions that strain tensor elements are normally distributed and that no gross error are present among the deformations to be analyzed. Using this method, it is not only possible to statistically analyze the significance of the change in deformations, but also to localize the variations that were statistically asserted in the previous step. The method is partially based on the Procrustes analysis <b>of</b> <b>deformation</b> tensors. Therefore, it is given here the name of Procrustean Statistical Inference <b>of</b> <b>Deformations.</b> To localize the deformation changes, procrustean residuals are screened. Thereby significant changes are statistically assigned to certain parameters <b>of</b> <b>deformation.</b> For this purpose, BIBER robust estimator has been modified and used. In modified BIBER-estimator both the quality of residuals and the redundancy of observations are taken into account. For this purpose, the threshold <b>of</b> minimum detectable <b>deformation</b> changes (internal reliabilities of observations) has been implemented in the loss function of the modified BIBER-estimator. The application of the new (robust) estimator makes it possible to assign a certain probability to the detected significantly changed parameters <b>of</b> <b>deformation.</b> The <b>efficiency</b> <b>of</b> the method has been analyzed by simulated deformation changes. Moreover, the method is implemented in the test area of this study to analyze the spatial variations <b>of</b> three-dimensional <b>deformations.</b> In this study, also an attempt is made to formulate the effect of the GPS systematic errors on the parameters <b>of</b> <b>deformation.</b> As the result, a set of deterministic models have been developed that formulates possible deviations of the parameters <b>of</b> <b>deformation</b> when some residual or unavoidable systematic errors are expected to be present in the GPS results...|$|R

The influence of the degree <b>of</b> <b>deformation</b> on the recrystallization temperature remains constant for a large increase in the amount <b>of</b> <b>deformation</b> and then suddenly increases sharply to very high temperatures for only a slight increase in the amount <b>of</b> <b>deformation.</b> Anglai...|$|R
30|$|The <b>deformation</b> data <b>of</b> super-high arch dams reveal {{at least}} three aspects: (1) the {{absolute}} <b>deformation</b> <b>of</b> the arch dam; (2) the dynamic level of time series <b>of</b> <b>deformation,</b> that is, the deformation growth with time; and (3) the fluctuation <b>of</b> <b>deformation</b> development, that is, the degree of variation or fluctuation. The focus of this chapter is dam deformation zoning based on the similarity <b>of</b> <b>deformation</b> sequence when the dam structure has not obviously changed or the time series <b>of</b> the <b>deformation</b> that has smoothly change. The similarity <b>of</b> the <b>deformation</b> sequence is reflected by combining the “absolute deformation” and “deformation growth” of the dam.|$|R
