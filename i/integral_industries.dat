40|$|Since the mid- 90 s, the {{computer}} industry has been very modular with respect to both product architecture and industry structure. The growing market size of mobile computers means that the challenges facing this segment are starting to affect {{the direction of the}} industry. It is argued in this paper that power management in mobile computers is forcing the industry in the direction of more integral product solutions and, hence, a more <b>integral</b> <b>industry</b> structure. That is to say, the industry is assuming a structure similar to the early days of mainframe computers when one firm delivered the entire proprietary integral system. Furthermore, this trend towards more integrality in mobile computer systems is due to fundamental physical attributes of the system; specifically, that information transfer systems lend themselves more readily to modular architectures than systems that transfer significant power. Thus, as processors and mobile computers become more powerful, they start to behave more like power transfer systems and side effects of this power, such as heat, require a more integral approach to managing it. A "free body" diagram framework is presented which provides a way of thinking about how integrality forces are acting on an industry's trajectory. Evidence is presented showing how the dominant player in {{the computer}} supply chain, Intel, is exhibiting this vertical/integral behavior in a number of ways. by Samuel K. Weinstein. Thesis (S.

40|$|About {{sixty percent}} of the power in {{industries}} is consumed by induction machines, which implies induction machines are an <b>integral</b> part of <b>industries.</b> Even though these motors are stalwart and rugged in construction, they often experiences faults due to long time usage without maintenance. Bearing damage accounts 40 % in the total faults and cause severe damage to the machine if unnoticed at nascent stage. So these faults should be continuously monitored for efficient operation, otherwise may cause severe damage to the machine. Conventional vibration monitoring is difficult due to requirement of high manpower and costly sensors. So motor current signature analysis (MCSA) is widely used for detection and localization of these faults. In this paper, the bearing faults are estimated by means of current frequency spectral subtraction using discrete wavelet transform. In addition to this, the current signature analysis after spectral subtraction is carried out using Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), Stationary Wavelet Transform (SWT) and Wavelet Packet Decomposition (WPD) and a comparative analysis is presented to estimate fault severity using statistical parameters. The proposed method is assessed based on current signatures obtained from a 2. 2 kW induction machine. The experimental results acknowledged the effectiveness of proposed method...|$|R

40|$|Oyster {{farming is}} one of the oldest {{aquaculture}} industries in Australia and, in New South Wales (NSW), its history dates back some 130 y. Like other industries, it has evolved over time, but during the past 5 y, a number of significant changes have occurred. Although Sydney rock oysters (Saccostrea glomerata [SRO]) remain the most important commercial species, the culture of Pacific oysters (Crassostrea gigas), particularly triploids, has increased significantly. Interest in cultivating other commercially important species, such as flat oysters, Ostrea angasi, has also increased. Overall, hatchery-produced oyster seed has become more readily accessible, particularly for S. glomerata, which, prior to 2003, had been largely unavailable to the majority of the rock oyster industry. For both S. glomerata and C. gigas, breeding programs have become an <b>integral</b> part of <b>industry</b> development and have been the primary reason for hatchery seed uptake in NSW. Across the oyster industry, the emphasis placed on the importance of demonstrating environmental sustainability has increased, and both industry and government have been proactive in protecting the estuarine environments in which oyster farming occurs.

With the increased understanding derived through critical thought, fundamental experiments, <b>integral</b> experiments and <b>industry</b> experience, this has evolved into a discipline where issues are considered on design specific and accident sequence specific bases. Fundamentally there are two reasons for pursuing an understanding of severe accidents. 1. To evaluate the response of a given reactor/containment design for a spectrum of severe accident conditions to determine whether design modifications are warranted. This could be for either an operating plant or a future design and the modifications could relate to accident prevention and/or mitigation of the consequences. 2. To understand the nature of severe accidents, how they progress and how they can be stopped. Such knowledge is generally used to determine the most effective actions for an accident situation as well as to understand what actions are sufficient. With the above areas, it is important to periodically step back from the phenomenological details and examine where the nuclear community (the industry and the regulators) stand with respect to the two major uses of this knowledge. Only through such periodic assessments can the community focus the limited resources towards addressing the remaining issues. This is one individuals assessment of where we stand...|$|R

In this study, we analyzed the nitrogen processes of Beijing considering the influences from human activities and nature under the framework of urban metabolism. Ecological network {{analysis was used to}} track the integral (direct + indirect) flows and to compare the contribution of direct and indirect flows at both the scale of each component and of the whole urban system during the period from 1996 to 2012. We found that Atmosphere, Household, and Industry had the most interactions with other nodes in the network. The <b>integral</b> flow from <b>Industry</b> to Atmosphere, which was consistently at 200 Gg, was the largest at five time points; the flow from Household to Sewage treatment grew fastest, and in 2012, increased to 5. 9 times its 1996 value; the flow from Industry to Farmland decreased most obviously, and in 2012, it decreased to 12. 9 % of the value in 1996. Moreover, the indirect effects were dominant for the whole system in Beijing with a ratio of indirect to direct flow equal to 1. 2. Surface Water and Forest had the strongest indirect effects maintaining a ratio of almost 2. Meanwhile, exploitation and competition relations were most frequent and their proportions were much larger than the proportion of mutualism relations.

40|$|Sexual {{harassment}} is significantly {{more common in}} hospitality than in other industries, and has {{a negative impact on}} both individuals and workplaces where it occurs. The New Zealand Human Rights Commission ’s 2001 report on sexual harassment found that 60 % of those harassed subsequently leave their place of work, indicating a significant cause of staff turnover, and a considerable expense to employers. The objectives of this study were therefore to identify the incidence and causes of sexual harassment in hospitality, so recommendations for prevention could be made to industry practitioners. As part of a wider doctoral study, quantitative and qualitative data from 534 Auckland hospitality workers were analysed, and results relating to sexual harassment identified. Of valid responses to questions on the incidence of sexual harassment, 24 % reported they had been harassed, a proportion consistent with that found in Hoel ’s 2002 British doctoral study. Customer contact was identified as a strong predictor of harassment, especially for young European women and those working in food and beverages service. Harassment was notably less prevalent where respondents had their own codes of ethics, and where training was perceived as satisfactory. High tolerance of harassment evident in written comments was associated with enjoyment {{and the nature of the}} industry, implying a sense of duty and behavioural norm extending well beyond limits accepted outside hospitality. Recommendations include the discouragement of behaviours and appearances associated with harassment by guests, such as the use of sexuality in employee – customer relationships. Training employees to reject sexual advances skilfully and professionally is also recommended, as is promoting harassment-free workplaces to both guests and staff using codes of ethics, pamphlets, or posters. However, as the root causes of sexual harassment are may be outside the reach of such prevention strategies, the discussion also addresses the implications of working in commercial hospitality. The tradition of sexual behaviour in hospitality is therefore addressed, and its relationship to the sexual favours provided in pre-Christian taverns, where barmaids were also prostitutes. The study concludes that sexual {{harassment is}} pervasive in hospitality, in part, because it is perceived as <b>integral</b> to the <b>industry</b> by both staff and customers...|$|R
40|$|Mechanical {{bearings}} are an <b>integral</b> part of <b>industry,</b> and {{are used}} in various places to reduce friction between two interacting surfaces {{and are used}} to transmit power and loads. Mechanical bearings {{are one of the}} most extensively used components within the wind industry, but on the other hand they are also one the most dominantly failed components. To increase the feasibility of wind energy, and to make the wind power more sustainable, a reduction in operation and maintenance cost of wind energy is important. The failures in bearings in wind energy sector and other industries increased after introduction of switched power electronic switches (Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistors or IGBT) within the power converters. The reasons of early failures have been linked to presence of common mode voltage at the neutral of the converter and its coupling on the shaft, where the bearings are located. The system is also vulnerable to different types of bearing currents, which are discussed in this report. Presently, the mitigation techniques mainly discharge the voltage across the bearing by providing a low resistance path for the flowing current using different methods, such as carbon brushes, shaft rings, but damages due to bearing current activity and early failures still exist. Another way to mitigate bearing currents is to use filters in the electrical connections, to obstruct or to reduce the amplitude of the bearing currents, but they fail to completely eliminate them. The use of insulating coating on surfaces of the bearing and ceramic rolling elements helps to provide high resistive path for current in case of DC voltage, but act capacitively and let the current pass through the bearing when high frequency circulating type bearing currents flow in the system. Nevertheless, to device a successful mitigation technique, it is important to fully understand the electrical breakdown and discharge activity within the bearing’s insulation (i. e., the lubricating film) along with electrical properties of bearing during running conditions. In our research, we have focused on understanding the electrical properties of the mechanical bearing at different operating conditions and elaborating it through an electrical circuit model. The components of this electrical circuit model are found out experimentally through different laboratory tests. The mechanical bearing is sometimes found to behave as an insulator of electricity and is hence characterized by an impedance during the ‘Insulating state’ of the bearing in the model. The impedance in this insulating state is further categorized as a parallel combination of resistor and a capacitor (parallel RC branch), which corresponds to the ‘real’ and ‘imaginary’ part of the measured bearing impedance. Furthermore, when the bearing enters in a partial breakdown state, the voltage across the bearing is ‘discharged’ resulting in flow of current through the bearing until the voltage across the bearing again recovers. Electrical characterization of bearing lubricants has been performed to find out the relevant electrical properties such as relative permittivity, electrical conductivity and electric breakdown strength at rather short gaps. The electrical behavior of the mechanical bearing at different operating conditions such as rotational speed, mechanical load along with magnitude, frequency and shape of applied voltage has been found out experimentally in order to understand and elucidate the electrical properties of a mechanical bearing in operation...|$|R
