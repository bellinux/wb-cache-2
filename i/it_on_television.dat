25|$|The {{film was}} shot in Almeria, Spain in {{widescreen}} on locations built for the Westerns made by Sergio Leone. Its production was particularly traumatic for cast and crew. Whity, a mixture of Euro-western and American South melodrama, was badly received by the critics and became Fassbinder's biggest flop. The film was neither picked up for theatrical release nor was there interest for broadcasting <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>television.</b> As a result, Whity was only seen as its premiere. It remained unavailable until the 1990s when it began to be screened and now, like almost all of Fassbinder's films, is available on DVD.|$|E

25|$|Returning to Watkins Glen, Ambrose started {{fifth and}} {{dominated}} {{part of the}} race but was passed in a three-wide move by Kyle Busch with 20 laps remaining. When the white flag was about to wave he saw that Busch was slipping in oil; in {{the entrance to the}} esses he and Brad Keselowski passed him; Ambrose then saw that Keselowski was slipping in oil too and he took the lead in the final turn, holding off Keselowski {{for the second time in}} a row and defending his win from the previous year. Ambrose was very emotional about his win due to his father seeing <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>television</b> in a hospital for an illness and due to his luck that day. The win moved Ambrose up one position in the standings from 18th to 17th. Ambrose still has promised the racing world for a future oval win since his #1 goal currently is to prove he can win at places other than road courses.|$|E
