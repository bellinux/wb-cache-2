40|$|Summary. The paper {{presents}} {{results of}} {{tests on the}} AD 3. 152 UR engine, carried out on a chassis dynamometer. The tests were made according to two different static load cycles, (5 and 8 phase). The operation economy of the tested engine was compared based on weighted averages of specifi c fuel consumption. It was found that in a 5 -phase cycle the tested engine was characterized by lower specifi c fuel consumption and lower effective power, compared to an 8 -phase cycle. It was also found that a 5 -phase cycle could be representative for the province of Pomorze Zachodnie, provided the phase sequences {{are similar to the}} tractor <b>engine</b> <b>time</b> density characteristics.

The model is developed around airline-influenced factors that {{have an impact on}} engine Maintenance Repair & Overhaul (MRO) : Operations, maintenance philosophy, contract type, and fleet age. Within the model a decision support tool is developed to analyze the impact of possible changes made to variables that influence engine MRO (engine thrust setting, shop visit schedule, and shop visit workscopes) on maintenance cost. The objective of the model is to support Engineering & Maintenance in defining a maintenance philosophy, which includes <b>engine</b> <b>time</b> on-wing and life limited parts management strategies.

40|$|In this work, {{we focused}} {{mainly in the}} {{analysis}} of stability of a non-endoreversible Curzon-Ahlborn engine working in an ecological regime. For comparison purposes we also include the Maximum Efficient Power (MEP) regime taking into account the <b>engine</b> <b>time</b> delays. When the system’s dynamic stability is compared with its thermodynamics properties (efficiency and power output), we find that the temperature ratio τ = T 1 /T 2 represents a trade-off between stability and energetic properties. When we take the non-endoreversible case, τ can increases to values greater than R (where R is the non-endoreversible parameter) but not greater than one. We reformulate an important difference between this case and the other two, Maximum Power (MP) and MEP regime, in which τ = R. Finally, we demonstrated that the total time delay does not destabilize the steady state of system. It does not seem {{to play a role in}} the dynamic thermodynamic property trade-off...|$|E

Location of the four wing-mounted engines was varied to optimize the propulsive control capability, and the time constant of the engine response was studied. The goal was to provide level 1 flying qualities. The engine location and <b>engine</b> <b>time</b> constant did not have a large effect on the control capability. The airplane design did meet level 1 flying qualities based on frequencies, damping ratios, and time constants in the longitudinal and lateral-directional modes. Project pilots consistently rated the flying qualities as either level 1 or level 2 based on Cooper-Harper ratings. However, because of the limited control forces and moments, the airplane design fell short of meeting the time required to achieve a 30 deg bank and the time required to respond a control input...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of {{applying}} lifetime (or reliability database) statistical analysis methods to engine removal data recorded over the initial 8 years ’ service of the General Electric F 414 -GE- 400 turbofan engines propelling the F/A- 18 E/F Super Hornet in service with the USNavy, {{with the intent of}} better understanding the reasons for engine removal and their impact on <b>engine</b> <b>time</b> on wing (TOW), and to gain an insight into the reliability of the modules and components from which the engine is assembled. It was found that ‘‘coloring’ ’ the engine removals into three classes of reasons for removal enabled lifetime data analysis revealing interesting and useful features of in-service engine reliability. Nonparametric statistical analysis provided actionable information on engine removal probability as a function of TOW and removal cause that should be applicable to planning flight operations, line maintenance, and support logistics. The analysis of engine removals due to hot sec-tion distress appears to disconfirm the presumption of independence between the three classes of removal. Opportunistic maintenance of modules made accessible due to engine removals to service other modules may significantly affect the observed engine removal distribution of the module of interest, i. e., competing risk masks the underlying module hazard functions...|$|E
