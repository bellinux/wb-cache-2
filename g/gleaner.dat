The {{hurricane}} demolished {{three-quarters of}} the structures on Grand Turk Island, while the remaining intact buildings were damaged. The cyclone also produced heavy damage on Long Island, though damages were not reported in Nassau. Peak gusts were estimated near 40mph (65km/h) in Nassau. After the storm, The Daily <b>Gleaner</b> initiated a fund to offer aid for residents in the Turks and Caicos Islands.|$|E
5|$|Writing in the Jamaican {{broadsheet}} The <b>Gleaner,</b> Carolyn Cooper, Professor of Literary and Cultural Studies at UWI, {{condemned the}} group who committed Jones' murder. She blamed their behaviour on the selective {{use of the}} Bible, noting that while many Jamaicans embrace those Biblical passages which condemn same-sex sexual activity and cross-dressing, they are themselves typically guilty of many other Biblical sins, such as adultery and murder. She commented that Jones had been killed just for being himself and expressed the hope that his killers face legal prosecution for their crime. The following week she published a follow-up article in which she responded to several emails that she had received which claimed that the real victims of the scenario were the men whom Jones deceived when he was dancing with them. She reiterated her condemnation of Jones' killers, remarking that rather than retaliating violently, they should have brushed {{it off with a}} humorous comment.|$|E
5|$|Headley's {{success for}} Dudley was watched keenly in Jamaica and {{commentators}} began {{to discuss his}} availability for the 1954 series against England. A public subscription to finance his travel to Jamaica, opened by the Daily <b>Gleaner,</b> raised over Â£1,000, and despite his reservations, Headley returned to Jamaica. Playing in a fund-raising match, he sustained a hand injury and playing for the Combined Parishes in a minor match against the MCC, a short ball from Fred Trueman struck Headley's arm. The latter injury {{kept him out of}} the first-class match between Jamaica and the MCC, but he played in the second where, although hampered by his injury, he scored 53 not out. The Test selectors had seen enough to include Headley in the team for the first Test. Reaction among critics was mixed, and Headley, nearing his 45th birthday, remains the oldest man as of 2015 to play a Test match for West Indies. Headley batted at number six, and it appeared that England, under the captaincy of Len Hutton, let Headley score an easy run to begin his innings, which Hutton later confirmed to be the case. However, Headley later argued that the run was given to ensure that he was batting {{at the beginning of the}} next over, so that England could try to get him out before he settled down.|$|E

25|$|One month later, Knight {{wrote that}} <b>Gleaner</b> had {{captured}} the French privateer Adelaide some six leagues WNW of Cape St Vito (Sicily). While both vessels were lying becalmed, the privateer used her sweeps {{to bring her}} into position to attack <b>Gleaner.</b> Adelaide was armed with six guns and had a crew of 46 men. Nevertheless, she struck to <b>Gleaner.</b> Adelaide was five days out of Naples and had taken nothing. Knight's letter was dated at Plymouth on 6 May, suggesting that <b>Gleaner</b> {{had been in the}} Mediterranean carrying dispatches, and then returned.|$|E

25|$|In 1955, {{the company}} {{acquired}} <b>Gleaner</b> Manufacturing Company, {{which was an}} important move for its combine harvester business. Allis was the market leader in pull-type (tractor-drawn) combines, with its All-Crop Harvester line. But acquiring <b>Gleaner</b> meant that it would now also be a leader in self-propelled machines, and it would own two of the leading brands in combines. The <b>Gleaner</b> line augmented (and later superseded) the All-Crop Harvester line, and for several years Gleaner's profits made up nearly all of Allis-Chalmers' profit. Gleaners continued to be manufactured at the same factory, in Independence, Missouri, after the acquisition.|$|E
25|$|Lieutenant Alexander Branch {{returned}} to command of <b>Gleaner</b> on 2 December 1813, {{on the north}} coast of Spain. As the Duke of Wellington moved on Bayonne, <b>Gleaner</b> blockaded the Ardour river. On 24 February 1814 when a flotilla of hired and purchased boats crossed the highly dangerous waters at the bar to the river, preparatory to erecting a floating bridge, Rear-Admiral Penrose hoisted his flag on <b>Gleaner</b> to supervise the operation. Although some boats had been lost {{and a number of}} men drowned, 25 chasse marees and some gunboats succeeded in getting into the river. There they formed a 900-yard long floating bridge.|$|E
25|$|Admiral Penrose chose <b>Gleaner</b> to {{take the}} dispatches {{concerning}} the operation to create the bridge back to Britain, but asked Branch to wait at Saint-Jean-de-Luz {{for the arrival of}} one of General Lord Wellington's officers with dispatches from the general. The weather worsened on 1 April but <b>Gleaner</b> was well-anchored and prepared and rode out the storm until the morning of 2 April. Unfortunately, the storm drove a merchant sloop across Gleaners bows. Gleaners crew separated the two vessels, and the crew of the sloop was able to take shelter on the ketch before their sloop sank. As the winds worsened they drove <b>Gleaner</b> under the bows of a transport brig, where she became so trapped that she started to come apart from the action of the wind and waves. By 5pm <b>Gleaner</b> was so damaged that her crew and that of the sloop transferred to the transport brig. The combined crews were able to cut <b>Gleaner</b> free. The waves swept her onto the beach and she disappeared within minutes. The brig was able to rid out the storm until the next day, but then her crew was forced to cut her cables and to drive her on to the beach. All the survivors made it safely ashore. In all, the storm wrecked 17 vessels.|$|E

25|$|On 23 October 1813 <b>Gleaner,</b> {{still under}} the command of William Knight, was in sight when Andromache {{captured}} the French frigate Trave after an engagement of only 15 minutes. Trave, although a new vessel, had lost her masts in a storm and was sailing under jury-rigged masts and so unable to maneuver. She was armed with twenty-eight French 18-pounder long guns and sixteen 18-pounder carronades, and had a crew of 321 men, almost all Dutch. Before she struck she had one man killed, and 28 men wounded, including her commander capitaine de frÃ©gate Jacob Van Maren. Andromache had little damage and only two men wounded. The Royal Navy took Trave into service as the troopship Trave.|$|E
25|$|In 1928, Henry Ford {{canceled}} U.S. {{production of}} the Fordson. This disrupted the business of many firms: farm equipment dealers who sold Fordsons and aftermarket equipment builders whose attachments were designed to mount on Fordsons (for example, the <b>Gleaner</b> combines of the 1920s mounted on Fordsons, and many Fordson industrial tractors used aftermarket attachments). Many of these firms formed a conglomerate in 1928 called the United Tractor & Equipment corporation. United arranged a deal with Allis-Chalmers to build a tractor to substitute for the now-missing Fordson. Around 1930, the United conglomerate collapsed. The reasons that various authors have given have been disagreements between its investors, {{the onset of the}} Great Depression, and the fact that Ford Motor Company Ltd of England, which was continuing the Fordson line independently of the U.S. Ford company, began exporting new Fordsons to America. The United tractor became the Allis-Chalmers Model U.|$|E
25|$|On 19 July Ringdove {{captured}} the schooner Rover, of 98 tons (bm), sailing from Liverpool for Amelia Island. Rover was carrying coals, earthenware, and hardware. Once again <b>Gleaner</b> was in sight. On {{the same day}} Ringdove {{captured the}} ship Four Sisters, of 204 tons (bm), from Lisbon, bound to New York, and laden with 1000 dollars. The next day Ringdove captured the brig Hesper, of 264 tons (bm). Hesper was sailing in ballast from Liverpool to Norfolk. The run of good fortune continued into August when on 1 August Ringdove captured three vessels. First came the Eight Sisters, bound to Boston, and sailing in ballast. Second was the Hannibal, bound to St. Bartholomew with a cargo of flour. Lastly, Ringdove captured the Orpha, which was sailing to Puerto Rico, also with a cargo of flour. At some point Ringdove also captured the San Pedro and the Marstrand.|$|E

500|$|Jaevion Nelson, an HIV/AIDS campaigner {{and human}} rights advocate, also {{published}} {{an article on the}} subject in The <b>Gleaner.</b> He noted that his initial reaction was to question why Jones had gone to the dance party and why he was not satisfied in attending Jamaica's underground gay parties. He added that he had subsequently realised that adopting this viewpoint was rooted in [...] "the culture of violence" [...] by which a victim is blamed for what happened to them. He called on Jamaicans to be tolerant of LGBT individuals, and to focus on [...] "rebuilding this great nation on the principles of inclusivity, love, equality and respect with no distinctions whatsoever". Also in The <b>Gleaner,</b> Sheila VelÃ©z MartÃ­nez, {{a law professor at the}} University of Pittsburgh, condemned the murder as [...] "alarming evidence" [...] of the high rates of homophobia in Jamaican society.|$|E

500|$|The MCC went to Jamaica for {{the final}} leg of their tour. Headley played two matches for Jamaica against the tourists; he failed {{in the first game}} but scored 127 in the second. The teams went into the fourth and final Test with the series still level at one win apiece. West Indies batted first, facing {{accurate}} bowling. The local press criticised the West Indies batsmen for slow batting on the first day, but Headley scored 132. The Daily <b>Gleaner</b> noted that Headley maintained the controlled approach he had established in the season. On the second day, he took his score to 270 not out, and the <b>Gleaner</b> described him as [...] "the genius we all know, scoring with all his old freedom and audacity." [...] In total, he batted for 495 minutes and hit 30 fours, recording the highest score by a West Indian batsman. It remained a West Indian record until Garfield Sobers scored 365 not out in 1958, and was the team's highest against England until Lawrence Rowe scored 302 in 1974. West Indies scored 535 for seven and bowled out England twice to record their first victory in a Test series. Headley contributed 485 runs at an average of 97.00.|$|E
