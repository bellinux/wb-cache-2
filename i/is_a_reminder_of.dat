5|$|Although {{it is hard}} to {{test the}} hearing of sharks, they may have a sharp sense of hearing and can {{possibly}} hear prey from many miles away. A small opening on each side of their heads (not the spiracle) leads directly into the inner ear through a thin channel. The lateral line shows a similar arrangement, and is open to the environment via a series of openings called lateral line pores. This <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> <b>of</b> the common origin of these two vibration- and sound-detecting organs that are grouped together as the acoustico-lateralis system. In bony fish and tetrapods the external opening into the inner ear has been lost.|$|E

Above the lion are a crossed flail and scythe; the flail comes from {{the arms of the}} de Trafford family; the scythe <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> <b>of</b> the agricultural history of the area; the thunderbolts above represent the importance of electricity in Stretford's industrial development. The boat at the bottom represents Stretford's links to the sea via the Manchester Ship Canal.|$|E

The Petagas War Memorial, located near KKIA, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> <b>of</b> those who died when they went against the Japanese forces during World War II. It is situated at the place where the Kinabalu Guerrillas were killed by the Japanese army in 1944. The Double Six Monument, located in Sembulan, is also a memorial to remember Sabah's first Chief Minister and six other state ministers who died on a plane crash known as the Double Six Tragedy on 6 June 1976.|$|E

25|$|The Torah {{says that}} it is because the Hebrews left Egypt with such haste that {{there was no time to}} allow baked bread to rise; thus flat, unleavened bread, matzo, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> <b>of</b> the rapid {{departure}} of the Exodus. Other scholars teach that in the time of the Exodus, matzo was commonly baked for the purpose of traveling because it preserved well and was light to carry (making it similar to hardtack), suggesting that matzo was baked intentionally for the long journey ahead.|$|E

25|$|The {{lion and}} the four stars of the Southern Cross on the St George's Cross have {{reference}} to the State of New South Wales which established the university; the open book with scientia ("knowledge") across its pages <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> <b>of</b> its purpose. The placement of scientia on the book was inspired by its appearance on {{the arms of the}} Imperial College of Science, Technology and Medicine formed in 1907. Beneath the shield is the motto Manu et Mente ("With hand and mind"), which was the motto of the Sydney Technical College from which the university developed.|$|E
25|$|From {{a social}} and {{cultural}} standpoint, the Old Casino is significant in that it expresses to this day the lifestyle of the area's wealthy families during {{the early decades of}} the 20th century. It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> <b>of</b> how they lived and how World War II changed that lifestyle for ever. The lavish second floor ballroom was extensively used prior to WWII as the de facto meeting place for the most wealthy and influential families in Ponce and Puerto Rico. The Casino is associated with the social club that made the structure come to life, a club that has ceased to exist as today's way of life have pushed aside the lifestyle of the aristocracy of yesterday.|$|E

25|$|Father Time, a Saturn-like image, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> <b>of</b> {{the tragedy}} of death and loss, yet the next sunrise comes, {{bringing}} with it hope of a new day. In the first cycle of creation, evil is external (the devil). In the second cycle, we see the beginnings of family hatred, bad behavior, and evil permeating human nature. Shāh Fereydūn's two eldest sons feel greed and envy toward their innocent younger brother and, thinking their father favors him, they murder him. The murdered prince's son avenges the murder, and all are immersed in the cycle of murder and revenge, blood and more blood. In the third cycle, we encounter a series of flawed shahs. There is a Phaedra-like story of Shāh Kay Kāvus, his wife Sūdābeh, and her passion for and rejection by her stepson, Sīyāvash.|$|E
25|$|Faith was {{something}} that Kierkegaard often wrestled with throughout his writing career; under both his real name and behind pseudonyms, he explored many different aspects of faith. These various aspects include faith as a spiritual goal, the historical orientation of faith (particularly toward Jesus Christ), faith being a gift from God, faith as dependency on a historical object, faith as a passion, and faith as a resolution to personal despair. Even so, {{it has been argued}} that Kierkegaard never offers a full, explicit and systematic account of what faith is. Either/Or was published 20 February 1843; it was mostly written during Kierkegaard's stay in Berlin, where he took notes on Schelling's Philosophy of Revelation. According to the Routledge Companion to Philosophy and Religion, Either/Or (vol. 1) consists of essays of literary and music criticism, a set of romantic-like-aphorisms, a whimsical essay on how to avoid boredom, a panegyric on the unhappiest possible human being, a diary recounting a supposed seduction, and (vol. II) two enormous didactic and hortatory ethical letters and a sermon. This opinion <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> <b>of</b> the type of controversy Kierkegaard tried to encourage in many of his writings both for readers in his own generation and for subsequent generations as well.|$|E

50|$|Islamic scriptures, in {{its history}} and unlike Hinduism, {{compelled}} the payment of a special tax called Jizya from dhimmi, the non-Muslims {{who live in a}} Muslim state. Jizya <b>was</b> <b>a</b> tool of social stratification and treasury's revenue from non-Muslims.

500|$|As a whole, {{the album}} {{does not mention}} Jesus {{directly}} by name; the only song to do so, [...] "Bring the Rain" [...] uses {{his name in the}} refrain [...] "Jesus, bring the rain". [...] "I Would Die for You" [...] is also a tribute to a teen who died after serving on a mission field. [...] "One Trick Pony" [...] is a response to MercyMe's critics who argue that the band recycles the same song over and over. [...] "So Long Self" [...] is about bidding farewell to sinful nature, while [...] "Hold Fast" [...] <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> <b>of</b> God's presence through difficult times. [...] "Something About You" [...] and [...] "3:42 a.m. (Writer's Block)" [...] both relate to the difficulty of writing a song about an omnipotent God.|$|E
500|$|The painting's {{domestic}} setting belies its liturgical meaning. The dove <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> <b>of</b> the Eucharist and Mass. Lotte Brand Philip observes how {{throughout the}} 15th century [...] "eucharistic vessels {{made in the}} form of doves and suspended over altars… were lowered at the moment of transubstantiation"; here it suggests that in the same way the Holy Spirit gives life to the bread and wine, it gave life to the Virgin's womb. [...] She carries the Body and Blood of Christ, and is attended by three priestly angels. [...] Mary's function is to bear [...] "the Savior of the World"; the angels' role is to [...] "support, present and protect her sacred being". With the birth of Christ her [...] "miraculous womb passed its final test" [...] to become an object of veneration.|$|E
500|$|The Herald Suns Cameron Adams {{noted that}} Overloaded <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> <b>of</b> [...] "what a good pop act" [...] the Sugababes are, {{although}} he was less favourable of the new tracks. Stuart McCaighy of This Is Fake DIY concluded that Overloaded is [...] "awash with hits" [...] and is indicative of why the group was named the most successful female act of the 21st century. Tim Fenney from Pitchfork Media rated Overloaded {{eight and a half}} out of ten; he praised the more emotional tracks on the album, writing: [...] "While people may remember the group for their frothy pop, their greatest hits collection Overloaded is equally impressive for its devastatingly earnest balladry". Gigwise's Jenna Churchley-Burton described the album as [...] "pure pop perfection at its very best".|$|E
