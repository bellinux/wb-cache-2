2500|$|.....When I {{had learned}} it I {{translated}} it into English, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> understood it, and as I could most meaningfully render it. And I will send one to each bishopric in my kingdom, {{and in each}} will be an æstel worth fifty mancuses. And I command in God's name that no man may take the æstel from the book nor the book from the church. It is unknown how long there may be such learned bishops as, thanks to God, are nearly everywhere.(Preface: [...] "Gregory the Great's Pastoral Care") ...|$|E
60|$|<b>Just</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been {{speaking}} of Rothsay, {{here was the}} news of him for which I had been waiting.|$|E
60|$|<b>Just</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{resolved}} on venturing the worst, {{and making}} my escape forthwith, I heard the officers interrupt the doctor's lecture.|$|E
60|$|I {{told the}} dream {{there in the}} Club that night <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> told it here.|$|R
60|$|Then I told {{my story}} in full <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> written it here. Mr. Harrison was deeply interested.|$|R
60|$|And Tom {{told his}} story from {{beginning}} to end <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> set it down in the foregoing pages.|$|R
60|$|I {{put my arms}} round {{his neck}} and kissed him <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> done on the day when I brought my answer.|$|E
60|$|At last, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{fallen into}} a deep sleep, I was wakened by his shaking me, and saying our cab was at the door.|$|E
60|$|B. came in <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> got {{everything}} into a pile. He {{stared at the}} bed, and asked me what I was doing. I told him I was packing.|$|E
6000|$|... "Completed, Mr. Fraser!" [...] said Angela, open-eyed. [...] "Do {{you mean}} to say that I am to stop now <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> begun to learn?" ...|$|R
60|$|Thereupon he told Selim the Fisherman {{the story}} of what had {{happened}} to him with all its ins and outs, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> told it to you.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] I said, [...] "I don't know. I don't {{think any}} of it is embroidery. I think it is all <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> stated it, detail by detail." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{jumped up}} {{in a state}} of ecstasy. <b>Just</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> thrown my arms round Mrs. Staveley's neck, the servant came in with a letter, and handed it to me.|$|E
6000|$|Before {{her eyes}} could fall again, I {{held out the}} grapes and said, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> heard her say more than once to a schoolmate at lunch-time, [...] "Let's go halves." ...|$|E
60|$|A. I {{am sorry}} {{to have to say}} this, but <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{finished}} and was restoring the bag to its place, I looked up and there stood Father Peter behind me.|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear Poirot," [...] I said coldly, [...] "it {{is not for}} me {{to dictate}} to you. You have a right to your own opinion, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> to mine." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah! I see,' {{said the}} gentleman. 'These are your rural pastimes of the season. Yes, I can take my share in good part, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> pelted the masks at the Carnival.' ...|$|R
60|$|In {{a moment}} more {{we were on}} the way. While seated in the Elevated car he asked me to tell him my whole story, and <b>I</b> did so, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> written it here.|$|R
6000|$|... "And I must go {{away from}} {{everything}} <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> learnt to value it. Bob {{has taken a}} house at Monaco, and writes to me to bring the children to join him there!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Yes! There was Bruno, {{standing}} with the tears running down his cheeks, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> seen him {{a quarter of an}} hour ago; and there was Sylvie with her arms round his neck! ...|$|E
60|$|He didn't turn up at high water. I set my sail and <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{cast off}} from the bank, round the black barn, in the dusk, two figures {{appeared}} and stood silent, indistinct.|$|E
6000|$|... 'As to {{the truth}} of what I say, madam,' said I, 'refer you to your son himself; if he will do me any justice, he must tell you the story <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> told it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You would!" [...] Jack exclaimed, as much {{astonished}} as by his friend's first proposition. [...] "To {{think of}} that now! Why, you have always been with her <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>have.</b> You have never shown that you cared for her, never given her presents, nor walked with her, nor anything. And do you really care for her, Harry?" ...|$|R
60|$|Having stored {{these things}} in the prince's memory, she said: 'You will see {{everything}} happen <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> said.' Then she escorted him a little way; they parted, and she went home to mourn his absence.|$|R
60|$|He {{suddenly}} {{stopped and looked}} at me intently for several moments. Then, without a word, he rose and moving over, sat {{down on the side of}} the bed. The collapse had come, as on former occasions, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> expected.|$|E
60|$|I told {{my mother}} that I had done nothing, {{absolutely}} nothing, but attend to the wants of my son's people, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been used to see my grandmother, and my aunt Thistlewood, or any English lady, do at home.|$|E
6000|$|So they bade good-night to Mary, {{and went}} on {{together}} to the next house, Mr. Dutton saying 'You have much to forgive me, Mr. Egremont; I feel as if I had deserted the ship <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> induced you to embark in it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You have," [...] she {{continued}} gently, [...] "read all the papers, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>have,</b> {{and you know}} <b>as</b> well <b>as</b> <b>I</b> do what to {{read between the lines}} when they talk of 'clues' and of 'certain sensational developments.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Tis like an ant-hill," [...] Cyril said. [...] "'Tis <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{seen when}} a nest has been disturbed. Every ant seizes a white egg {{as big as}} itself, and rushes off with it to the passage below." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not exactly. But we {{have seen}} some rough times," [...] {{answered}} Larry, and then, as soon as Ben could get away for a quiet half-hour, he related his story in detail, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> set it down in these pages.|$|R
60|$|That {{he loved}} a {{thoroughbred}} horse himself was plain. He spoke naturally to Sally with interest, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> upon first meeting her, {{and he might}} not have been Jack Blome, for all the indication he gave of the fact in his talk.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, sir, I am {{shepherding}} {{some twenty}} miles away; and this afternoon, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{got back to}} my hut, in runs a black fellow. It is a lonely spot, and I reached for my gun, thinking there was more of them, when he said: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{we shall}} be quite lost without you. And I wanted to say this to you, Don Ippolito, that if ever {{you change your mind}} again, and {{conclude}} to come to America, you must write to me, and let me help you <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> intended to do." ...|$|E
60|$|And {{then all}} sat down, and Dave told his tale, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> related it here. It took until midnight, {{and when he}} had finished, all said good-night to each other and went to bed. And here let us say good-night, too.|$|R
60|$|HIGGINS. About you, {{not about}} me. If {{you come back}} I shall treat you <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> always treated you. I can't change my nature; and I don't intend to change my manners. My manners {{are exactly the same}} as Colonel Pickering's.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have had}} your {{share in the}} fight, Zaki, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>had.</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> not fired a shot, but <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been in the battle, and run its risks, and so have you. Each of us has done his duty, and we can say, {{for the rest of}} our lives, that we have borne our share in the great battle that has smashed up the power of the Khalifa, and the rule of the Dervishes." ...|$|R
