5|$|Habré {{selected}} as the first target for his reconquest of northern Chad the well-fortified Libyan communications base of Fada. It was defended by 2,000 Libyans and {{the bulk of the}} <b>Democratic</b> <b>Revolutionary</b> <b>Council</b> (CDR) militia (Gaddafi's closest Chadian allies), well-provided with armour and artillery. Hassan Djamous, the thirty-year-old FANT commander-in-chief, pitched about 4,000–5,000 men against Fada's Libyan garrison. Taking advantage of his army's superior knowledge of the terrain, which apparently included unknown access points to the base, Djamous avoided a frontal assault and used his forces' high mobility to surround the Libyan positions and then unleashed his troops, destroying the defending garrison. In the battle, 784 Libyans were killed and 100 tanks destroyed, while only 50 FANT soldiers died.|$|E
5|$|During {{the period}} between 1984 and 1986, in which no major clash took place, Habré greatly {{strengthened}} his position thanks to western support and Libya's failure to respect the Franco-Libyan 1984 agreement. From 1984 onwards, the GUNT also suffered increasing factional tensions, centered on the fight between Goukouni and Acheikh ibn Oumar over {{the leadership of the}} organization. Taking advantage of the GUNT's difficulties, Habré struck a series of accords with smaller rebel factions, which left the GUNT at the beginning of 1986 with only three of the eleven factions that had originally signed the Lagos Accord in 1979. The remaining factions were Goukouni's People's Armed Forces (FAP), Acheikh's armed branch of the <b>Democratic</b> <b>Revolutionary</b> <b>Council</b> (CDR) and that part of the Chadian Armed Forces (FAT) which had maintained its loyalty to Wadel Abdelkader Kamougué.|$|E
25|$|Nouri {{directed}} {{himself to}} Sudan and gave birth in July {{to a new}} formation, the Union of Forces for Progress and Democracy (Union des forces pour le progrès et la démocratie or UFPD). On the morning of October 22 Nouri founded a new rebel coalition, the Union of Forces for Democracy and Development (UFDD), which included three movements: his UFPD, the <b>Democratic</b> <b>Revolutionary</b> <b>Council</b> (CDR) led by Acheikh ibn Oumar and a splinter faction of the United Front for Democratic Change under Abdelwahid Aboud Mackaye, giving birth to a Toubou-Arab coalition. Acheikh became Vice-President while Nouri obtained the presidency, allegedly installed by the Sudanese military intelligence. On {{the same day the}} new formation left its bases for in Darfur and with 800 men mounted on 70 off-road vehicles passed {{for the first time the}} Chadian-Sudanese border. It directed its attack towards the town of Goz Beïda, that was briefly occupied, while the following day it was Am Timan to end under attack. The Chadian Prime Minister Pascal Yoadimnadji immediately accused the Sudanese government of being behind the attack, arguing that the rebels had attacked from Sudan and that they could not have obtained their military equipment without Sudanese help.|$|E
50|$|In retaliation, a pro-Libyan counter-government {{was formed}} by Siddick, Acyl, and Said, called Front for Joint Provisional Action (FACP), shortly after called <b>Revolutionary</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Council</b> (CDR).|$|R
50|$|The Crusade to Free Cuba Committee {{was founded}} in December 1961 by anti-Castro Cuban exile Sergio Arcacha Smith to raise funds {{and support for the}} CIA-backed Cuban <b>Revolutionary</b> <b>Council,</b> a group {{formerly}} known as the Cuban <b>Democratic</b> <b>Revolutionary</b> Front.|$|R
5000|$|The Cuban <b>Revolutionary</b> <b>Council</b> (CRC) {{was a group}} formed, with CIA assistance, {{three weeks}} before the April 17, 1961 Bay of Pigs Invasion to [...] "coordinate and direct" [...] the {{activities}} of another group known as the Cuban <b>Democratic</b> <b>Revolutionary</b> Front. Both groups were composed of Cuban exiles dedicated to overthrowing Fidel Castro's communist government in Cuba. José Miró Cardona, former Prime Minister of Cuba, was chairman of the Cuban <b>Revolutionary</b> <b>Council.</b> On its board of directors were: Antonio de Varona, Justo Carrillo, Carlos Hevia, Antonio Maceo, Manuel Ray, and Manuel Artime.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Democratic</b> <b>Revolutionary</b> <b>Council</b> (Conseil Démocratique Révolutionnaire or CDR) was a {{faction of}} FROLINAT founded by Ahmat Acyl and later headed by Acheikh ibn Oumar {{and was also}} known as the New Vulcan Army.|$|E
50|$|Following this, Abdelwahid with a {{group of}} FUC dissidents united with Acheikh ibn Oumar's <b>Democratic</b> <b>Revolutionary</b> <b>Council</b> (CDR) and Mahamat Nouri's Union of Forces for Progress and Democracy (UFPD) to found on October 22 the Union of Forces for Democracy and Development (UFDD).|$|E
50|$|Acyl's faction, renamed <b>Democratic</b> <b>Revolutionary</b> <b>Council</b> (CDR) at the {{beginning}} of 1979, did not participate in the battle of N'Djamena that erupted in February 1979, which caused the downfall of any form of government in Chad. Also for this he was overlooked at the first international peace conference held in March in Kano, in Nigeria; here the main militias accorded themselves for creating a government of national unity, which would exclude all pro-Libyan factions.|$|E

50|$|Abdelwahid Aboud Mackaye (born 1953) is a Chadian insurgent leader {{involved}} in the war to topple the Chadian President Idriss Déby. Originally a fighter in the <b>Democratic</b> <b>Revolutionary</b> <b>Council</b> (CDR) militia during the first Chadian Civil War, under Déby he became a civil servant before defecting to the rebels in 2003. After having been for a time first in the FUC {{and later in the}} UFDD, he has founded in 2007 the UFDD-Fundamental, which has participated in February 2008 to the unsuccessful attack on N'Djamena.|$|E
50|$|The {{government}} did not live long, principally for the exclusion from the GUNT of important Libya-supported militias, which promptly formed a counter-government, the <b>Democratic</b> <b>Revolutionary</b> <b>Council</b> (CDR), led by Ahmat Acyl. Also, many countries refused to recognize the new government: Djogo experimented this personally at the 6th Franco-African Summit held at Kigali on May 21 and May 22. Djogo had been entrusted with leading the Chadian delegation at the summit, when doubt on the GUNT's representativity voiced {{by a number of}} delegates brought to the abrupt departure of the Chadians.|$|E
50|$|This {{powerful}} force attacked Fada, {{the capital of}} the Ennedi and a Libyan stronghold, on January 2. Hassan Djamous took the 1,000 Libyan soldiers and the 300 - 400 members of the <b>Democratic</b> <b>Revolutionary</b> <b>Council</b> (CDR) militia by surprise. In a short but brutal engagement the FANT almost annihilated the Libyan armoured brigade that defended Fada: 784 Libyans died, 92 T-55 tanks and 33 BMP-1 infantry fighting vehicles were destroyed, and 13 T-55s and 18 BMP-1s captured, together with 81 Libyan soldiers. Chadian losses were minimal: only 18 soldiers died and three Toyotas were destroyed.|$|E
50|$|The Cuban <b>Democratic</b> <b>Revolutionary</b> Front {{was founded}} in May 1960 by anti-Castro Cuban exiles and was {{initially}} headquartered in Mexico. It was known in Spanish as the Frente Revolucionario Democrático (FRD) and was composed of five major anti-Castro groups. The FRD's military wing was called Brigade 2506, which fought in the Bay of Pigs Invasion Cuban exile Sergio Arcacha Smith was the head the New Orleans chapter of the FRD. In December 1960, Arcacha Smith opened {{an office in the}} Balter Building at 403 Camp Street, Room 207. This was the building where anti-Castro activist and accused JFK assassination conspirator Guy Banister had had his office until July 1960. In October 1961, the FRD was absorbed by the Cuban <b>Revolutionary</b> <b>Council,</b> and Arcacha moved the office to 544 Camp Street for several months. Arcacha was forced out of his position in January 1962 by a group of local anti-Castro exiles.|$|R

He went into exile when Hissein Habré took power on June 7, 1982 and joined the <b>Democratic</b> <b>Revolutionary</b> <b>Council</b> headed by Acheikh Ibn Oumar; however, he did not return to Chad when Acheikh joined with Habré in 1988. He eventually returned on 7 June 1991, after Déby took power. He was director-general of two ministries before serving as the Director-General of the National Sugar Company (SONASUT) between 1996 and 1999.|$|E
50|$|Rebel {{commando}} groups (Codos) {{in southern}} Chad were broken up by government massacres in 1984. In 1985 Habré briefly reconciled {{with some of}} his opponents, including the Democratic Front of Chad (FDT) and the Coordinating Action Committee of the <b>Democratic</b> <b>Revolutionary</b> <b>Council.</b> Goukouni also began to rally toward Habré, and with his support Habré successfully expelled Libyan forces from most of Chadian territory. A cease-fire between Chad and Libya held from 1987 to 1988, and negotiations {{over the next several years}} led to the 1994 International Court of Justice decision granting Chad sovereignty over the Aouzou strip, effectively ending Libyan occupation.|$|E
50|$|The {{international}} community, led by Nigeria, {{tried to}} bring order to the expanding chaos in Chad {{through a series of}} international peace conferences. But the first peace conference held in March excluded minor factions, like the Volcan Army; as a reaction they created the Front for Joint Provisional Action (FACP), a counter-government supported by Libya and opposed to the new Transitional Government of National Unity (GUNT). As the first compromise proposals failed, the FACP swiftly renamed itself <b>Democratic</b> <b>Revolutionary</b> <b>Council</b> (CDR), and assumed as its leader Ahmat Acyl.

50|$|But as Goukouni's {{relations}} with the OAU and France improved, his ties with Libya deteriorated. One reason for this deterioration was that the economic assistance that Libya had promised never materialized. Another, and perhaps more significant, factor was that Gaddafi was strongly suspected of helping Goukouni's rival within GUNT, Acyl Ahmat, leader of the <b>Democratic</b> <b>Revolutionary</b> <b>Council</b> (Conseil Démocratique Révolutionnaire or CDR). Both Habré and Goukouni feared Acyl because he {{and many of the}} members of the CDR were Arabs of the Awlad Sulayman tribe. About 150 years earlier, this group had migrated from Libya to Chad and thus represented the historical and cultural basis of Libyan claims in Chad.|$|E
50|$|Under Nigerian pressure, Lol {{was made}} {{head of the}} Transitional Government of National Unity on April 29, 1979, by the four factions present at Kano I. The GUNT {{included}} 21 ministers, of whom 11 were northerners and 10 were southerners. Goukouni Oueddei, head of the FAP, became Interior Minister, Hissène Habré became Defence Minister, and Wadel Abdelkader Kamougué, leader of the Chadian Armed Forces (FAT), became vice-president. But the transitional government excluded all the pro-Libyan forces; as a result, a rival government, backed by Muammar al-Gaddafi, was formed; {{it was called the}} <b>Democratic</b> <b>Revolutionary</b> <b>Council,</b> and it was headed by Ahmat Acyl, an Arab.|$|E

50|$|As the AML was readily air transportable, {{it came to}} {{form the}} {{materiel}} strongpoint of the French Foreign Legion's rapid deployment force. The Legion AMLs saw combat overseas, either as part of single deployments by the 1st Foreign Cavalry Regiment or to provide fire support for other Legion regiments. Crews perfected unique airfield assaults in which AML-90s were unloaded directly from Transall C-160s onto the objective, with infantry joining them by parachute. They could also deploy from Breguet 941 and Nord Noratlas aircraft. These vehicles first saw combat against BTR-152s manned by FROLINAT rebels in Chad during Opération Tacaud, successfully engaging an insurgent mechanised column approaching Salal around April 1978. On 18 May another sixteen AMLs, supported by a company of French infantry, routed FROLINAT elements advancing on Ati. In the subsequent months, additional AML-90s rushed in by the Régiment d'infanterie-chars de marine (RICM) repelled a major offensive near Abéché by the Chadian <b>Democratic</b> <b>Revolutionary</b> <b>Council,</b> which was backed by fifty Libyan T-55 tanks and EE-9 Cascavel armoured cars.|$|E

After two months of the coup, the <b>Revolutionary</b> <b>council</b> implemented ‘Burmese way to socialism (BWS)” a socio-economic foundation {{which most of the}} <b>revolutionary</b> <b>council</b> build their policies on. Subsequently, the <b>revolutionary</b> <b>council</b> founded ‘Burma Socialist Program Party (BSPP)’ on 4 July 1962 and this was emerged as a political organisation to lead the socialist revolution in Burma. General Ne Win’s <b>revolutionary</b> <b>council</b> was acknowledged by Chinese government two days after the coup. In order to implement the Burma way to socialism, General Ne Win’s government started to carry out its economic nationalisation and these include nationalisation of 6,700 Chinese stores, two of Beijing’s banks and all Chinese schools and newspapers between 1964 and 1965.
