5|$|<b>Instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>focusing</b> on {{individual}} organisms, paleoecology examines {{the interactions between}} different organisms, such as their places in food chains, and the two-way interaction between organisms and their environment.  One example {{is the development of}} oxygenic photosynthesis by bacteria, which hugely increased the productivity and diversity of ecosystems. This also caused the oxygenation of the atmosphere. Together, these were a prerequisite for the evolution of the most complex eukaryotic cells, from which all multicellular organisms are built.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, the Australian {{government}} {{announced that the}} national service scheme would be implemented once again, however, <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>focusing</b> upon expanding the CMF, the scheme was set up so that national servicemen would serve limited terms of service in Australian Regular Army (ARA) units {{with a view to}} service overseas in Vietnam and Malaysia. This highlighted the changing focus of Australia's military planning towards Regular forces, however, it had a negative impact upon the division as essentially it was forced to compete with the ARA for manpower and although some gains were made from men that chose to serve longer national service terms in the CMF in order to defer their service in ARA units, these were negligible and arguably of limited quality. The government's decision not to deploy CMF units to these conflicts meant that many of the division's experienced personnel chose to transfer to ARA units in order to gain operational experience, although some attempts were made to rectify this situation by offering CMF officers the opportunity to undertake a short attachment to an ARA unit serving in Vietnam and a number of 3rd Division officers took up this opportunity, a few even saw combat.|$|E

25|$|Light rays bend {{when they}} travel from one medium to another; the amount of bending is {{determined}} by the refractive indices of the two media. If one medium has a particular curved shape, it functions as a lens. The cornea, humours, and crystalline lens of the eye together form a lens that focuses images on the retina. Our eyes are adapted for viewing in air. Water, however, has approximately the same refractive index as the cornea (both about 1.33), so immersion effectively eliminates the cornea's focusing properties. When our eyes are in water, <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>focusing</b> images on the retina, they now focus them far behind the retina, resulting in an extremely blurred image from hypermetropia.|$|E

Virgin Media signed an agreement with Cable & Wireless to become the unbundled local loop (LLU) network provider, providing access to 4million homes outside of the Virgin Media cable franchise network and would include linear pay broadcast channels and video on demand. This was originally scheduled to be released during 2008 but was delayed and scaled back as Virgin Media concentrated on improving its cable broadband proposition <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>focusing</b> on competing with Sky in the premium television market.

As a former Chancellor, Papen had granted this privilege of by-passing the Foreign Minister while he was Ambassador to Austria. Ribbentrop's friendship with Papen, which went back to 1918, ended over this issue. At the same time, Ribbentrop took to shouting at the Turkish Ambassador in Berlin, Mehemet Hamdi Arpag, {{as part of the}} effort to win Turkey over as a German ally. Ribbentrop believed that Turks were so stupid that only by shouting at them could one make them understand. One of the consequences of Ribbentrop's heavy-handed behaviour was the signing of the Anglo-Turkish alliance of 12 May 1939.|$|E
25|$|Fendt, {{part of the}} AGCO corporation, {{has also}} {{been working on a}} driverless tractor. In 2011 in Hanover at the Agritechnica show, Fendt {{presented}} their driverless tractor model called the GuideConnect. The GuideConnect is a tractor programmed to mirror the movements of another tractor. An operator-driven tractor maneuvers through a field or through crops and is followed by a driverless tractor. Because the first tractor has a driver, he or she can manually steer to avoid obstacles with the driverless tractor following. <b>Instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>focusing</b> on a completely independent piece of technology, Fendt made GuideConnect to work together with operator-controlled machinery. GuideConnect is connected by satellite navigation and radio to the operator-driven tractor. The two perform as one unit. The one with the driver leads while the one without the driver follows.|$|E

The first wave of about 1,000 naval infantrymen went ashore at 0430 on 18 August 1945.

By 0530, the Japanese had manned machine guns in pillboxes and foxholes and begun to inflict heavy casualties on the Soviets.

At 0600, some Soviet units of the first wave finally attempted {{an attack on the}} Japanese batteries on Cape Kokutan, but were too outnumbered to breach the defenses. The Soviets held off a Japanese counterattack by infantry and 20 tanks, destroying 15 of the tanks, and then charged up the heights toward the artillery sites, but were repulsed near the top.|$|E

Opting to re-establish her music career <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>focusing</b> on her film career as originally planned, Cyrus began planning the project in late 2012.

Described by Cyrus as [...] "dirty south hip-hop", Bangerz represents a musical departure from her earlier work, which she has grown to feel [...] "disconnected" [...] from. As executive producers, Cyrus and Mike Will Made It collaborated with hip hop producers including Cirkut, Pharrell Williams, and will.i.am to achieve Cyrus' desired new sound. Their efforts resulted in a primarily pop record, with lyrical themes that revolve largely around romance. It features guest vocals from several new partners, including pop singer Britney Spears and rappers French Montana, Future, Ludacris, and Nelly.|$|E
