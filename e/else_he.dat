5|$|Around 1786, Marshall gained public {{attention}} by expressing his suspicions about James Wilkinson's negotiations with Spain for free {{use of the}} Mississippi River {{and the possibility of}} Kentucky's secession from the United States to affiliate with Spanish possessions. For the remainder of his life, he vigorously opposed Wilkinson and anyone <b>else</b> <b>he</b> suspected of being involved with the Spanish Conspiracy.|$|E
5|$|Coke {{was noted}} as {{deriving}} great enjoyment from and working {{hard at the}} law, but enjoying little <b>else.</b> <b>He</b> was versed in the Latin classics and maintained a sizeable estate, but the law was his primary concern. Francis Bacon, his main competitor, {{was known as a}} philosopher and man of learning, but Coke had no interest in such subjects. Notably, when given a copy of the Novum Organum by Bacon, Coke wrote puerile insults in it.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to purges, banishments and censorship, Rosas took measures against {{the opposition and}} anyone <b>else</b> <b>he</b> deemed a threat that historians have considered state terrorism. Terror was a tool used to intimidate dissident voices, to shore up support among his own partisans and to exterminate his foes. His targets were denounced, sometimes inaccurately, as having ties to Unitarians. Those victimised included members of his government and party who were suspected of being insufficiently loyal. If actual opponents were not at hand, the regime found other targets that were punished to make an example. A climate of fear was used to create unquestioning conformity to Rosas' dictates.|$|E

5|$|Irene was Johnson's only play, and {{was first}} {{performed}} on 6 February 1749 in a production {{by his friend}} and former pupil, David Garrick. The play was a commercial success and earned Johnson more money than anything <b>else</b> <b>he</b> had written up to that point. It was never revived during his lifetime, {{and there is no}} subsequent evidence of any other full-scale productions of Irene anywhere until 1999, {{making it one of the}} most unsuccessful plays ever written by a major author.|$|E
5|$|James Peter Greaves (born 20 February 1940) is {{a former}} England {{international}} footballer who played as a forward. He is England's fourth highest international goalscorer (44 goals), Tottenham Hotspur's highest ever goalscorer (266 goals), the highest goalscorer {{in the history of}} English top-flight football (357 goals), and has also scored more hat-tricks (six) for England than anyone <b>else.</b> <b>He</b> finished as the First Division's top scorer in six seasons.

5|$|Noda is a {{self-reliant}} {{young man}} who executes the strategies formed by the SSS and fights with a halberd. He does not listen to anyone other than Yuri, for whom he has adoration, and is antagonistic to almost everyone <b>else.</b> <b>He</b> has a one-sided rivalry with Otonashi. He is a complete idiot whose weakness is education; at one point, Takeyama is able to knock him out by reciting pi. He {{is not afraid to}} harm or kill anyone who gets in Yuri's way. Though he prefers to fight with his halberd, he sometimes uses guns out of necessity, the type of weaponry that he hates.|$|E

5|$|Richardson {{left the}} art school in 1920, and {{considered}} how <b>else</b> <b>he</b> {{might make a}} career. He briefly thought of pharmacy and then of journalism, abandoning each when he learned how much study the former required and how difficult mastering shorthand for the latter would be. He was still unsure what to do, when he saw Sir Frank Benson as Hamlet in a touring production. He was thrilled, and felt at once that he must become an actor.|$|E
5|$|Slaves {{had special}} sexual {{restrictions}} and obligations. For example, a slave could not engage free boys in pederastic relationships ("A slave {{shall not be}} the lover of a free boy nor follow after him, or <b>else</b> <b>he</b> shall receive fifty blows of the public lash."), and they were forbidden from the palaestrae ("A slave shall not take exercise or anoint himself in the wrestling-schools."). Both laws are attributed to Solon. Fathers wanting to protect their sons from unwanted advances provided them with a slave guard, called a paidagogos, to escort the boy in his travels.|$|E

5|$|Vilhelm Dahlerup {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{productive}} 19th-century architects. Perhaps more than anyone <b>else,</b> <b>he</b> contributed to the way Copenhagen appears today. His most important buildings include Copenhagen's Hotel D’Angleterre (1875) and the Danish National Gallery (1891). With the support of the Carlsberg company, he designed the Ny Carlsberg Glyptoteque (1897) and a number of lavishly decorated buildings at the Carlsberg Brewery site, now under redevelopment as a new district in Copenhagen.|$|E
5|$|Castellaneta started acting {{after his}} {{graduation}} from Northern Illinois University in 1979. He {{decided that if}} his career went nowhere he would {{still have a chance}} to try something <b>else.</b> <b>He</b> began taking improvisation classes, where he met his future wife Deb Lacusta. Castellaneta started to work at The Second City, an improvisational theatre in Chicago, in 1983 and continued to work there until 1987. During this period, he did voice-over work with his wife for various radio stations. He auditioned for a role in The Tracey Ullman Show and his first meeting underwhelmed Tracey Ullman and the other producers. Ullman decided to fly to Chicago to watch Castellaneta perform. His performance that night was about a blind man who tries to become a comedian and Ullman later recalled that although there were flashier performances that night, Castellaneta made her cry. She was impressed and Castellaneta was hired.|$|E
5|$|He fell badly out {{of shape}} before the 1993–94 season and was told by manager Dino Zoff to lose two stone (13kg) {{by the start of}} the {{campaign}} <b>else</b> <b>he</b> would lose his first team place. Gascoigne went on an extreme weight loss diet and succeeded in shedding the excess fat. He kept his place in the team and captained the club against US Cremonese when regular captain Roberto Cravero was substituted. However, in April he broke his leg in training whilst attempting to tackle Alessandro Nesta. Upon his recovery he was disgruntled with new head coach Zdeněk Zeman's stern fitness approach, and both club and player decided to part ways {{at the end of the}} 1994–95 season.|$|E

5|$|I fell in {{love with}} him as a ten-year-old boy. I saw him in a play in New York... a very well-staged melodrama which was an {{enormous}} hit for about a year—it was made as a movie later with somebody <b>else.</b> <b>He</b> had the leading role, and I never forgot him. And through the years I'd seen him in movies—little things. And I could never forget that performance of his. He's always played very stereotyped parts in pictures but is one of the best actors I've ever known. I have such respect for him. You play next to him and you just feel the thing that you do with a big actor—this dynamo going on.|$|E
5|$|The two {{exchange}} wits; Jessica requests that Dain {{send her}} brother back to England {{in exchange for}} a valuable religious icon she will sell him, while Dain wants the icon or <b>else</b> <b>he</b> will destroy her reputation and ruin her brother. They reach an impasse, and while her reputation remains intact, Dain spends the week personally overseeing Bertie's disintegration from excessive drinking and gambling. Jessica angrily confronts him and the two unexpectedly kiss. Later, at a party they almost consummate their relationship before being discovered by other party-goers. Dain coldly departs, assuming Jessica invited the others to force him to honorably marry her, leaving her angry that he would leave her reputation in tatters so casually.|$|E
5|$|The two try to {{convince}} Sheila to stop the projection, but as she is inexperienced with the device, she instead ends up projecting Steiner to somewhere <b>else.</b> <b>He</b> ends up at a construction site, the hideout of a band of thieves who are attempting to break into a bank. It is learned that an error in the projection has given Steiner the ability to kill people by touching them, and has mutilated one half of his body. Steiner kills the criminals, and then enters a store, where he steals a pair of rubber gloves and a coat. He then breaks into the institute, where he finds Latham and kills him. He also destroys the building's power supply, alerting Hill and Mitchell that something is wrong. By this time, Inspector Davis (Derek Farr) has discovered {{the bodies of the}} criminals and is determined to stop Steiner.|$|E

5|$|While fleeing, Stan {{calls his}} mother, who is too busy protesting Terrance and Phillip {{to listen to}} his problems. More than a dozen people have killed {{themselves}} against the headquarters building. Eventually, the network agrees to take the show off the air, not because of the deaths but because of the stench of the protesters' explosive diarrhea. Meanwhile, Death continues chasing the boys, but stops in front of a television playing Terrance and Phillip. Death and the boys start laughing together, but after it is taken off the air, Death angrily touches and kills Kenny. Angered, Grandpa Marvin demands that Death kill him, but Death refuses. Death then brings in the spirit of Stan's great great grandfather (Marvin's grandfather), who was killed by Marvin when he was Stan's age; the ghost warns Marvin that he must die of natural causes and not place the burden of his suicide on anybody else's shoulders or <b>else</b> <b>he</b> will spend his eternity after death in limbo.|$|E
5|$|First-team coach Ronnie Moran {{took charge}} of team affairs for several weeks before Graeme Souness was named as Dalglish's successor. Under Souness, Liverpool won the FA Cup in 1992, but nothing <b>else.</b> <b>He</b> made way for Roy Evans, who also won just one trophy, the League Cup, before Gérard Houllier was {{appointed}} joint manager with Evans in 1998. This arrangement lasted only 18 games before Evans resigned, leaving Houllier—Liverpool's first non-British manager—in sole charge. Houllier won nothing until a treble in 2001, consisting of the FA Cup, League Cup and UEFA Cup. Houllier underwent major heart surgery during the 2001–02 season, but the squad was unaffected and managed {{to hold on to}} a second-place finish. Although Phil Thompson stepped in as temporary manager while Houllier was recovering from heart surgery, the matches played under Thompson are included in Houllier's record. Another League Cup was won in 2003, but this was to be Houllier's last trophy as Liverpool manager as he and the club parted by mutual consent {{at the end of the}} 2003–04 season, to be replaced by Valencia manager, Rafael Benítez.|$|E
5|$|On October 16, 1890, a new Mint director, Edward O. Leech, took office. Leech, aged 38 at the time, {{had spent}} his career at the Bureau of the Mint, and was an {{enthusiastic}} supporter of redesign. He took the precaution of obtaining recommendations from Barber as to suitable outside artists who might participate in a competition. Since most of the proposed artists were New York-based, Andrew Mason, superintendent of the New York Assay Office, was given the task of finalizing the list of invitees. Leading Mason's list of ten names was that of Saint-Gaudens. Mason sent Leech the recommendations on April 3, 1891; the following day, the Mint director announced the competition, open to the public, but he specifically invited the ten artists named by Mason to participate. Besides Saint-Gaudens, artists asked to compete included Daniel Chester French, Herbert Adams, and Kenyon Cox. Although Barber had warned the director that reputable artists would likely not enter a contest in which only the winner received compensation, Leech offered a $500 prize to the winner, and no payments to anyone <b>else.</b> <b>He</b> sought new designs for {{both sides of the}} dollar, and for the obverses of the half dollar, quarter, and dime—Leech was content to let the reverses of the Seated Liberty coins continue. By law, an eagle had to appear on the quarter and half dollar, but could not appear on the dime.|$|E
