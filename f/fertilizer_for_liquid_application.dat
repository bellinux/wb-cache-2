The optimization of the multilobe viscous pump performed by Etsion and Yaier (1988) is limited and is revised in Mainland and Green (1991). Figure A-l duplicates Fig. 10, the pump performance curve, and shows that the revised multilobe op-timization still results in less pumping capability than the spiral groove viscous pump. An improvement to the multilobe vis-cous pump is the V-lobe viscous pump of Mainland and Green (1991). Still, the best possible V-lobe pump, which has nine lobes for the operating conditions shown, is outperformed by the spiral groove pump as shown in Fig. A-l. Note, however, that the pumps are compared for a relatively large value of the operating conditions parameter, AP/A. These large values correspond for example to those that would be encountered in gas <b>applications.</b> <b>For</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>applications,</b> the operating con-ditions parameter could be much smaller due to the relatively larger viscosity.

The pumping capabilities of the semicircular lobe is consistently lower than the spiral groove and V-lobe viscous pumps. Although the comparison between spiral groove and V-lobe pumps depends on the number of lobes selected for the V-lobe, in general it can be concluded that at relatively large values of the operating conditions parameter (e. g., gas applications) the spiral groove performs the best.
