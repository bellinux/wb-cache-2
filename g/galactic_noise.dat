40|$|Abstract — A {{number of}} new and planned radio telescopes will consist of large arrays of low-gain antennas {{operating}} at frequencies below 300 MHz. In this frequency regime, <b>Galactic</b> <b>noise</b> can be a significant or dominant contribution to the total noise. This, combined with mutual coupling between antennas, {{makes it difficult to}} predict the sensitivity of these instruments. This paper describes a system model and procedure for estimating the system equivalent flux density (SEFD) – a useful and meaningful metric of the sensitivity of a radio telescope – that accounts for these issues. The method is applied to a LWA- 1, the first “station ” of the Long Wavelength Array (LWA) interferometer. LWA- 1 consists of 512 bowtie-type antennas within a 110 × 100 m elliptical footprint, and is designed to operate between 10 MHz and 88 MHz using receivers having noise temperature of about 250 K. It is shown that the correlation of <b>Galactic</b> <b>noise</b> between antennas significantly desensitizes the array for beam pointings which are not close to the zenith. It is also shown that considerable improvement is possible using beamforming coefficients which are designed to optimize signalto-noise ratio under these conditions. Mutual coupling is found to play a significant role, but does not have a consistently positive or negative influence. In particular, we demonstrate that pattern multiplication (assuming the behavior of single antennas embedded in the array is the same as those same antennas by themselves) does not generate reliable estimates of SEFD.

30|$|There are {{multiple}} different sources of realistic non-white external noise. One example is <b>galactic</b> radiation <b>noise.</b> The {{power spectral density}} (PSD) of such noise is proportional to \(\frac 1 {f^{ 2.7 }}\) [15], where f denotes the frequency, which makes it non-white. Another example is man-made noise [16]. The reason this kind of noise leads to correlation in the received samples under \(\mathcal {H}_{ 0 }\) is twofold. Firstly, it occurs in strong bursts that affect multiple receiver samples, which leads to time correlation. Secondly, when multiple receivers or multiple receive antennas are considered, the received noise is correlated in the case that multiple {{of them are in}} the range of the same man-made impulsive noise. The origin of man-made noise lies in, e.g., unintended radiation from electrical machinery or power transmission lines. Furthermore, nearly every electronic device creates it and thus, impulsive man-made noise is an effect that needs to be taken into account.|$|R

With the demonstrated Pathfinder performance for the disturbance reduction system, and a well studied design for the laser metrology, it is anticipated that the new mission will have a sensitivity {{very close to the}} original LISA design.

40|$|Performance of high {{frequency}} (HF) radio systems {{is dependent on}} the ratio of the wanted signal power at the receiver to the unwanted noise power. The unwanted noise is usually the composite of atmospheric, man-made and <b>galactic</b> radio <b>noise.</b> In some cases, the system s engineer m ay wish to include the presence of an interfering signal along with the noise power when making performance assessments. A modification has been incorporated in two comm only used IONCAP-fam ily of HF sky-wave prediction programs (ICEPAC and VOACAP) which allow the user to specify the system parameters for a potentially interfering transmitter. The signal power probability distribution over the days of the month at a given frequency, hour, month and sunspot number is computed for the wanted and the unwanted signals at a common receiver location.

40|$|The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) {{will explore}} the source-rich milli-Hertz {{band of the}} {{gravitational}} wave spectrum. In contrast to ground based detectors, where typical signals are short-lived and discrete, LISA signals are typically long-lived and over-lapping, thus requiring a global data analysis solution that is very different to the source-by-source analysis that has been developed for ground based gravitational wave astronomy. Across the LISA band, gravitational waves are both signals and noise. The dominant contribution to this so-called confusion noise (better termed unresolved signal noise) is expected to come from short period galactic white dwarf binaries, but all sources, including massive black hole binaries and extreme mass ratio captures will also contribute.
