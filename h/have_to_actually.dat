25|$|Historically, {{a pitcher}} could {{intentionally}} walk a batter by simply announcing his intent {{to do so}} and not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>actually</b> throw any pitches. Beginning in 2008, the pitcher had to actually pitch the required four balls (which were counted against the pitch count). In 2017, the Major and Minor levels of Little League Baseball aligned with a new rule of Major League Baseball and allowed the batter to intentionally walk a batter simply by declaration. The intentional walk adds 4 to the pitcher's pitch count. This change rescinded a former rule in which the team at bat could decline the award of first base and force the pitcher to pitch, such as to further inflate the pitch count to force the removal of the pitcher.|$|E
500|$|Producers {{used the}} Compact Disc's pregap, so a {{listener}} would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>actually</b> manually rewind the first track a full nine minutes to hear two additional hidden tracks, [...] "Time Jesum Transeuntum Et Non Riverentum" [...] and {{a cover of}} The X-Files theme song, both performed by Nick Cave and Dirty Three. This is hinted at in the album's liner booklet, which notes [...] "Nick Cave and the Dirty Three {{would like you to}} know that [...] "0" [...] is also a number". The use of these hidden tracks has been described as [...] "just the sort of surprise one might have suspected from a show that deals in unexplainable mysteries". Not all CD or DVD players will allow the album to be [...] "rewound" [...] back to these tracks as this violates Red Book standards.|$|E
500|$|After the {{positive}} {{response to the}} opening sequence by Banksy, creator Matt Groening and Jean came to Kricfalusi {{and asked him if}} he could do something similar. Originally, they only wanted him to do the storyboards and then let their regular crew animate it, but Kricfalusi insisted on doing the animation himself, explaining that [...] "If we had done it that way, no one would even have known that I {{had anything to do with}} it because it would have ended up on model and all pose to pose". [...] On The Simpsons, the animators draw key poses and then let tweeners interpolate between those poses. The interpolation however, is a straight a to b animation. That way the animation ends up having the characters just going from pose to pose. Kricfalusi explains that on The Simpsons he [...] "wanted to try moving the characters in crazy fun ways, not just looking funny each time they come to a stop", and further elaborated [...] "that the way things happened was even more important than what was happening in my work. You can’t write visual performance. You <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>actually</b> draw it." ...|$|E

500|$|His {{first year}} of Q-ship service was {{frustrating}} for Stuart and the [...] crew. Although, prior to his attachment to the ship, Farnborough had succeeded in sinking an enemy submarine (the U-68 in March 1916), {{there had been no}} successes since. In February 1917, Campbell decided that in order to properly invite an attack, the Farnborough would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>actually</b> be torpedoed before combat and then engage the submarine as she closed to finish the job with shellfire. [...] On 17 February this theory was proven correct off Southern Ireland when the lone Farnborough was struck by a torpedo fired at extreme range. Campbell intentionally failed to evade the missile and the ship took the blow in the hold, causing some minor injuries to the crew but serious damage to the ship. The crew were well rehearsed and the [...] "panic party" [...] took to their boats with a great show of alarm and disorder while the gun crews manned positions on their hidden weapons. When four lifeboats had been released and the ship had settled in the water and was clearly sinking, the submarine U-83 pulled up just ten yards (9m) from the wreck. A hail of shot was then unleashed by the Farnborough's remaining crew from their six-pounder gun and several machine guns into the stationary submarine. The very first shot decapitated the German captain Bruno Hoppe and the U-boat was rapidly reduced to a battered wreck. Eight German sailors escaped the submarine before it sank but only two could be pulled from the water, one of whom subsequently died from his wounds.|$|E
2500|$|Minor Threat's song [...] "Guilty of Being White" [...] {{led to some}} {{accusations of}} racism, but MacKaye has {{strongly}} denied such intentions and said that some listeners misinterpreted his words. He claims that his experiences attending Wilson High School, whose student population was 70 percent black, inspired the song. There, many students bullied MacKaye and his friends. Thrash metal band Slayer later covered the song, with the last iteration of the lyric [...] "Guilty of being white" [...] changed to [...] "Guilty of being right." [...] In an interview, MacKaye stated that he was offended that some perceived racist overtones in the lyrics, saying, [...] "To me, {{at the time and}} now, it seemed clear it's an anti-racist song. Of course, it didn't occur to me at the time I wrote it that anybody outside of my twenty or thirty friends who I was singing to would ever <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>actually</b> ponder the lyrics or even consider them." ...|$|E
