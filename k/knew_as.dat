5|$|The {{emotional}} {{story is}} inspired by Maxim Gorky's sentimental novel Mother, which is considered the first socialist realist novel, and a story that Han was familiar with. Myers traces the story's foundation back to anti-Christian stories in rural colonial Korea {{as well as in}} fascist Japan. The metaphor of the villain as a beast, too, is more readily associated with wartime Japanese propaganda than socialist realism. It had, however, featured in the works of early Soviet writers as whose work Han <b>knew,</b> <b>as</b> well as in textual genres not bound by the official socialist realist dogma, such as journalism.|$|E

5|$|Ilya Ulyanov {{died of a}} brain {{haemorrhage}} in January 1886, when Lenin was 16. Subsequently, Lenin's behaviour became erratic and confrontational, and he soon renounced {{his belief}} in God. At the time, Lenin's elder brother Alexander—whom he affectionately <b>knew</b> <b>as</b> Sasha—was studying at Saint Petersburg University. Involved in political agitation against the absolute monarchy of the reactionary Tsar Alexander III, Sasha studied the writings of banned leftists and organised anti-government protests. He joined a revolutionary cell bent on assassinating the Tsar and was selected to construct a bomb. Before the attack could take place the conspirators were arrested and tried, and in May, Sasha was executed by hanging. Despite the emotional trauma of his father's and brother's deaths, Lenin continued studying, graduated with a gold medal for exceptional performance, and decided to study law at Kazan University.|$|E

5|$|Several {{witnesses}} {{testified against}} him. The widow Eliza Sharp {{testified that the}} voice of the killer was distinct. A test was devised allowing Mrs. Sharp to hear Beauchamp's voice; she immediately identified it as that of the killer.

Patrick Henry Darby, an Old Court partisan, claimed that in 1824, he had a chance encounter with the man he now <b>knew</b> <b>as</b> Beauchamp. Darby said the man – a stranger to him at the time – had asked for Darby's help in prosecuting an unspecified claim against Sharp. The man then identified himself as the husband of Anna Cooke and said he intended to kill Sharp.

5|$|The tammar wallaby {{was seen}} in the Houtman Abrolhos off Western Australia by {{survivors}} of the 1628 Batavia shipwreck, and recorded by François Pelsaert in his 1629 Ongeluckige Voyagie. It was first described in 1817 by the French naturalist Anselme Gaëtan Desmarest, who gave it the name eugenii based on where it was found; an island he <b>knew</b> <b>as</b> Ile Eugene in the Nuyts Archipelago off South Australia which is now known as St Peter Island. The island's French name was given in honour of Eugene Hamelin, commander of the ship Naturaliste; whose name is now the specific name of the tammar. The common name of the animal is derived from the thickets of the shrub locally known as tamma (Allocasuarina campestris) that sheltered it in Western Australia. The tammar is classified together with the kangaroos, wallaroos and several species of wallaby in the genus Macropus, and in the subgenus Notamacropus with the other wallabies, all of which have a facial stripe.|$|E
