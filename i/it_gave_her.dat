25|$|After {{the death}} of her father, Durham took on the {{responsibilities}} of caring for her sick mother for several years. It proved an exhausting experience; when she was 37, her doctor recommended that she should undertake a foreign vacation to recuperate. She took a trip by sea down the coast of Dalmatia, travelling from Trieste to Kotor and then overland to Cetinje, the capital of Montenegro. <b>It</b> <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> a taste for southern Balkan life that she was to retain {{for the rest of her}} life.|$|E
25|$|Anthony {{embarked}} on her career of social reform with energy and determination. Schooling herself in reform issues, {{she found herself}} drawn to the more radical ideas of people like William Lloyd Garrison, George Thompson and Elizabeth Cady Stanton. Soon she was wearing the controversial Bloomer dress, consisting of pantaloons worn under a knee-length dress. Although it was more sensible than the traditional heavy dresses that dragged the ground, she reluctantly quit wearing it after a year because <b>it</b> <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> opponents the opportunity to focus on her apparel rather than her ideas.|$|E

25|$|The lands ravaged and {{depopulated}} by {{the civil}} war were filled up by arriving Turks who colonised the land through a mixture of conquest and trade. The result was that Byzantium's power was undermined beyond all recovery — {{two hundred years ago}} Byzantium could rely on the people living in the lands of Anatolia, Greece, Macedonia and several large islands like Cyprus and Crete. Now the population under its control was limited to the few remaining cities in Byzantine possession, namely Thessalonica and Constantinople and the surrounding countryside, and the Despotate of the Morea. The immigration of Turks would be decisive in the survival of the Empire as <b>it</b> <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> most dire enemy, the Ottomans, a new power base, not in Asia but now in Europe.|$|E
25|$|In August 1986, Binoche began filming Philip Kaufman's {{adaptation}} of Milan Kundera's novel The Unbearable Lightness of Being, portraying {{the young and}} innocent Tereza. Released in 1988, this was Binoche's first English language role and was a worldwide success with critics and audiences alike Set against the USSR's invasion of Prague in 1968, the film {{tells the story of}} the relationships a Czech surgeon, Tomas (Daniel Day-Lewis), has with his wife Tereza and his lover Sabina (Lena Olin). Binoche has stated that at the time her English was very limited and that she relied on a French translation to fully grasp her role. After this success, Binoche decided to return to France rather than pursue an international career. In 1988, she filmed the lead in Pierre Pradinas's Un tour de manège, a little-seen French film opposite François Cluzet. She has stated that her attraction to this film was that <b>it</b> <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> the opportunity to work with close friends and family. Pradinas is the husband of her sister Marion Stalens who was set photographer on the film and appeared in a cameo role. In the summer of 1988, Binoche returned to the stage in an acclaimed production of Anton Chekhov's The Seagull directed by Russian director Andrei Konchalovsky at Théâtre De L'odéon in Paris.|$|E
500|$|Bethune was {{described}} as [...] "ebony" [...] in complexion. She carried a cane, not for support but for effect. She said <b>it</b> <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> [...] "swank". She was a teetotaler and preached temperance for African Americans, taking opportunities to chastise drunken blacks she encountered in public. Bethune said more than once that {{the school and the}} students in Daytona were her first family, and that her son and extended family came second. Her students often referred to her as [...] "Mama Bethune." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{following}} year, Dunst {{starred in}} the comedy film Get Over It (2001). She later explained {{that one of the}} reasons for accepting the role was that <b>it</b> <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> the opportunity to sing. Also in 2001, she {{starred in the}} historical drama The Cat's Meow, directed by Peter Bogdanovich, as the American actress Marion Davies. Derek Elley of Variety described the film as [...] "playful and sporty", saying that this was Dunst's best performance to date: [...] "Believable as both a spoiled ingenue and a lover to two very different men, Dunst endows a potentially lightweight character with considerable depth and sympathy." ...|$|E
500|$|Kylie {{was created}} as the [...] "tearaway" [...] {{half-sister}} of established character Becky McDonald (Katherine Kelly). Actress Paula Lane {{was cast in}} the role and immediately received praise from executive producer Phil Collinson who described her as [...] "brilliant". Lane has stated she draws inspiration from her own past, as an angle to portray Kylie. Lane's first scenes aired on 26August2010. Lane later signed a new contract with the serial, which was later extended and meant Kylie would stay into July2012. Lane was delighted because <b>it</b> <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> the chance to [...] "go full throttle with the character." ...|$|E
500|$|Woodburne {{has said}} she never gets bored of playing Susan as she changes all the time. She added [...] "One of the upsides of this job {{is that in a}} week you might be doing {{absolute}} slapstick comedy, you might be doing high drama/tragedy and in between maybe some nice subtle interesting stuff as well, the character keeps changing and evolving depending on who she is interacting with". Woodburne has said that her favourite storyline has been the Susan, Karl and Izzy love triangle. As Susan is normally a good person, <b>it</b> <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> a chance to have a character (Izzy) that she could hate. Woodburne added [...] "It was good to play those much meaner, darker, angrier, cruel moments than always to be the kind character. It was good to see those dents in her armour I think".|$|E

5000|$|The name [...] "Fabyc" [...] is {{an acronym}} meaning [...] "Family By Choice", {{and she has}} used this name since she was nineteen, as <b>it</b> <b>gives</b> <b>her</b> the freedom to make her work without {{worrying}} about it reflecting on her family.|$|R
500|$|Matt Collar of AllMusic awarded it {{a rating}} of {{three and a half}} stars out of five, characterising it as a [...] "pantomime that artists have been trying to pull off ever since Madonna sang about a sexual {{experience}} so revelatory <b>it</b> <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> back her virginity". He also noted that Kills' personality, although similar to that of Pink and Lady Gaga, was [...] "enough [...] to keep your attention". Writing in Idolator, Sam Lansky highlighted Bhasker's production, which he credited with making the album cohesive. Lansky opined that Kills had evolved as a songwriter and given legitimacy and [...] "richness" [...] to Troubles songs. So So Gay Magazine praised Trouble as an evolution from her previous album Perfectionist, and stated that Kills [...] "remains largely unknown and underrated; astonishing considering the quality of her two albums. She’s definitely some sort of anti-princess of pop." ...|$|E
500|$|Kreuk {{enjoyed the}} fourth season because <b>it</b> <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> {{the chance to}} stretch her acting {{abilities}} with Lana's storyline involving the spirit of Countess Margaret Isobel Thoreaux. According to the actress, [...] "That {{was a lot of}} fun; I thought it was funny as well [...] It really was wonderful to be able to stretch and play this driven woman who has a goal and is going to reach it, and in the meantime she's going to be sexy doing it. That {{was a lot of fun}} for me because the show [...] isn't realistic so, as actors, we get to play with different types of things." [...] Kreuk says her strangest moment on the show was playing a vampire in season five's [...] "Thirst", an experience she remembers as [...] "uncomfortable" [...] due to the fake blood they covered her in. Kreuk left the series at the end of the seventh season, but appeared in five episodes in season eight as a guest star.|$|E
500|$|... "Hold On to Sixteen" [...] {{received}} a mixed reception from reviewers, though {{the music was}} more favorably received. Robert Canning of IGN called it [...] "very underwhelming" [...] and gave it an [...] "okay" [...] rating of 6.5 out of 10; he noted that competition episodes {{such as this one}} spend more time on performance, and deemed the non-performance segments [...] "blase". Rolling Stone Erica Futterman characterized [...] "the moral of this week's story: embrace your youth" [...] as [...] "overkill", but noted that once the competition began, the episode [...] "succeeded in spite of itself". Amy Reiter of The Los Angeles Times called it a [...] "feel-good episode" [...] that came as a [...] "huge relief" [...] after the show [...] "had lost its moral footing these last few weeks", and AOLTV Crystal Bell said <b>it</b> <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> [...] "some hope {{for the rest of the}} season". Rae Votta of Billboard summarized the episode this way: [...] "Overall, it was a Glee that felt like the plots were dealt with as fast as humanly possible to cram in as much singing and dancing as we can." ...|$|E

500|$|Louis Virtel, from TheBacklot.com, placed [...] "This Used to Be My Playground" [...] {{at number}} 52 of his list [...] "The 100 Greatest Madonna Songs". He wrote; [...] "The theme to Madonna’s best movie [...] is nostalgic and sweet, and <b>it</b> <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> a major hit that {{utilized}} the lachrymose qualities in her voice." [...] Mary Ann A. Bautist, from the Philippine Daily Inquirer, called {{it one of}} the singer's [...] "alternative tunes [...] that can be as romantic and touching as any ballad". Liz Smith, from The Toledo Blade, called it an [...] "exquisite ballad". On his review of the compilation Barcelona Gold, The Daily Gazettes Bill Rice wrote: [...] "Madonna's plaintive single 'This Used to Be My Playground', is one medal winner". A negative review came from Stylus Magazines Alfred Soto, who dismissed the song as a [...] "slushy rewrite of Like a Prayers 'Promise to Try'". The song was nominated for a Golden Globe award for Best Original Song, but lost to [...] "A Whole New World" [...] from Aladdin. It won two accolades at the ASCAP Awards, in the categories of Most Performed Songs from Motion Pictures and Most Performed Pop Song.|$|E
500|$|In 1992, Madonna founded her own {{multi-media}} entertainment company, Maverick, {{consisting of}} a record company (Maverick Records), a film production company (Maverick Films), and associated music publishing, television broadcasting, book publishing and merchandising divisions. The deal was {{a joint venture with}} Time Warner and paid Madonna an advance of $60million. <b>It</b> <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> 20% royalties from the music proceedings, one of the highest rates in the industry, equaled at that time only by Michael Jackson's royalty rate established a year earlier with Sony. Madonna said that she envisioned the company as an [...] "artistic think tank" [...] and likened it to a cross between the Bauhaus, the innovative German arts institute formed in Weimar in 1919, and Andy Warhol's New York-based Factory of artists and assistants. She stated: [...] "It started as a desire to have more control. There's a group of writers, photographers, directors and editors that I've met along the way in my career who I want to take with me everywhere I go. I want to incorporate them into my little factory of ideas. I also come in contact with a lot of young talent that I feel entrepreneurial about." [...] The first two projects from the venture were her fifth studio album, Erotica, and a coffee table book of photographs featuring Madonna, entitled Sex.|$|E
500|$|Feeling {{like her}} {{character}} was wasting her college degree O'Toole suggested to the producers that Martha {{go to work}} for Lex during the second season. The producers agreed, but altered the concept so that Martha went to work for Lionel, and that she would use this new position to spy on Lionel and find out what he knows about Clark. Disappointed when the storyline ended quickly into the second season, O'Toole hoped that the secret her character was holding in [...] "Ryan" [...] was that Martha was going to run for Mayor. In O'Toole's opinion, Martha needs some form of outlet for intelligence. To the chagrin of O'Toole, Martha's next storyline—the expectation of a new child—tied the character to the farm in a way the actress did not agree with. O'Toole wanted to perform as if the pregnancy was fake—something mentally created by Clark's ship—but the producers insisted that she wear the pregnancy pads to indicate that she was indeed pregnant. Ultimately, that storyline ended with Martha losing the baby to a miscarriage. Before season four began, O'Toole suggested again to the producers that Martha {{go to work for}} Lex. O'Toole had enjoyed the moments in the show when she was working for Lionel, because <b>it</b> <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> character something more to do, and she wanted to do that again for season four. The producers took her suggestion and had Martha take a job at the Talon, which was owned by Lex, and which O'Toole felt allowed Martha to interact more with the other characters in Clark's life.|$|E

500|$|In 1992, Madonna {{starred in}} A League of Their Own as Mae Mordabito, a {{baseball}} player on an all-women's team. It reached {{number one on the}} box-office and became the tenth highest-grossing film {{of the year in the}} U.S. She recorded the film's theme song, [...] "This Used to Be My Playground", which became her tenth Hot 100 number-one hit, the most by any female artist at the time. The same year, she founded her own entertainment company, Maverick, consisting of a record company (Maverick Records), a film production company (Maverick Films), and associated music publishing, television broadcasting, book publishing and merchandising divisions. The deal was a joint venture with Time Warner and paid Madonna an advance of $60 million. <b>It</b> <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> 20% royalties from the music proceedings, the highest rate in the industry at the time, equaled only by Michael Jackson's royalty rate established a year earlier with Sony.

The book received strong negative reaction from the media and the general public, but sold 1.5 million copies at $50 each in a matter of days. The backlash overshadowed Madonna's fifth studio album, Erotica, which was released at the same time. Despite positive reviews, it became her first studio album since her debut album not to score any chart-topper in the U.S. The album entered the Billboard 200 at number two and yielded the Hot 100 top-ten hits [...] "Erotica" [...] and [...] "Deeper and Deeper".|$|E

She said that <b>it</b> <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> [...] "a sense of family and tradition" [...] and taught her about [...] "being conscientious about people's feelings, being polite, being responsible and never taking for granted {{what you have in}} your life." [...] At the age of seven, Witherspoon was selected as a model for a florist's television advertisements, which motivated her to take acting lessons.

[...] Polydor Records originally intended to release it as a single for [...] (2006) the same year, but was deemed [...] "too downbeat, when a greatest hits single {{needs to be a}} celebration." [...] Nicola Roberts, Cheryl Cole, Sarah Harding and Kimberley Walsh recorded vocals for the song in London, England, while Nadine Coyle recorded her vocals in Los Angeles. Cole deemed the song her favourite from Tangled Up, adding that <b>it</b> <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> [...] "goosebumps". An early version of [...] "Call the Shots" [...] leaked online in September 2007. On 16 November 2007, Tangled Up was released, with [...] "Call the Shots" [...] being released for digital download on 26 November 2007, through Polydor Records, while it was also made available on two different CD single formats the same day.
