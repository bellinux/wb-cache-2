50|$|The Highland Railway {{opposed the}} Bill {{as it was}} about to extend from Stromeferry to Kyle of Lochalsh. The West Highland Railway (Mallaig Extension) Act passed on 31 July 1894, but the <b>guarantee</b> <b>bill</b> was thrown out; many MPs objected to a free gift to a railway company. However the scheme, aimed at {{developing}} a backward area of the country, had Government support and the <b>Guarantee</b> <b>Bill</b> was submitted to Parliament again in the 1895 session and this time it passed, on 7 May 1895. The Treasury guaranteed the shareholders 3% on £260,000 of West Highland Railway (Mallaig Extension) capital and to make a grant of £30,000 towards the £45,000 cost of the pier at Mallaig; rates were also to be held to the level of unimproved land.|$|R

Programmes like Food for work and National Rural Employment Programme have attempted to use the unemployed to generate productive assets and build rural infrastructure. In August 2005, the Indian parliament passed the Rural Employment <b>Guarantee</b> <b>Bill,</b> the largest programme of this type, in terms of cost and coverage, which promises 100 days of minimum wage employment to every rural household in 200 of India's 600 districts.

Financial arrangements seemed to be in place when the Mallaig Extension Bill was passed on 31 July 1894, but the promised Government <b>Guarantee</b> <b>Bill</b> required for the subsidy was not put forward, and for the time being nothing was done. On 7 May 1895 the guarantee was finally forthcoming: a 3% guarantee on £260,000 of capital with a grant of £30,000 to improve the harbour at Mallaig and make it suitable as a fishing harbour. The line opened on 1 April 1901.|$|R

25|$|During {{its first}} term in office, the UPA {{government}} passed several social reform bills. These included an employment <b>guarantee</b> <b>bill,</b> the Right to Information Act, and {{a right to}} education act. The NAC, {{as well as the}} Left Front that supported the government from the outside, were widely seen as being the driving force behind such legislation. The Left Front withdrew its support of the government over disagreements about the U.S.–India Civil Nuclear Agreement. Despite the effective loss of 62 seats in parliament, the government survived the trust vote that followed. In the Lok Sabha elections held soon after, the Congress won 207 seats, the highest tally of any party since 1991. The UPA as a whole won 262, enabling it to form the government for the second time. The social welfare policies of the first UPA government, and the perceived divisiveness of the BJP, are broadly credited for the victory.|$|R
