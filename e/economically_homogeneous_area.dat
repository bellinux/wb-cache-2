The rock mass of national underground oil storage in Huang Island is analyzed in this study with focus on the division of a statistically <b>homogeneous</b> <b>area.</b> Trace length is a basic element in determining crack features. The rock mass of different track lengths differs widely in terms of mechanics and deformation characteristics. This study includes trace length information in the division of a statistically <b>homogeneous</b> <b>area</b> and considers the variances and mean values of crack samples in different regions separately by F-test and T-test to determine if the samples have statistically similar trace length information. Numerous crack samples are required to divide a statistically <b>homogeneous</b> <b>area.</b> This study adopts the Watson test to divide a statistically <b>homogeneous</b> <b>area</b> and considers data on crack occurrence to achieve the purpose of obtaining fewer samples for occurrence comparison.

40|$|In this paper, we use {{census tract}} data to analyse changes in {{neighbourhood}} income inequality and residential economic segregation {{in the eight}} largest Canadian cities during the 1980 - 95 period. Is the income gap between richer and poorer neighbourhoods rising? Are high and low-income families increasingly clustered in <b>economically</b> <b>homogeneous</b> neighbourhoods? The main results are an elaboration of the spatial implications of the well documented {{changes that have occurred}} in family income and earnings inequality since 1980. We find that between neighbourhood family income (post-transfer/pre-tax) inequality rose in all cities driven by a substantial rise in neighbourhood (employment) earnings inequality. Real average earnings fell, sometimes dramatically, in low-income neighbourhoods in virtually all cities while rising moderately in higher income neighbourhoods. Strikingly, social transfers, which were the main factor stabilizing national level income inequality in the face of rising earnings inequality, had only a modest impact on changes in neighbourhood inequality. Changes in the neighbourhood distribution of earnings signal significant change in the social and economic character of many neighbourhoods. Employment was increasingly concentrated in higher income communities and unemployment in lower income neighbourhoods. Finally, we ask whether neighbourhood inequality rose primarily as a result of rising family income inequality in the city as a whole or because families were increasingly sorting themselves into "like" neighbourhoods so that neighbourhoods were becoming more <b>economically</b> <b>homogeneous</b> (economic "segregation"). We find that economic spatial segregation increased in all cities and was the major factor behind rising neighbourhood inequality in four of the eight cities. A general rise in urban family income inequality was the main factor in the remaining four cities.
