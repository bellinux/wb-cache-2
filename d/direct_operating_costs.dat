25|$|The Airbus Helicopters H160 takes {{advantage}} of several advanced manufacturing technologies and materials {{in order to produce}} a lighter, more efficient design. One weight-saving measure was the replacement of conventional hydraulic landing gear and brakes with electrical counterparts, the first helicopter in the world to do so; according to Airbus the elimination of hydraulic components makes the rotorcraft both lighter and safer. In 2015, Airbus claimed that the all-composite H160 would deliver the same basic performance as the rival AgustaWestland AW139 while being a ton lighter, having a lower fuel consumption and offering 15–20% lower <b>direct</b> <b>operating</b> <b>costs.</b> The composite fuselage also provided for greater design freedom of the rotorcraft's external styling.

2500|$|The Britten-Norman BN-2 Islander is a high-wing {{cantilever}} monoplane with {{a rectangular}} fuselage and two wing-mounted engines; early aircraft were {{equipped with a}} pair of piston engines while later production models may be alternatively fitted with turboprop engines in their place. The rectangular cross section fuselage, which is furnished with a conventional tail unit and fixed tricycle landing gear, typically accommodates a single pilot and up to nine passengers in a commuter configuration, each row being accessed by its own door; the cabin can be rapidly reconfigured, allowing for a single aircraft to undertake a diverse range of tasks within a minimal period of time.

5000|$|In 1957, the United States Air Force (USAF) {{selected}} the Cessna 310 for {{service as a}} light utility aircraft for transport and administrative support.

In October 1950, the railroad had computed the <b>direct</b> <b>operating</b> <b>costs</b> for the Zephyrette RDCs at 71 cents per train-mile, almost half the cost incurred by its conventional predecessor, the Royal Gorge.

They also provided numerous advantages over conventional consists, {{especially in terms of}} their ability to accelerate quickly and maintain high sustained speeds, which allowed for faster service of the route's conditional stops than had previously been possible. While the Zephyrettes had initially been profitable for the Western Pacific, they did not remain so, and the service was ended on October 2, 1960.|$|E
50|$|CityFlyer and its {{predecessor}} Connectair had a {{proven track record}} of operating a network of regional domestic and European scheduled services from Gatwick profitably. This was {{in stark contrast to}} BA's mainline short haul operation at Gatwick, which had racked up huge losses ever since BA had established a major presence at Gatwick {{as a result of the}} British Caledonian and Dan-Air takeovers. The losses BA's mainline short haul services generated at Gatwick were at the heart of the unsatisfactory financial performance of the entire Gatwick operation. After the failed attempt to use the acquisition of Dan-Air, which was on the verge of bankruptcy at the end of October 1992, to form a new low-cost, short haul unit within BA's mainline short haul operation at Gatwick, franchising seemed to offer the best solution for providing the level of feeder services BA needed to protect its long-haul loads and profits at Gatwick, without re-creating the complex organisation and fleet mix, and without duplicating the costly overheads of the BA mainline short haul operation at Heathrow, which did not suit the revenue environment at Gatwick. Apart from the additional transfer traffic this generated for BA's long haul services at Gatwick, the main benefit of this arrangement for BA was that CityFlyer was to remain completely independent of the BA mainline operation. The feeder services CityFlyer provided for BA at Gatwick under the franchise agreement did not impact the <b>direct</b> <b>operating</b> <b>costs</b> of BA's mainline operation. CityFlyer also had very low costs as a result of a flat organisational structure and a simple fleet. This suited Gatwick's revenue environment and was the main reason BA decided to make the franchise agreement with CityFlyer Express a central plank of its strategy to achieve sustained, overall profitability at Gatwick.|$|E

40|$|Composite {{structures}} {{can lower}} {{the weight of}} an airliner significantly. The increased production cost, however, requires the application of cost-effective design strategies in which cost, weight and the desired laminate quality are taken into account. This paper proposes an optimization framework for composite aircraft structures that minimizes the <b>direct</b> <b>operating</b> <b>cost</b> on a part level. In addition to previous models, a non-destructive testing model is implemented that calculates design allowables of a laminate based on the ultrasonic scan parameters. In a case study, {{the effect of the}} laminate quality on the <b>direct</b> <b>operating</b> <b>cost</b> is discussed. It is investigated how the flaw size and therefore the scan pitch of a composite laminate can influence the optimal solution in terms of cost and weight; thus, the manufacturing cost, the non-destructive testing cost and the weight of a component can be balanced by optimizing the laminate quality in an early design phase.
