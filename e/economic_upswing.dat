Wide-scale development has been made possible by the unhindered movement of goods into Gaza through the Kerem Shalom Crossing and tunnels between the Gaza Strip and Egypt. The current rate of trucks entering Gaza through Kerem Shalom is 250 trucks per day. The increase in building activity has led to a shortage of construction workers. To make up for the deficit, young people are being sent to learn the trade in Turkey.|$|E

40|$|Does {{monetary}} policy help smooth or amplify economic cycles? In most advanced mar-kets {{monetary policy}} helps smooth cycles. However, for emerging markets, procycli-cal monetary {{policy has been}} a problem, with macroeconomic policies amplifying <b>economic</b> <b>upswings</b> and deepening downturns. This article summarizes research in this area, focusing on monetary policy. Key findings in the research include: (i) Emerging markets have adopted increasingly countercyclical monetary policy over time, although large differences remain among emerging markets and policies became more procyclical during the recent crisis, and (ii) inflation targeting and better insti-tutions have been key factors behind the move to countercyclicality. In our research we confirm these findings using a comprehensive dataset and we also find that more countercyclical policy is associated with far less volatile output...|$|R

In contrast, composition effects dampen the cyclicality of the unemployment inflow rate considerably. We further observe that the initially positive contribution of composition effects to a higher unemployment outflow rate turns negative {{over the course of the}} recession. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. According to many economists, {{including}} those of the European Commission, the serious crisis which befell the Stability and Growth Pact {{has its roots in the}} incorrect behaviour of Member States which dissipate resources during <b>economic</b> <b>upswings,</b> thus foregoing an improvement in the budgetary balance to cushion the effects of an eventual downturn. This paper discusses an alternative view which attributes the crisis to the persistently low growth in the European Union. This leads to a proposal for reform of the Pact based on the idea that if the GDP growth of a Member State is very low, the high-quality growth-inducing government expenditure on infra-structure, research and technological innovation would not be con-sidered for the purposes of computing its fiscal deficit. The objectives of this proposal are to make the escape clause of the Pact useable in practice and to avoid forcing member states to give up high quality-spending, which is important for growth and for long-term fiscal sustainability, merely to meet the constraints of the Pact...|$|R
40|$|VEver {{since its}} {{inception}} EMU has been subject to controversy. The fiscal policy rules embedded in the Treaty on European Union, and clarified in the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP), {{are probably the most}} contentious. The SGP is being accused of being too rigid and of forcing pro-cyclicality in fiscal policy. We test the impact of the SGP rules on the cyclical properties of fiscal policy for a panel of 12 European countries. We conclude that contrary to what might have been expected the euro fiscal rules have reinforced the counter-cyclicality of fiscal policy. However, the results also show that the SGP is not being applied symmetrically over the cycle, leading to insufficient fiscal consolidation during <b>economic</b> <b>upswings.</b> This explains the recent difficulties of Portugal, Germany and France in complying with SGP requirements. Based on these conclusions we argue for the creation of independent national technical committees that would define an appropriate deficit target on an annual basis.

40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} map out the {{possible}} paths of effective management of public action – including the possibility of deficit-financed action – designed, firstly, to short-term problems, with an immediate impact against economic depression, and secondly, to the medium-long-term perspective, aiming {{to assure that the}} extent and role of policies enacted is sustainable over time. This analytical approach underscores the theoretical validity of an active role of fiscal policy in helping to overcome severe recessions, provided that this policy is underpinned by appropriate institutional rules and a judicious application of the method of functional finance. This approach implies that the economic evaluation of deficit financed projects and careful selection of meritorious projects should be oriented towards goals of collective interest. Also, such projects should always pursue the goal of increasing the productivity of the economic system, with a view to achieving sustainable growth and, over time, allowing the debt to be suitably refinanced, managed and reduced by means of budget surpluses obtained during <b>economic</b> <b>upswings...</b>|$|R

An intercept-shift model is used {{to determine if the}} diversity/stability relationship exists. The regression model is also used to determine if individual census regions are inherently more stable and whether certain regions are more stable over time. An Adjusted Minimum Requirements index was used to measure diversity while stability was measured with the Regional Economic Instability index.

5000|$|Overall, {{the company}} period {{was known for}} its boom and bust economies. Massive hirings during <b>economic</b> <b>upswings</b> were {{followed}} by massive layoffs. During boom times, skilled and unskilled workers would flood into town, only {{to return to their}} homes after the price of lumber, bananas, or ores dropped leaving ghost towns, and abandoned infrastructure. [...] During the company period, it was common for the Miskito men to leave their communities and families for up to a year at a time, to work in the various industries. [...] They would send back money as replacement for the subsistence goods that they would have traditionally produced. Without their husbands and male family members, the women were increasingly forced to purchase food (especially meat) on the cash market and hire farm hands to clear and tend agricultural plots. This employment dynamic led to the large-scale introduction of the money-based economy, and the replacement of subsistence goods with relatively inexpensive commissary goods. This shift created a dependency on commercial goods and cash earning employment.|$|R

40|$|Alberta is {{currently}} {{in the midst of}} the largest economic growth ever recorded by a Canadian province, with growth rates challenging China’s. This is due to increases in oil exploration and production. With all <b>economic</b> <b>upswings,</b> come challenges, and Alberta {{is currently}} experiencing an urgent labour shortage. The Alberta Government and Alberta’s oil companies have gone global in their search for labour and the number of temporary foreign workers (TFWs) coming to Alberta is vastly increasing.

The objective of the paper is to explore the interests, perspectives, and actions of employers, governments, and unions in regard to Alberta’s TFWP. This will be analyzed in a context of global TFWPs and international labour migration.

Virtu Financial, as of November 2015, is the only publicly traded high frequency trading firm, offering a opportunity to study the market behavior of a new kind of stock.
