5|$|The {{festival is}} powered by Aggreko who provide over 27 megawatts of power to the site with 250 bio-diesel generators, run on 60,000 litres of waste {{vegetable}} oil (WVO) fuel. The power generated is enough to power the city of Bath and the Pyramid Stage {{is powered by}} 4 generators itself. There is 24km of <b>festoon</b> lighting around the site, also installed by Aggreko. This is run with time clocks so the lights are only on when they are needed, contributing to the festival's green requirements.|$|E
25|$|Within the verandah, four bays are {{organized}} into an ABA rhythm of two paired, central bays flanked by singular bays at the extremes. Each bay is intricately {{articulated in the}} same manner: a circular arch defined by an ornate hood mould with floral and <b>festoon</b> plaster ornament above. Each bay contains wooden, louvered double-doors with ornate leaded glass panels and a stained-glass fanlight.|$|E
25|$|The facade is {{organized}} into three similar bays, each one {{consisting of a}} narrow, arched doorway with wooden panel double-doors, stained-glass lights and tiffany-style stained-glass fanlights. The central entrance doors contain wrought-iron panels in curved Art Nouveau lines. Each opening is articulated with intricate, decorative plaster surrounds and flaked with plaster <b>festoon</b> mouldings. In addition, the central entry is crowned with a plaster cartouche displaying the initials of the first owners, PF (Providencia Ubides and Federico Font).|$|E

25|$|The north {{front is}} the {{principal}} façade of the White House and consists of three floors and eleven bays. The ground floor is hidden by a raised carriage ramp and parapet, thus the façade appears to be of two floors. The central three bays are behind a prostyle portico (this was a later addition to the house, built circa 1830) serving, thanks to the carriage ramp, as a porte cochere. The windows of the four bays flanking the portico, at first-floor level, have alternating pointed and segmented pediments, while at second-floor level the pediments are flat. The principal entrance {{at the center of}} the portico is surmounted by a lunette fanlight. Above the entrance is a sculpted floral <b>festoon.</b> The roofline is hidden by a balustraded parapet.|$|E
25|$|The {{excursions}} sometimes {{evolved into}} rowdy gatherings and legislation was passed to prevent this. A commission established in 1805 issued instructions which prohibited {{the consumption of}} food or drink as well as music or {{any other kind of}} cheerful behaviour in the cemetery. The gravediggers, who lived on the premises, were to enforce these restrictions but they seem to have taken their duties lightly. Legislation from 1813 prohibited them to sell alcohol to visitors to the cemetery. Despite all these efforts, the desired peace and quiet was a long time in coming. For particularly grand funerals, crowds of spectators would gather, and people would <b>festoon</b> the cemetery walls to get a better view. To reduce numbers of visitors, there was talk of introducing admission fees, but this was never carried out.|$|E
25|$|In 1967, {{notes were}} {{introduced}} in denominations of $1, $2, $5, $10, $20 and $100, with all except the $5 replacing their pound predecessors. The original series of dollar notes featured on the obverse a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II wearing Queen Alexandra's Kokoshnik tiara, King George's VI <b>festoon</b> necklace, and Queen Mary's floret earrings, while the reverse featured native birds and plants. The notes were changed slightly in 1981 due to a change of printer (from De La Rue to Bradbury, Wilkinson & Co.) - the most noticeable difference being the portrait based upon a photograph by Peter Grugeon, in which Queen Elizabeth II is wearing Grand Duchess Vladimir's tiara and Queen Victoria's golden jubilee necklace. The $50 note was added in 1983 to fill the long gap between the $20 and the $100 notes. $1 and $2 notes were discontinued in 1991 after being replaced with coins.|$|E

40|$|Background Malar mounds may be accentuated by chronic lid edema, {{with the}} {{development}} from malar edema to malar mounds and finally to malar <b>festoons.</b> Because standard techniques do not seem effective and not specifically proposed {{for the treatment of}} malar <b>festoons,</b> subperiosteal vertical upper-midface lift associated with lower blepharoplasty overcomes these shortcomings. Methods Twelve patients (3 males and 9 females, age = 47 ± 6 years) underwent video-assisted endoscopic subperiosteal vertical upper-midface lift (SUM-lift) in conjunction with a lower blepharoplasty between 2006 and 2007 for treatment of malar <b>festoons.</b> This includes simultaneous lower blepharoplasties and video-assisted transtemporal subperiosteal and sub-SMAS tissue release. Results All patients healed uneventfully without any major postoperative problems. The surgical outcome was evaluated according to the analysis of photographs obtained before and after surgery and the analysis of preand postoperative measurements. The technique we used (SUM-lift) achieved a significant rejuvenation of the midface and the malar <b>festoons.</b> Conclusion Subperiosteal vertical midface lift resuspends and redrapes the facial network that originates {{at the level of the}} orbital rim. It seems to improve the permeability characteristics of the malar septum in the treatment of malar <b>festoons</b> and malar mounds by freeing the chee...|$|R
