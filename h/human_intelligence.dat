5|$|Early in the film, Hoffman {{explains}} to his superiors that the terrorists' retreat to pre-tech age communication methods renders useless the high specification tools the CIA uses, {{and increases the}} worth of Ferris's <b>human</b> <b>intelligence</b> methods. They avoid mobile telephones and computers, preferring face-to-face communication and encoded written messages. By contrast, the Americans use sophisticated communication (Hoffman and Ferris regularly speak on the phone) and surveillance (high altitude spy planes offer {{a different point of}} view throughout) technology. David Denby of The New Yorker said that this was Scott's suggestion that the CIA has the technology but not the <b>human</b> <b>intelligence</b> to properly fight terrorism in the Middle East.|$|E

40|$|The {{theory of}} {{multiple}} intelligences (MI) developed by Gardner, proposes {{at least nine}} different <b>human</b> <b>intelligences</b> that are distinct and relatively autonomous <b>human</b> <b>intelligences</b> through which people learn. It has been theorized that knowing our MI profile assists us to learn and use this awareness to obtain necessary information and knowledge from a lesson. Characterizing learners' personal MI profiles thus may enhance learning. Language learners' learning process, on the other hand, can be facilitated {{through the use of}} language learning strategies, particularly if the strategies have been explicitly developed by instructors who possess knowledge about individuals' learning styles. This paper presents data from an exploratory study to investigate any possible relationship between ESL students' MI profiles and their use of language learning strategies and hence their proficiency level, as measured by the MUET (Malaysian University English Test) ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{trying to}} discuss a {{framework}} to assist technopreneurs in managing knowledge. Using the concept of <b>Human</b> Virtual <b>Intelligence,</b> {{it is expected that}} the technopreneurs will be able to accelerate their abilities and competency to a desired level. Technopreneurs are mostly busy people with extreme time constraint. They do not have time and luxury to learn in the traditional way, but must go quickly to accommodate the chaotic changes and complex situations in their daily life. In such conditions, they must have a decision support system to help them do their daily strategic tasks. Knowledge Management System plays an important role to capture, share and exploit the knowledge from knowledge agents to the technopreneur’s <b>Human</b> Virtual <b>Intelligence.</b> This paper believes that using the <b>Human</b> Virtual <b>Intelligence</b> framework and Knowledge Management System will significantly help the development of technopreneurs.

5|$|One of Lem's major {{recurring}} themes, beginning {{from his}} very first novel, The Man from Mars, was the impossibility of communication between profoundly alien beings, which may have no common ground with <b>human</b> <b>intelligence,</b> and humans. The best known example is the living planetary ocean in Lem's novel Solaris. Other examples include swarms of mechanical insects (in The Invincible), and strangely ordered societies of more human-like beings in Fiasco and Eden, describing {{the failure of the}} first contact. In His Master's Voice, Lem describes the failure of humanity's intelligence to decipher and truly comprehend an apparent message from space.|$|E
5|$|The fourth {{revision}} of the Stanford–Binet scales (S-B IV) was developed by Thorndike, Hagen, and Sattler and published by Riverside Publishing in 1986.

Gottesman has worked with researchers to analyze hospital records and conduct follow-up interviews of twins where one or both were schizophrenic. He has also researched the effects of genetics and the environment on human violence and variations in <b>human</b> <b>intelligence.</b> Gottesman and co-researcher James Shields introduced the word epigenetics—the control of genes by biochemical signals modified by the environment {{from other parts of the}} genome—to the field of psychiatric genetics.|$|E
5|$|To works, however, {{of which}} the {{excellence}} is not absolute and definite, but gradual and comparative; to works not raised upon principles demonstrative and scientifick, but appealing wholly to observation and experience, no other test can be applied than length of duration and continuance of esteem. What mankind have long possessed they have often examined and compared, and if they persist to value the possession, it is because frequent comparisons have confirmed opinion in its favour. As among the works of nature no man can properly call a river deep or a mountain high, without the knowledge of many mountains and many rivers; so in the productions of genius, nothing can be stiled excellent till it has been compared with other works of the same kind. Demonstration immediately displays its power, and has nothing to hope or fear from the flux of years; but works tentative and experimental must be estimated by their proportion to the general and collective ability of man, as it is discovered in a long succession of endeavours. Of the first building that was raised, it might be with certainty determined that it was round or square, but whether it was spacious or lofty must have been referred to time.

40|$|A new {{approach}} to the conceptualization and assessment of <b>human</b> <b>intelligences</b> is de-scribed. According to Gardner's Theory of Multiple <b>Intelligences,</b> each <b>human</b> being is capable of seven relatively independent forms of information processing, with individuals differing from {{one another in the}} specific profile of intelligences that they exhibit. The range of <b>human</b> <b>intelligences</b> is best assessed through contextually based, "intelligence-fair " instruments. Three research projects growing out of the theory are described. Preliminary data secured from Project Spectrum, an application in early childhood, in-dicate that even 4 - and 5 -year-old children exhibit distinctive profiles of strength and weakness. Moreover, measures of the various intelligences are largely independent and tap abilities other than those measured by standard intelligence tests. Educational Researcher, Vol. 18, No. 8, pp. 4 - 10 D espite swings of the pendulum between theoretical and applied concerns, the concept of intelligence has remained central to the field of psychology.
