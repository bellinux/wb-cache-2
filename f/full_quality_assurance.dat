40|$|This thesis {{comprises}} a {{case study}} of <b>quality</b> <b>assurance</b> policy and practice in the emerging higher education sector of the Maldives. The policy analysis is extended to incorporate a glonacal perspective, allowing analysis of <b>quality</b> <b>assurance</b> policy issues from the global, national and local contexts. In order to illuminate the analysis in the Maldives' primary case study, two secondary less intensive case studies are presented of <b>quality</b> <b>assurance</b> processes from a New Zealand polytechnic and the University of the South Pacific. Documentary evidence and semi-structured interviews from Key Informants form the main evidence base for the study. Data analysis is facilitated using NVivo. The thesis argues that the upsurge in <b>quality</b> <b>assurance</b> in higher education is primarily legitimated within a neoliberal discourse, Urged by transnational organisations such as the World Bank, there is widespread policy convergence in <b>quality</b> <b>assurance.</b> Whilst neoliberalism has had partial effects {{in the case of the}} Maldives, the study reveals that neoliberal ideology and the associated strategies of marketisation, privatisation, human resource development and managerialism have shaped <b>quality</b> <b>assurance</b> policy processes in varying degrees in the three cases. Findings in this study contribute to a <b>fuller</b> understanding of <b>quality</b> <b>assurance</b> policy processes in a small developing nation context: a perspective largely missing from current debates on the subject. The findings confirm that a combination of global, national and institutional factors influenced <b>quality</b> <b>assurance</b> policy processes in the Maldives. From the global context, globalisation and internationalisation of higher education trends affect <b>quality</b> <b>assurance</b> policy. At the national level, the desire for higher quality education found expression in the state's reassertion of its role in protecting public interest in regulating the sector through formal <b>quality</b> <b>assurance.</b> The social demand for international comparability has also lead to a growing trend of transnational <b>quality</b> <b>assurance</b> practices. The creation of the Maldives College of Higher Education was shown to be the principal impetus in <b>quality</b> <b>assurance</b> development. This national college played a lead role in developing a <b>quality</b> <b>assurance</b> model that tends to promote a regulatory compliance to quality. The study argues for a more inclusive model that acknowledges external compliance but also seeks to assure quality of teaching and learning leading to improved student outcomes...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – In {{the light}} of public concern and of strong policy {{emphasis}} on quality and safety in the nursing care of patients in hospital settings, this paper focuses on the factors affecting the adoption of innovative <b>quality</b> <b>assurance</b> technologies. Design/methodology/approach – Two sets of complementary literatures were mined for key themes. Next, new empirical insights were sought. Data gathering was conducted in three phases. The first involved contact with NHS Technology Hubs and other institutions which had insights into leading centres in <b>quality</b> <b>assurance</b> technologies. The second phase {{was a series of}} telephone interviews with lead nurses in those hospitals which were identified in the first phase as comprising the leading centres. The third phase comprised a series of face to face interviews with innovators and adopters of healthcare <b>quality</b> <b>assurance</b> technologies in five hospital trusts. Findings – There were three main sets of findings. First, despite the strong policy push and the templates established at national level, there were significant variations in the nature and robustness of the <b>quality</b> <b>assurance</b> toolkits that were developed, adapted and adopted. Second, in most of the adopting cases there were important obstacles to the full adoption of the toolkits that were designed. Third, the extent and nature of the ambition of the developers varied dramatically – some wished to see their work impacting widely across the health service; others had a number of different reasons for wanting to restrict the impact of their work.

40|$|Purpose – This paper aims to {{identify}} {{what is needed to}} enhance academic <b>quality</b> <b>assurance</b> in a university, with specific efforts to reduce the risks associated with ritualised <b>quality</b> <b>assurance</b> practices. Design/methodology/approach – The aspects to enhance academic <b>quality</b> <b>assurance</b> efforts in managerial universities are identified through a thematic analysis of the literature. Findings – It was found that the very nature of managerialism caused <b>quality</b> <b>assurance</b> effort to lose its meaning and become a ritual for compliance only. Subsequently, five aspects were identified to enhance academic <b>quality</b> <b>assurance</b> in a university: establishing <b>quality</b> <b>assurance</b> in the unique context of the institution; ensuring that the efforts of policy makers are aligned with those of policy users; <b>quality</b> <b>assurance</b> based on sound auditing principles without excessively monitoring performance; building a quality culture where <b>quality</b> <b>assurance</b> is practiced in an enabling environment; and allowing <b>quality</b> <b>assurance</b> practices to be adaptable. Practical implications – The aspects identified are particularly important for <b>quality</b> <b>assurance</b> practitioners, developers of <b>quality</b> <b>assurance</b> processes and academics at universities to enable enhancement of academic <b>quality</b> <b>assurance</b> practices. Originality/value – This paper argued that the nature of managerialism caused <b>quality</b> <b>assurance</b> to lose its meaning.

40|$|What is <b>quality</b> <b>assurance?</b> What is {{the purpose}} of higher {{education}} and how does it affect the way <b>quality</b> <b>assurance</b> is carried out? What value can be placed on <b>quality</b> <b>assurance</b> and could it enhance a student’s learning outcome? This research takes a reflective and critical look at these questions amidst the disparagement of <b>quality</b> <b>assurance</b> and problems issuing from practice. Aside from definitional issues, <b>quality</b> <b>assurance</b> has not fulfilled its expected purpose, which for all intents hinges on compliance and improvement. It is hoped that understanding the prevailing interpretation of <b>quality</b> <b>assurance</b> by regulators, a better grasp of the controverted issues could emerge and a renewed understanding of the meaning of <b>quality</b> <b>assurance</b> stimulated. Using the methods of in-depth interview and analysing relevant documents, this thesis explored the extent to which <b>quality</b> <b>assurance</b> agents in Nigeria and South Africa engage with the epistemological basis of <b>quality</b> <b>assurance.</b> I highlighted deficiencies that offer compelling arguments for reforming the mechanism. I employed an emic and etic perspective and an interpretist approach underpinned by hermeneutics. Diametrically opposed to the essential nature of <b>quality</b> <b>assurance</b> are the external control of <b>quality</b> <b>assurance</b> and the mistaken view that <b>quality</b> <b>assurance</b> is the preserve of a particular group. Also dysfunctional is the endowment of <b>quality</b> <b>assurance</b> with attributes from industry such as appropriating the concepts of quality control and auditability. Where accountability dominates, emphasis on improvement is not given equal priority. Besides, focussing on compliance yields compliant sinners causing unethical behaviour and declining standards to be prevalent in universities and among students. Nonetheless, <b>quality</b> <b>assurance</b> is valued and has brought some improvement albeit extracted under duress. The internalisation of the essential nature of <b>quality</b> <b>assurance,</b> and not just quality as a seven –letter word or it misrepresentation as minimum standard, requires a more strategic approach. My original contribution to knowledge is the proposal of a mechanism for <b>quality</b> <b>assurance,</b> which is neither prescriptive nor presuming upon a political mandate. Embodying the scope of what <b>quality</b> <b>assurance</b> should entail, this mechanism crystallises the internalisation of <b>quality</b> <b>assurance.</b> It provides some clarification for <b>quality</b> <b>assurance</b> and offers a proposition for future research...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND. The {{introduction}} of <b>quality</b> <b>assurance</b> and medical audit {{has been an}} important development in general practice. However, the {{introduction of}} such programmes does not necessarily mean they are implemented by general practitioners. AIM. A study was undertaken to describe the problems and requirements perceived by general practitioners in relation to the implementation of <b>quality</b> <b>assurance</b> and medical audit in general practice. METHOD. Interviews were carried out with a stratified sample of 120 Dutch general practitioners. Knowledge, acceptance and application of <b>quality</b> <b>assurance</b> and medical audit activities were investigated, and perceived problems and requirements in implementing <b>quality</b> <b>assurance</b> and audit activities were explored. RESULTS. General practitioners in the Netherlands were generally positive towards <b>quality</b> <b>assurance</b> activities, but had little experience of carrying out such activities. The most frequently mentioned obstacles to implementing <b>quality</b> <b>assurance</b> activities concerned lack of time, colleagues' negative attitudes and fear of assessment and criticism by colleagues. Requirements for implementing <b>quality</b> <b>assurance</b> included having regular meetings with colleagues about <b>quality</b> <b>assurance,</b> having information on the aims and methods of <b>quality</b> <b>assurance,</b> having data from other practices with which to compare performance, having support in data collection, in audit in the practice and in setting up local peer review, and having financial support. The most important factor predicting the actual application of <b>quality</b> <b>assurance</b> activities was found to be knowledge of specific <b>quality</b> <b>assurance</b> activities. CONCLUSION. Well-designed programmes for the implementation of <b>quality</b> <b>assurance</b> and medical audit, using a variety of different interventions, have to be developed. Such programmes should include the training of professionals in the concepts and methods of <b>quality</b> <b>assurance</b> as well as the provision of financial support for <b>quality</b> <b>assurance</b> activities...|$|R
