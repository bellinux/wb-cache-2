25|$|A {{circuit breaker}} is an {{automatically}} operated electrical switch {{designed to protect}} an electrical circuit from damage caused by overload or short circuit. Its basic function is to detect a fault condition and, by interrupting continuity, to immediately discontinue electrical flow. Unlike a fuse, which operates once and then has to be replaced, a circuit breaker can be reset (either manually or automatically) to resume normal operation. Circuit breakers are made in varying sizes, from small devices that protect an individual <b>household</b> <b>appliance</b> up to large switchgear designed to protect high voltage circuits feeding an entire city. Inspired by the works of American scientist Joseph Henry and English scientist Michael Faraday, the circuit breaker was invented by an American, Charles Grafton Page.|$|E

Nowadays, consumers have total control over buying <b>household</b> <b>appliances</b> and a far larger choice. Consumers of <b>household</b> <b>appliances,</b> whose consumption was the driving force before the times of crisis and recession, today, when making a decision about buying <b>household</b> <b>appliances</b> take more factors into consideration, which makes their decision far more complex. From the aspect of <b>household</b> <b>appliances</b> consumers changed values and motives, the key trends are: insisting on simplicity, <b>household</b> <b>appliances</b> producers’ social responsibility, ethical business, demand for energy saving products, loyalty etc. With the appearance of energy saving <b>household</b> <b>appliances</b> and appliances that do not pollute the environment the consumers have been questioning their consumer habits and turning towards »the green way of life«.

25|$|A {{circuit breaker}} is an {{automatically}} operated electrical switch {{designed to protect}} an electrical circuit from damage caused by excess current, typically resulting from an overload or short circuit. Its basic function is to interrupt current flow after a fault is detected. Unlike a fuse, which operates once and then must be replaced, a circuit breaker can be reset (either manually or automatically) to resume normal operation. Circuit breakers are made in varying sizes, from small devices that protect low-current circuits or individual <b>household</b> <b>appliance,</b> up to large switchgear designed to protect high voltage circuits feeding an entire city. The generic function of a circuit breaker, RCD or a fuse, as an automatic means of removing power from a faulty system is often abbreviated as ADS (Automatic Disconnection of Supply).|$|E

40|$|Exposure to {{electric}} and magnetic fields {{due to the}} use of most <b>household</b> <b>appliances</b> does not exceed the exposure levels recommended by the European Union. No short-term health effects are to be expected for these appliances. All appliances connected to the power grid are surrounded by {{electric and}} magnetic fields to which the user can be exposed. Because some people worry about possible health effects caused by this exposure, it is important to study the electromagnetic fields in the vicinity of <b>household</b> <b>appliances.</b> This report evaluates the scientific investigations of health effects that may occur in using <b>household</b> <b>appliances.</b> The legislation for the use of these appliances in both the European Union and the Netherlands is also described. Finally, an overview is given of comparative measurements with respect to the magnetic fields and exposure in the neighbourhood of <b>household</b> <b>appliances.</b> Scientific literature, which is not always up to date, suggests that for some <b>household</b> <b>appliances</b> possibly still in use, the magnetic fields will exceed the exposure levels advised by the EU. As a result of both technological improvement and the current obligation that <b>household</b> <b>appliances</b> comply with a European standard, exceeding the levels advised by the EU for appliances that come onto the market is less likely. The exposure levels recommended by the EU are based on effects that occur during or shortly afterwards exposure. It cannot be ruled out that exposure below these levels may lead to long-term health effects. However, there is no scientific evidence for a relationship between cancer and the use of <b>household</b> <b>appliances...</b>|$|R
