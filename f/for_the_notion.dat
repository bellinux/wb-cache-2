500|$|Conversely, various Marxist {{observers}} – including Western historians Hill and John Rees – {{argued against}} {{the view that}} Lenin's government was a dictatorship, viewing it instead as an imperfect way of preserving elements of democracy without some of the processes found in liberal democratic states. Ryan contends that the leftist historian Paul Le Blanc [...] "makes a quite valid point that the personal qualities that led Lenin to brutal policies were not necessarily any stronger than {{in some of the}} major Western leaders of the twentieth century". Ryan also posits that for Lenin, 'revolutionary' violence was merely a means to an end: the establishment of a socialist, ultimately communist world – a world without violence. Historian J. Arch Getty remarked, [...] "Lenin deserves a lot of credit <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> that the meek can inherit the earth, that there can be a political movement based on social justice and equality."

2500|$|The {{theory of}} {{complexes}} of groups (see Haefliger, Corson Bridson-Haefliger) provides a higher-dimensional generalization of Bass–Serre theory. The {{notion of a}} graph of groups is replaced by that of a complex of groups, where groups are assigned to each cell in a simplicial complex, together with monomorphisms between these groups corresponding to face inclusions (these monomorphisms are required to satisfy certain compatibility conditions). One can then define an analog of the fundamental group of a graph of groups for a complex of groups. However, in order for this notion to have good algebraic properties (such as embeddability of the vertex groups in it) and {{in order for a}} good analog <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> of the Bass–Serre covering tree to exist in this context, one needs to require some sort of [...] "non-positive curvature" [...] condition for the complex of groups in question (see, for example [...] ).|$|E
2500|$|One early theory {{proposed}} for the acceleration of auroral electrons {{is based on an}} assumed static, or quasi-static, electric field creating a uni-directional potential drop.
