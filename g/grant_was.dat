5|$|A {{number of}} studies have been carried out on the creek and its watershed. These include the Darby Creek Stream Valley Park Master Plan in 1987 and the Greenway Plan for the Darby Creek Watershed in 2011.

5|$|Grant quickly {{raised and}} {{recruited}} {{a company of}} volunteers, and was given the captaincy, accompanying them to Springfield. He perceived that the war would be fought mostly by volunteers, not career soldiers. Governor Richard Yates offered Grant a militia commission to recruit and train volunteer units, which he accepted, but still wanted a field command. He made several efforts through his professional contacts. Major General George B. McClellan refused to see him, remembering the day in Oregon in 1853 when he saw Grant on a drunken spree. With the aid of his advocate, Representative Elihu B. Washburne of Illinois, <b>Grant</b> <b>was</b> promoted to Colonel on June 14 and charged with disciplining the unruly 21st Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment. Transferred to northern Missouri, <b>Grant</b> <b>was</b> promoted to Brigadier General, backdated to May 17, 1861.|$|E
5|$|<b>Grant</b> <b>was</b> {{accused by}} Senator Charles Sumner in 1872 of {{practicing}} nepotism while President. Sumner's accusation {{was not an}} exaggeration. Grant's cousin Silas A. Hudson was appointed minister to Guatemala. His brother-in-law Reverend M.J. Cramer was appointed as consul at Leipzig. His brother-in-law James F. Casey was given the position of Collector of Customs in New Orleans, Louisiana where he made money by stealing fees. Frederick Dent, another brother-in-law was the White House usher and made money giving out insider information. In all, {{it is estimated that}} 40 relatives somehow financially prospered indirectly while <b>Grant</b> <b>was</b> President.|$|E

5|$|<b>Grant</b> <b>was</b> now {{riding a}} rising tide of popularity, and there was talk that a Union victory early in the year could lead to his {{candidacy}} for the presidency. He was aware of the rumors, but had ruled out a political candidacy; the possibility would soon vanish with delays on the battlefield.|$|E
5|$|<b>Grant</b> <b>was</b> {{president}} {{during the}} Gilded Age, {{a time of}} massive industrial wealth, railroad speculation, and extravagance that fueled unethical behavior and influence in government offices. Although <b>Grant</b> <b>was</b> not personally involved in scandal, multiple corruption charges swept through his administration, clouding Grant's historical reputation. <b>Grant</b> <b>was</b> greatly trusting of men involved in speculation, particularly wealthy Gilded Age tycoons, loyally defending his corrupt cabinet or appointees whom he believed were innocent. Grant's failure was in his poor selection of cabinet officers and how he responded to their downfalls. Grant did not stop the guilty parties prosecutions, but was often insistent about having them prosecuted. His political enemies, outraged over the scandals, were eager to discredit Reconstruction, and the moral integrity of his administration. No person linked any of the scandals together, except possibly Grant's personal secretary, Orville E. Babcock, who indirectly controlled many cabinet departments and delayed federal investigations. Historians debate how effective he was at halting corruption.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to this, Lancaster was given palatinate status {{for the county}} of Lancashire, which entailed a separate administration independent of the crown.
