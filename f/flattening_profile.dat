40|$|The global dynamic {{flattening}} (H) {{is an important}} quantity in research of global geophysics, geodynamics and astronomy. It relates with the luni-solar precession, nutation(18. 6 yr terms), tilt-over mode and so on. From observations, the value of H is about 1 / 305. 5 with very high accuracy. But the calculated value of H from PREM model is about 1 / 308. 8 at the first order accuracy. There is about 1 % difference between them, which is an interesting question and attracted many researches since 1980 s. But, there is not any certain conclusion about it till now. At first, we recalculate the geometrical flattening (f) profile, which is rotating symmetric,from PREM Earth model from potential theory in hydrostatic equilibrium (HSE). Higher accuracy and more pivotal points are adopted in this work, and we get finer <b>flattening</b> <b>profile</b> than before. By using of the finer <b>flattening</b> <b>profile,</b> we get the {{dynamic flattening}} of PREM (H_PREM), {{which is a little}} closer to the observed value than before. But the change is so little that no matter how many points and how high the accuracy we adopt, the 1 % difference can not be interpretted. In order to study this 1 % difference, we replace the homogenous uppest crust and ocean layers in PREM with some real surface layers model. According to the depth range of each model, we construct three Earth models as following:...|$|E

The novelty method in this research is based on writing the two ULPFGs as fat gratings. The LPG is written by a simple and available arc-discharge method. The pump power based on single-pass backward pump configuration is around 100 mW, and the average wavelength is near to 974 nm.

40|$|We characterise the radial density, {{metallicity}} and <b>flattening</b> <b>profile</b> of the Milky Way's stellar halo, {{based on}} the large sample of 1757 spectroscopically confirmed giant stars from SDSS/SEGUE- 2 after excising stars that were algorithmically attributed to apparent halo substructure (including the Sagittarius stream). Compared to BHB stars or RR Lyrae, giants are more readily understood tracers of the overall halo star population, with less bias in age or metallicity. The well-characterized selection function of the sample enables forward modelling of those data, based on ellipsoidal stellar density models, ν_* (R,z), with Einasto profiles and (broken) power laws for their radial dependence, combined with {{a model for the}} metallicity gradient and the <b>flattening</b> <b>profile.</b> Among models with constant flattening, these data are reasonably well fit by an Einasto profile of n= 3. 1 ± 0. 5 with an effective radius r_eff = 15 ± 2 kpc and a flattening of q= 0. 7 ± 0. 02; or comparably well by an equally flattened broken power-law, with radial slopes of α_in= 2. 1 ± 0. 3 and α_out= 3. 8 ± 0. 1, with a break-radius of r_break= 18 ± 1 kpc; this is largely consistent with earlier work. We find a modest, but significant metallicity gradient within the "outer" stellar halo, [Fe/H] decreasing outward. If we allow for a variable flattening q = f(r_GC), we find the distribution of halo giants to be considerably more flattened at small radii, q(10 kpc) ∼ 0. 57, compared to q(> 30 kpc) ∼ 0. 8. Remarkably, the data are then very well fit by a single power-law of index ∼ 4. 2 ± 0. 1 of the variable r_q≡√(R^ 2 +(z/q(r)) ^ 2). In this simple and better fitting model, there is a break in flattening at ∼ 20 kpc, instead of a break in the radial density function. Comment: accepted by ApJ. Final versio...|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} the Clairaut {{theory of the}} equilibrium ellipsoidal figures for differentiated non-homogeneous bodies in non-synchronous rotation adding to it a tidal deformation due {{to the presence of}} an external gravitational force. We assume that the body is a fluid formed by n homogeneous layers of ellipsoidal shape and we calculate the external polar flattenings and the mean radius of each layer, or, equivalently, their semiaxes. To first order in the flattenings, the general solution can be written as ϵ_k= H_k*ϵ_h and μ_k= H_k*μ_h, where H_k is a characteristic coefficient for each layer which only depends on the internal structure of the body and ϵ_h, μ_h are the flattenings of the equivalent homogeneous problem. For the continuous case, we study the Clairaut differential equation for the <b>flattening</b> <b>profile,</b> using the Radau transformation to find the boundary conditions when the tidal potential is added. Finally, the theory is applied to several examples: i) a body composed of two homogeneous layers; ii) bodies with simple polynomial density distribution laws and iii) bodies following a polytropic pressure-density law.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} the relaxation of a smooth two [...] dimensional vortex to axisymmetry after {{the application of}} an instantaneous, weak external strain field. In this limit the disturbance decays exponentially in time {{at a rate that}} is linked to a pole of the associated linear inviscid problem (known as a Landau pole). As a model of a typical vortex distribution that can give rise to cat's eyes, here distributions are examined that have a basic Gaussian shape but whose profiles have been artificially flattened about some radius r_c. A numerical study of the Landau poles for this family of vortices shows that as r_c is varied so the decay rate of the disturbance moves smoothly between poles as the decay rates of two Landau poles cross. Cat's eyes that occur in the nonlinear evolution of a vortex lead to an axisymmetric azimuthally averaged profile with an annulus of approximately uniform vorticity, rather like the artificially <b>flattened</b> <b>profiles</b> investigated. Based on the stability of such profiles it is found that finite thickness cat's eyes can persist (i. e. the mean profile has a neutral mode) at two distinct radii, and in the limit of a thin flattened region the result that vanishingly thin cat's eyes only persist at a single radius is recovered.

40|$|Background The {{underlying}} {{mechanism of}} dynamic {{control of the}} genome-wide expression is a funda-mental issue in bioscience. We addressed {{it in terms of}} phase transition by a systemic ap-proach based on both density analysis and characteristics of temporal fluctuation for the time-course mRNA expression in differentiating MCF- 7 breast cancer cells. Methodology In a recent work, we suggested criticality as an essential aspect of dynamic control of ge-nome-wide gene expression. Criticality was evident by a unimodal-bimodal transition through <b>flattened</b> unimodal expression <b>profile.</b> The flatness on the transition suggests the existence of a critical transition at which up- and down-regulated expression is balanced. Mean field (averaging) behavior of mRNAs based on the temporal expression changes re-veals a sandpile type of transition in the <b>flattened</b> <b>profile.</b> Furthermore, around the transition, a self-similar unimodal-bimodal transition of the whole expression occurs in the density pro-file of an ensemble of mRNA expression.
