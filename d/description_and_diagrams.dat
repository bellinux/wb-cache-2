50|$|In a harpsichord, {{the main}} part of the action is a jack, a {{vertical}} strip of wood seated on the far end of the key. At the top of the jack is mounted a hinged tongue bearing a plectrum. When the key is pressed and the jack rises, the plectrum plucks the string. When the key is released and the jack falls back down, the tongue permits the plectrum to retract slightly, so that it can return to its rest position without getting stuck or plucking the string again on the way down. The jack also bears a damper, whose purpose is to stop the vibration of the string when the key is released. For full <b>description</b> <b>and</b> <b>diagrams,</b> see Harpsichord.|$|E

40|$|The {{design and}} {{implementation}} of an ETL (extract-transformload) process for a data warehouse proceeds from a conceptual model to a logical model, and then a physical model and implementation. The conceptual model conveys {{at a high level}} the data sources and targets, and the transformation steps from sources to targets. The current state of the art is to express the conceptual model informally using text <b>descriptions</b> <b>and</b> <b>diagrams.</b> This makes the process of deriving a logical model time-consuming and error-prone.

In this paper, we focus on the ETL conceptual layer and present a solution that assists consultants in their task of defining the needs and requirements at the early stages of an integration project. We present a conceptual model for ETL based on hypercubes and hypercube operations. This is a formal model that captures the semantics of ETL at a high-level but that can also be machinetranslated into a logical model for ETL. The use of hypercubes at the conceptual level renders a design that can be easily understood by business users and so reduces design and development time and produces a result that accurately captures service level agreements and business requirements...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We study resolving {{conflicts}} between an action <b>description</b> <b>and</b> {{a set of}} conditions (possibly obtained from observations), {{in the context of}} action languages. In this formal framework, the meaning of an action description can be represented by a transition diagram—a directed graph whose nodes correspond to states and whose edges correspond to transitions describing action occurrences. This allows us to characterize conflicts by means of states and transitions of the given action description that violate some given conditions. We introduce a basic method to resolve such conflicts by modifying the action <b>description,</b> <b>and</b> discuss how the user can be supported in obtaining more preferred solutions. For that, we identify helpful questions the user may ask (e. g., which specific parts of the action description cause a conflict with some given condition), and we provide answers to them using properties of action <b>descriptions</b> <b>and</b> transition <b>diagrams.</b> Finally, we discuss the computational complexity of these questions in terms of related decision problems. ...|$|R

40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} these {{experiments}} {{was to develop a}} rating-of-fatigue (ROF) scale capable of tracking the intensity of perceived fatigue in a variety of contexts. Methods: Four experiments were carried out. The first provided the evidential basis for the construction of the ROF scale. The second tested the face validity of the ROF, and the third tested the convergent and divergent validity of the ROF scale during ramped cycling to exhaustion and 30 min of resting recovery. The final experiment tested the convergent validity of the ROF scale with time of day and physical activity (accelerometer counts) across a whole week. Results: Modal selections of <b>descriptions</b> <b>and</b> <b>diagrams</b> at different levels of exertion and recovery were found during Experiment 1 upon which the ROF scale was constructed and finalised. In Experiment 2, a high level of face validity was indicated, in that ROF was reported to represent fatigue rather than exertion. Descriptor and diagrammatic elements of ROF reportedly added to the coherence and ease of use of the scale. In Experiment 3, high convergence between ROF and various physiological measures were found during exercise and recovery (heart rate, blood lactate concentration, oxygen uptake, carbon dioxide production, respiratory exchange ratio and ventilation rate were all P < 0. 001). During ramped cycling to exhaustion ROF and RPE did correspond (P < 0. 0001) but not during recovery, demonstrating discriminant validity. Experiment 4 found ROF to correspond with waking time during each day (Mon–Sun all P < 0. 0001) and with physical activity (accelerometer count) (Mon–Sun all P < 0. 001). Conclusions: The ROF scale has good face validity and high levels of convergent validity during ramped cycling to exhaustion, resting recovery and daily living activities. The ROF scale has both theoretical and applied potential in understanding changes in fatigue in a variety of contexts...|$|R
40|$|Process {{modelling}} {{is one of}} the extensively {{time consuming}} tasks within the fieldof process management. This thesis represents an alternative approach minimizing the effort for process modelling based on an intelligent, self-learning system. The current situation of process management in practise is the starting point forthe definition of the requirements which an appropriate information system architecture has to fulfil to solve the issues of contemporary process modelling. The current situation is described by a combination of theoretical considerations aboutcontemporary process management and a survey estimating the efforts needed tomodel <b>and</b> update process <b>descriptions</b> <b>and</b> <b>diagrams</b> out of several, very different documents. The identified requirements represent the groundwork for the derivation of manda-tory features and the architectural composition of the basic components of an intelligent software system and its integration in a process manager’s work. Moreover the effects of the integration of the defined intelligent software system on the social-technical interactions within organizations are sketched. Because text analysis and the transformation of texts into process diagrams crucially influences efficiency and effectivity in process management appropriate, established technologies are comparatively evaluated and discussed regarding theirability to reduce these efforts. According to the identified advantages and limitations of artificial neural networks within the qualitative comparison of the dif-ferent technologies a new concept was developed to fit the needs more holisticthan the existing concepts. The new concept consists of aspects of different established technologies, biological findings and philosophical thoughts about the impossibility of a physical representation of human mind. It results in a conceptof three-dimensional, spatiotemporal flexible, artificial neural networks, which change themselves permanently. A final qualitative comparison figures out thedifferences between the characteristics of existing concepts of artificial neural networks and determines the improvements and benefits the new concept of neural networks achieves...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1975 Adapting man, as {{an organic}} link, to {{closed loop control}} systems, is {{increasingly}} presenting problems to designers of systems of any nature. Performance of the human in the systems is dependent upon a multitude of recognized factors, and many as yet unknown factors and variables. In order to investigate the problem areas involved, a means of simulating real life conditions must be available. This study centers {{on the development of}} such a laboratory simulator system and its requirements. The main area of interest selected is the human operator in tracking operations. This subject area is thoroughly researched and the major problem areas are briefly discussed. The tracking areas to be simulated include pursuit and compensatory tracking tasks, multi-dimensional tracking tasks as well as environmental control criteria for the subject, the latter consisting of an environmentally controlled chamber. Facilities were selected, based upon previous tracking studies to vary some of the basic environmental conditions: illumination, sound pressure and temperature. The tracking tasks available can be varied in type of input signal display media, operator control unit as well as waveform of the input signal, operator control response function and performance data collection. Timed, random and cumulative timed data collection features are designed into the system. In addition a chart recorder facility and interface is available for obtaining a hard copy of the actual tracking performance.
