5|$|A cold usually {{begins with}} fatigue, {{a feeling of}} being chilled, sneezing, and a headache, {{followed}} {{in a couple of days}} by a runny nose and cough. Symptoms may begin within sixteen hours of exposure and typically peak two to four days after onset. They usually resolve in seven to ten days, but some can last for up to three weeks. The average duration of cough is eighteen days and in some cases people develop a post-viral cough which can linger after the infection is gone. In children, the cough lasts <b>for</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>ten</b> days in 35–40% of cases and continues for more than 25 days in 10%.|$|E

In 1902 André Messager conducted the premiere of Debussy's opera Pelléas et Mélisande at the Opéra-Comique. It divided musical opinion. Dubois unavailingly forbade Conservatoire students to attend, and the conductor's friend and former teacher Camille Saint-Saëns was prominent among those who detested the piece. The Apaches were loud in their support. The first run of the opera consisted of fourteen performances: Ravel attended all of them.|$|E
5|$|At age 21, O'Brien {{retired after}} the 1968 Olympics, {{so he could}} {{concentrate}} solely on making a living. Since his father's death in 1962, O'Brien's swimming career had caused substantial financial stress for his family, with his mother having to sell the family home to make ends meet. O'Brien had also been forced to leave high school before he had completed his leaving certificate, {{so that he could}} support the family's income by wrapping parcels. Television and camera work had always interested O'Brien, and he secured a job as a stagehand for Channel Nine after returning from the Tokyo Olympics, which he held <b>for</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>ten</b> years. He then worked for Channel Ten for two years, before working for an independent production company for another two years. In 1979, he started Videopak, which became one of the largest privately owned television documentary companies in Australia. Videopak's sound stages were used by public and private television companies. O'Brien was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 1986. In 2000, he received an Australian Sports Medal.|$|E

5|$|In 1885, Helena {{made plans}} to move to New York in the United States to join her sister Lena and her husband. Goldman wanted to join her sister, but their father refused to allow it.

He finally agreed, and on December 29, 1885, Helena and Emma arrived at New York City's Castle Garden, the entry for immigrants. They settled upstate, living in the Rochester home which Lena had made with her husband Samuel.

5|$|Queen Adelaide {{attended}} the dying William devotedly, {{not going to}} bed herself <b>for</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>ten</b> days. William IV died {{in the early hours}} of the morning of 20 June 1837 at Windsor Castle, where he was buried. As he had no living legitimate issue, the Crown of the United Kingdom passed to Princess Victoria of Kent, the only child of Edward Augustus, Duke of Kent, George III's fourth son. Under Salic Law, a woman could not rule Hanover, and so the Hanoverian Crown went to George III's fifth son, Ernest Augustus, Duke of Cumberland. William's death thus ended the personal union of Britain and Hanover, which had persisted since 1714. The main beneficiaries of his will were his eight surviving children by Mrs. Jordan. Although William IV is not the direct ancestor of the later monarchs of the United Kingdom, he has many notable descendants through his illegitimate family with Mrs. Jordan, including former Prime Minister David Cameron, TV presenter Adam Hart-Davis, author and statesman Duff Cooper, and the first Duke of Fife, who married Queen Victoria's granddaughter Louise.|$|E

40|$|Floorplanning is {{a crucial}} phase in VLSI Physical Design. The {{subsequent}} placement and routing of the cells/modules are coupled very closely {{with the quality of}} the floorplan. A widely used technique for floorplanning is Simulated Annealing. It gives very good floorplanning results but has major limitation in terms of running time. <b>For</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>tens</b> of modules Simulated Annealing is not practical. Floorplanning forms the core of many synthesis applications. Designers need faster prediction of system metrics to quickly evaluate the effects of design changes. Early prediction of metrics is imperative for estimating timing and routability. In this work we propose a constructive technique for predicting floorplan metrics. We show how to modify the existing top-down partitioning based floorplanning to obtain a fast and accurate floorplan prediction. The prediction gets better as number of modules and flexibility in their shapes increases. We also explore the applicability of traditional Sizing Theorem when combining two modules based on their sizes and interconnecting wirelength. Experimental results show that our prediction algorithm can predict the area/length cost function normally within 5 - 10 % of the results obtained by Simulated Annealing and is, on the average, thousand times faster...|$|R
