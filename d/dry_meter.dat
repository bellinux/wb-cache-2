40|$|The {{samples of}} table salt bought in Belgrade {{supermarkets}} are analysed in this paper. The method of indirect iodometry {{was used in}} the process of the analysis, and received results were converted into the content of KI in mg/kg of salt. Beside the content of KI, the content of NaCl was also determined, counted to <b>dry</b> <b>meter</b> and water content, and received results were compared with the requests determined by Regulations of Table Salt Quality Meant for Human Diet and by manufacturers' declaration. Received results show that the volumetric method of indirect iodometry, applied in this analysis, is very reliable for determination of potassium iodine in table salt, because of its high precision and reproducibility of the analysis results. All received results show that the samples of table salt which can be bought in supermarkets are according to the demands given by Regulations. Only one sample (evaporated salt) has significantly less mass of KI than it is determined by Regulations, but also by manufacturer's declaration. Measured humidity in the samples of table salt received from sea salt (sample 1) is higher than humidity in the samples received from rock salt as the result of magnesium presence in sea salt, which is hygroscopic material. Although samples 5 and 6 also originate from sea salt, their smaller humidity is the result of additional heating and salt processing. ...|$|E

40|$|International audienceDeep {{drilling}} of borewells {{to hundreds}} of meters – depth is increasingly frequent for water exploration in fractured crystalline rocks. At the same time, many studies provide evidence that hard-rocks areas are characterized by a shallow higher-permeability zone (‘‘active'' zone) that overlies a deeper lower-permeability zone hosting little flow (‘‘inactive'' zone). Consequently, the yields of borewells decrease dramatically with depth. This gap between hydrogeological practice and science {{can be explained by}} a well-known behaviour in psychological sciences. The escalation of commitment consists in justifying increased investment in a decision, based on the cumulative prior investment, despite new evidence suggesting that the decision was probably wrong. This behaviour leads to the sunk cost fallacy of deep drilling: drilling a borehole to unreasonable depth in the hope of recovering the money wasted to drill the first <b>dry</b> <b>meters.</b> As water experts, we should contribute to end this irrational trend of wells deepening in hard-rocks...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: This review {{focuses on}} the key {{findings}} and developments in the rapidly expanding research area of pharmaceutical aerosol electrostatics. Key findings: Data from limited in-vivo and computational studies suggest that charges may potentially affect particle deposition in the airways. Charging occurs naturally {{in the absence of}} electric fields through triboelectrification, that is contact or friction for solids and flowing or spraying for liquids. Thus, particles and droplets emitted from pulmonary drug delivery devices (<b>dry</b> powder inhalers, <b>metered</b> dose inhalers with or without spacers, and nebulisers) are inherently charged. Apparatus with various operation principles have been employed in the measurement of pharmaceutical charges. Aerosol charges are dependent on many physicochemical parameters, such as formulation composition, device construction, relative humidity and solid-state properties. In some devices, electrification has been purposefully applied to facilitate powder dispersion and liquid atomisation. Summary: Currently, there are no regulatory requirements on characterising electrostatic properties of inhalation aerosols. As research in this area progresses, the new knowledge gained may become valuable for the development and regulation of inhalation aerosol products. © 2009 The Authors. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

As the practical and economic limitations of existing control measures for controlling NOX are reached, the cement manufacturer {{is faced with}} the need to further control NOX, while continuing to improve the control of other pollutants. Selective catalytic reduction (SCR) is a technology that can complement or be used in lieu of the better known techniques such as staged combustion in the calciner (SCC) and selective non-catalytic reduction (SNCR). Since mid- 2006, the second-of-its-kind “high-dust ” SCR installation has proved successful at the Cementeria di Monselice in Padova Province, Italy.

40|$|Introduction: The {{metabolic}} energy cost of human walking {{has been extensively}} studied. However, the influence of terrain on the metabolic costs incurred across commonly encountered surfaces is not well understood. Objective: Our objective was to test whether the metabolic cost of walking would vary between treadmill, asphalt, and grass surfaces. We hypothesized that the {{metabolic energy}} cost of walking would not differ between the three common level walking conditions: (standard) commercial treadmill, firm asphalt and well-groomed grass field. Methods: Five subjects walked on a level treadmill at speeds ranging from 0. 4 m·s- 1 to 1. 9 m·s- 1. Indirect calorimetry {{was used to measure}} rates of oxygen uptake under steady-state conditions (Parvo Medics TrueOne 2400, Sandy, UT). The same five subjects walked at 1. 0, 1. 3, and 1. 6 m·s- 1 on a 50 meter oval course set up both in a parking lot and in a well-maintained field with short grass. Expired air was collected in Douglas bags during steady-state conditions at each of the three speeds and the gas composition (Parvo Medics TrueOne 2400, Sandy, UT) and gas volume (<b>Dry</b> Gas <b>Meter,</b> Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA) were measured for each bag. Analysis: Oxygen uptake was calculated based on gas analysis and volume measurements for the asphalt and grass walking tests, and was obtained from the Parvo Medics system for the treadmill tests. The relative oxygen uptake (ml·kg- 1 ·min- 1) at 1. 0, 1. 3, and 1. 6 m·s- 1 was compared across the treadmill, asphalt, and grass walking conditions. Results: Oxygen uptake was similar between treadmill and asphalt walking across all speeds; however, oxygen uptake was greater when walking on grass (14. 1 ± 0. 7 ml·kg- 1 ·min- 1) than on the treadmill (13. 5 ± 0. 6 ml·kg- 1 ·min- 1) or on asphalt (13. 2 ± 0. 6 ml·kg- 1 ·min- 1) by 5. 2 % and 6. 6 %, respectively. Further, the difference between walking on grass and walking on the treadmill or on asphalt was more pronounced at faster speeds. Conclusion: We conclude that the metabolic energy cost of walking on well-groomed level grass is greater than either walking on a treadmill or on asphalt...|$|R
40|$|Development of Cleanup Methods for PCB Containing Elastic Sealant Used in Outdoor Joints between Concrete Blocks in Buildings. The {{goals of}} the project were to develop cleanup methods for PCB {{containing}} elastic sealants used in outdoor joints between concrete blocks and to minimise the PCB spread to the outdoor environment, to the indoor air and also to keep the PCB levels as low as reasonably possible in the workplace environment during the work with taking away the sealant. Analyses of PCB are done within the project. The cleanup process consisted of different steps, (1) cutting the elastic sealant with an oscillating knife, (2) grinding of the concrete with a mechanical machine, (3) sawing the concrete with a machine (4) cutting the concrete with a machine chisel. At all these different steps a high capacity vacuum cleaner which {{was connected to the}} machines was used. The following PCB analyses were done (1) concentration in the elastic sealant, (2) concentration in the concrete close to the sealant, (3) concentration in soil, (4) concentration in the indoor air, (5) concentration in the air in the workplace environment. The elastic sealant contained 6 % total PCB of a technical product with a composition most similar to Clophen A 40. The concrete close to the sealant (first 1 - 2 mm) contained 0, 11 % and 1, 7 % total PCB at two different places. The pattern of the PCBs resembled that of the sealant. PCB concentrations, å 7 PCB, in the soil increased during the work with the sealants with 0, 08 mg/kg <b>dry</b> soil 1 <b>meter</b> from the building and with less than 0, 03 mg/kg <b>dry</b> soil 10 <b>meters</b> from the building. The source of the PCB in the soil is most likely the sealant as the pattern of the PCB-congenes is similar. The PCB levels in the workplace air {{in the beginning of the}} project when the equipment used were not fully developed were generally above the occupational exposure limit 10 mg/m 3 (up to 120 mg/m 3). Later when the equipment were optimised to better take care of dust and gases produced during the cutting and grinding etc, levels were below or close to 10 mg/m 3. The pattern of the PCBs in the workplace air was different from that of the sealant containing more of the lighter components. The PCB concentration in the indoor air were measured before and under the work with cleaning-up the sealants. The levels were around 600 ng/m 3 and there was no significant increase during the work with taking away the sealant. The PCB level indoor, after the work with cleaning-up the sealants, does not show any decrease two months after the end of the work.

Inbreds developed at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln were evaluated in field, greenhouse, and growth chamber trials. Inbreds were categorized and evaluated in four groups: Group 1, high yielding; Group 2, freeze tolerant; Group 3, B population; and Group 4, 100 % germination. Greater quantities of chlorophyll were found in plants grown in the light warm than in the light cool growth chamber. A linear relationship existed between the chlorophyll meter and total chlorophyll. Therefore, the chlorophyll meter {{was found to be}} useful in predicting changes in chlorophyll concentration. Reciprocal differences in diallel hybrids were found for emergence index, leaf greenness (measured with the chlorophyll <b>meter),</b> <b>dry</b> weight, and total plants emerged. Additive effects were predominant for inheritance of emergence index, leaf greenness, and dry weight since GCA and SCA ratios (GCA/(GCA + SCA)) were large. Crosses having cold tolerant maternal parents emerged sooner, had greater leaf greenness, dry weight, and grain yield than crosses having susceptible maternal parents when grown in cool environments. Checks emerged in less time in late field plantings but later in growth chambers than groups. Groups 1 and 4 had greater dry weights in inbred and hybrid trials than checks.

40|$|Introduction {{and aims}} The {{dominance}} {{of a plant}} species in highly metal-contaminated areas reflects its tolerance or adaptability potential to these scenarios. Hence, plants with high adaptability and/or tolerance to exceptionally high metal-contaminated scenarios may help protect environmental degradation. The present study aimed to assess the strategies adopted by common reed, Phragmites australis for its dominance in highly mercury-contaminated Ria de Aveiro coastal lagoon (Portugal). Materials and methods Both plant samples and the sediments vegetated by monospecific stand of Phragmites australis were collected in five replicates from mercury-free (reference) and contaminated sites during low tide between March 2006 and January 2007. The sediments’ physico-chemical traits, plant dry mass, uptake, partitioning, and transfer of mercury were evaluated during growing season (spring, summer, autumn, and winter) of P. australis. Redox potential and pH of the sediment around roots were measured in situ using a WTW-pH 330 i <b>meter.</b> <b>Dried</b> sediments were incinerated for 4 h at 500 °C for the estimation of organic matter whereas plant samples were oven-dried at 60 °C till constant weight for plant dry mass determination. Mercury concentrations in sediments and plant parts were determined by atomic absorption spectrometry with thermal decomposition, using an advanced mercury analyzer (LECO 254) and maintaining the accuracy and precision of the analytical methodologies. In addition, mercury bioaccumulation and translocation factors were also determined to differentiate the accumulation of mercury and its subsequent translocation to plant parts in P. australis. Results and conclusions P. australis root exhibited the highest mercury accumulation followed by rhizome and leaves during the reproductive phase (autumn). During the same phase, P. australis exhibited ≈ 5 times less mercury-translocation factor (0. 03 in leaf) {{when compared with the}} highest mercury bioaccumulation factor for root (0. 14). Moreover, seasonal variations differentially impacted the studied parameters. P. australis’ extraordinary ability to (a) pool the maximum mercury in its roots and rhizomes, (b) protect its leaf against mercury toxicity by adopting the mercury exclusion, and (c) adjust the rhizosphere-sediment environment during the seasonal changes significantly helps to withstand the highly mercury-contaminated Ria de Aveiro lagoon. The current study implies that P. australis has enough potential to be used for mercury stabilization and restoration of sediments/soils rich in mercury as wel...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn this study, an {{indirect}} natural convection updraft solar dryer {{was designed and}} fabricated with objectives to; suit mid-latitude applications, determine its performance efficiency, analyze air properties by use of psychrometric chart and assess the quality of dried product. The dryer was fabricated using low cost and locally available materials. For mid-latitude regions, zenith angle is dependent on latitude, solar declination angle, {{time of the year}} and of the day. Based on these changing parameters, the solar dryer was designed to suit the conditions. The main parts of the dryer are; hinged flexible angled solar collector, drying chamber consisting of three drying trays, updraft chimney with metallic absorber plate. The experiments were carried out to dry sliced apples of 2. 5 mm thickness spread over the drying trays. Temperature and relative humidity of airflow were taken at the collector inlet, drying chamber inlet and drying chamber outlet to chimney using data loggers. Airflow inlet to solar collector and from drying chamber was determined using hot wire anemometers, irradiation in W/m 2 was measured by radiation <b>meter.</b> <b>Drying</b> characteristics such as the collected solar energy to evaporated moisture, average drying rate, moisture content, etc., were determined. Natural convectional flow was adopted with an advantage of utilizing updraft air chimney to induce thermo-siphoning effect hence improving efficiency. In our current study, fresh apples of 886. 64 grams with moisture content of 86 % were dried to moisture content of 8. 12 % (wet basis) within 9 hours 20 minutes at an average irradiance of 534. 45 W/m 2. The overall dryer efficiency was estimated to be 17. 89 %. The possibility of formation of water droplets within the drying chamber, which is a challenge to most direct solar dryers was considered to be minimal. This was based on analysis of the dew-point of drying chamber inlet air in comparison to outlet air properties.

40|$|The oil {{exploration}} {{and search for}} new oil production fields is expanding further north and has reached the Arctic. Oil drilling activities release large amounts of produced water (PW) to the marine environment and sub-lethal effects on biota cannot be excluded. The polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) present in PW have previously been shown to exhibit negative effects on growth, development and survival of aquatic organisms. The Arctic copepod Calanus glacialis is an abundant zooplankton species and holds a key position in the energy transfer from primary production to higher trophic levels. C. glacialis accumulates large volumes of lipids during late developmental stages which makes it prone to the uptake of lipophilic oil components. This study assesses {{the potential impact of}} PW-related PAHs on the metabolism of C. glacialis. In a semi-static setup, stage V C. glacialis copepodites from Kongsfjorden, Svalbard were exposed to the water soluble fraction of 11 selected PAHs (ΣPAH 7, 90 µg L- 1). The copepods were sampled at equal intervals during the exposure (120 h) and the following recovery (120 h). Oxygen consumption was measured in temperature-controlled glass chambers containing three C. glacialis each, using a fiber-optic oxygen <b>meter.</b> <b>Dry</b> weight, carbon and nitrogen content of the specimens were determined and body and lipid sac volumes were calculated based on biometrical measurements obtained from pictures of the C. glacialis individuals. Additionally, the PAH concentrations in the exposure media and the body burden in copepods were analyzed, in order to validate the exposure and assess the uptake and depuration of the components. No effects on C. glacialis respiration rate or body mass after PAH exposure were observed in the study. Findings revealed large variations in the measured endpoints between the specimens. The body size variations between individuals in the samples might be a consequence of depth-related difference in body size, since the copepods were collected with vertical hauls using an open net, and hence were sampled from the entire water column. Several of the PAHs showed modest or no decrease in body concentration after 5 days of recovery. The slow depuration of PAHs in C. glacialis confirmed in this experiment indicates that especially components with a high log Kow (octanol-water coefficient) may be more available for transfer to progeny, and for chronic exposure to species of higher trophic levels. These findings warrant for exposure studies with longer recovery periods to examine C. glacialis depuration rates of heavy PW components and for studies including the potential for trophic transfer. Further, this study expands the limited knowledge on possible effects on lipid-rich Arctic copepods resulting from exposure to PW components...|$|R

Patients and methods: This retrospective database study analyzed the direct health care costs and proportion of patients (aged 5 &ndash; 60 years) achieving asthma control over 1 year in two population groups: those starting ICS (initiation population) and those receiving a first increase in ICS dose (step-up population). Asthma control was defined as no unplanned asthma visits, oral corticosteroids, or antibiotics for lower respiratory infection; outcomes were adjusted for confounding variables. Cost-effectiveness of BAI and DPI were compared with MDI. Results: For the initiation population (n = 56, 347), average annual health care costs per person (adjusted results), as compared with MDIs, were &pound; 9 higher (95 % CI: - 1. 65 to 19. 71) for BAIs and &pound; 32 higher (95 % CI: 19. 51 to 43. 66) for DPIs. The probability of BAIs being the dominant strategy (more effective and less costly than MDIs) was 5 % and of BAIs being more effective and more costly than MDIs was 94 %. DPIs were consistently more effective and more costly than MDIs, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of &pound; 1711 (95 % CI: 760 to 3, 576) per additional controlled patient per year. For the step-up population (n = 9169), mean total health care costs per person, (adjusted) as compared with MDIs, were &pound; 1 higher (95 % CI: - 27. 28 to 31. 55) for BAIs and &pound; 73 higher (95 % CI: 44. 48 to 103. 29) for DPIs. The probability of BAIs being dominant was 48 % and of BAIs being more effective but more costly than MDIs was 52 %; the probability of DPIs being more effective but more costly than MDIs was 96 %. Conclusion: The real world effectiveness of ICS inhalers may vary, and inhaler device selection for patients with asthma should take into consideration not only initial device cost but also the subsequent health care resource costs.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{and compares}} {{the characteristics of}} soil profiles along the altitudinal gradients in Sikkilsdalen and Heimdalen, situated in southeast Norway {{on the basis of}} primary data collected from the north facing and south facing slopes. To achieve the goal, content of plant available potassium (K), magnesium (Mg), calcium (Ca) and phosphorus (P) were quantified in soil profiles at an interval of 100 m from top to bottom of the mountains. Loss on ignition, pH, particle size and soil types were also examined and described. Organic carbon (C) were determined by loss on ignition. The plant available nutrients were determined by extracting soil with AL-solution (0. 1 M ammonium lactate and 0. 4 M acetate). Soil pH of all samples were determined in a soil: water of 1 : 2. 5 (volume based) with the help of pH <b>meter.</b> <b>Dry</b> sieving was performed to determine the particle size distribution (texture) of the soil. Unified soil classification technique was used to determine the soil type on the basis of uniformity coefficient and coefficient of curvature. Overall, plant available nutrients K, Mg, Ca, organic C is found to be significantly unchanged with respect to the mountain, but, phosphate is significantly different. Soil type is not variate with altitude and slope. Particle sizes D 10, D 60 were found to be almost same in all profiles, but D 30 Varies significantly. Also, pH is not changed too with respect to the mountain, horizon and soil type. Soils were found acidic in all profiles. Organic C, K, Ca and Mg show negative correlations with pH and altitude. In contrast, phosphate is positive correlated with pH and altitude. Organic C is found to be skewed with respect to the mountains and depths. Its concentration is higher in sand than gravel, and it is declining downward as well. Average potassium contents were high in upper soil and poorly graded sand, and the average estimated content were 10 mg/ 100 g. Average Phosphate content was 1 - 2 mg/ 100 g in north face, and it was 0. 5 - 1 mg/ 100 g in south face. The content was higher in gravel than sand. Magnesium content was between 1. 4 and 57. 1 mg/ 100 gm, it was high in well graded sand, and not normally distributed. Ca varied between 10. 4 and 279. 6 mg/ 100 g and it was reducing with depth. Mg and Ca were also higher in sand than gravel. Only GG (gap graded), GP (poorly graded gravel), GW (well graded gravel), SP (poorly graded sand) and SW (well graded sand) soil types were found in both mountains on the basis of unified soil classification. pH shows almost uniform trends along the transects, however, regression lines for nutrients vary between mountains along the altitudinal gradients...|$|R
40|$|Albania has the {{following}} major sea ports: Durrës, Vlora, Sarandë and Shëngjin. The port of Durrës has the biggest {{share in the}} volume of import/export in Albania, nearly 75 %. Due to current development rates, limited possibilities for expansion and pollution in the city because of its vicinity to the port, projects are identified to construct a new port which will better meet increasing needs and demands. This gives a reason to do research on the possibilities of constructing port facilities at an alternative location. This new ‘port’ is designed in the Durrës area. To design a new port, information is needed about future trade and traffic anticipated in the future. An {{effort was made to}} make some forecasts in order to render this report more realistic. The produced forecasts are bases on a combination of past data extrapolation, trade and traffic trends as well as insight in the situation of Albania and hinterland connections. The master plan duration, which will be 25 years (2010 - 2035), is divided into three periods. Three different growth scenarios were taken into account. This report has been based on the medium growth scenario (4. 3 %, 3. 8 % and 3. 1 % increase in the total trade of Albania in tons for the three time periods respectively). Assuming a medium growth scenario 1, 807, 000 tons of dry bulk will be handled in Porto Romano in 2035, 774, 000 tons liquid bulk, 1, 033, 000 tons general cargo and 215, 111 TEUs. When Romano Port starts functioning, it is immediately able to accommodate container vessels up to 45, 000 dwt. For dry bulk it is assumed that the port should be able to accommodate vessels up to 40, 000 dwt. The General Cargo vessels which currently enter the port of Durrës have an average size of 4, 000 dwt. Although in general the size of General Cargo vessels remains relative small the average ship is expected to increase up to 10, 000 dwt in 2035, with a maximum of 15, 000 dwt. The maximum ship size for the liquid bulk terminal is assumed at 25, 000 dwt. Taking into account the above forecasts, the future needs concerning terminal areas, berths and equipment were depicted. The container terminal will require a storage area of 440, 000 m 2 and a berth length of 466 <b>meter.</b> <b>Dry</b> bulk needs an area of 62, 000 m 2 and a berth length of 240 meter. General cargo will require a storage area of 84, 000 m 2 and a berth length of 543 meter. For the liquid bulk terminal, no additional berth is required. Ten alternatives were generated based on the future needs above. Three of them were discussed in more detail. Several affecting parameters were taken into account like extensibility, tranquillity, manoeuvrability etc. The comparison among these alternatives was conducted {{with the help of a}} multi criteria analyses. The objectivity of this method was verified by doing several sensitivity checks. Finally it leads to a final optimum port layout. Two chapters are written about the breakwater and quay wall. After an analysis, where several breakwater types were discussed and a comparison between a caisson type and rubble mound breakwater was made, the rubble mound breakwater appeared to be the preferred solution. The breakwater armour layer is designed using a single layer of Accropode ll elements. A concrete unit is selected because the required weight of the armour units is substantially larger than the available 2 ton rock in the quarry nearby. For the quay wall, an open pile construction has been selected. Hydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the physical and chemical quality of maize, harvested in July, in Eldorado do Sul, Rio Grande do Sul, using two drying methods and stored for 6 months in bulk. The study was conducted in the EEA of UFRGS, in Eldorado do Sul - RS in the crop year 2007 / 2008, the harvested grain with humidity of about 30 %, and were subsequently subjected to drying in-bin drying of concrete, using two methods, 1. Stationary drying with natural air is not heated at room temperature, 2. Stationary drying with natural air heated with LPG. The height of layer for <b>drying</b> was one <b>meter</b> in all silos. After drying the grains were stored in bulk in their own silos, where they were drying out. Subsequently, at intervals of 3 months were carried out following physical chemical analysis: 1000 grain weight, volumetric weight, moisture, crude protein, ether extract, ash and carbohydrates. The drying of the grains was conducted with air flow of 2. 52 m 3. s- 1, the average air temperature during drying with natural air was 17 °C, during drying with air natural heated with LPG was 22 °C. The average air drying naturally was 48 hours, while for drying with warm air naturally with LPG was 34 hours. Grains of corn were harvested with moisture content of 31. 88 % and then dried with natural air to reach 15. 70 % moisture and air heated with natural LPG up 13. 39 % moisture. Based on the results we can conclude that: 1. The drying with natural air heated with LPG was faster than air drying in natural conditions of the study; 2. In conditions of high humidity and low temperature drying with natural air should be performed with care due to the equilibrium moisture content; 3. The two drying methods are feasible in terms of quality, but the losses of crude protein, lipid and carbohydrates were higher during the first six months of storage in dry grains with natural air; 4. The natural air drying can be an excellent alternative and low cost to small farmers to dry grain.
