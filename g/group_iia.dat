5000|$|One {{mechanism}} for determining WRKY binding activity is by protein-protein interactions. WRKY transcription {{factors have been}} found to interact with a variety of proteins, some of which occur by a group specific manner. Recent evidence suggests that VQ protein family is an important regulator of group I and group IIc WRKY transcription factors. [...] VQ proteins appear to bind the WRKY domain, thus inhibiting protein-DNA interactions. At least one WRKY transcription factor, Arabidopsis WRKY57, interacts with jasmonate ZIM-domain (JAZ) and auxin/indole acetic acid (AUX/IAA) repressor of the jasmonate and auxin signaling cascade, respectively, indicating a point of crosstalk between these phytohormones. [...] Other WRKYs interact with histone deacetylases. [...] <b>Group</b> <b>IIa</b> WRKY factors form homodimers and heterodimers within the subgroup and with other group II subgroups.

40|$|Some isoforms of {{secretory}} phospholipase A 2 (sPLA 2) {{distinguish between}} healthy and damaged or apoptotic cells. This distinction reflects differences in membrane physical properties. Because various sPLA 2 isoforms respond differently to properties of artificial membranes such as surface charge, {{they should also}} behave differently as these properties evolve during a dynamic physiological process such as apoptosis. To test this idea, S 49 lymphoma cell death was induced by glucocorticoid (6 â 48 h) or calcium ionophore. Rates of membrane hydrolysis catalyzed by various concentrations of snake venom and human <b>groups</b> <b>IIa,</b> V, and X sPLA 2 were compared after each treatment condition.

Increased hydrolysis during apoptosis and necrosis appeared to reflect substrate access to adsorbed enzyme for the snake venom and group X isoforms corresponding to weakened lipid-lipid interactions in the membrane. In contrast, apoptosis promoted initial adsorption of human <b>groups</b> V and <b>IIa</b> concurrent with phosphatidylserine exposure on the membrane surface. However, this observation was inadequate to explain the behavior of the <b>groups</b> V and <b>IIa</b> enzymes toward necrotic cells where hydrolysis was reduced or absent.

Paw withdrawal mechanical thresholds (PWTs) and paw withdrawal thermal latencies (PWLs) were measured. High-mobility group box 1 (HMGB 1) and Toll-like Receptor 4 (TLR 4) mRNA and protein expression in the spinal cord were measured. Tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-Î±), interleukin- 1 beta (IL- 1 Î²), and interleukin- 10 (IL- 10) in the spinal cord were measured, too. Both the mechanical and heat pain thresholds were significantly decreased. After Tan IIA treatment, HMGB 1, and TLR 4 mRNA and protein levels, the expression of TNF-Î± and IF- 1 Î² was reduced significantly. In conclusion, Tanshinone IIA reversed SNL-induced thermal hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia and downregulated HMGB 1 and TLR 4 levels and inhibited the HMGB 1 -TLR 4 pathway. Tanshinone IIA inhibited TNF-Î± and IL- 1 Î² expression but not IF- 10 expression in the spinal cords of SNL rats.

Pacing rates were 80 and 120 /min. Power was determined by computer analysis of pressure, volume, and time. Data were normalised by end-diastolic volume and left ventricular muscle mass. Peak left ventricular ejection power normalised by end-diastolic volume values at a pacing rate of 120 min were significantly lower in <b>group</b> <b>IIa</b> and IIb than in normal subjects.

50|$|Group II {{catalytic}} introns {{are found}} in rRNA, tRNA, and mRNA of organelles (chloroplasts and mitochondria) in fungi, plants, and protists, and also in mRNA in bacteria. They are large self-splicing ribozymes and have 6 structural domains (usually designated dI to dVI). This model and alignment represents only domains V and VI. A subset of group II introns also encode essential splicing proteins in intronic ORFs. The length of these introns can, therefore, be up to 3 kb. Splicing occurs in almost identical fashion to nuclear pre-mRNA splicing with two transesterification steps. The 2' hydroxyl of a bulged adenosine in domain VI attacks the 5' splice site, followed by nucleophilic attack on the 3' splice site by the 3' OH of the upstream exon. Protein machinery is required for splicing in vivo, and long-range intron-intron and intron-exon interactions are important for splice site positioning. Group II introns are further sub-classified into <b>groups</b> <b>IIA</b> and IIB, which differ in splice site consensus, and {{the distance of the}} bulged adenosine in domain VI (the prospective branch point forming the lariat) from the 3' splice site.|$|R

The rat tissue expansion model was used in this study to observe whether Tan IIA injection systematically could inhibit the FBR to reduce fibrous capsule formation and accelerate the process of tissue expansion. Forty-eight rats were randomly divided into the Tan <b>IIA</b> <b>group</b> and control group with 24 rats in each group. The expansion was conducted twice a week to maintain a capsule pressure of 60 mmHg. The expansion volume and expanded area were measured.

In contrast, the stimulatory effect of the cell-permeant cyclic AMP-analogue, dibutyryl-cAMP, on the induction of these enzymes was not inhibited by CGP- 43182.

The hydrolysis of phosphatidylserine (PtdSer), which was examined to a more limited extent, showed similar resistance to <b>group</b> <b>IIA,</b> V and X sPLA(2) s, although the group V sPLA(2) attacked it more readily than group X sPLA(2) (52 % versus 39 % hydrolysis, respectively). Surprisingly, the <b>group</b> <b>IIA</b> sPLA(2) hydrolysis remained minimal at 10 - 15 % for all minor glycerophospholipids, and was of the order seen for the PtdCho hydrolysis by <b>group</b> <b>IIA</b> sPLA(2) at the 4 -h digestion time. All three enzymes attacked the oligo- and polyenoic species in proportion to their mole percentage in the lipoproteins, although there were exceptions. There was evidence of a more rapid destruction of the palmitoyl compared to the stearoyl arachidonoyl glycerophospholipids. Overall, the characteristics of hydrolysis of the molecular species of the lipoprotein-bound diradyl GroPEtn, GroPIns and GroPSer by group V and X sPLA(2) s differed significantly from those observed with lipoprotein-bound PtdCho. As a result, the acidic inositol and serine glycerophospholipids accumulated in the digestion residues of both LDL and HDL, and presumably increased the acidity of the residual particles. An accumulation of the ethanolamine glycerophospholipids in the sPLA(2) digestion residues also had not been previously reported. These results further emphasize the diversity in the enzymatic activity of the <b>group</b> <b>IIA,</b> V and X sPLA(2) s. Since these sPLA(2) s possess comparable tissue distribution, their combined activity may exacerbate their known proinflammatory and proatherosclerotic function...|$|E
40|$|Inflammatory cytokines, {{interleukin}} 1 b and tumor necrosis fac-tor-a, potently stimulate rat mesangial {{cells to}} express and secrete <b>group</b> <b>IIA</b> phospholipase A 2 (PLA 2). Cytokine-induced up-regulation of PLA 2 has been blocked by inhibitors (antioxi-dants) of the transcription factor, nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB), suggesting {{a role for}} NF-kB in the regulation of <b>group</b> <b>IIA</b> PLA 2 expression. Reactive oxygen species such as H 2 O 2, which are elevated in mesangial cells after cytokine activation, can mimic cytokine-induced NF-kB activation. However, the source of reactive oxygen species generation in mesangial cells, pro-duced by cytokine stimulation, {{has yet to be}} clarified. Recently, tumor necrosis factor-a has been demonstrated to increase superoxide radical generation in mesangial cells. Therefore, we hypothesized that a selective NADPH oxidase inhibitor, diphe...|$|E
40|$|The {{antibacterial}} properties of human <b>group</b> <b>IIA</b> secreted phospholipase A(2) against Gram-positive bacteria {{as a result}} of membrane hydrolysis have been reported. Using Micrococcus luteus as a model system, we demonstrate the very high specificity of this human enzyme for such hydrolysis compared with the group IB, IIE, lIF, V, and X human secreted phospholipase A(2) s. A unique feature of the <b>group</b> <b>IIA</b> enzyme is its very high pI due to a large excess of cationic residues on the enzyme surface. The importance of this global positive charge in bacterial cell membrane hydrolysis and bacterial killing has been examined using charge reversal mutagenesis. The global positive charge on the enzyme surface allows penetration through the bacterial cell wall, thus allowing access of this enzyme to the cell membrane. Reduced bacterial killing was associated with the loss of positive charge and reduced cell membrane hydrolysis. All mutants were highly effective in hydrolyzing the bacterial membrane of cells in which the cell wall was permeabilized with lysozyme. These same overall characteristics were also seen with suspensions of Staphylococcus aureus and Listeria innocua, where cell membrane hydrolysis and antibacterial activity of human <b>group</b> <b>IIA</b> enzyme was also lost {{as a result of}} charge reversal mutagenesis...|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{determine}} the effects of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell (UCMSC) transplantation, alone or in combination with tanshinone IIA (Tan IIA) on hepatic cirrhosis in rats. MethodsA rat model of cirrhosis was established. Rats were divided into control, UCMSC, and UCSMC plus Tan <b>IIA</b> <b>groups.</b> Rats in the UCMSC group were injected via the tail vein with 0. 2 mL DiI-labeled UCMSC suspension. Intraperitoneal Tan IIA injections (20 mg/kg) were started on the day of UCMSC transplantation in the UCMSC plus Tan <b>IIA</b> <b>group,</b> and continued for 7 consecutive days thereafter. Rats were sacrificed 1 day, 3 days, 1 month, and 3 months after transplantation and the numbers of DiI-labeled UCMSCs colonizing the liver were determined. Albumin (ALB) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels were measured in venous blood, and mRNA and protein expression levels of human ALB and cytokeratin (CK) - 18 in liver tissues were determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and western blotting, respectively. ResultsSerum ALT levels were significantly lower and serum ALB levels significantly higher in rats in the UCMSC group compared with the control group (P < 0. 05). Hepatic CK- 18 and ALB mRNA and protein expression levels increased after transplantation, and were significantly higher in the UCMSC plus Tan <b>IIA</b> <b>group</b> compared with the UCMSC group (P < 0. 05). ConclusionHuman UCMSCs transplanted into rats with liver cirrhosis can grow and differentiate into hepatocyte-like cells resulting in improved liver function in vivo. Tan IIA further influenced transplantation outcomes...|$|R
