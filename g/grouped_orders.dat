40|$|The {{results of}} {{computer}} computations determining the automorphism {{groups of the}} <b>groups</b> of <b>order</b> 32 p for p ≥ 3 are given in several tables. Presentations for the automorphism groups of the <b>groups</b> of <b>order</b> 32, which in many cases appear as direct product factors in the automorphism <b>groups</b> of <b>order</b> 32 p, are also presented for completeness. Many of the <b>groups</b> of <b>order</b> 32 p with a normal sylow p-subgroup have automorphism groups of the form: Hol(C_p) × Invariant Factor. A suggestion is made as to how one might determine this invariant factor using only information on the automorphism group of the 2 -group associated with the <b>group</b> of <b>order</b> 32 p, and the normal subgroup of the 2 -group associated with {{the extension of the}} <b>group</b> of <b>order</b> 32 p. Some general comments on the <b>groups</b> of <b>order</b> 32 p^ 2 and their automorphism groups are made. A few explicit calculations for the <b>groups</b> of <b>order</b> 32 p^ 2 are reported here. Knowing the automorphism groups for the <b>groups</b> of <b>order</b> 32 p enables us to explicitly write down the automorphism groups {{for more than half of}} the automorphism groups of the <b>groups</b> of <b>order</b> 32 p^ 2.
