5000|$|Chainsaws, harvesters, and <b>feller</b> <b>bunchers</b> are {{now used}} to cut or fell trees. The tree is turned into logs by {{removing}} the limbs (delimbing) and cutting it into logs of optimal length (bucking). The felled tree or logs are moved from the stump to the landing. Ground vehicles such as a skidder or forwarder can pull, carry, or shovel the logs. Cable systems [...] "cars" [...] can pull logs to the landing. Logs can also be flown to the landing by helicopter. Logs are commonly transported to the sawmill using trucks. Harvesting methods may include clear cutting or selective cutting. Concerns over the environmental impact have led to controversy about modern logging practices. In certain areas of forest loggers re-plant their crop for future generations.|$|R

50|$|Feller is a {{traditional}} name for someone who cuts down trees, and bunching is the skidding and assembly {{of two or more}} trees. A <b>feller</b> <b>buncher</b> performs both of these harvesting functions and consists of a standard heavy equipment base with a tree-grabbing device furnished with a chain-saw, circular saw or a shearâ€”a pinching device designed to cut small trees off at the base. The machine then places the cut tree on a stack suitable for a skidder or forwarder, or other means of transport (yarding) for further processing (e.g., delimbing, bucking, loading, or chipping).|$|E
50|$|Other {{machines}} were also introduced during this period. The first <b>feller</b> <b>buncher</b> {{was used by}} the Quebec North Shore Paper Company in 1957. Hydraulic tree shears were first used in 1966 by the Abitibi Pulp and Paper Company Limited (Abitibi-Consolidated). Snowmobiles and tracked machines replaced animals for the hauling of logs. In 1948 several Bombardier {{machines were}} employed to this end by the Ste. Anne Power Company Limited in Quebec. In 1959 Timberland Machines of Woodstock, Ontario developed the Timberbuncher, a self-propelled machine which could move through the forest, cut a whole tree at its base (a process known as full tree harvesting) and, using a hydraulic arm, place it into a pile for hauling. Machines that stripped the branches from felled trees, a process known as delimbing, were also introduced at this time.|$|E
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} a full tree {{harvesting system}} operationally and economically of a eucalyptus plantation, envisaging {{the improvement of}} the production system. The study was developed in a forest company located in Goias State. The wood harvesting system was composed by <b>feller</b> <b>buncher,</b> skidder, grapple saw and forest loader. The technical analysis consisted in motion and time study for the continuous method, which the operations were divided in working cycle, productivity determination, mechanical availability and operational efficiency. The economic analysis included the operational parameters cost and production cost. The results indicated that the equipment with lower operational efficiency (35. 6 %) and lower mechanical availability (47. 1 %) occurred in the <b>feller</b> <b>buncher,</b> due to interruptions occurred in working cycle. The regression analysis indicated that the <b>feller</b> <b>buncher</b> productivity was influenced by wood volume, while the skidder by distance, the grapple saw by wood volume and forest loader by wood volume...|$|E
30|$|Most (72 %) of the {{salvage logging}} on our plots {{occurred}} during {{the fall and winter}} of 2006 to 2007. To the best of our knowledge, of the remaining salvage logged plots, 14 % were logged during the late fall and winter 2005 to 2006, 9 % {{in the spring and summer}} 2007 to 2008, and 5 % in the spring and summer 2008 to 2009 (Lewis et al. 2012). Plots salvage logged in 2005 to 2006 prior to field sampling in 2006 were assigned to burn severity class based on both field assessments after the fire in late 2005 and our assessment of stumps and standing trees in the first post-fire year. Although we placed half of all plots in each burn severity class (low, moderate, and high) in locations where post-fire salvage logging was planned (based on existing cruise markings in summer 2006 and information from local managers on the Umatilla National Forest), litigation and weather conditions influenced whether or not the plots were actually salvage logged and affected the timing of the salvage logging that did occur. Salvage logging was more often planned and implemented on plots burned with high severity than on plots burned with low or moderate severity, and the marked salvage units varied in size from 1 ha to almost 90 ha, averaging 12 ha. In 2006, the Umatilla National Forest decision to salvage log on 3818 ha total, including three timber sales on 1486 ha, was appealed. In 2007, the salvage logging prescriptions were changed so that no living, fire-damaged trees with more than 50 % of their basal cambium living were harvested, and all remnant late and old seral trees greater than 53 cm dbh were retained whether they were dead or alive (USDA Forest Service 2007). Salvage operations were primarily ground based; logs were cut and piled with tracked <b>feller</b> <b>bunchers</b> before a rubber-tired forwarder was used to move the logs to a staging area or landing.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} quantified {{the equipment}} productivity relationships between piece size and terrain conditions for mechanized harvesting operations in native forest re-growth thinning. In addition, the economic gains or losses of adding a <b>feller</b> <b>buncher</b> to a cut-to-length (CTL) harvesting system were quantified. Study {{results indicate that}} although {{the use of a}} <b>feller</b> <b>buncher</b> working in combination with two processors is more productive than the use of a harvester-processor (single-grip harvester) working alone the high cost per tonne of this harvesting system means that its use is not recommended in areas with moderately steep terrain and small tree diameter. The differential in costs obtained between the two harvesting systems (<b>feller</b> <b>buncher</b> and two processors vs. one harvester-processor) on moderately steep and gentle terrain was approximately AUD$ 5 /tonne and AUD$ 2 /tonne, respectively, for an average tree diameter of 19 cm. Regression models developed from the study showed that diameter at breast height accounted for more than 85 {{percent of the variance in}} productivity of the machines and, therefore, represented the main driver of productivity and cost per tonne of the harvesting systems in all of the scenarios studied...|$|E
40|$|A continuous-speed felling and {{bunching}} prototype {{machine was}} evaluated in harvesting a three-year-old, short-rotation sycamore planta-tion. A small tractor, grapple skidder, and large chipper were evaluated {{along with the}} prototype machine as complete harvesting systems. Predic-tion equations, production rates, and costs were developed for each component of the systems. Production of the <b>feller</b> <b>buncher</b> was about 850 stems an hour (17. 3 green Mg), and felling cost for the test was $ 3. 29 green Mg-â€˜. Total system cost â€˜was about $ 1150 green Mg-â€˜. However, cost could be reduced with a smaller chipper. A survey of stump damage showed little damage from the <b>feller</b> <b>buncher</b> when it was operating properly.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} levels of pressure and compaction induced by forest harvesting operations in a Red Latosol (LV) under planted eucalyptus. Undisturbed soil {{samples were collected}} from layers 0 - 3 and 15 - 18 cm and then used in a uniaxial compression test. Sampling was done before and after harvesting operations. Equipment being evaluated included: harvester, <b>feller</b> <b>buncher,</b> forwarder, self-loading adapted tractor, standard truck, wide-tire truck and grapple saw. Average pressures induced by the grapple saw were 320 kPa and 272 kPa, causing compaction in 80 % and 20 % of samples respectively from layers 0 - 3 cm and 15 - 18 cm, which indicates substantial degradation of soil structure in areas where timber is processed. In layer 0 - 3 cm, average pressures induced by the harvester and by the <b>feller</b> <b>buncher</b> were 240 kPa and 263 kPa respectively, while in layer 15 - 18 cm pressures were 234 kPa and 239 kPa respectively. The <b>feller</b> <b>buncher</b> caused higher soil compaction than the harvester in layer 0 - 3 cm, yet in layer 15 - 18 cm they had similar behavior. All timber forwarding equipment led to soil compaction. The wide-tire truck was the forwarding implement promoting {{the highest rate of}} compaction, in both residue conditions. Traffic intensity 7 promoted the highest rate of soil compaction...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to do a technical and costs analysis of a <b>feller</b> <b>buncher</b> and skidder in module harvesting Pinus taeda L. plantations in stands with different productivities. The study was conducted in a forestry company located in northern region of Santa Catarina State, Brazil. The analysis were made using the motion and time study, where the cutting and extraction operations were bundled into work cycle phases to determine productivity, operational efficiency, energy consumption, production and operational costs of the machines in different stands in terms of average (SAP) : I (403. 0 m 3 ha- 1); II (550. 0 m 3 ha- 1) and III (670. 0 m 3 ha- 1). The results indicated that the work cycle phases of skidder was affected by additional maneuvers in the operations of load and unload, caused by the lower volume of bunching of wood on the ground.

Companies that were only partially mechanized (<b>feller</b> <b>buncher</b> plus chainsaw operators/fellers) still showed a significant reduction in the rate of injury claims. The use of mechanized fellers will be limited in some areas because of economic and other constraints such as the cost of purchasing fellers and the steepness of the terrain in West Virginia. However, the West Virginia logging industry as a whole may see substantial declines in injury claim rates if mechanized fellers are used whenever possible. " [...] NIOSHTIC- 2 Caption title.

A Larson Davis triaxial meter integrator model HVM 100 was used and the results compared to the recommendations of ISO 2631 - 1 : 1997 (in health criterion) and Directive 2002 / 44 of the European Community. The Feller-Buncher had a magnitude of vibration equivalent of 1. 12 m. s- 2, and the recommended maximum exposure time according Griffinâ€™s (1998) methodology should be 4 h 47 min. The Skidder showed a magnitude of vibration equivalent of 1. 95 m. s- 2, where the maximum exposure should not exceed 1 h 35 min. The Slash Grapple showed the levels near and within the recommendations of these standards: 0. 99 m. s- 2.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to determine, {{through the use of}} the bearing capacity model, the traffic effects of the forest harvest operations on the preconsolidation pressure (p), during one cycle of the eucalyptus plantation. The work was conducted using undisturbed soil samples, collected at the surface of the A horizon and {{in the top of the}} B horizon of an Udult (PA), Aquox (FX) and Udox (LA) soils. The undisturbed soil samples were used in the uniaxial compression tests. The soil sampling was done before and after the harvest operations. The operations performed with the Forwarder caused greater soil compaction than the ones done with the <b>Feller</b> <b>BÃ¼ncher</b> and Harvester. The percentage of soil samples, in the region with additional soil compaction, indicated that the Udult was the soil class more susceptible to soil compaction, followed by the Aquox and Udox. Despite Udult is the more susceptible to soil compaction, the regeneration of the soil structure in this soil class was more efficient than in Aquox. The percentage of soil samples with p values in the region with additional soil compaction in 1996, 1998 and 2004, after harvest operations, indicated a sustainable forest exploration in this period. 200...|$|E
40|$|Roadside {{chipping}} is {{a common}} harvesting system in Australian plantations, which utilizes a mobile chipper stationed at the field edge to produce high-quality pulp chips for export. The studied harvesting system included a feller-buncher, two grapple skidders, a flail-debarker and a disc chipper. The study goals were to determine machine productivity, operation costs, fuel consumption, chip quality and measure the amount of slash left in the field after harvesting. The average productivity for <b>feller</b> <b>buncher</b> and skidder were about 97. 26 GMt/PMH 0 and 60. 22 GMt/PMH 0, respectively. The productivity of flail and chipper averaged at 57. 80 GMt/ PMH 0 and 58. 18 GMt/PMH 0 in this case study. The transportation productivity averaged about 57. 34 GMt/PMH 0. Time studies and regression analysis were used to model machine productivity. Tree size had {{significant impact on the}} feller-buncher productivity, while skidding distance was a significant variable affecting skidding productivity. Operation costs were evaluated using the ALPACA (Australian logging productivity and cost appraisal) model. This paper offers valuable information about the impact of different factors on feller-buncher and skidder productivity. Application of two skidders resulted in high total operating cost.

The following machines were evaluated: a <b>feller</b> <b>buncher</b> adapted into a wheel loader; a mini skidder coupled to an agricultural tractor; and a forest loader adapted to an agricultural tractor; operating in the states of ParanÃ¡ and Minas Gerais. Biomechanical working conditions were assessed by applying a checklist for simplified assessment of the workplace biomechanical conditions. The forced postures assessment was performed using the REBA - "Rapid Entire Body Assessment" method. In turn, ergonomic classification was through guidelines contained in the ergonomic classification manual "Ergonomic Guidelines for Forest Machines". Moreover, the environmental factors noise, temperature and vibration to which the operators of these machines were exposed were assessed. The results showed all assessed machines had ergonomic standards below those indicated in all assessed aspects, mainly related to access and dimensions of the workplace, need to adopt forced postures during working hours, and exposure to environmental factors assessed above tolerance limits. It is concluded that machines adapted for use in forest harvesting processes have shown significant gaps in relation to ergonomic aspects, presenting high and imminent risk of development of occupational diseases in their operators...|$|E
