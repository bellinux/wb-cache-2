5|$|On May 23, 1913, a {{grand jury}} convened to hear {{evidence}} for an indictment against Leo Frank {{for the murder of}} Mary Phagan. The prosecutor, Hugh Dorsey, presented only enough information to obtain the indictment, assuring the jury that additional <b>information</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> provided during the trial. The next day, May 24, the jury voted for an indictment. Meanwhile, Frank's legal team suggested to the media that Jim Conley was the actual killer, and put pressure on another grand jury to indict him. The jury foreman, on his own authority, convened the jury on July 21; on Dorsey's advice, they decided not to indict Conley.|$|E
5|$|The Uue–Au bond {{should be}} the weakest of all bonds between gold and an alkali metal, but should still be stable. This gives {{extrapolated}} medium-sized adsorption enthalpies (−ΔHads) of 106kJ·mol−1 on gold (the francium value should be 136kJ·mol−1), 76kJ·mol−1 on platinum, and 63kJ·mol−1 on silver, the smallest of all the alkali metals, that demonstrate {{that it would be}} feasible to study the chromatographic adsorption of ununennium onto surfaces made of noble metals. The enthalpy of adsorption of ununennium on a Teflon surface is predicted to be 17.6kJ·mol−1, which would be the lowest among the alkali metals: this <b>information</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> very useful for future chemistry experiments on ununennium. The ΔHsub and −ΔHads values are not proportionally related for the alkali metals, as they change in opposite directions as atomic number increases.|$|E
5|$|Phase Shifting Interferometry {{addresses}} {{several issues}} associated with the classical analysis of static interferograms. Classically, one measures {{the positions of the}} fringe centers. As seen in Fig.13, fringe deviations from straightness and equal spacing provide a measure of the aberration. Errors in determining the location of the fringe centers provide the inherent limit to precision of the classical analysis, and any intensity variations across the interferogram will also introduce error. There is a trade-off between precision and number of data points: closely spaced fringes provide many data points of low precision, while widely spaced fringes provide a low number of high precision data points. Since fringe center data is all that one uses in the classical analysis, all of the other information that might theoretically be obtained by detailed analysis of the intensity variations in an interferogram is thrown away. Finally, with static interferograms, additional information is needed to determine the polarity of the wavefront: In Fig.13, one can see that the tested surface on the right deviates from flatness, but one cannot tell from this single image whether this deviation from flatness is concave or convex. Traditionally, this <b>information</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> obtained using non-automated means, such as by observing the direction that the fringes move when the reference surface is pushed.|$|E

25|$|While Clark and his {{officers}} drilled {{the troops in}} preparation for the Kaskaskia expedition, the families who had traveled with the regiment down the Ohio River settled on the island and planted a corn crop. These settlers moved to the mainland the following year, founding the settlement which became Louisville. While on the island, Clark received an important message from Pittsburgh: France had signed a Treaty of Alliance with the United States.

President Bush's then-Attorney General, John Ashcroft denied that private residences <b>would</b> <b>be</b> surveilled by private citizens operating as government spies. Mr. Ashcroft nonetheless defended the program, equivocating on whether the reports by citizens on fellow citizens <b>would</b> <b>be</b> maintained in government databases. While saying that the <b>information</b> <b>would</b> not <b>be</b> in a central database as part of Operation TIPS, he maintained that the <b>information</b> <b>would</b> still <b>be</b> kept in databases by various law enforcement agencies.|$|R
25|$|On August 19, 2013, it was {{reported}} that all 20 of the men supposed to be behind the Nanga Parbat attack had been arrested. The series of arrests were started by an army operation earlier in the week and ended with a targeted police operation in the suspected hideouts of these militants. According to the newly instated SP of Diamer district, Muhammad Navid, the arrested militants were also responsible for the February 2012 Kohistan Shia Massacre, in which 18 Shi'ite Muslims were killed. Navid further said that intelligence agencies played a pivotal role in the arrests and that further <b>information</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> released in a couple of days.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, the Army {{had been}} very {{impressed}} {{with the performance of}} the 25cm experimental sets and became interested in using it as a range finder in a Gun Laying radar. Operators would point the radar at targets indicated to them by search radars, and from then on the radar <b>information</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> fed to the analogue computers that aimed the guns. Power was not a serious concern in this case as the range would be relatively short. The Air Defence Experimental Establishment (ADEE) of the Army was working on this using the klystron design from Birmingham and British Thomson-Houston (BTH) as their industrial partner.|$|E
25|$|In case (a), {{which is}} an {{exothermic}} reaction, {{the energy of the}} transition state is closer in energy to that of the reactant than that of the intermediate or the product. Therefore, from the postulate, the structure of the transition state also more closely resembles that of the reactant. In case (b), the energy of the transition state is close to neither the reactant nor the product, making none of them a good structural model for the transition state. Further <b>information</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> needed in order to predict the structure or characteristics of the transition state.

25|$|In recent years, Sacred Harp singing has {{experienced}} a resurgence in popularity, as it is discovered by new participants who did not {{grow up in the}} tradition. New singers typically strive to follow the original southern customs at their singings. Traditional singers have responded to this need by providing help in orienting the newcomers. For instance, the Rudiments section of the 1991 Denson edition includes information on how to hold a singing; this <b>information</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> superfluous in a traditional context, but is important for a group starting up on its own. The tradition of the singing master is still carried on today, and singing masters from traditional Sacred Harp regions often travel outside the South to teach. In recent years an annual summer camp has been established, at which newcomers can learn to sing Sacred Harp.|$|E
25|$|Hayes {{moved to}} Sausalito, California in 2000. He became {{the public face}} of the duo, doing most of the media. Hayes {{announced}} that Savage Garden had broken up in October 2001 during a chat with an Australian journalist. Hayes thought the <b>information</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> saved for a later article; it was not. When confronted with this information during the early morning hours, before an unrelated interview, Jones denied the break-up of the band. However, it appears that Jones did not believe the reporter was accurately quoting Hayes and denied what he thought was yet another breakup rumour. Still, the fact that Jones took a back seat in all promotional activities for Affirmation seems indicative that Jones was not content to remain within Savage Garden as it had operated in the past. Savage Garden had sold over 23 million albums by that stage.|$|E

500|$|The {{only source}} {{contemporary}} to Sappho that might provide any biographical <b>information</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> Sappho’s own poetry, but scholars are cautious of reading poetry in that way. The other ancient sources on Sappho {{are known as}} the [...] "testimonia", a term {{used to refer to}} biographical and literary references to Sappho that have been discovered and collected from other classical authors. The testimonia do not date from Sappho's lifetime; but they were written by those who had access to more of Sappho's poetry than modern readers do. The testimonia are a valuable source on how Sappho's poetry was received in antiquity, {{but it is difficult to}} assess how accurate their representation of Sappho's life is. Inferences made by ancient scholars and reported in the testimonia are in many cases known to be wrong. Nonetheless, some details mentioned in the testimonia may be derived from Sappho's own poetry, and may therefore possess some historical value.|$|E
500|$|This {{incident}} {{confirms the}} Centre's suspicions that the paratroopers were agents {{of a foreign}} power, but Tintin fears that efforts to trace any leaked <b>information</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> futile. The rocket is successfully launched and orbits the moon as planned, but on its return it is then intercepted by the aforementioned foreign power, who have used the leaked information concerning the rocket's radio control. However, Tintin had anticipated this and asked Calculus to rig a self-destruct mechanism for the rocket, and the Centre destroys the rocket {{to prevent it from}} falling into enemy hands. Tintin reasons that there must have been an inside spy who leaked information to the paratroopers, but no suspects are found. Preparations are made for the manned expedition to the moon, but after an argument with Haddock, in which Haddock accuses Calculus of [...] "acting the goat", Calculus becomes irate. Usually misunderstanding everything Haddock says, due to being hard of hearing, Calculus was wearing a hearing aid this time, and understood Haddock all too well. Implacable, Calculus angrily gives Haddock a forced tour of the moon rocket. However, in doing so, Calculus forgets to look where he is going, falls down a ladder and suffers amnesia.|$|E

500|$|Using two {{digital video}} (DV) cameras, Bartley and ÓBriain shot over 200 hours of {{material}} on 300 DV tapes. They intended that editing take ten weeks; instead, it took six months. Rod Stoneman, BSÉ's CEO at the time, described {{the amount of}} footage compared to the film's final length as [...] "exceptional". The 200:1 ratio was far above the norm for most documentaries, which usually have a ratio of 10:1 or 15:1. When the filmmakers returned to Ireland, they decided they needed an editor who spoke Spanish. Bartley remembered a documentary she had seen about baseball in Cuba, El juego de Cuba, so they hired its editor, Ángel Hernández Zoido. Zoido approached the film {{as if it were}} entertainment, feeling that the primary concern was to ensure the audience did not get bored. He tackled each scene the same way. After watching the rushes with Bartley and ÓBriain, Zoido asked them, [...] "What do we want to tell in this scene?" [...] He focused on two factors: how much <b>information</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> necessary to drive the plot, and provide an emotional core. Preferring to work alone, Zoido would then send the filmmakers from the edit suite. After Zoido completed the scene, the trio discussed whether those aims had been realized.|$|E
500|$|Contact with {{extraterrestrial}} intelligence {{would not be}} completely inconsequential for religion. The Peters study showed that most non-religious people, and a significant majority of religious people, believe that the world could face a religious crisis, even if their own beliefs were unaffected. Contact with {{extraterrestrial intelligence}} would be most likely to cause a problem for western religions, in particular traditionalist Christianity, because of the geocentric nature of western faiths. The discovery of extraterrestrial life would not contradict basic conceptions of God, however, and seeing that science has challenged established dogma in the past, for example with the theory of evolution, {{it is likely that}} existing religions will adapt similarly to the new circumstances. Douglas Vakoch argues that it is not likely that the discovery of extraterrestrial life will impact religious beliefs. In the view of Musso, a global religious crisis would be unlikely even for Abrahamic faiths, as the studies of himself and others on Christianity, the most [...] "anthropocentric" [...] religion, see no conflict between that religion and the existence of extraterrestrial intelligence. In addition, the cultural and religious values of extraterrestrial species would likely be shared over centuries if contact is to occur by radio, meaning that rather than causing a huge shock to humanity, such <b>information</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> viewed much as archaeologists and historians view ancient artifacts and texts.|$|E
