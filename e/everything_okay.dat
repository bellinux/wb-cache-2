6000|$|Now {{comes the}} serious part, for it {{happened}} here, and Fred has just gone. He {{has been so}} kind and jolly that we all got quite fond of him. I never thought of anything but a traveling friendship till the serenade night. Since then I've begun {{to feel that the}} moonlight walks, balcony talks, and daily adventures were something more to him than fun. I haven't flirted, Mother, truly, but remembered what you said to me, and have done my very best. I can't help it if people like me. I don't try to make them, and it worries me if I don't care for them, though Jo says I haven't got any heart. Now I know Mother will shake her head, and the girls say, [...] "Oh, the mercenary little wretch!", but I've made up my mind, and if Fred asks me, I shall accept him, though I'm not madly in love. I like him, and we get on comfortably together. He is handsome, young, clever enough, and very rich--ever so much richer than the Laurences. I don't think his family would object, and I should be very happy, for they are all kind, well-bred, generous people, and they like me. Fred, as the eldest twin, will have the estate, I suppose, and such a splendid one it is! A city house in a fashionable street, not so showy as our big houses, but twice as comfortable and full of solid luxury, such as English people believe in. I like it, for it's genuine. I've seen the plate, the family jewels, the old servants, and pictures of the country place, with its park, great house, lovely grounds, and fine horses. Oh, it would be all I should ask! And I'd rather have it than any title such as girls snap up so readily, and find nothing behind. I may be mercenary, but I hate poverty, and don't mean to bear it a minute longer than I can help. One of us must marry well. Meg didn't, Jo won't, Beth can't yet, so I shall, and make <b>everything</b> <b>okay</b> all round. I wouldn't marry a man I hated or despised. You may be sure of that, and though Fred is not my model hero, he does very well, and in time I should get fond enough of him if he was very fond of me, and let me do just as I liked. So I've been turning the matter over in my mind the last week, for it was impossible to help seeing that Fred liked me. He said nothing, but little things showed it. He never goes with Flo, always gets on my side of the carriage, table, or promenade, looks sentimental when we are alone, and frowns at anyone else who ventures to speak to me. Yesterday at dinner, when an Austrian officer stared at us and then said something to his friend, a rakish-looking baron, about 'ein wonderschones Blondchen', Fred looked as fierce as a lion, and cut his meat so savagely it nearly flew off his plate. He isn't one of the cool, stiff Englishmen, but is rather peppery, for he has Scotch blood in him, as one might guess from his bonnie blue eyes.|$|E

Remember I told you he had a swollen leg? Well, it seemed as though it was causing him pain. He seemed so miserable, and so I gave him half of a regularstrength Tylenol®. He just doesn’t seem right, ” Michelle blurted out. “I saw a news item a month or so ago that said that Tylenol ® wasn’t very safe—something about it not being good for the liver. I remember they said it was bad for humans in high doses. I don’t think they mentioned anything about animals. But don’t worry, ” Michelle’s mother reassured her. “Cats are very tough—they have nine lives, you know. And besides, you only gave him half a tablet. ” “Thanks, Mom. I better go now. Talk to you later, ” Michelle hurried off. The conversation with her mother had made Michelle uneasy. Tabby seemed very sad, tired, and out of breath. Michelle decided that she would search the Internet for information about acetaminophen, the active ingredient of Tylenol®. In particular, she wanted to know the safe dose for cats.
