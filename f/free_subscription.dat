The next year, the number of <b>free</b> <b>subscriptions</b> created, independent of paid subscriptions, was stated as one million. The income from the program—which had generated $1,000,000 by its second year—supplements revenue from paid accounts.|$|R
25|$|PlayStation Plus (commonly {{abbreviated}} PS+ {{and occasionally}} {{referred to as}} PSN Plus) is a premium PlayStation Network subscription service that was officially unveiled at E3 2010 by Jack Tretton, President and CEO of SCEA. Rumors of such service had been in speculation since Kaz Hirai's announcement at TGS 2009 of a possible paid service for PSN but with the current PSN service still available. Launched alongside PS3 firmware 3.40 and PSP firmware 6.30 on June 29, 2010, the paid-for subscription service provides users with enhanced services on the PlayStation Network, {{on top of the}} current PSN service which is still available with all of its features. These enhancements include the ability to have demos and game updates download automatically to PlayStation 3. Subscribers also get early or exclusive access to some betas, game demos, premium downloadable content and other PlayStation Store items. North American users also get a <b>free</b> <b>subscription</b> to Qore. Users may choose to purchase either a one-year or a three-month subscription to PlayStation Plus.|$|E
25|$|Poetry {{submissions}} began almost immediately, as did {{short story}} submissions with lesbian themes. Book reviews of current paperbacks were regular features, including a heated exchange in print between contributors to The Ladder and author Marijane Meaker as Ann Aldrich from 1957 to 1963. Meaker {{had written the}} immensely successful Spring Fire in 1952 under the name Vin Packer and was known to the Daughters of Bilitis. Meaker's books We Walk Alone from 1955 and We, Too, Must Love from 1958 were her version of Donald Webster Cory's The Homosexual in America, a nonfiction account published in 1951 {{about what it was}} like to live as a gay man in the US. Meaker's books, published by Gold Medal Books, were distributed all over the US, and gave people in remote places an idea of what it was like to live as a lesbian. The books, however, were not particularly sympathetic to lesbians, and Del Martin and Barbara Grier took issue with Meaker's portrayals. They began to criticize the books in The Ladder and suggest that Meaker was expressing self-hatred in the books. Del Martin wrote to Meaker personally in 1958, giving her a <b>free</b> <b>subscription</b> to the magazine. Meaker's reach to women was much broader through the distribution of her books, and she received so much mail from women asking for resources and support that she was unable to respond to all of it, so she referred the letter writers to the Daughters of Bilitis. However, in print, Meaker responded to the open letters to her in The Ladder in her next book Carol in a Thousand Cities in 1960, by skewering the magazine's amateurish homemade appearance, fiction and poetry she did not appreciate, and the ideas presented in the magazine. Again, The Ladder responded, once more calling Meaker's loyalties into question. However negative Carol in a Thousand Cities was to The Ladder, it was major advertising for the DOB and letters poured in for them from all over the U.S.|$|E
500|$|Other {{facets of}} Quorum are parental {{controls}} and spam filtering. Norton Internet Security 2010 bundles a <b>free</b> <b>subscription</b> of OnlineFamily.Norton, which PC Magazine {{found to be}} an improvement over the parental controls bundled with prior releases. Spam filtering uses technologies Symantec acquired from Brightmail. Two filters are used to find spam: a locally installed one and a check against Symantec's servers {{to see if the}} message is known spam. In PC Magazine testing, no valid e-mail were marked as spam. However, 11 percent of spam still made it to the inbox. [...] This was a significant improvement over prior releases. Another improvement to the product is the improved heuristic feature called SONAR 2. [...] It leverages reputation data to judge if a program is malicious or clean. Norton Insight has also been expanded, showing users the number of Norton Community participants who have a certain program installed, its impact of system resources, and how long it has been released. Information about the program's origin and a graph of its resource usage is also provided. A new feature codenamed [...] "Autospy" [...] helps users understand what Norton did when malware was found. The malware's actions and Norton's resolution are presented to the user. Previous releases removed threats on sight and quietly warned users, potentially confusing when users are deceived in downloading rogue security software.|$|E

500|$|In June 2003, Gravel gave {{a speech}} on direct {{democracy}} at a conference hosted by the American Free Press. The event was cosponsored by the Barnes Review, a journal that endorses Holocaust denial. In the wake of criticism for his appearance, Gravel has said repeatedly {{that he does not}} share such a view, stating, [...] "You better believe I know that six million Jews were killed. I've been to the Holocaust Museum. I've seen the footage of General Eisenhower touring one of the camps. They're [...] nutty as loons if they don't think it happened". The newspaper had intended to interview Gravel about the National Initiative. Gravel later recounted the background to the event:"He [...] liked the idea of the National Initiative. I figured it was an opportunity to discuss it. Whether it is the far right, far left, whatever, I'll make my pitch to them. They gave me a <b>free</b> <b>subscription</b> to American Free Press. They still send it to me today. I flip through it sometimes. It has some extreme views, {{and a lot of the}} ads in it are even more extreme and make me want to upchuck. Anyways, sometime later, Carto contacted me to speak at that Barnes Review Conference. I had never heard of the Barnes Review, didn't know anything about it or what they stood for. I was just coming to give a presentation about the National Initiative. I was there maybe 30 minutes. I could tell from the people in the room (mainly some very old men) that they were pretty extreme. I gave my speech, answered some questions and left. I never saw the agenda for the day or listened to any of the other presentations." ...|$|E

2500|$|In a study {{published}} on April 18, 2007, by Yale professors Alan Gerber, Dean Karlan, and Daniel Bergan, citizens were given a subscription to either the conservative-leaning Washington Times or the liberal-leaning Washington Post to see the effect that media has on voting patterns. Gerber had estimated based on his work that the Post slanted {{as much to the}} left as the Times did to the right. Gerber found those who were given a <b>free</b> <b>subscription</b> of the Post were 7.9–11.4% more likely to vote for the Democratic candidate for governor than those assigned to the control group, depending on the adjustment for the date on which individual participants were surveyed and the survey interviewer; surprisingly, however, people who received the Times were also more likely than controls to vote for the Democrat, with an effect approximately 60% as large as that estimated for the Post. The study authors noted that sampling error might {{have played a role in}} the effect of the conservative-leaning Times, as might the fact that the Democratic candidate took more conservative-leaning positions than is typical for his party, and that [...] "the month prior to the post-election survey was a difficult period for President Bush, one in which his overall approval rating fell by approximately 4 percentage points nationwide. It appears that heightened exposure to both papers’ news coverage, despite opposing ideological slants, moved public opinion away from Republicans." ...|$|E
