500|$|Levine's {{popularity}} {{outside of}} his musical work has seen him tagged as a [...] "stand-alone star," [...] which critics say have pushed other members of Maroon 5 to the backseat, even in their music. Their guitarist Valentine noted that his vocals were a central aspect around which their music revolved. Conversely, others opine that Levine's fame has been a boost to the band, with Paper writing: [...] "Maroon 5 has managed to ebb and flow with the times ... thanks {{in no small part}} to their frontman's uncanny ability to be extremely entertaining". Delta Sky described him as [...] "a natural, if slightly neurotic, leading man". He claims that the image was consciously cultivated, explaining: [...] "We talked about it {{a long time ago and}} <b>decided</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> step out, for us, not for me or my own ego ... We wanted there to be a frontman." ...|$|E
500|$|Several {{songs from}} the band's third album, Vitalogy, were premiered during this tour. The band's April 3, 1994 concert in Atlanta, Georgia at the Fox Theatre was {{broadcast}} live on the radio in the United States. A few days later, the body of Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain was found in his home in Seattle due to an apparent suicide, which deeply affected Vedder. At the band's April 8, 1994 concert in Fairfax, Virginia at the Patriot Center, Vedder proclaimed, [...] "I don't {{think any of us}} would be in this room tonight if it weren't for Kurt Cobain." [...] Vedder later said that [...] "the day that we found out about Kurt... I was just spinning. I was lost and didn't know if we should play, or if we should just go home, or if we should attend the services. I still have some regrets about that, even though {{in the end it was}} probably better that we played the last two weeks of the tour. I <b>decided</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> play those next two weeks and then I'd never have to play again." ...|$|E
500|$|Cisneros {{was awarded}} a {{bachelor}} of arts degree from Loyola University Chicago in 1976, and received a master of fine arts degree from the Iowa Writers' Workshop at the University of Iowa in 1978. [...] It was while attending the Workshop that Cisneros discovered how the particular social position she occupied gave her writing a unique potential. She recalls being suddenly struck by the differences {{between her and her}} classmates: [...] "It wasn't as if I didn't know who I was. I knew I was a Mexican woman. But I didn't think it {{had anything to do with}} why I felt so much imbalance in my life, whereas it had everything to do with it! My race, my gender, and my class! And it didn't make sense until that moment, sitting in that seminar. That's when I <b>decided</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> write about something my classmates couldn't write about." [...] She cast aside her attempt to conform to American literary canons and adopted a writing style that was purposely opposite that of her classmates, realizing that instead of being something to be ashamed of, her own cultural environment was a source of inspiration. From then on, she would write of her [...] "neighbors, the people [...] saw, the poverty that the women had gone through." ...|$|E
60|$|After a {{considerable}} {{pause in the}} conversation Walkirk inquired if <b>I</b> had <b>decided</b> where <b>I</b> <b>would</b> go.|$|R
6000|$|... "I do {{not doubt}} {{it in the}} least, Pathfinder; and, did it rest with me to <b>decide,</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> sooner follow you to some cabin in the woods, and share your fortune, whether {{it might be better}} or worse, than go inside the door of any officer I know, with an {{intention}} of remaining there as its master's wife." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{probably}} an unusual course under the circumstances, but before <b>I</b> <b>decide</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> {{like to ask}} a question," [...] he said. [...] "We will suppose that you or one of your agents had sold {{a man who did}} not know what he was buying a tract of worthless land, and he demanded compensation. What would you do?" ...|$|R
2500|$|Tendulkar's {{allegations}} {{were supported by}} former teammates such as Zaheer Khan, Harbhajan Singh and V. V. S. Laxman. Zaheer called Chappell a [...] "control freak" [...] and said, [...] "After he was appointed {{the coach of the}} Indian team, he once came upto me and told [...] "Zaheer, you will not be playing for India till I remain the coach". He also added that the two-year term under Chappell was [...] "easily the worst and darkest phase" [...] that he could remember. Harbhajan said, [...] "Chappell destroyed Indian cricket {{to such an extent that}} it required at least 3 years to again get back on track. The worst part was some players in that team, who sucked upto the coach and would supply selective misinformation creating bigger rifts". He also talked about the email leak, [...] "Sourav was batting out there in the middle and this man was typing a critical e-mail against Sourav, sitting right there in that dressing room. He had no interest in the proceedings of the match. There were seven guys that he wanted to get rid of. Sourav was his primary target followed by myself, Virender Sehwag, Ashish Nehra, Zaheer Khan and Yuvraj Singh". Laxman was also critical of Chappell in saying that Chappell took Indian cricket [...] "backwards" [...] during his coaching tenure. Laxman also recalled an incident from 2006, [...] "This happened in 2006 at the Wankhede Stadium when India played versus England. Yuvraj Singh was picked ahead of me. We were going to the West Indies for a four-Test series after that and he asked me if I would open. I mentioned in 2000 I had <b>decided</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not open anymore after it didn't work for me in the first four years. I was consistent in the middle order since 2000. Chappell asked me my age and said - Don't you think 31 is too young an age to sit at home? I was astonished to hear this. I had a very good run under him. I was the second highest run scorer under him." ...|$|E
60|$|As I {{passed on}} I <b>decided</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> scrape {{acquaintance}} with this restaurant keeper.|$|E
6000|$|... "Honestly? Claire dear, do {{you know}} why I came on this trip? In Schoenstrom, I heard you say you were going to Seattle. That moment, I <b>decided</b> <b>I</b> <b>would,</b> too, and get acquainted with you, if murder would do it. But, oh, I'm clumsy." ...|$|E
60|$|Lawrence {{would say}} no more, so <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> descend from my high horse, and once more seek out Poirot at Leastways Cottage.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{was very}} tired, too, after the excitements of the day; so <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not face it, but would pass the night upon the open hill.|$|R
6000|$|Lord Godalming and I were silent, but Dr. Van Helsing added, [...] "Friend John, {{you know}} more lunatics than I do, and I'm glad of it, for I fear that {{if it had been}} to me to <b>decide</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> before that last hysterical {{outburst}} have given him free. But we live and learn, and in our present task we must take no chance, as my friend Quincey would say. All is best as they are." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{was awake}} longest that night. My cousins slept, the sleep of faith {{on either side}} of me. I <b>decided</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> whisper my prayers, and stopped midway because I was ashamed, and perhaps also because I had an idea one didn't square God like that.|$|E
6000|$|... "After {{the crows}} had gone I thought this over, and <b>decided</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> try {{hard to get}} some brains. By good luck you came along and pulled me off the stake, and from what you say I am sure the Great Oz will give me brains {{as soon as we}} get to the Emerald City." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Cecilia {{was very}} anxious {{to go to the}} picnic today to see an old friend of hers," [...] she answered. [...] "She was willing to come here, but you know, Grandmother, that Cecilia is always willing to do the things {{somebody}} else ought to do, so I <b>decided</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> stand on my rights as 'Miss Newbury' for once and come to the Bay Shore." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mavering nodded. [...] "He's {{given me}} {{three weeks to}} <b>decide</b> whether <b>I</b> <b>would</b> {{like to do that}} or go in for law. That's what I came up here for." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I then said, 'Well, we are {{not only}} going to demand for the {{position}} of a commissioner, {{we are going to take}} away his seat'. And <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> contest the governor's seat in the next election".|$|R
5000|$|... "At that point, <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> use {{whatever}} resources I had {{to restore the}} plantation. It became my passion. I loved what I saw - it was different, it was unique and I became totally involved in bringing it back to life." ...|$|R
60|$|At {{the end of}} June {{the weather}} became fine again. Hay harvest was to begin {{as soon as it}} settled. There were only two fields to be mown this year, to provide just enough stuff to last until the spring. As my {{vacation}} had begun I <b>decided</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> help, and that we three, the father, George and I, would get in the hay without hired assistance.|$|E
6000|$|... "Almost, mamselle, but not quite. It {{was this}} way: I knew if I {{permitted}} her {{to follow me}} she would finally succeed in her quest, for she and the dear children have six eyes among them, while I have but two; so I reposed within an ash-barrel until they had passed on, and then I followed them, keeping well out of their sight. In that way I managed to escape. But it proved a hard task, for my Clarette is very persistent, {{as you may have}} noticed. So I <b>decided</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> be more safe upon the ship than upon the shore. She is not likely to seek me here, and in any event she floats better than she swims." ...|$|E
60|$|Then I tried my best {{to catch}} cold and really be sick by {{standing}} on the snowbank in the Methodist graveyard with my bare feet until Jerry pulled me off. But it didn't hurt me a bit and so I couldn't get out of going to church. So I just <b>decided</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> put my boots on and go that way. I can't see {{why it was so}} wrong and I was so careful to wash my legs just as clean as my face, but, anyway, father wasn't to blame for it. He was in the study thinking of his sermon and other heavenly things, and I kept out of his way before I went to Sunday School. Father does not look at people's legs in church, so of course he did not notice mine, but all the gossips did and talked about it, and that is why I am writing this letter to the Journal to explain. I suppose I did very wrong, since everybody says so, and I am sorry and I am wearing those awful stockings to punish myself, although father bought me two nice new black pairs as soon as Mr. Flagg's store opened on Monday morning. But it was all my fault, and if people blame father for it after they read this they are not Christians and so I do not mind what they say.|$|E
60|$|After lunch, <b>I</b> <b>decided,</b> <b>would</b> be {{time enough}} to begin active campaigning.|$|R
6000|$|... "Excuse me, gentlemen," [...] {{my uncle}} answered. [...] "I shall {{be happy to}} give you any {{information}} in my power a little later. I have {{a matter of some}} slight importance to <b>decide.</b> Belcher, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have a word with you!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Just what I thought. But <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> {{that first}} <b>I</b> <b>would</b> {{listen to what}} the two men had to say. When I got closer to the pair I made another discovery.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have written}} this letter over three times, and torn {{each of them}} up. I do so want to say all this, and it is so desperately hard to say. I am full of fears that you despise me. I {{know there is a}} sort of high colour about me. My passion for brightness. I am absurd. But inside of me is a soul, a real, living, {{breathing}} soul. Crying out to you: 'Oh, let me help! Let me help!' I will do anything, I will endure anything if only I can keep hold of the vision splendid you gave me in the cathedral. I see it now day and night, the dream of the place I can make for you--and you preaching! My fingers itch to begin. The day before yesterday I said to myself, 'I am quite unworthy, I am a worldly woman, a rich, smart, decorated woman. He will never accept me as I am.' I took off all my jewels, every one, I looked through all my clothes, and at last I <b>decided</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have made for me a very simple straight grey dress, just simple and straight and grey. Perhaps you will think that too is absurd of me, too self-conscious. I would not tell of it to you if I did not want you to understand how alive I am to my utter impossibilities, how resolved I am to do anything so that I may be able to serve. But never mind about silly me; {{let me tell you how}} I see the new church.|$|E
6000|$|... "Another house I {{travelled}} {{down into}} Dorsetshire to see. It contained, {{according to the}} advertisement, 'perhaps the most perfect specimen of Norman arch extant in Southern England.' It was to be found mentioned in Dugdale, and dated from the thirteenth century. I don't quite know what I expected. I argued to myself that {{there must have been}} ruffians of only moderate means even in those days. Here and there some robber baron who had struck a poor line of country would have had to be content with a homely little castle. A few such, hidden away in unfrequented districts, had escaped destruction. More civilised descendants had adapted them to later requirements. I had in my mind, before the train reached Dorchester, something between a miniature Tower of London and a mediaeval edition of Ann Hathaway's cottage at Stratford. I pictured dungeons and a drawbridge, perhaps a secret passage. Lamchick has a secret passage, leading from behind a sort of portrait in the dining-room {{to the back of the}} kitchen chimney. They use it for a linen closet. It seems to me a pity. Of course originally it went on farther. The vicar, who is a bit of an antiquarian, believes it comes out somewhere in the churchyard. I tell Lamchick he ought to have it opened up, but his wife doesn't want it touched. She seems to think it just right as it is. I have always had a fancy for a secret passage. I <b>decided</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have the drawbridge repaired and made practicable. Flanked on each side with flowers in tubs, it would have been a novel and picturesque approach." ...|$|E
5000|$|Lesser {{retired in}} 1958. [...] "I {{had reached the}} age that one either {{finishes}} on top or far below. I <b>decided</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> end on top, and I was satisfied," [...] he said.|$|E
60|$|I pondered for a moment, {{looked at}} my diary, and saw that Aunt Emma was coming to spend Saturday to Wednesday next with us, {{calculated}} that if I went I should miss her, and might not see her again for years, and <b>decided</b> that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> go.|$|R
6000|$|... "Never mind. I {{was young}} then, and I kissed them. I {{wondered}} how I {{could make the}} most of my trouvaille, and <b>decided</b> that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> call at your hotel with them that afternoon. It rained, and I waited till next day. I called, and you were gone." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "It was a {{beautiful}} day when the scales fell from my eyes and I first encountered photographic sovereignty. A beautiful day when <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> take responsibility to reinterpret images of Native peoples. My mind was ready, primed with stories of resistance and resilience, stories of survival. My views of these images are aboriginally based - an indigenous perspective - not a scientific godly order but philosophically Native." ...|$|R
5000|$|Describing her experience, Ramírez said, [...] "I couldn’t {{stand the}} pain anymore. If my baby {{was going to}} die, then I <b>decided</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have to die, too. But {{if he was going}} to grow up, I was going to see him grow up, and I was going to be with my child. I thought that God would save both our lives." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Well, {{there was}} a guy the name of Dr. John, a hoodoo guy in New Orleans. He was {{competition}} to Marie Laveau. He was like her opposite. I actually got a clipping ... about how my great-great-great-grandpa Wayne was busted with this guy for runnin' a voodoo operation in a whorehouse in 1860. I <b>decided</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> produce the record with this as a concept." ...|$|E
5000|$|McFadden said of {{the album}} in an {{interview}} with his official website: [...] "This album is something I have wanted to do for a long time. Ireland has produced some of the greatest songs in history and I <b>decided</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> put my own twist on a collection of my favourite ever Irish songs by returning to my heritage, and showcasing my voice at its very best." ...|$|E
5000|$|Prior to signing for Leicester, Fuchs had {{an offer}} {{to play in the}} United States, where his family live, but he turned it down for {{financial}} reasons. He said in March 2016 [...] "My intention is to play in the US. I have come Leicester for three years. <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> sign one last contract in Europe, when I left Schalke, then go to the US." ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>I</b> <b>decided</b> that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> {{become an}} {{architect}} because it sounded so prestigious and so easy. Especially easy. I went {{to what was}} then Carnegie Tech in Pittsburgh and quickly discovered {{that if you were}} going to be an architect you at least had to learn how to draw. But I couldn't even do that. The only passing grade I got was in English, so <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> that about the only thing I could do was to become a newspaperman." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “You are right, Donna Inez,” Stephen said gravely. “For myself I {{should be}} ready to run the risk of getting through to the south, but what you have said <b>decides</b> me. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> die rather than say a word that could betray you and your cousin. But no one can say what one would do under fiendish tortures; {{therefore}} I at once accept your plan.” ...|$|R
