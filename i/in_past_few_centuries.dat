40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the {{introduction}} of new trends to the work with seniors in residential facilities services. The status of elderly people has dramatically changed over the past hundred years due to the political and cultural changes in the society and there is a risk of social exclusion of this group of people because of their advanced age, loss of competence and capabilities. The theoretical part describes the changes in care for elderly people <b>in</b> <b>past</b> <b>few</b> <b>centuries</b> not only in the Czech Republic but also in other European countries and also those changes that occurred in recent years. The practical part determines how these changes are accepted by people in age group from 65 to 90 years living in a retirement home in a small village in the highlands, far away from their families, infrastructure, and the rush of life. The aim of the bachelor thesis is to assess the effectiveness of the new trends in working with seniors in this type of institution in relation to the improvement of the quality of their life...|$|E

50|$|<b>In</b> the <b>past</b> <b>few</b> <b>centuries,</b> some {{statistical}} {{methods have been}} developed, for reasoning {{in the face of}} uncertainty, as an outgrowth of methods for eliminating error.

This has been called belief revision, or defeasible reasoning: the models in play during the phases of scientific method can be reviewed, revisited and revised, in the light of further evidence. This arose from the work of Frank P. Ramsey(1903-1930), of John Maynard Keynes(1883-1946), and earlier, of William Stanley Jevons (1835-1882) in economics.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The Tropical Forest of Southeast Brazil is {{presently}} highly degraded as consequence of intense land cover change {{that took place}} <b>in</b> the <b>past</b> <b>few</b> <b>centuries.</b> Most of its cover is now reduced to sparsely distributed forest fragments which implies in {{serious threat to the}} existence of plant and wildlife populations that depend on this habitat. In order to alleviate such threat the connectivity among these isolated forest patches should be increased by the restoration of the natural vegetation in areas between patches. The Brazilian Forest Protection Act (FPA) was created in 1965 as a legal apparatus to protect natural vegetation cover and to reduce the impact of deforestation in water availability and quality. However the proper observation of the criteria for land cover protection stated in the FPA can also improve connectivity of the vegetation cover. This work presents an example of the usefulness of the FPA in improving the connectivity of forest cover between two large Conservation Units (The Itatiaia National Park and the Campos do Jordao State Forest) with the application of remote sensing techniques for the diagnosis of the present status of the spatial distribution of the vegetation cover and the use of geographic information system for the determination of areas under the protection of the FPA.

The ordinary incantations connected with everyday life in agrarian society were recited with little ceremony, in a mumble, a whisper. Finnish researchers of folk belief have described the incantation as a genre characterised by spoken delivery and a verbatim adherence to a traditional scheme. The European incantations noted down <b>in</b> the <b>past</b> <b>few</b> <b>centuries</b> are indeed formulae with a seemingly mechanical effect. The performer aims not at personal contact with the other world or an opponent, but believes rather that he will achieve his goal through his command of secret knowledge and magic techniques. Anyone is capable of reciting an incantation, and the mode of delivery is of no vital significance. This description, however, only partially corresponds to {{the essence of the}} Finnish incantation tradition. The incantations of Eastern Finland differ from those of the western tradition in their breadth and wordiness. They have also been characterised by a wealth of variation. These characteristics are reinforced by the tietäjä institution which persisted late in the area. From what we know of the tietäjä's behaviour, the incantation uttered in a normal speaking voice is a late phenomenon.
