5|$|The main {{criticism}} levelled at the EIHL is {{that the}} league <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>expensive,</b> an accusation given credence {{by the collapse of}} the London Racers mid season in 2005, and the continued financial problems experienced by a number of other member clubs (most notably Basingstoke Bison and Manchester Phoenix in 2008â€“09). Both the Edinburgh Capitals and Newcastle Vipers made public statements about their potentially perilous financial situations, casting further doubt over both their own, and the league's sustained viability.|$|E
5|$|With condo prices {{set from}} US$500,000 to US$2,000,000, many critics {{have noted that}} the One Rincon Hill complex <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>expensive</b> for most San Franciscans. With the total initial {{development}} cost of US$290 million, the average development cost per unit with 709 units total is approximately US$409,000. However, the developer Urban West Associates has contributed a total of US$38.5 million to funds like the South of Market Community Stabilization Fund {{in order to address}} this concern.|$|E
25|$|X-rays and {{computerized}} tomography (CT) are not used, {{especially in the}} first trimester, due to the ionizing radiation, which has teratogenic effects on the foetus. No effects of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on the foetus have been demonstrated, but this technique <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>expensive</b> for routine observation. Instead, obstetric ultrasonography is the imaging method of choice in the first trimester and throughout the pregnancy, because it emits no radiation, is portable, and allows for realtime imaging.|$|E

25|$|The ensuing {{explosion}} and firestorm burned down 40 {{buildings in the}} town center and killed 47 people. The cleanup of the derailment area could take 5 years, and another 160 buildings {{may need to be}} demolished. Ironically, the oil was not Canadian bitumen being exported to the United States but Bakken formation light crude oil being imported into Canada from North Dakota to the Irving Oil Refinery in New Brunswick. Although near a huge oil import port on the Atlantic Ocean, the Irving refinery is importing US Bakken oil by rail because oil from outside North America <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>expensive</b> to be economic, and there are no pipelines to deliver heavier but cheaper Western Canadian oil to New Brunswick. It was subsequently pointed out that the Bakken light oil was much more flammable than Alberta bitumen, and the rail cars were mislabeled by the North Dakota producers as to their flammability.|$|E

It is also not a fast enough response to address climate change. Lowe advocates renewable energy which is [...] "quicker, less expensive and less dangerous than nuclear".|$|E

500|$|Ever {{since the}} Peace Candle was first erected, some Easton {{residents}} {{have been critical of}} the structure, arguing it is a tacky symbol of the over-commercialization of Christmas and not a tasteful way to convey a message of peace. Many have condemned the fact that the Peace Candle covers the Soldiers' & Sailors' Monument, which proponents see as a sign of disrespect toward veterans. Critics have also argued the candle <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>expensive</b> to maintain each year, and some have claimed the phallic shape of the symbol is inappropriate. In 1982, a petition was signed by 90 people and submitted to the Easton City Council seeking to discontinue the Peace Candle tradition, calling it a [...] "garish symbol of inner-city decadence". The group wanted to replace it with a decorative display of evergreen tree, in honor of Easton's claim to be the first city in the United States to observe that German custom. The city rejected the petition after conducting a survey of public opinion, which polled 29 city residents in favor of the Peace Candle and four against it.|$|E
500|$|The brittle ice zone {{typically}} returns poorer quality samples {{than for}} the rest of the core. [...] Some steps can be taken to alleviate the problem. [...] Liners can be placed inside the drill barrel to enclose the core before it is brought to the surface, but this makes it difficult to clean off the drilling fluid. [...] In mineral drilling, special machinery can bring core samples to the surface at bottom-hole pressure, but this <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>expensive</b> for the inaccessible locations of most drilling sites. [...] Keeping the processing facilities at very low temperatures limits thermal shocks. [...] Cores are most brittle at the surface, so another approach is to break them into 1m lengths in the hole. [...] Extruding the core from the drill barrel into a net helps keep it together if it shatters. Brittle cores are also often allowed to rest in storage at the drill site for some time, up to a full year between drilling seasons, to let the ice gradually relax.|$|E

[...] Rail enthusiasts have suggested commuter rail service could be started between York and Philadelphia with much of the necessary infrastructure already in place, using SEPTA's system.
