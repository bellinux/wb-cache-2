25|$|Frustration with {{shipping}} grain through eastern ports, Manitoba farmers {{lobbied for}} their own <b>grain</b> <b>port</b> on Hudson Bay which led {{the creation of the}} Hudson Bay Railway which was built in stages north from The Pas after a railway bridge was constructed over the Saskatchewan River in 1910-1911 by the Canadian Northern Railway (CNoR). After initial surveys considered both the ports of Churchill and Port Nelson, it was decided to proceed to Port Nelson in 1912. Construction began at Port Nelson and the new Canadian research ship CSS Acadia was sent to chart the port and shipping routes into the Bay. However harbour construction at Port Nelson ran into engineering and costs problems and was abandoned in World War I. Following the CNoR bankruptcy in 1918 and creation of Canadian National Railways (CNR), the federal government undertook to complete the Hudson Bay Railway; this time to Churchill. CSS Acadia was sent to survey for a port and railway construction resumed. Political and financing difficulties as well as engineering challenges due to the large amount of muskeg and frequent rock outcrops on the Canadian Shield delayed the completion of the railway and port but it was completed and opened to shipping in 1929.|$|E
25|$|Manufacturing, printing, {{publishing}} and food processing also play major {{roles in the}} city's economy. Several medical products and services companies are headquartered in the Chicago area, including Baxter International, Boeing, Abbott Laboratories, and the Healthcare division of General Electric. In addition to Boeing, which located its headquarters in Chicago in 2001, and United Airlines in 2011, GE Transportation moved its offices to the city in 2013 and GE Healthcare moved its HQ to the city in 2016, as did ThyssenKrupp North America, and agriculture giant Archer Daniels Midland. Moreover, {{the construction of the}} Illinois and Michigan Canal, which helped move goods from the Great Lakes south on the Mississippi River, and of the railroads in the 19th century made the city a major transportation center in the United States. In the 1840s, Chicago became a major <b>grain</b> <b>port,</b> and in the 1850s and 1860s Chicago's pork and beef industry expanded. As the major meat companies grew in Chicago many, such as Armour and Company, created global enterprises. Though the meatpacking industry currently plays a lesser role in the city's economy, Chicago continues to be a major transportation and distribution center. Lured by a combination of large business customers, federal research dollars, and a large hiring pool fed by the area's universities, Chicago is also the site {{of a growing number of}} web startup companies like CareerBuilder, Orbitz, 37signals, Groupon, Feedburner, and NowSecure.|$|E
2500|$|Buffalo, New York, the world's largest <b>grain</b> <b>port</b> {{from the}} 1850s {{until the first}} half of the 20th century, once had the nation's largest {{capacity}} for the storage of grain in over thirty concrete grain elevators located along the inner and outer harbors. While several are still in productive use, many of those that remain are presently idle. In a nascent trend, some of the city's inactive capacity has recently come back online, with an ethanol plant started in 2007 using one of the previously mothballed elevators to store corn. In the early 20th century, Buffalo's grain elevators inspired modernist architects such as Le Corbusier, who exclaimed, [...] "The first fruits of the new age!" [...] when he first saw them. Buffalo's grain elevators have been documented for the Historic American Engineering Record and added to the National Register of Historic Places. Currently, Enid, Oklahoma, holds the title of most grain storage capacity in the United States.|$|E

50|$|Grain Race or The Great Grain Race was the {{informal}} {{name for the}} annual windjammer sailing season generally from South Australia's <b>grain</b> <b>ports</b> on Spencer Gulf to Lizard Point, Cornwall on the southwesternmost coast of the United Kingdom, or to specific ports. A good, fast passage Australia-to-England via Cape Horn was considered anything under 100 days.|$|R
50|$|Although {{popular with}} farmers, these reduced rates were not {{cost-effective}} for the railway and provided central Canadian manufacturers and <b>grain</b> <b>ports</b> with an unfair advantage. By the early 1980s, the government attempted {{to resolve the}} problems between the competing interests by altering the agreement. The Western Grain Transportation Act of 1983 allowed shipping rates to increase, but never more than 10% of the world price for grain. In addition, further cash payments {{were made by the}} government to the CPR.|$|R

50|$|Scholars have {{identified}} {{the site of the}} Spartan fort as the site of Palaiokastro, now marked by the tombs of the Greek royal family, in the Tatoi national forest east of Mt. Parnitha (McCredie 1966). A substantial rubble circuit wall (about 2 m wide) has been traced, with Classical rooftiles and other evidence of occupation. This location fits the description of Thucydides (7.19) as midway between Athens and Boeotia, visible from Athens and commanding the plain of Attica. The site controls what was once a major ancient road, usable by carts, connecting Athens to the <b>grain</b> <b>port</b> of Oropos.|$|E
50|$|The first {{documented}} {{flood control}} project was drawn up in 1775, presumably by Matvey Kazakov (senior). In addition to separating Balchug Island from Zamoskvorechye, Kazakov also proposed cutting two flood control dikes west from Bersenevka. This would separate strips of floodland from the mainland, creating two more islands. In the east, Kazakov planned to flood uninhabited farmland permanently, and connect the Canal to the Moskva River inside the present-day Garden Ring. The {{eastern end of}} an island would become Moscow's fortified <b>grain</b> <b>port</b> and warehouse. The moat east of Balchug had to be cleared and widened, too.|$|E
5000|$|Windjammers {{were used}} commercially (though {{recognized}} as a fast disappearing breed) until the 1950s. They occupied a niche in the transport of low-value bulk cargoes of little interest to steamship companies, e.g., lumber, coal, guano or grain (60,000 sacks on Pamir). Cargoes were carried from remote ports, with fuel and water unavailable, such as Australia (carrying wool or grain), remote Pacific islands (guano) and South America (nitrates). The windjammers usually followed the clipper route around the world, ideally carrying different cargoes on each leg of their route, but most frequently sailing in ballast. The last leg from Australia to Europe, where the cargo was wheat or barley, became the source of The Great Grain Races as the ships' masters attempted to sail the leg as fast as possible, essentially only for prestige and pride [...] - [...] usually from the <b>grain</b> <b>ports</b> of South Australia’s Spencer Gulf to Lizard Point at the Cornwall coast {{and on to the}} harbour of destination in Britain or continental Europe.|$|R

Off-shore links to oil pipelines are used to transfer petroleum products to and from tanker ships operated by Pemex, Mexico's state-owned oil company. As part of the Pemex operations and infrastructure in the city, a facility on the river manufactures and maintains oil rigs for use in the Gulf of Mexico.|$|E
50|$|In 1783, Moscow {{was hit by}} a {{disastrous}} flood. As a consequence, the city cleared the old river bed, building a canal that separated Sadovniki from the mainland (see Vodootvodny Canal for details and maps of the 1780s canal). Large areas east of Tatarskaya streets were flooded with an intention of building a river harbour and a fortified <b>grain</b> <b>port</b> on the eastern tip of the new island. These plans did not materialize; flooded lands were reclaimed in the 1820s, and were used as pastures and gardens. Sadovniki fort was built on a different site, closer to city center, as the New Kriegskomissariat (1778-1780), a neoclassical castle housing military offices and depots. Since that time, military has continuous presence in Sadovniki East.|$|E
50|$|As the Port of Boston was a {{major source}} of {{supplies}} for the citizens of Massachusetts, sympathetic colonies as far away as South Carolina sent relief supplies to the settlers of Massachusetts Bay. So great was the response, that the Boston leaders boasted that the town would become the chief <b>grain</b> <b>port</b> of America if the act were not repealed. June 1 was widely observed as a day of fasting and prayer, bells being tolled, flags placed at half-mast, and houses draped in mourning. This was {{the first step in the}} unification of the thirteen colonies. These colonies finally had a cause for them to work together. The First Continental Congress was convened in Philadelphia on September 5, 1774, to coordinate a colonial response to the Port Act and the other Coercive Acts.|$|E
40|$|An aged {{lock and}} dam {{system on the}} upper Mississippi and Illinois Rivers and an {{anticipated}} increase in traffic has generated concern about the future navigational efficiency of these transport arteries. Greatest concern centers on locking capacity in the lower reaches of these Rivers where tows/vessels experience comparatively high levels of lock delay. A recently developed methodology, directed acyclic graphs, and multiple regression are used to identify and measure the effect of lock delay on grain barge rates. The study focuses on accumulated lock delay on segments of the upper Mississippi and Illinois River and grain barge rates that link sections of these Rivers to lower Mississippi River <b>grain</b> <b>ports.</b> In addition, analysis is carried out to determine if delay at individual locks {{has an impact on}} grain barge rates. Results show accumulated lock delay on segments of the upper Mississippi and Illinois Rivers increase grain barge rates, however, the estimated rate equations show the affect is not large.

40|$|The {{introduction}} of nonindigenous species into the Great Lakes has caused grave economic and ecological damages {{to the entire}} region. It is thought that a primary vector for release of threatening species arises from the ballast discharges of vessels originating from overseas ports, {{and to a lesser}} degree, vessels which originate from the North American seaboard. Of particular concern are those vessels entering fully loaded, with no ballast on board (NOBOB), which through normal operations mix and discharge Great Lakes freshwater with unpumpable residuals left in empty tanks. In this study, a model of vessel ballasting operations is applied to all overseas vessel transits of the 1995 shipping season in order to quantify the amount and location of ballast transfers taking place within the Great Lakes. Results for 1995 are also aggregated to overseas and domestic traffic data over the past several years. The model demonstrates that although a large portion of ballast discharges are made in the major <b>grain</b> <b>ports,</b> significant risks for foreign species introduction exist throughout the Great Lakes...|$|R
