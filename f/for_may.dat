5|$|According {{to local}} newspapers, Barrett left {{approximately}} £1.7million to {{his two brothers}} and two sisters. This sum was apparently largely acquired from royalties from Pink Floyd compilations and live recordings featuring songs he had written while with the band. A tribute concert called Games <b>for</b> <b>May</b> {{was held at the}} Barbican Centre, London on 10 May 2007 with Robyn Hitchcock, Captain Sensible, Damon Albarn, Chrissie Hynde, Kevin Ayers and his Pink Floyd bandmates performing.

5|$|After {{completing}} Snakedance, Saward {{requested that}} writer Christopher Bailey devise another story. The initial outline <b>for</b> <b>May</b> Time was commissioned on 24 August 1982 {{and was about}} the Doctor and his companions arriving at the court of Byzantium. Full scripts were commissioned on 16 September 1982 with the new title Man-watch, but the scripts were dropped from production for unclear reasons. A second attempt at the story under the title Children of Seth was attempted as a Sixth Doctor story, for which the scripts commissioned on 14 July 1983. This failed because of Bailey's failure to devise a structure for the new doctor's new 45 minute episode format and a tangible villain for the Doctor to face. It was later adapted as The Children of Seth by Marc Platt for Big Finish's The Lost Stories in December 2011. This version reverts to the TARDIS crew of the Fifth Doctor, Tegan and Nyssa.|$|E
5|$|As {{his term}} neared expiration, Laffoon removed Ben Johnson {{from his post}} as highway commissioner, {{replacing}} him with Tom Rhea.

Because Laffoon supporters controlled the state Democratic Central Committee and most of the county political organizations, a convention would favor Laffoon's choice of gubernatorial nominee. The convention was scheduled <b>for</b> <b>May</b> 14, 1935 in Lexington.|$|E
