5|$|Also in Arcadia, a Motel 6 {{was badly}} damaged. Other {{structural}} damage resulted <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>shock.</b> For example, both Monrovia and Pasadena each {{had more than}} a dozen buildings that were uninhabitable, {{but for the most part}} damage was limited to cracked plaster and broken windows. The Pasadena City Hall had moderate damage consisting of a cracked wall, dislodged marble barriers in the restrooms, and an offset dome. In Sierra Madre, four apartment buildings and nine homes were also tagged as uninhabitable. Of the more than 100 injuries that were reported in Arcadia, Pasadena, Glendale, and Sierra Madre, most were cuts, bruises, and sprains, but some serious injuries also occurred.|$|E
5|$|Early in the Savage's career, squadrons would {{typically}} deploy a detachment to Naval Air Station Port Lyautey, Morocco, {{for service}} with the Sixth Fleet and fly the bombers aboard aircraft carriers {{that were already}} deployed to the Mediterranean as needed. The plan was that the Savages would then be loaded with atomic bombs already aboard the carriers and launched once the carriers were in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea. The tactic to deliver the bombs was to fly at low level through Bulgaria and Romania before climbing at maximum power to the proper altitude to release the bomb. The aircraft would then perform a wingover maneuver and dive to low altitude, keeping {{the tail of the}} aircraft aimed at the target to avoid serious damage <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>shock</b> wave of the explosion.|$|E

5|$|The {{day after}} Anne's {{execution}} in 1536 the 45-year-old Henry became engaged to Seymour, {{who had been}} one of the Queen's ladies-in-waiting. They were married ten days later. On 12 October 1537, Jane gave birth to a son, Prince Edward, the future Edward VI. The birth was difficult, and the queen died on 24 October 1537 from an infection and was buried in Windsor. The euphoria that had accompanied Edward's birth became sorrow, but it was only over time that Henry came to long for his wife. At the time, Henry recovered quickly <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>shock.</b> Measures were immediately put in place to find another wife for Henry, which, at the insistence of Cromwell and the court, were focused on the European continent.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} start of the Second Punic War, Hannibal crossed into Italy by {{traversing}} the Pyrenees and the Alps during the summer and early autumn. He quickly won major victories over the Romans at Trebia and at Lake Trasimene. After these losses, the Romans appointed Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus as dictator to deal with the threat. Fabius used attrition warfare against Hannibal, cutting off his supply lines and avoiding pitched battles. These tactics proved unpopular with the Romans who, as they recovered <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>shock</b> of Hannibal's victories, began to question the wisdom of the Fabian strategy, which had given the Carthaginian army a chance to regroup. The majority of Romans were eager to see a quick conclusion to the war. It was feared that, if Hannibal continued plundering Italy unopposed, Rome's allies might defect to the Carthaginian side for self-preservation.|$|E

In March, he performed in front of Princess Margaret at the Royal Albert Hall in London, raising money for the NSPCC. On March 14, he recorded with Nelson Riddle for the last time, recording the songs Linda, Sweet Loraine, and Barbara. The two men had a major falling out, and later patched up their differences in January 1985 at a dinner organized for Ronald Reagan, when Sinatra asked Riddle to make another album with him.

25|$|In most cassettes, the {{magnetic}} tape {{is attached to}} each spool with a leader, usually made of strong plastic. This leader protected the weaker magnetic tape <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>shock</b> occurring when the tape reached the end.

The clear leader spreads the shock load to a long stretch of tape instead of to the microscopic splice. Various patents have been issued detailing leader construction and associated tape player mechanisms to detect leaders. Cassette tape users would also use spare leaders to repair broken tapes.|$|E

The whole area up to the horizon was covered with dead bodies of women, elderly people and boys and girls of all ages, from newly born to teenagers. From the mass of bodies two figures caught his sight. An old woman with uncovered gray head was lying face down next to a small girl in a blue jacket.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the effects of}} particle acceleration at <b>the</b> bow <b>shocks</b> expected in <b>the</b> binary pulsar system J 0737 - 3039, due to the interaction of <b>the</b> wind <b>from</b> pulsar A with the magnetosphere of pulsar B and with the interstellar medium (ISM). In this model the likeliest source for the X-rays observed by Chandra is <b>the</b> emission <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>shocked</b> wind of pulsar A as it interacts with the ISM. In this case, for favorable model parameter values, better statistics might help Chandra marginally resolve the source. A consequence of the model is that high energy emission reaching up to tens of MeV is also expected, at a level detectable by GLAST. The observed X-ray emission might alternatively arise <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>shocked</b> pulsar A wind in <b>the</b> bow <b>shock</b> around pulsar B, although this requires a high efficiency in producing X-rays.

25|$|The Army of the Cumberland {{recovered}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>shock</b> of Stones River {{and prepared}} for its summer offensive against Confederate General Braxton Bragg. Sheridan's division participated in the advance against Bragg in Rosecrans's brilliant Tullahoma Campaign, and was the lead division to enter the town of Tullahoma.

Sheridan's division made a gallant stand on Lytle Hill against an attack by the Confederate corps of Lt. Gen. James Longstreet, but was swamped by retreating Union soldiers. The Confederates drove Sheridan's division from the field in confusion. He gathered as many men as he could and withdrew toward Chattanooga, rallying troops along the way. Learning of Maj. Gen. George H. Thomas's XIV Corps stand on Snodgrass Hill, Sheridan ordered his division back to the fighting, but they took a circuitous route and did not participate in the fighting as some histories claim. His return to the battlefield ensured that he did not suffer the fate of Rosecrans who rode off to Chattanooga leaving the army to its fate, and was soon relieved of command.|$|E

40|$|In an early-type, {{massive star}} binary system, X-ray bright <b>shocks</b> result <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{powerful}} collision of stellar winds driven by radiation pressure on spectral line transitions. We examine {{the influence of}} <b>the</b> X-rays <b>from</b> <b>the</b> wind-wind collision <b>shocks</b> on <b>the</b> radiative driving of the stellar winds using steady state models that include a parameterized line force with X-ray ionization dependence. Our primary result is that X-ray radiation <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>shocks</b> inhibits wind acceleration {{and can lead to}} a lower pre-shock velocity, and a correspondingly lower shocked plasma temperature, yet the intrinsic X-ray luminosity of <b>the</b> <b>shocks,</b> LX remains largely unaltered, {{with the exception of a}} modest increase at small binary separations. Due to the feedback loop between <b>the</b> ionizing X-rays <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>shocks</b> and <b>the</b> wind-driving, we term this scenario as self regulated shocks. This effect is found to greatly increase the range of binary separations at which a wind-photosphere collision is likely to occur in systems where the momenta of the two winds are significantly different. Furthermore, the excessive levels of X-ray ionization close to <b>the</b> <b>shocks</b> completely suppresses <b>the</b> line force, and we suggest that this may render radiative braking less effective. Comparisons of model results against observations reveals reasonable agreement in terms of log(LX/Lbol). The inclusion of self regulated <b>shocks</b> improves <b>the</b> match for kT values in roughly equal wind momenta systems, but there is a systematic offset for systems with unequal wind momenta (if considered to be a wind-photosphere collision).
