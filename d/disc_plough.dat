40|$|Abstract: Tillage {{is a very}} {{important}} crop production activity which may affect crop performance differently. An experiment was conducted during the during the 2009 and 2010 major crop growing seasons in Kumasi, Ghana, to compare the effect of four different tillage practices on Asontem cowpea (Vigna unguiculata (L) Walp) performance. The treatments consisted of <b>disc</b> <b>ploughing</b> only, <b>disc</b> <b>ploughing</b> followed by <b>disc</b> harrowing, disc harrowing only and no tillage. There was significant difference in Asontem cowpea growth, dry matter yield and yield components between tillage practices. <b>Disc</b> <b>ploughing</b> followed by <b>disc</b> harrowing gave the best results producing the highest percentage seedling emergence, tallest plant, biggest stem girth and greatest number of leaves. Furthermore, <b>disc</b> <b>ploughing</b> followed by <b>disc</b> harrowing resulted in the longest root length, highest dry matter yield, highest number of pods per plant, highest number of seeds per pod and highest 1000 seed-weight. The no tillage plots produced the shortest plant, smallest stem girth and smallest number of leaves. In addition, the no tillage plots gave the shortest root length, lowest dry matter yield, smallest number of pods per plant, smallest number of seeds per pod and smallest 1000 seed-weight. Therefore, considering the soil and weather conditions of the experiment the best tillage practice for Asontem cowpea growth and yield is <b>disc</b> <b>ploughing</b> followed by <b>disc</b> harrowing...|$|R

Two-year field experiment was conducted in 2013 and 2014 to investigate the effects of different tillage methods on the physical properties of sandy loam soil, growth and yield of water melon (Citrullus vulgaris) in a semi-arid environment. The Tillage treatments were <b>disc</b> <b>ploughing</b> plus <b>disc</b> harrowing (DP+DH), double <b>disc</b> <b>ploughing</b> (DDP), double <b>disc</b> harrowing (DDH), <b>disc</b> <b>ploughing</b> (DP) and <b>disc</b> harrowing (DH) as minimum tillage (MT) and zero tillage (ZT) and direct drilling method (control). The watermelon seeds were Planted manually placing three (3) seeds per hole at an interval of 1. 5 m along the rows and 50 cm between the rows at an average depth of 5 cm. The treatments were laid in a randomized complete block design (RCBD) with four replications. Results showed that <b>disc</b> <b>ploughing</b> + <b>disc</b> harrowing (DP+DH) {{was found to be}} more appropriate and profitable tillage method in improving soil physical properties and growth and yield of water melon in a sandy loam soil. Watermelon yield, fruit weight (FW), fruit length (FL), fruit diameter (FD) and leaf area index (LAI) were significantly influenced (P= 0. 05), but influence of tillage treatments were not significant on the number of fruit per plant (NFPP). A numerical value of 31. 0 t/ha, 26. 0, 5. 4 kg, 29. 0 cm, and 33. 8 cm were recorded for maximum crop yield, NFPP, FW, FD and FL respectively in DP+DH-treated plots. For zero tillage (ZT) treatment, maximum of crop yield and NFPP were 26. 5 t/ha and 20. 0 respectively. Thus for enhanced growth and yield of watermelon, DP/DH would be more preferable.

We carried out experiments to determine the impact of fire, kangaroo grazing, mowing and <b>disc</b> <b>ploughing</b> on grassland species richness and composition in a nature reserve in semi-arid eastern Australia. Vegetation response was influenced by winter-spring drought after establishment of the experiments, but moderate rainfall followed in late summer-autumn. Species composition varied greatly between sampling times, and the variability due to rainfall differences between seasons and years was greater than the effects of fire, kangaroo grazing, mowing or <b>disc</b> <b>ploughing.</b> In the fire experiment, species richness and composition recovered more rapidly after spring than autumn burning. Species richness and composition were similar to control sites within 12 months of burning and mowing, suggesting that removal of the dominant grass canopy is unnecessary to enhance plant diversity. Two fires (separated by 3 years) and post-fire kangaroo grazing had only minor influence on species richness and composition. Even <b>disc</b> <b>ploughing</b> caused only a small reduction in native richness. The minor impact of ploughing was explained by the small areas that were ploughed, the once-off nature of the treatment, and {{the high degree of}} natural movement and cracking in these shrink-swell soils. Recovery of the composition and richness of these grasslands was rapid because of the high proportion of perennial species that resprout vegetatively after fire and mowing. There appears to be little conservation benefit from fire, mowing or ploughing ungrazed areas, as we could identify no native plant species dependent on frequent disturbance for persistence in this grassland community. However, the ability of the Astrebla- and Dichanthium-dominated grasslands to recover quickly after disturbance, given favourable seasonal conditions, suggests that they are well adapted to natural disturbances (e. g. droughts, fire, flooding and native grazing) ...|$|R

Also, there was a decrease in the specific tractor wattage from 16 W/ha in 1984 to 12 W/ha in 1998. This means that farm mechyanization suffered a setback during the 15 -year period, with fewer functional tractors and less power availble per 1000 ha of cultivated land. The major problems of tractor use in the State were high overhead cost, lack of spare parts of some makes and poor operation skills.

During monitored vegetation period this dynamics was changeable. The content of nitrate nitrogen in the soil in autumn was about 40 % higher than content of ammonium nitrate. This tendency changed in spring, when the average content of ammonium nitrogen was higher than the content of nitrate nitrogen on average about 60 %. The cultivation had significant influence on dynamics of inorganic nitrogen. The average content of inorganic nitrogen in conventional tillage up to the depth of 0, 25 m was 8, 43 mg. kg- 1 and in <b>disc</b> <b>ploughing</b> it was 7, 60 mg. kg- 1. The influence of fertilization on changes of inorganic nitrogen was significantly important.

To determine the energy requirements of tillage implements, experimentation in field conditions and controlled laboratory was conducted. Costs of alternative implements and complete systems were analysed. The field experiment was undertaken to determine the performance of tillage implements in real conditions. Draught force and area of disturbance of the implements were measured and specific resistance calculated. The implements involved in the experiment were 4 furrow mouldboard plough, 3 furrow <b>disc</b> <b>plough,</b> disc harrow and 7 winged tines. The mouldboard plough was operating at two different depths. Two tractors were used for execution of the implement and the wheel slip was measured. The soil bin studies were conducted in additional evaluation of the implements. The laboratory conditions ensure the uniformity of each test. The experiment was carried out to determine draught force, area of disturbance and specific resistance. The experiment involved single furrow mouldboard plough, <b>disc</b> <b>plough,</b> disc harrow and winged tines. Winged tines were made up of four different wing widths. Finally, an economic cost calculator was developed to compare the costs of different implements and tillage systems. Technical parameters and current prices of the implements were obtained from the manufacturers. The results from the field experiment show that there is a similar draught force per unit implement for mouldboard and disc ploughs, while draught force of mouldboard plough is significantly higher. The tillage efficiency of all implements is similar, with a mean of specific resistance of 58 kN/m 2 and a range of 15 kN/m 2. In the soil bin the vertical force preventing penetration occurred for <b>disc</b> <b>plough</b> and disc harrow. The specific resistance of the mouldboard plough had the lowest value, while the specific resistance of <b>disc</b> <b>plough</b> was higher by a factor of 1. 65. By increasing the wing width of the tines the draught force was increased but the specific resistance decreased. Comparing the costs of complete tillage systems it was observed that minimum tillage decreases the operational cost per hectare by 30 % compared to a conventional system based on ploughing. Direct drilling is the cheapest way to establish a crop, but if herbicide has to be applied the cost per hectare {{is similar to that of}} minimum tillage.

40|$|Most of {{the indices}} {{currently}} employed for assessing soil surface micro-topography, such as random roughness (RR), are merely descriptors of its vertical component. Recently, multifractal analysis provided a new insight for describing the spatial configuration of soil surface roughness. The main {{objective of this}} study was to test the ability of multifractal parameters to assess decay of initial surface roughness induced by natural rainfall under different soil tillage systems in field conditions. In addition, we evaluated the potential of the joint use of multifractal indices plus RR to improve predictions of water storage in depressions of the soil surface (MDS). Field experiments were performed on an Oxisol at Campinas, S√£o Paulo State (Brazil). Six tillage treatments, namely, disc harrow, <b>disc</b> <b>plough,</b> chisel plough, disc harrow + disc level, <b>disc</b> <b>plough</b> + disc level and chisel plough + disc level were tested. In each treatment soil surface micro-topography was measured four times, with increasing amounts of natural rainfall, using a pin meter. The sampling scheme was a square grid with 25 &times; 25 mm point spacing and the plot size was 1350 &times; 1350 mm (‚âà 1. 8 m 2 ), so that each data set consisted of 3025 individual elevation points. Duplicated measurements were taken per treatment and date, yielding a total of 48 experimental data sets. MDS was estimated from grid elevation data with a depression-filling algorithm. Multifractal analysis was performed for experimental data sets as well as for oriented and random surface conditions obtained from the former by removing slope and slope plus tillage marks, respectively. All the investigated microplots exhibited multifractal behaviour, irrespective of surface condition, but the degree of multifractality showed wide differences between them. Multifractal parameters provided valuable information for characterizing the spatial features of soil micro-topography as they were able to discriminate data sets with similar values for the vertical component of roughness. Both, rough and smooth soil surfaces, with high and low roughness values, respectively, can display similar levels of spectral complexity. Although in most of the studied cases trend removal produces increasing homogeneity in the spatial configuration of height readings, spectral complexity of individual data sets may increase or decrease, when slope or slope plus tillage tool marks are filtered. Increased cumulative rainfall had significant effects on various parameters from the generalized dimension, Dq, and singularity spectrum, f(Œ±). Overall, micro-topography decay by rainfall produced was reflected on a shift of the singularity spectra, f(Œ±) from the left side (q&gt;&gt; 0) to the right side (q&lt;&lt; 0) and also on a shift of the generalized dimension spectra from the right side (q&gt;&gt; 0) to the left side (q&lt;&lt; 0).

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess the role of El Rawashda Natural Forest Reserve as a natural rangeland and the impact of grazing in terms of deforestation and replacement of palatable species by unpalatable species and the possibilities of finding solutions to these problems. Two types of data were user for this study; namely, primary and secondary data which were collected during the period 2008 - 2009. The primary data were collected through social survey as faceto- face interviews with pastoralists and local communities in the study area and by a field experiment on an area of 20 feddans and affected by grazing in the forest. The experimental area was divided into 5 blocks, each block consisted of 4 treatments, namely, seeds of grass and talih (Acacia seyal) were broadcast seeding just before autumn, seeding after <b>disc</b> <b>ploughing,</b> sowing using water harvesting technique and a control (no seeding). The secondary data were collected from the Range and Pasture Administration and the Forest National Corporation (FNC). There were distinct ecological changes in the study area as indicated by the deterioration of the rangelands and retrogression where some palatable weed species disappeared from the study area and were replaced by other unpalatable species due to open grazing pressure, illegal tree felling by the local people and expansion in the rain fed mechanized agricultural schemes due. Moreover, overgrazing represents a real challenge to the conservation and rehabilitation of El Rawashda Forest in the absence of proper protection and management. In addition, the number of animals is more than the carrying capacity of the forest and this resulted in the disappearance of some palatable species and the appearance of new VI unpalatable one. Frequent drought cycles (climate change and variability) and fires also contributed to the deterioration of the forest. The results of the experiment revealed significant differences among some treatments used to improve and tree cover. The seeding of the forage and talh seeds after <b>disc</b> <b>ploughing</b> gave the best results compared to other treatments, followed by forage and talh seed sowing under water harvesting technique and broadcasting of forage and trees seeds and finally the control. In conclusion the deterioration of the natural rangelands in El Rawasha Forest Reserve is due to the existence of livestock in the forest area for a long period of time.

40|$|Cambodia has {{achieved}} food security {{with respect to}} rice production and now {{has an opportunity to}} pay more attention to boosting production of upland crops such as maize (corn), soybean, sesame, mungbean, cassava, peanut and cowpea. While rice remains the main crop in Cambodia, the production of other crops is undergoing a rapid expansion and will be especially important for the development of those parts of the Kingdom unsuited to lowland rice. We present results from socio-economic surveys carried out in the Battambang, Kampong Cham and Takeo Provinces to identify available resources, management practices and key constraints for emerging upland cropping systems. These are mainly cash crops, so the important issues to consider are profitability, technological and management changes, and household and social issues. The surveys were conducted in the Districts of Kamrieng, Sampov Lun, Rotonak Mondol and Banan in Battambang Province, Chamkar Leu, Ou Reang Ov and Tbong Khmum in Kampong Cham Province, and Tramkak in Takeo Province. Sample sizes were 181 in Battambang and Kampong Cham, and 50 in Takeo. Generally farm families had a male head aged in the mid- 40 s, with 3 to 4 years of schooling. However, there are significant numbers of female farmers among survey respondents. Family size averaged 5 to 6 persons; with 2 to 3 being dependents and levels of off-farm work very low. Average farm size was 2 to 8 ha, and capital items owned included draft animals, ox carts and mouldboard ploughs, as well as tractors and <b>disc</b> <b>ploughs</b> in some areas. The main reasons given for not growing crops were poor yield performance, lack of knowledge (especially about insects), concerns about profitability, land/soil constraints, labour/equipment issues, and agronomic and climate risk (including drought). These results point to the need for focused research on new technologies and management as they affect crop yields and profits, and for increased extension of this information to Cambodian farmers...|$|R
40|$|We {{studied the}} {{relationship}} between urease activity (UA) and soil organic matter (SOM), microbial biomass N (Nbiom) content, and urea-N fertilizer assimilation by maize in a Dark Red Latosol (Typic Haplustox) cultivated for 9 years under no-tillage (NT), tillage with a <b>disc</b> <b>plough</b> (DP), and tillage with a moldboard plough (MP). Two soil depths were sampled (0 - 7. 5 cm and 7. 5 - 15 cm) at 4 different times during the crop cycle. Urea was applied at four different rates, ranging from 0 to 240 kg N ha- 1. The levels of fertilizer N {{did not affect the}} UA, SOM content, and Nbiom content. No significant difference between the treatments (NT, DP, and MP) was observed for SOM during the experiment, probably because the major part of the SOM was in recalcitrant pools, since the area was previously cultivated (conventional tillage) for 20 years. The Nbiom content explained 97 nd 69 f the variation in UA in the upper and deeper soil layer, respectively. UA and biomass N were significantly higher in the NT system compared to the DP and MP systems. The highest maize productivity and urea-N recovery was also observed for the NT system. We observed that the increase in urea-N losses under NT, possibly as a consequence of a higher UA, was compensated for by the increase in N immobilized in the biomass...|$|E

Three different makes and models of tractors namely: New Holland (model-NH 5610 SE and capacity- 55. 9 kw), Massey Ferguson (model-MF 430 E and capacity- 55. 2 kw) and Mahindra (model-NH 7570 E and capacity- 55. 9 kw) with 3 - point hitch systems and {{average age of}} 1. 3 years were used to study the field {{performances of}} each of the implements, in five different states that made up the study area. The field performances studied include; implements working speed, operation time, depth of cut, effective and theoretical field capacities, field efficiency, fuel consumption rate, implement power requirements, and wheel slippage, under different soil conditions. Results obtained revealed that the <b>disc</b> <b>plough</b> had field efficiency range of 85. 74 % to 88. 55 %, effective and theoretical field capacities range of 0. 846 to 1. 164 ha/hr and 0. 961 to 1. 319 ha/hr respectively; and the highest field (ploughing) efficiency was obtained in loamy-sandy soil when the plough was operated with the Massey Ferguson tractor. Harrow recorded field efficiency range of 80. 17 to 91. 38 %, effective and theoretical field capacities range of 0. 931 to 1. 458 ha/hr and 1. 151 to 1. 667 ha/hr respectively; and the highest field (harrowing) efficiency was obtained on sandy-clay soil by New Holland tractor. Ridger recorded 83. 65 to 88. 82 % field efficiency, 0. 932 to 1. 322 ha/hr effective capacity and 1. 073 to 1. 504 ha/hr theoretical field capacity; and sandy-clay gave the highest field (ridging) efficiency when operated with a New Holland tractor. The rotovator had field efficiency range of 81. 10 to 89. 81 %, effective and theoretical field capacities range of 0. 759 to 0. 902 ha/hr and 0. 758 to 1. 039 ha/hr respectively; and the highest pulverizing efficiency was achieved on the clay-loam soil with a Massey Ferguson tractor. The planter recorded 80. 63 to 89. 37 field efficiency, 1. 012 to 1. 481 ha/hr effective field capacity and theoretical field capacity of 1. 22 to 1. 716 ha/hr. Ploughing gave the highest average fuel consumption rate of 22. 72 L/ha (8. 89 L/hr), followed by harrowing with average consumption of 19. 57 L/ha (8. 04 L/hr), ridging recorded 19. 42 L/ha (7. 97 L/hr), rotovator had 16. 79 L/ha (7. 19 L/hr) and least was planter with average consumption rate of 15. 10 L/ha (6. 26 L/hr). More so, all implements recorded highest tyre slippage in sandy-clay soil, followed by loamy-sandy and the least slippage was recorded in the clay-loam soil. Results finally revealed that the highest draft force (10. 8 kN/m) was obtained by the plough, followed by the harrow and ridger with equal draft force values of 10. 5 kN/m respectively and least draft was recorded by the rotovator (5. 1 kN/m) ...|$|E

The major objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the impacts of season, soil compaction by mechanical harvesting and soil cultivation on soil microbial biomass carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) during the early stages of a second-rotation (2 R) hoop pine (Araucaria cunninghamii) plantation. Soil (0 - 10 cm depth) was sampled for 14 consecutive months in an established factorial field trial at Yarraman, southeast Queensland. There were three compaction treatments (0 forwarder pass, 1 forwarder pass and 16 forwarder passes) and two cultivation treatments (zero cultivation and <b>disc</b> <b>plough),</b> which were randomly arranged in three blocks. There was seasonal and spatial variation in soil microbial biomass in mineral soils among the different compaction and cultivation treatments, with soil microbial biomass C (MBC) ranging from 167 to 1149 Âß†g- 1, microbial biomass N (MBN) from 16 to 257 Âß†g- 1, and microbial C:N ratios from 4. 0 to 14. 6. Fluctuations in soil microbial biomass were mainly driven by the seasonal changes in environmental conditions (including rainfall, temperature and soil moisture). The MBC was less variable with season than the MBN. In general, seasonal fluctuations in MBN were similar amongst the treatments with an apparent peak in August (late winter), followed by a sharp decrease to a lowest point in October (mid-spring), and then a second peak in December (early summer). Soil compaction did not significantly affect MBC and MBN, while soil cultivation significantly reduced MBC and MBN only in the 0 forwarder pass for the experimental period except February and March 2001 (summer-early spring) for MBC and January-March 2001 (summer-early spring) for MBN.

40|$|A {{literature}} review {{was conducted on}} several models which have been developed, based on Terzaghi's passive earth pressure theory, to describe the forces acting upon tillage implements during tillage operations. These models require a knowledge of cohesion (c) and angle of internal shearing resistance (cp) data which {{are not easy to}} obtain especially in remote areas. The main objective {{of the study was to}} establish a prediction model for the draught force required for a range of primary tillage implements under different field and soil conditions. The data obtained from the model were used to investigate whether the model was adequate for the mechanisation planning of the GAP region (South Eastern Anatolia Integrated Development Project) in Tiirkiye where by the year 2012, approximately 1. 7 million ha ofland will be opened to irrigation. An effective three-point linkage dynamometer system was developed to measure the draught of implements under different soil conditions. The system consists of bi-axial Linkage Extended Octagonal Ring Transducers (LEORTs) for the lower links, a modified top link and a rotary position transducer sensing the angle of the crossshaft, together with a 21 x datalogger and a portable computer. All transducers outputs were repeatable and linear with a co'efficient of determination of ~ 0. 999. The output hysteresis effect was small for all transducers; the largest deviation from the mean was 1. 006 % [f. s. ] which occurred in the top link. Cross-sensitivity errors for the LEORTs were not significant at a maximum of 0. 001 J. lV V-IN-I. A spreadsheet model was developed in order to download the data from the instrumentation system to the computer. The model is user friendly and can be used to calculate and plot the forces on the linkage system. Field experiments were conducted to determine draught force requirements of tillage implements such as a <b>disc</b> <b>plough,</b> mouldboard plough, chisel and subsoiler both under sandy loam soil conditions in UK and clay soil conditions in Tiirkiye.

A recolha da folhada efectuou-se durante tr√™s anos, de Abril de 1996 a Mar√ßo de 1999. A maior produ√ß√£o m√©dia anual de folhada foi obtida no T 3 (mobiliza√ß√£o nula) provavelmente devido ao facto das ra√≠zes n√£o terem sido danificadas. Dentro dos v√°rios componentes da folhada, as folhas foram o que mais contribu√≠ram para o seu total, em todos os tratamentos, seguindo-se os ouri√ßos e a castanha. A maior produ√ß√£o de castanha obtevese no T 3, seguindo-se o T 2 e o T 1. A maior produ√ß√£o de frutos no T 2 em rela√ß√£o ao T 1 pode, provavelmente, ser atribu√≠da ao facto de o escarificador ser mais {{prejudicial}} ao sistema radical que a grade de discos.

In all treatments, leaves made the highest contribution to total litter, followed by burs and nuts. In relation to the chestnut fruit, the highest production was obtained in T 3, followed by T 2 and T 1. The largest nut production in T 2 than in T 1 may be related to the more damaging effect that chisel ploughing has on the root system when compared to disc ploughing. In general, the lowest nutrient concentration occurred in T 1, which is related not only with the lower litter production but also with the nutrient concentration in the different litterfall components.

40|$|The annual {{production}} of biosolids in the Perth region {{during the period}} of this study was approximately 13, 800 t dry solids (DS), being supplied by three major wastewater treatment plants. Of this, 70 % was typically used as a low-grade fertiliser in agriculture, representing an annual land use area of around 1, 600 ha when spread between 5 and 7 t DS/ha. Loading rates of biosolids are typically based on the nitrogen (N) requirements of the crop to be grown, referred to as the N Limiting Biosolids Application Rate (NLBAR). A consequence of using the NLBAR to calculate loading rates is that phosphorus (P) is typically in excess of plant requirement. The resultant high loading rates of P are considered in the guidelines developed for the agricultural use of biosolids in Western Australia, but lack research data specific to local conditions and soil types. Regulatory changes throughout Australia and globally to protect the environment from wastewater pollution have created a need for more accountable and balanced nutrient data. Experiments presented in this thesis were undertaken to ascertain: the percentage relative effectiveness (RE) of biosolids as a source of plant available P compared with inorganic P fertiliser; loading rates to best supply P for optimum crop growth; P loading rates of risk to the environment; and the forms of P in local biosolids. Therefore, both the agronomic and environmental viewpoints were considered. Anaerobically digested and dewatered biosolids produced from Beenyup Wastewater Treatment Plant, Perth with a mean total P content of 2. 97 % dry weight basis (db) were used in a series of glasshouse, field and laboratory experiments. The biosolids were sequentially fractionated to identify the forms of P present and likewise in soil samples after applying biosolids or monocalcium phosphate (MCP). The biosolid P was predominantly inorganic (92 %), and hence the organic fraction (8 %) available for mineralisation at all times would be extremely low. The most common forms of biosolid P were water-soluble P and exchangeable inorganic P (66 %), followed by bicarbonate extractable P (19 %) and the remaining P as inorganic forms associated with Fe, Al and Ca (14 %). Following the application of biosolids to a lateritic soil, the Fe and Al soil fractions sorbed large amounts of P, not unlike the distribution of P following the addition of MCP. Further investigation would be required to trace the cycling of biosolid P in the various soil pools. The growth response of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) to increasing rates of biosolids and comparable rates of inorganic P as MCP, to a maximum of 150 mg P/kg soil was examined in the glasshouse. The percentage relative effectiveness (RE) of biosolids was calculated using fitted curve coefficients from the Mitscherlich equation: y = a (1 -b exp‚Äìcx) for dry matter (DM) production and P uptake. The initial effectiveness of biosolid P was comparable to that of MCP with the percentage RE of biosolids averaging 106 % for DM {{production of}} wheat shoots and 118 % for shoot P uptake at 33 days after sowing (DAS) over three consecutive crops. The percentage residual value (RV) declined at similar rates for DM production in MCP and biosolids, decreasing to about 33 % relative to freshly applied MCP in the second crop and to approximately 16 % in the third crop. The effectiveness of biosolid P was reduced significantly compared with inorganic P when applied to a field site 80 km east of Perth (520 mm annual rainfall). An infertile lateritic podsolic soil, consistent with the glasshouse experiment and representative of a soil type typically used for the agricultural application of biosolids in Western Australia was used. Increasing rates of biosolids and comparable rates of triple superphosphate (TSP), to a maximum of 145 kg P/ha were applied to determine a P response curve. The percentage RE was calculated for seasonal DM production, final grain yield and P uptake in wheat followed by lupin (Lupinus angustifolius L.) rotation for the 2001 and 2002 growing seasons, respectively. In the first year of wheat, the RE for P uptake in biosolids compared with top-dressed TSP ranged from 33 % to 55 % over the season and by grain harvest was 67 %. In the second year, and following incorporation with the <b>disc</b> <b>plough</b> at seeding, the RE for P uptake by lupins in biosolids averaged 79 % over the growing season compared with top-dressed TSP, and by grain harvest the RE was 60 %. The residual value (RV) of lupins at harvest in biosolids compared with freshly applied TSP was 47 %. The non-uniform placement of biosolids (i. e. spatial heterogeneity) was primarily responsible for the decreased ability of plant roots to absorb P. The P was more effective where biosolids were finely dispersed throughout the soil, less so when roughly cultivated and least effective when placed on the soil surface without incorporation. The RE for grain harvest of wheat in the field decreased from 67 % to 39 % where biosolids were not incorporated (i. e. surface-applied). The RE could also be modified by factors such as soil moisture and N availability in the field, although it was possible to keep these variables constant in the glasshouse. Consequently, absolute values determined for the RE need to be treated judiciously. Calculations showed that typical loading rates of biosolids required to satisfy agronomic P requirements of wheat in Western Australia in the first season could vary from 0 to 8. 1 t DS/ha, depending on soil factors such as the P Retention Index (PRI) and bicarbonate available P value. Loading rates of biosolids were inadequate for optimum P uptake by wheat at 5 t DS/ha (i. e. 145 kg P/ha) based on the NLBAR on high P sorbing soils with a low fertiliser history (i. e. PRI > 15, Colwell bicarbonate extractable P 2 mm, and thus their was little relationship between soil bicarbonate extractable P and P uptake by plants in the field. The risk of P leaching in biosolids-amended soil was examined over a number of different soil types at comparable rates of P at 140 mg P/kg (as either biosolids or MCP) in a laboratory experiment. Given that biosolids are restricted on sites prone to water erosion, the study focussed on the movement of water-soluble P by leaching rather than by runoff of water-soluble P and particulate P. In general the percentage soluble reactive P recovered was lower in soils treated with biosolids than with MCP, as measured in leachate collected using a reverse soil leachate unit. This was particularly evident in acid washed sand with SRP measuring 14 % for biosolids and 71 % for MCP, respectively, although the differences were not as large in typical agricultural soils. Specific soil properties, such as the PRI, pH, organic carbon and reactive Fe content were negatively correlated to soluble reactive P in leachate and thus reduced the risk of P leaching in biosolids-amended soil. Conversely, the total P and bicarbonate extractable P status of the soils investigated were unreliable indicators as to the amount of P leached. On the basis of the experiments conducted, soils in Western Australia were categorised according to their ability to minimise P enrichment and provide P necessary for crop growth at loading rates determined by the NLBAR. Biosolids applied at the NLBAR to soils of PRI > 2 mL/g with reactive Fe > 200 mg/kg were unlikely to necessitate P loading restrictions. Although specific to anaerobically digested biosolids cake applied to Western Australian soils, the results will be of relevance to any industry involved in the land application of biosolids, to prevent P contamination in water bodies and to make better use of P in crop production...|$|E

Tobacco is tillage-intensive since traditional production systems entail seven or eight cultivation operations before transplanting. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate two alternative tillage systems in comparison with conventional tillage for tobacco production with the aim to improve soil conditions, reduce the number of tillage operations for soil preparation for transplanting, and increase yields. The treatments studied were: (T 1) conventional or traditional tillage, (T 2) reduced tillage with a multi-tiller plough, and (T 3) reduced tillage with a chisel plough. T 1 consisted in <b>disc</b> <b>ploughing</b> twice and <b>disc</b> harrowing twice for primary tillage, while before transplanting plots were ploughed twice with a horse-drawn mouldboard plough and harrowed twice with a horse-drawn spike-tooth harrow. In T 2 primary tillage was accomplished with two passes with the multi-tiller followed by disc harrowing twice before transplanting. In T 3 chisel ploughing was substituted for multi-tiller ploughing. The two reduced tillage systems improved the physical conditions of the soil, which resulted in: lower bulk density, with average values across the 0 - 30 cm soil profile of 1. 48, 1. 34 and 1. 30 Mg m - 3 in T 1, T 2 and T 3, respectively, at the end of the growing season; higher soil water content in the soil profile in all four sampling dates per season; greater porosity; and lower resistance to penetration with values of 2. 48, 2. 15 and 1. 71 MPa in T 1, T 2 and T 3, respectively, before crop harvesting. Tillage system T 3 provided the highest crop yields (2. 26 Mg ha - 1) compared with T 2 (2. 14 Mg ha - 1) and T 1 (1. 95 Mg ha - 1), for the plants grown on T 3 plots had the largest number of leaves.
