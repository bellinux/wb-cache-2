The premises of the Stone House Public house (number 19 - 21) is also listed although the pub has been closed for a few years and stands empty. In August 2005, London & Associated Properties bought the Stone House for £2,500,000 and plan to incorporate it within the nearby Orchard Square shopping centre which they own. This will create 42000 sq ft of redeveloped space.A bronze Statue of James Montgomery [...] "The Christian Poet" [...] stands on the Cathedral Precinct on Church Street just east of the Cathedral. Another significant building on the northern side of the thoroughfare is the Blood <b>Donor</b> <b>Centre,</b> a large building on the corner with Townhead street which was a Jobcentre in the 1980s. There is a Lloyds TSB bank also on the northern side of the street at number 14. Further to the west up the street on the same side at number 20 stands Cairns Chambers [...] built between 1894 and 1896. They were designed by Charles Hadfield in Tudor Gothic style for the solicitors Henry & Alfred Maxwell, the chambers have decorative exterior stonework by Frank Tory including a four-foot statue of Earl Cairns, a former Lord Chancellor. St. James Row joins Church Street on its northern side and features the buildings known as No. 1 St. James Row. Although officially on St. James Row the buildings have a substantial frontage onto Church Street and are an integral part of the thoroughfare. They were built in 1885 by Hemsoll & Smith as the Gladstone Buildings and were used as the Reform Club and offices. The buildings are grade two listed and were saved from demolition in 1976 with the interior being re-designed as offices and the exterior facade left intact.Other businesses on Church Street include an armed forces recruiting centre, several employment agencies and an independent chocolate shop specializing in imported Belgian Chocolates. In February 2014 a branch of Tesco Express was opened in part of 17 Church Street, which was the old HSBC Bank buildings. The bank left the premises in 2009 when it consolidated its city centre branches.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Stem cell transplantations from related or {{unrelated}} {{donors are}} used to cure leukaemia and other blood diseases. When a patient dies after an unsuccessful transplantation, interested unrelated donors are informed about the failure by their <b>donor</b> <b>centre.</b> Studies focussing on failed related donations show that donors undergo an intense grieving process. As {{there are only two}} investigations about reactions from unrelated donors, knowledge about their reactions is less comprehensive. Methods We conducted a prospective study of reactions of unrelated donors to the information of failed transplantations, subject to various communication methods (letter, phone). Questionnaires were sent to 395 unrelated donors who received the news of their recipients' deaths between November 2005 and August 2006. In addition, twelve in-depth interviews with selected donors were carried out. Results Unrelated donors were emotionally affected by the recipients' deaths, and it is appropriate to speak about a "Donor Grief" phenomenon, as the results of 325 returned questionnaires (return rate 82. 3 %) and in-depth interviews show. Donors demonstrated a range of feelings such as sadness, disappointment, grief, and helplessness. These feelings were often unexpectedly intense {{given the fact that the}} recipient was a stranger. Although the news caused grief, donors underlined that they nevertheless wanted to be informed. They preferred knowledge of the failure to uncertainty. The method of providing the information is only of secondary importance. Most donors favoured the way of communication they had experienced. Conclusion This result indicates that both phone and letter communication can be justified. However, phone communication seems to be superior with respect to aspects of sensitivity. In spite of transplantation failure and the associated negative feelings, most donors were happy to have donated and would be willing to do so again. Our results underline the special responsibility of donor centres for informing and supporting unrelated volunteer donors in case their recipients have died. </p...|$|E
40|$|MBA - WBSIn South Africa, the South African National Blood Service (SANBS) is {{the largest}} blood {{transfusion}} service and {{is responsible for the}} collection, processing and issuing of blood and blood products. In 1975 the World Health Organisation in the Safe Blood Policy recommended that all blood collections should be based on voluntary non-remunerated donations {{in order to ensure that}} the blood supply of the nation is as safe as possible (WHO 1975). The purpose of this research is to understand the donation behaviour patterns of blood donors in South Africa. Behaviour patterns that could provide understanding of the motivators that enable blood donors to return to donate, the deterrents to blood donation in order to prevent donor loss, and ascertaining the factors that explain why donors stop donating blood. 244 Lapsed and Current donors were contacted telephonically and interviewed using a structured interview guide by the Egoli Telerecruiting Department from the lapsed donor base of the Westgate and Fairlands Donor Centres. The data was analysed using descriptive statistics. The reasons why donors start donating is because donors are altruistic in behaviour and have a “giving” nature, and donors are influenced by family, fiends and peers in the workplace and at school. Donors continue to donate blood because of convenient venues, days and time are necessary to keep the donors donating as well as incentives in the form of gifts are important in encouraging donors to remain as donors. Time constraints, medical deferrals and failure to remind the donor to donate are the key reasons for why donors do not return to donate blood. The recommendations are based on the facts that donors want convenience in <b>donor</b> <b>centre</b> times, improved privacy during the pre-donation interview, donor education and telephonic reminders to ensure that donor retention is improved and thus ensure the sustainability of SANB...|$|E

It is based on a ten month period of research involving a literature review, interviews with headmasters of secondary schools who gave permission to survey their students, educational talks to secondary school learners and a survey of 500 learners from different schools in the Mthatha region. Purpose: The research endeavour addressed the problem of investigating the effectiveness of blood donor education in secondary schools in Mthatha region. Design/methodology/approach: This study employed a questionnaire-based survey. Five schools namely Mthatha High School, Holy Cross High School, Strategic High School; St Johns’ College and Zamukulungisa High School participated in this study. The Statistical Analysis System was employed to assess the association between the awareness strategies and general donor response. A chi–square test of association, based on the p –value approach, was used to achieve the results. Findings: This study finds that a blood donor education programme can increase blood donation awareness; benefit the schools and community, thus increasing the blood donor base. Receiving information as to the criteria for blood donation and how each individual donation is used to save a life is seen as a powerful means of reinforcement. Research limitations/implications: Further research is recommended on a large scale, involving all schools in Mthatha region. The research was delayed because it employed a new approach and a team had to be appointed before the blood <b>donor</b> <b>centre</b> can be opened.

Effective masses (m*) increase with increasing carrier concentration N and obey an approximately linear variation of the form m* = m* + cN, where c is a constant. UPS shows a well-defined conduction band feature for doped samples. A shift of the valence band edge towards high binding energy due to chemical doping was observed in He(I) UPS, which is confirmed by shifts of O 2 p valence band features and Cd 4 d core level peaks in high resolution XPS. However, the shifts are less than expected from the increased widths of the occupied part of the conduction band. This is due to shrinkage of the bandgap with doping.

Simple educational leaflets explaining the high frequency of colorectal cancer and screening which addressed reasons for non-compliance were investigated. Subjects completed faecal occult blood tests at home and those with positive results underwent colonoscopy. Completion of tests in general practice in those aged 51 to 70 years was 33 % (665 / 2029) in men and 42 % (900 / 2147) in women. In private industry in subjects aged 41 to 65 years, compliance in men was 25 % (425 / 1703) and in women 32 % (40 / 125). In public industry in subjects aged 41 to 65 years compliance was 32 % (53 / 165) in men and 46 % (376 / 820) in women. With opportunistic screening at the blood <b>donor</b> <b>centre</b> compliance in those offered screening aged 51 to 65 years was 66 % (75 / 114) in men and in women 59 % (41 / 70).

Reasons for non-compliance addressed in the leaflet, were identified from an interview survey of 81 non-compliers in Market Harborough. Common reasons were the unpleasantness of stool collection, lack of appreciation that healthy subjects should participate, fear of further tests and surgery and intercurrent illness.

40|$|Mannose glyco-oligoamide β-D-Man-Py-γ-Py-Ind (β-D-Man, 1) and two new glyco-oligoamides, β-L-Man-Py-γ-Py-Ind (β-L-Man, 2) and 6 -deoxy-β-D-Man-Py-γ-Py-Ind (6 -deoxy-β-D-Man, 3), {{have been}} {{designed}} and synthesized to investigate the role of hydrogen-bonding cooperative donor centres of carbohydrates in their recognition by DNA. The free- and bound-state geometries were studied, as were the affinities of the D and L enantiomers of the mannose glyco-oligoamides (1 and 2) for DNA polymers [ct-DNA and poly(dA-dT) 2]. TR-NOESY and DF-STD experiments for the diastereomeric complexes formed with DNA allow the asymmetric centres of the sugar residue that {{are close to the}} inner and outer regions of the DNA minor grooves to be distinguished. A C→N hairpin folding in β-L-Man derivative 2 was observed, with the α face of the sugar close to the indole ring. The C- 2 and C- 3 centres are orientated towards the inner region of the DNA minor groove. The affinity data for poly(dA-dT) 2 indicate that there is a chiral discrimination process, with β-L-Man derivative 2 being the best ligand. 6 -Deoxy-β-D-Man derivative 3 forms the least stable complexes with DNA. Molecular dynamics simulations of β-L-Man derivative 2 in complex with a double-strand dodecamer d(AT) 12 are in agreement with the experimental NMR spectroscopic data. Thus, the cooperative <b>donor</b> <b>centre</b> 2 -OH in the L-mannose enantiomer is a key contributor to the stability of the 2 ·poly(dA-dT) 2 complex. Structural and affinity data have been obtained for different mannose oligoamides when binding to DNA polymers. A β-L-Man ligand (2) binds to poly(dA-dT) 2 with a more well-defined structure, consistent with a better affinity. Thus, the placement of cooperative hydrogen-bond donor centres towards the inner region of the minor groove increases the binding affinity for polyAT(dA-dT) 2.

40|$|A {{total of}} 150 {{patients}} underwent cardiac transplantation at Stanford between January 1968 and August 1978. Sixty-two patients were alive {{at the end}} of this period, when the expected one-year survival rate was 70 %, with an attrition rate of roughly 5 % thereafter. Changes in postoperative managment resulting from continuing research contributed to improved survival rates. The results are equal or superior to those for recipients of renal transplants from unrelated <b>donors.</b> Major <b>centres</b> that have suitably trained staff and appropriate facilities for cardiac surgery should perhaps reconsider cardiac transplantation as an alternative to death in certain patients...|$|R

40|$|We report {{combined}} IR spectroscopic and quantum mechanical {{studies on}} the interactions between hydrated proton (H 3 O and H 5 O 2) and polyethers (L = 15 -crown- 5, 18 -crown- 6, benzo- 18 -crown- 6 and polyethylene glycols PEG- 400 and PEG- 600) in 1, 2 -dichloroethane (DCE) solution saturated with water, {{in the presence of}} non-coordinating chlorinated cobalt dicarbollide anions. The state of the hydrated proton and composition of the complexes are shown to depend on the nature and concentration of the ligand. Thus, 15 -crown- 5 forms [H 3 OL] and [H 5 O 2 2 L] complexes at small and high concentrations of L, respectively. At all studied concentrations, 18 -crown- 6 and benzo- 18 -crown- 6 form only [H 3 OL] type complexes, whereas PEGs form 1 : 1 complexes with H 5 O 2. The coordination patterns of the hydrated proton depend on the topology, flexibility/rigidity and the number of <b>donor</b> <b>centres</b> of L. In the [H 3 O(18 c 6) ], [H 3 O(B 18 c 6) ] and [H 5 O 2 2 (15 c 5) ] complexes, the hydrated proton forms preferentially O–H OL linear hydrogen bonds. In [H 3 O 15 c 5], H 3 O interacts with all 5 O-atoms of 15 c 5 via one linear and two asymmetric bifurcated H-bonds. We also report the first IR characterization of the [H 5 O 2 4 H 2 O] cation complex in an organic solution...|$|R
