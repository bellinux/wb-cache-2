2500|$|The album's {{message was}} one decrying globalization, yet some critics were {{disappointed}} with the results. Joe McLaughlin notes: [...] "when Pelican claim the record focuses on the 'homogenous effects of globalization', I think I am excused in wanting a touch more than an intricate guitar riff and a thumping bass line to ponder over [...] <b>I</b> <b>struggle</b> to gain a tangible meaning solely from crashing cymbals underpinning distorted guitars." ...|$|E
2500|$|April – The church sent {{a survey}} via email to young single adult members in Utah asking {{among other things}} about their sexual identity. The options were: [...] "I am heterosexual, but <b>I</b> <b>struggle</b> with {{same-sex}} attraction; I am heterosexual and do not struggle with same-sex attraction; Other, please specify." [...] The survey options were criticized as implying that homosexuality doesn't exist and LGBT individuals are straight people who [...] "struggle" [...] with a problem. The question was later changed.|$|E

40|$|The Bedhaya Dirada Metadance is {{performed}} by seven male dancersand {{is a symbol}} of respect to soldiers who have died in battle. The number seven in the Bedhaya Dirada Meta dance is closely related to the philosophy of Mankunegara <b>I’s</b> <b>struggle.</b> The basis of Mankunegara <b>I’s</b> <b>struggle</b> in essence cannot be separated from the concept of leadership of the knights of Mataram which promotes three aspects, namely religion, morality, and culture. Of these three aspects, its seems that the main philosophy used as a basis for Mankunegara <b>I’s</b> <b>struggle</b> is the concept of religious Islamic teachings in order to reach a level of perfection and to draw closer to God the Creator.

2500|$|Shetty {{responded to}} these protests by saying, [...] "I {{understand}} this (kissing) is his (Gere's) culture, not ours. But {{this was not}} a big thing or so obscene for people to overreact in such a manner. <b>I</b> <b>struggle</b> to understand these people's sentiments, but mainly I do not want a foreigner to take bad memories from here." [...] On 26 April 2007, an Indian court in Rajasthan issued a warrant for Shetty and Gere's arrest. A two-judge bench of the Supreme Court headed by the Chief Justice of India subsequently dismissed the suit and suspended the arrest warrants. Gere has since expressed regret for causing any offence and Shetty has said: [...] "so much has been blown out of proportion".|$|E
2500|$|Shantel VanSanten portrays Quinn James, Haley's free {{spirited}} older sister. Fans were unreceptive to {{the character}} at first, but eventually warmed to her. [...] "It's funny. I feel that. <b>I</b> <b>struggle</b> because I take it personally. Obviously, it is a personal thing. Quinn is a character that the writers and myself have developed", said VanSanten. [...] "And {{there was no way}} that I could ever change the way that we started last season where I came into the picture all of a sudden, crying all the time. It was a really emotional thing and it wasn't something that we could really explore a whole lot of. So, I think it was a hard place for people to accept as I came in. I wasn't bubbly and happy. You know?" [...] Quinn is introduced in season 7 when she moves back to Tree Hill after her marriage breaks down.|$|E
2500|$|Kasey Kahne {{took the}} lead on the second Green-White-Checker attempt and held off Matt Kenseth to score his first win of the season. [...] "Yeah, man, it took a lot," [...] said Kahne. [...] "We {{were all over the}} place during the race but the guys stayed with me and worked hard. On those restarts– I didn't know what would happen because I had great restarts all night and <b>I</b> <b>struggle</b> with restarts a lot. That's big, because {{that is one of the}} things you have to be good at and it worked really well tonight. Yeah, we are locked in and I hate it comes down to this Atlanta or Richmond just about every year for me," [...] said Kahne. [...] "Sometimes we are in, {{sometimes}} we are out. But thankful that now at HMS I have been in all three years now." [...] "Those last two laps were really intense," [...] Kenseth said. [...] "Things are looking up. I'm looking forward to the next 11." [...] "I couldn't capitalize, couldn't get the restarts and couldn't accelerate," [...] Denny Hamlin said. [...] "We just came up short. Third is about the place car we had tonight." ...|$|E

"'You also,' said a voice, and {{suddenly}} I was being forced towards the grave. <b>I</b> <b>struggled,</b> shouted, {{appealed to the}} mourners, but they continued stonily following the service; the old clergyman, too, never faltered droning and sniffing through the ritual.
