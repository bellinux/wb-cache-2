5|$|Filipinos {{generally}} {{belong to}} several Asian ethnic groups classified linguistically {{as part of}} the Austronesian or Malayo-Polynesian speaking people. It is believed that thousands of years ago Austronesian-speaking Taiwanese aborigines migrated to the Philippines <b>from</b> <b>Taiwan,</b> bringing with them knowledge of agriculture and ocean-sailing, eventually displacing the earlier Negrito groups of the islands.|$|E
5|$|Black drongos were {{introduced}} {{just before the}} Second World War <b>from</b> <b>Taiwan</b> to the island of Rota {{to help in the}} control of insects. It is believed that they dispersed over the sea to the island of Guam in the 1950s. By 1967, they were the fourth most commonly seen birds in roadside counts on Guam and are today the most abundant bird there. Predation by and competition from black drongos have been suggested as factors in the decline of endemic bird species such as the Rota bridled white-eye and the Guam flycatcher.|$|E
5|$|Boletus auripes has a disjunct distribution, {{and is one}} {{of several}} fungi found in both eastern Asia and eastern North America. In North America, where it is {{relatively}} common, the range of the fungus extends from Alaska south to Mexico, and east to New York. In Central America, it has been recorded in Belize. The mushroom has also been recorded <b>from</b> <b>Taiwan,</b> China (including Yunnan, Sichuan, Guangdong, Kwangsi, and Hunan), and Japan. It was reported for the first time from the Russian Far East in 2008.|$|E

5|$|Ethnic Malays {{which make}} up the {{majority}} population of Malaysia at 50.4%, are an ethnic group of Austronesian people predominantly inhabiting the Malay Peninsula, including the southernmost parts of Thailand, {{the east coast of}} Sumatra, the coast of Borneo, and the smaller islands which lie between these locations. The true origin of ethnic Malays is still the subject of studies among historians, anthropologists and linguists. A popular theory suggested that the people who spoke Austronesian languages first arrived in Maritime Southeast Asia between 2,500BCE and 1,500BCE, as a part of Austronesian expansion <b>from</b> <b>Taiwan</b> to South East Asia.|$|E

5|$|In September 1988, {{during the}} 20th anniversary celebration of Evergreen Marine Corporation's founding, company {{chairman}} Chang Yung-fa announced his company's intentions to establish Taiwan's first private international airline. The {{opportunity to create}} a major Taiwanese airline had just arisen following {{a decision by the}} Taiwanese government to liberalise the country's air transportation system. Government requirements still mandated global experience and financial capital requirements for any company seeking permission to initiate international airline service <b>from</b> <b>Taiwan.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{outbreak}} was {{the third}} instance of H5N1 detected in the United Kingdom. The first outbreak occurred in October 2005 among exotic birds imported <b>from</b> <b>Taiwan</b> and South America at a privately owned quarantine facility in Essex, England. The second instance involved a dead whooper swan found to have the virus in Cellardyke, Scotland in April 2006. A corresponding incidence {{on a farm in}} south-eastern Hungary was confirmed by the European Commission on 25 January 2007.|$|E
5|$|Theoretically, other true {{compounds}} may be possible, such as helium fluorohydride (HHeF) {{which would}} be analogous to HArF, discovered in 2000. Calculations show that two new compounds containing a helium-oxygen bond could be stable. Two new molecular species, predicted using theory, CsFHeO and N(CH3)4FHeO, are derivatives of a metastable FHeO− anion first theorized in 2005 by a group <b>from</b> <b>Taiwan.</b> If confirmed by experiment, the only remaining element with no known stable compounds would be neon.|$|E

5|$|There {{are several}} {{opposing}} theories regarding {{the origins of}} ancient Filipinos. F. Landa Jocano theorizes that the ancestors of the Filipinos evolved locally. Wilhelm Solheim's Island Origin Theory postulates that the peopling of the archipelago transpired via trade networks originating in the Sundaland area around 48,000 to 5000BC rather than by wide-scale migration. The Austronesian Expansion Theory explains that Malayo-Polynesians coming <b>from</b> <b>Taiwan</b> began migrating to the Philippines around 4000BC, displacing earlier arrivals.|$|E
5|$|Leccinum holopus is a {{mycorrhizal}} species. It fruits on {{the ground}} (often among Sphagnum moss), singly to scattered in wet areas like cedar swamps, bogs, or soggy forests. Like most Leccinum species, the fungus is highly host-specific and associates with birch (Betula). In North America, the range of Leccinum holopus extends from eastern Canada to New York, extending west to the northern Rocky Mountains, roughly coinciding with {{the distribution of the}} paper birch (Betula papyrifera). In this range, it is common and fruits from August to October. L.holopus var. americanum is known only from North America. The fungus is rare in southern Europe, but more common in the Sphagnum swamps in the north. In Asia, it has been recorded <b>from</b> <b>Taiwan</b> and Qinghai (China).|$|E
5|$|On June21, {{officials}} in China closed Xiamen port {{and stated that}} it would resume operations once the storm passed. Later that day 33,000 vessels sought refuge at port. Following the issuance of a land warning, government offices and schools were closed throughout the island. Officials sent 10 million text messages to residents throughout Fujian Province to warn them about the approaching storm. In Hong Kong, public warning signal number one was raised for nearly 24hours as Linfa briefly threatened the city on June20. Officials also evacuated roughly 160,000 people from coastal areas in Fujian. A total of 167 flights to and <b>from</b> <b>Taiwan</b> were canceled or delayed due to the storm.|$|E

5|$|Winners {{for artistic}} and {{traditional}} music categories were announced on June 21, 2008 at Taipei County Hall {{in a ceremony}} separate from that for popular music categories. It was the second consecutive year that the ceremony for this category group was held separately, {{and it did not}} attract as much media attention as the ceremony for the popular music categories. By contrast, artists <b>from</b> <b>Taiwan,</b> Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, Japan, and Canada attended the awards ceremony for popular music categories, which was held at the Taipei Arena on July 5, 2008. Actress sisters Barbie and Dee Shu, former news anchor Patty Hou, and actress Matilda Tao hosted this event, whose list of award presenters included Canadian recording artist Daniel Powter and Japanese drama stars Akito Kiriyama, Junta Nakama, and Yuya Takaki. Both events were broadcast on the satellite cable Azio Television channel on June 28 and July 5, respectively.|$|E
5|$|The {{blacktip reef shark}} {{is found}} {{throughout}} nearshore waters of the tropical and subtropical Indo-Pacific. In the Indian Ocean, it occurs from South Africa to the Red Sea, including Madagascar, Mauritius, and the Seychelles, and from there eastward {{along the coast of}} the Indian Subcontinent to Southeast Asia, including Sri Lanka, the Andaman Islands, and the Maldives. In the Pacific Ocean, it is found from southern China and the Philippines to Indonesia, northern Australia and New Caledonia, and also inhabits numerous oceanic islands, including the Marshall, Gilbert, Society, and Hawaiian Islands and Tuamotu. Contrary to what most sources state, there is a report suggesting that the specimens of this species from Japanese waters might be <b>from</b> <b>Taiwan,</b> however a number of sightings and captures of this species have been reported from the inshore waters of Ishigaki Island of Okinawa Prefecture in southern Japan. A Lessepsian migrant, this shark has colonized the eastern Mediterranean Sea by way of the Suez Canal.|$|E
5|$|Tensions between Japan and China {{heightened}} {{after the}} former launched its punitive expedition against Taiwan in May 1874 in retaliation {{of the murder}} of a number of shipwrecked sailors by the Paiwan aborigines. China inquired into the possibility of buying ironclad warships from Great Britain and Japan was already negotiating with the Brazilian government about the purchase of the ironclad Independencia then under construction in Britain. The Japanese terminated the negotiations with the Brazilians in October after the ship was badly damaged upon launching and the expeditionary force was about to withdraw <b>from</b> <b>Taiwan.</b> The crisis illustrated the need to reinforce the IJN and a budget request was submitted that same month by Acting Navy Minister Kawamura Sumiyoshi for ¥3.9–4.2 million to purchase three warships from abroad. No Japanese shipyard was able to build ships of this size so they were ordered from Great Britain. This was rejected as too expensive and a revised request of ¥2.3 million was approved later that month. Nothing was done until March 1875 when Kawamura proposed to buy one ironclad for half of the money authorized and use the rest for shipbuilding and gun production at the Yokosuka Shipyard. No response was made by the Prime Minister's office before the proposal was revised to use all of the allocated money to buy three ships, one armored frigate and two armored corvettes of composite construction to be designed by the prominent British naval architect Sir Edward Reed, formerly the Chief Constructor of the Royal Navy. Reed would also supervise the construction of the ships for an honorarium of five percent of the construction cost. The Prime Minister's office approved the revised proposal on 2 May and notified the Japanese consul, Ueno Kagenori, that navy officers would be visiting to negotiate the contract with Reed.|$|E
