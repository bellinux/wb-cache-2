25|$|Some gowns {{may have}} 'strings' (i.e. <b>grosgrain</b> ribbons) {{attached}} to them behind the lapels. These in the past were tied together to hold the gown together but are now merely indicators of rank, such as in Cambridge where strings indicate one {{is a graduate of}} the university (rather than a graduate student whose undergraduate degree was awarded at a different institution), or just for decoration.|$|E
25|$|People {{who choose}} to buy their dress may opt for finer fabrics, such as poplin, <b>grosgrain,</b> percale, cotton, wool, cassimere, broadcloth, Russell cord, or corded/ribbed material. For silk, there are a range of types {{including}} artificial silk/rayon, Ottoman (i.e. ribbed or corded silk), taffeta, satin, alpaca, true silk, shot silk, or a mixture. Pure Ottoman silk is rarely used except for official gowns, as it is very expensive. Some gowns may be trimmed with gimp lace, cords, buttons, {{or other forms of}} decoration.|$|E
25|$|Standard fibres {{used for}} the frock coat {{included}} wool and vicuña. The most common weave was known as broadcloth. The standard colour of a frock coat was solid black, but later, in the Victorian era, charcoal grey became an acceptable but less common alternative and Midnight Blue was an even rarer alternative colour. For business and festive occasions the revers was lined with black silk facings (either satin or <b>grosgrain).</b> For funerals black frock coats without self-faced revers were worn with a matching black waistcoat.|$|E
2500|$|A {{jacket with}} silk facings (usually <b>grosgrain</b> or satin) on a shawl lapel, peaked lapel or notched lapel. [...] Many current fashion stylists and writers see notched lapels as less formal {{although}} they (like peaked and shawl) were used (though somewhat rarely) {{in some of}} the early forms of the garment.|$|E
2500|$|A cummerbund may be {{worn with}} a dinner jacket {{in lieu of}} a {{waistcoat}} and, although it is considered slightly less formal, it is equally correct. It looks especially good with a shawl collar dinner jacket but may be worn in conjunction with peak lapels. The material of the cummerbund should be silk satin, <b>grosgrain</b> (or faille), or barathea to match that of the bow tie. [...] It features upward facing folds, which were originally used to store theatre or opera tickets, and are now considered to be more decorative than functional. Just like the waistcoat, cummerbunds are not worn with a double breasted jacket.|$|E
2500|$|The most {{formal and}} {{traditional}} shoes are patent leather opera pumps (court shoes) decorated with <b>grosgrain</b> bows. The more popular alternative currently {{is the black}} lace-up Oxford shoe, in patent leather or calfskin, with a rounded plain toe. Brogueing or any other decorative patterns should never be seen on Black Tie footwear. Matte finish pumps are also seen. [...] Shoes are almost invariably black and patent leather is considered more formal than matte finishes while pumps are considered more formal than lace-ups. Generally considered too informal for black tie are shoes with open lacing, such as the Derby shoe (bluchers in American English). Notable alternatives include the black button boot (primarily of historical interest only) and the monogrammed Albert slipper which was originally worn only at home. The black Gucci loafer in leather is also considered as an alternative, especially in urban British settings. Hosiery is black socks made from fine wool or silk.|$|E
2500|$|In 1932, The Guardian {{reported}} on a trend for frocks based around designs by the French Impressionists, adding: [...] "There {{is no reason why}} they should look any more ridiculous than the Empress Eugénie hats that every other woman was wearing a few months ago". [...] In 1933, The Times reported that milliners were drawing on both the 18th century and the Second French Empire for inspiration, singling out Suzanne Talbot as showing styles similar to Empress Eugénie's riding hats and designs with trims turned up sharply on one side. A wide variety of materials were being used, including taffetas, straw and <b>grosgrain.</b> A year later, the Eugénie hat was still being adapted as part of new season's millinery designs, but now showing more of women's hairstyles: [...] "Hats are halo-like or sailor-like, but with considerable flatness. The idea is now to show the hair and the Eugenie hats, which are tipped forward over the nose, indicate that more and more hair is expected {{at the back of the}} head".|$|E
2500|$|The ruby {{slippers}} play {{an integral}} {{role in the}} 1985 Walt Disney Pictures film Return to Oz, for which Disney had to obtain rights from MGM to use reproductions in the film. Unlike the originals, the hand-made British spool-heeled shoes for Return to Oz were covered in hundreds of dark red crystals. The stones were soaked in sulfuric acid to remove the silver backing, and two types of glue were used to affix them to the shoes (a spray glue and an optical glue). No matter what was done, the stones kept falling off during filming. Stagehands were specifically hired to sweep up loose [...] "rubies" [...] that would fall off the slippers after a scene was shot. Being little girls, actresses Fairuza Balk who played Dorothy and Emma Ridley who played Princess Ozma, simply could not keep from playing, skipping and tapping their heels, so eventually {{they were required to}} take off the slippers between takes. Effects were later added in post production to give the slippers their magical glow. Simple, red <b>grosgrain</b> ribbon with additional stones were used for the bows. Seven pairs were made for the filming: two pairs, size one, for Ridley, three size twos for Balk and two men's size 11 for the Nome King played by actor Nicol Williamson.|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} and most formal model of dinner jacket is the single-breasted model. The typical black-tie jacket is single-breasted with one button only, with [...] and is of black or midnight blue; usually of wool or a wool–mohair, or wool-polyester blend, although other materials, especially silk, are seen. Although other materials are used, {{the most appropriate}} and traditional for the dinner jacket are wool barathea or superfine herringbone. Double breasted models are less common, but considered equally appropriate. Dinner jackets were commonly ventless before World War I, but today come ventless, with side vents, or with center vents. The ventless style is considered more formal, whilst the centre vent is the least formal. The lapels (traditionally pointed and shawl) are usually faced with silk in either a <b>grosgrain</b> or a satin weave, but can also be silk barathea. According to the Black Tie Guide, the peaked lapel and shawl collar are equally authentic and correct. The buttons should be covered in similarly coloured material to {{the main part of}} the jacket, which would ideally be either self-faced or covered with the same material as the lapels. Some higher-end single-breasted jackets, both new and vintage, tend to be fastened with a link front closure which is visually similar to a cufflink; this method of closure is still common in the United Kingdom.|$|E
60|$|And {{outside the}} church, oh, my brothers, surged and heaved {{the rank and}} file of the tribe of Rubberers. In two bodies they were, with the <b>grosgrain</b> carpet and cops with clubs between. They crowded like cattle, they fought, they pressed and surged and swayed and trampled one another to see a bit of a girl in a white veil acquire license to go through a man's pockets while he sleeps.|$|E
60|$|The {{church was}} lighted. A <b>grosgrain</b> carpet lay over the asphalt {{to the edge}} of the sidewalk. Bridesmaids were patting one another's sashes awry and {{speaking}} of the Bride's freckles. Coachmen tied white ribbons on their whips and bewailed the space of time between drinks. The minister was musing over his possible fee, essaying conjecture whether it would suffice to purchase a new broadcloth suit for himself and a photograph of Laura Jane Libbey for his wife. Yea, Cupid was in the air.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Grosgrain</b> , also gros-grain and, rarely, gros grain, {{is a type}} {{of fabric}} {{characterized}} by its ribbed appearance. In <b>grosgrain,</b> the weft is heavier than the warp, creating prominent transverse ribs. It is called a [...] "corded" [...] fabric since the weft resembles a fine cord. <b>Grosgrain</b> is a plain weave corded fabric, with heavier cords than in poplin but lighter than in faille. <b>Grosgrain</b> has a very dull appearance with little luster but is very strong. It is a firm, close-woven, fine-corded fabric. While <b>grosgrain</b> fabric is generally black, it can be many different colors, and <b>grosgrain</b> ribbon comes in a large variety of colors and patterns.|$|E
50|$|<b>Grosgrain</b> is {{also used}} in millinery. <b>Grosgrain</b> ribbons are popular {{creating}} ribbon decorations for hats (made into flowers, for example), however <b>grosgrain</b> is most notably used in top hats and opera hats, or as the trimming band on the Homburg.|$|E
50|$|Lustrous <b>grosgrain</b> is used {{extensively}} to join female semi-detached clothing articles such as bodices to skirts and similar, where this necessary joint may be visible. Ribbed <b>grosgrain</b> {{may be used}} similarly to twill tape for internal gussets and reinforcements. <b>Grosgrain</b> ribbon is often used for facings and for waistbands. Using a <b>grosgrain</b> ribbon facing for waistbands is faster and uses less fabric. It is also works especially well with bulky fabrics.|$|E
50|$|Throughout the 1920s {{the term}} {{seems to have}} {{remained}} true to original definition as a garment fabric. However, circa 1920s it fell out of favor as a garment fabric and was defined identically to contemporary terminology as a <b>grosgrain</b> ribbon. While <b>grosgrain</b> fabric is almost always black, <b>grosgrain</b> ribbon comes in a large variety of colors and printed patterns.|$|E
5000|$|Whereas a <b>grosgrain</b> watch band {{is quite}} a simple design {{consisting}} of a nylon <b>grosgrain</b> ribbon with a center bar buckle or other simple buckle style and a matching <b>grosgrain</b> keeper {{at one end and}} punched holes on the other, a so-called [...] "NATO" [...] strap has a very specific design which is most readily distinguished by the existence of a pair of metal keepers, something not found on a simple <b>grosgrain</b> watchband. Strictly speaking, a [...] "NATO" [...] strap would be one that has a NATO stock number which uniquely identifies it for requisitioning purposes much the way item or part numbers identify goods found in any shopping catalog.|$|E
50|$|Moire is a waved or {{watered effect}} {{produced}} especially on <b>grosgrain</b> silk and woolen moreen via engraved rollers and high pressure on carded material. The {{end result is}} a peculiar luster which works best when made from a corded fabric like <b>grosgrain.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Grosgrain</b> {{that does}} have some luster is a very popular fabric {{especially}} for ribbons, which are used to ornament and decorate clothing. As <b>grosgrain</b> has less luster than burnished silk or satin it is very popular with and common in evening wear because {{it is seen as}} less [...] "flashy", though silk and satin (which is a different weave, as opposed to a fiber such as silk) can commonly be found on day wear. Although <b>grosgrain</b> may actually be made of silk, it is often erroneously referred to as a separate fabric.|$|E

50|$|As a {{more subtle}} option to lustrous satin, <b>grosgrain</b> is very popular with evening wear, used on the facings of lapels of most dress coats and {{high-end}} dinner jackets and tuxedos. <b>Grosgrain</b> is traditionally used to hem and highlight the cut of lapel, collar and visible outermost edges of the formal frock coat and the later morning coat. Hemmed frock-coats, as described, {{may be seen in}} the film Gone with the Wind noted for its historically accurate costume. <b>Grosgrain</b> is preferred over satin for practicality—it does not wear as easily as delicate silk or satin, as the threads do not snag as easily (on a ring or keys, for instance). <b>Grosgrain</b> is also used for matching accessories such as bow ties and cummerbunds, though these are often in barathea to complement the main suiting while still avoiding the glare of satin, increasingly gaining a 'flashy' image.|$|E

50|$|<b>Grosgrain</b> {{made out}} of cotton or {{low-cost}} synthetic such as polyester is very common for gift-wrap ribbons, or for decorating and ornamenting scrapbooks and greeting cards. It {{can be used for}} many different crafts as well, from bead making, to book-binding, to trimming or embellishing, as well as a multitude of other uses. <b>Grosgrain</b> ribbon is the primary ribbon material used in the hair bow industry.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Grosgrain</b> {{is similar}} to Ottoman but it is thinner and lighter than Ottoman and is used mostly for ribbons.|$|E
5000|$|A {{particular}} {{characteristic of}} <b>grosgrain</b> ribbon {{is that the}} thicker weft resists longitudinal curling and so it exerts an even pressure when tied around crushable materials. Nylon <b>grosgrain</b> is often used as heavy-duty webbing or binding around luggage, packs, messenger bags and other heavy use [...] "soft" [...] goods. It is also used for securing cargo. It can be dyed and is available {{in a variety of}} colours (though again usually black).|$|E

50|$|Hats are an {{important}} part of a male's costume, and can come in two forms: the traditional Pannonian hat (škrlak) is black and dome-shaped, with a red wool band embroidered with multi-colored thread and white and gold dots attached, or the black felt box-hat (šešir) folded into a flat bow at the back with a <b>grosgrain</b> ribbon tied around the body. Over the <b>grosgrain</b> ribbon, red, white and blue strings are often tied around the hat (e.g. the Croatian tri-color).|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} {{contemporary}} use of ribbed <b>grosgrain</b> is in hems {{where it may}} be elasticized or not, especially of polo shirts, T-shirts and underwear.|$|E
