Access {{to the car}} was by platforms with lattice gates at their ends and <b>hand</b> <b>operated</b> sliding doors on the car sides. Later some trailer cars were fitted with driving controls and two and three car trains operated from Mill Hill Park to Hounslow and South Harrow and later Uxbridge until they were withdrawn in 1925.|$|E

25|$|Timber coffer dams were constructed; {{they were}} 76ft 6in by 29ft with two skins, {{the space between}} being filled with puddle clay. James Nasmyth had a novel design of steam pile driver; it had first been used in Devonport Docks in 1845; it could deliver 60 to 70 blows a minute; the cycle time with the <b>hand</b> <b>operated</b> pile drivers {{formerly}} in use was four minutes. The drop weight was 1½ tons and its stroke was 2ft 9in; one was purchased from Nasmyth.|$|E
25|$|Lift netters – are {{equipped}} to operate lift nets, which are held from the vessel's side and raised and lowered {{by means of}} outriggers. Lift netters range from open boats about 10 metres long to larger vessels with open ocean capability. Decked vessels usually have the bridge amidships. Larger vessels are often equipped with winches and derricks for handling the lifting lines, as well as outriggers and light booms. They can be fitted with powerful lights to attract and aggregate the fish to the surface. Open boats are usually unmechanized or use <b>hand</b> <b>operated</b> winches. Electronic equipment, such as fishfinders, sonar and echo sounders are used extensively on larger boats.|$|E
25|$|Samuel Crompton of Bolton {{combined}} {{elements of}} the spinning jenny and water frame in 1779, creating the spinning mule. This mule produced a stronger thread than the water frame could. Thus in 1780, there were two viable <b>hand</b> <b>operated</b> spinning system that could be easily adapted to run by power of water. As early mules were suitable for producing yarn {{for use in the}} manufacture of muslin, and which were known as the muslin wheel or the Hall i' th' Wood (pronounced Hall-ith-wood) wheel. As with Kay and Hargreaves, Crompton was not able to exploit his invention for his own profit, and died a pauper.|$|E

25|$|To be an {{efficient}} manufacturing facility, a loomshop needed good daylight, controlled ventilation, un-obstructed space, provision for storage, heat, and access for goods and workers. Hand looms were manual, the artisan raised the heddles using foot levers, {{and threw the}} shuttle {{the width of the}} loom by hand, forward and back. The left hand was used to operate the batten that compressed the pick. Broader cloth could not be woven this way, so the weaver used a child to throw back the shuttle. John Kay's flying shuttle of 1733, removed the need for the child. The weaver jerked the two hammers or pickers with a picking stick held in the right hand. The pickers propelled the shuttle, and the left <b>hand</b> <b>operated</b> the batten.|$|E
25|$|Powered operation. On large modern canals, {{especially}} {{very large}} ones such as ship canals, the gates and paddles are {{too large to}} be <b>hand</b> <b>operated,</b> and are operated by hydraulic or electrical equipment. On the Caledonian Canal the lock gates were operated by man-powered capstans, one connected by chains to open the gate and another to draw it closed. By 1968 these {{had been replaced by}} hydraulic power acting through steel rams. Even on smaller canals, some gates and paddles are electrically operated, particularly if the lock is regularly staffed by professional lock keepers. On the River Thames below Oxford all the locks are staffed and powered. Powered locks are usually still filled by gravity, though some very large locks use pumps to speed things up.|$|E
25|$|During the First World War Richardson, in his {{position}} as Chief Constable, issued instructions about introducing, the Keep Left Rule, Traffic Signals and the Police Identity Parade. All motor and horse drawn traffic must drive on the Left hand side of the road. This was mandatory and not optional. Coloured lights at busy road junctions were introduced into Halifax, {{being one of the}} first Boroughs to do so. There were two lights for each road, one red for Danger (red as it was considered to be the best colour to penetrate fog and haze) and green for Go. These two colours were used by the railways and instantly recognizable by the population. They were attached to tram poles and <b>hand</b> <b>operated</b> by a Constable. This is thought to be possibly one of the first uses of traffic lights in the country. London had used semaphore signals, the first sited at Charing Cross, but they were never considered to be effective.|$|E
50|$|The Skeksis were {{full-bodied}} puppets {{operated in}} a very similar way to Big Bird.

25|$|A decree of 23 March 1982 {{listed the}} offices {{responsible}} for testing lifting equipment other than lifts and building-site hoists, while a decree issued in May {{that same year}} 1982 extended its provisions to agriculture. Under a decree of 31 March 1982, the general health and safety regulations for dangerous machinery and appliances were extended to include portable <b>hand</b> <b>operated</b> machinery and appliances. Exceptions for certain less dangerous appliances were laid down in a decree of June 1982. In regards to the agricultural sector, a decree of 8 March 1982 laid down the conditions attached to the approval of electrical installations in agricultural undertakings and specified which offices are authorized to test these installations. In 1983, leave was introduced for setting up businesses and sabbatical leave for wage-earners, and in June that year, a law was passed that completed the incorporation into French Law of a 1977 European Council Directive on the approximation {{of the laws of}} the Member States relating to the safeguarding of employees' rights in the event of transfers of undertakings, businesses or parts of businesses.|$|E

[...] Both the ADU-253A/B and ADU-272A/B are listed as being used in combat, with no mention of combat drops of CBU-68/Bs. [...] In addition to the offensive armament, two <b>hand</b> <b>operated</b> flare launchers were initially provided, until LAU-74/A automatic launchers could be supplied. Besides the automated nature of the LAU-74/A, the unit only required one loadmaster to operate it.|$|E

2500|$|The single engine, tandem, {{two seat}} I-12 was a {{development}} of the similarly laid out I-11, strengthened for aerobatics. It was an all wood low wing monoplane, entirely plywood covered apart from the tail control surfaces and with a fixed, conventional undercarriage. Its cantilever wing was built around a main and an auxiliary box spar, both made from spruce and plywood. The short wing centre section was integral with the fuselage, with the main undercarriage legs on it. [...] These and the wheels, fitted with brakes, were faired. [...] Outboard, the wing panels tapered to rounded tips, carrying both the balanced and slotted differential ailerons and <b>hand</b> <b>operated</b> camber changing split flaps.|$|E
2500|$|Wine presses are {{generally}} classified into two types—batch and continuous. Batch presses involve pressing a set amount (a [...] "batch") of grapes {{with the press}} needing to be emptied of the pomace or [...] "cake" [...] (the leftover skins, seeds and stems) between batches. There are many different styles of batch presses ranging from simple <b>hand</b> <b>operated</b> basket presses to computerized membrane presses and presses that are [...] "opened" [...] with oxygen able to {{come into contact with}} the must or [...] "enclosed" [...] in a tank that allows for anaerobic winemaking. Continuous presses use a helical screw (such as an auger) or belt that transports the grapes from a feed in across a cylindrical screen or between air pressured filled pads that presses the grapes, compacts the cakes and then removes the cake through an output all in one continuous operation.|$|E
2500|$|In 1868, {{long before}} the advent of powered {{aircraft}} flight — and within a decade of the birth of both Orville and Wilbur Wright — Boulton patented the first aileron. [...] The aileron system he created was to be actuated by either a <b>hand</b> <b>operated</b> control (not illustrated on the patent's drawings) or by an automatic pendulum control device (depicted on the patent's drawing sheet), with the intended function of a single-axis autopilot. Boulton's inspiration for a lateral flight control device has been attributed to French Count Ferdinand Charles Honore Phillipe d'Esterno, whose detailed analysis of flapping and soaring bird flight, Du Vol des Oiseaux (On the flight of birds) was published as a pamphlet in 1864. Although Boulton's prescient aileron control system was fully functional, he, as did almost everyone of his era, lacked a detailed understanding of aerodynamics, and an airplane he designed never achieved flight.|$|E
