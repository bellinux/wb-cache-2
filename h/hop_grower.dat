40|$|The {{quality of}} hops is {{significantly}} {{affected by the}} content of alpha bitter acids. Maintaining it with minimum losses lies within the competence of both the <b>hop</b> <b>grower</b> and processor depending on how they follow the optimum harvest technology, storage conditions, and post-harvest hop processing. That indicator is considerably affected by the hop storage method, i. e. whether the warehouse is air-conditioned or not, {{as well as the}} storage duration. The alpha bitter acid content should not be reduced during storage. The objective of this paper is an analysis of the alpha bitter acid content in the Saaz hop variety in a technological sequence of operations starting with drying at the grower and finishing with six-month storing at the processor, with three storage variants: an air-conditioned warehouse, non-conditioned warehouse, and a variant in which the square bale is moved after 60 days from a non-conditioned warehouse into an air-conditioned warehouse. The analysis of samples to identify the alpha bitter acid content was carried out by means of the ASBC Hops- 6 and the HPLC EBC 7. 7 methods. Practically in all cases the alpha content declines, although if a square bale is placed in an air-conditioned warehouse this decline is the lowest depending on the storage duration. The economic analysis shows a significant profit referring to the price of alpha contained in 1 t of hops stored in an air-conditioned warehouse. At the date of 1 / 11 / 2015 this profit was 14 706 CZK, at the date of 4 / 1 / 2016 it was 7646 CZK, and at 1 / 3 / 2016 the profit was 6587 CZK...|$|E

40|$|The {{demand for}} locally sourced hops from Northeastern microbreweries began the recent {{resurgence}} in local hop production.

There was a sharp {{increase in the number of}} Northeast hop producers from six in 2009 to over 175 in 2014. <b>Hop</b> <b>growers</b> in the Northeast are new to the crop and have limited experience with pest identification and management. This dissertation encompasses three research projects that were conducted over the 2012 - 2014 growing seasons. These projects were the first critical steps taken to develop arthropod integrated pest management (IPM) tactics for Northeastern <b>hop</b> <b>growers.</b> First, the arthropod community in seven Vermont hop yards was evaluated. The objectives of Chapter 2 are to 1) present current hop pest biology and management strategies, 2) report the phenology of arthropod pests observed over three growing seasons, 3) report abundance and peak date for each pest, and 4) document natural enemy abundance in Vermont hop yards. The survey indicates that in cool, wet seasons hop aphid (Phorodon humuli Schrank) is expected to be a pest of concern. Two-spotted spider mite (Tetranychus urticae Koch) is expected to be a pest of concern in hot, dry conditions. Potato leafhopper (Empoasca fabae Harris) is an unpredictable pest of special concern for first year hop plants. When hop aphid or potato leafhopper are sprayed for with broad-spectrum insecticide, two-spotted spider mite secondary outbreak can be expected. Second, the abundance of major arthropod pests and their natural enemy groups were evaluated under drive row flowering cover crop treatments. The objectives of this study were to 1) measure the effect of cover crops on natural enemy group abundance, 2) measure the effect of cover crops on the three major Northeastern hop pests, and 3) measure the effect of cover crop presence on hop yield and quality. Natural enemy groups and pests were positively correlated yet cover crop treatments had no significant effect on natural enemy abundance. Red clover cover crop treatments served as a trap crop for potato leafhopper. No significant difference in hop yield or quality was observed between flowering cover crop treatments. Finally, potato leafhopper is a documented but understudied regional pest of hops. The objectives of this study were to 1) measure the physiological response of eight hop cultivars to adult potato leafhopper feeding and 2) measure hop leaf recovery from potato leafhopper injury. Gas exchange (net photosynthesis and transpiration) and chlorophyll content were measured to quantify injury by adult potato leafhopper to first year hop leaves in field and greenhouse studies. Cultivars did not vary significantly in their physiological response to potato leafhopper feeding. Injury significantly reduced gas exchange measures in the field (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) and greenhouse (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) and when leafhoppers were removed, gas exchange was restored...|$|R

Change in the chemical composition of hops during plant maturation is a dynamic process requiring a comprehensive chemical and sensory analysis in order to maximize the characteristics of interest to brewers. The effect of harvest date, location, and cultivar on key chemical components of Willamette and Cascade hops was investigated for the 2010 and 2011 growing seasons. Hops were harvested at 3 time points (Early, Typical, and Late), within a 3 -week interval from 2 different farms in the Willamette Valley, Oregon. A split-plot experimental design for each cultivar was used; each farm represented a main plot and harvest years were designated as subplots. American Society of Brewing Chemist standard methods of analysis were used to measure moisture content, hop acids and their homologs, hop storage index, total essential oil content and volatile profile by GC-FID. Additionally, difference testing, descriptive analysis, and consumer acceptance testing was conducted using beers brewed with either Typical or Late harvested Cascade hops from the 2010 harvest year. The response of analytes was dependent on the cultivar being examined, its location within the Willamette Valley, as well as timing of harvest. Hop acids did not change appreciably during plant maturation for the period examined, while hop oil content increased. Increases in oil quantity were strongly correlated (r > 0. 90) with increases in α-pinene, β-pinene, myrcene, limonene, methyl heptanoate, and linalool concentrations.

40|$|The {{uniqueness}} of the agricultural pursuit of hop growing lies in its very high input costs and related agglomerative tendencies; the interest for this study lies in the predictable fluctuations in the area planted to the crop, deriving as they do from a complex of market-related and industry-behaviour considerations. Physical requirements for the crop are relatively narrow, but more important causes of local specialization have traditionally derived from the industrial use of the crop and the centralizing of certain processing facilities, particularly as these affect smaller producers. The attraction of the perennial crop for producers of even a hectare or less derives from the prospect of highly profitable returns; a prospect frequently not fulfilled. The hop plant, Humulus lupulus, has earned its reputation as a gambler's crop; the balance between fixed input costs, variable yields and prices for the commodity periodically has favoured costs over returns, leading to cyclical changes in total planted area and {{in the number of}} <b>hop</b> <b>growers.</b> _ The spatial expression of such fluctuations is seen in the emergence of a core area of production within which land-use intensity for the crop has remained relatively unchanged for over a century. Beyond the core, the extensive margins of production exhibit cyclical expansion and contraction, at times including localities as widely spaced as Flinders Island and Strahan; but the forces leading to concentration and specialization within the industry have tended to confine production increasingly to the Derwent Valley and minor localities in the south of the state until the last two decades. Since 1960, a major new production region has emerged in the north-east of the state, reflecting changed economies of scale brought about by improved hop varieties and technological developments. The new hops have higher brewing value, thereby reducing the relative demand from brewers; smaller, more traditional growers in the south of the state {{have not been able to}} compete with the lower unit production costs of larger growers and have ceased production almost entirely. The central argument of the thesis is that the industry approach, particularly involving detailed study of production on individual farms, is a valuable contribution towards the understanding of patterns of agricultural land use as a whole. The study examines the industry in its historical and contemporary contexts and demonstrates the interrelatedness of physical and economic constraints to production. It considers the nature of political and behavioural influences and their respective impact on the spatial arrangement of the industry...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2005 Hop powdery mildew, {{caused by}} Podosphaera macularis Braun & Takamatsu (formerly Sphaerotheca macularis (Wallr. :Fr.) Lind, syn. S. humuli (DC.) Burrill) was not {{observed}} in Pacific Northwest hop yards until 1997, when it was discovered in Washington. Within one year, it had spread to Oregon and Idaho. This emerging disease caused severe economic losses to <b>hop</b> <b>growers,</b> {{due in part to}} the lack of resistance incorporated into commercial varieties. Despite several collection trips that increased the amount of wild hop (Humulus lupulus L.) germplasm available to researchers, there was no knowledge of its potential as a resource for resistance to P. macularis. The objectives of this study were: 1) to collect previously unrepresented native hop seed from the Southwestern United States, 2) to evaluate wild hop germplasm for resistance to P. macularis, and 3) to microscopically examine the progression of powdery mildew on different hop genotypes. Plant collecting expeditions were taken in September of 2002 and 2003 to obtain wild American hop germplasm (H. l. var. neomexicanus) from Colorado, Arizona, and New Mexico. During these expeditions, 60 seedlots and 28 plant accessions were obtained. This germplasm was deposited at the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Agricultural Research Service (ARS), National Clonal Germplasm Repository (NCGR), located in Corvallis, Oregon. More than 2, 100 wild (1563 North American and 107 Kazakhstani) hop seedlings, from 54 seedlots were evaluated for powdery mildew resistance. The number of resistant seedlings observed when greenhouse temperatures were > 30 °C was 218. The number of resistant seedlings decreased to 62 when greenhouse temperatures were 30 °C) prior to inoculation. The development of P. macularis on several native North American and Kazakhstani hop genotypes was observed using direct light microscopy. The disease progressed slower on native genotypes than on the susceptible H. l. 'Symphony'. Conidia on the resistant cultivar 'Nugget' produced only the primary germ tube prior to shriveling. On 3 infected native Kazakhstani genotypes, epidermal cells at the center of the colony began to collapse at 120 h, forming a lesion that continued to radiate outward. Fungal hyphae then shriveled in response to epidermal collapse. As a result of this work, new sources of resistance to powdery mildew were identified. A high percentage of resistant seedlings were observed in specific lots from Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and North Dakota. Resistant genotypes from North America and Kazakhstan may lead to germplasm releases for use in hop breeding programs. The partial resistance observed in wild hops suggests that multiple genes are involved. This type of resistance would be more durable than single gene resistance, which is easily overcome by the evolution of more virulent pathotypes...|$|R

Of the raw ingredients that go into making beer, hops {{are perhaps the most}} costly. Considerable resources are required to grow quality hops, and therefore, brewers and <b>hop</b> <b>growers</b> alike have a common goal of obtaining the highest quality hops possible. However, quality can be a relative term. While it is commonly agreed upon that high brewing values, such as α-acids and essential oil content, and robust structural integrity are indicators of quality hops, there are many opinions of the ideal aroma. Changes in the chemical composition of hops during plant maturation are a dynamic process requiring a comprehensive, in-depth chemical and sensory analysis in order to maximize the characteristics of interest to brewers. The complex aroma chemistry associated with hops in beer has been a confounding variable for the practical brewer, and a deeper understanding of hop aroma development during cultivation is needed. The effect of harvest date, location, and cultivar on key chemical components of Willamette and Cascade hops was investigated for the 2010 and 2011 growing seasons. Hops were harvested at 3 time points (Early, Typical, and Late), within a 3 -week interval from 2 different farms in the Willamette Valley, Oregon. A split-plot experimental design for each cultivar was used; each farm represented a main plot and harvest years were designated as subplots. American Society of Brewing Chemist standard methods of analysis were used to measure moisture content, hop acids and their homologs, Hop Storage Index, total essential oil content and volatile profile by GC-FID. Additionally, difference testing, descriptive analysis, and consumer acceptance testing was conducted using beers brewed with either Typical or Late harvested Cascade hops from the 2010 harvest year. The response of analytes was dependent on the cultivar being examined, its location within the Willamette Valley, as well as days until harvest. Hop acids did not change appreciably during plant maturation for the period examined, while hop oil content increased hyperbolically to a plateau as the hops aged on the bine. Increases in oil quantity were strongly correlated (r > 0. 90) with increases in α-pinene, β-pinene, myrcene, limonene, methyl heptanoate, and linalool concentrations. For Cascade, α-pinene, β-pinene, myrcene, limonene, ρ-cymene, caryophyllene, E, β-farnesene, and humulene all increased from Early to Typical points but no increase was observed between the Typical and Late time point. Linalool and methyl heptanoate increased between each time point while citral and humulene epoxide differed between Early harvest and Late harvest, but not between Early and Typical or Late and Typical harvests. For Willamette hops, α-pinene, β-pinene, myrcene, limonene, ρ-cymene, and linalool all increased between each time point. Caryophyllene, E β-farnesene, humulene, farnesol and citral all increased from Early harvest to Typical harvest but no difference was observed between Typical and Late. Clear sensory differences were found between beers brewed with Typical harvest Cascade hops and Late harvest Cascade hops, in terms of difference testing, descriptive analysis and consumer preference tests...|$|R
