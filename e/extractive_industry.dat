Design/methodology/approach - A cross-section of <b>extractive</b> <b>industries</b> constituents is selected and their participation in the accounting standard setting process is examined via analysis of their comment letters and other interactions with the process. Findings - The paper contributes to our understanding of the politicised nature of accounting standard setting for the <b>extractive</b> <b>industries.</b> In doing so, it highlights the opportunities within the standard setting process through which key constituents can influence outcomes. Research limitations/implications - This paper reflects only a small sample of constituents involved in the standard setting process for the <b>extractive</b> <b>industries</b> and therefore focuses specifically on the relationships between key players selected...|$|R

But, as [...] population advances, and agriculture encroaches on the natural [...] pasture-lands originally available for the rearing of cattle, [...] still more as it becomes necessary to cultivate land for the [...] purpose of pasture, the cost of meat constantly rises.” As [...] population increases there will be an increased demand for [...] dairy-products, eggs, small fruits, fresh vegetables, milk, etc., [...] and thereby it becomes more profitable to employ land near [...] populous centers for such perishable products than for the [...] products of large farming. Almost every one, who knows the high [...] prices of butter, eggs, and vegetables in large cities as compared [...] with their prices in country districts, is familiar with the [...] phenomena which illustrate this principle. Moreover, as a denser [...] population settles on our Western prairies, now given over to [...] ranches and vast pasturing-grounds for cattle—since cattle in [...] general require a large extent of land—the cost of meat will rise. [...] The prices of perishable articles, therefore, will rise without [...] any limit except that set by increasing numbers, and can not be [...] kept down by the force of competition from other distant places, [...] {{as is the case with}} such easily transportable things as timber and [...] wool. What has been said of the transportableness of meat, [...] however, is to be modified somewhat by the introduction of [...] improved processes of transporting meat in refrigerator-cars; but [...] there still exist commodities of which meat was only taken as a [...] type.|$|E

Currently, opportunities abound for Aboriginal peoples to engage with, and potentially benefit from engagement with a variety of <b>extractive</b> <b>industries.</b> Using a case study of Coal Seam Gas (CSG) development in the State of New South Wales, this paper focusses upon the discursive constraints that can marginalise Indigenous agency in the complex milieu presented by CSG development. It argues that discursive framings can, and do, contribute to an ideological setting that may constrain attempts by Aboriginal people who seek to participate in the opportunities presented by <b>extractive</b> <b>industries,</b> particularly those <b>extractive</b> <b>industries</b> that are deemed environmentally risky or damaging. Employing the Strategic Relational Approach (SRA), it contends that discursive framings are not merely ideological tools that socially construct reality, but via the dialectic relationship between discursivity and materiality, they can have substantial material consequences for Aboriginal people.

Currently, 21 and 15 per cent of the Amazon is under concession to mining companies and hydrocarbon companies, respectively according to the Red Amazónica de Información Socioambiental Georeferenciada. These <b>extractive</b> <b>industries</b> and related impacts have the potential to radically transform the social development of the territories in which they take place, for better or worse. Within the many conflicts that accompany this race for resources, different forms of power are employed to gain control over natural resources.

Remarkably, while discourses are omnipresent as <b>extractive</b> <b>industries</b> expand, a critical analysis of their nature and power remains quite neglected in research on the <b>extractive</b> <b>industries.</b> By scrutinizing the development discourses concerning the Amazon region, this think piece urges for a discursive turn in dealing with the <b>extractive</b> <b>industries</b> and local social developmen...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is {{illuminate}} the way in which key constituents have influenced the process of setting an International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) for the <b>extractive</b> <b>industries.</b> Design/methodology/approach – Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) is used to identify some of the key players involved in the international accounting standard setting process for the <b>extractive</b> <b>industries,</b> analyse their discourse and its implications, and assess the outcomes. A case study of one international accounting firm, one global petroleum corporation, and one petroleum industry lobby group was used to provide a cross-section of key players and explicate their influence on the international accounting standard setting process. Findings – CDA made visible the coalitions between powerful players and their impact on the eventual IFRS for the <b>extractive</b> <b>industries.</b> Evidence indicates that the setting of an IFRS for the <b>extractive</b> <b>industries</b> is merely a codification of the existing practice of powerful constituents. Research implications – As a research method, CDA has the potential not only to uncover the social practice and public discourse of accounting standard setting, but also to expose the discourse practice underlying the process. While this research has focused only one industry, there is potential to extend the scope within the <b>extractive</b> <b>industries</b> or in the broader international standard setting process. Originality/value – While it is well accepted that the accounting standard setting process is political, this research demonstrates the usefulness of CDA for providing concrete evidence of the source, nature and effect of this politicisation within the <b>extractive</b> <b>industries...</b>|$|R
