Their eldest son, Joseph, became Holy Roman Emperor. Maria Theresa {{abandoned}} all ornamentation, had her hair cut short, painted her rooms black and dressed in mourning {{for the rest of}} her life. She completely withdrew from court life, public events, and theater. Throughout her widowhood, she spent the whole of August and the eighteenth of each month alone in her chamber, which negatively affected her mental health.

500|$|However, the {{response}} was not exclusively positive. In The Independent on Sunday, columnist Lucy Ellmann criticised both what she saw as the unchanging nature of the characters and Flannery's concentration on friendship rather than family. [...] "What's in the water there anyway? These are the youngest grandparents ever seen! Nothing has changed about them since 1964 except a few grey hairs... It's quite impressive that anything emotional could be salvaged from this nine-part hop, skip and jump through the years. In fact we still <b>hardly</b> <b>know</b> these people – zooming from one decade to the next has a distancing effect," [...] she wrote of the former point. And of the latter, [...] "Peter Flannery {{seems to want to}} suggest that friendships are the only cure for a life blighted by deficient parents. But all that links this ill-matched foursome in the end is history and sentimentality. The emotional centre of the writing is still in family ties." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Hindus {{and some}} Buddhist texts, the main shrine is {{dedicated}} to Kartikeya, known as Murugan in Tamil sources. Kartikeya, also known as Kumara, Skanda, Saravanabhava, Visakha or Mahasena, is a god of war. The Kushan Empires and the Yaudheyas had his likeness minted in coins that they issued in the last centuries BCE. The deity's popularity has waned in North India but has survived in South India. In South India, he became known as Subrahmaniya and was eventually fused with another local god of war known as Murugan among [...] Tamils. [...] Murugan is known independently from Sangam literature dated from the 2nd century BCE to the 6th century CE. Along the way, a number of legends were woven about the deity’s birth, accomplishments, and marriages, including one to a tribal princess known amongst Tamil and Sinhalese sources as Valli. The Skanda Purana, written in Sanskrit in the 7th or 8th century, is the primary corpus of all literature about him. A Tamil rendition of the Skanda Purana known as the Kandha Puranam written in the 14th century also expands on legends of Valli meeting Murugan. The Kandha Puranam plays a greater role for Sri Lankan Tamils than Tamils from India, who <b>hardly</b> <b>know</b> it.|$|E

Alfred Newton, who held the chair in Zoology and Comparative Anatomy at Cambridge from 1866 to 1907, wrote this: [...] "I sat up late that night to read it and never shall I forget the impression it made upon me. Herein was contained a perfectly simple solution of all the difficulties which had been troubling me for months past.

She, however, was unaware of his attraction: [...] "It {{never occurred to me that}} there was anything more than dancing on his mind... It would have been preposterous to think there was anything personal." [...] Although their relationship became more personal, it was a shock to Tallchief when Balanchine asked her to marry him. During the summer of 1945, he asked her to meet him after a Los Angeles performance. Balanchine opened the car door for her; when she got in he sat in silence for a moment before saying, [...] "Maria, I would like you to become my wife". [...] "I almost fell out of my seat and was unable to respond", she recalled. [...] She eventually replied, [...] "But, George, I'm not sure I love you. I feel that I <b>hardly</b> <b>know</b> you."

2500|$|Ginia Bellefante of The New York Times {{criticized the}} show's lack of {{insight into the}} {{consequences}} of teenage pregnancy.

[...] "Refusing to lay out the grim consequences of premature motherhood, it seems as if it wants to make fans on either end of the political spectrum stick their heads in fiery hampers." [...] Author Emily B. Anzicek said that pregnancy seems to be the only possible physical consequence for the residents of One Tree Hill and that discussion of STDs is non-existent, criticizing the [...] "potential threat" [...] due to the amount of promiscuity, such as several characters having sex with people they <b>hardly</b> <b>know.</b> [...] "Of all the episodes in the first three seasons, there are two mentions of condoms. One happens when Deb catches Brooke and Lucas at the drug store buying condoms and whipped cream", said Anzicek. [...] "The second happens in season two when Brooke throws a wedding reception for Nathan and Haley and decorates the room with condoms blown up like balloons." [...] Anzicek said the teenagers, who are only supposed to be sixteen and seventeen at this time, are presented as very sexually-experienced, especially Brooke, and that the one exception is Haley.|$|E

2500|$|Pál Korcsmáros (Budapest, May 22, 1916. – Budapest, May 24, 1975.) graphic artist, cartoonist. Growing up {{in a poor}} family, Korcsmáros made {{profit of}} his artistic talent early in his life: {{he worked in the}} movie factory besides scene-painter, József Pán and ceramist, Margit Kovács. In 1944 he {{prepared}} many false identification cards and Swedish protection notes (Schutzpass), together with his poet friend, Géza Képes saving dozens of lives. After the war he worked for Kossuth Népe, Friss Újság, Képes Figyelő. He became popular via his slightly erotic Pasha-caricatures published in Pesti Izé. Béke és Szabadság, than Szabadság featured his first pictorial stories, than from the first issue of Füles in 1957 he drew comics. His graphic style combines naturalist and cartoon characteristics brought to its highest level in his Jenő Rejtő adaptations, popular to this day. Comics artist, graphic designer, Dávid Cserkuti wrote the following about Korcsmáros's art: [...] "His characters are unmistakable for each other, they are so substantive. The reader has the feeling that the artist knows all of them personally – not superficially, but even their slightest weaknesses. [...] His order of lines are unique, completely set to the drawings, severe. Not the instrument dominates the style of inking, but he is capable of adjusting it to the world of his pencil drawings. I <b>hardly</b> <b>know</b> any other artist, who could keep the original pencil drawings' liveliness, eventuality on the final ink art." ...|$|E
