40|$|Thesis {{deals with}} design of {{framework}} that allows distributed processing of intradepartmental batch business processes. Framework should {{speed up the}} processing of business processes and enable their monitoring and management. Author of the thesis decided to use enterprise service bus {{in order to create}} a powerful distributed framework which will be easy to use by application programmers. Business processes are divided into parts - services that are deployed on individual nodes of enterprise service bus in order to achieve distributed processing. Services may be deployed on individual nodes in many instances in order to achieve parallel processing as well. Services are coordinated by process manager according to the plan. This means that the application programmer cares only about creating the business logic of individual services. Motivation was to accelerate the real business process which handles a large amount of data. Acceleration was achieved by applying database optimizations and subsequent incorporation of several computers via the enterprise service bus.

This study {{aimed to}} identify the institutionalization of organizations Family Offices in Rio Grande do Sul and Minas Gerais. The Family Office, {{in the context of}} this thesis, would be the organization used by entrepreneurs??? families in order to, among other purposes, to preserve the family estate. Through literature review it was identified that the issue is still little explored academically, justifying an exploratory study. From the prospective of the Institutional Theory, both by economic bias, (property preservation) and the social bias (search for legitimacy - isomorphism) it was performed a content analysis of 22 interviews conducted with people related to 13 different organizations Family Offices, two executives of a family company and a private banker, which became possible to identify that organizations Family Offices are of two types: organizations Single Family Offices and organizations Multi Family Offices. The organizations Family Offices have distinct development stages and are usually linked with the family governance. The governance rules are established through two mechanisms: <b>family</b> <b>protocol</b> and family council, and in some situations, the organizations Family Offices are mixed with these mechanisms. Additionally, families seek to formalize values that should guide the conduct of its members both in internal and external relationships. The organizations Family Offices do not necessarily have a legal structure, except in cases where they provide financial services. In this situation, in addition to observing the rules established by the <b>family</b> <b>protocol,</b> are also subject to specific regulations imposed by the state. These regulations, despite incipient, would be a characteristic factor of coercive isomorphism. However, the search for legitimacy occurs from the use of specialized consultant, a characteristic factor of normative isomorphism or by exchanging experiences with other entrepreneurs??? families, a characteristic factor of mimetic isomorphism...|$|E

40|$|UnrestrictedIn this thesis, we mainly {{investigate}} {{four different}} topics: efficiently implementable codes for quantum key expansion [51], quantum error-correcting codes based on privacy amplification [48], private classical capacity of quantum channels [44], and classical channel simulation with quantum side information [49, 50].; For the first topic, we propose an efficiently implementable quantum key expansion protocol, capable {{of increasing the}} size of a pre-shared secret key by a constant factor. Previously, the Shor-Preskill proof [64] of the security of the Bennett-Brassard 1984 (BB 84) [6] quantum key distribution protocol relied on the theoretical existence of good classical error-correcting codes with the "dual-containing" property. But the explicit and efficiently decodable construction of such codes is unknown. We show that we can lift the dual-containing constraint by employing the non-dual-containing codes with excellent performance and efficient decoding algorithms.; For the second topic, we propose a construction of Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) [19, 68] quantum error-correcting codes, which are originally based on pairs of mutually dual-containing classical codes, by combining a classical code with a two-universal hash function. We show, using the results of Renner and Koenig [57], that the communication rates of such codes approach the hashing bound on tensor powers of Pauli channels in the limit of large block-length.; For the third topic, we prove a regularized formula for the secret key assisted capacity region of a quantum channel for transmitting private classical information. This result parallels the work of Devetak on entanglement assisted quantum communication capacity. This formula provides a new <b>family</b> <b>protocol,</b> the private father protocol, under the resource inequality framework that includes the private classical communication without the assisted secret keys as a child protocol.; For the fourth topic, we study and solve the problem of classical channel simulation with quantum side information at the receiver. Our main theorem has two important corollaries: rate-distortion theory with quantum side information and common randomness distillation. Simple proofs of achievability of classical multi-terminal source coding problems can be made via a unified approach using the channel simulation theorem as building blocks. The fully quantum generalization of the problem is also conjectured with outer and inner bounds on the achievable rate pairs...|$|E
