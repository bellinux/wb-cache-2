25|$|Between December 1973 and May 1974, Nilsen {{worked as}} a {{security}} guard. The work was intermittent, and he resolved to find more stable, secure employment. He found work as a civil servant in May 1974. Nilsen was initially posted to a Jobcentre in Denmark Street, where his primary role was to find employment for unskilled labourers. At his workplace, Nilsen {{was known to be}} a quiet, conscientious employee, who was active in the trade union movement. Although his attendance record was hardly exemplary, Nilsen frequently volunteered to work overtime. In 1979, Nilsen was appointed Acting Executive Officer. He was officially promoted to the position of Executive Officer, with additional supervisory responsibilities, in June 1982, and transferred to another Jobcentre in Kentish Town, continuing <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>job</b> until his arrest.|$|E
25|$|In January 1919, {{disturbances}} {{broke out}} amongst troops at Calais, as men returning from leave {{were expected to}} return to full army discipline and key workers with jobs to go to (who had often been the last to enlist) were—contrary to Haig's advice—given priority for demobilisation. Haig accepted the advice of Winston Churchill, Secretary of State for War, that exercising his right to shoot the ringleaders was not sensible. For much of 1919, Haig served as Commander-in-Chief Home Forces in Great Britain, a key position as a General Strike seemed likely. Haig kept a low profile <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>job</b> and insisted the Army be kept in reserve, not used for normal policing. His military career ended in January 1920. Lord Haig arranged for his Dispatches {{to be published in}} 1922 as the General Election loomed, although in the end his nemesis Lloyd George was ousted for unrelated reasons.|$|E

Wood also fell out with Earle, the {{commander}} of the river column. He commanded the British at the Battle of Ginnis in December 1885. He was the only officer to be given an important command despite advising against Wolseley’s choice of the Nile route. Wood briefly took Redvers Buller’s place as chief of staff as Buller had to take charge of the desert column after Stewart was mortally wounded at Abu Klea. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>job</b> Wood became unpopular for employing female nurses (against the advice of army doctors at that time) and quarrelled with his friend Buller when Wood recommended a more cautious advance which would give time to build up supply depots. He was disorganised, stuffing telegrams into his pocket, to Wolseley’s annoyance. In March 1885 Buller became chief of staff again.|$|E
500|$|In June 2004, Mosley {{announced}} that he would step down from his position in October of that year, one year early, saying [...] "I no longer find it either satisfying or interesting to sit in long meetings [...] I have achieved <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>job</b> everything I set out to [...] ". One month later, he rescinded his decision after the FIA Senate called for him to stay on. [...] According to a BBC Sport profile, many insiders considered that the announcement, and Mosley's public disagreements with Ecclestone, were [...] "just part of a well crafted plan to strengthen their control over the sport"; Ron Dennis, the McLaren team principal, suggested that it arose because Mosley's proposals for Formula One met opposition. In 2004, Mosley said he felt Ferrari's then team principal Jean Todt should succeed him as president of the FIA when he stepped down.|$|E
500|$|Their Child is a 1910 American silent short drama {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The film begins with Ellen Stokes whose extravagant lifestyle is outside {{the means of the}} family. While their only son is hosting a birthday party, the husband informs Ellen that they are financially ruined because of her. Ellen attempts to get money from her uncle, who refuses, and a friend of the family soon comes to her aid with a loan. Ellen is deceptive in telling who provided the money and her jealous husband soon learns the truth. In anger, he takes the child and leaves. The child soon returns to Ellen and she whisks him away to a new home where she fails to obtain gainful employment.

500|$|Arsenal had {{finished}} the previous season as runners-up in the Premier League, overhauled by Manchester United in the final ten weeks of the season. The club did, however, retain the FA Cup, with a 1–0 win against Southampton. Such was Arsenal's effective start to the 2002–03 campaign, manager Arsène Wenger suggested his team could remain the whole season undefeated in all competitions: [...] "It's not impossible as A.C. Milan once did it but I can't see why it's so shocking to say it. Do you think Manchester United, Liverpool or Chelsea don't dream that as well? They're exactly the same.

[...] The team lost to Everton a month after Wenger's proclamation; teenager Wayne Rooney scored the match winner, which ended a run of 30 league games without defeat. By February 2003, Arsenal moved five points clear of Manchester United {{at the top of}} the league table, but injuries to key players, not least captain Patrick Vieira, had destabilised the team.

On 4 April they admitted that this statement had been made without consulting the actor, and were forced to apologise. Speaking to the Yorkshire Evening Post in 2010, Eccleston denied that he left due to fear of being typecast. He stated that he [...] "didn't enjoy {{the environment and the}} culture that we, the cast and crew, had to work in" [...] and {{that he did not want}} to do any more based on the experience. He said, [...] "I wasn't comfortable. I thought 'If I stay <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>job,</b> I'm going to have to blind myself to certain things that I thought were wrong.' And I think it's more important to be your own man than be successful, so I left. But the most important thing is that I did it, not that I left. I really feel that, because it kind of broke the mould and it helped to reinvent it. I'm very proud of it." [...] According to the Sunday Mirror, an interview for BBC's Doctor Who website that was taken down after his departure revealed that Eccleston had planned to stay for two or three more years. In March 2013 a source for the BBC indicated that Eccleston had discussed plans for Doctor Whos 50th anniversary special, which aired in November 2013, with Davies' successor as executive producer, Steven Moffat. After consideration, he decided not to return to the series. Had he returned, his incarnation would have played the role that ultimately became the War Doctor, portrayed by John Hurt.|$|E
