5|$|Many central {{government}} officials also began their careers as subordinate officers for commandery-level administrations. There are only rare cases (i.e. involving military merit during rebellions of late Eastern Han) when subordinate officers of county-level administrations {{advanced to the}} level of {{central government}}. <b>Even</b> <b>if</b> <b>one</b> secured an office by these means, an official was still expected to be competent, thus a formal education became the hallmark of those aspiring to fill public office. In addition to private tutoring, the Imperial University was established in 124 BCE which then accommodated only fifty pupils, but by the 2nd century CE the student body had reached about thirty thousand. These students could be appointed by the emperor to various government posts according to their examination grades.|$|E

25|$|Thomson's article, by positing a moral {{justification}} for abortion <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>one</b> grants a fetal right to life, {{opened up a}} new avenue in the philosophical debate about the ethics of abortion. Critics of her view have formulated many objections to her argument, and defenders have responded in kind in a back and forth that continues in philosophy journals even now.|$|E

McReynolds agreed with this determination and suggested that the judgment should be affirmed.|$|E

25|$|For {{games that}} were {{shortened}} due to weather, darkness, or other uncontrollable scenarios, a shutout {{can still be}} recorded by a single pitcher, but under Major League Baseball's official definition of a no-hitter, a no-hitter cannot be achieved unless the game lasts nine innings.

50|$|Hodges {{reports a}} strict touch rule for chu shogi. Once a piece has been touched, then that piece must be moved. Furthermore, if {{the piece is}} also moved to a square, it must remain on that square without exception. (That is, the piece cannot be moved to a {{different}} square, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>one's</b> hand does not leave the piece.) Thus, chu shogi's touch rule is more severe than the western chess touch-move rule used in tournament play.|$|R
25|$|Their tactic was {{to advance}} {{simultaneously}} {{from all sides}} targeting a single central objective. This {{would lead to the}} dispersion of enemy forces and prevent their concentration on any one front. Another important reason for this tactic was that <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>one</b> or two of the attacking columns faced stiff resistance and became unable to break through, then the attack could continue from other flanks. This would also prevent any of the Quresh from escaping.|$|E
25|$|For any finitely {{presented}} group {{it is easy}} {{to construct}} a (smooth) compact 4-manifold with it as its fundamental group. As there is no algorithm to tell whether two finitely presented groups are isomorphic (<b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>one</b> is known to be trivial) there is no algorithm to tell if two 4-manifolds have the same fundamental group. This is one reason why much of the work on 4-manifolds just considers the simply connected case: the general case of many problems is already known to be intractable.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} fleeting {{reference to}} square roots of negative numbers {{occurred in the}} work of the mathematician and inventor Heron of Alexandria in the , when he considered the volume of an impossible frustum of a pyramid. They became more prominent when in the 16thcentury closed formulas for the roots of third and fourth degree polynomials were discovered by Italian mathematicians such as Niccolò Fontana Tartaglia and Gerolamo Cardano. It was soon realized that these formulas, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>one</b> was only interested in real solutions, sometimes required the manipulation of square roots of negative numbers.|$|E
