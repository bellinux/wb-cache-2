25|$|With a chain <b>drive</b> <b>transmission,</b> a {{chainring}} {{attached to}} a crank drives the chain, which in turn rotates the rear wheel via the rear sprocket(s) (cassette or freewheel). There are four gearing options: two-speed hub gear integrated with chain ring, up to 3 chain rings, up to 11 sprockets, hub gear built into rear wheel (3-speed to 14-speed). The most common options are either a rear hub or multiple chain rings combined with multiple sprockets (other combinations of options are possible but less common).|$|E

2500|$|In the company's {{restructuring}} plan, {{it revealed}} that dry dual-clutch transmission {{would have been}} available in the 2012 calendar year. However, this plan was cancelled. The GM dual-clutch gearbox was introduced on the GMC Granite, a concept car. Had it been released, the new front-wheel <b>drive</b> <b>transmission</b> would have incorporated the latest innovations for improving fuel economy and performance. [...] The transmission alone would have provide upward of 10% improvement in fuel economy over today’s conventional six-speed automatic transmissions. The transmission co-developed between GM and Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation features dry, dual-clutch technology. It would have provided shift comfort equal to a conventional fully automatic transmission, with superior quality, while reducing CO2 emissions.|$|E
2500|$|Rover {{acknowledged}} the emerging recreational off-road market in 1967 under Charles Spencer King, {{and began the}} [...] "100-inch Station Wagon" [...] program to develop a radical competitor. Rover bought a Bronco, which featured the sort of long-travel coil spring suspension necessary for the required blend of luxury car comfort and Land Rover's proven off-road ability. [...] King {{is said to have}} been convinced of coil springs while driving a Rover P6 across rough scrubland on part of the Solihull factory site that was being redeveloped. [...] He was also convinced that a permanent four-wheel <b>drive</b> <b>transmission</b> was needed both to provide adequate handling and reliably absorb the power required for the vehicle to be competitive. The cost of developing a totally new transmission was spread between the 100-inch SW project and one working on what would become the Land Rover 101 Forward Control. Powerful, light and sturdy, the Buick alloy V8 earned off-road modifications such as carburetors that maintained fuel supply at extreme angles and provision for cranking the engine with a starting handle in emergencies.|$|E

50|$|Bell housing or {{bellhousing}} is a colloquial/slang {{term for}} {{the portion of the}} transmission that covers the flywheel and the clutch or torque converter of the transmission on vehicles powered by internal combustion engines. This housing is bolted to the engine block and derives its name from the bell-like shape that its internal components necessitate. The starter motor is usually mounted here, and engages with a ring gear on the flywheel. On the opposite end to the engine is usually bolted to the gearbox. The use of different bellhousings on a transmission allows the same transmission to be used on multiple engines in multiple applications. However, on some transmissions, the bellhousing is a nonremovable part of the transmission case. This is particularly true with front wheel <b>drive</b> <b>transmissions,</b> which are much shorter than conventional rear wheel <b>drive</b> <b>transmissions.</b>|$|R

40|$|Network based {{services}} are expanding scale at an unprecedented speed currently. With the continuously strengthen of user’s dependence on these, performance issues {{are becoming more}} and more important. Service Level Agreement (SLA) is a negotiated contract between service provider and customer in the way of service quality, priority, responsibility, etc. In this thesis, we designed and implemented a prototype for a SLA <b>driven</b> <b>transmission</b> service, which can deliver a file from one host to another, using a combination of different transport protocols. The proposed service measures the network conditions, and based on these and user’s requirement, it dynamically evaluates if it can meet the user SLA. Once a transmission has been accepted, it uses this information to adjust the usage of different transfer layer protocols, in order to meet the agreed SLA. The thesis work is based on the investigating of network theory and experimental results. We research how the SLA <b>driven</b> <b>transmission</b> service is affected by various factors, they include user’s requirements, network conditions, and service performance, etc. We design and implement an evaluation model for the network performance. It reveals how network performance is influenced by different network metrics, such as Round-Trip-Time (RTT), Throughput, and Packet Loss Rate (PLR), etc. We implement a transmission service on real test-bed, which is a controllable environment. We can alter the network metrics and measuring frequency of our evaluation model. Then, we evaluate these changes with our evaluation model and improve the performance of the transmission service. After that, we propose a calculating method for the service cost. At last, we can summarize the feasibility of this SLA <b>driven</b> <b>transmission</b> service. In the experiments, we obtain the variable delivery time and packet loss of the transmission service, which are changed with RTT and PLR of network. We analyze the different performance of transmission service, which uses TCP, UDP, and SCTP separately. Also a suitable measuring frequency and the cost for the usage of transmission service on this frequency are pointed out. Statistical analysis on the experiment results show that such SLA <b>driven</b> <b>transmission</b> service is feasible. It brings improved performance for user’s requirements. In addition, we come up with some useful suggestions and future work for the transmission service...|$|R
