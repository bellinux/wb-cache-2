25|$|Davis' second term, {{which lasted}} only ten months, was {{dominated}} by the recall election. Davis signed into law several controversial measures during the closing weeks of the recall campaign, including one granting drivers' licenses to undocumented immigrants. Davis also signed legislation requiring employers to pay for medical insurance for workers and legislation granting domestic partners {{many of the same}} rights as married people. He vetoed legislation that would have given undocumented immigrants free tuition <b>for</b> <b>community</b> <b>college.</b> Many of Davis' opponents were furious over the signings of these measures so late in his administration. Some political observers saw these efforts as an attempt to reinforce support from Hispanics, labor union members and liberal Democrats. Ultimately, Davis did not have as much support from Hispanics and union members in the recall election as he did in his 2002 re-election.|$|E
2500|$|Following on the 1987 {{publication}} of [...] "Policy Statement on Higher Education Faculty Governance", in 1989 the NEA issued a [...] "Policy Statement on Higher Education Policy <b>for</b> <b>Community</b> <b>College</b> Governance." [...] The NEA elaborates upon issues {{in support of}} shared governance {{for the management of}} community colleges, junior and technical colleges not addressed in their previous statement. [...] The statement is based on the same principles, believing cooperative decision-making and collective bargaining in governance should be based on “collegial” relationships. [...] Where statements from the NEA and the AAUP advocate the importance of faculty involvement in governance, the community college statement notes that many do not exercise the right when available and that faculty “at public institutions are not yet permitted to bargain collectively in many states”. [...] The NEA then elaborates upon the need for faculty participation.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2003 From 1990 to 2000, Oregon <b>community</b> <b>colleges</b> {{experienced}} {{a shift in}} their revenue sources from primarily local taxes to primarily state funding. Additionally during this time Oregon approved term limits for state officials and legislators. In preparation for the 2001 - 2003 biennial Legislative session, the <b>community</b> <b>colleges</b> pursued new approaches to securing an increase in state funding, which included a single funding request, the first pledge of unity among the <b>community</b> <b>colleges</b> and a trust-building process with the governor. This study followed the budget development processes <b>for</b> Oregon <b>community</b> <b>colleges</b> in preparation <b>for</b> and during the 2001 - 2003 legislative session. Interviews, observations and primary source materials were used by the researcher to describe the budget processes from the initial <b>community</b> <b>college</b> discussions through {{the enactment of the}} <b>community</b> <b>college</b> budget by the legislature. The governor was found to have the most significant influence in providing <b>for</b> the <b>community</b> <b>college</b> request <b>for</b> increased funding. The legislature was found to have less influence in providing increased revenue <b>for</b> <b>community</b> <b>colleges.</b> The governor, as part of his state budget, forwarded a request to the legislature for a 45 million increase <b>for</b> <b>community</b> <b>colleges.</b> The unity of <b>community</b> <b>colleges</b> in supporting one proposal during the session was found to have several positive impacts. Although <b>community</b> <b>colleges</b> received an increase in state funding, the funding formula <b>for</b> <b>community</b> <b>colleges</b> resulted in differentiated funding for each of the 17 Oregon <b>community</b> <b>colleges.</b> An epilogue provides a chronology of significant changes in state revenues, of special legislative sessions and of changes in <b>community</b> <b>college</b> funding after the enactment of the 2001 - 2003 <b>community</b> <b>college</b> budget...|$|R
