40|$|Network {{perspectives}} {{have recently}} been proposed as a theoretical base for research in economic geography. However, there is an unclear relationship between the advocacy of network approaches {{and the development of}} methodological tactics to frame related empirical research. By reference to one episode of corporate spatial behaviour [...] the establishment of a manufacturing facility in Thailand by the US-headquartered breakfast-cereal company, Kellogg [...] an organising framework for network-inspired economic geography is suggested. Kellogg's entry into Thailand is analysed in terms of the construction and mobilisation of relational networks producing five overlapping geographies: (1) <b>geographies</b> <b>of</b> place; (2) <b>geographies</b> <b>of</b> intrafirm trade and relations; (3) regional <b>geographies</b> <b>of</b> accumulation; (4) <b>geographies</b> <b>of</b> interfirm relations; and (5) <b>geographies</b> <b>of</b> consumption. ...|$|R

5|$|The Chronologia {{developed}} into an even wider project, the Cosmographia, {{a description of}} the whole Universe. Mercator's outline was (1) the creation of the world; (2) the description of the heavens (astronomy and astrology); (3) the description of the earth comprising modern geography, the <b>geography</b> <b>of</b> Ptolemy and the <b>geography</b> <b>of</b> the ancients; (4) genealogy and history of the states; and (5) chronology. Of these the chronology had already been accomplished, the account of the creation and the modern maps would appear in the atlas of 1595, his edition of Ptolemy appeared in 1578 but the ancient geography and the description of the heavens never appeared.|$|E
5|$|The <b>geography</b> <b>of</b> Scotland in {{the early}} modern era covers {{all aspects of the}} land in Scotland, {{including}} physical and human, between the sixteenth century and the beginnings of the Agricultural Revolution and industrialisation in the eighteenth century. The defining factor in the <b>geography</b> <b>of</b> Scotland is the distinction between the Highlands and Islands in the north and west and the Lowlands in the south and east. The Highlands were subdivided by the Great Glen and the Lowlands into the fertile Central Lowlands and the Southern Uplands. The Uplands and Highlands had a relatively short growing season, exacerbated by the Little Ice Age, which peaked {{towards the end of the}} seventeenth century.|$|E

5|$|The {{atmospheric}} conditions have been significantly altered {{from the original}} conditions {{by the presence of}} life-forms, which create an ecological balance that stabilizes the surface conditions. Despite the wide regional variations in climate by latitude and other geographic factors, the long-term average global climate is quite stable during interglacial periods, and variations of a degree or two of average global temperature have historically had major effects on the ecological balance, and on the actual <b>geography</b> <b>of</b> the Earth.|$|E

5|$|The <b>geography</b> <b>of</b> Indonesia is {{dominated}} by volcanoes that are formed due to subduction zones between the Eurasian plate and the Indo-Australian plate. Some of the volcanoes are notable for their eruptions, for instance, Krakatau for its global effects in 1883, Lake Toba for its supervolcanic eruption estimated to have occurred 74,000 years before present which was responsible for six years of volcanic winter, and Mount Tambora for the most violent eruption in recorded history in 1815.|$|E
5|$|The <b>geography</b> <b>of</b> {{mountain}} ranges bordering the Mediterranean are conducive for severe weather and thunderstorms, with the sloped nature of mountainous regions permitting {{the development of}} convective activity. Although the <b>geography</b> <b>of</b> the Mediterranean region, {{as well as its}} dry air, typically prevent the formation of tropical cyclones, when certain meteorological circumstances arise, difficulties influenced by the region's geography are overcome. The occurrence of tropical cyclones in the Mediterranean Sea is generally extremely rare, with an average of 1.57forming annually and merely 99recorded occurrences of tropical-like storms discovered between 1948 and 2011 in a modern study, with no definitive trend in activity in that period. Few medicanes form during the summer season, though activity typically rises in autumn, peaks in January, and gradually decreases from February to May. In the western Mediterranean region of development, approximately 0.75such systems form each year, compared to 0.32in the Ionian Sea region.|$|E
5|$|The present <b>geography</b> <b>of</b> the Gulf Coast {{was formed}} during an ice age {{approximately}} 30,000 {{years ago when}} dramatic lowering of the sea level occurred. As the ice later melted, it formed a flow through the Trinity and San Jacinto rivers and carved wide valleys in the soft sediments, resulting {{in the creation of}} the modern system of bays and lakes approximately 4500 years ago.|$|E
40|$|This article {{introduces}} current {{human geography}} {{research at the}} Department <b>of</b> <b>Geography</b> in Zurich around the notion <b>of</b> <b>geographies</b> <b>of</b> globalization. After mapping out a conceptual landscape <b>of</b> <b>geographies</b> <b>of</b> globalization as worlds of difference, three collaborative research areas are introduced which share a commitment to north-south-relations and a concern for processes of uneven development and fragmentation: «People: Migration», «State: Frontier» and «Economy: <b>Geographies</b> <b>of</b> marketization». The first studies the multi-local connections and social spaces of migrants, the second explores the intricate relationship between state, territory {{and the question of}} where «the state ends» and the third is concerned with the emergence of market orders and their uneven spatial and social expansion.
