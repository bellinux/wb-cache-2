25|$|In Zell am See, Austria, {{an aerial}} lift connects {{the city with}} Schmittenhöhe mountain. The gondolas {{sometimes}} run 24 hours per day, using electricity for lights, door opening and communication. The only available time for recharging batteries at the stations is during the brief intervals of guest loading and unloading, which is too short to recharge batteries. Supercapacitors offer a <b>fast</b> <b>charge,</b> higher number of cycles and longer life time than batteries.|$|E
25|$|A {{standard}} tandem cell {{consists of}} one n-DSC and one p-DSC {{in a simple}} sandwich configuration with an intermediate electrolyte layer. n-DSC and p-DSC are connected in series, which implies that the resulting photocurrent will be controlled by the weakest photoelectrode, whereas photovoltages are additive. Thus, photocurrent matching {{is very important for}} the construction of highly efficient tandem pn-DSCs. However, unlike n-DSCs, <b>fast</b> <b>charge</b> recombination following dye-sensitized hole injection usually resulted in low photocurrents in p-DSC and thus hampered the efficiency of the overall device.|$|E
40|$|Compared {{with the}} {{traditional}} slow charging loads, random integration of large scale <b>fast</b> <b>charging</b> loads will exert more serious impacts on the security of power network operation. Besides, to maximize social benefits, effective scheduling strategies guiding <b>fast</b> <b>charging</b> behaviors should be formulated rather than simply increasing infrastructure construction investments on the power grid. This paper first analyzes the charging users’ various responses to an elastic charging service fee, and introduces the index of charging balance degree to a target region by considering the influence of <b>fast</b> <b>charging</b> loads on the power grid. Then, a multi-objective optimization model of the <b>fast</b> <b>charging</b> service fee is constructed, whose service fee can be further optimized by employing a fuzzy programming method. Therefore, both users’ satisfaction degree and the equilibrium of charging loads can be maintained simultaneously by reasonably guiding electric vehicles (EVs) to different <b>fast</b> <b>charging</b> stations. The simulation results demonstrate {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed dynamic charging service pricing and the corresponding <b>fast</b> <b>charging</b> load guidance strategy...|$|R
30|$|Therefore, it {{is obvious}} that the PEV <b>fast</b> <b>charging</b> demand is unpostponable and uninterruptible, but the PEVs with <b>fast</b> <b>charging</b> demand can be {{scheduled}} to get charged in an optimal <b>fast</b> <b>charging</b> station. The <b>fast</b> <b>charging</b> demand of PEVs can be considered spatially schedulable but temporally unschedulable. On the contrary, the normal charging demand is interruptible, which can be shifted over time, but the charging place is totally fixed. The normal charging time can be scheduled to consume the DGs optimally with minimal cost, which means the normal charging demand can be considered temporally schedulable but spatially unschedulable.|$|R

30|$|Currently, two PEV {{charging}} modes {{are widely}} adopted: normal charging mode {{at home or}} parking lots with lower charging power level, and <b>fast</b> <b>charging</b> mode at <b>fast</b> <b>charging</b> stations with higher charging power level, the typical charging duration is 20 – 30  min [18]. Besides the charging power level, the characteristics of such two charging modes are also intrinsically different. When a PEV is driving to the destination but the SoC is too low to complete the rest trip, it should find a <b>fast</b> <b>charging</b> station to get <b>charged</b> with the <b>fast</b> <b>charging</b> mode as soon as possible. However, the normal charging often happens when a PEV arrives at home or workplaces and it doesn’t hurry to get fully charged [19, 20].|$|R

30|$|The {{proposed}} spatial scheduling {{strategy of}} PEV <b>fast</b> <b>charging</b> demand {{is carried out}} {{at the start of}} each time slot. Once the <b>fast</b> <b>charging</b> behaviors of all PEVs are determined by the scheduling strategy, the PEVs with <b>fast</b> <b>charging</b> demand will get charged in the assigned charging stations. Likely, in the next time slot, the DG output generation, the baseline demand, and RTP can be accurately detected again. Thus, the spatial scheduling strategy will repeat in every time slot with real-time information, which can ensure the real-time performance of the scheduling strategy.|$|R
30|$|Norwegian EV owners suffer {{relatively}} little from range anxiety and are comfortable using on average 80 – 85  % of the battery’s range [13]. 65  % charge their vehicle daily, 20  % charge 3 – 5  days per week and another 15  % charge 1 – 2 {{times per week}} {{at home in a}} garage, carport or outdoor. Public normal charging is used at least monthly by about half the EV owners, and 7 – 14  % use it weekly. Workplace charging is more widely used than public charging. The average annual number of <b>fast</b> <b>charges</b> per vehicle is about 14. 27  % use fast chargers more than once per month, and 6  % are weekly users. EV-only owners use <b>fast</b> <b>charging</b> more than owners in multicar households. Normal charging at public parking spaces is usually free. Half of the respondents did not pay for <b>fast</b> <b>charging,</b> for instance because they have a Tesla with lifetime free <b>fast</b> <b>charging.</b> Although <b>fast</b> <b>charging</b> was sometimes free of charge a few years ago, all fast chargers now [9] require payment.|$|R

The main {{purpose of this paper is}} to investigate the impacts of <b>fast</b> <b>charging</b> stations on a distribution grid using a stochastic <b>fast</b> <b>charging</b> model and to present the charging model with some of its results. The model is used to investigate the impacts on distribution transformer loading and system bus voltage profiles of the test distribution grid. Stochastic and deterministic modelling approaches are also compared. It is concluded that <b>fast</b> <b>charging</b> stations affect transformer loading and system bus voltage profiles. Hence, necessary measures such as using local energy storage and voltage conditioning devices, such as SVC (Static Var Compensator), have to be used at the charging station to handle the problems. It is also illustrated that stochastic modelling approach can produce a more sound and realistic results than deterministic approach...|$|R

40|$|The {{market share}} of plug-in {{electric}} vehicles (PEVs) has been increasing {{in the last years}} which comes along with a raising demand for public charging stations. While the operation of low-power charging stations (Mode- 3) is far from being profitable, prospects for <b>fast</b> <b>charging</b> stations indicate attractive revenues. This is mainly based on a higher workload (shorter charging times), a higher willingness-to-pay of customers and a higher complementary situation compared to home-based charging [1]. Both also serve for different purposes: Slow charging is performed whenever there is an opportunity while <b>fast</b> <b>charging</b> will also allow short stops to recharge on long-distance trips (interim charging). In this paper, we investigate the potential for combining interim and opportunity charging at one location in order to increase the utilization and decrease the payback time of public <b>fast</b> <b>charging</b> stations. For modeling the operation of Mode- 3 charging stations, we applied the ALADIN model [2] and combine it with results from an optimal allocation of <b>fast</b> <b>charging</b> points in Germany (cf. [3]). Results are presented for four <b>fast</b> <b>charging</b> stations around Stuttgart, Germany. Our results show that a combination of long-distance and local customers may increase the occupancy rate and therefore the profitability of <b>fast</b> <b>charging</b> stations. Yet, the willingness to detour of PEV users, the comparably small additional earnings for charging stations together with a joint optimized location modelling might be analyzed in further work...|$|R
