These characteristics are primarily associated with the assembly moderator ratio and fuel mass and include pellet diameter, active fuel length, fuel rod diameter and clad thickness, and water rod configuration. Another variable for BWR assemblies is the presence, and thickness, of the channel. Characterization studies are based on the 87 -assembly basket configuration. For assemblies exceeding the USL at the enrichment specified in the studies either, the 82 -assembly basket configuration or reduced maximum enrichments are required. <b>Enrichment</b> <b>limits</b> for the 82 -assembly and 87 -assembly basket configurations are provided in Section 6. 7. 6.

40|$|Contamination {{of water}} {{resources}} by organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) continues to receive widespread attention because of the increasing concern regarding their high persistence and bioaccumulation. These organic pollutants are not amenable by liquid chromatography (LC) coupled to atmospheric pressure ionization-mass spectrometry, which represents the method of choice for the characterization of pesticide residues in water. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry provides excellent response for OCPs, but it falls short when complex, multiresidue analyses are required. As recently demonstrated, an efficient EI-based LC-MS interface can generate very good spectra for an extremely wide range of small-medium molecular weight molecules of different polarity and can represent a valid tool in solving the analytical challenge of analyzing OCPs by LC-MS. Based on this assumption, we present a new approach for the determination of 12 OCPs in water samples. The method requires a solid-phase extraction preconcentration step followed by nanoscale liquid chromatography coupled to a direct-electron ionization direct interface (Direct-EI). Direct-EI is a miniaturized interface for efficiently coupling a liquid chromatograph with an EI mass spectrometer. The capability to acquire high-quality EI spectra {{in a wide range}} of concentrations, and to operate in selected ion monitoring mode during analyses, allowed a precise quantification of the OCPs. Without sample injection <b>enrichment,</b> <b>limits</b> of detection of the method span from 0. 044 to 0. 33 Ã­g/L, corresponding to an instrumental detection limit of 120 - 850 pg.

This range of feed gas compositions is representative of some significant greenhouse gas emissions streams containing methane, including vent streams from liquefied natural gas production facilities and ventilation air from coal mining operations. The DR-PSA apparatus was demonstrated with activated carbon Norit RB 3 as the adsorbent, operating with a low pressure step of 1. 4 bar and a high pressure step of 5 bar. The effect of light reflux flowrate and heavy product draw on methane recovery and nitrogen vent purity were investigated. The DR-PSA experiment with 2. 4 mol% methane in the feed produced a methane product containing 35. 7 mol% methane, which is approximately a 15 times enrichment, and a clean nitrogen vent containing just 3000 ppmv methane.

This projection method complements the utility-supplied RW- 859 data on historic discharges and short-term projections of SNF discharges by providing long-term projections that complete the total life cycle of discharges {{for each of the}} current U. S. nuclear power reactors. The method was initially developed in mid- 1999 to update the SNF discharge projection associated with the 1995 RW- 859 utility survey (CRWMS M&O 1996). and was further developed as described in Rev. 00 of this report (CRWMS M&O 2001 a). Primary input to the projection of SNF discharges is the utility projection of the next five discharges from each nuclear unit, which is provided via the revised final version of the Energy Information Administration (EIA) 1998 RW- 859 utility survey (EIA 2000 a). The projection calculation method is implemented via a set of Excel 97 spreadsheets. These calculations provide the interface between receipt of the utility five-discharge projections that are provided in the RW- 859 survey, and the delivery of projected life-cycle SNF discharge quantities and characteristics in the format requisite for performing logistics analysis to support design of the Civilian Radioactive Waste Management System (CRWMS).

40|$|Xenopus laevis is {{the most}} widely used model {{amphibian}} species in laboratories, yet there is almost no experimental evidence to guide best practice for captive housing. Enrichment is an important component of maintenance and welfare. A split-sibship experimental design was used to rear juvenile X. laevis under one of three treatments for 30 weeks: a control with no enrichment, enrichment from plastic drainpipe, or enrichment from a plastic plant. Location and clustering behaviour were quantified, along with the amount of food eaten and the time to start eating. Many Xenopus users work with eggs or embryos, and are concerned with the growth and size of animals because female size determines reproductive output. Snout-vent length (SVL) and mass were therefore measured every 3 weeks. After 30 weeks, final measurements included fat body mass in both males and females, and ovary mass and stage of development in females. Enrichment did not effect the time to start eating, or the amount of food eaten, and there were no differences in growth (SVL or mass) between treatments. There were also no differences in final mean per tank body mass, SVL, head width or fat body mass, or the coefficients of variation of these per tank measures. Ovary mass and developmental stage were both correlated with final body mass, but there was no effect of enrichment on these measures of female reproductive potential. However, there were clear differences in behaviour between treatments. Animals used enrichment in a variety of ways. Animals in tanks with drainpipes lay inside or alongside the pipe. Animals in tanks with plants lay under, against the base of, or among the fronds of the plant. Plants were used more than drainpipes, but enrichment in either form resulted in animals spending less time against the edge of tanks, and less time clustered together. Animals from enriched tanks also had smaller startle responses, suggesting they may have been less stressed. They were harder to catch in tanks than controls, but this {{was the result of the}} enrichment itself: once the enrichment was removed there was no difference in capture times. Overall, there is no evidence that <b>enrichment</b> <b>limited</b> the growth or reproductive potential of X. laevis, and clear evidence that they used it when it was available. Enrichment should therefore be provided to captive X. laevis as standard unless there is a well-defined reason not to do so...|$|R

Over three sites, a general pattern emerges, indicating that native stem hydraulic con-ductivity (Kh) and Kleaf are less sensitive to nitrogen (N) fertilization when N limits growth, but more sensitive to phosphorus (P) fertilization when P limits growth. Processes leading to growth enhancement with N fertilization are probably associated with changes in allocation to leaf area and photo-synthetic processes, whereas water uptake and transport processes could be more limiting when P limits growth.

These data suggest that if environmental flows were managed to provide a natural stochastically fluctuating water regime, this would nullify the influence of nutrient <b>enrichment</b> and <b>limit</b> the distribution and spread of invasive species such as Typha, that exists under the current altered conditions.

40|$|A new, simple, {{fast and}} {{reliable}} method {{has been developed}} to separation/preconcentration of trace amounts of mercury ions using dithizone/sodium dodecyl sulfate-immobilized on alumina-coated magnetite nanoparticles (DTZ/SDS-ACMNPs) and its determination by cold vapor atomic absorption spectrometry (CVAAS). This method avoided the time-consuming column-passing process of loading large volume samples in traditional solid phase extraction (SPE) through the rapid isolation of DTZ/SDS-ACMNPs with an adscititious magnet. Under the optimal experimental conditions, the <b>enrichment</b> factor, detection <b>limit,</b> linear range and relative standard deviation (RSD) of Hg(II) ions were 250 (for 500 mL of sample solution), 0. 058 Âµg mLâ 1, 0. 2 â 80. 0 Âµg mLâ 1 and 3. 55 % (for 5. 0 Âµg mLâ 1, n= 10), respectively. The adsorbed mercury ions were quantitatively eluted by 2. 0 mL of 0. 4 mol Lâ 1 HBr solution. The preÂ¬sented procedure was successfully applied for determination of mercury content in the different samples of water and blood...|$|R
30|$|In addition, {{selected}} wells were sampled for 3 H and 14 C determination, {{to obtain}} representative values of different aquifer systems. Samples were prepared following the laboratory instructions. Samples for 3 H analysis {{were collected in}} 600 -mL polyethylene bottles, while those for Î´ 13 C and 14 C were collected in 150 -ml polyethylene bottles. All the samples were shipped in ice coolers. The 3 H was determined by liquid scintillation counting after electrolytic <b>enrichment.</b> The detection <b>limit</b> was of 0.8 Â Â±Â  0.3 tritium units (TU). 14 C and 13 C samples were analyzed by an accelerator mass spectrometer (AMS). 14 C results are expressed as percent of modern carbon (pmC) relative to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). 14 C standard was SMR- 4990 C and normalized to Î´ 13 C â 25 â°. Reference standard for Î´ 13 C is V-PDB (Craig 1957), and the uncertainty is ofÂ Â± 0.2 â°.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the recent increase in {{and diversity of}} regulations relating to Indigenous language teaching in the United States, and analyzes these regulations in relation to 1) the institutional format of the certification processes (characterized as mainstream versus separate), 2) the relative control of different social actors (characterized as community actors versus central authority actors), and 3) the language capacity or learning goals that the regulations support (characterized as full immersion versus <b>limited</b> <b>enrichment).</b> In addition to looking at teacher certification as an important practical component of Indigenous language education which can be managed in different ways, I consider its significance as an ideologically-driven process through which language norms and authority may be created and (following Blommaert et al., 2009) policed by various social actors. I conclude that it is valuable to consider different systems for regulating and institutionalizing language education, {{and the relationship between}} these systems and local ideologies of language education...|$|R
