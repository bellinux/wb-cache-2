The Reds let their player <b>development</b> <b>contract</b> (PDC) with the Sounds expire so they could place their Triple-A affiliate in Indianapolis, which was closer to Cincinnati and was planning to build a new stadium. Nashville entered the offseason unsure of their next major league affiliate.|$|E

5|$|Proposals were {{submitted}} by Boeing, General Dynamics and North American Rockwell in January 1970. In June 1970, North American Rockwell's design was selected and {{was awarded a}} <b>development</b> <b>contract.</b> The original program called for two test airframes, five flyable aircraft, and 40 engines. This was cut in 1971 to one ground and three flight test aircraft. The company {{changed its name to}} Rockwell International and named its aircraft division North American Aircraft Operations in 1973. A fourth prototype, built to production standards, was ordered in the fiscal year 1976 budget. Plans called for 240 B-1As to be built, with initial operational capability set for 1979.|$|E
5|$|The {{design was}} {{presented}} to the Air Force in November 1952, who were interested enough to create a new proposal, inviting several companies to participate. Three additional designs were received: the Republic AP-55, an improved version of its prototype XF-91 Thunderceptor; the North American NA-212, which would eventually evolve into the F-107; and the Northrop N-102 Fang, a new General Electric J79-powered design. Although all were interesting, Lockheed had an insurmountable lead and was granted a <b>development</b> <b>contract</b> in March 1953.|$|E
5|$|The {{failure of}} Operation Eagle Claw during the Iran hostage crisis in 1980 underscored the {{requirement}} for a new long-range, high-speed, vertical-takeoff aircraft for the United States Department of Defense. In response, the Joint-service Vertical take-off/landing Experimental (JVX) aircraft program started in 1981. A partnership between Bell Helicopter and Boeing Helicopters was awarded a <b>development</b> <b>contract</b> in 1983 for the V-22 tiltrotor aircraft. The Bell Boeing team jointly produce the aircraft. The V-22 first flew in 1989, and began flight testing and design alterations; the complexity and difficulties {{of being the first}} tiltrotor for military service led to many years of development.|$|E

5|$|As the USMC {{wanted a}} {{substantially}} improved Harrier without {{the development of}} a new engine, the plan for Harrier II development was authorized by the United States Department of Defense (DoD) in 1976. The United States Navy (USN), which had traditionally procured military aircraft for the USMC, insisted that the new design be verified with flight testing. McDonnell Douglas modified two AV-8As with new wings, revised intakes, redesigned exhaust nozzles, and other aerodynamic changes; the modified forward fuselage and cockpit found on all subsequent aircraft were not incorporated on these prototypes. Designated YAV-8B, the first converted aircraft flew on 9 November 1978, at the hands of Charles Plummer. The aircraft performed three vertical take-offs and hovered for seven minutes at Lambertâ€“St. Louis International Airport. The second aircraft followed on 19 February 1979, but crashed that November due to engine flameout; the pilot ejected safely. Flight testing of these modified AV-8s continued into 1979. The results showed greater than expected drag, hampering the aircraft's maximum speed. Further refinements to the aerodynamic profile yielded little improvement. Positive test results in other areas, including payload, range, and V/STOL performance, led to the award of a <b>development</b> <b>contract</b> in 1979. The contract stipulated a procurement of 12 aircraft initially, followed by a further 324.|$|E

25|$|On 22 August 1952, {{the first}} {{prototype}} Princess, G-ALUN, conducted its maiden flight. Between 1952 and 1954, the first prototype performed {{a total of}} 47 test flights, including two public appearances at the Farnborough Airshow. This work was carried out under a <b>development</b> <b>contract</b> for the Ministry of Supply, the intention being that this {{would lead to a}} contract for the aircraft from British flag carrier British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC). Although the initial <b>development</b> <b>contract</b> had been successfully met, BOAC eventually decided to focus on its land-based routes using the jet-powered De Havilland Comet instead.

Two cases from Amsterdam are presented to demonstrate that <b>development</b> <b>contracts</b> signed between governments and private sector developers are more rigid than zoning regulations in the face of changing circumstances. The paper concludes that, instead of deregulation, a careful articulation of different legal instruments can enhance adaptive capacity...|$|R
