40|$|Customer Relationship Management (CRM) is an {{inherent}} business strategy for companies big and small. The technology {{has reached a}} point where it is truly enabling the way enterprises manage their customer relationships. The goal of the EU funded project CARUSO is the design of a software toolkit that facilitates the building and maintaining of high quality business-to-business and business-to-customer relationships. CARUSO is designed to allow a multi-dimensional way of looking at markets, customers, suppliers, products, personnel, internal and external information, communication and action flow. This will be accomplished by the following core features: <b>front-office</b> <b>application</b> builder with customer care and marketing desk, basic technologies comprising a general communication server, intelligent information, document and contact access, unified messaging, and a customizable user interface. Emphasis will be put on exploiting existing tool packages as much as possible. The CARUSO toolkit is targeted at European Small and Medium Sized Enterprises (SME) and allows them to optimize their business operations to the mutual benefit of both the supplier and the consumer. ...|$|E
40|$|Peer-reviewedUp to now, most {{open source}} {{software}} (OSS) deployments have been in invisible infrastructure applications running on back-office servers (GNU/Linux, Apache, and so on). Beaumont Hospital in Ireland recently started developing its overall information systems infrastructure by deploying more visible desktop and <b>front-office</b> OSS <b>applications</b> in addition to GNU/Linux and Apache. In a two-phase OSS implementation, Beaumont will save over 30 million euros over five years. These details are useful in that few studies have thus far quantified the savings from OSS deployment. Also, in many cases, the extra functionality available in OSS systems allows for a richer feature set. Much {{has been written about}} the motivation of individual OSS developers; in this case, the primary drivers behind an organization's decision to implement OSS solutions are principle and pragmatism. A company can contribute back to the OSS community in its own unique way, by distributing applications developed from its particular domain of expertise, rather than making contributions to the code base of Gnu/Linux. The former type of contribution can have a significant boot-strapping effect in that it creates OSS applications in many domains that otherwise would have been unlikely candidates...|$|R
