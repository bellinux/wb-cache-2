40|$|These last years, we have {{witnessed}} {{a dramatic increase in}} the number of cores available in computational platforms. Concurrently, a new coding paradigm dividing tasks into smaller execution instances called threads, was developed to take advantage of the inherent parallelism of multiprocessor platforms. However, only few methods were proposed to efficiently schedule hard real-time multi-threaded tasks on multiprocessor. In this paper, we propose techniques optimizing the number of processors needed to schedule such sporadic parallel tasks with constrained deadlines. We first define an optimization problem determining, for each thread, an intermediate (artificial) deadline minimizing the number of processors needed to schedule the whole task set. The scheduling algorithm can then schedule threads as if they were independent sequential sporadic tasks. The second contribution is an efficient and nevertheless optimal algorithm that can be <b>executed</b> online <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>the</b> thread's deadlines. Hence, it can be used in dynamic systems were all tasks and their characteristics are not known a priori.

Gain-of-function hERG mutations give rise to the SQT 1 variant of the Short QT Syndrome (SQTS). Reggae mutant zebrafish, with a S 4 zERG mutation (Leucine 499 Proline; L 499 P), display arrhythmic features analogous to those seen in the SQTS. The affected S 4 domain ERG residue is highly conserved. This study was <b>executed</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> how <b>the</b> homologous hERG mutation (L 532 P) influences channel function at 37 °C. Whole-cell measurements of current (IhERG) were made from HEK 293 cells expressing WT or L 532 P hERG. The half maximal activation voltage (V 0. 5) of L 532 P IhERG was positively shifted by ~+ 36 mV compared to WT IhERG; however at negative voltages a pronounced L 532 P IhERG was observed. Both activation and deactivation time-courses were accelerated for L 532 P IhERG. The inactivation V 0. 5 for L 532 P IhERG was shifted by ~+ 32 mV. Under action potential (AP) voltage-clamp, L 532 P IhERG exhibited a dome-shaped current peaking at ~+ 16 mV, compared to ~− 31 mV for WT-IhERG. The L 532 P mutation produced an ~ 5 -fold increase in the IC 50 for dronedarone inhibition of IhERG. Homology modeling indicated that the L 532 residue within the S 4 helix lies closely apposed to the S 5 region of an adjacent hERG subunit.
