Normally, people would only be entitled to a A$1,000 rebate for new cars pre-installed with LPG. Due to the possibility that these bi-fuel Commodores may have been fitted with undersized O-rings in the service valve hand tap, Holden issued a recall affecting the first 981 of these models on 10 April 2007. There were also two VE recalls previous to this.

CO 2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion is {{a major contributor to}} greenhouse gas emissions, and carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) has been suggested and to some extent implemented as a mitigation method. This experimental work presents a study of the use of foam in a CO 2 storage context. The investigation is part of an on-going project with field pilots in Texas, where the objective is to implement mobility control with CO 2 foam for storage and enhanced oil recovery on the Norwegian Continental Shelf (NCS). Foam experiments were conducted in 100 % brine saturated sandstone core samples and fractured marble core samples, through co-injection of gas and surfactant solution at low pressure. Foam was pre-generated in a foam generator upon entering the core samples. Quantitative analyses of endpoint water saturations and pressure gradients were conducted, to evaluate the foam flow behavior and displacement improvement compared to pure <b>gas</b> <b>injections.</b> Generated fractures in impermeable marble cores provided a permeability ranging from 1. 47 D to 8. 03 D. The fractured core samples appeared to be of such a small scale that there was little or no improvement in water production during foam injections compared to pure <b>gas</b> <b>injections.</b> Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was conducted for qualitative studies of water saturations, and indicated good sweep efficiency during co-injection of gas and surfactant solution in a marble core with a multi-fracture system. Calculated mobility reduction factors for foam experiments in unfractured Bentheimer sandstone cores indicated an average gas mobility reduction of 3. 94, compared to pure <b>gas</b> <b>injections.</b> Resistivity measurements conducted during pure CO 2 injections and co-injections of CO 2 gas and surfactant solution in sandstone cores were used to calculate water saturations using Archie’s law. Archie’s law is developed for use in an oil-water system, and does not consider the conductivity of the liquid phase in foam displacements. A modification is therefore needed for Archie’s law to be applicable in foam-water systems...|$|R

40|$|Copyright © 2005 Society of Petroleum Engineers SPE paper number: 97536 -MSA {{miscibility}} {{study was}} conducted to investigate the effects of the C 5 + content in <b>injection</b> <b>gases</b> on Minimum Miscibility Pressure (MMP). Currently available common MMP correlations are based on data from <b>injection</b> <b>gases</b> containing no C 5 + fraction. However, laboratory analyses suggest that having a small (and yet relatively significant) C 5 + fraction could have a large effect on reducing the MMP to considerably below the predicted values from existing correlations. This paper aims at investigating possible benefits for miscibility and CO 2 EOR flooding with impurities, particularly with C 5 + fraction. Previously, a PVT and miscibility {{study was conducted}} on a Cooper Basin (located in central Australia) reservoir fluid, including solubility-swelling and viscosity studies. Slim tube tests were performed using two <b>injection</b> <b>gases</b> – pure CO 2 and a CO 2 -rich synthetic gas (80 mol% CO 2), which contained a small amount of C 5 + fraction (0. 3 mol%). The MMP was expected to increase substantially due to the presence of a large amount of methane (15 mol%). Correlations from literature predicted the MMP to be above 3433 psia, but the MMP was measured to be 2880 psia[1]. As most currently available correlations are based on <b>injection</b> <b>gases</b> with no C 5 + fraction, a major contributing source to error with these correlations may have been the C 5 + content of the gas. In order to investigate the effects of the C 5 + fraction in the <b>injection</b> <b>gas,</b> a series of Rising Bubble Apparatus (RBA) experiments were conducted on the reservoir fluid with three <b>injection</b> <b>gases</b> at three different temperatures to investigate the effect of C 5 + in the <b>injection</b> <b>gas</b> stream.

40|$|This Ph. D. {{research}} project targets Cooper Basin oil reservoirs of very low permeability (approximately 1 mD) where injectivities required for water flooding are not achievable. However, {{the use of}} <b>injection</b> <b>gases</b> such as CO₂ would not have injectivity problems. CO₂ is abundant {{in the region and}} available for EOR use. CO₂ was compared to other CO₂-rich <b>injection</b> <b>gases</b> with a hydrocarbon content including pentane plus components. While the effect of hydrocarbon components up to butane have been investigated in the past, the effect of n-pentane has on impure CO₂ gas streams has not. One particular field of the Cooper Basin was investigated in detail (Field A). However, since similar reservoir and fluid characteristics of Field A are common to the region it is expected that the data measured and developed has applications to many other oil reservoirs of the region and similar reservoirs elsewhere. The aim of this Ph. D. project is to determine the applicability of CO₂ as an <b>injection</b> <b>gas</b> for Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) in the Cooper Basin oil reservoirs and to compare CO₂ with other possible CO₂-rich <b>injection</b> <b>gases.</b> The summarised goals of this research are to: • Determine the compatibility of Field A reservoir fluid with CO₂ as an <b>injection</b> <b>gas.</b> • Compare CO₂ to other <b>injection</b> <b>gas</b> options for Field A. • Development of a correlation to predict the effect of nC₅ on MMP for a CO₂- rich <b>injection</b> <b>gas</b> stream. These goals were achieved through the following work: • Extensive experimental studies of the reservoir properties and the effects of interaction between CO₂-rich <b>injection</b> <b>gas</b> streams and Field A reservoir fluid measuring properties related to: •	Miscibility of the <b>injection</b> <b>gas</b> with Field A reservoir fluid •	Solubility and swelling properties of the <b>injection</b> <b>gas</b> with Field A reservoir fluid •	Change in viscosity-pressure relationship of Field A reservoir fluid due to addition of <b>injection</b> <b>gas</b> • A reservoir condition core flood experiment • Compositional simulation of the reservoir condition core flood to compare expected recoveries from different <b>injection</b> <b>gases</b> • Development of a set of Minimum Miscibility Pressure (MMP) measurements targeted at correlating the effect of nC₅ on CO₂ MMP. The key findings of this research are as follows: • Miscibility is achievable at practical pressures for Field A and similar reservoir fluids with pure CO₂ or CO₂-rich <b>injection</b> <b>gases.</b> • For Field A reservoir fluid, viscosity of the remaining flashed liquid will increase at pressures below ~ 2500 psi due to mixing the reservoir fluid with a CO₂-rich <b>injection</b> <b>gas</b> stream. • Comparison of <b>injection</b> <b>gases</b> showed that methane rich gases are miscible with Field A so long as a significant quantity of C₃+ components is also present in the gas stream. • There is a defined trend for effect of nC₅ on MMP of impure CO₂. This trend was correlated with an error of less than 4 %. • Even though oil composition is taken into account with the base gas MMP, it still affects the trend for effect of nC₅ on MMP of a CO₂-rich gas stream. • An oil characterisation factor was developed to account for this effect, significantly improving the results, reducing the error of the correlation to only 1. 6 %. The significance of these findings is as follows: • An injection pressure above ~ 3000 psi should be targeted. At these pressures miscibility is achieved and the viscosity of the reservoir fluid <b>injection</b> <b>gas</b> mix is reduced. • CO₂ should be compared to gases such as Tim Gas should after considering the cost of compression, pipeline costs and distance from source to destination will need to be considered. • The addition of nC₅ will reduce the MMP and increase the recovery factor, however the cost of the nC₅ used would be more than the value of increased oil recovered. • The developed correlation for the effect of nC₅ on impure CO₂ MMP can be used broadly within the limits of the correlation. • Further research using more oils is necessary to validate the developed oil characterisation factor and if successful, using the same or similar method used to improve other correlations.

Reservoirs with higher vertical permeability {{are influenced by}} cross flow perpendicular to the bulk flow direction. Viscous, capillary, gravity and dispersive forces generally influence this phenomenon 5.
