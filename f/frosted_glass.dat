5|$|Film noir is {{also known}} for its use of low-angle, wide-angle, and skewed, or Dutch angle shots. Other devices of {{disorientation}} relatively common in film noir include shots of people reflected {{in one or more}} mirrors, shots through curved or <b>frosted</b> <b>glass</b> or other distorting objects (such as during the strangulation scene in Strangers on a Train), and special effects sequences of a sometimes bizarre nature. Night-for-night shooting, as opposed to the Hollywood norm of day-for-night, was often employed. From the mid-1940s forward, location shooting became increasingly frequent in noir.|$|E

25|$|The Queen Anne {{elements}} on the house, {{influenced by}} the Eastlake principles, include: the ornamental iron fences, geometric squares and scrollwork, the etched and <b>frosted</b> <b>glass</b> on the main entrance, incised flowers {{on the porch and}} bay windows and the spindles lining the porch rails. In particular the ornamental iron fencework shows Eastlake influence in its medieval design.|$|E

30|$|After wood powders {{of birch}} or cedar treated with {{traditional}} or new Mäule reagents were centrifuged to obtain precipitates, moist samples were {{set on a}} <b>frost</b> <b>glass</b> sample holder, which is usually used in X-ray diffractometry. Fluorescence spectra were measured after excitation at 480  nm using a fluorescence spectrometer (RF- 5300 PC; Shimadzu, Japan).|$|R
25|$|The eastern {{elevation}} is straight, while {{along the}} western elevation the vestry and entry foyer project out beyond the aisle wall. Both elevations are divided into bays by regularly spaced brick piers, with brick infill up to waist height and windows above. The timber framed windows {{are made up of}} four awning casements separated by strips of <b>frosted</b> <b>glass</b> {{in the shape of a}} cross.|$|E
25|$|The {{interior}} of the General Post Office was similarly well-finished, with jarrah features throughout. An estimated 600,000 jarrah blocks {{were used in the}} herringbone-pattern flooring. The ground floor is fronted by a large colonnade along its entire width. The main postal hall was two storeys high, with balconies from the first floor above. The postal hall also featured a <b>frosted</b> <b>glass</b> roof, above which a lightwell reached {{to the top of the}} building.|$|E
25|$|The front facade {{has with}} a double front door on its left. The door and transom feature etched <b>frosted</b> <b>glass</b> and are {{surrounded}} by an ornamented porch. Along the center line of the structure are two oriel type bay windows, one each on {{the first and second}} floors. To the right is a second entrance, inset from the facade, designed to mimic the main entryway but with smaller proportions. The inset entrance was used as the door for Roberts' doctor's office.|$|E
25|$|In metalworking, {{hydrofluoric}} acid {{is used as}} a pickling agent to remove oxides and other impurities from stainless and carbon steels because of its limited ability to dissolve steel. It is used in the semiconductor industry as a major component of Wright Etch and buffered oxide etch, which are used to clean silicon wafers. In a similar manner it is also used to etch glass by reacting with silicon dioxide to form gaseous or water-soluble silicon fluorides. It {{can also be used to}} polish and <b>frost</b> <b>glass.</b>|$|R
50|$|Few {{materials}} do {{not cause}} diffuse reflection: {{among these are}} metals, which do not allow light to enter; gases, liquids, glass, and transparent plastics (which have a liquid-like amorphous microscopic structure); single crystals, such as some gems or a salt crystal; and some very special materials, such as the tissues which make the cornea and the lens of an eye. These materials can reflect diffusely, however, if their surface is microscopically rough, like in a <b>frost</b> <b>glass</b> (Figure 2), or, of course, if their homogeneous structure deteriorates, as in cataracts of the eye lens.|$|R

25|$|A similar {{device is}} present in Volkov's series. There, it is given as a present to the Scarecrow by the Good Witch of the South. It is a box of pink wood with a thick <b>frosted</b> <b>glass</b> screen. The device is {{password}} activated, and limited in range to the Magic Land (with the exception of deep underground caverns and certain types of magical interference). The box is shown to be virtually indestructible; it withstood repeated abuse from a villain attempting to use it.|$|E
25|$|The {{length of}} the church is divided into bays by the exposed {{parabolic}} arches. A scaled-down arch within the arch closest to the sanctuary provides the framework for a lower arched ceiling, lined with plasterboard. The gap between the inner and outer arches is glazed with <b>frosted</b> <b>glass.</b> The lower ceiling stops short of touching the southern sanctuary wall, allowing views of the main roof structure. Throughout the nave, the underside of the parabolic roof is lined with timber, while the tops of the parabolic arches are concealed from view by a high, plasterboard-clad cove.|$|E
25|$|Purge Incomplete – Mary Jo Bole's exhibit {{explores the}} history of {{plumbing}} at the penitentiary. Interestingly, the building had running water before the White House did. Consisting of sculptural pieces made of resin, brass, and <b>frosted</b> <b>glass,</b> Bole's designs are modeled after John Haviland's original design for the plumbing at Eastern State Penitentiary. The exhibit includes views of the plumbing {{from the vantage point}} of those residing or working at the prison, including that of the prisoners, prison guards, and the manufacturers of the plumbing. Additionally, the exhibit showcases the sculptures as having both opaque and translucent factors, in which the translucent parts will glow within the cells.|$|E

50|$|Types {{of frost}} include {{crystalline}} hoar frost from deposition of water vapor from air of low humidity, white frost in humid conditions, window <b>frost</b> on <b>glass</b> surfaces, advection <b>frost</b> from cold wind over cold surfaces, black frost without visible ice at low temperatures and very low humidity, and rime under supercooled wet conditions.|$|R
50|$|Designed by Jacob Wrey Mould and {{dedicated}} in the 1860s, this ornamental structure was originally {{designed as a}} watering trough for horses during the 19th century. The fountain consists of a granite dome and sculpted bluestone basin inset with Minton tiles. Crowning this 14-foot high tower are eight <b>frosted</b> round <b>glass</b> lamps and a golden spire.|$|R
25|$|In {{the second}} level, the living {{quarters}} consist of 15 rooms divided among sleeping quarters, living room, antesala, dining room, kitchen (with an original 19th century stove), bathroom and studio/library. The layout {{responds to the}} L-shaped arrangement. A massive rectangular volume, divided in three spacious rooms with 15-foot high ceilings, faces west overseeing Paseo Atocha. The bedrooms, kitchen, bathroom and dining room are lined-up along the longitudinal axis, facing north overlooking Calle Castillo. This section of the quarters, the most private section of the house, also faces south, towards the interior courtyard. The entrance to each room in the longitudinal axis is accentuated {{by the use of}} a classical pediment framing each doorway. Each room facing the patio, {{with the exception of the}} dining room at the eastern end, has a distinguishable feature of a double door system. First a double wooden door with adjustable louvers, crowned with a wooden fixed transom with <b>frosted</b> <b>glass</b> panel. Another solid mahogany double door is added, which covers the entire doorway.|$|E

The early buzz about B {{was that he was}} making outsider art and England is probably the closest he comes to that standard. He has ideas about what the creation of spoken word poetry and ambient music entails but it's quite clear he hasn’t taken a ton of time to study those forms." [...] David Morris of Tiny Mix Tapes said that although the album is [...] "conceptually daring" [...] and a showcase for Lil B's [...] "poetic, philosophical streak", he called the musical backing [...] "utter garbage" [...] and [...] "pure, unstructured noodling". Morris blamed what he saw as a misguided effort to be [...] "left-field and trendy" [...] on Lil B's internet hype and coverage in the indie rock press. The Quietus praised the album as [...] "baffling, flawed but utterly engrossing", and said Lil B's flow is [...] "more measured but no less dexterous than his contemporaries, and the pace of his eloquent, brooding verses lend themselves well to the alien, <b>frosted</b> <b>glass</b> synth sounds and syrupy electronics that form the majority of the backing tracks here. Rain In England comes across like the work of some rap savant, a man whose inner filter has been disabled, creating something which may polarise but which is, at least, utterly distinctive."

2500|$|On 8 December 2003 {{a second}} makeover, {{using the same}} 'drums and beeps' style music but new {{graphics}} took place, although on a much smaller scale to that of 2000. The music was changed slightly while the main colour scheme became black and red, with studios using <b>frosted</b> <b>glass</b> and white and red colours. Later in 2004, the channel's slogan became Putting News First, replacing Demand a Broader View.|$|E

2500|$|There is {{essentially}} no direct sunlight under an overcast sky, so all light is then diffuse sky radiation. The flux of light {{is not very}} wavelength dependent because the cloud droplets are larger than the light's wavelength and scatter all colors approximately equally.

2500|$|European-style dominoes are {{traditionally}} made of bone or ivory, or a dark hardwood such as ebony, with contrasting {{black or white}} pips (inlaid or painted).

2500|$|Glass reacts {{slowly with}} aqueous sodium {{hydroxide}} solutions at ambient temperatures to form soluble silicates. Because of this, glass joints and stopcocks exposed to sodium hydroxide {{have a tendency to}} [...] "freeze". Flasks and glass-lined chemical reactors are damaged by long exposure to hot sodium hydroxide, which also <b>frosts</b> the <b>glass.</b> Sodium hydroxide does not attack iron since iron does not have amphoteric properties (i.e., it only dissolves in acid, not base). A few transition metals, however, may react vigorously with sodium hydroxide.|$|R

2500|$|The [...] "snug", {{sometimes}} called the smoke room, was typically a small, very private room {{with access to the}} bar that had a <b>frosted</b> <b>glass</b> external window, set above head height. A higher price was paid for beer in the snug and nobody could look in and see the drinkers. It was not only the wealthy visitors who would use these rooms. The snug was for patrons who preferred not to be seen in the public bar. Ladies would often enjoy a private drink in the snug in {{a time when it was}} frowned upon for women to be in a pub. The local police officer might nip in for a quiet pint, the parish priest for his evening whisky, or lovers for a rendezvous.|$|E
2500|$|The {{problem with}} this {{approach}} was there was no simple way to recombine them on the receiver end. If each image was sent {{at the same time}} on different frequencies, the images would have to be [...] "stacked" [...] somehow on the display, in real time. The simplest way to do this would be to reverse the system used in the camera; arrange three separate black-and-white displays behind colored filters and then optically combine their images using mirrors or prisms onto a suitable screen, like <b>frosted</b> <b>glass.</b> RCA built just such a system in order to present the first electronically scanned color television demonstration on February 5, 1940, [...] privately shown to members of the US Federal Communications Commission at the RCA plant in Camden, New Jersey. This system, however, suffered from the twin problems of costing at least three times as much as a conventional black-and-white set, as well as having very dim pictures, the result of the fairly low illumination given off by tubes of the era. Projection systems of this sort would become common decades later, however, with improvements in technology.|$|E
