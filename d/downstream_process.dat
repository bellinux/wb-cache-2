Professor Sang Yup Lee at the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, KAIST, Dr. Do Young Seung at GS Caltex, a large oil refining company in Korea, and Dr. Yu-Sin Jang at BioFuelChem, a startup butanol company in Korea, applied a systems metabolic engineering approach to improve the production of butanol through enhancing the performance of Clostridium acetobutylicum, {{one of the best}} known butanol-producing bacteria. In addition, the <b>downstream</b> <b>process</b> was optimized and an in situ recovery process was integrated to achieve higher butanol titer, yield, and productivity. The combination of systems metabolic engineering and bioprocess optimization resulted {{in the development of a}} process capable of producing more than 585g of butanol from 1.8kg of glucose, which allows the production of this important industrial solvent and advanced biofuel to be cost competitive.|$|E

Capitalizing on a general distinction between blocking and attenuation—blocking cannot be overcome by strong stimuli, whereas attenuation can—we measured how attention interacted with the strength of stimuli in two spatial selection paradigms, spatial filtering and spatial monitoring.

40|$|This {{presentation}} {{examines the}} application of Distributed Digital Controls in order to review {{the application of}} this recent control technology towards Steam Boilers in a step-by-step manner. The main purpose of a steam generating boiler is to supply enough steam to meet process demands. Steam conditions must remain as stable as possible, because variations in the steam system can affect <b>downstream</b> <b>processes.</b> Pressure variations in the steam supply header, for example, can have a severe effect on heat transferred to a process. If that process suffers an upset, unstable conditions can propagate from one process to another via the steam supply system. The closer the tolerance in the boiler control system, the smaller the steam header disturbances will be. This reduces the interaction, or 'coupling', of upsets between steam-consuming processes. Also, it may reduce the complexity of instrumentation needed for those processes. If the boiler control system can eliminate major upsets, the <b>downstream</b> <b>processes</b> won't need exotic schemes to compensate for such upsets...|$|R
50|$|Effective oil-gas {{separation}} {{is important not}} only {{to ensure that the}} required export quality is achieved but also to prevent problems in <b>downstream</b> <b>process</b> equipment and compressors. Once the bulk liquid has been knocked out, which can be achieved in many ways, the remaining liquid droplets are separated from by a demisting device. Until recently the main technologies used for this application were reverse-flow cyclones, mesh pads and vane packs. More recently new devices with higher gas-handling have been developed which have enabled potential reduction in the scrubber vessel size. There are several new concepts currently under development in which the fluids are degassed upstream of the primary separator. These systems are based on centrifugal and turbine technology and have additional advantages in that they are compact and motion insensitive, hence ideal for floating production facilities. Below are some {{of the ways in which}} oil is separated from gas in separators.|$|E

[...] This work also discusses potential application of sophorolipids (and their derivatives) as well as the potential for genetic engineering strains to enhance sophorolipid yields. Researchers have focused on optimization of sophorolipid production in submerged fermentation, but some efforts have also investigated the possibility of sophorololipid production using solid state fermentation (SSF). The production process can be significantly impacted by the specific properties of the carbon and oil substrates used; and several inexpensive alternatives to more traditional substrates have been investigated. These potential substrates include: biodiesel by-product streams, waste frying oil, restaurant waste oil, industrial fatty acid residues, mango seed fat, and soybean dark oil. The use of most of these substrates have resulted in lower yields compared to traditional fermentation substrates.|$|E

50|$|As each CAD {{system has}} its own method of {{describing}} geometry, both mathematically and structurally, there is always some loss of information when translating data from one CAD data format to another. One example is when the translation occurs between CAD systems using different geometric modeling kernels, in which the translation inconsistencies can lead to anomalies in the data. The intermediate file formats are also limited in what they can describe, {{and they can be}} interpreted differently by both the sending and receiving systems. It is, therefore, important when transferring data between systems to identify what needs to be translated. If only the 3D model is required for the <b>downstream</b> <b>process,</b> then only the model description needs to be transferred. However, there are levels of detail. For example: is the data wireframe, surface, or solid; is the topology (BREP) information required; must the face and edge identifications be preserved on subsequent modification; must the feature information and history be preserved between systems; and is PMI annotation to be transferred. With product models, retaining the assembly structure may be required. If drawings need to be translated, the wireframe geometry is normally not an issue; however text, dimensions and other annotation can be an issue, particularly fonts and formats. No matter what data is to be translated, there is also a need to preserve attributes (such as color and layer of graphical objects) and metadata stored within the files.|$|E
50|$|Sensor-based {{ore sorting}} is in {{comparison}} to other coarse particle separation technologies relatively cheap. While the costs for the equipment itself are relatively high in capital expenditure and operating costs, the absence of extensive infrastructure in a system results in operating costs {{that are to be}} compared to jigging. The specific costs are very much depending on the average particle size of the feed and on the ease of the separation. Coarser particles imply higher capacity and thus less costs. Detailed costing can be conducted after the mini-bulk stage in the technical feasibility evaluation.Prejudice against waste rejection with sensor-based sorting widely spread, that the loss of valuables, thus the recovery penalty of this process, supersedes the potential downstream cost savings and is therefore economically not viable. It must be noted that for waste rejection the aim for the separation with sensor-based ore sorting must be put onto maximum recovery, which means that only low grade or barren waste is rejected because the financial feasibility is very much sensitive to that factor. Nevertheless, through the rejection of waste before comminution and concentration steps, recovery can be often increased in the <b>downstream</b> <b>process,</b> meaning that the overall recovery is equal or even higher than the one in the base case, meaning that instead of losing product, additional product can be produced, which adds the additional revenue to the cost savings on the positive side in the cash flow.If the rejected material is replaced with additional higher grade material, the main economic benefit unfolds through the additional production. It implies, that in conjunction with sensor-based ore sorting, the capacity of the crushing station is increased, to allow for the additional mass-flow that is subsequently taken out by the sensor-based ore sorters as waste.|$|E
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study is to {{simulate}} the large scale production of monoclonal antibody (mAb) by using SuperPro Designer (SPD). Since the first discovery of mAb at 1970 s, this type of antibody had become the most rapidly growing class of pharmaceutical. Problem with mAb production is the high cost and low amount of production but high demand for this therapeutic. In order to overcome this problem, large scale production had become one of the top priorities for mAb production. Large scale simulation study by using SPD can minimize time and cost production by eliminate the high cost of trial-and-error steps, as well as to find and simulate the optimization process for mAb production. In order to achieve the objective of this research, study is conducted in two steps which are simulation on the upstream and <b>downstream</b> <b>process.</b> For the upstream process, the stoichiometric equation is constructed base on the laboratory data and used to simulate the large volume of fermenter. For a <b>downstream</b> <b>process,</b> three flow of <b>downstream</b> <b>process</b> from different source a built, simulated and compared to choose the best process for purification of mAb. The result shows that the upstream process for 20000 L fermenter produced 0. 00510 kg/Batch of mAb with concentration of 3. 8 × 10 - 4 g/L (5. 1103 g/Batch). Compared to the flow from SPD source and journal (S. Sommerfeld and J. Strube, 2005), the best <b>downstream</b> <b>process</b> was the flow from Inno Biologics Sdn.

40|$|AbstractNumerous {{biopharmaceuticals}} {{are produced}} in recombinant microorganisms in the controlled environment of a bioreactor, {{a process known}} as Upstream Process. To minimize product loss due to physico-chemical and enzymatic degradation, the Upstream Process should be directly followed by product purification, known as <b>Downstream</b> <b>Process.</b> However, the <b>Downstream</b> <b>Process</b> can be technologically complex and time-consuming which is why Upstream and <b>Downstream</b> <b>Process</b> usually have to be decoupled temporally and spatially. Consequently, the product obtained after the Upstream Process, known as intermediate bulk, has to be stored. In those circumstances, a freezing procedure is often performed to prevent product loss. However, the freezing process itself is inseparably linked to physico-chemical changes of the intermediate bulk which may in turn damage the product. The present study analysed the behaviour of a Tris-buffered intermediate bulk containing a biopharmaceutically relevant protein during a bottle freezing process. Major damaging mechanisms, like the spatiotemporal redistribution of ion concentrations and pH, and their influence on product stability were investigated. Summarizing, we show the complex events which happen in an intermediate bulk during freezing and explain the different causes for product loss...|$|E
