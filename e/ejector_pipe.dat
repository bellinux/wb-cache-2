50|$|The banjo-shaped {{extension}} modification to {{the front}} of the smokebox was found necessary to cope with the copious amounts of char generated by brittle Witbank coal and mechanical stoking, since the original Henschel design proved to have too little capacity to keep accumulated char away from the exhaust turbine. Most of the char was collected in the trough of the banjo at the bottom of the smokebox front from where it was periodically ejected through a vertical steam <b>ejector</b> <b>pipe</b> inside the banjo door which exhausted immediately in front of the chimney.|$|E

50|$|During the 1960s SAT made {{a number}} of innovations, {{experiments}} and extended to new areas. In 1961 the radial type hydraulic motor Sisu Nemo was patented. The main use was powering of trailer axles but Nemo's were installed also in number of other applications. The 1963 introduced K-138 features another innovation of the same period: vertical <b>ejector</b> exhaust <b>pipe</b> that dilutes exhaust gases. At the early 1960s also wide tyres to substitute double wheels were tested; the experiment done together with Nokia did not, however lead to production.|$|R
50|$|The massive {{headlamp}} {{and side}} lamps were added when night trains began running in 1879, while the sandbox was relocated from the running boards {{to the top}} of the boiler, ahead of the steam dome. At one stage, the vacuum brake <b>ejector</b> exhaust <b>pipe</b> was run along the top of the boiler on the right side and then up the rear side of the chimney, but it was altered again later to eject into the side of the smokebox. In addition, the axle-driven boiler feed-water pumps were replaced with injectors and the Salter safety valves were replaced with Ramsbottom safety valves. The modifications are illustrated in the following pictures.|$|R
