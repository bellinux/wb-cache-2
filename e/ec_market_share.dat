The analysis concludes that the traffic ratios used by the <b>EC</b> to estimate <b>market</b> <b>shares</b> when it reviewed the merger application of MCI and WorldCom, and by the EC and the DOJ when they reviewed the proposed merger of Sprint and MCI WorldCom, have significant limitations. In particular, the paper shows that these measurements provide a potentially misleading picture of the effect of a merger of backbone providers even under the assumption that the Internet is a rigid hierarchy, and that this problem is likely to become worse as the use of secondary peering, multihoming, and intelligent content distribution services become more widespread...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} project was initiated {{in response to}} concerns held by the author on aspects of the European Community (<b>EC)</b> internal <b>market.</b> These concerns applied particularly to what was understood {{at the time to}} be the perceptions of <b>EC</b> internal <b>market</b> practitioners; their perceptions on the process of <b>EC</b> internal <b>market</b> technical legislative change and on how well the <b>EC</b> internal <b>market</b> was functioning. A literature review was undertaken to determine if, and if so where, the <b>EC</b> internal <b>market</b> technical legislative change process was defined and to determine which organisations were the important players in the process. The literature review was then extended to determine more about the players in the process and the information exchanges between the defined process and individuals, such as <b>EC</b> internal <b>market</b> practitioners, having a legitimate interest in the process. Also within the literature review the views of other commentators are noted and assessed. A methodological review was undertaken. This review gave rise to the formulation of a structured interview that was applied to a purposive sample of <b>EC</b> internal <b>market</b> practitioners. Two main areas were examined via the structured interview. The first was the knowledge of the overall <b>EC</b> internal <b>market</b> technical legislative change process and of its main players. The second area was the perception of the completeness of the functioning of the <b>EC</b> internal <b>market</b> possessed by <b>EC</b> internal <b>market</b> practitioners. This research concludes {{that there are a number}} of flaws in the treaty establishing the European Community; this is the treaty that includes the high level description of the <b>EC</b> internal <b>market</b> technical legislative process.

40|$|Master of AgribusinessDepartment of Agricultural EconomicsBryan W. SchurleThe {{objective}} of this thesis {{is to develop a}} simulation model to determine the probability of achieving a <b>market</b> <b>share</b> goal. Two different simulation models were developed and compared allowing the author to select the best model. The first simulation model developed used the current <b>market</b> <b>share</b> as the mean and the standard deviation of historical <b>market</b> <b>share</b> as the standard deviation. So, a <b>market</b> <b>share</b> of 31. 00 % and a standard deviation of 3. 88 % were used in the simulation. When these values were simulated the results determined the probability of achieving the <b>market</b> <b>share</b> goal of 33 %. The simulation results indicated that only 12 out of 100 observations resulted in <b>market</b> <b>share</b> greater than the goal. Therefore, there is a 12 % probability of achieving or exceeding the <b>market</b> <b>share</b> goal based on the current <b>market</b> <b>share</b> and historical <b>market</b> <b>share</b> standard deviation. To predict future <b>market</b> <b>share,</b> a regression model was used to determine the impact of factors on <b>market</b> <b>share.</b> The regression model was used to forecast an estimate of <b>market</b> <b>share.</b> This forecasted share of 31. 13 % was used as the mean and 3. 45 %, the standard error of the model, was used to generate a second simulation model. The simulation results indicated that 26 of 100 observations resulted in <b>market</b> <b>share</b> greater than the goal of 33 %. This indicates that there is a 26 % probability of achieving or exceeding the <b>market</b> <b>share</b> goal based on results using regression to predict future <b>market</b> <b>share</b> and variability in <b>market</b> <b>share.</b> The second simulation model generated from the <b>market</b> <b>share</b> forecast and standard error from the regression model produced the better results.

Abnormal returns are positively correlated with changes in <b>market</b> <b>share</b> around acquisitions, but not with changes in industry concentration, which suggests stock market's expectation of future benefits from efficiency rather than market power. More directly, I find that merging firms' long-run profitability increases with <b>market</b> <b>share,</b> and the increase in profitability primarily results from better asset management.
