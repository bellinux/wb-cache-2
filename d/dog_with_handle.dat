[...] However, the term swing dingle is more often published as being a type of logging sled. These early types are also called a ring dog or ring dog cant hook.

40|$|BACKGROUND Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) is {{a protein}} {{that is used}} in human {{medicine}} as a real-time indicator of acute kidney injury (AKI). HYPOTHESIS <b>Dogs</b> <b>with</b> AKI have significantly higher plasma NGAL concentration and urine NGAL-to-creatinine ratio (UNCR) compared <b>with</b> healthy <b>dogs</b> and <b>dogs</b> <b>with</b> chronic kidney disease (CKD). ANIMALS 18 healthy control <b>dogs,</b> 17 <b>dogs</b> <b>with</b> CKD, and 48 <b>dogs</b> <b>with</b> AKI. METHODS Over a period of 1 year, all <b>dogs</b> <b>with</b> renal azotemia were prospectively included. Urine and plasma samples were collected during the first 24 hours after presentation or after development of renal azotemia. Plasma and urine NGAL concentrations were measured with a commercially available canine NGAL Elisa Kit (Bioporto® Diagnostic) and UNCR was calculated. A single-injection plasma inulin clearance was performed in the healthy dogs. RESULTS Median (range) NGAL plasma concentration in healthy <b>dogs,</b> <b>dogs</b> <b>with</b> CKD, and AKI were 10. 7 ng/mL (2. 5 - 21. 2), 22. 0 ng/mL (7. 7 - 62. 3), and 48. 3 ng/mL (5. 7 - 469. 0), respectively. UNCR was 2  ×  10 (- 8) (0 - 46), 1, 424  ×  10 (- 8) (385 - 18, 347), and 2, 366  ×  10 (- 8) (36 - 994, 669), respectively. <b>Dogs</b> <b>with</b> renal azotemia had significantly higher NGAL concentrations and UNCR than did healthy dogs (P < . 0001 for both).

At both times the <b>dogs</b> <b>with</b> pdh {{had significantly higher}} {{concentrations of}} cortisol, 17 alpha-hydroxypregnenolone, 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone and 21 -deoxycortisol than the healthy dogs. Basal 11 -deoxycortisol concentrations were also significantly higher in <b>dogs</b> <b>with</b> pdh compared <b>with</b> healthy <b>dogs.</b> When compared <b>with</b> the <b>dogs</b> <b>with</b> other diseases, the <b>dogs</b> <b>with</b> pdh had significantly higher basal and post-acth cortisol and basal 21 -deoxycortisol, and significantly lower post-acth 11 -deoxycortisol concentrations. The <b>dogs</b> <b>with</b> other diseases had significantly higher post-acth cortisol, 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone and 11 -deoxycortisol concentrations than the healthy dogs. In general, the post-acth concentrations of 17 alpha-hydroxypregnenolone, 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone, 11 -deoxycortisol and 21 -deoxycortisol were more variable than the post-acth concentrations of cortisol, resulting in large overlaps of the concentrations of these hormones between the three groups.

40|$|Background: Diagnosis of canine {{idiopathic}} {{pulmonary fibrosis}} (IPF) is challenging. Endothelin- 1 (ET 1) is a biomarker of IPF in humans, but whether ET 1 can detect and differentiate IPF from other canine respiratory diseases is unknown. Objective: To evaluate whether measurement of the concentration of ET 1 in serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) {{can be used to}} distinguish canine IPF from chronic bronchitis (CB) and eosinophilic bronchopneumopathy (EBP). Animals: Twelve <b>dogs</b> <b>with</b> IPF, 10 <b>dogs</b> <b>with</b> CB, 6 <b>dogs</b> <b>with</b> EBP, 13 privately owned healthy West Highland White Terriers (WHWT), and 9 healthy Beagle dogs. Methods: Prospective, case control study. ET 1 concentration was determined by ELISA in serum and in BALF. Results: No significant difference in serum ET 1 concentration was detected between healthy Beagle dogs and WHWT. Serum ET 1 concentration was higher in <b>dogs</b> <b>with</b> IPF (median interquartile range; 2. 32  pg/mL, 2. 05 - 3. 38) than healthy Beagle dogs (1. 28, 1. 07 - 1. 53; P <. 001), healthy WHWT (1. 56, 1. 25 - 1. 85; P <. 001), <b>dogs</b> <b>with</b> EBP (0. 94 0. 68 - 1. 01; P =. 001), and <b>dogs</b> <b>with</b> CB (1. 54 0. 74 - 1. 82; P =. 005). BALF ET 1 concentration was below the detection limit in healthy WHWT and in <b>dogs</b> <b>with</b> CB, whereas it was measurable in all <b>dogs</b> <b>with</b> IPF. A cut-off serum concentration of 1. 8  pg/mL had a sensitivity of 100 % and a specificity of 81. 2 % for detection of IPF, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0. 818.

40|$|Serology is {{currently}} {{used for the}} diagnosis of canine sino-nasal aspergillosis (SNA). However, the accuracy of serological testing using commercially available, standardized purified antigen preparations of Aspergillus (CAPurAspAg) has only been poorly documented. The aim {{of the present study}} was to assess the diagnostic value of an agar-gel double immunodiffusion (AGDD) test and an anti-Aspergillus IgG ELISA, using CAPurAspAg and the commercially available Platelia test for the detection of serum galactomannan. Sera from 17 <b>dogs</b> <b>with</b> SNA, 18 <b>dogs</b> <b>with</b> a nasal tumour (NT), 11 <b>dogs</b> <b>with</b> lymphoplasmacytic rhinitis (LPR) and 33 control <b>dogs</b> were tested <b>with</b> the 3 methods. AGDD result was positive in 76. 5 % of <b>dogs</b> <b>with</b> SNA, whereas all sera from <b>dogs</b> <b>with</b> non-fungal nasal disease and control dogs were negative. A positive IgG ELISA result was obtained in 88 % of <b>dogs</b> <b>with</b> SNA and in 18 % of <b>dogs</b> <b>with</b> LPR. All patients with NT and control dogs had a negative IgG ELISA result. The Platelia test was positive in 24 % of <b>dogs</b> <b>with</b> SNA, 11 % of <b>dogs</b> <b>with</b> NT, 9 % of <b>dogs</b> <b>with</b> LPR and 24 % of control dogs. The results of this study suggest that (1) the detection of serum Aspergillus-specific antibodies with AGDD or ELISA, using CAPurAspAg, provides excellent specificity and good sensitivity, (2) the specificity is higher for AGDD (100 %) than for ELISA (96. 8 %) while sensitivity is higher for ELISA (88. 2 %) than for AGDD (76. 5 %) and (3) serum galactomannan quantification with the Plateliat test is unreliable for the diagnosis of canine SNA.
