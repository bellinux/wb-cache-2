40|$|The term thin <b>glomerular</b> <b>basement</b> <b>membrane</b> <b>disease</b> (TBMD) {{refers to}} a {{condition}} characterised by thinning of the GBM at electron microscopy examination and, clinically, by isolated hematuria, frequently occurring in other family members, with no extra-renal manifestations. Progression towards chronic renal failure (CRF), although rare, has been reported and blood pressure is high in 30 - 35 % of cases during follow-up. TBMD is generally considered different from Alport syndrome since immunohistological investigation does not show abnormalities of type IV collagen alpha chains in the GBM, as frequently observed in Alport patients; moreover, in familial cases, the disease is transmitted as autosomal dominant trait, rarely observed in Alport syndrome. Genetic studies suggest that TBMD is a heterogeneous disease, but some cases may be related to mutations of COL 4 A 3 /COL 4 A 4 genes, thus belonging to the spectrum of type IV collagen diseases. TBMD may arise with other glomerular diseases, most frequently IgA nephropathy, and it remains to be established whether these cases are a casual occurrence or whether a thinner than normal GBM predisposes to immune complex deposition...|$|E

Morphological change in glomerular podocytes and the underlying <b>basement</b> <b>membrane</b> are frequently observed in disease, irrespective of the underlying molecular etiology. Standard electron microscopy techniques have enabled the identification and classification of glomerular diseases based on two-dimensional information, however complex three-dimensional ultrastructural relationships between cells and their extracellular matrix cannot be easily resolved with this approach. We employed serial block face-scanning electron microscopy to investigate Alport syndrome, the commonest monogenic glomerular disease, and compared findings to other genetic mouse models of glomerular disease (Myo 1 e−/−, Ptpro−/−). These analyses revealed the evolution of <b>basement</b> <b>membrane</b> and cellular defects through the progression of glomerular injury. Specifically we identified sub-podocyte expansions of the <b>basement</b> <b>membrane</b> with both cellular and matrix gene defects and found a corresponding reduction in podocyte foot process number. Furthermore, we discovered novel podocyte protrusions invading into the <b>glomerular</b> <b>basement</b> <b>membrane</b> in <b>disease</b> and these occurred frequently in expanded regions of <b>basement</b> <b>membrane.</b> These findings provide new insights into mechanisms of glomerular barrier dysfunction and suggest that common cell-matrix-adhesion pathways are involved in the progression of disease regardless of the primary insult...|$|R
40|$|Alport {{syndrome}} is a <b>glomerular</b> <b>basement</b> <b>membrane</b> (GBM) <b>disease</b> caused by mutations in type IV collagen genes. A unique irregular thickening and thinning of the GBM characterizes the progressive glomerular pathology. The metabolic imbalances {{responsible for these}} GBM irregularities are not known. Here we show that macrophage metalloelastase (MMP- 12) expression is > 40 -fold induced in glomeruli from Alport mice and is markedly induced in glomeruli of both humans and dogs with Alport syndrome. Treatment of Alport mice with MMI 270 (CGS 27023 A), a broad spectrum MMP inhibitor that blocks MMP- 12 activity, results in largely restored GBM ultrastructure and function. Treatment with BAY- 129566, a broad spectrum MMP inhibitor that does not inhibit MMP- 12, had no effect. We show that inhibition of CC chemokine receptor 2 (CCR 2) receptor signaling with propagermanium blocks induction of MMP- 12 mRNA and prevents GBM damage. CCR 2 receptor is expressed in glomerular podocytes of Alport mice, suggesting MCP- 1 activation of CCR 2 on podocytes may underlie induction of MMP- 12. These data indicate that the irregular GBM that characterizes Alport syndrome may be mediated, in part, by focal degradation of the GBM due to MMP dysregulation, in particular, MMP- 12. Thus, MMP- 12 /CCR 2 inhibitors may provide a novel and effective therapeutic strategy for Alport glomerular disease...|$|R

They were concerned that we had failed to refer to their earlier work, which has similarities but also differences with our report. We certainly want to acknowledge the contributions of Dr Deltas and other investigators and apologize for our oversight. We also want to reassure them {{that we did not}} intentionally omit or wanted to negate their prior contributions to the subject. In our study, we reported the frequency of COL 4 A 3 /COL 4 A 4 rare variants in a cohort of patients with a diagnosis of familial FSGS. After excluding mutations in known FSGS genes in a family, we performed whole exome sequencing to identify new gene for FSGS and found a segregating mutation in COL 4 A 3. We then screened the rest of our cohort (cohort referred to us with a diagnosis of familial FSGS) and found that 10 % of families have potential pathogenic mutations in COL 4 A 3 /A 4. Thus, we reported the frequency of COL 4 A 3 /A 4 mutations in patients with presumed familial FSGS. This differs somewhat from the findings in the references cited by Deltas and Pierides, which alluded to FSGS as an associated finding in patients with familial hematuria/thin <b>glomerular</b> <b>basement</b> <b>membrane</b> <b>disease</b> 3 - 7.

40|$|AIMS: To {{study the}} {{expression}} of cell adhesion molecules in the renal biopsy specimens of patients with systemic vasculitis and Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP); to correlate this with the severity of glomerular inflammation. METHODS: Renal biopsy specimens obtained from eight patients with untreated systemic vasculitis (four with Wegener's granulomatosis and four with microscopic polyarteritis), eight with HSP and nine controls (four with normal histopathology and five with thin <b>glomerular</b> <b>basement</b> <b>membrane</b> <b>disease)</b> were stained using the alkaline phosphatase anti-alkaline phosphatase method with monoclonal antibodies directed against intercellular adhesion molecule- 1 (ICAM- 1), vascular cell adhesion molecule- 1 (VCAM- 1) and E-selectin. RESULTS: Biopsy specimens of normal kidneys expressed ICAM- 1 in glomerular endocapillary cells, Bowman's capsule epithelium, interstitial cells and interstitial vascular endothelium, and VCAM- 1 in Bowman's capsule epithelium, proximal tubular epithelium and interstitial vascular endothelium. No staining with antibody directed against E-selectin was seen {{in any of the}} biopsy specimens. Biopsy specimens of patients with a vasculitic glomerulonephritis (segmental necrotising glomerulonephritis) expressed VCAM- 1 in glomerular endocapillary cells (four of eight patients with systemic vasculitis; two of eight patients with HSP). In patients with a systemic vasculitis glomerular VCAM- 1 expression was associated with a more severe renal lesoin (44, 50, 60, and 65 % of glomeruli involved) than in those not showing glomerular VCAM- 1 expression (3, 3, 11, and 39 % of glomeruli involved). CONCLUSION: Expression of VCAM- 1 by glomerular endocapillary cells in renal biopsy specimens raises the possibility that recruitment of VLA- 4 bearing leucocytes may contribute to glomerular injury in Wegener's granulomatosis and microscopic polyarteritis...|$|E

Systemic lupus erythematosus and the antiphospholipid syndrome are also causes of alveolar hemorrhage. We retrospectively reviewed 15 cases of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) associated with renal diseases. Diagnosis of DAH was based on the presence of bloody bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. There were three men and 12 women, {{with a mean age of}} 50. 5 years (extremes: 24 - 74 years). Proteinuria and hematuria were observed, respectively, in 15 and 14 cases. Six patients revealed arterial hypertension. Crescentic glomerulonephritis was diagnosed with kidney biopsies in ten cases. The etiology of renal disease was microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) in seven cases, Wegener disease in four cases, systemic lupus erythematous in one case, cryoglobulinemia in one case, myeloma in one case and propyl-thiouracil-induced MPA in one case. Hemoptysis occurred in 14 cases. The mean serum level of hemoglobin was 7. 1 g/dL (5. 1 - 10 g/dL). The mean serum creatinine concentration was 7. 07 mg/dL (2. 4 - 13. 7 mg/dL). Gas exchange was severely compromised, with an oxygenation index < 80 mmHg in 14 patients and < 60 mmHg in seven patients.

40|$|Laminin- 1 reexpression in Alport mouse <b>glomerular</b> <b>basement</b> <b>membranes.</b> BackgroundAlport <b>disease</b> is a {{heritable}} <b>basement</b> <b>membrane</b> disorder {{caused by}} mutations in genes encoding the α 3, α 4, or α 5 chains of type IV collagen, which normally comprise the collagenous network of mature <b>glomerular</b> <b>basement</b> <b>membranes</b> (GBMs). In Alport disease, the α 3 (IV), α 4 (IV), α 5 (IV) collagen network is absent and substituted for by α 1 (IV), and α 2 (IV) collagen, which normally is present only in developing, immature GBMs. The disease {{is marked by}} progressive GBM thickening and delamination, proteinuria, and renal failure. In addition to collagen IV dysregulation, abnormal GBM laminins also occur and {{may contribute to the}} pathogenesis of Alport glomerulopathy. MethodsTo investigate laminin dysregulation in a mouse model of Alport disease, we used antibodies specific for laminin-α 1 and -β 1 chains (to recognize laminin- 1), and -α 5 chain (to recognize laminin- 11), and evaluated their distribution during glomerular development in α 3 (IV) collagen-deficient mice. ResultsDeveloping glomeruli of infant α 3 (IV) collagen knockout mice underwent normal down-regulation of laminin- 1, but laminin- 1 chains were then reexpressed in maturing glomeruli, becoming concentrated in the subepithelial GBM projections typical of Alport disease. Immunoelectron microscopy showed that laminin- 1 reexpression took place in both glomerular endothelial cells and podocytes. ConclusionsThe absence of a α 3 (IV), α 4 (IV), α 5 (IV) network may stimulate reexpression of laminin- 1 by Alport mouse endothelial cells and podocytes. This abnormal GBM, which is more characteristic of immature glomeruli, may promote podocyte foot process effacement and reversion to a less differentiated state...|$|R

This memorandum discusses clinical, epidemiological, morphological, and immunopathological aspects of malaria-associated nephropathy, will special emphasis on immunological investigations.

Based on these urinary materials, we investigated the ability of expecting renal function in chronic glomerular diseases. In this study, we evaluated the relationship between glomerular filtration rate (GFR) urinary NAG, and urinary ?# 11437;M. Methods: We evaluated 52 children with chronic kidney disease at the Chung-Ang University Hospital between January 2003 and August 2009. We investigated the 24 -hour urinalysis and hematologic values in all 52 patients. Serum creatinine, creatinine clearance (Ccr), serum cystatin C, urinary ?# 11437;M and urinary NAG were measured. Results: Out of 52 patients, there were 13 children with minimal change in disease, 3 children with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, 17 children with immunoglobulin A nephropathy, 15 children with Henoch-Schonlein purpua nephritis, 3 children with poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis, and 1 child with thin <b>glomerular</b> <b>basement</b> <b>membrane</b> <b>disease.</b> In these patients, there were significant correlation between the Ccr and urinary NAG (r&# 61;- 0. 817 &# 59; P&# 38;amp&# 59;lt&# 59; 0. 01), and between the GFR (as determined by Schwartz method) and urinary NAG (r&# 61;- 0. 821 &# 59; P&# 38;amp&# 59;lt&# 59; 0. 01).

The mean patient age was 32. 4 years and the male to female ratio was 1 to 5. 3. The primary finding was microscopic hematuria in eighteen patients and gross hematuria in five patients. Among eighteen patients who had microscopic hematuria, one patient also exhibited proteinuria and one patient suffered from acute renal failure due to acute drug-induced interstitial nephritis. Proteinuria was only found in one patient. All of the patients had normal renal function, {{with the exception of}} one who suffered from acute renal failure. The duration of hematuria from the time of detection to the date of biopsy ranged from 3 months to 30 years with a mean interval of 56. 6 months.

40|$|Loin pain-hematuria {{syndrome}} {{associated with}} thin <b>glomerular</b> <b>basement</b> <b>membrane</b> <b>disease</b> and hemorrhage into renal tubules. Loin painhematuria (LPH) syndrome is a poorly understood disorder {{in which the}} patients, mainly young women, experience unexplained severe chronic unilateral or bilateral flank pain associated with gross and/or microscopic hematuria. By contrast, thin glomerular basement membrane (GBM) disease is generally {{thought to be a}} benign disorder, affecting males and females equally, in which the major manifestation is asymptomatic microscopic hematuria. Herein we describe seven patients (6 females, 1 male) in whom thin GBM appeared to be the cause of the LPH syndrome. The gross hematuria in these patients could be attributed to thin GBM disease because the renal biopsy demonstrated red cells in renal tubules (indicating glomerular hematuria) and the only glomerular abnormality present was thin GBM. In addition, the other causes of gross hematuria were excluded by appropriate testing. The flank pain in these patients might also have been the result of their thin GBM disease. This is suggested by renal biopsy findings of multiple renal tubules filled with red cells, apparently occluding the tubules. We suggest that occlusion of a relatively small fraction of renal tubules could cause renal pain if back-leak of glomerular filtrate occurred that was of sufficient magnitude to expand renal parenchymal volume and stretch the renal capsule. Preliminary observations suggest that treatment with the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril importantly reduces the frequency and severity of the episodes of gross hematuria and flank pain in most patients. ACE inhibition might decrease glomerular hemorrhage in patients with thin GBM by decreasing glomerular hydrostatic pressure. We conclude that (1) Thin GBM disease can be the cause of gross hematuria, apparently as a result of rupture of thin GBM. (2) Rupture of thin GBM resulting in hemorrhage into renal tubules may be the cause of the flank pain and gross hematuria in some patients with the LPH syndrome...|$|E

Because salts of bromide (KBr and NaBr) {{have been used as}} antiepileptic drugs for several decades, repositioning of Br- for BM diseases is probable. However, the effects of Br- on <b>glomerular</b> <b>basement</b> <b>membrane</b> (GBM) <b>disease</b> such as Alport syndrome (AS) {{and its impact on the}} kidney are still unknown. In this study, we administered daily for 16 weeks 75 mg/kg or 250 mg/kg (within clinical dosage) NaBr or NaCl (control) via drinking water to 6 -week-old AS mice (mouse model of X-linked AS). Treatment with 75 mg/kg NaBr had no effect on AS progression. Surprisingly, compared with 250 mg/kg NaCl, 250 mg/kg NaBr exacerbated the progressive proteinuria and increased the serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen in AS mice. Histological analysis revealed that glomerular injury, renal inflammation and fibrosis were exacerbated in mice treated with 250 mg/kg NaBr compared with NaCl. The expressions of renal injury markers (Lcn 2, Lysozyme), matrix metalloproteinase (Mmp- 12), pro-inflammatory cytokines (Il- 6, Il- 8, Tnf-α, Il- 1 β) and pro-fibrotic genes (Tgf-β, Col 1 a 1, α-Sma) were also exacerbated by 250 mg/kg NaBr treatment.

40|$|The {{second most}} common cause of chronic renal failure is glomerulonephritis, which is a {{collective}} term used for numerous diseases with the common denominator of histological renal inflammation emanating from the glomerular tuft. Whether all forms of glomerulonephritis should be considered as autoimmune disease is debatable, but immune mechanisms are important in all of them. This review focuses on four relatively well delineated forms of primary glomerulonephritis: Goodpastures or anti-GBM disease, IgA nephritis, membranous nephropathy and membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis. The autoantibodies are directed either to molecules within the glomeruli, such as the <b>glomerular</b> <b>basement</b> <b>membrane</b> in anti-GBM <b>disease</b> and to the podocytes in membranous glomerulonephritis, or to components of the immune system such as C 3 convertase in membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis and IgA in IgA nephritis.

Class I and II mRNA and protein were measured in isolated glomeruli and whole renal cortex using cDNA probes and monoclonal antibodies. The distribution of T cells and class I and II proteins was assessed by immunofluorescence. Normal glomeruli contained no T cells and were class II negative. By day 4, glomeruli contained MHC class I and II mRNA and protein and class II positive T cells. Although some animals had T cells in the periglomerular area, these cells were class II negative. By day 7 periglomerular T cells were largely class II positive (activated) and there was increased MHC class I and II mRNA and protein in whole renal cortex. Later T cells accumulated in the tubulo-interstitial compartment, which became diffusely positive for MHC classes I and II, but to a variable extent in different animals. Those with high class II mRNA expression also had detectable T cell antigen receptor mRNA by Northern analysis. The authors conclude 1) in this model there was a close association between mRNA abundance and protein expression for both MHC classes I and II in glomeruli and renal cortex as a whole; 2) in this model of glomerular injury there are three phases of activation. The first phase {{takes place in the}} glomerulus and is associated with accumulation of activated T cells and MHC class I and II protein in the glomerulus. Phase 2 is associated with the accumulation of periglomerular T cells and their becoming class II positive. There is subsequent dissemination (phase 3) of activated T cells and accumulation of class I and II mRNA and protein throughout the interstitial compartment. This spacial progression of glomerulocentric inflammation is likely associated with degree of injury and permanent loss of renal function...|$|E

40|$|Studies {{performed}} {{in the past two}} decades in animal models and in man have established the occurrence of two major forms of immunologically mediated glomerular disease; one results from the accumulation of antigen-antibody complexes in glomeruli (immune complex glomerulonephritis) and the other from the reaction of antibodies with constituents of the <b>glomerular</b> <b>basement</b> <b>membrane</b> (anti-GBM <b>disease).</b> 1 Although it has been suggested that cellmediated immunity (delayed hypersensitivity) may also produce glomerular injury (1, 2) clear-cut evidence for this mechanism has not been presented, except in renal allografts, and even in this setting only under special circumstances (3). Furthermore, in most morphologic studies of glomerulonephritis no mention is made of accumulation of mononuclear cells in glomeruli, and this has been used as an argument against a role of cell-mediated mechanisms (2, 4). Infiltrating mononuclear cells have, however, been described in glomeruli in some forms of experimental glomerular disease (5 - 10), although this provides, at best, indirect evidence for the operation of cell-mediated mechanisms. We have carried out studies based on a model of glomerular disease in rats that is characterized by conspicuous glomerular accumulation of mononuclear cells (10, 11). The disease is produced by intravenous injection of subnephritogenic doses of rabbit anti-rat GBM antiserum into rats that had been previously immunized with rabbit gamma globulin in adjuvant. Employing a modification of this model in which nonimmunized rats that had received subnephritogenic doses of rabbit anti-GBM antiserum were given lymph node cells from donors immunized with rabbit gamma globulin, we have obtained evidence that cellmediated mechanisms participate in the production of glomerular lesions...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{undertaken}} in order to investigate {{the nature of the}} glomerular damage in a form of experimental immune complex nephritis. The model of autologous immune complex nephritis (AIC) 1 (Heymann's nephritis) (1) was chosen for several reasons. First, the model bears a remarkable resemblance, in terms of ultrastructural and immunofluorescence features, to an important renal disease in man, membranous glomerulonephritis. Furthermore, the model is highly reproducible. In addition, the basic pathogenetic mechanism has been thoroughly documented (2 - 4). Briefly, the disease is produced in rats by immunization with homologous kidney preparations, which results in the formation of autoantibodies against a renal antigen, normally found in the brush border of proximal tubules. This antigen is presumed to enter the circulation in small amounts and combine with autoantibody to form complexes which deposit in glomeruli. 2 The complexes are detected as granular deposits of immunoglobulin and complement along the epithelial side of the <b>glomerular</b> <b>basement</b> <b>membrane.</b> The <b>disease,</b> like its human counterpart, is manifested by proteinuria, which is often heavy. Our approach was to use the enzymatic tracers horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (40, 000 daltons) and catalase (240, 000 daltons), and the electronopaque tracer ferritin (ca. 500, 000 daltons) as probe molecules with which to assess the altered functional properties of the glomerular capillary wall. These ultrastructural tracers can be directly visualized, and their location within the glomerular capillary wall can be followed at sequential intervals after intravenous injection.

40|$|Proximal tubular {{epithelial}} hyperplasia {{in patients}} with chronic glomerular proteinuria. BackgroundProteinuria is known to affect the proximal tubular epithelial structure and function. The present study tested the hypothesis that chronic proteinuria leads to hyperplasia of proximal tubular epithelium. MethodsThis hypothesis was tested by morphometric analysis of the renal biopsy specimens in two groups of patients. Group A (N = 15) was composed of patients with chronic glomerular proteinuria who, for clinical indications, underwent renal biopsy of their native kidneys on two separate occasions. The proteinuria was sustained during {{the first and second}} renal biopsies in all but two of the patients with minimal change nephrotic syndrome who experienced transient remission. Group B (N = 10) was composed of patients with little or no proteinuria who underwent renal biopsy because of unexplained hematuria and whose renal biopsy showed only thin <b>glomerular</b> <b>basement</b> <b>membrane</b> (GBM) <b>disease.</b> ResultsIn Group A, the mean number of epithelial cell nuclei per proximal tubule cross-section increased significantly from the first to the second renal biopsy (11. 0 ± 2. 7 vs. 13. 0 ± 2. 2,P = 0. 005, pairedt-test). Also, those with severe proteinuria showed proximal tubules with reactive epithelium (large pale nuclei with a high nucleus to cytoplasm ratio) and marked hyperplasia (double and triple layers of epithelium). Such changes were not seen in group B renal biopsies. Compared with group A biopsies, group B biopsies showed a lower mean value for proximal tubular epithelial cell nuclei per tubular cross-section (P = 0. 056) and a higher mean proximal tubular volume (P = 0. 049). As a consequence, the mean number of nuclei per relative tubular volume was significantly greater in group A compared with group B (0. 55 ± 0. 14 vs. 0. 40 ± 0. 06,P = 0. 003, by Wilcoxon rank sum). ConclusionsChronic heavy proteinuria is associated with hyperplasia of proximal tubular epithelium and contraction of proximal tubular volume. These events may impair glomerular filtration and represent another mechanism of progression of renal disease...|$|R

Previous {{evidence suggests that}} tissue transglutaminase (tTg) and its protein cross-link product epsilon(gamma-glutamyl) lysine contribute to the expanding renal tubulointerstitial and <b>glomerular</b> <b>basement</b> <b>membranes</b> in this <b>disease.</b> Using an in vitro cell culture model of renal proximal tubular epithelial cells we determined the link between elevated glucose levels with changes in expression and activity of tTg and then, by using a highly specific site directed inhibitor of tTg (1, 3 -dimethyl- 2 [(oxopropyl) thio]imidazolium), determined the contribution of tTg to glucose-induced matrix accumulation. Exposure of cells to 36 mm glucose over 96 h caused an mRNA-dependent increase in tTg activity with a 25 % increase in extracellular matrix (ECM) -associated tTg and a 150 % increase in ECM epsilon(gamma-glutamyl) lysine cross-linking. This was paralleled by an elevation in total deposited ECM resulting from higher levels of deposited collagen and fibronectin. These were associated with raised mRNA for collagens III, IV, and fibronectin. The specific site-directed inhibitor of tTg normalized both tTg activity and ECM-associated epsilon(gamma-glutamyl) lysine. Levels of ECM per cell returned to near control levels with non-transcriptional reductions in deposited collagen and fibronectin. No changes in transforming growth factor beta 1 (expression or biological activity) occurred that could account for our observations, whereas incubation of tTg with collagen III indicated that cross-linking could directly increase the rate of collagen fibril/gel formation. We conclude that Tg inhibition reduces glucose-induced deposition of ECM proteins independently of changes in ECM and transforming growth factor beta 1 synthesis thus opening up its possible application in the treatment other fibrotic and scarring diseases where tTg has been implicated...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} the {{biological}} cross-linker transglutaminase, the neutrophil oxidant hydrogen peroxide, and neutrophil proteinases on <b>glomerular</b> <b>basement</b> <b>membrane</b> permeability have been examined using an in vitro model of glomerular ultrafiltration. The main focus of the study lies in determining whether any of the test agents were able to render <b>glomerular</b> <b>basement</b> <b>membrane</b> more permeable to protein. Guinea pig liver transglutaminase {{was used as a}} model enzyme to test for the effect of biological cross-linkers on <b>glomerular</b> <b>basement</b> <b>membrane</b> permeability. It cross-linked <b>glomerular</b> <b>basement</b> <b>membrane</b> proteins, caused membrane contraction, and rendered <b>glomerular</b> <b>basement</b> <b>membrane</b> less permeable both to water and the low molecular weight protein marker myoglobin but had no effect on the membrane permeability to the high molecular weight marker protein bovine serum albumin or serum protein. The pathophysiological relevance of the effect is discussed. Hydrogen peroxide increased <b>glomerular</b> <b>basement</b> <b>membrane</b> permeability to water and proteins but the effect depended on hydrogen peroxide concentration and incubation time. The minimum concentration needed to render <b>glomerular</b> <b>basement</b> <b>membrane</b> more permeable to bovine serum albumin and serum protein was 1 M and the minimum incubation time needed was 6 hrs. A respiratory burst analysis of activated neutrophils showed that the average concentration of hydrogen peroxide that could be generated by the neutrophils was less than 50 mM and the time taken for extracellular hydrogen peroxide concentration to fall off to zero was less than 1 hr. Therefore, neutrophils seemed unable to generate and sustain a sufficiently high hydrogen peroxide concentration to render <b>glomerular</b> <b>basement</b> <b>membrane</b> more permeable to protein in vivo. Proteinases extracted from pig neutrophil granules were used to assess their effect on <b>glomerular</b> <b>basement</b> <b>membrane</b> permeability. The extract showed activity against <b>glomerular</b> <b>basement</b> <b>membrane</b> and the activity was primarily attributed to the serine proteinases elastase and cathepsin G, judged from substrate and inhibitor analyses. The proteinase extract also contain latent metalloproteinases, activatable by the organomercurial 4 -aminophenyl mercuric acetate and calcium ions. Once activated, they also showed activity against <b>glomerular</b> <b>basement</b> <b>membrane.</b> The extract rendered <b>glomerular</b> <b>basement</b> <b>membrane</b> more permeable to water, myoglobin, bovine serum albumin, and serum protein. The increase in membrane permeability to water and proteins was due to membrane thinning and an increase in the intrinsic porosity of the membrane. When the serine and metalloproteinases were allowed to act in concert, they synergistically degraded <b>glomerular</b> <b>basement</b> <b>membrane</b> and increased the membrane permeability to serum protein and water. The study provides the first direct evidence that pathophysiological amounts of serine and metalloproteinases are able to render <b>glomerular</b> <b>basement</b> <b>membrane</b> more permeable to protein and suggests they may be capable of promoting proteinuria in neutrophil-dependent forms of immune glomerulonephritis. </p...|$|R

Anionic sites were investigated by pretreatment of tissue with glycosaminoglycan-degrading enzymes prior to cationic gold staining. The distribution of chondroitin sulphate proteoglycans [...] a previously unrecognized <b>glomerular</b> <b>basement</b> <b>membrane</b> component [...] and type IV collagen was examined by immunoelectron microscopy to identify structural changes in the <b>basement</b> <b>membrane.</b> Findings were {{compared with those of}} non-diabetic patients showing minor proteinuria and morphologically normal <b>glomerular</b> <b>basement</b> <b>membranes.</b> Two patients, originally diagnosed as having diabetic nephropathy were also examined at 19 weeks and 5 years after renal transplantation. Characteristic redistribution of type IV collagen and chondroitin sulphate proteoglycans was noted in thickened <b>glomerular</b> <b>basement</b> <b>membrane</b> segments (> 400 nm) of diabetic patients and those with renal transplants. Extension of anionic sites deep into the <b>glomerular</b> <b>basement</b> <b>membrane</b> at pH 2. 5, together with loss of interna sites at pH 5. 8 is unique to diabetic nephropathy. Reduced charge density was apparent in some patients due to thickening of the <b>glomerular</b> <b>basement</b> <b>membrane,</b> although the number of anionic sites per unit length of membrane was actually increased. Thus, charge aberration in diabetic nephropathy is due to displacement rather than loss of anionic sites. Removal of more than 90 % of these sites by heparitinase, confirms their association with heparan sulphate proteoglycans. Similar derangement of anionic sites in all patients with diabetic nephropathy irrespective of the degree of proteinuria, suggests that a heparan sulphate proteoglycan-related charge barrier plays a minor role in controlling permeability of the diabetic <b>glomerular</b> <b>basement</b> <b>membrane...</b>|$|R
