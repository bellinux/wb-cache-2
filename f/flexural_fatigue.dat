40|$|Traditionally {{the correct}} {{modeling}} and prediction of asphalt fatigue mechanisms, has re-lied {{on the use}} of the appropriate mode of loading in laboratory tests. The mode of load-ing chosen should, as closely as possible, reflect the mode of loading that causes crack propagation in the field. However recent formulations may be opening the door to the determination of key parameters from either mode of loading. Fatigue characterization using any model must recognize that controlled load or dis-placement will induce significantly different fatigue lives in laboratory tests. When those lives must be correlated to actual field performance the magnitude and the accuracy of the shift factor is strongly affected by the mode of load selected in the laboratory material characterization phase.

The pins also caused swelling of the laminate that reduced the fibre volume content. Despite the damage, the pins did not affect the flexural modulus of the laminate. However, increasing the volume content or diameter of the pins caused a steady decline in the <b>flexural</b> strength and <b>fatigue</b> life, which appear to be governed by fiber rupture on the tensile side of the laminate.

The results of the constant-amplitude tests have been presented in S-N diagrams and a Goodman diagram. From these results it emerged that fatigue life was strongly reduced by alternation of the stress from tension to compression. Furthermore the number of cycles to failure for wet specimens was lower than for dry ones. It was also found that for equal load signals applied, flexural tests resulted in longer fatigue lifes than concentric tests, probably because of the possibility of redistribution of stresses. The longitudinal strains of the concentric tests were analysed. This resulted in a strong relation between strain rate and fatigue life.

40|$|The {{mechanical}} behaviour of three continuous silicon carbide fibre-reinforced glass-ceramic matrix composites {{has been investigated}} at room and high temperatures. Commercially available composites with magnesium aluminosilicate, calcium aluminosilicate and barium magnesium aluminosilicate glass-ceramic matrices were considered.

30|$|The fatigue {{behavior}} of beams was modeled using the FAM, {{and the results}} produced were verified using He’s experimental data. He’s test beams were used to study {{the effect of the}} steel corrosion degree, the fatigue load range, and the prestress level on the fatigue life, fatigue strength, stiffness, and post-fatigue ultimate capacity. The test beams were assumed to be corroded at a low level (i.e., 0 – 5 % average mass loss), a medium level (i.e., 5 – 10 % average mass loss) and a high level (i.e., 10 – 20 % average mass loss) and were subsequently strengthened with a single layer of a prestressed CFRP sheet. The ACI Committee 440 (2000) recommends that the maximum prestressed tensile stress of CFRP sheets is limited to 0.55 of their ultimate strength to avoid brittle fracture. Previous studies have also shown that the loss of prestress in CFRP sheets averages 10 – 30 % of the control tensile stress (Yang and Li 2010). Thus, in the model, the maximum tensile prestress of the CFRP sheets was limited to 0.55 of the ultimate strength, and the effective prestress levels in the CFRP sheets were 0, 2742, and 4113 με, which were approximately 0, 20, and 30 % of the ultimate strain of the CFRP sheets, respectively. The minimum <b>fatigue</b> <b>flexural</b> moment was determined to be 8.2 kN m, and the maximum <b>fatigue</b> <b>flexural</b> moments were 13.4, 14.9, 16.4, and 17.9 kN m, which represented 45.0, 50.0, 55.0, and 60.0 % of the ultimate strength of the uncorroded, unstrengthened beam, respectively.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is two-fold. First, we attempt to fit the experimental data on the <b>flexural</b> <b>fatigue</b> of plain and fiber-reinforced concrete with a probabilistic model (Saucedo, Yu, Medeiros, Zhang and Ruiz, Int. J. Fatigue, 2013, 48, 308 – 318). This model was validated for compressive fatigue at various loading frequencies, but not for <b>flexural</b> <b>fatigue.</b> Since the model is probabilistic, {{it is not necessarily}} related to the specific mechanism of fatigue damage, but rather generically explains the fatigue distribution in concrete (plain or reinforced with fibers) for damage under compression, tension or flexion. In this work, more than 100 series of <b>flexural</b> <b>fatigue</b> tests in the literature are fit with excellent results. Since the distribution of monotonic tests was not available in the majority of cases, a two-step procedure is established to estimate the model parameters based solely on fatigue tests. The coefficient of regression was more than 0. 90 except for particular cases where not all tests were strictly performed under the same loading conditions, which confirms the applicability of the model to <b>flexural</b> <b>fatigue</b> data analysis. Moreover, the model parameters are closely related to fatigue performance, which demonstrates the predictive capacity of the model. For instance, the scale parameter is related to flexural strength, which improves with the addition of fibers. Similarly, fiber increases the scattering of fatigue life, which is reflected by the decreasing shape parameter.

The main topics include microscope damage observation, described by fiber/matrix debonding and interfacial failure, endurance limit with Wohler curves, effect of self-heating temperature. For both tests, the surface temperature increases with an increasing applied load. The {{results show that the}} self-heating has an important effect in the failure point where the Wohler curves join each other.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental and numerical {{study on the}} structural health monitoring of composite patch repairs using chirped fibre Bragg grating (CFBG) sensors. The repair consisted of bonding a pre-cured patch of the same, but thinner, material to a parent GFRP panel containing a machined hole, with the sensors embedded in the bond-line. The repaired coupons were subjected to four-point <b>flexural</b> loading in <b>fatigue.</b> Bond-line delamination cracks (disbonds) initiated {{at both ends of}} the patch repair and grew towards the centre of the repair. Predictions of the strain distributions enabled the reflected spectra obtained during damage growth to be predicted with good agreement between theory and experiment. For practical applications when using CFBG sensors to monitor patch repairs, the results suggest that two sensors should be included within the bond-line so that both vulnerable edges of the repair can be monitored using the low-wavelength end of a sensor...|$|R
40|$|The Superpave binder {{specifications}} are performance-based {{criteria for}} binder selection {{for use in}} hot-mix asphalt mixtures. However, these specifications may not be applicable to modified binders. This research investigates the a new method for determining hot-mix asphalt mixing and compaction temperatures {{as well as the}} performance of neat (unmodified) and modified binders of the same performance grade. The first phase of the research focuses on determining mixing and compaction temperatures for hot-mix asphalt mixtures. Modified binders are shear rate and temperature dependent and the conventional methods of determining mixing and compaction temperatures can yield extreme results. The Zero Shear Viscosity theory is used as an alternative method to determine hot-mix asphalt mixing and compaction temperatures. The results reveal that the method is applicable to determining mixing and compaction temperatures for hot-mix asphalt mixtures containing modified binders, but additional work is needed {{in order to make the}} method applicable to neat binders. The second phase of the study investigates the performance of hot-mix asphalt mixtures containing neat and modified binders. Laboratory tests were performed on similar mixtures that contained neat and modified binders. Simple performance tests, such as accelerated rutting, <b>flexural</b> beam <b>fatigue,</b> and indirect tensile indicate that modified binders may contribute to improved hot-mix asphalt resistance to various distresses. Overall, performance-graded binders of the same grade appear to offer similar performance regardless of the high temperature at which the binder meets the high temperature specification...|$|R
40|$|The {{long term}} {{performance}} of {{hot mix asphalt}} (HMA) pavements is significantly impacted by {{the properties of the}} HMA mixture. Regardless of how well the mix design and structural design have been prepared, the properties of the materials delivered to the job site, such as gradation, binder content, and the in-place compaction will ultimately control the behavior of the pavement under the combined action of traffic and environment. The job mix formula allows for certain tolerances in the HMA construction. This research studied the effect of construction variability on performance if the delivered product goes outside the tolerances range. The construction variability was studied for the northern (Lockwood) and southern (Sloan) Nevada aggregate sources mixed with an unmodified AC- 20 and AC- 30, respectively. Forty-two mixes were prepared for each source and tested for general strength using the resilient modulus, for rutting using the Asphalt Pavement Analyzer, for <b>fatigue</b> using the <b>flexural</b> beam <b>fatigue</b> and for thermal cracking using the Thermal Stress Restrained Specimen Test. Construction variability has a significant impact on pavement performance regardless of the aggregate source and binder type. However, some laboratory prepared mixtures may provide better performance than the optimum mixture but such mixtures may be impractical in the field. If the contractor violates the specification limits, then there is 81 % chance that the pavement section will have lower performance than the optimum mix, therefore quality control is recommended to keep the mixes within the specification limits.
