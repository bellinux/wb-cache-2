5|$|As a result, most geysers form {{in places}} where there is {{volcanic}} rhyolite rock which dissolves in <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> <b>and</b> forms mineral deposits called siliceous sinter, or geyserite, along {{the inside of the}} plumbing systems which are very slender. Over time, these deposits strengthen the channel walls by cementing the rock together tightly, thus enabling the geyser to persist, as mentioned in the previous section.|$|E
5|$|Silkworms, the {{caterpillars}} and pupae of {{the moth}} Bombyx mori, have been reared to produce silk in China from the Neolithic Yangshao period onwards, c. 5000 BC. Production spread to India by 140 AD. The caterpillars are fed on mulberry leaves. The cocoon, produced after the fourth moult, {{is covered with}} a continuous filament of the silk protein, fibroin, gummed together with sericin. In the traditional process, the gum is removed by soaking in <b>hot</b> <b>water,</b> <b>and</b> the silk is then unwound from the cocoon and reeled. Filaments are spun together to make silk thread. Commerce in silk between China and countries to its west began in ancient times, with silk known from an Egyptian mummy of 1070 BC, and later to the ancient Greeks and Romans. The silk road leading west from China was opened in the second century AD, helping to drive trade in silk and other goods.|$|E

25|$|In 1913, William P. Heryford {{commissioned}} {{the construction of}} a three-story commercial building in downtown Lakeview, {{across the street from the}} Lake County courthouse. The Heryford Brothers Building cost approximately $100,000 to construct. When it was completed, the building was the largest and most expensive structure in Lakeview.

25|$|Gelatin readily dissolves in <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> <b>and</b> sets to a gel on cooling. When added {{directly}} to cold water, {{it does not}} dissolve well, however. Gelatin also is soluble in most polar solvents. Gelatin solutions show viscoelastic flow and streaming birefringence. Solubility {{is determined by the}} method of manufacture. Typically, gelatin can be dispersed in a relatively concentrated acid. Such dispersions are stable for 10–15 days with little or no chemical changes and are suitable for coating purposes or for extrusion into a precipitating bath.|$|E

25|$|In warm climates where air {{conditioning}} is used, any household device that gives off heat {{will result in}} a larger load on the cooling system. Items such as a stove, dish washer, clothes dryer, <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> <b>and</b> incandescent lighting all add heat to the home. Low power or insulated versions of these devices give off less heat for the {{air conditioning}} to remove. The air conditioning system can also improve in efficiency by using a heat sink that is cooler than the standard air heat exchanger such as geothermal or water.|$|E
