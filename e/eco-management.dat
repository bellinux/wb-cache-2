With {{a very few}} exceptions, there are no studies on forms, factors and efficiency of “eco-driven” market inclusion of smallholders in modern supply chains in Bulgaria. This paper presents findings of a first large-scale study on state, driving forces, and efficiency of market inclusion of farms through enhanced <b>eco-management</b> in Bulgaria. First, diverse forms of <b>eco-management</b> in farms with different size, market orientation, product specialization, and location are identified. Second, costs, effects, and efficiency of <b>eco-management</b> are assessed, including the extent the improve eco-performance contributes to increased market inclusion of farms. Third, critical personal, economic, contractual, institutional, etc. factors of managerial choice in the eco-active farms are specified. Forth, perspectives of expansion of this particular mode of market inclusion of Bulgarian smallholdes are estimated. Finaly, directions for improving public policies and business strategies of smallholders in Bulgaria and other countries with similar conditions are suggested. Keywords.

Discussions are frequently found in the environmental press regarding the possible advantages to an organisation should they implement a formal environmental management system such as BS 77 S 0, ISO 14001 and the EC <b>Eco-Management</b> and Audit Scheme (EMAS). It is also widely recognised that these formal systems, although theoretically applicable to all, are often seen by many organisations as being too unwieldy, too prescriptive, frequently too expensive and often too public. However, there are many alternative options available to organisations who do not wish to commit themselves to a formal accredited system. This paper discusses the various options currently in use for informal environmental management in agriculture with particular reference to a computerised system being developed at the University of Hertfordshire.
