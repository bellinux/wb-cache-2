5|$|Turning Urine Samples into Brain Cells: This new {{technique}} of reprogramming ordinary cells present in urine into immature brain cells that can form multiple types of functioning neurons and glial cells {{was developed by}} Chinese researchers in China, and {{was published in the}} scientific journal Nature Methods in December 2012. Instead of using retrovirus, they used vectors which the researchers say is a breakthrough This does not involve embryonic stem cells which come with serious drawbacks when transplanted, such as the risk of developing tumours. This technique makes the procedure of generating Induced pluripotent stem cells far easier and non-invasive, as the cells can be obtained from a urine sample instead of a blood sample or biopsy. This research proves <b>human</b> <b>excreta</b> could be a powerful source of cells to study disease, bypassing some of the problems of using stem cells, and could be useful for research studying the cellular mechanisms of neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's and for testing the effects of new drugs that are being developed to treat them.|$|E

50|$|Sanitation is {{the means}} of {{promoting}} hygiene through the prevention of human contact with hazards of wastes especially faeces, by proper treatment and disposal of the waste, often mixed into wastewater. These hazards may be physical, microbiological, biological or chemical agents of disease. Wastes that can cause health problems include <b>human</b> and animal <b>excreta,</b> solid wastes, domestic wastewater (sewage or greywater), industrial wastes, and agricultural wastes. Hygienic means of prevention may involve engineering solutions (e.g., sanitary sewers, sewage treatment, surface runoff management, solid waste management, excreta management), simple technologies (e.g., pit latrines, dry toilets, urine-diverting dry toilets, septic tanks), or even simply by behavior changes in personal hygiene practices, such as hand washing with soap.|$|R
40|$|Despite {{advances}} in biological and medical sciences, fungi and parasites still may cause considerable health problems for contemporary humans. Knowledge concerning pathogenic fungi, protozoans, helminths and arthropods is rising; {{new methods of}} diagnostics and prevention are introduced, but still expanding of the occurrence ranges {{of some of these}} pathogens is observed. A number of factors may be the cause i. a., supplying of food and drinking water of inadequate quality, poor level of hygiene, also in health care units, inappropriate management of <b>human</b> and animal <b>excreta</b> and intensity of human migration, as well as changing of climatic zones while travelling. In addition, pathogens and potentially pathogenic organisms are changing some of their features, which facilitates invasion to human organism, survival and development in or over the host.

25|$|Internal {{pathogen}} destruction {{rates are}} usually low, particularly helminth eggs, such as Ascaris eggs. This carries {{the risk of}} spreading disease if a proper system management is not in place. Compost from <b>human</b> <b>excreta</b> processed under only mesophilic conditions or taken directly from the compost chamber is not safe for food production. High temperatures or long composting times are required to kill helminth eggs, the hardiest of all pathogens. Helminth infections are common in many developing countries.|$|E
25|$|Moreover, micro-pollutants {{can also}} become {{concentrated}} in sewage sludge. Following treatment, sewage sludge is either landfilled, incinerated, applied on agricultural land or, in some cases, retailed or given away for free {{to the general}} public. Each of these disposal options comes with myriad potential—and in some cases proven—human health and environment impacts. By not mixing <b>human</b> <b>excreta</b> with water and the other contaminants that are disposed of in sewers and septic tanks, UDDTs thus avoid {{many of the problems}} associated with these practices.|$|E
25|$|In rural areas, village {{committees}} {{which are}} community-based organizations, provide services. Its members operate the systems without remuneration. In terms of rural sanitation, <b>human</b> <b>excreta</b> are systematically used as manure for fertilising crops and vegetables. In many houses, the excreta of all {{family members are}} collected in buckets {{over the course of}} five to seven days, and then taken to the field and applied raw in the crops.

25|$|Sewage and fecal sludge management: In cholera-affected areas, {{sewage and}} fecal sludge {{need to be}} treated and managed {{carefully}} {{in order to stop}} the spread of this disease via <b>human</b> <b>excreta.</b> Provision of sanitation and hygiene is an important preventative measure. Open defecation, release of untreated sewage, or dumping of fecal sludge from pit latrines or septic tanks into the environment need to be prevented.

Therefore, the implementation of dry toilets that do not contribute to water pollution, as they do not flush with water, may be an interesting alternative to flush toilets.|$|E
25|$|Sanitation. National Household Budget Surveys ask {{respondents}} {{about the}} type of sanitary facility they have. In 2007 93% of Tanzanians responded that they had some form of latrine, but only 3% had a flush toilet. International statistics that monitor {{the achievement of the}} Millennium Development Goal for sanitation are based on these numbers, but only after making some important adjustments in an effort to achieve comparability across countries. The Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation (JMP) defines improved sanitation as excreta disposal systems that are private and that separate <b>human</b> <b>excreta</b> from human contact. Shared latrines or open pit latrines are excluded from this definition. The JMP estimates that only about half the latrines in Tanzania can be considered improved sanitation systems. Based on that definition, access to improved sanitation is much lower than the population with access to any type of latrine. According to the JMP definition, access to improved sanitation was only 10% in 2010, up from 8% in 1990, with an increase in urban areas and a slight decrease in rural areas.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The house fly, Musca domestica {{has long}} been {{considered}} a potential agent for disease transmission ever since its existence. The general truth of this assertion remains undisputed till the present day in spite of increasing awareness toward an improved sanitation and better hygiene. The habitual movement of house fly from filthy substrata such as <b>human</b> faeces, animal <b>excreta,</b> carcasses, garbage, etc. makes them ideal candidates for disease transmission such as cholera, shigellosis, salmonellosis and others when settling on food. Fly as a potential mechanical vector of pathogenic bacteria was elucidated in this study by examining flies from various breeding sites such as food courts, dumping ground, food processing areas and poultry farm in Peninsular Malaysia. The flies were baited with 10 % sugar solution on a glass slide in the field. All materials used for collection of samples were sterile.

The transfer of arsenic from arsenic to wallpaper to human beings was a further mystery. While removal of the wallpaper resulted in disappearance of toxic symptoms, painting over the wallpaper did not.The source of toxicity was arsine (arsenic hydride), an extremely toxic gas formed on reduction of the nonvolatile arsenates present in wallpaper.

40|$|Cities in the {{developing}} countries have multiple modes of human and animal waste treatment and disposal that finally decide the overall impact on the urban ecosystem, and these have been studied {{for the city of}} Bangalore. Four modes are found, namely underground sewage systems, decentralized soak pits and septic tanks, open defecation and a miniscule effort at composting. The extent of N released per unit area is high, ranging between 0. 44 and 1. 4 t $ha^{- 1 }$ of the urban landscape. In this study the N release and outflow have been estimated. The N entering or flowing in the lithosphere,hydrosphere and in wastewater streams forms the major component. The pool size has first been determined. The size and movement through these pools were estimated with a view to determine the state of the N cycle {{and if there is a}} cause for alarm in similar cities in other developing countries. N contribution from <b>human</b> waste (<b>excreta</b> and urine) forms the singlelargest influx and sewage flowing out of the city forms the single largest efflux of N pool. Owing to a seemingly large use of soak pits and open conveyance of sewage in some parts of the city, coliforms and $NO_ 3 $–N have seeped into shallow and deep-ground aquifers and show up in ground- and sub-soil waters in the city. The level of N in these waters at a few places is slightly higher than the permissible limits. This suggests that there is a need to find alternatives to modes like the ubiquitous soak pit, such that pollution of shallow and deep aquifers is avoided in the future. Currently,there is little effort in stripping the waste water off N. Also, there is no significant effort in recovery and reuse of nutrients, and this is required to increase the sustainability levels...|$|R
