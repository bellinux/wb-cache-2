25|$|Price testified {{again that}} a dozen armed negro men entered the <b>gondola</b> <b>car.</b> She said Patterson had fired {{a shot and}} ordered all whites but Gilley off the train. She said the negros had ripped her clothes off and {{repeatedly}} raped her at knife point, and pointed out Patterson {{as one of the}} rapists. She said they raped her and Bates, afterward saying they would take them north or throw them in the river. She testified that she had fallen while getting out of the <b>gondola</b> <b>car,</b> passed out and came to seated in a store at Paint Rock. Leibowitz questioned her until Judge Callahan stopped court for the day at 6:30. When he resumed the next morning, he pointed out many contradictions among her various versions of the rape.|$|E

25|$|Olen Montgomery {{testified that}} he had been alone on a tank car the entire trip, and had not known about the fight or alleged rapes. Ozie Powell said that while he was not a participant, he had seen the fight with the white {{teenagers}} from his vantage point between a box car and a <b>gondola</b> <b>car,</b> where he had been hanging on. He said he saw the white teenagers jump off the train. Roberson, Montgomery, and Powell all denied they had known each other or the other defendants before that day. Andy Wright, Eugene Williams, and Haywood Patterson testified that they had previously known each other, but had not seen the women until the train stopped in Paint Rock. Knight questioned them extensively about instances in which their testimony supposedly differed from their testimony at their trial in Scottsboro. They did not contradict themselves in any meaningful way.|$|E
2500|$|Dr. Bridges {{repeated}} his testimony {{from the first}} trial. Other witnesses testified that [...] "the negroes" [...] {{had gotten out of}} the same <b>gondola</b> <b>car</b> as Price and Bates; a farmer claimed to have seen white women [...] with the black youths.|$|E
2500|$|This {{trial was}} {{interrupted}} {{and the jury}} sent out when the Patterson jury reported; they found him guilty. There was no uproar at the announcement. Ruby Bates took the stand, identifying all five defendants as among the 12 entering the <b>gondola</b> <b>car,</b> putting off the whites, and [...] "ravishing" [...] her and Price.|$|E
50|$|A rotary car dumper or wagon tippler (UK) is a {{mechanism}} used for unloading certain railroad cars such as hopper <b>cars,</b> <b>gondolas</b> or lorries (tipplers, UK). It holds the rail {{car to a}} section of track and rotates the track and car together to dump out the contents. Used with <b>gondola</b> <b>cars,</b> it is making open hopper cars obsolete. Because hopper cars require sloped chutes in order to direct the contents to the bottom dump doors (hatches) for unloading, <b>gondola</b> <b>cars</b> allow cars to be shorter, thus lowering their center of gravity, while carrying the same gross rail load.|$|R

2500|$|When Judge Horton {{announced}} his decision, Knight {{stated that he}} would retry Patterson. He {{said that he had}} found Orville [...] "Carolina Slim" [...] Gilley, the white teenager in the <b>gondola</b> <b>car,</b> and that Gilley would corroborate Price's story in full. At Knight's request, the court replaced Judge Horton with Judge William Washington Callahan, described as a racist. He later instructed the jury in the next round of trials that no white woman would voluntarily have sex with a black man.|$|E

She testified that she, Price and Gilley were arrested, and that Price made the rape accusation, instructing her {{to go along with the}} story to stay out of jail.

The stone was loaded into narrow gauge wooden <b>gondola</b> <b>cars</b> the stone would be transferred to standard gauge <b>gondola</b> <b>cars</b> via a purpose built rotating 'barrel' at Salida. Once the branch was converted to standard gauge it was worked with 4 axle GP9s and in later days GP30s, GP35s and GP40s. 6 axle SD9s were tested on the branch but derailed due to the tight curves. Diesels assigned to the branch were given modified dynamic brakes {{to cope with the}} 4.5% grades.|$|R

50|$|In {{comparison}} with the mass-produced <b>gondola</b> <b>car</b> of model 12-9046, a new model has an all-metal welded body volume which is increased by 2 cubic meters to 87 cubic meters. The cover of the side and the end walls is made of smooth sheet instead of the curved profile. On the end wall two zones and five efforts of the P-shaped cross section are set, which ensure high rigidity for the perception of stress in the collisions. Tare weight of the <b>gondola</b> <b>car</b> is reduced per ton. Bearing metal frame, body, parts of the brake linkage, cover of the body, the hatch covers are made of low-alloyed steel according to GOST 19281-89 14 category, the strength class of which {{is not less than}} 390. Centre girder is equipped with more technologically advanced and reliable in operation welded lugs. The running gear of the <b>gondola</b> <b>car</b> consists of 2 two-axle bogies of model 18-7020, which are equipped with elastic-rolling runner skids of a new system. In order to improve traffic safety the gondola is equipped with a new system of separate braking carts. Overhaul of the new gondola is increased to 32 years, whereas mileage of nowadays produced analogues is 22 years.|$|E

50|$|In 1888, the Raritan River Rail Road began {{operation}} with two 4-4-0 engines (No.1 and No.2) and twenty 20-ton <b>gondola</b> <b>cars.</b> These small cars {{were used by}} Suchs and Crossmans to move the sand and clay found in the area.|$|R

50|$|Alternatives to {{the rotary}} dump cars are bottom dump cars with bottom doors, and back end hoes which unload <b>gondola</b> <b>cars.</b> The former has the {{disadvantage}} that any imperfection in the seals {{of the doors}} allows material to spill onto the track.|$|R
