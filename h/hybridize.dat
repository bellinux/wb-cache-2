5|$|Plant {{species that}} are genetically {{compatible}} may not <b>hybridize</b> in nature for various reasons, including geographical isolation, differences in flowering period, or differences in pollinators. Species that are brought together by humans in gardens may <b>hybridize</b> naturally, or hybridization can be facilitated by human efforts, such as altered flowering period or artificial pollination. Hybrids are sometimes created by humans to produce improved plants that {{have some of the}} characteristics of each of the parent species. Much work is now being done with hybrids between crops and their wild relatives to improve disease-resistance or climate resilience for both agricultural and horticultural crops.|$|E
5|$|Of these relatives, {{the range}} of the black-throated gray warbler {{overlaps}} with those of Townsend's warbler and the hermit warbler, but they occur in different habitats. While Townsend's and hermit warblers commonly <b>hybridize</b> with each other, records of either species hybridizing with the black-throated gray warbler are uncommon.|$|E
5|$|Plant species often <b>hybridize</b> {{more readily}} than animal species, and the {{resulting}} hybrids are fertile more often. Many plant species {{are the result of}} hybridization, combined with polyploidy, which duplicates the chromosomes. Chromosome duplication allows orderly meiosis and so viable seed can be produced.|$|E
50|$|Known Iris spuria cultivars include; 'Adobe Sunset' (<b>hybridized</b> by McCown, 1976), 'AJ Balfour', 'Albulus', 'Archie Owen' (<b>hybridized</b> by Hager, 1970), 'Barbara's Kiss' (<b>hybridized</b> by McCown, 1981), 'Belise' (<b>hybridized</b> by Simonet, 1964), 'Belissinado' (<b>hybridized</b> by Corlew, 1988), 'Betty Cooper' (<b>hybridized</b> by McCown, 1981), Iris 'Betty My Love' (<b>hybridized</b> by Wickenkamp, 1988), Iris 'Blue Lassie' (<b>hybridized</b> by Niswonger, 1978), 'Cambridge Blue', 'Cheroke Chief', 'Clarke Cosgrove', 'Custom Design', 'Daenaensis', 'Danica', 'Dawn Candle', 'Georgian Delicacy', 'Halophila lutea', 'Imperial Bronze', 'Media Lux','Norton Sunlight', 'Protege', 'Monspur', 'Premier', and 'Red Clover'.|$|R
50|$|The {{properties}} of amorphous carbon films {{vary depending on}} the parameters used during deposition. The primary method for characterizing amorphous carbon is through the ratio of sp2 to sp3 <b>hybridized</b> bonds present in the material. Graphite consists purely of sp2 <b>hybridized</b> bonds, whereas diamond consists purely of sp3 <b>hybridized</b> bonds. Materials that are high in sp3 <b>hybridized</b> bonds are referred to as tetrahedral amorphous carbon, owing to the tetrahedral shape formed by sp3 <b>hybridized</b> bonds, or as diamond-like carbon (owing to the similarity of many physical properties to those of diamond).|$|R
40|$|Transfer RNA's were {{isolated}} from Euglena gracilis. Chloroplast cistrons for tRNA were quantitated by <b>hybridizing</b> tRNA to ct DNA. Species of tRNA <b>hybridizing</b> to ct DNA were partially purified by hybridization-chromatography. The tRNA's <b>hybridizing</b> to ct DNA and nuclear DNA {{appear to be}} different. Total cellular tRNA was <b>hybridized</b> to ct DNA to an equivalent of approximately 25 cistrons. The total cellular tRNA was also separated into 2 fractions by chromatography on dihydroxyboryl substituted amino ethyl cellulose. Fraction I <b>hybridized</b> to both nuclear and ct DNA. Hybridizations to ct DNA indicated approximately 18 cistrons. Fraction II-tRNA <b>hybridized</b> only to ct DNA, saturating {{at a level of}} approximately 7 cistrons. The tRNA from isolated chloroplasts <b>hybridized</b> to both chloroplast and nuclear DNA. The level of hybridization to ct DNA indicated approximately 18 cistrons. Fraction II-type tRNA could not be detected in the isolated chloroplasts...|$|R
5|$|Some {{species of}} anurans <b>hybridize</b> readily. For instance, the edible frog (Pelophylax esculentus) is a hybrid between the pool frog (P. lessonae) and the marsh frog (P. ridibundus). The fire-bellied toads Bombina bombina and B. variegata {{are similar in}} forming hybrids. These are less fertile than their parents, giving rise to a hybrid zone where the hybrids are prevalent.|$|E
5|$|Bottlenose {{dolphins}} {{have been}} known to <b>hybridize</b> with other dolphin species. Hybrids with Risso's dolphin occur both in the wild and in captivity. The best known is the wolphin, a false killer whale-bottlenose dolphin hybrid. The wolphin is fertile, and two currently live at the Sea Life Park in Hawaii. The first was born in 1985 to a female bottlenose. Wolphins also exist in the wild. In captivity, a bottlenose dolphin and a rough-toothed dolphin hybridized. A common dolphin-bottlenose dolphin hybrid born in captivity lives at SeaWorld California. Other hybrids live in captivity around the world and in the wild, such as a bottlenose dolphin-Atlantic spotted dolphin hybrid.|$|E
5|$|Hellenization {{was coined}} by the German {{historian}} Johann Gustav Droysen to denote {{the spread of}} Greek language, culture, and population into the former Persian empire after Alexander's conquest. That this export took place is undoubted, and {{can be seen in}} the great Hellenistic cities of, for instance, Alexandria, Antioch and Seleucia (south of modern Baghdad). Alexander sought to insert Greek elements into Persian culture and attempted to <b>hybridize</b> Greek and Persian culture. This culminated in his aspiration to homogenize the populations of Asia and Europe. However, his successors explicitly rejected such policies. Nevertheless, Hellenization occurred throughout the region, accompanied by a distinct and opposite 'Orientalization' of the successor states.|$|E
50|$|This species {{sometimes}} <b>hybridizes</b> with Dudleya edulis in the {{one area}} where they occur together. Less often it <b>hybridizes</b> with Dudleya lanceolata.|$|R
50|$|Once {{the capture}} and {{extender}} molecules {{are in place}} and they have <b>hybridized,</b> the sample can be added. Target molecules in the sample will bind to the extender molecule. So we have a base peppered with capture probes, which are <b>hybridized</b> to extender probes, which in turn are <b>hybridized</b> to target molecules.|$|R
50|$|Fruit: ovoid, tuberculate, spiny, skin yellow (sometimes red/orange, when <b>hybridized),</b> seeds black; {{interior}} white (sometimes pink, when <b>hybridized),</b> edible, {{having a}} pleasant, mildly sweet flavor.|$|R
5|$|In DNA, fraying {{occurs when}} non-complementary regions exist {{at the end}} of an {{otherwise}} complementary double-strand of DNA. However, branched DNA can occur if a third strand of DNA is introduced and contains adjoining regions able to <b>hybridize</b> with the frayed regions of the pre-existing double-strand. Although the simplest example of branched DNA involves only three strands of DNA, complexes involving additional strands and multiple branches are also possible. Branched DNA can be used in nanotechnology to construct geometric shapes, see the section on uses in technology below.|$|E
5|$|The Victorian and Tasmanian subpopulations of the crossback stingaree differ {{markedly}} in habitat {{preferences and}} merit further taxonomic investigation, {{according to the}} International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). This ray {{is closely related to}} the yellowback stingaree (U.sufflavus). In addition to morphological similarities, the two may also <b>hybridize</b> (see below) and, in a 2007 study of 388 fishes by Robert Ward and Bronwyn Holmes, were the only species that could not be distinguished {{on the basis of their}} cytochrome c gene sequences, attesting to a close evolutionary relationship.|$|E
5|$|The {{species is}} aplacental viviparous, with the {{developing}} embryos sustained to term by histotroph ("uterine milk") {{produced by the}} mother. Females bear litters of up to four pups every other year, after a gestation period of at least six months. This species is closely related to, and may <b>hybridize</b> with, the yellowback stingaree (U.sufflavus). The venomous sting of the crossback stingaree is potentially injurious to humans. This common species is seldom caught by commercial fisheries other than in the northernmost extent of its range. Thus, its population is largely secure and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed it under Least Concern.|$|E
50|$|Black sage readily <b>hybridizes</b> {{with three}} other coastal scrub Salvias: Salvia apiana (white sage), Salvia leucophylla, and Salvia clevelandii. It rarely <b>hybridizes</b> with the annuals Salvia columbariae and Salvia carduacea.|$|R
40|$|Tetracycline-resistant Tet M-negative {{isolates}} of Actinomyces viscosus, Eubacterium lentum, Mobiluncus curtisii, and Mobiluncus mulieris {{were screened}} with the Tet K, Tet L, and Tet O DNA probes. Ten (71 %) of the resistant Mobiluncus strains <b>hybridized</b> with the Tet O probe, {{two of the}} three E. lentum strains <b>hybridized</b> with the Tet K probe, and the A. viscosus isolate <b>hybridized</b> with the Tet L probe...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Fluorescence-labeled DNA probes {{constructed}} from three whole house mouse (Mus domesticus) chromosomes were <b>hybridized</b> to metaphase spreads from deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus) to identify homologies between the species. Mus Chr 7 probe <b>hybridized</b> strongly to the ad-centromeric two-thirds of Peromyscus Chr 1 q. Most of Mus 3 probe <b>hybridized</b> principally to two disjunct segments of Peromyscus Chr 3. Mus Chr 9 probe <b>hybridized</b> {{entirely to the}} whole Peromyscus Chr 7. Three Pero-myscus linkage groups were assigned to chromosomes, based on linkage homology with Mus. The data also are useful in interpre-tation of chromosomal evolutionary history in myomorphic ro-dents...|$|R
5|$|Another {{reason for}} DNA testing was to {{determine}} the rates of hybridization between pallid and shovelnose sturgeon. The southern populations have more hybrids than are found in the middle sections of the Missouri River basin, while the northernmost populations have had few reports of hybrids. Hybrids are most common in the Atchafalaya River in Louisiana, and DNA sequencing in these hybrids showed a genetic distinction from pallid sturgeon, but based on the genetic markers assessed, they were genetically indistinguishable from shovelnose sturgeon. Because of this ability of two species to <b>hybridize,</b> some biologists have expressed concern that it is a violation of the Endangered Species Act to protect one species that may not be genetically isolated from another. It is not known if the hybrids are able to reproduce or not, although they appear {{to be the result of}} pallid sturgeon eggs being fertilized by shovelnose sturgeon males.|$|E
5|$|Different {{authors have}} {{variously}} reported the birth length at between , and the maturation length at between , with females usually maturing at a slightly larger size than males. This range of sizes may reflect life history differences in crossback stingarees across {{different parts of}} its range. Both sexes mature at around six years of age, and can live to at least 11 years. The crossback stingaree may <b>hybridize</b> naturally with the closely related yellowback stingaree off southern New South Wales, where the distributions of the two species overlap and apparent hybrid offspring with intermediate color patterns have been found. If true, this would represent {{one of the few}} known cases of hybridization among cartilaginous fishes.|$|E
5|$|Europe {{is home to}} {{only three}} species: D. intermedia, D. anglica, and D. rotundifolia. Where the ranges of the two latter species overlap, they {{sometimes}} <b>hybridize</b> to form the sterile D. × obovata. In addition to the three species and the hybrid native to Europe, North America {{is also home to}} four additional species; D. brevifolia is a small annual native to coastal states from Texas to Virginia, while D. capillaris, a slightly larger plant with a similar range, is also found in areas of the Caribbean. The third species, D. linearis, is native to the northern United States and southern Canada. D. filiformis has two subspecies native to the East Coast of North America, the Gulf Coast, and the Florida panhandle.|$|E
40|$|We analyze Biology and Chemistry school {{textbooks}} {{to understand how}} conceptions of contextualization and technologies are overtaken and <b>hybridized.</b> We consider that textbooks produce meanings (senses and signifieds) in curricular policies. These are cultural productions that were <b>hybridized</b> and recontextualized according to Basil Bernstein and Stephen Ball. We argue that the focus on contextualization and technologies expressed in those textbooks are <b>hybridized</b> from several influences {{and they do not}} represent a consensus about those conceptions...|$|R

40|$|Eleven of 12 tetracycline-resistant Listeria innocua strains, {{isolated}} from chicken or turkey frankfurters and mozzarella cheese, {{were shown to}} carry DNA sequences which <b>hybridized</b> with the Tet M probe; of these, two strains also <b>hybridized</b> with Tet K. The remaining strain <b>hybridized</b> with the Tet K probe only. The Tet M determinant appeared to be located on the chromosome; in one case, it was transferable by conjugation to recipients Listeria monocytogenes, Listeria ivanovii, and Enterococcus faecalis...|$|R

25|$|Some {{cichlids}} readily <b>hybridize</b> with related species, both in {{the wild}} and under artificial conditions. Other groups of fishes, such as European cyprinids, also <b>hybridize.</b> Unusually, cichlid hybrids have been put to extensive commercial use, in particular for aquaculture and aquaria. The hybrid red strain of tilapia, for example, is often preferred in aquaculture for its rapid growth. Tilapia hybridization can produce all-male populations to control stock density or prevent reproduction in ponds.|$|E
40|$|In situ {{hybridization}} of cloned cDNA probes to frozen {{sections of}} Xenopus laevis stage- 42 tadpoles {{has been used}} to determine the tissue localization of several mRNAs. Nine out of sixteen probes tested <b>hybridized</b> to most or all tadpole tissues; seven probes exhibited tissue-specific hybridization. The non-tissue-specific sequences <b>hybridized</b> to RNA species that are also present in maternal RNA while the tissue-specific sequences <b>hybridized</b> to embryonic RNA species induced after gastrulation and undetectable in maternal RNA. Tissue-specific hybrid-ization was observed with muscle (five clones), epidermis (one clone), and the nervous system (one clone). All muscle-specific sequences <b>hybridized</b> to somites and lateral plate muscles, but they differed in their hybridization to heart muscle...|$|R
40|$|Two hundred twenty group D streptococci {{isolated}} from 1953 to 1954 from {{patients in the}} Washington, D. C., area were characterized. All were susceptible to ampicillin, vancomycin, and gentamicin; none produced beta-lactamase activity. High-level resistance to streptomycin was expressed by 117 strains, and 2 strains were resistant to > 8 microg of chloramphenicol per ml. Three isolates were resistant to both erythromycin and lincomycin, and DNA from these <b>hybridized</b> to an ermAM probe. Of 118 strains resistant to tetracycline and minocycline, genomic DNA from 63 was examined for homology to tet(M), tet(O), and tet(S). DNA from 20 strains <b>hybridized</b> to tet(M), DNA from 37 strains <b>hybridized</b> to tet(S), and DNA from none of the strains <b>hybridized</b> to tet(O) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{complementary}} {{strands of}} adenovirus type 12 DNA were separated, and virus-specific RNA was analyzed by saturation hybridization in solution.

Late nuclear RNA <b>hybridized</b> to about 90 % of the 1 strand and at least 36 % of the h strand. Double-stranded RNA was isolated from infected cells late after infection, which annealed to greater than 30 % {{of each of the}} two complementary DNA strands. Early whole cell RNA <b>hybridized</b> to 45 to 50 % of the 1 strand and 15 % of the h strand, whereas early cytoplasmic RNA <b>hybridized</b> to about 15 % of each of the complementary strands.

25|$|Detasseling corn is {{removing}} the pollen-producing flowers, the tassel, from {{the tops of}} corn (maize) plants and placing them on the ground. It {{is a form of}} pollination control, employed to cross-breed, or <b>hybridize,</b> two varieties of corn.|$|E
25|$|Sarracenia species <b>hybridize</b> {{and produce}} fertile {{offspring}} freely, making proper classification difficult. Sarracenia hybrids {{are able to}} <b>hybridize</b> further, giving the possibility of hundreds of different hybrids that have multiple species in varying amounts in their ancestry. Since many species ranges overlap, natural hybrids are relatively common. As a result, initial classification included many of these hybrids as separate species. A recent census {{of the number of}} hybrids and cultivars of Sarracenia species revealed about 100 unique hybrids and cultivars in cultivation. Many hybrids of Sarracenia are still commonly referred to by their obsolete species names, particularly in horticulture. These hybrids are all popularly cultivated by carnivorous plant enthusiasts, and there are consequently a huge number of hybrids and cultivars, most bred for showy pitchers.|$|E
50|$|Simple MH3 group 13 {{hydrides}} have a trigonal planar molecular geometry. This {{is due to}} the sp2 <b>hybridized</b> {{center and}} vacant p-orbital, and contrasts with the trigonal pyramidal geometry of the pnictogen hydrides which are sp3 <b>hybridized</b> and contain a non-bonding lone pair or electrons.|$|R
50|$|This Delphinium {{commonly}} <b>hybridizes</b> {{with its}} relative, Delphinium glaucum. Hybrids {{may be more}} common in the habitat than individuals of the parent species.

40|$|The {{topology}} {{of repeated}} sequences in mouse plasmocytoma DNA was studied by high-resolution CsCl {{density gradient centrifugation}} and heterogeneous nuclear RNA·DNA hybridization. Satellite region DNA of plasmocytoma cells contains additional components and <b>hybridizes</b> specifically with entire heterogeneous nuclear RNA molecules. A linkage is demonstrated between the A+T-rich satellite sequences and those <b>hybridizing</b> with heterogeneous nuclear RNA. Heavy DNA also <b>hybridizes</b> specifically with heterogeneous nuclear RNA molecules that show sequence similarity to heterogeneous nuclear RNA <b>hybridized</b> to satellite DNA. These results could suggest that part of satellite DNA became heavier after integration of some other DNA species, which could belong to a virus or to immunoglobulin repetitive genes. Dispersed, highly repetitive, short nucleotide sequences could constitute recognition sites for such a process...|$|R
