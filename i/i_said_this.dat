2500|$|Despite {{widespread}} belief Laudrup joined arch-rivals Real Madrid in {{an attempt}} to [...] "get back" [...] at Cruyff, the decision was based on the fact Real Madrid had been struggling for a long period and were eager to return to supremacy, like Barcelona when he decided to join them. Laudrup said, [...] "People say I wanted to go to Real Madrid just to get revenge. I say revenge from what? I've had a perfect time; five fantastic years here [...] I went to Madrid because they were so hungry to win, and they had four or five players who went to the World Cup. <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>this</b> would be perfect; new coach, new players, and hungry to win." ...|$|E

Tommy Garrett of Canyon News said the [...] "two Mrs. Ridge Forresters" [...] had escalated to [...] "all out war". After Stephanie's death, Taylor and Brooke's animosity against one another reignites as Taylor grows closer to Eric in 2013.

2500|$|During initial {{interrogation}} {{without a}} lawyer, the police used suggestive question techniques to introduce Andersen {{to the idea}} that Viggo Kristiansen was a participant and even the leading force of the crime. The interrogator wrote the following in the police rapport: [...] "I explained for Andersen that the police now knew {{he was one of the}} perpetrators. I also told Andersen about the advantages he would get by explaining everything", and furthermore: [...] "I asked Andersen if he himself could be a victim in some sense since his best buddy Viggo Kristiansen could have been the most active participant. When <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>this,</b> it was obvious that Andersen got something to think about. We talked a little bit back and forth about the relationship between Andersen and Kristiansen, and there was no doubt that Kristiansen was the strong one, the one in charge".|$|E

2500|$|... "There was a {{guy named}} Dan Jones who was then about 60years old, who was a wino {{who lived in a}} fleabag in the bad part of town. Jones was well known to rescue. In June of '69 they got a call—man down—it was Jones. They put the paddles on him, he was in VF, started CPR, zapped him, he came back to sinus rhythm, brought him into ER and three days later he was out and walking around. In gratitude, about a week later, he came down to Station 1, which he had never done before, and he {{said he would like to}} talk to the man who saved his life. They told me they had never seen Dan Jones in a clean shirt and sober, both of which he was that day. He would {{periodically}} come to the fire house and just say hello and he seemed to be sober. In my talks in those days <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>this</b> was the new cure for alcoholism. That was our first true save." ...|$|E
2500|$|In December 2013, Beyoncé {{explained}} {{the idea behind}} [...] "Bow Down" [...] on iTunes Radio: [...] "The reason I put out 'Bow Down' is because I woke up, I went into the studio, I had a chant in my head, it was aggressive, it was angry, it wasn't the Beyoncé that wakes up every morning. It was the Beyoncé that was angry. It was the Beyoncé that {{felt the need to}} defend herself. And if the song never comes out…OK! I said it! And I listened to it after I finished, and <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> <b>This</b> is hot! I'mma put it out. I'm not going to sell it. I'm just going to put it out. People like it, great; they don't, they don't. And I won't do it every day because that's not who I am. But I feel strong. And anyone that says, 'Oh that is disrespectful,' just imagine the person that hates you. Imagine a person that doesn't believe in you. And {{look in the mirror and}} say, 'Bow down, bitch' and I guarantee you feel gangsta! So listen to the song from that point of view again if you didn't like it before." ...|$|E
2500|$|Some Democratic {{critics of}} Bush {{suggested}} that the memos were produced by the Bush campaign to discredit the media's reporting on Bush's National Guard service. The chairman of the Democratic National Committee, Terry McAuliffe, {{suggested that the}} memos might have originated with long-time Bush strategist Karl Rove. McAuliffe told reporters on September 10, [...] "I {{can tell you that}} nobody at the Democratic National Committee or groups associated with us were involved in any way with these documents," [...] he said. [...] "I'm just saying that I would ask Karl Rove the same question." [...] McAuliffe later pointed out that Rove and another Republican operative, Ralph E. Reed, Jr., had [...] "a known history of dirty tricks," [...] and he asked whether Republican National Committee chairman Ed Gillespie would rule out any involvement by GOP consultant Roger Stone. At a community forum in Utica, New York in 2005, U.S. Representative Maurice Hinchey (D-NY) pointed out that the controversy served Rove's objectives: [...] "Once they did that, then it undermined everything else about Bush's draft dodging. ... That had the effect of taking the whole issue away." [...] After being criticized, Hinchey responded, [...] "I didn't allege I had any facts. <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>this</b> is what I believe and take it for what it's worth." ...|$|E

On July 30, 2012, Hamilton released a collaboration mixtape entitled Cinematic Hallucinations: The Bully And The Pet with rapper S.K.E. The Heistman. On August 17, 2012 during an interview Hamilton talked about his change in his music stating [...] "When I was incarcerated, my songs got a little more aggressive, but after I did some time and came back to NYC, I was a little upset at my fans because they were saying some pretty harsh things about me when I was locked up. This is not how you should approach somebody whos been showing you guys free love". Hamilton also talked about how mental illness and drug use didn't {{have anything to do with}} him taking a step back from music stating [...] "People were blaming insanity because certain details didn't hit the surface, but it had nothing to do with drugs, it had nothing to do with alcohol". Hamilton also discussed about his former deal with Interscope Records stating [...] "MC Lyte said it best it was a fight to get me off Interscope. I put out more projects than the entire Interscope roster from 2008 to 2010, and it took Eminem to come out and trump that, as far as getting physical sales numbers. Interscope had to choose between traditional and the new wave, and <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>this</b> new wave costs yall less money and less compromise but it took people on the inside to say to Interscope yall don't know what you're doing with this kid. A lot of the inner workings weren't made clear to me, and I took it very personally". On December 21, 2012 Hamilton released his extended play entitled The Come Down.|$|E
