2500|$|Outside the mouth, {{signs of}} swelling, {{bruising}} and deformity {{can all be}} seen. [...] Condylar fractures are deep, so it is rare to see significant swelling although, the trauma can cause fracture of the bone on the anterior aspect of the <b>external</b> <b>auditory</b> <b>meatus</b> so bruising or bleeding can sometimes {{be seen in the}} ear canal. [...] Mouth opening can be diminished (less than 3cm). [...] There can be numbness or altered sensation (anesthesia/paraesthesia in the chin and lower lip (the distribution of the mental nerve).|$|E
2500|$|This type of {{fractured}} mandible {{can involve}} one condyle (unilateral) or both (bilateral). Unilateral condylar fracture may cause restricted and painful jaw movement. There may be swelling over the temporomandibular joint region and {{bleeding from the}} ear because of lacerations to the <b>external</b> <b>auditory</b> <b>meatus.</b> [...] The hematoma may spread downwards and backwards behind the ear, which may be confused with Battle's sign (a sign of a base of skull fracture), although this is an uncommon finding so if present, intra-cranial injury must be ruled out. If the bones fracture and overlie each other there may be shortening of {{the height of the}} ramus. This results in gagging of the teeth on the fractured side (the teeth meet too soon on the fractured side, and not on the non fractured side, i.e. [...] "open bite" [...] that becomes progressively worse to the unaffected side). [...] When the mouth is opened, there may be deviation of the mandible towards the fractured side. [...] Bilateral condylar fractures may cause the above signs and symptoms, but on both sides. Malocclusion and restricted jaw movement are usually more severe. Bilateral body or parasymphysis fractures are sometimes termed [...] "flail mandible", and can cause involuntary posterior movement of the tongue with subsequent obstruction of the upper airway. Displacement of the condyle through the roof of glenoid fossa and into the middle cranial fossa is rare. Bilateral condylar fractures combined with a symphyseal fracture is sometimes termed a guardsman's fracture. The name comes from this injury occurring in soldiers who faint on parade grounds and strike the floor with their chin.|$|E

50|$|The {{procedure}} {{was derived from}} a medical experiment first performed by Ádám Politzer of Vienna that involved studying the air movement through the Eustachian tube by connecting a manometer to the <b>external</b> <b>auditory</b> canal <b>meatus</b> and another manometer in the pharynx. His first results on the technique were published in 1861 and he introduced a pear-shaped rubber air-bag for performing the procedure in 1863, which {{came to be known}} as a Politzer bag. This system was far more practical and less difficult for the patient than catheterizing the Eustachian tube and brought fame to Politzer.|$|R
6000|$|Section 116. The eighth nerve {{runs from}} the brain case (Cr.), into the periotic bone, and is {{distributed}} to the several portions of this labyrinth. In an ordinary fish this internal ear is the sole auditory organ we should find; the sound-waves would travel through the water to the elastic cranium and so reach and affect the nerves. But in all air-frequenting animals this original plan of an ear has to be added to, to fit it to the much fainter sound vibrations of the compressible and far less elastic air. A [...] "receiving apparatus" [...] is needed, and is supplied by the ear-drum, middle ear, or tympanic cavity (T.). In the mammal {{there is also a}} collecting ear trumpet (the ear commonly so-called), the external ear, and <b>external</b> <b>auditory</b> <b>meatus</b> (e.a.m.). A tightly stretched membrane, the tympanic membrane, separates this from the drum. A chain of small bones, the malleus (m.), the incus (i.), the os orbiculare (o.or.), a very small bone, and a stirrup-shaped stapes, swing across the tympanum, from the tympanic membrane to the internal ear. At two points the bony investment of this last is incomplete-- at the fenestra rotunda (f.r.), and at the fenestra ovalis, (f.o.), into which latter the end of the stapes fits, and so communicates the sound vibrations of the tympanic membrane to the endolymph. A passage, the Eustachian tube, communicates between the tympanic cavity and the pharynx (Ph.), and serves to equalize the pressure {{on either side of the}} drum-head. A comparative study of the ears of the vertebrata brings to light the fact that, as we descend in the animal scale, the four ear ossicles are replaced by large bones and cartilages connected with the jaw, and the drum and Eustachian tube by a gill slit. We have, in fact, in the ear, as the student will perceive in the sequel, an essentially aquatic auditory organ, added to and patched up to fit the new needs of a life out of water.|$|E

50|$|Politzer {{received}} his M.D. in 1859 {{and started to}} work in Carl Ludwig's laboratory. His interest since that time was mainly the physics of the auditory system. There, {{he was the first}} to demonstrate physiologically that the innervation of the tensor tympani muscle was by the trigeminal nerve and that the innervation of the stapedial muscle was by the facial nerve. In another series of experiments, Politzer connected two manometers, one placed in the <b>external</b> <b>auditory</b> canal <b>meatus</b> and another in the pharynx, in order to study air movements through the Eustachian tube. In 1861, he published his first results on a new technique based on this knowledge, to treat internal ear diseases by insufflating the middle ear through the Eustachian tube, which obviated the need of its catheterization. This came to be known as politzerisation. In the subsequent decades, the technique was widely adopted throughout the world, bringing fame to Politzer.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{potential}} {{demand for}} hearing aids is increasing {{in accordance with}} aging of populations in many developed countries. Because certain patients cannot use air conduction hearing aids, they usually use bone conduction hearing aids. However, bone does not transmit sound as efficiently as air, and bone conduction hearing aids require surgery (bone anchored hearing aid) or great pressure to the skull. The first {{purpose of this study}} is to examine the efficacy of a new sound conduction pathway via the cartilage. The second purpose is to develop a hearing aid with a cartilage conduction transducer for patients who cannot use regular air conduction hearing aids. Design/methodology/approach: We examined the hearing ability of a patient with atresia of both <b>external</b> <b>auditory</b> <b>meatuses</b> via three kinds of conduction pathways (air, bone, and cartilage). After the best position for the cartilage conduction transducer was found, audiometric evaluation was performed for his left ear with an insertion earphone (air conduction), a bone conduction transducer, and a cartilage conduction transducer. Then we made a new hearing aid using cartilage conduction and got subjective data from the patients. Findings: The tragal cartilage was the best position for the cartilage conduction transducer. The patient’s mean hearing levels were 58. 3 dBHL, 6. 7 dBHL, and 3. 3 dBHL for air conduction, bone conduction, and cartilage conduction respectively. The hearing ability of the patients obtained from the cartilage conduction hearing aid was comparable to those from the bone conduction hearing aid. Practical implications: Hearing levels using cartilage conduction are very similar to those via bone conduction. Cartilage conduction hearing aids may overcome the practical disadvantages of bone conduction hearing aids such as pain and the need for surgery. Originality/value: We have clarified the efficacy of the cartilage conduction pathway and developed a prototype ‘cartilage conduction hearing aid’, which is the first hearing aid to use sound transmission via cartilage...|$|R

The frameless MRI stereotaxic technique was evaluated in 8 rhesus macaque monkeys using 3 D fast gradient echo MRI images with 0. 7 mm isotropic resolution. 1) Difference in stereotaxic coordinates of fiducial markers was compared between a traditional stereotaxic frame and the frameless MRI technique (n= 2). 2) Differences in stereotaxic coordinates for cerebral regions were compared between the frameless MRI technique and MRI obtained with the animal positioned in a MRI-compatible stereotaxic frame (n= 4). 3) The frameless MRI technique was further refined to prescribe electrode penetrations within a dural recording chamber in stereotaxic coordinates relative to the electrode microdrive. Differences in MRI coordinates were compared with the electrode microdrive (n= 3).
