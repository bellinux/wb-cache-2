40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the interoperability of <b>e-business</b> <b>processes</b> {{by using an}} ontology approach with description logic and agent systems to achieve e-business automation. An innovative e-business process modeling framework is proposed that outlines the building blocks required for Internet-based e-business in order to enable e-business process automation. The framework helps in understanding the role of many proposed standards {{with respect to the}} building blocks and in identifying both overlaps and gaps among them. The domain knowledge of <b>e-business</b> <b>processes</b> is conceptualised as an e-business process ontology that enables agents’ communication in e-business application sharing and reusing. Several agent-based automation mechanisms are discussed based on the ontology that provides implementation guidelines to e-business process automation...|$|E
40|$|With new and {{emerging}} e-business technologies to transform business processes, {{it is important}} to understand how those technologies will affect the performance of a business. Will the overall business process be cheaper, faster and more accurate or will a sub-optimal change have been implemented? The use of simulation to model the behaviour of business processes is well established, and it has been applied to <b>e-business</b> <b>processes</b> to understand their performance in terms of measures such as lead-time, cost and responsiveness. This paper introduces the concept of simulation components that enable simulation models of <b>e-business</b> <b>processes</b> to be built quickly from generic e-business templates. The paper demonstrates how these components were devised, as well as the results from their application through case studies...|$|E
40|$|Model {{checking}} is {{a promising}} technique for the verification of complex software systems. As {{the use of}} the Internet for conducting e-business extends the reach of many organizations, well-designed software becomes the foundation of reliable implementation of <b>e-business</b> <b>processes.</b> These distributed, electronic methods of conducting transactions place reliance on the control structures embedded in the transaction processes. Deficiencies in control structures of processes that support e-business can lead to loss of physical assets, digital assets, money, and consumer confidence. Yet, assessing the reliability of <b>e-business</b> <b>processes</b> is complex and time-consuming. This paper explicates how mode l-checking technology can aid in the design and assurance of <b>e-business</b> <b>processes</b> in complex digital environments. Specifically, we demonstrate how model checking can be used to verify e-business requirements concerning money atomicity, goods atomicity, valid receipt, and communication-link failure. These requirements are fundamental to many e-business applications. Model che cking can be used to test a broad range of systems requirements - not only for system designers, but also for auditors and security specialists. Systems that are examined by auditors need to have adequate controls built in prior to implementation and will need adequate auditing after implementation to ensure that none of the processes have been corrupted. Model checkers may also provide value in examining the processes of highly integrated applications as found in enterprise resource planning systems. © 2005 IEEE. Link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|This study {{addressed}} the need human resource managers have {{in establishing a}} culture to identify and encourage information exchanges, thereby reducing the training and orientation time for new employees. The goal of this project was to develop and validate an <b>e-business</b> <b>process</b> model enabling human resource management professionals to understand and effectively apply knowledge management to reduce the time necessary to train and orient new employees. A matrix was created to list criteria to {{be incorporated into the}} <b>e-business</b> <b>process</b> model. The matrix contained newcomer training problems and knowledge management solutions documented from the review of literature. Through a series of surveys, human resource manager expert panel and knowledge management committee members validated the criteria listed in the matrix. The validated criteria were used to develop the <b>e-business</b> <b>process</b> model. A combination of a software development model and Instructional System Design processes were used as guidelines to develop a prototype. A combination of two formative and one summative evaluation measures was utilized to evaluate the prototype. The formative evaluation procedures included a) a group of business managers conducting a heuristic evaluation of the model against the criteria identified in the matrix, and b) the researcher conducting a self-audit to review the <b>e-business</b> model <b>process</b> contents against established quality policy and procedure standards. The summative evaluation was comprised of the human resource manager expert panel and knowledge management committee members responding to a technology acceptance model questionnaire to predict perceived value and voluntary use of the <b>e-business</b> <b>process</b> model to implement a knowledge management solution to training needs. The evaluations conducted on the <b>e-business</b> <b>process</b> model indicated that the target audience perceived the model as a valuable tool. In particular, the outcome of the technology acceptance model questionnaire clearly demonstrated the effectiveness of the prototype in the areas of usability, ease of use and availability of resources. The study has demonstrated that an <b>e-business</b> <b>process</b> model can be developed and successfully applied as a tool to enable human resource professionals to understand and apply knowledge management to resolve new employee training needs...|$|R

40|$|In e-business, {{addressing}} the technical issues {{alone is not}} enough to drive the evolution of existing legacy applications, but it is necessary to consider problems concerning the strict relationship that exists between the evolution of the legacy system and the evolution of the <b>e-business</b> <b>process.</b> In order to support the evolution, this chapter proposes a strategy for extracting the requirements for a legacy system evolution from the requirements of the <b>e-business</b> <b>process</b> evolution. The strategy includes a toolkit composed of a set of decision tables and a measurement framework, both referring to the organization, business processes, and legacy software systems. The decision tables allow the identification of the processes to be evolved, the actions to be performed on them and their activities, and the strategies to be adopted for evolving the information systems. The measurement framework aims at achieving a greater understanding of the processes and related problems, taking into account organizational and technological issues...|$|R
40|$|Although {{a number}} of methodologies exist for {{business}} process re-design (BPR), supply chain re-design (SCR), and <b>e-business</b> <b>process</b> design, {{there is a lack}} of an integrated BPR methodological framework to support supply chain integration (SCI). This paper proposes a detailed framework based on integrating {{a number of}} different methodological strands from the literature. A literature review was conducted in three different domains – business process re-design, supply chain re-design and <b>e-business</b> <b>process</b> design. The literature review revealed the potential for integrating elements of a number of different methods and techniques found in different methodological strands into a framework for conducting BPR to support SCI. Accordingly a number of relevant methodologies were identified, decomposed and compared at their stage and technique/method level to identify a combination for development of the integrated framework. The proposed BPR methodology can be applied in any company or sector; methods and techniques incorporated are not specific to any sector.

40|$|The {{rapid pace}} of change in {{technology}} coupled with global economic and environmental changes has had considerable impact on all business sectors. Consequently, organisations are forced to drive towards efficiency savings, productivity improvements and increased collaboration to cope with current demands. This has resulted in execution of electronic ways of conducting business activities increasingly becoming a key strategic approach for many organizations. Electronic business (<b>e-business)</b> <b>processes</b> have taken businesses to new dimensions and organisations are moving away from traditional processes to modern ways of working {{through the use of}} electronic media. These new approaches create new pathways to gain competitive advantage and they guarantee valuable rewards for organizations. Even though the possibilities afforded are evident, compared to other industries the level of e-business implementation within the construction industry is not widespread and robust as anticipated. This indicates {{that there is a need}} for advancement of construction e-business practices. Hence, for construction organisations currently using e-business tools and for those who have yet to utilize and seek to adopt e-business tools, there is a need to undertake an analysis of their business processes and working methods to ensure a productive and beneficial implementation of these tools. This necessitates undertaking an analysis of current construction <b>e-business</b> <b>processes</b> to ensure productive implementation in order to develop their e-business capabilities and levels of maturity. This paper acknowledges the niche for research into e-business capability and maturity of <b>e-business</b> <b>processes</b> and presents a protocol for categorizing the construction processes for the development of a construction e-business capability maturity model. Process classification methodology comprised of two stages; initially an archival analysis to identify and categorise construction processes followed by expert interviews to review and refine the categorisation.
