5|$|Alveoli {{consist of}} {{two types of}} {{alveolar}} cell and an alveolar macrophage. The two types of cell are known as type I and type II alveolar cells (also known as pneumocytes). Types I and II make up the walls and alveolar septa. Type I cells provide 95% of the surface area of each alveoli and are flat ("squamous"), and Type II cells generally cluster <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> the alveoli and have a cuboidal shape. Despite this, cells occur in a roughly equal ratio of 1:1 or 6:4.|$|E
5|$|As of 2008, Arsenal's {{season ticket}} waiting list stood at 40,000 people. The {{potential}} for expanding the stadium {{is a common}} topic within fan debate. Potential expansion methods include, make seats smaller, filling in the dips <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> the stadium though this would block airflow, and replacing the roof with a third level and building a new roof. There has also been discussion on the implementation of safe standing.|$|E

5|$|The upper tier is {{contoured}} {{to leave}} open space <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> the ground, and {{the roof is}} significantly canted inwards. Both of these features are meant to provide as much airflow and sunlight to the pitch as possible. The stadium gives an illusion that supporters in the upper tier {{on one side of}} the ground are unable to see supporters in the upper tier opposite. As part of a deal with Sony, the stadium was the first in the world to incorporate HDTV streaming. In the north-west and south-east corners of the stadium are two giant screens suspended from the roof.|$|E
5|$|The cross-in-square plan, with {{a single}} dome at the {{crossing}} or five domes in a quincunx pattern, became widely popular in the Middle Byzantine period. Examples include an early 9th century church in Tirilye, now called the Fatih Mosque, and the palace chapel of the Myrelaion, built around 920. The Nea Ekklesia of Emperor Basil I was built in Constantinople around 880 {{as part of a}} substantial building renovation and construction program during his reign. It had five domes, which are known from literary sources, but different arrangements for them have been proposed under at least four different plans. One has the domes arranged in a cruciform pattern like those of the contemporaneous Church of St. Andrew at Peristerai or the much older Church of the Holy Apostles in Constantinople. Others arrange them in a quincunx pattern, with four minor domes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> a square and a larger fifth in the center, as part of a cross-domed or cross-in-square plan. It is often suggested that the five-domed design of St. Panteleimon at Nerezi, from 1164, is based on that of the Nea Ekklesia.|$|E

25|$|Due to {{the effects}} of viscosity, the {{cross-section}} of a wind tunnel is typically circular rather than square, because there will be greater flow constriction <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> a square tunnel that can make the flow turbulent.

25|$|Deriving {{the volume}} of a bicylinder (white) {{can be done by}} packing it in a cube (red). A plane (parallel with the cylinders' axes) {{intersecting}} the bicylinder forms a square and its intersection with the cube is a larger square. The difference between the areas of the two squares is the same as 4 small squares (blue). As the plane moves through the solids, these blue squares describe square pyramids with isosceles faces <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> the cube; the pyramids have their apexes at the midpoints of the four cube edges. Moving the plane through the whole bicylinder describes a total of 8 pyramids.|$|E

25|$|One of the {{earliest}} digs by Israeli archaeologists, Beit Alfa {{is the site of}} an ancient Byzantine-era synagogue, constructed in the 5th century CE, with a three-paneled mosaic floor. An Aramaic inscription states that the mosaic was made at the time of Justin (apparently Justin I), who ruled from 518 to 527 CE. The mosaic {{is one of the most}} important discovered in Israel. Each of its three panels depicts a scene—the Holy Ark, the zodiac, and the story of the sacrifice of Isaac. The zodiac has the names of the twelve signs in Hebrew. In the center is Helios, the sun god, being whisked away in his chariot by four galloping horses. The four women <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> the mosaic represent the four seasons.|$|E
25|$|The cabin {{consists}} of 5 and half rooms, of logs with plank and slab construction.

There was a fireplace on the east end of the structure. The logs were hewn on three sides, leaving the bark on the fourth side to serve as exterior facing, as well as their corners having a double saddle notch <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> the building. The logs were procured from the Isaacson Saw Mill, which was located not far away on Benny Creek.|$|E
25|$|Without any {{permanent}} address, {{the family}} had to spend irregular vagrancy life living <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> their relatives manors {{in various parts of}} Sweden. This was in Margit Sandemo's opinion somewhat humiliating. During her time in Sweden, she missed her birthplace in Valdres, Norway, which she still considered her true national place. Also her mother's occupation as a teacher may {{have been one of the}} reasons for moving so often. Margit took her compulsory education in a nine-year girl school, after which she studied in various night schools, as in an art school and was as an auditor in Dramaten. She got good grades, the best for behaviour, even though she took never schooling seriously. Sandemo had a gift for arts as a child. She was skilled at painting, singing, playing and poetry, making her mother very proud. However, she did not have any dreams to become a novelist. Margit spent her childhood summer at the estate of her grandparents in Blekinge.|$|E

25|$|In the Dutch armed forces, the Colour is orange (except for {{the colour}} of the midshipsmans' corps, which is red). On the obverse is the royal cypher of the monarch {{that gave the}} {{regiment}} its (original) colour, with the unit's name underneath, both in gold; around the four edges is a laurel branch. On the reverse is {{the arms of the}} Kingdom of the Netherlands without the mantle. The shield is blue and is strewn with small upright rectangles; the main device is a crowned rampant lion, holding a sword in its upper paw. The lion and rectangles are gold, whilst the blade of the sword is silver. Supporting the shield on either side is a gold rampant lion, facing outwards towards the viewer. There is a gold crown above the shield; whilst below it is a blue scroll with the motto Je Maintiendrai in gold. The shield and lions are surrounded by a wreath of green palm and oak leaves, and there is another wavy gold laurel wreath around the edge. Battle honours are added <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> the obverse; if additional honours are awarded, they are placed on streamers that are attached to the pike until the presentation of a new Colour. The Military Order of William or other decorations are attached to the pike when awarded. The pike has a finial of a lion on a block holding a sword and a bunch of seven arrows. Traditionally a colour is 87cm x 87cm (with a pike of 2.50 m in length), but armoured infantry regiments carry colours that measure 60cm x 60cm (with a pike of 2.20 m in length). Guards regiments carry the same colour, with some differing details.|$|E
