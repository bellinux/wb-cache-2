Both the opening and closing ceremonies took place at Cardiff Arms Park, plus all the track and field events, on what had been the greyhound track. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>turn</b> <b>out</b> to be the last time that South Africa would participate in the Games until 1994.

The group wanted to use the rice to seed Mars and make a fortune.

5|$|The Senators would {{defeat the}} {{eventual}} Stanley Cup champion Canadiens 5–3 that night, but <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>turn</b> <b>out</b> {{to be their}} only highlight of the season for the Senators. The club would tie with the San Jose Sharks for the worst record in the League that year, winning just ten games with 70 losses and four ties (24 points) in the 1992–93 season. The Senators still hold the NHL record for least road wins for their record that season, with one. Their points total for the season was one point better than the NHL record for least points in a season ever. The Senators had aimed low. Firestone had set beating the old record the Senators' goal for the season, as the team planned to finish low in the standings for its first few years {{in order to receive}} high draft picks.|$|E

25|$|Among the {{individuals}} who had briefly abandoned Jamestown was John Rolfe, a Sea Venture survivor who had lost {{his wife and son}} in Bermuda. He was a businessman from London who had some untried seeds for new, sweeter strains of tobacco with him, as well as some untried marketing ideas. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>turn</b> <b>out</b> that John Rolfe held the key to the Colony's economic success. By 1612, Rolfe's new strains of tobacco had been successfully cultivated and exported, establishing a first cash crop for export. Plantations and new outposts sprung up, initially both upriver and downriver along the navigable portion of the James, and thereafter along the other rivers and waterways of the area.

25|$|After {{missing the}} playoffs in 2006, Brett Favre {{announced}} that he would return for the 2007 season; <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>turn</b> <b>out</b> to be one of his best. The Packers won 10 of their first 11 games and finished 13–3, earning a first round bye in the playoffs. The Packers' passing offense, led by Favre and a very skilled wide receiver group, finished second in the NFC, behind the Dallas Cowboys, and third overall in the league. Running back Ryan Grant, acquired for a sixth-round draft pick from the New York Giants, became the featured back in Green Bay and rushed for 956 yards and 8 touchdowns in the final 10 games of the regular season. In the divisional playoff round, in a heavy snowstorm, the Packers beat the Seattle Seahawks 42–20. Grant rushed for three touchdowns and over 200 yards, while Favre tossed three touchdown passes and 1 snowball to receiver Donald Driver in celebration.|$|E
25|$|The Founders {{initiate}} {{a campaign of}} sabotage and terror against the Alpha Quadrant, which leaves many governments fearful of infiltrators, {{who are able to}} assume any physical form. When Earth is attacked, a band of Starfleet officers illegally attempt to impose martial law {{at the heart of the}} Federation. The Klingon Empire invades Cardassia on the incorrect assumption that the Dominion is influencing its government. Later, the Federation suspects the Klingon Chancellor, Gowron, of being a shapeshifter. This turned out to be a ploy by the Dominion so that the Federation would assassinate Gowron and further intensify the rift between the Federation and Klingons due to the Klingon invasion of Cardassia. During the assassination attempt, the Federation realized that Klingon General Martok was the actual shapeshifter. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>turn</b> <b>out</b> that Martok, Dr. Julian Bashir and others have been held captive at a prison camp in the Gamma Quadrant while shapeshifters took their place in the Alpha Quadrant. Shortly before their escape, the Dominion succeeds in urging the Cardassians to enter an alliance during the confusion, establishing its presence in the Alpha Quadrant. Realizing the danger, the Federation and Klingons join forces to slow the Dominion build-up, co-operating to plant a minefield across the entrance to the Bajoran Wormhole as a rescued Martok is assigned as a permanent Klingon commander at Deep Space Nine.|$|E

25|$|Reverend Charles Helm (1844 - 1915), son of Reverend Daniel Helm of the London Missionary Society, {{was born}} in the Cape Colony, joined the London Missionary Society himself, and moved from the Zuurbraak (now Suurbraak) mission station just east of Swellendam (modern Western Cape Province, South Africa) to the Hope Fountain Mission in Matabeleland, Southern Rhodesia, {{travelling}} from October 1874 to December 1875, then bringing two ridged dog bitches from somewhere between Kimberley (modern Northern Cape Province, South Africa) and Swellendam with him to Hope Fountain in 1879 en route to becoming, as <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>turn</b> <b>out,</b> a political advisor to King Lobengula, house-host to hunter-explorer Frederick Courteney Selous, postmaster of Bulawayo and well-appreciated tooth-extractor. At Hope Fountain, now part of the city of Bulawayo, fellow South African transplant Cornelis van Rooyen (b. 1860, Uitenhage, modern Eastern Cape Province, South Africa), a biggame hunter, was married to Maria Vermaak of Bloemhof by Reverend Helm in 1879 the same year Helm brought his two rough-coated grey-black bitches to the Mission. Van Rooyen saw Helm's pair of bitches and decided to breed his own dogs with them to incorporate their guarding abilities. It is not known if these two first direct ancestors of Rhodesian ridgebacks had dorsal hair pattern ridges themselves, but they founded the Rhodesian ridgeback bloodline, so either carried the trait or it was added from other Boer dogs and hybrids with Khoikhoi ridgebacks which van Rooyen bred into his lines over many trials then generations.|$|E

500|$|Even if the Nazko swarm were {{a warning}} of a {{volcanic}} eruption, Hickson doubted <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>turn</b> <b>out</b> to {{be a highly}} explosive eruption like those that can occur in subduction-zone volcanoes. [...] "We're not talking about an injection of tonnes of ash many kilometers into the air like the 1980 Mount St. Helens eruption or the 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption. We're talking about something very small, relatively localized that should have a fairly limited impact... but it'll be extremely exciting", Hickson said. If an eruption were to occur, Hickson suggested {{that it would be}} characterized by a lava fountain that sends globs of lava [...] into the air. This is similar to those that occur in Hawaii. Hickson said that a Nazko eruption could be a tourist attraction, but warned that noxious gases such as carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide would be released during the event.|$|E

50|$|Unfortunately {{for that}} plan, the {{championship}} game was never held. Disputes arose between the National League and the American Association during the winter about the redistribution of players following {{the dissolution of the}} Players' League. The Association ended its relationship with the League before the spring of 1891, so the anticipated championship game was canceled, and no World Series was held in 1891. The 1891 pennant winners would be the Boston Beaneaters of the NL and the Boston Reds of the AA, who had joined the Association from the Players' League. This <b>would</b> <b>turn</b> <b>out</b> to be the only time two Boston clubs would win their respective league championships. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> also <b>turn</b> <b>out</b> to be the second (and last) time that a club won pennants in consecutive years in different leagues.|$|R

After the first few rushes {{it was obvious that}} <b>it</b> film <b>would</b> <b>turn</b> <b>out</b> badly. Yet they went right on. Perhaps they couldn't convince themselves that all that money would end in disaster. I really did want to be as beautiful as they wanted. It was terribly difficult. Then I worked very hard to dub the dialogue but they kept changing lines to things I couldn't pronounce. So they had to dub in another voice.MGM were impressed by the performance of Boehm and signed him to a contract, putting him in such films as Come Fly with Me and The Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm.|$|R
500|$|The {{hospital}} corpsman and sniper of a four-man reconnaissance {{and surveillance}} team, SEAL Team 10. Wahlberg {{was the first}} actor to sign on as a star of the film during its early stages of development. He agreed to portray Luttrell after reading Peter Berg's script. Wahlberg chose not to read Luttrell's book Lone Survivor during production to avoid arguments with Berg over events and details that were {{left out in the}} book. [...] "The problem when adapting a piece of material like that is that you always feel like something is missing", he explained. [...] "I wanted to come at it from this perspective." [...] Of Wahlberg's portrayal, Luttrell stated, [...] "Wahlberg is a consummate professional, and he's a great actor. It was a little strange watching somebody trying to play me, but we talked about it and I knew <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>turn</b> <b>out</b> great. I was more worried about the other guys because they’re not around to speak for themselves." [...] Wahlberg has since cited Lone Survivor as his favorite film role as an actor and producer: [...] "This is the best working experience I’ve ever had, under the toughest conditions. I remember early on as an actor, you worked a long, hard day, but you did something you felt was special, and that car ride home you couldn’t stop thinking about it. I had that feeling every day on this movie." ...|$|E
500|$|RKO {{appeared}} {{in good shape}} to build on its recent successes, but the year brought a number of unpleasant harbingers for all of Hollywood. The British government imposed a 75% tax on films produced abroad; along with similarly confiscatory taxes and quota laws enacted by other countries, {{this led to a}} sharp decline in foreign revenues. The postwar attendance boom peaked sooner than expected and television emerged as a competitor for audience interest. Across the board, profits fell—a 27% drop for the Hollywood studios from 1946 to 1947. The phenomenon that would become known as McCarthyism was building strength, and in October, the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) began hearings into Communism in the motion picture industry. Two of RKO's top talents, Dmytryk and producer Adrian Scott, refused to cooperate. As a consequence, they were fired by RKO per the terms of the Waldorf Statement, the major studios' pledge to [...] "eliminate any subversives". Scott, Dmytryk, and eight others who also defied HUAC—dubbed the Hollywood Ten—were blacklisted across the industry. Ironically, the studio's major success of the year was Crossfire, a Scott–Dmytryk film. Odlum concluded it was time to exit the film business, and he put his remaining RKO shares—approximately 25% of the outstanding stock—on the market. Before the turn of the year, the Pathé-branded newsreel was sold to Warner Bros. For her performance in The Farmer's Daughter (1947), a coproduction with Selznick's Vanguard Films, Loretta Young won the Best Actress Oscar the following March. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>turn</b> <b>out</b> to be the last major Academy Award for an RKO picture.|$|E
500|$|On draft day, Phillips {{made good}} on his promise not to draft Taylor and the Saints instead {{selected}} Heisman Trophy-winning halfback George Rogers with the first pick, leaving the Giants with the decision of whether to select Taylor. To the raucous approval of the crowd in attendance at the draft (which was held in New York City), the Giants selected him. Privately, Taylor was hesitant about playing for New York as {{he had hoped to}} be drafted by the Dallas Cowboys, and was unimpressed with a tour of Giants Stadium he was taken on, after the draft. Publicly, however, he expressed excitement about the opportunity to play in the city. Taylor changed his stance after he was drafted as Harry Carson made a point to reach out to him, and Taylor said he [...] "talked to some players and coaches" [...] and [...] "got things straightened out." [...] One of the factors that the Giants said they considered in selecting Taylor was his solid reputation. [...] "He was the cleanest player in the draft. By that I mean there was no rap on him", said head coach Ray Perkins. [...] "Great potential as a linebacker, a fine young man, free of injuries." [...] Taylor chose to wear number 56 because he was a fan of Cowboys linebacker Thomas Henderson. As <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>turn</b> <b>out,</b> Taylor would have the longer and more successful career while Rogers, although successful in his own right with several 1,000-yard rushing seasons and two Pro Bowl selections, was injury-prone and forced to retire following the 1987 season with the Washington Redskins.|$|E
50|$|In {{their second}} season, the Pirates missed the playoffs after {{finishing}} in fourth place. The Pirates' third season saw the team post a 19-17-8 record and earn a playoff spot. This playoff series {{would be based}} on a two-game total goal series format. In the playoffs, the Pirates were defeated by the New York Rangers, 6-4. The Pirates were defeated in Game 1, 4-0 and their 4-2 win in Game 2 could not overcome New York's lead in goals. This marked the second time the team lost in the first round to the eventual Stanley Cup winner. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> also <b>turn</b> <b>out</b> to be the last playoff game that the Pirates would play.|$|R

Barrichello gained {{the most in the}} pits, as he moved up from eighth to fourth place; Alonso continued his hard charge, gaining four positions as well. However, Trulli's Toyota slowly began dropping back, getting passed again and again; <b>it</b> <b>would</b> later <b>turn</b> <b>out</b> to be a blistered rear tyre, which would affect him {{for the remainder of the}} race. Teammate Ralf Schumacher had a problem of his own, and was forced to pit twice in quick succession to tighten a loose safety harness.

In 1996–97, former Oilers teammate Wayne Gretzky joined the Rangers, while Messier retained the captaincy and had a respectable 84-point regular season. The two led the team to the Eastern Conference Finals, where they were eliminated by the Philadelphia Flyers in five games, as the Rangers could not match the size and strength of Eric Lindros and his [...] "Legion of Doom" [...] linemates. Messier left the club {{at the conclusion of the}} season (see below), ending the brief reunion of Messier and Gretzky being together again on the same team after just one season. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> also <b>turn</b> <b>out</b> to be both players' final playoff appearances.|$|R
