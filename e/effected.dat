50|$|Toxicity can {{be broken}} down into two broad {{categories}} of direct and indirect toxicity. Direct toxicity results from a toxicant acting at the site of action in or on the organism. Indirect toxicity occurs with a change in the physical, chemical, or biological environment. Lethality is most common <b>effect</b> used in toxicology and used as an endpoint for acute toxicity tests. While conducting chronic toxicity tests sublethal <b>effects</b> are endpoints that are looked at. These endpoints include behavioral, physiological, biochemical, histological changes. There are a number of <b>effects</b> that occur when an organism is simultaneously exposed to two or more toxicants. These <b>effects</b> include additive <b>effects,</b> synergistic <b>effects,</b> potentiation <b>effects,</b> and antagonistic <b>effects.</b> An additive <b>effect</b> occurs when combined <b>effect</b> is equal to a combination or sum of the individual <b>effects.</b> A synergistic <b>effect</b> occurs when the combination of <b>effects</b> is much greater than the two individual <b>effects</b> added together. Potentiation is an <b>effect</b> that occurs when an individual chemical has no <b>effect</b> is added to a toxicant and the combination has a greater <b>effect</b> than just the toxicant alone. Finally, an antagonistic <b>effect</b> occurs when a combination of chemicals has less of an <b>effect</b> than the sum of their individual <b>effects.</b>|$|R
