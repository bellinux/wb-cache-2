5|$|The U.S. {{government}} had been <b>highly</b> <b>critical</b> <b>of</b> Canadian involvement in Sudan oil development and in February 2000 the U.S. Treasury announced that American persons {{were forbidden to}} do business with the Greater Nile Petroleum Operating Company (GNPOC) and Sudapet.|$|E
5|$|After the Second World Congress in 1948, the International Secretariat {{attempted}} to open communications with Josip Broz Tito's regime in Yugoslavia. In their analysis, it {{differed from the}} rest of the Eastern Bloc because it was established by the partisans of World War II who had fought against Nazi occupation, as opposed to by Stalin's invading armies. The British RCP, led by Jock Haston and supported by Ted Grant, were <b>highly</b> <b>critical</b> <b>of</b> this move.|$|E

5|$|On 13 April 1968, {{in another}} one of his {{frequent}} cabinet reshuffles, Bokassa demoted Banza to minister of health, but let him remain in his position as minister of state. Cognizant of the president's intentions, Banza increased his vocalization of dissenting political views. A year later, after Banza {{made a number of}} remarks <b>highly</b> <b>critical</b> <b>of</b> Bokassa and his management of the economy, the president, perceiving an immediate threat to his power, removed him as his minister of state.|$|E
5|$|After the conflict, the Pakistani {{government}} {{decided on a}} policy of silence regarding the rapes. They set up the Hamoodur Rahman Commission, a judicial commission to prepare {{an account of the}} circumstances surrounding the atrocities of the 1971 war and Pakistan's surrender. The commission was <b>highly</b> <b>critical</b> <b>of</b> the army. The chiefs of staff of the army and the Pakistan Air Force were removed from their positions for attempting to interfere with the commission. The Commission based its reports on interviews with politicians, officers and senior commanders. The final reports were submitted in July 1972, but all were subsequently destroyed except for one held by Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the Pakistani president. The findings were never made public.|$|E
5|$|Beebe {{described}} his religious beliefs {{as a combination}} of Presbyterianism and Buddhism. His religion was largely the result of seeking to combine his sense of awe and wonder at the natural world with a scientific understanding of its workings. He was <b>highly</b> <b>critical</b> <b>of</b> efforts to use science to justify political ideologies, such as socialism or the belief that women were inferior to men. Beebe also disapproved of the eugenic ideas advocated by many biologists in the early 20th century, including some of his contemporaries at the zoo, although this was largely {{out of fear that}} these ideas would alienate friends of the zoo and cause divisions among its staff.|$|E

5|$|Bolivia's U.S. embassy {{had become}} {{publicly}} <b>highly</b> <b>critical</b> <b>of</b> Morales; {{just prior to}} the election, the U.S. ambassador to Bolivia Manuel Rocha issued a statement declaring that U.S. aid to Bolivia would be cut if MAS won the election. However, exit polls revealed that Rocha's comments had served to increase support for Morales. Following the election, the U.S. embassy maintained this critical stance, characterising Morales as a criminal and encouraging Bolivia's traditional parties to sign a broad agreement to oppose the MAS; Morales himself began alleging that the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency was plotting to assassinate him.|$|E
5|$|Boyle {{sponsored}} a motion of non-confidence against the government. Despite enjoying {{the support of}} twelve Liberals, including Cushing, the motion was defeated and the government upheld. Rutherford attempted to quell the controversy by calling a royal commission, but pressure from many Liberals, including Bulyea, led him to resign May 26, 1910; he was replaced by Arthur Sifton, hitherto the province's chief judge. In November, the royal commission issued its report. It found that the evidence did not show {{a conflict of interest}} on Rutherford's part, but the majority report was nevertheless <b>highly</b> <b>critical</b> <b>of</b> the former Premier. A minority report was much kinder, avowing perfect satisfaction with Rutherford's version of events.|$|E
5|$|Dickens {{returned}} to the tale several times during his life to amend the phrasing and punctuation. He capitalised {{on the success of}} the book by publishing other Christmas stories The Chimes (1844), The Cricket on the Hearth (1845), The Battle of Life (1846) and The Haunted Man and the Ghost's Bargain (1848); these were secular conversion tales which reflected the societal changes of the previous year, and which social problems still needed to be dealt with. While the public eagerly bought the later books, the reviewers were <b>highly</b> <b>critical</b> <b>of</b> the stories.|$|E
50|$|In 1846, he {{attracted}} {{attention by}} publishing <b>highly</b> <b>critical</b> articles <b>of</b> {{the government in}} Lajos Kossuth's paper, the Pesti Hírlap. He was elected {{as one of the}} Radical candidates to the Diet of 1848.|$|R

25|$|McKay's niece, Fawn McKay Brodie, was {{the author}} of the {{controversial}} book No Man Knows My History, a <b>highly</b> <b>critical</b> biography <b>of</b> Joseph Smith, the publication of which led to her eventual excommunication from the LDS Church.|$|R
5|$|Flying Blind, Flying Safe is a non-fiction {{book about}} the American airline {{industry}} and Federal Aviation Administration, written by Mary Schiavo with Sabra Chartrand. The book {{was first published in}} March 1997 in hardcover format by Avon Books. An updated paperback edition was published on April 1, 1998. Schiavo is a former Inspector General of the United States Department of Transportation, and Chartrand a journalist for The New York Times. Schiavo was Inspector General of the United States Department of Transportation for six years, and resigned in 1996 shortly after the ValuJet Flight 592 airline crash in the Florida Everglades. She became a whistleblower and was <b>highly</b> <b>critical</b> <b>of</b> the airline industry and its relationship with aviation safety agencies in the United States federal government.|$|E
5|$|In February 2011, Dunderdale's {{government}} {{rejected a}} report prepared {{by an independent}} committee that called for a massive downsizing of the fishing industry. The report by the Steering Committee for Fishing Industry Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was released by the province, and called for $450 million to be spent to achieve substantial cuts in the industry. At the time Minister Jackman dismissed the report almost immediately, saying the $450 million price tag was too expensive. Opposition parties and union leaders were <b>highly</b> <b>critical</b> <b>of</b> the government for dismissing the report, with NDP leader Lorraine Michael calling for Minister Jackman to resign.|$|E
5|$|In Leiden, the {{congregation}} gained {{the freedom to}} worship as they chose, but Dutch society was unfamiliar to them. Scrooby had been an agricultural community, whereas Leiden was a thriving industrial center, and the Separatists found the pace of life difficult. The community remained close-knit, but their children began adopting the Dutch language and customs, and some also entered the Dutch Army. The Puritans also were still not free from the persecutions of the English Crown. English authorities came to Leiden to arrest William Brewster in 1618, after he published comments <b>highly</b> <b>critical</b> <b>of</b> the King of England and the Anglican Church. Brewster escaped arrest, but the events spurred {{the congregation}} to move farther from England.|$|E

5|$|International {{attitudes to}} the {{federation}} were critical, {{particularly from the}} Afro-Asian bloc in the United Nations. At {{a time when most}} colonial powers were rushing their colonies towards independence, the federation seemed to its opponents to be an unwelcome obstacle. In Britain, Labour grew more critical, and African nationalists in the federation itself became more vocal, dissatisfied with the liberalisation that was taking place, and demanding faster moves towards African advancement. The Governor of Northern Rhodesia, Sir Arthur Benson, wrote a secret letter to his superiors in Britain, <b>highly</b> <b>critical</b> <b>of</b> Welensky and the federation; this letter remained undiscovered until 1958, when Huggins revealed it to Welensky.|$|E
5|$|Schiavo {{resigned}} from her {{position at the}} U.S. Department of Transportation in order {{to blow the whistle}} on what she saw as deficiencies in safety practices by the federal government's oversight of the airline industry. She was publicly critical of high-ranking U.S. aviation officials regarding the ValuJet Flight 592 passenger jet crash in the Florida Everglades which resulted in the deaths of all 110 people aboard. Schiavo appeared on ABC's Nightline program the night after the crash and was <b>highly</b> <b>critical</b> <b>of</b> FAA safety inspections methods. After resigning her position as Inspector General Schiavo taught courses at Ohio State University, and in April 1997 she joined the staff of Ohio State University in the position of Enarson Executive-in-Residence.|$|E
5|$|The work {{is thought}} to have been {{completed}} as part of a set of paintings of Protestant martyrs. It was in the possession of a collector in Streatham, London, by the early 20th century. In December 2005 the portrait was examined by the art dealer Christopher Foley. He saw it as an accurate, though poorly executed, reproduction of a contemporary painting of Jane, had it verified and on that basis negotiated its sale. The work was acquired by the National Portrait Gallery in London for a rumoured £100,000. The historian David Starkey was <b>highly</b> <b>critical</b> <b>of</b> the sale and challenged Foley's identifications.|$|E
50|$|Aside {{from his}} {{academic}} publications, Berezovsky frequently authored articles and gave interviews; these are collected in The Art of the Impossible (3 vols.).

50|$|New York: A Documentary Film devoted {{an hour of}} the eight-part, seventeen-and-a-half-hour {{series to}} the battle between Moses and Jacobs. Although Robert Caro's <b>highly</b> <b>critical</b> {{biography}} <b>of</b> Moses, The Power Broker, gives only passing mention to this event, despite Jacobs's strong influence on Caro.|$|R
5|$|These policy failures, and the {{stalemate}} that ensued after the Soviet intervention, led the Soviet leadership to become <b>highly</b> <b>critical</b> <b>of</b> Karmal's leadership. Under Mikhail Gorbachev, the Soviet Union deposed Karmal and replaced him with Mohammad Najibullah. Following his loss of power, he was again exiled, {{this time to}} Moscow. He was {{allowed to return to}} Afghanistan in 1991 by the Najibullah government. Back in Afghanistan he became an associate of Abdul Rashid Dostum, and helped remove the Najibullah government from power. Not long after, in 1996, Karmal died from liver cancer.|$|E
5|$|De la Ferté was <b>highly</b> <b>critical</b> <b>of</b> the Air Ministry's {{attitude}} to his service. In 1937 several exercises {{were carried out}} by Coastal Command in co-operation with submarines against the Home Fleet to judge the surface fleet's defence against submarine and air attack. However, despite {{the experiences of the}} First World War, no attention was paid to the problem of attacking submarines from the air as part of trade protection measures. Owing to misplaced faith in the imperfect ASDIC invention which was never intended to detect surface-running submarines, it appeared the Royal Navy no longer considered U-boats a threat to Britain's sea lanes. The Air Ministry, keen to concentrate on strategic air forces, did not dispute the Admiralty's conclusions and Coastal Command did not receive any guidance from the Air Ministry. The saving grace for both services was the construction of the Combined Headquarters which enabled rapid collaboration in maritime operations. This {{was one of the few}} successes in organisation and preparation made before the outbreak of war.|$|E
5|$|In his {{newspaper}} Berliner Arbeiterzeitung (Berlin Workers Newspaper), Gregor Strasser was <b>highly</b> <b>critical</b> <b>of</b> Goebbels' failure {{to attract the}} urban vote. However, the party as a whole did much better in rural areas, attracting as much as 18 per cent {{of the vote in}} some regions. This was partly because Hitler had publicly stated just prior to the election that Point 17 of the party programme, which mandated the expropriation of land without compensation, would apply only to Jewish speculators and not private landholders. After the election, the party refocused their efforts to try to attract still more votes in the agricultural sector. In May, shortly after the election, Hitler considered appointing Goebbels as party propaganda chief. But he hesitated, as he worried that the removal of Gregor Strasser from the post would lead to a split in the party. Goebbels considered himself well suited to the position, and began to formulate ideas about how propaganda could be used in schools and the media.|$|E
