50|$|Aside from common {{ball mills}} {{there is a}} second type of ball mill called a {{planetary}} ball mill. Planetary ball mills are smaller than common ball mills and mainly used in laboratories for grinding sample material down to very small sizes. A planetary ball mill consists of at least one grinding jar which is arranged eccentrically on a so-called sun wheel. The direction of movement of the sun wheel is opposite to that of the grinding jars (ratio: 1:-2 or 1:-1 or else).The grinding balls in the grinding jars are subjected to superimposed rotational movements, the so-called Coriolis forces. The difference in speeds between the balls and grinding jars produces an interaction between frictional and impact forces, which releases high dynamic energies. The interplay between these forces produces the high and very effective <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>size</b> <b>reduction</b> of the planetary ball mill.|$|E

30|$|Notably, in {{the current}} study, there was no {{significant}} difference in the reduction of mesiodistal tooth width in the hypodontia group except for maxillary lateral incisors and mandibular first molars in female, whereas other researchers reported a significant difference in mild tooth agenesis patients [17, 22, 34]. This may relate specifically to the fact that our sample population was Japanese, or it may relate to some other difference in sample collection. In the oligodontia group {{in the current}} study, however, as in the study of Gungor and Turkkahraman [22], in both sexes, reduction of mesiodistal tooth width was greater in cases of severe agenesis. Brook et al. [20] further concluded that as the number of CMT increase, the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> tooth <b>size</b> <b>reduction</b> increases. The results of the current study are concordant with this in both sexes, with a higher correlation in male patients, particularly with regard to maxillary teeth. The details of CMT and reduction of mesiodistal tooth width pertaining to sex differences remain unclear at present, and further investigations are necessary in this respect.|$|R
40|$|Currently {{the effect}} of the pre-weakening of ore {{particles}} by high voltage pulses is evaluated by the percentage change of A ∗ b values between pulse-treated and untreated ore particles. The values of A ∗ b, widely used as an ore breakage competence indicator in the mineral industry, are determined from the parameters of the JKMRC breakage models. In this study a t 10 -based method was developed to predict the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>size</b> <b>reduction,</b> t 10, of pulse-treated particles from that of untreated particles broken at the same size/energy level. This method incorporates one parameter, CAb, which is equivalent to the percentage change of A ∗ b values. The t 10 -based method was validated using nine sets of comparative JK Rotary Breakage Tester data on pulse-treated and untreated ore samples over a wide range of impact specific energies and particle sizes. The t 10 -based method can be used to calculate the energy reduction due to the pre-weakening effect in the downstream comminution process. It indicates that the energy reduction by pre-weakening increases with an increase in the target product fineness and the degree of pre-weakening, and with the decrease in feed particle size...|$|E
40|$|The mining {{industry}} {{is searching for}} more energy efficient and dry comminution equipment {{as an alternative to}} conventional crushing followed by wet grinding circuits. This is a result of growing challenges associated with the increasing energy cost, scarcity of water resources and stricter environmental legislation. Dry comminution technologies, such as High Pressure Grinding Rolls (HPGR) and Vertical Roller Mills (VRM), have been successfully used in other industries such as cement and coal for decades, and the literature claims that these technologies are more energy efficient than conventional comminution practices. Pilot scale testing was conducted for each of these technologies using rock with properties similar to many mineral ores to test the claims in the literature and evaluate the applicability for hard rock mining operations. Whilst the test results for the HPGR and VRM are not directly comparable (due to different <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>size</b> <b>reduction),</b> both demonstrated the potential for considerable energy savings compared to conventional ball milling. The HPGR and air classification circuit used 20 - 30 % less energy than the HGPR, screen, ball mill circuit.

40|$|The {{elimination}} of polyneuronal innervation from neonatal rat soleus muscle was studied {{by comparing the}} extent of synapse loss by motor neurones emerging through {{each of the two}} spinal nerves (L 4 and L 5) supplying the muscle. The fraction of muscle fibres receiving innervation from the L 4 spinal nerve declined from an average of 75 % in 6 -day-old animals (when all fibres are polyneuronally innervated) to 18 % in animals older than 16 days (when almost all muscle fibres are singly innervated). By comparison innervation by the L 5 spinal nerve declined from 99 % of the fibres at 6 days to 83 % of the fibres after 16 days. As a result of synapse elimination there is a greater reduction in the innervation of the muscle by the L 4 nerve. The difference in loss of muscle fibres innervated by L 4 vs. L 5 was not, however, due to a greater degree of synapse {{elimination of}} L 4 motor nerve terminals. As shown by measurements of the sizes of motor units, both L 4 and L 5 have units which on average are about four to five times larger at 6 days than at the conclusion of synapse elimination. Thus L 4 and L 5 motor neurones undergo approximately the same <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>size</b> <b>reduction.</b> The apparently disproportionate loss of muscle innervation by the L 4 nerve is {{explained by the fact that}} L 4 usually contains only a small portion of the total of soleus motor neurones.

This approach, while keeping the quality of the approximations, leads to a significant reduction of the number <b>of</b> <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> freedom, with a maximal reduction for the so called repetitive structures.

40|$|Although foregut {{fermentation}} {{is often}} equated with rumination in the literature, functional ruminants (ruminants, camelids) differ fundamentally from non-ruminant foregut fermenters (e. g. macropods, hippos, peccaries). They combine foregut fermentation with a sorting mechanism {{that allows them}} to remasticate large particles and clear their foregut quickly of digested particles; thus, they do not only achieve high <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> particle <b>size</b> <b>reduction</b> but also comparatively high food intakes. Regurgitation and remastication of stomach contents have been described sporadically in several non-ruminant, non-primate herbivores. However, this so-called ‘merycism’ apparently does not occur as consistently as in ruminants. Here, to our knowledge we report, for the first time, regurgitation and remastication in 23 free-ranging individuals of a primate species, the foregut-fermenting proboscis monkey (Nasalis larvatus). In one male that was observed continuously during 169 days, the behaviour was observed on 11 different days occurring mostly in the morning, and was associated with significantly higher proportions of daily feeding time than on days when it was not observed. This observation is consistent with the concept that intensified mastication allows higher food intake without compromising digestive efficiency, and represents an expansion of the known physiological primate repertoire that converges with a strategy usually associated with ruminants only...|$|R

The procedure was repeated twice for different time intervals: 24 and 72 ?h, giving a total of 96 ?h of immersion time. This procedure was used to characterize hydrophobicity and also grafting efficiency. After the immersion, the membranes were rinsed with ethanol two times to remove any unreacted chemicals from the membranes and dried at 70 ?C for 24 ?h.

In {{the present}} study binary Mg-xCa (x= 0. 5 and 1. 25 wt. %) and ternary Mg- 1 Ca-xZn (x= 0. 5 and 1. 5 wt. %) alloys are {{produced}} by casting the molten metal in a metal die at a temperature of 740 °C. The microstructure analysis of the Mg-Ca and Mg-Ca-Zn alloys were studied by OM, SEM and EDX. The corrosion behavior of alloys was evaluated via potentiodynamic polarization test in Kokubo solution. The result exhibited that the grain size decrease with rising Ca content in Mg-Ca alloys and <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> grain <b>size</b> <b>reduction</b> further decreased by adding Zn to Mg- 1 Ca-Zn alloys. The microstructure of Mg-Ca alloys were constituted of primary Mg and lamellar eutectic (α-Mg+Mg 2 Ca) phase, Whilst Mg– 1 Ca-Zn alloys were composed of primary Mg and eutectic (α-Mg+Mg 2 Ca+Ca 2 Mg 6 Zn 3) phases. In addition with increasing Ca and Zn the amount of Mg 2 Ca and Ca 2 Mg 6 Zn 3 increased respectively in grain boundaries. Electrochemical test shows that the addition of Zn leads to improve corrosion resistance of the Mg– 1 Ca-Zn alloys {{as a result of}} the formation of Ca 2 Mg 6 Zn 3 phase, whilst the addition of more than 0. 5 wt % Ca to Mg-Ca alloys result in decrease corrosion resistance due to the formation Mg 2 Ca. 1...|$|R
40|$|Horses {{achieve a}} higher <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> {{particle}} <b>size</b> <b>reduction</b> through ingestive mastication than functional ruminants. We characterized mastication using chew-monitoring halters (RumiWatch) in six domestic horses, cattle, and Bactrian camels each. All animals were offered grass hay {{of the same}} batch for 15 min. In cattle and camels, measurements were continued after eating until rumination was observed. Except for one horse, 96 % of the horses’ ingestive mastication data were identified as “rumination” by the proprietary RumiWatch algorithm, whereas ingestion and rumination by cattle and camels were mostly classified correctly. There were no systematic differences between cattle and camels. In cattle and camels, ingestive mastication was less regular than rumination, indicated by significantly higher standard deviations of chewing peak intervals, peak heights, and peak breadths in intraindividual comparisons. The average standard deviations of these measures were lower in horses than in cattle and camel ingestive mastication, indicating a more consistent chewing pattern in horses. Horse values {{were similar to those}} of rumination mastication, suggesting equally regular chewing motions. Regular, rhythmic chewing represents a common feature of horses and functional ruminants, but the less uniform ingestive mastication in functional ruminants represents a deviating pattern, the adaptive value of which remains unclear. In particular, it does not appear to promote a higher ingestion rate. A potential cause may be the avoidance of high tooth wear rates by delaying a more regular, systematic mastication until ingesta has been softened and the grit has been washed off in the forestomach...|$|R
40|$|The {{delivery}} of water, sediment, and solutes by catchments {{is influenced by}} the distribution of source elevations and their travel distances to the outlet. For example, elevation affects the magnitude and phase of precipitation, as well as the climatic factors that govern rock weathering, which influence the production rate and initial particle <b>size</b> <b>of</b> sediments. Travel distance, in turn, affects the timing of flood peaks at the outlet and the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> sediment <b>size</b> <b>reduction</b> by wear, which affects particle size distributions at the outlet. The distributions of elevation and travel distance have been studied extensively but separately, as the hypsometric curve and width function. Yet a catchment can be considered as a collection of points, each with paired values of elevation and travel distance. For every point, the ratio of elevation to travel distance defines the mean slope for transport of mass to the outlet. Recognizing that mean slope is proportional to the average rate of loss of potential energy by water and sediment during transport to the outlet, we use the joint distribution of elevation and travel distance to define two new metrics for catchment geometry: "source-area power", and the corresponding catchment-wide integral "catchment power". We explore patterns in source-area and catchment power across three study catchments spanning a range of relief and drainage area. We then develop an empirical algorithm for generating synthetic source-area power distributions, which can be parameterized with data from natural catchments. This new way of quantifying the three-dimensional geometry of catchments can be used to explore the effects of topography on the distribution on fluxes of water, sediment, isotopes, and other landscape products passing through catchment outlets, and may provide a fresh perspective on problems of both practical and theoretical interest...|$|R
40|$|The Iberian lynx Lynx pardinus {{is one of}} the world’s most {{endangered}} felids and {{is vulnerable}} to human-induced mortality and habitat loss, which reduce population size and accelerate the loss of genetic variation. Twenty-ﬁve metric traits of Iberian lynx skulls have been measured on 95 skulls collected between 1872 and 2003. The skulls belong to three geographically distinct areas/populations, which have recently diverged from each other as a consequence of increased habitat fragmen- tation: Donana area, Sierra Morena mountains and Montes de Toledo area. The morphometric study was undertaken using univariate, multivariate and admixture analysis approaches, and all three techniques provided evidence for morphometric differentiation, both in skull size and shape, among the three populations for both males and females. Environmental and genetic forces that may have shaped these patterns are discussed. The males {{of the population of the}} Donana area showed a different <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>reduction</b> in <b>size</b> in nine <b>of</b> the skull traits with time, which has been suggested to be partly because of worsened habitat conditions. However, the heterogeneity <b>of</b> the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> mean <b>size</b> <b>reduction</b> and the relatively high <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> reduction of some of the skull traits investigated (44 %), which have altered the original proportions between the skull variables, could also partly be attributed to inbreeding depression in the Donana population. The phenotypic variability of the skull traits showed signiﬁcant increases (two traits) or decreases (nine traits) with time, and this different pattern of change with time has been suggested to be because of a different number of genes controlling the traits with different <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> dominance and epistatic interactions. The increased pheno- typic variability of two of the traits has also been attributed to a possible decreased level of developmental stability, which can be produced by environmental and/or genetic stress.

In order to test whether loss of protein-coding genes has contributed to genome <b>size</b> <b>reduction</b> in birds, we compared the chicken genome and five mammalian genomes. Numbers of members (paralogs) were significantly lower in the chicken gene families than in the corresponding mammalian families. Phylogenetic analyses of chicken, mammal, and fish paralogs supported the hypothesis that chicken-specific loss of paralogs occurred much more frequently than mammal-specific gene duplications. Moreover, the phylogenetic analyses supported the hypothesis that a substantial majority of the paralogs lost in chicken originated from duplications prior {{to the most recent}} common ancestor of tetrapods and bony fishes. In addition to loss of paralogs, numerous gene families present in the mammalian genomes were missing in the chicken genome; over 1, 000 of these families were found in bony fishes, implying presence of the family in the tetrapod ancestor. In the set of families with more members on average in the mammals than in the chicken, immune system function was associated with a greater <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> gene family <b>size</b> <b>reduction</b> in the chicken, consistent with other evidence that immune system gene families have become particularly compact in birds...|$|R
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this {{research}} was to study the mechanism of drug release from solid dispersions of albendazole, giving special emphasis to particle <b>size</b> <b>of</b> the drug in solid dispersions. Solid dispersions were prepared using three different carriers, mixing ratios and methods in an attempt to improve the solubility and dissolution rate of albendazole. The mechanism of enhanced dissolution was investigated by a novel dissolution technique as an adjunct to phase solubility study, wettability test, differential scanning calorimetry, X-ray diffractometry, infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The solubility of albendazole was greater with albendazole-poloxamer 407 system, while polyethylene glycol dispersions showed predominant wettability. Physical mixtures showed enhanced dissolution compared with the pure drug, due to improved wetting and solubilization of drug in the diffusion layer offering carrier-rich microenvironment. Preparation of solid dispersion further improved the dissolution compared to the physical mixture, owing to increased surface area for mass transfer, thermodynamically enhanced dissolution of a higher energy amorphous form from the carrier, in addition to improved wetting and solubilization.

40|$|Although {{camelids}} and taxonomic ruminants share fundamental convergent properties, such as {{microbial fermentation}} and a sorting mechanism in the forestomach with a resulting high <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> digesta particle <b>size</b> <b>reduction,</b> {{there are important}} differences in the capacity to process high amounts of food. We describe qualitative and quantitative characteristics of the gastrointestinal anatomy of alpacas (Vicugna pacos, 44. 4 ± 5. 5 kg body mass), supplemented with some observations in dromedaries (Camelus dromedarius). The long large intestine of alpacas (610 ± 128 cm) corresponds to the adaptation of camelids to arid environments. An important difference to taxonomic ruminants is {{the position of the}} second forestomach compartment (C 2 vs. reticulum), which is not in line of the major forestomach axis in camelids, and the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> the corresponding orifice (C 1 -C 2 vs. Ostium rumino-reticulare), which is distinctively smaller in camelids (alpaca: 3. 2 ± 0. 3 cm width × 4. 2 ± 0. 3 cm height, dromedary: 8. 5 ± 0. 7 cm diameter) as compared to literature data for similar-sized ruminants. The opening between the second and third forestomach compartment (C 2 -C 3 vs. Ostium reticulo-omasale) is of similar magnitude in camelids (alpaca: 2. 2 ± 0. 7 cm diameter, dromedary: 3. 1 ± 0. 5 cm diameter) and ruminants, but is opposite to the C 1 -C 2 opening in camelids in a dorsal position. The generally smaller opening might represent a reason for the generally lower food processing capacity in camelids, and together with the arrangement of the openings might result in conditions during contractions of the C 2 that are more favourable to (a low proportion of) larger particle escape into the C 3. In contrast, the different arrangement of the openings and the larger connection to the preceding chamber might make such an escape of (a low proportion of) large particles from the reticulum to the omasum less likely in ruminants, giving their sorting mechanism a clear-cut anatomical threshold in the Ostium reticulo-omasale...|$|R

Results demonstrate {{the time required}} to perform <b>size</b> <b>reduction</b> on a bale of carpet waste, and the resulting volume reduction achieved therefrom. The reduction in volume is then related to operating cost <b>of</b> the <b>size</b> <b>reduction</b> equipment, to estimate the total cost of reduction. The characteristics of the size-reduced material are presented in a form to suggest alternative uses for the waste materials...|$|R
40|$|Abstract This chapter {{addresses}} the fundamental concepts {{needed to understand}} the impact <b>of</b> <b>size</b> <b>reduction</b> on the electronic structure and optoelectronic properties of semiconductor nanostructures, with emphasis on quantum confinement effects. This effect is explained by two different approaches: the “top-down ” and the “bottom-up”. Subsequently, {{a brief description of}} the optical properties of semi-conductor nanocrystals is presented. This is followed by sections discussing the essential characteristics of nanocrystals consisting of two (or more) different semiconductors joined together by heterointerfaces (i. e., heteronanocrystals). Moreover, the essential differences between the impact <b>of</b> <b>size</b> <b>reduction</b> on semi-conductors in comparison to metals and insulators is discussed. The chapter ends by briefly discussing the potential applications of semiconductor nanoparticles. There is currently a strong drive among scientists to explore the possibilities of making and characterizing materials of ever smaller dimensions. This effort is motivated by two factors. First of all, there is a great fundamental interest in th...|$|R
