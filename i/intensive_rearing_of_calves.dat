Among all respiratory diseases the Bovine Respiratory Disease Complex – BRDC is the most significant. BRDC is manifested with severe inflammation of respiratory tract and lungs. The disease is caused by viruses, bacteria and stress factors. The major etiological agents of this disease are, however, the viruses especially accompanied with stress. Among many viruses the most significant role in BRDC is attributed to herpes virus type- 1 (BHV- 1), parainfluneca- 3 virus (PI- 3), the bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) while less important are bovine adenoviruses and corona viruses. BRDC is common in our cattle industry mostly in <b>intensive</b> <b>rearing</b> <b>of</b> beef cattle.

During the <b>intensive</b> <b>rearing</b> <b>of</b> gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata), opercular deformities are the most commonly observed type of deformation (affecting up to 80 % of the fisheries stock), sometimes showing a severe inward folding of the operculum. They are non-lethal malformations that appear during the larval stage but affect growth rate and morphology, with a significant economic loss as a consequence. In order to exploratory quantify and qualify these deformities, geometric morphometric analyses were performed on the external morphology from larvae with an age ranging from 50 to 69 days post-hatching (DPH), and on the cranial skeleton of 110 DPH old juveniles. The results showed several osteological cranial shifts and a striking left-right independency associated with deoperculation. Even though a significant size difference was observed at 65 DPH between normal and deoperculated specimens, allometries during the examined growth stages still appear to be very similar in normal and deoperculated specimens.

Techniques for manufacturing feeds which comply with these requirements were evolved and are recomended for practical use. The techniques {{that were used}} for artificial reproduction of C. gariepinus larvae are briefly discussed. The larvae were fed on various dietary formulations and their growth responses were monitored {{in order to determine}} their nutritional requirements. A feed was developed which gave superior results to those obtained with natural food organisms. This feed consisted of Torula yeast(69, 8 %), fishmeal(23, 3 %), vitamin supplements(O, 9 %), methionine supplement (150 mg/kg), bactericide and preservatives. The feed particles were coated with a lipid supplement which was added at a ratio of 6 % to the weight of the feed. The optimum particle size (diameter) for C. gariepinus larvae is 2, 2 % of their mean total length.

Relationships between {{the length of the}} fish and maturity were studied by the use of probabilistic maturation reaction norms. The incidence of mature males and the proportion of fish of lower modal group size in autumn were highest in the groups exposed to short days in May, and lowest under continuous light. In contrast with the expectation that high growth rates promote maturation, the future mature male parr were smaller than the immature males {{at the start of the}} experiment, and they also grew more slowly during the subsequent maturation process. Variability in condition factor was low until autumn, when the condition factor of maturing males rose well above that of immature males during autumn as the fish grew from ~ 80 to ~ 95 mm length.

Intensively <b>reared</b> parr <b>of</b> 60 - 90 mm, and possibly also smaller fish, may be particularly sensitive to photoperiod manipulations that may influence the probabilities of fish adopting one of the three life-history alternatives, to enter lower or upper mode or to mature precociously...|$|R
40|$|<b>Intensive</b> <b>rearing</b> <b>of</b> fish {{presents}} {{the challenge of}} minimising production cost without compromising {{the health and well-being}} of the stock. Most farmed fish species, (with the exception of carp) are just a few generations removed from the wild-type and consequently many relatively benign aspects of the aquaculture environment are perceived as stressors by fish. Although the neuroendocrine stress response is a key element of an animals adaptive repertoire, inappropriate activation of the response leads to poor growth, reproductive dysfunction and immunosuppression. One strategy that has been investigated to address this is to selectively breed for reduced stress responsiveness - by reducing the magnitude of response to conditions that elicit a stress response, the longer-term cumulative effects of stress on the performance and well-being of the population will be reduced. The trait associated with stress responsiveness that is most accessible to directed selection is the magnitude of the plasma cortisol response. Cortisol is known to be a causal agent in most of the adverse effects of stress in fish. This presentation will outline the results of a selective breeding programme to ameliorate stress in fish, including the finding that neuroendocrine differences arising from selection for either high or low activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis during stress are accompanied by a bimodality in behavioural characteristics and cognitive attributes. These suggest that the two selected lines exemplify two distinct combinations of physiological and behavioural strategies for dealing with stressful circumstances akin to the proactive and reactive coping strategies observed in mammals...|$|R

The production system under study considered the Best Available Techniques (BATs) for <b>intensive</b> <b>rearing</b> <b>of</b> pigs. According to the results and in line with other studies, S 1 was the most influential subsystem in the environmental profile (ranging from 70 % to 100 % depending on the impact) mainly due to agricultural activities involved in the production of feed components. Activities carried out on the pig farms (S 2) were remarkable in categories such as climate change due to background processes involved in the production of electricity requirements, e. g. emissions derived from slurry management (such as CH 4 and N 2 O), and water depletion. Slaughtering-related contributions were negligible regardless of the category assessed. Different alternatives for the valorisation of animal by-products derived from the slaughterhouse were proposed for energy and feed production.

The best FCR values (1. 27 +- 0. 35) were reached also in the group of fish kept at 15 °C. For burbot kept at a water temperature of 21 °C, the FCR value was 2. 78 +- 1. 17. Based on our results we can conclude that the most appropriate water temperature for rearing juvenile burbot was 15 °C...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare restricted suckling of tropical cows by their own or another cow 2 ̆ 7 s calf with artificial <b>rearing</b> <b>of</b> the <b>calves</b> and no suckling. In Exp. 1, cows were mechanically milked twice daily, after which for 15 min they were either suckled by their own calf (Treatment O) or multiple-suckled by other cows 2 ̆ 7 calves (Treatment M) or unsuckled, with the calves reared artificially (Treatment A). Machine milk yield was similar for the three treatments, but in the two suckling treatments the additional milk consumed by the calf increased (P = 0. 0 total production (2, 682, 2, 634, and 2, 336 kg/lactation for Treatments 0, M, and A, respectively). Machine milk fat concentration was reduced (P = 0. 05) by suckling (2. 90, 3. 07, and 3. 20...|$|R
40|$|The EU Nitrates Directive (Council Directive 91 / 676 /EEC) {{forms an}} {{integrate}} {{part of the}} Water Framework Directive {{and is one of}} the key instruments in the protection of waters against agricultural pressures [6]. The Nitrates Directive aims to protect water quality across Europe by reducing water pollution caused or induced by nitrates from agricultural sources and by promoting the use of good agricultural practices. Implementation of this directive has proved to be a major challenge for Member States, demanding vast technical resources for the characterization and risk assessments and for developing and operating the associated monitoring programmes, in order to quantify the efficiency of the implemented measures. The 2010 EC's report on the implementation of the Nitrates Directive shows that the pressure from agriculture with respect to surface and groundwater nitrate pollution has decreased in many Member States, although still, agriculture contributes largely to nitrogen loads to surface and ground waters [7]. However, despite these encouraging trends, the report reveals a number of regions where nitrate levels, according to monitoring data, are worrying; one among them is also the southern part of Romania. Although major pollutant sources such as large <b>intensive</b> <b>rearing</b> <b>of</b> poultry and pig farms ceased or conformed to the IPPC directive, achievement of the Nitrates directive goals is still far away from realization due to livestock husbandry farms bad waste management and due to the lack of waste water treatment stations in rural settlements. Accomplishment of the nitrates directive demands has to be realized, in the case of Romania, by a concertated array of measures aimed at reducing pollution both at major and less important sources [9], [10]...|$|R
