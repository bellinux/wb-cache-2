5|$|When the Prussians broke camp, {{they left}} {{a handful of}} light troops to {{demonstrate}} before the French advance post commanded by the Comte de Saint Germain. These light troops constituted the flank guard on the Schartau hill, which lay {{at right angles to}} the Janus and Pölzen. Frederick had no intention of either forming a line parallel to the enemy or of retreating. His army could move as a unit twice as fast as the Allies' army. <b>If,</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> moment of contact, the Allies had already formed their line of battle facing north, then his attack would strike their right flank; if they were still on the move in columns eastwards or northeastwards, the heads of their columns would be crushed before the rest could deploy in the new direction, deployment being a lengthy affair for most armies.|$|E

40|$|The {{changes in}} cytokeratin intermedial {{filaments}} (IFs) after cytochalasin B (CB) infusion of rat liver in vivo were studied by light and electron microscopy, immunofluorescent staining (IMF), and immunoelectron microscopy (IEM). The CB treatment caused {{a change in}} <b>the</b> <b>IFs</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> cell border associated with {{a change in the}} distribution of microfilaments. <b>The</b> <b>IFs</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> cell border were partially disrupted. Actin aggregates were localized <b>at</b> points where <b>IFs</b> had condensed together. The pericanalicular sheath was intact but very dilated. These results indicated that the CB treatment caused an irregular distribution of <b>the</b> microfilaments <b>at</b> <b>the</b> cell periphery but spared <b>the</b> actin <b>at</b> <b>the</b> bile canaliculus. Cytokeratin staining by IMF was markedly decreased or absent; however, IEM clearly showed the presence of nonstaining IFs after CB treatment. These results indicated that the antigenic determinant of normal cytokeratin IFs became masked after CB treatment. The results indicate that F-actin disassembly induced by CB affects both the organization and conformation of cytokeratins associated with loss of integrity of the plasma membrane and vesicular uptake of plasma proteins by hepatocytes...|$|R
