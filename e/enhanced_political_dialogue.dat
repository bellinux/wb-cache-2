30|$|By {{recognizing}} {{the climate change}} challenges as a foreign policy concern, the EU came to the realization then that it would effectively advance its climate change policy agendas on a global level if it engaged Africa as a strategic partner via <b>enhanced</b> <b>political</b> <b>dialogue.</b> This {{is in contrast to}} the uncooperative stance that the United States government has taken against the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol. This realization resulted in an enhanced Africa-EU Partnership on climate change, drafted into the 2007 joint-Africa-EU Strategy (JAES) document. Thus, this would be the instrument that both continents would use in their cooperation to tackle their energy security challenges and environmental concerns, among which the climate change is of the highest priority. The Africa-EU Strategic Partnership and a Joint Africa-EU Strategy document came about as a reaction to what Europe and Africa perceived to be a solution for the new threats and issues that required joint responses and coordinated efforts based on common vision and shared interests.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the relations between}} Turkey and the European Union in the period from 2010 to 2015. It argues that the economic difficulties caused by the 2010 Eurozone crisis has made the European Union to have less credibility and influence in furthering reform efforts of acceding countries, {{especially in the case}} of Turkey. This argument is based on an examination of Turkey’s political, economic, and social developments during the specified period as well as responses coming from the European Commission. Upon the examination of these dimensions, it becomes clear that Turkey has pursued its own agenda and the influence of the European Union has become minimal compared to the period from 1999 until 2010 where the accession process had significantly transformed Turkey’s democracy. This thesis also shows the divergence of Turkey’s foreign policy where it is no longer dependent on European countries but also has begun to increase its economic and diplomatic relations with other regions. Through showing how economic and technical assistance coming from the European Union has been significantly decreased since 2010, this research highlights the importance of economic assistance and aids in supporting reform efforts in acceding countries.

40|$|Gridlock in the {{multilateral}} climate negotiations has created growing scholarly and practical {{interest in the}} use of minilateral forums. A large variety of climate club proposals have been developed in recent years, which promise more effective bargaining among the main climate powers, better incentives to encourage mitigation efforts and discourage free-riding, and new ways to align international power asymmetries with the interests of the global climate regime. I investigate the three dominant rationales that underpin minilateralist proposals. I offer a critical review of their potential as well as their limitations in promoting global climate action. I argue that minilateralism is unlikely to overcome the structural barriers to a comprehensive and ambitious international climate agreement. However, climate clubs can <b>enhance</b> <b>political</b> <b>dialogue</b> in the context of multilateral negotiations and can provide a more conducive environment for great power bargaining. They can create club benefits that strengthen mitigation strategies and help reduce the dangers of free-riding for so-called coalitions of the willing. And they can help re-legitimate the global climate regime against the background of profound power shifts that have slowed down progress in {{the multilateral}} negotiations...|$|R
5000|$|In a June 2012 study, {{researchers}} at the Overseas Development Institute highlighted {{the need for more}} focus on disaster risk management (DRM) in the international policy frameworks to be agreed in 2015. Economic costs of disasters are on the rise, but most humanitarian investment is currently spent on responding to disasters, rather than managing their future risks. If this pattern continues, the researchers argue, then [...] "spending on reconstruction and relief will become unsustainable." [...] A more developed evidence base, <b>enhanced</b> <b>political</b> commitment, and <b>dialogue</b> across policy areas will be needed for this mainstreaming of disaster risk management to happen.|$|R
5000|$|Bernardino León was {{appointed}} the European Union Special Representative for the Southern Mediterranean by the Council of the European Union on 18 July 2011. [...] As the EUSR, Bernardino León played {{a leading role}} in enhancing the EU's support to the countries in the Southern Mediterranean undergoing a democratic transition. As defined in the Council Decision 2011/424/CFSP, the main political objectives of the EUSR relate to the recent developments in the Arab world calling for a strengthened and comprehensive response from the EU, supporting the democratic transitions in the countries in the Southern Mediterranean region. The mandate sets out three policy objectives: 1. <b>Enhancing</b> the Union's <b>political</b> <b>dialogue</b> with the Southern Mediterranean, 2. Contributing to the response of the Union strengthening democracy and institution building in the countries, 3. Enhancing the Union's effectiveness, presence and visibility in the region and in relevant international forums.|$|R
5000|$|On 4 November 2010, US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton {{began her}} three-day visit to New Zealand and at 4:23 pm, she co-signed the Wellington Declaration with New Zealand Foreign Minister Murray McCully. The {{agreement}} signals closer relations between New Zealand and the United States, {{with an increase}} in the strategic partnership between the two nations. In doing so, the agreement stresses the continued pledge for the United States and New Zealand to work together, explicitly saying that: [...] "The United States-New Zealand strategic partnership is to have two fundamental elements: a new focus on practical cooperation in the Pacific region; and <b>enhanced</b> <b>political</b> and subject-matter <b>dialogue</b> - including regular Foreign Ministers' meetings and political-military discussions." [...] The agreement also stresses the continued need for New Zealand and the United States to work together on issues like nuclear proliferation, climate change and terrorism.|$|R
3000|$|In {{addition}} to seeking partners multilaterally as mentioned-earlier, the EU and Africa have also entered into bilateral joint strategic partnerships {{in order to}} <b>enhance</b> their <b>political</b> <b>dialogue</b> and deal with what they call issues of mutual concerns such as the climate change challenges. A {{case in point is}} the EU engagement in Africa through the Africa-EU Strategic Partnership on Climate Change and Environment and the support that the EU explicitly extends to the Climate for development in Africa program referred to as ClimDev Africa. This is an African initiative that seeks to make required information on climate change available to all African decision makers. Although the climate change challenge is no longer disputed by any country in the world, though the way to go about adapting to it and mitigating its effects and fully accepting its historic responsibility differs, the reality is that countries enter negotiations on climate change based on their national economic and security interests. That is so because countries in general base their climate change negotiation strategies on domestic interests driven by powerful stakeholders and local realities. This in effect is the reason why the United States government was lukewarm about the Kyoto Protocol and the Congress refused to ratify it. And as a consequence of that, former President Bush decided to withdraw the US from the parties of the Kyoto Protocol. Viewing this situation and understanding the politics of the International Climate Change Regime negotiations, one may be inclined to think that the leading countries in the EU, the US, Canada, China, India and other emerging powers as well as the African group on climate change negotiations and the Caribbean and Pacific Islands States representations should maybe focus on less contentious issues, and expend more energy and efforts onto the areas where divergence of positions are less considerable; i.e., the so-called `low-hanging fruit.´ [...]...|$|R
40|$|Do {{politicians}} talk to {{each other}} or talk past each other? In the last few years there has been renewed interest in the strategic thinking that drive politicians to engage in <b>political</b> <b>dialogue</b> with peers from a different political color. Most of this research, however, has been limited to understanding <b>political</b> <b>dialogue</b> in the campaign trail or in Congress. The dynamics of daily <b>political</b> <b>dialogue</b> in the written media, by contrast, have received limited attention. This research explores the dynamics of <b>political</b> <b>dialogue</b> through a statistical analysis of op-ed articles written by over 400 politicians in Venezuela. Using more than 6, 000 articles published in the Venezuelan media in 2004, I analyze the degree to which politicians engage in <b>political</b> <b>dialogue...</b>|$|R
40|$|Does the {{existence}} of <b>political</b> <b>dialogue</b> signal the lack of party institutionalization? Research on <b>political</b> <b>dialogue,</b> and the dynamics of issue ownership and issue salience, argues that parties have no incentive to trespass on issues owned by opponents. This requires that parties have niches of advantaged issues, which are obtained through the specialization of parties and their members via their platform and experiences in office. This characteristic signals {{the existence}} of an institutionalized party system where the party label has a meaning the electorate can interpret. In a non-institutionalized system; however, the party label has no meaningful value. In this context parties lack the programmatic clarity and experience that gives them advantages on issues. Given this, <b>political</b> <b>dialogue</b> should be more prevalent because politicians will be prone {{to talk to each other}} in order to set the agenda, attempt to control issues, and send signals to the electorate. As parties define themselves and become institutionalized, issues will become owned and parties will have more incentive to talk past each other, effectively diminishing <b>political</b> <b>dialogue.</b> In this paper I seek to understand these dynamics and the relationship of wining <b>political</b> <b>dialogue</b> and party system institutionalization. I argue that following a party system collapse, and the subsequent de-institutionalization of the parties, <b>political</b> <b>dialogue</b> will be more frequent; however, as political actors adapt to their new environment instances of <b>political</b> <b>dialogue</b> will diminish, signaling that the new party system is institutionalizing...|$|R
