5|$|Flanders and his brother, Ernest, were {{instrumental}} in developing screw thread grinding machines. These incorporated advances in thread technology (furthered by the Hartness optical comparator) and Flanders’s engineering calculations for gear-cutting machinery. In 1946, the two brothers received the Edward Longstreth Medal of the Franklin Institute as recognition of this accomplishment. They had improved the accurate manufacture of <b>die-cut</b> screws in soft metal and solved the problem of thread-grinding on hardened work.|$|E
5|$|Among Harrison's post-Beatles solo releases, Extra Texture is {{the only}} album on which his lyrics are devoid of any obvious spiritual message. Uniquely also, it was {{recorded}} mostly in America rather than England, while Harrison was working in Los Angeles {{in his role as}} head of Dark Horse Records. Gary Wright, David Foster, Jim Keltner, Jesse Ed Davis, Leon Russell, Tom Scott, Billy Preston and Jim Horn were among the many contributing musicians. The keyboard-heavy arrangements incorporate elements of soul music and the influence of Smokey Robinson, signalling a further departure from the rock and folk-rock sound of Harrison's popular early-1970s work. Contrasting with the musical content, the album's art design conveys an upbeat mood and includes an unusual <b>die-cut</b> cover with a textured surface.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} learn more about the working {{performance}} and dynamic characteristics of it, a new <b>die-cutting</b> experimental platform drove by gas-liquid pressurization system. To use the AMESim software simulates and analyzes this platform. The simulation results showed the velocity, output force and displacement of gas-liquid pressurization system. The output force of this system can meet the requirement of <b>die-cutting</b> press, and two stages of the velocity remain relatively stable as it moved. The operating characteristic analysis of <b>die-cutting</b> experimental table not only contributes to knowing about its running state, but also provides the basis for designing the <b>die-cutting</b> machine driven by the gas-liquid pressure cylinder...|$|R

500|$|The album's art {{design was}} {{credited}} to Capitol's in-house designer, Roy Kohara. Harrison supplied sketches {{for each item}} of the artwork, which adopted a humorous, [...] "wacky" [...] theme throughout the packaging. The vivid-orange front cover featured a <b>die-cut</b> design around the words [...] "EXTRA TEXTURE", through which an inner-sleeve, blue-tinted picture of Harrison was visible. Some vinyl editions presented the words as simple blue text on an orange background, however, doing away with the expensive cut-out detail. In keeping with the album title, the thin cardboard used for the LP cover was similar in texture to the [...] "animal skin used on a football", according to Beatles author Bruce Spizer. The front cover included an Om symbol, positioned below the angled title text and also coloured blue. On {{the back of the}} inner sleeve, there was a second Henry Grossman tour photo of Harrison, clearly enjoying himself on stage.|$|E
500|$|Continuing their {{theme of}} {{collectible}} 7" [...] vinyl releases, which had seen [...] "Vow" [...] packaged in an aluminium sleeve and [...] "Subhuman" [...] in black rubber, Mushroom packaged the 7" [...] format for [...] "Only Happy When It Rains" [...] in a [...] "Prismaboard" [...] (rain-effect) <b>die-cut</b> card sleeve, with a hologram logo sticker {{on the inner}} jacket. The b-side of the vinyl was pressed with a double-groove, so that either [...] "Girl Don't Come" [...] or [...] "Sleep" [...] played depending on where the stylus landed; the songs were shorter on the vinyl than {{they were on the}} CD or cassette formats to accommodate both {{on one side of the}} disc. This pressing was limited to 5,000 copies. The original design for the vinyl was for the sleeve to be made from wood, or corrugated cardboard, with wing-nuts in each corner like a flower-press. The nuts would have to have been unscrewed to find the vinyl disc inside - between ten layers of different types of cardboard.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, {{the basic}} theory of Axiomatic Design is {{introduced}} at first. Then {{the design process}} of the platen <b>die-cutting</b> mechanism is analyzed based on the basic concept and design process of axiomatic design. The functional requirements of the <b>die-cutting</b> mechanism, and the mapping and decomposition processes between designing parameters were presented. This provides the scientific basis for evaluating the rationality of the mechanism design, and plays a guiding role on design...|$|R
500|$|Schaper's {{game was}} not the first based upon the insect known as the [...] "cootie". [...] The {{creature}} was the subject of several tabletop games, mostly pencil and paper games, in the {{decades of the twentieth century}} following World War I. The Cootie Game fashioned by the Irvin-Smith Company about 1915 was a hand-held game that involved tilting capsules into a trap over a background illustration depicting a WWI battlefield. [...] In 1927, the J. H. Warder Company of Chicago released Tu-Tee, and the Charles Bowlby Company released Cootie; though based on a [...] "build a bug" [...] concept similar to Schaper's, both were paper and pencil games. [...] In 1937, Rork's released The Game of Cootie, and it too was a paper and pencil game. [...] A paper and pencil party game called Beetle is popular in Britain but its date of origin is unknown. [...] In 1939, Transogram published Cootie, a game featuring a three-dimensional wooden bug assembled in a <b>die-cut</b> tray. [...] Schaper's game was the first to employ a fully three-dimensional, free-standing plastic cootie.|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} issued {{in a clear}} jewel box with a <b>die-cut</b> {{cardboard}} O-card. It included sixteen pages, which fold {{out to be a}} poster, which displays the cover art. Both the disc and the disc tray feature — as described by Chris Morris — an [...] "image reflective of the mania displayed by the group's fans, and exemplary of American frequently deployed shock tactics: a kid carving the band's name into his arms with a scalpel." [...] Mike Bone from American Recordings said that [...] "we captured this not only by photography, but with video — him actually doing it." [...] The front cover was painted and designed by Wes Benscoter, an American artist who would later paint the covers for the other Slayer releases Undisputed Attitude and Live Intrusion. The album sleeve features for the second time the backronym Satan Laughs As You Eternally Rot. This phrase was first used on the vinyl edition of the album Show No Mercy where it was carved into the runout groove of the record.|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} {{announced}} on 14 May 2013 with a teaser trailer video along with updates from the band's social networks, revealing the cover art, the album title {{and the full}} track listing.

The middle insert cover is white and details all the album track listings and recording information. The outer cover has <b>die-cut</b> windows on the building, so when the middle cover is wrapped around the inner covers and slid into the outer cover, {{the title of the}} album is shown on the front cover, spelling out the name [...] "Physical Graffiti". Images in the windows touched upon a set of American icons and a range of Hollywood ephemera. Pictures of W.C. Fields and Buzz Aldrin alternated with the snapshots of Led Zeppelin. Photographs of Lee Harvey Oswald and Marcel Duchamp are also featured.|$|E

2500|$|Art {{direction}} {{was handled}} by Randall Jenkins from The Militia Group and Cartel. Jenkins created the artwork for the album. It was initially {{going to be}} printed on vellum, similar to what Copeland had used for their Beneath Medicine Tree (2003) album. Due to cost issues this was not done. Pugh said that [...] "it really didn't reflect the overall idea of the artwork {{we had in the}} long run." [...] The band then scrapped this and went for [...] "hi-res photos and things like that." [...] The concept for which came from Chris Donahue, Pugh and Jenkins. Jenkins produced all the photographs needed and compiled them. Jenkins also did the design and layout. The band photograph was taken by Zack Arias for Usedfilm. The Militia Group edition of the album was a jewel case with a slipcase while the Epic edition was simply a jewel case. The vinyl edition was a gatefold sleeve in a <b>die-cut</b> slipcover.|$|E
