5|$|When {{ready to}} emerge, several {{different}} strategies are used. In some species, {{the transformation of}} the nymph occurs underwater and the subimago swims to the surface and launches itself into the air. In other species, the nymph rises to the surface, bursts out of its skin, remains quiescent <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> resting on the exuviae (cast skin) and then flies upwards, and in some, the nymph climbs out of the water before transforming.|$|E
25|$|They feed in {{the mornings}} and evenings. They use their semi-prehensile lips to grasp grass stems, bend the stem down, bite off the top, and then eat the grass. They tackle very tall grasses or saplings by walking over the plant, with legs {{on both sides and}} using the weight of their bodies to push the end of the plant down {{to the level of the}} mouth. Mothers also use this {{technique}} to make food edible for their calves. They drink <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> at a time, often imbibing water filled with rhinoceros urine.|$|E
25|$|The {{police and}} the gang fired {{at each other for}} about a quarter of an hour. Then there was a lull but nothing could be seen <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> because of the smoke. Superintendent Hare {{returned}} to the railway-station with a shattered left wrist from one of the first shots fired. He bled profusely, but Tom Carrington, artist for the Australasian Sketcher, stopped the haemorrhage with his handkerchief. Hare then ordered O'Connor to surround the hotel, and later attempted to return to the battle but gradually lost so much blood that he had to be conveyed to Benalla by a special railway engine.|$|E

50|$|Sensitivity to a {{prolonged}} stimulation tends to decline over time, leading to neural adaptation. An interesting effect occurs when staring at <b>a</b> particular color <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>or</b> so. Such action {{leads to an}} exhaustion of the cone cells that respond to that color - resulting in the afterimage. This vivid color aftereffect can last <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>or</b> more.|$|R
500|$|Hardy came belowdecks to see Nelson {{just after}} half-past two, and {{informed}} him {{that a number of}} enemy ships had surrendered. Nelson told him that he was sure to die, and begged him to pass his possessions to Emma. With Nelson at this point were the chaplain Alexander Scott, the purser Walter Burke, Nelson's steward, Chevalier, and Beatty. Nelson, fearing that a gale was blowing up, instructed Hardy to be sure to anchor. After reminding him to [...] "take care of poor Lady Hamilton", Nelson said [...] "Kiss me, Hardy". Beatty recorded that Hardy knelt and kissed Nelson on the cheek. He then stood <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> before kissing him on the forehead. Nelson asked, [...] "Who is that?", and on hearing that it was Hardy, he replied [...] "God bless you, Hardy." [...] By now very weak, Nelson continued to murmur instructions to Burke and Scott, [...] "fan, fan... rub, rub... drink, drink." [...] Beatty heard Nelson murmur, [...] "Thank God I have done my duty", and when he returned, Nelson's voice had faded and his pulse was very weak. He looked up as Beatty took his pulse, then closed his eyes. Scott, who remained by Nelson as he died, recorded his last words as [...] "God and my country". Nelson died at half-past four, three hours after he had been shot.|$|E
500|$|Eastwood {{is known}} for his {{economical}} film shoots; his regular camera operator, Steve Campanelli, indicated the rapid pace at which Eastwood films—and his intimate, near-wordless direction—also featured during Changelings shoot. Eastwood limited rehearsals and takes to garner more authentic performances. Jolie said, [...] "You've got to get your stuff together and get ready because he doesn't linger... He expects people to come prepared and get on with their work." [...] Campanelli sometimes had to tell Jolie what Eastwood wanted from a scene, as Eastwood talked too softly. To provide verisimilitude to certain scenes, Eastwood sometimes asked Jolie to play them quietly, as if just for him. At the same time he would ask his camera operator to start filming discreetly, without Jolie's seeing it. Malkovich noted Eastwood's direction as [...] "redefining economical", saying Eastwood was quiet and did not use the phrases [...] "action" [...] and [...] "cut". He said, [...] "Some —like Clint Eastwood or Woody Allen—don't really like to be tortured by a million questions. They hire you, and they figure you know what to do, and you should do it... And that's fine by me." [...] Ryan also noted the calmness of the set, observing that her experiences working with director Sidney Lumet on 100Centre Street and Before the Devil Knows You're Dead were useful due to his sharing Eastwood's preference for filming a small number of takes. Donovan said Eastwood seldom gave him direction other than to [...] "go ahead", and that Eastwood did not even comment on his decision to play Jones with a slight Irish accent: [...] "Actors are insecure and they want praise, but he's not there to praise you or make you feel better... All he's there to do is tell the story, and he hired actors to tell their story." [...] Gaffer Ross Dunkerley said he often had to work on a scene without having seen a rehearsal: [...] "Chances are we'll talk about it <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>or</b> <b>two,</b> and then we're executing it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Death feigning {{behaviour}} can be deliberately {{induced by}} humans, a prominent example being the [...] "hypnosis" [...] of chickens or pigeons. For example, if a pigeon is grasped firmly, quickly inverted and held briefly {{on its back}} on a table, it often remains immobile <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>or</b> <b>two.</b> According to Gilman et al. the investigation of 'animal hypnosis' {{dates back to the}} year 1646 in a report by Kircher. It has been shown that the intensity and duration of death feigning is related to the intensity of fear prior to the feigning state being induced. This has been used to show that hens in cages are more fearful than those in pens, hens on the top tier of battery cages are more fearful than those on the lower levels, hens carried by hand are more fearful than hens carried on a mechanical conveyor, and hens undergoing longer transportation times are more fearful than those undergoing transport of a shorter duration.|$|E
