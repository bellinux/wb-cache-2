Economic history is not reversible and no trade agreement could re-create the same precise relationships between the agriculture of Southern and Northern Ireland in 1966 that existed in 1926, but closer trade and economic ties will make the current <b>farming</b> <b>trends</b> in Northern Ireland of much greater significance to the rural community in the rest of Ireland than has been the case in recent years...|$|E

We also estimate that 9 out of 10 farms are small (i. e. smaller than 2 ha). These farms are more specialized in staple crops than their larger counterparts, and exhibit slower productivity growth.

30|$|Our {{questionnaire}} survey {{revealed that the}} trend of framing practice has decreased in the communities, as 68  % {{of the respondents reported}} of decrease in <b>farming</b> <b>trend</b> from a decade ago. We also found out that about 75  % of the respondents used to undertake agricultural practices in the foraging area of BNC about a decade ago. Though it is still practiced, but has decreased considerably. Our study found a strong correlation between the population of BNCs and the <b>farming</b> <b>trend</b> in the study area; r = . 69, p < . 05. This probably indicates that the number of BNCs visiting an area is dependent on the way people practice farming. Likewise biological threats is also significant on the decline in the BNC’s population, r = . 73, p < . 05. We found that, though the trend in agriculture practice has decreased the use of in-organic fertilizers like urea and NPK (Nitogen, Phosphorus and Potassium) has increased considerably. Only a decade ago, 78  % of the respondents didn’t use any kinds of in-organic fertilizers but now 89  % of the respondents admitted of using it. This may be having some relations to the habitat preference for BNC, but it warrants further research.|$|R

40|$|For centuries, {{the populations}} of Mainland Southeast Asia (MSEA) have endured {{material}} poverty, particularly in rural areas and among subsistence-oriented, rice-farming households. In the 20 th century in particular, the impact of colonialism, war, and collectivist regimes exacerbated the poverty of rural communities. In recent decades, however, increased economic growth in MSEA countries {{has been associated with}} a marked reduction in poverty levels. As shown in Chapter 2, reduction of poverty within rural areas is the main source of this significant reduction in aggregate poverty in MSEA. The achievement of high rates of poverty reduction has derived from high rates of economic growth, especially in the agricultural sector. The real price of food is also an important determinant of poverty incidence, with lower prices helping to reduce both rural and urban poverty. Hence policies and institutions that promote increased agricultural productivity and do not significantly raise the price of food are most likely to maximise the rate of poverty reduction in the coming decades – both in rural areas and in the total population. The focus of this monograph has been on identifying the options for subsistence-oriented (i. e., rice-farming) rural households to capitalise on the poverty-reducing potential of the economic growth that is transforming the MSEA region. In this chapter we review the <b>farming</b> <b>trends</b> in the region and highlight the implications for agricultural research in coming decades...|$|E
40|$|Findings {{from current}} {{literature}} {{form the basis}} for this examination of five critical elements of change and development within the local community setting which impact on agriculture: population, employment, land, water, and environment. Renewed rural population growth during the 1970 's has reversed small <b>farm</b> <b>trends</b> but placed strains on local governments, frequently resulting in higher property taxes. Increased off-farm employment has provided supplementary farm income, resulted in less family labor available to support farm production, increased the number of small farms, and tied farm family living standards to economic conditions in the nonfarm sector. Rural community growth has intinsifed the demand for agricultural land for non- agricultural purposes, resulting in high land costs that are a key barrier to entry into farming.

The time series graphs from Vandendriessche et al. (2015) were extended and scanned for non-parallelisms between reference and wind <b>farm</b> <b>trend</b> lines. Also size distribution graphs were drawn and analysed. The analyses showed differences between wind farm and reference areas for the period 2013 - 2014. The positive short-term effects from Vandendriessche et al.

The positive shortterm effects on plaice (Pleuronectes platessa) and sole (Solea solea) could be explained by natural variations in the ecosystem. The earlier reported signals of a ‘refugium effect’ are no longer observed. The decreasing trend for dab (Limanda limanda Ammodytes tobianus) displayed episodic increases and short-term positive effects on juveniles. No long-term sandeel trends were visible.

30|$|All {{data has}} been {{deflated}} {{by means of}} the GDP deflator allowing comparison over time. While trends may still be present in deflated series, it has been decided to not de-trend these because of the following reasons. First, estimating the presence of a trend over short series (10  years, in the considered case) can be misleading because a single data can strongly affect the estimation. Furthermore, improvements of agricultural technologies leading to relevant trends are expected to happen {{over a long period of}} time (El Benni and Finger 2013). Second, using detrended data in the variance decomposition analysis has been shown to lead to biased results (Offutt and Blandford 1986). Third, trend analysis performed on the considered data has shown that deflating allowed to eliminate most of the trends present in the data. Indeed, significant (i.e. with R 2 [*]>[*] 0.6) linear <b>trends</b> in deflated <b>farm</b> income exist in only 11  % of the considered farms. Furthermore, in these few <b>farms,</b> <b>trends</b> are negative in 28  % of the cases but positive in the others (Table 8 in the Appendix). Finally, results suggest that none of the types of farming are clearly more affected by trends than other types of farming, because farms with significant FI trends are more or less distributed equally among all types of farming.|$|R

40|$|The {{trend in}} wind energy is towards large {{offshore}} wind <b>farms.</b> This <b>trend</b> {{has led to}} the demand for high reliability and large single unit wind turbines. Different energy conversion topologies such as multiple stage geared generators, single stage geared generators and gearless (direct drive) generators have been coupled to the wind turbine in the last decades.

However, the mass of such direct drive generators can be significantly higher than of other geared generators.
