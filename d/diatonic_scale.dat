The carving, named the Divje Babe Flute, features four holes that Canadian musicologist Bob Fink determined {{could have been used}} to play four notes of a <b>diatonic</b> <b>scale.</b> Researchers estimate the flute's age at between 43,400 and 67,000 years, making it the oldest known musical instrument and the only musical instrument associated with the Neanderthal culture. However, some archaeologists and ethnomusicologists dispute the flute's status as a musical instrument. German archaeologists have found mammoth bone and swan bone flutes dating back to 30,000 to 37,000 years old in the Swabian Alps. The flutes were made in the Upper Paleolithic age, and are more commonly accepted as being the oldest known musical instruments.|$|E
25|$|The <b>diatonic</b> <b>scale</b> {{appears in}} writing {{throughout}} history, consisting of seven tones in each octave. In just intonation the <b>diatonic</b> <b>scale</b> may be easily constructed using the three simplest intervals within the octave, the perfect fifth (3/2), perfect fourth (4/3), {{and the major}} third (5/4). As forms of the fifth and third are naturally present in the overtone series of harmonic resonators, {{this is a very}} simple process.|$|E

25|$|Bells {{are usually}} tuned to a Diatonic major scale, with the tenor bell being the tonic (or key) {{note of the}} scale. Some towers have extra bells, {{indicated}} by the + sign, which are used to allow different subsets of the full number to be rung, still to a <b>diatonic</b> <b>scale.</b>|$|E
25|$|Another {{construction}} works backward: It omits two pitches from a <b>diatonic</b> <b>scale.</b> If {{one were to}} begin with a C major scale, for example, one might omit the fourth and the seventh scale degrees, F and B. The remaining notes then makes up the major pentatonic scale: C, D, E, G, and A.|$|E
25|$|In music theory, the tritone is {{strictly}} {{defined as a}} musical interval composed of three adjacent whole tones. For instance, the interval from F up to the B above it (in short, F–B) is a tritone {{as it can be}} decomposed into the three adjacent whole tones F–G, G–A, and A–B. According to this definition, within a <b>diatonic</b> <b>scale</b> there is only one tritone for each octave. For instance, the above-mentioned interval F–B is the only tritone formed from the notes of the C major scale. A tritone is also commonly defined as an interval spanning six semitones. According to this definition, a <b>diatonic</b> <b>scale</b> contains two tritones for each octave. For instance, the above-mentioned C major scale contains the tritones F–B (from F to the B above it, also called augmented fourth) and B–F (from B to the F above it, also called diminished fifth, semidiapente, or semitritonus).|$|E

25|$|The minor second {{occurs in}} the major scale, between {{the third and fourth}} degree, (mi (E) and fa (F) in C major), and between the seventh and eighth degree (ti (B) and do (C) in C major). It is also called the {{diatonic}} semitone because it occurs between steps in the <b>diatonic</b> <b>scale.</b> The minor second is abbreviated m2 (or 2). Its inversion is the major seventh (M7, or +7).|$|E
25|$|The end {{of western}} tonality, begun subtly by Brahms and made {{explicit}} by Debussy, posed a crisis for composers of the 20th century. It {{was not merely}} an issue of finding new types of harmonies and melodic systems to replace the <b>diatonic</b> <b>scale</b> that was the basis of western harmony; the whole structure of western music – the relationships between movements and between structural elements within movements – {{was based on the}} relationships between different keys. So composers were challenged with building a whole new structure for music.|$|E

25|$|Originally, tuned sets of handbells, such as {{the ones}} made by the Cor brothers, were used by change ringers to rehearse outside their towers. Tower bell ringers' enthusiasm for {{practicing}} the complicated algorithms of change ringing can easily exceed the neighbours' patience, so in the days before modern sound control handbells offered them a way to continue ringing without the aural assault. The handbell sets used by change ringers had the same number of bells as in the towers – generally six or twelve tuned to a <b>diatonic</b> <b>scale.</b>|$|E
25|$|In music theory, {{the just}} {{intonation}} of the <b>diatonic</b> <b>scale</b> involves regular numbers: the pitches {{in a single}} octave of this scale have frequencies proportional to the numbers in the sequence 24, 27, 30, 32, 36, 40, 45, 48 of nearly consecutive regular numbers. Thus, for an instrument with this tuning, all pitches are regular-number harmonics of a single fundamental frequency. This scale is called a 5-limit tuning, meaning that the interval between any two pitches {{can be described as}} a product 2i3j5k of powers of the prime numbers up to 5, or equivalently as a ratio of regular numbers.|$|E
25|$|Naturals in {{that table}} {{are not the}} {{alphabetic}} series A to G without sharps and flats: Naturals are reciprocals of terms in the Harmonic series (mathematics), which are in practice multiples of a fundamental frequency. This may be derived by proceeding with the principle that historically gives the Pythagorean diatonic and chromatic scales, stacking perfect fifths with 3:2 frequency proportions (C-G-D-A-E). Considering the anhemitonic scale as a subset of a just <b>diatonic</b> <b>scale,</b> it is tuned thus: 20:24:27:30:36 (A-C-D-E-G = 5/3-1/1-9/8-5/4-3/2). Assigning precise frequency proportions to the pentatonic scales of most cultures is problematic as tuning may be variable.|$|E
50|$|The term {{diatonic}} originally {{referred to}} the diatonic genus, {{one of the three}} genera of the ancient Greeks. In musical set theory, Allen Forte classifies <b>diatonic</b> <b>scales</b> as set form 7-35.|$|R

50|$|<b>Diatonic</b> <b>scales</b> such as {{the major}} and minor scales lend {{themselves}} particularly well {{to the construction of}} common chords because they contain a large number of perfect fifths. Such scales predominate in those regions where harmony {{is an essential part of}} music, as, for example, in the common practice period of western classical music. In considering Arab and Indian music, where <b>diatonic</b> <b>scales</b> are used, there are also available a number of non-diatonic scales, the music has no chord changes, remaining always upon the key-chord, an attribute which has also been observed in hard rock, hip hop, funk, disco, jazz, etc.|$|R
25|$|Early plainchant, {{like much}} of Western music, is {{believed}} to have been distinguished by the use of the <b>diatonic</b> <b>scale.</b> Modal theory, which postdates the composition of the core chant repertory, arises from a synthesis of two very different traditions: the speculative tradition of numerical ratios and species inherited from ancient Greece and a second tradition rooted in the practical art of cantus. The earliest writings that deal with both theory and practice include the Enchiriadis group of treatises, which circulated in the late ninth century and possibly have their roots in an earlier, oral tradition. In contrast to the ancient Greek system of tetrachords (a collection of four continuous notes) that descend by two tones and a semitone, the Enchiriadis writings base their tone-system on a tetrachord that corresponds to the four finals of chant, D, E, F, and G. The disjunct tetrachords in the Enchiriadis system have been the subject of much speculation, because they do not correspond to the diatonic framework that became the standard Medieval scale (for example, there is a high F#, a note not recognized by later Medieval writers). A <b>diatonic</b> <b>scale</b> with a chromatically alterable b/b-flat was first described by Hucbald, who adopted the tetrachord of the finals (D, E, F, G) and constructed the rest of the system following the model of the Greek Greater and Lesser Perfect Systems. These were the first steps in forging a theoretical tradition that corresponded to chant.|$|E
25|$|The {{augmented}} unison, {{the interval}} {{produced by the}} augmentation, or widening by one-half step, of the perfect unison, does not occur between <b>diatonic</b> <b>scale</b> steps, but instead between a scale step and a chromatic alteration of the same step. It is also called a chromatic semitone. The augmented unison is abbreviated A1, or aug 1. Its inversion is the diminished octave (d8, or dim 8). The augmented unison is also the inversion of the augmented octave, because the interval of the diminished unison does not exist. This is because a unison is always made larger when one note of the interval is changed with an accidental.|$|E
25|$|The pentatonic scale plays a {{significant}} role in music education, particularly in Orff-based, Kodály-based, and Waldorf methodologies at the primary or elementary level. The Orff system places a heavy emphasis on developing creativity through improvisation in children, largely through use of the pentatonic scale. Orff instruments, such as xylophones, bells and other metallophones, use wooden bars, metal bars or bells, which can be removed by the teacher, leaving only those corresponding to the pentatonic scale, which Carl Orff himself believed to be children's native tonality. Children begin improvising using only these bars, and over time, more bars are added at the teacher's discretion until the complete <b>diatonic</b> <b>scale</b> is being used. Orff believed that the use of the pentatonic scale {{at such a young age}} was appropriate to the development of each child, since the nature of the scale meant that it was impossible for the child to make any real harmonic mistakes.|$|E
5000|$|The {{intervals}} between BP {{scale pitch}} classes {{are based on}} odd integer frequency ratios, {{in contrast with the}} intervals in <b>diatonic</b> <b>scales,</b> which employ both odd and even ratios found in the harmonic series. Specifically, the BP scale steps are based on ratios of integers whose factors are 3, 5, and 7. Thus the scale contains consonant harmonies based on the odd harmonic overtones 3/5/7/9 (...) [...] The chord formed by the ratio 3:5:7 (...) serves much the same role as the 4:5:6 chord (a major triad [...] ) does in <b>diatonic</b> <b>scales</b> (3:5:7 = 1:1.66:2.33 and 4:5:6 = 2:2.5:3 = 1:1.25:1.5).|$|R
50|$|The {{whole set}} of <b>diatonic</b> <b>scales</b> is {{commonly}} defined as the set composed of these seven natural-note scales, together with all of their possible transpositions. As discussed elsewhere, different definitions of this set are sometimes adopted in the literature.|$|R

500|$|In 1961 the Beatles {{recorded}} [...] "Cry for a Shadow", a blues-inspired instrumental co-written by Lennon and Harrison, who {{is credited}} with composing the song's lead guitar part, building on unusual chord voicings and imitating the style of other English {{groups such as the}} Shadows. The musicologist Walter Everett noted that while early Beatles compositions typically held close to the conventional patterns in rock music at the time, he also identified significant variations in their rhythm and tonal direction. Harrison's liberal use of the <b>diatonic</b> <b>scale</b> in his guitar playing reveals the influence of Buddy Holly, and his interest in Berry inspired him to compose songs based on the blues scale while incorporating a rockabilly feel in the style of Perkins. Within this framework he often used syncopation, as during his guitar solos for the Beatles' covers of Berry's [...] "Roll Over Beethoven" [...] and [...] "Too Much Monkey Business". Another of Harrison's musical techniques was the use of guitar lines written in octaves, as on [...] "I'll Be on My Way". He {{was the first person to}} own a Rickenbacker 360/12, a guitar with twelve strings, the low eight of which are tuned in pairs, one octave apart; the higher four being pairs tuned in unison. The Rickenbacker is unique among twelve-string guitars in having the lower octave string of each of the first four pairs placed above the higher tuned string. This, and the naturally rich harmonics produced by a twelve-string guitar provided the distinctive overtones found on many of the Beatles' recordings. His use of this guitar during the recording of A Hard Day's Night helped to popularise the model, and the jangly sound became so prominent that Melody Maker termed it the Beatles' [...] "secret weapon".|$|E

2500|$|Tonal music often modulates {{by moving}} between {{adjacent}} scales on {{the circle of}} fifths. This is because <b>diatonic</b> <b>scales</b> contain seven pitch classes that are contiguous on the circle of fifths. It follows that <b>diatonic</b> <b>scales</b> a perfect fifth apart share six of their seven notes. Furthermore, the notes not held in common differ by only a semitone. Thus modulation by perfect fifth can be accomplished in an exceptionally smooth fashion. For example, {{to move from the}} C major scale F – C – G – D – A – E – B to the G major scale C – G – D – A – E – B – F, one need only move the C major scale's [...] "F" [...] to [...] "F".|$|R
5000|$|As {{explained}} above, {{all major}} scales {{use the same}} interval sequence T-T-S-T-T-T-S. This interval sequence was called the Ionian mode by Glarean. It {{is one of the}} seven modern modes. From any major scale, a new scale is obtained by taking a different degree as the tonic. With this method it is possible to generate six other scales or modes from each major scale. Another way to describe the same result would be to consider that, behind the <b>diatonic</b> <b>scales,</b> there exists an underlying [...] "diatonic system" [...] which is the series of diatonic notes without a reference note; assigning the reference note in turn to each of the seven notes in each octave of the system produces seven <b>diatonic</b> <b>scales,</b> each characterized by a different interval sequence: ...|$|R
25|$|The semitone {{appeared}} in the music theory of Greek antiquity {{as part of a}} diatonic or chromatic tetrachord, and it has always had a place in the <b>diatonic</b> <b>scales</b> of Western music since.
