He turned out the remaining companies of GM 17, garbed them with identifying orange scarves, and sent them out to quell the insurrection. Bounleut and his coup force promptly donned orange scarves and rejoined their regiment. Elsewhere, on 1 February 1965, police were posted on guard at Phone Kheng prison.|$|E
25|$|The first {{official}} BMX sanctioning body was the National Bicycle Association (NBA) started by Ernie Alexander in 1972. Like Scot Breithaupt, he had motorcycle motocross in his background, and like Scot {{he was a}} promoter but a professional one with his American Cycle Enterprises (ACE). He was also a former Hollywood stunt man who promoted races at the famous Indian Dunes, built and managed by Walt James, where many movies and TV shows were filmed. In 1970 he noticed {{a group of kids}} trying to organize a bicycle race with their Schwinn Sting-Rays. Being familiar with motorcycle racing, he lent the kids a hand. He later opened the Yarnell track, a steep downhill course every bit as treacherous by today's standards as Scot Breithaupt's BUMS track—if not more so. In 1972 he created the National Bicycle Association, modeled on the existing American Motorcycle Association (AMA). <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>Mr.</b> Alexander who built a truly nation-spanning professional sanctioning body for BMX.|$|E
25|$|The fourth series {{features}} Nero, now in {{the main}} role, and his crew have replaced Josh and the Elmsbury gang who have all temporarily departed the series (except Isaac, who becomes Elmsmere's caretaker) and Dexter {{is trying to make}} it as an accomplished teacher, but is given the new job of taking care of Nero's shenanigans, which indirectly resembles Josh and Nathan's relationship in the first series. The teachers who appeared in series 3, Miss Parkwood and Aine O'Brien do not appear in this series, leading to the re-introduction of former head teacher Anita Andress (Liz Hume-Dawson). The series also introduced a new main character, rebellious and cynical tomboy Clem Burton (Jade Alleyne), who joins Nero's crew as well as mysterious spray paintings of Andress appear around Elmsmere, called 'The Phantom Sprayer', however it was later revealed that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>Mr.</b> Bell who was the criminal. A new love interest for Dexter, Science teacher Lizzie Baker (Sarah Schoenbeck), is introduced in episode one. A new recurring character, Isobel Harlow (Ruby Barnhill) appears from episode three. This series also features mini cameos from Josh's gang as shown in the series premiere and series finale. Nathan also makes his comeback in two episodes.|$|E

500|$|Although Swift found Motte {{willing to}} print the work, {{he was not}} willing to print Swift's {{additional}} scene. Swift's lack of control over the publication lead to Swift complaining of [...] "mangled and murdered Pages". This was one of many reasons that Swift turned from Motte as his printer and sought a printer willing to produce his complete works without content removal. On 9 October 1733, Swift wrote: [...] "Now, you may please to remember how much I complained of Motts suffering some friend of his (I suppose <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>Mr</b> Took a Clergy-man now dead) not onely to blot out some things that he thought might give offence, but to insert a good deal of trash contrary to the Author's manner and Style, and Intention." ...|$|E
500|$|Even though How the García Girls Lost Their Accents {{was written}} in the United States, there are {{significant}} historical ties between the novel and the author’s country of origin. Alvarez wrote an essay entitled [...] "An American Childhood in the Dominican Republic", in which she reveals some information about her own life. This is evidence that it may have served {{as the basis for the}} novel. For example, she mentions that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>Mr.</b> Victor, of the US embassy and a member of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), who persuaded Carlos García to join the resistance against Trujillo, and later helped him in leaving the country, and obtaining a job with an international cardiovascular team. This is a parallel to the novel in which Carlos Garcia obtains work as a doctor in New York. Julia Alvarez emigrated to the United States at the age of 10 with her parents and three sisters as political refugees from the Dominican Republic. The novel is a variation of her real-life experiences, which have perhaps been slightly altered. The majority of her literature is constructed from multiple viewpoints and a strongly concealed political undercurrent is present in her literature. In this case, that undercurrent is her family fleeing the Trujillo revolution, something she did as a child. The novel encompasses the impact living under a regime can have on a family, and the way it shaped the four girls' upbringing. It is also an attempt to understand memory, the past, and a time before the sisters lost their innocence and accents.|$|E
2500|$|Dave Kane and Joanne O'Neill, {{parents of}} {{youngest}} victim Nicholas O'Neill, released their {{letter to the}} board to reporters.

He apologized {{to the families of the}} victims and made no attempt to mitigate his guilt," [...] the letter said.|$|E

2500|$|Clementi's guest, {{identified}} only as MB at the trial, {{reacted to the}} verdict on March 16, 2012. He said, [...] "I had hoped for all concerned that a trial could have been avoided, {{but that was not}} my choice. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>Mr.</b> Ravi's decision, and now he will have to live with it." [...] MB's attorney said that the jury had been thorough and that the jury was correct in not finding MB to be the victim of a bias crime since the Rutgers students [...] "didn't know anything about our client".|$|E
2500|$|Ballistics {{experts have}} {{questioned}} whether the bullet which killed Lt. Oliver {{could have come from}} Workman's gun. Many years after the trial, Dr. Cyril Wecht, {{a board member of the}} American Board of Legal Medicine, has testified that, [...] "t is my professional opinion, based upon a reasonable degree of medical certainty, that the gunshot wound to [...] Ronald D. Oliver is not consistent with the type of ammunition used by Mr. Philip R. Workman. I do not believe that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>Mr.</b> Workman's gun that fired the shot that fatally wounded [...] Oliver." [...] As Dr. Wecht was giving evidence many years subsequent to the death of Lt. Oliver, he did not examine the body in person. Rather, his professional opinion was given on the basis of studying photographs of the deceased.|$|E
