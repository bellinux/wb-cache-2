40|$|The Israeli FEL {{resonator}} (W-band 75 - 110 GHz) was re-designed {{in order}} to reduce the overall round-trip losses and to control the radiation out-coupling. In its new configuration, the resonator consists of an overmoded corrugated rectangular waveguide and two radiation mode splitters, separating the high-energy e-beam from the mm-wave radiation. The electron <b>input</b> <b>splitter</b> is based on Talbot effect in an overmoded rectangular waveguide. The radiation out-coupling takes place in the output splitter. The splitter is based on a novel design. It combines Talbot effect between two parallel plates with free space propagation and with focusing by two curved cylindrical mirrors in a confocal imaging scheme. The waveguide and the splitters were tested, showing improved performance in comparison with the former resonator. The measured unloaded Q-factor of the new resonator is increased by a factor of ~ 3, up to Q= 25, 000. Accordingly, the round-trip losses are ~ 23 %. Rotating grids control the radiation out-coupling, allowing optimization of the radiation power and the extraction efficiency. The design layout and the testing results are presented.

40|$|Arrayed {{waveguide}} gratings (AWGs) {{are useful}} structures {{for the implementation}} of wavelength division multiplexing. The AWG consists of an <b>input</b> <b>splitter,</b> a dispersive waveguide array which creates the wavelength demultiplexing and multiplexing effects, and an output coupler. Because the dispersive waveguide array consists of bent waveguides, the size of an AWG is limited by the light loss in the bends. In their current form, silica-based gratings are too large to be made cheaply or to use as an integrated component. The proposed solution is to redesign the AWG using high index contrast materials for tight confinement of the waveguide modes and, consequently, low bend loss. A rough design is presented for a high index contrast AWG using multimode interference couplers as the coupling stages. The major components were simulated using finite difference time domain (FDTD) techniques to find low loss but rather high crosstalk. A second possible design is also presented, making use of a coupled waveguide array as the input element. The coupling coefficients of as many as 41 coupled waveguides were adjusted to create a Gaussian profile as an input to the dispersive section of the AWG. The output coupler, however, will make use of more standard free space diffraction techniques, making the overall concept a unique mixture of waveguide and free space optical elements. by Ryan N.

40|$|In this research, novel meta {{material}} structures {{based on}} microstrip integrated circuit technology {{have been investigated}} for filter application {{in the next generation}} of microwave wireless communication systems. A number of novel microstrip planar filter structures have been developed that are able to meet the stringent requirements for high-performance systems and subsystems, such as sharp-cutoff frequency response, low passband insertion-loss and high return-Joss, high out-af-band rejection, compact size, low cost and ease of integration. The filters are approximately 70 % smaller than their conventional counterparts. Analysis and mathematical modeling of these microstrip devices involved the use of transmission-line theory and EM simulation tools which were based on the method of moments and finite element analyses. Measured results were used to validate the predicted behavior and performance of these devices. In fact there was good agreement with the theory and simulation modeling. A Composite right/left-handed (CRLH) metamaterial unit-cell whose ground-plane is defected with a rectangular dielectric slot was used to develop a single and multi-pole bandpass filters. The unit-cell comprises of serial inter-digital capacitors whose junction is connected to a short-circuited inductive stub. By defecting the ground-plane of the unit-cell 's structure with a dielectric slot, which is located immediately below the unit-cell, enables substantial tuning of the filter's centre frequency in the order of 26. 5 %. This was achieved with minimal effect on the unitcell's insertion- and return-loss performance as well as its selectivity. The filters were fabricated on conventional dielectric substrate and their performance measured to verify the design methodology. The proposed technique eases the trade-off constraints that plague conventional filter designs and makes possible the realization of challenging filter specifications constituted from CRLH unit-cells using distributed transmission-lines. A novel multilayer technique is presented that enables (i) the control of the filter's bandwidth, (ii) significantly improves its passband selectivity, and (iii) enhances its out-of-band rejection without affecting the filter's overall dimensions. The technique involves implementation of identical filter structures {{on both sides of the}} dielectric substrate that are interconnected through vias. The filter circuit is laid on top of another identical substrate with a ground-plane. This structure results in a device that exhibits a sharp selectivity that is substantially smaller than traditional filter constructions. The sharpness of the filter is due to the upper and lower transmission zeros present on either side of the filter's passband being shifted closer together which causes reduction in its bandwidth. This effect is opposite to that encountered in conventional multilayer filter structures. It is shown the filter's bandwidth can be controlled while maintaining a good passband insertion- and return-loss performance, i. e. 10 dB, respectively. Furthermore, the proposed filter is relatively easy to fabricate using conventional technology. A diplexer was developed based on the proposed multilayer technique and was shown to yield a high out-af-band rejection and high isolation between the two very closely spaced channels. Normally isolators are used to provide isolation between channels in order to prevent inter-channel interference. The technique is relatively simple to realize and cost effective to manufacture. Design methodology and experimental results are presented that show good correlation between the measured and simulation results. This diplexer should find application in multi band wireless communication systems. A triplexer deSign is also presented whose multiband performance was created using CRLH unit-cell structures. The three passband channels of the triplexer have a common <b>input</b> <b>splitter</b> and transmission-line matching network is used to ensure high isolation between the channels is maintained in order to prevent undesired interaction between the channels which would otherwise adversely affect the triplexer's passband response. This was achieved using stepped impedance lines (SIL). No isolators were necessary using the proposed technique. It is also shown that by curving the SIL can provide enhancement in the triplexer's loss performance, bandwidth, and suppression of high order spurii. The design analysis and performance of the triplexer was verified via fabrication and measurement. A novel compact microstrip wideband bandpass filter was presented for wideband application that possesses good insertion- and return-loss, sharp frequency selectivity and high out-of-band rejection. The proposed filter comprises of two inter-digital capacitors with four inductive stubs. It employs a T-shaped open stub that is inserted between the symmetrical unitcell structures.

High sensitivity is achieved by correlation and averaging on two equal channels which measure the same input, and reject the background of the instrument. We show that a systematic error is always present if the thermal energy of the <b>input</b> power <b>splitter</b> is not accounted for. Such error can result in noise under estimation up to a few dB in the lowest-noise quartz oscillators, and in a complete nonsense in the case of cryogenic oscillators. As another alarming fact, the presence of metamaterial components in the oscillator results in unpredictable behavior and large errors, even in well controlled experimental conditions. We observed a spread of 40 dB in the phase noise spectra of an oscillator, just replacing the output filter. Comment: 20 pages, 11 figures, 37 bibliography item...|$|R

Several operating parameters were explored, including <b>input</b> material concentration, <b>splitter</b> position and feed rate. Experimental design for the tests is presented. Separation performance appears to be dependent on splitter position, a subjective parameter determined by the characteristics of the machine.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this work is to {{analytically}} investigate a range of design issues for PAs used in SDR applications, particularly the trade-offs in view of broadband limitations. This thesis explores basic bandwidth limitation analysis and introduces various broadband PAs design, before applying this to the realization {{of a number of}} DAs. This gives an understanding on the bandwidth limitation and the conceptual target to achieve broadband amplifiers while other RF parameters are fulfilled. It {{is important to note that}} to achieve high DA efficiency performance, the multi current sources must be combined to a single load by presenting an optimum virtual impedance to each current source in two directions (Zu(k) and Zr(k)). Measurement results showed PAE > 30 % is achieved across the operating frequency range with a broadband impedance transformer employing parallel coupled line approach. As an important point, one should note that the design concept presented in this work provides appropriate guidelines to maximize DA efficiency. A novel topology of dual fed DA including <b>input</b> and output <b>splitter</b> realized by lumped elements, and with the termination adjusted for the optimum power performance with low DC supply voltage is presented. The termination adjustment is accomplished by relevant improvement obtained in comparison to the conventional DA topology demonstrates the effectiveness of the topology. For a first time, pole zero identification technique is applied to the DA, to understand the origin of the oscillation nature due to the multi loops nature. The analysis considers the DA as a basic feedback oscillator circuit i. e. Hartley Oscillator and using a simplified transistor model. The origin of the oscillation can be pointed to the trans-conductance nature or multi-loops nature associated due to the feedback network. Large-signal stability analysis based on pole-zero identification is applied to analyze parametric oscillations in high-efficiency DPA. Large-signal stability analysis is then used to stabilize a high-efficiency 3 -section LDMOS DPA with a minimum impact on circuit performance. Two DPA development for SDR PA applications are demonstrated good results, where the first one has achieved 10 W output power, 32 dB gain and PAE > 15 % across the operating bandwidth with cascaded DPA. To the researcher’s knowledge, the best performance in output power gain response within an operating bandwidth up to 2 GHz are demonstrated with low cost implementation technology, and consumes reasonable small size area. Second DPA development using device load pull impedance termination values to determine vector combining input and output network design demonstrated highest output power-efficiency in the state-of-art of the DPA results. Measurement results of output power more than 35 W is demonstrated, and with reasonable selection of impedance values will lead to optimum output power efficiency performance across bandwidth. To fulfill the impedance matching to 50 -ohm load, with reasonable minimum loss, small area and cost, an impedance transformer/filter from 12 -ohm to 50 -ohm is designed. It has been exhibited that measured and simulated results are in excellent agreement, and the insertion loss of 1. 1 +/- 0. 9 dB is recorded experimentally...|$|R
