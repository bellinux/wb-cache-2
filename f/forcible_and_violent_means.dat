50|$|Certain {{classical}} jurists (Al-Tabari and the Maliki Ibn al-'Arabi) {{and more}} modern interpretations (The Religious Council of Egypt among others) have classified {{the crime of}} rape not as a subcategory of zinā, but rather a separate crime of violence under hirabah (<b>forcible</b> <b>and</b> <b>violent</b> taking), i.e. a violent crime causing disorder in the land in the manner described in the Qur'an (5:33) as fasad (destructive mischief).

40|$|The papers {{collected}} {{in this special}} issue are significant. Collectively they provide a genealogical approach to {{the interpretation of the}} global settler colonial present. This is, I believe, a topic worth exploring. How did settler colonialism as a particular mode of domination became a global phenomenon, a phenomenon that even exceeds the polities that emerged from the <b>forcible</b> <b>and</b> <b>violent</b> dispossession of indigenous homelands? If dispossession is crucial to these global processes, we should also focus on its complementary opposite: possession. In ‘Possession, Occupation and Settler Colonial Property Relations’ Brenna Bhandhar does for this concept what Lisa Ford did for territorial sovereignty. In her Settler Sovereignty, Ford demonstrated how the notion of modern ‘perfect’ territorial sovereignty coalesced first in two distinct settler peripheries {{at the beginning of the}} nineteenth century and then went global. Similarly, in her contribution to this edited collection, Bhandhar shows the ways in which the settler colonies were crucial laboratories for the creation of modern global practices surrounding possession. Property by registration, for example, was developed in the settler colonies but then travelled back to the metropoles and even- tually forward to parts of the formerly colonised world. It is important to note that while property by registration is crucially premised on terra nullius, and settler colonialism is crucially premised on terra nullius, terra nullius, unlike other typically colonial ideas that had to go underground, is today publically alive and shamelessly kicking...|$|R

Earlier collections of his satirical verses were Party Whips: by a Tory (1912) and Intercepted Letters (1913).

30|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} the full scope of how destructive and powerful cyberterrorism can be, it is important to gain a basic understanding of the actual word. The word “cyberterrorism” comes from the portmanteau of “cyberspace” (i.e., the makeup of data, algorithms, and computer networks) and “terrorism” (i.e., premeditated, politically motivated violence committed against innocent persons or noncombatants) (Conway 2002; Deutsch 1997). Cyberterrorism, in and of itself, is a method of attack designed to damage, tamper with, or destroy critical points of national infrastructure by controlling and manipulating computer networks (Denning 1999, 2000; Libicki 2009; Sloan 2006). The prefix “cyber” suggests that this type of terrorism occurs throughout cyberspace and is, in turn, accessible through computers (Conway 2002). The basic premise of traditional terrorism is the threat, or the actual use of violence against people or property, with the intention of inflicting enough harm to garner attention, create fear, and influence decision-making (Sloan 1981). A different concept than conventional crime, terrorism has roots in strong ideological motives, often with a goal of imposing principles and beliefs by illegal <b>and</b> <b>violent</b> <b>means</b> (Axelrod <b>and</b> Nicoletti 2009).|$|R

The Danzig fifth column in the League of Nations protected Free City of Danzig in 1939. The non-German Iraqi fifth column in 1941 during the Second World War and finally the fifth column that was understood to have existed in Iran until the joint Anglo-Soviet invasion of the country in August 1941.

Among these efforts, they formed a “Natural Resource Municipal Committee” which laid plans for a more equitable and sustainable development model in the Municipality, but have never received any support from the local government. Federal and state agencies that could mediate the local conflicts are conspicuously absent from the municipality. The isolation and transportation problems contribute to this situation; however, the mayor’s effort to keep any authority that could interfere with his interests is evident. Porto de Moz is an extreme example of the excessive power that mayors have in the Brazilian system. Nevertheless, it does not mean that decentralization should be avoided, but rather that there must exist effective checks and balances on the local power to prevent this kind of abuse...|$|R
40|$|This article {{appeared}} in Strategic Insights (September 2002), v. 1 no. 7 In {{the course of}} the past twenty years, Iran has undergone profound social and demographic transformations. These changes have sharply altered the nation's social structure, and have produced a population that is increasingly youthful, literate, urbanized, politically conscious, and even globalized. In light of these developments, it is not surprising that Iran's population has, whenever it has been given an opportunity to do so, responded in an overwhelmingly positive fashion to the reform movement's promises of socio-political liberalization and democratization. Internal weaknesses within the reformist movement and, more importantly, fierce resistance and opposition from the so-called conservative camp, however, have up to now impeded the reformers from implementing their agenda. Their standards of living declining and their expectations remaining unfulfilled, Iranians have become increasingly dissatisfied and despondent, losing faith in the ability of the reformers to change meaningfully the nature of the Islamic Republic. The fundamental transformations in the nature of Iran's society, combined with the de-legitimization of the system, are gradually but inexorably eroding the foundations of the Islamic Republic. As a result, the stage is being set for a political transition that will alter Iran's formal arrangement of power, and will turn the country into more of a secular (though not necessarily democratic) republic. This document examines whether this transition will take place through peaceful and incremental or sudden <b>and</b> <b>violent</b> <b>means...</b>|$|R
