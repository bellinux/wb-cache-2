500|$|Ville Valo is {{the main}} {{songwriter}} of HIM and his songs largely deal with themes of love. When talking about his songwriting, Valo stated: [...] "I didn't know {{how to cope with}} the world. Then <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>an</b> instrument, and through that I realized, that I am able to cope with the world and its evils, a bit better, through writing songs." [...] In terms of lyrical content, Valo has stated that [...] "I feel like there is no subject more important for a song than relationships. It's the only thing than touches me." [...] Valo also takes inspiration from literature, explaining that [...] "as a guy who writes songs, I get excited about an idea, or a book, or a sentence. I don't necessarily get excited about the whole of Tolkien, I just get excited about Uruk-hai. Just a little detail that just makes my mind work overdrive." [...] Valo and the rest of HIM have referred to their music as [...] "love metal", the idea of which was to combine more melodic and melancholic elements, with heavier influences, such as Black Sabbath and Type O Negative. Valo has described the music of HIM as [...] "sentimental, hard-hitting rock music".|$|E
2500|$|The {{carriers}} {{called them}} [...] "monkey cups," [...] a name I had heard elsewhere {{in reference to}} Nepenthes, but the implication that monkeys drink the pitcher fluid seemed farfetched. I later proved it true. In Sarawak <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>an</b> orangutan that had been raised as a pet and later freed. As I approached it gingerly in the forest, I offered it a half-full pitcher. To my surprise, the ape accepted it and, with the finesse of a lady at tea, executed a delicate bottoms-up.|$|E
2500|$|Of Wavell, Auchinleck wrote: [...] "In {{no sense}} do I wish to infer [...] that <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>an</b> {{unsatisfactory}} situation on my arrival – far from it. Not only was I greatly {{impressed by the}} solid foundations laid by my predecessor, but I was also able the better to appreciate {{the vastness of the}} problems with which he had been confronted and the greatness of his achievements, in a command in which some 40 different languages are spoken by the British and Allied Forces." ...|$|E

2500|$|On the {{evolution}} of technique in his illustration, Grossman has said, [...] "I {{was impressed by the}} way David Levine and the Push Pin artists were using line to develop a bulgy three-dimensional feeling in their work. <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>an</b> old airbrush in my dad's shop and discovered a jiffy way to outbulge them all. For a while I diligently pursued outline-less-ness as the secret to a real stereoscopic three-dimensional look. I felt my line work belonged to a different world {{that had nothing to do}} with the airbrush and went its separate way. Lately I find a strong line reasserting itself in my pictures." ...|$|E
2500|$|Television {{personality}} Bill O'Reilly studied {{journalism at}} the university in the 1970s and was {{a columnist for the}} student newspaper, The Daily Free Press. Describing his time {{at the university}}, he wrote, [...] "Throughout that fall at BU, covering stories became a passion for me. I loved going places and seeing new things. I ran around Boston annoying the hell out of everyone, but bringing back good, crisp copy" [...] and [...] "what I learned at Boston University firmly set me on the course I continue to this day. Amidst the chaos of Commonwealth Avenue, <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>an</b> occupation that I enjoyed." [...] The founder of the Albanian Orthodox Church, Fan S. Noli, received a doctorate from BU.|$|E

2500|$|Waits {{taught himself}} {{how to play}} the piano on a neighbor's instrument. He often took trips to Mexico with his father, who taught Spanish. He says that he found his love of music during those trips through a Mexican ballad that was [...] "probably a Ranchera, you know, on the car radio with my dad". He began playing in an R band called The Systems by 1965 while {{attending}} Hilltop High School in Chula Vista, California. His first job was at Napoleone Pizza House in National City, about which he sings in [...] "I Can't Wait to Get Off Work (And See My Baby on Montgomery Avenue)" [...] on Small Change, and also in [...] "The Ghosts of Saturday Night (After Hours at Napoleone's Pizza House)" [...] on The Heart of Saturday Night). He later admitted that he was not a fan of 1960s music: [...] "I wasn't thrilled by Blue Cheer, so <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>an</b> alternative, even if it was Bing Crosby." [...] Five years later, he was working as a doorman at the Heritage nightclub in San Diego where artists of every genre performed, and he performed his first paid gig for $6. He was a fan of Bob Dylan, Lord Buckley, Jack Kerouac, Louis Armstrong, Howlin' Wolf, and Charles Bukowski, but he began developing his own idiosyncratic musical style.|$|E
