There are also other variations, such as leaving out the herbs (parsley, cilantro/coriander, mint, sage) or the feature (garlic, finely <b>grated</b> <b>fresh</b> horseradish, minced shallot) or adding another item (Pecorino Romano cheese, anchovy, toasted pine nuts, grated bottarga).|$|E
50|$|Nutmeg and mace {{have similar}} sensory qualities, with nutmeg having a {{slightly}} sweeter and mace a more delicate flavour. Mace is often preferred in light dishes for the bright orange, saffron-like hue it imparts.

5000|$|Sashimi is popularly {{served with}} a dipping sauce (soy sauce) and {{condiments}} such as with wasabi paste and <b>grated</b> <b>fresh</b> ginger, or, for meat sashimi, ponzu, and such garnishes as shiso and shredded daikon radish. Wasabi paste is sometimes mixed directly into soy sauce as a dipping sauce, which is generally not done when eating sushi. Another way to flavor soy sauce with wasabi is to place the wasabi mound into the soy sauce dish and then pour it in. This allows the wasabi to infuse the soy sauce more subtly. A reputed motivation for serving wasabi with sashimi (and also gari, pickled ginger), besides its flavor, is killing harmful bacteria and parasites that could be present in raw seafood. Other garnishes, more common in Japan than overseas, include red water pepper sprouts [...] (beni-tade) and a small chrysanthemum [...] (kogiku). The chrysanthemum, unlike other garnishes, {{is not intended to}} be eaten, and in cheap service (such as at supermarkets) may be substituted with a plastic flower.|$|E
40|$|Within {{the family}} of Brassicaceae, an {{important}} source of glucosinolates (GLSs) is represented by horseradish (Armoracia rusticana P. Gaertner, B. Meyer & Scherbius), cultivated for its roots, which are <b>grated</b> <b>fresh</b> or processed into a sauce and used as a condiment. The characteristic pungent flavor of the root depends on the abundance of the bioactive GLS molecules. In crude plant extracts (sprouts and roots) of an accession of horseradish largely diffused in the Basilicata region (southern Italy), which develops many sprouts and produces white, fiery, and sharp-flavored marketable roots, we characterized the GLS profile by LC-ESI-LTQ-FTICR-MS and IRMPD. In sprouts and roots we identified 16 and 11 GLSs, respectively. We confirmed the presence of sinigrin, 4 -hydroxyglucobrassicin, glucobrassicin, gluconasturtin, and 4 -methoxyglucobrassicin and identified glucoiberin, gluconapin, glucocochlearin, glucoconringianin, glucosativin, glucoibarin, 5 -hydroxyglucobrassicin, glucocapparilinearisin or glucobrassicanapin, glucotropaeolin, and glucoarabishirsutain, not previously characterized in horseradish. Of particular note was the presence of the putative 2 -methylsulfonyl-oxo-ethyl-GL...|$|E

Well, that is what Mrs. Inglethorp did. You will notice that the word 'possessed' is spelt first with one 's' and {{subsequently}} with two--correctly. To make sure, she had further tried it in a sentence, thus: 'I am possessed.' Now, what did that tell me? It told me that Mrs. Inglethorp had been writing the word 'possessed' that afternoon, and, having the fragment of paper found in the <b>grate</b> <b>fresh</b> in my mind, the possibility of a will--(a document almost certain to contain that word)--occurred to me at once. This possibility was confirmed by a further circumstance. In the general confusion, the boudoir had not been swept that morning, and near the desk were several traces of brown mould and earth. The weather had been perfectly fine for some days, and no ordinary boots would have left such a heavy deposit.|$|R

The coconut filling is made by adding grated coconut (dried grated coconut can be used if you cannot get <b>fresh</b> <b>grated</b> coconut) to brown sugar syrup. The syrup is made by heating brown sugar in a small quantity of water. The resulting jam-like consistency is wrapped in the pancake skin. This is done first by rolling the pancakes around the coconut filling, then folding the sides and finally rolling it again to form cylindrical parcels.|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this article is}} to estimate the derived demand for imported cheese products into Japan when cheese import data are disaggregated by specific cheese group and by source country of production. We provide empirical measures of the sensitivity of demand to changes in total imports, own-price, and cross-prices among exporting countries for four market segments of the cheese category. Derived demands for U. S. <b>fresh,</b> <b>grated,</b> and processed cheese products are perfectly inelastic, and it is thus suggested that competition in these segments be based upon differences in product characteristics. However, the derived demand for “other” cheese is elastic, and competition can be price driven. Hence, an advantage of this paper's approach is that disaggregating import data for a product category helps identify specific marketing strategies for market segments within the category.

40|$|Mouse {{neuroblastoma}} {{cells in}} culture {{have been used}} {{as a model for the}} study of the mechanism by which activities of tyrosine hydroxylase (EC 1. 14. 3. a) are regulated in sympathetic tissue. The activity of tyrosine hydroxylase in cultured cells drops to barely detectable activities after 1 week and remains low for months in culture in the uncloned cell line of neuroblastoma. Activity in an adrenergic clone isolated from the uncloned line has about 20 % of the activity of the <b>fresh</b> <b>grated</b> tumor cell. N 6, O 2 ′-dibutyryl adenosine 3 ′: 5 ′-cyclic monophosphate causes a concentration and time-dependent increase in enzyme activity in both the cloned and uncloned cell lines. Enzyme activity is elevated by other stable analogs of adenosine 3 ′: 5 ′-cyclic monophosphate, notably the N 6 -monobutyryl, 8 -aminomethyl, and 8 -methylthio derivatives of the cyclic nucleotide; by the inhibitor of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase, papaverine; and by sodium butyrate.

50|$|Although whole {{mung beans}} are also {{occasionally}} used in Indian cuisine, beans without skins are more commonly used; but in Kerala & Tamil Nadu, whole mung beans are commonly boiled {{to make a}} dry preparation often served with rice gruel (kanji கஞ்ஞி). Dehulled mung beans {{can also be used}} in a similar fashion as whole beans for the purpose of making sweet soups. Mung beans in some regional cuisines of India are stripped of their outer coats to make mung dal. In Tamil Nadu, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, steamed whole beans are seasoned with spices and <b>fresh</b> <b>grated</b> coconut in a preparation called sundal சுண்டல். In south and north Indian states, mung beans are also eaten as pancakes. They are soaked in water for six to 12 hours (the higher the temperature, the lesser soaking time). Then they are ground into fine paste along with ginger and salt. Then pancakes are made on a very hot griddle. These are usually eaten for breakfast. This provides high quality protein that is rare in most Indian regional cuisines. Pongal or kichdi is another recipe that is made with rice and mung beans without skin. In Kerala, it is commonly used to make the parippu preparation in the Travancore region (unlike Cochin and Malabar, where toor dal, tuvara parippu,துவரப்பருப்பு is used). It is also used, with coconut milk and jaggery, to make a type of payasam. Soaked Moong (both full or split) called Hesaru in Kannada is one of ingredient in Kosambari a salad.|$|R
40|$|The orange-fleshed {{sweet potato}} {{is rich in}} carotenoids, which can {{potentially}} {{be used as a}} natural food colorant. However, effective and safe extraction techniques are needed. The carotenoid extraction of deep orange-fleshed cultivar (Beta 1) at different moisture contents of fresh tubers using combined solvents was studied. The research design was a factorial randomized complete design with two factors and three replicates. The first factor was moisture content of the grated tubers. The second factor was the ratios of ethanol and acetone. The extract obtained from the most effective extraction process was stored for 1 month at room temperature and also applied as a topping colorant for steamed cakes (bolu kukus) which was compared to bolu kukus treated with no colorant and with artificial yellow colorant. The results showed that the fresh tubers contained high moisture (79. 28 %) and beta-carotene (12, 169 µg/ 100 g wb) with the lightness value (L*) of 44. 77. Extraction of reduced-water grated-tubers (m. c. 60. 63 %) using ethanol-acetone at ratio of 5 : 5 v/v gave the highest content of beta-carotene in the extract (235. 94 µg/ml) with L* value of 52. 48. Meanwhile, <b>fresh</b> <b>grated</b> tuber extracted with ethanol-acetone (9 : 1 v/v) had the lowest beta-carotene content (12. 49 µg/ml). The extract stored in a dark bottle for 1 month showed better color stability with higher beta-carotene content (92. 18 µg/ml) than that of transparent bottle (20. 12 µg/ml).
