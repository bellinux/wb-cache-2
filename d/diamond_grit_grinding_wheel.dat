Stir cast Al 6061 -SiC composites with varying volume percentage of SiC reinforcement were ground on a conventional grinding machine with <b>diamond</b> <b>grit</b> <b>grinding</b> <b>wheel.</b> Three grinding variables were studied for simultaneous optimization of {{material removal rate}} and surface roughness. Initially, the response surface models for {{grinding process}} parameters were developed using response surface methodology. Further, the developed models were optimized using enhanced elitist non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (enhanced NSGA-II), a time saving algorithm in comparison to conventional NSGA-II. The suitable grinding conditions for multi-objective optimization of the grinding process were obtained from enhanced NSGA-II. Finally the confirmation tests were performed to validate the results obtained from response surface methodology and enhanced NSGA-II. It is observed that, experimental results and the results obtained from enhanced NSGA-II are in close conformance. Hence it is concluded that the developed algorithm can effectively be used for optimization of grinding process...|$|E

The surface roughnesses of the glass fibre and zirconia ferrule were investigated as functions of <b>diamond</b> <b>grit,</b> <b>grinding</b> speed and feed rate. The results showed a distinct difference in responses for the two materials with respect to surface roughness and material removal.

40|$|Grinding can be {{described}} as a multi-tooth metal cutting operation in which material is generally removed by shearing and ploughing in the form of micro sized chips by the abrasive <b>grits</b> of the <b>grinding</b> <b>wheel.</b> As a result, high temperature is produced in the grinding zone due to large negative rake and high cutting speed of the <b>grinding</b> <b>wheel.</b> Suitable cutting fluid is employed to reduce the temperature through cooling and lubrication in the cutting zone.

A <b>grinding</b> <b>wheel</b> wears rapidly during {{ultrasonic}} assisted {{surface generation}} {{of a large}} aperture aspherical RB-SiC mirror, which leads to an increase of grinding force and profile error.

40|$|Abstract. Although diamond tools {{have been}} used for over a century, the <b>diamond</b> <b>grits</b> {{distribution}} in the matrix is not uniform. This is because the large and light <b>diamond</b> <b>grits</b> tend to segregate from the small and heavy metal powder during the mixing process, hence diamond distribution in the diamond tools is intrinsically heterogeneous. As a result, the cutting performance of the diamond tools cannot be optimized. In 1997, Dr. James Chien-Min Sung applied two historical patents that can allow the design of diamond distribution according to a predetermined pattern. As the result, the life of diamond tools may be doubled; and the cutting speed, may also be twice as high. The three-dimensional saw segments with arrayed <b>diamond</b> <b>grits</b> were made back in 1999 with the improved performance as predicted. The Sung invention can allow the diamond tools industry to make ideal saw segment that has variable diamond size and diamond separation at different regions. Conventional diamond saws contain <b>diamond</b> <b>grits</b> that are distributed randomly in a metal matrix, as a result, their cutting speeds are slow and their sawing lives are short.

For a specific <b>grinding</b> interval, the <b>wheel</b> must be properly dressed, in order to remove swarf, sharpen the worn <b>diamond</b> <b>grits,</b> open up new diamond protrusions, and recondition the bond material. Dressing of diamond <b>grinding</b> <b>wheel</b> by alumina dressing tool has been simulated in a pin-on-disk machine in the research. Sharpening of the wheel is indicated by the increase of its roughness value, and surface microstructure with protruding sharp <b>diamond</b> <b>grits.</b> It was found that increasing of sliding distant from 100 to 500 m will increase the roughness of the wheel. The increase of contact load from 10 to 20 N will also increase roughness of the wheel, and the severity of wheel wear, indicated by high values of friction coefficient. A proper dressing of this nickel bonded SD 1200 diamond wheel is by sliding against alumina dressing tool for at least 300 m under 10 N load. Sliding velocity between 0. 1 to 0. 3 m/s has minimal effect to the results.

In this paper, a novel scratch device was proposed by integrating the parasitic motion principle linear actuator. The device has a compact structure {{and it can}} be installed on the stage of the scanning electron microscope (SEM) to carry out in situ scratch testing.

An analytical {{model of the}} interaction between CBN wheel <b>grits</b> and truing <b>diamond</b> <b>grits</b> was developed for rotary disc parallel and perpendicular arrangements of wheel-truer axes. The model takes into account the truing parameters, the geometry and features of the <b>grinding</b> <b>wheel</b> and truing disc, and grit retention capabilities of both these tools. It was found that number of collisions between CBN <b>grits</b> and <b>diamond</b> <b>grits</b> is predominantly dependent on truer specification. From the truing process parameters, when preparing a <b>grinding</b> <b>wheel</b> surface, lead is the most influential, followed by speed ratio and truing depth. ^ Experiments confirmed the importance of the above truing parameters as predicted by the analytical model. The limiting factor governing the frequency of wheel truing {{has been shown to be}} due to loss of profile rather than volumetric wear. In addition, if the truing conditions produce a dull <b>grinding</b> <b>wheel</b> the steady-state level of grinding force will be at a higher level than for optimally trued wheels. ^ A comprehensive cost model of the entire grinding operation, including auxiliary activities, was also developed. It can be used for continuous and batch-type production including reoccurring jobs. The model accounts for different types of superabrasive wheels and conventional abrasive wheels, as well as for continuous dress operation. It takes into account costs of various pieces of the equipment used, performance characteristics of each process involved in the entire grinding operation, and cost of machine time. The model allows for calculation of cost-per-part as well as target costs for all pieces of the equipment. Optimal batch sizes can be calculated for different types of wheels. Simulation results using the cost model in industrial applications are also presented. It has been shown that contrary to widespread beliefs, CBN wheels can be very cost-efficient even when used for production in small batches.

Recent {{developments}} in grinding {{have opened up}} new avenues for finishing of hard and brittle materials with nano-surface finish, high tolerance and accuracy. <b>Grinding</b> with superabrasive <b>wheels</b> is {{an excellent way to}} produce ultra-precision surface finish. However, superabrasive <b>diamond</b> <b>grits</b> need higher bond-ing strength while grinding, which metal-bonded <b>grinding</b> <b>wheels</b> can offer. Truing and dressing of the wheels are major problems and they tend to glaze because of <b>wheel</b> loading. When <b>grinding</b> with superabrasive <b>wheels,</b> wheel loading can be avoided by dressing periodically to obtain continuous grinding. Electrolytic in-process dressing (ELID) is the most suitable process for dressing metal-bonded <b>grinding</b> <b>wheels</b> during the <b>grinding</b> process. Nano-surface finish can be achieved only when chip removal is done at the atomic level. Recent developments of ductile mode machining of hard and brittle materials show that plastically deformed chip removal minimizes the subsurface damage of the workpiece. When chip deforma-tion takes place in the ductile regime, a defect-free nano-surface is possible and it completely eliminates the polishing process. ELID is one of the processes used for atomic level metal removal and nano-surface finish. However, no proper and detailed studies have been carried out to clarify the fundamental characteristics for making this process a robust one. Consequently, an attempt has been made in this study to understand the fundamental characteristics of ELID grinding and their influence on surface finish...|$|R
