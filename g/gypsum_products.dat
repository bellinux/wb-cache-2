Surakarta : Industrial Engineering Faculty of Engineering, Sebelas Maret University, January 2007. Interior <b>gypsum</b> is <b>gypsum</b> <b>product</b> {{which is}} used in frieze art to give artistic value {{with the result that}} a house can be seen more interesting. On the {{manufacture}} process of interior gypsum, gypsum was added with an inorganic material in the form of lasing fibre, which is known as rowing fibre. Usage of this lasing fibre was to strengthen interior gypsum from fissure and fracture defects during production process, occasionally occured at the moment of releasing printing mould as well as installation moment. These conditions can be minimized with several methods, among others by improving the compressive strength quality of the interior <b>gypsum</b> <b>product.</b> According to the previous study (Dani Instika, DETERMINING OF OPTIMUM SETTING USING TAGUCHI METHODS IN THE PRODUCTION PROCESS OF INTERIOR GYPSUM BASED ON THE EXAMINATION OF COMPRESSIVE STRENGTH (A CASE STUDY AT UD. MAHKOTA SOLO), the obtained result was rowing fibre function as lasing fibre didn't {{have an effect on the}} compressive strength of interior gypsum. Effort on exploiting other alternative materials as lasing fibre encourages the researcher to try using an alternative material as substitution of rowing fibre. This material is natural fibre in the form of Agave Cantula Roxb fibre. The aim of this research is to find out the influence of Agave Cantula Roxb fibre usage to the compressive strength of interior gypsum. According to the data processing, the result obtained from this research is, the factors which have an effect to compressive strength quality on interior gypsum at optimal condition are water and fibre volume fraction.

Reactivity of the two plasters has been evaluated by XRD and thermal analyses during setting and hardening. After molding prismatic specimens, weight and hardness have been measured and flexural and compressive strengths are measured at different dates.

Normal commercial gypsum plaster building components wich are made from -hemihydrate binders habe porosities between 0, 45 and 0, 55. The corresponding property values can be improved by a factor of more than 3 by halving the porosity. However, practical implementation of these results requires different production processes which will allow the water/plaster ratio to be lowered to values around 0, 3. Water/plaster ratios of < 0, 25 have already been achieved on an experimental basis. For the same porosity <b>gypsum</b> plaster <b>products</b> made from a- and -hemihydrate have practically the same mechanical properties...|$|R

40|$|The {{production}} and recycling of lead acid batteries, {{has a very}} important role in the lead industry. The entire lead consumption from battery production is about 60 - 70 % depending on a country, although recently the profitability is reducing due to environmental costs mostly in relation to waste generation and energy consumption. Very large amounts of toxic leachable soda slugs are produced for landfill from recycling spent batteries. Therefore developing a zero waste generating process to produce a new concept in the battery reprocessing industry is vital and which is the aim of this project. In this project a scientific and rational model for the production of gypsum that was validated on a pilot plant scale. Therefore it was necessary to investigate how the variation in chemical composition will affect the synthetically produced gypsum quality, i. e. analyzing the gypsum produced for some trace metals, such as Pb, Fe, Cu, As, Sb, Zn, Ni, Cd and Na. Most of these metals can cause a serious hazard to humans through inhalation, skin contact, eye contact or ingestion [Rai and Amit,Jan 2002]. Na is not toxic however it can cause efflorescence and Fe causes discolouration of the plasterboard. Synthetic gypsum can be produced by a simple chemical reaction between sulphuric acid (H 2 SO 4) and lime (Ca(OH) 2) or limestone (CaCO 3). The non-ferrous metallurgical industry produces large volumes of acidic effluents, or wastewaters, which are treated using lime neutralization in order to remove the acidity and heavy metals. The success of this research lead to investigating the possibility of making synthetic gypsum during the neutralization of acidic waste waters with lime or limestone. Gypsum samples were produced at different operational conditions (pH, temperature, mixer speed, residence time, etc.). The samples were analysed for trace metal content using flame atomic absorption spectroscopy and inductively coupled plasma spectrometry. Ultrasound assisted crystallisation during the synthesis of gypsum was performed to observe the possibility of obtaining a cleaner <b>gypsum</b> <b>product.</b> A 40 kHz ultrasonic bath and a 20 kHz ultrasonic probe were used in this investigation.

Various guidelines have been suggested for determining the size of anterior teeth, but different opinions have been reported regarding their significance. In the study reported here, the relationships between facial measurements and the width of maxillary anterior teeth in two ethnic groups, namely Aryans and Mongoloids, were determined. Objective: The aims {{of the study were}} to determine the inner inter-canthal distance (ICAD), inter-pupillary distance (IPD), inter-commissural width (ICOW), inter-alar width (IAW), and the combined width of maxillary anterior teeth (CW) in Aryans and Mongoloids and to determine the relationships between these measurements. Materials and methods: Impressions of the teeth of 170 dentulous subjects (85 males and 85 females) were made with alginate then Type IV <b>gypsum</b> <b>product</b> was poured in. Measurements of the cast maxillary anterior teeth at their widest dimension (contact areas) were made with the Boley gauge. ICAD, IPD, ICOW, and IAW distances were also measured with a Boley gauge. Results: For all 170 subjects, 85 Aryans and 85 Mongoloids, Pearson&# 39;s correlation coefficient (r) for IAW, IPD, ICOW, ICAD, and CW was calculated. In Aryans, highly significant (P< 0. 001) but weak correlations were found between CW and IAW, IPD, and ICOW. In Mongoloids, a highly significant (P< 0. 001) and weak correlation was found only between CW and IPD. Conclusion: Within the limitations of this study, the results suggest that the IAW, IPD, and ICOW for Aryans and IPD for Mongoloids {{can be used as a}} preliminary method for determining the width of the maxillary anterior teeth in edentulous patients.
