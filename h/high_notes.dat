In September 2008, Stefani released a fragrance line {{as a part of}} her Harajuku Lovers product line. There are five different fragrances based on the four Harajuku Girls and Stefani herself called Love, Lil' Angel, Music, Baby and G (Gwen). As of January 2011, Stefani has become the spokesperson for L'Oréal Paris. In 2016, Urban Decay released a limited edition cosmetic collection in collaboration with Stefani.|$|E
5|$|The {{breeding}} season is {{during the summer}} rainy season (mainly June to August in India) but can vary. Laboratory {{studies have found that}} long day illumination and high humidity trigger gonadal growth. The song of the male is very soft but complex and variable, audible only at close range. This song described as a jingle consists of a series of <b>high</b> <b>notes</b> followed by a croaky rattle and ending in a slurred whistle. When singing the male sits in what is called the slope posture—erect with the head feathers raised.|$|E
5|$|The tremolo call—sometimes {{called the}} “laughing” call—is {{characterized}} by its short, wavering quality. It often uses this call to signal distress or alarm caused by territorial disputes or perceived threats. It emits a tremulous series {{of up to}} 10 rather <b>high</b> <b>notes</b> (hu)-heheheheheheha. It also uses the tremolo to communicate its presence to other loons when they arrive at a lake, often when they are flying overhead. It is the only vocalization used in flight. The tremolo call has varying three levels of intensities that correlate with a loon’s level of distress, and the types are differentiated by increasingly higher pitch frequencies added to the call.|$|E

5000|$|The DCA (which {{determined}} how loud a given oscillator {{was at a}} given moment) {{was also}} modulated by another dedicated 8-stage envelope generator. The DCW and DCA also had a [...] "key follow" [...] feature; which determined how much <b>higher</b> <b>notes</b> affected a sound, making the DCW have a more dull sound with less harmonics with <b>higher</b> <b>notes,</b> and making the DCA envelope faster for <b>higher</b> <b>notes.</b>|$|R

25|$|Sutherland married Australian {{conductor}} and pianist Richard Bonynge on 16 October 1954. Their son, Adam, {{was born}} in 1956. Bonynge gradually convinced her that Wagner might not be her Fach, and that since she could produce <b>high</b> <b>notes</b> and coloratura with great ease, she should perhaps explore the bel canto repertoire. She eventually settled in this Fach, spending most of her career singing dramatic coloratura soprano.|$|E
25|$|Hungarian bagpiping is {{characterized}} in its styling by hiccupping, use of <b>high</b> <b>notes</b> to articulate lower notes, creating a characteristic rhythmic squeaking while the instrument is played. This playing style greatly influenced certain genres of fiddle music in Hungary, and also characterized early church organ music in Hungary: {{prior to the}} introduction of organs, the duda had been used to accompany hymnody in churches.|$|E

25|$|Other {{considerations}} in writing a singing translation include repetition {{of words and}} phrases, the placement of rests and/or punctuation, the quality of vowels sung on <b>high</b> <b>notes,</b> and rhythmic features of the vocal line {{that may be more}} natural to the original language than to the target language. A sung translation may be considerably or completely different from the original, thus resulting in a contrafactum.|$|E
25|$|Portamento {{effects can}} be {{achieved}} by changing the pitch while it can still be heard. This is commonly called a glissando, though this use of the term is not strictly correct. The most effective glissandos are those from low to <b>high</b> <b>notes</b> and those performed during rolls. One of the first composers to call for a timpani glissando was Carl Nielsen, who used two sets of timpani playing glissandos {{at the same time in}} his Symphony No. 4 ("The Inextinguishable").|$|E
25|$|On chain timpani, {{the tension}} rods are {{connected}} by a roller chain {{much like the one}} found on a bicycle, though some manufacturers have used other materials, including steel cable. In these systems, all the tension screws can then be tightened or loosened by one handle. Though far less common than pedal timpani, chain and cable drums still have practical uses. Occasionally, a timpanist is forced to place a drum behind other items, so he cannot reach it with his foot. Professionals may also use exceptionally large or small chain and cable drums for special low or <b>high</b> <b>notes.</b>|$|E

50|$|The <b>highest</b> <b>notes</b> on a {{clarinet}} {{can have}} a shrill piercing quality and {{can be difficult to}} tune accurately. Different instruments often play differently in this respect due to the sensitivity of the bore and reed measurements.

25|$|Urs, Tenor, {{most likely}} a Heldentenor. As its name implies, the heldentenor vocal fach {{features}} in the German romantic operatic repertoire. The heldentenor is the German equivalent of the tenore drammatico, however with a more baritonal quality. Therefore, the heldentenor voice {{might or might not}} have facility up to high B or C. The repertoire, however, rarely calls for such <b>high</b> <b>notes.</b> This seems to be evident in Il Divo's repertoire: the extent of his range evident in Il Divo's recordings shows he can sing from G2 up to C5. However, Buhler himself once revealed from a video chat with fans that he could sing from C2 up to G5.|$|E
25|$|Waters {{retained}} much of {{the backing}} band from his 1999–2002 In the Flesh tours, including guitarists Snowy White and Andy Fairweather-Low, backing vocalists Katie Kissoon and P.P. Arnold, plus Graham Broad on drums. Guitarist Dave Kilminster, along with Waters and Jon Carin, sang {{much of the}} lead vocal parts performed by David Gilmour and Rick Wright on the original Pink Floyd recordings. Andrew Latimer, leader of the progressive rock group Camel was auditioned to be lead guitarist and Gilmour's vocal replacement on the tour, but it was felt his voice could not reach the same <b>high</b> <b>notes,</b> although his guitar playing (often compared to Gilmour's) was exemplary.|$|E
25|$|On 15 March 1895 {{at the age}} of 22, Caruso {{made his}} {{professional}} stage debut at the Teatro Nuovo in Naples in the now-forgotten opera, L'Amico Francesco, by the amateur composer Mario Morelli. A string of further engagements in provincial opera houses followed, and he received instruction from the conductor and voice teacher Vincenzo Lombardi that improved his <b>high</b> <b>notes</b> and polished his style. Three other prominent Neapolitan singers taught by Lombardi were the baritones Antonio Scotti and Pasquale Amato, both of whom would go on to partner Caruso at the Met, and the tenor Fernando De Lucia, who would also appear at the Met and later sing at Caruso's funeral.|$|E

25|$|Much of what I {{did with}} my weight was very natural, vocally. Now I've got a {{different}} body—there's {{not as much}} of me around. My diaphragm function, the way my throat feels, is not compromised in any way. But I do {{have to think about}} it more now. I have to remind myself to keep my ribs open. I have to remind myself, if my breath starts to stack. When I took a breath before, the weight would kick in and give it that extra Whhoomf! Now it doesn't do that. If I don't remember to get rid of the old air and re-engage the muscles, the breath starts stacking, and that's when you can't get your phrase, you crack <b>high</b> <b>notes.</b>|$|E
25|$|One {{must not}} mistake the Mozartian {{dramatic}} coloratura soprano with the Italian dramatic coloratura soprano. A singer that sings Konstanze, Donna Anna or Fiordiligi can not necessarily sing the Italian dramatic coloratura parts, due to other vocal demands. Imogene, Leonora and Violetta require a dramatic soprano voice and {{are most often}} sung by dramatic sopranos with an agile voice that can easily produce coloratura and <b>high</b> <b>notes.</b> Roles like Norma, Lady Macbeth, Odabella or Abigaille are good examples of Italian roles that are not necessarily a coloratura soprano (even though the score calls for coloratura singing), but a full bodied dramatic soprano with a voice that can handle extreme dramatic singing and that is flexible enough to sing coloratura. Giuseppe Verdi wrote many parts like this in his early years.|$|E
25|$|The society issued {{recordings}} of symphonies and masses {{that had previously}} been unavailable on disc. It also published the first {{recordings of}} Mozart's Great Mass in C minor and Idomeneo. Landon travelled through central and eastern Europe in search of Haydn manuscripts. He edited critical editions of Haydn's music, principally the operas and masses, scarcely known at the time, and wrote his first book, The Symphonies of Joseph Haydn, which appeared in 1955. The book established the chronology of the symphonies, analyzed the scores, and discussed their role in 18th-century music and in Haydn's output as a whole. Landon could turn his scholarship to practical effect. The horn players of the Vienna Philharmonic struggled to reach the <b>high</b> <b>notes</b> in Haydn's unfamiliar Symphony No. 56; Landon established that Haydn's horns had been designed to play in a range an octave higher, and arranged for replicas to be made.|$|E

25|$|In 1959, Sutherland {{was invited}} to sing Lucia di Lammermoor at the Royal Opera House in a {{production}} conducted by Tullio Serafin and staged by Franco Zeffirelli. The role of Edgardo was sung by her fellow Australian Kenneth Neate, who had replaced the scheduled tenor at short notice. It was a breakthrough for Sutherland's career, and, upon {{the completion of the}} famous Mad Scene, she had become a star. In 1960, she recorded the album The Art of the Prima Donna, which remains today one of the most recommended opera albums ever recorded: the double LP set won the Grammy Award for Best Classical Performance – Vocal Soloist in 1962. The album, a collection consisting mainly of coloratura arias, displays her seemingly effortless coloratura ability, <b>high</b> <b>notes</b> and opulent tones, as well as her exemplary trill. The album was added to the National Film and Sound Archive's Sounds of Australia registry in 2011.|$|E
25|$|Offenbach {{intended}} {{that the}} four soprano roles be played by the same singer, for Olympia, Giulietta and Antonia are three facets of Stella, Hoffmann's unreachable love. Similarly, the four villains (Lindorf, Coppélius, Miracle, and Dapertutto) would be performed by the same bass-baritone, because they are all manifestations of evil. While the doubling of the four villains is quite common, most performances of the work use different singers for the loves of Hoffmann. This is because different skills are needed for each role: Olympia requires a skilled coloratura singer with stratospheric <b>high</b> <b>notes,</b> Antonia is written for a more lyric voice, and Giulietta is usually performed by a dramatic soprano or a mezzo-soprano. When all three roles (four if the role of Stella is counted) are performed by a single soprano in a performance, it {{is considered one of}} the largest challenges in the lyric-coloratura repertoire. Notable sopranos who have sung all three roles include Karan Armstrong, Vina Bovy, Edita Gruberová, Fanny Heldy, Catherine Malfitano, Anja Silja, Beverly Sills, Ruth Ann Swenson, Carol Vaness, Ninon Vallin and Virginia Zeani. All four roles have been performed by Josephine Barstow, Diana Damrau, Elizabeth Futral, Marlis Petersen, Georgia Jarman, Elena Moșuc and Joan Sutherland.|$|E
