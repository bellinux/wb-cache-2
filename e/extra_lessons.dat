60|$|When {{they reached}} Oak Hall they were {{nearly an hour}} late. They {{expected}} Job Haskers would lecture them and give them <b>extra</b> <b>lessons</b> to do, but fortunately they found Andrew Dale, the head teacher, in charge. He listened to their explanations with a smile.|$|E
6000|$|... "In one way, yes, sir; but in another, no," [...] he replied. [...] "Professor Lemm treated us very {{unjustly}} in {{the classroom}} in making us stay in and making us do <b>extra</b> <b>lessons,</b> and we didn't know of {{any other way to}} get square with him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know what}} he'll do," [...] was Randy's comment. [...] "He'll keep us {{both in and}} give us <b>extra</b> <b>lessons</b> to learn." [...] And in this surmise the fun-loving Rover boy was correct. For their rashness in snowballing the teacher they were made to stay in after school for two afternoons, and in {{addition}} had two extra pages of Latin to translate.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{following}} {{boys will}} go in to <b>extra</b> <b>lesson</b> this afternoon and next Wednesday," [...] it began. And [...] "the following boys" [...] numbered four hundred.|$|R
50|$|There {{is also a}} Demo option {{available}} on the main menu of Art Academy. The purpose of the Demo is to allow the player/art trainee to try an <b>extra</b> <b>lesson</b> offered in Art Academy, or to wirelessly send the same <b>extra</b> <b>lesson</b> to another local Nintendo DS console via DS Download Play, so that another user can try a demo version of Art Academy. This same Demo lesson is also permanently offered via Nintendo Channel, but this is currently only for PAL version Wii consoles. The Demo option is not {{available on}} the DSiWare versions.|$|R
60|$|Then {{the meaning}} of the notice flashed upon them. The {{headmaster}} had acted. This bloated document was the <b>extra</b> <b>lesson</b> list, swollen with names as a stream swells with rain. It was a comprehensive document. It left out little.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{just like}} this, Nappy. Of course, they haven't {{admitted}} it, {{but you know}} {{just as well as}} I do that Colonel Colby must have punished them pretty severely for the trick they played on Lemm. What he did to them, we don't know, but probably he has given 'em some <b>extra</b> <b>lessons</b> to do, and maybe he's punished 'em in other ways." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Up comes {{his master}} {{a few days}} ago," [...] Ellen continued. [...] "Fairly scared me to death. Said the boy showed signs of great talent in drawing. Talent in drawing, indeed! I'll give him talent! Wanted me to have him go to night school and pay for <b>extra</b> <b>lessons.</b> Said he thought the boy would turn out an artist. Nice bit of money there is in that!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Miss Stacy {{wants to}} {{organize}} a class among her advanced students who mean to study for the entrance examination into Queen's. She intends to give them <b>extra</b> <b>lessons</b> for an hour after school. And she came to ask Matthew and me if {{we would like to}} have you join it. What do you think about it yourself, Anne? Would you like to go to Queen's and pass for a teacher?" ...|$|E
60|$|Between ten {{and eleven}} on Wednesdays and Saturdays old Bates, the school sergeant, used to copy out {{the names of}} those who were in <b>extra</b> <b>lesson,</b> and post them outside the school shop. The school {{inspected}} the list during the quarter to eleven interval.|$|R
60|$|Here Mr Appleby, who {{had been}} trying {{for the last five}} minutes to find out where the {{whispering}} noise came from, at length traced it to its source, and forthwith requested Messrs Cook and Knight to do him two hundred lines, adding that, if he heard them talking again, he would put them into the <b>extra</b> <b>lesson.</b> Silence reigned from that moment.|$|R
50|$|The {{school was}} one of the first high schools in Hungary to {{introduce}} the teaching of the subject ’Introduction to Economics in’ its curriculum as an elective <b>extra</b> <b>lesson.</b> Within the scope of the subject students could join a student enterprise program called Young Enterprise to gain experience on running a business. From the school year 2005/2006 students have the opportunity of receiving the renowned Unified European Economic Certificate (EBC*L).|$|R
60|$|Jem Blythe {{had slipped}} into the {{graveyard}} and sat down beside the girls. He had been prowling about Rainbow Valley and had succeeded in finding the first little star-white cluster of arbutus for his mother. The manse children were rather silent after his coming. Jem was beginning to grow away from them somewhat this spring. He was studying for the entrance examination of Queen's Academy and stayed after school with the older pupils for <b>extra</b> <b>lessons.</b> Also, his evenings were so full of work that he seldom joined the others in Rainbow Valley now. He seemed to be drifting away into grown-up land.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am afraid, Professor Lemm, {{that you}} are not suited to be a teacher in this institution," [...] he said. [...] "Your actions here show {{that you are}} very {{irritable}} and unreasonable. After you left this office, I questioned all of those cadets closely, and all had practically the same story to tell; namely, that you had required more than was fair of them in your classes, and that, on the slightest pretext, you had punished them by making them stay in and do <b>extra</b> <b>lessons.</b> I went into many of the details, and I am convinced that in a good proportion of the cases the students were right and you were wrong. Now, I regret this very much, because I realize that----" ...|$|E
60|$|The Queen's {{class was}} {{organized}} in due time. Gilbert Blythe, Anne Shirley, Ruby Gillis, Jane Andrews, Josie Pye, Charlie Sloane, and Moody Spurgeon MacPherson joined it. Diana Barry did not, as her {{parents did not}} intend to send her to Queen's. This seemed nothing short of a calamity to Anne. Never, since the night on which Minnie May had had the croup, had she and Diana been separated in anything. On the evening when the Queen's class first remained in school for the <b>extra</b> <b>lessons</b> and Anne saw Diana go slowly out with the others, to walk home alone through the Birch Path and Violet Vale, it was all the former could do to keep her seat and refrain from rushing impulsively after her chum. A lump came into her throat, and she hastily retired behind the pages of her uplifted Latin grammar to hide the tears in her eyes. Not for worlds would Anne have had Gilbert Blythe or Josie Pye see those tears.|$|E
6000|$|... 'There is {{only one}} point which tells in your favour. You have not {{attempted}} concealment.' (Pringle nudged Lorimer surreptitiously at this.) 'And I may add that I believe that, as you say, you did not desire actually to win the prize by underhand means. But I cannot overlook such an offence. It is serious. Most serious. You will, both of you, go into <b>extra</b> <b>lesson</b> for the remaining Saturdays of the term.' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Extra</b> <b>lesson</b> {{meant that}} instead of taking a half-holiday on Saturday like an {{ordinary}} law-abiding individual, you treated the day {{as if it were}} a full-school day, and worked from two till four under the eye of the Headmaster. Taking into consideration everything, the punishment was not an extraordinarily severe one, for there were only two more Saturdays to the end of term, and the sentence made no mention of the Wednesday half-holidays.|$|R
50|$|ECA and CCA are <b>extra</b> curricular <b>lessons.</b> ECAs are clubs, such as Saint John's Ambulance Malaysia and Nature Club. CCAs {{has much}} examples, such as {{football}} and basketball.|$|R
60|$|It {{was about}} a week after the Bargees' match that the rules {{respecting}} bounds were made stricter, much to the popular indignation. The penalty for visiting Stapleton without leave was increased from two hundred lines to two <b>extra</b> <b>lessons.</b> The venomous characteristic of extra lesson was that it cut into one's football, for the criminal was turned into a form-room from two till four on half-holidays, and so had to scratch all athletic engagements for the day, unless he chose to go for a solitary run afterwards. In the cricket term the effect of this was not so deadly. It was just possible that you might get an innings somewhere after four o'clock, even if only at the nets. But during the football season--it was now February--to be in extra lesson meant a total loss of everything that makes life endurable, and the School protested (to one another, {{in the privacy of their}} studies) with no uncertain voice against this barbarous innovation.|$|E
5000|$|Support measures: include Waldorf <b>Extra</b> <b>Lessons,</b> Curative Eurythmy, Support Teaching and Integrated Learning Therapy.|$|E
50|$|When Jeassea {{is invited}} to sing at a jazz club, George gives her <b>extra</b> <b>lessons.</b> Over time, their {{friendship}} deepens.|$|E
50|$|The episode {{begins with}} Andrew and Jaime {{repairing}} the bucket of the incorrectly built rain catcher (so that {{the hole in}} the bucket, drilled by Jaime in the first group challenge, is now at the top instead of at the bottom), needed in fact to do the very next challenge. The episode ends with Candace being named the most improved, due to her redesigned shed, while Ruth was named the worst as she made unnecessary changes to her shed, and did not do a single challenge correctly. Her <b>extra</b> <b>lesson</b> is not shown.|$|R
50|$|At {{the final}} evaluation, Jo {{comments}} on Tex's mirrors not being {{level and the}} radiator cover being overbuilt, while Casey took pride in his mirrors without realizing the wall behind it is partially covered in wallpaper. Jo gives particular praise to Dez for thinking outside the box for the mirrors. Casey is named the most improved for {{coming out of his}} shell in the episode (despite Dez doing a better job overall) while Joe is named the worst (on Jo's insistence; Geoff had tried to name Charmaine for failing more challenges). Joe's <b>extra</b> <b>lesson</b> is to dismantle his radiator cover.|$|R
60|$|Pillingshot's {{views on}} {{behaviour}} and deportment during French lessons did not coincide {{with those of}} M. Gerard. Pillingshot's idea of a French lesson was something between a pantomime rally and a scrum at football. To him there was something wonderfully entertaining {{in the process of}} 'barging' the end man {{off the edge of the}} form into space, and upsetting his books over him. M. Gerard, however, had a very undeveloped sense of humour. He warned the humorist twice, and on the thing happening a third time, suggested that he should go into <b>extra</b> <b>lesson</b> on the ensuing Wednesday.|$|R
50|$|The {{students}} {{can choose the}} language class when they occur to the high school. It means one plus year when the students have <b>extra</b> <b>lessons</b> in English.|$|E
50|$|He {{was born}} in Edinburgh in 1862. He {{attended}} Daniel Stewart's College where he excelled. He was then apprenticed to a pharmacist, also taking <b>extra</b> <b>lessons</b> and exams in pharmacology at Surgeons' Hall.|$|E
50|$|There is a {{permanent}} team of staff on hand who can help with <b>extra</b> <b>lessons</b> and one-on-one learning. The school has two connections offices and provides help for those looking towards further and extended education. A school nurse is available to give confidential free advice.|$|E
50|$|The hall {{which was}} built in 1984, the High School Main Hall is used for Monday morning assembly. The hall is also {{converted}} for the badminton tournament during the Saturday <b>extra</b> co-curricular <b>lessons.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In this episode, {{the five}} contestants {{arrive at the}} Handyman Rehabilitation Centre. Prior to {{entering}} rehabilitation, the contestants were asked to specify the dimensions of their shed, along with a birdhouse-sized replica. At {{the end of the}} episode, Jeff, by virtue of never having done anything considered handiwork prior to rehab and nailing three boards together in this episode during the skills evaluation, is deemed the most improved handyman of this episode, while Candace, whose self-proclaimed [...] "renovation skills" [...] contrasted with it taking her 171 tries and five minutes to hammer in a single nail, was deemed the worst. Her <b>extra</b> <b>lesson</b> was in the use of hammers of all sorts.|$|R
30|$|The {{current study}} focused on {{identifying}} DIF-present items rather than exploring source of DIF when data were dually dependent. Admittedly, {{it is very important}} to understand why DIF happens, given that DIF-present items are accurately detected. Previous studies utilized both significance tests and effect size estimates to explore source of DIF. For example, Wu and Ercikan (2006) studied DIF due to cultural difference among countries (e.g., <b>extra</b> <b>lesson</b> hours after school) by the decreased magnitude of DIF effect size and decreased number of DIF-present items after including the cultural factor as an extra matching variable. To insure meaningful exploration of DIF, items suspicious of DIF need to be identified correctly first, especially when data have complex structure (e.g., dual dependency).|$|R
50|$|There are {{classrooms}} purposefully {{designed for}} each subject. There {{is no place}} for memorizing conceptual knowledge, neither is there any homework that doesn't serve a meaningful purpose. The intention is to teach students literacy, basic mathematics and to help them love their school through activities. Slow learners are given <b>extra</b> <b>lessons.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In the {{educational}} work environmental education has a prominent role. Students {{learn about the}} importance of environmental protection at elective <b>extra</b> <b>lessons,</b> through doing project work and educational trips. A new project on environmental protection, which is on the way to be state-credited, is being tested at the moment at this school.|$|E
5000|$|Mzingwane High School is a boys only {{government}} {{secondary school}} {{located in the}} village of Esigodini in the Matabeleland South province of Zimbabwe. In July 2007, the school was shut down and students sent home following violent student riots. [...] In 2014, the teachers of the school protested against the government's move to ban <b>extra</b> <b>lessons</b> and incentives.|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{analyzed}} {{the high school}} students’ collaboration processes of producing university entarance examination. Three groups of 3 to 4 members (in total 11 students) participated at the <b>extra</b> <b>lesson</b> of learning “how to make university entrance examination question from the view point of examination designer” {{by focusing on the}} protagonist’s emotional changes according to the relation with several characters or narrative context depicted in the short story written by S. Fujisawa. The results showed that deliberative argument or discussion are difficult for high school students in terms of three kinds of accountabilities of community, reasoning standard, and knowledge (Resnik, et al., 2010). However, several findings suggested that good teacher’s reflective intervention and good task worth learning could promote their learning through collaborative productions...|$|R
5000|$|For {{many years}} the school {{operated}} on a two-week timetable to better balance {{the time spent}} on minority subjects. In September 2007, the school system switched to a single-week timetable format and reformatted the timing and length of the school day. The system of six, fifty-minute lessons per day {{has been replaced by}} five, one-hour lessons—a system previously used up until the mid-1990s but now with an <b>extra</b> <b>lesson</b> allocated after normal school time. In 2015, the school day was changed again with the regular day finishing at 15:00 instead of 15:15 and lunch now finishing at 13:00. Also, Thursday enrichment now starts at 14:00 with a fourth lesson before enrichment. Year 9,10 and 11 now leave at 14:00 on Thursdays.|$|R
5000|$|Apart from {{academic}} work, {{students at}} Alder Grange {{can participate in}} other activities. These include the Duke of Edinburgh award scheme (bronze to gold), the Alderbeat radio station, or the Music School (includes <b>extra</b> instrument <b>lessons</b> or taking part in school productions such as a rendition of Grease).|$|R
