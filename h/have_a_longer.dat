5|$|Bohrium is a {{synthetic}} chemical element with symbol Bh and atomic number 107. It {{is named after}} Danish physicist Niels Bohr. It is {{a synthetic}} element (an element that can be created in a laboratory but is not found in nature) and radioactive; the most stable known isotope, 270Bh, has a half-life of approximately 61seconds, though the unconfirmed 278Bh may <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>longer</b> half-life of about 690seconds.|$|E
5|$|Elephants {{have been}} working animals {{since at least the}} Indus Valley Civilization and {{continue}} to be used in modern times. There were 13,000–16,500 working elephants employed in Asia in 2000. These animals are typically captured from the wild when they are 10–20 years old when they can be trained quickly and easily, and will <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>longer</b> working life. They were traditionally captured with traps and lassos, but since 1950, tranquillisers have been used.|$|E

5|$|The maximum {{lifespan}} of bats is three-and-a-half {{times larger}} than other mammals of a similar size. Five species have been recorded living over 30 years in the wild: the brown long-eared bat (Plecotus auritus), the little brown bat (Myotis lucifugus), Brandt's bat (Myotis brandti), the lesser mouse-eared bat (Myotis blythii) and the greater horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum). One hypothesis as to why bats can live so long is because they slow down their metabolic rate while hibernating, being consistent with the rate-of-living theory; bats that hibernate, on average, <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>longer</b> lifespan than bats that do not. Another hypothesis is that flying has reduced their mortality rate, which would also be true for birds and gliding mammals. Bat species which give birth to multiple pups generally have a shorter lifespan than species that give birth to only a single pup. Cave-roosting species may <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>longer</b> lifespan than non-roosting species because of the decreased predation in caves. The oldest recorded bat is a 41-year-old male Brandt's bat.|$|E
5|$|Domesticated rats <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>longer</b> {{lifespan}} {{than that}} of wild rats. Because domesticated rats are protected from predators and have ready access to food, water, shelter, and medical care, their average lifespan is around two to three years, in contrast to wild R. norvegicus which average a lifespan of less than one year. However, wild rats generally have larger brains, hearts, livers, kidneys, and adrenal glands than laboratory rats. The fancy rat and wild rat also both face a multitude of differing health concerns; the former is at risk of developing a pneumococcal infection from exposure to humans, while the latter may harbor tapeworms after coming in contact with carriers like cockroaches and fleas.|$|E
5|$|From {{the data}} he {{collected}} and documented, Aristotle inferred {{quite a number}} of rules relating the life-history features of the live-bearing tetrapods (terrestrial placental mammals) that he studied. Among these correct predictions are the following. Brood size decreases with (adult) body mass, so that an elephant has fewer young (usually just one) per brood than a mouse. Lifespan increases with gestation period, and also with body mass, so that elephants live longer than mice, <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>longer</b> period of gestation, and are heavier. As a final example, fecundity decreases with lifespan, so long-lived kinds like elephants have fewer young in total than short-lived kinds like mice.|$|E

5|$|Mature bulls {{can weigh}} up to 800 {{kilograms}} (1,800pounds) and cows can weigh up to 500 kilograms (1,100pounds). Cows typically have {{a height of}} 90–106centimeters (3–3.5ft), and bulls are typically {{in the range of}} 106–120centimeters (3.5–4ft). Mating occurs throughout the year with a gestation period of approximately 277–290 days. Most commonly a single calf is born, but twins are not unknown. Sexual maturity is reached at about eighteen months. Highland cattle also <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>longer</b> expected lifespan than most other breeds of cattle, up to 20 years.|$|E
5|$|Meitnerium is a {{synthetic}} chemical element with symbol Mt and atomic number 109. It {{is an extremely}} radioactive synthetic element (an element not found in nature that can be created in a laboratory). The most stable known isotope, meitnerium-278, has a half-life of 7.6seconds, although the unconfirmed meitnerium-282 may <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>longer</b> half-life of 67seconds. The GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research near Darmstadt, Germany, first created this element in 1982. It is named for Lise Meitner.|$|E
5|$|Modern plant breeders {{develop new}} crop {{varieties}} to meet specific conditions. A new variety might, for example, be higher yielding, more disease resistant or <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>longer</b> shelf life than the varieties {{from which it}} was bred. The practical use of crop diversity goes back to early agricultural methods of crop rotation and fallow fields, where planting and harvesting one type of crop on a plot of land one year, and planting a different crop on that same plot the next year. This takes advantage of differences in a plant's nutrient needs, but more importantly reduces the buildup of pathogens.|$|E

5|$|Roentgenium is a {{synthetic}} chemical element with symbol Rg and atomic number 111. It is {{a synthetic}} element {{that can be}} created in a laboratory but is not found in nature. The most stable known isotope, roentgenium-282, has a half-life of 2.1minutes, although the unconfirmed roentgenium-286 may <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>longer</b> half-life of about 11minutes. Roentgenium was first created in 1994 by the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research near Darmstadt, Germany. It is named after the physicist Wilhelm Röntgen (also spelled Roentgen).|$|E
5|$|Among 19 {{isotopes}} of curium, {{the most}} accessible are 242Cm and 244Cm; they are α-emitters, but with much shorter lifetime than the americium isotopes. These isotopes emit almost no γ-radiation, but undergo spontaneous fission {{with the associated}} emission of neutrons. More long-lived isotopes of curium (245–248Cm, all α-emitters) are formed as a mixture during neutron irradiation of plutonium or americium. Upon short irradiation, this mixture is dominated by 246Cm, and then 248Cm begins to accumulate. Both of these isotopes, especially 248Cm, <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>longer</b> half-life (3.48 years) and are much more convenient for carrying out chemical research than 242Cm and 244Cm, {{but they also have}} a rather high rate of spontaneous fission. 247Cm has the longest lifetime among isotopes of curium (1.56 years), but is not formed in large quantities because of the strong fission induced by thermal neutrons.|$|E
5|$|The 50-kilometre Cross Island Line will {{span the}} island of Singapore, passing through Tuas, Jurong, Sin Ming, Ang Mo Kio, Hougang, Punggol, Pasir Ris and Changi. The {{addition}} of the new line brings commuters with another alternative for East-West travel to the current East West Line, and will {{play an important role}} in Singapore's rail network. It will connect to all the other major lines to serve as a key transfer line, complementing the role currently fulfilled by the orbital Circle Line. This line will even <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>longer</b> timeframe due to the environmental study aspects, with the completion by 2030. The Land Transport Authority (LTA) has also expressed interest in the implementation of possible express services on the CRL in future, apart from having just normal services. This express service would benefit commuters during the morning peak hours as trains would stop at only the interchanges and skip the remaining stations, hence, reducing travel time greatly.|$|E
