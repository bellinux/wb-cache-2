40|$|The Author(s) 2013. This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract Heart rate {{is an important}} contributor in the pathophysiology of both coronary artery disease (CAD) and heart failure (HF). Ivabradine is an anti-anginal and anti-ischaemic agent, which selectively and specifically inhibits the If current in the sino-atrial node and provides pure heart rate reduction without altering other cardiac parameters, including conduction, and without directly affecting other haemodynamic parameters. It is approved {{for the treatment of}} CAD and HF. This article summa-rises the pharmacological properties, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy and tolerability of ivabradine in the treatment of CAD and HF, and presents evidence dem-onstrating that the pharmacological and clinical properties and clinical efficacy of ivabradine make it an <b>important</b> <b>therapeutic</b> <b>choice</b> for patients with stable CAD or HF. The positive effect of ivabradine on angina pectoris symptoms and its ability to reduce myocardial ischemia make it an important agent in the management of patients with stable CAD or chronic HF. Further studies are underway to add to the already robust evidence of iva-bradine for the prevention of cardiovascular events in patients with CAD but without clinical HF. The SIG-NIFY (Study assessInG the morbidity–mortality beNefits of the If inhibitor ivabradine in patients with coronarY artery disease) trial includes patients with stable CAD and an LVEF above 40 %, with no clinical sign of HF, and is investigating the long-term effects (over a period of 48 months) of ivabradine in a large study population. So far, this study has included more than 19, 000 patients from 51 countries. ...|$|E
40|$|Colorectal and {{prostate}} cancers {{are two of}} {{the most}} common types and cause of a high rate of deaths worldwide. Therefore, any strategy to stop or at least slacken the development and progression of malignant cells is an <b>important</b> <b>therapeutic</b> <b>choice.</b> The aim of the present work is the identification of novel cancer chemotherapy agents. Nowadays, many different drug discovery approaches are available, but this paper focuses on Molecular Topology, which has already demonstrated its extraordinary efficacy in this field, particularly in the identification of new hit and lead compounds against cancer. This methodology uses the graph theoretical formalism to numerically characterize molecular structures through the so called topological indices. Once obtained a specific framework, it allows the construction of complex mathematical models {{that can be used to}} predict physical, chemical or biological properties of compounds. In addition, Molecular Topology is highly efficient in selecting and designing new hit and lead drugs. According to the aforementioned, Molecular Topology has been applied here for the construction of specific Akt/mTOR and β-catenin inhibition mathematical models in order to identify and select novel antitumor agents. Based on the results obtained by the selected mathematical models, six novel potential inhibitors of the Akt/mTOR and β-catenin pathways were identified. These compounds were then tested in vitro to confirm their biological activity. Five of the selected compounds, CAS n° 256378 - 54 - 8 (Inhibitor n° 1), 663203 - 38 - 1 (Inhibitor n° 2), 247079 - 73 - 8 (Inhibitor n° 3), 689769 - 86 - 6 (Inhibitor n° 4) and 431925 - 096 (Inhibitor n° 6) gave positive responses and resulted to be active for Akt/mTOR and/or β-catenin inhibition. This study confirms once again the Molecular Topology's reliability and efficacy to find out novel drugs in the field of cancer...|$|E
40|$|Bacillus anthracis is {{innately}} {{resistant to}} trimethoprim (TMP), a synthetic antifolate that selectively inhibits several bacterial dihydrofolate reductases (DHFRs) but not human DHFR. Previously, {{we were able}} to confirm that TMP resistance in B. anthracis (MIC > 2, 048 μg/ml) is {{due to the lack of}} selectivity of TMP for the B. anthracis DHFR (E. W. Barrow, P. C. Bourne, and W. W. Barrow, Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 48 : 4643 - 4649, 2004). In this investigation, 24 2, 4 -diaminopyrimidine derivatives, representing a class of compounds with dihydrophthalazine side chains, were screened for their in vitro effects on B. anthracis Sterne and their selectivities for the B. anthracis DHFR. MICs were obtained by a colorimetric (Alamar blue) broth microdilution assay. Purified human recombinant DHFR (rDHFR) and B. anthracis rDHFR were used in a validated enzyme assay to determine the 50 % inhibitory concentrations (IC 50 s) and the selectivity ratios of the derivatives. The MICs ranged from 12. 8 to 128 μg/ml for all but nine compounds, for which the MICs were ≥ 128 μg/ml. The IC 50 values for B. anthracis rDHFR ranged from 46 to 600 nM, whereas the IC 50 values for human rDHFR were > 16, 000 nM. This is the first report on the in vitro inhibitory actions of this class of antifolates against TMP-resistant B. anthracis isolates. The selective inhibition of B. anthracis rDHFR and the in vitro activity against B. anthracis demonstrate that members of this class of compounds have the potential to be developed into clinically <b>important</b> <b>therapeutic</b> <b>choices</b> for the treatment of infections caused by TMP-resistant bacteria, such as B. anthracis...|$|R

Therefore, vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (VRSA) or vancomycin-intermediate Staphylococcus aureus (VISA) strains are warnings for the medical community. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of vancomycin resistance in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolated from the nose of patients hospitalized in Imam Reza Hospital, Kermanshah, Iran. Methods: In the present study, 85 strains of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus were isolated from patients in Imam Reza Hospital and evaluated for vancomycin resistance with microdilution test, Epsilometer test (E-test), and polymerase chain reaction (PCR).

40|$|Background: Cancer {{of unknown}} primary (CUP) is a fatal cancer, {{accounting}} for 3 - 5 % of all diagnosed cancers. Finding the primary site is <b>important</b> for <b>therapeutic</b> <b>choices</b> {{and we believe}} that the organ which is designated as the cause of death may give clues about the primary site. Methods: A total of 20, 570 patients with CUP were identified from the Swedish Family-Cancer Database. Causes of death - as reported in the death certificate - were investigated, analyzing reported metastatic sites and histological subtypes separately. Survival was compared with metastatic cancer with a known primary tumor. Results: An organ-specific cancer could be identified as a cause of death in approximately 60 % of all CUP patients with adenocarcinoma or undifferentiated histology. In adenocarcinoma, lung cancer was the most frequent cause of death (20 %), followed by pancreatic cancer (14 %), and ovarian cancer (11 %). Lung cancer was {{the most common cause of}} death in patients with CUP metastases diagnosed in the nervous system (69 %), respiratory system (53 %), and bone (47 %), whereas ovarian cancer was the most common cause of death when CUP was diagnosed in the pelvis (47 %) or the peritoneum (32 %). In CUP diagnosed in the liver, liver and pancreatic cancers accounted for 26 % and 22 % of deaths, respectively. Also in squamous cell CUP, lung cancer was the most common cause of death (45 %). Conclusions: According to the causes of death, the primary site appeared frequently to be either the organ where CUP metastases were diagnosed or an organ which may be traced through the known metastatic patterns of different cancer types...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Infection {{represents}} a frequent complication among patients in Intensive Care Units (ICUs) and mortality is high. In particular, {{the incidence of}} fungal infections, especially due to Candida spp., has been increasing during the last years. Methods In a retrospective study we studied the etiology of candidemia in critically ill patients {{over a five-year period}} (1999 – 2003) in the ICU of the San Martino University Hospital in Genoa, Italy. Results In total, 182 episodes of candidaemia were identified, with an average incidence of 2. 22 episodes/ 10 000 patient-days/year (range 1. 25 – 3. 06 episodes). Incidence of candidemia increased during the study period from 1. 25 in 1999 to 3. 06 / 10 000 patient-days/year in 2003. Overall, 40 % of the fungemia episodes (74 / 182) were due to C. albicans, followed by C. parapsilosis (23 %), C. glabrata (15 %), C. tropicalis (9 %) and other species (13 %). Candidemia due to non- albicans species increased and this was apparently correlated with an increasing use of azoles for prophylaxis or empirical treatment. Conclusion The study demonstrates a shift in the species of Candida causing fungemia in a medical and surgical ICU population during a 5 year period. The knowledge of the local epidemiological trends in Candida species isolated in blood cultures is <b>important</b> to guide <b>therapeutic</b> <b>choices.</b> </p...|$|R

40|$|Dosimetry {{planning}} {{is certainly the}} most typical neurosurgical instant in the radiosurgical procedure {{for the treatment of}} vestibular schwannomas (VS). Indeed, it is a key-moment in which the therapeutical choices will have a major influence on the clinical results, in terms of efficacy and safety. The therapist has to inform the patient about the rationale of the treatment, its limitations, the expected results, and the specific risks. Deep knowledge of the radiosurgical technique, of the principles of dosimetry, and of the therapist's personal experience, allows an a posteriori analytical study of the influence of the dosimetry <b>therapeutic</b> <b>choices</b> on the patient's outcome. Correlation between the preoperative <b>therapeutic</b> <b>choices</b> and the postoperative clinico-radiological information is mandatory to optimize therapeutic strategies. These <b>therapeutic</b> <b>choices</b> should be the result of a reflection integrating the clinical status of the patient, an understanding of the specific pathology of VS, awareness of the other <b>therapeutic</b> <b>choices,</b> and knowledge of radiological and surgical anatomy.

MethodsData were extracted from inpatient records in Urban Employee Basic Medical Insurance data of Tianjin, China, from 2003 January to December 2007. Expenditure increase for a basket of 63 constantly used anti-infective drugs was decomposed into three broad categories: price effects, quantity effects, and <b>therapeutic</b> <b>choices.</b> Furthermore, the injection anti-infective drug expenditures from 2006 to 2007 were decomposed into six determinants. ResultsFrom 2003 January to December 2007, the expenditure for a fixed basket of drugs increased by 9 %. The driving factors were <b>therapeutic</b> <b>choices</b> and quantity effects; each increased 48 % and 10 %, respectively. The relative price decreased by 33 % during the study period.

There is a deep current of belief in the United States that {{people have a right to}} choose their preferred treatments without government interference. Cries of “Death Panels” are routinely directed against health care reform proposals that might limit patients’ access to medical products and procedures.

It thus offers one of the most striking examples of a successful popular constitutional movement in American history.
