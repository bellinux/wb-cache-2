50|$|There {{are several}} ways a bureau can move money from the client to the people whom the client must pay. The {{simplest}} way is when a bureau prints checks on blank check stock, printing the client's account number in MICR digits {{at the bottom of}} the check, resulting in the funds being drawn directly from the client when the check is cashed. Other bureaus initiate automated clearing house (ACH) transactions from the client, and remit payment either electronically or in the form of paper checks against the bureau's <b>holding</b> <b>account.</b> Because finance transactions can be enormous (thousands to hundreds of thousands per pay period per client), bureaus often consider the interest earned ("float") on those amounts in the interim to be a substantial source of revenue. The interim is the period of time between when the funds are collected from the employer (client), and either when the paper checks are cashed, or when electronic payments (in the case of taxes) become due on their due dates.|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- Considering the {{transitory}} {{character of}} its operation, the linear induction launcher has dynamic performances {{such as the}} propulsion force and the projectile velocity which are significantly dependent not only on its geometrical dimensions but also on its feeding. In this paper, {{the effect of the}} latter, which is undoubtedly of capital importance, on the performances of the device is studied thanks to a model obtained by an analytical method called the coupled circuits method which we implemented. Our study related to two different prototypes. The first is a low speed laboratory prototype which comprises only one section of inductive reels and which was used to us as practical model on which tests were carried out for the validation of the adopted method. Let us note that the results obtained with these tests are given in this present paper. As for the second prototype, of which the geometrical data are fixed by <b>holding</b> <b>account</b> of the study undertaken on the first prototype, it comprises two sections of inductive reels. It is used as model of simulation in order to meter in obviousness the influence of the mode of feeding on the dynamic behavior of the projectile during its evolution within the sections of the launcher and {{at the time of its}} transition from the first section to the second section...|$|E
40|$|Aims of the {{research}}: Our research aims {{to address}} children’ situations throughout their different living environments, with <b>holding</b> <b>account</b> {{of the various}} dimensions of their wellbeing. As such, the issue of continuity (or discontinuity) constitutes a key factor for wellbeing: consistency. Theoretical Framework: Our research relies on a socio-ecological approach to child wellbeing, {{with a focus on}} institutional issues. Methodology: Data were collected by means of semi-structured interviews from 50 parents and 33 professionals residing/or working inside one of four contrasted areas of the Brussels Region. These two groups of proxi were treated as experts. Content analyses were performed on each group. Ethical considerations: Conditions regarding participants’ consent, their freedom of speech, and the preservation of their anonymity were guaranteed. Main findings: Preschool services typically organize and unfold their activities around diverse learning experiences, which relate to four main issues of: rules and structure, peer socialization, autonomy, and self-expression. Through the experience of childcare, children are slowly sensitized to these issues, rendering the transition to preschool smoother; professionals do count on it. Yet our results show the increasing number of children experiencing preschool as their first collective service. Thus they face not one but all four issues at once: the transitional period can easily become a prolonged period of discomfort. An additional issue concerns the knowledge of French as a second/ or new language: in our study, most families not inclined to use childcare were not proficient in French. Implications for practice and/or policy: A better home/school transition could be addressed through quality practices relying on adapted training and curricula, generalized adaptation periods and relevant parents’ implication, but also through supportive policies such as guaranteed access to preschool from 2, 5 years old and lower child/staff ratios among early preschool classes. info:eu-repo/semantics/nonPublishe...|$|E
40|$|Because of its mercury content, {{the dental}} amalgam causes controversies for the 19 th century. Thus, {{at the time}} of the {{diffusion}} of the European reports of the Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Risks (SCENIHR) and of the Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risks (SCHER), the positions of the scientific community in the United States, in Canada, and in Europe as for the risk of mercury coming from dental amalgams on health were analyzed. The principal points of the reports and the recommendations of good practice, emitted by the scientific authorities, are presented. It arises that the harmlessness of dental amalgams for the patients is recognized by the International Dental Federation, the World Health Organization, American Council one Science and Health, American Dental Association, Food and Drug Administration, and Health Canada. The French position is the same of that the United States. On the other hand, some Scandinavian countries took measures to limit or to prohibit the use of the dental amalgam. Norway made its decision of prohibition for environmental reasons and not of public health. The allergic risk exists for the mercury contained in the amalgams, but with a frequency it less low than for alternate materials containing resin seems. The latter would notreliable and studied enough to promote systematically their substitution of the dental amalgam. From the elements of the research evidence-based, it arises that the positions of the scientific community of the American northern countries and Europeans converge to indicate that the dental amalgam, in spite of the presence of mercury, does not present major health risks of the patients. It is thus important that the political decisions of the European institutions are made by <b>holding</b> <b>account</b> of the current scientific evidence and not under the pressure of professional lobbies and/or economic.

Specialists in this field consider that new {{information and communication technologies}} are particularly relevant as a tool to increase knowledge on autism because they use a way to control the communicative and emotional behaviours. The controlled generation of interactions between a child and a mobile toy-robot makes it possible to focus the attention of the child on a specific, reproducible and evolutionary task according to an adjustable protocol according to competencies and pathologies. The goals of this project must answer the following questions: how to support the interest of an autistic child by the use of a mobile robot {{within the framework of the}} play, alone and with a partner? Can significant clues and reactions of the child in the play be highlighted? How to deduce from the list of the behaviours of the robot those which favour these reactions and the play of the child? What is the architecture of a robot dedicated to this application? How to evaluate qualitatively and quantitatively the observed interactions and their relationships to the modifications of the interests of the child? The RobAutiSTIC pro ject will define the models, architectures and tools implementing a robot-like environment skeletal, adaptive for the design and the execution of interactive play activities. The processing of an intelligent trace of execution will make possible the a posteriori analysis of the activity and will provide elements of evaluation of the relevance of the clues and behaviours chosen for the activity frame (sequence of the situations at the time of the activity), elements used to reconfigure, to parameterise, to fit it. The environment will make it possible supply to the experts a system for the configuration of the interactive activities, the permanent observation of the actions and attitudes of the child and the robot during the execution of the play to analyse it in termsof behaviours: child movements compared to the robot, observation of the follow-up of the glance and indexed gestures.
