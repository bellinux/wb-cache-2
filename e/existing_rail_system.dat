50|$|A {{railway system}} {{dating back to}} the British colonial era, it is now {{considered}} inadequate in meeting contemporary transport requirements. Both goods and passengers would have originally arrived by ship and hence the railway terminates at Tanjong Pagar, where port operations are still concentrated. There was similarly a branch line which leads to the Jurong industrial area, but which has since been expunged. The development of an efficient transport network in Singapore, and the containerisation of maritime trade globally meant that the <b>existing</b> <b>rail</b> <b>system</b> no longer played a significant part in the ferrying of goods, and is now catered primarily for passenger transport.|$|E
5000|$|Following further {{work and}} the {{enactment}} of a new transport act, the regional public transport authorities presented a new proposal for a combined regional U-Bahn and S-Bahn system (that is, a suburban network based on the <b>existing</b> <b>rail</b> <b>system)</b> [...] From Zürich Airport, an U-Bahn line would run via Glattbrugg, Oerlikon, Hirschenwiesen, Central, Zürich Main Station, Stauffacher and Altstetten to Dietikon.

5000|$|The state’s {{transport}} {{problem was}} threefold. First, the <b>existing</b> <b>rail</b> <b>system</b> was expensive to run, {{not least because}} the operator, RailCorp, remained tied to old-style industrial practices and excessively high engineering standards. Delivering MREP would lock in these inefficiencies. Second, even if costs could be brought under control, the sheer scale of investment required to extend an all-purpose heavy rail system was beyond the state's means. Put simply, MREP was unaffordable in its current form. Third, while {{the need for additional}} extensions into the new bus and car-dependent suburbs of the north-west and south-west was clear - and would be aided by the partial preservation of corridors in the past - congestion at the existing [...] and [...] stations meant that to work, any new rail project had to increase capacity in the CBD.

5000|$|Between {{the end of}} the 1990s and {{the early}} 2000s, CPTM began the {{conversion}} of some metropolitan lines to provide a service similar to rapid transit and better integrate with the São Paulo Metro. Currently, the old 19th century stations have never been modernized and the need arose due to the high passenger demand using the <b>existing</b> <b>rail</b> <b>system.</b> Stations where rebuilt and new trains were purchased allowing the headway of lines to be as low as five minutes in some lines. This experience started in Line E, in the stretch known as [...] "East Express", serving the east end of São Paulo City and running parallel to Line 3 - Red. The stretch completed (to Guaianazes station) today has modernized trains and stations with new alignments in some sections. The next stretch to be built, between Guaianazes station, in São Paulo City, and Estudantes in Mogi das Cruzes, also covering the municipalities of Ferraz de Vasconcelos, Suzano and Poá, is estimated to have its works resumed in 2007, but this was again postponed, now to 2008.|$|E
5000|$|As of July 2017 {{nothing has}} been done on any of the {{projects}} and the metro is still on hold. Instead, a new plan was announced on 3 July 2017, which envisions first two lines as the 22 km long Makiš-Mirijevo (via Sava Amphitheatre and Karaburma) and the 19.8 km long Zemun-Ustanička. The construction should start in the end of 2019 or the beginning of 2020 and should be finished in 3 to 4 years. Unlike any of the previous projects, metro is to be complementary with the already <b>existing</b> <b>rail</b> <b>system</b> BG Voz, including the exchange of the passengers. The pre-feasibility study is to be conducted by the Egis Group. Plan is that the study will take 9 month to complete and then the main project is to be drafted. The project also differs from all the previous ones as it sets the crossing of the major lines under the Belgrade Waterfront on the Sava bank, a highly controversial pet project of President of Serbia Aleksandar Vučić and mayor Mali, instead under the central city squares of Terazije or Republic Square as planned in the previous decades. Mali also announced that the first line is actually going to be Makiš Field-Mirijevo (that is, Višnjičko Polje). Architects and engineers reacted negatively, especially since both terminuses are at the moment nothing more than still un-urbanized heaths, though mayor Mali said that this line will connect the future projects which will [...] "with the development of metro, bring billions of euros in investments and millions of square meters of the new business areas". Dr Ratomir Vračarević, traffic engineer and professor at the University of Belgrade's Faculty of Technical Sciences said how the surveys showed that this direction has a very low number of potential commuters, well below the profitability level. He added that we still don't know how much of it will go below or above the ground and the Belgrade Waterfront section is going to be costly in general, especially if it goes underground because that area is basically a filled swamp. Branislav Jovin, who authored the 1970s subway project, said that everything in the city is being subordinated to the Belgrade Waterfront. He addressed the right of 1,65 million inhabitants of Belgrade who deserve more to have a metro instead of the, still non-existing, population of Belgrade Waterfront, as not one building hasn't been done yet. As the project is made as an ultra luxurious complex for the rich, Jovin asked [...] "do you really believe that people who live in those luxurious apartments will commute via metro?". He also believes that Makiš was chosen because of the announced project of Tesla Grad ("Tesla City") by Bogoljub Karić, Karić, a tycoon who fled the country so that he wouldn't be trialed for financial schemes, returned after the change of government and announced the [...] "Tesla Grad", a business-residential complex in the Makiš Field. The critics also pointed to the fact that Makiš is the major water purification facility in Belgrade and made negative remarks on mayor's assessment that his SMART plan is the [...] "first serious survey" [...] on the subject.|$|E

40|$|Many {{groups have}} been pushing for a shift from {{automotive}} oriented transportation and land use, to transit-oriented transportation and land use. These groups have many valid reasons. However, {{just as it is}} fair to point out issues about auto travel, so too is it fair to see how transit performs at meeting certain goals. This paper examines the important characteristic of accessibility afforded to travelers. This is quantified through the calculation of accessibility indexes for stations, for the specific case of two <b>existing</b> <b>rail</b> <b>systems</b> and four proposed rail extensions in the San Francisco Bay Area. As a whole, the four extensions investigated increase regionwide rail accessibility by 18. 5 percent, not an insignificant increase. However, the new stations are on average less accessible than their existing counterparts. Two of the four extensions perform well on accessibility measures, either their stations have high accessibility, or jobs around them contribute to high accessibility for nearby stations. The other two extensions however perform poorly on accessibility measures. In a time of limited resources, the accessibility results clearly indicate how the four extensions should be prioritized. The more successful extensions have good access to activity centers. Extensions having good connectivity with other lines can also enhance accessibility if providing significant travel time savings...|$|R

Despite reductions in rail costs in the 1980 s and 1990 s, cross-country disparities in cost levels remain substantial. We argue that there are four areas in which the level of rail efficiency causes concern: a. the adequacy and allocation of investment: we note evidence that Australian <b>rail</b> <b>systems</b> have tended both to under-invest and to choose poorly between different investment projects. We note the importance of incentives as a way of ensuring rational behaviour and argue that managers of state <b>rail</b> <b>systems</b> have not received the correct signals.

30|$|In recent years, China {{has spent}} several {{trillion}} yuan to construct inter-city high-speed rails and to expand metro-systems or undergrounds {{in major cities}} such as Shenzhen, Guangzhou, Shanghai, Beijing, etc. [3, 9] According to the official Xinhua News Agency [10], China invested 745.5 billion yuan (USD 115 billion) in building railways in 2011 alone. As {{at the end of}} 2010, China had already taken the lead with more than 7000  km of high-speed railways in service in the world [9]. As the inter-city high-speed railway system that is a complex system involving engineering, social, and economic factors is affected by climatic and human factors, Ning et al.

Residents of the urban neighborhood and those who lived more than half a mile from the nearest transit station were more willing to use the shuttle. Interestingly, 20 % of single-occupant automobile users in both the urban and suburban communities were highly willing to use the shuttle, if only on a trial basis. Furthermore, those who park-and-ride in the suburban neighborhood and those who carpool or ride transit in the urban neighborhood were most likely to try the proposed shuttle service. ...|$|R

50|$|All third <b>rail</b> <b>systems</b> {{throughout}} the world are energised with DC supplies. The use of AC is not feasible because of the skin effect.

This would require the substations to be unacceptably close together. Substations for a DC system still have to be (typically) about 2 km apart, though the actual spacing depends on the carrying capacity; maximum speed and service frequency of the line. The Docklands Light Railway (DLR) uses a third rail which is tiny in section compared with the usual; thus fewer substations are required.
