25|$|By 1900, a paste made of {{hydrogen}} peroxide and baking soda was recommended {{for use with}} toothbrushes. Pre-mixed toothpastes were first marketed in the 19th century, but did not surpass the popularity of tooth-powder until World War I. In 1880, Doctor Washington Sheffield of New London, CT manufactured toothpaste into a collapsible tube, Dr. Sheffield's Creme <b>Dentifrice.</b> He had the idea after his son traveled to Paris and saw painters using paint from tubes. In York in 1896, Colgate & Company Dental Cream was packaged in collapsible tubes imitating Sheffield. The original collapsible toothpaste tubes were made of lead.|$|E
25|$|Toothpaste is a paste or gel <b>dentifrice</b> {{used with}} a {{toothbrush}} as an accessory to clean and maintain the aesthetics and health of teeth. Toothpaste is used to promote oral hygiene: it serves as an abrasive that aids in removing the dental plaque and food from the teeth, assists in suppressing halitosis, and delivers active ingredients (most commonly fluoride) to help prevent tooth decay (dental caries) and gum disease (gingivitis). Salt and sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) are among materials that can be substituted for commercial toothpaste. Toothpaste {{is not intended to}} be swallowed due to the fluoride content, but is generally not very harmful if accidentally swallowed in small amounts; however, one should seek medical attention after swallowing abnormally large amounts.|$|E

Tobacco use in <b>dentifrices</b> is a terrible scourge which motivates continued use despite its harmful effects. Indian legislation prohibits the use of nicotine in <b>dentifrices.</b> Nicotine is primarily injurious to people because it is responsible for tobacco addiction and is dependence forming. The present study was motivated by an interest in examining the presence of nicotine in these <b>dentifrices.</b> Our earlier report indicates the presence of nicotine in toothpowders. To further curb the menace of tobacco, our team again analysed the toothpowder brands of previous years and in toothpastes as well. Eight brands of commonly used toothpastes and toothpowders were evaluated by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy. On the whole, there are a few successes but much remains to be done. Our findings indicated the presence of nicotine in two brands of dant manjans and four brands of toothpastes. Further our finding underscores the need for stringent regulations by the regulatory authorities for preventing the addition of nicotine in these <b>dentifrices.</b> Hence government policy needs to be targeted towards an effective control of tobacco in these <b>dentifrices</b> and should be properly addressed...|$|R
2500|$|Fluoride {{was first}} added to toothpastes in the 1890s. Tanagra, {{containing}} calcium fluoride as the active ingredient, was sold by Karl F.

40|$|Introduction: Fluoride <b>dentifrices</b> {{containing}} {{calcium carbonate}} have advantages such as control of dental plaque and progression of dental caries, also contributing to oral hygiene, represent most <b>dentifrices</b> marketed in Brazil. Aim: To evaluate the physicochemical properties of seven fluoride <b>dentifrices</b> containing calcium carbonate {{in relation to}} hydrogen potential (pH), loss on drying and calcium concentration. Materials and Methods: Data collection was performed using the potentiometric method for pH ranges, gravimetric analysis for loss on drying and atomic absorption spectrometry for the concentration of calcium ions. All tests were performed in triplicate and the analysis was performed entirely at random according to {{one-way analysis of variance}} at 5 % significance level. Results: The pH values were alkaline and ranged from 8. 67 (Oral-B 123 ®) to 10. 03 (Colgate Mαxima Proteηγo Anticαries®). The results of loss on drying ranged from 33. 81 % (Oral-B 123 ®) to 61. 13 % (Close Up®), with significant differences between brands tested. In relation to the calcium content, the highest and lowest concentrations were found in <b>dentifrices</b> Even® (155. 55 g/kg) and Colgate Ultra Branco® (129 g/kg), respectively, with significant difference (P < 0. 05).

Univ Talca, Cariol Unit, Dept Oral Rehabil, Talca, ChileInternational Journal of Paediatric Dentistry 2013; 23 : 7783 Background. In Chile, no {{information}} is available regarding the soluble fluoride (F) content in the toothpastes commercialized for children and the country's guidelines recommend the use of F in toothpastes in an age-dependent concentration. No global consensus has been reached on this subject. Aim. To determine the soluble F concentration in <b>dentifrices</b> for children sold in Chile and to discuss Chilean guidelines and professional recommendations of use. Design. Three samples of twelve different <b>dentifrices</b> were purchased from drugstores. Toothpastes were analysed in duplicate using an ion-specific electrode. The concentrations of total F (TF) and total soluble F (TSF) were determined (g F/g). Results. Measured TF was consistent with that declared by the manufacturer in eight products. Two <b>dentifrices</b> showed lower TF and two higher F concentrations than declared. A toothpaste, marketed as low-F (450 ppm), showed F concentration threefold higher. Most <b>dentifrices</b> exhibited TSF concentrations similar to the TF content, except one sample that displayed considerably lower TSF than TF. Recommendations on F toothpastes use in children widely vary from country to country. Conclusions.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} the remineralization potential of five <b>dentifrices</b> with different fluoride concentrations. Initial caries lesions were created in 72 cylindrical enamel blocks from deciduous teeth.

Each of the six volunteers carried two deciduous enamel specimens fixed in an intraoral appliance for a period of 4 weeks. They brushed their teeth and the enamel blocks at least two times a day with <b>dentifrices</b> containing 0 ppm (period 1), 250 ppm (period 2), and 500 ppm fluoride (period 3), respectively. A second group of volunteers (n = 6) used <b>dentifrices</b> with a fluoride content of 0 ppm (period 4), 1, 000 ppm (period 5), or 1, 500 ppm (period 6). At the end of the respective period, the mineral content was determined by transversal microradiography (TMR).

40|$|Use of <b>dentifrices</b> {{to prevent}} erosive tooth wear: harmful or helpful?* Abstract: Dental erosion {{is the loss}} of dental hard tissues caused by non-bacterial acids. Due to acid contact, the tooth surface becomes {{softened}} and more prone to abrasion from toothbrushing. <b>Dentifrices</b> containing different active agents may be helpful in allowing rehardening or in in-creasing surface resistance to further acidic or mechanical impacts. How-ever, <b>dentifrices</b> are applied together with brushing and, depending on how and when toothbrushing is performed, as well as the type of den-tifrice and toothbrush used, may increase wear. This review focuses on the potential harmful and helpful effects {{associated with the use of}} denti-frices with regard to erosive wear. While active ingredients like fluorides or agents with special anti-erosive properties were shown to offer some degree of protection against erosion and combined erosion/abrasion, the abrasive effects of <b>dentifrices</b> may increase the surface loss of eroded teeth. However, most evidence to date comes from in vitro and in situ studies, so clinical trials are necessary for a better understanding of the complex interaction of active ingredients and abrasives and their effects on erosive tooth wear...|$|R

40|$|Despite {{a plethora}} of in situ studies and {{clinical}} trials evaluating the efficacy of fluoridated <b>dentifrices</b> on caries control, in vitro pH cycling models are still broadly used because they mimic the dynamics of mineral loss and gain involved in caries formation. This paper critically reviews the current literature on existing pH-cycling models for the in vitro evaluation of the efficacy of fluoridated <b>dentifrices</b> for caries control, focusing on their strengths and limitations. A search was undertaken in the MEDLINE electronic journal database using the keywords "pH-cycling", "demineralization", "remineralization", "in vitro", "fluoride", "dentifrice". The primary outcome was the decrease of demineralization or the increase of remineralization as measured by different methods (e. g. : transverse microradiography) or tooth fluoride uptake. Inclusion of studies, data extraction and quality assessment were undertaken independently and in duplicate by {{two members of the}} review team. Disagreements were solved by discussion and consensus or by a third party. One hundred and sixteen studies were included, of which 42 addressed specifically the comparison of <b>dentifrices</b> using different pH-cycling models. The other studies included meta-analysis or reviews, data about the effect of different fluoride sources on de-remineralization, different methods for analysis de-remineralization and chemical variables and characteristics of dental hard tissues that might have influence on de-remineralization processes. Generally, the studies presented ability to detect known results established by clinical trials, to demonstrate dose-related responses in the fluoride content of the <b>dentifrices,</b> and to provide repeatability and reproducibility between tests. In order to accomplish these features satisfactorily, it is mandatory {{to take into account the}} type of substrate and baseline artificial lesion, as well as the adequate response variables and statistical approaches to be used.
