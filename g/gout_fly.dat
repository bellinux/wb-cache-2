50|$|Chlorops pumilionis is {{a species}} of pest fly from the family Chloropidae. It {{is also known as}} the chloropid <b>gout</b> <b>fly</b> or barley <b>gout</b> <b>fly.</b> It is an oligophagous pest of cereal crops.|$|E
50|$|The <b>gout</b> <b>fly</b> damages 18 {{species of}} {{cultivated}} and wild cereal plants, wheat, barley, rye, oats, timothy grass and couch grass.|$|E

60|$|Though the {{man were}} to die why shouldn't the people dance? Had the Major been dying {{three or four}} miles off, at the hotel at Rufford, there would only {{have been a few}} sad looks, a few shakings of the head, and the people would have danced without any flaw in their gaiety. Had it been known at Rufford Hall that he was lying at that moment in his mortal agony at Aberdeen, an exclamation or two,--"Poor Caneback!"--"poor Major!"--would have been the extent of the wailing, and not the {{pressure}} of a lover's hand would have been lightened, or the note of a fiddle delayed. And nobody in that house really cared much for Caneback. He was not a man worthy of much care. He was possessed of infinite pluck, and now that he was dying could bear it well. But he had loved no one particularly, had been dear to no one in these latter days of his life, had been of very little use in the world, and had done very little more for society than any other horse-trainer! But nevertheless it is a bore when a gentleman dies in your house,--and a worse bore if he dies from an accident than from an illness for which his own body may be supposed to be responsible. Though the <b>gout</b> should <b>fly</b> to a man's stomach in your best bedroom, the idea never strikes you that your burgundy has done it! But here the mare had done the mischief.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{research}} was conducted in Boguchwała in crops of spring wheat, in the years 2006 - 2007, and spring triticale, in the years 2008 - 2009. The aim of the {{research was}} to evaluate susceptibility of different varieties of spring triticale and spring wheat to damage caused by the spring generation of barley <b>gout</b> <b>fly.</b> The experiment was installed with the randomized blocks method in four replications. Analyses covered 9 varieties of spring triticale and 16 varieties of spring wheat. The percentage of plants damaged by barley <b>gout</b> <b>fly</b> larvae was calculated by analysing 100 successive stems in a field. The analyses were conducted when the plants were at the full milk maturity stage. The plant damage was classified using three-step rating scale. In the years of research the spring wheat showed a high degree of damage, i. e, on average 41. 6 % damaged plants, while spring triticale showed on average a low degree, 8. 9 %. Individual varieties of spring triticale and spring wheat showed a different degree of damage by barley <b>gout</b> <b>fly</b> larvae. The least susceptible to damage caused by that pest were wheat varieties: Hewilla, Griva, Żura and Koksa, and spring triticale varieties: Mieszko, Milkaro and Milewo...|$|E
40|$|Achieving high {{baking quality}} and {{sufficient}} yield {{is often a}} challenge in organic wheat production. The impact of sowing date (either autumn or spring) was compared regarding grain yield, baking quality and infestation with chloropid <b>gout</b> <b>fly</b> of seven varieties of spring wheat. The field trial was conducted in 2010, 2012 and 2013 on a sandy loam nearby Freising, Bavaria. Two varieties showed higher grain yield after autumn sowing compared to spring sowing {{in two of the}} three years. But the opposite occurred consequently for two other varieties. The other three varieties showed no consistent reaction. This different reaction may refer in the majority to a different infestation with chloropid <b>gout</b> <b>fly.</b> Additionally, a higher baking quality (protein content, wet gluten content, loaf volume) was analyzed for spring sowing compared to autumn sowing. ...|$|E

[...] Then the servant {{announced}} more visitors, and Lord Chiltern escaped {{out of the room}} before he was seen by the new comers. These were Mrs. Bonteen and Laurence Fitzgibbon, and then Mr. Bonteen,--and after them Mr. Ratler, the Whip, who was in a violent hurry, and did not stay there a moment, and then Barrington Erle and young Lord James Fitz-Howard, the youngest son of the Duke of St. Bungay. In twenty or thirty minutes there was a gathering of liberal political notabilities in Lady Laura's drawing-room. There were two great pieces of news by which they were all enthralled. Mr. Mildmay would not be Prime Minister, and Sir Everard Powell was--dead. Of course nothing quite positive could be known about Mr. Mildmay. He was to be with the Queen at Windsor on the morrow at eleven o'clock, and it was improbable that he would tell his mind to any one before he told it to her Majesty. But there was no doubt that he had engaged [...] "the Duke,"--so he was called by Lord James,--to go down to Windsor with him, that he might be in readiness if wanted. [...] "I have learned that at home," [...] said Lord James, who had just heard the news from his sister, who had heard it from the Duchess. Lord James was delighted with the importance given to him by his father's coming journey. From this, and from other equally well-known circumstances, it was surmised that Mr. Mildmay would decline the task proposed to him. This, nevertheless, was only a surmise,--whereas the fact with reference to Sir Everard was fully substantiated. The <b>gout</b> had <b>flown</b> to his stomach, and he was dead. [...] "By ---- yes; as dead as a herring," [...] said Mr. Ratler, who at that moment, however, was not within hearing of either of the ladies present. And then he rubbed his hands, and looked as though he were delighted. And he was delighted,--not because his old friend Sir Everard was dead, but by the excitement of the tragedy. [...] "Having done so good a deed in his last moments," [...] said Laurence Fitzgibbon, [...] "we may take it for granted that he will go straight to heaven." [...] "I hope there will be no crowner's quest, Ratler," [...] said Mr. Bonteen; [...] "if there is I don't know how you'll get out of it." [...] "I don't see anything in it so horrible," [...] said Mr. Ratler. [...] "If a fellow dies leading his regiment we don't think anything of it. Sir Everard's vote was of more service to his country than anything that a colonel or a captain can do." [...] But nevertheless I think that Mr. Ratler was somewhat in dread of future newspaper paragraphs, should it be found necessary to summon a coroner's inquisition to sit upon poor Sir Everard.|$|R
