50|$|Religious {{beliefs of}} US professors were {{examined}} using a nationally {{representative sample of}} more than 1,400 professors. They found that in the social sciences: 23% {{did not believe in}} God, 16% did not know if <b>God</b> <b>existed,</b> 43% believed <b>God</b> <b>existed,</b> and 16% believed in a higher power. Out of the natural sciences: 20% did not believe in God, 33% did not know if <b>God</b> <b>existed,</b> 44% believed <b>God</b> <b>existed,</b> and 4% believed in a higher power. Overall, out of the whole study: 10% were atheists, 13% were agnostic, 19% believe in a higher power, 4% believe in God some of the time, 17% had doubts but believed in God, 35% believed in God and had no doubts.|$|R

5|$|All {{variations}} of the argument from morality begin with an observation about moral thought or experiences and conclude with the existence of God. Some of these arguments propose moral facts which they claim evident through human experience, arguing that God is the best explanation for these. Other versions describe some end which humans should strive to attain, only possible if <b>God</b> <b>exists.</b>|$|E
5|$|If {{there is}} {{anything}} that humanity cannot produce, the being who produces it is better than humanity. But humanity cannot produce {{the things that are}} in the universe – the heavenly bodies, etc. The being, therefore, who produces them is superior to humanity. But who is there that is superior to humanity, except God? Therefore, <b>God</b> <b>exists.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Irenaean theodicy is a {{response}} to the evidential problem of evil which raises the problem that, if an omnipotent and omnibenevolent (all-powerful and perfectly loving) <b>God</b> <b>exists,</b> there should be no evil in the world. Evidence of evil in the world would make the existence of God improbable. The theodicy attempts to demonstrate that the existence of God remains probable, despite the occurrence of evil.|$|E

5000|$|... "The Hiddenness of God" [...] is {{the claim}} that if <b>God</b> <b>existed,</b> <b>God</b> would have {{prevented}} the world's unbelief by making his existence starkly apparent.

5|$|Being a scientist, {{above all}} else, Huxley {{presented}} agnosticism {{as a form}} of demarcation. A hypothesis with no supporting objective, testable evidence is not an objective, scientific claim. As such, there would be no way to test said hypotheses, leaving the results inconclusive. His agnosticism was not compatible with forming a belief as to the truth, or falsehood, of the claim at hand. Karl Popper would also describe himself as an agnostic. According to philosopher William L. Rowe, in this strict sense, agnosticism is the view that human reason is incapable of providing sufficient rational grounds to justify either the belief that <b>God</b> <b>exists</b> or the belief that God does not exist.|$|E
5|$|On atheism, Sagan commented in 1981: An atheist {{is someone}} who is certain that God does not exist, someone who has {{compelling}} evidence against the existence of God. I know of no such compelling evidence. Because God can be relegated to remote times and places and to ultimate causes, {{we would have to}} know a great deal more about the universe than we do now to be sure that no such <b>God</b> <b>exists.</b> To be certain of the existence of God and to be certain of the nonexistence of God seem to me to be the confident extremes in a subject so riddled with doubt and uncertainty as to inspire very little confidence indeed.|$|E
5|$|Scully goes to Agent Robert Comer, {{whom she}} was forced to shoot after his attempt on William's life, and uses the alien {{artifact}} to heal him. Comer explains that Josepho believes a physical manifestation of <b>God</b> <b>exists</b> inside the spacecraft. According to an ancient prophecy, William is destined to become the savior of humanity, but only if Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) is still alive. If he dies, William will instead lead the Colonists. Comer claims that Mulder was supposedly killed by the cult in order for the aliens to successfully invade; he tried to kill William to prevent him from causing humanity's destruction. Suddenly, a nurse and the Toothpick Man (Alan Dale) arrive and ask Reyes and Scully to leave. Comer ends up alone with the Toothpick Man.|$|E
5000|$|Objection 1: It {{seems that}} God does not exist; because {{if one of}} two {{contraries}} be infinite, the other would be altogether destroyed. But the word [...] "God" [...] means that He is infinite goodness. If, therefore, <b>God</b> <b>existed,</b> {{there would be no}} evil discoverable; but there is evil in the world. Therefore <b>God</b> does not <b>exist.</b>|$|R

5|$|In his Critique of Pure Reason, German philosopher Immanuel Kant {{stated that}} no {{successful}} argument for God's existence arises from reason alone. In his Critique of Practical Reason {{he went on}} to argue that, despite the failure of these arguments, morality requires that God's existence is assumed, owing to practical reason. Rather than proving the existence of God, Kant was attempting to demonstrate that all moral thought requires the assumption that <b>God</b> <b>exists.</b> Kant argued that humans are obliged to bring about the summum bonum: the two central aims of moral virtue and happiness, where happiness arises out of virtue. As ought implies can, Kant argued, it must be possible for the summum bonum to be achieved. He accepted that it is not within the power of humans to bring the summum bonum about, because we cannot ensure that virtue always leads to happiness, so there must be a higher power who has the power to create an afterlife where virtue can be rewarded by happiness.|$|E
5|$|Philosopher Taede Smedes {{argued that}} {{religious}} language is symbolic. Denying any conflict {{between science and}} religion, he proposes that 'to believe' means to accept a conviction (that <b>God</b> <b>exists,</b> {{in the context of}} Christianity), which is different from 'knowing', which only occurs once something is proven. Thus, according to Smedes, we believe things that we do not know for sure. Smedes argues that, rather than being part of the world, God is so far beyond the world {{that there can be no}} common standard to which both God and the world can be compared. He argues that people can still believe in God, even though he cannot be compared to anything in the world, because belief in God is just an alternative way of viewing that world (he likens this to two people viewing a painting differently). Smedes claims that there should be no reason to look for a meaning behind our metaphors and symbols of God because the metaphors are all we have of God. He suggests that we can only talk of God pro nobis (for us) and not in se (as such) or sine nobis (without us). The point, he argues, is not that our concept of God should correspond with reality, but that we can only conceive of God through metaphors.|$|E

2500|$|There are two key {{varieties}} of the argument. [...] The argument from reasonable nonbelief (or the argument from divine hiddenness) was first elaborated in J. L.
