5|$|If Wilde's {{period at}} the helm of the {{magazine}} was a mixed success from an organizational point of view, one can also argue that it played a pivotal role in his development as a writer and facilitated his ascent to fame. Whilst Wilde the journalist supplied articles under the guidance of his editors, Wilde the editor is forced to learn to manipulate the literary marketplace on <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>terms.</b>|$|E
5|$|According to Herodotus, {{both sides}} wished for a decisive battle that would tip {{the war in}} their favor. However, Lazenby {{believed}} that Mardonius' actions during the Plataea campaign were not consistent with an aggressive policy. He interprets the Persian operations during the prelude not as attempts to force the Allies into battle but as attempts to force the Allies into retreat (which indeed became the case). Mardonius may have felt he had little to gain in battle {{and that he could}} simply wait for the Greek alliance to fall apart (as it had nearly done over the winter). There can be little doubt from Herodotus' account that Mardonius was prepared to accept battle on <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>terms,</b> however. Regardless of the exact motives, the initial strategic situation allowed both sides to procrastinate, since food supplies were ample for both armies. Under these conditions, the tactical considerations outweighed the strategic need for action.|$|E
5|$|Flamininus {{replied to}} Nabis by proposing <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>terms,</b> under which Sparta and Rome would {{conclude}} a six-month truce if Nabis would surrender Argos {{with all his}} garrisons from the Argolid; give the coastal Laconian cities autonomy and give them his fleet; pay a war indemnity over {{the next eight years}} and not enter into alliances with any Cretan cities. Nabis rejected this offer, claiming that he had enough supplies to withstand a siege. Flamininus therefore led his force of 50,000 men to Sparta and, after defeating the Spartans in a battle outside the city, began investing the city. Flamininus resolved not to lay a regular siege to the city but to instead try and storm it. The Spartans initially held out against the allies, but their resistance was hampered {{by the fact that the}} Romans' large shields made missile attacks futile.|$|E

50|$|Hansen {{was elected}} to the state {{legislature}} in 1988, representing southeast Boise, and was re-elected in 1990 and 1992. Hansen imposed <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>term</b> limits and voluntarily retired in 1994.|$|R
5000|$|He {{died of a}} {{heart attack}} while {{receiving}} treatment for kidney disease. [...] His oldest son, Neal Foster, was appointed to replace him, and was elected to <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>term</b> in 2010.|$|R
5|$|In 1445, Casimir, the Grand Duke of Lithuania, {{was asked}} to assume the Polish throne vacated upon {{the death of his}} brother Władysław. Casimir was a tough {{negotiator}} and did not accept the Polish nobility's conditions for his election. He finally arrived in Poland and was crowned in 1447 on <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>terms.</b> His assumption of the Crown of Poland freed Casimir from the control that the Lithuanian oligarchy had imposed on him; in the Vilnius Privilege of 1447, he declared the Lithuanian nobility to have equal rights with Polish szlachta. In time, Casimir was able to wrest power from Cardinal Oleśnicki and his group. He replaced their influence with a power base built on the younger middle nobility. Casimir was able to resolve a conflict with the pope and the local Church hierarchy over the right to fill vacant bishop positions in his favor.|$|E
5|$|The Apostles of the Stars launch {{their first}} {{attack on the}} World Summit, killing the leaders from 20 top nations, causing Chronos to declare war on them. Chronos even notify Train of a new Sweeper bounty on Creed {{in order to gain}} his help, though he resists, {{planning}} to go after him on <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>terms.</b> Chronos assassin Jenos Hazard is sent to hire Rinslet to gather information on the Apostles, however, this is really in order to use her as bait to lure Creed out of hiding and force Train to get involved, who was lured to the same area via false Sweeper intel. Jenos and the other two members of the special unit Cerebus launch an assault on Creed's lair, that results in it being turned to rubble, while Train simply rescues Rinslet and leaves. Creed then tries to kill Sven, believing he is holding Train back from joining him, but accidentally shoots Train with a nanomachine-enhanced bullet that has the unplanned effect of reverting his body to that of a child. In order to return Train to normal, Train, Sven and Eve visit nanotechnology expert Dr. Tearju, who is also Eve's creator. While there, the Apostles of the Stars attack to force Tearju to join them in order to grant Creed eternal life through nanomachines, but are defeated by a returned Train who can now fire a railgun shot thanks to the nanomachines. However, Eathes was able to copy Tearju, gaining all of her knowledge, and Train, Sven and Eve finally decide {{to put a stop to}} Creed.|$|E
25|$|Harmison {{announced}} his retirement from all forms of games on 6 October 2013. After not playing even a single test for England in the last 4 years, he officially ended his career on <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>terms</b> from all forms of the game.|$|E
50|$|He served {{again as}} Interim President in 1974 after Pompidou died in office. This time, however, {{he did not}} run for <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>term</b> and stepped down after Valéry Giscard d'Estaing was elected.|$|R
50|$|He has coined <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>term</b> for {{the style}} {{of some of his}} music, which he calls Art Rap. He has also stated that the {{alternative}} rock band, They Might Be Giants, is a major influence.|$|R
50|$|Some authors, {{such as the}} American {{economist}} Richard Florida, {{argue for}} a wider focus on the products of knowledge workers, and judge the 'creative class' (<b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>term)</b> to include nearly all those offering professional knowledge-based services.|$|R
25|$|Profoundly {{affected}} by {{his experience in}} World War I, Crosby vowed to live life on <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>terms</b> and abandoned all pretense of living the expected life of a privileged Bostonian. He had his father's eye for women, and in 1920 met Mrs. Richard Peabody (née Mary Phelps Jacob), six years his senior. They had sex within two weeks, and their open affair {{was the source of}} scandal and gossip among blue-blood Boston.|$|E
25|$|Calling no witnesses, Roark {{addresses}} the court {{on his own}} behalf. He makes a long and eloquent speech defending his right to offer his own work on <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>terms.</b> He is found innocent {{of the charges against}} him. A guilt-stricken Wynand summons the architect to his office. He coldly presents him with a contract to design the Wynand Building, to be the greatest structure of all time, with complete freedom to build it however Roark sees fit. As soon as Roark leaves, Wynand pulls out a pistol from his desk drawer and kills himself.|$|E
25|$|On January 27, 1927, Judge Landis cleared Cobb and Speaker of any {{wrongdoing}} because of Leonard's refusal to appear at the hearings. Landis allowed both Cobb and Speaker {{to return to their}} original teams, but each team let them know that they were free agents and could sign with any club they wanted. Speaker signed with the Washington Senators for 1927, and Cobb with the Philadelphia Athletics. Speaker then joined Cobb in Philadelphia for the 1928 season. Cobb said he had come back only to seek vindication and say he left baseball on <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>terms.</b>|$|E
50|$|Christopher Memminger used Trenholm as an {{unofficial}} adviser throughout <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>term</b> as Secretary of the Treasury. Trenholm {{was appointed to}} that post on July 18, 1864. He was a more charismatic figure than his predecessor, and this helped him with the press and with Congress.|$|R
5|$|There {{was also}} {{speculation}} that the U.S. Senate race, already seen as tight, would be affected. Republican candidate Thomas Kean, Jr. said Democratic Senator Bob Menendez did not oppose Corzine's tax hike because Corzine appointed Menendez to serve out the remainder of <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>term</b> in the Senate.|$|R
50|$|It was {{announced}} that Wilson would receive the appointment on January 13, 2017, {{and that he would}} be seated soon after. On January 25, 2017, Wilson was sworn into to complete the remainder of Jones' term, and will have to seek election to <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>term</b> in 2018.|$|R
25|$|Browne was captaining Barbados {{when he got}} {{his first}} call up to the West Indies side in April 1995. He {{struggled}} to hold his place in the side and after 13 Tests he was dropped and didn't return until 3 years later for the ICC Knockout tournament in Kenya. He was soon dropped again, replaced by Ridley Jacobs. His career seemed over but he got a surprise recall for the 2004 ICC Champions Trophy in England. He was the hero in the final, his partnership with Ian Bradshaw saw them home at The Oval. After a year as first choice keeper he decided this time to leave on <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>terms,</b> retiring for 'personal reasons'.|$|E
25|$|The Allies {{stood still}} between March 4 and 6, {{tracking}} the French manoeuvres {{and trying to}} discern Masséna's intentions with certainty. To Wellington the apparent French retreat was itself a welcome relief, and the general opted to wait out events rather than risk compromising his advantage with precipitous actions against the enemy (nor was Wellington eager to try conclusions with a commander as reputed as Masséna, even an apparently beaten Masséna, unless it were on <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>terms).</b> Unbeknownst to the French, however, several Allied detachments (largely Portuguese recruits) had already seized many positions along the Mondego. Consequently, the Allies did not march until {{the morning of the}} 6th, with Wellington directing a circumspect and cautious pursuit of Ney.|$|E
25|$|Rommel {{attempted}} {{to turn the}} left flank of the Eighth Army at the Battle of Alam el Halfa from 31 August 1942. The German/Italian armoured Corps infantry attack was stopped in very heavy fighting. Rommel's forces had to withdraw urgently lest their retreat through the British minefields be cut off. Montgomery was criticised for not counter-attacking the retreating forces immediately, but he felt strongly that his methodical build-up of British forces was not yet ready. A hasty counter-attack risked ruining his strategy for an offensive on <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>terms</b> in late October, planning for which had begun soon after he took command. He was confirmed in the permanent rank of lieutenant-general in mid October.|$|E
50|$|There {{was also}} {{speculation}} that the U.S. Senate race, already seen as tight, would be affected. Republican candidate Thomas Kean, Jr. said Democratic Senator Bob Menendez did not oppose Corzine's tax hike because Corzine appointed Menendez to serve out the remainder of <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>term</b> in the Senate.|$|R
50|$|Gresser {{was elected}} to <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>term</b> in 1909, but barely six months into this term {{he was accused of}} abusing his office and being incompetent. These charges were brought to the Governor of New York. After a lengthy investigation, Governor John A. Dix removed Gresser from office on September 27, 1911.|$|R
25|$|Simard {{supported}} {{electoral reform}} and proposed that future elections in Quebec be conducted under {{a system of}} compensatory proportional representation. He also encouraged Premier Levesque to shuffle his cabinet and staff in early 1984, arguing that some people {{had been in the}} same positions for too long. <b>His</b> <b>own</b> <b>term</b> as vice-president ended in 1984.|$|R
25|$|Hood made {{a serious}} {{strategic}} error before the battle. On December 2, {{he sent the}} three brigades of William B. Bate's Division of Cheatham's Corps to attack the Nashville & Chattanooga Railroad between Nashville and Murfreesboro {{as well as the}} Federal garrison in the latter city. Three days later, he sent an additional two brigades of infantry and two divisions of cavalry, all under Forrest's command, to reinforce Bate. Hood believed this diversion would draw Thomas out of the Nashville fortifications, allowing Hood to either defeat Thomas in detail or to seize Nashville by a coup de main once its garrison was depleted. While the railroad between Nashville and Murfreesboro was broken in a number of places, the Murfreesboro garrison drove off the Confederates in the Third Battle of Murfreesboro (also called the Battle of the Cedars) on December 7. Furthermore, Thomas was not fooled by this diversion, and remained in his fortifications until he was ready to attack on <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>terms.</b> Bate's Division and one of the two attached infantry brigades returned to Nashville, but Hood had seriously diminished his already outnumbered forces, and he had also deprived his army of its strongest and most mobile unit, Forrest and his cavalry.|$|E
25|$|As {{the son of}} Colley Cibber, one of the theatre's managers, Theophilus became {{involved}} in the management of Drury Lane. In 1723, he became manager of the summer season, and in 1727 became assistant manager during the regular season. In 1732, one of the managers, Barton Booth, sold his share to John Highmore, and another of the managers, Robert Wilks, fell ill and died. Cibber senior became disenchanted by the involvement of Wilks' widow, through her representative John Ellys, in the management of the company. He dropped out of the management and leased his share in the company to his son. Cibber junior took the lead in the management of the theatre during the 1732–33 season, until he fell ill. The actions of Ellys and Highmore in his absence, which appear to have been largely centred on saving or making money, irritated Theophilus and friction grew between them. The other managers approached Cibber senior and offered to buy out his share. Without consulting Theophilus, Colley Cibber sold them his share for 3,000 guineas, and they promptly gave Theophilus his notice. Theophilus led the actors in a walkout and they set themselves up as rival, but informal, company of players in the Haymarket. The Cibbers applied for a letters patent to perform at the Haymarket, but it was refused, and the Drury Lane managers attempted to shut down Cibber by conspiring in the arrest of his leading actor, John Harper, on a charge of vagrancy. Public opinion swung to Theophilus' side, and Harper was released. The Drury Lane managers were defeated, and Theophilus regained control of the company on <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>terms.</b>|$|E
500|$|Penfold's term as high {{commissioner}} expired in April 2000. He requested a British military adviser {{be sent to}} Sierra Leone, {{as well as an}} extension to his own term, both of which were denied. He left the country on 30 April and was succeeded by Alan Jones. After returning to the UK, he applied for multiple posts but was turned down for each. He was asked to take early retirement, but was keen to retire on <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>terms.</b> He eventually {{took a job as a}} conflict adviser to DfID, having developed what he described as [...] "a very good relationship ...|$|E
50|$|He {{returned}} to Ohio in 1807 {{to run for}} governor. He won the election, but was declared ineligible for failing to meet the residency requirements. He then {{was appointed to the}} U.S. Senate to finish the term of John Smith and was re-elected to <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>term</b> a year later. He resigned in late 1810 after winning the governorship.|$|R
5000|$|Broch often criticised the era from 1880 to 1918. He {{found another}} chance {{to do so in}} his book of essays Hofmannsthal and His Time (Hofmannsthal und seine Zeit), criticising fin-de-siecle culture in Vienna which he felt was {{represented}} by kitsch and fussiness. He created <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>term,</b> [...] "the gay apocalypse", to describe this period.|$|R
50|$|In 1943, Mayor William D. Becker {{was killed}} in a glider crash at Lambert Airport in St. Louis. Under the {{provisions}} of the city charter, Kaufmann, as President of the Board of Aldermen, became mayor for the remainder of Becker's term. Kaufmann was elected to <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>term</b> of office in 1945, the last time a Republican has been elected mayor of the city.|$|R
500|$|The {{remaining}} survivors reunite {{and discuss}} {{what to do}} while driving through town. During the discussion Carter learns that he is next on Death's list. Frustrated over having no control over his life, Carter parks his car on railroad tracks, wanting to die on <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>terms.</b> [...] He changes his mind at the last minute; but cannot get out when his seat belt jams. Alex manages to save Carter when his seat belt rips, just before his car is smashed by an oncoming train. As Billy warns the others {{to stay away from}} Carter he is suddenly decapitated by flying shrapnel from the car wreckage.|$|E

50|$|The major {{difference}} between the U.S. and the C.S. Vice Presidencies was that the Confederate term in office was six years long. The President was explicitly forbidden from running {{for a second term}} by the constitution, but the Vice President was not.
