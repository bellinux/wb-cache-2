5|$|Amphibious {{landings}} at Inchon by X Corps hit North Korean {{forces from}} behind, allowing I Corps and IX Corps {{to break out}} of Pusan. Four <b>days</b> <b>later</b> <b>I</b> Corps troops pushed northward against crumbling enemy opposition to establish contact with forces of the 7th Infantry Division driving southward from the beachhead. Major elements of the North Korean Army were destroyed and cut off in this aggressive penetration; the link-up was effected south of Suwon on 26 September. The offensive was continued northwards, past Seoul, and across the 38th Parallel on 1 October. The momentum of the attack was maintained, and the race to the North Korean capitol, Pyongyang, ended on 19 October when elements of the South Korean 1st Infantry Division and U.S. 1st Cavalry Division both entered the city. The advance continued, but against unexpectedly stiffening enemy resistance. On 25 October the first Chinese prisoners on the Eighth Army front were taken by I Corps troops. By the end of October the city of Chongju, forty miles from the Yalu River border of North Korea, had been captured.|$|E

40|$|I was {{wandering}} on {{the streets}} of Siem Reap, well-known for being a base to visit the Angkor temples, trying {{to get a glimpse of}} local life. I suddenly saw a school and a sign saying tourists are welcome to help teachers and kids with English pronunciation. I entered to have a chat with a teacher, and a <b>day</b> <b>later</b> <b>I</b> found myself giving a 2 ̆ 7 class 2 ̆ 7 there. [URL]...|$|R

A few <b>days</b> <b>later,</b> <b>I</b> encountered Haldeman. [...] "What happened to our understanding that my exit would be postponed for a few weeks?" [...] I asked.

2500|$|... "Had it {{not been}} for the Tartars I would not be alive today. They were the nomads of the Crimea, in what was then no man's land between the Russian and German fronts, and favoured neither side. I had already struck up a good {{relationship}} with them, and often wandered off to sit with them. ‘Du nix njemcky’ they would say, ‘du Tartar,’ and try to persuade me to join their clan. Their nomadic ways attracted me of course, although by that time their movements had been restricted. Yet, it was they who discovered me in the snow after the crash, when the German search parties had given up. I was still unconscious then and only came round completely after twelve days or so, and by then I was back in a German field hospital. So the memories I have of that time are images that penetrated my consciousness. The last thing I remember was that it was too late to jump, too late for the parachutes to open. That must have been a couple of seconds before hitting the ground. Luckily I was not strapped in – I always preferred free movement to safety belts… My friend was strapped in and he was atomized on impact – there was almost nothing to be found of him afterwards. But I must have shot through the windscreen as it flew back at the same speed as the plane hit the ground and that saved me, though I had bad skull and jaw injuries. Then the tail flipped over and I was completely buried in the snow. That's how the Tartars found me <b>days</b> <b>later.</b> <b>I</b> remember voices saying ‘Voda’ (Water), then the felt of their tents, and the dense pungent smell of cheese, fat and milk. They covered my body in fat to help it regenerate warmth, and wrapped it in felt as an insulator to keep warmth in." ...|$|E

60|$|A <b>day</b> <b>later</b> <b>I</b> {{received}} a letter from Captain West. The writing and the wording were old-fashioned and formal. He regretted not having yet met me, and assured me that he would see personally that my quarters were made comfortable. For that matter he had already dispatched orders to Mr. Pike, the first mate of the Elsinore, to knock out the partition between my state-room and the spare state-room adjoining. Further--and here is where my dislike for Captain West began--he informed me that if, when once well at sea, I should find myself dissatisfied, he would gladly, in that case, exchange quarters with me.|$|R
60|$|A {{couple of}} <b>days</b> <b>later</b> he started. <b>I</b> had risked the {{conjecture}} that Miss Vernor was a charming creature, {{and six months}} afterwards he wrote me that I was right.|$|R
6000|$|Three <b>days</b> <b>later</b> when <b>I</b> met him on {{the street}} he looked a little shame-faced. [...] "I hoped you'd forgot about that fireplace," [...] he said.

5000|$|Holden recalls their romance: Before I {{even met}} her, I {{had a crush}} on her, and after I met her, just a <b>day</b> <b>later,</b> <b>I</b> felt as if we were old friends, and I was rather {{fiercely}} protective of her, though not in a possessive way. [...] Their relationship did not last much beyond the completion of the film. Holden, who was at this point dependent on alcohol, said, [...] "I really was in love with Audrey, but she wouldn't marry me." [...] Rumors at the time had it that Hepburn wanted a family, but when Holden told her that he'd had a vasectomy and having children was impossible, she moved on. A few months later, Hepburn met Mel Ferrer, whom she would later marry.|$|R

6000|$|This too {{he turned}} over. [...] "Just as a {{consequence}} of your having, at Tishy's, so abruptly and wonderfully tackled the question that a few <b>days</b> <b>later,</b> as <b>I</b> afterwards gathered, was to be crowned with a measure of success not yet exhausted. Why, in other words--if it was to know so little about her and to get no nearer to her--did you bring about Nanda's return?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Good ---! I did {{not speak}} or think of you.

5000|$|Leucothea {{becomes a}} metaphor, in Marcel Proust's In the Shadow of Young Girls in Flower, for the mist that covers a young man's gaze when looking on {{the beauty of}} young women: [...] "...a cloud that had re-formed a few <b>days</b> <b>later,</b> once <b>I</b> had met them, muting the glow of their loveliness, often passing between them and my eyes, which saw them now dimmed, as through a gentle haze, {{reminiscent}} of Virgil's Leucothea." ...|$|R
