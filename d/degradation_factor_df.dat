40|$|Using an onboard sunlit solar {{diffuser}} (SD) as {{the primary}} radiance source, the visible infrared imaging radiometer suite (VIIRS) on the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership satellite regularly performs radiometric calibration of its reflective solar bands (RSBs). The SD bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) value decreases over time. A numerical <b>degradation</b> <b>factor</b> is used to quantify the degradation and is determined by an onboard SD stability monitor (SDSM), which observes {{the sun and the}} sunlit SD at almost the same time. We had shown previously that the BRDF <b>degradation</b> <b>factor</b> was angle-dependent. Consequently, due to that the SDSM and the RSB view the SD at very different angles relative to both the solar and the SD surface normal vectors, directly applying the BRDF <b>degradation</b> <b>factor</b> determined by the SDSM to the VIIRS RSB calibration can result in large systematic errors. We develop a phenomenological model to calculate the BRDF <b>degradation</b> <b>factor</b> for the RSB SD view from the <b>degradation</b> <b>factor</b> for the SDSM SD view. Using the yearly undulations observed in the VIIRS detector gains for the M 1 -M 4 bands calculated with the SD BRDF <b>degradation</b> <b>factor</b> for the SDSM SD view and the difference between the VIIRS detector gains calculated from the SD and the lunar observations, we obtain the model parameter values and thus establish the relation between the BRDF <b>degradation</b> <b>factors</b> for the RSB and the SDSM SD view directions...|$|R

The first <b>degradation</b> <b>factor</b> is chloride-attack corrosion which induces reduction in steel area and concrete cover cracking at characteristic key times (corrosion initiation, severe surface cover cracking).

40|$|To ensure data quality, the Earth-observing Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) on the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership {{satellite}} regularly performs on-orbit radiometric calibration of its 22 spectral bands. The primary radiance {{source for}} the calibration of the VIIRS reflective solar bands (RSBs) is a sunlit onboard solar diffuser (SD). During the calibration process, sunlight goes through a perforated plate (the SD screen) and then strikes the SD. The sunlight, scattered off the SD of near-Lambertian property, {{is used for the}} calibration. Consequently, the spectral radiance of the scattered sunlight is proportional to the product of the SD screen transmittance and the SD bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) value at the observation direction. The BRDF value is decomposed to the product of its initial value at launch and a numerical <b>degradation</b> <b>factor</b> that quantifies the decrease from the initial value. The <b>degradation</b> <b>factor</b> is determined by an onboard SD stability monitor (SDSM). During the BRDF <b>degradation</b> <b>factor</b> determination process, the SDSM receives the SD scattered sunlight and the sunlight that goes through another perforated plate at almost the same time. The ratio of the signal strengths from the two observations is used to determine the BRDF <b>degradation</b> <b>factor.</b> Consequently, the RSB radiometric calibration requires the accurate knowledge of the product of the SD screen transmittance and the initial BRDF value as sensed by the RSB and the SDSM detectors.

40|$|The VoIP {{quality of}} service can be either {{estimated}} by analyzing the voice data flow characteristics, or by recording a transmitted voice probe over the whole VoIP transport chain and comparing it to the original. When the quality estimation by the voice data flow characteristics is deployed, the three most prominent <b>degradation</b> <b>factors</b> are observed – the packet loss, the packet delay and the delay variance (also called jitter). Depending on the estimation model, the values of these <b>degradation</b> <b>factors</b> are used to compute the resulting quality rating estimation. The end-to-end quality measurement provides more dependable results, however, it is also more technically and computationally demanding.

40|$|We {{consider}} a parallel-server system with K homogeneous servers where incoming tasks, arriving at rate λ, are dispatched by n dispatchers. Servers are FCFS queues and dispatchers implement a size-based policy {{such that the}} servers are equally loaded. We compare {{the performance of a}} system with n > 1 dispatchers and of a system with a single dispatcher. Every dispatcher handles a fraction 1 /n of the incoming traffic and balances the load to K/n servers. We show that the performance of a system with n dispatchers, K servers and arrival rate λ coincides with that of a system with one dispatcher, K/n servers and arrival rate λ/n. We define the <b>degradation</b> <b>factor</b> as the ratio between the performance of a system with K servers and arrival rate λ and the performance of a system with K/n servers and arrival rate λ/n. We establish a partial monotonicity on n for the <b>degradation</b> <b>factor</b> and, therefore, the <b>degradation</b> <b>factor</b> is lower-bounded by one. We then investigate the upper-bound of the <b>degradation</b> <b>factor</b> for particular distributions. We consider two continuous service time distributions: uniform and Bounded Pareto that have increasing and decreasing failure rates, respectively; and a discrete distribution with two values, which is the distribution that maximizes the variance for a given mean. We show that the performance degradation is small for uniformly distributed job sizes, but that for Bounded Pareto and two points distributions it can be unbounded. We have investigated the degradation using the distribution obtained from real traces...|$|R
40|$|THE MAIN goal of {{this paper}} is the {{depolarization}} <b>factor</b> (<b>DF)</b> of arbitrarily shaped polarizable inclusion in 2 -D heterostructures. Since analytical calculation of the response of an arbitrary composite material is typically intractable, numerical simulation is the standard method to extract the effective properties of these complex media. For that purpose we use a finite-element (FE) methodology to derive the effective permittivity of the mixed medium. As an illustrative application of this techAn understanding of the polarization characteristics is vital to the rational design of future dielectric nanostructures. In this work, a finite-element methodology has been applied to simulate 2 -D two-phase heterostructures containing a dielectric inclusion with arbitrary shape. The development does not impose any restriction on the shape of the inclusion. Given the paucity of experimental and numerical data, we set out to investigate systematically the trends that shape and permittivity contrast between the inclusion and the host matrix have on the depolarization <b>factor</b> (<b>DF).</b> The effect of the first- versus second-order concentration virial coefficient on the value of the DF is considered for a variety of inclusion shapes and a large set of material properties. Our findings suggest that the DF for a 2 -D inclusion is highly tunable depending on the choice of these parameters. These results can provide a useful insight for the design of artificial two-phase heterostructures with specific polarization properties...|$|R
