25|$|The {{discovery}} in 1911 that electrons emitted in beta decay have a continuous {{rather than a}} <b>discrete</b> <b>spectrum</b> appeared to contradict conservation of energy, under the then-current assumption that beta decay is the simple emission of an electron from a nucleus. This problem was eventually resolved in 1933 by Enrico Fermi who proposed the correct description of beta-decay as the emission of both an electron and an antineutrino, which carries away the apparently missing energy.|$|E
25|$|The energy {{eigenvalues}} {{from this}} equation form a <b>discrete</b> <b>spectrum</b> of values, so mathematically energy must be quantized. More specifically, the energy eigenstates form a basis – any wavefunction may be written as a sum over the discrete energy states or an integral over continuous energy states, or more generally {{as an integral}} over a measure. This is the spectral theorem in mathematics, and in a finite state space {{it is just a}} statement of the completeness of the eigenvectors of a Hermitian matrix.|$|E

Operators with <b>discrete</b> <b>spectra</b> {{are incorporated into}} Bohmian mechanics by associating with each operator a continuous variable in which a finite range of the continuous variable correspond to the same discrete eigenvalue.

500|$|Spectral theory also {{underlies}} {{certain aspects}} of the Fourier transform of a function. Whereas Fourier analysis decomposes a function defined on a compact set into the <b>discrete</b> <b>spectrum</b> of the Laplacian (which corresponds to the vibrations of a violin string or drum), the Fourier transform of a function is the decomposition of a function defined on all of Euclidean space into its components in the continuous spectrum of the Laplacian. The Fourier transformation is also geometrical, in a sense made precise by the Plancherel theorem, that asserts that it is an isometry of one Hilbert space (the [...] "time domain") with another (the [...] "frequency domain"). This isometry property of the Fourier transformation is a recurring theme in abstract harmonic analysis, as evidenced for instance by the Plancherel theorem for spherical functions occurring in noncommutative harmonic analysis.|$|E
