5|$|A merchant, José Ignacio Rezábal, {{attended}} the open cabildo but, {{in a letter}} to the priest Julián S. de Agüero, said that he had some doubts which were shared by other people close to him. He feared that, no matter which party prevailed in the open cabildo, it would take revenge against the other, the Mutiny of Álzaga being a recent precedent. He felt that the open cabildo would lack legitimacy if too many criollos were allowed to take part <b>in</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> a result of the aforementioned manipulation of the guest list.|$|E

5|$|Despite Tchaikovsky's {{disdain for}} public life, he now participated <b>in</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> {{part of his}} {{increasing}} celebrity {{and out of a}} duty he felt to promote Russian music. He helped support his former pupil Sergei Taneyev, who was now director of Moscow Conservatory, by attending student examinations and negotiating the sometimes sensitive relations among various members of the staff. He served as director of the Moscow branch of the Russian Musical Society during the 1889–1890 season. In this post, he invited many international celebrities to conduct, including Johannes Brahms, Antonín Dvořák and Jules Massenet.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though the}} battle of San Lorenzo is {{acknowledged}} in Argentine historiography as an important battle for Argentine independence, it had little military influence in the conflict. Much of the recognition the battle generated is because San Martín fought <b>in</b> <b>it,</b> <b>as</b> {{the size of the}} forces involved and the length of the clash would normally mean it was considered a military engagement rather than a real battle and it did not influence the development of the Argentine War of Independence. This victory did nothing to prevent further raids from royalist ships as there were new raids at Tigre on August 18, 1813 and yet another one at San Fernando on August 22. William Brown ended the royalist naval supremacy the following year.|$|E
5|$|Franken and Tom Davis were {{recruited}} {{as two of}} the original writers (and occasional performers) on Saturday Night Live (SNL) (1975–1980, 1985–1995). In Season 1 of SNL, as apprentice writers, the two shared a salary of $350 per week. Franken received seven Emmy nominations and three awards for his television writing and producing while creating such characters as self-help guru Stuart Smalley. Another routine proclaimed the 1980s the Al Franken Decade. Franken and Davis wrote the script of the 1986 comedy film One More Saturday Night, appearing <b>in</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> rock singers in a band called Bad Mouth. They also appeared in minor roles in All You Need Is Cash and in the Eddie Murphy and Dan Aykroyd film Trading Places.|$|E

First time around I never had the time (meaning the funds) to do a second draft, and this, finally, is it. With forty years to think about it, a few little changes were inevitable – plus one new character in a totally new very spooky scene. This is the version I {{would like to be}} remembered for. Tor/Forge have also re-published The Ninth Configuration and Legion, with new, updated cover artwork.|$|E
5|$|Madonna faced {{a lawsuit}} in 2004 over an image in the book. Titled Amarak Productions, Inc. vs. Morton, Madonna's former {{bodyguard}} and ex-lover Jim Albright brought a defamation case against Morton, based on an incorrect photo caption. The photo had a caption identifying the subject <b>in</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> Albright; it was actually one of Madonna's homosexual back-up dancers, Jose Gutierez. Amarak Productions, Inc. had employed Albright as Madonna's bodyguard in 1992, and he became romantically involved with her. While writing Madonna, Morton contacted Albright to gather information on their relationship. On discovering the misleading image, the lawsuit was filed by Albright who objected to the caption.|$|E

He {{studied at}} Colegio Grande de San Carlos, but without living <b>in</b> <b>it,</b> <b>as</b> his family could not afford the price. He graduated with an honor diploma. He met influential people within the literary field, who helped him to continue his studies at the University of Chuquisaca, even when his father could not afford the cost. This was the only big university in South America at the time. He studied the books of Montesquieu, Voltaire, Denis Diderot, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and other European philosophers of the Age of Enlightenment. He studied English and French languages as well, to understand authors from Britain and France. This allowed him to work as a translator, and he spent several years working with Rousseau's The Social Contract. Moreno was convinced that society could be changed by the power of intelligence and reason.|$|E
5|$|San Martín made a {{new request}} for ships to Bowles, but {{received}} no answer. He moved again to Buenos Aires, to make a similar request. He arrived to Mendoza {{a few days after}} the execution of the Chileans Luis and Juan José Carrera, brothers of José Miguel Carrera. The specific initiative of those executions is controversial. Chilean historian Vicuña Mackenna indicts San Martín, while J. C. Raffo de la Reta blames O'Higgins instead. Manuel Rodríguez was also imprisoned and then killed in prison; this death may have been decided by the Lautaro lodge. San Martín could not have taken part <b>in</b> <b>it,</b> <b>as</b> he was already on the way to Buenos Aires.|$|E

5|$|A {{declaration}} is only {{as effective}} as the willingness of a public body to abide by the court's statement of the law <b>in</b> <b>it,</b> <b>as</b> it is not a contempt of court to ignore a declaration. In Webster v. Southwark London Borough Council (1982), Webster was a parliamentary candidate for the National Front, a far right racial nationalist political party, who wanted to hold an election meeting in a hall owned by Southwark London Borough Council. Despite being required by provisions of the Representation of the People Act 1949 to permit Webster to use the hall, the local council refused to do so as it did not agree with Webster's political views. The court made a declaration that Webster was legally entitled to use the hall at a certain time for the purpose of his election campaign, {{on the assumption that the}} local council would obey it. Nonetheless, the local council still refused to allow Webster use of the hall. It was held that a declaration is not a coercive order of the court and, accordingly, refusal to comply with it is not contempt.|$|E
5|$|Ampelosaurus {{seems to}} {{have grown in a}} way similar to more basal sauropods. After a certain point in its development, the {{microscopic}} material of the bone became very different from more basal Sauropoda. Ampelosaurus grew more slowly once the bone microstructure became unique among sauropods. Although Diplodocoidea and basal Macronaria also show an increase in bone growth and a decrease in growth rate around the presumed onset of sexual maturity, it is much more gradual than Ampelosaurus. The process of growing, which in other sauropods started around sexual maturity, was clearly delayed in Ampelosaurus. The period of growth after sexual maturity seems to be shortened in Ampelosaurus and is dominated by slow bone building instead of fast growth. Growth marks are generally rare in sauropods or appearing only late in ontogeny, if at all. The lack of growth marks is suggestive of fast and continuous growth in sauropods, which supports the hypothesis that they achieved large body size through because of fast growth. Ampelosaurus does not show growth marks on any bone sample. This is unusual to be found with the apparently reduced growth rate and high level of bone growth seen <b>in</b> <b>it,</b> <b>as</b> those features are often associated with the occurrence of growth marks.|$|E
5|$|Aston first gained {{full-time}} employment in 1970, {{working as a}} field officer at the Oxford City and County Museum in Oxfordshire. For a time living in a tent, {{he worked on the}} sites and monuments record and taught several extramural classes while based at the museum. This extramural teaching fitted closely with Aston's staunch belief that archaeology should be open to all who were interested <b>in</b> <b>it.</b> <b>As</b> part of this devotion to public outreach, he presented a radio series on archaeology that was broadcast on Radio Oxford. In 1974 he moved to Taunton to become the first County Archaeologist for Somerset, where he set up a new site record and oversaw the excavation of sites revealed by the construction of the M5 motorway. Again he also taught extramural adult education classes, this time for the University of Bristol. It was here that he developed a passion for aerial archaeology, and would often charter private planes in order to undertake aerial photography. Becoming a pioneer of landscape archaeology, along with Trevor Rowley he was responsible for coining the term in their 1974 book, Landscape Archaeology. With archaeologist James Bond he authored The Landscape of Towns (1976), in which he extended his use of landscape archaeology to urban areas. Recognising his contribution to the discipline, in 1976, he was elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London.|$|E

5|$|Willkie {{spent much}} of 1943 {{preparing}} for a second presidential run, addressing Republican and nonpartisan groups. He did not meet with Roosevelt; with the presidential election approaching and with both men likely to run <b>in</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> candidates, their continued association would have been awkward. Although they differed with him on many issues, Republican leaders recognized Willkie's appeal and they had wanted him to campaign for the party in the 1942 midterm elections, but he went around the world instead. The huge publicity received by the titular head of the Republican Party as an emissary for a Democratic president frustrated leading Republicans. In spite of this, the Republicans gained seats in both the House and the Senate, though they still remained in the minority. Few Republican members of Congress were by then willing to support Willkie, and he dropped to second place behind General Douglas MacArthur in polls of likely voters in the party's 1944 presidential primaries. By 1943, even liberal Democrats did not doubt Willkie's progressive credentials. He spoke of appointing an African American to either the cabinet or the Supreme Court, and he warned California's Republican committee that the New Deal was irreversible and he stated that all they would get by opposing it was oblivion.|$|E
