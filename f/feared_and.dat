5|$|Despite these {{frightening}} character traits, however, Edward's contemporaries {{considered him}} an able, even an ideal, king. Though not loved by his subjects, he was <b>feared</b> <b>and</b> respected. He met contemporary expectations of kingship {{in his role}} as an able, determined soldier and in his embodiment of shared chivalric ideals. In religious observance he also fulfilled the expectations of his age: he attended chapel regularly and gave alms generously.|$|E

Some slaves of wealthy {{families}} lived better than commoners since {{they were allowed to}} wear luxurious clothes and consume quality food and wine. Slaves of high officials could even be <b>feared</b> <b>and</b> respected. The slaves of regent Huo Guang (d. 68 BCE) sometimes came armed to the marketplace and fought commoners, forced the Imperial Secretary to kowtow and apologize (after a scuffle with his slaves over the right-of-way on the street), and were provided services by some officials who sought a promotion through Huo Guang's influence.|$|E

There were other means of ingress, but they would have required an invading force to be resupplied through difficult and hostile country.

5|$|A {{few days}} later, the Harwich Force sortied {{on the night}} of 23–24 October in {{response}} to the German transfer of two flotillas of torpedo boats to Zeebrugge, in occupied Belgium, but failed to make contact with the German ships. The Admiralty ordered Tyrwhitt to detach Carysfort and four destroyers to reinforce Vice-Admiral Reginald Bacon's Dover Patrol as they feared that the transfer was in preparation for a concerted attack on the shipping protected by the latter. Three nights later, the newly arrived German destroyers did exactly what the Admiralty <b>feared</b> <b>and</b> attacked. Carysfort played no role in the resulting action, but was kept in reserve and helped to search for damaged vessels the following morning. German destroyers made another attack {{on the night of}} 20/21 April 1917 and were driven off, losing two destroyers, without the cruiser's intervention.|$|E

Young, whom Emma <b>feared</b> <b>and</b> despised, was {{suspicious}} of her desire to preserve the family's assets from inclusion {{with those of the}} church, and thought she would be even more troublesome because she openly opposed plural marriage. When most Latter Day Saints moved west, she stayed in Nauvoo, married a non-Mormon, Major Lewis C. Bidamon, and withdrew from religion until 1860, when she affiliated with the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, first headed by her son, Joseph Smith III. Emma never denied Smith's prophetic gift or repudiated her belief in the authenticity of the Book of Mormon.|$|E

5|$|Geneforge 2 is a {{role-playing}} {{game where}} the player's choice of answers during conversations with non-player characters affects how the player is regarded amongst the game's four factions. The player character is an apprentice Shaper, a <b>feared</b> <b>and</b> secretive group who can create life. Players create a character {{from one of}} three character classes and explore the area surrounding Drypeak, a failing Shaper colony, solving quests and gaining experience. Each of the three character classes has a particular playing style and can approach tasks in different ways. Guardians are fighters who excel in standard combat skills, especially hand-to-hand fighting. They are capable of shaping creations, but have little affinity for magic. Agents are the game's version of rogues, and excel in spell casting and are capable of hand-to-hand combat. The Shaper is a summoner, capable of creating living creatures by using their own life essence. Shapers rely on their creations for protection. Players can also convince certain non-player characters to join them.|$|E

Leslie, who is growing increasingly annoyed with the Venezuelans, decides to take them to Pawnee's nicest park with hopes of impressing them.

Leslie later takes them to a public meeting to show them democracy in action, but all of the citizens shout angry and annoyed questions at Leslie. An unimpressed Raul wonders where are the armed guards to take the protestors to jail. When Raul tells Leslie they live like kings in Venezuela and answer to nobody, she explodes in anger, insulting their uniforms and Hugo Chavez. The Venezuelans storm out.|$|E

40|$|This bachelor´s {{thesis is}} focused on women´s {{experience}} of <b>fear</b> <b>and</b> anxiety during the childbirth. It combines both theoretical and empirical aspects of the topic. The theoretical part summarizes history of midwifery and history of psychoprophylaxis, defines the childbirth, describes physical and mental condition and changes in women during various stages of labour. The following chapter provides general characteristics of <b>fear</b> <b>and</b> anxiety, their signs and consequencies. The next part contains description of reasons, potential manifestations and effects of experiencing <b>fear</b> <b>and</b> anxiety during pregnancy and their possible impact on the childbirth. It {{is followed by a}} chapter dealing with prevention of, <b>and</b> solutions to <b>fear</b> <b>and</b> anxiety during the childbirth. The theoretical part also deals with various personalities of women in labour and opportunities to choose between different types of childbirth. The final chapter of the theoretical part summarizes specifics of midwife tasks in the delivery room. The research part of the bachelor´s thesis concentrates on finding out what is the extent of women´s experience of <b>fear</b> <b>and</b> anxiety in labour and what reasons they indicate as reasons of their <b>fear</b> <b>and</b> anxiety. We tried to establish whether there are any dependencies in experiencing the <b>fear</b> <b>and</b> anxiety by women in labour and whether it is possible to assess in advance which women will experience more <b>fear</b> <b>and</b> anxiety in labour. We attempted to identify what can help women in labour to overcome or be relieved of their feeling of <b>fear</b> <b>and</b> anxiety, and thus, whether or not such feeling can be prevented or at least alleviated. We were also detecting how the women in labour get their information of pregnancy and which information they consider the most beneficial.
