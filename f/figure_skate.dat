2500|$|Blades {{are about}} 3/16inch (...) thick. When {{viewed from the}} side, the blade of a <b>figure</b> <b>skate</b> is not flat, but curved slightly, forming an {{arc of a circle}} with a radius of [...] This {{curvature}} {{is referred to as the}} rocker of the blade. The sweet spot of the blade is below the ball of the foot. This spot is usually located near the stanchion of the blade, and is the part of the blade where all spins are spun on. The blade is also hollow ground; a groove on the bottom of the blade creates two distinct edges, inside and outside. The inside edge of the blade is on the side closest to the skater; the outside edge of the blade is on the side farthest from the skater. In figure skating, it is always desirable to skate on only one edge of the blade. Skating on both at the same time (which is referred to as a flat) may result in lower skating skills scores. The apparently effortless power and glide across the ice exhibited by elite figure skaters fundamentally derives from efficient use of the edges to generate speed.|$|E
