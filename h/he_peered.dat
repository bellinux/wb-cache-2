5|$|Braham flew in {{the first}} wave. As Braham's wave reached Leeuwarden in the Netherlands and while {{four of the five}} RAF fighters made no contact, Braham {{attracted}} two enemy night fighters. The Messerschmitt Bf 110s were from IV./Nachtjagdgeschwader 1 (Night Fighter Wing 1). Five had taken off under the command of Heinz-Wolfgang Schnaufer—who finished the war as the most successful night fighter of all time with 121 air victories. Schnaufer led his flight out toward the echo but turned back himself after engine trouble. Using his Serrate radar detector, Braham and his radar operator picked up the emissions made by the German fighters' Lichtenstein radar. He gained on and shot down Feldwebel Georg Kraft, an Experten with 15 air victories from 4./NJG 1. Kraft was killed. Another Bf 110 had witnessed the action and attempted to engage Braham but was outmanoeuvred and dispatched also. Its pilot, Feldwebel Heinz Vinke was the only member of his crew to survive. Braham considered shooting at one crew member, likely Vinke, who he had seen parachute out of the aircraft, but Bill Gregory persuaded him not to. Braham's Beaufighter was nearly struck by debris from the last victim. Braham had a habit of opening fire at very close range and the resulting disintegration of the Messerschmitt hurled debris at the closely following Beaufighter. One reason for firing at close-range was Braham's high state of fatigue. In such a state Braham could barely keep his eyes open. Whenever <b>he</b> <b>peered</b> ahead they smarted and misted.|$|E
2500|$|In the stanza that follows, Odin {{describes}} {{how he had}} no food nor drink there, that <b>he</b> <b>peered</b> downward, and that [...] "I took up the runes, screaming I took them, then I fell back from there." [...] While Yggdrasil is not mentioned by name in the poem and other trees exist in Norse mythology, the tree is near universally accepted as Yggdrasil, and if the tree is Yggdrasil, then the name Yggdrasil directly relates to this story.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>peered</b> at me, {{and then}} at Falcone, and he swore in some surprise.|$|E
6000|$|... "Dead?" [...] shrieks Amyas. [...] "Look for him, for God's sake, look!" [...] and {{struggling}} {{from under his}} living load, <b>he</b> <b>peers</b> into each pale and bleeding face.|$|R

60|$|The old {{man said}} nothing, but <b>he</b> <b>peered</b> through the {{darkness}} with eager, straining eyes.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Cannot ate it?' {{repeated}} <b>he,</b> <b>peering</b> in Linton's face, and subduing {{his voice}} to a whisper, {{for fear of being}} overheard.

60|$|Suddenly they hushed their {{noise and}} ceased their capering. They shrank down in fear, and quested anxiously about {{with their eyes}} for a way of retreat. Then Red-Eye walked in among them. They cowered away from him. All were frightened. But he {{made no attempt to}} hurt them. He was one of them. At his heels, on stringy bended legs, {{supporting}} herself with knuckles to the ground on either side, walked an old female of the Tree People, his latest wife. He sat down {{in the midst of the}} circle. I can see him now, as I write this, scowling, his eyes inflamed, as <b>he</b> <b>peers</b> about him at the circle of the Tree People. And as <b>he</b> <b>peers</b> <b>he</b> crooks one monstrous leg and with his gnarly toes scratches himself on the stomach. He is Red-Eye, the atavism.|$|R
