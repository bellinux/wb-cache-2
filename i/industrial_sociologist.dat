5000|$|While at Berkeley, Collins {{encountered}} many influential sociologists of his day. He {{worked with}} Joseph Ben-David, an Israeli sociologist visiting from Hebrew University, on {{the sociology of}} science, which ultimately lead to Collins' publication The Sociology of Philosophies decades later. Collins was introduced to Weberian conflict theory through Reinhard Bendix, a leading Max Weber scholar. Of his early career, Collins would later say [...] "I {{was part of the}} generation of young sociologists who broke with functionalist theory and moved toward conflict theory." [...] He later wrote a chapter for Bendix's work State and Society. This work enabled Collins to later combine this theory with Erving Goffman's microsociology, which resulted in Collins' publication Conflict Sociology in 1975 and later, Interaction Ritual Chains in 2004. Goffman was also one of Collins' professors during his time at Berkely. Collins' dissertation advisor was organizational and <b>industrial</b> <b>sociologist</b> Harold Wilensky. It was titled Education and Employment: Some Determinants of Requirements for Hiring in Various Types of Organizations, and it was later published in 1979 as The Credential society: a historical sociology of education and stratification. While at Berkeley Collins also worked with Herbert Blumer, Philip Selznick, and Leo Lowenthal.|$|E

40|$|The thesis {{considers}} {{the argument that}} <b>industrial</b> <b>sociologists</b> have acted as "servants of power". In order to examine this, the diffusion and use of a specific idea - autonomous work groups - was investigated. On examining the origin and potentials of the concept, {{it was concluded that}} the idea of autonomous work groups was potentially radical for the organisation of work. Much attention was found to have been devoted to the autonomous work group in publications, but the notion tended to be de-radicalised. The ways in which this (and similar ideas) reach managers in industry were examined through the activities of 'linkers' - journalists, information-giving organisations, consultants (both academic and commercial), industrial training boards and authors. The mechanics and factors influencing the diffusion of ideas to industry were examined through the study of a specific industry: brewing. It was found that managers neither highly rated, nor actively sought, ideas emanating from industrial sociologists; indeed, they were often antagonistic. Academics were seldom found to have any obvious role in the diffusion of industrial sociology to those in industry. <b>Industrial</b> <b>sociologists</b> are not 'servants of power': the notion is both too simplistic and naive. It is in the nature of our society that the presentation of ideas enhances the existing social order...|$|R
40|$|Could Melville Dalton {{get a job}} in a {{business}} school today? How would his study of managerial work be funded? Would his research be published? Would he remain on the margins of the business school or become an accepted and respected management researcher? This chapter considers the case of Melville Dalton, the Chicago School-trained <b>industrial</b> <b>sociologist</b> whose classic study of informal organization and unOfficial rewards, Men Who Manage (1959), was published over 50 years ago. It begins with a summary of Dalton's career and examines the origins and nature of his commitment to qualitative organizational research. The chapter then speculates as to how Dalton would be regarded as a management researcher today. To this end it explores how he might experience the culture of performativity within academia and considers the likely impact of these expectations and demands on his research career. It is concluded that ethnographic studies like Dalton's are, in the current context, less likely to be conducted or published. The chapter concludes by raising important questions concerning the changing nature {{of what it means to}} be a management researcher...|$|E
40|$|In 1973 Ronald Dore, to wide {{academic}} acclaim, {{published his}} {{comparative study of}} British and Japanese factory life, British Factory-Japanese Factory (Dore, 1973). Although Thorstein Veblen had hinted at and anticipated Dore's thesis as early as 1915 (Cole, 1978), the argument Dore put forward {{was at the time}} a radical one. He theorised that, because of what he called the 'late-development effect', Japan had been able in some measure to leap ahead of the United Kingdom into a more advanced or more modern form of industrial organisation upon which henceforth the UK would converge. A key aspect of this ability to leap ahead, Dore claimed, was the development of the so-called lifetime employment system, which, according to his theory, had come into being precisely as a result of Japan's late development. Hitherto, western observers such as James Abegglen, who in 1958 had been the first western <b>industrial</b> <b>sociologist</b> to describe the lifetime employment system in detail to the west, had assumed that, because of its assumed roots in Japanese pre-modern culture and tradition, the system possessed rigidities and inefficiencies which would cause Japan eventually to converge on the Anglo-Saxon economies and, in particular, the United States. The implications of Dore's work, therefore, were profound...|$|E
40|$|Starting {{from the}} {{reorganisation}} of large companies, the organisation of industrial value chains has been undergoing a tremendous change {{during the last}} years. Some Buzzwords in this context are: strategic decentralisation, outsourcing, value chain reengineering. While the reorganisation of single companies {{is not in the}} focus of my interests, what is very interesting to me is the question if patterns of reorganisation can be recognized. If many companies change their organisation in the same way and if these changes do not remain company-internal but influence inter-company relations and the structure of whole industries, it would mean that a substantial change is happening. From my point of view as an <b>industrial</b> <b>sociologist,</b> this would be a most interesting development, arousing a lot of new questions. And one of these questions is what effects these changing forms of industrial governance will have on industrial relations. The paper on hand looks into these questions. First, I am going to introduce the theory of "industrial governance" and the thesis that already two competing paradigms of industrial governance can be found. The second paragraph deals with my concrete subject of interest: operator models as a special form of company co-operation that is of current interest. Afterwards I am going to present some hypotheses on the possible consequences of the spread of operator models for industrial relations in Germany. Finally, I will try to connect these two strands, stressing the importance of research into the correlation between economic strategy and industrial relations...|$|E

40|$|Job {{enrichment}} {{has been}} the domain of individual <b>industrial</b> <b>sociologists</b> and psychologists who {{have worked hard to}} improve the design of industrial jobs. It has been assumed that the happy worker is a productive worker and that the new participation and enrichment schemes would continue to bring about increased productivity. In this book the author addresses job enrichment as an economist, though he is a strong advocate of a multi-disciplinary approach. He provides a historical summary of the problems involved in job design and then analyses three areas of experiment in order to develop a methodology for measuring the economic costs of changes in the work structure. To effect such changes it is essential to prove that improvement of social performance in companies and organizations is compatible with growth in economic performance and this requires a new form of accounting. First the author analyses factories when are attempting to soften the consequences of job fragmentation and production line work. Then he investigates the impact of computerization on banks and the growth of an over-qualified white-collar workforce. Finally he discusses the case of a company which is attempting to involve its workers in determining their own working conditions. Students and teachers of industrial economics, sociology and psychology, as well as managers, will find this book full of useful insight...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{years have}} seen a burgeoning {{interest}} {{in the study of}} organizational justice. Em-ployee perceptions of distributive, procedural, and interactional justice have been related to a variety of important work outcomes, such as performance, citizenship behaviors, and job attitudes. Despite the health and vigor of justice research, the rapid growth of this literature has made salient a variety of new issues. In the present paper, we discuss these concerns as three questions: How do workers formulate appraisals of justice?; Why do individuals do so?; and What precisely is being appraised? Each of these three questions provides a frame-work for reviewing the current state of our knowledge, proposing new research paradigms, and providing directions for future inquiry. C ° 2001 Academic Press There are many academic disciplines devoted to the study of organizations. Each field presents the workplace through the prism of its own values. Economists, among others, remind us that work organizations are built from the accumulation of wealth. Capital is necessary to hire personnel, purchase raw materials, invest in new technologies, and so forth. <b>Industrial</b> <b>sociologists,</b> on the other hand, often em-phasize the role of social power in organizational life. For instance, Pfeffer (1981) saw the utilization and flow of power as a systematic attribute of organizational life, and Robbins (1990, Chapter 9) {{went so far as to}} diagram whole organiza-tions in terms of a “power cone. ” At the bottom of the cone are the low power Address correspondence and reprint requests to Russell Cropanzano, Department of Psychology...|$|R
40|$|About the book: Call centres are a {{new type}} of service work that stand at the {{interface}} between corporations and consumers. They exemplify more general tendencies present within service work. They also have a particular public image – being associated in the public mind with low skilled and regimented work. This book presents contributions from British and German management academics and <b>industrial</b> <b>sociologists</b> based on primary research on call centres in both countries. The contributions cover the genesis and development of call centres as a new form of organization, or indeed a new industry; the rationalization and control strategies of organizations that establish call centres; and the nature of service work and service interactions. The findings of this volume challenge the common public image of call centres and finds that call centre employment is in fact very diverse. So, for example, skilled advising and consulting services are often performed over the phone. Along with the sometimes-skilled nature of call centre work, work organization and working conditions vary as well. The book also seeks to contrast the British and German experience of call centre work and employment. In Germany clerical work has traditionally been embedded in the specific traditions of co-operative industrial relations that define the German model. Call centres present a strategic challenge to this model, and the expansion of call centres has {{been at the forefront of}} changes aimed at making employment more flexible in Germany. A strength of the book is the choice of country cases, which permit a comparison of service employment within both a liberal capitalist and a socially embedded economy...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present paper is to {{systematically}} analyze the relationship between organizations in the private sector of our economy and the organizational structures of academic departments of sociology. We will be addressing ourselves not to a detailed analysis of either organization but to the relationships between them. The interest of <b>sociologists,</b> particularly <b>industrial</b> <b>sociologists,</b> and the needs of private organizations, particularly large scale manufacturing concerns e. g., Westinghouse, are of such a nature that in many instances relationships between the two organizational structures referred to often become structured in and of themselves. In this paper we are going to concern ourselves with the nature of these structured relationships, i, e., the relationships between some manufacturing concerns and academic departments of sociology. In addition vie are going to give considerable attention to the impact these relationships do or might have on the internal structures, and external relationships of both academic departments of sociology and industrial concerns. Due to limited time and non-existing funds the most fruitful procedure {{is believed to be the}} building of a model or system of classification that is capable of generating testable hypothesis. This, of course, limits the degree of sophistication, but it is hoped that this lack of sophistication does not diminish the value of this attempt as a necessary first step. Specifically, in this paper the writer will attempt to develop a system of classification which will encompass the vast variety of behaviors which result from real or felt threats to the structure and/or functions of an organization. The specific concern of this paper is with two particular types of organizations. It is felt, however, that with slight modification the classification system could be extended to a wide variety of organizations. Thesis (M. A. ...|$|R

40|$|Die Kulturberufe gehören zu den seit Jahren expandierenden Wissensberufen und nehmen im bundesdeutschen Erwerbssystem in verschiedener Hinsicht eine Sonderstellung ein. So werden sie häufig in der Form des "Alleindienstleisters" ausgeübt und weisen hohe Frauenanteile und Akademisierungsgrade auf. Von daher sind sie für die Frage nach "zukunftsfähigen" Formen von Erwerbsarbeit für beide Geschlechter besonders interessant. Das Papier stellt zunächst in erwerbssoziologischer Perspektive Charakteristika der Kulturberufe in Abgrenzung zu den beiden dominanten Erwerbstypen - den "klassischen" Professionen und dem "verberuflichten Arbeitnehmer" - wie auch zu den traditionell feminisierten sog. Semi-Professionen dar. Gefragt wird weiter nach theoretischen Erklärungsansätzen für diesen vergleichsweise jungen Erwerbstypus. Dabei erscheint weniger die Professionstheorie als vielmehr das arbeitssoziologische Konzept des "Arbeitskraftunternehmers" weiterführend, insofern es in subjektorientierter Perspektive Grenzverschiebungen zwischen Arbeit und Leben Rechnung trägt. In einem weiteren Schritt werden erste empirische Ergebnisse zur sozialstrukturellen Verfassung der Kulturberufe präsentiert, die ambivalente Deutungen nahe legen. So scheint einerseits Erwerbsarbeit in den Kulturberufen weniger durch Geschlechterstereotype geprägt zu sein als in den erwähnten anderen Erwerbstypen. Andererseits jedoch deuten die zu vermutenden Arrangements von Arbeit und Leben nicht unbedingt auf egalitäre Muster hin. Abschließend wird weiterer Forschungsbedarf thematisiert. Cultural professions {{belong to}} the {{expanding}} knowledge&# 8722;based occupations and for several reasons take a special position in the German employment system. Thus they are often practised in single person self&# 8722;employment, and, moreover, show an increasingly academic work force and high shares of female professionals. Hence {{they seem to be}} promising with respect to ’sustainable’ forms of employment for both genders. In a sociological perspective, this paper firstly describes the characteristics of cultural professions in contrast to the two at least in German predominating types of work &# 8722; the ’classical’ professions and the ’standard employment relationship’ &# 8722; as well as the traditionally feminized so&# 8722;called ’semi&# 8722;professions’. Secondly, we discuss explanatory theoretical concepts for this comparatively young type of work. Here the theories of professions seem to be less fruitful than the quite recent concept of ’entrepreneur of one’s own labour force’ (’Arbeitskraftunternehmer’) that has primarily been developed by two German <b>industrial</b> <b>sociologists</b> (Voß/Pongratz 1998). This theoretical model pursues a perspective oriented by the individual subject which implies taking account of the shifting borders between work and life. Moreover, first empirical results are presented with regard to the social&# 8722;structural constitution of cultural professions which suggest ambiguous interpretations. On the one hand, work in cultural occupations seems to be less gender&# 8722; segregated than the other mentioned types of employment. On the other hand, the expected work and life arrangements do not necessarily indicate egalitarian patterns. Finally, the needs of further research are expressed...|$|R
40|$|With {{the rise}} of the new social {{movements}} and increasing number of protests over service delivery in South Africa’s poorest townships, many activists have started to question whether unions are able to relate {{to the demands of the}} unorganised and poor. It is argued that under the new democracy COSATU has become bureaucratic and is too closely aligned to the ANC to challenge government policies and play a transformative role in society. Such concerns are not entirely new. Labour historians and <b>industrial</b> <b>sociologists</b> have long debated the political potential and democratic character of trade unions and there is a vast literature documenting the organisational styles of unions in South Africa today and in the past. Based on examination of union archival records and interviews with key informants, this study traces the emergence of the ‘workers control’ tradition in South African trade unions. ‘Workers control’ is a unique approach based on non-racial, industrial trade unions, which are democratically organised on the factory floor. Such unions, which are ideally controlled by elected worker representatives at all levels and united nationally on the basis of sharing common policies and resources, create the basis for an autonomous movement that promotes the interest of workers. Although most closely associated with FOSATU (1979 - 1985), this study found that workers control had deeper historical roots. Workers control was a product of the ideological and organisational renewal that characterised the 1970 s and was initially created by the Trade Union Advisory Coordinating Committee (TUACC) in Natal and, later, the Witwatersrand. TUACC, which included significant numbers of women employed as semi-skilled production workers and unskilled migrant men, reflected complex shifts in the labour market and the economy. It was in this context that ordinary union members together with a diverse layer of activists developed TUACC’s unique approach to organisation. The power of white university trained activists in determining union policies has been overestimated and worker leaders, particularly more educated women workers, played an important role in building TUACC unions. Based on a Gramscian analysis, TUACC maintained that democratic unions based on strong shop floor organisation could exploit loop holes in the law and participate in industrial structures without undermining union autonomy and democracy. TUACC, however, was less clear of how to relate to political movements and parties. TUACC distanced itself officially from the banned ANC to avoid repression, but some workers and unionists looked to homeland and traditional leaders for alliances. This tension between the creation of a democratic trade union culture and the workers’ support of more autocratic political and traditional leaders and populist movements was never resolved. All of TUACC’s affiliates were founder members of COSATU and this study gives us some insight into the traditions that inform COSATU’s responses to social movements, political parties and the state today. Drawing on the insights of the Anracho-syndicalism, this study also highlights some of the dangers of separating the economic and political activities of workers into unions and political parties respectively...|$|R

This Research Handbook discusses fundamental theories and approaches {{to work and}} employment relations, and their connection to broader political and societal changes occurring throughout the world. It provides comprehensive coverage of work and employment relations theory and practice. This up-to-date research compendium has drawn together a range of international authors from diverse disciplinary backgrounds. There are chapters from labor historians, theoreticians, more mainstream <b>industrial</b> relations scholars, <b>sociologists,</b> organizational psychologists, geographers, policy advisors, economists and lawyers. At the heart of each chapter {{is the notion that}} the world of work and employment relations has changed substantially since the halcyon days of IR, throughout the Dunlop Era of the 1950 s. However many areas of enquiry remain, and more questions have developed with society and technology. This Handbook reflects this view. As the field of study and practice continues to evolve throughout the twenty-first century - what lessons have we learned from the past and what can we expect in the future?
