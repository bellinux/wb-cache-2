40|$|The <b>answering</b> <b>machine</b> paradox has {{relatively}} recently sparked {{some debate}} regarding Kaplan’s Demonstrative (1977). A popular approach {{to solve the}} <b>answering</b> <b>machine</b> paradox has been to reject Kaplan’s proper context thesis whilst largely maintaining his framework for indexicals. In this thesis I will firstly present two new <b>answering</b> <b>machine</b> type cases and argue that the existing solutions to the <b>answering</b> <b>machine</b> paradox cannot deal with these cases. Then, I will propose a near-side pragmatic solution to the <b>answering</b> <b>machine</b> paradox that adequately deals with these new <b>answering</b> <b>machine</b> cases {{in a way that}} adheres with our pre-theoretical intuitions...|$|R
2500|$|Marzipan's <b>Answering</b> <b>Machine</b> is {{a series}} of {{cartoons}} with almost no animation. It features messages from the other characters, being played on the <b>answering</b> <b>machine</b> belonging to the character Marzipan. In early episodes, the episode number ended in [...]0 (for example, Marzipan's <b>Answering</b> <b>Machine</b> Version 5.0), but since Marzipan changed to a new <b>answering</b> <b>machine,</b> the number ends in [...]2 (for example, Marzipan's <b>Answering</b> <b>Machine</b> Version 15.2). In every episode, Strong Bad prank calls Marzipan, badly pretending to be someone else, such as [...] "Detective Everybody", [...] "Safety Dan", and sometimes other characters. Although the animation is usually just a picture of the <b>answering</b> <b>machine,</b> sometimes there are short animated segments featuring the characters. As of April 1, 2016, there are 17 Marzipan's <b>Answering</b> <b>Machines.</b>|$|R

Specifically, this study explores whether callers converge to structural (script and message features) and relational (verbal immediacy cues) message aspects found in recorded <b>answering</b> <b>machine</b> messages. After comparing recorded <b>answering</b> <b>machine</b> messages and caller messages, we found that callers exhibited greater convergence to relational than to structural aspects. Both female and male callers converged with levels of immediacy in <b>answering</b> <b>machine</b> messages. Implications for future research in CAT are outlined...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Increased {{incidence}} of telephone <b>answering</b> <b>machines</b> {{and the use}} of such devices to screen calls pose a potential threat to the representativeness of samples in telephone surveys. Using data from nine statewide surveys, this analysis examines the ex-tent to which <b>answering</b> <b>machines</b> are used to screen calls and the demographic characteristics associated with answering ma-chine use and call screening. Results show that at most two to three percent of households use <b>answering</b> <b>machines</b> to screen calls, and that such screening is more likely to take place in households with higher family incomes, outside rural areas, and which include individuals who are younger and have higher levels of education. While call screening does not presently threaten the representativeness of samples in telephone surveys, the in-creased {{incidence of}} <b>answering</b> <b>machines</b> together with the in-creased percentage of households indicating these devices ar...|$|R
50|$|In 1949 {{the first}} commercially {{successful}} <b>answering</b> <b>machine</b> was the Electronic Secretary created by inventor Joseph Zimmerman and businessman George W.

Electronic Secretary Industries was purchased in 1957 by General Telephone and Electronics.Another commercially successful <b>answering</b> <b>machine</b> was the Ansafone created by inventor Dr. Kazuo Hashimoto, who was employed {{by a company}} called Phonetel.
