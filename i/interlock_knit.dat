HaarThe recent green {{movement}} has created {{strong interest in}} sustainable practices in the apparel and textile industry. Accordingly, natural dye usage has increased in popularity over the recent years, as well as alternative fiber sources such as bamboo. Because of the inherently poorer fastness properties of natural dyes compared to synthetic dyes, additional research on natural dyes and mordant agents is necessary to obtain the best colorfastness results. Many salts, called mordants, are used to help affix natural dyes to fabrics, called mordants, but the most common is potassium aluminum sulfate. However, {{it has been suggested}} that aluminum acetate can be a substitute, if not a better mordant than potassium aluminum sulfate for cellulose fibers. This study compared the colorfastness of these two mordants in three different amounts including 5 %, 10 %, and 20 % per weight of fiber (WOF). Three natural dye extracts (madder, weld, and coreopsis), were used to dye seven test fabrics, including a bamboo rayon jersey, two bamboo rayon woven fabrics, a cotton <b>interlock</b> <b>knit,</b> two woven cottons, and a bamboo rayon and cotton blend <b>interlock</b> <b>knit.</b> Lightfastness and colorfastness to laundering tests were conducted, and Gray Scale ratings were analyzed using ANOVA statistical analysis. This analysis showed significant four-way interaction between all variables. Results supported aluminum acetate as a more colorfast mordant for cellulose fibers. This research was supported in part by Agricultural Research Experiment Station at the Kansas State University...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — The Physico-Mechanical {{properties}} of knitted fabric {{can be changed}} due to use of various count of yarn, type of yarn (ring, rotor, and compact), quality of yarn, Loop length / Stitch length, structural geometry, fibrecomposition of yarn etc. This study focused on the various Loop length effect of grey <b>interlock</b> <b>knit</b> structure. With an increase in Loop length, the dimensional properties like CPI, WPI, GSM, thickness & tightness factor will be decreased; while comfort properties like air permeability & water absorbency will be increased. Again shrinkage & spirality will be decreased with increased Loop length at grey stage. Other properties such as bursting strength, abrasion resistance & pilling resistance improved with increased Loop length. Though all the tests for fabric properties were carried out for grey stage, there properties can considerably vary after further finishing of the fabrics. As finishing is mandatory for fabric production, so now-a-days, these kinds of tests are carried out after finishing stage & proper controlling is done according desired quality. Sometimes, controlling of some {{properties of}} finished fabrics are beyond our trial. In that case, analysis of fabric properties at grey stage can help us to take various control & corrective actions when necessary...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to analyse and model the effect of {{knitting}} parameters on the thermal resistance of Cotton/Polyester double layer <b>interlock</b> <b>knitted</b> fabrics. Fabric samples of areal densities ranging from 310 - 495 g/m 2 were knitted using yarns of three different cotton/polyester blends, each of two different linear densities by systematically varying knitting loop lengths for achieving different cover factors. It was found that by changing the polyester content in the inner and outer fabric layer from 40 to 65 % in the double layer knitted fabric has statistically significant effect on the fabric thermal resistance. Fabric thermal resistance increased with increase in relative specific heat of outer fabric layer, yarn linear density, loop length and fabric thickness while decrease in fabric areal density. It was concluded that response surface regression modelling could be successfully used for the prediction of thermal resistance of double layer <b>interlock</b> <b>knitted</b> fabrics. The model was validated by unseen data set and it was found that the actual and predicted values were in good agreement with each other with less than 10 % absolute error. Sensitivity analysis was also performed to find out the relative contribution of each input parameter on the air permeability of the double layer <b>interlock</b> <b>knitted</b> fabrics...|$|R

Knitted fabrics have different density. The influence of structural characteristics and raw material content of <b>interlock</b> <b>knitted</b> fabrics on the physical-mechanical characteristic (breaking strength, bursting strength, tensile properties, abrasion resistance and dimensional stability) was investigated. The results obtained that due to increase of the density increases also bursting strength. All investigated knitted structures have higher tensile strength, course related to tensile strength, wale. Knitted fabrics with PES have higher specific breaking strength, related to knitted fabrics with PA. <b>Interlock</b> <b>knitted</b> fabrics made from cotton/polyester showed significant difference in weight loss from the cotton layer related to the layer of PES, while in the knitted fabrics made from cotton/polyamide the difference is not as pronounced.

Three types of <b>interlocked</b> <b>knitted</b> fabrics (100 % polyester, 100 % viscose and 50 %/ 50 % polyester/viscose) were scoured and treated with silver ions by pad-dry-cure method. A nonwoven fabric (100 % bleached cotton) was also treated with silver ions {{by using a}} spray technique. Physical and tensile properties of the treated fabrics were analyzed and {{compared with those of}} corresponding untreated ones. Results indicate that scouring process and antimicrobial treatment influenced the physical properties and antimicrobial effectiveness of the fabrics. An increase in tensile strength of 100 % polyester and 100 % viscose is observed after the antimicrobial treatment. The absorbency of all the treated knitted fabrics is decreased but it is substantially increased in the case of nonwoven fabrics.

40|$|The {{dimensional}} stability of cotton weft knitted fabrics during exploitation has {{significant effect on}} their quality. The characteristics of fibre, the characteristics of knitwear structure, pattern of fabric and conditions of technological processes influence geometrical and {{dimensional stability}} of knitwear’s.

The samples were knitted on a circular single face and <b>interlock</b> <b>knitting</b> machines from cotton yarns and their combination with PES yarns. Special method of knitted fabric drying was developed for the experimental testing. Thus industrial drying of knitted fabrics was simulated in experimental conditions. The samples were dried in six different modes: hanged on a line in course and wale directions, spread on a smooth surface, winded by hot air, spread on a heated surface, and in a tumbler-dryer. Shrinkage potential of knitwear samples dried in different conditions was determined. After that samples were washed and dried in domestic conditions.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the Transplanar wicking of water through multi-layer fabric assemblies, with particular reference to firefighters’ under garments. The literature survey {{is concerned with}} a review of research work carried out on thermophysiological comfort and the heat and moisture transmission in relation to clothing. This serves as an introduction to which the experimental work has been concerned with the design and construction of apparatus for the measurement of horizontal transplanar wicking (i. e. from a lower fabric layer to the adjacent upper fabric layers, laid horizontally). This apparatus has been constructed to allow the measurement of horizontal transplanar wicking under static fabric conditions, and another novel design has been built for horizontal transplanar wicking measurements under dynamic conditions. In addition a novel design of apparatus for the measurement of vertical transplanar wicking under static conditions has been designed and constructed. A series of horizontal transplanar wicking tests have been carried out on a range of lxl rib polypropylene, Nomex, and Coolmax (polyester) knitted fabrics, and cotton and acrylic <b>interlock</b> <b>knitted</b> fabrics. The initial wicking of water into the fabric occurs in the fine inter-fibre capillaries within the yam structure and then transplanar wicking occurs through contiguous inter-fabric contact points. The nature and number of these inter-fabric contact points in any two or more fabric layers has been demonstrated to depend upon the relative orientation of the fabric construction and the applied pressure. For these reasons some variability in the initial wicking stages of weft knitted fabrics is to be expected, as every two fabric layers in contact will exhibit different inter-fabric contact points. A model of horizontal transplanar wicking has been proposed to explain the observed phenomena. The type of water used (distilled) has been studied in comparison with deaerated and carbonated water, and been shown to have only a very minor influence on the initial rate of wetting and wicking. An empirical hyperbolic equation has been proposed to explain the results of the horizontal transplanar wicking in a single fabric layer which relates the change in percentage fabric water content (...|$|R

The action of cellobiohydrolases I and I 1 (CBH I and CBH 11) and endoglucanases I and I 1 (EG I and 11), alone {{and in different}} combinations, i. e., endo-endo, endo-exo, and exo-exo, is evaluated for reducing sugars, solubilized oligosaccharides, weight loss, bursting strength, and pilling tendency. According to the results, there are clear differences between individual enzymes and their defined mixtures. There is no correlation between high weight loss and good pilling results, and similarly, there is no correlation between weight and strength loss. Thus, the reduced pilling tendency can be obtained with significantly lower strength losses by tailoring the amount and type of different cellulases in the enzyme mixtures.
