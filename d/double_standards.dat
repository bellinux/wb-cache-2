5|$|<b>Double</b> <b>standards</b> between genders {{and classes}} are exposed {{throughout}} the novella. Odysseus commits adultery with Circe while expecting Penelope to remain loyal to him. The maids' {{relations with the}} suitors are seen as treasonous and earn them an execution. Penelope condemns Helen for her involvement in getting men killed at Troy. At the same time, Penelope excuses her involvement in getting the maids killed even though, as Atwood reveals, Penelope enlisted the maids to spy on the suitors and even encouraged them to continue after some were raped.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} gender, sexism, attitudes toward feminism, and the sexual <b>double</b> <b>standard.</b> Students at a university (138 female and 58 male) participated in a survey study, which included six items measuring a sexual <b>double</b> <b>standard,</b> the Neosexism scale, the Ambivalent Sexism Inventory, and the Attitudes toward Feminism scale. Results show a <b>double</b> <b>standard</b> that is endorsed more by male participants than by female participants. Correlations were found between attitudes endorsing the sexual <b>double</b> <b>standard</b> {{and high levels of}} sexism, as well as negative attitudes toward feminism...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} sought to examine the {{relationship}} between the sexual <b>double</b> <b>standard</b> and life history theory. The sexual <b>double</b> <b>standard</b> is the idea that a man is rewarded for sexual behavior, whereas a woman is derogated. Life history theory posits that females who grow up with estranged relationships with their fathers or in divorced households view dating and relationships differently than do other females. To investigate a possible relation between life history theory and the <b>double</b> <b>standard,</b> we had participants report on their interactions with their parents and then rate fictional male or female targets who reported having had varying numbers of sexual partners. Results revealed a relationship between the marital state of female participants’ parents and their exhibition of the <b>double</b> <b>standard.</b> Contrary to expectations, results also revealed a relationship between female participants’ relationships with their mothers (but not fathers) and the exhibition of the <b>double</b> <b>standard...</b>|$|R

5|$|Wollstonecraft was {{prompted}} {{to write the}} Rights of Woman after reading Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord's 1791 report to the French National Assembly, which stated that women should only receive a domestic education; she used her commentary on this specific event to launch a broad attack against sexual <b>double</b> <b>standards</b> and to indict men for encouraging women to indulge in excessive emotion. Wollstonecraft wrote the Rights of Woman hurriedly to respond directly to ongoing events; she intended to write a more thoughtful second volume but died before completing it.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{allegations}} were {{made that the}} government of Pakistan had shielded bin Laden. Critics cited the proximity of bin Laden's heavily fortified compound to the Pakistan Military Academy, that the U.S. chose to not notify Pakistani authorities before the operation, and the <b>double</b> <b>standards</b> of Pakistan regarding the perpetrators of the 2008 Mumbai attacks. U.S. government files, leaked by Wikileaks, disclosed that American diplomats had been told that Pakistani security services were tipping off bin Laden every time U.S. forces approached. Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), also helped smuggle al-Qaeda militants into Afghanistan to fight NATO troops. According to the leaked files, in December 2009, the government of Tajikistan had also told U.S. officials that many in Pakistan were aware of bin Laden's whereabouts.|$|E
40|$|The study {{assessed}} {{the relationship between}} acceptance of sexual <b>double</b> <b>standard</b> and attitude toward sexual harassment among students (N = 426, 141 males and 285 females). A principal components factor analysis with varimax rotation extracted 4 harassment factors: student blame, professor blame, reactions, and feelings about harassment. Controlling for marital status, age, race, and sexual <b>double</b> <b>standard,</b> one-way ANOVA revealed that gender significantly (p=. 0001) affected attitude toward sexual harassment. Males reported less sensitivity toward harassment than females. Multiple regression analyses indicated that as acceptance of sexual <b>double</b> <b>standard</b> increases, sensitivity to sexual harassment decreases (p=. 001), controlling for marital status, age, race, and gender. Controlling for marital status, age and race, two-way ANOVA revealed an interaction effect between gender and sexual <b>double</b> <b>standard</b> for student blame (p<. 0001) and professor blame (p<. 0044), where males {{reported higher levels of}} blame for both groups under the low sexual <b>double</b> <b>standard</b> condition...|$|R
40|$|The sexual <b>double</b> <b>standard</b> {{dictates}} {{that men and}} women are evaluated differently for equivalent sexual behaviour, such that men are socially praised, and women are socially derogated. Previous studies, however, have only investigated the sexual <b>double</b> <b>standard</b> for when men and women engage in sexual behaviour, whereas the aim of this study examines whether the sexual <b>double</b> <b>standard</b> exists when individuals say “no” to casual sex, and whether benevolent sexism impacts this. One hundred and fifty-six Australian undergraduate students participated in an online questionnaire. It was hypothesised that the woman would be rated more positively when she refuses rather than accepts a casual sexual encounter, and, contrarily, the man would be rated more negatively when he refuses rather than accepts a casual sexual encounter. Benevolent sexism was also expected to have an effect on participants’ ratings of each target, such that those high in benevolent sexism would rate the female target more positively when she refuses rather than accepts the casual sexual encounter. Additionally, responses to an open-ended question were predicted to reveal the sexual <b>double</b> <b>standard</b> for when engaging in sexual behaviour. Results showed evidence of a sexual <b>double</b> <b>standard</b> for when targets engaged in casual sex, as well as initial evidence of a sexual <b>double</b> <b>standard</b> for when they refused casual sex. Contrarily, benevolent sexism was found to have no effect on ratings of the targets, and likewise, no sexual <b>double</b> <b>standard</b> for the engagement in sexual activity was revealed by responses to the open-ended question...|$|R

5|$|Dunstan pursued similar reforms {{with respect}} to Indigenous Australians. In 1962, the Aboriginal Affairs Bill was {{introduced}} to liberalise constraints that had been placed on Indigenous Australians {{in the past and}} had effectively resulted in segregation. The initial proposal still retained some restrictions, placing more controls over full-blooded Aborigines. Dunstan was prominent in Labor's opposition to the <b>double</b> <b>standards,</b> and called for abolition of race-based restrictions, saying that social objectives could be achieved without explicit colour-based schemes. He was successful in forcing amendments to liberalise controls on property and the confinement of Indigenous Australians to reserves. However, his attempt to remove the different standards required of part and full-blooded Aborigines failed, as did his proposal to ensure that {{at least half of the}} members of the Aboriginal Affairs Board be Indigenous Australians. Despite the passage of the bill, restrictions remained in place and Dunstan questioned the policy of assimilation of Aborigines, which he saw as the diluting of their distinctive cultures.|$|E
5|$|Supporters {{said that}} the {{publication}} of the cartoons was a legitimate exercise of free speech regardless of the validity of the expression, {{that it was important to}} openly discuss Islam without fear or that the cartoons made important points about topical issues. The Danish tradition of relatively high tolerance for freedom of speech became a focus of some attention. The controversy ignited a debate about the limits of freedom of expression in all societies, religious tolerance and the relationship of Muslim minorities with their broader societies in the West, and relations between the Islamic World in general and the West. Critics of the cartoons described them as Islamophobic, racist, or baiting and blasphemous to Muslims, possibly intended to humiliate a Danish minority. Others saw them as a manifestation of ignorance about the history of Western imperialism, <b>double</b> <b>standards,</b> and stereotyping.|$|E
5|$|Worsening {{economic}} conditions had put further pressure on industrial relations, with unemployment rising and employers seeking to cut costs. Strikes of sugar mill workers in 1927, waterside workers in 1928, and then transport and timber industry workers in 1929 continued to disrupt economic operations. The worst came with ongoing disputes between miners and mine owners on the coalfields of New South Wales had culminated in riots and lockouts in 1929, and intervention by the Bruce government {{failed to produce}} a settlement. Notably, in March 1929 Newcastle-based mine owner John Brown locked out workers from his mines at Pelaw Main and Richmond Main to try to force acceptance of lower wages. Attorney-General John Latham pursued legal action against Brown for illegally using coercive industrial tactics, but Bruce intervened to stop the prosecution, believing the case to be doubtful and that dropping it would give the government a chance to negotiate {{an end to the}} dispute. The mine-owners refused to accede to government-brokered negotiations anyway, and the government was seen to have been siding with rich businesses and applying <b>double</b> <b>standards,</b> undermining Bruce's own credibility as an impartial leader and law-and-order prime minister.|$|E

This research is aimed to explain United States diplomatic dilemma and <b>double</b> <b>standard</b> politics toward Egypt civil-military conflict and Morsi coup in 2013, which tries to answer why United States used <b>double</b> <b>standard</b> politics on Egypt case. United States has a strong policy on democratization, human rights and anti-coup, which made a controversial policy on Egypt cases.

40|$|In {{a fairly}} recent meta-analytic study {{carried out by}} Crawford & Popp (2003) it has been {{suggested}} that there has been a recent ‘ethic of silence’ with regards to empirical studies of the lived experiences and perceptions of women’s sexuality. More specifically, in terms of the lack of empirical qualitative research examining women’s experiences of a sexual <b>double</b> <b>standard</b> and the influences this may have on their expressions of sexuality that fall out-with the boundaries of heteronormative expectations of women’s sexual behaviours. Accordingly, the purpose of this research is to explore the lived experiences and perceptions of heterosexual women from the Lothian areas who participate in casual sex to elucidate novel knowledge regarding the sexual <b>double</b> <b>standard</b> and its effects on women’s sexuality. Six women from the Lothian areas responded to advertisement of the study and agreed to take part in semi-structured interviews. All of the women provided an in depth and detailed account of their lived experiences and perceptions of being a woman and the influence of gendered norms, sexual identity and their participation in casual sex behaviours, and most importantly their experiences of the sexual <b>double</b> <b>standard</b> and heteronormative sexual discourse within current society. The findings of this research signify conflicts that are embedded within the women’s accounts of gender and sexuality, which are pertinent to their discussions of the detrimental effects they experiences from the existence of a sexual <b>double</b> <b>standard</b> and the use of stigmatising heteronormative discourse. Conversely, within the women’s narratives of the sexual <b>double</b> <b>standard</b> it is evident that women themselves propagate stigmatised sexual discourse to describe other women who participate in casual sex, and ultimately subscribe to their own sexual <b>double</b> <b>standard...</b>|$|R
