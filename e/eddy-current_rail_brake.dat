Comparisons on experimental and computed operating characteristics of <b>eddy-current</b> and magnetic <b>rail</b> <b>brakes</b> {{for use on}} a tram-car, on a railroad vehi-cle, and on a high-speed train are presented.

40|$|Abstract. Magnetic track brake is a {{new kind}} of <b>rail</b> transit vehicle <b>braking</b> mode, this paper {{introduces}} its composition, structure, working principle and braking control methods, and analyzes its application. 1 Concept and classification of magnetic track brake The force which slowing down or stopping the train, keeping the train speed stability when downhill driving, making the train stopped in place even on the slopes is known as brake. The way using electromagnetic effect for braking, is known as the electromagnetic brake. According to the application of electromagnetic <b>brake</b> implementation on <b>rail</b> transit vehicle, there are two main types: electromagnetic <b>rail</b> <b>brake</b> and electromagnetic eddy current <b>brake.</b> Electromagnetic <b>rail</b> <b>brake</b> (also called magnetic track brake) is a kind of contact friction braking, basing on the wheel/rail adhesion. The electromagnetic force sucks the magnetic track brake which mounted on bogie and rail. Through the device {{at the bottom of the}} magnetic rail wear, the sliding friction between the plate and rails, train the kinetic energy into heat energy and make it escape into the atmosphere, so as to realize the train slowing down or stop. We divided magnetic track brake into electromagnetic track brake and magnetic track brake wit...|$|R

5000|$|With the {{oil crisis}} of 1973, {{it no longer}} seemed {{economically}} viable to power the future high-speed train with fossil fuels. The requirements were changed to fully electric operation, which resulted in an extensive redesign and test program. In April 1974, the Z7001 experimental electric railcar, nicknamed [...] "Zébulon", began trials. Zébulon was rebuilt from the Z7115 which had been wrecked. Using this vehicle, the new Y226 long-wheelbase power truck (precursor of the Y230 of the production TGV) was developed and tested, with its body-mounted traction motors and tripod cardan transmission. Body mounting of the traction motors was a major innovation; it allowed a considerable (3300 kg) reduction in {{the mass of the}} power truck, giving it a very high critical speed and exceptional tracking stability. Zébulon also served to develop a two-stage high speed pantograph, which later became the AM-PSE pantograph of the TGV Sud-Est, as well as a new type of eddy current <b>rail</b> <b>brake.</b> The eddy current <b>rail</b> <b>brake</b> exerts a magnetic retention effort, without ever making contact with the rail. The promise of high efficiency and low wear was however outweighed by problems with overheating in the rail, and the design was dropped. Zébulon's suspension, of a non-pneumatic design, was completely satisfactory so it was adopted for the new high speed train, instead of the TGV 001's pneumatic suspension.|$|R
