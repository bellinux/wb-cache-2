5|$|Honorius {{consolidated}} {{the work}} of converting the English by sending Felix, a Burgundian, to Dunwich after Felix came to the archbishop and made known his <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to East Anglia as a missionary. Honorius may have consecrated Felix as the first bishop of East Anglia or Felix may have already been consecrated on the continent. The dating of this episode is unclear, but it is probably close to 631. It is possible that King Sigeberht of East Anglia, who converted to Christianity {{while he was in}} exile on the continent, had already met Felix and was behind Felix's journey to Honorius. As well as his help to Felix, Honorius consecrated the first Anglo-Saxon bishop, Ithamar of Rochester, and his successor was also a native of England.|$|E

25|$|O’Neil's Question is very {{conflicted}} {{on how far}} to go in enforcing justice, often feeling {{tempted to}} kill. He resists this temptation during his time in Hub City, realizing {{that part of his}} <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> so far is just to see {{what it feels like to}} take a life. His relationship with his mentor, Aristotle Rodor, is one of many things that keep him from going over the edge and back towards the darkness he had shown in his youth on the streets of Hub City.|$|E
25|$|In 1944, Dora {{was still}} working for the Duke {{when she came in}} contact with Opus Dei. Fr.

The Mother Superior of the Domestic Service Daughters recommended Dora, who happened to have some days off at the time.

25|$|Third, Searle {{argues that}} much of {{rational}} deliberation involves adjusting our (often inconsistent) patterns of desires to decide between outcomes, {{not the other way}} around. While in the Classical Model, one would start from a <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to Paris greater than that of saving money and calculate the cheapest way to get there, in reality people balance the niceness of Paris against the costs of travel to decide which desire (visiting Paris or saving money) they value more. Hence, he believes rationality is not a system of rules, but more of an adverb. We see certain behavior as rational, no matter what its source, and our system of rules derives from finding patterns in what we see as rational.|$|E
25|$|Female {{resistance}} to mate guarding {{has also been}} researched {{in the context of}} the menstrual cycle. Pillsworth, Haselton and Buss (2004) found that women are more likely to want to mate with males they are not currently pair bonded with during the ovulation period of their menstrual cycle. They also show higher mate guarding resistance in general during oestrus. This is supported by the finding that during ovulation women who are both single or in a monogamous partnership with a man are more likely to <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to social gatherings where they may meet alternative mates. This is said to support the female dual mating strategy theory, as during oestrus women may be seeking out mates with strong genes.|$|E

After talking it over with his staff, the Spanish general told Robertson of his <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> ahead with the operation. Soon afterward, the plan nearly miscarried when the Scot {{was picked up by}} a Danish patrol while attempting to signal a British warship off Funen. The priest managed to talk {{his way out of the}} situation and later was able to get his message to a British vessel. At length, the commander of the Baltic fleet, Admiral Richard Goodwin Keats contacted Canning that the plan could be put into motion. Transport vessels set out from England for the Baltic.|$|E

25|$|Moore {{was born}} on February 13, 1922, in Bardstown, Kentucky, the eldest of four {{children}} born to Harold, Sr. and Mary (Crume) Moore. His father was an insurance agent whose territory covered western Kentucky {{and his mother was}} a homemaker. Because he was interested in obtaining an appointment to the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, New York and felt his chances were better if he was located in a larger city, he left Kentucky at the age of seventeen before finishing high school and got a job in Washington, D.C. working in the U.S. Senate book warehouse. Moore finished high school at night while working days and graduated from St. Joseph Preparatory School in Bardstown with the class of 1940. Moore attended George Washington University at night for two years, working at his warehouse job while waiting on an appointment to West Point. During his time at George Washington University he was initiated into the Kappa Sigma Fraternity. After President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed legislation authorizing each senator and representative additional appointments to the military and naval academies, Moore was offered an appointment to the United States Naval Academy by Representative Ed Creal (4th District, Kentucky) but Moore had no <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to the Naval Academy. Moore asked Creal if he could find another congressman that would trade his Military Academy appointment for Creal's Naval Academy appointment would he be agreeable to that arrangement. Creal agreed, and Moore soon found Representative Eugene Cox of Georgia's 2nd Congressional District, with an open appointment to West Point. Cox was impressed with Moore's tenacity and he left Cox's office with the West Point appointment.|$|E

500|$|Simultaneously, Sadat {{sought to}} improve Egypt's {{military}} capabilities, and in March began {{the first of}} four trips to the Soviet Union to obtain arms and munitions to cover those expended in the War of Attrition. He publicly stated his <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to war and marked 1971 the [...] "year of decision". However, the Soviets failed to deliver the promised supplies, and Sadat ruled out an offensive that year. As 1971 drew to a close, Sadat's threats were dismissed as hollow Arab rhetoric. Added to their already weak political position, Arab leaders reached a consensus in 1972 that a diplomatic solution to the conflict was hopeless. American mediation steadily declined, ceasing entirely by mid-1973.|$|E

500|$|Upper Pine Bottom State Park traces its {{existence}} {{to the early}} 1920s, when the Pennsylvania Department of Forestry built 31campsites on state forest land between 1921and 1925. The park was established by 1923 as [...] "Upper Pine Bottom Class B Public Camp", and named for the stream that flows through it. Class B camps were on secondary highways and were [...] "used primarily by hikers, hunters, fishermen, vacationists, and picknickers who <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> far {{into the woods and}} make their stay comfortable". Each Class B camp had a lean-to shelter for camping, potable water, picnic tables, a fireplace, garbage can, and a latrine. There was no charge to use any of the camps, but stays were limited to two consecutive nights.|$|E
500|$|Despite his <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> back to Japan, Berg {{reported}} to the Senators training camp on February 26, 1933 in Biloxi. He played in just 40 games during the season, and batted only [...]185. The Senators won the pennant, but lost to the Giants in the World Series. Cliff Bolton, the Senators' starting catcher in 1933, demanded more money in 1934. When the Senators refused to pay him more, he sat out and Berg got the starting job. On April 22, Berg made an error, his first fielding mistake since 1932an American League record of 117 consecutive errorless games. On July 25, the Senators gave Berg his unconditional release. He soon returned to the big leagues, however, after Cleveland Indians catcher Glenn Myatt broke his ankle on August 1. Indians manager Walter Johnson, who had managed Berg in 1932, offered Berg the reserve catching job. Berg played sporadically until Frankie Pytlak, Cleveland's starting catcher, injured himself, and Berg became the starting catcher.|$|E
500|$|Compounding their {{difficulties}} were Bryant's ongoing {{relationship with}} O'Neill and gynecological problems {{she was treated}} for while Reed was in the hospital. When he returned from Baltimore in mid-December, Reed and Bryant retreated full-time to Croton-on-Hudson to recuperate and to focus on writing. They made plans to travel to China in 1917 to cover events for American publications, but in January the plans fell through when U.S. entry into World War I against Germany became highly likely. (The U.S. entered the war on April 6.) To boost their finances, they sold the cottage in Truro to Margaret Sanger, and Reed pawned his father's gold watch. At the same time, his strong anti-war positions, enunciated in The Masses and elsewhere, alienated most of his employers, further reducing his income. Adding to these stresses was Reed's confession to Bryant {{that he had had}} multiple love affairs, and the subsequent unhappiness between Bryant and Reed led to a temporary separation. When she expressed a <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to Europe, he helped her convince John N. Wheeler, who had recently formed the Bell Syndicate, to issue her a press pass. Reed paid for her passage, and Bryant set sail in June to cover the war in France. Regrets quickly followed. According to biographer Virginia Gardner: ...|$|E

500|$|In 1987, before Clarence aired {{and after}} rejecting Hall's offer {{of the part}} of Falstaff in a Royal National Theatre {{production}} of Henry IV, Part 1 & 2, Barker retired from show business, aged 58, [...] "at {{the height of his}} fame", citing a decline in his own writing quality, lack of ambition and ideas, and a <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> out on top so as not to damage his legacy, as well as concerns about the state of his heart. He had decided to retire in 1985 but his decision was kept secret for two years, Corbett being the only one knowing about it. He made his decision public on an appearance on the chat show Wogan. Retired, Barker opened and ran an antiques shop called The Emporium in Chipping Norton in Oxfordshire and resisted all calls to come out of retirement from then onwards. He joked: [...] "I lose money every week, but it's a hobby. It's cheaper than skiing and safer at my age." [...] Because of its unprofitability, the shop was sold after ten years. He wrote his autobiography, Dancing in the Moonlight: My Early Years on Stage in 1993 and released All I Ever Wrote, his complete scripts, in 1999. He wrote the play Mum for his daughter Charlotte Barker in 1998, which was performed at The King's Head Theatre, but garnered a negative response, with Barker stating it got [...] "the worst notices of any play {{in the history of the}} theatre." ...|$|E
