500|$|On 20 January 1843, Daniel M'Naghten {{attempted}} to assassinate Robert Peel, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. Approaching {{a man he}} believed to be Peel, M'Naghten fired into his back, in fact killing Edward Drummond, Peel's secretary. Immediately arrested, {{he was charged with}} murder and tried on 3 March 1843 at the Old Bailey. He was assisted in his defence by two solicitors, four barristers including Alexander Cockburn and nine medical experts, along with eight lay witnesses. Both sides agreed that M'Naghten was insane; the question was what constituted a valid legal defence of insanity. The judges decided that [...] "every man is presumed to be sane, and to possess a sufficient degree of reason to be responsible for his crimes, until the contrary be proved to their satisfaction; and that to establish a defence on the ground of insanity, it must be clearly proved that, {{at the time of the}} committing of the act, the party accused was labouring under such a defect of reason, from disease of the mind, as not to know the nature and quality of the act he was doing; or, if he did know it, that he did not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> doing was wrong", which was boiled down to [...] "did the defendant <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> doing, and if so, that what he was doing was wrong?". This established the M'Naghten Rules, which remain the principal method of deciding insanity in English law.|$|E
500|$|A year later, Frusciante and {{his mother}} moved to Mar Vista, Los Angeles with his new {{stepfather}} who, he says, [...] "really supported me and {{made me feel good}} about being an artist." [...] Like many young people in the area, he became intimately involved in the L.A. punk rock scene. At nine he was infatuated with the Germs, wearing out several copies of their record (GI). By ten, he had taught himself how to play most of (GI)'s songs. He has stated that he did not really <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> doing, and that he would play every chord with a single-finger barre.|$|E
500|$|In June 1953, Hayward took {{command of}} the escort carrier [...] He confessed to the crew {{that he did not}} <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> doing, and urged any crewman who felt he was doing {{something}} wrong to tell him so at once. At the end of the Korean War, the carrier was deployed at Inchon, where a baby was found abandoned in the trash at a U.S. Army depot. The baby was brought to an orphanage, and Hayward sent Point Cruzs chaplain in response to a request for assistance. The nun running the orphanage felt the blue-eyed baby would not be safe if he remained in Korea. Hayward is said to have told the chaplain: [...] "You are not to return to this vessel until you have procured that baby." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, never mind; I wish I knew it all," [...] {{answered}} another. [...] "I guess <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> doing." [...] And in this <b>he</b> <b>was</b> right; Theodore Roosevelt <b>knew</b> exactly <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{trying to}} accomplish.|$|R
60|$|And {{as if she}} <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> thinking, {{she looked}} round and smiled.|$|R
500|$|The two {{are brought}} aboard and while Dr. Crusher (Gates McFadden) tends to Dr. Manheim, who is having convulsions, Picard discovers {{his wife is}} Jenice, Picard's former love from before he decided to join Starfleet. Jenice warns {{that her husband was}} working privately in his laboratory, but that she didn't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> working on. She also alerts the crew to {{numerous}} security protocols that he has installed at the facilities. As the crew prepares to send an away-team to investigate the laboratory, they experience more time distortions, described by Data (Brent Spiner) as [...] "Manheim effects". In one instance Picard, Riker and Data enter a turbolift only to see their past selves conversing outside of the lift. The crew find that they cannot complete a transporter beam to the facility due to the security measures in place there.|$|E
500|$|Frances Anderson, in 1974 characterised Smart's [...] "illness" [...] as {{insanity}} and obsession, but {{believed that}} [...] "Smart's madness consisted {{of his efforts}} to obey literally St Paul's injunction to the Thessalonians: 'Pray without ceasing. During his episodes of illness, as Anderson continued, Smart [...] "probably suffered some periods of delirium" [...] but also [...] "appeared to <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> doing". Smart's actions were similar to 18th-century Methodists that were [...] "addicted to public prayer with what {{was thought to be}} overly charged high spirits. Such displayers of religious emotionalism were often confined not only to private madhouses, but also to Bedlam". Later, in 1998, Charles Rosen pointed out that [...] "The Enlightenment condemned religious enthusiasm as appropriate for the uneducated and the great unwashed" [...] and [...] "it is understandable that the only original and vital religious poetry between 1760 and 1840 should have been written by poets considered genuinely mad by their contemporaries: Smart, Blake, and Hölderlin." ...|$|E
500|$|California {{used the}} M'Naghten {{standard}} for sanity which held {{that for a}} defendant to [...] "establish a defense on the ground of insanity, it must be clearly proved that, {{at the time of}} the committing of the act, the party accused was laboring under such a defect of reason, from disease of mind, and not to know the nature and quality of the act he was doing; or if he did know it, that he did not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> doing was wrong." [...] Kemper appeared to have known that the nature of his acts were wrong, and had also shown signs of malice aforethought. On November 1, Kemper took the stand. He testified that he killed the co-eds because he wanted them [...] "for myself, like possessions," [...] and attempted to convince the jury that he was insane based on the reasoning that his actions could only have been committed by someone with an aberrant mind.|$|E

500|$|Involuntary and {{pathological}} intoxication are affirmative defenses to all criminal offenses in New Jersey, {{but are not}} defenses to regulatory law {{and traffic}} law offenses that are considered strict liability violations (e.g. environmental regulations, DUI). Involuntary intoxication relates to cases where someone {{did not know that}} they had consumed alcohol (e.g. a spiked drink). Pathological intoxication is applicable where, for medical reasons, a person had an exaggerated response to alcohol. To be used as a defense, the person being charged must show that [...] "at the time of his conduct did not know the nature and quality of the act he was doing, or if he did know it, that he did not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> doing was wrong." [...] Contracts made with an intoxicated person may be voided by courts if [...] "the defendant was so intoxicated" [...] that he or she [...] "could not realize and appreciate the nature and consequences of what defendant was doing." ...|$|E
500|$|Where the {{defendant}} {{is alleged to have}} been insane at the time of committing the offence, this issue can be raised in one of three ways; {{the defendant}} can claim he was insane, the defendant can raise a defence of Automatism where the judge decides it was instead insanity, or the defendant can raise a plea of diminished responsibility, where the judge or prosecution again show that insanity is more appropriate. Whatever the way in which a plea of insanity is reached, the same test is used each time, as laid out in the M'Naghten Rules; [...] "to establish a defence on the ground of insanity, it must be clearly proved that, {{at the time of the}} committing of the act, the party accused was labouring under such a defect of reason, from disease of the mind, as not to know the nature and quality of the act he was doing; or, if he did know it, that he did not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> doing was wrong".|$|E
500|$|... "Disease of the mind" [...] is not {{a medical}} term; it instead means that the {{defendant}} must show {{he was suffering from}} a disease which affected the functioning of the mind, which does not necessarily have to be a disease of the brain. This was confirmed in the case of R v Kemp [...] 1 QB 399, where the defendant's arteriosclerosis led to him assaulting his wife while unconscious. It must then be shown that this disease of the mind led to a [...] "defect of reason"; that the defendant's ability to reason was impaired by the disease. Alternately, the defendant can try to show {{that he did not know}} [...] "the nature or quality of his act or that it was wrong". The first requires proof that the defendant did not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> doing; that he had no awareness of what he was happening, that he was unaware of the consequences of his act or that he knew what he was doing, but was deluded as to the circumstances; for the latter, Jonathan Herring gives the example of a man who [...] "thought he was killing a monstrous person when he was in fact killing a person". When arguing that the defendant was [...] "not knowing the act was wrong", [...] "wrong" [...] is taken to mean [...] "illegal", as set out in R v Windle [...] 2 QB 826.|$|E

500|$|Muransky {{also set}} the all-time [...] "Beef Bowl" [...] record by {{consuming}} [...] of prime rib at Lawry's before the 1979 Rose Bowl. Muransky later recalled: [...] "Bubba Paris and I were two happy freshmen eating {{together at the}} Lawry's Beef Bowl event before the 1979 Rose Bowl Game. After we had enjoyed our fourth plate of prime rib, mashed potatoes, corn and Yorkshire pudding, Bubba asked what the record was, and they said 7 cuts. Bubba continued for 3 more cuts, and I continued for four, totally under the Bo Schembechler radar screen. When they delivered the 8th cut to me, the media started to gather around my table, Bo walked by and let me <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> thinking without ever saying a word. Afterward, a Paris-Muransky night out ended with some pizza. The next morning in practice, Bo made an example of Bubba and me. We never ran so much in our lives as we did that day. We were in every play of scrimmage and then we ran sprints." [...] When the Wolverines returned to Pasadena for the 1981 Rose Bowl, [...] "Bo {{made it a point}} to come to the back of the plane and talk to me and Bubba Paris. He wanted to let us know that my record from a couple years earlier would not be in jeopardy because we were going to be sitting with him at the Lawry's Beef Bowl. He said he was going to limit each of us to two cuts of prime rib." [...] Schembechler had his own take on the story: [...] "I let 'em eat because they were freshmen. They weren't gonna play anyway." ...|$|E
500|$|Between 1996 and 2000, {{the lead}} monster and child went through radical changes {{as the story}} evolved. As the story {{continued}} to develop, the child varied in age and gender. Ultimately, the story team decided that a girl {{would be the best}} counterpart for a furry, [...] co-star. After a girl was settled upon, the character continued to undergo changes, at one point being from Ireland and at another time being an African-American character. Originally the character of the little girl, known as Mary, became a fearless seven-year-old who has been toughened by years of teasing and pranks from four older brothers. In stark contrast, Johnson is nervous about the possibility of losing his job after the boss at Monsters, Inc. announces a downsizing is on the way. He feels envious because another scarer, Ned (who later became Randall), is the company's top performer. Through various drafts, Johnson's occupation went back-and-forth from being a scarer and from working in another area of the company such as a janitor or a refinery worker, until his final incarnation as the best scarer at Monsters, Inc. Throughout development Pixar worried that having a main character whose main goal was to scare children would alienate audiences and make them not empathize with him. Docter would later describe that the team [...] "bent over backwards trying to create a story that still had monsters [...] " [...] while still solving the problem, A key moment came when the team decided [...] "Okay, he’s the BEST scarer there. He’s the star quarterback" [...] with Docter noting that before that moment [...] "design after design, we really didn’t <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> about." [...] Disney noted to Pixar early on that they did not want the character to [...] "look like a guy in a suit." [...] To this end Johnson was originally planned to have tentacles for feet; however, this caused many problems in early animation tests. The idea was later largely rejected, as it was thought that audiences would be distracted by the tentacles. Mary's age also differed from draft to draft until the writers settled on the age of 3. [...] "We found that the younger she was, the more dependent she was on Sulley", Docter said.|$|E

2500|$|The {{speech was}} drafted with the {{assistance}} of Stanley Levison and Clarence Benjamin Jones in Riverdale, New York City.

2500|$|In Knut Hamsun's 1892 novel Mysteries, the characters, on {{a couple}} of occasions, briefly discuss Charles Stewart Parnell, {{particularly}} in relation to Gladstone: [...] "Dr. Stenerson had a high opinion of Parnell, but if Gladstone was so opposed to him, he must <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> about—with apologies to the host, Mr. Nagel, who couldn't forgive Gladstone for being an honourable man".

Harry has to find out, before we find out. And for some mysterious reason, the curse didn't work on Harry. So he's left with this lightning-bolt shaped scar on his forehead, and the curse rebounded upon the evil wizard who has been in hiding ever since".|$|E
