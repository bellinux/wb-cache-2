25|$|In July 2008, it was {{announced}} that Quiñones would play the part of Lara in the upcoming film <b>I</b> <b>Hope</b> <b>They</b> Serve Beer In Hell, based on the book of the same name. On July 24, 2008, producer Tucker Max announced on the film's official production blog that Quiñones had dropped out due to a scheduling conflict.|$|E
25|$|Bradford {{played the}} role of Rene Gagnon in the 2006 film Flags of Our Fathers, based on the book of the same name by James Bradley. The film is about the Battle of Iwo Jima and was {{directed}} by Academy Award-winning director Clint Eastwood. In 2009, Bradford was cast as one of the leads in <b>I</b> <b>Hope</b> <b>They</b> Serve Beer in Hell, based on Tucker Max's best-selling book.|$|E
25|$|I {{resolve to}} be found unremoveable the {{faithful}} servant of The Commonwealth of England: and if you believe {{me to be a}} gentleman, you may believe I will be faithful to my trust. What principles I am judged to be of, I know not: but <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>they</b> are such as shall ever declare me honest; and no way differing from those engaged in the same employment with me, — unless they should desert that cause they are imbarqued in.|$|E

25|$|If, therefore, in the {{following}} pages I fall into any errors, <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>they</b> will be dealt with as honest mistakes, and not as indicating that I have forgotten our ancient motto. This event took place {{at a time when}} the Highlanders, according to Macaulay, were much like the Cape Caffres , and any one, it was said, could escape punishment for cattle-stealing by presenting a share of the plunder to his chieftain. Our ancestors were Roman Catholics; they were made Protestants by the laird coming round with a man having a yellow staff, which would seem to have attracted more attention than his teaching, for the new religion went long afterward, perhaps it does so still, by the name of “the religion of the yellow stick”.|$|E
500|$|Harper has {{expressed}} socially conservative views on some issues. In 1994, he opposed plans by federal Justice Minister Allan Rock to introduce spousal benefits for same-sex couples. Citing the recent {{failure of a}} similar initiative in Ontario, he was quoted as saying, [...] "What <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>they</b> learn is not to get into it. There are more important social and economic issues, {{not to mention the}} unity question." [...] Harper also spoke against the possibility of the Canadian Human Rights Commission or the Supreme Court changing federal policy in these and other matters.|$|E
500|$|... "Gypsies, Tramps and Weed" [...] {{was written}} by Katie Palmer and {{directed}} by series producer James Burrows. In October 2000, {{it was confirmed that}} singer-songwriter Cher would guest star on Will & Grace as herself. She filmed her appearance on October 17. Cher revealed, [...] "We did two endings. I improvised one. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>they</b> show it as an outtake 'cause the audience loved that one more than the one they're gonna show. Instead of the thing I was supposed to do, I did something to Sean [...] something completely different and he just about passed out. I don't know what possessed me." [...] It was also announced that actress Camryn Manheim would appear. Cher would later guest star on Will & Grace two years later.|$|E

500|$|The Memorial was {{formally}} unveiled on 26 April 2005 by Queen Elizabeth and Tony Blair. Michael Howard and Charles Kennedy, {{the leaders of}} the UK's other leading political parties at the time, were also present. A guard of honour was provided by 56 officers wearing the uniforms of each of the UK's police forces. The Queen stated that [...] "It is surely appropriate that this should be positioned in The Mall - an area of London so often associated with our national way of life. When people pass by the memorial, <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>they</b> will pause and reflect on the proud traditions that it represents. The courage and personal sacrifice recorded here will, I am certain, serve as an inspiration to us all." ...|$|E
500|$|The two-hour premiere episode {{cost up to}} $10 {{million to}} produce, and Cameron {{reportedly}} [...] "brought the pilot in on time and on budget". Subsequent episodes had a considerably smaller budget. Fox spent heavily on the promotional campaign for the premiere, paying for theatrical trailers, billboards, and guerilla marketing. Cameron took a [...] "very basic view" [...] of the show's chance of success, saying: [...] "If it flies, it flies. If it doesn't, it doesn't... If people connect with it, which <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>they</b> will, fine. If we don't find an audience, we deserve to be off the air. It's that simple." [...] Eglee admitted the series had been [...] "routinely overbudget" [...] in the first season, and feared {{that this would be}} a factor in whether or not the show was renewed for a second season, though Cameron downplayed these concerns.|$|E
500|$|... "I {{could stay}} forever {{on the show}} and be safe. But three years ago I did Night of the Iguana in Williamstown , and I had a quote from Tennessee Williams taped on my mirror, taken from an essay he'd written on success. It said, and I'm paraphrasing here: 'Security is {{in the shape of a}} {{kidney-shaped}} pool in Los Angeles, where you sit waiting for your residual checks.' I was in a comfortable spot on Knots, and an artist should not be comfortable. I'd forgotten that there was a character I'd loved for 13 years. She was the seed of the show. I am the sole person to spin off from Dallas (because actor David Ackroyd originated the role of Gary on that show). Valene gave Knots a note of spirituality. There was a heart that was Valene. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>they</b> treat her with respect, that she is seen out with a resolution she deserves." ...|$|E

5000|$|Ultimately, Rightnowar {{explained}} {{his reasons for}} crossing the picket lines. [...] "For about 20 minutes, they fired questions and took shots at me," [...] he told the Blade. [...] "I told them they could call me 'scab' or whatever. But I told them <b>I</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>they</b> respected my decision. This was my one shot and I knew it." ...|$|R
500|$|Cyrus {{believed}} that compared to previous albums, Breakout was [...] "grown-up" [...] and [...] "just {{a little more}} creative." [...] Cyrus aimed to incorporate a sound influenced by rock music, saying [...] "the writing is definitely different...the lyrics mean more than my last couple of records". According to Cyrus, the album documented, in depth, the events that occurred in her life in a year span. Most of the songs were written as Cyrus traveled on the Best of Both Worlds Tour from October 2007 to January 2008. Recording commenced immediately after the tour came to an end, and seized in March 2008, for Cyrus was to film [...] (2009) in Tennessee soon after. She expressed that, through each song, a listener could discover something about her and about themselves. Of connecting with her fans through Breakout, she claimed she wanted [...] "girls to feel {{to be able to}} feel empowered and just feel like they can kind of rock out", going on to say that, [...] "listening to this music, <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>they</b> can feel like a reason to dance and just smile and to have fun. This CD is totally age appropriate, specially for me".|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} for Complex, Drake stated that his debut album will be [...] "a solid hip hop album" [...] and musically distinct from his So Far Gone mixtape, which received negative comparisons to Kanye West's 808s & Heartbreak (2008). He {{expressed a desire to}} work with André 3000, Kid Cudi, and Sade for the album. In {{an interview}} for MTV, Drake cited Nas and André 3000 as influences for parts of Thank Me Later, stating [...] "Nas was somebody that I used to listen to his raps and never understood how he did it. I always wanted to understand how he painted those pictures and his bar structure. I went back and really studied Nas and André 3000 and then came back with this album". In comparing the album to his previous work, he stated [...] "It's gonna be bigger, it's gonna sound happier. More victorious, 'cause that's where I'm at in my life". He told Entertainment Weekly that, [...] "I didn't make this album for commercial purposes. A lot of the verses are extremely long. I just made it to share with people. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>they</b> can enjoy".|$|E
500|$|In {{the third}} round of the League Cup, Arsenal faced Derby County at Pride Park. Wenger made several first team changes to give his younger players playing time; Arsenal ran out 2–1 winners, a {{performance}} where [...] "every touch by a Derby player was greeted with ironic cheers." [...] However, the team were beaten comprehensively in the next round to Chelsea at Highbury, losing 0–5. The result inflicted Arsenal's biggest defeat in over eight years and Wenger defended his team selection, virtually a 'second team': [...] "I knew before the game that this kind of thing might happen. You only had to look at the team sheets. If we had won I would still have gone on playing the same side because the players need the experience." [...] Bergkamp, who was rested for the match, echoed his manager's comments: [...] "We had a lot of young players on the field against Chelsea and, although they were feeling very down after losing like that, they will learn from it. To be honest, the scoreline doesn't mean anything, whether it was 1–0 or 5–0. The supporters will feel bad but <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>they</b> understand Saturday will be a different game [...]" ...|$|E
60|$|The {{meeting in}} the evening was in a large church, densely crowded, and {{conducted}} much as the others had been. When they came to sing the closing hymn, <b>I</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>they</b> would sing Dundee; but they did not, and I fear in Scotland, as elsewhere, the characteristic national melodies are giving way before more modern ones.|$|R
6000|$|... "I know that," [...] Jip wailed, and Seth fancied {{there was}} a ring of real sorrow in his tones. [...] "I must have been crazy to do it, an' after the match was dropped in the {{shavings}} <b>I</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>they</b> wouldn't catch fire. Then I sent in the alarm, 'cause the light kept growin' brighter, an' nobody else saw it." ...|$|R
60|$|When we {{had fired}} our second volley of fusils, {{we thought they}} stopped a little, and <b>I</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>they</b> would have gone off, but it was but a moment, for others came forward again; so we fired our vollies of pistols; and I believe in these four firings we killed {{seventeen}} or eighteen of them, and lamed twice as many; yet they came on again.|$|R
500|$|Padres {{general manager}} Kevin Towers said Hoffman {{was the first}} one in and the last one out of the {{ballpark}} everyday. Hoffman adhered to a daily conditioning program. When pitcher Jeremy Fikac was promoted to the majors in 2001, Hoffman invited him to join him on his usual afternoon run. [...] "I remember sitting in the bullpen that night, and my legs were still trembling from the run", Fikac recalled. [...] "I'd run before, but not at that pace ... I was thinking, <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>they</b> don't call on me because I can't feel my legs under me ... His work ethic is unbelievable." [...] Bochy said, [...] " [...] one of those guys like Tony Gwynn—they never feel like they've arrived. Tony never thought, 'Well, I'm hitting [...]360 ... ' He was never content. And Trevor's the same way. They just keep working and make sure that they've got goals they want to reach." [...] After every save opportunity, whether he converted it or blew it, Hoffman would sit in the dugout for up to five minutes after his teammates had cleared out. Whether it was the euphoria from success or the sting of failure, he would sit there and drain all the emotion out of himself, put the game behind him, and move on. Tracy Hoffman said, [...] "He's all about order. That's the foundation to what he does. You see it when he's on the field. He's always the same, win or lose. He doesn't smile, doesn't show any emotion." [...] Padres manager Bud Black marveled at Hoffman's regimen. [...] "The daily preparation for his job, that focus and dedication each day to prepare for the ninth inning ... It was incredible to see live", said Black. [...] "I played with George Brett, a Hall of Famer who was a great worker. But Trevor took it to a level and a commitment and Hall of Fame caliber." [...] After Hoffman resurrected his final season and recorded his 600th save, Macha said Hoffman's [...] "work ethic and perseverance paid off ... He had to grind it out to get there." ...|$|E
