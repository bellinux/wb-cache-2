5000|$|Cases of {{congenital}} fourth nerve palsy vary {{in magnitude}} and way {{they affect the}} motion of the superior oblique muscle. Therefore different surgeries are available dependent upon the type of misalignment. Sometimes surgery on more than one eye muscle is required. In some simpler, unilateral cases a single surgery may suffice. In these cases the main problem is that the inferior oblique muscle of the same eye acts unopposed by the weakened superior oblique muscle, pulling the eye up. An example of a safe and effective procedure is a <b>disinsertion</b> of the inferior oblique muscle to allow it to reattach itself further down the globe of the eye. This acts to 'weaken' its action and allow the eye to move back into a more neutral alignment.|$|E

HYPOTHESIS: Bursectomy, excision of the distal paratenon, <b>disinsertion</b> of the tendon, removal of the calcific deposit, and reinsertion of the Achilles tendon with bone anchors is safe and effective. STUDY DESIGN: Longitudinal study. METHODS: Twenty-one patients (six women) (21 feet) (average age 46. 9 +/- 6. 4 years) with recalcitrant calcific insertional Achilles tendinopathy were treated surgically with removal of the calcific deposit; the Achilles tendon was reinserted with bone anchors. RESULTS: At an average follow-up of 48. 4 months, one patient necessitated a further operation. Eleven patients reported an excellent result, and five a good result. The remaining five patients could not return to their normal levels of sporting activity and kept fit by alternative means. The results of the VISA-A questionnaire were markedly improved in all patients, {{from an average of}} 62. 4 % to 88. 1 %. CONCLUSIONS: We recommend <b>disinsertion</b> of the Achilles tendon to excise the calcific deposit fully and reinsertion of the Achilles tendon in the calcaneus with suture anchors.

40|$|Purpose: To {{compare the}} {{outcomes}} of surgical procedures {{in the treatment of}} inferior oblique muscle overaction (IOOA) as a common disorder of ocular motility. Methods: This retrospective study was performed on patients with primary and secondary IOOA who underwent three surgical treatment procedures including <b>disinsertion,</b> myectomy and anterior transposition, between 2001 and 2011. Type of strabismus, ocular alignment, presence of pre-and post-operative dissociated vertical deviation (DVD), pre- and post-operative degree of IOOA were obtained using specified checklist. Results: A total of 122 eyes of 74 patients with mean age of 13 ± 11. 7 (range, 1 - 51) years were included in this study. <b>Disinsertion</b> was performed on 12 eyes (9. 8 %), myectomy in 91 eyes (74. 6 %) and anterior transposition in 19 (15. 6 %). Preoperative V-pattern and DVD existed in 67 and 17 eyes; after surgery they remained in only 10 and 8 eyes, respectively. The success rate (IOOA <+ 1), in <b>disinsertion,</b> myectomy and anterior transposition groups were 91. 7 %, 97. 8 %, and 89. 5 %, respectively and these measures did not change after 6 months. Overall, 53. 3 % (n = 65) and 38. 5 % (n = 47) of eyes had preoperative esotropia and exotropia. Preoperative hypertropia and hypotropia were observed in 16. 4 % (n = 20) and 3. 3 % (n = 4) of eyes, respectively. After surgery there were no cases of additional strabismus. However, residual hypertropia was seen in 9 eyes, while preoperative hypotropia increased in one patient who underwent anterior transposition surgery.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{describe}} the previously unreported managed ment of the eyelid anomalies associated with blepharo-cheilo-dontic syndrome. Blepharo-cheflo-dontic syndrome is a syndrome of congenital cleft lip/palate, oligodontia, euryblepharon, eyelid ectropion, and lagophthalmos. METHODS: Case report. A 3 -month-old male presented with bilateral {{upper and lower}} eyelid ectropion with eyelid retraction, marked euryblepharon, severe lagophthalmos, and a right side cleft lip/palate. Lateral tarsal strips, lower eyelid retractor <b>disinsertion,</b> myocutaneous advancement of the cheek and eyelids, and lateral tarsorrhaphy were performed. RESULTS: Correction of the ectropion, eyelid retraction, euryblepharon, and marked improvement in his lagophthalmos were achieved postoperatively. No recurrence of the ectropion or euryblepharon has been noted after 6 months of follow-up. CONCLUSION: Appropriate reconstructive surgery of the eyelids reduces the morbidity associated with the eyelid anomalies and provides an excellent cosmetic result for patients with blepharo-cheilo-dontic syndrome.

40|$|Summary. Correcting {{entropion}} and ectropion successfully requires {{knowledge of}} the eyelid problems, because understanding of these abnormalities {{is a key to}} planning a successful surgi-cal procedure. Entropion is a condition in which the eyelid margin turns inwards against the globe. It is divided into following categories: congenital and acquired, which may be involutional or cica-tricial. Ectropion is a malposition in which the lid falls away or is pulled away from its normal apposition to the globe. The condition is classified as congenital and acquired, which is divided into following categories: involutional, cicatricial, paralytic, and mechanical. Therefore, there are some common anatomic changes for both entropion and ectropion as well as specific changes that are unique to each eyelid malposition. Typically, instability of the eyelid is caused by either horizontal laxity or <b>disinsertion</b> or at-tenuation of the lower eyelid retractors to the inferior tarsal border, so surgical procedures should be directed at correcting the horizontal and vertical instability of the lid. Classification, etiology, underlying anatomic changes in the lid, principles of surgical treatment of entropion and ectropion are reviewed in this article...|$|E
30|$|Results During {{the study}} period, 165 {{patients}} underwent cardiac surgery.

The diagnosis was based on CT imaging showing a defect in the postero-lateral abdominal wall by <b>disinsertion</b> of the lumbar origin of transverse, internal and external oblique muscles. A few months after the trauma, it became gradualy more painful, the hernia was clinically increased with a large swelling on the right flank majored by valsalva. CT imaging showed herniation of the right colic flexure through the defect. Eight months after the trauma, we performed an intra-abdominal laparoscopic approach. Herniated structures were reduced and we opened the peritoneum. The defect was repaired by placing a pre-peritoneal polypropylene mesh fixed by laparoscopic staples before closing the peritoneum. The patient had an uneventful recovery. Ten weeks after the surgery the result was clinically very good. The CT scanner showed a good recovery of parietal continuity. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Sarcomas of {{the soft}} tissue {{constitute}} a fairly rare group of neoplasms localized mainly {{at the level of}} the extremities, Apart from clinical and semeiotic investigations, diagnosis is based on imaging techniques, Among these (ultrasound, CT, NMR and angiography), all of which are helpful in diagnosis, NMR seems to provide the most complete data and sensitivity and specificity. In fact, it has greater specificity than ultrasound or CT as regards identification of any infiltration of the muscle or deep interstitial tissues and can also contribute information on the nature of the sarcoma, as it provides high definition of the structural composition of the tissues, Angiography remains important as a preoperative guide to the surgical approach, Surgery is the treatment of choice, although in recent years it has been integrated with radio or chemotherapy, Thanks to the progress in treatment constituted by combination treatments there has been a dramatic reduction in the need for amputations, compartmental excision and <b>disinsertion</b> of muscle groups. We report the case of a patient with fibrosarcoma of the thigh and discuss the various imaging techniques and different approaches to the treatment of these neoplasms...|$|E
40|$|Background. Heart {{disease is}} the leading cause of nonobstetric {{mortality}} in pregnant women. Because of high risk, medical management represents the first line of treatment. However, when medical treatment fails, cardiac surgery becomes necessary. Case Presentation. A 27 -year-old female who underwent successfully cardiac surgery three times within 3 years. At the first time, she had an aortic valve replacement at 25 weeks of gestation after an infectious endocarditis complicated with an ischemic stroke. At 39 weeks of gestation, she had delivered, vaginally, a healthy baby boy weighing 2800 [*]g. In the second time, pregnant again at 30 weeks of gestation, she had a mitral valve replacement with an aortic prosthesis reinforcement after a paraprosthetic regurgitation and a mitral vegetation. A fetal death in utero had occurred; the extraction of the fetus by cesarean section with a tubal ligation was performed after stabilization of the mother. In the third time, she underwent successfully a mitral prosthesis replacement with Bentall’s procedure after a mitral prosthesis <b>disinsertion</b> with an abscess of aortic annulus due to new episode of infectious endocarditis. Conclusion. Our patient has assembled almost all poor prognosis factors, which makes her a real historic case, probably never described in the literature...|$|E
40|$|The {{blepharoplasty}} {{has been}} performed with great frequency {{due to the}} appreciation of aesthetic surgery. The complications related to this procedure are rare. This case report aims to emphasize complications that can occur. T. J. S. P., 45 years old, female, white, resident of Botucatu City, presented dermatocalase bilaterally. We opted to perform upper blepharoplasty bilateral, by removing skin and fat of the upper eyelid. In the postoperative period was observed left eyelid ptosis. We decided to reinsert the levator muscle of the left upper eyelid. One month after the ptosis correction, retraction was observed in both upper eyelid. The patient was then submitted to surgery for the correction of eyelid retraction by <b>disinsertion</b> of the muscle of Muller. Two months after this last surgery, the patient presented right eyelid ptosis and worsening of eyelid retraction to the left. New surgery for correction of the eyelid retraction was made, using free graft sclera for elongation of the left eyelid levator muscle, with good results. The authors presented a patient who underwent a blepharoplasty and developed ptosis in the post-operative period, followed by eyelid retraction. These two possibilities may occur as a complication of blepharoplasty and the surgeon must be careful to handle in an appropriate way, {{in order to get}} the result that the patient expects to have...|$|E
