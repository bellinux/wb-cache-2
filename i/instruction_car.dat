Latest trends in the mobile phone and PDA community (e. g. games and MMS) emphasize the demand for a better support of such rich graphical data that is scalable over multiple platforms. In this paper we present mobile services for the automotive after sales market that support the user in coping with the increasing functionality and complexity of cars and their repair procedures. We introduce a generic framework to support the retrieval and visualization of operating <b>instructions</b> and <b>car</b> repair information according to the device, enduser (or consumer of the data) and car repair guidelines.

40|$|There {{is growing}} {{evidence}} suggesting that the magnitude of cortisol awaking response (CAR), which {{is characterized by a}} profound increase of salivary cortisol secretion after awakening, plausibly reflects the level of a chronic stress, social stress, anxiety, etc. In this study the alternation of CAR at the start {{and at the end of}} two weeks session of self-instruction for good sleep was investigated; by which we anticipated that the self-instruction for good sleep would bring-forth a positive affection for the participants, and would result in decline of cortisol awakening response (CAR). Nevertheless, as a result unexpectedly, subjects did not change their sleep and dietary habits along with the instruction, moreover the increased CAR was observed. This result implies that the suggestion of an impractical instruction would solely be taken as a stressful task for participants, even though they know that it is effective to improve their sleep. On the contrary, if one develops an instruction with practicable indication for daily life, it is highly possible to observe a positive effect of the <b>instruction</b> on <b>CAR.</b> 1...|$|R

40|$|The {{subject of}} this study is about the {{influence}} of network structure and road classification on road safety. Road safety, or unsafety, is usually expressed as the number of crashes or casualties. It is not evident how one can relate what happens at street level to the decisions regarding network design and the elaboration of this design. Traffic circulation can be regarded as the link between these two levels. Behind traffic circulation is the individual who decides to travel from a point of origin to a destination, using a particular route. The route is the starting point for this study. That is because network structure and road classification are important preconditions for traffic circulation and route choice, while the intersecting routes will determine the crash locations. This study will therefore focus on the effects of changing route choices on road safety. The changes in route choice may be the result of: 1. (intended) changes {{in the structure of the}} road network; 2. a change in traffic circulation, e. g. on account of an alteration of a traffic signal system or of congestion on the main roads; 3. <b>instructions</b> to <b>car</b> drivers through navigation systems or route guidance signs. These changes, adaptations and instructions aim to improve the traffic and transport system as a whole. This study is undertaken to find the effect of the changes/instructions enumerated above on the safety of all road users in the road network. This study will show whether an improvement can be attained and how it can be attained. In this study, an attempt was made to connect different worlds; the world of transport network design, the world of route choice research, the world of micro-simulation modelling, and finally, the world of surrogate safety measures (conflict indicators).

40|$|In late 2005, the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) {{contracted}} the Center for Archaeological Research at the University of Texas at San Antonio (CAR-UTSA) to conduct significance testing at 41 TV 410 and 41 TV 540, two prehistoric archeological sites {{located in the}} floodplain of Onion Creek in southeast Austin in Travis County. The work was conducted in advance of a borrow pit excavation related to the construction on State Highway (SH) 130. The borrow pit represented a project specific location (PSL). PSLs are normally {{not part of the}} project per Federal Highway Administration policy. PSLs are the responsibility of the contractor in most cases. However, the testing reported here was mandated by language of the SH 130 comprehensive development agreement. Significance testing was performed late in 2005 and early in 2006. For 41 TV 540, Dr. Raymond Mauldin served as Principal Investigator and Jennifer Thompson served as the Project Archeologist. At 41 TV 410, Dr. Mauldin served as Project Archeologist and Dr. Steve Tomka served as Principal Investigator. The archeological work at these sites was not under the purview of either Section 106 or the Antiquities Code of Texas. The work was not conducted under a Texas Antiquities Permit. However, testing at both sites was conducted in accordance with the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards and Guidelines for Archeology and Historic Preservation and guidelines provided by the Texas Historical Commission (THC). CAR completed fieldwork in early January of 2006. At 41 TV 410, 11 features were uncovered with radiocarbon dates that fell in the Early/Middle Archaic and in the Late Archaic. Recovery of artifacts and ecofacts was extremely low. The 41 TV 540 work also produced a low density of chipped stone artifacts and tools, and exposed 17 features, many of which dated to the close of the Early Archaic. Preliminary observations on flotation returns suggested good quantities of burned material and faunal remains were present at 41 TV 540. CAR prepared post-field reports summarizing the work and provided recommendations for both sites. Because both locations appeared to contain intact deposits that could, in our view, contribute {{to an understanding of the}} prehistoric cultural development of the region, CAR recommended that the sites were eligible to the NRHP under criterion d. TxDOT agreed with CAR recommendations that 41 TV 540 was eligible for listing in the NRHP, though they did not request any additional work at the site. TxDOT concluded that site 41 TV 410 was not eligible for listing on the NRHP. At TxDOT’s <b>instruction,</b> <b>CAR</b> prepared a research design for the analysis of the testing data from 41 TV 540, as well as a summary of the 41 TV 410 work. That document (Tomka et al. 2007), which outlined a series of analyses including several new geomorphic studies and a project area geomorphic synthesis, served as a guideline for the present document. Since the archeological and geomorphological investigations reported here, the construction of SH 130 has been completed and deposits containing the sites discussed have been removed. All artifacts, notes, photos, and other material associated with the project are stored at CAR. At this time, decisions regarding the disposal of selected artifact classes, as well as the location for permanent curation of the remaining artifacts and associated records, have not been made. However, it is expected that all project related records and artifacts retained will be permanently curated at CAR...|$|E
50|$|Driving on Ice: To {{simulate}} the icy conditions of winter within the summer driving season, a hydraulic skid car is employed. The hydraulic car {{is set to}} raise {{one end of the}} car via remote control. After being given skid <b>car</b> <b>instructions</b> by a veteran ice driving instructor, the contestants take on a simple challenge in the skid car: they must simply go downhill in the skid car in what is more or less a straightaway in park in front of a wall, being fully aware that the skid car may activate during the trip (the twist is, of course, that it will not activate at any point during the run). Marnie (who took the longest to learn in the lesson), confident in her belief that any skid on ice will result in a car crash, is completely surprised at the result - a perfect run, showing her that she needn't drive in fear of an ice skid. The single run shoots her confidence through the roof. As for Jason (the only other driver whose run is shown), he believes that he would skid into the wall, and thus accelerates into the wall to regain control. This destroys the skid car.|$|R
