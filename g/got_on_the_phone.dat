Robin George recruited Tart after seeing him perform live at JBs in Dudley with Alabama Bombshell, a new project was underway to re-record some of Robin's songs that artists such as, Glenn Hughes, Ruby Turner, Robert Plant and coincidentally Sean Harris had previously recorded. Between 1992 -1996 they toured the UK, performed a live TV appearance on The James Whale show, and Radio 1 sessions with Tommy Vance under the name Life before releasing an album entitled Cocoon. Nick left the music business in 1997 but joined a new band in 2003.

[...] In a 1968 article written for Hit Parader magazine, Zappa wrote that when Wilson heard these songs, [...] "he was so impressed he <b>got</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> and called New York, and as a result I got a more or less unlimited budget to do this monstrosity." [...] Freak Out! is an early example of the concept album, a sardonic farce about rock music and America. [...] "All the songs on it were about something", Zappa wrote in The Real Frank Zappa Book. [...] "It wasn't as if we had a hit single and we needed to build some filler around it. Each tune had a function within an overall satirical concept." ...|$|E

The staff's back-up magician, David Blaine, was unavailable for shooting as well. Series creator Chris Carter, however, later stated that the show would not take no for an answer: [...] "We <b>got</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> with him. He agreed to come to our offices to talk about the script and ended up doing some card tricks for us that reduced Frank and I to being six-year-olds again." [...] Jay eventually agreed to do the part, but requested that he only do the tricks he was accustomed to doing. Thus, many of Jay's trademark tricks were included in the episode's script. Gilligan, in retrospect, later noted, [...] "There was no choice other than Ricky Jay as far as we were concerned. He was not looking forward to the idea of playing a magician because I think he felt that magicians were never portrayed very realistically in movies or television shows." ...|$|E

500|$|It {{was around}} this time that Nirvana's Nevermind was making waves in the rock and pop scene.

Yankovic later said, [...] "I wanted to make sure that when I came back after that long hiatus, it was with something strong, and it wasn't until Nirvana that I felt I had a real contender."

Welling told TV Guide that he turned down the lead role twice, but after reading the script, decided to take the job. Like Christopher Reeve, he was not a Superman fan prior to being cast as Clark Kent. In fact, he said, he continues to not read Superman comics: [...] "I made a conscious decision to stay away from that material. We're doing something different at a time before all that, I don't want that to affect what I'm doing, even subconsciously."

500|$|The band Nirvana {{started to}} become a name in the music scene at the time, {{creating}} [...] "big, seismic shifts in pop culture" [...] according to Yankovic. Yankovic felt that the band's 1991 album Nevermind, which featured [...] "Smells Like Teen Spirit", was [...] "really great", but feared that at its release the band was not popular enough to warrant a parody. By early 1992, Nevermind had reached platinum certification and led the Billboard charts, which led Yankovic to start working on a parody. Yankovic noted {{that much of the}} publicity around Nevermind dealt with the inability to comprehend the songs' lyrics, both in their phrasing {{and the manner in which}} they were sung by the lead vocalist Kurt Cobain. Yankovic decided to use this as the basis for his parody. Yankovic noted, [...] "I try not to go the obvious route all the time, but sometimes the most obvious is actually the best." [...] Yankovic had initial difficulty getting permission for the parody, as his manager claimed he was unable to get through to the group numerous times. When Yankovic learned that Nirvana would be performing <b>on</b> <b>the</b> January 11, 1992 show of Saturday Night Live, he called his UHF co-star, Victoria Jackson, at the time a regular cast member of the show. Jackson <b>got</b> Cobain <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> so that Yankovic could make his request. Cobain agreed, though initially he inquired if the song would be about food, a common theme in many of Yankovic's songs. Yankovic explained that the song would be about Cobain's incomprehensible lyrics, to which Cobain replied, according to Yankovic, [...] "Oh, sure, of course, that's funny." ...|$|R

The resulting choppy, pixelated imagery makes it appear as if the software that rendered the final video made output a low-resolution, artifact-heavy product.

I <b>got</b> busy <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> trying to put it together, and somehow we did it the next day in New York. I shot all the extra components the following week in L.A." [...] Elderkin felt the visual technique was perfect for portraying the tone of the introductory track. [...] "I wanted to use technique in a more of strategic way, using calculated moshes, colors and textures to complement the effect. Different parts of the songs represented different feelings, and I wanted to come with a visual representation of the flow and textures that are I feel are very important in this song." [...] Following its completion, the music video was released ahead of schedule after they learned that the technique used within it had been employed in another video by the Brooklyn-based electronic group Chairlift.|$|R
5000|$|After {{the death}} of Lois Roden and probate of her estate in January 1987, Howell {{attempted}} {{to gain control of}} Mount Carmel Center by force. George Roden had dug up the casket of Anna Hughes from the Davidian cemetery and had challenged Howell to a resurrection contest to prove who was the rightful heir to the leadership. Howell instead went to the police and claimed Roden was guilty of corpse abuse, but the county prosecutors refused to file charges without proof. On November 3, Howell and seven armed companions attempted to access the Mount Carmel chapel, with the goal of photographing the body in the casket as evidence to incriminate Roden. Roden was advised of the interlopers and grabbed an Uzi in response. The Sheriff's Department responded about 20 minutes into the gunfight, during which Roden was wounded. Sheriff Harwell <b>got</b> Howell <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> and told him to stop shooting and surrender. Howell and his companions, dubbed the [...] "Rodenville Eight" [...] by the media, were tried for attempted murder on April 12, 1988; seven were acquitted and the jury was hung <b>on</b> Howell's verdict. <b>The</b> county prosecutors did not press the case further. While waiting for the trial, Roden was put in jail under contempt of court charges because of his use of foul language in some court pleadings, threatening the Texas court with sexually transmitted diseases if the court ruled in favor of Howell. The next day, Perry Jones and a number of Howell's other followers moved from their headquarters in Palestine, Texas, to Mount Carmel. In mid-1989, Roden used an axe to kill a Davidian named Wayman Dale Adair, who visited him to discuss Adair's vision of being God's chosen messiah. He was found guilty under an insanity defense and was committed to a mental hospital. Shortly after Roden's commitment, Howell raised money to pay off all <b>the</b> back taxes <b>on</b> Mount Carmel owed by Roden and took legal control of the property.|$|R

Unfortunately for Yankovic, the new album hit several snags. On November 26, 1991, Michael Jackson's new album, Dangerous was released. After hearing the hit single [...] "Black or White," [...] Yankovic {{approached}} Jackson about a potential parody entitled [...] "Snack All Night." [...] Although Jackson was a big supporter of Yankovic's work, he felt that a parody might damage the song's message. Jackson told Yankovic that he could, if he wanted to, parody another song off his album, but just not [...] "Black or White".Yankovic soon turned his attention in another direction. Guns N' Roses had just released a version of Wings's 70's hit [...] "Live and Let Die". Yankovic approached Paul McCartney, leader of Wings, about a parody idea entitled [...] "Chicken Pot Pie." [...] Although McCartney was a supporter of Yankovic's work and he wanted to give Yankovic the chance to parody one of his songs, he begrudgingly turned him down due to the fact that, as a vegetarian, he could not condone the eating of animal flesh. Yankovic, a fellow vegetarian, has stated that he respects McCartney's decision.It was around this time that Nirvana's Nevermind was making waves in the rock and pop scene.
