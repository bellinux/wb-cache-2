500|$|Two {{hundred years}} after Johnson's death, the posthumous {{diagnosis}} of Tourette syndrome became widely accepted. The condition was unknown during Johnson's lifetime, but Boswell describes Johnson displaying signs of Tourette syndrome, including tics and other involuntary movements. According to Boswell [...] "he commonly held <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> side... moving his body backwards and forwards, and rubbing {{his left knee}} in the same direction, {{with the palm of}} his hand... e made various sounds" [...] like [...] "a half whistle" [...] or [...] "as if clucking like a hen", and [...] "... all this accompanied sometimes with a thoughtful look, but more frequently with a smile. Generally when he had concluded a period, {{in the course of a}} dispute, by which time he was a good deal exhausted by violence and vociferation, he used to blow out his breath like a Whale." [...] There are many similar accounts; in particular, Johnson was said to [...] "perform his gesticulations" [...] at the threshold of a house or in doorways. When asked by a little girl why he made such noises and acted in that way, Johnson responded: [...] "From bad habit." [...] The diagnosis of the syndrome was first made in a 1967 report, and Tourette sundrome researcher Arthur K. Shapiro described Johnson as [...] "the most notable example of a successful adaptation to life despite the liability of Tourette syndrome". Details provided by the writings of Boswell, Hester Thrale, and others reinforce the diagnosis, with one paper concluding: ...|$|E
2500|$|.....while talking or even musing {{as he sat}} in his chair, he {{commonly}} held <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> side towards his right shoulder, and shook it in a tremulous manner, moving his body backwards and forwards, and rubbing his left knee in the same direction, with the palm of his hand. In the intervals of articulating he made various sounds with his mouth; sometimes giving a half whistle, sometimes making his tongue play backwards from the roof of his mouth, as if clucking like a hen, and sometimes protruding it against his upper gums in front, as if pronouncing quickly under his breath, 'Too, too, too.' All this accompanied sometimes with a thoughtful look, but more frequently with a smile. Generally when he had concluded a period, {{in the course of a}} dispute, by which time he was a good deal exhausted by violence and vociferation, he used to blow out his breath like a Whale.|$|E
60|$|Pat Hawe cocked <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> side, like a vulture {{about to}} strike with his beak, and cunningly eyed Madeline.|$|E
60|$|Spinkie {{treated the}} {{question}} with calm contempt, turned <b>his</b> <b>head</b> languidly <b>to</b> <b>one</b> side, and scratched himself.|$|R
60|$|Here Rollo laid <b>his</b> <b>head</b> down <b>to</b> <b>one</b> side, {{and placed}} his hand under it, {{as if it were}} a pillow, and then shut his eyes.|$|R
60|$|Then Wang heard, {{much more}} faint, a voice {{he had never}} heard before--a novel {{impression}} which he acknowledged by cocking <b>his</b> <b>head</b> slightly <b>to</b> <b>one</b> side.|$|R
60|$|He made {{a certain}} move {{of his hand}} and the canine {{suddenly}} sat upon his haunches and cocked <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> side.|$|E
60|$|Then John Crumb slowly {{arose from}} his chair, {{and stood up}} at his full height. 'I hove,' said he, {{swinging}} <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> side.|$|E
6000|$|Poker sprang forward, wagging {{the stump}} of his tail, and turned <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> side, {{as if to}} say: [...] "Well, what's up? Any fun going?" ...|$|E
60|$|The pouch {{fell from}} the table and his pipe went down. <b>His</b> <b>head</b> leaned <b>to</b> <b>one</b> side and found the chair rail, and he knew nothing more.|$|R
60|$|Our hero was {{prepared}} for it. He put <b>his</b> <b>head</b> quickly <b>to</b> <b>one</b> side, let the blow pass, and {{with his left hand}} lightly tapped the bridge of his opponent's nose.|$|R
50|$|The dog {{can turn}} <b>his</b> <b>head</b> {{slightly}} <b>to</b> <b>one</b> side, turn the <b>head</b> completely over <b>to</b> the side, or turn completely around {{so that the}} back and tail is facing whoever the dog is calming. This {{is one of the}} signals seen most of the time in dogs.|$|R
60|$|The {{boatswain}} {{was quite}} taken aback. He {{opened his eyes}} wide with surprise, and putting <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> side, gazed earnestly and long at the boy {{as if he had}} been a rare old painting.|$|E
6000|$|... "Jove!" [...] Mulhall muttered {{under his}} breath. [...] "A long-legged Napoleon the Third, but burnt out, baked, and fire-crackled. And mangy! No wonder he crooks <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> side. He's {{got to keep}} the balance." ...|$|E
6000|$|Understanding at {{once the}} purpose for which I had been called, I kneeled at the head while the Indian kneeled at the feet. Grasping the {{shoulders}} carefully I waited for a word or look from Big Otter, but instead he turned <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> side and uttered the single word,--"Come!" ...|$|E
25|$|Babs used exposed chains (covered by a fairing) to take {{power to}} the drive wheels. It has been rumored that the high engine cover {{required}} Parry-Thomas <b>to</b> drive with <b>his</b> <b>head</b> tilted <b>to</b> <b>one</b> side. This story is not true; photographs show that the driver could see straight ahead.|$|R
6000|$|Suddenly R.C. stopped short, with <b>his</b> <b>head</b> turning <b>to</b> <b>one</b> side, and {{his body}} stiffening. [...] "I heard that whistle again," [...] he said. We stood {{perfectly}} motionless for a long moment. Then from far off in the forest I heard a high, clear, melodious, bugling note. How thrilling, how lonely a sound! ...|$|R
60|$|Here another blank, intelligibly enough {{made up by}} {{the speaker}} {{touching}} his own neck with his left fore-finger, and leaning <b>his</b> <b>head</b> a little <b>to</b> <b>one</b> side.|$|R
6000|$|Once more {{he spread}} his black wings and flew down to the egg. He cocked <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> side and looked at it. He cocked {{his head to the}} other side and looked at it. He walked all around it, chuckling and saying to himself, [...] "Pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty and all mine, mine, mine, mine! Pretty, pretty, and all mine!" ...|$|E
6000|$|So {{they got}} some {{paper and a}} pen, and the king he set down and twisted <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> side, and chawed his tongue, and scrawled off something; and then they give the pen to the duke--and then {{for the first time}} the duke looked sick. But he took the pen and wrote. So then the lawyer turns to the new old gentleman and says: ...|$|E
60|$|What {{then could}} be done? Godfrey peered over the edge. The man was {{swinging}} {{not more than}} two feet below its brink, that is to say, the updrawn loop of his stout leather belt, to which the rope was fastened, was about that distance from the brink, and {{on either side of}} it he hung down like a sack tied round the middle, quite motionless in his swoon, <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> side and his feet to the other.|$|E
60|$|Myrtle stared a moment, as {{if trying}} to realize what that meant. The tiny Mumbles, sitting beside the chair with <b>his</b> <b>head</b> cocked <b>to</b> <b>one</b> side, {{suddenly}} made a prodigious leap and landed in Myrtle's lap, where he began licking her chin and wagging his stumpy tail as if seconding the invitation. As the girl stroked his soft hair her eyes filled with tears.|$|R
25|$|Still another tale {{states that}} on one occasion, Parvati's used bath-water {{was thrown into}} the Ganges, and this water was drunk by the {{elephant}}-headed Goddess Malini, who {{gave birth to a}} baby with four arms and five elephant heads. The river goddess Ganga claimed him as her son, but Shiva declared him to be Parvati's son, reduced <b>his</b> five <b>heads</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> and enthroned him as the controller of obstacles (Vignesha).|$|R
60|$|The man {{lay on the}} floor, {{stretched}} out grotesquely, <b>his</b> <b>head</b> bent over <b>to</b> <b>one</b> side. Nothing moved or stirred. The room was completely silent, except, of course, for the ticking of the clock.|$|R
60|$|Then {{he struck}} out with his left--being an apt pupil--but Dromas drew back and the blow did not reach him. Then {{he struck out}} smartly with his right, but the Hellene put <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> side and let it pass. Again he struck out rapidly, one hand after the other, without much care whether the blows were light or heavy. Dromas evaded both without guarding, and, in reply, gave the Thuler a smartish touch on his unfortunate nose.|$|E
60|$|Mooween is {{something}} of a humorist in his own way. When not hungry he will go {{out of his way to}} frighten a bullfrog away from his sun-bath on the shore, for no other purpose, evidently, than just to see him jump. Watching him thus amusing himself one afternoon, I was immensely entertained by seeing him turn <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> side, and wrinkle his eyebrows, as each successive frog said ke'dunk, and went splashing away over the lily pads.|$|E
6000|$|... "War," [...] he was saying, [...] "is not necessary. War is not necessary. I hope I {{make myself}} clear. War is not necessary; {{it depends on}} {{nationality}}, but nationality is not necessary." [...] He inclined <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> side, [...] "Why do we have nationality? Let us do away with boundaries--let us have the warfare of commerce. If I see France looking at Brighton"--he laid his head upon one side, and beamed at Shelton,--"what do I do? Do I say 'Hands off'? No. 'Take it,' I say--take it!'" [...] He archly smiled. [...] "But {{do you think they}} would?" ...|$|E
60|$|Whether Crusoe {{thought of}} that or not we cannot say, but he looked up in his master's face as he spoke, cocked his ears very high, and turned <b>his</b> <b>head</b> slowly <b>to</b> <b>one</b> side, until it could not turn any further in that direction; then he turned it {{as much to the}} other side, whereat his master burst into an {{uncontrollable}} fit of laughter, and Crusoe immediately began barking vociferously.|$|R
6000|$|... "Strike me blind, but you're a 'ustler," [...] he said admiringly, <b>his</b> <b>head</b> cocked <b>to</b> <b>one</b> side, as {{his host}} bustled about. [...] "You never 'ort to 'ave gone Klondiking. It's {{the keeper of}} a pub' you was laid out for. An' it's often as I 'ave 'eard the lads up an' down the river speak o' you, but I 'adn't no idea you was so jolly nice." ...|$|R
60|$|Presently {{the huge}} buzzard, the leader, raised <b>his</b> hoary <b>head.</b> He {{saw the man}} nailed to the tree. The bird bent <b>his</b> <b>head</b> wisely <b>to</b> <b>one</b> side, and then lightly lifted himself into the air. He sailed round the glade, over the {{fighting}} buzzards, over the spring, and over the doomed renegade. He flew out of the glade, and in again. He swooped close to Girty. His broad wings scarcely moved as he sailed along.|$|R
6000|$|But wonderful, sumptuous, {{and every}} way {{satisfactory}} though that feast was, it bore no comparison whatever to another feast carried {{on at the}} same time by another party, about fifty yards off, where the carcase of the hippopotamus had been left half in and half out of the water--for, of course, being fully more than a ton in weight, {{only a small portion of}} the creature was appropriated by the canoe-men. The negroes paid no attention whatever to this other festive party; but in a short time Disco turned <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> side, and said--"Wy, wot's that splashin' I hears goin' on over there?" ...|$|E
60|$|The {{individual}} to whom Lowten alluded, was a little, yellow, high-shouldered man, whose countenance, from his habit of stooping forward when silent, Mr. Pickwick had not observed before. He wondered, though, {{when the old}} man raised his shrivelled face, and bent his gray eye upon him, with a keen inquiring look, that such remarkable features could have escaped his attention for a moment. There was a fixed grim smile perpetually on his countenance; he leaned his chin on a long, skinny hand, with nails of extraordinary length; and as he inclined <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> side, and looked keenly out from beneath his ragged gray eyebrows, there was a strange, wild slyness in his leer, quite repulsive to behold.|$|E
60|$|Four or {{five times}} I have sat thus in my canoe while Mooween passed close by, and never {{suspected}} my presence till a chirp drew his attention. It is curious at such times, {{when there is no}} wind to bring the scent to his keen nose, to see him turn <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> side, and wrinkle his forehead in the vain endeavor to make out the curious object there in the grass. At last he rises on his hind legs, and stares long and intently. It seems as if he must recognize you, with his nose pointing straight at you, his eyes looking straight into yours. But he drops on all fours again, and glides silently into the thick bushes that fringe the shore.|$|E
60|$|Be this as it may, Bladud had {{not been}} long seated there {{in a state of}} dreamy abstraction, when he became {{conscious}} of the inquiring look. Returning it with interest, but without speaking, he gazed steadily into the soft brown eyes that were turned up to his. At last the prince opened his lips, and the dog, turning <b>his</b> <b>head</b> slightly <b>to</b> <b>one</b> side with a look of expectancy, cocked his ears.|$|R
6000|$|... "Madame von Furstenburg, I {{feel the}} {{greatest}} pleasure in seeing you. My greatest pleasure {{is to be}} surrounded by my friends. Madame von Furstenburg, I trust that your amiable and delightful family are quite well. [The party passed on.] Cravatischeff!" [...] continued his Highness, inclining <b>his</b> <b>head</b> round <b>to</b> <b>one</b> of <b>his</b> aides-de-camp, [...] "Cravatischeff! a very fine woman is Madame von Furstenburg. There are few women whom I more admire than Madame von Furstenburg.|$|R
60|$|It {{was just}} at that spot where riders, unable to get further, are for ever {{wheeling}} their horses for another turn; and there Ferrand, the bird of passage, with <b>his</b> <b>head</b> a little <b>to</b> <b>one</b> side, watched them cantering, trotting, wheeling up and down.|$|R
