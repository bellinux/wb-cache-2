50|$|Recent {{research}} by Zamora et al. (2006) {{has revealed that}} the desert finch is {{more closely related to}} the <b>greenfinches</b> of the genus Carduelis (or Chloris, if Carduelis is split up) as indicated by DNA sequence analysis, vocalizations, and the presence of a black eye-stripe. Genetically, it seems very close to the common ancestor of the <b>greenfinches.</b> It may be that the latter evolved from a desert form and later developed the green plumage, or that the common ancestor of the <b>greenfinches</b> and the desert finch (which lived around 6 million years ago) was a species of semiarid habitat which subsequently diverged into a truly desert-adapted lineage, today represented by the desert finch, and the ancestor of a woodlands lineage, the <b>greenfinches.</b> The distinctness of the desert finch from the other Rhodopechys species was recognized as early as 1888 by Sharpe, {{but it was not until}} recently that its true affinities were determined.|$|R
2500|$|The name <b>Greenfinch</b> {{applied to}} the women's UDR comes from the system of radio [...] "appointment titles" [...] (codewords) used by the army to {{identify}} certain people or branches of the service.

40|$|Abstract The {{evolutionary}} history of {{three out of}} four birds traditionally classified into the genus Rhodopechys birds has been studied by comparing their mitochondrial cytochrome b DNA sequence with that of <b>greenfinches</b> and other genus Carduelis finches. The desert finch (Rhodopechys obsoleta) or a sister extinct species seems to have existed about 6 million years ago in Asian and perhaps African desert-like areas. This bird has no molecular relationship with other Rhodopechys birds and seems to have given rise to the <b>greenfinches</b> radia-tion, probably by allopatry of marginal or isolated groups; the latter would have evolved to green plumage colours and more simple song modulations (i. e., green-finches). The possible role of assortative mating and the newly postulated acquired phenotypic characters in <b>greenfinches</b> speciation are discussed...|$|R
2500|$|The Vireo (named after a Latin word {{thought to}} mean <b>Greenfinch)</b> {{was built to}} Air Ministry {{specification}} 17/25, intended to evaluate both all-metal aircraft and low powered, catapult launched, carrier borne fighters. [...] It was a low-winged single-engined monoplane of rather angular appearance with a flat-sided, deep fuselage except immediately aft of the engine. [...] Forward of the overwing open cockpit the nose fell away, giving it a slightly humped look. [...] The flying surfaces were all without external bracing; the wing was tapered, of deep section and incorporated twin machine guns. [...] The horizontal stabiliser had a straight leading edge but tapered at the rear. [...] There was a square topped, balanced rudder but no fin.|$|E

25|$|The protozoal {{parasite}} Trichomonas gallinae {{was known}} to infect pigeons and raptors but beginning in Britain in 2005, carcases of dead European <b>greenfinches</b> and chaffinches {{were found to be}} infected with the parasite. The disease spread and in 2008 infected carcases were found in Norway, Sweden and Finland and a year later in Germany.

6000|$|Bright and genial {{were all}} {{the last days of}} June, when I loitered in the lanes before the unwished day of my return to London. During this quiet, {{pleasant}} time the <b>greenfinch</b> was perhaps more to me than any other songster. In the village itself, with the adjacent lanes and orchards, this pretty, seldom-silent bird was the most common species. The village was his metropolis, just as London is ours--and the sparrow's; its lanes were his streets, its hedges and elm trees his cottage rows and tall stately mansions and public buildings. [...] . We frequently find the predominance of one species somewhat wearisome. Speaking for myself, there are songsters that are best appreciated when they are limited in numbers and keep their distance, but of the familiar, unambitious strains of swallow, robin, and wren I never tire, nor, during these days, could I have too much of the <b>greenfinch,</b> low as he ranks among British melodists. Tastes differ; that is a point on which we are all agreed, and every one of us, even the humblest, is permitted to have his own preferences. Still, after re-reading Wordsworth's lines to [...] "The Green Linnet," [...] it is curious, to say the least of it, to turn to some prosewriter--an authority on birds, perhaps--to find that this species, whose music so charmed the poet, has for its song a monotonous croak, which it repeats at short intervals for hours without the slightest variation--a dismal sound which harmonizes with no other sound in nature, and suggests nothing but heat and weariness, and is of all natural sounds the most irritating. To this writer, then--and there are others to keep him in countenance--the <b>greenfinch</b> as a vocalist ranks lower than the lowest. One can only wonder (and smile) at such extreme divergences. To my mind all natural sounds have, in some measure an exhilarating effect, and I cannot get rid of the notion that so it should be with every one of us; and when some particular sound, or series of sounds, that has more than this common character, and is distinctly pleasing, is spoken of as nothing but disagreeable, irritating, and the rest of it, I am inclined to think that {{there is something wrong with}} the person who thus describes it; that he is not exactly as nature would have had him, but that either during his independent life, or before it at some period of his prenatal existence, something must have happened to distune him. All this, I freely confess, may be nothing but fancy. In any case, the subject need not keep us longer from the greenfinch--that is to say, my <b>greenfinch</b> not another man's.|$|E

[...] Mr. Delegorgue [...] "Chir! Chir! Chir!" [...] His note suggested to me the shrill chirrup of a sparrow, and his appearance that of a <b>greenfinch.</b>|$|E
60|$|What {{the charm}} {{may have been}} in these several cases, beyond mere novelty, we cannot even conjecture. Colour, however, {{sometimes}} comes into play; for in order to raise hybrids from the siskin (Fringilla spinus) and the canary, it is much the best plan, according to Bechstein, to place birds of the same tint together. Mr. Jenner Weir turned a female canary into his aviary, where there were male linnets, goldfinches, siskins, greenfinches, chaffinches, and other birds, in order to see which she would choose; but there never was any doubt, and the <b>greenfinch</b> carried the day. They paired and produced hybrid offspring.|$|E

60|$|Of bird {{music by}} day there was little; you would {{hear more of}} it in one morning in that small rustic village in Berkshire where {{the first part of}} this book was written than in a whole summer in one of these West Cornwall villages, so few {{comparatively}} are the songsters. Nor was this scarcity in the village only; it was everywhere, as I found when able to get out for a few hours during my two spring seasons in the place. Close by were the extensive woods of Trevalloe, where I was struck by the extraordinary silence and where I listened in vain for a single note from blackcap, garden-warbler, willow-wren, wood-wren, or redstart. The thrushes, chaffinch, chiff-chaff, and <b>greenfinch</b> were occasionally heard; outside the wood the buntings, chats, and the skylark were few and far between.|$|E
6000|$|The {{fact was}} that this Sunday walk through the fields was fraught with great {{excitement}} to Marty and Tommy, who saw a perpetual drama {{going on in the}} hedgerows, and could no more refrain from stopping and peeping than if they had been a couple of spaniels or terriers. Marty was quite sure he saw a yellow-hammer on the boughs of the great ash, and while he was peeping, he missed the sight of a white-throated stoat, which had run across the path and was described with much fervour by the junior Tommy. Then there was a little <b>greenfinch,</b> just fledged, fluttering along the ground, and it seemed quite possible to catch it, till it managed to flutter under the blackberry bush.
