5|$|The Blue-Green rivalry often <b>erupted</b> <b>into</b> gang warfare, {{and street}} {{violence}} {{had been on}} the rise in the reign of Justin I (r. 518–527), who took measures to restore order, when the gangs murdered a citizen in the Hagia Sophia. Riots culminated in the Nika riots of 532 AD during the reign of Justinian, which began when the two main factions united and attempted unsuccessfully to overthrow the emperor.|$|E
5|$|Tooth {{eruption}} may {{be altered}} by some environmental factors. When eruption is prematurely stopped, the tooth {{is said to}} be impacted. The most common cause of tooth impaction is lack of space in the mouth for the tooth. Other causes may be tumors, cysts, trauma, and thickened bone or soft tissue. Tooth ankylosis occurs when the tooth has already <b>erupted</b> <b>into</b> the mouth but the cementum or dentin has fused with the alveolar bone. This may cause a person to retain their primary tooth instead of having it replaced by a permanent one.|$|E
5|$|Within Mexico, {{tensions}} continued between federalists and centralists. In early 1835, wary Texians formed Committees of Correspondence and Safety. The unrest <b>erupted</b> <b>into</b> {{armed conflict}} in late 1835 at the Battle of Gonzales. This launched the Texas Revolution, {{and over the}} next two months, the Texians defeated all Mexican troops in the region. Texians elected delegates to the Consultation, which created a provisional government. The provisional government soon collapsed from infighting, and Texas was without clear governance for the first two months of 1836.|$|E

5|$|As a {{manufacturing}} center, Pittsburgh also became an arena for intense labor strife. During the Great Railroad Strike of 1877, Pittsburgh workers protested and had massive demonstrations that <b>erupted</b> <b>into</b> widespread violence, {{known as the}} Pittsburgh Railway Riots. Militia and federal troops were called {{to the city to}} suppress the strike. Forty men died, most of them workers, and more than 40 buildings were burned down, including the Union Depot of the Pennsylvania Railroad. Strikers also burned and destroyed rolling stock: more than 100 train engines and 1000 railcars were destroyed. It was the city with the most violence of any affected by the strikes.|$|E
5|$|Dissatisfaction {{with this}} state of affairs {{continued}} to loom over Nerva's reign, and ultimately <b>erupted</b> <b>into</b> a crisis in October 97, when members of the Praetorian Guard, led by Casperius Aelianus, laid siege to the Imperial Palace and took Nerva hostage. He was forced to submit to their demands, agreeing to hand over those responsible for Domitian's death and even giving a speech thanking the rebellious Praetorians. Titus Petronius Secundus and Parthenius were sought out and killed. Nerva was unharmed in this assault, but his authority was damaged beyond repair. Shortly thereafter he announced the adoption of Trajan as his successor, and with this decision all but abdicated.|$|E
5|$|Edward's reign {{was marked}} by {{economic}} problems and social unrest that in 1549 <b>erupted</b> <b>into</b> riot and rebellion. An expensive war with Scotland, at first successful, ended with military withdrawal from Scotland and Boulogne-sur-Mer in exchange for peace. The transformation of the Church of England into a recognisably Protestant body also occurred under Edward, who took great interest in religious matters. Although his father, HenryVIII, had severed {{the link between the}} Church and Rome, HenryVIII had never permitted the renunciation of Catholic doctrine or ceremony. It was during Edward's reign that Protestantism was established {{for the first time in}} England with reforms that included the abolition of clerical celibacy and the Mass and the imposition of compulsory services in English.|$|E

5|$|Harith {{was from}} the Tamim tribe {{belonging}} to the north Arab (Mudari) tribal supergroup, and hailed from Basra, where his father, Surayj, lived. He is first mentioned in 729, when he distinguished himself for his bravery and self-sacrifice against the Turgesh, saving the Arab army from annihilation at Baykand near Bukhara. Harith is next mentioned in 733, when he led a protest in Lower Tokharistan against the commandeering of supplies from the province, already plagued by drought and famine, to feed the capital of Khurasan at Marw, by the governor Junayd ibn Abd al-Rahman al-Murri. Junayd had Harith flogged, but after Junayd died in early 734, the discontent <b>erupted</b> <b>into</b> an open rebellion, with Harith at its head.|$|E
5|$|In 1821, after {{tensions}} between the NWC and HBC had <b>erupted</b> <b>into</b> violence the NWC was forced to merge into the HBC. As a result, the HBC acquired the Columbia District and its trade with China. At first the system of shipping furs via the American Perkins and Company was continued, but in 1822 the United States Customs Service imposed a heavy ad valorem duty on the proceeds. The HBC stopped using American middlemen and instead tried selling furs through the EIC. In 1824 and 1825 the HBC sold 20,000 beaver and 7,000 land-otter skins in China through the EIC, but the arrangement did not prove advantageous for either firm.|$|E

5|$|The {{tensions}} {{between these two}} competing historical and cultural traditions <b>erupted</b> <b>into</b> political and social conflict during the Ukrainian crisis, which began when then Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych refused to sign an association agreement with the European Union on 21 November 2013. Support for closer ties with Europe was strong in western and central Ukraine, whilst many in eastern and southern Ukraine traditionally favoured stronger relations with Russia. President Yanukovych, who drew most of his support from eastern regions, was forced out of office in February 2014. His ouster was followed by protests in eastern and southern Ukraine that placed {{a strong emphasis on}} the importance of historical ties to Russia, the Russian language, and antipathy towards the Euromaidan movement.|$|E
5|$|Douglas-Home {{accepted}} the foreign affairs portfolio in Heath's shadow cabinet. Many expected {{this to be}} a short-lived appointment, a prelude to Douglas-Home's retirement from politics. It came at a difficult time in British foreign relations: events in the self-governing colony of Rhodesia (formerly Southern Rhodesia), which had been drifting towards crisis for some years, finally <b>erupted</b> <b>into</b> open rebellion against British sovereignty. The predominantly white minority government there opposed an immediate transfer to black majority rule before the colony had achieved sovereign statehood, and in November 1965 it unilaterally declared independence. Douglas-Home won the approval of left-wing Labour MPs such as Wedgwood Benn for his unwavering opposition to the rebel government, and for ignoring those on {{the right wing of the}} Conservative party who sympathised with the rebels on racial grounds.|$|E
5|$|Erzherzog Ferdinand Max {{was laid}} {{down at the}} Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino {{shipyard}} in Trieste on 6 May 1863. She was launched on 24 May 1865; the builders were forced to complete fitting-out work quickly, as tensions with neighboring Prussia and Italy <b>erupted</b> <b>into</b> the concurrent Austro-Prussian War and the Third Italian War of Independence in June 1866. Erzherzog Ferdinand Maxs rifled heavy guns were still on order from Krupp, and {{they could not be}} delivered due to the conflict with Prussia. Instead, the ship was armed with old smooth-bore guns. Rear Admiral Wilhelm von Tegetthoff, the commander of the Austrian Fleet, immediately began to mobilize his fleet. As the ships became fully manned, they began to conduct training exercises in Fasana. With his flag aboard Erzherzog Ferdinand Max, Tegetthoff brought the Austrian fleet to Ancona on 26 June in an attempt to draw out the Italians, but the Italian commander, Admiral Carlo Pellion di Persano, refused to engage Tegetthoff. Tegetthoff made another sortie on 6 July, but again could not bring the Italian fleet to battle.|$|E

5|$|Further controversies have {{occurred}} {{because of the}} company's involvement in the Middle East. The opening of a Burger King location in the Israeli-occupied territories led to a breach of contract dispute between Burger King and its Israeli franchise; the dispute eventually <b>erupted</b> <b>into</b> a geopolitical conflagration involving Muslim and Jewish groups on multiple continents over the application of and adherence to international law. The case eventually elicited reactions from {{the members of the}} 22-nation Arab League; the Islamic countries within the League made a joint threat to the company of legal sanctions including the revocation of Burger King's business licenses within the member states' territories. A second issue involving members of the Islamic faith over the interpretation of the Muslim version of Canon Law, Shariah, regarding the promotional artwork on a dessert package in the United Kingdom raised issues of cultural sensitivity, and, with the former example, posed a larger question about the lengths that companies must go to insure the smooth operation of their businesses in the communities they serve.|$|E

The KNUP adopted a logo which was similar to a former logo of FUNCINPEC, featuring the Cambodian Independence Monument.
