25|$|During sexual {{intercourse}} in the missionary position, the penis is in preferential {{contact with the}} anterior wall of the vagina and {{the tip of the}} penis reaches the anterior <b>fornix,</b> while in the rear-entry position it is in preferential contact with the posterior wall of the vagina and probably reaches the posterior <b>fornix.</b>|$|E
25|$|Placing the woman's legs on or {{over the}} man's {{shoulders}} provides the deepest possible penetration. This variant is sometimes called the anvil. This position aims {{the head of the}} penis at the vaginal <b>fornix</b> (posterior <b>fornix).</b> When the legs are held mid-level in this way, the penis can achieve significant depth while attempting to stimulate the G-Spot and achieving more friction on the top of its shaft.|$|E
25|$|Projections {{to areas}} rostral to the {{hypothalamus}} are {{carried by the}} mammillothalamic tract, the <b>fornix</b> and terminal stria.|$|E
25|$|Separating the {{anterior}} horns of the lateral ventricles is the septum pellucidum: a thin, triangular, vertical membrane which runs as a sheet from the corpus callosum {{down to the}} <b>fornix.</b> During the third month of fetal development, a space forms between two septal laminae, known as the cave of septum pellucidum (CSP), which is a marker for fetal neural maldevelopment. During the fifth month of development, the laminae start to close and this closure completes from about {{three to six months}} after birth. Fusion of the septal laminae is attributed to rapid development of the alvei of the hippocampus, amygdala, septal nuclei, <b>fornix,</b> corpus callosum and other midline structures. Lack of such limbic development interrupts this posterior-to-anterior fusion, resulting in the continuation of the CSP into adulthood.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} {{and shape of}} the ventricular system relates to the differential development of different parts of the brain, with the ventricular system ultimately arising from the neural tube. The lateral ventricles remain connected to the third ventricle throughout development, themselves developing as outpouchings from the third ventricle. The foramina develop slowly in a forward and outward direction as the <b>fornix</b> grows in size.|$|E
25|$|Some {{believe that}} the AFE zone is the {{anterior}} <b>fornix</b> itself, but it is thought by some sex experts to be a degenerated female prostate (a theory that {{has been applied to}} the G-spot and the Skene's gland) or the area where the vaginal nerves connect, which is thought to be near it. Speculation is that it is the vesicouterine pouch, due to its proximity to the supposed location of the AFE zone and the supposed erogenous qualities of the rectouterine pouch.|$|E
25|$|The {{safe and}} {{effective}} sphere (still popular and easy to use) was supplemented with the pyramid or COI implant. The COI has unique design elements that have been incorporated into an overall conical shape, including a flat anterior surface, superior projection and preformed channels for the rectus muscles. 5-0 Vicryl suture needles can be passed with slight difficulty straight through the implant to be tied on the anterior surface. In addition, this implant features a slightly recessed slot for the superior rectus and a protrusion to fill the superior <b>fornix.</b>|$|E
25|$|The AFE zone is {{reported}} to be located at or near the deepest point on the anterior wall of the vagina, above the cervix, where the anterior wall of the vagina starts to curve upward (the entrance to the anterior <b>fornix),</b> but some websites and news articles have described it as being on the posterior wall of the vagina, roughly opposite of the G-spot. Dr. Chua Chee Ann stated in an interview that this is completely wrong. Some believe that this area may be a different erogenous zone altogether.|$|E
25|$|The first {{recorded}} Roman triumphal arches {{were set up}} in the time of the Roman Republic. Generals who were granted a triumph were termed triumphators and would erect fornices or honorific arches bearing statues to commemorate their victories. A number of fornices were built in Rome during the Republican era. Lucius Steritinus erected two in 196 BC to commemorate his victories in Hispania. Another <b>fornix</b> was built on the Capitoline Hill by Scipio Africanus in 190 BC, and Quintus Fabius Maximus Allobrogicus constructed one in the Roman Forum in 121 BC. None of them survive today and little is known about their appearance.|$|E
25|$|About {{the fifth}} month a ring-like {{constriction}} marks {{the position of}} the cervix of the uterus, and after the sixth month the walls of the uterus begin to thicken. For a time the vagina is represented by a solid rod of epithelial cells. A ring-like outgrowth of this epithelium occurs {{at the lower end of}} the uterus and marks the future vaginal <b>fornix.</b> At about the fifth or sixth month the lumen of the vagina is produced by the breaking down of the central cells of the epithelium. The hymen represents the remains of the Müllerian eminence.|$|E
25|$|Another case {{described}} {{the onset of}} anterograde amnesia {{as a result of}} cell death in the <b>fornix,</b> another structure that carries information from the hippocampus to the structures of the limbic system and the diencephalon. The patient in this case did not show any disconnection syndrome, which is unexpected since the structures involved divide the brain hemispheres (both sides of her brain were able to communicate). Instead, she showed signs of amnesia. The final diagnosis was made by MRI. This particular amnesic syndrome is difficult to diagnose and often is misdiagnosed by physicians as an acute psychiatric disorder.|$|E
25|$|The {{motility}} of a nonintegrated artiﬁcial eye may {{be caused}} by at least two forces. (1) The rubbing force between the posterior surface of the artiﬁcial eye and the conjunctiva that covers the implant may cause the artiﬁcial eye to move. Because this force is likely to be approximately equal in all directions, it would cause comparable horizontal and vertical artiﬁcial eye amplitudes. (2) An artiﬁcial eye usually ﬁts snugly in the conjunctival space (possibly not in the superior <b>fornix).</b> Therefore, any movement of the conjunctival fornices will cause a similar movement of the artiﬁcial eye, whereas lack of movement of the fornices will restrict its motility.|$|E
25|$|The human vagina is {{an elastic}} muscular canal that {{extends from the}} vulva to the cervix. It is reddish pink in color, and it connects the outer vulva to the cervix of the uterus. The part of the vagina {{surrounding}} the cervix is called the <b>fornix.</b> The opening of the vagina lies near {{the middle of the}} perineum, between the opening of the urethra and the anus. The vaginal canal then travels upwards and backwards, between the urethra at the front, and the rectum at the back. Near the upper vagina, the cervix protrudes into the vagina on its front surface at approximately a 90 degree angle. The vaginal and urethral openings are protected by the labia.|$|E
25|$|Willis was {{the first}} to number the cranial nerves in the order in which they are now usually {{enumerated}} by anatomists. He noted the parallel lines of the mesolobe (corpus callosum), afterwards minutely described by Félix Vicq-d'Azyr. He seems to have recognised the communication of the convoluted surface of the brain and that between the lateral cavities beneath the <b>fornix.</b> He described the corpora striata and optic thalami; the four orbicular eminences, with the bridge, which he first named annular protuberance; and the white mammillary eminences, behind the infundibulum. In the cerebellum he remarks the arborescent arrangement of the white and grey matter and gives a good account of the internal carotids and the communications which they make with the branches of the basilar artery.|$|E
25|$|The {{pathophysiology}} of anterograde amnesic syndromes {{varies with}} the extent of damage and the regions {{of the brain that}} were damaged. The most well-described regions indicated in this disorder are the medial temporal lobe (MTL), basal forebrain, and <b>fornix.</b> Beyond the details described below, the precise process of how we remember– on a micro scale– remains a mystery. Neuropsychologists and scientists are still not in total agreement over whether forgetting is due to faulty encoding, accelerated forgetting, or faulty retrieval, although a great deal of data seem to point to the encoding hypothesis. In addition, neuroscientists are also in disagreement about the length of time involved in memory consolidation. Though most researchers, including Hasselmo et al., have found the consolidation process is spread out over several hours before transitioning from a fragile to a more permanent state, others, including Brown et al., posit that memory consolidation can take months or even years in a drawn-out process of consolidation and reinforcement. Further research into the length of time of memory consolidation will shed more light on why anterograde amnesia sometimes affects some memories gained after the event(s) that caused the amnesia, but does not affect other such memories.|$|E
500|$|Several other {{connections}} play {{important roles}} in hippocampal function. [...] Beyond the output to the EC, additional output pathways go to other cortical areas including the prefrontal cortex. [...] A major output goes via the <b>fornix</b> to the lateral septal area and to the mammillary body of the hypothalamus (which the <b>fornix</b> interconnects with the hippocampus). The hippocampus receives modulatory input from the serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine systems, and from the nucleus reuniens of the thalamus to field CA1. [...] A very important projection comes from the medial septal nucleus, which sends cholinergic, and gamma amino butyric acid (GABA) stimulating fibers [...] (GABAergic fibers) to {{all parts of the}} hippocampus. [...] The inputs from the medial septal nucleus {{play a key role in}} controlling the physiological state of the hippocampus; [...] destruction of this nucleus abolishes the hippocampal theta rhythm and severely impairs certain types of memory.|$|E
500|$|The {{parts of}} the brain most {{affected}} by rotational forces are the midbrain and diencephalon. [...] It is thought that the forces from the injury disrupt the normal cellular activities in the reticular activating system located in these areas, and that this disruption produces the loss of consciousness often seen in concussion. [...] Other areas of the brain that may be affected include {{the upper part of the}} brain stem, the <b>fornix,</b> the corpus callosum, the temporal lobe, and the frontal lobe. Angular accelerations of 4600, 5900, or 7900 radian/s2 are estimated to have 25, 50, or 80% risk of MTBI respectively.|$|E
500|$|The hippocampus, {{including}} the dentate gyrus, has {{the shape of}} a curved tube, which has been compared to a seahorse, and a ram's horn (Cornu Ammonis). Its abbreviation CA is used in naming the hippocampal subfields: CA1, CA2, CA3, and CA4. It can be distinguished as an area where the cortex narrows into a single layer of densely packed pyramidal neurons, which curl into a tight U shape. One edge of the [...] "U," [...] – CA4, is embedded into the backward-facing, flexed dentate gyrus. The hippocampus is described as having an anterior and posterior part (in primates) or a ventral and dorsal part in other animals. Both parts are of similar composition but belong to different neural circuits. In the rat, the two hippocampi resemble a pair of bananas, joined at the stems by the commissure of <b>fornix</b> (also called the hippocampal commissure). In primates, the part of the hippocampus at the bottom, near the base of the temporal lobe, is much broader than the part at the top. This means that in cross-section the hippocampus can show a number of different shapes, depending on the angle and location of the cut.|$|E
2500|$|In its unexcited state, {{the vagina}} is a {{collapsed}} tube, with the anterior and posterior walls placed together. The lateral walls, especially their middle area, are relatively more rigid. Because of this, the collapsed vagina has a H-shaped cross section. Behind, the inner vagina {{is separated from}} the rectum by the recto-uterine pouch, the middle vagina by loose connective tissue, and the lower vagina by the perineal body. [...] Where the vaginal lumen surrounds the cervix of the uterus, it is divided into four continuous regions or vaginal fornices; these are the anterior, posterior, right lateral, and left lateral fornices. The posterior <b>fornix</b> is deeper than the anterior <b>fornix.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{anterior}} <b>fornix</b> erogenous zone (also {{known as}} the AFE zone, AFE, A-spot, epicenter, deep spot or second [...] G-spot) is reportedly a female erogenous zone that when stimulated can lead to rapid vaginal lubrication and arousal, sometimes without {{any other form of}} stimulation, with continued stimulation resulting in an intense orgasm.|$|E
2500|$|The {{interventricular}} foramina are {{two holes}} ( [...] , pl. foramina) that connect the lateral ventricles {{on the left}} and the right to the third ventricle. They are located on the underside near the midline of the lateral ventricles, and join the third ventricle where its roof meets its anterior surface. In front of the foramen is the <b>fornix</b> and behind is the thalamus. The foramen is normally crescent-shaped, but rounds and increases in size depending on the size of the lateral ventricles.|$|E
2500|$|The {{superior}} region comprises {{two elements}} that were linked {{during a long}} time and were later wrongly separated: the nucleus anterior and the nucleus superficialis, or superior (previous nucleus lateralis dorsalis). The nucleus anterior, divided into several entities in non-human species, is undivided in man. The two, anterior and superficial, nuclei are separated from the lateral and medial regions by the lamella superior and are everywhere surrounded by a capsule of white matter, including the lamina terminalis. The second nucleus (superficialis or superior) is posterior and in succession to the first. The two are constituted in the same manner. The main difference is their mode of afference. Both receives information from the subiculum of the hippocampus but in one case indirectly and in the other directly. The efferent axons of the subiculum follow the <b>fornix.</b> At the anterior part of the <b>fornix,</b> part of them go down to the mammillary body. The neurons of the mammillary bodies give axons forming the thick and dense mamillo-thalamic tract (of Vicq d'Azyr), which ends in the nucleus anterior. Another part of the subicular axons does not end in the mamillary body as, {{at the level of the}} foramen of Monro, they turn posteriorly. Some of them end into the anterior nucleus but a great quantity end in the nucleus superficialis. The selective target of the efferent axons from the anterior nucleus is the anterior cingulate cortex, that of the superfial nucleus is the posterior cingulate, with some overlap. The axons of these parts of the cingulate cortex, linked through the large cingulum (longitudinal bundle located at the base of the cingulate cortex), return to the parahippocampal gyrus. This circuit referred to as the Papez circuit (1937) was said by its author to be the substrate for emotion. There have been many further other elaborations (including the [...] "limbic system"). Papez' circuit was in fact not close (at hippocampal level). In addition, the second nucleus, the superficial nucleus, not taken into consideration, has similar connections and participates in other close or linked circuits. The better known effect of the lesion of mamillary bodies, of the mamillothamic bundle and the <b>fornix,</b> if bilateral, is a particular (anterograde) amnesia (Korsakoff syndrom).|$|E
2500|$|Poreh et al. {{describe}} {{a case study}} of patient A.D., whose damage to the <b>fornix</b> rendered the hippocampus useless, but spared adjacent cortical areas– a fairly rare injury. When the patient was given a test with something with which [...] he had some familiarity, the patient was able to score well. In general, however, A.D. had severely impaired episodic memory, but had some ability to learn semantic knowledge. Other studies show animals with similar injuries can recognize objects with which they are familiar, but, when the objects are presented in an unexpected context, they do not score well on recognition tests.|$|E
2500|$|Desmond Morris {{proposed}} that orgasm might facilitate conception by exhausting the female and keeping her horizontal, thus preventing the sperm from leaking out. This possibility, {{sometimes called the}} [...] "Poleaxe Hypothesis" [...] or the [...] "Knockout Hypothesis", [...] is now considered highly doubtful. A 1994 Learning Channel documentary on sex had fiber optic cameras inside the vagina of a woman while she had sexual intercourse. During her orgasm, her pelvic muscles contracted and her cervix repeatedly dipped into a pool of semen in the vaginal <b>fornix,</b> as if to ensure that sperm would proceed by the external orifice of the uterus, making conception more likely.|$|E
2500|$|The {{far more}} {{imposing}} Porta Ticinese completed in 1817 {{is based on}} an even grander design by Luigi Cagnola. It has a rather simplistic appearance with symmetrical frontages towards the city and the countryside consisting of an Ionic peristasis supporting a triangular tympanum in pink Baveno granite. Initiated under French rule and completed under the Austrian Restoration, like the Arco della Pace it underwent a number of modifications. The name changed from Porta Marengo (in memory of the Battle of Marengo to its present name with an inscription calling for peace between nations. The Porta Vercellina, later named the Porta Magenta and demolished in 1885, was built and designed by Luigi Canonica in 1805 [...] It was a triumphal arch with a single <b>fornix</b> flanked by two rows of Ionic columns and decorated with bas-reliefs in 1859.|$|E
2500|$|Roman triumphal {{practices}} {{changed significantly}} {{at the start}} of the imperial period when the first Roman Emperor Augustus decreed that only emperors would be granted triumphs. The term <b>fornix</b> abruptly ceased to be used and was replaced by arcus, from which the English word [...] "arch" [...] is derived. Whereas Republican fornices were put up at the initiative and expense of the triumphator, without needing or requesting permission, imperial triumphal arches were erected for the triumphator by decree of the senate. The triumphal arch changed from being a personal monument to being an essentially propagandistic one, serving to announce and promote the presence of the ruler and the laws of the state. Arches were not necessarily built as entrances, but – unlike many modern triumphal arches – they were often erected across roads and were intended to be passed through, not round.|$|E
2500|$|Damage to {{different}} areas of the brain can have varied effects on memory. [...] The temporal lobes, {{on the sides of the}} brain, contain the hippocampus and amygdala, and therefore have a lot to do with memory transition and formation. [...] Patients who have had injury to this area have experienced problems creating new long-term memories. [...] For example, the most studied individual in the history of brain research, HM, retained his previously stored long-term memory as well as functional short-term memory, but was unable to remember anything after it was out of his short-term memory. [...] A patient whose <b>fornix</b> was damaged bilaterally suffered severe anterograde amnesia but no effect on any other forms of memory or cognition. [...] In the fictional case of a patient with a cherry-sized tumor pressing on the temporal lobe of his brain, he temporarily suffered total retrograde amnesia, even after surgery was performed to remove the tumor. [...] However, with time, he was not only able to remember everything starting after the surgery, but childhood memories, up to age 12, all returned with clarity.|$|E
50|$|During sexual {{intercourse}} in the missionary position, {{the tip of}} the penis reaches the anterior <b>fornix,</b> while in the rear-entry position it reaches the posterior <b>fornix.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>fornix</b> is {{a bundle}} of nerve tracts made of white matter. It is crucial in normal {{cognitive}} functions. Harm to the <b>fornix</b> can result in amnesia.|$|E
50|$|The <b>fornix</b> is a C-shaped {{bundle of}} axons that {{begins in the}} hippocampal {{formation}} of both hemispheres, {{referred to as the}} fimbria, and extend through the crus of <b>fornix,</b> also known as the posterior pillars. The fimbria section of the <b>fornix</b> is directly connected to the alveus, which is a portion of the hippocampal formation that arises from the subiculum and the hippocampus (specifically the CA1). Both crura of the <b>fornix</b> form intimate connections with the underside of the corpus callosum and support the hippocampal commissure, a large bundle of axon that connects the left and right hippocampal formations. The <b>fornix</b> {{plays a key role in}} hippocampal outputs, specifically in connecting CA3 to a variety of subcortical structures, and connecting CA1 and the subiculum to a variety of parahippocampal regions, via the fimbria. The <b>fornix</b> is also essential for hippocampal information input and neuromodulatory input, specifically from the medial septum, diencephalic brain structures, and the brain stem.|$|E
50|$|<b>Fornix</b> The <b>fornix</b> is {{the main}} output pathway from the {{hippocampus}} to the mammillary bodies. It {{has been identified as}} a main region in controlling spatial memory functions, episodic memory and executive functions.|$|E
50|$|The fibers {{begin in}} the {{hippocampus}} {{on each side of}} the brain as fimbriae; the separate left and right sides are each called the crus of the <b>fornix</b> (plural crura). The bundles of fibers come together in the midline of the brain, forming the body of the <b>fornix.</b> The lower edge of the septum pellucidum (the membrane that separates the lateral ventricles) is attached to the upper face of the <b>fornix</b> body.|$|E
5000|$|The fornices of {{the vagina}} (sing. <b>fornix</b> of the vagina or <b>fornix</b> vaginae) are the {{superior}} {{portions of the}} vagina, extending into the recesses created by the vaginal portion of cervix. The word [...] "fornix" [...] is Latin for [...] "arch".|$|E
50|$|The <b>fornix</b> (arch) is a C-shaped {{bundle of}} nerve fibers {{in the brain}} that acts as the major output tract of the {{hippocampus}}. The <b>fornix</b> also carries some afferent fibres to the hippocampus from structures in the diencephalon and basal forebrain. The <b>fornix</b> {{is part of the}} limbic system. While its exact function and importance in the physiology of the brain is still not entirely clear, it has been demonstrated in humans that surgical transection - the cutting of the <b>fornix</b> along its body - can cause memory loss. There is some debate over what type of memory is affected by this damage, but it has been found to most closely correlate with recall memory rather than recognition memory. This means that damage to the <b>fornix</b> can cause difficulty in recalling long-term information such as details of past events, but it has little effect on the ability to recognize objects or familiar situations.|$|E
50|$|The lateral {{portions}} {{of the body of}} the <b>fornix</b> are joined by a thin triangular lamina, named the psalterium (lyra). This lamina contains some commissural fibers that connect the two hippocampi across the middle line and constitute the commissure of <b>fornix</b> (also called the hippocampal commissure).|$|E
