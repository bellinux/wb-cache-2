40|$|While {{erythema}} nodosum is a nodular, <b>erythematous</b> <b>eruption</b> predominantly {{affecting the}} extensor {{aspects of the}} legs, breast abscesses {{are the result of}} relatively common bacterial infections, and only 2 studies have reported an association between erythema nodosum and breast abscesses. Here, we report the case of a patient with repeated erythema nodosum associated with subareolar abscesses. The patient was a 34 -year-old woman with painful erythematous nodules on her right shin, accompanied by an indurated lesion on her right breast 4 days before the onset of the nodules. Therefore, the patient underwent circumareolar incision, and consequently the painful erythematous nodules disappeared. However, after 39 days, the patient developed another tender, painful lesion in her right breast and painful erythematous nodules on her right shin. After another circumareolar incision, the painful erythematous nodules disappeared again. Therefore, we suggested a significant association between erythema nodosum and breast abscess in this patient. The most common underlying causative organism in breast abscess is Staphylococcus aureus; however, erythema nodosum has rarely been proven to be associated with staphylococcal infections. Therefore, the relationship between S. aureus and erythema nodosum is rather controversial. However, the resistance to the usual treatment methods and prolonged clinical course in our case suggest that the pathogenesis of erythema nodosum associated with breast abscesses might be {{different from that of the}} common form of erythema nodosum...|$|E
40|$|A 25 -year-old {{student had}} an <b>erythematous</b> <b>eruption</b> on his face, trunk and upper extremity. Initial maculo-papules evolved to target lesions with a {{vesicular}} center surrounded by alternating pale and dark rings. The eruption {{appeared at the}} dorsum of the hand and progressed proximally, four days after a flu-like episode, without use of drugs or medicines {{for a minimum of}} six-months. The changes were restricted to the skin, painless and mildly itching. More conspicuous lesions appeared on his right scapula, left shoulder, and the dorsum of the left hand (Figure 1). Previously, he was in good health, without a history of allergy or skin or mucosal disturbances. He denied alcoholism, tobacco smoking, use of illicit drugs, and vaccination. His girl friend had fever, fatigue, pharyngitis and lymphadenopathy shortly before the onset of his actual disease. Physical examination revealed the aforementioned skin changes, in addition to discrete bilateral posterior cervical lymphadenopathy, and a moderate nontender liver and spleen enlargement. The patient was eutrophic and afebrile, with no ocular, oral, nasal, genital or anal lesions. In addition to routine laboratory tests, he underwent a skin biopsy aiming to clear the diagnosis. Blood determinations revealed leukocytosis, lymphocytosis and 12 % reactive lymphocytes. Except for a transient elevation of the aminotransferase levels, biochemical data were normal.

40|$|Terbinafine is an {{allylamine}} antifungal agent, {{effective in}} the treatment of dermatomycoses. Many cutaneous adverse reactions have been reported (in about 3 % of treated patients). Furthermore terbinafine has been associated with pustular eruptions, as well as the induction and exacerbation of pre-existing psoriasis and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP). AGEP is an uncommon aseptic pustular eruption, classified for many years as a pustular psoriasis, that usually follows recent administration of oral or parenteral drugs. The disease is most frequently triggered by antibiotics, most of all aminopenicillins and macrolides. Characteristic AGEP features include the sudden onset of fever above 38 C with widespread <b>erythematous</b> <b>eruption,</b> rapidly progressing to a fine, non-follicular, micropustular rash. Leucocytosis is generally present, sometimes associated with eosinophilia. The illness usually resolves spontaneously with the fever and the pustulation clearing within 15 days, sometimes followed by desquamation. Hystopathology shows non-follicular spongiotic pustules in the epidermis filled with neutrophils, a mixed perivascular infiltrate of neutrophils and occasional eosinophils with papillary dermal oedema. On this subject, Sideroff et al. recently elaborated a validation score based on morphology, histological criteria, and disease course. The pathogenetic mechanism which leads to the induction of AGEP by some medicines has still not been clarified, but T cells seem to play a crucial role. The authors report a case of a patient with terbinafine-induced AGEP and {{a review of the literature}} about this topic. The case illustrates once again the role of terbinafine in AGEP and reminds us that early diagnosis of AGEP is important to avoid unnecessary investigations and/or the administration of antibiotics...|$|E

30|$|Due to {{atmospheric}} pollution {{and changes in}} residential environments resulting from the rapid industrialization of modern society, {{the number of patients}} with atopic dermatitis has been recently increasing. Atopic dermatitis is a skin disease that may occur in any age group that is characterized by severe itch resulting from chronic inflammatory eczema. Genetic factors are strongly related to this disease, and stress, changes in external environments, and infection are major causes of atopic dermatitis aggravation. A major symptom of atopic dermatitis is severe itch, and this disease induces abrasions, <b>erythematous</b> <b>eruption,</b> blisters, and various lesions (Shultz and Hanifin 2002). Because the cause of the symptoms for atopic dermatitis has not been clearly established (Bos et al. 1992), studies of the cause have been unceasingly conducted. Although the management of environmental conditions that may be problematic and drug treatment centering on steroids and antihistamines are used as major treatment methods (Park et al. 2002), the symptoms of this disease are only temporarily relieved, and the aggravation and relief of symptoms are repeated. In addition, adverse affects to some external application products are emerging. Therefore, recent studies have mainly been conducted using products for external application containing oriental medicinal extracts with natural materials that enhance moisturizing effects as therapeutic agents for atopic dermatitis (Hong and Jung 2014). Although clinical effects from extracts from various natural products used as atopic dermatitis treatment materials have been demonstrated, no clear solution has been presented until now. Therefore, among the microorganisms that may be easily produced due to their ability to be cultured in large numbers, we aimed to identify the effects of the photosynthetic bacteria Rhodobacter sphaeroides on atopic dermatitis.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Background: In view {{of several}} studies {{highlighting}} an observation of an <b>erythematous</b> <b>eruption</b> {{in the vicinity}} of or distant from the lesion in melanoma patients (The Brenner sign), this study sought to assess whether this phenomenon might be related to the blood level of cytokines IL- 6 and IL- 8. Patients and Methods: Sera specimens obtained from 27 patients with melanoma, of which 15 had erythematous eruptions and 12 did not, were studied by immunohistochemistry for the expression of IL- 6 and IL- 8. Results: IL- 6 was detected in all melanoma patients in both groups. The mean level of IL- 6 in the redness group (2. 41 pg/L) was significantly higher than in the group without redness (1. 25 pg/L). IL- 8 was detected in all 27 melanoma patients in the two groups. The serum level was less than 5 pg/L in only 1 patient (6. 7 %) in the redness group, and in 6 patients (50 %) in the group without redness, a statistically significant difference. Conclusion: The Brenner sign appears to reflect a more advanced disease and herald a poor prognosis according to its correlation with the IL- 8 and IL- 6 blood level. However, in view of the biphasic effect of IL- 8 level on tumor progression, and IL- 6 ’s ability to inhibit early stage melanoma, redness in melanoma patients could be a sign of a better prognosis of the melanoma. The incidence of melanoma has steadily increased over the past few decades. It rose nearly 200 % in the United States among non-Hispanic whites from 7. 5 cases per 100, 000 in 1973 to 21. 9 cases per 100, 000 in 2002 (1). Among the factors accounting for the increased incidence is earlier and better diagnosis resulting from public health campaigns aimed at increasing awareness of the disease. New technologies and research on the pathogenesis of melanoma are enhancing the efforts to achieve earlier recognition. An observation of malignant melanoma patients presenting a reddish appearance not explicable by any medical cause including photosensitivity, called the Brenner sign, is gaining documentation from a number of studies (2, 3). The present study was undertaken to further determine the usefulness of this parameter in the diagnosis and prognosis of melanoma by assessing the serum levels of Interleukin 6 (IL- 6) and Interleukin 8 (IL- 8) in melanoma patients with and without the redness...|$|E

Some years later, we treated a young girl with recurrent, debilitating infections with purified MBL; this was also followed by a dramatic clinical improvement. We have now carried out a phase I clinical trial on 20 MBL-deficient, but healthy, adult volunteers. The MBL was prepared by the State Serum Institute in Copenhagen, Denmark, from blood donor plasma. Each volunteer received a total of 18 mg of MBL in three 6 -mg doses given intravenously once a week over 3 weeks. The volunteers were monitored closely after each infusion and no adverse clinical or laboratory effects were observed. Laboratory parameters included C-reactive protein, various complement components, and antibodies to MBL, HIV and hepatitis viruses. C 3 a (the anaphylotoxin derived from complement component C 3) was monitored for signs of complement activation, but no significant infusion-associated fluctuations were observed. Serum levels of MBL after each 6 -mg infusion ranged between 1200 and 2500 ng/ml. The half-life of the infused MBL was about 70 h, or 3 days.
