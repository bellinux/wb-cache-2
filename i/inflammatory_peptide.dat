50|$|C5a is {{a protein}} {{fragment}} released from cleavage of complement component C5 by protease C5-convertase into C5a and C5b fragments. C5b {{is important in}} late events of the complement cascade, an orderly series of reactions which coordinates several basic defense mechanisms, including formation of the Membrane Attack Complex (MAC), {{one of the most}} basic weapons of the innate immune system, formed as an automatic response to intrusions from foreign particles and microbial invaders. It essentially pokes microscopic pinholes in these foreign objects, causing loss of water and sometimes death. C5a, the other cleavage product of C5, acts as a highly <b>inflammatory</b> <b>peptide,</b> encouraging complement activation, formation of the MAC, attraction of innate immune cells, and histamine release involved in allergic responses. The origin of C5 is in the hepatocyte, but its synthesis can also be found in macrophages, where it may cause local increase of C5a. C5a is a chemotactic agent and an anaphylatoxin; it is essential in the innate immunity but it is also linked with the adaptive immunity. The increased production of C5a is connected with a number of inflammatory diseases.|$|E
40|$|AbstractSix {{members of}} the {{mammalian}} transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channels respond to varied temperature thresholds. The natural compounds capsaicin and menthol activate noxious heat-sensitive TRPV 1 and cold-sensitive TRPM 8, respectively. The burning and cooling perception of capsaicin and menthol demonstrate that these ion channels mediate thermosensation. We show that, in addition to noxious cold, pungent natural compounds present in cinnamon oil, wintergreen oil, clove oil, mustard oil, and ginger all activate TRPA 1 (ANKTM 1). Bradykinin, an <b>inflammatory</b> <b>peptide</b> acting through its G protein-coupled receptor, also activates TRPA 1. We further show that phospholipase C is an important signaling component for TRPA 1 activation. Cinnamaldehyde, the most specific TRPA 1 activator, excites a subset of sensory neurons highly enriched in cold-sensitive neurons and elicits nociceptive behavior in mice. Collectively, these data demonstrate that TRPA 1 activation elicits a painful sensation and provide a potential molecular model for why noxious cold can paradoxically be perceived as burning pain...|$|E

At concentrations as low as 1 – 10 nM, the LXA 4 and ATL analogues each inhibited TNF-α–stimulated superoxide anion generation and IL- 1 β release by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes. These LXA 4 -ATL actions were time and concentration dependent and proved selective for TNF-α, as these responses were not altered with either GM-CSF– or zymosan-stimulated cells. TNF-α–induced IL- 1 β gene expression was also regulated by both anti-LXA 4 receptor antibodies and LXA 4 -ATL analogues. In murine air pouches, 15 R/S-methyl-LXA 4 dramatically inhibited TNF-α–stimulated leukocyte trafficking, {{as well as the}} appearance of both macrophage <b>inflammatory</b> <b>peptide</b> 2 and IL- 1 β, while concomitantly stimulating IL- 4 in pouch exudates.

The complement system is a major participant in the inflammatory process and the complement activation component, C 5 a, is a potent <b>inflammatory</b> <b>peptide.</b> This study investigated the mRNA expression of the major receptor for C 5 a (C 5 aR; CD 88) in histopathological samples of canine mammary tumors by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) using canine-specific primers for CD 88. A total of seven canine mammary tumors (four malignant carcinomas, two benign mixed mammary tumors, and one myoepithelioma) and eight normal mammary glands were analysed. All the tumor samples expressed low levels of CD 88 mRNA, while none of the normal mammary tissues showed any detectable expression. These preliminary results suggest that C 5 a-CD 88 interaction may play a contributory role in the inflammatory response associated with mammary tumor development in dogs.

40|$|Pseudomonas aeruginosa {{keratitis}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} destructive diseases of the cornea. The host response to this infection is critical to the outcome. The cytokine interleukin- 10 (IL- 10) is thought to play an important role in modulating excessive inflammation and antimicrobial defenses. We have found that in IL- 10 −/− mice there is a significant decrease in bacterial load in corneas at 7 days postchallenge with P. aeruginosa. This decrease was accompanied by a reduction in neutrophil numbers in the cornea and changes in cytokine levels compared to those of wild-type mice. A characteristic increase in neovascularization in the cornea was found in the IL- 10 −/− mice. This increased angiogenesis correlated with an increased expression of KC, whereas the kinetics of macrophage <b>inflammatory</b> <b>peptide</b> 2 expression correlated with neutrophil numbers. This finding suggests that KC may play a role in corneal angiogenesis. The source of IL- 10 in mouse corneas was identified as a subpopulation of infiltrating cells and keratocytes. This study demonstrates that IL- 10 plays an important role in regulating the balance of inflammatory mediators during P. aeruginosa infection of the cornea...|$|E

This increase in cytoplasmic free [Ca 2 +] is concentration-dependent (ED 50 around 20 nM) and occurs in the absence of extracellular Ca 2 +. Activation of NG 115 - 401 L cells by the <b>inflammatory</b> <b>peptide</b> bradykinin generates inositol phosphates, which parallel increases in intracellular [Ca 2 +]. However, the rise in cytoplasmic [Ca 2 +] stimulated by thapsigargin occurs in the absence of detectable production of inositol phosphates. Thapsigargin is unlike phorboid tumour promoters in that it has no action on two non-invasive indicators of phorbol stimulation of these cells, i. e. [3 H]choline metabolite production and rise in intracellular pH. These data suggest that thapsigargin releases Ca 2 + from an intracellular store by a novel mechanism, independent of the hydrolysis of phosphoinositides and concomitant activation of protein kinase C. Thus thapsigargin may provide a valuable tool for the analysis of intracellular signalling mechanisms...|$|E

During sepsis, {{the vast majority of}} circulating leucocytes are neutrophils, with hardly any circulating monocytes, because these are known to migrate out of the circulation. This means that our measurements essentially targeted gene expression in neutrophils, whereas IL- 6 is mainly expressed in monocytes and TF in (sub)endothelium. In other words, despite high plasma protein levels of IL- 6 in sepsis, the actual gene expression in circulating leucocytes is expected to be very low. Another or contributory explanation could be that high blood levels of <b>inflammatory</b> <b>peptides</b> may result in homeostatic suppression of the associated genes.|$|R

However, FXII also contributes to the production of bradykinin, a short-lived <b>inflammatory</b> <b>peptide.</b> A growing body of mechanistic research from animal models indicates that FXII contributes to thrombotic disease by triggering excessive coagulation. FXII is evolutionarily conserved, suggesting that this molecule does have a physiologic function. This leads to intriguing questions: What does FXII really do?

Before the groundbreaking discovery of a role for FXII in thrombotic disease, many studies investigated the biochemical properties of FXII and its activators. In this review, we highlight several biochemical studies that reveal much about the natural behavior of FXII. On the basis of these findings, it is possible to draft a conceptual model to explain how FXII reacts to surface materials. We then discuss how this model applies to the activities of FXII in its natural environment. There are two tentative physiologic functions of FXII that can operate exclusively: (i) maintenance of thrombus stability; (ii) local regulation of vascular permeability. Either, or both, of these natural functions may explain the evolutionary development and maintenance of FXII...|$|E

Inflammatory cells infiltrate and initiate the development of fibrosis in the chronically hypertensive heart. In this study, we have investigated whether treatment with a selective C 5 aR antagonist prevents cardiovascular remodeling in deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA) -salt hypertensive rats. Control and DOCA-salt rats were treated with PMX 53 (AcF-[OPdChaWR], 1 mg. kg(- 1). d(- 1) oral gavage) for 32 days; structural and functional changes in cardiovascular system were determined. DOCA-salt hypertension increased leukocyte extravasation into ventricular tissue, increasing collagen deposition and ventricular stiffness; PMX 53 treatment attenuated these changes, thereby improving cardiac function. Further, treatment with PMX 53 suppressed an increased expression of C 5 aR in the left ventricle from DOCA-salt rats, consistent with the reduced infiltration of inflammatory cells. Vascular endothelial dysfunction in thoracic aortic rings was attenuated by PMX 53 treatment, but systolic blood pressure was unchanged in DOCA-salt rats. In the heart, PMX 53 treatment attenuated inflammatory cell infiltration, fibrosis, and ventricular stiffness, indicating that C 5 aR is critically involved in ventricular remodeling by regulating inflammatory responses in the hypertensive heart...|$|E

METHODS: Binding assays were performed on neutrophils to determine the presence of fMLRL in the amniotic fluid at the 17 th week of pregnancy, as well as at term, before and after the onset of labour. The expression of fMLP receptor mRNA was evaluated by RT-PCR, the cAMP level by a radiochemical assay, and the calcium concentration by Fura- 2 AM fluorescence measurement. RESULTS: fMLPRLs were detectable in amniotic fluid throughout pregnancy, and their levels did not vary during gestation. Labour significantly increased both the amniotic fMLPRL level and the expression of fMLP receptor in amnion tissue. The increased amniotic fMLPRL concentration noted during labour significantly increased neutrophil cAMP level and [Ca 2 +]i.

Based on the hypothesis that excessive complement activation may contribute to PM, in particular generation of the potent <b>inflammatory</b> <b>peptide</b> C 5 a, we investigated the role of C 5 a in the pathogenesis of PM in vitro and in vivo. Methodology and Principal Findings: Using primary human monocytes, the interaction between C 5 a and malaria in vitro was assessed.

Recent studies indicate, however, that UPEC can evade the early activation of urothelial innate immune response in vitro. In this study, we report that infection with the prototypic UPEC strain NU 14 suppresses tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) -mediated interleukin- 8 (CXCL- 8) and interleukin- 6 (CXCL- 6) secretion from urothelial cell cultures compared to infection with a type 1 piliated E. coli K- 12 strain. Furthermore, examination of a panel of clinical E. coli isolates revealed that 15 of 17 strains also possessed the ability to suppress cytokine secretion. In a murine model of UTI, NU 14 infection resulted in diminished levels of mRNAs encoding keratinocyte-derived chemokine, macrophage <b>inflammatory</b> <b>peptide</b> 2, and CXCL- 6 in the bladder relative to infection with an E. coli K- 12 strain. Furthermore, reduced stimulation of inflammatory chemokine production during NU 14 infection correlated with decreased levels of bladder and urine myeloperoxidase and increased bacterial colonization.

We applied different agonists that trigger [Ca 2 +]i oscillations and determined the involvement of connexin channels and subsequent effects on endothelial permeability in immortalized and primary brain endothelial cells. The <b>inflammatory</b> <b>peptide</b> bradykinin (BK) triggered [Ca 2 +]i oscillations and increased endothelial permeability. The latter was prevented by buffering [Ca 2 +]i with BAPTA, indicating that [Ca 2 +]i oscillations are crucial in the permeability changes. Bradykinin-triggered [Ca 2 +]i oscillations were inhibited by interfering with connexin channels, making use of carbenoxolone, Gap 27, a peptide blocker of connexin channels, and Cx 37 / 43 knockdown. Gap 27 inhibition of the oscillations was rapid (within minutes) and work with connexin hemichannel-permeable dyes indicated hemichannel opening and purinergic signaling in response to stimulation with BK. Moreover, Gap 27 inhibited the BK-triggered endothelial permeability increase in in vitro and in vivo experiments. By contrast, [Ca 2 +]i oscillations provoked by exposure to adenosine 5 ′ triphosphate (ATP) were not affected by carbenoxolone or Gap 27 and ATP did not disturb endothelial permeability.

In this report we assessed the impact of chronic leptin deficiency, using ob/ob mice, on pneumococcal pneumonia and examined whether restoring circulating leptin to physiological levels in vivo could improve host defences against this pathogen. We observed that ob/ob mice, compared with wild-type (WT) animals, exhibited enhanced lethality and reduced pulmonary bacterial clearance following Streptococcus pneumoniae challenge.

C 5 a/C 5 aR signaling has been implicated in the pathogenesis of many inflammatory and immunological diseases such as sepsis and acute lung injury. Widespread upregulation of C 5 aR has been seen at both the protein level and transcriptional level under pathological conditions.

A panel of chemically siRNA oligonucleotides was first synthesized to identify the functional siRNA sequences. The short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) were also designed, cloned, and tested for the silencing effects in C 5 aR transfected cells. The effective shRNA expression cassettes were then transferred to an adenovirus DNA vector. ShRNA-expressing adenoviruses were intratracheally administered into mouse lung, and a significant in vivo silencing of C 5 aR was obtained four days after administration. Thus, C 5 aR shRNA-expressing adenoviruses appear to be an alternative strategy for the treatment of complement-induced disorders. Copyright © 2006 Lei Sun et al.

On the contrary, long-term DBK treatment in isolated fat tissue impaired insulin-mediated actions on leptin secretion and expression. in order to verify whether the in vivo effect of B- 1 receptor stimulation on leptin release was also dependent on blood insulin levels, DBK was injected in animals in hyperinsulinemic state. in this case, however, DBK {{was not able to}} potentiate leptinemia. Therefore, our results show that the B- 1 receptor stimulation may modulate leptin homeostasis in an insulin-dependent manner. These new findings contribute {{to a better understanding of}} the processes involving leptin regulation and highlight the involvement of kinins with metabolic processes. (c) 2007 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVESWe {{sought to}} study the {{relationships}} between chemokines and oxidative stress in acute coronary syndrome. BACKGROUNDIn view of existing knowledge on the participation of leukocytes and oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of acute coronary syndrome, we hypothesized that chemokines {{may play a role}} in recruiting and activating leukocytes in this disorder. METHODSThe levels of chemokines and oxidative stress were studied in 38 patients with stable and 38 with unstable angina and in 20 controls. In separate in vitro experiments the effect of chemokines on reactive oxygen species in monocytes and the effect of antioxidants on chemokine levels in these cells were also studied. RESULTS 1) Angina patients had raised serum levels of chemokines in both cross-sectional and longitudinal testing, with particularly high levels of interleukin (IL) - 8, monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP) - 1 and macrophage <b>inflammatory</b> <b>peptide</b> (MIP) - 1 -alpha in unstable disease. 2) T cells, and particularly monocytes, seem to contribute to the raised IL- 8, MCP- 1 and MIP- 1 -alpha levels in unstable angina. 3) Concomitantly, and significantly correlated with MCP- 1 and IL- 8 levels, stable and particularly unstable angina patients had decreased plasma levels of antioxidants and increased lipid peroxidation, suggesting enhanced oxidative stress. 4) Monocyte chemoattractant protein- 1 enhanced the generation of O 2 −in monocytes from unstable angina patients, and the antioxidant glutathione-monoethyl ester suppressed the production of IL- 8 and MCP- 1 in these cells. CONCLUSIONSOur findings suggest an interaction between chemokines and oxidative stress in unstable angina. This interaction may represent a vicious circle involved in the pathogenesis of acute coronary syndromes...|$|E
40|$|The <b>inflammatory</b> <b>peptide</b> {{bradykinin}} stimulated a {{rapid and}} transient increase in cytoplasmic [Ca 2 +] in primary pig chondrocytes, {{as measured by}} the fluorescent indicator dye Fura- 2. This increase occurred in the absence of extracellular Ca 2 +, indicating a mobilization from intracellular stores. The elevation in intracellular [Ca 2 +] was mediated by authentic bradykinin receptors, since it was blocked by the specific bradykinin antagonist [beta-(2 -thienyl) -L-Ala 5, 8,D-Phe 7]bradykinin. Activation of chondrocytes by bradykinin induced a concentration-dependent [ED 50 (dose for half-maximal response) approximately 40 nM] accumulation of inositol monophosphate in the presence of LiCl and a concentration-dependent increase in production of prostaglandin E 2. The generation of the secondary mediator prostaglandin E 2 was a biologically relevant output response induced by bradykinin, but chondrocyte responses, such as the rate of entry into DNA synthesis, the rate and pattern of new protein synthesis and the rate of synthesis and resorption of cartilage proteoglycan, were unaltered by bradykinin treatment. Chondrocytes were also shown to be activated by two pharmacological mediators of cytosolic [Ca 2 +] elevation, i. e. the ionophore A 23187 and thapsigargin, which both produced alterations in protein synthesis which were mimicked by bradykinin. Thus Ca 2 +-sensitive pathways exist which are not functionally responsive to a Ca 2 +-mobilizing and inositol phosphate-generating hormone, potentially indicating other routes of regulation. These results call attention to bradykinin and related peptides as another class of inflammatory mediators which may regulate physiological and pathological chondrocyte metabolism...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} that simvastatin is capable of blocking human neutrophil degranulation induced by proteinase 3 (PR 3) -anti-neutrophil cytoplasm auto-antibodies (ANCA) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) -ANCA, and by the chemotactic and <b>inflammatory</b> <b>peptide</b> N-formyl-methionine-leucine-phenylalanine (fMLP). Methods: This study was conducted between March 2010 and September 2011 at the Renal Institute of Birmingham, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) was purified from the plasma of 20 randomly selected patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis (10 PR 3 - and 10 MPO-ANCA), {{and their ability to}} induce neutrophil degranulation in {{the presence or absence of}} simvastatin (10 μM) was tested. The ability of the same dose of simvastatin to block fMLP-induced neutrophil degranulation was also tested. In addition, the ability of serum obtained from rats that received simvastatin at a dose of 25 mg/kg/day to block neutrophil degranulation in vitro was tested. Results: The addition of simvastatin significantly inhibited ANCA IgG-induced neutrophil degranulation by 48 % (p = 0. 02). There was no significant difference in response to simvastatin inhibition (p = 0. 73) between PR 3 - and MPO-ANCA. Simvastatin also inhibited neutrophil degranulation induced by 1 μM fMLP (30 %, p = 0. 04). We further demonstrated that serum from rats that received simvastatin significantly inhibited neutrophil degranulation induced by ANCA (31. 7 %, p = 0. 01) and fMLP (23. 5 %, p = 0. 03) compared to serum from control animals.   Conclusion: Simvastatin blocked both ANCA and fMLP-induced neutrophil degranulation. It is worth pursuing further therapeutic investigation of statins in vascular inflammatory diseases that involve neutrophil degranulation in their pathogenesis.  </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{systemic}} {{infusion of}} complement-derived anaphylatoxin ane chemotaxins during hemodialysis results in profound transient neutropenia {{and may be}} associated with subtle pulmonary dysfunction. The fact that these potent <b>inflammatory</b> <b>peptides</b> do not usually produce serious ill effects may be due in part to their rapid inactivation by the serum regulatory proteins anaphylatoxin inactivator (AI) and chemotactic factor inactivator (CFI). Accordingly, the authors investigated the effect of hemodialysis on circulating neutrophil counts and serum levels of AI and CFI activity in 10 patients. In all patients, circulating neutrophil counts plummeted by more than 50 % within 5 minutes of the onset of dialysis and rose beyond control levels by 1 hour. AI activity significantly fell from 65 +/- 16 mU/ml before dialysis to 18. 7 +/- 7. 8 mU/ml within 5 minutes of its initiation; levels remained depressed throughout the procedure. In contrast, CFI gradually increased, achieving a level significantly different from the predialysis value by 15 minutes. These events contrasted with the observation that activation of the complement system in vitro results in a significant decline in both CFI and AI activities. We suggest that the maintenance of or increase in CFI activity in patients undergoing hemodialysis enhances the clearance of circulating chemotactins, preventing the persistent activation of neutrophils during the procedure and subsequent organ dysfunction...|$|R
40|$|Thrombin-activatable {{fibrinolysis}} inhibitor (TAFI), {{also known}} as carboxypeptidase R, has been implicated as an important negative regulator of the fibrinolytic system. In addition, TAFI is able to inactivate <b>inflammatory</b> <b>peptides</b> such as complement factors C 3 a and C 5 a. To determine the role of TAFI in the hemostatic and innate immune response to abdominal sepsis, TAFI gene-deficient (TAFI(-/-)) and normal wild-type mice received an i. p. injection with Escherichia coli. Liver TAFI mRNA and TAFI protein concentrations increased during sepsis. In contrast to the presumptive role of TAFI as a natural inhibitor of fibrinolysis, TAFI(-/-) mice did not show any difference in E. coli-induced activation of coagulation or fibrinolysis, as measured by plasma levels of thrombin-anti-thrombin complexes and D-dimer {{and the extent of}} fibrin depositions in lung and liver tissues. However, TAFI(-/-) mice were protected from liver necrosis as indicated by histopathology and clinical chemistry. Furthermore, TAFI(-/-) mice displayed an altered immune response to sepsis, as indicated by an increased neutrophil recruitment to the peritoneal cavity and a transiently increased bacterial outgrowth together with higher plasma TNF-alpha and IL- 6 levels. These data argue against an important part for TAFI in the regulation of the procoagulant-fibrinolytic balance in sepsis and reveals a thus far unknown role of TAFI in the occurrence of hepatic necrosi...|$|R
40|$|Tumor {{cells are}} capable of {{simultaneously}} producing a number of related <b>inflammatory</b> <b>peptides,</b> now classified as chemokines. We have isolated a new human granulocyte chemotactic protein (GCP- 2), coproduced with interleukin- 8 (GCP- 1 /IL- 8) by osteosarcoma cells. Furthermore, the bovine homologue of human GCP- 2 was purified from kidney tumor cells using the same isolation procedure. Both chemokines occur in at least four NH 2 -terminally truncated forms. These 5 - 6 kDa proteins do not differ in potency and efficacy as granulocyte chemotactic factors using a standard in vitro migration assay. The complete primary structures of human and bovine GCP- 2 were disclosed by sequencing peptide fragments derived from the natural proteins. On {{the basis of the}} conservation of four cysteine residues, the two molecules are to be classified within the C-X-C chemokine family, including IL- 8. Human and bovine GCP- 2 are 67 % similar at the amino acid level. Their sequences show only weak similarity with that of IL- 8, and human GCP- 2 does not cross-react in a radioimmunoassay for IL- 8. Human and bovine GCP- 2 are specific granulocyte chemotactic factors in that they do not attract human monocytes. Bovine GCP- 2 is not species specific since it is at least as active as human GCP- 2 on human granulocytes. Both chemokines can also activate postreceptor mechanisms leading to release of gelatinase B by granulocytes. This is indicative for a possible role in inflammation and tumor cell invasion. status: publishe...|$|R
