5000|$|The age {{distribution}} of astroblastoma is largely bimodal, suggesting that two distinct diagnosis peaks occur from ages 5-10 and ages 21-30. [...] A likely {{explanation for this}} discrepancy is that parents of {{children are more likely}} to report symptoms of nausea and constant headaches than young adults, who may, at first, disregard these symptoms for a lesser condition. Nevertheless, a combination of age, anatomic location, and <b>image</b> <b>assessment</b> can efficiently evaluate astroblastoma. Furthermore, the age of a patient can aid an oncologist in recommending appropriate treatment plans, along with other factors.|$|E

Most {{of the research}} in the area of <b>image</b> quality <b>assessment</b> is focused on the scenario where the end-user is a human observer and therefore commonly known as perceptual <b>image</b> quality <b>assessment.</b> However, we believe that we should extend the field of <b>image</b> quality <b>assessment</b> to the task specific scenario where the end-user is not a human observer. The quality of image/video should be assessed based on the end-system/user that we call task-based <b>image</b> quality <b>assessment.</b> In this thesis, we discuss both perceptual <b>image</b> quality <b>assessment</b> and task-based <b>image</b> quality <b>assessment</b> with respect to face recognition task...|$|R

5000|$|The {{site has}} three {{mechanisms}} for recognizing quality works. One {{is known as}} [...] "Featured pictures", where works are nominated and other community members vote to accept or reject the nomination. This process began in November 2004.

[...] "Quality images" [...] only accepts works created by Wikimedia users, whereas [...] "Featured pictures" [...] additionally accepts nominations of works by third parties such as NASA. A third <b>image</b> <b>assessment</b> project, known as [...] "Valued images", began on June 1, 2008 {{with the purpose of}} recognising [...] "the most valued illustration of its kind", in contrast to the other two processes which assess images mainly on technical quality.|$|E
5000|$|Characterizing {{the form}} of the point-spread {{function}} by a single number, as the Strehl Ratio does, will be meaningful and sensible only if the point-spread function is little distorted from its ideal (aberration-free) form, which will be true for a well-corrected system that operates close to the diffraction limit. That includes most telescopes and microscopes, but excludes most photographic systems, for example. The Strehl ratio has been linked via the work of André Maréchal [...] to an aberration tolerancing theory which is very useful to designers of well-corrected optical systems, allowing a meaningful link between the aberrations of geometrical optics and the diffraction theory of physical optics. A significant shortcoming of the Strehl ratio as a method of <b>image</b> <b>assessment</b> is that, although it is relatively easy to calculate for an optical design prescription on paper, it is normally difficult to measure for a real optical system, not least because the theoretical maximum peak intensity is not readily available.|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Standardization of first-trimester nuchal {{translucency}} (NT) {{image acquisition}} {{is crucial to}} the success of screening for Down syndrome. Rigorous audit of operator performance and constructive feedback from assessors maintain standards. This process relies on good inter-rater agreement on <b>image</b> <b>assessment.</b> We describe the Australian approach to NT <b>image</b> <b>assessment</b> and evaluate the impact of a targeted intervention on inter-rater agreement. Methods: Between 2002 and 2008 a group of experienced practitioners met nine times to compare their assessment of a series of NT images. Each assessor had previously scored the images according to a system described in 2002. Inter-rater agreement was evaluated before and after an intervention where the assessors were required to refer to a detailed resource manual designed to reduce the subjectivity inherent in <b>image</b> <b>assessment.</b> Results: There was a statistical improvement in inter-rater agreement for all elements of <b>image</b> <b>assessment</b> (original scores and individual component scores) after the intervention, apart from horizontal fetal position. However, even after the intervention, inter-rater agreement levels generally remained moderate (kappa range: 0. 14 - 0. 58). Conclusions: This study has shown that provision of detailed resource documentation to experienced assessors can significantly improve inter-rater agreement in all facets of NT <b>image</b> <b>assessment.</b> It also highlights areas of <b>image</b> <b>assessment</b> that require critical review. It is recommended that all audit bodies regularly review their inter-rater agreement to ensure consistent feedback to operators who submit images for expert peer review. Copyrigh...|$|E

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references (leaves 26 - 30). The primary objective {{of this study was to}} examine the effect of media exposure on male body image. The experimental manipulation involved exposing participants to slideshows which depicted either images of lean/muscular male bodies, thin male bodies, average male bodies, or athletic apparel. Other objectives were to examine if attitudes towards muscularity moderate this experimentally induced acute body dissatisfaction, if it in fact existed, as well as to examine the validity and sensitivity (sensitivity to body image size in terms of fatness and muscularity) of the dependent measures implored. There were no significant differences in the amounts of body dissatisfaction seen across each of the four slideshows. Results did however support the use of all three of the body <b>image</b> <b>assessment</b> measures (Body <b>Image</b> <b>Assessment,</b> BIA; Body Morph Assessment, BMA; and Somatomorphic Matrix, SM) in measuring various aspects of male body image. The BIA and BMA were mainly sensitive to measuring "thinness/fatness" and not muscularity, whereas the SM was capable of measuring both. Although none of the three body <b>image</b> <b>assessment</b> measures were sensitive to detecting the attempted manipulation of media's effect of acute body dissatisfaction, this may be due to a weak manipulation resulting from attempts to control for the facial attraction and race/ethnicity of the males featured in the advertisements...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>Image</b> quality <b>assessment</b> is an {{important}} issue in the area of image processing, and the no-reference <b>image</b> quality <b>assessment</b> tries to evaluate the quality of image without the reference image. The present no-reference <b>image</b> quality <b>assessment</b> approach can not predict the quality score accurately. This paper proposes a new <b>image</b> quality <b>assessment</b> approach based on two-dimensional discrete fractional Fourier transform (FRFT). After the image is processed by two dimensional discrete fourier transform, the histogram of FRFT coefficients in different order are modeled by generalized Gaussian distribution (GGD). The parameters of GGD are estimated and the feature vector is formed by parameters of GGD. After that, the image is classified into five distortion type by the trained support vector machine. At last, the quality score is predicted by the trained support vector regression machine. The experiment results show that the performance of proposed method is better than the traditional method...|$|R

40|$|The aim of an {{objective}} <b>image</b> quality <b>assessment</b> {{is to find}} an automatic algorithm that evaluates the quality of pictures or video as a human observer would do.

Visual attention is a main feature of the HVS, but {{few studies have been}} done on using it in <b>image</b> quality <b>assessment.</b> In this work, we investigate the use of the visual attention information in their final pooling step. The rationale of this choice is that an artefact is likely more annoying in a salient region than in other areas. To shed light on this point, a quality assessment campaign has been conducted during which eye movements have been recorded. The results show that applying the visual attention to <b>image</b> quality <b>assessment</b> is not trivial, even with the ground truth.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{reports on the}} {{reliability}} and validity of an improved body <b>image</b> <b>assessment</b> scale, namely the female Photographic Figure Rating Scale (PFRS). This scale consists of ten photographic images of real women varying in body mass index (BMI) from emaciated to obese. The PFRS was designed to overcome many of the limitations associated with line-drawn figures that are currently in use, including a lack of realism and poor ecological validity. Based on a sample of 208 adult women, the results of the present study showed that the PFRS had good validity in that all images were correctly rank-ordered by BMI. In addition, construct validity was supported by the finding that current self-ratings of body size based on the PFRS were significantly correlated with participants' BMI and that body dissatisfaction was negatively correlated with positive body image. Finally, test-retest reliabilities showed that the PFRS remained stable after a three-week interval. The discussion focuses on the strengths and limitations of the PFRS in relation to existing scales used in body <b>image</b> <b>assessment...</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Objective: To {{determine}} {{the effect of}} method of figure presentation on figure rating scales used for body <b>image</b> <b>assessment.</b> Methods: Ratings of current, ideal, and socially acceptable body sizes were elicited from 360 university students. Male and female figure drawings ranging from thin to obese were presented to subjects using one of three presenta-tion methods. Figures were presented as an ordered array, an unordered array, or they were placed individually on cards that were fixed in order from thin to obese. Results: Figure ratings were significantly different among methods for the selection of current and ideal figure and socially acceptable body sizes. Discussion: The method of figure presentation had an influence on figure ratings. These findings suggest that the manner in which figures are presented to research participants for the evaluation of body image constructs may be responsible, in part, for the discordant results reported in the body <b>image</b> <b>assessment</b> literature. Future research is required to address potential reasons why the method of figure presentation results in different figure ratings. # 2003 by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

40|$|<b>Image</b> quality <b>assessment</b> is {{indispensable}} for image-based applications. The approaches towards <b>image</b> quality <b>assessment</b> {{fall into two}} main categories: subjective and objective methods. Subjective assessment has been widely used. However, careful subjective assessments are experimentally difficult and lengthy, and the results obtained may {{vary depending on the}} test conditions. On the other hand, objective <b>image</b> quality <b>assessment</b> would not only alleviate the difficulties described above but would also help to expand the application field. Therefore, several works have been developed for quantifying the distortion presented on a image achieving goodness of fit between subjective and objective scores up to 92 %. Nevertheless, current methodologies are designed assuming that the nature of the distortion is known. Generally, this is a limiting assumption for practical applications, since in a majority of cases the distortions in the image are unknown. Therefore, we believe that the current methods of <b>image</b> quality <b>assessment</b> should be adapted in order to identify and quantify the distortion of images at the same time. That combination can improve processes such as enhancement, restoration, compression, transmission, among others. We present an approach based on the power of the experimental design and the joint localization of the Gabor filters for studying the influence of the spatial/frequencies on <b>image</b> quality <b>assessment.</b> Therefore, we achieve a correct identification and quantification of the distortion affecting images. This method provides accurate scores and differentiability between distortions...|$|R
