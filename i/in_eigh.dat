At the site of neuroinflammation, astrocyte-derived cytokines and chemokines play both neuroprotective and neurotoxic roles in brain lesions of human neurological diseases. At present, the comprehensive profile of human astrocyte-derived cytokines and chemokines during inflammation remains to be fully characterized.

We present a left invariant quaternionic contact structure on a seven dimensional non-nilpotent Lie group, and show that this structure is locally quaternionic contact conformal to the flat quaternionic contact structure on the quaternionic Heisenberg group. On {{the product of a}} seven dimensional Lie group, equipped with a quaternionic contact structure, with the real line we determine explicit complete quaternionic Kaehhler metrics and Spin(7) -holonomy metrics which seem to be new.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the effects of the diethylamino analog of ethmozin (ethacizin) (1 mg/kg i. v.) on the spontaneous and reflexly elicited efferent activity in thoracic cardiac sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves. Nitroglycerin and phenylephnne (4 and 8 pg/kg i. v.) were administered to 1 5 anesthetized mongrel dogs while monitoring blood pressure and heart rate. In each dog two cardiac nerves were isolated and efferent neurograms were recorded simultaneously and analyzed by microprocessor. Ethacizin significantly attenuated the spontaneous sympathetic efferent activity in both left and right, preganglionic (n = 8) and postganglionic (n = 14) sympathetic nerves to the heart. In contrast, reflex changes in sympathetic activity elicited by baro-receptor challenges were not affected by ethacizin. Also, etha-cizin did not significantly affect either spontaneous or barorecep-tor reflex-induced parasympathetic efferent activities <b>in</b> <b>eigh...</b>|$|E

From a list of identified competencies compiled from course objectives and literature, to what extent did the members of the expert panel of secondary school business teachers in Virginia and agree on competencies that are essential for business teachers related to working with students who have disabilities? 2. What comparisons can be made among the ratings of competencies by the members of the expert panel? The data were collected using a modified, two-round Delphi technique.

It is reasonab l e, therefore, to use Empynase in combination with antibiotics for treatment of the infected lesion {{in order to make}} antibiotics easily spread into the lesion.

The results were satisfactory as follows : 1) Empynase was effective <b>in</b> five of <b>eigh</b> t patients with choromic prostatitis. 2) It was good for the patients with chronic pyelonephritis. 3) It was used in patients with traumatic pa r a plegics associated with urinary tract infections. The patients were divided at random into two groups in order to compare the effectiveness. Bacteriological cure was noted in only one of ten patients in the first group treated with a single administration of sensitive antibiotics, while it was achieved in five of eleven patients in the second group administered Empynase with sensitive antibiotics.

40|$|Recent {{experience}} with the spring-loaded patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) occluder has demonstrated several advantages of this device in the closure of intracardiac defects compared with previously described techniques. Pathologic and animal model studies were performed to identify which atrial septal defects (ASDs) might be suitable for device closure and to test a new septal closure double umbrella. Fifty specimens from the Cardiac Registry with unrepaired ASD secunda (20) were analyzed. Mean ASD size was 8 x 10 mm (range, 3 x 4 to 30 x 30 mm); 80 % (n = 40) of ASDs were judged closable with the new device. ASD closure was attempted in four lambs with the Rashkind (hooked single umbrella) ASD occluder. One of four umbrellas was correctly positioned; no ASDs were closed. A new double-hinged ("clamshell") umbrella device was designed: eight ASD closures were attempted with this device (defects ranged from 8 to 20 mm in diameter). Six of eight umbrellas were correctly positioned; four of four animals observed more than 1 day appeared to have complete closure on postmortem examination with endothelialization of the device. We conclude that 1) most ASD 20 are far enough from vital structures to permit closure, 2) initial placement of hooked umbrellas is often incorrect and cannot be altered, 3) clamshell double umbrellas were successfully placed <b>in</b> six of <b>eigh...</b>|$|R
40|$|Summary: The {{future of}} {{practice}} education {{in social work}} in England is under discussion. An integral part of this relates to those considered qualified and appropriate to assess student social workers and the qualification framework necessary to ensure their supply. A draft Practice Educator Framework for England was published in October 2009. Fifteen partnerships of employers and Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) were invited to deliver pilot Practice Educator programmes to test out the draft framework. This paper reports the formative and final evaluations from these pilot sites and lays the foundation for considerations of the future development of practice education in England. The evaluation and the pilot were commissioned by Skills for Care and funded by the Social Work Development Partnership. In total, 321 candidates had been or {{were in the process}} of being recruited to these pilot sites; whilst 24 candidates withdrew from or deferred their studies. The findings from the evaluation indicated that the vast majority of pilot sites had accredited their programmes academically, many at Master’s degree level.

40|$|Significant {{differences}} in whole blood viscosity and red cell deformability between two matched groups of patients undergoing subarachnoid or general anaesthesia {{have been reported}} (Drum-mond et al., 1980) : subarachnoid anaesthesia resulted {{in an increase in}} red cell deformability. Lignocaine itself has been shown to alter erythro-cyte morphology in vitro, although in therapeutic concentrations it had no effect on the rheological behaviour of erythrocyte suspensions in vitro (Chen, Lee and Chien, 1979). In vitro haemorheo-logical studies may be misleading as drugs may have in vitro effects on red cell deformability which are not substantiated by in vivo studies, and as dilutional effects may be introduced (Orr et al., 1982). Ex vivo studies are, therefore, more appropriate when investigating haemorheology, particularly when a drug has active metabolites, or when the pharmacodynamic effects of a drug may contribute to its haemorheological effects (Kal-treider, Meneely and Allen, 1942; Aronson, Magora and London, 1970). After the subarach-noid administration of lignocaine 75 mg and 100 mg, venous plasma lignocaine concentra-tions of 0. 3 ng ml" 1 have been reported (Giasi, D'Agostino and Covino, 1979; Axelsson and Hidman, 1981). Similar plasma lignocaine con-centrations have been observed after i. m. injection of the drug with peak concentrations between 30 and 60 min (Jebson, 1971).

40|$|This article {{reports the}} {{findings}} of a study developed to compare health care costs in the United States with those of eight other industrially advanced countries over the period 1960 - 76. All of the countries studied were found to share with the United States the problem of increased health care spending that has outpaced inflation in other sectors of the economy and continues to consume a growing share of national resources. The American growth rate in these expenditures has, in fact, been lower than that of all the other countries. Though U. S. health care expenditures have traditionally been relatively high when measured as a share of gross national product, Canada outspent the United States in this respect during the 1960 ’s. In more recent years, West Germany, the Netherlands, and Sweden have devoted a larger share of GNP to health care than has the United States. Over the years the Social Security Administration has received numerous queries on foreign health care expenditures from persons in and outside of Government. Interest in the comparative costs of American and foreign health care systems has been heightened by the various national health insurance proposals that have come before Congress and by concern over the continuing rise in domestic outlays for health services. The study on which this article is based was undertaken to determine the level of spending on health care <b>in</b> <b>eigh...</b>|$|E
