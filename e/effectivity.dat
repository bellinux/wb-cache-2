5000|$|Shaw, Turvey, & Mace (as {{cited by}} Greeno, 1994) later {{introduced}} the term <b>effectivities,</b> {{the abilities of}} the agent that determined what the agent could do, and consequently, the interaction that could take place. Perception and action were co-determined by the <b>effectivities</b> and affordances, which acted 'in the moment' together. Therefore, the agent directly perceived and interacted with the environment, determining what affordances could be picked up, based on his <b>effectivities.</b> This view is consistent with Norman's (1988) theory of [...] "perceived affordances," [...] which emphasizes the agent's perception of an object's utility as opposed to focusing on the object itself.|$|R

40|$|We present a-posteriori {{analysis}} of higher order finite element approximations (hp-FEM) for quadratic Fredholm-valued operator functions. Residual estimates for approximations of the algebraic eigenspaces are derived and we reduce the {{analysis of}} the estimator to {{the analysis of}} an associated boundary value problem. For the reasons of robustness we also consider approximations of the associated invariant pairs. We show that our estimator inherits the efficiency and reliability properties of the underlying boundary value estimator. As a model problem we consider spectral problems arising in analysis of photonic crystals. In particular, we present an example where a targeted family of eigenvalues cannot be guaranteed to be semisimple. Numerical experiments with hp-FEM show the predicted convergence rates. The measured <b>effectivities</b> of the estimator compare favorably with the performance of the same estimator on the associated boundary value problem. We also present a benchmark estimator, based on the dual weighted residual (DWR) approach, which is more expensive to compute but whose measured <b>effectivities</b> are close to one...|$|R

If standard treatments exist for the disease being studied in clinical trials, a standard treatment is always used in place of a placebo for serious diseases. In research experimental studies, the method of establishing a proper control group to eliminate the placebo effect has also been difficult, particularly for surgical and therapy interventions that are not pharmaceutical in nature. Notably, there has been much debate of whether to use a placebo pill or conduct a sham procedure as a control.|$|E

In 1940, the National Assembly declared a state of national emergency which gave the President extensive emergency powers. On December 8, 1941, Japan attacked the Philippines a few hours after attacking Pearl Harbor. The National Assembly lost no time in enacting substantive legislation diverting all remaining funds for national defense and declaring a state of total emergency. It furthered the emergency powers already granted to the President, such as the transfer of the seat of government and the extension of the <b>effectivity</b> of lapsing laws. In its last act, the National Assembly certified the results of the 1941 elections where Manuel L. Quezon and Sergio Osmeña were reelected as president and vice president, respectively.|$|E

However the agreements included a Principle of <b>Effectivity</b> under which each colonial power had to set up an effective presence in the territory—by obtaining treaties from local tribal chiefs, flying their flag, and setting up an administration and police force to keep order—to confirm the claim. If they did not, a rival could come in and do so, thereby 'legally' taking over the territory {{in the eyes of the}} civilized powers. In 1890 neither colonial power had treaties or an effective presence in Katanga, and as reports came of gold and copper being found in Katanga, the stage was set for a race between the BSAC and Free State.|$|E

50|$|Since knowing {{is rooted}} in action {{and can not be}} decontextualized from individual, social, and {{historical}} goals teaching approaches that focus on conveying facts and rules separately from the contexts within which they are meaningful in real-life do not allow for learning that is based on the detection of invariants. They are therefore considered to be impoverished methods that are unlikely to lead to transfer. Learning must involve more than the transmission of knowledge but must instead encourage the expression of <b>effectivities</b> and the development of attention and intention through rich contexts that reflect real life learning processes.|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} {{high order}} discontinuous-Galerkin finite element methods for partial differential equations, {{with a focus}} on the neutron transport equation. We begin by examining a method for preprocessing block-sparse matrices, of the type that arise from discontinuous-Galerkin methods, prior to factorisation by a multifrontal solver. Numerical experiments on large two and three dimensional matrices show that this pre-processing method achieves a significant reduction in fill-in, when compared to methods that fail to exploit block structures. A discontinuous-Galerkin finite element method for the neutron transport equation is derived that employs high order finite elements in both space and angle. Parallel Krylov subspace based solvers are considered for both source problems and $k_{eff}$-eigenvalue problems. An a-posteriori error estimator is derived and implemented as part of an h-adaptive mesh refinement algorithm for neutron transport $k_{eff}$-eigenvalue problems. This algorithm employs a projection-based error splitting in order to balance the computational requirements between the spatial and angular parts of the computational domain. An hp-adaptive algorithm is presented and results are collected that demonstrate greatly improved efficiency compared to the h-adaptive algorithm, both in terms of reduced computational expense and enhanced accuracy. Computed eigenvalues and <b>effectivities</b> are presented for a variety of challenging industrial benchmarks. Accurate error estimation (with <b>effectivities</b> of 1) is demonstrated for a collection of problems with inhomogeneous, irregularly shaped spatial domains as well as multiple energy groups. Numerical results are presented showing that the hp-refinement algorithm can achieve exponential convergence with respect to the number of degrees of freedom in the finite element spac...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This {{presentation}} illustrates my {{quest for}} diversity, more specifically resonant interaction. Resonance occurs {{due to the}} perfect matching interplay between a person and a product. It evokes strong positive emotions, unique accompanying behaviour, heightened awareness and cognitive processing. In this presentation, I first explain the importance of diversifying designs, especially now we are pursuing {{the next generation of}} digital products. I show that designing for resonance can be a way to achieve diversity. I clarify the concept of resonance and resonant interaction. Subsequently, I explain the importance of research through design to study this phenomenon. In the presentation I show a number of interaction concepts for consumer electronics that investigate resonant interaction. Through these prototypes, I study the relationship between the individual user with his concerns, values, personality, skills, senses and <b>effectivities</b> on the one hand, and the interaction and product characteristics on the other hand.

40|$|An {{error control}} {{technique}} aimed {{to assess the}} quality of smoothed finite element approximations is presented in this paper. Finite element techniques based on strain smoothing appeared in 2007 were shown to provide significant advantages compared to conventional finite element approximations. In particular, a widely cited strength of such methods is improved accuracy for the same computational cost. Yet, few {{attempts have been made}} to directly assess the quality of the results obtained during the simulation by evaluating an estimate of the discretization error. Here we propose a recovery type error estimator based on an enhanced recovery technique. The salient features of the recovery are: enforcement of local equilibrium and, for singular problems a "smooth + singular" decomposition of the recovered stress. We evaluate the proposed estimator on a number of test cases from linear elastic structural mechanics and obtain efficient error estimations whose <b>effectivities,</b> both at local and global levels, are improved compared to recovery procedures not implementing these features. © 2012 Springer-Verlag...|$|R

Design/methodology/approach: The possibility of usage of quality research methods are connected with continuous quality improvement of pre-production, production and after-production spheres of organization.
