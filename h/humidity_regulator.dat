40|$|Effects of {{temperature}} and water stress on growth of corn seedlings (Zea mays L.) were determined in a walk-in growth chamber with alight intensity of 30 x 10 Lux {{and a day}} night cycle of 14 / 10 hours, with two water regimes and at constant temperatures of 20, 25, 28 and 30 C. The growth of the seedlings at different treatments was exponential. The relative growth rate of the seedlings ranged from. 01 to. 05 gg day for the roots and shoots at different treatments of the experiment. The optimum temperature {{for the growth of}} shoots and roots was 28 C. The dry treatments had always lower growth rates in shoots and roots at different temperature. The performance of the growth chamber was satisfactory, but addition of relative <b>humidity</b> <b>regulator</b> is essential to ensure better results...|$|E
40|$|DE 102006018872 A 1 UPAB: 20080229 NOVELTY - The {{material}} has suitable <b>humidity</b> <b>regulator</b> which is dispersed for retaining and dispensing of humidity. The material {{is made of}} polymer matrix, which is provided with cavities. The packaging {{material has}} polymer, a copolymer and their blends or alloys. The polymer matrix consists of polar and non-polar polymer. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a method for manufacturing of a packaging material. USE - Used for packing e. g. firm or liquid food, medicaments, chemical substances, hazardous goods, electronic products, cultural assets and ornamental plants (Claimed). ADVANTAGE - The material is made of polymer matrix which is provided with cavities. The packaging material has polymer, a copolymer and their blends or alloys, and hence relative humidity is stopped in a closed area {{in a range of}} the relative humidity, and the relative humidity is adapted {{to the needs of the}} filling material, and is condensation be compensated with to high relative humidity during temperature reduction, microbe growth, and thus loss of water and draining of the filling material is avoided, and ensures an optimal product quality of the filling material and a minimum durability...|$|E
