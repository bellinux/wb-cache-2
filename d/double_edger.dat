40|$|This Research is done at July 2009 till September 2009 to {{collecting}} {{damaged data}} {{and cost of}} the critical component of <b>double</b> <b>edger</b> machine. Intention {{of this research is}} to get an optimum time gap of replacement scheduled from <b>double</b> <b>edger</b> machine, to decreased cost of maintenance and repair the machine. By using reliability analiysis, a time gap replacement of critical component thats proposed can applied at the company to reduce the cost of component of replacement. With this models have determined that the optimum time gap replacement to component of seal that is 40 days with reliability level of component equal to 0, 749 so that in 2008 – 2009 periods there are cost saving equal to Rp 5. 276. 491, 44 with the old total cost Rp 19. 157. 346, 32 and the new total cost Rp 13. 880. 854, 43...|$|E
5000|$|The {{machinery}} {{proved the}} nucleus of the vast mills and business, which but a few years later, brought Mr. Young’s name and extensive operations into a prominence. In 1860 a new mill was erected, which commenced operations in August. In the statistical reports for 1873 the record shows there were two mills, built in 1867, with an estimated capacity of [...] yearly, operating two rotaries, eight gangs and five <b>double</b> <b>edgers,</b> employing 300 operators;. The cut of 1874 is stated at [...] of lumber and 17,295,000 shingles, that of 1875 being [...] of lumber and 14,470,000 shingles, showing a rapid evolution from the original mill of up to [...] per day while much larger, proved inadequate to the growing demands of his rapidly expanding operations. In twenty years, Mr. Young had become proprietor of the largest saw mill in operation on the American continent. In his earlier venture, the two Cincinnati men who had been connected with the La Crosse mill, and in whose interest it was removed to Clinton, were partners in the firm known as “W.J. Young & Co.,” but a few years later Mr. Young purchased their interests, and formed a connection with John McGraw of Ithaca, New York, {{who was a member of}} the firm of Sage & McGraw of Albany, New York and one of the largest lumbermen of the Allegheny region, and with large mills at Saginaw, and at Belle Ewart, Canada, and in connection with him purchased much of the land of the Cornell University of Ithaca, which had been donated by the State of New York from a large grant of Wisconsin lands donated by the general government in aid of its school fund, and which comprised some of the best pine land of Wisconsin. Under this arrangement the firm name of W.J. Young & Co. was continued until the death of Mr. McGraw, as well as of his daughter Jennie McGraw Fisk, his beneficiary, who died a few years later, when Mr. Young purchased the interest of the estate, and continued the firm name, although being the only party in interest.|$|R

The mill boasted a <b>double</b> circular saw, <b>edger,</b> and planer, with the mill having {{a capacity of}} 20,000 board feet (...) of lumber per day. An unusual aspect of the site was a 270 ft wire suspension bridge, built in 1877 to connect the mainland to a small island in the ocean. Ships bound for San Francisco and other ports would call at this island, sometimes called Pelican Island, {{to pick up the}} milled lumber, which would be brought across the bridge from the mainland by train.|$|R
