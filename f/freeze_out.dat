25|$|In {{an effort}} to <b>freeze</b> <b>out</b> the Montreal Wanderers, the ECHA disbanded in December 1909 and a new league called the Canadian Hockey Association (CHA) was formed, {{deliberately}} designed to exclude the Wanderers. While the Wanderers were forced to join the newly formed National Hockey Association (NHA), the defending Cup champion Ottawa HC still had to accept challenges. In January 1910, they played a two-game total goals series against Galt, champions of the OPHL, but prevailed with 12–3 and 3–1 victories. Marty Walsh led Ottawa with 6 goals.|$|E

Other ruling families, particularly the Pandes, decried what they saw as Bhimsen Thapa’s submissive attitude towards the British. The prime minister however had been able to retain power by maintaining a large, modernized army and politically dominating the court during the minority of King Rajendra Bikram Shah, (reigned 1816–1847). Additionally, he was able to <b>freeze</b> <b>out</b> the Pandes from power by appointing members of his own family into positions of authority.|$|E
25|$|Some {{materials}} show induced magnetic {{behavior that}} follows a Curie type law but with exceptionally large {{values for the}} Curie constants. These materials are known as superparamagnets. They are characterized by a strong ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic type of coupling into domains of a limited size that behave independently from one another. The bulk properties of such a system resembles that of a paramagnet, but on a microscopic level they are ordered. The materials do show an ordering temperature above which the behavior reverts to ordinary paramagnetism (with interaction). Ferrofluids are a good example, but the phenomenon can also occur inside solids, e.g., when dilute paramagnetic centers are introduced in a strong itinerant medium of ferromagnetic coupling such as when Fe is substituted in TlCu2Se2 or the alloy AuFe. Such systems contain ferromagnetically coupled clusters that <b>freeze</b> <b>out</b> at lower temperatures. They are also called mictomagnets.|$|E

25|$|The {{third most}} {{abundant}} constituent of the Uranian atmosphere is methane , {{the presence of}} which has been known for some time {{as a result of the}} ground-based spectroscopic observations. Methane possesses prominent absorption bands in the visible and near-infrared, making Uranus aquamarine or cyan in colour. Below the methane cloud deck at 1.3bar methane molecules account for about 2.3% of the atmosphere by molar fraction; about 10 to 30 times that found in the Sun. The mixing ratio is much lower in the upper atmosphere due to the extremely low temperature at the tropopause, which lowers the saturation level and causes excess methane to <b>freeze</b> <b>out.</b> Methane appears to be undersaturated in the upper troposphere above the clouds having a partial pressure of only 30% of the saturated vapor pressure there. The concentration of less volatile compounds such as ammonia, water and hydrogen sulfide in the deep atmosphere is poorly known. However, as with methane, their abundances are probably greater than solar values by a factor of at least 20 to 30, and possibly by a factor of a few hundred.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} data on mean hadron yields and {{contrast}} the chemical freezeout conditions in p+p, p+Pb and Pb+Pb at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) energies. We study several schemes for freezeout that mainly differ in the way strangeness is treated: i. strangeness <b>freezes</b> <b>out</b> along with the non-strange hadrons in complete equilibrium (1 CFO), ii. strangeness <b>freezes</b> <b>out</b> along with non-strange hadrons with an additional parameter γ_S accounting for non-equilibrium production of strangeness (1 CFO+γ_S), and iii. strangeness <b>freezes</b> <b>out</b> earlier than non-strange hadrons and in thermal equilibrium (2 CFO). A comparison of the chisquares of the fits indicate a dependence of the freezeout scheme on the system size. The minimum bias p+p and different centralities of p+Pb and peripheral Pb+Pb data prefer 1 CFO+γ_S with γ_S approaching unity as we go from p+p to central p+Pb and peripheral Pb+Pb. On the other hand, the mid-central to central Pb+Pb data prefer 2 CFO over 1 CFO+γ_S. Such system size dependence of freezeout scheme could be {{an indication of the}} additional interaction in Pb+Pb over p+Pb and p+p. Comment: version accepted for publicatio...|$|R

At <b>freeze</b> <b>out,</b> the neutron-proton ratio was about 1/6.

[...] Almost all neutrons that fused instead of decaying ended up combined into helium-4, {{due to the fact that}} helium-4 has the highest binding energy per nucleon among light elements. This predicts that about 8% of all atoms should be helium-4, leading to a mass fraction of helium-4 of about 25%, which is in line with observations. Small traces of deuterium and helium-3 remained as there was insufficient time and density for them to react and form helium-4.|$|E
