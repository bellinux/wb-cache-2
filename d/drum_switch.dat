50|$|Type H {{couplers}} are in {{widespread use}} on multiple unit passenger trains in the UK built from the mid 1970s onwards. The previous generation of slam door units fitted with Buckeye couplers had required a shunter {{to get down}} onto the track and stand between the two units to manually trip the coupler mechanism as well as connect or disconnect the air pipes and electrical jumper leads. In order to reduce staffing costs and cut down station dwell times, British Rail looked to incorporate an automatic coupler mechanism in its new power-door trains. Class 313 units were the first stock to incorporate this. Air-operated Tightlock couplers were chosen, together with underslung electrical connector boxes controlled by a <b>Drum</b> <b>switch,</b> and this allowed drivers to single-handedly attach or split a train without having to leave the cab.|$|E
5000|$|He {{became a}} {{laboratory}} assistant to Thomas Edison in December 1879, and {{assisted in the}} development of the incandescent light bulb. [...] He became one of the world's earliest experts in electric power distribution. He also built the world's first advertising sign using incandescent electric lights. He was chief engineer when the English Edison Electric Light company built a central station in London to power 3,000 incandescent lamps on the Holborn Viaduct. This was the first large scale demonstration of a central station powering incandescent lighting, preceding the Pearl Street Station in New York City. Hammer invented the electric advertising sign, by constructing a ten foot long, four foot high sign with 12 bulbs for each letter of the name [...] "Edison," [...] which had a rotating <b>drum</b> <b>switch</b> to light the letters one by one and then all at once. It was exhibited at The Crystal Palace in London in February 1882.|$|E

25|$|For 1949, minor {{modifications}} to the brake <b>drums,</b> <b>switching</b> from vanes to slits for cooling, along with small changes to the cockpit control layout and a repositioned oil header-tank resulted in a car {{sometimes referred to as}} the 4CLT/49. It was never known as such by the factory. The Ascari/Villoresi/Parnell trio, joined by Juan Manuel Fangio and Toulo de Graffenried, took up where they had left off the previous season, winning nine of the first fifteen races of 1949, including de Graffenried's victory in the British Grand Prix. However, {{the second half of the}} season only saw three further wins, as increasingly competitive Ferrari and Talbot cars squeezed out the Maseratis in most major races.|$|R

50|$|Krokus {{was formed}} in 1975 as a {{primarily}} progressive rock act. Chris von Rohr, originally the <b>drummer,</b> <b>switched</b> to lead vocals in the late 1970s and with that formation Krokus was successful in Switzerland, touring throughout the country. After seeing AC/DC in concert in the late 70s, they decided to change their musical direction and adopted a new sound which was heavily influenced by that band. Since von Rohr possessed limited vocal abilities and was not capable of hitting the third octave, the band decided to hire a new lead vocalist. Eventually, Marc Storace, formerly of TEA and Eazy Money, was hired in 1979. With the new line-up in place, the band recorded and released the album Metal Rendez-vous in 1980, which was Krokus' first hit and brought the band international recognition.|$|R

5000|$|Cartwright's next band, {{again with}} Yarber, {{and with the}} {{addition}} of Eric Friedl, was the garage-rock outfit, The Oblivians. Formed in 1993 out of the ashes of the Compulsive Gamblers, the Oblivians took a more primitive, punk-influenced approach to rock and roll. Each member served as singer, guitarist, and <b>drummer,</b> <b>switching</b> between instruments and vocal duties during performances. In 1995 the band released its first album, Soul Food. This was followed in 1996 by Sympathy Sessions, a compilation album featuring a collection of songs recorded with Doug Easley for the record label Sympathy for the Record Industry. https://web.archive.org/web/20000819075358/http://www.furious.com/perfect/oblivians.html The Oblivians released their second album, Popular Favorites, in 1996, and their third and final album, ...Play 9 Songs with Mr Quintron, in 1997.

The bands kicked off the tour in their hometowns, Memphis and Detroit, they also played at the VICE Garage Fest in Lawrence Kansas in Oct of 2010.|$|R
5|$|Moon {{played a}} four, then a five-piece drum kit during his early career. His 1965 set {{consisted}} of Ludwig drums and Zildjian cymbals. By 1966, feeling limited {{by this setup}} and inspired by Ginger Baker's double bass <b>drum,</b> he <b>switched</b> to a larger Premier kit. This setup {{did not have a}} hi-hat, since Moon used crash and ride cymbals instead. He remained a loyal customer of Premier.|$|R
50|$|To see one {{to three}} drum majors in most {{ensembles}} is typical. In some ensembles, <b>drum</b> majors <b>switch</b> positions during the show to allow all individuals a chance to conduct from the central podium. Occasionally, they may also serve in other capacities such as performing a solo, in which case one or two band directors would conduct the band temporarily until the drum major(s) would finish their/his/her solo.|$|R
50|$|With the OE {{the three}} brake <b>drums</b> were <b>switched</b> to steel-lined {{aluminium}} drums well ribbed for cooling and linings were ferodo. In 1923 {{a year after}} the OE's introduction mechanically operated front brakes were added and linked to the pedal which still operated the transmission brake. In 1927 they were replaced by a notoriously temperamental hydraulic system from the pedal to the transmission and, again, just the front wheels.|$|R

50|$|George {{started playing}} music {{when he was}} 14, {{specifically}} bass guitar. The Beatles, more specifically Paul McCartney, were inspirations to him.

He spent the first several years (1980-1984) playing in cover bands, playing backyard parties, school talent shows, etc.|$|R
50|$|The {{following}} year, {{the band}} performed at Palilula Culture Olympics in Belgrade as guests, as Studeni Studeni won the festival the previous year. The band also {{performed at the}} Niš club Underground and the Belgrade KST.

5000|$|Bloom {{was born}} in Boston, Massachusetts on January 12 to Joel and Evelyn Bloom.

500|$|Singing can cease and restart suddenly, either rarely or frequently, {{and often}} ends abruptly. The song has been {{described}} as [...] "Tar-ran-tar-rar-tar-ran-tar-rar", [...] and consists of a series of pulses emitted at a rate of 240–250 a second. The tymbal covers are much larger than other species and also make the call louder and send it in a particular direction. There are two distinct phases of song, which the double <b>drummer</b> <b>switches</b> between at irregular intervals. One phase is a continuous call that can last for several minutes; during this period the frequency varies between 5.5–6.2kHz and 6.0–7.5kHz 4–6 times a second. In the other phase, the song is interrupted by breaks of increasing frequency resulting in a staccato sound. These breaks can be mistaken for silence as the difference in volume is so great, though the song actually continues at a much lower volume. During this staccato phase, which lasts for several seconds, the frequency remains around 5.75–6.5kHz. The frequency of the song is a high harmonic of the pulse repetition frequency, which makes for a particularly ringing sound. Double drummers congregate in groups to amplify their calls, which likely drives off potential bird predators.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are also}} {{sequential}} transmissions {{that use the}} rotation of a <b>drum</b> to <b>switch</b> gears, much {{like those of a}} typical fully manual motorcycle. These can be designed with a manual or automatic clutch system, and may be found both in automobiles (particularly track and rally racing cars), motorcycles (typically light [...] "step-thru" [...] type city utility bikes, e.g., the Honda Super Cub) and quadbikes (often with a separately engaged reversing gear), the latter two normally using a scooter-style centrifugal clutch.|$|R
50|$|Holland's early {{influences}} include Aerosmith, The Beatles, the Sex Pistols, the Ramones, KISS, Bob Marley, Queen, and The Rolling Stones. After he met {{friend and}} cross-country teammate Greg K., they started a local punk band called Manic Subsidal in 1983, {{where he played}} the drums. It formed after the duo failed {{to get into a}} Social Distortion concert in 1984. After Jim Benton was hired as their <b>drummer,</b> Holland <b>switched</b> to both vocals and guitars. They never released any albums, but some demos have existed online.|$|R
