500|$|Kemper {{then left}} the scene in Hallett's car, driving eastward, leaving California and through Nevada and Utah. He arrived in Pueblo, Colorado and, after not hearing any news on the radio about the murders {{of his mother and}} Hallett, found a phone booth and called the police. He confessed to the murders of his mother and Hallett, but the police did not take his call seriously and told him to call back at a later time. Several hours later, Kemper called again asking to speak to an officer he {{personally}} knew. Kemper then confessed to that officer of killing his mother and Hallett, and waited in his car for the police to arrive, arrest him and take him into custody, where he then also confessed to the murders of the six students. When asked after his arrest what motivated him to turn himself in, Kemper said: [...] "The original purpose was gone... It wasn't serving any physical or real or emotional purpose. It was just a pure waste of time... Emotionally, I couldn't handle it much longer. Toward the end there, I started feeling the folly of the whole damn thing, and at the point of near exhaustion, near collapse, I <b>just</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> hell with it and called it all off." ...|$|E
2500|$|Meetings at Paisley were tumultuous and Asquith was barracked by hecklers singing [...] "The Red Flag". Asquith {{was widely}} {{expected}} {{to lose his}} seat and did so by 2,228. He received 46.5 per cent {{of the vote in}} his final parliamentary election, a straight fight against Labour. Violet wrote; [...] "Father was absolutely controlled. He <b>just</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> me, 'I'm out by 2,000'." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "I had <b>just</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> Dick McMullen, 'Be {{sure not}} to fire until they reach that mullein stalk,' when a commotion {{in the rear of}} our line caused me to look behind us, and to my dismay, my eyes rested upon the largest line of cavalry I had ever seen. There seemed to be no end to the line. There they stood in double ranks within forty feet of us. They were well mounted and admirably armed. How they got there in our {{immediate}} rear I know not, and from what direction they came I have never learned. The fact is, they were there in overpowering numbers, with pistol or gun ready to do damage upon the least show of resistance. Major [...] Boyd, commanding our regiment, quickly said: 'We are prisoners,' {{and that was the end}} of the Nineteenth Virginia Infantry as a body of armed soldiers." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "American Boy" [...] {{was written}} by Estelle, will.i.am, John Legend, Kanye West, Josh Lopez, Caleb Speir and Keith Harris. It was also {{produced}} by will.i.am and recorded over the instrumental of his song [...] "Impatient", from his third studio album Songs About Girls (2007). The credits of Lopez, Speir, and Harris {{were the result of}} this sampling. In a 2008 interview with Pete Lewis of Blues & Soul, Estelle explained how the song came to fruition: [...] "We were just messing about in the studio, joking around. And John (Legend) <b>just</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> me 'Why don't you write a song about meeting an American boy?'. So I was like 'Well, that's pretty easy' - because I have a lot of male friends out there in New York. And I unwittingly ended up creating a new ladies' anthem!" [...] She also spoke about West's involvement on the song, commenting [...] "Kanye basically just brought his own cheeky self to the track, his own sense of humour. At first he was like 'How can you rap over a dance beat?' - and now he's DONE it!" [...] Instrumentation on the track includes drums, keys, synths, and bass; the former were provided by will.i.am while Caleb Speir provided the latter. will.i.am also co-recorded and co-engineered the song with Padriac Kerin at The Record Plant in Hollywood, Florida as well as Hit Factory Criteria and Circle House Studios in Miami. Serge Tsai mixed the song and recorded West's rap at Platinum Sound Recording Studios in New York City.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's all, Feemy. Surely there's {{no great}} {{difficulty}} in saying that--when it'll save your own brother's life to say so; and it's only the truth. You can say {{as much in}} court as you've <b>just</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> me, can't you? Mrs. McKeon 'll be there with you--and I'll be there with you. You'll only have to say in court what you've <b>just</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> me." ...|$|E

6000|$|My {{young lady}} {{continued}} {{to look at me}} in confusion and mistrust, and the result of her reflexion on what I had <b>just</b> <b>said</b> was <b>to</b> make her suddenly break out: “Look here, sir—what’s the matter with him?” ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Good-bye!' said Mr Meagles. 'This is {{the last}} good-bye upon the list, for Mother and I have <b>just</b> <b>said</b> it <b>to</b> Mr Clennam here, and he only waits to say it to Pet. Good-bye! We may never meet again.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's {{just what}} he would done," [...] cried Mrs. Atwell. [...] "And I'll give him such a goin' ova, for his teasin', as he ain't had in one while. He <b>just</b> <b>said</b> it <b>to</b> tease. What you goin' to say to Mrs. Milray?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Will {{you tell}} me what there is in the letter?" [...] he asked--passing, as you see, entirely over what I had <b>just</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> him.|$|E
6000|$|... "I! I {{always liked}} you. After {{what you have}} <b>just</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> me, I should be insensible indeed if I didn't respect and admire you as well." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Of that, your Highness, I {{can recall}} nothing, or very little," [...] then, doubtless remembering {{what she had}} <b>just</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> me, she made obeisance and passed from the chamber.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is a {{great thing}} for me," [...] murmured old Giorgio, still {{thinking}} of the house, for now he had grown weary of change. [...] "The signora <b>just</b> <b>said</b> a word <b>to</b> the Englishman." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Oh, Andrew didn't {{really mean}} it, of course. He <b>just</b> <b>said</b> it <b>to</b> sound smart {{and make us}} stare. The Marrs are all like that.

I don't believe there is any use in praying that Felicity will speak first, because I am sure she won't." ...|$|R

60|$|Thus far, Mrs. Ellmother {{had been}} ready enough to talk. Had {{she failed to}} hear what Francine had <b>just</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> her? or had she some reason for feeling {{reluctant}} to answer? In any case, a spirit of taciturnity took sudden possession of her--she was silent.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's <b>just</b> what I <b>said</b> <b>to</b> the missus, sir, {{the very}} night arter we was rescued. `The way that young feller come off, Maggie,' says I, `is most extraor'nar'. No fish that--'" ...|$|R
