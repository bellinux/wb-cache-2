30|$|Here, we {{demonstrate}} analytically that stable homeostasis {{occurs in}} a broad family of <b>dual</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems.</b> Further, we find that <b>dual</b> homeostatic <b>control</b> naturally preserves both the mean and the variance of the firing rate, a task impossible for a homeostatic system with a single slow feedback mechanism. We identify broad conditions under which a dually homeostatic neuron possesses a stable homeostatic fixed point, and we derive estimates of the characteristic firing rate mean and variance maintained by homeostasis in terms of homeostatic parameters. We use rate-based neurons and Poisson-spiking neurons for illustration, but our main result is sufficiently general to apply to any model neuron.|$|R

This <b>dual</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> is completely silent in the off stage and is coupled to the regulation of gene expression at both the transcriptional and translational levels.

For acoustic resonant conditions within the cavity, a spatially averaged noise reduction of approximately 30 dB was achieved using the active control system for both in-phase and out-of-phase monopoles; however, effective reduction of the sound field was dependent upon judiciously positioning the control forces for optimal control of the sound field...|$|E
30|$|This {{effect can}} be {{intuitively}} understood by noting that as a network gets closer to being a perfect integrator (i.e., as g approaches 1), fluctuations in firing rate are reinforced by the resulting fluctuations in excitation. As a result, the tendency to revert to a mean rate grows weaker and the firing rate variance increases toward infinity. (In a perfect integrator, a perturbed firing rate never reverts to a mean, so the variance of the firing rate is effectively infinite.) Thus, the network can attain a large variance by tuning g to be sufficiently close to  1. If this large variance is the characteristic variance of the control system, {{then there is a}} fixed point of the <b>dual</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> at this value of g.|$|E

30|$|Our {{results have}} special {{implications}} for neuronal integrators that maintain a steady firing rate through recurrent excitation. We {{have found that}} the precise additive and multiplicative tuning necessary to maintain the delicate balance of excitatory feedback can be performed by a <b>dual</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> within the framework we study here if the target firing rates are set far enough apart to achieve a large characteristic firing rate variance. The integrator maintained by dual homeostasis is robust to variation of its target firing rates. This occurs because the circuit is best able to achieve a large firing rate variance when it is tuned to eliminate any bias toward a particular firing rate, exactly the condition necessary for integration. This robust integrator tuning scheme should be considered in the ongoing experimental effort to understand processes of integration in the brain.|$|E
30|$|Here we {{show that}} some of our results on {{homogeneous}} recurrent excitatory networks generalize to heterogeneous networks in which each neuron has its own <b>dual</b> <b>control</b> <b>system,</b> target rates, and level of intrinsic noise. In particular, {{we show that}} if the neurons in such a network have target firing rates that set {{at least one of the}} characteristic variances sufficiently high, then when the combined control system reaches a fixed point, the network behaves like an integrator on short time scales. This condition is robust to variation in individual neuronal parameters, including target firing rates. Since the combined control systems of a heterogeneous network with N neurons is 2 N-dimensional rather than two-dimensional, we do not attempt to prove the stability of fixed points here. However, we have verified the stability of the behavior described below in simulations (data not shown, code available online).|$|E

SHRs (n = 6) showed the features of overactive bladder syndrome during urodynamic study, especially DO during the filling phase. After injection of the nonselective sympathetic blocking agent labetalol, DO disappeared in 3 of 6 SHRs (50 %).

The expression of these genes {{is subject to}} a <b>dual</b> <b>control</b> <b>system.</b> They are induced by nitrate and repressed by ammonium. AreA mediates derepression {{in the absence of}} ammonium and NirA supposedly mediates nitrate induction. Out of 10 GATA sites, a central cluster (sites 5 - 8) is responsible for approximately 80 % of the transcriptional activity of the promoter on both genes. We show occupancy in vivo of site 5 by the AreA protein, even under conditions of repression. Sites 5 - 8 are situated in a pre-set nucleosome-free region. Under conditions of expression, a drastic nucleosomal rearrangement takes place and the positioning of at least five nucleosomes flanking the central region is lost. Remodelling is strictly dependent on the presence of an active areA gene product, and independent from the NirA-specific and essential transcription factor. Thus, nucleosome remodelling is independent from the transcriptional activation of the niiA-niaD promoter. The results presented cast doubts on the role of NirA as the unique transducer of the nitrate induction signal. We demonstrate, {{for the first time in}} vivo, that a GATA factor is involved directly in chromatin remodelling...|$|E

40|$|We {{measured}} Basal Metabolic Rate (EMR) of 16 wader species (order Charadriiformes) {{on their}} wintering grounds in Africa. The allometric regression equation relating BMR to body mass: BMR (W) = 4. 02 x M (kg) (0. 724) runs parallel {{to that of}} waders in temperate areas, but at a 20 % lower elevation. Since waders wintering in the tropics have a reduced body mass, the difference in BMR between {{members of the same}} species at tropical and temperate latitudes was even larger and amounted to 31 %. BMR did nor differ between families nor did it differ between long-distance migrants that breed in the Arctic and species that spend their entire life in the tropics. As migrant waders have a higher BMR during autumn migration in the north, we suspect that they reduce BMR upon arrival in the tropics. We hypothesize that this reduction is due to somatic factors under control of hormonal factors, including a reduction of organ sizes and probably suppressed thyroid activity induced by the high ambient temperatures in the tropics. The involvement of thyroid hormones in the regulation of BMR would be consistent with the fact that waders in the tropics regulate their body mass at a lower level than birds in temperate areas and may explain why the rate of premigratory fattening is slower in the tropics than further north. The mechanism, a <b>dual</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> including somatic and hormonal factors acting in concert, rapidly adjusts BMR of migratory waders to the different ecological conditions encountered during their long journeys to and from the breeding grounds...|$|E
