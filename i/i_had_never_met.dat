500|$|Prior to the 1977 tour Bruford {{declined}} {{an offer}} to return as second drummer, leaving Collins searching for a replacement. He heard American drummer Chester Thompson, of Frank Zappa's band and Weather Report, play a drum passage on [...] "More Trouble Every Day" [...] from Zappa's live album Roxy & Elsewhere. Collins said, [...] "It floored me completely ... <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>met</b> him. I rang him up and said, 'Hi Chester, I've heard your stuff, {{would you like to}} play with Genesis?' ... He didn't even audition!" [...] Genesis toured Wind & Wuthering from January to July 1977 across Europe, North America, and for the first time, Brazil. The stage show cost £400,000 (equivalent to £ in [...] ). which featured a new PA system, lasers and smoke, and lighting supplied from two rows of Boeing 747 aircraft landing lights. Touring began on 1 January with three sold-out shows at the Rainbow Theatre in London, where 80,000 applications were made for the 8,000 available tickets. They returned to London for three nights at Earls Court, then the largest arena in Britain, supported by Richie Havens. The band's growing popularity in North America led to television appearances and concerts organised in larger venues than previous tours, including Madison Square Garden in New York City. Their Brazilian dates were attended by over 150,000 people and a proposed 100,000-person gig was cancelled over rioting fears. An armed bodyguard accompanied each member throughout their stay.|$|E
2500|$|I {{honestly}} thought after Ligonier that we {{were beginning}} {{a new era of}} cooperation and Orthodox unity on this continent. For {{the first time since the}} early years of our presence in the Americas, it seemed there was a common vision, or at least a common goal of working together, not just for the sake of working together, but toward a canonically proper end of a unified Church. For me, the chance to sit down with brother bishops, many of whom <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>met,</b> was a great and awesome experience. What made this experience great and awesome, besides just getting [...] together, was that [...] there was a purpose. Often we had gotten together in the past, but just for social purposes or anniversaries, celebrations, etc. This time it was for the good of the Church. Unfortunately, [...] what happened in the aftermath of Ligonier left us further apart and more disunited than we were in the years that led up to that historic gathering.|$|E
2500|$|Not {{long after}} Abe began work at Yoshidaya, Ishida began making amorous {{advances}} towards her. Omiya had never satisfied Abe sexually, {{and she gave}} in to Ishida. In mid-April, Ishida and Abe initiated their sexual relationship in the restaurant {{to the accompaniment of}} a romantic ballad sung by one of the restaurant's geishas. On April 23, 1936 Abe and Ishida met for a pre-arranged sexual encounter at a teahouse, or machiai—the contemporary equivalent of a love hotel—in the Shibuya neighborhood. Planning only for a short 'fling', the couple instead remained in bed for four days. On the night of April 27, 1936, they moved to another teahouse in the distant neighborhood of Futako Tamagawa where they continued to drink and have sex, occasionally with the accompaniment of a geisha's singing, and would continue even as maids entered the room to serve sake. They next moved to the Ogu neighborhood, and Ishida did not actually return to his restaurant until the morning of May 8, 1936, after an absence of about two weeks. Of Ishida, Abe later said, [...] "It is hard to say exactly what was so good about Ishida. But it was impossible to say anything bad about his looks, his attitude, his skill as a lover, the way he expressed his feelings. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>met</b> such a sexy man." ...|$|E

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>met</b> Mr. Stanton {{up to that}} time, {{though we}} had held {{frequent}} conversations over the wires the year before, when I was in Tennessee. Occasionally at night he would order the wires between the War Department and my headquarters to be connected, and we would hold a conversation {{for an hour or}} two. On this occasion the Secretary was accompanied by Governor Brough of Ohio, whom <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>met,</b> though he and my father had been old acquaintances. Mr. Stanton dismissed the special train that had brought him to Indianapolis, and accompanied me to Louisville.|$|E
60|$|DAN. So {{like you}} that {{there are times when}} I almost wish <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>met</b> you. You set me {{thinking}} about myself, and that is a subject I find it pleasanter to forget.|$|E

6000|$|I {{confess to}} {{a feeling of}} {{profound}} astonishment. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>met</b> Mrs. Harris before, but as she was an intimate friend of Mrs. Cameron, and quite evidently a woman of culture, I could not think her so practised a joker as to be [...] "putting all this on." ...|$|E

60|$|Evidence of my {{literary}} success, if {{you look}} at it that way, may have lain in an invitation to dine at Andrew Carnegie's, but a suspicion that I was being patronized made me hesitate. It was only after I learned that Burroughs and Gilder were going that I decided to accept, although I could not see why the ironmaster should include me in his list. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>met</b> him and was not eager for his recognition.|$|E
60|$|He was in {{particular}} partial to the poets, could quote at will from Gay and Thomson and Goldsmith and Gray, {{and even from}} Shakespeare, much to my own astonishment and humiliation.
