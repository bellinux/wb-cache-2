5|$|In 2013, {{ten years}} since its implementation, TfL {{reported}} that the congestion charging scheme resulted in a 10% reduction in traffic volumes from baseline conditions, and an overall reduction of 11% in vehicle kilometres in London between 2000 and 2012. Despite these gains, traffic speeds have also been getting progressively slower over the past decade, particularly in central London. TfL explains that the historic decline in traffic speeds is most likely due to interventions that have reduced the <b>effective</b> <b>capacity</b> of the road network {{in order to improve}} the urban environment, increase road safety and prioritise public transport, pedestrian and cycle traffic, as well as an increase in road works by utilities and general development activity since 2006. TfL concludes that while levels of congestion in central London are close to pre-charging levels, the effectiveness of the congestion charge in reducing traffic volumes means that conditions would be worse without the Congestion Charging scheme.|$|E
5|$|The large {{spillway}} tunnels {{have only}} been used twice, for testing in 1941 and because of flooding in 1983. During both times, when inspecting the tunnels after the spillways were used, engineers found major damage to the concrete linings and underlying rock. The 1941 damage was attributed to a slight misalignment of the tunnel invert (or base), which caused cavitation, a phenomenon in fast-flowing liquids in which vapor bubbles collapse with explosive force. In response to this finding, the tunnels were patched with special heavy-duty concrete and {{the surface of the}} concrete was polished mirror-smooth. The spillways were modified in 1947 by adding flip buckets, which both slow the water and decrease the spillway's <b>effective</b> <b>capacity,</b> in an attempt to eliminate conditions thought to have contributed to the 1941 damage. The 1983 damage, also due to cavitation, led to the installation of aerators in the spillways. Tests at Grand Coulee Dam showed that the technique worked, in principle.|$|E

25|$|TfL {{reported}} in January 2014, that despite {{a reduction of}} traffic volume within London, traffic speeds have also been getting progressively slower over the past decade, particularly in central London. TfL explains that the historic decline in traffic speeds is most likely due to interventions that have reduced the <b>effective</b> <b>capacity</b> of the road network to improve the urban environment, increase road safety and prioritise public transport, pedestrian and cycle traffic, {{as well as an}} increase in road works by utilities and general development activity since 2006. This explains the lower levels of congestion reduction compared to the pre-charge baseline: 8% in 2006, compared to 30% in 2004. Since 2006 this trend towards slower traffic movement has ceased and traffic speeds have remained more stable, as evidenced by GPS satellite tracking data from 2006 to 2012. Indicators of excess delay or congestion also suggest a stable overall picture, with some improvements in the past two years.

500|$|In June 2011 Mitsubishi {{announced}} {{the introduction of}} lithium titanate oxide SCiB battery technology for its two new models of electric vehicles, the i-MiEV and Minicab MiEV. The SCiB technology was developed by Toshiba, which stated that its SCiB batteries can withstand 2.5 times more charge/discharge cycles than a typical lithium-ion battery. In addition, recharging via CHAdeMO takes much less time than charging at the AC Level 2 rate used by most electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE), allowing the SCiB battery to reach 80% capacity in 15 minutes, 50% in 10 minutes and 25% in 5 minutes. In terms of performance, the SCiB battery offers a higher <b>effective</b> <b>capacity</b> than a typical lithium-ion battery, which combined with more efficient regenerative charging during braking or coasting downhill, allows the SCiB battery to deliver 1.7 times the driving range per charge of a typical lithium-ion battery of the same size. Alternatively, the carmaker could install a smaller battery with less weight and keep the same range to contribute to lower the vehicle price as compared to lithium-ion batteries. [...] Recharging is estimated to take 14 hours from a 110 volt power supply, 7 hours from a 220 volt power supply and as little as 30 minutes from a quick charging station. The SCiB {{is available in the}} Japanese market. The U.S. has a more typical lithium ion battery.|$|E

Firstly, the results for Shannon capacity of fading channels with channel side information are reviewed, where the capacity is achieved by using an optimal power control scheme. Secondly, an optimal interference threshold α ∗ 0 is set for a given system outage probability Pout to minimize total interference. Finally, the <b>effective</b> channel <b>capacity</b> of WCDMA is defined and a target SIR level γ ∗ is derived with the Lagrangian multiplier method to maximize the <b>effective</b> channel <b>capacity.</b> It is shown that α ∗ 0 is dependent on the power control interference ratio (PCIR) ρ, the number of diversity paths identified by the receiver M, and the outage probability of the system. Simulation results are provided to validate the theoretical deductions.
