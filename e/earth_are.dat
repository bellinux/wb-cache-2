5|$|Ganymede is the Solar System's largest {{moon and}} the Solar System's only known moon with a magnetosphere, {{but this does not}} shield it from cosmic {{radiation}} to a noteworthy degree, because it is overshadowed by Jupiter's magnetic field. Ganymede receives about 0.08Sv (8rem) of radiation per day. Callisto is farther from Jupiter's strong radiation belt and subject to only 0.0001Sv (0.01rem) a day. For comparison, the average amount of radiation taken on Earth by a living organism is about 0.0024Sv per year; the highest natural radiation levels on <b>Earth</b> <b>are</b> recorded around Ramsar hot springs at about 0.26Sv per year.|$|E

5|$|Palaeobotanists study ancient {{plants in}} the fossil record to provide {{information}} about the evolutionary history of plants. Cyanobacteria, the first oxygen-releasing photosynthetic organisms on <b>Earth,</b> <b>are</b> thought to have given rise to the ancestor of plants by entering into an endosymbiotic relationship with an early eukaryote, ultimately becoming the chloroplasts in plant cells. The new photosynthetic plants (along with their algal relatives) accelerated the rise in atmospheric oxygen started by the cyanobacteria, changing the ancient oxygen-free, reducing, atmosphere to one in which free oxygen has been abundant for more than 2 billion years.|$|E
5|$|The {{theory of}} plate {{tectonics}} {{demonstrates that the}} continents of the <b>Earth</b> <b>are</b> moving across the surface {{at the rate of}} a few centimeters per year. This is expected to continue, causing the plates to relocate and collide. Continental drift is facilitated by two factors: the energy generation within the planet and the presence of a hydrosphere. With the loss of either of these, continental drift will come to a halt. The production of heat through radiogenic processes is sufficient to maintain mantle convection and plate subduction {{for at least the next}} 1.1 billion years.|$|E
50|$|Likewise, {{believing that}} the <b>Earth</b> <b>is</b> a sphere is less wrong than {{believing that the}} <b>Earth</b> <b>is</b> flat, but wrong nonetheless, since it is really an oblate {{spheroid}} or a reasonable approximation thereof.

5|$|The {{time frame}} of the Solar System's {{formation}} has been determined using radiometric dating. Scientists estimate that the Solar System is 4.6billion years old. The oldest known mineral grains on <b>Earth</b> <b>are</b> approximately 4.4billion years old. Rocks this old are rare, as Earth's surface is constantly being reshaped by erosion, volcanism, and plate tectonics. To estimate {{the age of the}} Solar System, scientists use meteorites, which were formed during the early condensation of the solar nebula. Almost all meteorites (see the Canyon Diablo meteorite) are found to have an age of 4.6billion years, suggesting that the Solar System must be at least this old.|$|E
5|$|Between {{the events}} of the first game and Halo 2, the Chief and a few other {{survivors}} return to Earth, warning of an impending Covenant attack; this attack forms the first mission of the game. Meanwhile, the Covenant, unaware of the destructive nature of the rings, attempt to fire another ring, Installation 05, to fulfill their religious prophecy and to do so launch an attack on Earth. Helping the Chief to defend the <b>Earth</b> <b>are</b> Sergeant Avery Johnson and Commander Miranda Keyes. One race in the Covenant, the Elites, learn the truth about the rings and are led by a former Elite commander named the Arbiter (also a player character) to join forces with humanity to stop the firing of the ring. Though they are successful, the unexpected shutdown of the installation triggers a fail-safe protocol, priming all the rings for firing from the Ark.|$|E
5|$|Earth's {{internal}} heat {{comes from}} a combination of residual heat from planetary accretion (about 20%) and heat produced through radioactive decay (80%). The major heat-producing isotopes within <b>Earth</b> <b>are</b> potassium-40, uranium-238, and thorium-232. At the center, the temperature may be up to , and the pressure could reach 360GPa. Because much of the heat is provided by radioactive decay, scientists postulate that early in Earth's history, before isotopes with short half-lives were depleted, Earth's heat production was much higher. At approximately , twice the present-day heat would have been produced, increasing the rates of mantle convection and plate tectonics, and allowing the production of uncommon igneous rocks such as komatiites that are rarely formed today.|$|E

5|$|Extinction is the {{disappearance}} of an entire species. Extinction is not an unusual event, as species regularly appear through speciation and disappear through extinction. Nearly all animal and plant species that have lived on <b>Earth</b> <b>are</b> now extinct, and extinction {{appears to be the}} ultimate fate of all species. These extinctions have happened continuously throughout the history of life, although the rate of extinction spikes in occasional mass extinction events. The Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, during which the non-avian dinosaurs became extinct, is the most well-known, but the earlier Permian–Triassic extinction event was even more severe, with approximately 96% of all marine species driven to extinction. The Holocene extinction event is an ongoing mass extinction associated with humanity's expansion across the globe over the past few thousand years. Present-day extinction rates are 100–1000 times greater than the background rate and up to 30% of current species may be extinct by the mid 21st century. Human activities are now the primary cause of the ongoing extinction event; global warming may further accelerate it in the future.|$|E
5|$|From 1830 to 1833, {{geologist}} Charles Lyell {{published his}} multi-volume work Principles of Geology, which, building on Hutton's ideas, advocated a uniformitarian {{alternative to the}} catastrophic theory of geology. Lyell claimed that, rather than being the products of cataclysmic (and possibly supernatural) events, the geologic features of the <b>Earth</b> <b>are</b> better explained {{as the result of}} the same gradual geologic forces observable in the present day—but acting over immensely long periods of time. Although Lyell opposed evolutionary ideas (even questioning the consensus that the fossil record demonstrates a true progression), his concept that the Earth was shaped by forces working gradually over an extended period, and the immense age of the Earth assumed by his theories, would strongly influence future evolutionary thinkers such as Charles Darwin.|$|E
5|$|Ghost {{takes place}} in the fictional {{universe}} of the StarCraft series. The series is set in a distant part of the galaxy called the Koprulu Sector and begins in the year 2499. Terran exiles from <b>Earth</b> <b>are</b> governed by a totalitarian empire, the Terran Dominion, that is opposed by several smaller rebel groups. Two alien races discover humanity: the insectoid Zerg, who begin to invade planets controlled by the Terrans; and the Protoss, an enigmatic race with strong psionic power that attempt to eradicate the Zerg. Ghost takes place four years after the conclusion of , in which the Zerg become the dominant power in the sector and leave both the Protoss and the Dominion in ruins. The game follows the story of Nova, a young ghost agent—a human espionage operative with psychic abilities—in the employ of the Dominion.|$|E

5|$|In his 2011 book Satellittkrigen, Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation {{journalist}} Bård Wormdal {{argues that}} SvalSat {{is used for}} military intelligence and thus is violating the Svalbard Treaty. Specifically, Wormdal provides evidence that downloaded images of the <b>earth</b> <b>are</b> used for intelligence and military activities. For instance, a Landsat image taken during the Libyan Civil War was sold by the Italian company e-GEOS to the Italian Armed Forces. Similarly, a Technology Experiment Satellite image was sold to the United States Armed Forces during the War in Afghanistan and Arirang-2 images of North Korean installations have been sold to the United States. All three satellites use SvalSat {{as one of their}} ground stations. According to Governor Odd Olsen Ingerø, even if a military should indirectly use information downloaded from SvalSat, this would not be a breach of the treaty. A dissertation by Professor Geir Ulfstein concludes that even if a ground station was directly used for downloading military intelligence from military satellites, it would still be permitted by the treaty.|$|E
