5|$|After he was arrested, Gonzalez gave {{permission}} for his vehicle, parked nearby, to be searched. Agents recovered 800 rounds of ammunition, two hatchets, and a machete <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>car.</b> Gonzalez {{was ordered to}} be held without bond until a detention hearing on October 1. Less than 24 hours later a 19-year-old man from New Jersey {{was arrested and charged}} with unlawful entry, after he initially tried to enter the White House on foot before returning in a vehicle, which he refused to exit at the checkpoint. There was no evidence to suggest the two incidents were related.|$|E
5|$|As in the {{previous}} years, there were two classes of cyclists, the coureurs de vitesse and the coureurs sur machines poinçonnées. Of the 93 cyclists starting the race, 82 were in the poinçonnée category, which meant {{that they had to}} finish the race on the same bicycle as they left, and if it was broken they had to fix it without assistance. The coureurs de vitesse could get help <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> with bicycle repairmen when they had to fix a bicycle, and when a bicycle was beyond repair, they could change it to a new one.|$|E

5|$|Inspector Altieri {{arrives at}} the house and Neal kills her. Giermani and Anne arrive soon afterwards; when Neal sees that he cannot escape, he slits his throat in front of them. Finding the {{telephone}} out of order, Giermani and Anne go outside to report the incident <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> radio. Giermani returns {{to the house and}} is murdered by Neal, who had faked his own death. Neal waits inside for Anne to return, but when she opens the door, she accidentally knocks over a metal sculpture that impales and kills Neal. The horror-stricken Anne stands in the rain and screams repeatedly.|$|E
5|$|That night, {{the boys}} dig up Isaac's grave and find his body intact. While {{retrieving}} tools <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>car,</b> {{one of the}} boys is brutally murdered. The next morning, Mulder and Scully find a book on Jewish mysticism buried with Isaac's body; it mysteriously bursts into flames. On the book is Jacob's name. The agents search for Jacob, finding him in a synagogue with the hanged body of the last remaining boy. Although Jacob admits to both of the murders, Mulder believes that a Golem—a creature from Jewish mysticism—is the true murderer.|$|E
5|$|The {{station is}} on an east-west alignment, curving towards the north. There is a single -long {{platform}} which serves trains in both directions, situated {{on the north side}} of the track. The station's southern platform was abandoned in 1970 and is overgrown. The station is only accessible via a footpath <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> park on Station Road, which is just off the A4 Portway.|$|E
5000|$|The {{greenhouse}} (or glasshouse) of a <b>car</b> comprises <b>the</b> windshield, {{rear and}} side windows, the pillars separating them (designated A-pillar, B-pillar and so on, starting <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>car's</b> front), and <b>the</b> <b>car's</b> roof.|$|R

5000|$|Because {{the doors}} stay within <b>the</b> <b>car's</b> track {{throughout}} their range of movement, they are useful when parking in tight spaces. A gullwing door style offers similar visibility, but the doors swing out <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>car's</b> area slightly.|$|R
5|$|Via a live news report, a {{high-speed}} car chase {{comes to an}} end in the Nevada desert. Assuming it to be a kidnapping, police pull the female passenger <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> and place her into the protective custody of a police vehicle. The driver, Patrick Crump (Bryan Cranston), is pushed to the asphalt and handcuffed. The woman in the police car begins violently banging her head against the car window. As the news chopper catches all of this on film, the woman's head explodes, sending a spray of blood across the window.|$|E
5|$|Alex deduces {{that since}} he intervened Death skipped Carter and moved onto Billy, and realises that he is next on Death's list. While hiding out in a {{fortified}} cabin Alex recalls switching seats with two girls in his premonition but not before the explosion in reality, meaning Clear is actually next, and he rushes to save her while being chased by agents. Meanwhile, Clear is trapped inside her car with a leaking gas tank, surrounded by loose live wires. Alex arrives in time to save Clear and grabs the wire, allowing her to escape <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> seconds before it explodes, leaving Alex incapacitated.|$|E
5|$|Alfonsín {{suffered}} {{a car crash}} in the Río Negro province in 1999, during the campaign of governor Pablo Verani. They were on Route6, and he was ejected <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> {{because he was not}} wearing a seat belt. He was hospitalized for 39 days. DelaRúa became president in the 1999 elections, defeating the governor of Buenos Aires, Eduardo Duhalde. Alfonsín was elected Senator for Buenos Aires Province in October 2001. DelaRúa resigned during the December 2001 riots, and the Congress appointed Adolfo Rodríguez Saá, who resigned as well. Alfonsín instructed the radical legislators to support Duhalde as the new president. He also gave him two ministers, Horacio Jaunarena for Defense and Jorge Vanossi for Justice. The radical support helped Duhalde overcome the ambitions of Carlos Ruckauf and José Manuel de la Sota, who also had ambitions to be appointed president. Alfonsín's health problems later in the year led him to step down, to be replaced by Diana Conti.|$|E

5|$|Common battery {{technologies}} used in today's home PV systems include, {{the valve}} regulated lead-acid battery– {{a modified version}} of the conventional lead–acid battery, nickel–cadmium and lithium-ion batteries. Lead-acid batteries are currently the predominant technology used in small-scale, residential PV systems, due to their high reliability, low self discharge and investment and maintenance costs, despite shorter lifetime and lower energy density. However, lithium-ion batteries have the potential to replace lead-acid batteries in the near future, as they are being intensively developed and lower prices are expected due to economies of scale provided by large production facilities such as the Gigafactory 1. In addition, the Li-ion batteries of plug-in electric cars may serve as a future storage devices in a vehicle-to-grid system. Since most vehicles are parked an average of 95 percent of the time, their batteries could be used to let electricity flow <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> to the power lines and back. Other rechargeable batteries used for distributed PV systems include, sodium–sulfur and vanadium redox batteries, two prominent types of a molten salt and a flow battery, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Facilities at {{the station}} are minimal– shelters, benches and {{timetable}} information are provided. Customer help points give live train information. There is no ticket office, and no self-service ticket machines {{which can be used}} to buy or collect tickets. The station car park is {{to the north of the}} platforms, with 40 spaces. There is step-free access to the northern platform <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> park, and a set of steps from the footbridge. There is also stepped access to the footbridge from the south, and a ramp down to the southern platform. There is no taxi rank, but there are bus stops on Whiteladies Road. Cycle storage is available on the platform.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} shootings, the {{soldiers}} donned berets to identify themselves. Gibraltar Police officers, including Inspector Revagliatte and his men, began {{to arrive at}} the scene almost immediately. At 16:05, only 25 minutes after assuming control, the SAS commander handed control of the operation back to the Gibraltar Police in a document stating:A military assault force completed the military option in respect of the terrorist ASU in Gibraltar and returns control to the civil power. Shortly after the shootings, soldiers and police officers evacuated buildings {{in the vicinity of the}} Convent, while bomb-disposal experts got to work; four hours later, the authorities announced that a car bomb had been defused, after which Savage's white Renault was towed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> park by an army truck. The SAS personnel, meanwhile, left Gibraltar on a Royal Air Force aircraft.|$|E

5|$|Norfolk Coast Path, {{an ancient}} long {{distance}} footpath, cuts {{across the south}} eastern corner of the reserve along the sea wall between the farmland and the salt marshes, and further west at Holme-next-the-Sea the trail joins Peddars Way. The tip of Blakeney Point {{can be reached by}} walking up the shingle spit <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> park at Cley Beach, or by boats from the quay at Morston. The boat gives good views of the seal colonies and avoids the long walk over a difficult surface. The National Trust has an information centre and tea room at the quay, and a visitor centre on the Point. The centre was formerly a lifeboat station and is open in the summer months. Halfway House, or the Watch House, is a building 2.4km (1.5mi) from Cley Beach car park. Originally built in the 19th century as a look-out for smugglers, it was used in succession as a coast guard station, by the Girl Guides, and as a holiday let.|$|E
5|$|The main {{access to}} the station is from Station Road to the east, however {{there is also a}} set of steps and a {{turnstile}} into the industrial estate to the west. Facilities at the station are minimal – there are small brick shelters on each platform, but no facilities for buying tickets. There are customer help points, giving next train information for both platforms, as well as dot-matrix displays showing the next trains on each platform. A pay and display car park with 15 spaces, and racks for four bicycles, are {{on the east side of}} the station on Station Road. CCTV cameras are in operation at the station. Access to the eastern platform is step-free <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> park, however there is no step-free access to trains. The only public {{access to the}} western platform is via the stepped footbridge.|$|E
5|$|The tenth caution {{was given}} on lap 243 when Harvick and Kyle Busch collided, {{resulting}} in Busch spinning sideways and colliding into the wall. His car was engulfed in flames, {{but he was}} pulled <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> by NASCAR personnel. At the lap 250 restart, Edwards was the leader, ahead of Johnson, Kenseth, and Harvick. On the following lap, Harvick passed Kenseth for third, as Hamlin fell to 21st. By lap 254, Edwards had less than a one-second lead over Johnson, while Harvick was 2.59 seconds behind. Edwards continued to increase his lead, as Hamlin passed Martin for 15th. With seven laps remaining, Edwards had a 1.67 second lead over Johnson. As Edwards crossed the finish line to win the race, Johnson won his fifth consecutive championship. Harvick finished third, ahead of Almirola and Allmendinger in fourth and fifth. Kahne, Newman, Stewart, Kenseth and Biffle rounded out the top ten finishers in the race.|$|E
5000|$|New RaceCam angles debuted for 1988. Along {{with the}} [...] "over-the-shoulder" [...] camera, {{there were also}} cameras facing {{backwards}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>cars,</b> {{as well as a}} cockpit camera looking up at the driver.|$|R
5000|$|The {{controls}} on <b>the</b> Birney <b>Car</b> also included an early {{application of the}} [...] "deadman control".
