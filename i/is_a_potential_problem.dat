The technique uses modified retroviruses to transform the cells; this <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>potential</b> <b>problem</b> for human therapy since these viruses integrate their genes at a random location in the host's genome, which can interrupt other genes and potentially causes cancer.|$|E
2500|$|The Bureau of Land Management has {{identified}} several environmental concerns {{with regard to}} the Fossil Lake site. [...] First, the fossil deposits extend beyond the boundary of the existing restricted area. [...] As a result, there is a risk that vehicles or grazing livestock may damage unprotected fossils. [...] Second, illegal fossil collecting <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>potential</b> <b>problem.</b> [...] Finally, loose surface sediments at Fossil Lake continue to erode, exposing new fossils each year. [...] When fossils are first exposed, they are often found as articulated skeletons. [...] However, the remains are quickly scattered due to wind action. [...] Sandy sediments carried by the wind also cause rapid weathering once the fossils are exposed. [...] As a result, scientists try to collect the newly exposed fossils as soon as possible.|$|E
2500|$|Drugs that {{influence}} nAChRs can be agonists, partial agonists or antagonists. [...] Agonists, e.g. nicotine, can however act as depolarizing agents when encountered to nAChRs {{for some time}} (seconds or minutes, depending on concentration and nAChR subtype), chronic exposure to agonist {{can also lead to}} long lasting functional deactivation because of rapid and persistent desensitization. [...] Partial nAChR agonists have been studied since they seem to be helpful in smoking cessation. The partial agonists are believed to bind to the nAChRs and stimulate the release of dopamine in smaller portions than the agonists and therefore compensate for the absence of nicotine.The lack of specificity among some of the nicotinic agonists is well known and <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>potential</b> <b>problem</b> when using them to treat illnesses that require targeting a specific subtype of nAChRs. Among these nonspecific agonists are for example ACh, nicotine and epibatidine that all target more than one subtype of nAChRs.|$|E
