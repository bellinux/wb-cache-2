2500|$|In a 2004 {{article in}} the libertarian monthly Reason, science {{journalist}} Ronald Bailey contested the assertions of Fukuyama by arguing that political equality has never rested on the facts of human biology. He asserts that liberalism was founded not on the proposition of <b>effective</b> <b>equality</b> of human beings, or de facto equality, but on the assertion of an equality in political rights and before the law, or de jure equality. Bailey asserts that the products of genetic engineering may well ameliorate rather than exacerbate human inequality, giving to the many what were once the privileges of the few. Moreover, he argues, [...] "the crowning achievement of the Enlightenment is the principle of tolerance". In fact, he says, political liberalism is already {{the solution to the}} issue of human and posthuman rights since in liberal societies the law is meant to apply equally to all, no matter how rich or poor, powerful or powerless, educated or ignorant, enhanced or unenhanced. Other thinkers who are sympathetic to transhumanist ideas, such as philosopher Russell Blackford, have also objected to the appeal to tradition and what they see as alarmism involved in Brave New World-type arguments.|$|E

40|$|In {{recent years}} we have {{witnessed}} concerted efforts to achieve real equality {{between men and women}} through legislative reform in the European Union (i. e., EU Directives 2002 / 73 /EC; 76 / 207 /EEC), and na-tionwide in Spain (e. g., Law 3 / 2007, of 22 March, for <b>Effective</b> Gender <b>Equality)</b> as well as regional leg-islation (e. g., Law 7 / 2004, 16 July, Galician Law for the Equality of Women and Men). In view of the principle of equal rights enshrined in legislative reform, one would expect social change entailing the re-moval of existing inequalities on the grounds of sex. In order to explore the views of Spanish youth re-garding gender equality, a pioneering field study was carried out to assess their knowledge of current leg-islation, and to examine their views towards gender equality, particularly in relation to specific issues such as family, divorce, separation, joint-custody, sexual relationships, education, and employment. More-over, perceived or real models of equality were contrasted with ideal or desired models of equality. Thus, a total of 2071 Spanish undergraduates were administered an ad hoc questionnaire. The results reveal the vast majority of undergraduates favoured gender equality, and the equal participation of women and men in family and working life as well as joint-custody in cases of divorce or separation. Nevertheless, differ-ences in gender were observed i. e., more women supported policies promoting the principle of equality than men. The findings underscore the need for implementing intervention strategies designed to foste...|$|R
40|$|While {{local governments}} are {{increasingly}} being vested with control over funds for public goods, concern over the capture of decentralized funds by local elites has led decentralization to be combined with central mandates which require a certain proportion of funds to directly benefit the poor. If local capture is pervasive, however, central mandates may not be effective. Despite the popularity of this combination of decentralization and centralized control, there is little empirical evidence which separately identifies their effect on investment in public goods, and hence assesses the effectiveness of central mandates. This paper provides such evidence, using data collected by the authors for the North Indian state of Punjab, an economy where economic conditions facilitate such an analysis. We find that central mandates are <b>effective,</b> enhancing intra-village <b>equality</b> in expenditure on public goods. This finding informs {{the debate on the}} equity effects of centralized versus decentralized programs. Public goods Central mandates Decentralization...|$|R
40|$|For a {{multiplexer}} fed by a {{large number}} of sources, we derive conditions under which a given subset of the sources can be substituted for a single source while preserving the buffer overflow probability and the dominant timescales of buffer overflows. This notion of traffic equivalence is stronger than simple <b>effective</b> bandwidth <b>equality</b> and depends on the multiplexing context. We propose several applications of the above traffic substitution conditions. First, we show that fractional Brownian motion as a single source substitute can effectively model {{a large number of}} multiplexed sources using information obtained purely from traffic traces; this has direct application to simple but accurate traffic generation. Second, we focus on dynamic (i. e., on-line) estimation of available capacity and buffer overflow probability. This requires the solution of a double optimization problem expressed in terms of functions whose values are obtained from time averages of the traffic traces over a large range of timescales. We show how to solve this problem on-line by reducing it to the calculation of a fixed-point equation that can be solved iteratively by combining traffic substitution using fractional Brownian motion with dynamic measurements of the actual traffic. We have validated this approach by extensive experimentation with large numbers of real traffic sources that are fed to a high bandwidth link, and comparing our on-line estimation of available capacity and the resulting dynamic call admission control with other existing approaches. The superior accuracy of our approach also suggests that taking the buffer size into account, as does our on-line algorithm, may be vital for achieving approximations of practical interest...|$|R

In 1992 she started her collaboration in CREA (Centre of Research in Theories and Practices that Overcome Inequalities) taking part in the initial team of the research center together with Ramon Flecha. One of the research lines promoted by Lídia Puigvert in the center of research from its beginning is the inclusion of the other women’s voices, non academic women who have been excluded even from the feminist debates. Such contribution became consolidated in her theoretical contribution of dialogic feminism. Within the feminism sphere, Lídia Puigvert also contributed in another of the highlighted theoretical areas of her career path, the overcoming of gender violence. After her involvement in the research on this topic, she promoted together with the CREA-SAFO Women’s Group the need to break the silence on gender violence at the Spanish Universities in January 2004, {{in the context of a}} hostile environment in which there was neither mechanisms of prevention nor detection of gender violence at the Spanish universities. As a result of her positioning a discredit campaign was initiated by a lobby of university harassers who wanted to maintain the silence on gender violence at the Spanish universities. Despite the personal cost of such harassment, Lídia Puigvert together with the CREA-SAFO Women’s Group continued the research on this topic, and the results of their research achieved an impact in the Law for the <b>Effective</b> <b>equality</b> between men and women from 2007 [...] in which it was legislated the obligatory nature of all Spanish universities to have commissions of equality and protocols against gender violence. Such work conducted and compromise was acknowledged by Sarah Rankin, director of the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response at Harvard University [...] in 2010. In the course of this persecution by the lobby of university harassers, her husband, Jesús Gómez, died.Another of her theoretical contributions within the area of overcoming gender violence has been the prevention of such from the development of the concept preventive socialization of gender violence [...] started by Jesús Gómez. The theoretical contribution has been published in several JCR scientific articles and is one of the bases of the dialogic model of conflict resolution.Currently Lídia Puigvert is researching how to prevent women trafficking to avoid that many girls and young women fall into prostitution networks, another of the most violent social phenomena of these days that affects millions of women, continuing therefore with her academic, social and personal compromise to improve the lives of girls around the world, specially the most vulnerable ones.|$|E

40|$|Women {{participation}} in Nigerian politics {{is crucial to}} the development of Nigeria and since women constitute a sizeable proportion of the population, neglecting them may mean losing their valuable contribution. Traditional socio-economic and political and cultural structures aid discrimination against women leading to loss of contributions of women to societal development. Raising the status of women through gender empowerment has is considered in certain quarters as vital in the quest towards improvement in living standards and wellbeing of the masses in economies transiting to stability. Despite global efforts to improve the poor conditions of women through numerous conventions and conferences such as CEDAW, MDGs among others, gender discrimination has not ceased. The paper aims at throwing light on gender discrimination, obstacles to gender equality and suggests strategies for promoting <b>effective</b> gender <b>equality</b> and empowerment of women. Using secondary data, from the Nigerian Bureau of Statistics, the paper found that gender discrimination exists in all variable indicators considered. Current status of Nigerian women in relation to men in the areas of education, income, labor force and share of seats in parliament or level of political participation were considered. Some of the main factors militating against women’s effective {{participation in}} politics are illiteracy, poverty, money politics, instrument of intimidation, harmful traditional practices and discriminatory cultural stereotypes, violence against women, barriers by electoral process, and religious barriers. It is suggested that more efforts are required by civil society groups and government agencies for greater awareness on gender issues and rekindling efforts of all stakeholders in the quest to formulating policies and programs towards reduction of gender inequality...|$|R

Small- and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs) comprise over 99 per cent of enterprises in the United Kingdom, and account for 60 per cent of employment in the private sector, however previous {{research has shown that}} many SMEs possess no specific expertise on human resource practices or employment law. This could expose businesses to risk of grievances and employment tribunal claims, and result in unfair treatment for their workers. For these reasons SMEs were the focus of this research study. The aims of the research project were: 1) to understand the knowledge, attitudes and practices of SME employers in relation to their duties under the Equality Act 2010, for example ensuring individuals with protected characteristics are treated fairly in recruitment, promotion and employment, and 2) to understand the knowledge, attitudes and practices of SME employers in managing human rights issues in the workplace such as just and favourable remuneration, access to redress, working hours, and a safe working environment.

We obtain exact results incorporating all higher order quantum corrections in the limit when only one of the charges, representing momentum along an internal direction, approaches infinity keeping all other charges fixed at arbitrary finite values. In this limit, we find that the microscopic index is controlled by certain anomaly coefficients whereas the macroscopic index is controlled by the coefficients of certain Chern-Simons terms in the <b>effective</b> action. The <b>equality</b> between the macroscopic and the microscopic index then follows as a consequence of anomaly inflow. In contrast, the absolute degeneracy does not have any such simple expression in terms of the anomaly coefficients or coefficients of Chern-Simons terms.

40|$|BackgroundThe ideal {{treatment}} for blunt brachial artery (BBA) injury in pediatric patients is controversial. We compared outcomes of surgical and nonsurgical management of BBA injury using the National Trauma Data Bank. MethodsAll patients younger than 18  years {{who had suffered}} BBA injury were identified in the pediatric National Trauma Data Bank (2002 - 2010) by Current Procedural Terminology code. Patients with a penetrating mechanism of injury were excluded. By the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision procedure codes, patients were stratified {{on the basis of}} treatment modality: observation vs arterial surgery. Outcomes including upper extremity amputation, mortality, and intensive care unit length of stay were compared between the two groups by two-sample t-test or χ 2 test as appropriate. ResultsAmong 119 patients with BBA injury, 49 patients (41. 2 %) underwent arterial surgery and 70 patients (58. 8 %) were observed. Patients treated with observation were significantly younger, whereas other characteristics including gender and Injury Severity Score were similar. There was no difference in the type of hospital (academic vs nonacademic) or trauma center category between the groups. Two amputations were identified in the database, and both were in the 13 - to 17 -year age group of the observation cohort (vs arterial surgery; P =. 22). There were eight fasciotomies identified; five were in the arterial surgery group (10. 2 % vs observation, 4. 3 %; P =. 20). No amputation or fasciotomy was required in the 0 - to 6 -year age group.
