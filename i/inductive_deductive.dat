40|$|Inducing concept {{descriptions}} in First Order Logic {{is inherently}} a complex task. There {{are two main}} reasons: on one hand, the task is usually formulated as a search problem inside a very large space of logical descriptions which needs strong heuristics to be kept to manageable size. On the other hand, most developed algorithms are unable to handle numerical features, typically occurring in realworld data. In this paper, we describe the learning system SMART+, that embeds sophisticated knowledge-based heuristics to control the search process {{and is able to}} deal with numerical features. SMART+ can use different learning strategies, such as <b>inductive,</b> <b>deductive</b> and abductive ones, and exploits both backgruond knowledge and statistical evaluation criteria.

40|$|Socio-Economics is a multi-disciplinary, {{holistic}} approach to economics that has gained growing acceptance in legal education and that is helpful in advocating economics justice. Socio-economics approaches economic understanding much as Adam Smith did (before there were separate disciplines) with a foundation based on natural and moral philosophy. Nevertheless, it explicitly acknowledges the powerful and pervasive influence of the neoclassical paradigm on contemporary thought. Recognizing that people first adopt paradigms of thought and then perform their <b>inductive,</b> <b>deductive,</b> and empirical analyses, socio-economists seek to examine the assumptions of the neoclassical paradigm, develop a rigorous understanding of its limitations, improve upon its application, and develop alternative, perhaps complementary, approaches that are predictive, exemplary, and morally sound.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study has been to examine students’ {{participation}} when using <b>inductive</b> and <b>deductive</b> teaching methods. The aim have been to see how different teachers work while teaching science to students in primary school. We also want to find out how the individual teachers reflect on their own teaching based on our focus on <b>inductive</b> and <b>deductive</b> teaching, and explore differences in students' participation in the different teaching methods. We have used the following questions: In what ways differs <b>inductive</b> and <b>deductive</b> teaching methods in science in the investigated classes? Do the teachers think that they adapt science instruction based on selected methods? Is it possible to see differences between the two methods when it comes to students' participation in the investigated situation? The study is based on a qualitative method with eight classroom observations and four interviews with class teachers. Our study is based on the social constructivist perspective.   Our conclusions are that operations during the observed lessons were essentially inductive, regardless of which of the methods used during the introduction or conclusion of the lesson. We have seen in our study that teachers have chosen teaching method based on the purpose of the lesson and the composition of the group. All teachers believe that they make use of both teaching methods. The result shows that that we cannot see any clear differences when it comes to students' participation in terms of <b>inductive</b> and <b>deductive</b> methods of teaching. Possibly we can see that there is a tendency that inductive teaching promotes participation among students. ...|$|R

We describe recent extensions to the capabilities of this suite which have enabled it to handle problems outside of the algebraic domains {{for which it was}} designed. We demonstrate two of many advantages to having such a translation suite. Firstly, we show that an ability to translate between the syntaxes of different AI problem solving systems enables us to make meaningful comparisons of different AI techniques, and we demonstrate this using a model generator and a constraint solver on quasigroup problems. Secondly, with an ability to express a problem in different ways, we can begin to simulate more sophisticated problem solving which uses <b>inductive,</b> <b>deductive</b> and constraint solving techniques. We explore such possibilities with some applications to investigative reasoning, where the aim is to identify the cause of a phenomenon from a set of candidates. ...|$|E

40|$|Even with {{impressive}} {{advances in}} automated formal methods, certain problems in system verification and synthesis remain challenging. Examples include the verification of quantitative properties of software involving constraints on timing and energy consumption, and the automatic synthesis of systems from specifications. The major challenges include environment modeling, incompleteness in specifications, and {{the complexity of}} underlying decision problems. This position paper proposes sciduction, an approach to tackle these challenges by integrating <b>inductive</b> inference, <b>deductive</b> reasoning, and structure hypotheses. Deductive reasoning, which leads from general rules or concepts to conclusions about specific problem instances, includes techniques such as logical inference and constraint solving. Inductive inference, which generalizes from specific instances to yield a concept, includes algorithmic learning from examples. Structure hypotheses are used to define the class of artifacts, such as invariants or program fragments, generated during verification or synthesis. Sciduction constrains <b>inductive</b> and <b>deductive</b> reasoning using structure hypotheses, and actively combines <b>inductive</b> and <b>deductive</b> reasoning: for instance, deductive techniques generate examples for learning, and inductive reasoning is used to guide the deductive engines. We illustrate this approach with three applications: (i) timing analysis of software; (ii) synthesis of loop-free programs, and (iii) controller synthesis for hybrid systems. Some future applications are also discussed. ...|$|R

The contracts include Bay ‘Bithaman Ajil (BBA), Murabahah, Musharakah Mutanaqisah, and Istisna`. More than 10 banks still use the BBA contract while others begin to focus on the use of equity-based financing contracts such as Musharakah Mutanaqisah. In Malaysia, sales of a house can take place even before the house is built or when it is still under construction. Therefore, Islamic home financing products must be offered through an appropriate contract to ensure they encompass fair and compassionate elements consistent with the Islamic rules. Selection of a proper contract is crucial to circumvent the stigma that Islamic banking is unjust in cases of abandoned houses. Hence, this article tries to see how this problem is addressed specifically in four Islamic products; Bay ‘Bithaman Ajil (BBA), Murabahah, Musharakah Mutanaqisah, and Istisna’. In its analysis, this study applies three methods; <b>inductive,</b> <b>deductive</b> and comparative methods.
