40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the restoring <b>force</b> <b>characteristics</b> of Steel-Hoop-Concrete (SHC) composite column. Cyclic-loading experiments {{in which the}} point of inflection is fixed are generally carried out in order to estimate the restoring <b>force</b> <b>characteristics</b> of SRC or RC column. But {{at the time of}} earthquake, top end and bottom end of column get independent end rotations, and the point of inflection moves in column. Considering that there is few bond between concrete and steel in SHC column, the restoring <b>force</b> <b>characteristics</b> of SHC column cannot be sufficiently estimated only by the above experiments. So the following experiments were carried out. The experimental parameters are the amount of hoop reinforcements and compelled end rotation history. Nine specimens of 21 cm × 21 cm cross section and 80 cm length were tested. H-shaped steel (SS 41, 150 × 100 × 3. 2 × 4. 5) was encased in each specimen and the compressive strength of concrete was about 450 kg/cm^ 2. The experimental results were examined analytically using Degrading Stiffness Tri-Linear Model (D-Tri Model) and Giberson's End Spring Model. The following conclusions were obtained in this study. (1) The ultimate strength of SHC composite column can be roughly estimated by additional theorem. (2) The restoring <b>force</b> <b>characteristic</b> of SHC column with sufficient hoop reinforcements are stable even when the independent compelled end rotation histories act on both ends of column. (3) The restoring <b>force</b> <b>characteristics</b> of SHC column can be roughly formulated by using D-Tri Model when end rotation histories of both ends of column are the same. (4) The restoring <b>force</b> <b>characteristic</b> of SHC column can be roughly formulated by using Giberson's End Spring Model except for the case that the uniform bending moment act on the column...|$|R

In this study, half-scale three column specimens with low strength concrete and plain bars were tested until they came up to ultimate collapse.

50|$|Person. Bronfenbrenner {{acknowledges}} {{here the}} relevance of biological and genetic aspects of the person. However, he devoted {{more attention to the}} personal characteristics that individuals bring with them into any social situation. He divided these characteristics into three types' demand, resource, and <b>force</b> <b>characteristics.</b> Demand characteristics are those that act as an immediate stimulus to another person, such as age, gender, skin color, and physical appearance. These types of characteristics may influence initial interactions because of the expectations formed immediately. Resource characteristics are those that relate partly to mental and emotional resources such as past experiences, skills, and intelligence, and also to social and material resources (access to good food, housing, caring parents, and educational opportunities appropriate {{to the needs of the}} particular society). Finally, <b>force</b> <b>characteristics</b> are those that have to do with differences of temperament, motivation, and persistence. According to Bronfenbrenner, two children may have equal resource characteristics, but their developmental trajectories will be quite different if one is motivated to succeed and persists in tasks and the other is not motivated and does not persist. As such, Bronfenbrenner provided a clearer view of individuals' roles in changing their context. The change can be relatively passive (a person changes the environment simply by being in it), to more active (the ways in which the person changes the environment are linked to his or her resource characteristics, whether physical, mental, or emotional), to most active (the extent to which the person changes the environment is linked, in part, to the desire and drive to do so, or <b>force</b> <b>characteristics).</b>|$|R
