But a lot of bad things too, unnecessarily harassing people – I would class that as a bad thing.

5|$|Meanwhile, Brian {{tries to}} join Peter's group, but Peter says it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> idea because Quagmire dislikes him. Brian {{attempts}} {{to rectify the}} situation outside Quagmire's house. However, Brian ends up making things worse by mistaking Quagmire's sister, who is hiding out from her abusive boyfriend, {{for one of his}} dates. Brian tricks Quagmire into going to dinner with him by making him think Cheryl Tiegs, Quagmire's long-lost love, is the one inviting him.|$|E
5|$|Peter is {{disappointed}} since Francis did {{not care}} about him – so he gives up drinking and does crack instead. Brian notices this, and tells Peter that crack <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> substitute for drinking. As a result, Peter sees a hypnotherapist, who helps him discover that Francis was not his biological father. When Peter goes to his mom, Thelma Griffin, about it, she reveals that she {{had an affair with}} an Irish man named Mickey McFinnigan and that Mickey is Peter's biological father.|$|E

5|$|Plutonium, {{like most}} metals, has a bright silvery {{appearance}} at first, much like nickel, but it oxidizes {{very quickly to}} a dull gray, although yellow and olive green are also reported. At room temperature plutonium is in its α (alpha) form. This, the most common structural form of the element (allotrope), is about as hard and brittle as gray cast iron unless it is alloyed with other metals to make it soft and ductile. Unlike most metals, it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> conductor of heat or electricity. It has a low melting point (640°C) and an unusually high boiling point (3,228°C).|$|E
5|$|Body {{piercing}} jewellery should be hypoallergenic. A number of materials are used, with varying strengths and weaknesses. Surgical stainless steel, niobium and titanium {{are commonly used}} metals, with titanium {{the least likely to}} cause allergic reaction of the three. Platinum and palladium are also safe alternatives, even in fresh piercings. Initial piercings should never be done with gold of any grade, as gold is mixed with other metals, and sterling silver <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> alternative in a piercing, as it may cause allergies in initial piercings and will tarnish in piercings of any age. An additional risk for allergic reaction may arise when the stud or clasp of jewellery is made from a different metal than the primary piece.|$|E
5|$|While Homer {{longs for}} his wife, Moe comes by the Simpsons' house to declare his {{interest}} in Marge, who turns him down. When Homer comes into the house with flowers he picked for Marge, Moe sees him and jumps out the window. Standing before her in rags, Homer professes his total and utter dependency on Marge, and she tells him that that <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> thing, but Homer then makes his winning argument: he loves her, he needs her to love him, and {{can not afford to}} ever lose her trust again or he will end up dead. Marge is won over and allows Homer to return to the house. The family is glad that he has returned, although Moe is less than thrilled.|$|E

40|$|Non{{destructive}} {{and destructive}} measures {{of color and}} firmness were studied to determine the feasibility of predicting the level of damage to clingstone peaches during mechanical pitting. Nondestructive and destructive measures of firmness were equally variable when measuring the firmness at three equatorial cheek locations (coefficient of variation of about 17 %), both had inverse relationships {{with the level of}} pitting damage (r 2 ranged from 0. 70 to 0. 83), and could classify peaches into two categories (those subject to and those not subject to pitting damage) with classification accuracies of 75. 2 % and 81. 7 %, respectively. Destructive firmness <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> predictor of nondestructive firmness in clingstone peaches.

25|$|Like most {{old world}} tarantulas, the female orange baboon spider digs a burrow, or uses a burrow {{that has been}} abandoned.

25|$|Hot in-place recycling. Bituminous {{pavement}} {{is heated}} to 250 to 300°F (120 to 150°C), milled, {{combined with a}} rejuvenating agent or virgin asphalt binder, and compacted. It may then be overlaid with a new asphalt overlay. This process only recycles the top two inches (50mm) or less, {{so it can be}} used to correct rutting, polishing or other surface defects. It <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> procedure for roads with structural failures. It also generates high heat and vapor emissions, and may not be a good candidate for built-up areas.|$|E
25|$|The OH group <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> leaving {{group in}} {{nucleophilic}} substitution reactions, so neutral alcohols do not react in such reactions. However, if the oxygen is first protonated to give R−OH2+, the leaving group (water) {{is much more}} stable, and the nucleophilic substitution can take place. For instance, tertiary alcohols react with hydrochloric acid to produce tertiary alkyl halides, where the hydroxyl group {{is replaced by a}} chlorine atom by unimolecular nucleophilic substitution. If primary or secondary alcohols are to be reacted with hydrochloric acid, an activator such as zinc chloride is needed. In alternative fashion, the conversion may be performed directly using thionyl chloride.|$|E

25|$|Cheek v. United States, , was a United States Supreme Court case {{in which}} the Court {{reversed}} the conviction of John L. Cheek, a tax protester, for willful failure to file tax returns and tax evasion. The Court held that an actual good-faith belief that one is not violating the tax law, based on a misunderstanding caused by the complexity of the tax law, negates willfulness, even if that belief is irrational or unreasonable. The Court also ruled that an actual belief that the tax law is invalid or unconstitutional <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> faith belief based on a misunderstanding caused by the complexity of the tax law, and is not a defense.|$|E
25|$|A few {{species are}} {{nuisance}} pests. Zabrus {{is one of}} the few herbivorous ground beetle genera, and on rare occasions Zabrus tenebrioides, for example, occurs abundantly enough to cause some damage to grain crops. Large species, usually Carabinae, can become a nuisance if present in numbers, particularly during outdoor activities such as camping; they void their defensive secretions when threatened, and in hiding among provisions their presence may spoil food. Since ground beetles are generally reluctant or even unable to fly, mechanically blocking their potential routes of entry is usually easy. The use of insecticides specifically for Carabid intrusion may lead to unfortunate side effects, such as the release of their repugnatorial secretions, so it generally <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> idea unless the same applications are intended to exclude ants, parasites or other crawling pests.|$|E
