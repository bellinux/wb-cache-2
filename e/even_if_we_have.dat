The fastest ones are moving at a velocity corresponding to a kinetic energy equal to the Fermi energy. This is the Fermi velocity. Only when the temperature exceeds the Fermi temperature do the electrons begin to move significantly faster than at absolute zero.|$|E
500|$|Themistocles {{died with}} his {{reputation}} in tatters, a traitor to the Athenian people; the [...] "saviour of Greece" [...] {{had turned into}} the enemy of liberty. However, his reputation in Athens was rehabilitated by Pericles in the 450sBC, {{and by the time}} Herodotus wrote his history, Themistocles was once again seen as a hero. Thucydides evidently held Themistocles in some esteem, and is uncharacteristically flattering in his praise for him (see above). Diodorus also extensively praises Themistocles, going as far as to offer a rationale for the length at which he discusses him: [...] "Now {{on the subject of the}} high merits of Themistocles, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> dwelt over-long on the subject in this digression, we believed it not seemly that we should leave his great ability unrecorded." [...] Indeed, Diodorus goes so far as to say that [...] "But if any man, putting envy aside, will estimate closely not only the man's natural gifts but also his achievements, he will find that on both counts Themistocles holds first place among all of whom we have record. Therefore one may well be amazed that the Athenians were willing to rid themselves of a man of such genius." [...] Since Diodorus's history includes such luminaries as Alexander the Great and Hannibal, this is high praise indeed. Plutarch offers a more nuanced view of Themistocles, with more of a critique of Themistocles's character. He does not detract from Themistocles's achievements, but also highlights his failings.|$|E

60|$|Neither you nor I {{could have}} done better than that, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> been strong enough.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{just for}} the present {{it would have been}} better, sir; but <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> had time I would not <b>have</b> done it. <b>We</b> should not <b>have</b> much chance of {{overhauling}} the Phantom <b>if</b> <b>we</b> clipped our wings." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{do believe}} you are right," [...] said I, [...] "and that is why she {{has been waiting for}} all these days, keeping us bottled up so that <b>we</b> could not <b>have</b> got away <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> had a breeze." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{thinks we}} can go through the swamp <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> no boat: but, in my opinion, the danger of {{contracting}} the fever is too great." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{the place}} is ours--father bought and paid for it," [...] added Paul, warmly. [...] "And we intend to get Captain Grady out, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> to fight him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Strangers seem to {{have taken}} matters in their own hands for once" [...] Eleanor smiled. [...] "We've made up our minds to stay, Phil, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> to stand." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{how are we}} to do that, Hans? We {{might make}} the framework, but <b>we</b> <b>have</b> no canvas to cover it with. Besides, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>had,</b> I have no idea of the {{direction}} of Singapore, and I doubt <b>if</b> <b>we</b> could find our way back to Java." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{should have}} brought Ki with us, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> to carry him bound, that he might {{interpret}} this marvel, for it is sure {{that no one else}} can." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly, my lord," [...] Beorn said. [...] "We {{have neither}} family nor {{relations}} {{to keep us}} at home, and <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> it would not suffice {{to keep us from}} following your banner." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Some day, Sam, I suppose we'll {{be taking}} in you and Grace," [...] went on Tom, with a grin. [...] "Well, we'll do it <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> {{to get a}} larger apartment." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, we can try," [...] {{the admiral}} said, laughing; [...] "it is clear we must eat, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> {{to fight for}} it; and hungry as we all are, {{we do not want}} to wait." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There's {{one thing}} I'm going to insist on," [...] Carroll declared. [...] "We'll leave enough {{provisions}} on board to last us {{until we get}} back to civilization, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> a head wind. I've made one or two journeys on short rations." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'What {{would you}} do with a cow?' asked Matte. 'She could not swim so far, and our boat is not large enough to bring her over here; and <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> her, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> nothing to feed her on.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{have got}} a compass; besides, we should manage very well <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> not. Look at the sun, Dan. There it is right ahead of us. So, you know that's the west--that's the way <b>we</b> <b>have</b> to go." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There are {{too many}} 'if's' in that suggestion," [...] remarked the little Wizard. [...] "And you must {{remember}} {{that the other side}} is nothing but spinning mountains, so we couldn't possibly fasten a rope to them, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> one." ...|$|R
6000|$|After breakfast Mina {{repeated}} her question. He {{looked at}} her gravely {{for a minute and}} then said sorrowfully, [...] "Because my dear, dear Madam Mina, now more than ever must we find him <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> to follow him to the jaws of Hell!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{can have}} one glass with your breakfast, {{and that is}} all. After this {{you can have the}} {{regulation}} ship's grog, with the other sailors. But getting drunk has got to be stopped, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> to dump all the liquor into the ocean." ...|$|E
6000|$|Barrington's eyes twinkled. [...] "Who {{has been}} {{teaching}} you commercial economy? You are too pretty to understand such things, and the argument is fallacious, because the wheat is consumed in Europe--and <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> not much to offer, they can get plenty from California, Chile, India, and Australia." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Secondly, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> the {{capacity}} to magically relocate the millions of illegals, the economic disruption from such an abrupt change would make the transition more painful than {{it needs to be}} for those businesses that have become addicted to illegal labor." ...|$|R
6000|$|He paused, {{then added}} fiercely, [...] "I tell you, Horace, that <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> guns, food, and yaks, I would not turn back upon our spoor, since {{to do so}} would prove me a coward and unworthy of her. I will go on." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Perhaps he may, then, {{insist upon}} our {{marriage}} at once!' Stephen answered, seeing {{a ray of}} hope in the very focus of her remorse. 'I hope he may, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> still to part till I am ready for you, as we intended.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I reckon what I'll put out won't bust me, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> 'greed to whack up fifteen cents apiece. Bill, Teddy, an' me will chip in for Jip, so's he {{can have}} a good time after all his hard luck, an' we'll make your eyes stick out before it's over." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It can't be done, sir!" [...] the man groaned. [...] "There isn't a car {{ever built}} {{could get through}} that. See, it's nearly {{up to the top}} of those posts. I must put her in the reverse and get back, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> to wait on the higher part of the road for a boat." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{is no need}} {{to answer}} that {{question}} now, mother dear," [...] Mark said, gently. [...] "We'll try to pull him through, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> already done our best to kill him, and then he'll {{know what it is to}} have coals of fire heaped on his head; that is," [...] he added, after a brief pause, [...] "if his comrades allow us to live long enough to do the job." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{could hardly}} bear {{to have you}} go away," [...] said Mrs. Dare. [...] "It would be so lonely--your father and you both out of the house. I would rather <b>have</b> you home, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> a good deal less to live upon." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Jake, it is {{fortunate}} indeed {{that you were}} on the spot, for they could scarcely have missed all of us. Besides, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> got to shore safely, they would have followed us, and the odds against us would have been heavy." ...|$|R
3000|$|... [Situations can] {{become quite}} {{political}} and I {{would have to}} think carefully what {{the politics of the}} situation were in making that decision. <b>Even</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> a manual, I couldn’t just go to the manual. So it’s very much outcomes/politics rather than procedures and policies.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I am {{with the}} others," [...] Harry said. [...] "I don't like {{the look of}} those clouds. They are quiet enough now, but they may begin to shift any time, and, as you say, if we are caught in a {{snow-storm}} on the hills there is an end of us. I think Sam is right. <b>Even</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> to rustle all through the winter in that hut there, I would rather face it than keep on." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You {{will trust}} us {{for taking care}} of our dear Theodora,' said Miss Gardner; 'we know she is rather high-spirited, and not very fond of control. I can quite enter into your {{feelings}} of responsibility, but from my knowledge of her character, I should say that any sense of restraint is most galling to her. But <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> not the pleasure of Captain Martindale's company, you may fully reckon on our watching over her, myself in especial, as a most dear younger sister.' ...|$|E
60|$|Happy Mrs. Pryor! She {{was still}} praying, {{unconscious}} that the summer sun hung above the hills, when her child softly woke in her arms. No piteous, unconscious moaning--sound which so wastes our strength that, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> sworn to be firm, {{a rush of}} unconquerable tears sweeps away the oath--preceded her waking. No space of deaf apathy followed. The first words spoken were not those of one becoming estranged from this world, and already permitted to stray at times into realms foreign to the living. Caroline evidently remembered with clearness what had happened.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{hope they}} won't keep us here all that time," [...] Dick said, [...] "for cavalry can't do {{much in a}} siege; besides, the ground is all cut up into gardens and inclosures, and we could not act, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> orders to do so." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'The {{insurance}} office {{sounds the}} best, {{and would be}} the least shock to our belongings,' said Annaple; 'but it seems to lead to nothing. He would not get on unless <b>we</b> <b>had</b> capital to invest, and <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> any, you wouldn't catch us doing that again!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... “I don’t see how,” {{answered}} Dave. “Our rowboat is on {{the other}} side of the island. Besides, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> a boat, I don’t believe we could catch them before the schooner got underway. Oh, isn’t it a shame!” And Dave fairly ground his teeth in helpless dismay.|$|R
