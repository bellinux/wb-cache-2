5|$|Mace {{discovers the}} fugitives {{and refuses to}} let them <b>go</b> <b>or</b> help find Morrow. The Ghost Rider attacks and defeats Mace, only sparing his life because of Gabe's pleading. Coulson convinces Mace that Robbie can be prosecuted later, and {{that they need to}} stop Lucy now. When they find Lucy, Robbie destroys her, but not before she reveals that Morrow wanted the Darkholds power for himself and had {{intentionally}} turned her into this ghostly state. Coulson finds Morrow, to see him attempt an experiment on himself. An energy blast from the experiment makes Coulson, Robbie, and agent Leo Fitz disappear, and Morrow successfully displays the ability to create matter.|$|E
5|$|Although {{enjoyment}} {{factored into}} Culverhouse's {{purchase of the}} Buccaneers, it was {{first and foremost a}} business decision which he expected to be profitable. He admitted to being known for his frugality, due to moves such as wearing outdated clothing, and having the One Buc Place walls painted white to avoid having to spend money on projection screens. This was not initially a problem for the franchise, even though the budget airplane that Culverhouse chartered for the team almost crashed after their very first game; original coach John McKay reported in 1978 that Culverhouse had never blocked any deals, even those involving a great amount of money. Later, however, the team let <b>go</b> <b>or</b> traded away many of its players who were highly paid and/or demanded more money, including Dave Pear, Doug Williams, Ricky Reynolds, Reggie Cobb, Mark Carrier, and Jeris White. First-round draft choices were frequently traded for players who were not considered to be of equal value, as when the team traded for often-injured defensive end Wally Chambers without requiring that he first pass a physical examination. Frustration over being beaten by players he had pleaded with Culverhouse to sign contributed to the resignation of McKay. He also fired well-regarded personnel director Ken Herock, when Herock demanded to be paid in line with his value around the league.|$|E

5|$|When Ptolemy {{wrote his}} Geography around 150 AD, the Arun {{was called the}} Trisantonis, with later {{accounts}} using the same name. Trisantonis {{is thought to be}} a Brythonic word for 'the trespasser', indicating the river's tendency to flood land near to the river. Trisanto translates directly as 'one who goes across'. There is also a theory that the Arun may have been known as the Trisantonis in its lower reaches close to the sea, but known as the Arnus (from the Brythonic 'Arno' meaning run, <b>go,</b> <b>or</b> flow) in its upper reaches. It is possible that the town of Arundel may mean Arno-dell, or dell of the flowing river. By the Middle Ages the river was known as the river of Arundel, the Arundel river, or the high stream of Arundel. An alternative name, the Tarrant (derived from Trisantona), is, however, attested in 725 and 1270, and is reflected in the road name Tarrant Street, one of the main roads running through the town roughly parallel to the river. The first use of the modern name was recorded in 1577, but the alternative names of Arundel river or great river continued to be used for many years.|$|E

25|$|Along {{with the}} {{recording}} contracts Blackwell was handing out, {{he also wanted}} to make a go-go film and soundtrack; a D.C.-based version of The Harder They Come, perhaps. The resultant film, Good to <b>Go</b> (<b>or</b> Short Fuse, as it was called on video) was plagued with problems: co-director Don Letts was let go halfway through production, the film became less about the music and more about drugs and violence, {{and despite the fact that}} most of the post-production was completed in the fall of 1985, the film was held for release until late-summer 1986. When it did poorly on release, it seemed that go-go had missed its best chance to break into the mainstream.|$|E

25|$|The Oyster card is a {{contactless}} {{smart card}} system introduced for the public in 2003, {{which can be used}} to pay individual fares (pay as you <b>go)</b> <b>or</b> to carry various Travelcards and other passes. It is used by holding the card close to the yellow card reader. Card readers are found on ticket gates where otherwise a paper ticket could be fed through, allowing the gate to open and the passenger to walk through, and on stand-alone Oyster validators, which do not operate a barrier. Since 2010, Oyster Pay as you go has been available on all National Rail services within London. Oyster Pay as you go has a set of daily maximum charges that are the same as buying the nearest equivalent Day Travelcard.|$|E
25|$|Gary Hamel and C. K. Prahalad {{described}} {{the idea of}} core competency in 1990, the idea that each organization has some capability in which it excels and that the business should focus on opportunities in that area, letting others <b>go</b> <b>or</b> outsourcing them. Further, core competency is difficult to duplicate, as it involves the skills and coordination of people {{across a variety of}} functional areas or processes used to deliver value to customers. By outsourcing, companies expanded the concept of the value chain, with some elements within the entity and others without. Core competency is part of a branch of strategy called the resource-based view of the firm, which postulates that if activities are strategic as indicated by the value chain, then the organization's capabilities and ability to learn or adapt are also strategic.|$|E
25|$|Microblogging: Microblogging is the {{practice}} of posting small pieces of digital content—which could be text, pictures, links, short videos, or other media—on the Internet. Microblogging offers a portable communication mode that feels organic and spontaneous to many users. It has captured the public imagination, {{in part because the}} short posts are easy to read on the <b>go</b> <b>or</b> when waiting. Friends use it to keep in touch, business associates use it to coordinate meetings or share useful resources, and celebrities and politicians (or their publicists) microblog about concert dates, lectures, book releases, or tour schedules. A wide and growing range of add-on tools enables sophisticated updates and interaction with other applications. The resulting profusion of functionality is helping to define new possibilities for this type of communication. Examples of these include Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr and, by far the largest, WeiBo.|$|E

25|$|Wilson {{wrote in}} that there was “no <b>go</b> <b>or</b> spirit about R.B. … {{constant}} chopping & changing” (3 January 1900). Buller, who was still in command in Natal despite having been replaced by Roberts as Commander-in-Chief, was awaiting the arrival of Sir Charles Warren’s 5th Division. Artillery fire at the siege of Ladysmith could still be heard from Buller’s positions, but he rejected a proposal by Wilson that the Light Brigade cross the Tugela River at Potgieter’s Drift, 15 miles upstream. Wilson was critical both of the delay since 16 December and of Buller’s failure to share information with Lyttelton and other senior officers. In the event Buller allowed Lyttleton to cross at that spot on 16 January, with {{the bulk of his}} reinforced forces crossing unopposed at Trikhardt’s Drift 5 miles upstream the following day. Wilson took credit for the Light Brigade’s diversionary artillery fire during the Trikhardt’s Drift crossing.|$|E
