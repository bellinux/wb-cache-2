40|$|The oxides and {{nitrides}} {{of boron}} show {{great potential for}} use as <b>hard,</b> <b>wear</b> resistant <b>materials.</b> However, large intrinsic stresses and poor adhesion often accompany the hard coatings as found for the cubic boron-nitride phase. These effects may be moderated for use of a layered structure. Alternate stiff layers of boron and compliant layers of nitride are formed by modulating the sputter gas composition during deposition of boron target. The B/BN thin films are characterized with transmission electronic microscope to evaluate the microstructure, nanoindentation to measure hardness and ex-ray absorption spectroscopy to determine chemical bonding. The effects of layer pair spacing on chemical bonding and hardness are evaluated for the B/BN films...|$|R
40|$|Laser-assisted {{machining}} {{has been}} considered as an alternative for difficult-to-machine materials such as metallic alloys and ceramics. Machining of some materials such as high chromium alloys and high strength steels is still a delicate and challenging task. Conventional machines or computer numerical control (CNC) machines and cutting tools cannot adapt easily to such materials and induce very high costs for operations of rough machining or finishing. If laser-assisted machining can be implemented successfully for such materials, it will offer several advantages over the traditional methods including longer tool life, shorter machining time and reduced overall costs. This thesis {{presents the results of}} the research conducted on laser assisted machining of <b>hard</b> to <b>wear</b> <b>materials</b> used in making heavy duty mineral processing equipment for the mining industry. Experimental set up using a high power Nd:YAG laser beam attached to a lathe has been developed to machine these materials using cubic boron nitride (CBN) based cutting tools. The laser beam was positioned so that it was heating a point {{on the surface of the}} workpiece directly before it passed under the cutting tool. Cutting forces were measured during laser assisted machining and were compared to those measured during conventional machining. Results from the experiments show that with the right cutting parameters and laser beam position, laser assisted machining results in a reduction in cutting forces compared to conventional machining. A mathematical thermal model was used to predict temperatures within the workpiece at depths under the laser beam spot. The model was used to determine the effect of various cutting and laser parameters on the temperature profile within the workpiece. This study shows that laser assisted machining of <b>hard</b> to <b>wear</b> <b>materials</b> such as high chromium white cast iron shows potential as a possible economical alternative to conventional machining methods. Further research is needed before it can be introduced in industry as an alternative to conventional machining...|$|R
40|$|Titanium nitride (TiN) {{has long}} {{been used as a}} <b>hard,</b> <b>wear</b> {{resistant}} coating <b>material,</b> but it has never been regarded as a low friction material. Recent results though, suggest that TiN coatings deposited by pulsed magnetron sputtering (PMS) can have significantly enhanced tribological properties, in particular, significantly lower coefficients of friction, in comparison with films deposited by continuous DC processing. This paper, therefore, reports the results to date from a detailed study of the tribological properties of TiN coatings produced by PMS. Coatings were deposited under varying conditions of pulse frequency and substrate bias (DC and pulsed). The structural properties of the coatings were investigated by SEM and XRD, whilst the physical and tribological properties were determined using scratch adhesion testing, thrust washer wear testing, hardness testing and surface profilometry.

5000|$|During the 1970s and 1980s, before {{specially}} adapted {{riot helmets}} were produced, officers {{were expected to}} conduct public order and crowd control in the standard beat duty helmet. The cork construction provided little protection against attack and hand-thrown missiles. In order to provide more protection, {{the construction of the}} helmets changed. Visually they remained the same, however instead of being constructed of cork they were now made out of a very <b>hard</b> <b>wearing</b> plastic <b>material</b> and covered in felt. Internally, they were padded with foam which was factory fitted into the shell of the helmet with a webbing-style harness to allow it to sit on the head in the correct manner. Also, two chin straps were added at this time, one for normal duties which was a thin leather strap and a [...] "public order strap" [...] which was made of thick material and included a chin-cup to securely hold the helmet on the head. As well as these changes, helmet plates were altered so that the fixings on them were no longer lugs, but were prong-type pins which were inserted into the helmet and spread apart, so that if the helmet plate was hit by a missile, the lugs would not cause injury to the wearer.|$|R
