5|$|After initial {{reports that}} {{warfarin}} could reduce bone mineral density, {{several studies have}} demonstrated a link between warfarin use and osteoporosis-related fracture. A 1999 study in 572 women taking warfarin for <b>deep</b> <b>venous</b> <b>thrombosis,</b> risk of vertebral fracture and rib fracture was increased; other fracture types did not occur more commonly. A 2002 study looking at a randomly selected selection of 1523 patients with osteoporotic fracture found no increased exposure to anticoagulants compared to controls, and neither did stratification of the duration of anticoagulation reveal a trend towards fracture.|$|E
5|$|Deep vein thrombosis, or <b>deep</b> <b>venous</b> <b>thrombosis</b> (DVT), is the {{formation}} of a blood clot (thrombus) within a deep vein, most commonly the legs. Nonspecific signs may include pain, swelling, redness, warmness, and engorged superficial veins. Pulmonary embolism, a potentially life-threatening complication, is caused by the detachment (embolization) of a clot that travels to the lungs. Together, DVT and pulmonary embolism constitute a single disease process known as venous thromboembolism. Post-thrombotic syndrome, another complication, significantly contributes to the health-care cost of DVT.|$|E
5|$|Warfarin is {{best suited}} for anticoagulation (clot {{formation}} inhibition) in areas of slowly running blood (such as in veins and the pooled blood behind artificial and natural valves) and in blood pooled in dysfunctional cardiac atria. Thus, common clinical indications for warfarin use are atrial fibrillation, the presence of artificial heart valves, <b>deep</b> <b>venous</b> <b>thrombosis,</b> and pulmonary embolism (where the embolized clots first form in veins). Warfarin is also used in antiphospholipid syndrome. It has been used occasionally after heart attacks (myocardial infarctions), but is far less effective at preventing new thromboses in coronary arteries. Prevention of clotting in arteries is usually undertaken with antiplatelet drugs, which act by a different mechanism from warfarin (which normally {{has no effect on}} platelet function).|$|E

5|$|Complications are {{distinct}} medical problems that may arise {{as a result}} of the TBI. The results of traumatic brain injury vary widely in type and duration; they include physical, cognitive, emotional, and behavioral complications. TBI can cause prolonged or permanent effects on consciousness, such as coma, brain death, persistent vegetative state (in which patients are unable to achieve a state of alertness to interact with their surroundings), and minimally conscious state (in which patients show minimal signs of being aware of self or environment). Lying still for long periods can cause complications including pressure sores, pneumonia or other infections, progressive multiple organ failure, and <b>deep</b> <b>venous</b> <b>thrombosis,</b> which can cause pulmonary embolism. Infections that can follow skull fractures and penetrating injuries include meningitis and abscesses. Complications involving the blood vessels include vasospasm, in which vessels constrict and restrict blood flow, the formation of aneurysms, in which the side of a vessel weakens and balloons out, and stroke.|$|E

40|$|Increased {{intracranial}} pressure {{is common in}} cerebral <b>venous</b> <b>thrombosis</b> (CVT), but hydrocephalus is rarely reported in these patients. We examined the frequency, pathophysiology and associated clinical manifestations of hydrocephalus in patients with CVT admitted to our hospital between 2000 and 2010 (prospectively since July 2006). Hydrocephalus {{was defined as a}} bicaudate index larger than the 95 th percentile for age, and/or a radial width of the temporal horn of ≥ 5 mm. We excluded patients in whom hydrocephalus was caused by a disease other than CVT or if it was iatrogenic. 20 out of 99 patients with CVT had hydrocephalus. 6 patients with hydrocephalus were excluded from the analysis. Patients with hydrocephalus more often had focal neurological deficits (86 vs. 49 %, p = 0. 02) and were more frequently comatose (43 vs. 16 %, p = 0. 06), as compared to patients without hydrocephalus. <b>Deep</b> cerebral <b>venous</b> <b>thrombosis</b> (64 vs. 9 %, p < 0. 001) and edema of the basal ganglia and thalami (64 vs. 4 %, p < 0. 001) were more common in patients with hydrocephalus.

25|$|Urokinase is used {{clinically}} as a thrombolytic {{agent in}} the treatment of severe or massive <b>deep</b> <b>venous</b> <b>thrombosis,</b> pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, and occluded intravenous or dialysis cannulas. It is also administered intrapleurally to improve the drainage of complicated pleural effusions and empyemas. Urokinase is marketed as Abbokinase or Kinlytic and competes with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (e.g., alteplase) as a thrombolytic drug in infarction. However, urokinase is not very selective for clot-bound plasminogen, unlike tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) which preferentially interacts with clot-bound plasminogen. Because urokinase binds about equally to freely circulating plasminogen and clot-bound plasminogen, it causes significant fibrinogenolysis and clot fibrinolysis making its use less favorable than TPA.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes {{the link}} between a disease and an unusual gene variant is more subtle. The genetic {{architecture}} of common diseases {{is an important factor}} in determining the extent to which patterns of genetic variation influence group differences in health outcomes. According to the common disease/common variant hypothesis, common variants present in the ancestral population before the dispersal of modern humans from Africa play an important role in human diseases. Genetic variants associated with Alzheimer disease, <b>deep</b> <b>venous</b> <b>thrombosis,</b> Crohn disease, and type 2 diabetes appear to adhere to this model. However, the generality of the model has not yet been established and, in some cases, is in doubt. Some diseases, such as many common cancers, appear not to be well described by the common disease/common variant model.|$|E
25|$|While PSA testing {{may help}} 1000 in 1,000,000 avoid death due to {{prostate}} cancer, 4000 to 5000 in 1,000,000 would die from prostate cancer after 10 years even with screening. This means that PSA screening may reduce mortality from prostate cancer {{by up to}} 25%. Expected harms include anxiety for 100 – 120 receiving false positives, biopsy pain, and other complications from biopsy for false positive tests. Of those found to have prostate cancer, frequent overdiagnosis is common because most cases of prostate cancer {{are not expected to}} cause any symptoms. Therefore, many will experience the side effects of treatment, such as for every 1000 men screened, 29 will experience erectile dysfunction, 18 will suffer urinary incontinence, 2 will have serious cardiovascular events, 1 will suffer pulmonary embolus or <b>deep</b> <b>venous</b> <b>thrombosis,</b> and 1 perioperative death. Since the expected harm relative to risk of death are perceived by patients as minimal, men found to have prostate cancer usually (up to 90% of cases) select to receive treatment.|$|E

In its etiology, the most frequently observed reasons are hypercoagulopathy, oral contraceptive use, pregnancy, puerperium, dehydration, and head trauma. Less frequently observed reasons are vasculitis, inflammatory bowel disease, malignancies, anemia, and tumor invasion through venous sinuses. In this report, were presented two cases who were {{admitted to the hospital}} with headache complaint and cognitive changes.

We excluded patients with known diabetes mellitus and patients without known admission blood glucose. We defined admission hyperglycemia as blood glucose >= 7. 8 mmol/L (141 mg/dL) and severe hyperglycemia as blood glucose >= 11. 1 mmol/L (200 mg/dL). We used logistic regression analysis to determine if admission hyperglycemia was associated with modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 3 to 6 or mortality at last follow-up. We adjusted for: age, sex, coma, malignancy, infection, intracerebral hemorrhage, <b>deep</b> cerebral <b>venous</b> <b>thrombosis,</b> and location of recruitment. Results-Of 380 patients with cerebral <b>venous</b> <b>thrombosis,</b> 308 were eligible. Of these, 66 (21. 4 %) had admission hyperglycemia with 8 (2. 6 %) having severe admission hyperglycemia. Coma (31. 3 % versus 5. 0 %, P < 0. 001) and intracerebral hemorrhage (53. 0 % versus 32. 6 %, P= 0. 002) at presentation were more common among patients with admission hyperglycemia than normoglycemic patients.
