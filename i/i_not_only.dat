5|$|The executions and attainders of Essex and Blount {{led to a}} {{legal dispute}} over the Countess of Leicester's {{remaining}} property. In this context she claimed that Blount, {{in the process of}} paying off Leicester's debts, had squandered her jewels and much of her landed wealth. The death of ElizabethI in 1603 meant some form of rehabilitation for the Countess; the new monarch, James <b>I,</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> restored her grandson, the third Earl of Essex, to his father's title and estate, but quickly cancelled the rest of her debts to the Crown, almost £4,000.|$|E
5|$|The {{introduction}} of feudalism {{from the time}} of David <b>I,</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> introduced sheriffdoms that overlay the pattern of local thanes, but also meant that new tenures were held from the king, or a superior lord, in exchange for loyalty and forms of service that were usually military. However, the imposition of feudalism continued to sit beside existing system of landholding and tenure and {{it is not clear how}} this change impacted on the lives of the ordinary free and unfree workers. In places, feudalism may have tied workers more closely to the land, but the predominantly pastoral nature of Scottish agriculture may have made the imposition of a manorial system on the English model impracticable. Obligations appear to have been limited to occasional labour service, seasonal renders of food, hospitality and money rents.|$|E
25|$|In the {{subsequent}} year, the social psychologist Gerhard Vinnai (University of Bremen), came to similar conclusions. When writing his work Hitler – Scheitern und Vernichtungswut (2004; “Hitler – Failing and rage of destruction”), Vinnai had a psychoanalytic point of depart; he first subjected Hitler’s book Mein Kampf a depth psychological interpretation {{and tried to}} reconstruct how Hitler had processed his experiences in World War I {{against the background of}} his childhood and youth. But similar to Dorpat, Vinnai explains the destructive potential in Hitler's psyche {{not so much as a}} result of early childhood experiences, but rather due to trauma that Hitler had suffered as a soldier in World War <b>I.</b> <b>Not</b> <b>only</b> Hitler, but a substantial part of the German population was affected by such war trauma. Vinnai then leaves the psychoanalytical discourse and comments on social psychological questions, such as how Hitler’s political world view could have emerged from his trauma and how this could appeal to large numbers of people.|$|E

500|$|Morgan {{was born}} in the {{north-western}} New South Wales city of Tamworth, before growing up in Punchbowl, a suburb in South-western Sydney. Morgan was the oldest of four children, with two sisters and a brother. Her father Barrington, a plumber, had success as a swimmer in his childhood, but a lack of facilities in rural Australia curtailed his career. As a result, he vowed that his daughter would become a national champion. Morgan said her father [...] "became my driving and inspirational force. <b>I</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> fulfilled his ambition, but surpassed it by becoming an Olympic champion!" [...] Morgan also cited her meetings with Frederick Lane—Australia's first Olympic gold medallist in swimming—and the Olympic athletics champion Marjorie Jackson-Nelson as key inspirational moments in her career.|$|E

It's difficult {{to get him out}} of your head once you sample what he has to offer". Robert Christgau from The Village Voice commented [...] "His sex raps are erotic, his jokes are funny, and his music makes the thug life sound scary rather than luxuriously laid back. When he considers suicide, <b>I</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> take him at his word, I actively hope he finds another way". The New York Times wrote [...] "Though drug dealing carries tremendous heroic value with some young urban dwellers, he sacrifices the figure's romantic potential. His raps acknowledge both the excitement of drug dealing and the stress caused by the threat from other dealers, robbers, the police and parents, sometimes one's own. In presenting the downside of that life, Ready to Die offers perhaps the most balanced and honest portrait of the dealer's life of any in hip-hop".|$|E

Hershock, in {{discussing}} these terms in the context of performative utterances, points out the difference between telling someone that one is laughing out loud and actually laughing out loud: [...] "The latter response is a straightforward action. The former is a self-reflexive representation of an action: <b>I</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> do something but also show you that I am doing it.

2500|$|Powell {{described}} {{joining the}} Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) during college {{as one of}} the happiest experiences of his life; discovering something he loved and could do well, he felt he had [...] "found himself." [...] According to Powell: It was only once I was in college, about six months into college when I found something that I liked, and that was ROTC, Reserve Officer Training Corps in the military. And <b>I</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> liked it, but I was pretty good at it. That's what you really have to look for in life, something that you like, and something that you think you're pretty good at. And if you can put those two things together, then you're on the right track, and just drive on. Cadet Powell joined the Pershing Rifles, the ROTC fraternal organization and drill team begun by General John Pershing. Even after he had become a general, Powell kept on his desk a pen set he had won for a drill team competition.|$|E
2500|$|The philosopher, if {{he loves}} true wisdom {{and not the}} passions and appetites of the body, accepts that he can come closest to true {{knowledge}} and wisdom in death, as {{he is no longer}} confused by the body and the senses. In life, the rational and intelligent functions of the soul are restricted by bodily senses of pleasure, pain, sight, and sound. [...] Death, however, is a rite of purification from the [...] "infection" [...] of the body. As the philosopher practices death his entire life, he should greet it amicably and not be discouraged upon its arrival, for, since the universe the Gods created for us in life is essentially [...] "good," [...] why would death be anything but a continuation of this goodness? Death is a place where better and wiser Gods rule and where the most noble souls exist: [...] "And therefore, so far as that is concerned, <b>I</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> do not grieve, but I have great hopes that there is something in store for the dead..., something better for the good than for the wicked." ...|$|E

2500|$|Events {{elsewhere}} {{were now}} to have major consequences {{for the war in}} Italy. With Villeroi's crushing defeat by Marlborough at the Battle of Ramillies on 23 May, Louis XIV recalled Vendôme north to take command of French forces in Flanders. It was a transfer that Saint-Simon considered something of a deliverance for the French commander who was [...] "now beginning to feel the unlikelihood of success [...] … for Prince Eugene, with the reinforcements that had joined him after the Battle of Calcinato, had entirely changed the outlook in that theatre of the war." [...] The Duke of Orléans, under the direction of Marsin, replaced Vendôme, but indecision and disorder in the French camp led to their undoing. After uniting his forces with Victor Amadeus at Villastellone in early September, Eugene attacked, overwhelmed, and decisively defeated the French forces besieging Turin on 7 September. Eugene's success broke the French hold on northern Italy, and the whole Po valley fell under Allied control. Eugene had gained a victory as signal as his colleague had at Ramillies—"It is impossible for me to express the joy it has given me;" [...] wrote Marlborough, [...] "for <b>I</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> esteem but I really love the prince. This glorious action must bring France so low, that if our friends could but be persuaded to carry on the war with vigour one year longer, we cannot fail, with the blessing of God, to have such a peace as will give us quiet for all our days." ...|$|E
