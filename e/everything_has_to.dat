She also worked on clenching her facial muscles {{and maintaining a}} clipped walking pace. [...] "That was just Tracy, it so escapes me how it came out!" [...] she said. [...] "I just imagined how uptight people carry themselves, and they grind their teeth at night and they clench their jaw because <b>everything</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> be just perfect." [...] Praising her performance, her co-star Matthew Broderick said, [...] "From the first she knew exactly what she wanted—a very aggressive person in a small and cute package... she comes out very funny and very scary at the same time." ...|$|E
500|$|Michael Jackson wrote [...] "Billie Jean" [...] {{with his}} female fans in mind, and later stated {{that when he}} wrote the song, {{he knew it would}} be a success: [...] "A {{musician}} knows hit material. <b>Everything</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> feel in place. It fulfills you and it makes you feel good. That's how I felt about 'Billie Jean'. I {{knew it was going to}} be big when I was writing it." [...] The singer explained that he was so absorbed by the song that, in one instance, he did not notice that his car had caught fire as he drove down a freeway with a friend until a passing motorcyclist informed him. Jackson noted: [...] "The kid probably saved our lives." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{asked by}} The Quietus if the {{songs from the}} album drew from his {{personal}} experiences, Frank commented [...] "My kitchen is usually pretty clean, you know. But you have fun with the imagery, and for me the whole concept that <b>everything</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> be... Like, nobody gets upset with a director when a director's film isn't about his life. People think that with a recording artist that shit has {{to be like a}} fucking play by play of their whole life, but it's not. It's imagery, {{and a little bit of}} satire." [...] When asked if he made R music, Ocean replied that he disliked how that in the United States, [...] "if you're a singer and you're black, you're an R artist. Period." [...] Ocean stated that the songs on the mixtape do contain R influences, but that it is not an R album entirely.|$|E

500|$|... "Swim Good" [...] {{was written}} by Frank Ocean, Waynne Nugent and Kevin Risto of the duo Midi Mafia, who also {{produced}} the track. The song appears on his debut mixtape Nostalgia, Ultra, which was released on February 18, 2011. When asked by The Quietus about his own interpretation of the character in the song {{it was noted that}} Ocean [...] "politely withdrew, saying he'd enjoy that discussion but he doesn't want to spoil his audience's experience of his songs". He further commented [...] "but you have fun with the imagery, and for me the whole concept that <b>everything</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> be... Like, nobody gets upset with a director when a director's film isn't about his life. People think that with a recording artist that shit has to be like a fucking play by play of their whole life, but it's not. It's imagery, {{and a little bit of}} satire."

500|$|During the Oops!... I Did It Again Tour (2000), Spears {{revealed}} {{she felt}} inspired by hip hop {{artists such as}} Jay-Z and The Neptunes and {{wanted to create a}} record with a funkier sound. In February 2001, Spears signed a $7–8 million promotional deal with Pepsi, and released another book co-written with her mother, entitled A Mother's Gift. On the same month, Spears started to record material for her third studio album, with [...] "Overprotected" [...] being recorded at Maratone Studios in Stockholm, Sweden.

In an interview with the Daily Record, Spears concluded she can relate to [...] "Overprotected" [...] "on a personal basis, because I feel kind of overprotected. When I want to go out, <b>everything</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> be organized in advance. I think that other kids of my age can relate to it to a certain extent." ...|$|E
500|$|Saadiq's songwriting is {{characterized}} by straightforward romanticism, positive exhortations, pining ballads, and message songs. Christgau interpreted Saadiq's persona on the album to be [...] "a romantic who stays true to the deliberate simplicity" [...] of the song titles, but [...] "never threatens to assume the fetal position if he doesn't get the extreme cuddling he craves." [...] Patrick Varine of the Observer-Dispatch asserted that Saadiq deviates significantly from contemporary R lyrics: [...] "there are no thinly-veiled food-sex metaphors or pimp fantasies". His songwriting also paraphrases classic soul lyrics and, on the album's slower songs, expresses tightly coiled emotions. Saadiq said that some songs were written about his life experiences. He described the album as [...] "basically a series of love songs about music, how falling in love can be easy, but staying true to it can be tricky." [...] He elaborated on this interpretation in an interview for the Chicago Tribune: [...] "You {{have to watch out}} for those curves. [...] music comes out, and how do you stay true to what you love? I’m not saying <b>everything</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> sound like a '60s record to stay true, but you should never take the relationship lightly." ...|$|E
5000|$|... van Loon's single was {{originally}} {{supposed to be}} released in August, but because producer JAZ Music was not satisfied with the end result of [...] "Zomer in Nederland", <b>everything</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be redone.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Everything</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> {{happen for}} me <b>to</b> learn ... Dad <b>had</b> <b>to</b> die, Ben <b>had</b> <b>to</b> die, I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> lose my kids.

500|$|... "Novacane" [...] {{was written}} by Frank Ocean and Victor Alexander with co-writing by Tricky Stewart who also {{produced}} the track. The song appears on his debut mixtape Nostalgia, Ultra which was released on February 18, 2011.

He continued, [...] "My kitchen is usually pretty clean, you know.

The track was released as a digital download on May 31, 2011 by Def Jam Recordings.|$|E
2500|$|The Russian {{intelligence}} services are highly bureaucratic and legalistic.

2500|$|Beckham {{suffers from}} obsessive {{compulsive}} disorder (OCD), which he says makes him [...] "have everything {{in a straight line}} or <b>everything</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> be in pairs." [...] Victoria Beckham claims, [...] "If you open our fridge, it's all co-ordinated down either side. We've got three fridges – food in one, salad in another and drinks in the third. In the drinks one, everything is symmetrical. If there's three cans, he'll throw one away because it has to be an even number." ...|$|E
2500|$|Janco recalled, [...] "We {{had lost}} {{confidence}} in our culture. <b>Everything</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be demolished. We would begin again after the tabula rasa.

6000|$|... 'Hoppetty hop! what a ride!' Here I come!' shouted Blockhead-Hans, singing so {{that the}} echoes were roused far and near. But his {{brothers}} were riding slowly in front.

6000|$|... "And {{he was up}} to the mark," [...] {{said one}} of those who were there.

6000|$|... "They {{get their}} bread regularly," [...] Herrara said. [...] "They {{have put up}} some large {{bakeries}} at Abrantes and, as the flour is brought up in boats, there is no difficulty that way. They get their meat pretty regularly, and their wine always.

6000|$|If {{the sights}} and sounds were beautiful, the sun was hot, and the road fearful, and we were indeed glad when we reached [...] "Whitehead's Cobalt Mine," [...] and were most kindly {{received}} by the gentlemen who superintend the works.
