5|$|<b>Imipramine</b> and {{desipramine}} {{have been}} reported increase an average of 31% and 20% respectively by the concomitant administration of alprazolam tablets. Combined oral contraceptive pills reduce the clearance of alprazolam, which may lead to increased plasma levels of alprazolam and accumulation.|$|E
25|$|<b>Imipramine</b> is marketed {{throughout}} the world mainly under the brand name Tofranil. <b>Imipramine</b> pamoate is marketed under the brand name Tofranil-PM for intramuscular injection.|$|E
25|$|Histamine: <b>imipramine</b> is an {{antagonist}} of the histamine H1 receptors.|$|E
25|$|<b>Imipramine</b> affects {{numerous}} neurotransmitter systems {{known to}} be involved in the etiology of depression, anxiety, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), enuresis and numerous other mental and physical conditions. <b>Imipramine</b> is similar in structure to some muscle relaxants, and has a significant analgesic effect and, thus, is very useful in some pain conditions.|$|E
25|$|<b>Imipramine</b> {{was found}} to {{statistically}} increase the discontinuation success rate.|$|E
25|$|Epinephrine: <b>imipramine</b> antagonizes {{adrenergic}} receptors, thus sometimes causing orthostatic hypotension.|$|E
25|$|In overdose, {{iprindole}} is {{much less}} toxic than most other TCAs and is considered relatively benign. For instance, between 1974 and 1985, only two deaths associated with iprindole were recorded in the United Kingdom, whereas 278 were reported for <b>imipramine,</b> although {{it should be noted}} that <b>imipramine</b> is used far more often than iprindole.|$|E
25|$|Within the body, <b>imipramine</b> is {{converted}} into desipramine (desmethylimipramine) as a metabolite.|$|E
25|$|Norepinephrine: strong reuptake inhibition. Desipramine {{has more}} {{affinity}} to norepinephrine transporter than <b>imipramine.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Imipramine</b> {{is used in}} the {{treatment}} of depression, such as depression associated with agitation or anxiety. It is similar in efficacy to the antidepressant drug moclobemide. It has also been used to treat nocturnal enuresis because of its ability to shorten the time of delta wave stage sleep, where wetting occurs. In veterinary medicine, <b>imipramine</b> is used with xylazine to induce pharmacologic ejaculation in stallions.|$|E
25|$|Cimetidine {{has been}} shown {{clinically}} to reduce the clearance of mirtazapine, <b>imipramine,</b> timolol, nebivolol, sparteine, loratadine, nortriptyline, gabapentin, and desipramine in humans.|$|E
25|$|After a {{screening}} phase from April 1994, 275 {{male and female}} patients were randomly assigned paroxetine, <b>imipramine</b> or placebo (an inert pill). Of the 275, 93 were given paroxetine, 95 <b>imipramine</b> and 89 placebo. The paroxetine group were given 20mg daily for four weeks, rising to 30mg at week five and 40mg at week six if the clinician thought it appropriate. The last study visit was in May 1997, and the blind was broken in October.|$|E
25|$|Merck {{introduced}} the second {{member of the}} TCA family, amitriptyline (Elavil), in 1961. This compound has a different three-ring structure than <b>imipramine.</b>|$|E
25|$|Clomipramine is a {{tricyclic}} compound, specifically a dibenzazepine, and possesses three rings fused {{together with}} a side chain attached in its chemical structure. Other dibenzazepine TCAs include <b>imipramine,</b> desipramine, and trimipramine. Clomipramine is a derivative of <b>imipramine</b> with a chlorine atom added to one of its rings and {{is also known as}} 3-chloroimipramine. It is a tertiary amine TCA, with its side chain-demethylated metabolite desmethylclomipramine being a secondary amine. Other tertiary amine TCAs include amitriptyline, <b>imipramine,</b> dosulepin (dothiepin), doxepin, and trimipramine. The chemical name of clomipramine is 3-(3-chloro-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzoazepin-5-yl)-N,N-dimethylpropan-1-amine and its free base form has a chemical formula of C19H23ClN2 with a molecular weight of 314.857g/mol. The drug is used commercially almost exclusively as the hydrochloride salt; the free base has been used rarely. The CAS Registry Number of the free base is 303-49-1 and of the hydrochloride is 17321-77-6.|$|E
25|$|The JAACAP {{article on}} study 329 was never retracted. The journal's editors say the {{negative}} findings {{are included in}} a table, and that therefore there are no grounds to withdraw the article. In September 2015 the BMJ published a re-analysis of the study. This concluded that neither paroxetine nor <b>imipramine</b> had differed in efficacy from placebo in treating depression, that the paroxetine group had experienced more suicidal ideation and behaviour, and that the <b>imipramine</b> group had experienced more cardiovascular problems.|$|E
25|$|<b>Imipramine</b> is a {{tricyclic}} compound, specifically a dibenzazepine, and possesses three rings fused {{together with}} a side chain attached in its chemical structure. Other dibenzazepine TCAs include desipramine (N-desmethylimipramine), clomipramine (3-chloroimipramine), trimipramine (2'-methylimipramine or β-methylimipramine), and lofepramine (N-(4-chlorobenzoylmethyl)desipramine). <b>Imipramine</b> is a tertiary amine TCA, with its side chain-demethylated metabolite desipramine being a secondary amine. Other tertiary amine TCAs include amitriptyline, clomipramine, dosulepin (dothiepin), doxepin, and trimipramine. The chemical name of <b>imipramine</b> is 3-(10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzoazepin-5-yl)-N,N-dimethylpropan-1-amine and its free base form has a chemical formula of C19H2N2 with a molecular weight of 280.407g/mol. The drug is used commercially mostly as the hydrochloride salt; the embonate (pamoate) salt is used for intramuscular administration and the free base form is not used. The CAS Registry Number of the free base is 50-49-7, of the hydrochloride is 113-52-0, and of the embonate is 10075-24-8.|$|E
25|$|Cimetidine, omeprazole, oxcarbazepine, ticlopidine, topiramate, ketoconazole, itraconazole, disulfiram, fluvoxamine, isoniazid, erythromycin, probenecid, propranolol, <b>imipramine,</b> ciprofloxacin, fluoxetine, and {{valproic acid}} prolong {{the action of}} {{diazepam}} by inhibiting its elimination.|$|E
25|$|<b>Imipramine,</b> {{sold under}} {{the brand name}} Tofranil among others, is a {{tricyclic}} antidepressant (TCA). It is mainly used {{in the treatment of}} major depression and enuresis (inability to control urination).|$|E
25|$|<b>Imipramine</b> was {{discovered}} in 1951. It was initially developed as an antihistamine and major tranquilizer for use in patients with schizophrenia; its antidepressant effects were discovered serendipitously when moods of patients improved.|$|E
25|$|Clomipramine is {{a strong}} SRI. Its {{affinity}} for the SERT was reported in one study using human tissues to be 0.14nM, which is considerably {{higher than that of}} other TCAs. For example, the TCAs with the next highest affinities for the SERT in the study were <b>imipramine,</b> amitriptyline, and dosulepin (dothiepin), with Ki values of 1.4nM, 4.3nM, and 8.3nM, respectively. In addition, clomipramine has a terminal half-life that is around twice as long as that of amitriptyline and <b>imipramine.</b> In spite of these differences however, clomipramine is used clinically at the same usual dosages as other serotonergic TCAs (100–200mg/day). It achieves typical circulating concentrations that are similar in range to those of other TCAs but with an upper limit that is around twice that of amitriptyline and <b>imipramine.</b> For these reasons, clomipramine is the most potent SRI among the TCAs and is far stronger as an SRI than other TCAs at typical clinical dosages. In addition, clomipramine is similarly potent or even more potent as an SRI than selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).|$|E
25|$|Methylene blue is a {{monoamine oxidase}} {{inhibitor}} (MAOI), and if infused intravenously at doses exceeding 5mg/kg, may precipitate serious serotonin toxicity, serotonin syndrome, if combined with any selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or other serotonin reuptake inhibitor (e.g., duloxetine, sibutramine, venlafaxine, clomipramine, <b>imipramine).</b>|$|E
25|$|However, in {{the late}} 1950s, the first modern {{antipsychotic}} and antidepressant drugs were developed: chlorpromazine (also known as Thorazine), the first widely used antipsychotic, was synthesized in 1950, and iproniazid, {{one of the first}} antidepressants, was first synthesized in 1957. In 1959 <b>imipramine,</b> the first tricyclic antidepressant, was developed.|$|E
25|$|Narcolepsy has {{sometimes}} been treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants, such as clomipramine, <b>imipramine,</b> or protriptyline, {{as well as other}} drugs that suppress REM sleep. Venlafaxine, an antidepressant which blocks the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine, has shown usefulness in managing symptoms of cataplexy, however, it has notable side-effects including sleep disruption.|$|E
25|$|In a pooled {{analysis}} of 7 comparative trials with <b>imipramine,</b> milnacipran and <b>imipramine</b> {{were shown to}} have comparable efficacy while milnacipran was significantly better tolerated. A pooled {{analysis of}} studies comparing milnacipran and SSRIs concluded a superior efficacy for milnacipran with similar tolerability for milnacipran and SSRIs. A more recent meta-analysis of 6 studies involving more than 1,000 patients showed no distinction between milnacipran and SSRIs in efficacy or discontinuation rates, including discontinuation for side effects or lack of efficacy. A meta-analysis {{of a total of}} 16 randomized controlled trials with more than 2200 patients concluded that there were no statistically significant differences in efficacy, acceptability and tolerability when comparing milnacipran with other antidepressant agents. However, compared with TCAs, significantly fewer patients taking milnacipran dropped out due to adverse events. As with other antidepressants, 1 to 3 weeks may elapse before significant antidepressant action becomes clinically evident.|$|E
25|$|Anticholinergic {{side effects}} such as dry mouth and {{constipation}} are either greatly reduced {{in comparison to}} <b>imipramine</b> and most other TCAs or fully lacking with iprindole. However, it still has significant antihistamine effects and therefore can produce sedation, though this is diminished relative to other TCAs similarly. Iprindole also lacks significant alpha-blocking properties, and hence does not pose a risk of orthostatic hypotension.|$|E
25|$|Tricyclic {{antidepressant}}s: Tricyclic antidepressant {{prescription drugs}} with anti-muscarinic properties {{have been proven}} successful in treating bedwetting, but also have {{an increased risk of}} side effects, including death from overdose. These drugs include amitriptyline, <b>imipramine</b> and nortriptyline. Studies find that patients using these drugs are 4.2 times as likely to stay dry as those taking a placebo. The relapse rates after stopping the medicines are close to 50%.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two major}} groups of TCAs in terms of {{chemical}} structure, which most, but not all, TCAs fall into. The groupings {{are based on the}} tricyclic ring system. They are the dibenzazepines (<b>imipramine,</b> desipramine, clomipramine, trimipramine, lofepramine) and the dibenzocycloheptadienes (amitriptyline, nortriptyline, protriptyline, butriptyline). Minor TCA groups based on ring system include the dibenzoxepins (doxepin), the dibenzothiepines (dosulepin), and the dibenzoxazepines (amoxapine). In addition to classification based on the ring system, TCAs can also be usefully grouped {{based on the number of}} substitutions of the side chain amine. These groups include the tertiary amines (<b>imipramine,</b> clomipramine, trimipramine, amitriptyline, butriptyline, doxepin, dosulepin) and the secondary amines (desipramine, nortriptyline, protriptyline). Lofepramine is technically a tertiary amine, but acts largely as a prodrug of desipramine, a secondary amine, and hence is more similar in profile to the secondary amines than to the tertiary amines. Amoxapine does not have the TCA side chain and hence is neither a tertiary nor secondary amine, although it is often grouped with the secondary amines due to sharing more in common with them.|$|E
25|$|Clomipramine was {{discovered}} in 1964 by the Swiss drug manufacturer Ciba-Geigy. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, {{the most effective and}} safe medicines needed in a health system. It is available as a generic medication. The wholesale price in the developing world is between 0.11 and 0.21 per day as of 2014. In the United States a typical dose costs about 1.20 USD per day. It was made from <b>imipramine.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{increase}} in amygdalar CB1 receptor binding following <b>imipramine</b> treatment {{is consistent with}} prior studies which collectively demonstrate that several treatments which are beneficial to depression, such as electroconvulsive shock and tricyclic antidepressant treatment, increase CB1 receptor activity in subcortical limbic structures, such as the hippocampus, amygdala and hypothalamus. And preclinical studies have demonstrated the CB1 receptor {{is required for the}} behavioral effects of noradrenergic based antidepressants but is dispensable for the behavioral effect of serotonergic based antidepressants.|$|E
25|$|BDNF: BDNF is {{implicated in}} {{neurogenesis}} in the hippocampus, and {{studies suggest that}} depressed patients have decreased levels of BDNF and reduced hippocampal neurogenesis. It {{is not clear how}} neurogenesis restores mood, as ablation of hippocampal neurogenesis in murine models do not show anxiety related or depression related behaviours. Chronic <b>imipramine</b> administration results in increased histone acetylation (which is associated with transcriptional activation and decondensed chromatin) at the hippocampal BDNF promotor, and also reduced expression of hippocampal HDAC5.|$|E
25|$|Antidepressant {{discontinuation}} {{symptoms were}} first reported with <b>imipramine,</b> the first tricyclic antidepressant (TCA), {{in the late}} 1950s, and each new class of antidepressants has brought reports of similar conditions, including monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), SSRIs, and SNRIs. As of 2001, at least 21 different antidepressants, covering all the major classes, were known to cause discontinuation syndromes. The problem has been poorly studied, {{and most of the}} literature has been case reports or small clinical studies; incidence is hard to determine and controversial.|$|E
25|$|Only {{one study}} {{appears to have}} {{evaluated}} the pharmacokinetics of iprindole. A single oral dose of 60mg iprindole to healthy volunteers {{has been found to}} achieve mean peak plasma concentrations of 67.1ng/mL (236nmol/L) after 2 to 4hours. The mean terminal half-life of iprindole was 52.5hours, which is notably much longer than that of other TCAs like amitriptyline and <b>imipramine.</b> Following chronic treatment with 90mg/day iprindole for 3weeks, plasma concentrations of the drug ranged between 18 and 77ng/mL (63–271nmol/L). Theoretical steady-state concentrations should be reached by 99% within 15 to 20days of treatment.|$|E
25|$|Like other antidepressants, {{paroxetine}} {{may increase}} the risk of suicidal thinking and behaviour in children and adolescents. The FDA conducted a statistical analysis of paroxetine clinical trials in children and adolescents in 2004 and found an increase in suicidality and ideation as compared to placebo, which was observed in trials for both depression and anxiety disorders. In 2015 a paper published in The BMJ that reanalysed the original case notes argued that in Study 329, assessing paroxetine and <b>imipramine</b> against placebo in adolescents with depression, the incidence of suicidal behavior had been under-reported and the efficacy exaggerated for paroxetine.|$|E
25|$|Sertraline is a {{moderate}} inhibitor of CYP2D6 and CYP2B6 in vitro. Accordingly, in human trials it caused increased {{blood levels of}} CYP2D6 substrates such as metoprolol, dextromethorphan, desipramine, <b>imipramine</b> and nortriptyline, {{as well as the}} CYP3A4/CYP2D6 substrate haloperidol. This effect is dose-dependent. In a placebo-controlled study, the concomitant administration of sertraline and methadone caused a 40% increase in blood levels of the latter, which is primarily metabolized by CYP2B6. Sertraline is often used in combination with stimulant medication for the treatment of co-morbid depression and/or anxiety in ADHD. Amphetamine metabolism inhibits enzyme CYP2D6, but has not been known to interfere with Sertraline metabolism.|$|E
25|$|Sertraline {{used for}} the {{treatment}} of depression in elderly (older than 60) patients was superior to placebo and comparable to another SSRI fluoxetine, and TCAs amitriptyline, nortriptyline (Pamelor) and <b>imipramine.</b> Sertraline had much lower rates of adverse effects than these TCAs, with the exception of nausea, which occurred more frequently with sertraline. In addition, sertraline appeared to be more effective than fluoxetine or nortriptyline in the older-than-70 subgroup. A 2003 trial of sertraline vs. placebo in elderly patients showed a statistically significant (that is, unlikely to occur by chance), but clinically very modest improvement in depression and no improvement in quality of life.|$|E
25|$|Doxepin is {{a mixture}} of (E) and (Z) {{stereoisomers}} with an approximate ratio of 85:15. When doxepin was developed, no effort was made to separate or balance the mixture following its synthesis, resulting in the asymmetric ratio. (Z)-Doxepin is more active as an inhibitor of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake than (E)-doxepin. The selectivity of doxepin for inhibition of norepinephrine reuptake over that of serotonin is likely due to the 85% presence of (E)-doxepin in the mixture. Most other tertiary amine TCAs like amitriptyline and <b>imipramine</b> do not exhibit E-Z isomerism or such mixture asymmetry and are comparatively more balanced inhibitors of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake.|$|E
