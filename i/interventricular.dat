5|$|The cardiac {{skeleton}} is made {{of dense}} connective tissue and this gives structure to the heart. It forms the atrioventricular septum which separates the atria from the ventricles, and the fibrous rings which serve as bases for the four heart valves. The cardiac skeleton also provides an important boundary in the heart's electrical conduction system since collagen cannot conduct electricity. The interatrial septum separates the atria and the <b>interventricular</b> septum separates the ventricles. The <b>interventricular</b> septum is much thicker than the interatrial septum, since the ventricles need to generate greater pressure when they contract.|$|E
5|$|The {{heart has}} four chambers, two upper atria, the {{receiving}} chambers, and two lower ventricles, the discharging chambers. The atria open into the ventricles via the atrioventricular valves, {{present in the}} atrioventricular septum. This distinction is visible also {{on the surface of}} the heart as the coronary sulcus. There is an ear-shaped structure in the upper right atrium called the right atrial appendage, or auricle, and another in the upper left atrium, the left atrial appendage. The right atrium and the right ventricle together are sometimes referred to as the right heart. Similarly, the left atrium and the left ventricle together are sometimes referred to as the left heart. The ventricles are separated from each other by the <b>interventricular</b> septum, visible {{on the surface of the}} heart as the anterior longitudinal sulcus and the posterior <b>interventricular</b> sulcus.|$|E
5|$|There {{is about}} 125-150mL of CSF {{at any one}} time. This CSF circulates within the {{ventricular}} system of the brain. The ventricles {{are a series of}} cavities filled with CSF. The majority of CSF is produced from within the two lateral ventricles. From here, the CSF passes through the <b>interventricular</b> foramina to the third ventricle, then the cerebral aqueduct to the fourth ventricle. From the fourth ventricle, the fluid passes into the subarachnoid space through four openings â€“ the central canal of the spinal cord, the median aperture, and the two lateral apertures. CSF is present within the subarachnoid space, which covers the brain, spinal cord, and stretches below the end of the spinal cord to the sacrum. There is a connection from the subarachnoid space to the bony labyrinth of the inner ear making the cerebrospinal fluid continuous with the perilymph in 93% of people.|$|E
25|$|When forming {{intra-atrial}} septa, atrio-ventricular valves {{will begin}} to grow. An intra-muscular ventricular septum begins to grow from the common ventricle to the atrio-ventricular endocardial cushions. The division begins in the common ventricle where a furrow in the outer surface of the heart will appear the <b>interventricular</b> foramen eventually disappears. This closure is achieved by further growth muscular <b>interventricular</b> septum, a contribution of trunk crest-conal tissue and a membranous component.|$|E
25|$|The {{walls of}} the <b>interventricular</b> {{foramina}} contain choroid plexus, a specialized structure that produces cerebrospinal fluid. The choroid plexus of the third ventricles continues through the foramina into the lateral ventricles.|$|E
25|$|The <b>interventricular</b> {{foramina}} {{connect the}} lateral ventricles {{to the third}} ventricle. This allows cerebrospinal fluid produced in the lateral ventricles to reach the third ventricle {{and then the rest}} of the brain's ventricular system.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} foramina, {{openings}} acting as channels, that connect the ventricles. The <b>interventricular</b> foramina (also called the foramina of Monro) connect the lateral ventricles {{to the third}} ventricle through which the cerebrospinal fluid can flow.|$|E
25|$|Ventricular septal defect* is {{a hole in}} the {{division}} between the heart ventricles (<b>interventricular</b> septum). It is a congenital heart disease in dogs. There usually are no signs in dogs except for a heart murmur. However, a large defect can result in heart failure or in pulmonary hypertension leading to a right-to-left shunt.|$|E
25|$|The {{downstream}} effector of Notch signaling, HEY2, {{was also}} demonstrated {{to be important}} in regulating ventricular development by its expression in the <b>interventricular</b> septum and the endocardial cells of the cardiac cushions. Cardiomyocyte and smooth muscle cell-specific deletion of HEY2 results in impaired cardiac contractility, malformed right ventricle, and ventricular septal defects.|$|E
25|$|The <b>interventricular</b> {{foramina}} {{give rise}} to disease when they are narrowed or blocked. Narrowing of the foramen {{is more common in}} children and linked to inflammation and scarring from congenital infections (particularly TORCH infections); developmental abnormalities, including of the basilar artery and choroid plexus; and abnormal surrounding tissue growth. Growths include colloid cysts, subependymal giant-cell tumours, nodules and harmatomas.|$|E
25|$|The {{coronary}} arteries {{start in the}} right and left aortic sinus and provide blood to the heart muscle in a similar fashion to most other vertebrates. Other domestic birds capable of flight have three or more {{coronary arteries}} that supply blood to the heart muscle. The blood supply by the coronary arteries are fashioned starting as a large branch over the surface of the heart. It then moves along the coronary groove and continues on into the tissue as <b>interventricular</b> branches toward the apex of the heart. The atria, ventricles, and septum are supplied of blood by this modality. The deep branches of the coronary arteries found within the heart tissue are small and supply the <b>interventricular</b> and right atrioventricular valve with blood nutrients for which to carry out their processes. The interatrial artery of the ostrich is small in size and exclusively supplies blood to only part of the left auricle and interatrial septum.|$|E
25|$|Galen {{believed}} that the arterial blood was created by venous blood passing from the left ventricle to the right by passing through 'pores' in the <b>interventricular</b> septum, air passed from the lungs via the pulmonary artery {{to the left side}} of the heart. As the arterial blood was created 'sooty' vapors were created and passed to the lungs also via the pulmonary artery to be exhaled.|$|E
25|$|In the brain, the <b>interventricular</b> {{foramina}} (or foramina of Monro) are {{channels that}} connect the paired lateral ventricles {{with the third}} ventricle at the midline of the brain. As channels, they allow cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) produced in the lateral ventricles to reach the third ventricle {{and then the rest}} of the brain's ventricular system. They also contain choroid plexus, a specialized CSF-producing structure, that is continuous with that of the lateral and third ventricles, and which is also present in the fourth ventricle.|$|E
25|$|The ventricles {{are filled}} with {{cerebrospinal}} fluid (CSF) which bathes and cushions the brain and spinal cord within their bony confines. CSF is produced by modified ependymal cells of the choroid plexus found in all components of the ventricular system except for the cerebral aqueduct and the posterior and anterior horns of the lateral ventricles. CSF flows from the lateral ventricles via the <b>interventricular</b> foramina into the third ventricle, and then the fourth ventricle via the cerebral aqueduct in the brainstem. From the fourth ventricle it can pass into the central canal of the spinal cord or into the subarachnoid cisterns via three small foramina: the central median aperture and the two lateral apertures.|$|E
25|$|A {{pacemaker}} {{is typically}} {{inserted into the}} patient through a simple surgery using either local anesthetic or a general anesthetic. The patient may be given a drug for relaxation before the surgery as well. An antibiotic is typically administered to prevent infection. In most cases the pacemaker is inserted in the left shoulder area where an incision is made below the collar bone creating a small pocket where the pacemaker is actually housed in the patient's body. The lead or leads (the number of leads varies {{depending on the type}} of pacemaker) are fed into the heart through a large vein using a fluoroscope to monitor the progress of lead insertion. The Right Ventricular lead would be positioned away from the apex (tip) of the right ventricle and up on the <b>interventricular</b> septum, below the outflow tract, to prevent deterioration of the strength of the heart. The actual surgery typically lasts 30 to 90 minutes.|$|E
25|$|Much of {{the medical}} {{information}} included in Anathomia is derived from commentaries on Hippocrates, Aristotle, and Galen written by Islamic scholars. Although Mondino makes frequent references to his personal dissection experiences, he nonetheless repeats numerous fallacies reported by these textual authorities. For example, he propagates the incorrect Galenic notion that a rete mirabile ("miraculous network") of blood vessels exists {{at the base of}} the human brain when it is in fact present only in ungulates. Other errors contained in Anathomia are the result of an attempt to reconcile the teachings of Galen and Aristotle. This is exemplified by Mondino's description of the heart: he combines Aristotle's notion of a triventricular heart with Galen's claim that a portion of the blood can flow directly from one side of the heart to the other though a permeable <b>interventricular</b> septum. He also propagates information about the human reproductive system that is not corroborated by anatomical evidence, including the existence of a seven-celled uterus with hornlike appendages.|$|E
500|$|The right atrium is {{connected}} to the right ventricle by the tricuspid valve. The walls of the right ventricle are lined with trabeculae carneae, ridges of cardiac muscle covered by endocardium. In addition to these muscular ridges, a band of cardiac muscle, also covered by endocardium, known as the moderator band reinforces the thin walls of the right ventricle and plays a crucial role in cardiac conduction. It arises from {{the lower part of the}} <b>interventricular</b> septum and crosses the interior space of the right ventricle to connect with the inferior papillary muscle. The right ventricle tapers into the pulmonary trunk, into which it ejects blood when contracting. The pulmonary trunk [...] branches into the left and right pulmonary arteries that carry the blood to each lung. The pulmonary valve lies between the right heart and the pulmonary trunk.|$|E
2500|$|The right {{atrioventricular}} valve is {{fixed to the}} <b>interventricular</b> septum, by a thick muscular stock, which prevents back-flow of blood into the atrium when ventricular systole is occurring. In the fowl this valve is only connected by a short septal attachment.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>interventricular</b> {{foramina}} are {{two holes}} ( [...] , pl. foramina) that connect the lateral ventricles {{on the left}} and the right to the third ventricle. They are located on the underside near the midline of the lateral ventricles, and join the third ventricle where its roof meets its anterior surface. In front of the foramen is the fornix and behind is the thalamus. The foramen is normally crescent-shaped, but rounds and increases in size depending on the size of the lateral ventricles.|$|E
2500|$|Galenism's final defeat {{came from}} a {{combination}} of the negativism of Paracelsus and the constructivism of the Italian Renaissance anatomists, such as Vesalius in the 16th century. In the 1530s, the Flemish anatomist and physician Andreas Vesalius took on a project to translate many of Galen's Greek texts into Latin. Vesalius' most famous work, De humani corporis fabrica, was greatly influenced by Galenic writing and form. Seeking to examine critically Galen's methods and outlook, Vesalius turned to human cadaver dissection as a means of verification. Galen's writings were shown by Vesalius to describe details present in monkeys but not in humans, and he demonstrated Galen's limitations through books and hands-on demonstrations despite fierce opposition from orthodox pro-Galenists such as Jacobus Sylvius. Since Galen states that he is using observations of monkeys (human dissection was prohibited) to give an account of what the body looks like, Vesalius could portray himself as using Galen's approach of description of direct observation to create a record of the exact details of the human body, since he worked in a time when human dissection was allowed. Galen argued that monkey anatomy was close enough to humans for physicians to learn anatomy with monkey dissections and then make observations of similar structures in the wounds of their patients, rather than trying to learn anatomy only from wounds in human patients, as would be done by students trained in the Empiricist model. The examinations of Vesalius also disproved medical theories of Aristotle and Mondino de Liuzzi. One of the best known examples of Vesalius' overturning of Galenism was his demonstration that the <b>interventricular</b> septum of the heart was not permeable, as Galen had taught (Nat Fac III xv). However, this had been revealed two years before by Michael Servetus in his fateful [...] "Christianismi restitutio" [...] (1553) with only three copies of the book surviving, but these remaining hidden for decades; the rest were burned shortly after its publication because of persecution of Servetus by religious authorities.|$|E
5000|$|Coronary: {{anterior}} <b>interventricular</b> artery and posterior <b>interventricular</b> artery of {{the heart}} ...|$|E
50|$|In the {{coronary}} circulation, {{the posterior}} <b>interventricular</b> artery (PIV) or posterior descending artery (PDA) is an artery {{running in the}} posterior <b>interventricular</b> sulcus to {{the apex of the}} heart where it meets with the anterior <b>interventricular</b> artery. It supplies the posterior 1/3 of the <b>interventricular</b> septum. The remaining anterior 2/3 is supplied by the anterior <b>interventricular</b> artery which is a septal branch of the left anterior descending artery, which is a branch of left coronary artery.|$|E
50|$|In some individuals, the foramen {{fails to}} close, {{leading to an}} <b>interventricular</b> septal defect known as a patent <b>interventricular</b> foramen.|$|E
50|$|In human embryology, {{the primary}} <b>interventricular</b> foramen is a {{temporary}} opening between the developing ventricles of the heart. The ventricles arise as a single cavity that is divided by the developing <b>interventricular</b> septum. Before the septum closes completely, the remaining opening between the two ventricles is termed the <b>interventricular</b> foramen.|$|E
50|$|The {{anterior}} <b>interventricular</b> sulcus (or anterior longitudinal sulcus) {{is one of}} two grooves {{that separates}} the ventricles of the heart, the other being the posterior <b>interventricular</b> sulcus.|$|E
50|$|Under {{the most}} common {{configuration}} of coronary arteries, there are three areas of anastomoses. Small branches of the LAD (left anterior descending/anterior <b>interventricular)</b> branch of the left coronary join with branches of the posterior <b>interventricular</b> branch of the right coronary in the <b>interventricular</b> groove. More superiorly, there is an anastomosis between the circumflex artery (a branch of the left coronary artery) and the right coronary artery in the atrioventricular groove. There is also an anastomosis between the septal branches of the two coronary arteries in the <b>interventricular</b> septum. The photograph shows area of heart supplied by {{the right and the}} left coronary arteries.|$|E
50|$|The {{anterior}} <b>interventricular</b> sulcus and posterior <b>interventricular</b> sulcus {{extend from}} the base of the ventricular portion to a notch, the notch of cardiac apex, (or incisura apicis cordis) on the acute margin of the heart just to the right of the apex.|$|E
50|$|The {{floor at}} the midline of the {{primitive}} ventricle produces the <b>interventricular</b> septum, separating the chamber in two. The IV septum grows upward towards the endocardial cushion. As it grows, a foramen appears, the <b>interventricular</b> foramen, which later is closed by the non-muscular IV septum.|$|E
