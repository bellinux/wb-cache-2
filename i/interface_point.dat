40|$|In recent years, Interface Management (IM) {{practices}} have been emerging {{to address the}} challenges of managing complex capital projects. These challenges include the added complexity and scale of these projects, globalization, geographical distribution and various working cultures, and different internal and external risks. Oil sands, off-shore and nuclear are examples of this class of projects. Despite an emerging consensus {{on the effectiveness of}} IM for facilitating complex projects delivery, IM definitions, elements, and the way it has been implemented varies widely across the construction industry. Furthermore, identifying key <b>interface</b> <b>points,</b> integrating IM with the project schedule, and the relationship between IM implementation and project performance are significant questions that owners and contractors wish to have addressed. Therefore, the objectives of this thesis are to develop a workflow driven process for IM, study its current status in the industry, develop an algorithm to identify key <b>interface</b> <b>points</b> and integrate IM with project schedule, and investigate the relationship between IM implementation and project performance. This research is mostly focused on industrial construction, though some data from other sectors is included. In this thesis, the elements and fundamental definitions of Interface Management are proposed. Then, a workflow driven Interface Management System (IMS) is developed, which lays out a strategy to systematically identify and manage stakeholders’ interfaces with the objective of more effective risk management in capital projects. Once the IMS ontology is defined, the current state of IM in the construction industry is studied through data collection on 46 projects by conducting questionnaire based interviews. The interviewed projects are from different sectors of the industry, with various sizes and geographical locations. This study aims at identifying the project characteristics that lead to formal IM implementation in a project, current common IM practices in the industry, and criteria to assess the status and effectiveness of IM. Furthermore, the relationship between IM implementation and project performance in terms of cost and schedule growth is investigated by employing descriptive and statistical analysis tools. One observation was that those projects that implemented IM at a high level experienced lower cost growth and less variation in the cost growth. This thesis also proposes a methodology to identify key <b>interface</b> <b>points</b> by recognizing the interdependency relationships between them and creating the <b>Interface</b> <b>Points</b> Network. By analyzing the network, two types of high impact and risk prone <b>interface</b> <b>points</b> are identified. Once the key <b>interface</b> <b>points</b> are recognized, they are linked to the interface milestones on the project schedule, to integrate the cyclic information of IMS with the conventional, sequential planning, scheduling and control paradigms (e. g. CPM). The proposed algorithms are validated on a representative offshore model project. In summary, the proposed algorithms in this thesis provide a framework to improve project performance through better alignment between stakeholders, enforcement of contract terms, and effective sharing and distribution of risk-related information within formalized interface management framework. The empirical analysis also sets a foundation for construction organizations to assess their IM with regard to the current practices in the industry and a roadmap to improve their IM practices to more mature levels...|$|R

The control algorithm is separated into path planning and reference-path tracking. The path-planning algorithm computes the entry trajectory from the navigated state at the Entry <b>Interface</b> <b>Point</b> until the desired Parachute Deployment Point. The algorithm aims to recover the landing site uncertainty caused by Entry <b>Interface</b> <b>Point</b> dispersions. Atmospheric and aerodynamic dispersions are compensated in real-time following the Embedded Model Control methodology in which parametric uncertainty is estimated and rejected as an external disturbance. A hierarchical control structure is designed for facilitating non-linear dynamic inversion of the altitude/density relation and tuning of noise estimators and control laws. Both path planning and reference-path tracking exploit longitudinal and lateral decomposition of the translational dynamics, as well as state equation linearization around a reference trajectory.

40|$|With {{the advent}} of CubeSats, {{research}} in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) becomes possible for universities and small research groups. Only a handful of launch sites can be used, due to geographical and political restrictions. As a result, common orbits in LEO are becoming crowded due to the additional launches made possible by low-cost access to space. CubeSat design principles require a maximum of a 25 -year orbital lifetime {{in an effort to}} reduce the total number of spacecraft in orbit at any time. Additionally, since debris may survive re-entry, it is ideal to de-orbit spacecraft over unpopulated areas to prevent casualties. The Drag Deorbit Device (D 3) is a self-contained targeted re-entry subsystem intended for CubeSats. By varying the cross-wind area, the atmospheric drag can be varied {{in such a way as}} to produce desired maneuvers. The D 3 is intended to be used to remove spacecraft from orbit to reach a desired target <b>interface</b> <b>point.</b> Additionally, attitude stabilization is performed by the D 3 prior to deployment and can replace a traditional ADACS on many missions. This paper presents the hardware used in the D 3 and operation details. Four stepper-driven, repeatedly retractable booms are used to modify the cross-wind area of the D 3 and attached spacecraft. Five magnetorquers (solenoids) over three axes are used to damp rotational velocity. This system is expected to be used to improve mission flexibility and allow additional launches by reducing the orbital lifetime of spacecraft. The D 3 can be used to effect a re-entry to any target <b>interface</b> <b>point,</b> with the orbital inclination limiting the maximum latitude. In the chance that the main spacecraft fails, a timer will automatically deploy the booms fully, ensuring the spacecraft will at the minimum reenter the atmosphere in the minimum possible time, although not necessarily at the desired target <b>interface</b> <b>point.</b> Although this does not reduce the risk of casualties, the 25 -year lifetime limit is still respected, allowing a reduction of the risk associated with a hardware failure...|$|E

40|$|A quantum {{computer}} based on Majorana qubits would contain {{a large number}} of zero-energy Majorana states. This system can be modelled as a connected network of the Ising-Kitaev chains alternating the "trivial" and "topological" regions, with the zero-energy Majorana fermions localized at their interfaces. The low-energy sector of the theory describing such a network can be formulated in terms of leading-order couplings between the Majorana zero modes. I consider a minimal model exhibiting effective couplings between four Majorana zero modes - the nonuniform Ising-Kitaev chain, containing two "topological" regions separated by a "trivial" region. Solving the model exactly, I show that for generic values of the model parameters the four zero modes are localized at the four <b>interface</b> <b>points</b> of the chain. In the special case where additional inversion symmetry is present, the Majorana zero modes are "delocalized" between two <b>interface</b> <b>points.</b> In both cases, the low-energy sector of the theory can be formulated in terms of the localized Majorana fermions, but the couplings between some of them are independent of their respective separations: the exact solution does not support the "nearest-neighbor" form of the effective low-energy Hamiltonian.

40|$|A simple {{formula is}} {{proposed}} {{to estimate the}} Statistical Energy Analysis (SEA) coupling loss factors (CLFs) for two flexible subsystems connected via discrete interfaces. First, the dynamic interactions between two discretely connected subsystems are described {{as a set of}} intermodal coupling stiffness terms. It is then found that if both subsystems are of high modal density and meanwhile the <b>interface</b> <b>points</b> all act independently, the intermodal dynamic couplings become dominated by only those between different subsystem mode sets. If ensemble- and frequency-averaged, the intermodal coupling stiffness terms can simply reduce to a function of the characteristic dynamic properties of each subsystem and the subsystem mass, as well as the number of <b>interface</b> <b>points.</b> The results can thus be accommodated within the theoretical frame of conventional SEA theory to yield a simple CLF formula. Meanwhile, the approach allows the weak coupling region between the two SEA subsystems to be distinguished simply and explicitly. The consistency and difference of the present technique with and from the traditional wave-based SEA solutions are discussed. Finally, numerical examples are given to illustrate the good performance of the present technique...|$|R

40|$|Abstract For solving {{nonlinear}} parabolic equation on massive parallel computers, {{the construction}} of parallel difference schemes with simple design, high parallelism and unconditional stability and second order global accuracy in space, has long been desired. In the present work, {{a new kind of}} general parallel difference schemes for the nonlinear parabolic system is proposed. The general parallel difference schemes include, among others, two new parallel schemes. In one of them, to obtain the interface values on the interface of sub-domains an explicit scheme of Jacobian type is employed, and then the fully implicit scheme is used in the sub-domains. Here, in the explicit scheme of Jacobian type, the values at the points being adjacent to the <b>interface</b> <b>points</b> are taken as the linear combination of values of previous two time layers at the adjoining points of the inner interface. For {{the construction of}} another new parallel difference scheme, the main procedure is as follows.
