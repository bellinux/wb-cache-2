25|$|To make {{glass from}} {{materials}} with poor glass forming tendencies, novel techniques {{are used to}} increase cooling rate, or reduce crystal nucleation triggers. Examples of these techniques include aerodynamic levitation (cooling the melt whilst it floats on a gas stream), <b>splat</b> <b>quenching</b> (pressing the melt between two metal anvils) and roller quenching (pouring the melt through rollers).|$|R
50|$|A typical {{technique}} for <b>splat</b> <b>quenching</b> involves casting molten metal by pouring it between two massive, cooled copper rollers that are constantly chilled by {{the circulation of}} water.

The cast alloy decomposed into both dendrites and interdendrites. A detailed local compositional analysis carried out by atom probe within the dendrites revealed that the alloying elements in the Ni Al rich plates and Cr Fe rich interplates are not randomly distributed, but segregate and form areas with pronounced compositional fluctuations. Cu rich precipitates of different morphologies plate like, spherical and rhombohedron shaped could {{also be found in}} the dendrites.

50|$|Amorphous solids {{in general}} {{have a unique}} {{magnetic}} property because of their atomic disorder as explained in the structure heading. They are rather soft metals and each has their own specific magnetic property depending on the means of production.

50|$|A more {{efficient}} <b>splat</b> <b>quenching</b> technique is Duwez's and Willen's gun technique.

All alloys possessed mixed 18 R and 2 H structure of martensite. <b>Splat</b> <b>quenching</b> caused a direct {{formation of martensite}} and a considerable decrease of the grain size from about 100 pm in the bulk (in spite of TiB additions) down to about 2 pm. The lnartensite was less prone to stabilization as in bulk water quenched alloys. The DO, domains size was not altered in ribbons due to insufficient cooling in the solid state after casting. Their size was considerably lowered in ribbons cooled directly in water after casting. Martensitic transformation temperatures were shifted to lower temperatures by 20 - 50 "C, but the transformation hysteresis was 10 - 20 "C broader in all alloys investigated. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) in-situ heatinglcooling experiments allowed one to follow the nucleation of lnartensite in <b>splat</b> <b>quenched</b> ribbons due to their fine grain size.

One claim against such a model is that if chemical bonds are important, the nearly free electron models should not be applicable. However, if the model includes the buildup of a charge distribution between all pairs of atoms just like a chemical bond (e.g., silicon, when a band is just filled with electrons) then it should apply to solids.|$|R
