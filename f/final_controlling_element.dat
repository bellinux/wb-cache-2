40|$|In this study, a {{biological}} microactuator was demonstrated by closed-loop motion {{control of the}} front leg of an insect (Mecynorrhina torquata, beetle) via electrical stimulation of the leg muscles. The three antagonistic pairs of muscle groups in the front leg enabled the actuator to have three degrees of freedom: protraction/retraction, levation/depression, and extension/flexion. We observed that the threshold amplitude (voltage) required to elicit leg motions was approximately 1. 0 V; thus, we fixed the stimulation amplitude at 1. 5 V to ensure a muscle response. The leg motions were finely graded by alternation of the stimulation frequencies: higher stimulation frequencies elicited larger leg angular displacement. A closed-loop control system was then developed, where the stimulation frequency was the manipulated variable for leg-muscle stimulation (output from the <b>final</b> <b>control</b> <b>element</b> to the leg muscle) and the angular displacement of the leg motion was the system response. This closed-loop control system, with an optimized proportional gain and update time, regulated the leg to set at predetermined angular positions.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to share the SRS methodology for identifying the reliability requirements and documenting the expected performance of Safety Instrumented Functions (SIFs) used as criticality defenses. Nuclear Criticality SIFs are comprised of sensors, logic solvers, and <b>final</b> <b>control</b> <b>elements,</b> which may be either automatic or manual, to detect a process hazard and respond to prevent a criticality. The Savannah River Site (SRS) has invoked the chemical process industry safety standard (ANSI/ISA 84. 00. 01) for the design of safety significant instrumented systems. The ISA standard provides a graded approach to design based on the amount of risk reduction that is required of an SIF. SRS is embarking on application of this standard to nuclear criticality defenses, thus integrating criticality safety requirements with verifiable design methodology.

Therefore, critical evaluation of control valves must to {{be an integral part of}} any plant betterment program because the ultimate goal of such efforts is to improve the efficiency and reduce costs. Even control valves in the few severe service applications, which affect efficiency more than the rest of the valve population, have traditionally not been included in such efforts. Recent studies indicate that eliminating control valve problems alone can improve the heat rate of power plants in the range of 2 % to 5 %. The elements that are critical in realizing the potential benefits are: analyzing the whole system and quantifying the losses, identifying the root causes of the problems causing these losses and then, finally, eliminating the root causes of those problems. Methods to estimate loss due to control valve non-performance have to be judiciously applied, and sometimes developed, on a case-by-case basis, as shown by examples in this paper. The commonly observed causes of valve problems are discussed, followed by practical strategies for implementing solutions to the valve problems. Besides the potential for heat rate and efficiency improvement, solving severe service valve problems also removes a major obstacle for the plants to operate for longer intervals between outages, reduce scope of outage maintenance and provides opportunity to upgrade systems to modern practices...|$|R

For non-self regulating (or integrating) processes, IMC tuning correlations are published for PI and PID controllers but not for PID with Filter controllers. The important contribution of this work is that it completes the set of IMC tuning correlations with an extension to the PID with Filter controller for non-self regulating processes.

A {{supervisory}} {{expert system}} based on fuzzy logic rules was developed for diagnosis and control of a lab- scale plant comprising anaerobic/anoxic/aerobic modules for combined high rate biological N and C removal.

On the basis of the analysis of these grey-scale-images cutting paths are roughly calculated. An industrial robot leads a robot-suitable oscillating knife along these cutting paths though the loin.
