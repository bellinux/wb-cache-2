5|$|To {{the left}} and right of Christ are shown John the Baptist and the Virgin Mary in supplicant poses, a {{traditional}} grouping; John {{was also one of the}} Duke's patron saints. Around the central scene small figures of the twelve Apostles carrying their identifying attributes emerge from the foliage border of oak leaves and tendrils; the uppermost <b>heads</b> <b>on</b> each side are replacements, probably by Weininger in the 1860s.|$|E
5|$|When {{meeting for}} the first time or after they have separated, {{individuals}} may greet each other by rubbing and sniffing their noses followed by rubbing their cheeks, moving their noses along their bodies and sniffing each other's genitals. They then may rub and press their shoulders against each other and rest their <b>heads</b> <b>on</b> one another. This greeting is usually performed among harem or territorial males or among bachelor males playing.|$|E

5|$|Beeston crag {{is one of}} a {{chain of}} rocky hills {{stretching}} across the Cheshire Plain. Pits dating from the 4thmillennium BC indicate the site of Beeston Castle may have been inhabited or used as a communal gathering place during the Neolithic period. Archaeologists have discovered Neolithic flint arrow <b>heads</b> <b>on</b> the crag, as well as the remains of a Bronze Age community, and of an Iron Age hill fort. The rampart associated with the Bronze Age activity on the crag has been dated to around 1270–830 BC; seven circular buildings were identified as being either late Bronze Age or early Iron Age in origin. It may have been a specialist metalworking site.|$|E
5|$|In 1993, a new {{band called}} Inveigh Catharsis formed in Des Moines, with Gray on bass, Brainard on guitar and Colsefni on drums. Jordison jammed {{occasionally}} with this group. Brainard eventually left to join Jordison and Jones in Modifidious, participating in demo recordings {{at the end}} of '93 and early in '94. During 1994 Modifidious sometimes played the same shows as Crahan's <b>Heads</b> <b>on</b> the Wall band. Gray formed a death metal band called Body Pit, soon becoming popular in the local scene. Modifidious stopped playing in the wake of death metal's increasing pull. Gray failed to get Jordison to join Body Pit, but soon after he recruited local guitar teacher Mick Thomson, the band broke up.|$|E

40|$|Many {{secondary}} vestibular neurons {{are sensitive}} to <b>head</b> <b>on</b> trunk rotation during reflex-induced and voluntary head movements. During passive whole body rotation the interaction of <b>head</b> <b>on</b> trunk signals related to the vestibulo-collic reflex with vestibular signals increases the rotational gain of many secondary vestibular neurons, including many that project to the spinal cord. In some units, the sensitivity to <b>head</b> <b>on</b> trunk and vestibular input is matched and the resulting interaction produces an output that {{is related to the}} trunk velocity in space. In other units the <b>head</b> <b>on</b> trunk inputs are stronger and the resulting interaction produces an output that is larger during the reflex. During voluntary head movements, inputs related to <b>head</b> <b>on</b> trunk movement combine destructively with vestibular signals, and often cancel the sensory reafferent consequences of self-generated movements. Cancellation of sensory vestibular signals was observed in all of the antidromically identified secondary vestibulospinal units, even though many of these units were not significantly affected by reflexive <b>head</b> <b>on</b> trunk movements. The results imply that the inputs to vestibular neurons related to <b>head</b> <b>on</b> trunk rotation during reflexive and voluntary movements arise from different sources. We suggest that the relative strength of reflexive <b>head</b> <b>on</b> trunk input to different vestibular neurons might reflect the different functional roles they have in controlling the posture of the neck and body...|$|R
5|$|On Enterprise, T'Pol teaches some of {{the colonists}} how to evade edged-weapon attacks (from Vulcan martial-art 'Suus-mahna'), while Ensign Hoshi Sato (Linda Park) and Lieutenant Malcolm Reed (Dominic Keating) teach other colonists how to fire their weapons more accurately. Archer and Tucker then suggest the colonists shift the entire colony to the south 50 meters. When the Klingon marauders arrive, the colony appears deserted and silent. Finally the {{defenders}} show themselves, and in the ensuing fight the Klingons are lured into an area surrounded by the capped-off deuterium well <b>heads.</b> <b>On</b> cue, the wells are ignited, surrounding the Klingons with flames. Tessic then tells the Klingons to leave and never come back. After they depart, Archer is rewarded with 2,000 liters of deuterium by the grateful miners.|$|E
5|$|Pelicans swim {{well with}} their strong legs and their webbed feet. They rub {{the backs of}} their <b>heads</b> <b>on</b> their preen glands to pick up an oily secretion, which they {{transfer}} to their plumage to waterproof it. Holding their wings only loosely against their bodies, pelicans float with relatively little of their bodies below the water surface. They dissipate excess heat by gular flutter – rippling the skin of the throat and pouch with the bill open to promote evaporative cooling. They roost and loaf communally on beaches, sandbanks and in shallow water.|$|E
5|$|Representations of the Virgin and John the Evangelist flank Christ {{in small}} {{rectangular}} panels {{at either end}} of his outstretched arms. Both are dark-skinned, and bear agonised and sorrowful expressions as they rest their <b>heads</b> <b>on</b> their hands and face inwards towards Christ. In keeping with the Franciscan idea, the gilding surrounding the mourning saints is kept to a minimum. The size and positions of the figures are reduced compared to usual Byzantine iconography to maintain sole focus on the passion of Christ.|$|E

5|$|Solutions {{of copper}} {{compounds}} {{are used as}} a wood preservative, particularly in treating the original portion of structures during restoration of dry rot damage. Together with zinc, copper wires may be installed over non-conductive roofing materials to discourage the growth of moss. Textile fibers are blended with copper to create antimicrobial protective fabrics. Copper alloys are used in musical instruments, particularly: the body of brass instruments; circuitry for all those that are electronically amplified; the bodies of brass percussion such as gongs, bells, and kettle drums; tuning <b>heads</b> <b>on</b> guitars and other string instruments; string windings on harps, pianos, harpsichords, and string instruments; and the frame elements of pianos and harps. Copper is commonly used as a base on which other metals such as nickel are electroplated.|$|E
5|$|The {{pictorial}} {{space is}} bathed in soft light, probably an influence from Jan van Eyck. The light {{falls from the}} right, throwing shadows of both Mary and the Child's <b>heads</b> <b>on</b> the left wall of the niche. The Virgin and Child are shown seated in a small Gothic chapel or oratory projecting from a wall and opening onto a lawn. The painting pays very close attention to small realistic detail; for example, there are four small holes above each arch, likely to hold scaffolding.|$|E

5|$|In Kushan era {{representations}} {{between the}} first and third centuries CE, she is depicted as two-armed and six-headed like Skanda. A significant number of Kushan and Yaudheya coins, sculptures and inscriptions produced from 500 BCE to 1200 CE picture the six-headed Shashthi, often on the reverse of the coin, with the six-headed Skanda on the observe. Shashthi is also pictured in a Kushan-era Vrishni triad from the Mathura region, surrounded by Skanda and Vishakha. In Yaudheya images, she is shown to have two arms and six heads that are arranged in two tiers of three heads each, while in Kushan images, the central head is surrounded by five female heads, sometimes attached to female torsos. Terracotta Gupta era (320–550 CE) figures from Ahichchhatra show the goddess with three <b>heads</b> <b>on</b> the front and three on the back.|$|E
5|$|Incubation {{has been}} {{recorded}} as averaging around 17 days. Like all passerines, the chicks are altricial; they are born blind and naked, and start to develop down on their <b>heads</b> <b>on</b> day two. Their eyes open around day six, and they begin developing their primary flight feathers around day nine or ten. For {{the first three days}} after hatching, the mother feeds the nestlings alone, with food brought to her by the father. The father feeds them directly from the fourth day onwards, with the mother brooding them afterwards until day seven. Flies, butterflies, moths, caterpillars and beetles predominate in the food fed to the young birds. Flame robins fed a higher proportion of flying insects to their young at Nimmitabel than did scarlet robins, which may have been due to their later start to breeding. Both parents participate in removing faecal sacs from the nest. Parents have been observed feeding young up to five weeks after leaving the nest.|$|E
5|$|Overall, the Columbidae {{tend to have}} short legs, short {{bills with}} a fleshy cere, and small <b>heads</b> <b>on</b> large, compact bodies. In a series of {{experiments}} in 1975 by Dr.Mark B. Friedman, using doves, their characteristic head bobbing was shown {{to be due to}} their natural desire to keep their vision constant. It was shown yet again in a 1978 experiment by Dr.Barrie J. Frost, in which pigeons were placed on treadmills; it was observed that they did not bob their heads, as their surroundings were constant. The wings are large, and have eleven primary feathers, and low wing loading; pigeons have strong wing muscles (wing muscles comprise 31–44% of their body weight) and are among the strongest fliers of all birds. They are also highly manoeuvrable in flight.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} month they were relocated once more, {{this time to}} Queensland where they undertook training exercises and defensive duties along the coast between Brisbane and Tweed <b>Heads</b> <b>on</b> the New South Wales border. At this time, the Army began to rectify the deficiencies in the division's equipment lists and battalions began receiving new machine guns, motor transport and Bren carriers. As the situation in New Guinea grew worse, {{the decision was made}} to reorganise the 3rd Division and throughout August, four battalions were amalgamated—the 37th, 52nd, 58th and 59th. In September, the 10th Brigade was disbanded and its battalions reallocated to the 4th and 15th Brigades. In October the 29th and 46th Battalions were also amalgamated, leaving the division with just six infantry battalions in two brigades.|$|E
5|$|Many of the Plains Aborigines were matrilineal/matrifocal societies. A man {{married into}} a woman's family after a {{courtship}} {{period during which}} the woman was free to reject as many men as she wished. In the age-grade communities, couples entered into marriage in their mid-30s when a man {{would no longer be}} required to perform military service or hunt <b>heads</b> <b>on</b> the battle-field. In the matriarchal system of the Siraya, it was also necessary for couples to abstain from marriage until their mid-30s, when the bride's father would be in his declining years and would not pose a challenge to the new male member of the household. It was not until the arrival of the Dutch Reformed Church in the 17th century that the marriage and child-birth taboos were abolished. There is some indication that many of the younger members of Sirayan society embraced the Dutch marriage customs as a means to circumvent the age-grade system in a push for greater village power. Almost all indigenous peoples in Taiwan have traditionally had a custom of sexual division of labor. Women did the sewing, cooking and farming, while the men hunted and prepared for military activity and securing enemy heads in headhunting raids, which was a common practice in early Taiwan. Women were also often found in the office of priestesses or mediums to the gods.|$|E

Scully visits Sharon, {{now in a}} mental institution, who tells Scully that she stole {{technology}} from her employer that Max believed was alien. The device was in three parts, one which she had, one that he brought {{on the plane and}} a third one. Mulder uses the claim ticket to obtain the third device at a New York airport and <b>heads</b> <b>on</b> a plane to return to Washington. Garrett, who is also aboard, sits next to him. Mulder soon realizes who Garrett is and holds him at gunpoint. Garrett does not care, telling Mulder that if he shoots him the plane will depressurize and {{he will be able to}} escape with a parachute he has with him. Mulder imprisons Garrett in the airplane bathroom but Garrett soon emerges with a zip gun and orders him to hand over the device. Suddenly the plane starts shaking and bright lights shine in through the windows. When the plane touches down and Mulder gets out both Garrett and the device are gone and Mulder is missing nine minutes, having no memory of what happened.
