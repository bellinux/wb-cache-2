500|$|The {{first song}} {{featured}} in the episode is [...] "The Most Beautiful Girl (In the Room)." [...] The song, also known as [...] "Part-Time Model", {{was based on the}} conceit of a man [...] "who's not very good at compliments." [...] The song begins after Jemaine sees Sally <b>from</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> at Dave's party. Jemaine details his seduction of Sally, describing her as being so beautiful she could be a [...] "part-time model". This song was voted number 60 in the 2008 Triple J Hottest 100. [...] Later, the song was nominated for an Emmy award for Outstanding Original Music And Lyrics.|$|E
500|$|As {{the song}} begins, Brown watches a woman, who {{appears as a}} hologram, lying in a bed. This scene is intercut with scenes of Brown singing {{in front of a}} flowing backdrop. He then {{approaches}} the woman, and together they appear under white bedsheets. Brown is then seen walking down a street, while women are shown levitating out of their beds as he passes by them. He then enters a limo and starts caressing various ghostlike female figures. Brown then returns to the bedroom where he [...] "strips shirtless and makes passionate love" [...] to the woman [...] "as they are showered in water". He later enters a dance studio, where he performs a dance routine with other shirtless male dancers, while several women watch them <b>from</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> Towards the end of the video, more scenes are shown of Brown and the woman in the bedroom.|$|E

500|$|Will {{meets his}} friends in a {{restaurant}} with the opened giftthe original La Mariée. They take turns supporting his decision to end the relationship by (halfheartedly) pointing out Anna's flaws. When Spike enters and is told what happened, he promptly calls Will a [...] "daft prick". Will reiterates Anna's last comment and realizes his mistake. They pile into Max's car and race across London to Anna's hotel, where they find that she has checked out and is holding a press conference at the Savoy Hotel. When Will arrives, Anna's publicist is telling the crowd that Anna will be taking time off from making films and leaving the UK that night. Will, {{pretending to be a}} reporter again, admits he made the wrong decision and begs Anna to reconsider. After admitting she would, Anna announces that she will be staying in Britain [...] "indefinitely." [...] Anna and Will smile at one another <b>from</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> as the press goes into a frenzy. A montage shows their wedding and arrival at one of Anna's movie premieres, before ending with them on a bench in the private garden, Will reading to a visibly pregnant Anna.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{examples}} from auditory perception research {{will be helpful}} in explaining {{the fact that our}} perceptual faculties naturally enhance and supplement our conscious experience. First, there is the [...] "cocktail party phenomenon" [...] (Moray, 1959). When someone is engaged in conversation with a group of people in a noisy room, but then they suddenly hear something or hear their name <b>from</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> when they were completely inattentive to the input before, that is the cocktail party phenomenon. This phenomenon also occurs with words associated with danger and sex. Although people may be inattentive to a portion of their environment, when they hear specific [...] "trigger" [...] words, their auditory capacities are redirected to another dimension of perceptual awareness. This shows that we do process information outside of our immediate conscious experience. Similar to visual perception, auditory perception also enhances and supplements our experience by searching out and extracting meaningful information from our environment.|$|E

50|$|The story {{starts as}} a young Enrique (Santiago Gudino) plays hide and seek with his young female friend (Christie Nicole Chaplin). Years pass until they see each other <b>from</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> crowded <b>room</b> and get {{immediately}} reacquainted. They haven’t seen each other in years, since they were 10 or so, and {{they go to the}} club and the bed, in steamy independent scenes of their full-blown adult independent fling.|$|R

6000|$|... "No, Harry," [...] she said, {{jumping from}} her seat and drawing her hand rapidly from him; [...] "no; it shall not be like that. Let it be Lady Ongar again if {{the sound of the}} other name brings back too closely the memory of other days. Let it be Lady Ongar again. I can {{understand}} that it will be better." [...] As she spoke she walked away <b>from</b> him <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> and he followed her.|$|R

50|$|A {{serpentine}} streamer {{is a type}} {{of party}} accessory made out of long strips of paper, wound up in a roll. When thrown up in the air they create beautiful serpentines, and their motion through air is fun and aids in party cheerfulness. Serpentine streamers can also be used as party decorations, usually hung up <b>from</b> <b>the</b> ceiling <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> as they form visually appealing serpentines.|$|R
60|$|He {{was about}} to rise in his horror, when he caught the Prince's eye. It was fixed upon him <b>from</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> with a {{frowning}} and angry stare. And in a moment Geraldine recovered his composure.|$|E

60|$|He {{placed a}} chair at his visitor's disposal, himself {{resuming}} his seat at his writing-table, and unfolding the paper Garnache had given him. The newcomer seated himself, hitched his sword-belt round {{so that he could}} lean both hands upon the hilt, and sat, stiff and immovable, awaiting the Lord Seneschal's pleasure. <b>From</b> his desk <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>the</b> secretary, idly chewing the feathered end of his goose-quill, took silent stock of the man from Paris, and wondered.|$|R
5000|$|The royal {{apartment}} {{featured a}} bedroom, a dressing room, a private audience chamber, and a harem, which, after {{the reign of}} Amenhotep III, was used simply for storage. The palace had a central courtyard, and <b>across</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> pharaoh's <b>rooms</b> were apartments for his daughters and son. His Great Royal Wife, Tiye, had her own smaller palace complex diagonally <b>across</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> pharaoh's. The palace grounds contained gardens and a large pleasure lake.|$|R
2500|$|The {{business}} {{started out}} as Malley & Co., a dry goods store, in 1852. [...] It was originally located directly <b>across</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> New Haven Green, at 65 Chapel Street. [...] Malley rented a 15- by [...] store for $75 a year, using $250 in cash and a credit line of $550 to stock his store. [...] With such limited space, Malley hung goods <b>from</b> wires strung <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> and used barrels topped with planks as counters. The store made deliveries {{by way of a}} mule named Maude who pulled a cart through the streets of New Haven.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, mercy! It's ten o'clock!" [...] Mrs. Schoville {{suddenly}} cried, {{her husband}} having at last {{caught her eye}} <b>from</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> [...] "I'm so sorry I can't hear the rest, Mr. St. Vincent, how you escaped and all that. But you must come and see me. I am just dying to hear!" ...|$|E
6000|$|The office {{which was}} (or should have been) {{the point of}} rest for so many {{evolving}} dollars stood {{in the heart of}} the city--a high and spacious room, with many plate-glass windows. A glazed cabinet of polished red-wood offered to the eye a regiment of some two hundred bottles conspicuously labelled. These were all charged with Pinkerton's Thirteen Star, although <b>from</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> it would have required an expert to distinguish them from the same number of bottles of Courvoisier. I used to twit my friend with this resemblance, and propose a new edition of the pamphlet, with the title thus improved, [...] "Why Drink French Brandy, When We give You the same Labels?" [...] The doors of the cabinet revolved all day upon their hinges; and if there entered any one who was a stranger to the merits of the brand, he departed laden with a bottle. When I used to protest at this extravagance, [...] "My dear Loudon," [...] Pinkerton would cry, [...] "you don't seem to catch on to business principles! The prime cost of the spirit is literally nothing. I couldn't find a cheaper advertisement if I tried." [...] Against the side-post of the cabinet there leaned a gaudy umbrella, preserved there as a relic. It appears that when Pinkerton was about to place Thirteen Star upon the market, the rainy season was at hand. He lay dark, almost in penury, awaiting the first shower, at which, as upon a signal, the main thoroughfares became dotted with his agents, vendors of advertisements; and the whole world of San Francisco, from the business-man fleeing for the ferry-boat, to the lady waiting at the corner for her car, sheltered itself under umbrellas with this strange device: Are you wet? Try Thirteen Star. [...] "It was a mammoth boom," [...] said Pinkerton, with a sigh of delighted recollection. [...] "There wasn't another umbrella to be seen. I stood at this window, Loudon, feasting my eyes; and I declare, I felt like Vanderbilt." [...] And it was to this neat application of the local climate that he owed, not only much of the sale of Thirteen Star, but the whole business of his advertising agency.|$|E
50|$|Dawn {{launched}} {{an invitation to}} Griffin to eat lunch together the next day, and she did this <b>from</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> According to the nonverbal expectancy violations model, launching an invitation <b>from</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> would guarantee a poor response, but this time, the invitation was successful.|$|E
60|$|The door jerked open, {{and the man}} flung past Martin, with {{an angry}} countenance and went down the corridor, muttering curses and {{clenching}} his fists. Martin decided not to enter immediately, and lingered in the hallways {{for a quarter of}} an hour. Then he shoved the door open and walked in. It was a new experience, {{the first time he had}} been inside an editorial office. Cards evidently were not necessary in that office, for the boy carried word to an inner room that there was a man who wanted to see Mr. Ford. Returning, the boy beckoned him <b>from</b> halfway <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> and led him to the private office, the editorial sanctum. Martin's first impression was of the disorder and cluttered confusion of <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> Next he noticed a bewhiskered, youthful-looking man, sitting at a roll- top desk, who regarded him curiously. Martin marvelled at the calm repose of his face. It was evident that the squabble with the printer had not affected his equanimity.|$|R
5000|$|The headmaster's {{section of}} the house was built with {{symmetrical}} rooms on both side of the foyer. <b>The</b> office is <b>across</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> library and <b>the</b> parlour is <b>across</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> dining <b>room.</b> On <b>the</b> second floor there are symmetrical bedrooms for each side of the hallway. The servant's {{section of the}} house was near the kitchen and the pantry on the east side. The grand hall and the parlor are what categorized the house as a mansion. [...] Unlike most mansions at the time, the Ford Mansion did not use bricks for the exterior, but painted flush board and clapboards.|$|R
50|$|The SoundDock {{included}} an infrared remote that can control an iPod <b>from</b> <b>across</b> a <b>room.</b> <b>The</b> iPod and SoundDock system {{can also be}} operated without the remote. When an iPod is docked, all of its controls are accessible, with one-button volume controls available on the SoundDock system's enclosure. The SoundDock can also charge (via firewire) {{and in the absence}} of the wall charger will charge up any iPod made before fall 2008. In 2004, the SoundDock featured in Fortune Magazine's 25 Best Products of the Year and 26 Must-Have Gadgets. In 2006, it was the winner of the MacUser Reader's Award for Audio of the Year.|$|R

5000|$|The Assassins {{gather in}} a bar. Guiteau toasts to the Presidency of the United States, {{speaking}} of his ambition to become Ambassador to France. Zangara complains about his stomach pains, and Booth suggests fixing them by shooting Franklin D. Roosevelt. Hinckley accidentally breaks a bottle, and Czolgosz flies into a rage, describing the horrors {{he sees in}} the bottle factory he works in, and how many men die or are injured just to make a bottle like the one Hinckley has just broken. Guiteau jokingly tells Czolgosz to find another job, and the two begin to argue about the American Dream, with Guiteau defending America and Czolgosz dismissing the [...] "land of opportunity" [...] as a lie. Czolgosz becomes enraged and grabs a bottle, barely stopping himself <b>from</b> throwing it <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> Booth urges Czolgosz {{to take control of}} his fate by breaking a bottle himself, but Czolgosz cannot.|$|R
5000|$|... "At about 2:00 am, I {{lay down}} {{completely}} exhausted {{and tried to}} catch {{a few hours of}} sleep. Noise drifted <b>across</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> next door, where Martin Bormann, Hans Krebs, and Wilhelm Burgdorf sat carousing. I must have been asleep for two-and-one-half hours when Bernd (Bernd von Freytag-Loringhoven) in the bunk beneath me woke me up. 'You really are missing something, just listen to that!' he whispered. Burgdorf was shouting at Bormann: 'Believe me, I have done my very best to smooth things over between Hitler and the Army, {{so much so that the}} Army has called me a traitor to the German Officers' Corps. Now I realize that they were right all along, that my work was in vain, my idealism misdirected, no, naive and stupid.' Breathing heavily, he paused for a moment. Krebs tried to calm him down and begged him to spare Bormann's feelings." ...|$|R
25|$|The {{interior}} {{of the house was}} much smaller than the year before. <b>The</b> living <b>room</b> was brought back inside the house, with two glass doors separating it from the main floor area. On Launch Night, McCall said <b>the</b> <b>room</b> will change colour depending on what mood the housemates were in, however the walls only changed colour on eviction nights. <b>The</b> bedroom was <b>across</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> living <b>room,</b> and featured a waterbed, the bathroom was accessed through the bedroom, and featured a bath, shower and also a toilet. The kitchen was small and beside the door leading to the garden. In the garden, which was much larger than the house, was a barbecue, a pool, a seating area and a bridge titled The Bridge to Nowhere which led to another seating area. The interior stairs remained closed off once again, and had a yellow and black theme.|$|R
