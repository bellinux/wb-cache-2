5|$|Some bathhouses have areas {{designed}} to facilitate impersonal sex. These areasrooms or hallwaysare illuminated {{only by a}} (dim) red exit sign. It is possible to have sex, but not to see with whom. Other bathhouses, such as the Continental Baths in New York or the Club Baths in Washington, D.C., have two or more bunkbeds in close proximity, in a public area. This provides a place to have sex for those who could afford only a locker, and facilitated <b>exhibitionism</b> and voyeurism for those so inclined. Baths often have a (porn) TV room or snack bar where patrons can recuperate between orgasms.|$|E
5|$|Blank debuted for the ECW brand as Kelly Kelly. Originally, {{she was to}} {{be named}} just 'Kelly', but her ring name was {{expanded}} to 'Kelly Kelly' by WWE chairman Vince McMahon. She made her debut on the first episode of ECW on June 13, 2006, becoming the youngest Diva on the WWE roster at the age of 19. Her character, an exhibitionist, was introduced performing a striptease for the crowd. The next week, while performing another striptease, Kelly was interrupted by her on-screen boyfriend, Mike Knox, who came to the stage and covered her with a towel before dragging her backstage. Her stripping became a weekly segment known as Kelly's Exposé and usually followed the same routine; Kelly would dance and strip until she was interrupted by Knox, who was upset by her <b>exhibitionism</b> and showing off her body to others. Originally a solo segment, Kelly was joined by the villainous Candice Michelle on the July 11 edition of ECW.|$|E

25|$|During her lifetime, Bow was {{the subject}} of wild rumors {{regarding}} her sex life; most of them were untrue. A tabloid called The Coast Reporter published lurid allegations about her in 1931, accusing her of <b>exhibitionism,</b> incest, lesbianism, bestiality, drug addiction, alcoholism, and having contracted a venereal disease. The publisher of the tabloid then tried to blackmail Bow, offering to cease printing the stories for $25,000, which led to his arrest by federal agents and, later, an eight-year prison sentence.|$|E

500|$|Gagged {{consists}} of five dance-pop, electronic, and avant-garde tracks with [...] "thumping" [...] beats. Music critics viewed the EP as {{a departure from}} the music released by previous RuPaul's Drag Race contestants, describing its sound as more experimental or moodier. The songs are heavily influenced by sexual fetishism and sadomasochism. Through their lyrics, Chachki addresses [...] "gender roles and conformity, power play, <b>exhibitionism,</b> sex and confidence." [...] She found additional inspiration from her time working as an assistant to a dominatrix and a [...] "mistress in a dungeon."

Although Barrymore {{wanted to play}} opposite Costello again, Jack L. Warner, the film's producer, signed Astor. After completing his Warner Bros. contract with When a Man Loves, with Costello, Barrymore joined United Artists (UA) under a three-film deal. For the next three years, according to Morrison, he [...] "enjoyed unprecedented prosperity and spent lavishly". Nevertheless, he received some harsh reviews. Critic and essayist Stark Young wrote in The New Republic that Barrymore's films were [...] "rotten, vulgar, empty, in bad taste, dishonest, noisome with a silly and unwholesome <b>exhibitionism,</b> and odious {{with a kind of}} stale and degenerate studio adolescence. Their appeal is cheap, cynical and specious".|$|E

Gay rights issues were at the forefront of social discussions globally, as was an ever-increasing awareness of AIDS." [...] Barry Walters from Rolling Stone noted that the album's greatest contribution is [...] " [...] embrace of the other, which in this case means queerness, blackness, third-wave feminism, <b>exhibitionism</b> and kink. Madonna took what was marginalized at the worst of the AIDS epidemic, placed it in an emancipated context, and shoved it into the mainstream for all to see and hear." [...] Brian McNair, the author of Striptease Culture: Sex, Media and the Democratization of Desire, stated that upon the album's release [...] "academic books began to appear about the 'Madonna phenomenon', while pro- and anti-porn feminists made of her a symbol of all that was good or bad (depending on their viewpoint) about contemporary sexual culture."

500|$|For the collaboration, Fraser McAlpine from BBC Radio 1 {{reviewed}} the song negatively, writing: [...] "So anyway, this {{brings me to}} 'Video Phone' – and {{what exactly is the}} point of Gaga featuring in this song? I know Beyoncé fans won't like me saying this, but I can't help but think that in this instance it's a case of 'if you can't beat em, join em' [...] For someone as naturally brilliant as Beyoncé (and a better singer than Gaga and Rihanna put together), perhaps she should actually stop trying so hard and do what she does best - singing proper songs." [...] Chris Willman from Yahoo! compared the song to Gaga's [...] "Telephone", where Knowles appears as a featured artist, and wrote that [...] "Maybe it's because the lack of a video for Gaga's [...] "Telephone" [...] leaves more to the imagination, but if this were a contest, I'd have to say her tune trumps Beyoncé's. [...] greatest promises of unbridled <b>exhibitionism</b> can't quite make the genre feel fresh." [...] The New York Times Jon Caramanica commented that [...] "Video Phone" [...] and [...] "Telephone", [...] "promised a new direction, but all Beyoncé did was show up to prove she could out-Gaga Gaga, then return to her comfort zone."

2500|$|Negoiţescu's main memoir, Straja dragonilor, {{has drawn}} {{attention}} for its frank depiction of precocious sexuality {{in general and}} homosexual experimentation in particular.

According to Alex. Ştefănescu's assessment of the book: [...] "It is {{for the first time that}} a Romanian author analyzes himself with a soberness taken to its last consequences, with even a sort of cruelty, producing confessions that others would not produce even under torture."

2500|$|Homosexuality of the {{protective}} type involves a motive that Bergler describes {{as an attempt}} to show that [...] "father loves his little boy". Homosexuality of the seeking the older protector type is found in homosexual men who search for partners who resemble good fathers who can love them, but unconsciously want to be mistreated by a [...] "bad mother". Homosexuality combined with other types of perversions may involve sado-masochism, <b>exhibitionism,</b> transvestism, urolagnia, or scatology. Bergler maintains that all supposed bisexuals are homosexuals, that bisexuality is a fraud perpetrated by homosexuals, and that efforts by homosexual men to have sex with women involve only [...] "lustless mechanical sex". Homosexuality of the criminal institution type shows, according to Bergler, the similar psychological bases of homosexuality and criminal behavior. Homosexuality in fantasy involves masturbation with homosexual fantasies rather than sexual behavior with another person. Bergler considers all of these types to be based on an attempt to cope with unconscious masochism.|$|E
2500|$|In 1964 After the Fall was produced, and {{is said to}} be {{a deeply}} {{personal}} view of Miller's experiences during his marriage to Monroe. The play reunited Miller with his former friend Kazan: they collaborated on both the script and the direction. After the Fall opened on January 23, 1964, at the ANTA Theatre in Washington Square Park amid a flurry of publicity and outrage at putting a Monroe-like character, called Maggie, on stage. Robert Brustein, in a review in the New Republic, called After the Fall [...] "a three and one half hour breach of taste, a confessional autobiography of embarrassing explicitness [...] [...] [...] there is a misogynistic strain in the play which the author does not seem to recognize[...] [...] [...] He has created a shameless piece of tabloid gossip, an act of <b>exhibitionism</b> which makes us all voyeurs, [...] [...] [...] a wretched piece of dramatic writing." [...] That same year, Miller produced Incident at Vichy. In 1965, Miller was elected the first American president of PEN International, a position which he held for four years. A year later, Miller organized the 1966 PEN congress in New York City. Miller also wrote the penetrating family drama, The Price, produced in 1968. It was Miller's most successful play since Death of a Salesman.|$|E
2500|$|The king's {{personal}} {{life was a}} frequent source of discontent not just amongst Dutch politicians and occasionally the populace, but also abroad (he became exceptionally notorious for his <b>exhibitionism</b> at Lake Geneva). His solitary decision, {{a few weeks after}} Queen Sophie of Württemberg's death, to raise French opera singer Emilie Ambre to 'comtesse d'Ambroise', granting her a luxurious residence in Rijswijk and expressing the intent to marry her without the cabinet's consent, led to political upheaval. His cousin Prince Frederick demanded William to abdicate if he were to continue his plans. Eventually, William conceded and married 20-year-old Emma of Waldeck and Pyrmont instead. All of these actions gave the monarchy a bad name, so much so that throughout the 1880s there were serious calls to abolish the kingship. Outspoken republican writers, journalists and their publishers were increasingly Socialist such as Ferdinand Domela Nieuwenhuis (together with Sicco Roorda van Eysinga thought to be behind the 1887 anonymous libel against William III, titled [...] "From the Life of King Gorilla"). Unlike his father though, William III would not pay to keep his critics silent, but had them arrested and jailed or exiled. Seeing the rise of Socialism as a threat, several Liberals who had been traditionally republican, started the Orangist countermovement. The death of William III, who had no male successor (his sons William and Alexander died in 1879 and 1884, respectively), was seized on by Luxembourg to declare its independence by breaking the personal union with the Netherlands {{on the grounds of the}} lex Salica; however, via the Nassau-Weilburg branch, the monarchy was continued there.|$|E
2500|$|Rating it {{four out}} of five stars, Blender critic Ann Powers stated the album is [...] "Artfully structured, unapologetically explicit, Damita Jo is erotica at its friendliest and most well-balanced. This hour-plus of Tantric flow even erases the memory of Jackson’s clunky Super Bowl breast-baring." [...] Powers added [...] "Her lyrics, though hardly {{avoiding}} familiar sex talk, meld common <b>exhibitionism</b> with convincing intimacies. [...] Jackson brings bliss back to a subject that too many dirty-mouthed hotties have made tedious through overexposure." [...] The album was also considered a [...] "soul-baring, bedroom-eyed record" [...] which was [...] "swimming in pop hooks." [...] Alexis Petridis of The Guardian rated Damita Jo {{four out of}} five stars, saying [...] "Damita Jo's opening salvo is an object lesson in keeping things concise. Four tracks, each barely three minutes long, go hurtling past in a head-spinning blur of snapping rhythms, buzzing synthesized noise and oddly disconnected samples: cut-up vocals and glockenspiel on Strawberry Bounce, rattling tablas on Sexhibition. Elsewhere, there are impossibly lithe basslines - notably on All Nite (Don't Stop) and I Want You, an intriguing electronic reconstruction of an early 1970s soul ballad." [...] Petridis heralded the record as [...] "not only inventive, but brilliantly constructed," [...] with nagging hooks and [...] "explosive" [...] choruses. Calling pop a [...] "singles genre," [...] Power's said [...] "Damita Jos strike rate is remarkably high. It's triumphant stuff." [...] Warner Bros. Publications declared the album [...] "flirty, sensual, hot pop" [...] in [...] "traditional Janet style", adding [...] "The slow grooves blend together and the seductive vocals express passion." [...] Robert Christgau of The Village Voice said [...] "Damita Jo starts off bold - But as the album proceeds it gets realer, mostly whispered softcore by the second half even when it's love songs per se. Call me immature, but I figure there's never enough good sex in the world. In a culture inundated with dirty pornos, Damita Jo is good sex." ...|$|E
