40|$|We {{investigate}} CP-violating effects {{induced by}} light top partners in composite Higgs theories. We find that sizable {{contributions to the}} dipole moments of the light SM quarks and leptons are generically generated at the two-loop level through Barr-Zee-type diagrams. The present constraints on the electron and neutron electric dipole moments translate into bounds on top partner masses of order few TeV and are competitive with the reach of LHC direct searches. Interestingly, we find that CP-violation effects {{are sensitive to the}} same operators that control top partner single production. Near-future improvements in the determination of the <b>electron</b> <b>dipole</b> <b>moment</b> will extend the reach on top partner masses beyond the 5 - 10 TeV range.

40|$|We present {{theoretical}} {{predictions of}} high-order harmonic generation (HHG) {{resulting from the}} interaction of short femtosecond laser pulses with metal nanotips. It has been demonstrated that high energy electrons can be generated using nanotips as sources; furthermore the recollision mechanism has been proven to be the physical mechanism behind this photoemission. If recollision exists, {{it should be possible}} to convert the laser-gained energy by the electron in the continuum in a high energy photon. Consequently the emission of harmonic radiation appears to be viable, although it has not been experimentally demonstrated hitherto.

40|$|We {{report on}} the direct {{experimental}} observation of the 7 pP 23 / 2 → 7 dD 2 optical transitions in 209 and 210 francium isotopes. By continuously monitoring the fluorescence emitted by the isotopes collected in a magneto-optical trap (MOT), the electric dipole transitions 7 pP 23 / 2 → 7 dD 25 / 2 of Fr 209, not yet experimentally observed, and 7 pP 23 / 2 → 7 dD 25 / 2, 7 pP 23 / 2 → 7 dD 25 / 2 of Fr 210 were detected as sub-Doppler depletion dips of the cold atom population. This approach allowed unambiguous identification of the excited state hyperfine structures, {{even in the absence}} of a large stable vapor. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness and the flexibility of fluorescence monitoring of trap depletion upon laser excitation, and broaden the experimental knowledge of francium isotopes and their electronic and nuclear properties.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} the spontaneous CP violation at finite temperature in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model on the baryogenesis at the weak scale. After a brief discussion of the case in which the electroweak phase transition is of the second order, we study in details the baryogenesis scenario when the transition proceeds via bubble nucleation. We show that the space-time dependent phase for the Higgs vacuum expectation values coming from the spontaneous CP violation can give rise to a efficient generation of baryon number inside the bubble walls if the superpotential parameters and the soft supersymmetry breaking ones are complex. However we find that {{in order to get the}} observed value for the baryon asymmetry of the universe the phases of such parameters can be as small as $ 10 ^{- 5 }$, giving rise to an <b>electron</b> <b>dipole</b> <b>moment</b> of the neutron well below the current experimental limit.

50|$|The <b>electron</b> {{electric}} <b>dipole</b> <b>moment</b> (EDM) de is {{an intrinsic}} property of an electron {{such that the}} potential energy is linearly related {{to the strength of}} the electric field: The electron's EDM must be collinear with the direction of the electron's magnetic moment (spin). Within the Standard Model of elementary particle physics, such a dipole is predicted to be non-zero but very small, at most 10−38 e·cm, where e stands for the elementary charge. The existence of a non-zero <b>electron</b> electric <b>dipole</b> <b>moment</b> would imply a violation of both parity invariance and time reversal invariance. In the Standard Model, the electron EDM arises from the CP-violating components of the CKM matrix. The moment is very small because the CP violation involves quarks, not electrons directly, so it can only arise by quantum processes where virtual quarks are created, interact with the electron, and then are annihilated. More precisely, a non-zero EDM does not arise until the level of four-loop Feynman diagrams and higher. An additional, larger EDM (around 10−33 e·cm) is possible in the standard model if neutrinos are majorana particles.|$|R
