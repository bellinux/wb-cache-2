25|$|Additionally, Sistani has a {{substantial}} following within Shia communities {{all over the}} world and is the current Grand Marja of the Twelver sect of Shia Muslims. In Iran, as a result of the post-invasion opening of the Iraqi cities of Najaf and Karbala to Iranians, many <b>Iranians</b> <b>are</b> said to return from pilgrimage in Iraq as supporters of Sistani.|$|E

The need to manage the treatment of such a large number of casualties has placed Iran’s medical specialists in the forefront of the development of effective treatment regimens for chemical weapons victims, and particularly for those suffering from exposure to mustard gas.|$|E

25|$|Mosques {{are usually}} {{explicitly}} Sunni or Shia {{although they are}} over 55 Ahmadiyya mosques as well. There are 2,106 mosques in the United States , and the nation's largest mosque, the Islamic Center of America, is in Dearborn, Michigan. It caters mainly to the Shia Muslim congregation; however, all Muslims may attend this mosque. It was rebuilt in 2005 to accommodate over 3,000 people for the increasing Muslim population in the region. Approximately half (50%) of the religious affiliations of Muslims is Sunni, 16% Shia, 22% non-affiliated and 16% other/non-response. Muslims of Arab descent are mostly Sunni (56%) with minorities who are Shia (19%). Muslims of South Asian descent including Bangladeshis (90%), Indians (82%) and Pakistanis (72%) are mainly Sunni, other groups such as <b>Iranians</b> <b>are</b> mainly Shia (91%). Of African American Muslims, 48% are Sunni, 34% are unaffiliated (mostly part of the Community of W.Deen Mohammed), 16% other (mostly Nation of Islam and Ahmadiyya) and 2% Shia.|$|E
25|$|About 99% of the <b>Iranians</b> <b>are</b> Muslims; 90% {{belong to}} the Shi'a branch of Islam, the {{official}} state religion, and about 9% {{belong to the}} Sunni branch, which predominates in neighboring Muslim countries. Less than 1% non-Muslim minorities include Christians, Zoroastrians, Jews, Bahá'ís, Mandeans, and Yarsan. By far {{the largest group of}} Christians in Iran are Armenians under the Armenian Apostolic Church which has between 110,000, 250,000, and 300,000, adherents. There are hundreds of Christian churches in Iran. The Bahá'í Faith, Iran's largest non-Muslim religious minority with a population around 300,000, is not officially recognized (and therefore not included in the census results), and has been persecuted during its existence in Iran. Since the 1979 revolution the persecution of Bahá'ís has increased with executions, the denial of civil rights and liberties, and the denial of access to higher education and employment. Unofficial estimates for the Assyrian Christian population range between 20,000, and 70,000. The number of Iranian Mandaeans is a matter of dispute. In 2009, there were an estimated 5,000 and 10,000 Mandaeans in Iran, according to the Associated Press. Whereas Alarabiya has put the number of Iranian Mandaeans as high as 60,000 in 2011.|$|E

2500|$|During the Persian Gulf War, most Iraqi {{pilots and}} {{aircraft}} (of French and Soviet origin) fled to Iran {{to escape the}} bombing campaign because no other country would allow them sanctuary.

Because of this Saddam Hussein did not send the rest of his Air Force to Iran just prior to Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2003, instead opting to bury them in sand. Saddam Hussein, preoccupied with Iran and regional power balance, is reported to have commented: [...] "The <b>Iranians</b> <b>are</b> even stronger than before, they now have our Air Force." ...|$|E

2500|$|In February 2011, Ali Khamenei {{supported}} the Egyptian uprising against their government, describing it as Islamic awakening instead of Arab Spring. Trying {{to communicate with}} Arab people, he addressed Egypt's protesters in Arabic. (<b>Iranians</b> <b>are</b> not Arabs, and Iran's official language is Persian) He introduced himself as [...] "your brother in religion", while praising the [...] "explosion of sacred anger". Later, in [...] "Islamic Awakening conferences" [...] which were held in Tehran, Khamenei praised the Muslim youths of Tunisia, Libya, Egypt, Yemen and Bahrain for {{what he described as}} Islamic awakening. He also paralleled these events with Islamic revolution in Iran during his Nowruz oration in 2011. However, major protests against the Iranian regime also broke out throughout Iran in 2011, and they became known as the 2011–12 Iranian protests.|$|E
2500|$|In {{another such}} tradition, Ali was once reciting a sermon {{in the city}} of Kufah, when Ash'as ibn Qays, a {{commander}} in the Arab army protested, [...] "Amir-al-Momeneen!

[...] Ali immediately retorted, [...] "While fat Arabs rest in soft beds, the Iranians work hard on the hottest days to please God with their efforts. And what do these Arabs want from me? To ostracize the Iranians and become an oppressor! I swear by the God that splits the nucleus and creates Man, I heard the prophet once say, just as you strike the Iranians with your swords in the name of Islam, so will the Iranians one day strike you back the same way for Islam." ...|$|E

2500|$|Iran insists {{enrichment}} {{activities are}} intended for peaceful purposes, {{but much of the}} West, including the United States, allege that Iran is pursuing nuclear weapons, or a nuclear weapons [...] "capability". 31 August 2006, deadline called for Iran to comply with UN Security Council Resolution 1696 and suspend its enrichment-related activities or face the possibility of economic sanctions. The United States believes the council will agree to implement sanctions when high-level ministers reconvene in mid-September, U.S. Undersecretary of State Nicholas Burns said. [...] "We're sure going to work toward that [...] {{with a great deal of}} energy and determination because this cannot go unanswered," [...] Burns said. [...] "The <b>Iranians</b> <b>are</b> obviously proceeding with their nuclear research; they are doing things that the International Atomic Energy Agency does not want them to do, the Security Council doesn't want them to do.

2500|$|Interviews {{and surveys}} show that the {{majority}} of Iranians in all groups favor their country's nuclear program. Polls in 2008 showed {{that the vast majority of}} Iranians want their country to develop nuclear energy, and 90% of Iranians believe it is important (including 81% very important) for Iran [...] "to have a full fuel cycle nuclear program." [...] Though <b>Iranians</b> <b>are</b> not Arab, Arab publics in six countries also believe that Iran has the right to its nuclear program and should not be pressured to stop that program. A poll in September 2010 by the International Peace Institute found that 71 percent of Iranians favored the development of nuclear weapons, a drastic hike over the previous polls by the same agency. [...] However, in July 2012, a poll on an Iranian state-run media outlet found that 2/3 Iranians support suspending uranium enrichment in return for a gradual easing of sanctions. Meir Javedanfar, an Iranian-born commentator with the Middle East Economic and Political Analysis Company, stated that while Iranians may want nuclear energy, they don't want it at the price the government is willing to pay.|$|E

And I'd like to repeat, I do not know whether or not the Quds Force was ordered from the top echelons of government. But my point is what's worse – them ordering it and it happening, or them not ordering it and it happening? And so we will continue to protect our troops. ... to say it [...] is provoking Iran is just a wrong way to characterize the Commander-in-Chief's decision to do what is necessary to protect our soldiers in harm's way. And I will continue to do so. ... Whether Ahmadinejad ordered the Quds force to do this, I don't think we know. But we do know that they're there, and I intend to do something about it. And I've asked our commanders to do something about it. And we're going to protect our troops. ... I don't think we know who {{picked up the phone and}} said to the Quds Force, go do this, but we know it's a vital part of the Iranian government. …What matters is, is that we're responding. The idea that somehow we're manufacturing the idea that the <b>Iranians</b> <b>are</b> providing IEDs is preposterous. ... My job is to protect our troops.
