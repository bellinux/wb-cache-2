40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{aimed at}} {{measuring}} the lipophilicity and <b>ionization</b> <b>constants</b> of diastereoisomeric dipeptides, interpreting {{them in terms}} of conformational behavior, and developing statistical models to predict them. METHODS: A series of 20 dipeptides of general structure NH(2) -L-X-(L or D) -His-OMe was designed and synthetized. Their experimental <b>ionization</b> <b>constants</b> (pK(1), pK(2) and pK(3)) and lipophilicity parameters (log[*]P(N) and log[*]D(7. 4)) were measured by potentiometry. Molecular modeling in three media (vacuum, water, and chloroform) was used to explore and sample their conformational space, and for each stored conformer to calculate their radius of gyration, virtual log[*]P (preferably written as log[*]P(MLP), meaning obtained by the molecular lipophilicity potential (MLP) method) and polar surface area (PSA). Means and ranges were calculated for these properties, as was their sensitivity (i. e., the ratio between property range and number of rotatable bonds). RESULTS: Marked differences between diastereoisomers were seen in their experimental <b>ionization</b> <b>constants</b> and lipophilicity parameters. These differences are explained by molecular flexibility, configuration-dependent differences in intramolecular interactions, and accessibility of functional groups. Multiple linear equations correlated experimental lipophilicity parameters and <b>ionization</b> <b>constants</b> with PSA range and other calculated parameters. CONCLUSION: This study documents the differences in lipophilicity and <b>ionization</b> <b>constants</b> between diastereoisomeric dipeptides. Such configuration-dependent differences are shown to depend markedly on differences in conformational behavior and to be amenable to multiple linear regression.

Method. The B 3 LYP/ 6 - 311 ++G(d,p) and HF/ 6 - 311 ++G(d,p) methods were used for performing the calculations that permitted to describe the molecular conformations and solute-solvent interactions of the acids and their corresponding conjugate bases.

The effects of substituents and alkyl groups on the <b>ionization</b> <b>constants</b> of the benzoyl thiourea derivatives have been investigated. A comparison of the basicities of ethyl, n-propyl, and n-butyl thiourea derivatives (−C 2 H 5 <−C 3 H 7 <−C 4 H 9) shows that the n-butyl group is a more powerful electron-releasing group than the other groups in 50 % dioxane- 50 % water mixture (v:v). So, the acidity of benzoyl thiourea derivative compounds decreases, while the length of alkyl chain increases. The orders of pKa values for all thiourea derivatives are as expected {{in the light of}} steric, resonance and inductive effects of substituents. Furthermore, when the basicities of halogen derivatives of the same substitution pattern are compared, orders obtained (4 -Br < 4 -Cl < 4 -H) can be explained by considering the total electronic substituent effect (electron-withdrawing and electron-donating effects) except the 4 -Br_Ph derivative...|$|R
