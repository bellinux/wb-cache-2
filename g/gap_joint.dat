40|$|Balancing of the <b>joint</b> <b>gap</b> in {{extension}} and flexion {{is a prerequisite}} for success of a total knee arthroplasty. The <b>joint</b> <b>gap</b> is influenced by patellar position. We therefore hypothesized the state of the knee extensor mechanism (including the patellar tendon) would influence the <b>joint</b> <b>gap.</b> In 20 knees undergoing posterior-stabilized type total knee arthroplasties, we measured the <b>joint</b> <b>gap</b> and the patellar tendon strain from 0 ° to 135 ° flexion with the femoral component in position. When the patella was reduced, the <b>joint</b> <b>gap</b> was decreased at 90 ° and 135 ° (by 1. 9  mm and 5. 5  mm, respectively) compared with the gap with the patella everted. The patellar tendon strain increased with knee flexion. Patellar tendon strain at 90 ° flexion correlated with the <b>joint</b> <b>gap</b> difference with the patella in everted and reduced positions. This suggests that in addition to the collateral ligaments, the knee extensor mechanism may have an influence on the <b>joint</b> <b>gap.</b> Therefore, accounting for extensor mechanism tightness may be important in achieving the optimal <b>joint</b> <b>gap</b> balance during total knee arthroplasty...|$|R

A watertight system, invented by the Swiss company Mageba, is designed on a modular basis and can be tailored to satisfy the specific requirements of almost any structure. Modular multiple-gap expansion joints can accommodate movements in every direction and rotations about every axis. They {{can be used for}} longitudinal movements of as little as 160 mm, or for very large movements of well over 3000 mm. The total movement of the bridge deck is divided among a number of individual gaps which are created by horizontal surface beams. The individual gaps are sealed by watertight elastomeric profiles, and surface beam movements are regulated by an elastic control system. The drainage of the joint is via the drainage system of the bridge deck. Certain joints feature so-called “sinus plates” on their surface, which reduce noise from over-passing traffic by up to 80%.|$|E

40|$|The {{designer}} of lattice trusses has been traditionally encouraged to avoid extra joint bending moments by ensuring 'noding' of member centre lines. This can however cause {{problems in the}} design of RHS trusses with small (economical) branch members by causing large gaps at joints with undesirable flexibility for slender chord walls. 100 % overlap joints overcome this problem while still maintaining economic single cut branch ends. The research programme set out first to highlight the difference in behaviour of trusses with large gap noding and completely overlapping joints. Two similar trusses - one gap, the other lap - with matched sections were tested to failure. It was concluded that the <b>gap</b> <b>joint</b> truss (branch/chord width ratio = 0. 4) was much less efficient than the corresponding 100 % overlap truss despite the large eccentricities. The collapse load of the latter was some 35 % greater, while the stiffness properties were better, and remained linear for a substantial proportion of the loading. On the other hand the <b>gap</b> <b>joint</b> truss soon became non-linear, with large overall deflections. Local connecting chord wall deflections were quite small in the lap joints while appreciable deflections occurred at gap joints under service loads. Elastic frame analyses were carried out for all the six test trusses (one gap and five lap). For the overlap trusses, axial forces and bending moments could be predicted fairly accurately but a non-linear analysis was required for the gap jointed truss even at fairly modest loads. The effects of ß ratio, chord slenderness and branch angle were all examined within the parameter range tested. The advantages of truss continuity moments as well as plastic redistribution of moments have been observed to reduce the occurrence of the local chord buckling mode of failure (L 7), compared with previous isolated joint tests. Results obtained from tests on isolated joints can give good agreement with those obtained from truss tests, both with respect to strength and failure mode. However, as the isolated joint testing cannot always reproduce the support conditions in a truss, the failure modes (and hence strengths) can differ. The current CIDECT design strength equations and recommendations for gap and overlap joints are largely {{based on the results of}} isolated joint testing. The suitability of the CIDECT strength equations and recommendations for designing RHS lattice trusses has been reviewed. Consequently, for the 100 % overlap joint trusses a simple design method has been presented in conjunction with practical design recommendations. The problems associated with the analysis and design of the <b>gap</b> <b>joint</b> truss are described in detail...|$|E

40|$|The CO 2 -laser-MAG hybrid {{welding process}} {{has been shown to}} be a {{productive}} choice for the welding industry, being used in e. g. the shipbuilding, pipe and beam manufacturing, and automotive industries. It provides an opportunity to increase the productivity of welding of joints containing air gaps compared with autogenous laser beam welding, with associated reductions in distortion and marked increases in welding speeds and penetration in comparison with both arc and autogenous laser welding. The literature study indicated that the phenomena of laser hybrid welding are mostly being studied using bead-on-plate welding or zero air gap configurations. This study shows it very clearly that the CO 2 laser-MAG hybrid welding process is completely different, when there is a groove with an air gap. As in case of industrial use it is excepted that welding is performed for non-zero grooves, this study is of great importance for industrial applications. The results of this study indicate that by using a 6 kW CO 2 laser-MAG hybrid welding process, the welding speed may also be increased if an air gap is present in the joint. Experimental trials indicated that the welding speed may be increased by 30 - 82 % when compared with bead-on-plate welding, or welding of a joint with no air gap i. e. a joint prepared as optimum for autogenous laser welding. This study demonstrates very clearly, that the separation of the different processes, as well as the relative configurations of the processes (arc leading or trailing) affect welding performance significantly. These matters influence the droplet size and therefore the metal transfer mode, which in turn determined the resulting weld quality and the ability to bridge air gaps. Welding in bead-onplate mode, or of an I butt joint containing no air <b>gap</b> <b>joint</b> is facilitated by using a leading torch. This is due to the preheating effect of the arc, which increases the absorptivity of the work piece to the laser beam, enabling greater penetration and the use of higher welding speeds. With an air gap present, air gap bridging is more effectively achieved by using a trailing torch because of the lower arc power needed, the wider arc, and the movement of droplets predominantly towards the joint edges. The experiments showed, that the mode of metal transfer has a marked effect on gap bridgeability. Transfer of a single droplet per arc pulse may not be desirable if an air gap is present, because most of the droplets are directed towards the middle of the joint where no base material is present. In such cases, undercut is observed. Pulsed globular and rotational metal transfer modes enable molten metal to also be transferred to the joint edges, and are therefore superior metal transfer modes when bridging air gaps. It was also found very obvious, that process separation is an important factor in gap bridgeability. If process separation is too large, the resulting weld often exhibits sagging, or no weld may be formed at all as a result of the reduced interaction between the component processes. In contrast, if the processes are too close to one another, the processing region contains excess molten metal that may create difficulties for the keyhole to remain open. When the distance is optimised - i. e. a separation of 0 - 4 mm in this study, depending on the welding speed and beam-arc configuration - the processes act together, creating beneficial synergistic effects. The optimum process separation when using a trailing torch was found to be shorter (0 - 2 mm) than when a leading torch is used (2 - 4 mm); a result of the facilitation of weld pool motion when the latter configuration is adopted. This study demonstrates, that the MAG process used has a strong effect on the CO 2 -laser-MAG hybrid welding process. The laser beam welding component is relatively stable and easy to manage, with only two principal processing parameters (power and welding speed) needing to be adjusted. In contrast, the MAG process has a large number of processing parameters to optimise, all of which play an important role in the interaction between the laser beam and the arc. The parameters used for traditional MAG welding are often not optimal in achieving the most appropriate mode of metal transfer, and weld quality in laser hybrid welding, and must be optimised if the full range of benefits provided by hybrid welding are to be realised...|$|E
40|$|Due {{to their}} {{corrosion}} resistance, duplex stainless steels are widely applied in various industries in which corrosion resistance is a required property. Unlike ferritic and austenitic stainless steels, duplex stainless steels have superior mechanical strength {{and can be}} used to produce lighter equipment. When thermally cycled, the properties of these steels can change, especially when using joining processes such as brazing, and when the austenite/ferrite volume fraction becomes imbalanced. This study aims to describe the brazing of lean duplex and superduplex stainless steels, verifying the effect of the <b>joint</b> <b>gap</b> and brazing time on the formation of continuous intermetallics inside the brazed joint. In this study, samples of duplex stainless steel UNS S 32101, UNS S 32304 and UNS S 32750 were brazed in a continuous hydrogen atmosphere furnace, using BNi- 7 (Ni–Cr–P) filler metal for brazing at a temperature of 1100 °C, for 12 and 32 min, using <b>joint</b> <b>gaps</b> of 0. 0 and 0. 3 mm, followed by in-furnace cooling.
