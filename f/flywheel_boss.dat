5000|$|The L20B was a 1,952 cc (85.0 x 86.0 mm) engine {{produced}} from 1974 through 1985. It produces [...] in 1974-75 form with 112 lbft Nm of torque as {{installed in the}} Datsun 610 and [...] in 1977-78 form with 102 lbft Nm of torque as installed in the 200SX. The L20B engine introduced larger-diameter (60 mm) main bearings while retaining a fully counterweighted crankshaft. The forged U60 crankshaft also ushered {{in the use of}} a six-bolt <b>flywheel</b> <b>boss.</b> The block introduced a taller deck height to accommodate the longer stroke and connecting rods. This specification would also be used later in the Z20 and Z22 engine series. The bigger powerplant even helped spawn an important new offering from Datsun's competition department -50mm Solex twin-choke carburetor kits- complete fuel systems that help produce nearly double the power from the ubiquitous L20B. The legendary robustness and nearly square configuration have made this engine a popular choice among tuners for turbocharging.|$|E
