5|$|While {{the famous}} Saint Peter's Basilica {{is located in}} Vatican City, above the {{traditional}} site of Saint Peter's tomb, the papal cathedral for the Diocese of Rome is Saint John Lateran, located within the city of Rome, though enjoying <b>extraterritorial</b> privileges accredited to the Holy See.|$|E
5|$|Although it is {{situated}} in New York City, the land occupied by the United Nations Headquarters and the spaces of buildings that it rents are under the sole administration of the United Nations and not the U.S. government. They are technically <b>extraterritorial</b> through a treaty agreement with the U.S. government. However, in exchange for local police, fire protection and other services, the United Nations agrees to acknowledge most local, state, and federal laws.|$|E
5|$|As the plenary {{legislative}} {{powers of}} the Parliament were sufficient to grant <b>extraterritorial</b> legislative powers to the Parliament, the Court declined to pronounce whether Article 73(a) was an empowering provision. However, it indicated on an obiter basis that had it been necessary to do so, it would have accepted the Attorney-General's alternate submission that Article 73(a) of the Malaysian Constitution was never intended to be an empowering provision.|$|E
5|$|The {{appellant}} further highlighted {{that section}} 6 of the Republic of Singapore Independence Act ("RSIA"), which was enacted shortly after Singapore's independence from Malaysia, provides that Part IV of the Constitution of Malaysia ceased to have effect in Singapore. Since Part IV contains Article 73(a) – the extraterritoriality clause – the appellant argued that its exclusion meant that Singapore's Parliament was not empowered {{to make any}} law which had <b>extraterritorial</b> effect.|$|E
5|$|Passport to Pimlico {{explores the}} spirit and unity of wartime London in a post-war context and offers an {{examination}} of the English character. Like other of the Ealing comedies, the film pits a small group of British against a series of changes to the status quo from an external agent. The story was an original concept by the screenwriter T. E. B. Clarke. He was inspired by an incident during the Second World War, when the maternity ward of Ottawa Civic Hospital was temporarily declared <b>extraterritorial</b> by the Canadian government so that when Princess Juliana of the Netherlands gave birth, the baby was born on Dutch territory, and would not lose her right to the throne.|$|E
5|$|The {{plot was}} an {{original}} story by T. E. B. Clarke, {{a writer of}} both comedy and drama scripts for Ealing; his other screenplays for the studio include Hue and Cry (1947), Against the Wind (1948), The Blue Lamp (1950), The Lavender Hill Mob (1951) and The Titfield Thunderbolt (1953). Clarke was inspired by an incident during the Second World War, when the maternity ward of Ottawa Civic Hospital was temporarily declared <b>extraterritorial</b> by the Canadian government {{so that when the}} then-Princess Juliana of the Netherlands gave birth to Princess Margriet of the Netherlands, the baby was born on international territory, thus not on Canadian territory (though not on Dutch territory), and would not lose her right to the throne. The airlift of food supplies into the Burgundian enclave was influenced by the flights of food and supplies during the Berlin Blockade of June 1948 – May 1949. The music for the film was composed by Georges Auric, who had been involved in several other productions for Ealing Studios.|$|E
5|$|Galata, {{then the}} suburb of Sykai, was an {{integral}} part of the city by the early 5th century: the Notitia Urbis Constantinopolitanae of ca. 425 names it as the city's 13th region. It was probably fortified with walls in the 5th century, and under Justinian I it was granted the status of a city. The settlement declined and disappeared after the 7th century, leaving only the great tower (the kastellion tou Galatou) in modern Karaköy, that guarded the chain extending across the mouth of the Golden Horn. After the sack of the city in 1204, Galata became a Venetian quarter, and later a Genoese <b>extraterritorial</b> colony, effectively outside Byzantine control. Despite Byzantine opposition, the Genoese managed to surround their quarter with a moat, and by joining their castle-like houses with walls they created the first wall around the colony. The Galata Tower, then called Christea Turris ("Tower of Christ"), and another stretch of walls to its north were built in 1349. Further expansions followed in 1387, 1397 and 1404, enclosing an area larger than that originally allocated to them, stretching from the modern district of Azapkapı north to Şişhane, from there to Tophane and thence to Karaköy. After the Ottoman conquest, the walls were maintained until the 1870s, when most were demolished to facilitate the expansion of the city. Today only the Galata Tower, visible from most of historical Constantinople, remains intact, along with several smaller fragments.|$|E
5|$|Unlike English common law, Chinese law {{held the}} community, {{rather than the}} individual, {{responsible}} for transgressions. Imperial Commissioner Lin Zexu demanded {{the death of the}} culprit and was prepared to accept any sailor, whether innocent or guilty, to settle the matter. On 12 August, under an Act of Parliament of 1833, Elliot began a Court of Criminal and Admiralty Jurisdiction on board the Fort William in Hong Kong harbour, with himself as judge and a group of merchants as the jury. Two men were found guilty of rioting, fined £15 each, and sentenced to three months hard labour to be served in England while a further three men were found guilty of assault and rioting, fined £25 each, and sentenced to six months imprisonment in similar conditions. However, the Act was under review and after arriving in England, they were set free {{on the grounds that the}} trial held no jurisdiction. Elliot invited Lin to send observers to the trial, but none came. Without the handover of a man to the Chinese, Lin was not satisfied with the proceedings. He viewed the <b>extraterritorial</b> court as an infringement of China's sovereignty.|$|E
25|$|By 1925–1926, Siamese <b>extraterritorial</b> {{rights were}} {{restored}} {{a period of}} 5 years thereafter.|$|E
25|$|Economic antisemitism: BDS {{movements}} and the <b>extraterritorial</b> application of restrictive covenants against countries trading with Israel.|$|E
25|$|The case of Folger vs. Lecuyer was {{important}} because it resulted in the United States ending French <b>extraterritorial</b> rights with respect to privateers and their prizes.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to companies doing business {{within the city}} limits, several large industrial facilities are located within the city's five-mile <b>extraterritorial</b> jurisdiction boundaries including the ExxonMobil Beaumont refinery and chemical plants, Goodyear Beaumont chemical plant, and DuPont chemical plant.|$|E
25|$|Under {{the terms}} of the Lateran Treaty, the Holy See has <b>extraterritorial</b> {{authority}} over various sites in Rome and two Italian sites outside of Rome, including the Pontifical Palace at Castel Gandolfo. The same authority is extended under international law over the Apostolic Nunciature of the Holy See in a foreign country.|$|E
25|$|Cypress is an unincorporated {{community}} in Harris County, Texas, United States located completely inside the <b>extraterritorial</b> {{jurisdiction of the}} City of Houston. The Cypress area is located along U.S. Highway 290 (Northwest Freeway) is twenty-four miles (35km) northwest of Downtown Houston. The Cypress urban cluster ranks 50th in the top 100 highest-income urban areas in the United States.|$|E
25|$|On 29 November 1947, the United Nations General Assembly {{approved}} a plan which would partition the British Mandate of Palestine into two states: one Jewish and one Arab. Each {{state would be}} composed of three major sections, linked by <b>extraterritorial</b> crossroads, plus an Arab enclave at Jaffa. Expanded Jerusalem would fall under international control as a Corpus Separatum.|$|E
25|$|The {{war ended}} in the signing of China's first Unequal Treaty, the Treaty of Nanking. In the {{supplementary}} Treaty of the Bogue, the Qing empire also recognized Britain as an equal to China and gave British subjects <b>extraterritorial</b> privileges in treaty ports. In 1844, the United States and France concluded similar treaties with China, the Treaty of Wanghia and Treaty of Whampoa, respectively.|$|E
25|$|The archbasilica is sited in the City of Rome, {{outside and}} distanced from Vatican City proper, which is {{approximately}} 4km (2.5mi) to its northwest, although the archbasilica and its adjoining edifices have <b>extraterritorial</b> status from Italy {{as one of}} the properties of the Holy See, subject to the sovereignty of the latter, pursuant to the Lateran Treaty of 1929 with Italy under Benito Mussolini.|$|E
25|$|A {{large number}} of Jews, perhaps more than 6000, found refuge in the various {{religious}} properties of Rome, including monasteries and convents; a much smaller number, took refuge in Vatican City itself. It {{is clear from the}} number of letters of protection issued by von Weizsäcker that many of the buildings possessing letters of protecting (and asserting <b>extraterritorial</b> status) were in fact not owned by the Church.|$|E
25|$|On Monday March 8, 2004 Abbas, age 55, died {{of natural}} causes while an American {{prisoner}} in an Iraqi jail outside Baghdad. He had been held there while discussions about his legal status and whether he could be tried in the US or elsewhere had continued. Most US anti-terrorism laws with <b>extraterritorial</b> provisions had been enacted after the hijacking, and the Italian government despite having sentenced Abbas to five consecutive life sentences in absentia had not sought his extradition.|$|E
25|$|In {{the history}} of Western world (sometimes more {{precisely}} as Greco-Roman world) adopted by the Roman Empire and the Byzantine Empire, Christian ecclesiastical provinces were named by analogy with the secular Roman province as well as certain <b>extraterritorial</b> formations of western world in early medieval times (see Early Middle Ages). The administrative seat of each province is an episcopal see. In hierarchical Christian churches that have dioceses, a province {{is a collection of}} those dioceses (as a basic unit of administration).|$|E
25|$|In 1842, the Qing {{authorities}} {{sued for}} peace, which concluded with the Treaty of Nanjing signed on a gunboat in the river, negotiated in August {{of that year}} and ratified in 1843. In the treaty, China was forced to pay an indemnity to Britain, open five ports to Britain, and cede Hong Kong to Queen Victoria. In the supplementary Treaty of the Bogue, the Qing empire also recognized Britain as an equal to China and gave British subjects <b>extraterritorial</b> privileges in treaty ports.|$|E
25|$|On {{request of}} the Senate of Hamburg Luther had sent Bugenhagen to the city. He {{developed}} the Lutheran Church Order for Hamburg in 1529. He first aimed at seizing the revenues of concathedral and chapter in favour of the common chest of the urban parishes, financing pastors and teachers. The chapter would be dissolved and the released canons paid a life annuity. However, the then still steadfastly Catholic capitulars refused and {{were not to be}} forced due to their immunity and <b>extraterritorial</b> status.|$|E
25|$|Until their {{amendment}} in 1999 Articles 2 and 3 {{were the}} subject of some controversy, particularly among Unionists in Northern Ireland. To Northern Ireland Unionists the articles were a hostile claim upon their territory, and a declaration {{that they might be}} coerced into a united Ireland without their consent, and in violation of the sovereignty by the United Kingdom over Northern Ireland. Furthermore, they claimed, the articles constituted an <b>extraterritorial</b> claim to a part of a foreign nation and were therefore in violation of international law.|$|E
25|$|In cases {{involving}} alleged immorality or injustice, that rule has been criticised as susceptible to abuse, as a court could characterise almost any statute or rule as being offensive {{to the public}} policy of their state. Less controversial are bars to any cases that would give <b>extraterritorial</b> effect to laws which are confiscatory, seeking to collect taxes owing in another state, or penal: laws {{that are designed to}} punish the party committing the wrong, rather than those to compensate the party that suffered loss or injury.|$|E
25|$|Mitchell's {{original}} plan was for The Woodlands to be annexed {{by the city}} of Houston. In the middle part of the 2000s (decade), some residents feared such an annexation, as had happened to the Kingwood development almost a decade before. To counteract any possible move by the city, a movement began to create an independent city government. However, the formation of an independent government would require authorization by the State of Texas and the City of Houston, as Houston held <b>extraterritorial</b> jurisdiction over the area.|$|E
25|$|Starting in 1522 Lutheranism {{spread among}} the s of Hamburg, gaining their vast {{majority}} by 1526, while most canons {{of the cathedral}} chapter rather clung to Catholicism, enjoying their <b>extraterritorial</b> status. Hamburg's Senate (city government) accounted for the new facts and adopted the new denomination in 1528. So when in October 1529, the senate – wielding its advowson – appointed Johannes Aepinus (d. 1553) as Lutheran pastor at the neighbouring St. Peter's Church, in order to introduce Johannes Bugenhagen's Lutheran Church Order in the city, Aepinus contested with the prevailingly Catholic cathedral chapter.|$|E
25|$|In 1664, {{however, the}} Dutch used force to exact a treaty {{granting}} them <b>extraterritorial</b> rights {{as well as}} freer access to trade. At the urging of his foreign minister, the Greek adventurer Constantine Phaulkon, Narai turned to France for assistance. French engineers constructed fortifications for the Thais and built a new palace at Lopburi for Narai. In addition, French missionaries engaged in education and medicine and brought the first printing press into the country. Louis XIV's personal interest was aroused by reports from missionaries suggesting that Narai might be converted to Christianity.|$|E
25|$|On 18 January 1960, the Supreme Court {{handed down}} three more {{verdicts}} to clarify and extend Kinsella v. Krueger. In Kinsella v. United States, the Court extended the ruling to dependents for non-capital offenses. Grisham v. Hagen extended it to civilian {{employees of the}} military for capital offenses, and McElroy v. United States to civilian employees for all offenses. The {{gap in the law}} remained for many years, until the passage of the Military <b>Extraterritorial</b> Jurisdiction Act, which President Bill Clinton signed into law on 22 November 2000.|$|E
25|$|King Narai further {{sought to}} expand {{relations}} with the French, to counter Portuguese and Dutch influence in his kingdom, and {{at the suggestion of}} his Greek counselor Constantine Phaulkon. In 1664, the Dutch had used force to exact a treaty granting them <b>extraterritorial</b> rights as well as freer access to trade. In 1680, a first Siamese ambassador to France was sent in the person of Phya Pipatkosa on board the Soleil d'Orient, but the ship was wrecked off the coast of Africa after leaving Mauritius and he disappeared.|$|E
25|$|The {{stones were}} sold off or used to {{reinforce}} the sea defenses along the Elbe; the funerary sculptures and monuments were broken up and used in {{the reconstruction of the}} city's rudimentary sewage system. The Senate was partly motivated by the desire to rid the city of an <b>extraterritorial</b> institution, but it is more than possible that the rise in rents and the high demand for housing at the time also played a role. In any case, the incident was typical of the celebrated Philistinism of the Hamburg authorities. Five more medieval churches in the city were pulled down between 1807 and 1837.|$|E
25|$|Some Cornish people, {{including}} Cornish Solidarity and {{the group}} claiming to be the Revived Cornish Stannary Parliament, argue that Cornwall has a de jure status apart as a sovereign Duchy <b>extraterritorial</b> to England. A commonly cited basis for this argument {{is a case of}} arbitration between the Crown and the Duchy of Cornwall (1856–1857) in which the Officers of the Duchy successfully argued that the Duchy enjoyed many of the rights and prerogatives of a County palatine and that although the duke was not granted Royal Jurisdiction, was considered to be quasi-sovereign within his Duchy of Cornwall.|$|E
25|$|The {{territory}} includes Saint Peter's Square, {{separated from}} the territory of Italy only by a white line along the limit of the square, where it borders Piazza Pio XII. St. Peter's Square is reached through the Via della Conciliazione, which runs from the Tiber to St. Peter's. This grand approach was designed by architects Piacentini and Spaccarelli, for want of Benito Mussolini and {{in accordance with the}} church, after the conclusion of the Lateran Treaty. According to the Lateran Treaty, certain properties of the Holy See located in Italian territory, most notably the Papal Palace of Castel Gandolfo and the major basilicas, enjoy <b>extraterritorial</b> status similar to that of foreign embassies.|$|E
25|$|Josipović won all Croatian {{counties}} {{except for}} the Lika-Senj county, the least populated Croatian county. Similarly, he won all cities with more than 20,000 inhabitants and all cities that are county seats, except for Gospić, {{which is also the}} smallest. The capital city Zagreb was also won by Josipović, with a margin that was slightly higher than the national average. Bandić was unsuccessful in the majority of Zagreb boroughs, but he did win Lika and the <b>extraterritorial</b> electoral unit, where the majority of votes came from Bosnia and Herzegovina. The closest margins were in the traditional right-wing strongholds in parts of Slavonia and Dalmatia.|$|E
25|$|The <b>extraterritorial</b> {{status and}} the denominational {{opposition}} strengthened the perception of cathedral, chapter, and immunity district as alien element within the city. While almost all inhabitants outside the immunity district had become parishioners of the now Lutheran parish churches, the huge cathedral lacked a congregation. Between the Feast of the Assumption of Mary and December 1529 the city's militia barred out churchgoers from access to the cathedral, given up after imperial protests. Furthermore the capitular estates in Hamburg and spread all over the North Elbian diocesan area, forming the endowment to maintain canons and cathedral, were increasingly withheld by the respective territorial rulers. Thus in May 1531 the chapter closed the cathedral and its maintenance was neglected.|$|E
25|$|The {{national}} crisis was {{widely seen as}} being caused by foreign aggression. Foreign powers had defeated China in several wars, forced a right to promote Christianity and imposed unequal treaties under which foreigners and foreign companies in China were accorded special privileges, <b>extraterritorial</b> rights and immunities from Chinese law, causing resentment among the Chinese. France, Japan, Russia and Germany carved out spheres of influence, so that by 1900 it appeared that China would likely be dismembered, with foreign powers each ruling {{a part of the}} country. Thus, by 1900, the Qing dynasty, which had ruled China for more than two centuries, was crumbling and Chinese culture was under assault by powerful and unfamiliar religions and secular cultures.|$|E
25|$|After the US {{turned over}} control of the 737 to Italy, Egyptian diplomat Hamed {{returned}} to the plane with Italian base commander Colonel Annicchiarico. Hamed told the men of Force 777 that the Egyptian government had agreed to turn over the hijackers to the Italians. Both Abbas and Badrakkan refused to leave the plane claiming diplomatic rights – maintaining that they had diplomatic immunity as representatives of the PLO and Arafat. Learning of this the Egyptian Government changed its position, declaring that the two were on board an Egyptian aircraft on a government mission – thus accruing <b>extraterritorial</b> rights. Egypt requested Italy let the plane leave with the two men on board as they had been brought to Italy against their will. When the Italians refused this demand the Egyptians denied Achille Lauro permission to leave Port Said.|$|E
