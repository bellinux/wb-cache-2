6000|$|Restrictions on {{importation}} do, however, tend to keep {{down the}} value and price of our remaining imports, and {{to keep up the}} nominal or money prices of all our other commodities, by retaining a greater quantity of money in the country than would otherwise be there. From this it obviously follows, that if the restrictions were removed, we should have to pay rather more for some of the articles which we now import, while those which we are now prevented from importing would cost us more than might be inferred from their present price in the foreign market. And general prices would fall; to the benefit of those who have <b>fixed</b> <b>sums</b> to receive; to the disadvantage of those who have <b>fixed</b> <b>sums</b> to pay; and giving rise, as a general fall of prices always does, to an appearance, though a temporary and fallacious one, of general distress.

25|$|The {{following}} {{table lists}} a few selected values for t-distributions with ν {{degrees of freedom}} {{for a range of}} one-sided or two-sided critical regions. For an example of how to read this table, take the fourth row, which begins with 4; that means ν, the number of degrees of freedom, is 4 (and if we are dealing, as above, with n values with a <b>fixed</b> <b>sum,</b> n = 5). Take the fifth entry, in the column headed 95% for one-sided (90% for two-sided). The value of that entry is 2.132. Then the probability that T is less than 2.132 is 95% or Pr(−∞ < T < 2.132) = 0.95; this also means that Pr(−2.132 < T < 2.132) = 0.9.|$|E

25|$|The {{sixth century}} saw the {{development}} in Ireland of Penitentials, handbooks for confessors in assigning penance. The Penitential of Cummean counseled a priest {{to take into}} consideration in imposing a penance, the penitent's strengths and weaknesses. Some penances could be commuted through payments or substitutions. It became customary to commute penances to less demanding works, such as prayers, alms, fasts and even the payment of <b>fixed</b> <b>sums</b> of money depending on the various kinds of offenses (tariff penances). While the sanctions in early penitentials, such as that of Gildas, were primarily act of mortification or in some cases excommunication, the inclusion of fines in later compilations derive from secular law.|$|R

25|$|The New South Wales Government did {{not wish}} the company to remain as a main line operator, or to {{purchase}} it themselves; while South Australian train crews were not happy to work trains across the state border due {{to a loss of}} favourable industrial conditions. When the company purchased its diesel locomotives, a number of structures, including bridges, were modified (loading gauge and axle loading) to carry standard gauge, as the company ordered the wider bogies needed to operate on standard gauge. By 1967, the Silverton Tramway Company had offered to build a standard gauge line for a <b>fixed</b> <b>sum,</b> and transfer the line to New South Wales soon after. This line would have run from Cockburn to Broken Hill on an alignment that had some interaction with the existing Crystal Street station, but the Commonwealth Government rejected it as it wished for the line to be built on a new alignment.|$|E

The Laurium silver mines, which were the property of the state, were usually leased for a <b>fixed</b> <b>sum</b> and a percentage on the working. Towards the end of the fifth century the output fell, partly owing to the Spartan occupation of Decelea. But the mines continued to be worked, though Strabo records that in his time the tailings were being worked over, and Pausanias speaks of the mines as a thing of the past. The ancient workings, consisting of shafts and galleries for excavating the ore, and washing tables for extracting the metal, may still be seen. Theophrastus wrote a separate work On Mining, which like most of his writings is a lost work.|$|E
25|$|Although Thomas Le Fanu {{tried to}} live {{as though he were}} well-off, the family was in {{constant}} financial difficulty. Thomas took the rectorships in the south of Ireland for the money, as they provided a decent living through tithes. However, from 1830, as the result of agitation against the tithes, this income began to fall and it ceased entirely two years later. In 1838 the government instituted a scheme of paying rectors a <b>fixed</b> <b>sum,</b> but in the interim the Dean had little besides rent on some small properties he had inherited. In 1833 Thomas had to borrow £100 from his cousin Captain Dobbins (who himself ended up in the debtors' prison a few years later) to visit his dying sister in Bath, who was also deeply in debt over her medical bills. At his death Thomas had almost nothing to leave to his sons and the family had to sell his library to pay off some of his debts. His widow went to stay with the younger son William.|$|E

40|$|Diamond's {{assembly}} rules {{predict that}} competitive interaction between species {{lead to a}} non-random co-occurrence of patterns. Earthworms were sampled in five lawns of Roosevelt Avenue (city of Brussels, Belgium) to test the reduced level of co-occurrence of species among earthworm communities. We used null model to generate patterns expected {{in the absence of}} species interactions. With the model algorithm that maintains <b>fixed</b> row <b>sums</b> and <b>fixed</b> column <b>sums,</b> species co-occurrence in two out of five islets (5  and 10), was less than the expected; whereas in islets 3, 8 and 9, species assemblage seemed random. This study indicates that the non-random selection observed in the two lawns is because there is an interaction between species close to the same ecological category. © 2006.
