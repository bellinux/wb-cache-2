40|$|A {{test setup}} {{consisting}} of a shock-tube with an instrumented short rod is developed for investigating the blast response of cellular concrete foams. In the shock tube facility, blast pressure wave is generated by the rupture of a notched Aluminum membrane. An <b>instrumented</b> <b>rod</b> is calibrated for measuring transmitted stress from the cellular foam. Experiments are conducted on brittle cellular concrete foam, which exhibits non-linear stress-strain behavior associated with crushing of the cellular structure and subsequent densification. Crushing is initiated when the stress exceeds the crushing strength and continued crushing produces an upward concave stress-strain curve leading to densification of the material. Foams with two different crushing strengths are evaluated. The influence of length of the foam is investigated. For an applied blast pressure amplitude which {{is higher than the}} crushing strength of foam, the wave structure in the foam consists of an elastic precursor wave followed by a compaction front which produces crushing of the cellular structure of the material. From the experimental investigation, the existence of a critical length for completely attenuating the applied blast pressure wave is established. For a given blast pressure loading, when the length of foam is larger the critical length, the applied blast pressure wave is transmitted as a rectangular pulse of nominally constant magnitude, which is slightly higher than the crushing strength of the foam. The foam is compacted without significant densification. The critical length depends on the crushing strength of the foam and the blast pressure amplitude and duration. If the length of foam is smaller than the critical length, there is an enhancement in the transmitted stress amplitude. If the length of foam is significantly smaller than the critical length, the transmitted stress is enhanced to a magnitude higher than the applied blast pressure amplitude and the compaction of foam leads to significant densification of the material...|$|E
40|$|Grid-To-Rod-Fretting (GTRF) in PWR fuel {{assemblies}} is a {{major issue}} of concern to vendors and utilities. Instantaneous pressure fluctuations on a fuel rod surface can help characterize the GTRF potential within a fuel bundle. As part of a collaboration with Westinghouse Electric Company, instantaneous pressure was collected experimentally at Texas A&M using pressure transducers installed within an <b>instrumented</b> <b>rod.</b> In addition, a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation was generated at the Westinghouse Fuel Fabrication Facility in Columbia, SC using a uniform velocity inlet condition. The simulation was repeated at Texas A&M with a non-uniform velocity inlet condition to determine {{the validity of the}} uniform inlet velocity assumption. The results from both simulations were used to compare with the experimental measurements. Instantaneous pressure obtained from CFD agreed with the experimental data within 10 %. The trend of the pressure evolution along the axial direction showed a maximum increase at 1. 4 hydraulic diameters from the grid. Measurements and simulation results were compared at 5 different azimuthal orientations and 8 axial elevations. Further testing and more robust simulations will be needed to determine if the two results could agree with less than 10 % difference. Through this analysis, it was discovered that the non-uniform inlet velocity condition yields different results than the constant velocity condition. On average, both simulations produced the theoretically expected number of vortices per subchannel, however, more cross flow was observed in non-uniform velocity inlet simulation throughout the axial domain than the first simulation. In this study, the flow appears to retain memory of the inlet boundary condition well after the turbulent effects from the mixing vanes begin to dissipate. This implies that defining the inlet velocity properly is vital for this type of problem. Additionally, velocity vectors from the two CFD simulations were reduced to the resolution of experimental PIV measurements. The purpose was to prove that reducing vector field resolution does not lose meaningful data. Through side-by-side comparison, it was determined that this process does not remove the pertinent flow structures and will provide a means to benchmark PIV results to CFD using the same resolution...|$|E

Com esses métodos pode-se determinar a eficiência do ensaio SPT, que é uma importante característica utilizada nas análises dos resultados do ensaio. As quantidades de energia envolvidas no ensaio SPT são determinadas através do método EFV.

A distractible, or ‘growing rod,’ implant construct {{that is more}} flexible than current metal rod systems may sufficiently correct curves in small children and reduce complications due to biomechanical factors. The purpose of this pilot {{study was to determine}} ranges of motion (ROM) after implantation of simulated growing rod constructs with a range of clinically relevant structural properties. The hypothesis was that ROM of spines <b>instrumented</b> with polymer <b>rods</b> would be greater than conventional metal rods and lower than non-instrumented controls. Methods Biomechanical tests were conducted on six thoracic spines from skeletally immature domestic swines (35 – 40  kg). Paired pedicle screws were used as anchors at proximal and distal levels. Specimens were tested under the following conditions: control, then dual rods of polyetheretherketone (PEEK) (diameter 6. 25  mm), titanium (4  mm), and cobalt-chrome alloy (CoCr) (5  mm). Lateral bending (LB) and flexion-extension (FE) moments were applied, and vertebral rotations were measured. Differences were determined by two-tailed t-tests and Bonferroni for four primary comparisons: PEEK vs control and PEEK vs CoCr, in LB and FE (α[*]=[*] 0. 05 / 4). Results In LB, ROM of spine segments after <b>instrumenting</b> with PEEK <b>rods</b> was lower than the non-instrumented control condition at each instrumented level. ROM was greater with PEEK rods than with Ti and CoCr <b>rods</b> at every <b>instrumented</b> level. Combining treated levels, in LB, ROM for PEEK rods was 35  % of control (p[*]<[*] 0. 0001) and 270  % of CoCr rods (p[*]<[*] 0. 01). In FE, ROM with PEEK was 27  % of control (p[*]<[*] 0. 001) and 180  % of CoCr (p[*]<[*] 0. 01). At proximal and distal adjacent non-instrumented levels in FE, mean ROM was lower for PEEK than for either metal. Conclusions PEEK rods increased flexibility versus metal rods, and decreased flexibility versus non-instrumented controls, both over the entire instrumented segment and at each individual level. Smaller mean increases in ROM at proximal and distal adjacent motion segments occurred with PEEK compared to metal rods, which may help decrease complications, such as junctional kyphosis.

40|$|The {{ankle joint}} is often {{affected}} by arthritis, giving a joint that is painful, stiff, and restricts movement. This {{can result in}} a huge loss of mobility for the sufferer. Unlike replacement of the hip, the replacement of a diseased ankle joint is not as straightforward and the outcomes do not reach the same success levels. The preferred surgical choice is arthrodesis, a procedure whereby the two bones forming the joint are fused together to eliminate the joint and hence pain. The success of the procedure is dependent upon several factors, two of the most significant being the levels of contact area and pressure achieved during the compression period, during which bone growth occurs across the two bones being compressed together. These factors influence joint stability and micromotion at the bone to bone interface during this growth phase. This study investigates the levels of contact areas and pressures that can be achieved for different arthodesis variables. These variables include the joint shape, which can be curved or flat, and the position of the compression pin within the talus, namely anteriorly or centrally positioned with reference to the talar dome. Influence of the Achilles tendon in joint stability is also investigated. A test rig was developed allowing load/deflection curves to be determined for various configurations of these variables. Models representing the bones under consideration, together with pressure sensitive film, allowed measurement of contact areas and pressures within the joint under compression, achieved using pins and <b>instrumented</b> compression <b>rods.</b> Results indicate there is little significant variation in contact area and pressure for the different shaped joint cuts, however, if the talar pin is placed in a more anterior position then the contact area can be improved over a centrally positioned pin. Anterior pin placement also gives increased resistance to motion and mechanical stability. It has been established that the athrodesis construct is especially weak in terms of rotation about the tibial axis, and the results from this study indicate that {{through the use of a}} curved joint shape the resistance to this motion can be improved greatly...|$|R
40|$|Background Context Corrective {{surgery for}} {{adolescent}} idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) leads to vertical growth arrest of the instrumented spine. This might {{be offset by}} the immediate gain in spinal height (SH) {{as a result of}} correction of the curvature. Purpose This study aimed to identify predictors of gain in SH following corrective surgery for AIS. We present a unique model to predict postoperative height prior to intervention, which could contribute to the preoperative counseling and consenting process. Study Design This was a retrospective case series. All surgeries were performed by one of four substantive pediatric spinal surgeons within a single regional center over a 3. 5 -year period. Patient Sample There were 104 patients who had instrumented posterior spinal fusion for AIS included. There were 93 females, and the age range was from 11 to 17 years. All patients had posterior <b>instrumented</b> fusion using <b>rods</b> and anchors (pedicle screws±hooks). Outcome Measures Postoperative SH was the primary outcome measure. The SH (C 7 –L 5) and Cobb angles were measured from a pre- and postoperative standing X-ray of each patient. Methods Variables associated with patients (demographic and radiological) and the surgical constructs were analyzed for predictability of height gain. A model was derived including only significant predictors of substantive importance using hierarchical regression methods. Cross-validation procedures verified the adequacy of the model fit. Analysis was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows version 20. 0 (IBM Corp. Armonk, NY, USA). Results The major curve was thoracic in 90...|$|R
