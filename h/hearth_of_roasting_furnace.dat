40|$|The mobility, {{bioavailability}} and {{toxicity of}} mercury {{in the environment}} strongly depend on the chemical species {{in which it is}} present in soil, sediments, water or air. In mining districts, differences in mobility and bioavailability of mercury mainly arise from the different type of mineralization and ore processing. In this work, synchrotron-based X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) has been taken advantage of to study the speciation of mercury in geological samples from three of the largest European mercury mining districts: Almadén (Spain), Idria (Slovenia) and Asturias (Spain). XANES has been complemented with a single extraction protocol for the determination of Hg mobility. Ore, calcines, dump material, soil, sediment and suspended particles from the three sites have been considered in the study. In the three sites, rather insoluble sulfide compounds (cinnabar and metacinnabar) were found to predominate. Minor amounts of more soluble mercury compounds (chlorides and sulfates) were also identified in some samples. Single extraction procedures have put forward a strong dependence of the mobility with the concentration of chlorides and sulfates. Differences in efficiency <b>of</b> <b>roasting</b> <b>furnaces</b> from the three sites have been found...|$|R

50|$|The gold-bearing ore became scarcer {{the deeper}} the miners went and work {{underground}} diminished while the tailings were reprocessed. The {{owners of the}} mine then decided to prospect within the existing shafts for new veins of gold-bearing rocks. In 1905 a new offshoot vein was discovered {{at a level of}} 2,050 feet in the number 5 shaft. A horizontal shaft was dug to follow this vein. By this time the Congress Shaft had reached a depth of 4,000 feet with a few of the other shafts passing the 3,000 foot level.By 1906, with the discovery of new veins, the Congress Mine was again in full production. The ore near the 4,000 foot depth was reported to be richer than the veins at the lesser depths. At this time equipment included 12 hoists with steam engines ranging from 20 to 200 horsepower, a reduction plant with an 80 stamp mill, a new concentrating plant, a cyanide plant consisting <b>of</b> a <b>roasting</b> <b>furnace</b> and seven 90-ton leaching tanks and three 200-ton leaching tanks for non roasted ore.|$|R

The furnaces fed in pairs into two chimneys via brick and stone flues, interconnected with a cross flue between each pair. The furnace bases have flat floors that {{appear to have been}} 2 metres wide internally, with arched roofs about 1.5 metres high, and the floors step up towards the flue-end by one course of brick every 3 metres. There are vaulted tunnels/boxes under two of the furnaces about 2 metres from the end opposite the flues, but there are no apparent fireboxes. The furnace bricks are not firebricks, and there is no vitrification or slag deposit in them, suggesting they were used for roasting rather than smelting.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Increasing {{efficiency}} {{is a necessary}} target for an industrial roaster nowadays. This thesis presents some studies on efficiency improvement in the zinc roasting process - process characterisation, control design, implementation and testing. The thesis focuses on the roaster, i. e. on research regarding the phenomena in the roaster furnace. By {{learning more about the}} roasting mechanism, particle size growth and dynamics of the furnace, new control implementations have been developed. More measurements, analyses and calculated variables have been added to give more information {{on the state of the}} furnace. New control variables have been introduced to give the operators more opportunities to set the conditions so that they are more suitable for the actual concentrate feed mixture. Equipment modifications have also been done. In this research, both laboratory and plant experiments have been performed together with thermodynamic evaluations and calculations. It has been necessary to make plant trials in order to obtain information about the impacts of different variables on the process. Only full-scale experiments give reliable results of the behaviour of an industrial furnace. The experiments with the roaster furnace have emphasised the study of both the metallurgy and the dynamics <b>of</b> the <b>roasting</b> process. The on-line calculated oxygen coefficient and its active control have proved important. The particle size distribution analysis of the furnace calcine has been shown to be a significant source of information for evaluating the state <b>of</b> the <b>roasting</b> <b>furnace.</b> The main target is to improve the economic performance. The key is to be able to be flexible in using different kinds of raw materials, because the main income is the treatment charge. The trend is that concentrates are becoming finer, which increases the challenges for roaster furnace control. The capability to use low-grade concentrates is also a major challenge and improves the economic result. Research and development on the boiler and mercury removal has also been part of this work for many reasons. Improved boiler performance and mercury removal gives more freedom in choosing concentrates and operating the roaster furnace. The approach has been the same as in the roaster furnace research and development work. Control improvements based on existing knowledge, such as fuzzy control systems for controlling the furnace temperature and mercury removal, did stabilize the process, but they did not solve all the problems regarding process stability. The research and development concept of this thesis has provided the extra knowledge needed for further improvement of process control. The results of the process characterisation have led to the implementation of a new and effective control strategy. The research and development carried out has improved performance in a number of ways: increased running time of the furnace and boiler, in-depth knowledge <b>of</b> <b>roasting</b> phenomena which led to new control methods and instructions for the operators, improved quality of sulphuric acid and a method to control its quality, measurements and analyses that give valuable information of the state of the process – all of which are now in use. In the future, the emphasis will be placed on the research and development of roaster furnace performance, which will be a great challenge. Control of the roaster furnace is the key to the economic success <b>of</b> the <b>roasting</b> process and more information about these phenomena is needed for improving and optimising control...|$|R

50|$|The {{recovered}} ore {{also has}} drawbacks. The carbonate ore {{is more difficult}} to smelt than a haematite or other oxide ore.

Developments <b>of</b> specific techniques to deal with these ores began in the early 19th century, largely with the work of Sir Thomas Lethbridge in Somerset. His 'Iron Mill' of 1838 used a three-chambered concentric <b>roasting</b> <b>furnace,</b> before passing the ore to a separate reducing furnace for smelting. Details of this Mill were the invention of Charles Sanderson, a steel maker of Sheffield, who held the patent for it.|$|R
