5|$|During the trial, the {{defendant}} Wiens appeared reserved but was noted for extreme statements. He said that Muslims were monsters to <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> the court {{why they were}} not deported after the 9/11 attacks. He stated that German people should not mingle with foreigners and declared that he would vote for the far right National Democratic Party of Germany. The judge then requested a verbatim record, while the defence counsel tried to mediate. Wiens continued in this fashion, prompting the judge to ask whether he had ever visited a concentration camp.|$|E
5|$|Gabriel Slaughter was the {{favorite}} choice {{for governor of}} Kentucky in 1812. Only one impediment to his potential candidacy existed. Growing tensions between the United States, France, and Great Britain threatened to break into open war. With this prospect looming, Isaac Shelby's name began circulating as a possible candidate for governor. Slaughter, who lived near Shelby, visited <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> whether he would run. Shelby assured {{him that he had}} no desire to do so unless a national emergency that required his leadership emerged. Satisfied with this answer, Slaughter began his campaign.|$|E
5|$|However, in {{the course}} of the speeches {{opposing}} the resolution, Johnston felt Lee's memory had been attacked and he felt duty bound to defend him. The Democratic Party, knowing his views and that of his state, approached <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> him to keep silent for the sake of the party and the relief of Virginia. Johnston correctly predicted that he would be attacked at home. He was up for re-election, and the opposing candidates used his position against him. A delegation from the Virginia General Assembly travelled to Washington to talk with the Democrats and assess the situation and were satisfied by the reports they received.|$|E

5|$|The Glebe's {{profits were}} barely enough for Breckinridge's growing family. His legal career {{provided}} {{enough money for}} some comforts but required long hours and difficult work. Patrick Henry regularly represented clients opposite Breckinridge, and John Marshall both referred clients to <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> him to represent his own clients in his absence. Though still interested in politics, Breckinridge refused to campaign for the people's support. He believed changes were needed to the Articles of Confederation and agreed {{with much of the}} proposed U.S. constitution, but he did not support equal representation of the states in the Senate nor the federal judiciary. Heeding the advice of his brother James and his friend, Archibald Stuart, he did not seek election as a delegate to Virginia's ratification convention.|$|E
5|$|In the House, {{desultory}} {{debate on}} Fraser's censure motion ended with it being amended by the ALP majority into a condemnation of Fraser and passed on a party line vote. By 2.34pm, when Fraser rose {{and announced that}} he had been commissioned as Prime Minister, word of the dismissal had spread through the House. Fraser announced his intent to advise a double dissolution, and moved that the House adjourn. His motion was defeated. Fraser's new government suffered repeated defeats in the House, which passed a motion of no confidence in <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> the Speaker, Gordon Scholes, to urge the Governor-General to recommission Whitlam. Scholes, attempting to communicate this to the Governor General, was initially told that an appointment might not be possible that day, but after stating that he would reconvene the House and tell them of the refusal, was given an appointment with Kerr for 4.45pm.|$|E
5|$|Faced with a numerically superior, {{but less}} {{experienced}} enemy, the Company assumed a defensive position, {{taking care to}} select a battleground that favoured them. They chose a naturally strong position, protected by a swamp which, according to Gregoras, they further enhanced by digging trenches and inundating them with water diverted from the nearby river. The Catalans themselves took up positions on dry ground behind the swamp, arranging themselves in a solid line, but the sources give no further details as to their exact disposition. The Athenian army {{on the other hand}} assembled at Lamia. On 10 March 1311, Walter of Brienne composed his testament there and led his army forth. On the eve of battle, the 500 Catalans in the Duke's service, stricken by conscience, went to <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> for leave to rejoin their old comrades-in-arms, saying that they would rather die than fight against them. Walter reportedly gave them permission to leave, replying that they were welcome to die with the others. At the same time, however, the Catalans' Turkish auxiliaries took up a separate position nearby, thinking the quarrel was a pretext arranged by the Company and the Duke of Athens to exterminate them.|$|E

After accepting modest donations, Harsukh Rai declared the temple to be panchayati (i.e. belonging to the community, rather than himself) and finished the construction.|$|E
25|$|One of the Africans, named Lewis, {{was not a}} captive, but {{had been}} hired as an {{interpreter}} by the captain of Guerrero. Lewis had been to Havana {{on at least one}} earlier slave ship.

25|$|The Shrine of Nostra Signora della Guardia {{located on}} top of Monte Figogna near Genoa, Italy, {{is located on the}} site of a {{reported}} 1490 apparition to Italian peasant Benedetto Pareto.

25|$|In the February 1951 {{legislative}} election, {{the first}} general election {{to be held}} under universal franchise in colonial Africa, the CPP was elected in a landslide.

Arden-Clarke saw that the only alternative to Nkrumah's freedom {{was the end of}} the constitutional experiment. Nkrumah was released from prison on 12 February, receiving a rapturous reception from his followers.

According to Baldetti, this was the first time that they had traveled abroad together and that it was her who told her now-former private secretary about the investigation against <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> him to resign.
