5|$|The {{prefrontal cortex}} plays a {{significant}} role in mediating executive functions. Neuroimaging during neuropsychological tests of executive function, such as the stroop test and working memory tests, have found that cortical maturation of the prefrontal cortex correlates with executive function in children. Planning involves activation of the <b>dorsolateral</b> <b>prefrontal</b> <b>cortex</b> (DLPFC), anterior cingulate cortex, angular prefrontal cortex, right prefrontal cortex, and supramarginal gyrus. Working memory manipulation involves the DLPFC, inferior frontal gyrus, and areas of the parietal cortex. Inhibitory control involves multiple areas of the prefrontal cortex as well as the caudate nucleus and subthalamic nucleus.In conditions in which prepotent responses tend to dominate behavior, such as in drug addiction, where drug cues can elicit drug seeking (Chapter 15), or in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; described below), significant negative consequences can result.... ADHD can be conceptualized as a disorder of executive function; specifically, ADHD is characterized by reduced ability to exert and maintain cognitive control of behavior. Compared with healthy individuals, those with ADHD have diminished ability to suppress inappropriate prepotent responses to stimuli (impaired response inhibition) and diminished ability to inhibit responses to irrelevant stimuli (impaired interference suppression).... Functional neuroimaging in humans demonstrates activation of the prefrontal cortex and caudate nucleus (part of the striatum) in tasks that demand inhibitory control of behavior.... Early results with structural MRI show thinning of the cerebral cortex in ADHD subjects compared with age-matched controls in prefrontal cortex and posterior parietal cortex, areas involved in working memory and attention.}} Task shifting doesn't involve specific regions of the brain, but instead involves multiple regions of the prefrontal cortex and parietal lobe.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, {{research}} {{has suggested that}} left <b>dorsolateral</b> <b>prefrontal</b> <b>cortex</b> activation during a Stroop task is related to an individual's’ expectation regarding the conflicting nature of the upcoming trial, and not so much on the conflict itself. Conversely, the right <b>dorsolateral</b> <b>prefrontal</b> <b>cortex</b> aims to reduce the attentional conflict and is activated after the conflict is over.|$|E
25|$|Brain imaging {{techniques}} including {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI), {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI), and positron emission tomography (PET) have shown that there are two main areas in the brain that are involved in the processing of the Stroop task. They are the anterior cingulate cortex, and the <b>dorsolateral</b> <b>prefrontal</b> <b>cortex.</b> More specifically, while both are activated when resolving conflicts and catching errors, the <b>dorsolateral</b> <b>prefrontal</b> <b>cortex</b> assists in memory and other executive functions, while the anterior cingulate cortex is used to select an appropriate response and allocate attentional resources.|$|E

40|$|Repetitive {{transcranial}} magnetic stimulation (TMS) can {{be directly}} {{used to test the}} prediction of the hemispheric encoding retrieval asymmetry (HERA) model—that is, neural activity of <b>prefrontal</b> <b>cortex</b> during an episodic memory task is asymmetric. This chapter clarifies the role of the <b>dorsolateral</b> <b>prefrontal</b> <b>cortex(s)</b> (DLPFC) during encoding and retrieval memory process using TMS technique. The chapter also evaluates possible changes in the hemispheric pattern of lateralization related to the verbal or non-verbal nature of the material and to its novelty. Two recognition memory studies with pictures and word pairs are performed. The implementation of the same experimental design for both types of memoranda allows to better disentangle the role of the attributes of the presented material on the functional lateralization of <b>prefrontal</b> <b>cortex</b> (PFC) involvements, by measuring individual behavioral performances, during episodic memory tasks...|$|R

25|$|In {{those not}} so emotionally {{affected}} by reminders of their loss, studies of fMRI scans {{have been used}} to conclude that there is a high functional connectivity between the <b>dorsolateral</b> <b>prefrontal</b> <b>cortex</b> and amygdala activity, suggesting that the former regulates activity in the latter. In those people who had greater intensity of sadness, there was a low functional connection between the rostal anterior cingulate cortex and amygdala activity, suggesting a lack of regulation of the former part of the brain upon the latter.|$|E
25|$|Among {{those persons}} who have been {{bereaved}} within the previous three months of a given report, those who report many intrusive thoughts about the deceased show ventral amygdala and rostral anterior cingulate cortex hyperactivity to reminders of their loss. In {{the case of the}} amygdala, this links to their sadness intensity. In those individuals who avoid such thoughts, there is a related opposite type of pattern {{in which there is a}} decrease in the activation of the dorsal amgydala and the <b>dorsolateral</b> <b>prefrontal</b> <b>cortex.</b>|$|E
25|$|TOT {{states should}} be {{separated}} from FOK (feeling of knowing) states. FOK, in contrast, is the feeling that one {{will be able to}} recognize - from a list of items - an item that is currently inaccessible. There are still currently opposing articles of the separability of the process underlying these concepts. However, {{there is some evidence that}} TOTs and FOKs draw on different parts of the brain. TOTs are associated with the anterior cingulate, right <b>dorsolateral</b> <b>prefrontal</b> <b>cortex,</b> and right inferior cortex while FOKs are not.|$|E
25|$|With {{substantial}} cognitive load, fMRI signals {{indicate a}} common network of frontal, parietal and occipital cortices, thalamus, and the cerebellum. This observation suggests that executive function is mediated by dynamic and flexible networks that are characterized using functional integration and effective connectivity analyses. The complete circuit underlying executive function includes both {{a direct and}} an indirect circuit. The neural circuit responsible for executive functioning is, in fact, located primarily in the frontal lobe. This main circuit originates in the <b>dorsolateral</b> <b>prefrontal</b> cortex/orbitofrontal <b>cortex</b> and then projects through the striatum and thalamus {{to return to the}} <b>prefrontal</b> <b>cortex.</b>|$|R

We evaluated young drug-naive ADHD outpatients without MRI structural abnormalities to detect <b>prefrontal</b> <b>cortex</b> regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) functional dysregulation; correlation between age and rCBF; and correlation between symptoms profile and rCBF. Functional brain activities (i. e. rCBF), neuropsychological attention performance and symptom profile were evaluated respectively by single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) scan, Stroop Test and the Child Attention Problem Rating Scale. There was a decreased rCBF in the left dorso lateral <b>prefrontal</b> <b>cortex</b> (DLPFC) compared to the right DLPFC of the subjects. In addition, there were positive correlations between age and relative rCBFs of the <b>dorsolateral</b> and orbital <b>prefrontal</b> <b>cortex,</b> and negative correlations between age and absolute rCBFs of the <b>dorsolateral</b> and orbital <b>prefrontal</b> <b>cortex.</b> Finally, higher levels of right relative rCBF {{and lower levels of}} left relative rCBF were predictors of higher severity of clinical symptom expression and neuropsychological attention impairment. The results of this study highlight the role of the DLPFC blood flow impairment in the pathogenesis of ADHD even in young subjects without structural abnormalities...|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{the neural}} {{correlates}} of change detectionvs change blindness {{have been investigated}} using fMRI. Results revealed that conscious perception of change is associatedwith enhanced activity in a neural network comprising the parietal (bilateral) and right <b>dorsolateral</b> <b>prefrontal</b> (DLPF) <b>cortex.</b> Here, by means of repetitive transcranialmagnetic stimulation (rTMS), we unveil the causal role of the right DLPF cortex in perceiving changes. When rTMS was applied to this area, change perceptionwas impaired as compared to leftDLPF rTMS and sham stimulation. This result is important as it shows, for the ¢rst time, that conscious change perception is associated with normal activity in the right DLPF cortex. Our ¢ndings are in agreement with a recent view emphasizing the role of frontal areas, in addition to classical ventral and dorsal pathways, in visual awarenes...|$|R
25|$|Work in {{the field}} of {{cognitive}} neuroscience has located classical language areas within the perislyvian cortex of the left hemisphere. This area is crucial for the representation of language, but other areas in the brain are shown to be active in this function as well. Language-related activation occurs in the middle and inferior temporal gyri, the temporal pole, the fusiform gyri, the lingula, in the middle prefrontal areas (i.e. <b>dorsolateral</b> <b>prefrontal</b> <b>cortex),</b> and in the insula. There also appears to be activation in the right hemisphere during most language tasks.|$|E
25|$|In {{most cases}} of {{executive}} dysfunction, deficits {{are attributed to}} either frontal lobe damage or dysfunction, or to disruption in fronto-subcortical connectivity. Neuroimaging with PET and fMRI has confirmed the relationship between executive function and functional frontal pathology. Neuroimaging studies have also suggested that some constituent functions are not discretely localized in prefrontal regions. Functional imaging studies using different tests of executive function have implicated the <b>dorsolateral</b> <b>prefrontal</b> <b>cortex</b> {{to be the primary}} site of cortical activation during these tasks. In addition, PET studies of patients with Parkinson’s disease have suggested that tests of executive function are associated with abnormal function in the globus pallidus and appear to be the genuine result of basal ganglia damage.|$|E
25|$|Bipolar {{disorder}} is a mood disorder that {{is characterized by}} both highs (mania) and lows (depression) in mood. These changes in mood sometimes alternate rapidly (changes within days or weeks) and sometimes not so rapidly (within weeks or months). Current research provides strong evidence of cognitive impairments in individuals with bipolar disorder, particularly in executive function and verbal learning. Moreover, these cognitive deficits appear to be consistent cross-culturally, indicating that these impairments are characteristic of the disorder and not attributable to differences in cultural values, norms, or practice. Functional neuroimaging studies have implicated abnormalities in the <b>dorsolateral</b> <b>prefrontal</b> <b>cortex</b> and the anterior cingulate cortex as being volumetrically different in individuals with bipolar disorder.|$|E
40|$|Background: Several {{lines of}} {{evidence}} suggest dysfunction of the γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) ergic system in major depressive disorder. Neuroimaging studies report reduced levels of GABA in the <b>dorsolateral</b> <b>prefrontal</b> and occipital <b>cortex</b> of depressed patients. Our previous postmortem study re-vealed {{a reduction in}} the density and size of calbindin-immunoreactive (CB-IR) GABAergic neurons in the <b>prefrontal</b> <b>cortex</b> in major depressive disorder.

However, the neural basis of this phenomenon is not known. Here we show neuroimaging and neurostimulation evidence that the <b>dorsolateral</b> and anterior <b>prefrontal</b> <b>cortex</b> can operate on non-conscious information {{in a manner that}} goes beyond automatic forms of sensorimotor priming and which may support implicit working memory processes and higher-level cognitive function...|$|R

25|$|The first {{areas of}} the brain to be pruned are those {{involving}} primary functions, such as motor and sensory areas. The {{areas of the}} brain involved in more complex processes lose matter later in development. These include the lateral and prefrontal cortices, among other regions. Some of the most developmentally significant changes in the brain occur in the prefrontal cortex, which is involved in decision making and cognitive control, as well as other higher cognitive functions. During adolescence, myelination and synaptic pruning in the prefrontal cortex increases, improving the efficiency of information processing, and neural connections between the prefrontal cortex and other regions of the brain are strengthened. This leads to better evaluation of risks and rewards, as well as improved control over impulses. Specifically, developments in the <b>dorsolateral</b> <b>prefrontal</b> <b>cortex</b> are important for controlling impulses and planning ahead, while development in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex is important for decision making. Changes in the orbitofrontal cortex are important for evaluating rewards and risks.|$|E
25|$|Not much {{is known}} about the exact {{function}} of these areas in the tip-of-the-tongue phenomenon. The areas activated during TOT may vary depending {{on the nature of the}} target word. For example, if the target word is a person's name, the fusiform face area will likely show activation as the rememberer processes the person's face. Problems like this make it difficult to determine what areas are specifically implicated in TOT states, and which are a byproduct of other cognitive functions. However, some inferences can be made about the roles of these structures based on theories of their functions derived from other studies of these structures, unrelated to TOT. It is hypothesized that the anterior cingulate cortex and the right <b>dorsolateral</b> <b>prefrontal</b> <b>cortex</b> operate as a circuit to detect conflict, and may perform this role in detecting the conflict between the feeling of knowing the target word and the recall failure. The anterior cingulate cortex is also implicated in emotion and may show activation because of the emotional response to the tip of the tongue state. The posterior medial parietal cortex, bilateral lateral parietal cortex, and the bilateral superior prefrontal cortex are involved in retrieval and evaluation, and therefore may play a role in the metacognitive processes involved in the tip of the tongue phenomenon such as the evaluation of one's own knowledge and the probability of retrieval.|$|E

40|$|The <b>prefrontal</b> <b>cortex</b> shows {{structural}} and functional alterations in mood disorders. Retinoid signaling, {{brain-derived neurotrophic factor}} (BDNF), and its receptor TrkB are reported {{to be involved in}} depression. Here, we found that mRNA levels of key elements of retinoid signaling were significantly reduced in the postmortem <b>dorsolateral</b> <b>prefrontal</b> cortex/anterior cingulate <b>cortex</b> (ACC) from elderly depressed patients who did not die from suicide. Decreased mRNA levels of BDNF and TrkB isoforms were also found. Similar alterations were observed in rats subjected to chronic unpredictable mild stress. Along with neurons immunopositive for both retinoic acid receptor-α (RARα) and TrkB, a positive correlation between mRNA levels of the 2 receptors was found in the ACC of control subjects but not of depressed patients. In vitro studies showed that RARα was able to bind to and transactivate the TrkB promoter via a putative RA response element within the TrkB promoter. In conclusion, the retinoid and BDNF-TrkB signaling in the <b>prefrontal</b> <b>cortex</b> are compromised in mood disorders, and the transcriptional upregulation of TrkB by RARα provide a possible mechanism for their interaction. The retinoid signaling pathway that may activate TrkB expression will be an alternative novel target for BDNF-based antidepressant treatment...|$|R

The data demonstrate that the discrimination of pure stereo-optic disparity information takes place in the polar striate cortex and the neighboring peri-striate cortices, {{as well as in the}} parietal lobe, the <b>prefrontal</b> <b>cortex,</b> and the cerebellum. The discrimination of stereoscopic depth is dependent on a network composed of multiple functional fields localized in occipital- and parietal-lobe visual areas as well as in the <b>dorsolateral</b> and mesial <b>prefrontal</b> <b>cortex.</b> The findings support the importance of coactivated occipitoparietal visual areas in the processing and analysis of binocular depth information in humans...|$|R
