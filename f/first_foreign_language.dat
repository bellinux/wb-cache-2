25|$|Studies {{have been}} {{conducted}} in New Zealand, United States, Germany, Italy and Australia. The results of these studies were favorable and demonstrated that studying Esperanto before another foreign language expedites the acquisition of the other, natural language. This appears to be because learning subsequent foreign languages is easier than learning one's <b>first</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>language,</b> whereas {{the use of a}} grammatically simple and culturally flexible auxiliary language like Esperanto lessens the first-language learning hurdle. In one study, a group of European secondary school students studied Esperanto for one year, then French for three years, and ended up with a significantly better command of French than a control group, who studied French for all four years.|$|E
25|$|Learning {{a foreign}} {{language}} is compulsory throughout Germany in secondary schools and English {{is one of the}} more popular choices.

At which stage students begin learning {{a foreign language}} differs from state to state and is tailored according to the cultural and socio-economical dynamics of each state. In some states, foreign language education starts in the Grundschule (primary school). For example, in North Rhine-Westphalia, English starts in the third year of elementary school.

During the early post-war era (1947–1955), eight foreign language films received Special or Honorary Awards.

The <b>first</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>language</b> film honored with such an award was the Italian neorealist drama Shoeshine, whose citation read: [...] "the high quality of this motion picture, brought to eloquent life in a country scarred by war, is proof to the world that the creative spirit can triumph over adversity".

These awards, however, were handed out on a discretionary rather than a regular basis (no award was given at the 26th Academy Awards held in 1954), and were not competitive since there were no nominees but simply one winning film per year.|$|E
