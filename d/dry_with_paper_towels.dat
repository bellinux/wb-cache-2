40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the effect of omitting teat preparation prior to milking on the bacterial levels in milk directly after milking and after a period of milk storage. Eighty Holstein–Friesian dairy cows were assigned to two pre-milking teat preparation treatments: (i) washing of teats and drawing of foremilk, followed by <b>drying</b> <b>with</b> <b>paper</b> <b>towels</b> and (ii) no teat preparation. Individual cow measurements included individual quarter somatic cell count (SCC) and teat swabs for the presence of Bacillus cereus sensu lato. On seven monthly occasions, all milk produced over a 24 h period from each treatment group was segregated into a separate tank and sampled. Sub-samples of this milk were stored at 4 °C for 0, 24, 48 and 72 h, and the milk was analysed for total bacterial count (TBC), thermoduric bacterial count and the presence of B. cereus s. I. Individual quarter SCCs were numerically higher for unprepared teats (159, 000 cells/mL) compared with those for prepared teats (133, 000 cells/mL; P < 0. 09). A similar trend was observed for bulk tank SCC, with the unprepared teat treatment tending to have a higher SCC (155, 857 cells/mL) compared to the prepared teat treatment (102, 286 cells/mL; P< 0. 09). The TBC was not significantly higher from unprepared teats (3, 152 cfu/ mL) compared with milk from prepared teats (1, 678 cfu/mL) (P< 0. 10). Milk TBC was significantly higher after storage for 72 h compared with that after 0, 24 and 48 h (P< 0. 01). The results of this study indicate that under good hygienic conditions in an outdoor grazing situation, the omission of pre-milking teat preparation has a minimal effect on TBC and SCC...|$|R

Hand washing is something that helps {{prevent the spread of}} germs that lead to illness. This is a health problem that could anywhere and everywhere in the community, but I specifically looked into the Paducah-Murray regional campus. Photovoice is a process where members of a community take pictures that give some insight on what they believe are community needs and assets. The first photo I took was of a sign that explained when and how to wash your hands. It is hanging {{on the back of the}} bathroom door on campus. The second picture I took was of the black intercom that sits on the desks for students to hold down to be able to communicate with other students and the teacher at other campuses. In Paducah, and in most places, you will more than likely see signs in the bathrooms of different places reminding people to wash their hands. It is something you may see by sinks in a workplace, as well. I imagine preschool and elementary teachers are advocates of teaching this habit. It’s good to start introducing hand washing at an early age and how important it is. You can have them do creative things like singing, get fun shaped soaps, or foam soaps. With the older generation, it is best to get more serious, maybe by showing a documentary on the diseases that could happen. Hand washing is something that helps prevents sickness, stops the spread of germs, and by doing this one simple task, it will be beneficial in the long run. Doyle, E. I., Ward, S.

40|$|Statement of the Problem: Surface {{roughness}} is a {{key factor}} in the aesthetics of restorative dentistry as it can determine the clinical quality and success of restorative materials. The chemical process of dissolution in the presence of mechanical forces can accelerate the surface roughness of tooth-coloured restorative materials. Objectives: To determine the degree of surface roughness of a microhybrid and a nanohybrid resin composite after polishing and immersion in various solutions. Materials and Methods: Two resin composites were used : a microhybrid (Gradia direct, GC), and a nanohybrid (Ice, SDI). A total of 54 disc-shaped specimens were prepared for each composite and immersed in distilled water incubated at 37 °C for 24 hours. After 24 h, the baseline measurement for surface roughness (Ra) was performed and the specimens were divided into 3 groups of 18 and tested with unpolished or after polishing with Sof-Lex disc and Enhance point systems. Specimens in each group were subdivided into 3 subgroups (n = 6) and immersed in 3 solutions (distilled water, coffee, and cola) for 7 days incubated at 37 °C. After 7 days, the specimens were rinsed with tap water for 10 seconds, <b>dried</b> <b>with</b> <b>paper</b> <b>towel</b> and Ra was measured again. Two randomly selected specimens of each group were sputter coated with gold and examined using a Field-Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). Results: Gradia direct showed a greater Ra than ice in all solutions for all polishing systems (p < 0. 001). Specimens polished with Enhance point revealed a significantly greater roughness than Sof-Lex discs and both showed greater Ra than unpolished specimens. Specimens immersed in coffee exhibited significantly greater surface roughness than that of distilled water (p < 0. 05) and cola (p < 0. 001). Conclusions: Nano-hybrid composite showed a significantly smoother surface than microhybrid. Coffee exhibited the highest Ra compared to distilled water and cola.

Five farms containing dairy cattle were visited in January of 2012. In total, 100 cows of different ages, breeds and stages of lactation were examined in the present study. The cows were part of intensive or semi-intensive management systems and were submitted to mechanical milking or hand milking. The samples were collected after washing the vulvar region with water and soap, and then <b>drying</b> it <b>with</b> <b>paper</b> <b>towels</b> and disinfecting the area with alcohol (70 °GL). Vaginal mucous was collected using a sterile alginate cotton swab, which was rubbed on the vagina, as well as the lateral and internal walls. Vulvovaginal mucous samples were cultured in both liquid and solid modified Hayflick´s medium, for mycoplasmas, and UB medium, for ureaplasmas. The PCR assays for Mollicutesand Ureaplasmaspp. were performed according to the standard protocols described in the current literature. During isolation, the frequency of Mycoplasmaspp. was of 13. 0 % (13 / 100) and for Ureaplasmaspp. was of 6. 0 % (6 / 100). In the PCR assays the frequency of Mollicuteswas of 26. 0 % (26 / 100) and for Ureaplasmaspp. was of 13. 0 % (13 / 100) in the dairy cattle studied.

Weights and lengths were recorded followed by a count of lateral line scales to differentiate between longnose (C. catostomus) and white suckers (C. commersonii). After initial inspection, each fish was returned to the dissecting pan, an incision {{was made in the}} vent towards the head using stainless steel scissors to determine whether each fish was a gravid female, non-gravid female or male. From each of the 11 gravid females collected, ovaries, samples of skin, epaxial muscle and livers were removed and each positioned in individual weighing boats then placed in a Thelco model M drying cabinet at a temperature of 32  °C for 20  days. The wet to dry ratios of the 44 whole body homogenates averaged 0.267, a value close to the ratios of 0.284 for trout and 0.288 for non-game fishes reported by Fresquez and Ferenbaugh (1999). Therefore, all values of Se and Hg in the whole bodies of fish tissues are reported as wet weights by multiplying dry weights by a factor of 0.267. However, for the 44 individual tissues in the 11 gravid females, individual conversion factors were calculated for each ovary, skin, epaxial muscle and liver tissue. As an example of a conversion, the liver of the single gravid brown trout had a dry to wet conversion factor of 0.252.|$|R
40|$|A pele da teta é uma das principais fontes de contaminação microbiana do leite cru, além de ser uma fonte de infecção da glândula mamária. Este estudo comparou diferentes métodos de preparação do úbere, incluindo a participação do bezerro para estimular a descida do leite, em relação à contaminação microbiana da pele da teta. Um experimento com 36 vacas ordenhadas mecanicamente foi conduzido para comparar três procedimentos (A, B, C) de preparação do úbere. Duas tetas de cada vaca foram amostradas para contagem total de bactérias (CTB) e de coliformes, antes e após lavagem com água e secagem com papel toalha descartável (A); procedimento A, mais imersão das tetas em solução de iodo (4. 000 ppm) e secagem com papel toalha descartável (B); higienização com toalha de papel embebida em solução desinfetante contendo clorexidina (C). O segundo experimento incluiu 16 vacas ordenhadas manualmente, na presença do bezerro. Permitiu-se a cada bezerro mamar as quatro tetas por alguns segundos, de acordo com o manejo do rebanho. Amostras para bacteriologia de duas tetas de cada vaca foram coletadas, antes, após a mamada do bezerro, e após higienização semelhante ao procedimento C, citado acima. Os tratamentos foram analisados usando-se o teste não- paramétrico de Kruskal-Wallis, considerando-se os dados de tCTB após o uso de um dos métodos de preparação do úbere ou da mamada do bezerro. Usou-se a transformação das contagens bacterianas para a escala logarítmica em base 10, com a fórmula tCTB=log 10 (CTB+ 0, 5). Para os grupos A, B e C (primeiro experimento), os valores médios de diminuição de tCTB foram 1, 8, 2, 2 e 2, 4, respectivamente. No segundo experimento, as CTB's aumentaram significativamente (P The teat skin {{is one of}} {{the main}} sources of {{microbial}} contamination of raw milk as well as a source of mastitis infection. This study assessed the microbial load of the teat skin following the application of the different practices for preparing the udder, including the use of calf suckling to stimulate the letdown of milk. Thirty-six cows milked by machine were included in one experiment. Two teats of each cow were sampled for bacteriology before and after using one of three methods of udder preparation, as follows: rinsing <b>with</b> water and <b>drying</b> <b>with</b> single <b>paper</b> <b>towels</b> (A); method A plus pre-dipping with an iodine teat dip (4, 000 ppm) and <b>drying</b> <b>with</b> single <b>paper</b> <b>towels</b> (B); wiping teats using a commercial wet non-woven wipe pre-soaked with a solution containing chlorexidine (C). The second experiment included 16 cows milked by hand. The calf of each cow was allowed to suck the four teats for a few seconds, and then two teats per cow were sampled for bacteriology. Samples were collected before, after calf sucking and following teat pre-milking treatment (as for group C, above). Statistical analysis was conducted on transformed (log 10) data with tTBC=log 10 (TBC+ 0. 5) using a Kruskal-Wallis test. Each treatment was analysed considering the difference in tTBC after the use of either method of preparation of the udder or calf sucking. For groups A, B and C (first experiment), tTBC values were reduced 1. 8, 2. 2 and 2. 4, respectively. In the second experiment, tTBC increased significantly (P< 0, 05) after calf sucking (from 3. 2 to 4. 3). After disinfection the tTBC was significantly reduced to 2. 0. These results show that: (a) teat rinsing with water and wiping dry reduces the number of microorganisms on the teat skin, but the reduction is significantly higher when teats are disinfected; (b) calf sucking before milking increases significantly the number of microorganisms on teat skin; (c) the number of microorganisms on teat skin can be reduced more than 10 times after calf sucking if teats are disinfected. Very low numbers or no growth of coliforms were observed in all cases...|$|R

30|$|To {{assess the}} effect of Polysorbate 80 /Phospholipid mixed micelle {{formulation}} of DTX on tissue distribution, 72 female Kunming strain mice were randomly divided into two groups. The administration protocol of tissue distribution study was as same as that used in the pharmacokinetics. At 5, 15, 30 min, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 h after drug injection, each animal (n = 4 for each time point) was euthanized and heart, spleen lung, liver, kidney, uterus and ovaries, brain as well as blood samples were collected. Tissue samples were blotted <b>with</b> <b>paper</b> <b>towel,</b> rinsed in ice-cold saline, blotted to remove excess fluid, weighed, and stored at - 50 °C until required for analysis.|$|R
30|$|One-cell stadium {{zebrafish}} embryos were stringed at {{the edge}} of a microscope slide placed in a petri dish. Surplus water was removed <b>with</b> a <b>paper</b> <b>towel</b> such that the eggs were immobilized during the injection procedure. Per treatment between 40 and 60 eggs was consistently injected with triolein, DMSO, methanol, or autoclaved water, into the yolk. Each treatment was tested in triplicate.|$|R
30|$|Two {{kinds of}} gelatin were used: reagent-grade gelatin (Wako Pure Chemicals Ind., Ltd.) for the {{preliminary}} experiments and regenerative medicine-grade gelatin (RM- 100, Jellice Co., Ltd.) {{for the final}} experiments. Porous β-TCP scaffolds were immersed in aqueous solutions containing 0.5, 1.0, or 2.0 mass% gelatin for 30  s, taken out, and the redundant solution was removed by wiping the blocks <b>with</b> <b>paper</b> <b>towels.</b> The β-TCP blocks bearing gelatin solutions were cooled in a refrigerator at 253  K overnight and then dried at room temperature in a vacuum. The dried, gelatin-coated β-TCP scaffolds were subjected to heat treatments in a vacuum to obtain cross-linked gelatin. The cross-linking temperatures were 373, 393, 413, and 433  K, and the duration was 12  h.|$|R
30|$|Dried shrimp {{crackers}} {{were obtained}} from a local market in Songkhla, Thailand. They had an average diameter of 5  mm with thickness of 1.5  mm. Crackers were fried using an electric deep fryer containing 4  L of frying oil. Palm oil used as a frying medium was preheated to 180  °C before frying. Samples {{were placed in the}} frying basket and immersed into the oil for 30  s until samples are completely puffed. Thereafter, fried samples were placed on the screen to drain the oil for 5  min. The fried shrimp cracker was blotted <b>with</b> <b>paper</b> <b>towels</b> to remove an excess oil on the surface and allowed to cool at room temperature (26 – 28  °C), approximately 15  min before being packaged.|$|R
