The scope of <b>drug</b> <b>epidemiology</b> is defined and attention is drawn to the current dearth of scholarship and lack of specific guidelines on the ethical issues raised by such research. The importance of ethics in <b>drug</b> <b>epidemiology</b> is explained and it is argued that a guiding framework would be helpful in promoting an understanding of some of the prominent ethical challenges in this field (for example, obtaining free and informed consent to participation, the use of inducements to recruit subjects, the protection of interviewees from violations of privacy and the risk of prosecution, and the safety of field research staff). The traditional principles of biomedical ethics are outlined and their limitations in enabling an understanding of ethical issues in <b>drug</b> <b>epidemiology</b> are considered. The utility of practical case-based approaches to ethical analysis is also discussed. The article concludes with broad recommendations for an ethical framework for <b>drug</b> <b>epidemiology</b> that can be refined in further discussion on those important issues...|$|E

The aim {{of this paper is}} to discuss various aspects of study design, particularly those issues that are not easily found in either textbooks or review papers. We have also compared and contrasted <b>drug</b> <b>epidemiology</b> with the randomized controlled trial (RCT) wherever possible. <b>Drug</b> <b>epidemiology</b> is especially useful in the many situations where the RCT is not suitable, or even possible. The study base has to be defined before the appropriate cohort of subjects is assembled. If all of the cases are identified, then a referent sample of controls may be assembled by random sampling of the study base. If all of the cases cannot be assembled, a hypothetical secondary base may need to be created. Preferably, only new-users of the drug should be included, and the risk-ratio will be different for acute users and chronic users. Studies will usually only be possible when researching the unintended effects of drugs. It is difficult to study efficacy because of confounding by indication. In occasional circumstances it may be possible to study efficacy (examples are given). Discussion of the dangers of designing with generalisability in mind is provided. Additionally, the similarities in study design between <b>drug</b> <b>epidemiology</b> and the RCT are discussed in detail, as well as the design-characteristics that cannot be shared between the two methods...|$|E

40|$|This Guide to <b>Drug</b> Abuse <b>Epidemiology</b> is {{the product}} of a {{collaboration}} between the World Health Organization (WHO), the United States National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) and substance use epidemiology and other experts from more than twenty countries. It has been produced in response to the need for valid, reliable and timely information on the prevalence, trends, and patterns of drug use related problems. This information is needed for planning, implementing and evaluating, effective prevention, treatment, policy response and other interventions for substance use related problems. Since the 1980 s there have been major changes in trends and patterns of drug use including: global increases in the production and use of drugs; new forms of old drugs (eg. smokeable Acrack@ cocaine); changes in way drugs are taken (eg. transitions from opium smoking to heroin injection); and the introduction and proliferation of new drugs (eg. MDMA Aecstasy@ and other amphetamine-type stimulants). Of particular importance is the fact that drug injection has become a major transmission route for HIV. These changes have presented new challenges to public health. These challenges are being met by scientific advances in <b>drug</b> abuse <b>epidemiology,</b> including: improved techniques to assess the extent of drug related behaviours and problems; and the introduction and development of methods which aim to understand drug using behaviours as much as measure them.

40|$|The present article {{traces the}} {{evolution}} of <b>drug</b> <b>epidemiology</b> in Europe from the 1960 s to the present {{within the context of}} changing perceptions of the drug phe-nomenon and changing information needs of policy makers. In particular, it focuses on how epidemiological indicators developed as part of emerging European political and institutional instruments and structures for responding to illegal drugs. It also notes the importance of wider international developments in <b>drug</b> <b>epidemiology</b> and of cooperation between networks of researchers. Interest in epidemiology at the European level was first observed in the early 1970 s with the creation of the Pompidou Group. Work on a variety of drug indica-tors accelerated in the 1980 s following the establishment of an expert epidemiology group within the Pompidou Group of the Council of Europe. This foreshadowed the founding by the European Union of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) in 1993. During the 1990 s, EMCDDA, together with the member States, further devel-oped five key epidemiological indicators of drug prevalence and health consequences in order to improve the quality and comparability of core data needed to describe and analyse the drug phenomenon at the European level. In the early 2000 s, those indi-cators were adopted by member States, endorsed by the European Council and incor-porated into the European Union Drugs Strategy and Action Plan 2000 - 2004. The goal is now to ensure implementation of those key indicators in member States as the basis for a European Union epidemiological information system on drugs. It is essen-tial that the indicators are complemented by qualitative and quantitative research and context information in order to interpret the data correctly and provide answers that are relevant to policy needs...|$|E
40|$|Population size {{is crucial}} when {{estimating}} population-normalized drug consumption (PNDC) from wastewater-based <b>drug</b> <b>epidemiology</b> (WBDE). Three conceptually different population estimates can be used: de jure (common census, residence), de facto (all persons within a sewer catchment), and chemical loads (contributors to the sampled wastewater). De facto and chemical loads {{will be the}} same where all households contribute to a central sewer system without wastewater loss. This study explored the feasibility of determining a de facto population and its effect on estimating PNDC in an urban community over an extended period. Drugs and other chemicals were analyzed in 311 daily composite wastewater samples. The daily estimated de facto population (using chemical loads) was on average 32 % higher than the de jure population. Consequently, using the latter would systemically overestimate PNDC by 22 %. However, the relative day-to-day pattern of drug consumption was similar regardless of the type of normalization as daily illicit drug loads appeared to vary substantially more than the population. Using chemical loads population, we objectively quantified the total methodological uncertainty of PNDC and reduced it by a factor of 2. Our study illustrated the potential benefits of using chemical loads population for obtaining more robust PNDC data in WBDE...|$|E
40|$|Introduction and Aims: Holiday periods are {{potentially}} {{a time for}} increased substance use as social events and private parties are more common. Data on community illicit drug consumption during holiday periods are limited. Besides existing methods for determining drug use, such as population surveys, one emerging method is to measure illicit drugs and/or their metabolites in wastewater samples. This study examined the change in consumption of cannabis, methamphetamine, cocaine and 3, 4 - methylenedioxymethamphetamine in three different types of areas (an inland semi-rural area, a coastal urban area and a vacation island) with respect to holiday times. Design and Methods: Samples were collected at the inlet of the major wastewater treatment plant in each area during a key annual holiday (i. e. the summer holiday including Christmas and New Year) and control period. Illicit drug residues in the daily composited samples were measured by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. Results: Drug use varied substantially among the three areas within each monitoring period {{as well as between}} the holiday and control period within each area. Use consistently increased and peaked over New Year particularly for cocaine and 3, 4 -methylenedioxymethamphetamine whereas cannabis and methamphetamine were relatively less subjected to holiday times in all the areas. Discussion and Conclusions: Wastewater sampling and analysis provides higher spatio-temporal resolution than national surveys and supplements <b>drug</b> <b>epidemiology</b> studies originating primary in metropolitan locations. Such data is essential for policy makers to plan potential intervention strategies associated with these illicit substances in regional areas and other settings besides urban areas in the future...|$|E

40|$|The {{field of}} <b>drug</b> abuse <b>epidemiology</b> is a {{relatively}} new one and recognition of drug abuse as a phenomenon amenable to study within the field of epidemiology is still forthcoming. Reviews of programmes for meetings of epidemiologic research societies rarely highlight drug abuse, even in association with the transmission of, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) or hepatitis B virus (HBV), despite the high rates of prevalence of those infections among drug-abusing populations. The “diagnosis ” of drug dependence or addiction and identification of affected populations relies heavily on data concerning problems associated with drug abuse. Both the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual and the International Classification of Diseases, for example, use behavioural criteria to define abuse and dependence. However, most surveys of general and special populations do not include measures that reflect these criteria, but limit themselves to the type of drug used and the frequency of use within a specified time period. With the progress in the development of more biological and medical tools, improved measures of abuse that combine both behavioural and physical assessments will be available to study more carefully the various forms of drug abuse and dependence. The present article has two purposes. The first is to set a framework that describes {{the current state of the}} field of <b>drug</b> abuse <b>epidemiology.</b> The second is to provide a synthesis and overview of the articles in the present issue and in vol. LV, Nos. 1 and 2 (2003), of the Bulletin, which represent work from several countries. The excitement of this emergent field is reflected in each of the articles.

Methods and Material: The methods used in our approach include the generic constraint propagation techniques for reducing the bounds of uncertainty of the numerical variables complemented with new constraint reasoning techniques that we developed to handle differential equations. Results: The results of our approach are illustrated in biomedical models for the diagnosis of diabetes, tuning of <b>drug</b> design, and <b>epidemiology</b> where it was a valuable decision supporting tool notwithstanding the uncertainty on data.

40|$|Illicit {{drug use}} is a global {{phenomenon}} involving millions of individuals, which results in serious health and social costs. The chemical analysis of urban wastewater for the excretion products of illicit drugs is a potent approach for monitoring patterns and trends of illicit drug use in a community. The first international and multidisciplinary conference on this topic was recently organized to present the epidemiological knowledge of patterns in drug use and the information obtained from wastewater analysis. This paper gives {{an overview of the}} main issues that emerged during the conference, focusing on the identified research gaps and requirements and on the future challenges and opportunities from bringing together wastewater analysis and <b>drug</b> <b>epidemiology.</b> The European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) uses an established multi-indicator system to monitor illicit drug use and to identify the emergence of new psychoactive substances. The methodological challenges of monitoring a hidden and stigmatized behavior like drug use include the limitations of self-report data and reporting delays. An increasing evidence base suggests that wastewater analysis can address some of these problems. Specifically this technique can: monitor temporal and spatial trends in drug use at different scales, provide updated estimates of drug use, and identify changing habits and the use of new substances. A best practice protocol developed by a Europe-wide network of experts is available to produce homogeneous and comparable data at different sites. The systematic evaluation of uncertainties related to wastewater analysis has highlighted which areas require careful control and those that need further investigation to generally improve the approach. Wastewater analysis has considerable potential to complement existing approaches for monitoring drug use due to its ability to produce objective, real-time estimates of drug use and to give timely information of any change in the patterns of use...|$|E

This section also deals with social aspects of drug addiction and drug abuse as a social aspect which may lead to the occurrence of other diseases. The practical section contains a secondary analysis of data obtained from quarterly annual reports that are published by the <b>Drug</b> <b>Epidemiology</b> Department of the Praque´s Hygiene Station and include the required nationwide information.

It was found that the hypothesis presuming a decline in the type B and type C hepatitis occurrence rates in relation to the number of injection sets distributed within exchange programmes was not confirmed. It was also found that the scope of distribution of injection sets became slightly reduced in one of the regions under survey (Ústecký Region) between 2008 and 2009 in spite of the increase in the nationwide distribution of injection sets.

40|$|This diploma {{thesis is}} focused on testing drug users. Specifically, this thesis is {{concerned}} with testing drug users in low-threshold centres. These low-threshold centres for drug users operate {{in the area of}} secondary and tertiary prevention. Furthermore, it describes individual diseases such as HIV, HBV, HCV and syphilis, their mode of transmission, clinical course, diagnosis, treatment and possible prevention, drug policy of the Czech Republic, the conditions for testing the abovementioned diseases in low-threshold centres and the legal framework for testing at these facilities. The practical part is divided into several research studies. The qualitative research is aimed at low-threshold centres. In this part, I am trying to determine the number of HIV, HBV and HCV tests performed in 2014. Next, the purpose of this section is also to define where the testing takes place and who is tested. The research data were obtained using a questionnaire distributed to the low-threshold centres in the CR. According to the Annual Report on <b>Drug</b> <b>Epidemiology</b> from 2014, there are 76 low-threshold centres in the Czech Rep. A total of 32 questionnaires were collected. The questionnaire consisted of 32 questions. Close-ended questions were used to detect the type of facility, whether the facility carries out tests for the chosen types of diseases, what type of test is used, who performs the testing and where the testing is carried out. Open-ended questions were used to determine the number of people tested. The qualitative research consists of 18 interviews with drug users from the Contact Centre Český Krumlov. Thanks to its field program, this centre operates in Český Krumlov, Větřní, Kaplice, Horní Planá, Loučovice, Frymburk, Vyšší Brod and in border regions such as Horní and Dolní Dvořiště or Studánky where the drug abuse is very problematic. The data were collected using a semistructured anonymous interview. The interview consisted of 4 areas:Data for identification purposes. Drug history. Testing. Awareness. 30 questionnaires received from the respondents at the Prevent Contact Centre in České Budějovice {{can be found in the}} Appendix. The data were collected using an anonymous questionnaire which consisted of three basic areas. The collected data included drug history and identification information, information about testing for infectious diseases and knowledge of health risks. The thesis states 6 goals. The first 3 goals deal with mapping of HBV, HCV and HIV testing among drug users at low-threshold centres in 2014. The purpose of the fourth goal is to determine how the testing is carried out in low-threshold centres. The fifth goal attempts to establish whether drug users are interested in HBV, HCV and HIV testing. Finally, the sixth goal determines whether drug users were tested in 2014. After processing the results I established the following hypotheses which resulted from the research. H 1 : Drug users are interested in their health. H 2 :Drug users are aware of risks that result from these diseases. H 3 : The possibility of testing at low-threshold centres is not chosen very often by drug users. The research showed that drug users have adequate information about the risks that are associated with drug injection and injecting equipment sharing, but the average amount of performed tests is relatively low. To sum up, drug users need to be constantly informed about the importance of regular testing. In order to increase the number of tested people, it would be advisable to adapt the testing to the users' needs and also to perform more tests within field programs. It would also be helpful to link health facilities to contact centres locally...|$|E

40|$|In 1998, the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) {{published}} {{the first edition}} of Assessing Drug Abuse Within and Across Communities: Community Epidemiology Surveillance Networks on Drug Abuse to share information on establishing <b>drug</b> abuse <b>epidemiology</b> networks at community and State levels. The first edition was widely distributed and well received, with ongoing requests for a reprint of the publication. However, it was clear that an update and not a reprint would be of most value to the fields of <b>drug</b> abuse <b>epidemiology,</b> research, and intervention. Since 1998, the expansion of the Internet has greatly enhanced access to relevant drug abuse information. Also, since 1998, there have been substantial changes in drug abuse data sources used by epidemiology networks. This second edition addresses these changes, but the purpose of this edition remains the same: to provide guidelines for establishing epidemiology networks to monitor and assess drug abuse patterns and trends and emerging drug problems at community and State levels to provide a foundation of information for public health response. NIDA's Division of Epidemiology, Services and Prevention Research has continued to support epidemiology networks, including the Community Epidemiology Work Group (CEWG) consisting of 21 sentinel metropolitan areas, the Border Epidemiology Work Group in coordination with the Ministry of Health of Mexico, and State Epidemiology Work Groups. International epidemiology networks, modeled after the CEWG, often present data at CEWG meetings on drug abuse patterns and trends in other nations. Years of experience with these groups are testimony to the contributions of epidemiology work groups in advising public health response in our Nation as well as other countries. This second edition differs from the first in format. For each data source, there is a description of the source and database, followed by guidelines on how to access the data (including Web sites) and what to request, and examples of how the data have been used by epidemiology work groups or Federal agencies. NIDA hopes that this revised guide is helpful to agencies, organizations, and researchers that are involved in or wish to establish epidemiology networks in their communities or States...|$|R
40|$|Phylogenetic {{estimation}} from aligned DNA, RNA or {{amino acid}} sequences has attracted {{more and more}} attention in recent years due to its importance in analysis of many fine-scale genetic data. Nowadays, its application fields range from medical research to <b>drug</b> discovery, to <b>epidemiology,</b> to systematics and population dynamics. Estimating phylogenies involves solving an optimization problem, called the phylogenetic estimation problem (PEP), whose versions depend on the criterion used to select a phylogeny among plausible alternatives. This chapter offers an overview of PEP and discuss the most important versions {{that occur in the}} literature. SCOPUS: ch. binfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|Phylogenies are trees {{representing}} the evolutionary relationships {{of a set}} of species (called taxa). Phylogenies find application in several scientific areas ranging from medical research to <b>drug</b> discovery, <b>epidemiology,</b> systematics and population dynamics. In these applications the available information is usually restricted to the leaves of a phylogeny and is represented by molecular data extracted from the species analyzed. On the contrary, the information about the phylogeny itself is generally missing and must be determined by solving an optimization problem, called the phylogeny estimation problem (PEP), whose versions depend on the criterion used to select a phylogeny among plausible alternatives. In this paper, we investigate {{one of the most significant}} versions of the PEP, called the balanced minimum evolution problem. We propose an exact algorithm based on the enumeration of non-isomorphic trees and the subsequent solution of quadratic assignment problems. Furthermore, by exploiting the underlying parallelism of the algorithm, we present a parallel version of the algorithm which shows a linear speed-up with respect to the sequential version. Extensive computational results prove the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms...|$|R
