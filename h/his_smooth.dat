25|$|Dennis John Cometti (born 26 March 1949) is an Australian sports {{commentator}} {{and a former}} player and coach of Australian rules football.

The following album, Color Rit, continued with a similar mood. He did however, change direction completely again with his straight-ahead jazz album Stolen Moments. Sounding similar to Wes Montgomery, Ritenour played alongside long-time collaborator, saxophonist Ernie Watts, pianist Alan Broadbent, bassist John Patitucci (playing only acoustic) and drummer Harvey Mason. During that same year, he performed and composed the theme song of the Canadian TV series Ramona.|$|E

500|$|Regarded as a left-handed hitting {{version of}} Vladimir Guerrero (also {{a native of}} the Dominican Republic), one of Taveras' prized skills was an ability that few possess to square the bat on – and {{effectively}} hit – pitches that are out of the strike zone, much as the case was with Guerrero. [...] Because of his bat speed and the wide range of pitch locations of which he could hit, Taveras successfully unraveled what are termed as [...] "pitcher's pitches", which helped contribute to his high batting average. [...] An aggressive hitter, Taveras maintained control with <b>his</b> <b>smooth</b> swing.|$|E

It is theorized that Mr. Z, a fellow competitor and Zayat-bred colt, {{may have been the}} culprit; the pair were kept together in Florida as younger horses.

500|$|Rivera had an {{impeccable}} {{ability to}} accurately locate pitches and consistently throw strikes, {{particularly on the}} inside and outside edges of the strike zone. This strength offset his reliance on one pitch and hitters' anticipation of it. His former catcher Joe Girardi said, [...] "He was so easy to catch because he always put the ball right there. I don't think there's ever been a pitcher that great who was so easy to catch." [...] Rivera's 4.10 career strikeout-to-walk ratio in the regular season ranks ninth-best in major league history. His control was a byproduct of <b>his</b> <b>smooth,</b> easily repeated pitching motion, which some opposing hitters found to be deceptive. One such player, Darrin Fletcher, said in 1999 that Rivera [...] "almost kind of lulls you to sleep with his delivery. It gives you a false sense of security, and then the ball is on you and it's exploding." ...|$|E
500|$|Lindwall, widely {{regarded}} as one of the greatest fast bowlers of all time, bowled with a classical and artistic side-on bowling action. David Frith wrote that [...] "there was a balance, rhythmic run, a build-up" [...] and an [...] "ecstasy" [...] in <b>his</b> <b>smooth</b> delivery action. Richie Benaud said that Lindwall was [...] "technically the best fast bowler" [...] that he ever saw. During the 1950s, Lindwall's action was copied by young children and a number of first-class Australian bowlers, including Ron Gaunt, John Power and Barry Fisher consciously copied his action. Alan Davidson, who succeeded Lindwall as Australia's pace spearhead, labelled him as [...] "the best fast bowler I ever saw". Lindwall's childhood hero Harold Larwood rated Dennis Lillee to be equal to Lindwall [...] "but not ahead of him". Following Lindwall's tour of England in 1953, his English counterpart Alec Bedser said that Lindwall was [...] "the best fast bowler I've seen, because of his variety and control". Lindwall was particularly known for his trademark outswinger, which swung late and at high pace. Fred Trueman believed that Lindwall's ability to simultaneously swing the ball and at such pace and accuracy was matched only by himself and Wes Hall. Frank Tyson wrote that [...] "he appears to be just jogging his fifteen yards up to the stumps – until the last couple of strides of his approach, when he suddenly explodes into his delivery stride...when he releases the ball, his bowling arm is so low that it borders on the round-arm". Lindwall's ability to swing the ball at high pace allowed him to repeatedly breach the defences of his opponents; of his 228 Test wickets, 98 were bowled and another 31 were leg before wicket. Lindwall's repertoire was reinforced with a dangerous yorker and bouncer, and changes of pace. As Tyson said [...] "who is not 'Lindy's bunny' when he slots his yorker in the right spot?". In 1952 he developed an inswinger and then coupled it with his yorker, which homed into the feet of batsmen at high pace. Denis Compton said that Lindwall had the subtleties of a slow bowler, saying that he [...] "raised what is considered to be the labouring force of cricket [...] to an artform with his tactical shrewdness, control and variations".|$|E
500|$|Ready {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} professional critics, which received an aggregate score of 67 out of 100. The score, indicating [...] "generally favorable reviews" [...] {{was based on}} six reviews from website Metacritic. It received many comparisons {{to the work of}} R artist R. Kelly, while several critics noted it as inconsistent. David Jeffries of Allmusic said that [...] "Even at a whopping 17 like-minded tracks, all-night lovers wouldn't be caught dead complaining about how overly long it all is", commenting that Ready [...] "is as entertaining and frivolous as a one-night stand should be." [...] Ken Capobianco of The Boston Globe said that Songz had developed as a vocalist stating his voice was more [...] "elastic" [...] and he used his falsetto [...] "judiciously." [...] Capobianco commended tracks like [...] "Be Where You Are," [...] and [...] "Love Lost", commenting that [...] "tracks like that show that he is indeed ready for the next step." [...] Andrew Rennie of Now said, [...] "slight deviations from R classic formula allow Trey Songz wiggle room to play with his multi-octave voice. This offering sets him apart from other acts and may secure his spot in the canon of bedroom crooners." [...] Glenn Gamboa of Newsday said that after making his name for singing hooks on rap songs, that he [...] "shows <b>his</b> <b>smooth</b> R vocals can hold the spotlight all on their own." [...] Rolling Stone gave the album 3½ out of 5 stars and wrote that Songz [...] "takes cues from R. Kelly, slyly mocking the self-parodying excesses of boudoir R while supplying the utilitarian goods: the sumptuous vocal harmonies and sultry beats upon which long nights beneath ceiling mirrors depend". A writer for USA Today said the album reflects his broad appeal, and that Songz's proves [...] "he's comfortable as a rogue or romantic. Even though the review pointed out that [...] "he occasionally falls back on booty-call clichés," [...] it did point out that [...] "his song craft shines on the edgy [...] "Black Roses" [...] and regretful [...] "Love Lost." [...] Jon Caramanica of The New York Times said, [...] "'Ready' is one of the year’s most promising R albums, and a curious one at that", commenting, [...] "the results are bawdy but never lecherous; sometimes all his enthusiastic bedroom talk has an air of childlike goofiness to it, as if he were thrilled to get away with boasting so freely." [...] Sean Fennesssy of The Village Voice called the album [...] "one of the year's best..." ...|$|E

[...] Bowman further wrote that the recording of the What's Going On single was [...] "...the first single to utilize all three as Marvin developed a radical approach to constructing his recordings by layering a series of contrapuntal background vocal lines on different tracks, each one conceived and sung in isolation by Marvin himself." [...] Bowman cites Gaye's multi-tracking of his tenor voice and other vocal styles [...] "summon up what might be termed the ancient art of weaving".|$|E
