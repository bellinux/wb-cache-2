25|$|<b>Gastroscopy</b> (endoscopic {{examination}} of the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum) is performed in patients with established cirrhosis to exclude the possibility of esophageal varices. If these are found, prophylactic local therapy may be applied (sclerotherapy or banding) and beta blocker treatment may be commenced.|$|E
25|$|<b>Gastroscopy,</b> or {{endoscopic}} {{evaluation of}} the stomach, is useful in chronic cases of colic suspected {{to be caused by}} gastric ulcers, gastric impactions, and gastric masses. A 3-meter scope is required to visualize the stomach of most horses, and the horse must be fasted prior to scoping.|$|E
25|$|An {{esophagogastroduodenoscopy}} (EGD), {{a form of}} endoscopy, {{also known}} as a <b>gastroscopy,</b> is carried out on people in whom a peptic ulcer is suspected. By direct visual identification, the location and severity of an ulcer can be described. Moreover, if no ulcer is present, EGD can often provide an alternative diagnosis.|$|E

25|$|The {{interpretation}} of standard barium swallow examinations for assessing dysphagia is operator and interpreter dependent. It has poor sensitivity for subtle abnormalities but is more sensitive in detecting esophageal webs and rings than <b>gastroscopy.</b> The best initial evaluation of suspected oropharyngeal dysphagia is a barium study. Barium swallow studies remain the main investigation of dysphagia. Barium studies may detect pharyngeal tumors {{that are difficult}} to visualize endoscopically.|$|E
25|$|Risk {{factors include}} obesity, pregnancy, smoking, hiatus hernia, and taking certain medicines. Medications {{involved}} include antihistamines, calcium channel blockers, antidepressants, and sleeping medication.

40|$|Background: Peptic {{ulcer disease}} (PUD) {{represents}} a common condition, although its incidence is decreasing. Previous studies reported {{a high rate}} of idiopathic PUD prevalence. Aim: To investigate prevalence, relative distribution of etiologic factors and prevalence of complication of PUD in an Italian endoscopic series. Materials and methods: All <b>gastroscopies</b> performed in adult patients during 3 years were considered. Patients with PUD, with antral and corporal histology, were included in the study. Helicobacter pylori infection was assessed by histology. Idiopathic PUD was defined as an ulcer without evidence H. pylori infection or prior exposure to NSAIDs. Results: 300 patients with PUD out of 11, 148 <b>gastroscopies</b> were included in our study accounting for a prevalence of 2. 7 %. H. pylori-associated PUD was diagnosed in 62. 3 %, NSAID/aspirin-associated PUD in 22 %, H. pylori/NSAID/aspirin-associated PUD in 11. 6 %, and idiopathic PUD in the remaining 4 % of cases. Regarding ulcer complications the logistic regression analysis identified the following significant risk factors for GI bleeding: NSAIDs and/or aspirin use, age > 65 years and coexistent gastric and duodenal ulcers. Conclusion: Our data found a low endoscopic prevalence of peptic ulcer. Both H. pylori infection and NSAIDs and/or aspirin use remain the main determinants and idiopathic ulcer prevalence is very low. (C) 2010 Editrice Gastroenterologica Italiana S. r. l.

30|$|Whereas {{previous}} reports {{focused on}} UGE {{performed in the}} ICU for overt gastrointestinal bleeding [7, 16], Plaisier et al. [15] described the indications and results of 411 <b>gastroscopies</b> performed in 4 ICUs of a single Dutch hospital. Unlike our series, most patients were admitted for a gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Nevertheless, in patients undergoing the UGE for another reason, esophagitis, gastritis and gastric ulcer were the most frequent coincidental findings, as in our series. Of interest, in this setting, UGE was also widely used (in 35 % of cases) for the placement of feeding tubes, which was a very uncommon indication in our series.|$|R
25|$|Gastric {{squamous}} cell carcinoma is most often found in the non-glandular region of the stomach of horses greater than 5 years of age, and horses often present with weight loss, anorexia, anemia, and ptyalism. Gastric carcinoma is usually diagnosed via <b>gastroscopy,</b> but may sometimes be felt on rectal if they have metastasized to the peritoneal cavity. Additionally, laparoscopy can also diagnose metastasized cancer, as can presence of neoplastic cells on abdominocentesis. Often the signs of intestinal neoplasia are non-specific, and include weight loss and colic, usually only if obstruction of the intestinal lumen occurs.|$|E
25|$|Esophageal SEMS {{are placed}} after a <b>gastroscopy</b> is {{performed}} {{to identify the}} area of narrowing. The area {{may need to be}} dilated in order to allow the gastroscope to pass. The tumour is usually better seen with the direct vision of endoscopy than on a fluoroscopic image. As a result, radio-opaque markers are usually placed {{on the surface of the}} patient in order to mark the area of narrowing on fluoroscopy. The SEMS is placed through the channel of the endoscope into the esophagus over a guidewire, marked on fluoroscopy, and mechanically deployed (using a device that sits outside of the endoscope) such that it expands when in position. Hypaque or other water-soluble dye may be placed through the passage to ensure patency of the stent on fluoroscopy. Enteric and colonic SEMS are inserted in a similar fashion, but in the duodenum and colon respectively.|$|E
25|$|Gastric impactions are {{relatively}} rare, and occur when food is not cleared {{at the appropriate}} rate. It is most commonly associated with ingestion of foods that swell after eating or feeds that are coarse (bedding or poor quality roughage), poor dental care, poor mastication, inadequate drinking, ingestion of a foreign object, and alterations in the normal function of the stomach. Persimmons, which form a sticky gel in the stomach, and haylage, have both been associated with it, as has wheat, barley, mesquite beans, and beet pulp. Horses usually show signs of mild colic that is chronic, unresponsive to analgesics, and may include signs such as dysphagia, ptyalism, bruxism, fever, and lethargy, although severe colic signs may occur. Signs of shock may be seen if gastric rupture has occurred. Usually, the impaction must be quite large before it presents symptoms, and may be diagnosed via <b>gastroscopy</b> or ultrasound, although rectal examinations are unhelpful. Persimmon impaction is treated with infusions of Coca-Cola. Other gastric impactions are often resolves with enteral fluids. Quick treatment generally produces a favorable prognosis.|$|E
40|$|Gastric xanthelasms {{were found}} in 0. 61 % of 1, 475 <b>gastroscopies.</b> The 9 {{patients}} had above 55 years of age. Xanthelasms appeared not related to metabolic disorders. They showed as small yellowish macular lesions, single or double. Histologically they were constituted by agglomerated foam cells in the lamina propria of the stomach. Inflammatory mucosal aspects, specially atrophic gastritis, in bioptic specimens taken far from xanthelasms were frequently shown. 3 patients had also circumscribed gastric lesions. The gastroscopic findings of xanthelasms {{should be considered as}} an indirect evidence of severe inflammatory changes of the gastric mucosa...|$|R
40|$|Two female patients, 86 and 80 {{years of}} age, {{had been treated}} with blood transfusions {{for several years and}} several months, respectively, due to iron-deficiency anaemia caused by {{gastrointestinal}} blood loss. Angiodysplasias were detected and subsequently coagulated in the course of repeated <b>gastroscopies</b> and colonoscopies. Due to the failure of this treatment, treatment with thalidomide was started. Thereafter, the gastrointestinal bleeding stopped and there was no longer any need for blood transfusions. Treatment with thalidomide seems an effective therapy for patients with frequently recurring gastrointestinal blood loss due to angiodysplasias who no longer tolerate conventional and invasive procedures due to their physical condition...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} quality of {{gastrointestinal}} (GI) endoscopic procedures and patient satisfaction in endoscopy suite of South Asian country. METHODS: Patients coming to the endoscopic suite of Aga Khan University Hospital (AKUH) were interviewed and assessed in this cross-sectional study. Quality of GI endoscopic procedures was evaluated using assessment tools as suggested by The American Society of Gastroenterology. Patient satisfaction after the procedure was assessed using a modified GHAA- 9 questionnaire. The questionnaire was statistically evaluated using Pareto analysis and Spearman rank correlation. RESULTS: In this study, 323 patients were evaluated {{with a mean age}} of 43 +/- 14. 36 years. Out of all the procedures 251 (77. 7 %) were <b>gastroscopies</b> while 72 (22. 3 %) were colonoscopies. Patients undergoing different therapeautic procedures were 121 in number (37. 46 %). Pre-procedure education was rated as excellent or very good by 91. 3 % of the patients. Midazolam was used for sedation with an average dose of 3 mg. Technically successful procedures included 99. 2 % <b>gastroscopies</b> and 98. 6 % colonoscopies. Mean score of patients regarding satisfaction on mGHAA- 9 questionnaire was 30 +/- 3. 965. Patient dissatisfaction calculated in our study was 3. 6 % with the length of time spent waiting before procedure and length of time waiting to get an appointment for the procedure contributing to 90 % of dissatisfaction. CONCLUSIONS: Quality of endoscopic procedures at our centre is at par with international standards with acceptable complication rate and good patient satisfaction...|$|R

2500|$|The typical {{history of}} ORS {{involves}} a long delay while the person continues {{to believe there}} is a genuine odor. On average, a patient with ORS goes undiagnosed for about 8 years. Repeated consultation with multiple different non-psychiatric medical specialists ("doctor shopping") in an attempt to have their non-existent body odor treated is frequently reported. Individuals with ORS may present to dermatologists, gastroentrologists, otolaryngologists, dentists, proctologists, and gynecologists. Despite the absence of any clinically detectable odor, physicians and surgeons may embark on unnecessary investigations (e.g. <b>gastroscopy),</b> and treatments, including surgery such as thoracic sympathectomy, tonsillectomy, etc. Such treatments generally have no long-term effect on the individual's belief in an odor symptom. If non-psychiatric clinicians refuse to carry out treatment on the basis that there is no real odor and offer to refer them to a psychologist or psychiatrist, persons with ORS typically refuse and instead seek [...] "a better" [...] doctor/dentist.|$|E

We set out to establish a more accurate prevalence estimate for CD using a novel serogenetic approach. Methods The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) -DQ genotype was determined in 356 patients with ‘biopsy-confirmed’ CD, and in two age-stratified, randomly selected community cohorts of 1, 390 women and 1, 158 men. Sera were screened for CD-specific serology. Results Only five ‘biopsy-confirmed’ patients with CD did not possess the susceptibility alleles HLA-DQ 2. 5, DQ 8, or DQ 2. 2, and four of these were misdiagnoses. HLA-DQ 2. 5, DQ 8, or DQ 2. 2 was present in 56 % of all women and men in the community cohorts. Transglutaminase (TG) - 2 IgA and composite TG 2 /deamidated gliadin peptide (DGP) IgA/IgG were abnormal in 4. 6 % and 5. 6 %, respectively, of the community women and 6. 9 % and 6. 9 %, respectively, of the community men, but in the screen-positive group, only 71 % and 75 %, respectively, of women and 65 % and 63 %, respectively, of men possessed HLA-DQ 2. 5, DQ 8, or DQ 2. 2. Medical review was possible for 41 % of seropositive women and 50 % of seropositive men, and led to biopsy-confirmed CD in 10 women (0. 7 %) and 6 men (0. 5 %), but based on relative risk for HLA-DQ 2. 5, DQ 8, or DQ 2. 2 in all TG 2 IgA or TG 2 /DGP IgA/IgG screen-positive subjects, CD affected 1. 3 % or 1. 9 %, respectively, of females and 1. 3 % or 1. 2 %, respectively, of men.

40|$|AIM: To {{retrospectively}} collect inpatient and outpatient {{data and}} to assess the use of endoscopic procedures during the years 1991, 1997 and 2003 to analyse for trends. METHODS: This retrospective survey was conducted in a University-associated Gastroenterology Unit offering secondary and tertiary health care services for a population of approximately 182 000 people in Southern New Zealand. Data collected included patient contacts (in- and outpatients), gastroscopic and colonoscopic investigations. RESULTS: We observed {{a significant increase in}} the absolute numbers of patient contacts over the years (1991 : 2308 vs 1997 : 2022 vs 2003 : 2783, P < 0. 0001) with inflammatory bowel disease, other diseases of the colon, anus and rectum and iron studies related disorders decreasing significantly but liver disease and constipation increasing linearly over time. The use of endoscopy services remained relatively stable but colonoscopic investigations for a positive family history of colorectal cancer increased significantly while more <b>gastroscopies</b> were performed for unexplained anaemia. CONCLUSION: The whole spectrum of gastroenterology contacts was studied. A substantial proportion of colonoscopies and outpatient consultations were undertaken to screen for colorectal cancer.

To describe a case of undetermined type of GCs in an Italian referral center for NETs and its prevalence among GCs during a 6 -year period. In a case series of 16 GCs seen at our unit between 2007 and 2012, 14 (83. 3 %) patients had type I carcinoid and 1 patient (6. 2 %) had type III carcinoid.

40|$|Despite the {{increasing}} use of carbon dioxide for endoscopies during the last years, ambient air is still used. The amount of air depends on several factors such as examination time, presumable diameter of the endoscope channel and of course active use of air by the operator. Although endoscopic complications due to ambient air in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract are a rare observation and mostly described in the colon, we report five cases in the upper GI tract due to insufflating large amounts of air through the endoscopes. All 5 patients needed an emergency upper endoscopy for acute presumed upper GI bleeding. In two cases both esophageal variceal bleeding and ulcer bleeding were detected; the fifth case presented with a bleeding due to gastric cancer. Due to insufflation of inadequate amounts of air through the endoscope channel, all patients deteriorated in circulation and ventilation. Two rumenocenteses and consecutively three laparotomies had to be performed in three patients. In the other two, <b>gastroscopies</b> had to be stopped for an emergency computed tomography.
