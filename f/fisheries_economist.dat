40|$|While the {{importance}} of international trade in fish products has long been recognized, international trade in fishing services (TIFS), involving harvesting, processing, transportation and marketing has received but little attention. Yet, {{one half of the}} world’s EEZs involve foreign fishing arrangements, resulting in such trade. The World Bank report, Trade in Fishing Services (2014), represents a first step towards building the understanding of TIFS and its potential impacts. This paper discusses the key economic findings of the report, which point to the potential enhancement of resource rent through time that TIFS offers. The economics of TIFS is seen to rest upon a blend of standard fisheries economics, international economics and Principal-Agent analysis. The paper discusses as well an attempt to apply some of the key economic findings of the report to coastal states of West Africa, and the potential opportunities opened up by such an application for south-south cooperation.

Meta-analysis {{is one of}} the most common tools in benefit transfer. The typical way to gauge the reliability of a meta-analytic benefit transfer is to use convergent validity, which consists of cross-validation exercises. The analyst estimates a meta regression model while omitting one or more observations from a meta dataset, then uses the estimated transfer model to predict the value of the omitted observation(s). These two objects (the true value and the predicted value) are then compared, producing a prediction error. The mean of the distribution of absolute percentage prediction errors is the standard measure of reliability of the benefit transfer, but discards useful information generated by the cross-validation exercise.  In particular, using point estimates to conduct benefit transfer ignores that the estimated value carries substantial uncertainty. Further, only using the mean of the transfer error distribution when assessing reliability ignores information that could potentially be useful to decision makers. The present paper proposes interval transfers as opposed to point estimate transfer for conducting benefit transfers. Interval-based estimates contain more information regarding the true value of an environmental amenity. Further, a new approach to policy making under uncertainty is proposed that can be used within the framework of meta regression models.  We showcase these methods in the context of benefit transfer of the recreational value of coral reef ecosystems, an area of growing international interest that has thus far received little attention. ...|$|R

In this setting, we control for endogeneity bias and truncation in the sea lice data. The statistical analysis determines the effect of different treatments on the salmon growth profile. The model also allows identifying the effect that factors such as center location, environmental conditions, sea lice abundance in the area, have on salmon growth. We simulate how unit production costs vary with different treatments and center characteristics, and estimate the impact of treatments costs on unit production costs. Our results indicate that lice generate an important increase in unit costs, basically because its negative impact on the salmon production cycle and that sea lice treatments in the form of chemical baths, although expensive, do reduce unit production costs.

In addition, it is shown that this tax structure can secure optimal expected individual catches and simulations show that the tax payment is very low. Thus, the tax system may be useful in practical fisheries management. Prices regulation, Quantity regulation, Asymmetric Information, Self-Reporting, Stock Tax and Harvest Tax...|$|R

In the 20 th century {{the question of the}} use of common property resources has initially been treated by <b>fisheries</b> <b>economists,</b> at first in unknown publications of Jens Warming in 1911 and 1931, and after a disruption of more than 40 years starting again with the contributions of Gordon and Scott in the 1950 s. Important results have been the derivation and presentation of the economic criteria for the open access equilibrium case {{on the one hand and}} the private property equilibrium case on the other hand. Garrett Hardin's well known 1968 Sciences article brought a new title and increased awareness to the 'tragedy of the commons' and Elenor Ostrom's 2009 nobel prize in economics finally underlined the importance as well as the diversity of institutional rules to achieve an efficient use of the natural resources - challenging the favored liberal concept of a privatization of scarce resources. Johann Heinrich von Thuenen's contributions on the commons - hidden in an 1831 article about urban agriculture in the journal 'Neue Annalen der Mecklenburgischen Landwirtschaftsgesellschaft' and in an unpublished manuscript - have been totally neglected until now, although he published his article about the core problem of the commons two years earlier than William Forster Lloyd and almost in the clarity of the <b>fisheries</b> <b>economists</b> 80 resp. 120 years later. He not only presented the correct allocation criteria for both property rights scenarios but additionally developed a framework a) how to gain the maximal rent of a resource through an auction system - drafting the first demand table b) how to redistribute the gains to the communal property owners - developing an adequate compensation mechanism c) and finally how to establish this institutional innovation democratically - thereby applying important elements of Elenor Ostrom's Common Property Rights Framework. Due to these contributions Johann Heinrich von Thuenen deserves the title of the founder of the economics of renewable resources.

40|$|Abstract: The marine {{environment}} is experiencing increased human-induced stress, compounded by natural and human-induced (global warming) climatic changes. “Freedom {{of the sea}} ” {{is no longer a}} viable option as marine resources become increasingly scarce. Both fishermen and managers must work cooperatively and diligently to monitor the existing limited resources. In order to effectively monitor a fishery, managers need to quantify how much is removed from the sea. Observer programs are the best way to achieve this objective and without them, managers are operating on guesswork. Observer data is used throughout the globe by conservation groups, international agencies, economists, and a wide array of scientists. Almost all of the catch values from commercial fishing vessels cited in publications by these institutions originate from observer program data. Self-reporting of catch data has proven to be inaccurate and ineffective in monitoring stocks. This is because most fishermen are concentrating on commercially valuable species, boat maintenance and compliance to those regulations that are easily and most often checked by enforcement officials. There is a prevailing naivety throughout societies regarding the true cost of eating fish. This must be addressed by <b>fisheries</b> <b>economists</b> so that vital monitoring systems don't fall by the wayside...|$|R

The results support fisheries economics literature that fishery participation and location choice are associated with expected revenue, past behavior, and spatial and temporal closures. Our work suggests that caution must be exercised when modeling fishermen location choice in isolation. Ignoring the multi-species aspect of fisheries may lead to both poor characterization of fishing behavior and poor prediction of the effect of spatial management policies. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract OnlyAt a 1969 conference, Coase {{provided}} rather scathing {{comment on}} a paper co-authored by Scott (Economics of Fisheries Management: A Symposium, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, 1970.) That comment is remarkable inasmuch as Scott {{thought that he was}} using a transactions cost approach based upon Coase (1960). This paper will argue that the Coase commentary reflects fundamentally different paradigms of neo-classical economists and the “new institutionalists. ” The gap between those two paradigms remains today and has a significant influence on the research and policy agenda for <b>fisheries.</b> Neo-classical <b>fisheries</b> <b>economists</b> routinely refer to ITQs as property rights and they tend to conclude that ITQs have “solved” the efficiency problems of fisheries. The new institutionalists would insist that ITQs are simply government regulation, subject to all the failings of regulatory systems. For them, the quest for solutions based on property rights, rather than regulatory rights, remains. The paper will argue that Scott was actually trying to bridge those two paradigms in 1969 and, indeed, has continued work on that bridge throughout his career. Coase’s comment might be interpreted as an objection that such an ideological bridge cannot be built. That economics has for 35 years been unable to more beyond ITQs (despite some heroic contributions by Scott) suggests that Coase’s comment was prescient...|$|R
40|$|Fisheries {{management}} {{as we know}} it today is in a perpetual state of crisis because it is fatally flawed. Fisheries management will increasingly fail to prevent species decline, and even exacerbate those declines, unless it adopts new institutional priorities and methodologies based not on the prevalent “Industrial Model,” which is driven primarily by economic utility, but instead based on the “Biological Model,” which is primarily driven by the whole range of species’ biological needs, including limits placed by interactions with other species and by the ecosystem’s carrying capacity at each stage of a species’s lifecycle. In other words, fisheries managers – including <b>fisheries</b> <b>economists</b> – must stop just managing fishermen and learn to manage fish ecosystems by thinking more like biologists than economists. To do this, concepts such as “efficient use” and “optimization” of the resource must now be legally redefined primarily in biological and ecosystem conservation terms, and fisheries management agencies must adopt the tools of conservation biology, including investing far more heavily in the basic biological monitoring that makes such management possible. Failure to make these changes will simply lead to more stock crashes, unnecessary and probably fatal stresses on fishing-dependent communities, and ultimately extinction of whole species...|$|R

Recently, maximum economic yield (MEY) {{has been identified as}} a primary management objective for Australian fisheries and is under consideration elsewhere.

Using a bioeconomic model of an Australian fishery for which MEY is the management target, we note that unconstrained optimization may result in effort trajectories that would not be acceptable to industry or managers. Different assumptions regarding appropriate constraints result in different outcomes, each of which may be considered a valid MEY. Similarly, alternative treatments of prices and costs may result in differing estimates of MEY and their associated effort trajectories. To develop an implementable management strategy in an adaptive management framework, a set of assumptions must be agreed among scientists, economists, and industry and managers, indicating that operationalizing MEY is {{not simply a matter of}} estimating the numbers but requires strong industry commitment and involvement...|$|R

The strength of conducting a parallel analysis is to be comparable with previous studies while exploiting the power of the decomposition to identify the component effects of the policy. Determining the important components of productivity changes, such as transferability of quota and flexibility in when to harvest, allows for the refinement of management to mimic the effect of property rights systems even when their full implementation may not be possible. Results suggest that the introduction of individual vessel quotas in the coastal cod fisshery increased productivity. Stephanie F. McWhinni...|$|R

This study reveals consumer preferences for seafood in San Diego County by quantifying {{the relationship between the}} prices of seafood products, trophic level, and eco-labeling using data collected from a random selection of markets {{over the course of a}} year across San Diego County. The prices of seafood products reflect supply and consumer preferences in demand. Hedonic analysis shows price per unit weight increases with trophic level of the seafood species. The economic effect of third-party eco-labeling (Marine Stewardship Council, Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch, Best Aquaculture Practices, etc.), and keyword labeling (the use of keywords such as ‘local’, ‘sustainable’, and ‘responsible’) are also analyzed. The discussion considers the implications of revealed consumer preference for high trophic level seafood species, externalities inherent in seafood production, and opportunities for harnessing consumers as assets in the shift towards a more holistic approach to seafood consumption. ...|$|R

North American Association of <b>Fisheries</b> <b>Economists</b> (NAAFE), Corvallis, 2017. The Resource Evaluation and Assessment Division’s Social Sciences Branch (SSB) in the NOAA Northeast region {{is preparing for}} an external review in 2017 to evaluate its programs alignment between the strategic objectives of SSB, NEFSC, NMFS, and NOAA.   In previous SSB and NEFSC wide reviews, much attention has been drawn to the data and data architecture used by the Branch.  It is anticipated that one major focus of the 2017 review {{is to examine the}} potential that SSB could better meet its objectives if reorganized into management, research, and data groups instead of its current undivided structure. To obtain a preliminary idea of how such an organizational change might affect SSB activities from the data perspective, we examine how data currently flows through the branch and its eventual impact upon future management decisions. Using the catch share management program as an example, we examine the data requirements necessary to monitor the economic effects through the creation of performance indicators. In addition, thought is given to the configuration and design of our long-term data collection program...|$|R

The transition from {{free access to}} regulated fisheries with tools like limited entry and quotas (of different degrees of transferability) meant an important evolution {{in the way of}} understanding fisheries problems and managing them efficiently. Extended Fisheries Jurisdiction gave the coastal states property-rights and the potential of a sustainable management of their fisheries resources. For many <b>fisheries</b> <b>economists</b> it was a "promise of abundance". In practice, without a policy of overcapacity reduction, and in the presence of multiple social and political constraints, these conclusions were reserved. Also, the problems of "unfinished business" in the Law of the Sea (1982), namely imprecise definition of rights in the areas of High-Seas adjacent to the EEZs and the consequent difficulties in the management of straddling stocks, make it necessary to revisit the "Tragedy of the Commons" and the oldest issue: free access / excess of effort / overfishing. We could corraborate this by the analysis of cod fisheries in Newfoundland / Canada. We also avaliate the consequences of Extended Fisheries Jurisdiction and European Community integration on the Portuguese long-distance cod fisheriesAvailable from Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, Servico de Informacao e Documentacao, Av.
