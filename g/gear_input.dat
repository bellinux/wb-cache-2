50|$|A rag joint {{refers to}} certain {{flexible}} joints (flexure bearings) found on automobiles and other machines. They are typically found on steering shafts that connect {{the steering wheel}} to the steering <b>gear</b> <b>input</b> shaft, usually at the steering gear end. They provide {{a small amount of}} flex for a steering shaft within a few degrees of the same plane as the steering <b>gear</b> <b>input</b> shaft. It also provides some damping of vibration coming from the steering system, providing some isolation for the steering wheel.|$|E

The intersection of two perpendicular cylinders is one point and therefore, in theory, the blue gear and the yellow gear mesh in one single point. Pascal designed a gear that could easily take {{the strength of the}} strongest operator and yet added almost zero friction to the entire mechanism ...|$|E
40|$|In {{the article}} {{presented}} and discussed were results from investigations performed on dynamic model of two-stage gear. A number of course features of dynamic coefficient value KV in {{the function of}} rotational speed of <b>gear</b> <b>input</b> shaft were shown. Compared were course features obtained from every single stage of two-stage gear with course features obtained from particular (isolated) stages. Analysis of obtained results lead to the conclusion, that independent assessment of particular gear stages used in calculations could be simplifying assumption...|$|E

50|$|This {{equation}} {{shows that}} {{if the number of}} teeth on the output gear GB is larger than the number of teeth on the <b>input</b> <b>gear</b> GA, then the <b>input</b> <b>gear</b> GA must rotate faster than the output gear GB.|$|R

40|$|Computer {{models of}} life and {{reliability}} are presented for planetary gear trains with a fixed ring <b>gear,</b> <b>input</b> applied to the sun gear, and output taken from the planet arm. For this transmission the {{input and output shafts}} are co-axial and the input and output torques are assumed to be coaxial with these shafts. Thrust and side loading are neglected. The reliability model is based on the Weibull distributions of the individual reliabilities of the in transmission components. The system model is also a Weibull distribution. The load versus life model for the system is a power relationship as the models for the individual components. The load-life exponent and basic dynamic capacity are developed as functions of the components capacities. The models are used to compare three and four planet, 150 kW (200 hp), 5 : 1 reduction transmissions with 1500 rpm input speed to illustrate their use...|$|E
50|$|This {{shows that}} if the output gear GB has more teeth than the <b>input</b> <b>gear</b> GA, then the gear train amplifies the input torque. And, if the output gear has fewer teeth than the <b>input</b> <b>gear,</b> then the gear train reduces the input torque.|$|R
50|$|If {{the output}} gear of {{a gear train}} rotates more slowly than the <b>input</b> <b>gear,</b> then the gear train is called a speed reducer. In this case, because the output gear must have more teeth than the <b>input</b> <b>gear,</b> the speed reducer amplifies the input torque.|$|R
50|$|The {{speed ratio}} of {{a gear train}} also defines its {{mechanical}} advantage. This shows that if the <b>input</b> <b>gear</b> rotates faster than the output gear, then the gear train amplifies the input torque. And, if the <b>input</b> <b>gear</b> rotates slower than the output gear, the gear train reduces the input torque.|$|R
50|$|The <b>input</b> <b>gear</b> in this {{gear train}} has 13 teeth and the idler gear has 21 teeth. Considering only these gears, the gear ratio between the idler and the <b>input</b> <b>gear</b> can be {{calculated}} as if the idler gear was the output gear. Therefore, the gear ratio is driven/drive = 21/13 ≈1.62 or 1.62:1.|$|R
5000|$|The {{simplest}} {{example of}} a gear train has two gears. The [...] "input gear" [...] (also known as drive gear) transmits power to the [...] "output gear" [...] (also known as driven <b>gear).</b> The <b>input</b> <b>gear</b> will typically be connected to a power source, such as a motor or engine. In such an example, the output of torque and rotational speed from the output (driven) gear depend on {{the ratio of the}} dimensions of the two gears.|$|R

50|$|In the photo, {{assuming}} the smallest gear {{is connected to}} the motor, it is called the drive <b>gear</b> or <b>input</b> <b>gear.</b> The somewhat larger gear in the middle is called an idler gear. It is not connected directly to either the motor or the output shaft and only transmits power between the <b>input</b> and output <b>gears.</b> There is a third gear in the upper-right corner of the photo. Assuming that gear {{is connected to the}} machine's output shaft, it is the output or driven gear.|$|R

5000|$|The Predictor {{solved the}} problem by doing all of the {{calculations}} mechanically through a complex system of <b>gears.</b> <b>Inputs</b> to its calculations included wind speed, gravity, ballistics of the gun and the rounds it fired, angle to the target in azimuth and altitude, and a user-input estimated target speed. Some of these inputs were fed in by dials, which turned gearing inside the Predictor to calculate the range (from the change in angle and estimated speed) and direction of motion. The [...] "output" [...] of the device drove hydraulic servo-motors attached to the traversal and elevation gears of the otherwise unmodified Bofors gun, allowing it to follow the predictor's indications automatically without manual intervention. The gunners simply kept the gun loaded, while the three aimers simply had to point the Predictor, mounted on a large tripod, at the target. The Kerrison predictor did not calculate fuse settings, as the shells fired by the 40 mm Bofors gun, with which {{it was designed to}} work, were contact-fused.|$|R
50|$|For this analysis, we {{consider}} {{a gear train}} that has one degree-of-freedom, which means the angular rotation of all the gears in the gear train are defined by {{the angle of the}} <b>input</b> <b>gear.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Torque {{multiplier}} - Uses a multi-stage {{epicyclic gearing}} mechanism to multiply torque output. Torque {{is applied to}} the <b>input</b> <b>gear</b> which engages with a number of planet gears which are held in a fixed planetary gear. By using a reaction arm, the outside casing of the multiplier is prevented from rotating, causing the planet gears to rotate around the <b>input</b> <b>gear.</b> Along with the multiplication of torque, there is a decrease in rotational speed of the output shaft compared to the input shaft. This decrease in speed is inversely proportional to the increase in torque. [...] Torque multipliers {{come in a variety of}} output ratios as well.|$|R
