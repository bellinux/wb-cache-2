5|$|A {{benzodiazepine}} dependence {{occurs in}} {{about one-third of}} individuals who are treated with benzodiazepines for longer than 4 weeks, which typically results <b>in</b> <b>tolerance</b> and benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome when the dose is reduced too rapidly. Midazolam infusions may induce tolerance and a withdrawal syndrome {{in a matter of}} days. The risk factors for dependence include dependent personality, use of a benzodiazepine that is short-acting, high potency and long-term use of benzodiazepines. Withdrawal symptoms from midazolam can range from insomnia and anxiety to seizures and psychosis. Withdrawal symptoms can sometimes resemble a person’s underlying condition. Gradual reduction of midazolam after regular use can minimise withdrawal and rebound effects. Tolerance and the resultant withdrawal syndrome may be due to receptor down-regulation and GABAA receptor alterations in gene expression, which causes long-term changes in the function of the GABAergic neuronal system.|$|E

5|$|As {{with similar}} {{substances}} with a sedative-hypnotic mechanism, such as barbiturates and benzodiazepines, withdrawal from alcohol dependence {{can be fatal}} {{if it is not}} properly managed. Alcohol's primary effect is the increase in stimulation of the GABAA receptor, promoting central nervous system depression. With repeated heavy consumption of alcohol, these receptors are desensitized and reduced in number, resulting <b>in</b> <b>tolerance</b> and physical dependence. When alcohol consumption is stopped too abruptly, the person's nervous system suffers from uncontrolled synapse firing. This can result in symptoms that include anxiety, life-threatening seizures, delirium tremens, hallucinations, shakes and possible heart failure. Other neurotransmitter systems are also involved, especially dopamine, NMDA and glutamate.|$|E
25|$|Common {{side effects}} include sleepiness, poor coordination, and agitation. Long-term use may result <b>in</b> <b>tolerance,</b> dependence, and {{withdrawal}} symptoms if stopped abruptly. Dependence occurs in one-third {{of people who}} take clonazepam for longer than four weeks. It may increase risk of suicide in people who are depressed. If used during pregnancy it may result in harm to the baby. It binds to GABAA receptors and increases {{the effect of the}} neurotransmitter GABA.|$|E
25|$|Common {{side effects}} include {{sleepiness}} and trouble with coordination. Serious side effects are rare. They include suicide, decreased breathing, {{and an increased}} risk of seizures if used too frequently in those with epilepsy. Occasionally excitement or agitation may occur. Long term use can result <b>in</b> <b>tolerance,</b> dependence, and withdrawal symptoms on dose reduction. Abrupt stopping after long-term use can be potentially dangerous. After stopping, cognitive problems may persist for six months or longer. It is not recommended during pregnancy or breastfeeding. Its mechanism of action is by increasing the effect of the neurotransmitter gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA).|$|E

25|$|The neuroadaptive {{processes}} involved <b>in</b> <b>tolerance,</b> dependence, and withdrawal mechanisms implicate {{both the}} GABAergic and the glutamatergic systems. Gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) {{is the major}} inhibitory neurotransmitter of the central nervous system; roughly one-quarter to one-third of synapses use GABA. GABA mediates the influx of chloride ions through ligand-gated chloride channels called GABAA receptors. When chloride enters the nerve cell, the cell membrane potential hyperpolarizes thereby inhibiting depolarization, or reduction in the firing rate of the post-synaptic nerve cell. Benzodiazepine potentiates the action of GABA, by binding a site between the α and γ subunits of the 5-subunit receptor thereby increasing {{the frequency of the}} GABA-gated chloride channel opening in the presence of GABA.|$|E
25|$|Benzodiazepines share {{a similar}} {{mechanism}} of action with various sedative compounds that act by enhancing the GABAA receptor. Cross tolerance means that one drug will alleviate the withdrawal effects of another. It also means that tolerance of one drug will result <b>in</b> <b>tolerance</b> of another similarly-acting drug. Benzodiazepines are often used for this reason to detoxify alcohol-dependent patients and can have life-saving properties in preventing or treating severe life-threatening withdrawal syndromes from alcohol, such as delirium tremens. However, although benzodiazepines can be very useful in the acute detoxification of alcoholics, benzodiazepines in themselves act as positive reinforcers in alcoholics, by increasing the desire for alcohol. Low doses of benzodiazepines were found to significantly increase the level of alcohol consumed in alcoholics. Alcoholics dependent on benzodiazepines should not be abruptly withdrawn but be very slowly withdrawn from benzodiazepines, as over-rapid withdrawal is likely to produce severe anxiety or panic, which {{is well known for}} being a relapse risk factor in recovering alcoholics.|$|E
25|$|In 2014, {{tianeptine}} {{was found}} to be a μ-opioid receptor (MOR) full agonist using human proteins. It was also found to act as a full agonist of the δ-opioid receptor (DOR), although with approximately 200-fold lower potency. The same researchers subsequently found that the MOR is required for the acute and chronic antidepressant-like behavioral effects of tianeptine in mice and that its primary metabolite had similar activity as a MOR agonist but with a much longer elimination half-life. Moreover, although tianeptine produced other opioid-like behavioral effects such as analgesia and reward, it did not result <b>in</b> <b>tolerance</b> or withdrawal. The authors suggested that tianeptine may be acting as a biased agonist of the MOR and that this may be responsible for its atypical profile as a MOR agonist. However anecdotal reports from recreational, non-medical tianeptine users suggest that significant withdrawal effects resembling those of other typical opioid drugs (including but not limited to depression, insomnia, cold/flu-like symptoms) do manifest following prolonged high dose usage. In addition to its therapeutic effects, activation of the MOR is likely to also be responsible for the abuse potential of tianeptine at high doses that are well above the normal therapeutic range.|$|E

In vitro treatment of control rings with GTN (1 [*]h 10 [*]μM) similarly attenuated the vasorelaxant response to GTN, {{but not to}} ACh. Formation of superoxide radicals (•O 2 −) in endothelium-intact rings (lucigenin-chemiluminescence) increased 2. 5 fold <b>in</b> <b>in</b> vivo <b>tolerance,</b> but significantly decreased <b>in</b> <b>in</b> vitro <b>tolerance.</b> The membrane associated NADH oxidase activity was increased 2. 5 fold in homogenates of in vivo tolerant aortae, but was not changed in in vitro tolerant aorta. Conversely, SOD activity and protein expression was halved <b>in</b> <b>in</b> vivo <b>tolerance,</b> but SOD activity was not altered by <b>in</b> vitro <b>tolerance.</b> The •O 2 − scavenger tiron (10 [*]mM) effectively restored the vasorelaxant response to GTN in in vivo tolerant aortic rings, but not the reduced response to GTN in in vitro tolerant rings. Pretreatment (1 [*]h) of vessels with diethyldithiocarbamate (DETC; 10 [*]mM) attenuated vasorelaxant responses to GTN and ACh, increased vascular •O 2 − production, and inhibited SOD activity in vessel homogenates to a similar degree as observed <b>in</b> <b>in</b> vivo <b>tolerance.</b> DETC-treatment of <b>in</b> vivo-tolerant vessels induced an additional increase in •O 2 − production. Increased •O 2 − production in in vivo nitrate tolerant aorta is associated with activation of vascular NADH oxidase and inactivation of CuZnSOD. Therefore, <b>in</b> vivo <b>tolerance</b> can be mimicked by in vitro inhibition of CuZnSOD, but not by in vitro exposure to GTN, which does not affect vascular •O 2 − production, NADH oxidase and CuZnSOD...|$|R

500|$|Pulmonary {{toxicity}} symptoms {{result from}} an inflammation that {{starts in the}} airways leading to the lungs and then spreads into the lungs (tracheobronchial tree). The symptoms appear in the upper chest region (substernal and carinal regions). This begins as a mild tickle on inhalation and progresses to frequent coughing. If breathing increased partial pressures of oxygen continues, patients experience a mild burning on inhalation along with uncontrollable coughing and occasional shortness of breath (dyspnoea). Physical findings related to pulmonary toxicity have included bubbling sounds heard through a stethoscope (bubbling rales), fever, and increased {{blood flow to the}} lining of the nose (hyperaemia of the nasal mucosa). X-rays of the lungs show little change in the short term, but extended exposure leads to increasing diffuse shadowing throughout both lungs. Pulmonary function measurements are reduced, as noted by a reduction in the amount of air that the lungs can hold (vital capacity) and changes in expiratory function and lung elasticity. Tests in animals have indicated a variation <b>in</b> <b>tolerance</b> similar to that found in central nervous system toxicity, as well as significant variations between species.
