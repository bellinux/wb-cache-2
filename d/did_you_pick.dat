6000|$|... 'Well--no; I think I'd rather not. I {{wish you}} hadn't told me. Why <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>pick</b> {{me out to}} tell me? Why didn't you tell Nidderdale?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And where <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>pick</b> up such vulgar twaddle?" [...] Kate demanded {{with her}} clear face. [...] "How does such stuff, in this hole, get to you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>pick</b> MY leg out for?' said Mr Crimple, looking with {{something}} of an anxious expression at his limb. 'It's the same with other legs, ain't it?' ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Tramore stared, {{as if at}} a {{language}} she had never heard, a farrago, a galimatias. Her life {{was made up of}} items, but she had never had to deal, intellectually, with a fine shade. Then while her needles, which had paused an instant, began to fly again, she rejoined: [...] "Do you know what you are, my dear? You're a dreadful little prig. Where <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>pick</b> up such talk?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "So am I, {{especially}} when I hear such singing as yours; and the song, too--I like it much, for it praises the sea. Where <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>pick</b> it up?" ...|$|E
6000|$|NAPOLEON (abruptly). Where <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>pick</b> up {{all these}} vulgar scruples--this (with contemptuous emphasis) {{conscience}} of yours? I took {{you for a}} lady--an aristocrat. Was your grandfather a shopkeeper, pray? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, you {{are their}} employer, ain't you? It's {{up to you}} to see that they don't fall down. But they do fall down, and when <b>did</b> <b>you</b> ever <b>pick</b> them up? There's James--" ...|$|R

Asked how he chose the poems used in his anthologies, he said, [...] "How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>pick</b> one girl to marry? In poetry its divine polygamy. Generally, when a poem stays with {{me a long time}} that poem delivers the goods".|$|R

6000|$|... 'Oh! That fellow!' said Steerforth, {{beating a}} lump of coal {{on the top of}} the fire, with the poker. 'Is he as soft as ever? And where the deuce <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>pick</b> him up?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then my old glutton can {{gobble up}} what's left. Who taught you about them? And why," [...] she scanned me closely, [...] "why <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>pick</b> out the faintest; {{do you see}} them the best?" ...|$|E
60|$|He. No, but I object {{when you}} go on like an actress and sing stuff of that kind. Where in the world <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>pick</b> up the Chanson du Colonel? It isn't a drawing-room song. It isn't proper.|$|E
6000|$|... "Contact of {{the healthy}} with the morbid," [...] he {{explained}} dryly. [...] "You will notice {{it is the}} healthy that always has the creeps. The morbid never has the creeps.

60|$|But Stubb, he {{eats the}} whale {{by its own}} light, does he? and that is adding insult to injury, is it? Look at your knife-handle, there, my civilized and enlightened gourmand, dining off that roast beef, what is that handle made of?--what but {{the bones of the}} brother of the very ox you are eating? And what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>pick</b> your teeth with, after devouring that fat goose? With a feather of the same fowl. And with what quill did the Secretary of the Society for the Suppression of Cruelty to Ganders {{formally}} indite his circulars? It is only within the last month or two that that society passed a resolution to patronize nothing but steel pens.|$|R
5000|$|... ‘Umar ibn Al-Khaṭṭāb's {{grandfather}} Nufayl ibn Abdul Uzza arbitrated in {{a dispute}} between ‘Abdul-Muṭṭalib and Ḥarb ibn Umayyah, Abu Sufyan’s father, over the custodianship of the Kaaba. Nufayl gave his verdict in favor of ‘Abdul-Muṭṭalib. Addressing Ḥarb ibn Umayyah, he said:Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>pick</b> a quarrel with {{a person who is}} taller than you in stature; more imposing than you in appearance; more refined than you in intellect; whose progeny outnumbers yours and whose generosity outshines yours in luster? Do not, however, construe this into any disparagement of your good qualities which I highly appreciate.

6000|$|... "Whether {{you will}} be any happier higher up," [...] he went on, [...] "God knows. Sometimes I {{think you ought to}} go back to the Arcadia you came from. <b>Did</b> <b>you</b> <b>pick</b> out Spence for an embryo lord of high finance?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Where <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>pick</b> him up?" [...] Saul asked impatiently. [...] "Why did you {{waste time}} on the scoundrel? It {{would seem to me}} that after all he has done it was your {{business}} to flog, rather than make friends with him." ...|$|E
60|$|DOYLE [returning]. Where {{the devil}} <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>pick</b> up that seedy swindler? What {{was he doing}} here? [He goes {{up to the table}} where the plans are, and makes a note on one of them, {{referring}} to his pocket book as he does so].|$|E
6000|$|Now for England. I {{am glad to}} hear of the {{progress}} of 'English Bards', [...] etc. Of course, you observed I have made great additions to the new [...] edition. Have you received my picture from Sanders, Vigo Lane, London? [...] It was finished and paid for long before I left England: pray, send [...] for it. You {{seem to be a}} mighty reader of magazines: where <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>pick</b> [...] up all this intelligence, quotations, etc., etc.? Though I was happy [...] to obtain my seat without the assistance of Lord Carlisle, I had no [...] measures to keep with a man who declined interfering as my relation on [...] that occasion, and I have done with him, though I regret distressing [...] Mrs. Leigh, [4] poor thing!--I hope she is happy.|$|R
5000|$|Ralph Waite was {{reluctant}} to audition for the part of John Walton because he didn't want to be tied to a long-running TV series, but his agent persuaded him by saying, [...] "It will never sell. <b>You</b> <b>do</b> the pilot. <b>You</b> <b>pick</b> {{up a couple of}} bucks and then you go back to New York." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Well,” I said, flinging {{the door}} open and seizing her {{suddenly}} in my arms, “if you can’t walk then you shall be carried,” and I lifted her from the ground so abruptly that she could not help catching me round the neck as any child almost will <b>do</b> instinctively when <b>you</b> <b>pick</b> it up.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{that was}} what used to bother Father Joseph, and Brother Dutton," [...] Brissenden replied. [...] "Oh, no," [...] he added; [...] "I am not anything.

6000|$|... "Ah, that's very interesting," [...] said Milray, [...] "but it's not surprising. I wish I {{could see}} your face distinctly; I've a great curiosity about {{matching}} voices and faces; I must get Mrs. Milray {{to tell me}} how you look. Where <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>pick</b> up your pretty knack at reading? In school, here?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Where <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>pick</b> up this {{nonsense}} about forgiving?" [...] said her father, knitting his shaggy brows. [...] "A man does this thing or that, and the consequence follows. I couldn't forgive Bartley {{so that he}} could escape any consequence of what he's done; and you're not afraid I shall hurt him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have only}} done my duty," [...] Mary answered, quietly. [...] "I am {{supposed}} to show new helpers what to <b>do,</b> and <b>you</b> have <b>picked</b> it up very quickly. And as for the rest--don't think me unkind, but I have no room for friendships in my life just now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Do? The Little Village'll go crazy! I'll knock up {{a series}} of old-world plays for 'em. Their voices will make you laugh and cry. My God, dear men, where <b>do</b> <b>you</b> suppose they <b>picked</b> up all their misery from, on this sweet earth? I'll have a pageant of the world's beginnings, and Mosenthal shall do the music. I'll--' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, we must chance that, Hawkins. If one <b>does</b> come <b>you</b> must <b>pick</b> us {{up as we}} come along. I {{agree with}} you; it does look as if {{we should have a}} squall. It may not be {{anything}} very serious, but anyhow, if it comes it will take her along a great deal faster than we can row.|$|R
6000|$|KING. [...] "'Where <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>pick</b> up {{all these}} fine old Pieces?

[...] "Where, Edward {{in the name of}} wonder (said he) <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>pick</b> up this unmeaning gibberish? You have been studying Novels I suspect." [...] I scorned to answer: it would have been beneath my dignity. I mounted my Horse and followed by my faithful William set forth for my Aunts." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All right, boy. I understand. You {{leave that}} to me. My bunk has bin shifted for'id--more amidships--an' Kathy's well aft. They shan't be let run foul of each other.

50|$|Special guests, usually {{performers}} {{from other}} Universal Studios attractions, appeared on What Would <b>You</b> <b>Do?</b> and <b>picked</b> audience members to perform gross, silly or extraordinary stunts.

50|$|Now remember, one of {{the most}} {{important}} things in ballroom dancing is to remember to spot, otherwise you're gonna get dizzy. So, what <b>you</b> wanna <b>do</b> is <b>you</b> wanna <b>pick</b> out something to focus on. I usually like to find a lonely seaman. Then when turning, whip your head around and find your spot again. spins around Hello sailor, hello sailor, hello sailor. Now you try it.|$|R
6000|$|... "It ain't no system," [...] Shorty expounded at one {{of their}} bed-going discussions. [...] "I follow you, an' follow you, but they ain't no figgerin' it out.
