25|$|Euhedral {{crystals}} {{are those}} with obvious, well-formed <b>flat</b> <b>faces.</b> Anhedral crystals do not, usually because the crystal is one grain in a polycrystalline solid.|$|E
25|$|A {{quasicrystal}} {{consists of}} arrays of atoms that are ordered but not strictly periodic. They have many attributes {{in common with}} ordinary crystals, such as displaying a discrete pattern in x-ray diffraction, {{and the ability to}} form shapes with smooth, <b>flat</b> <b>faces.</b>|$|E
25|$|Crystals are {{commonly}} recognized by their shape, consisting of <b>flat</b> <b>faces</b> with sharp angles. These shape characteristics are {{not necessary for}} a crystal—a crystal is scientifically defined by its microscopic atomic arrangement, not its macroscopic shape—but the characteristic macroscopic shape is often present and easy to see.|$|E

These are blocks of granite up to a metre long with <b>flat</b> <b>faces</b> bearing two, three or (rarely) four circular or elliptical hollows usually around 17cm in diameter and up to about 10cm deep. Many of these mortarstones have hollows {{on more than one}} face, showing that they were turned and reused once the hollows became too deep for effective stamping.|$|E
25|$|Professor of anthropology, Akazawa Takeru of the International Research Center for Japanese Studies in Kyoto Japan, {{said that}} Mongoloid {{features}} are an {{adaptation to the}} cold of the Mammoth steppe. He mentions the Lewis waves of warm blood cyclical vasodilation and vasoconstriction of the peripheral capillaries in Mongoloids as an adaption to the cold. He lists the short limbs, short noses, <b>flat</b> <b>faces,</b> epicanthic fold and lower surface-to-mass ratio as further Mongoloid adaptations to cold.|$|E
25|$|A crystal or {{crystalline}} solid is a {{solid material}} whose constituents (such as atoms, molecules, or ions) are arranged in a highly ordered microscopic structure, forming a crystal lattice that extends in all directions. In addition, macroscopic single crystals are usually identifiable by their geometrical shape, consisting of <b>flat</b> <b>faces</b> with specific, characteristic orientations. The scientific study of crystals and crystal formation is known as crystallography. The process of crystal formation via mechanisms of crystal growth is called crystallization or solidification.|$|E

25|$|Tiwanaku monumental {{architecture}} {{is characterized by}} large stones of exceptional workmanship. In contrast to the masonry style of the later Inca, Tiwanaku stone architecture usually employs rectangular ashlar blocks laid in regular courses. Their monumental structures were frequently fitted with elaborate drainage systems. The drainage systems of the Akapana and Pumapunku structures include conduits composed of red sandstone blocks held together by ternary (copper/arsenic/nickel) bronze architectural cramps. The I-shaped architectural cramps of the Akapana were created by cold hammering of ingots. In contrast, the cramps of the Pumapunku were created by pouring molten metal into I-shaped sockets. The blocks have <b>flat</b> <b>faces</b> that {{do not need to}} be fitted upon placement because the grooves make it possible for the blocks to be shifted by ropes into place. The main architectural appeal of the site comes from the carved images and designs on some of these blocks, carved doorways, and giant stone monoliths.|$|E

2500|$|The <b>flat</b> <b>faces</b> (also called facets) of a {{euhedral}} crystal are oriented in {{a specific}} way relative to the underlying atomic arrangement of the crystal: they are planes of relatively low Miller index. This occurs because some surface orientations are more stable than others (lower surface energy). As a crystal grows, new atoms attach easily to the rougher and less stable parts of the surface, but less easily to the flat, stable surfaces. Therefore, the flat surfaces tend to grow larger and smoother, until the whole crystal surface consists of these plane surfaces. (See diagram on right.) ...|$|E

The tower contains six bells, and a clock on both east and west sides, below pointed-arch bell openings on all four sides. Two gargoyles set {{on each side of the}} tower drain the roof. On each of the four corners are ornate crocketed pinnacles, supported by slight flying buttresses attached to the Decorated [...] octagonal spire. Cox describes the church as [...] "...remarkable for the height of its slender spire...", and Kelly's, [...] "...tower and spire, remarkable for the narrowness and height of the former in proportion to the latter."

50|$|Most {{soldering}} irons for electronics have interchangeable tips, {{also known}} as bits, that vary in size and shape for different types of work. Pyramid tips with a triangular <b>flat</b> <b>face</b> and chisel tips with a wide <b>flat</b> <b>face</b> are useful for soldering sheet metal. Fine conical or tapered chisel tips are typically used for electronics work. Tips may be straight or have a bend. Concave or wicking tips with a chisel face with a concave well in the <b>flat</b> <b>face</b> to hold {{a small amount of}} solder are available. Tip selection depends upon the type of work and access to the joint; soldering of 0.5mm pitch surface-mount ICs, for example, is quite different from soldering a through-hole connection to a large area. A concave tip well is said to help prevent bridging of closely spaced leads; different shapes are recommended to correct bridging that has occurred. Due to patent restrictions not all manufacturers offer concave tips everywhere; in particular there are restrictions in the USA.|$|R

40|$|The use of {{roundwood}} in structures has drawbacks {{that include}} tapering {{and lack of}} flatness, which can be overcome by making a longitudinal cut to flatten one side. The aim of this work was to compare the mechanical behavior of roundwood vs. roundwood with one <b>flat</b> <b>face,</b> comparing pieces of small-diameter roundwood from young trees of Pinus nigra Arnold. Half the samples were given a longitudinal cut. Specimens taken from these pieces were tested for bending and compression parallel to the grain to determine their modulus of elasticity and strength. The modulus of rupture by bending was 22 % lower in roundwood with one <b>flat</b> <b>face</b> (59. 0 MPa) than in roundwood (75. 6 MPa). It has been observed that the smaller cross section in the roundwood with one <b>flat</b> <b>face</b> {{is not the only}} explanation for the decrease in the bending strength. In contrast, no significant differences were observed for the other three mechanical properties studied (compression strength parallel to the grain and modulus of elasticity in bending and compression) ...|$|R
