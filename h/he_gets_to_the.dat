5|$|After seeing {{success with}} the mouse using lizard DNA, Ratha demands Connors begin human trials immediately. Connors refuses to rush the drug-testing {{procedure}} and put innocent people at risk. Ratha fires Connors and decides to test Connors' serum at a Veterans Administration hospital {{under the guise of}} a flu shot. In an act of desperation, Connors tries the formula on himself. After passing out, he awakens to find his missing arm has regenerated. Discovering that Ratha {{is on his way to}} the VA hospital, Connors, whose skin is turning green and scaly, goes to intercept him. By the time <b>he</b> <b>gets</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Williamsburg Bridge, Connors has become a violent hybrid of lizard and man, tossing cars, including Ratha's, over the side. Peter, now calling himself Spider-Man, snatches each falling car with his web-lines.|$|E
25|$|In {{a report}} of the same match, Spanish {{newspaper}} El Mundo said: Bale combines the height and build of an 800-metre runner like Steve Ovett with the acceleration and directness of a rugby winger like Bryan Habana. And, when <b>he</b> <b>gets</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> byline, he delivers curling crosses like a Brazilian. Big words? Yes, but that's what Bale is like – easily the greatest sensation in the opening month and a half of the Champions League. Ask Maicon what he thinks after the two exhibitions Bale turned in against Inter. Yesterday he left Maicon for dead and then a wily old fox like Lúcio was left in his wake like someone trying to follow the vapour trail of an aeroplane. Three goals and two assists – against the European champions. His performances have been stunning.|$|E
25|$|Returning to his office, Marlowe {{receives}} {{a call from}} Kingsley who tells him that Crystal has called Kingsley's secretary, begging for $500. Kingsley gives the money to Marlowe to deliver. Marlowe is to wear a distinctive scarf so Crystal will recognise him, though she expects Kingsley. <b>He</b> <b>gets</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rendezvous, a bar, where a Mexican boy enters to tell Marlowe that Crystal is waiting outside. Marlowe goes out, meets Crystal and insists that she answer his questions before receiving the money. Crystal agrees but only at a nearby apartment where she is staying. At the apartment, Marlowe who has recognised her as Mrs. Fallbrook, the woman he met in Lavery's house, accuses her of being the murderer of Lavery. She pulls a gun on him. As Marlowe {{is about to take}} the gun away, someone hits him from behind with a sap.|$|E

500|$|... "Moment of Surrender" [...] {{was well}} {{received}} by critics {{after the release}} of No Line on the Horizon. David Fricke of Rolling Stone enjoyed the song, writing, [...] "The rising-falling effect of the harmony voices around Bono... is a perfect picture of where he really wants to be, when <b>he</b> <b>gets</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> line about 'vision over visibility.'" [...] Blender considered it the high-point of the album, comparing it to the band's 1987 single [...] "I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For". Reviewer Rob Sheffield complimented the melding of bass, guitar, and vocals, calling it [...] "the kind of gimme-divinity anthem that U2 cut their teeth on, except it really does seem like they've gotten better at these songs now that they've picked up some bummed-out adult grit. Bono actually sounds scared of something in this song, and whether his nightmares are religious or sexual, the fear gives his voice some heft." [...] NME felt that it was the [...] "most impressive" [...] song on the album, describing it as a [...] "gorgeously sparse prayer built around Adam Clayton's heartbeat bassline and Bono's rough growl", and noting that despite its seven-minute length, it did not feel too long. Alexis Petridis of The Guardian was more critical of the song, saying it [...] "doesn't have enough of a tune to support the full seven-minute gospel treatment", a sentiment that The Times agreed with.|$|E
500|$|Webb {{stated that}} he and the crew wanted to keep the stunts more {{grounded}} physically, a challenge for a superhuman character. The stunt performers included the Armstrong family, Vic and Andy, along with Richard Norton who plays a SWAT team member. Andy Armstrong was the stunt coordinator while Vic was the second unit director. To determine how Spider-Man should swing, Andy videotaped an Olympic Games gymnast swinging on a horizontal bar. Andy noted that in the computer-generated swing in the earlier Spider-Man films, [...] "he swings down at the same speed as he swings up," [...] and this [...] "constant" [...] speed is unlike a real gymnast's movement where [...] "he's accelerating until he reaches the bottom, then as he starts to come up, he's decelerating until <b>he</b> <b>gets</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> top of his swing and he actually gets negative gravity, where he'll go weightless for a second, and then the next swing starts, and it becomes another violent swing again." [...] Vic felt that Spider-Man's moves were comparable to those of Tarzan, and he wanted to add that in the film. While filming in New York City, they swung a man through traffic down the street. Then, while the crew built a rig hundreds of feet long over Riverside Drive in Harlem, Andy built a car rig with a series of wires to help with effects which Webb said required an [...] "incredible wealth of acrobatics". These rigs were over 200–300 feet long and demanded months of rehearsals and design. According to Andy, operating the rigs [...] "was a combination of a lot of human skills and mechanical engineering." [...] The purpose of the rigs was to depict Spider-Man's swing in a way that wasn't computer-generated. Garfield was reported to be involved with some of the stunts. Leaked pictures reveal Garfield with a nosebleed that reports claimed was from swinging. Arad explained that [...] "Andrew is not only a brilliant actor but he is a sportsman. This gave us the opportunity to try things with him that were it not so it would have been almost impossible." ...|$|E
2500|$|Coleman {{served as}} a coach in various organizations, {{beginning}} with his service as pitching coach for the Spokane Indians. [...] The Spokane club was an affiliate of the Seattle Mariners in 1980 and 1981, but became an affiliate of the California Angels in 1982. [...] In 1983, the Spokane club disbanded, and the Angels gave Coleman a choice of taking over as pitching coach in Edmonton or becoming {{the manager of the}} Peoria Suns, the Angels' newly organized Single A affiliate. [...] Coleman chose the managerial position in Peoria. [...] Coleman joked about the foibles of his young players after arriving in Peoria:"One game, my right fielder dropped a fly ball. The runner was on third by the time <b>he</b> <b>gets</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ball, but he launches it and it lands in the left field corner at the foul pole[...] [...] [...] Some crazy things have happened, but it's constant. [...] I go to the ballpark every day and expect something crazy to happen that day." ...|$|E

2500|$|Journalist Irwin Ross {{summed up}} the contradictions in Dewey's {{personality}} by noting that [...] "more than most politicians, he displayed an enormous gap between his private and his public manner. To friends and colleagues he was warm and gracious, considerate of others' views… He could tell a joke and was not dismayed by an off-color story. In public, however, he tended to freeze up, either out of diffidence or too stern {{a sense of the}} dignity of office. The smiles would seem forced… the glad-handing gesture awkward." [...] In a similar vein, a magazine writer in the 1940s described the difference between Dewey's private and public behavior by noting that [...] "Till <b>he</b> <b>gets</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> door, he may be cracking jokes and laughing like a schoolboy. But the moment he enters a room he ceases to be Tom Dewey and becomes what he thinks the Governor of New York ought to be." ...|$|E
2500|$|Voyage au Bout de la Nuit...is not to {{be placed}} quickly either as {{pastoral}} or proletarian; it is partly the 'underdog' theme and partly social criticism. The two main characters have no voice or trust in their society and no sympathy with those who have; it is this, not cowardice or poverty or low class, which the war drives home to them, {{and from then on}} they have a straightforward inferiority complex; the theme becomes their struggle with it as private individuals. ... Life may be black and mad in the second half but Bardamu is not, and <b>he</b> <b>gets</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> real end of the night as critic and spectator. This change is masked by unity of style and by a humility which will not allow that one can claim to be sane while living as part of such a world, but it is in the second half that we get Bardamu speaking as Celine in criticism of it. What is attacked may perhaps be summed up as the death-wishes generated by the herds of a machine society, and he is not speaking as 'spokesman of the proletariat' or with any sympathy for a communist one. ...before claiming the book as proletarian literature you have to separate off the author (in the phrase that Radek used) as a man ripe for fascism.|$|E
