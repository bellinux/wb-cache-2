2500|$|Third, the EU is {{formally}} {{not enabled}} to legislate on collective bargaining, although the EU, with all member states, is {{bound by the}} jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights on freedom of association. In Wilson and Palmer v United Kingdom the Court held that any detriment for membership of a trade union was incompatible with article 11, and in Demir and Baykara v Turkey the Court held [...] "the right to bargain collectively with the employer has, in principle, {{become one of the}} essential elements" [...] of article 11. This approach, which includes affirmation of the fundamental right to strike in all democratic member states, has been seen as lying in tension with some of the Court of Justice's previous case law, notably ITWF v Viking Line ABP and Laval Un Partneri Ltd v Svenska Byggnadsarbetareforbundet. These controversial decisions, quickly disapproved by legislative measures, suggested the fundamental right of workers to take collective action was subordinate to business freedom to establish and provide services. More positively, the Information and Consultation Directive 2002 requires that workplaces with over 20 or 50 staff have the right to set up elected work councils with a range of binding rights, the <b>European</b> <b>Works</b> <b>Council</b> Directive 2009 enables work councils transnationally, and the Employee Involvement Directive 2001 requires representation of workers on company boards in some European Companies. If a company transforms from a member state corporation to incorporate under the European Company Regulation 2001, employees are entitled to no less favourable representation than under the member state's existing board participation laws. This is practically important as a majority of EU member states require employee representation on company boards. Fourth, minimum job security rights are provided by three Directives. The Collective Redundancies Directive 1998 specifies that minimum periods of notice and consultation occur if more than a set number of jobs in a workplace are at risk. The Transfers of Undertakings Directive 2001 require that staff retain all contractual rights, unless there is an independent economic, technical or organisational reason, if their workplace is sold from one company to another. Last, the Insolvency Protection Directive 2008 requires that employees' wage claims are protected in the event that their employer falls insolvent. This last Directive gave rise to Francovich v Italy, where the Court of Justice affirmed that member states which fail to implement the minimum standards in EU Directives are liable to pay compensation to employees who should have rights under them.|$|E

40|$|The {{general study}} of {{institutional}} arrangements {{that are designed}} to impact on managerial prerogatives is typically cast in the genre of forms of industrial democracy. While the last few decades have seen a decline in interest in this area of study, developments in the European Union have enabled an ongoing dialogue specifically on the topic of consultation. Although consultation is generally seen by scholars as a modest form of industrial democracy, formal European Directives have provided the opportunity to assess the representative strength or otherwise of initiatives such as <b>European</b> <b>Works</b> <b>Councils</b> that are explicitly designed to address social policy and inequality in the workplace. Drawing on 41 case studies, we examine the determinants of <b>European</b> <b>Works</b> <b>Councils</b> morphology, activities undertaken and general outcomes.

This leads us to establish the primacy of management and in particular, the vector of management decision-making as the primary independent variable that predicts much about the operation and robustness of <b>European</b> <b>Works</b> <b>Councils.</b> Accordingly, we find that strong centralized management, rather than the usual suspects of differing national industrial relations systems and cultural differences, typically account for much of what we understand in terms of the role that <b>European</b> <b>Works</b> <b>Councils</b> play...|$|R

40|$|Mit der Rechtsimplementierung der europäischen Betriebsräte im September d. J. wird die Entwicklung dezentraler europäischer industrieller Beziehungen eingeleitet. Diese könnten zur Keimzelle eines komplexen europäischen Arbeitsbeziehungssystems mit einem späteren Kern an Vereinbarungs- bzw. Tarifpolitik werden. Dabei werden Spannungen zwischen den traditionellen nationalen Arbeitsbeziehungssystemen und dem neuen übernationalen Aufgabenzuschnitt der europäischen Betriebsräte entstehen. Das Problem - aber auch Innovationspotential auf diesem Feld - wird anhand von bereits freiwillig vereinbarten EBR-Regelungen an einem französischen, britischen und deutschen Fall besprochen. Die Bilanz von Chancen und Risiken der europäischen Betriebsräte ergibt, daß neben den Gefahren (Konzernsyndikalismus, Vereinnahmung der europäischen Betriebsräte durch eine Eurokonzern- Unternehmensphilosophie) auch Chancen und {{positive}} Perspektiven für die Entwicklung einer europäischen Arbeitsbeziehungsidentität in der Triadenkonkurrenz sowie intensivierte europäische Gewerkschaftskontakte und -koordination erwartet werden können.

From the second survey, we learn that <b>European</b> <b>works</b> <b>councils</b> have so far not compensated for this decrease in influence.
