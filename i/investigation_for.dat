Growing scrutiny over the city's wiretapping operation against senior leaders also likely fell mainly on Wang.

5|$|As governor, Carroll {{increased}} funding {{for public education}} and promoted the use of coal {{as a means of}} alleviating the 1973 energy crisis. He also oversaw a major reorganization of the state's judicial system following voters' approval of a constitutional amendment in 1975. Many natural and man-made disasters occurred during his term in office, including the Great Blizzard of 1978 and the Beverly Hills Supper Club fire, leading to better safety practices and stricter law enforcement in the state. When Carroll left office, both he and his predecessor were under the cloud of an <b>investigation</b> <b>for</b> an alleged insurance kickback scheme, but Carroll was not convicted of any wrongdoing. In 2004, {{he was elected to the}} Kentucky Senate. Re-elected in 2008 and 2012, he won a fourth term without opposition in 2016.|$|E
5|$|By lap 43, Romain Grosjean {{had managed}} to {{overtake}} Verstappen for tenth place. Hamilton started to lose ground on Rosberg, trailing him by 3.4 seconds on lap 44; however, he managed {{to close the gap}} in the succeeding laps. Kimi Räikkönen put in his second stop on lap 47, followed by Vettel's third just one lap later, with Rosberg reacting and changing tyres as well. Hamilton changed tyres on lap 50, and went on to set the fastest lap of the race one lap later. On lap 53, Massa moved ahead of Grosjean into eighth place, but was already reported under <b>investigation</b> <b>for</b> his pre-race tyre temperatures at that point. After serving his penalty, Maldonado managed to overtake Nasr for ninth place on lap 57. Nasr, who was utilizing a two-stop strategy, struggled with his tyres and fell back behind Ricciardo on lap 61. Ricciardo gained another position at Pérez's expense on lap 67, while Verstappen moved into tenth place one lap later, overtaking Maldonado. At the front, Hamilton's tyre started to wear off in the closing stages, enabling Rosberg to take victory 7.7 seconds ahead of his teammate.|$|E

5|$|On December 7, 1982, Kassar {{announced}} that Atari's revenue forecasts for 1982 were {{cut from a}} 50 percent increase over 1981, down to a 15 percent increase. Immediately following the announcement, Warner Communications' stock value dropped by around 35 percent—from US$54 to US$35—resulting in the company losing US$1.3billion in market valuation. Kassar sold five thousand of his Warner shares a half-hour before the announcement. This prompted an <b>investigation</b> <b>for</b> insider trading against him by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Atari attempted to regain their market share by licensing popular arcade games for the Atari consoles. The games, however, did not reverse Atari's decline and they went further into debt. In 1983, the company had decreased its workforce by 30 percent and lost US$356million. Other companies—Activision, Bally Manufacturing, and Mattel—experienced similar results as the industry declined.|$|E
5|$|Philosophy of {{psychology}} refers to {{issues at the}} theoretical foundations of modern psychology. Some of these issues are epistemological concerns about the methodology of psychological <b>investigation.</b> <b>For</b> example, is the best method for studying psychology to focus only on the response of behavior to external stimuli or should psychologists focus on mental perception and thought processes? If the latter, an important question is how the internal experiences of others can be measured. Self-reports of feelings and beliefs may not be reliable because, even in cases {{in which there is}} no apparent incentive for subjects to intentionally deceive in their answers, self-deception or selective memory may affect their responses. Then even in the case of accurate self-reports, how can responses be compared across individuals? Even if two individuals respond with the same answer on a Likert scale, they may be experiencing very different things.|$|E
5|$|Qualifying {{consisted}} of three parts, 18, 15 and 12 minutes in length respectively, with six drivers eliminated from competing after {{each of the first}} two sessions. In the first part of qualifying (Q1), the session got interrupted shortly after it had started, as Felipe Nasr came to a halt at the exit of the tunnel, caused by an engine failure. A red flag came out while the car was cleared off the track. When the running resumed, all drivers except for the two at Force India went out on the ultrasoft tyres to set their first lap times. Max Verstappen was the last to set a representative time, but touched the guardrail at the swimming pool chicane and crashed into the wall, causing another red flag period. As the session got back under way, it were the two Manor cars of Rio Haryanto and Pascal Wehrlein, as well as Jolyon Palmer and Marcus Ericsson who joined Nasr and Verstappen on the sidelines, as they were eliminated. Kevin Magnussen meanwhile barely made it into Q2, but was under <b>investigation</b> <b>for</b> exiting the pit lane while it was closed.|$|E
