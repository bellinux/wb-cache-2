25|$|There is a {{long history}} of work {{attempting}} to build ontologies for a variety of task domains, e.g., an ontology <b>for</b> <b>liquids,</b> the lumped element model widely used in representing electronic circuits (e.g.,), as well as ontologies for time, belief, and even programming itself. Each of these offers a way to see some part of the world.|$|E
25|$|Similar {{arguments}} {{could be}} used to describe the effects of pressure on viscosity, where it may be assumed that the viscosity is chiefly a function of the volume <b>for</b> <b>liquids</b> with a finite compressibility. An increasing viscosity with rise of pressure is therefore expected. In addition, if the volume is expanded by heat but reduced again by pressure, the viscosity remains the same.|$|E

25|$|TC/EA {{method is}} quick with a {{relatively}} high precision (~ 1‰). It was limited to solid samples, however, liquid sample recently can also be measured in TC/EA-IRMS system by adapting an autosampler <b>for</b> <b>liquids.</b> The drawback of TC/EA is the relatively big sample size (~ mg), which is smaller than offline combustion/reduction but larger than GC/pyrolysis. It cannot separate different compounds as GC/pyrolysis does and thus only the average for the whole sample can be provided, {{which is also a}} drawback for some research.|$|E
25|$|Involuntary {{movements}} {{may make}} feeding difficult or messy and may excessively prolong mealtimes. It {{may be easier}} to finger feed than use utensils (e.g., spoon or fork). <b>For</b> <b>liquids,</b> it is often easier to drink from a closed container with a straw than from an open cup. Caregivers may need to provide foods or liquids so that self-feeding is possible, or they may need to feed the person with A-T. In general, meals should be completed within approximately 30 minutes. Longer meals may be stressful, interfere with other daily activities, and limit the intake of necessary liquids and nutrients.|$|E
25|$|For intense {{beams of}} light (e.g. laser) {{travelling}} in a medium, {{such as an}} optical fiber, the variations in the electric field of the beam itself may induce acoustic vibrations in the medium via electrostriction or radiation pressure. The beam may display Brillouin scattering {{as a result of}} those vibrations, usually in the direction opposite the incoming beam, a phenomenon known as stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS). <b>For</b> <b>liquids</b> and gases, the frequency shifts typically created are of the order of 1–10 GHz resulting in wavelength shifts of ~1–10 pm in the visible light. Stimulated Brillouin scattering is one effect by which optical phase conjugation can take place.|$|E
