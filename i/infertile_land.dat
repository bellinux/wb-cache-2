500|$|The word Ahalya can {{be divided}} into two parts: a (a prefix {{indicating}} negation) and halya, which Sanskrit dictionaries define as being related to the plough, ploughing, or deformity. In the Uttar Kanda book of the Ramayana, the god Brahma explains the meaning of the Sanskrit word Ahalya as [...] "one without the reprehension of ugliness", or [...] "one with an impeccable beauty" [...] while telling Indra how he created Ahalya by taking the special beauty of all creation and expressing it in every part of her body. Because some Sanskrit dictionaries translate Ahalya as [...] "unploughed," [...] some recent authors view this as an implicit reference to sexual intercourse and argue that the name refers to a virgin or a motherly figure. This fits the context of the character Ahalya, who is viewed as being {{in one way or another}} beyond Indra's reach. However, Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore (1861–1941), focusing on the literal meaning of [...] "unploughed," [...] interpreted Ahalya as a symbol of stone-like, <b>infertile</b> <b>land</b> that was made cultivable by Rama. Delhi University professor Bharati Jhaveri concurs with Tagore, interpreting Ahalya as unploughed land, on the basis of the tribal Bhil Ramayana of Gujarat, an undated oral tradition.|$|E

2500|$|The moor {{consists}} of rich alluvial soil {{on a bed}} of clay, a soil which is much more thick and naturally fertile compared to most of the patchy humus in the topsoil in the large historic parishes to the east such as Ashford, Stanwell, Harmondsworth, Bedfont and Feltham, which have thin, less moist humus on gravel-rich clay, formed by the ancient terraces of the Thames {{in the same way as}} the inland parts of the riverside parishes. [...] As such rich pasture is the primary use of the land. [...] Meads would be a more accurate term, as moor implies stony land or waste (<b>infertile</b> <b>land).</b> [...] In the far south of the area mill mead was between two stream channels of the river, where the shopping centre Two Rivers has been built.|$|E

To enhance the agricultural productivity, development of <b>infertile</b> <b>lands,</b> such as saline soil and arid area, was inevitable. It was a new challenge to establish the sustainable agricultural method suitable for these <b>infertile</b> <b>lands</b> without using the so-called high energy-high yield type modern technologies. Some of the results in Japan-China Joint Research from 1990 to 1999 on sustainable agricultural production in saline soil were summarized. A major approach to attain the goal was to select tolerant species to salinity. Many kinds of seeds were collected {{from all over the world}} and selection had been continued for 10 years. A few varieties of wheat, barley, rice, beans, pasture and fruit trees were selected as a highly salt-tolerant species. Selection of varieties was time-consuming and laborious process, however, it is now understood that it is superior than production of transgenic plants on the point that the former can select most adaptable varieties that are tolerant to many kinds of stresses often encountered in the actual fields. The mechanism of salt-tolerance was also described...|$|R

2500|$|After {{meeting with}} Dona Maria Vilhena (who {{administered}} {{the island in}} the name of her young son, Rui de Teles), Van der Haegen came to an agreement and moved to the island between 1480 and 1490. Van der Haegen had arrived in the Azores in 1469 and lived for a time on Faial Island by invitation of the first Captain of Faial, Josse van Huerter. Following disagreements with van Huerter over land holdings, Van de Haegen settled in Quatro Ribeiras, Terceira until journeying to Ribeira da Cruz on Flores during the reign of King John II. [...] The historians Gaspar Frutuoso and Diogo das Chagas noted that Van der Haegen cultivated lands (primarily for wheat export) and was involved in the indigo/woad industry, as well as exploring for mineral deposits (likely silver). [...] Due to its isolated location outside shipping lanes, its intemperate climate and <b>infertile</b> <b>lands</b> he left Flores 10 years later to resettle in Terceira, by way of São Jorge Island. At the time, the name of the island was Corvo.|$|R

40|$|China {{is rapidly}} urbanizing and will inevitably face {{trade-offs}} between promoting economic growth through further urbanization and protecting fertile farmland against accelerated urban expansion. This paper presents how this dilemma is being addressed {{in one of}} the most rapidly urbanizing regions in China, the Pearl River Delta (PRD), by means of assessing urban growth and farmland dynamic, as well as their complex relationships. Land use maps derived from Landsat imagery for 1990, 2000 and 2010 show a process of accelerated urban sprawl whereby built-up lands have more than quadrupled and scattered centers have merged into megacities. Nonetheless, the land use efficiency is considerably low and is declining relative to Hong Kong and Macau with respect to urban population density. On the other hand, the spreading of urban areas on farmlands causes new farmland reclamation and accelerated deforestation in the hilly surroundings. In addition, the displaced farmlands do not ensure food production because of both reclaiming farmlands on <b>infertile</b> <b>lands</b> and diversifying farming activities from grain production to market-oriented ones. The accelerated urbanization and farmland displacement are driven by profit-oriented development strategy and ineffective land use planning. Our findings demonstrate how spatial analysis can help to investigate the integrated effects of land policies on landscape. status: publishe...|$|R
