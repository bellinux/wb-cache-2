5|$|In {{the early}} {{half of the}} 20th century, the novel Nandan, by A. Gopalasami Iyengar and G. Aravamudha Iyengar, {{includes}} reformist Brahmin characters that argue Nandan's case against their peers. Nandan also <b>echoes</b> <b>the</b> reformist ideas of Hindu spiritual leaders like Ramanuja and Vivekananda, and progressive upper-caste leaders.|$|E
5|$|King Ottokar's Sceptre {{introduced}} the recurring character of Bianca Castafiore to the series, who appears alongside her pianist Igor Wagner. It also witnessed {{the introduction of}} antagonist Colonel Jorgen, who reappears in the later Tintin adventures Destination Moon and its sequel Explorers on the Moon. The Alembek brothers' inclusion <b>echoes</b> <b>the</b> Balthazar brothers' inclusion in The Broken Ear.|$|E

50|$|The later Papadikai {{mentions}} that changes between <b>the</b> <b>echos</b> tritos and <b>the</b> <b>echos</b> plagios tetartos were bridged by the enharmonic phthora nana, and changes between <b>the</b> <b>echos</b> protos and <b>the</b> <b>echos</b> plagios devteros by the chromatic phthora nenano.|$|R
5|$|The one {{exception}} to the compactness of the quartet comes in the minuet. The minuet's first half is a standard 12 measures, but the second half is an unusually long 44 measures and involves harmonic excursions deep into the flat-side keys. The trio <b>echoes</b> <b>the</b> first and fourth movements by commencing with a B upbeat leading to an E.|$|E
5|$|The poem's {{narrative}} <b>echoes</b> <b>the</b> {{text of the}} Nunc dimittis, a liturgical {{prayer for}} Compline derived from the Gospel passage. Eliot introduces literary allusions to earlier writers Lancelot Andrewes, Dante Alighieri and St. John of the Cross. Several critics have debated whether Eliot's depiction of Simeon is a negative portrayal of a Jewish figure and evidence of anti-Semitism on Eliot's part.|$|E
5|$|Adding to {{the inner}} {{complexities}} of the picture and creating further visual interactions is the male dwarf in the foreground, whose raised hand <b>echoes</b> <b>the</b> gesture of {{the figure in the}} background, while his playful demeanour, and distraction from the central action, are in complete contrast with it. The informality of his pose, his shadowed profile, and his dark hair all serve to make him a mirror image to the kneeling attendant of the Infanta. However, the painter has set him forward of the light streaming through the window, and so minimised the contrast of tone on this foreground figure.|$|E

5|$|Gatlif {{wanted to}} {{represent}} the entire Romani community through the characterization of Félix Lavil dit Taloche's naiveté and purity. For example, Taloche is shown as being afraid of ghosts, which <b>echoes</b> <b>the</b> Romani phobia. For Taloche's role, Gatlif needed a musician with acrobatic skills, which {{was very hard to}} find. In Paris at the Théâtre de la Ville, he was impressed James Thiérrée, a grandson of Charlie Chaplin. A non-Romani, (though Chaplin's grandmother was Romani) Thiérrée learned Romanes and Romani swing music in six months.|$|E
5|$|The 2001 census also {{indicates}} that {{the population of the}} town consists of 51.1% females, and 48.9% males, which <b>echoes</b> <b>the</b> trend of Shrewsbury and Atcham borough, and that of Shropshire as a whole. According to the same census, the ethnic composition of the town is largely white, at 98.5% of the total population. The next largest ethnic group is mixed race, at 0.5% of the town's population. 0.4% of the population is Indian, Pakistani or Bangladeshi, and 0.1% of the population is South Asian or British Asian. A further 0.1% is Black, Caribbean or African.|$|E
5|$|Bat {{echolocation}} is a perceptual {{system where}} ultrasonic sounds are emitted specifically to produce echoes. By comparing the outgoing pulse with the returning <b>echoes,</b> <b>the</b> brain and auditory nervous system can produce detailed {{images of the}} bat's surroundings. This allows bats to detect, localize, and even classify their prey in complete darkness. Bat calls {{are some of the}} most intense, airborne animal sounds, and can range in intensity from between 60 and 140 decibels. Microbats use their larynx to create ultrasound, and emit the sound through their mouth and sometimes their nose. The latter is most pronounced in the horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus spp.). Microbat calls range in frequency from 14,000 to well over 100,000Hz, extending beyond the range of human hearing (between 20 and 20,000Hz).|$|E
40|$|Transorbital {{ultrasonic}} examination was deviced by <b>the</b> anthor. <b>The</b> <b>echo</b> from <b>the</b> IVth ventricle {{were obtained by}} using this method. In order to record normal echo-gram, the probe (1 MC or 2. 25 MC) was placed directly on the upper eyelid and <b>the</b> <b>echos</b> from <b>the</b> orbit, pyramid, IVth ventricle and occipital bone were recorded by this method. Clinically, this method would be applied to diagnosis of the infratentorial tumors. Abnormal echos would be obtained between <b>the</b> <b>echos</b> from <b>the</b> pyramid and the occipital bone {{on the side of}} tumor or <b>the</b> <b>echo</b> of <b>the</b> displaced IVth ventricle would be obtained...|$|R

5|$|The woman's {{hands are}} crossed tightly {{as if in}} prayer, and {{positioned}} so low in the painting as {{to appear to be}} resting on the frame. They are rendered as tightly compressed into a small area of the picture; it is likely van der Weyden did not want them to result in an area of high tone that might distract from the description of her head. Her slender fingers are minutely detailed; van der Weyden often indicated the social position of his models through his rendering of their face and hands. The sleeve of her dress extends beyond her wrists. Her fingers are folded in layers; their intricate portrayal is the most detailed element in the painting, and <b>echoes</b> <b>the</b> pyramidal form of the upper portion of the painting.|$|E
5|$|Hogarth {{replicates}} all {{the features}} of the pastoral scene in an urban landscape. The shepherds and shepherdesses become the beggars and whores, the sun overhead is replaced by the clock on the church, the snow-capped mountains become the snowy rooftops. Even the setting of Covent Garden with piles of fruit and vegetables <b>echoes</b> <b>the</b> country scene. In the centre of the picture the icy goddess of the dawn {{in the form of the}} prim churchgoer is followed by her shivering red-nosed pageboy, mirroring Hesperus, the dawn bearer. The woman is the only one who seems unaffected by the cold, suggesting it may be her element. Although outwardly shocked, the dress of the woman, which is too fashionable for a woman of her age and in the painting is shown to be a striking acid yellow, may suggest she has other thoughts on her mind. She is commonly described as a spinster, and considered to be a hypocrite, ostentatiously attending church and carrying a fashionable ermine muff while displaying no charity to her freezing footboy or the half-seen beggar before her. The figure of the spinster is said to be based on a relative of Hogarth, who, recognising herself in the picture, cut him out of her will. Fielding later used the woman as the model for his character of Bridget Allworthy in Tom Jones.|$|E

25|$|Storytelling is {{increasingly}} used in advertising today {{in order to}} build customer loyalty. According to Giles Lury, this marketing trend <b>echoes</b> <b>the</b> deeply rooted need of all humans to be entertained. Stories are illustrative, easily memorable and allow any firm to create stronger emotional bonds with the customers.|$|E
25|$|Hinduism is practised by the {{majority}} of Bali's population. The Cham people of Vietnam still practices Hinduism as well. Though officially Buddhist, many Thai, Khmer, and Burmese people also worship Hindu gods in a form of syncretism. This <b>echoes</b> <b>the</b> beliefs of the past Hindu civilizations such as the Khmer Empire.|$|E
25|$|Alison Cook, {{writing in}} the Houston Chronicle, argues the case of bacon's American {{citizenship}} by referring to historical and geographical uses of bacon. Early American literature <b>echoes</b> <b>the</b> sentiment—in Ebenezer Cooke's 1708 poem The Sot-Weed Factor, a satire of life in early colonial America, the narrator already complains that practically all the food in America was bacon-infused.|$|E

50|$|Ultrasonography (sonography) uses a probe {{containing}} multiple acoustic transducers to send {{pulses of}} sound into a material. Whenever a sound wave encounters a material {{with a different}} density (acoustical impedance), part of the sound wave is reflected back to the probe and is detected as an <b>echo.</b> <b>The</b> {{time it takes for}} <b>the</b> <b>echo</b> to travel back to the probe is measured and used to calculate the depth of the tissue interface causing <b>the</b> <b>echo.</b> <b>The</b> greater the difference between acoustic impedances, <b>the</b> larger <b>the</b> <b>echo</b> is. If <b>the</b> pulse hits gases or solids, the density difference is so great that most of the acoustic energy is reflected and it becomes impossible to see deeper.|$|R
25|$|Seventeen {{years after}} the last Western Roman Emperor was deposed, Theodoric the Great was the Ostrogothic king of Italy. His {{building}} projects largely continued existing architectural conventions. His Arian Baptistry in Ravenna (c. 500), for example, closely <b>echoes</b> <b>the</b> Baptistry of Neon built before it. Both baptistries are octagonal buildings with pyramidal roofs concealing interior domes.|$|E
25|$|On Mount Echo were {{installed}} megaphones, called “echophones” which visitors {{could use to}} bellow into the back canyons and receive a number of <b>echoes.</b> <b>The</b> “sweet spot” where the most repeaters could be heard had at least nine reverberations of anything that was shouted loud enough. The study of the sweet spot has even been used as boy scout projects.|$|E
25|$|While Arthur was {{a student}} at the Westminster School, Dee wrote a letter to his {{headmaster}} that <b>echoes</b> <b>the</b> worries of boarding school parents in every century. Arthur was an apprentice in much of his father's alchemical and scientific work, and was in fact often his scryer until Kelley came along. Arthur went on to become an alchemist and hermetic author, whose works were published by Elias Ashmole.|$|E
