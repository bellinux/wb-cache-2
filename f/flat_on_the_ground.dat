25|$|Asplenium platyneuron (syn. Asplenium ebeneum), {{commonly}} known as ebony spleenwort or brownstem spleenwort, is a fern native to North America east of the Rocky Mountains and to South Africa. It takes its common name from its dark, reddish-brown, glossy stipe and rachis (stem and leaf axis), which bear a once-divided, pinnate leaf. The fertile fronds, which die off in the winter, are darker green and stand upright, while the sterile fronds are evergreen and lie <b>flat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> An auricle {{at the base of}} each pinna points towards the tip of the frond. The dimorphic fronds and alternate, rather than opposite, pinnae distinguish it from the similar black-stemmed spleenwort.|$|E

In Pelotas, the social housings built by “Programa de Arrendamento Residencial” (Residential Leasing Program) have been studied in regard to this perspective, seeking to evaluate solutions of design and insertion of safety elements. Methods of research/ Approach: The case study is “Residencial Porto”, built by Residential Leasing Program in 2004, which has blocks built in the limit of the plot creating potential insecurity situations for 12 <b>flats</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> floor. Through <b>the</b> fieldwork, where methods and techniques of Post Occupancy Evaluation (POE) were applied, it is analysed data regarding residents´ perceptions of safety and solutions to increase safety. Results: Residents who live in flats that look at the public road have different perceptions of safety in comparison with the other residents; in this way there are <b>flats</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fourth floor with fences <b>on</b> <b>the</b> windows. Contributions/Originality: This study seeks to identify and analyse residents´ perceptions of safety and safety solutions adopted after the social housing construction was concluded...|$|R
25|$|Akilattirattu {{speaks of}} his {{incineration}} of evil spirits {{as an important}} event in Ayya Vaikundar's incarnation. It took place when he was performing his penance, which he had announced to be the means of destroying the kalimayai - the illusory evil force. He gathered the people and caused some of them, both male and female, to be possessed of the evil spirits (peyattam). The possessed ones danced {{in front of the}} crowd as if the evil spirits had come upon them. Vaikundar, then, ordered these evil spirits to make an oath, in front of the people, to surrender their powers and incinerate themselves. When he had finished his orders, the dancers fell <b>flat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> and burned.|$|E
25|$|During {{certain parts}} of the Amidah said on Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur, Ashkenazi Jews {{traditionally}} go down to the floor upon their knees and make their upper body bowed over like an arch, similar to Muslims, though not exactly in the same manner. There are some variations in Ashkenazi customs as to how long one remains in this position. Some Jews among the Dor Daim and Talmidhe haRambam understand both the Mishneh Torah and the Talmudic source texts concerning bowing in the Shemoneh Esreh to be teaching that one must always prostrate, lying <b>flat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> not only during the High Holy Days, but throughout the year during the four bows of the Amidah. It is hard to know the percentage of those who hold by the latter view, the likelihood being that most who accept such a view usually only do so in private or when praying among like-minded people.|$|E
25|$|Greek pottery also {{provides}} {{an insight into}} the daily life of prostitutes. Their representation can generally be grouped into four categories: banquet scenes, sexual activities, toilet scenes and scenes depicting maltreatment. In the toilet scenes the prostitute frequently has a less than perfect body; sagging breasts, rolls of flesh, etc. There is a kylix showing a prostitute urinating into a chamber pot. In the representation of sexual acts, {{the presence of a}} prostitute is often indicated by a purse, which underscores the financial nature of the relationship. The position most frequently shown is the leapfrog—or sodomy; these two positions being difficult to visually distinguish. The woman is frequently folded in two with her hands <b>flat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> Sodomy was considered degrading for an adult and it seems that the leapfrog position (as opposed to the missionary position) was considered less gratifying for the woman. Finally, a number of vases represent scenes of abuse, where the prostitute is threatened with a stick or sandal, and forced to perform acts considered by the Greeks to be degrading: fellatio, sodomy or sex with two partners.|$|E
50|$|Vaikundar then {{assembled}} all {{the demons}} in one place. He made some {{persons in the}} gathering, who were accustomed to ‘possession’, to get ‘possessed’ of the demons {{in the presence of}} the people. The demons that had ‘come on to these persons’ began to tremble with fear and, by making loud cries, bemoaned their end. Resigned to their fate, they requested Vaikundar to tell them the modalities to surrender. When the demons asked it themselves, Vaikundar ordered them to make an oath in front of the people that they had surrendered all their powers. Accordingly, the demons made a public oath that they had surrendered all their powers. Then they fled to the mountain and killed themselves by falling into fire. As this happened, those that were dancing due to the ‘possession’ of the demons got exhausted and fell <b>flat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>grounds.</b> As <b>the</b> crowd was witnessing all these happenings, a few shepherds, tending their flock in the mountain, came rushing and reported that they heard the loud cries of the demons as they were falling in the fire. When the crowd heard these, they appreciated the way the demons were destroyed and acknowledged that Vaikundar was really the Narayanar needed for the country.|$|R

25|$|An {{unsuccessful}} {{attempt on}} the life of the king was made on 15 November 1620. It occurred on Sunday, at 9 am, when the monarch was to attend Mass in St. John's Archcathedral in Warsaw. Sigismund was to arrive by walking on a wooden bridge-looking construction that connected the Royal Castle with the temple. When the royal procession already {{reached the end of the}} bridge, hidden in a nearby window was nobleman Michał Piekarski. The assassin previously killed a Hungarian mercenary that was protecting the post. When the monarch reached the final steps, Piekarski instantly jumped out and threw himself on the king, stabbing him twice, firstly in the back and then in the cheek, and striking him in the arm. However, the assassin was not able to cause any deadly harm because of the royal guards that were initially standing to the right of the king as Piekarski attacked from the left. Shortly after the attack, Sigismund fell <b>flat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> pale and lifeless, and from the church Priest Kobierzycki started to groan and shout – he had seen the attack from the temple's stained glass window or from the belfry. A group of local civilians and citizens surrounded the procession, the king quickly fainted, and his clothes were stained in blood. The guards were able to revive the monarch, and after medical examinations the wounds proved to be harmless. A few minutes later, panic erupted in the crowd and the air filled with the atmosphere of terror. Most of the people gathered in the church, who had arrived before the royal procession, believed that the king was already dead. Initially it was thought that the capital was invaded by the Muslim Tatars or, at least, by their spies.|$|E

If he wasn't playing with the ball he was playing with your balls." [...] He was uncomfortable in possession, and played simple balls to his nearest teammates when he found himself with the ball, whilst teammates would be reluctant to pass to him. He did however possess good awareness and heading skills, and his anticipation made up for his lack of pace.|$|E

Mr. Flambeau's semi-official <b>flat</b> was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> floor, and presented in every way a marked contrast to the American machinery and cold hotel-like luxury of the flat of the Silent Service. Flambeau, who was a friend of Angus, received him in a rococo artistic den behind his office, of which the ornaments were sabres, harquebuses, Eastern curiosities, flasks of Italian wine, savage cooking-pots, a plumy Persian cat, and a small dusty-looking Roman Catholic priest, who looked particularly out of place.|$|R
50|$|Gaultheria humifusa is {{a species}} of shrub in the heath family which is known by the common names alpine {{wintergreen}} and alpine spicy wintergreen. It is native to western North America, from British Columbia to California to Colorado, where it grows in moist subalpine mountain forests. It is a low, spreading shrub which may be quite small, forming <b>flat</b> patches <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> or amongst rock and leaf litter. The stems are less than 20 centimeters in length and have small oval-shaped leaves one to two centimeters long. It bears solitary bell-shaped flowers with white to light pink corollas and golden anthers which, after pollination, mature into bright to dull red berrylike fruit capsules. The leaves and fruit of Gaultheria humifusa are edible.|$|R
500|$|Traditional {{means of}} capture varied across the birds' range and nets and rods {{were used in}} various ingenious ways. A typical device used in the Faroes was a [...] "fleyg". This was a long pole with a net on the end laid <b>flat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> A few dead puffins were strewn around to entice {{incoming}} birds to land, and the net was flicked upwards to scoop a bird from the air as it slowed before alighting. Most of the birds caught were sub-adults, and a skilled hunter could gather two or three hundred in a day. Another method of capture, used in St Kilda, involved {{the use of a}} flexible pole with a noose on the end. This was pushed along the ground towards the intended target, which advanced to inspect the noose as its curiosity overcame its caution. A flick of the wrist would flip the noose over the victim's head and it was promptly killed, before its struggles could alarm other birds nearby.|$|E
500|$|Direct {{evidence}} of the city's condition was provided when it was filmed on 12 May 1974 by a British television news team which included the veteran journalist Peter Snow, who was reporting for Independent Television News on the disengagement negotiations. His report was broadcast on ITN's News at Ten programme. According to The Times correspondent Edward Mortimer, [...] "viewers were thus afforded {{a panoramic view of}} the city, which had stood almost completely empty since the Syrian army evacuated it in 1967. It could be seen that many of the buildings were damaged, but most of them were still standing." [...] After it was handed over, [...] "very few buildings were left standing. Most of those destroyed did not present the jagged outline and random heaps of rubble usually produced by artillery or aerial bombardment. The roofs lay <b>flat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> 'pancaked' in a manner which I am told can only be achieved by systematic dynamiting of the support walls inside." [...] Mortimer concluded that the footage [...] "establishes beyond reasonable doubt that much of the destruction took place after 12 May—at a time when there was no fighting anywhere near Kuneitra." ...|$|E
500|$|Only 35% of the Watten bunker {{had been}} {{completed}} by this time. It was clearly {{no longer possible to}} use it as a launch site, but the Germans still needed LOX production facilities to supply V-2 sites elsewhere. After surveying the site in September and October 1943, Organisation Todt engineers determined that the northern part of the facility was irretrievably damaged but decided to focus on completing the southern part to serve as a LOX factory. One of the OT's engineers, Werner Flos, came up with an idea to protect the bunker from bombardment by building it up from the roof first. This was done by initially constructing a concrete plate, <b>flat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> which was [...] thick and weighed 37,000 tons. It was incrementally raised by hydraulic jacks and then supported by walls which were built underneath it as it was raised, becoming the roof. The resulting concrete cavern was intended to be used by the Germans as a bombproof liquid oxygen factory. The thickness of the roof was chosen on the assumption that Allied bombs were incapable of penetrating such a depth of concrete; the Germans, however, were unaware of the British development of earthquake bombs.|$|E
