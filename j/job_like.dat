5|$|While {{walking in}} the woods, Andrei and Foma have a {{conversation}} about Foma’s faults, especially lying. Foma confesses to taking honey from the bee garden, after Andrei notices his cassock is tacky, and smears mud on his face to soothe a bee sting. While Foma has talent as an artist, he is less concerned with the deeper meaning of his work and more concerned with practical aspects of the <b>job,</b> <b>like</b> perfecting his azure, a colour which in painting was often considered unstable to mix. They encounter Theophanes in the forest, and the old master sends Foma away. As he leaves, the apprentice finds a dead swan and pokes at it with a stick. We cut to banks of a stream where Andrei and Theophanes are arguing about religion, while Foma cleans his master's paint brushes. Theophanes argues that the ignorance of the Russian people is due to stupidity, while Andrei says that he doesn’t understand how {{he can be a}} painter and maintain such views. This section contains a reenactment of Christ's Crucifixion on a snow-covered hillside which plays out as Andrei recounts the story and expresses his belief that the men who crucified Jesus were obeying God's will and loved him.|$|E

I loved doing the morning show for 2½ years but I am also looking forward to not getting up at 4 am any more. If you've ever had a morning <b>job</b> <b>like</b> this, you {{probably}} know the relief I feel, but I will still miss seeing Liz and Jose every day, having David Lynch as my weatherman, and talking to Timothy Olyphant about sports each morning. These will always rank with the coolest things I’ve ever been fortunate enough to do in my entire life.|$|E
25|$|Reality {{and fiction}} {{sometimes}} meet in La <b>Job,</b> <b>like</b> in its American counterpart, the actual studios {{are located in}} Côte-de-Liesse (part of the Saint-Laurent borough in Montreal), near Autoroute 20, where the Papiers Jennings branch {{is located in the}} series. Some scenes have also been shot at the Bar Zeffé, a bar located near the main set that keeps its real name within the show. Built for the series, the shooting set is said to be ready to be converted into a real office space overnight. Shooting is done without spotlights, only with the office fluorescent lights. The neighbourhood paper Saint-Laurent News provides the show with fake newspapers used in filming.|$|E

500|$|Root {{made her}} {{theatrical}} film debut playing Anne Elliot, the film's protagonist. According to Root, [...] "every actress in England" [...] read for the part. Having {{worked with the}} director previously on the 1993 TV serial The Buddha of Suburbia, Root won the role by writing him a letter to gain an audition. The character was described to Root as [...] "haggard", which attracted the actress. [...] "I relish a <b>job</b> <b>like</b> this, starting off downtrodden and gradually blossoming", she said. WGBH Boston, the American company co-producing the film, had wanted a better known actress for the part but agreed to Root's casting after seeing Root's screen test.|$|E
500|$|Welling {{was cast}} in the WB superhero drama Smallville after a {{nationwide}} search for an actor to play Clark Kent. In {{an interview with a}} teen magazine, Welling spoke about the day he auditioned for the role: [...] "I was on my way back from the Warner Bros. studio, and I stopped in a gas station to call my manager and tell him how it went. I called and got him on the phone and he said, 'Can you hold on a second?' Next thing I know, there are literally seven people on the other line and almost in unison they say, 'Tom, you got it!'" [...] The pilot aired in October 2001 and became the highest rated debut for The WB, with 8.4 million viewers. Welling told TV Guide that he turned down the lead role twice, but after reading the script, decided to take the <b>job.</b> <b>Like</b> Christopher Reeve, he was not a Superman fan prior to being cast as Clark Kent. In fact, he said, he continues to not read Superman comics: [...] "I made a conscious decision to stay away from that material. We're doing something different at a time before all that, I don't want that to affect what I'm doing, even subconsciously." [...] He did get the chance to meet two previous Superman actors: Christopher Reeve, who appeared in season 2: episode 17 titled [...] "Rosetta", and Dean Cain, who appeared in season 7: episode 4 titled [...] "Cure".|$|E

2500|$|Jeremiah's [...] "confessions" [...] are {{a type of}} {{individual}} lament. Such laments are found elsewhere in the psalms and the Book of <b>Job.</b> <b>Like</b> Job, Jeremiah curses {{the day of his}} birth (Jer. 20:14–18 and Job 3:3–10). Likewise, Jeremiah's exclamation [...] "For I hear the whispering of many: Terror is all around!" [...] (Jer. 20:10) matches Psalm 31:13 exactly. However, Jeremiah's laments are made unique by his insistence that he has been called by Yahweh to deliver his messages. These laments [...] "provide a unique look at the prophet's inner struggle with faith, persecution, and human suffering".|$|E
2500|$|On March 29, 2006 Sampson {{was named}} the head coach at Indiana University {{following}} the resignation of Mike Davis. Sampson was the second minority coach {{in the history of}} the Hoosier basketball program behind Mike Davis. Upon taking the reins of the Indiana Hoosiers he noted, [...] "I love my job at Oklahoma and I would not leave OU for any job unless it was a <b>job</b> <b>like</b> Indiana. My family and I have had 12 great years at Oklahoma, the best years of our life, but Indiana is one of the great programs in college basketball and if they call and offer, it is a job as a coach that you have to take." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1917, Buckland {{wrote to}} Cecil B. DeMille expressing his dissatisfaction over having his artistic vision stifled. [...] He said, [...] "I came to Hollywood ... {{in search of}} a chance to {{visualize}} a more 'pictorial' way, by adapting to film the same rules that govern the higher art of painting." [...] Buckland also complained in the press that the art director's <b>job,</b> <b>like</b> that of the actor, suffered from over-production. [...] Buckland noted that he had supervised 56 pictures in a single year and added, [...] "Studio necessities compel him to supervise the art work on a number of productions at one time. [...] As a consequence, the art director becomes an architect, or perhaps merely a scenic artist, instead of the illustrator of the dramatic story." ...|$|E

2500|$|After filming {{ended on}} the series Mercy Peak, Bartolomei {{decided he would}} stay in New Zealand rather than {{returning}} to Australia and was offered {{the role of a}} new character – Craig Valentine on Shortland Street, who was set to undergo a steamy romance with the upcoming character Sarah Potts. Bartolomei decided to leave the soap in 2008, saying, [...] "It was a very difficult decision, from an actor's point of view it's not very often that you have the security that a <b>job</b> <b>like</b> Shortland Street provides. But after {{four and a half years}} I longed for a degree of anonymity again. I'm a very private person, and given what I do for a job, the spectre of Shortland Street will invariably take that away from you." [...] The character was killed off in a dramatic gang storyline, something which producers at first thought would be [...] "unforgivable" [...] but which, due to Bartolomei's iinsistence on leaving, they went through with. Bartolomei said of the storyline, [...] "It's all a bit of fun and it's nice to see the characters away from the normal hospital setting and involved in something a little bit different," [...] and of the conclusion to Sarah and Craig's romance, [...] "That does get revisited but not in a stereotypical way. There is a great deal of resolution at the end for everyone concerned." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2011, {{the child}} Isabella and Paul had, Ricky Williams was re-introduced {{to the series}} as an adult, now portrayed by Pete Porte. The role had been {{dramatically}} rapidly aged over the duration of 8 years to an adult. Adam Hughes of Yahoo! stated that bringing the character back would work well, he wrote: [...] "Regardless of his initial motivation for heading back to Wisconsin, Ricky will undoubtedly open up many old wounds and many new story line possibilities. Will he angrily confront Paul? Will Isabella manage to return home, as well, to see her big boy?" [...] Doug Davidson stated that Paul harbored possible guilt in regards to Ricky's upbringing, having been raised by his grandparents. Lauralee Bell spoke about the love triangle between Paul, Christine and Isabella {{and what kind of}} twists would occur through Ricky returning. She said: [...] "That whole Isabella thing was a very scary time for Chris and Paul and now they wonder if there's something off about Ricky. At first, no one knew Isabella was crazy. He could be a whack <b>job</b> <b>like</b> his mother. Time will tell. But seeing Ricky {{for the first time as}} a man is really startling for Chris. And for me, too." [...] Ultimately, Ricky turned out to be psychotic like his mother and was killed by his own father Paul to prevent him from killing Eden Baldwin (Jessica Heap).|$|E
