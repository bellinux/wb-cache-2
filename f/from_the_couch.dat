In an attempt to appease Dahmer, Edwards unbuttoned his shirt, saying he {{would allow him to}} do so if he would remove the handcuffs and put the knife away. In response to this promise, Dahmer simply turned his attention towards the TV; Edwards observed Dahmer rocking back and forth and chanting before turning his attention back to him: he placed his head on Edwards' chest, listened to his heartbeat and, with the knife pressed against his intended victim, informed Edwards he intended to eat his heart. In continuous attempts to prevent Dahmer from attacking him, Edwards repeated that he was Dahmer's friend and {{that he was not going}} to run away. (Edwards had decided he was going to either jump from a window or run through the unlocked front door upon the next available opportunity.) When Edwards next stated he needed to use the bathroom, he asked if they could sit with a beer in the living room, where there was air conditioning, to which Dahmer consented, and the pair walked to the living room when Edwards exited the bathroom. Inside the living room, Edwards waited until he observed Dahmer have a momentary lapse of concentration before requesting to use the bathroom again. When Edwards rose <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch,</b> he noted Dahmer was not holding the handcuffs, whereupon Edwards punched him in the face, knocking Dahmer off balance, and ran out the front door.|$|E
500|$|Kurt M. Koenigsberger {{analyzed}} a {{scene from}} the episode in his piece [...] "Commodity Culture and Its Discontents", published in the compilation work [...] edited by John Alberti. He commented that The Simpsons literary and cultural awareness extends to the [...] "conventions of its own medium" [...] in this episode. Bart criticizes an Itchy & Scratchy episode because Itchy stakes down Scratchy's appendages and props his belly to form a tent with faulty knots. With Homer looking on <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch,</b> Lisa reminds Bart that cartoons do not simply reproduce reality, a point hammered on as a second Homer meanders past the living-room window. Koenigsberger said that [...] "this moment and many others like it reveal a strong sense of self-awareness within the show, an awareness especially characteristic of high modernism." ...|$|E
2500|$|The eyewitnesses, {{students}} named Jacques Price and Sam Smilovitz (sometimes called Jack Price and Sam Smiley), proffered {{accounts of}} the incident that generally corroborated one another. Price describes Whitehead asking Houdini [...] "if he believed in the miracles of the Bible" [...] and [...] "whether {{it was true that}} punches in the stomach did not hurt him". He then delivered [...] "some very hammer-like blows below the belt". Houdini was reclining on a couch at the time, having broken his ankle while performing several days earlier. Price states that Houdini winced at each blow and stopped Whitehead suddenly {{in the midst of a}} punch, gesturing that he had enough, and adding that he had no opportunity to prepare himself against the blows, as he did not expect Whitehead to strike him so suddenly and forcefully. Had his ankle not been broken, he would have risen <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> into a better position to brace himself.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the most}} {{frequently}} used images of King Kong in popular culture is the scene where King Kong and Ann Darrow are on top of the Empire State Building. This image has been copied or parodied in cartoons, comic books, horror films, and television commercials. A popular television spoof was the segment 'King Homer' from The Simpsons episode [...] "Treehouse of Horror III", in which the King Kong story was retold featuring Simpsons characters, with Homer as Kong, Marge as Ann Darrow and Mr. Burns as the Carl Denham analogues. The spoof follows the plot of the 1933 film closely; however, it ends with Marge marrying King Homer after he collapses in exhaustion, failing to climb beyond the second story of the Springfield State Building. King Kong's family, consisting of smaller apes, appear at the wedding, and Homer has a habit of eating people, at the end he eats Marge's father. King Homer also has a cameo in the music video for [...] "Deep Deep Trouble" [...] from The Simpsons Sing the Blues CD, and years later, makes another appearance in the opening couch gag of [...] "Jazzy and the Pussycats." [...] Homer grabs Marge <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> and scales the Empire State Building, all while fending off 1930s-style airplanes. King Homer (or Homer Kong) would reappear battling Bridezilla (a Godzilla version of Marge Simpson) in the episode Wedding for Disaster. The character also appeared in video games such as Bart's Nightmare and Treehouse of Horror (video game) as well as various merchandise such as toys and T-shirts. The original film was referenced again on The Simpsons in the episode [...] "Monty Can't Buy Me Love", where Mr. Burns captures the Loch Ness Monster and brings him back to America to entertain an audience; however, instead of the Monster going berserk during its debut, Burns himself is startled by the flash photography and causes the carnage.|$|E

30|$|The Complexe Dolomitique is {{composed}} of two units, the upper Couche Rouge and the lower Zone Dolomitique. <b>The</b> transition <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Couches</b> de Pechelbronn to the Couche Rouge {{is marked by a}} sudden increase in red clays and a decrease in the calcimetry. This massive red clay unit (65  m) gradually transitions into the Zone Dolomitique composed of clays, marls and limestones interbedded with thin sandstone beds. The gradual increase in the presence of salt, observed on the calcimetry log, definitively signals the transition to the Zone Dolomitique unit (Aichholzer et al. 2015). The salt and the thin sandstone beds are observed on the GR log because they induces obvious deviations in the signal towards the less radioactive side (peak leftwards compared to the signal above the formation, more homogeneous).|$|R

6000|$|I do not {{remember}} how long I slept.

60|$|But, by degrees, a {{sense of}} wonder had its will, and grew, slowly at first, in Redclyffe's mind; and almost twin-born with it, and growing piece by piece, there was {{a sense of}} awful fear, as his waking senses came slowly back to him.

Though Mrs Parker denies all, Robinson sees it as vindication of his own family background, and claims all he needs is a hundred pounds to buy a share in a business. Uncle Fred provides the money at once, and Robinson and Julia leave delighted, the pretty girl peppering Fred with kisses as she leaves.|$|R
