40|$|An {{approach}} is proposed which improves {{the quality and}} speed of manual loop shaping. Loop shaping is an iterative and creative controller design procedure where the control engineer uses frequency response function (FRF) <b>data</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> to shape the open loop response such that it satisfies stability, performance and robustness specifications.
