25|$|The {{original}} main {{instrument of}} the observatory, housed in the dome, was a 280mm refractor with a <b>focal</b> <b>distance</b> of 4.9 m. In 1895, this telescope {{was replaced by a}} 360mm refractor with a focal length of 4.9 m and a 200mm photographic lens with a focal length of 4.8 m. The purchase of the double refractor enabled the observatory to participate in photographic observations without having to give up visual observations. This double refractor is still found in the dome of the Østervold Observatory, while the 1861 refractor is displayed at the Steno Museum in Århus.|$|E
25|$|Electron lenses are {{designed}} {{to act in a}} manner emulating that of an optical lens, by focusing parallel electrons at some constant <b>focal</b> <b>distance.</b> Electron lenses may operate electrostatically or magnetically. The majority of electron lenses for TEM use electromagnetic coils to generate a convex lens. The field produced for the lens must be radially symmetrical, as deviation from the radial symmetry of the magnetic lens causes aberrations such as astigmatism, and worsens spherical and chromatic aberration. Electron lenses are manufactured from iron, iron-cobalt or nickel cobalt alloys, such as permalloy. These are selected for their magnetic properties, such as magnetic saturation, hysteresis and permeability.|$|E

40|$|We {{studied the}} use of Talbot pattern {{illumination}} in scanning optical microscopy (SOM). Unlike conventional illumination spots used in SOM, the focal spots in Talbot pattern are more complicated {{and do not have}} a simple Gaussian intensity distribution. To find out the resolution of SOM using Talbot pattern, we characterized the evolution of the full-width-at-half-maximum spot size of the Talbot focal spots by computer simulation. We then simulated the SOM imaging under Talbot pattern illumination using the razor blade and the U. S. Air Force target as the sample objects, and compared the results with those performed with Gaussian spots as illumination. Using several foci searching algorithms, the optimal <b>focal</b> <b>distances</b> were found to be shorter than the theoretical Talbot distances. The simulation results were consistent with the experiment results published previously. We then provide a practical guidance for searching for optimal <b>focal</b> <b>distances</b> in the SOM based on these studies...|$|R

60|$|It were a {{pleasant}} inquiry to follow into detail their ministry to our education, but where would it stop? We are associated in adolescent and adult life with some friends, who, like skies and waters, are coextensive with our idea; who, answering each {{to a certain}} affection of the soul, satisfy our desire on that side; whom we lack power to put at such <b>focal</b> <b>distance</b> from us, that we can mend or even analyze them. We cannot choose but love them. When much intercourse with a friend has supplied us with a standard of excellence, and has increased our respect for the resources of God who thus sends a real person to outgo our ideal; when he has, moreover, become an object of thought, and, whilst his character retains all its unconscious effect, is converted in the mind into solid and sweet wisdom,--it is a sign to us that his office is closing, and he is commonly withdrawn from our sight in a short time.|$|E
60|$|Fragments of the scoriae {{embedded}} in the calcareous mass, when broken, exhibit many of their cells lined and partly filled with a white, delicate, excessively fragile, moss-like, or rather conferva-like, reticulation of carbonate of lime. These fibres, examined under a lens of one-tenth of an inch <b>focal</b> <b>distance,</b> appear cylindrical; they are rather above one- thousandth of an inch in diameter; they are either simply branched, or more commonly united into an irregular mass of network, with the meshes of very unequal sizes and of unequal numbers of sides. Some of the fibres are thickly covered with extremely minute spicula, occasionally aggregated into little tuffs; and hence they have a hairy appearance. These spicula are of the same diameter throughout their length; they are easily detached, so that the object-glass of the microscope soon becomes scattered over with them. Within the cells of many fragments of the scoria, the lime exhibits this fibrous structure, but generally in a less perfect degree. These cells {{do not appear to}} be connected with one another. There can be no doubt, as will presently be shown, that the lime was erupted, mingled with the lava in its fluid state, and therefore I have thought it worth while to describe minutely this curious fibrous structure, of which I know nothing analogous. From the earthy condition of the fibres, this structure does not appear to be related to crystallisation.|$|E
6000|$|But we {{may fancy}} {{that we see}} or feel what we in reality infer. A truth, or {{supposed}} truth, which is really {{the result of a}} very rapid inference, may seem to be apprehended intuitively. It has long been agreed by thinkers of the most opposite schools, that this mistake is actually made in so familiar an instance as that of the eyesight. There is nothing of which we appear to ourselves to be more directly conscious than the distance of an object from us. Yet it has long been ascertained, that what is perceived by the eye, is at most nothing more than a variously colored surface; that when we fancy we see distance, all we really see is certain variations of apparent size, and degrees of faintness of color; that our estimate of the object’s distance from us is the result partly of a rapid inference from the muscular sensations accompanying the adjustment of the <b>focal</b> <b>distance</b> of the eye to objects unequally remote from us, and partly of a comparison (made with so much rapidity that we are unconscious of making it) between the size and color of the object as they appear at the time, and the size and color of the same or of similar objects as they appeared when close at hand, or when their degree of remoteness was known by other evidence. The perception of distance by the eye, which seems so like intuition, is thus, in reality, an inference grounded on experience; an inference, too, which we learn to make; and which we make with more and more correctness as our experience increases; though in familiar cases it takes place so rapidly as to appear exactly on a par with those perceptions of sight which are really intuitive, our perceptions of color.(5) ...|$|E

60|$|Dream {{delivers}} us to dream, {{and there}} is no end to illusion. Life is a train of moods like a string of beads, and as we pass through them they prove to be many-colored lenses which paint the world their own hue, and each shows only what lies in its focus. From the mountain you see the mountain. We animate what we can, and we see only what we animate. Nature and books belong to the eyes that see them. It depends on the mood of the man whether he shall see the sunset or the fine poem. There are always sunsets, {{and there is}} always genius; but only a few hours so serene that we can relish nature or criticism. The more or less depends on structure or temperament. Temperament is the iron wire on which the beads are strung. Of what use is fortune or talent to a cold and defective nature? Who cares what sensibility or discrimination a man has at some time shown, if he falls asleep in his chair? or if he laugh and giggle? or if he apologize? or is infected with egotism? or thinks of his dollar? or cannot go by food? or has gotten a child in his boyhood? Of what use is genius, if the organ is too convex or too concave and cannot find a <b>focal</b> <b>distance</b> within the actual horizon of human life? Of what use, if the brain is too cold or too hot, and the man does not care enough for results to stimulate him to experiment, and hold him up in it? or if the web is too finely woven, too irritable by pleasure and pain, so that life stagnates from too much reception without due outlet? Of what use to make heroic vows of amendment, if the same old law-breaker is to keep them? What cheer can the religious sentiment yield, when that is suspected to be secretly dependent on the seasons of the year and the state of the blood? I knew a witty physician who found the creed in the biliary duct, and used to affirm that if there was disease in the liver, the man became a Calvinist, and if that organ was sound, he became a Unitarian. Very mortifying is the reluctant experience that some unfriendly excess or imbecility neutralizes the promise of genius. We see young men who owe us a new world, so readily and lavishly they promise, but they never acquit the debt; they die young and dodge the account; or if they live they lose themselves in the crowd.|$|E
