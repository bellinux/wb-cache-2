40|$|Preventing plant invasions or eradicating {{incipient}} populations is {{much less}} costly than confronting large well-established populations of invasive plants. We developed a preliminary <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> <b>plants</b> that pose the greatest risk of becoming invasive in California, primarily through the horticultural industry. We identified 774 species that are invasive elsewhere in Mediterranean climates but not yet invasive in California. From this list, we determined which species are sold through the horticulture industry, whether they are sold in California and whether they have been reported as naturalized in California. We narrowed the list to 186 species with the greatest potential for introduction and/or invasiveness to California through the horticultural trade. This study provides a basis for determining species to evaluate further through a more detailed risk assessment that may subsequently prevent importation via the horticultural pathway. Our results can also help land managers know which species to watch for in wildlands...|$|E
40|$|Background: Increasing {{anthropogenic}} {{influences on}} the environment, especially urbanization, have caused adverse effects on the natural ecosystems. As a result, green campuses have become rare places where {{the characteristics of the}} area flora can be observed. In this context, the aim of the present study is to identify the floral richness of the campus of the Buca Faculty of Education (BEF), an important floristic area within the city of Izmir, and to clarify how this richness is used in the educational processes. Method: The study was carried out between the periods 2008 - 2010. Plants growing on the BEF Campus constitute the research material. Plants growing on the campus were examined, necessary samples were collected. After the <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> <b>plants,</b> how they were used in B. Sc., M. Sc. and Ph.

The frame of prototype nursery house {{was made of}} galvanized pipe and it was covered with UV-resistance nylon net (32 mesh). Optimum temperature and relative humidity in the prototype nursery house were automatically controlled. It was compared with a commercial nethouse (6 × 9 × 4. 40 m) and a shade house (4 × 6 × 2. 50 m). The capacity of the prototype nursery house, commercial nethouse and shade house was assessed by growth <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> <b>plants</b> grown inside for 3 months. The plant materials used for testing were Troyer seedlings, Shogun mandarin mother plants and Neck orange nursery trees. It {{was found that the}} plants grown in the prototype nursery house and commercial nethouse exhibited significantly higher growth than those plants in the shade house. Differences of temperature and relative humidity in the prototype nursery house, commercial nethouse and shade house were evaluated. It was prominent that the temperature and relative humidity during the experimental period in the commercial nethouse were highest, while they were lowest in the shade house. An occurrence of canker diseases markedly increased in the commercial nethouse because of high humidity and temperature. Leaf destruction by main insect pests wasa serious problem in the shade house. From the results, it is suggested that the prototype nursery house is suitable for producing disease free citrus propagation materials in southern Thailand...|$|E

40|$|Non-invasive {{and rapid}} <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> <b>plant</b> biomass would be {{beneficial}} {{for a number of}} research aims. Here, we present a novel device to non-invasively determine plant water content as a proxy for plant biomass. It is based on changes of dielectric properties inside a microwave cavity resonator induced by inserted plant material. The water content of inserted shoots leads to a discrete shift in the centre frequency of the resonator. Calibration measurements with pure water showed good spatial homogeneity in the detection volume of the microwave resonators and clear correlations between water content and centre frequency shift. For cut tomato and tobacco shoots, linear correlations between fresh weight and centre frequency shift were established. These correlations were used to continuously monitor diel growth patterns <b>of</b> intact <b>plants</b> and to determine biomass increase over several days. Interferences from soil and root water were excluded by shielding pots with copper. The presented proof of principle shows that microwave resonators are promising tools to quantitatively detect the water content <b>of</b> <b>plants</b> and to determine plant biomass.

30|$|Plant {{architecture}} {{is a major}} factor underlying grain yield and <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> <b>planting</b> density and photosynthesis efficiency in rice. The molecular mechanisms <b>of</b> <b>plant</b> architecture have been extensively studied and many critical genes have been identified. Most of these genes are involved in the Auxin and BR pathways. Auxin and BR signaling share many transcriptional target genes in regulating rice plant architecture (Yin et al. 2002; Nemhauser et al. 2004), suggesting that interactions between TFs involved in auxin and BR signaling might act as the points of auxin–BR crosstalk, but only a few examples have been reported. One is the response of SAUR 15 to auxin and BR. SAUR 15 expression depends on the simultaneous interaction of BES 1 and ARF 5 within the promoter of the SAUR 15, gene that produces a hormone with an Up at Dawn (HUD)-type E-box and AuxRE cis elements (Walcher and Nemhauser 2012). Another example is that BZR 1 and ARF 6 were shown to interact and regulate a large number of common target genes (Oh et al. 2014).|$|R

40|$|The {{problem has}} its {{origin in the}} {{empirical}} nature of existing methods for the chemical <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> <b>plant</b> lignin. It is generally recognized that the apparent lignin content <b>of</b> <b>plant</b> tissues depends largely on the pretreatments employed, and on the method and conditions of final isolation of the lignin. By using various pretreatments and carefully regulating the conditions <b>of</b> the final <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> lignin, methods have been developed which give reproducible results on any given tissue. However, the apparent lignin content of any particular tissue may vary greatly, depending on the method used for its determination.

In this connection, special {{attention has been paid to}} obtaining a lignin relatively free from nitrogen, and also, to the prevention of changes in the lignin itself during its isolation. The most commonly used criteria <b>of</b> <b>plant</b> lignin purity have been its nitrogen and methoxyl contents. As an additional criterion of the purity of isolated lignin ultraviolet absorption spectra of lignin solutions have been studied.

The effects of microcystins (MCYs), {{a family of}} peptide type protein-phosphatase inhibitors and cylindrospermopsin (CYN), an alkaloid type of protein synthesis blocker {{will be discussed in}} this review. We are focusing mainly on cyanotoxin-induced changes of chromatin organization and their possible cellular mechanisms. The particularities <b>of</b> <b>plant</b> cells explain the importance of such studies. Preprophase bands (PPBs) are premitotic cytoskeletal structures important in the <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> <b>plant</b> cell division plane. Phragmoplasts are cytoskeletal structures involved in plant cytokinesis. Both cyanotoxins induce the formation of multipolar spindles and disrupted phragmoplasts, leading to abnormal sister chromatid segregation during mitosis. Thus, MCY and CYN are probably inducing alterations of chromosome number. MCY induces programmed cell death: chromatin condensation, nucleus fragmentation, necrosis, alterations of nuclease and protease enzyme activities and patterns. The above effects may be related to elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) and/or disfunctioning of microtubule associated proteins. Specific effects: MCY-LR induces histone H 3 hyperphosphorylation leading to incomplete chromatid segregation and the formation of micronuclei. CYN induces the formation of split or double PPB directly related to protein synthesis inhibition. Cyanotoxins are powerful tools in the study <b>of</b> <b>plant</b> cell organization...|$|R
