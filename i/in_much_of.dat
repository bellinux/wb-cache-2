5|$|The Andes play {{a crucial}} role in {{determining}} the climate of Patagonia because their north–south orientation creates a barrier for humid air masses coming from the Pacific Ocean. Since the predominant wind is from the west and most air masses come from the Pacific Ocean, the Andes cause these air masses to ascend, cooling adiabatically. Most of the moisture is dropped on the Chilean side, resulting in abundant precipitation, while <b>in</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> the Argentine side, the air warms adiabatically and becomes drier as it descends. As a result, the Andes create an extensive rain-shadow <b>in</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> Argentine Patagonia, causing most of the region to be arid. South of 52oS, the Andes are lower in elevation, reducing the rain shadow effect in Tierra del Fuego Province, allowing forests to thrive on the Atlantic coast.|$|E

5|$|Traditional Victorian dancing fairies and elves appear <b>in</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> Tolkien's early poetry, {{and have}} {{influence}} upon his later works {{in part due}} to the influence of a production of J.

In several interviews, despite the box office failure, the directors have expressed their interest in a possible sequel to the film due to its critical acclaim and successful home media sales. Three spin-off films were later made, based on Grindhouses fake trailers: Machete, Machete Kills and Hobo with a Shotgun.|$|E

5|$|Although Kepler's {{calculations}} {{indicated that}} the 1631 transit of Venus would best be visible from the American continent, he was not fully confident of his prediction, and advised that European astronomers {{should be prepared to}} observe the event. Gassendi and others in Europe watched for it but, as predicted, the Sun was below the horizon during the transit. According to modern calculations, observers <b>in</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> Italy and along the eastern Mediterranean {{should have been able to}} view the last stage of the transit, but no such observations were recorded. Kepler had predicted a near miss for a Venus transit in 1639 and, as the next full transit was not expected for another 121years, Gassendi and the other astronomers concentrated their efforts in other areas.|$|E
5|$|Although both colour morphs occur <b>in</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> the European range, brown birds predominate in {{the more}} humid climate of western Europe, with the grey phase {{becoming}} more common further east; in the northernmost regions, all the owls are a cold-grey colour. Siberian and Central Asian subspecies have grey and white plumage, the North African race is dark grey-brown, and South and East Asian birds have barred, not striped, underparts, and fine lines around the facial disc. The Siberian and Scandinavian subspecies are 12% larger and 40% heavier, and have 13% longer wings than western European birds, in accordance with Bergmann's rule which predicts that northern forms will typically be bigger than their southern counterparts.|$|E
5|$|Although {{poliovirus}} transmission {{has been}} interrupted <b>in</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> the world, transmission of wild poliovirus does continue and creates an ongoing {{risk for the}} importation of wild poliovirus into previously polio-free regions. If importations of poliovirus occur, outbreaks of poliomyelitis may develop, especially in areas with low vaccination coverage and poor sanitation. As a result, high levels of vaccination coverage must be maintained. In November 2013, the World Health Organization announced a polio outbreak in Syria. In response, the Armenian government put out a notice asking Syrian Armenians under age 15 to get the polio vaccine. As of 2014, polio virus has spread out to ten countries mainly in Africa, Asia and the Middle East with Pakistan, Syria and Cameroon advising vaccinations to outbound travelers.|$|E
