5|$|A {{laboratory}} test showed how males of P. fimbriata from Queensland minimise {{the risk of}} meeting each other, by recognising fresh pieces of blotting paper, some containing their own silk <b>draglines</b> and some containing another male's <b>draglines.</b> Males also were attracted by fresh blotting paper containing females' <b>draglines,</b> while females {{do not respond to}} fresh blotting paper containing males' <b>draglines.</b> This suggested that the males usually search for females, rather than vice versa. Neither sex responded to one week-old blotting paper, irrespective of whether it contained males' or females' <b>draglines.</b> A similar series of tests showed that P. labiata showed the same patterns of responses between the sexes.|$|E
5|$|Females of many spider species, {{including}} P. labiata, emit volatile pheromones {{into the}} air, and these generally attract males from a distance. The silk <b>draglines</b> of female jumping spiders also contain pheromones, which stimulate males to court females and may give information about each female's status, for example whether the female is juvenile, subadult or mature.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many species}} of spider, a P. schultzi lays a {{continuous}} dragline of silk as it moves, {{and from time to}} time anchors the dragline to a surface with a spot of sticky silk. This allows the spider to return to the surface if the animal is dislodged. A spider about to jump first lays a sticky silk anchor, and then lays out a dragline as it flies. Unlike those of most jumping spiders, P. schultzi′s <b>draglines</b> stick to each other and, when a P. schultzi has laid a few lines across a gap, it uses these as walkways and reinforces them with additional silk as it moves.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: This study, {{in a broad}} sense, {{fills in}} the missing parts in {{previous}} efforts at pullback stripping mode design with a dipping coal seam. Three different spoiling procedures have been developed: the normal mode, where the coal seam is flat/nearly flat; the uphill mode, where the coal seam is dipping and the <b>dragline</b> spoils uphill; and the downhill mode, where the coal seam is again dipping but the <b>dragline</b> spoils downhill. The spoiling pattern has {{a great impact on}} <b>dragline</b> efficiency. The waste can be spoiled near the set on which the <b>dragline</b> sits or near the set on which the <b>dragline</b> digs Each pattern has been analysed in pit geometry design. The study of pullback design has been extended to cover key cut waste placement in order to operate with various pit width values and spoil-side concerns to control spoil-bound conditions. ...|$|R

25|$|Coal mining has {{had many}} {{developments}} over the recent years, {{from the early}} days of men tunnelling, digging and manually extracting the coal on carts, to large open cut and long wall mines. Mining at this scale requires the use of <b>draglines,</b> trucks, conveyors, hydraulic jacks and shearers.|$|E
25|$|When coal seams {{are near}} the surface, it may be {{economical}} to extract the coal using open cut (also referred to as open cast, open pit, mountaintop removal or strip) mining methods. Open cast coal mining recovers {{a greater proportion of}} the coal deposit than underground methods, as more of the coal seams in the strata may be exploited. This equipment can include the following: <b>Draglines</b> which operate by removing the overburden, power shovels, large trucks in which transport overburden and coal, bucket wheel excavators, and conveyors. In this mining method, explosives are first used in order to break through the surface or overburden, of the mining area. The overburden is then removed by <b>draglines</b> or by shovel and truck. Once the coal seam is exposed, it is drilled, fractured and thoroughly mined in strips. The coal is then loaded onto large trucks or conveyors for transport to either the coal preparation plant or directly to where it will be used.|$|E
25|$|As {{soon as the}} {{vibrations}} reveal {{that there is a}} floundering insect within range, some fishing spiders may take direct action - they run at pace {{across the surface of the}} water and grab the insect before it extracts itself from the water and flies to safety. Some fishing spiders use silk <b>draglines</b> to prevent themselves from speeding past the prey.|$|E
40|$|Lycosid spiders {{are among}} the most {{abundant}} and diverse insectivores occurring in all agroecosystems. Certain pest management practices, such as the application of pesticides, can disrupt their role in insect pest control. Therefore, understanding the effects of pesticides, including sublethal effects, is essential for the assessment of chemical effects on beneficial arthropods. We investigated the sexual chemical communication of the beneficial agrobiont spider Pardosa agrestis and its disruption by two widely used pesticides, the glyphosate-based herbicide Roundup and the pyrethroid-based insecticide Nurelle D. A two-choice olfactometer and Y-maze were used to study the effectiveness of female airborne and <b>dragline</b> pheromone cues and the disruptive effect of the pesticides. Males of P. agrestis did not locate females via airborne cues, but were very receptive to female <b>dragline</b> silk and male <b>dragline</b> silk. When both female <b>dragline</b> silk and male <b>dragline</b> silk were provided at the same time, the males preferred female silk. Pesticide treatments significantly affected the male ability to follow female cues deposited on <b>dragline</b> silk. The 3 -h residues of both Roundup and Nurelle D significantly disrupted the male ability to follow female cues deposited on <b>dragline</b> silk. Treatment by 48 -h residues significantly disrupted the male ability only in the case of Nurelle D. Our results demonstrate that pesticides reduce the ability of male spiders to search for a mate due to the disruption of the male's ability to detect the silk cues of the female...|$|R
40|$|The {{occurrence}} of chaotic instabilities is investigated {{in the swing}} motion of a <b>dragline</b> bucket during operation cycles. A <b>dragline</b> is a large, powerful, rotating multibody system utilised in the mining industry for removal of overburden. A simplified representative model of the <b>dragline</b> is developed {{in the form of}} a fundamental non-linear rotating multibody system with energy dissipation. An analytical predictive criterion for the onset of chaotic instability is then obtained in terms of critical system parameters using Melnikov 2 ̆ 7 s method. The model is shown to exhibit chaotic instability due to a harmonic slew torque for a range of amplitudes and frequencies. These chaotic instabilities could introduce irregularities into the motion of the <b>dragline</b> system, rendering the system difficult to control by the operator and/or would have undesirable effects on <b>dragline</b> productivity and fatigue lifetime. The sufficient analytical criterion for the onset of chaotic instability is shown to be a useful predictor of the phenomenon under steady and unsteady slewing conditions via comparisons with numerical results.

40|$|Spider <b>dragline</b> silk is {{a natural}} fiber that has {{excellent}} tensile properties; however, {{it is difficult to}} produce artificially as a long, strong fiber. Here, the spider (Araneus ventricosus) <b>dragline</b> protein gene was cloned and a transgenic silkworm was generated, that expressed the fusion protein of the fibroin heavy chain and spider <b>dragline</b> protein in cocoon silk. The spider silk protein content ranged from 0. 37 to 0. 61 % w/w (1. 4 - 2. 4 mol%) native silkworm fibroin. Using a good silk-producing strain, C 515, as the transgenic silkworm can make the raw silk from its cocoons for the first time. The tensile characteristics (toughness) of the raw silk improved by 53 % after the introduction of spider <b>dragline</b> silk protein; the improvement depended on the quantity of the expressed spider <b>dragline</b> protein. To demonstrate the commercial feasibility for machine reeling, weaving, and sewing, we used the transgenic spider silk to weave a vest and scarf; this was the first application of spider silk fibers from transgenic silkworms...|$|R
25|$|By September 1, 2005, {{the mouth}} of the 17th Street Canal had been sealed with the sheet piling {{preventing}} lake water from getting to the levee breach. Since no additional water can get through the breach it was no longer necessary to seal the breach itself. The next step was to get existing pumps working, and to bring in additional pumps to drain the surrounding city and the canal. Later, the canal was drained so that permanent repairs could be made to the levee. To allow drainage, backhoes mounted on marsh buggies and <b>draglines</b> mounted on barges cut breaches in some other levees. Marsh buggies are tracked vehicles whose wide tracks enable them to operate in soft, marshy terrain.|$|E

500|$|Adult P. labiatas {{sometimes}} uses [...] "propulsive displays", {{in which}} an individual threatens a rival of the same sex, and unreceptive females also threaten males in this way. P. labiata females are extremely aggressive to other females, trying to invade and take over each other's webs, which often results in cannibalism. A test showed that they minimise the risk of confrontations by using silk <b>draglines</b> as territory marks. Another test showed that females can recognise the <b>draglines</b> {{of the most powerful}} fighters and prefer to move near the <b>draglines</b> of less powerful ones. Females try to kill and eat their mates during or after copulation, while males use tactics to survive copulation, but sometimes females outwit them. Before being mature enough to mate, juvenile females mimic adult females to attract males as prey. When hunting, P. labiata mature females emit olfactory signals that reduce the risk that any other females, males or juveniles of the same species may contend for the same prey.|$|E
