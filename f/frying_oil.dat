Oil can be reused a few times after original use after straining out solids. However, excessive use of the same oil can cause it to break down and release compounds into the food that may be carcinogenic, affect liver health, or influence the body's ability to absorb vitamins. Some European countries have set public health standards for the safety of <b>frying</b> <b>oil.</b>|$|E

Consumers are increasingly avoiding products that contain trans fats, and governments have begun to ban trans fats in food products. These regulations and market pressures have spurred the development of low-α-linolenic acid soybeans. These new soybean varieties yield a more stable oil that doesn't require hydrogenation for many applications, thus providing trans fat-free products, such as <b>frying</b> <b>oil.</b>|$|E

40|$|Infrared (IR) {{spectroscopy}} {{has been}} widely used for component analysis because it is simple, fast, accurate and environmentally friendly. These studies were conducted to investigate {{the possibility of using}} IR spectroscopy {{as an alternative to the}} conventional methods for determining degree of degradation of <b>frying</b> <b>oils,</b> and also for determining blend level of mixtures of biodiesel and petrodiesel. In addition, the potential of using a single universal calibration to measure degree of degradation of <b>frying</b> <b>oils</b> or blend level of blended biodiesels, respectively, was evaluated in the studies. The first study shows that increased absorption due to a longer path length (4 mm) slightly improved the results for <b>frying</b> <b>oils</b> in the shorter wavelength region (700 – 100 nm), but the results were not as good as the results obtained by models using a 2 mm path length and longer wavelength region from a previous study. ^ In the second study, near-infrared (NIR) methods were successfully developed for measuring total polar material (TPM) and free fatty acid (FFA) contents in <b>frying</b> <b>oils</b> used to <b>fry</b> various foods. Additionally, a single universal calibration model could be used to determine quality of <b>frying</b> <b>oils</b> used to <b>fry</b> various foods. With the partial least-squares (PLS) models, the best correlations (r) between the NIR predicted data and reference method data for TPMs and FFAs in <b>frying</b> <b>oils</b> were 0. 995 and 0. 981, respectively. ^ The third study investigated the possibility of using mid-infrared (MIR) spectroscopy for determining degree of degradation of <b>frying</b> <b>oils</b> used to <b>fry</b> various foods. The results show that MIR spectroscopy, coupled with a single reflection attenuated total reflection (ATR) cell, was not as good as NIR transmission spectroscopy for predicting TPM and FFA contents in <b>frying</b> <b>oils</b> used to <b>fry</b> various foods. With the PLS models, the r values between MIR predicated data and reference method data for TPMs and FFAs in <b>frying</b> <b>oils</b> were 0. 975 and 0. 892, respectively. ^ The fourth study shows that NIR transmission spectroscopy was successful for estimating the blend levels of blended biodiesels. Also, blend levels of fuels from different sources could be determined by a single universal calibration model.

500|$|KFC's {{core product}} {{offering}} is pressure fried, on-the-bone chicken pieces seasoned with Colonel Harland Sanders' [...] "Original Recipe" [...] of 11 herbs and spices. The product is typically available in either {{two or three}} piece individual servings, or in a family size cardboard bucket, typically holding between 6 and 16 chicken pieces. Poultry is divided into 9 different cuts (2 drumsticks, 2 thighs, 2 wings, 1 keel, and a backbone-based breast cut divided into 2 pieces). The product is hand-breaded at individual KFC outlets with wheat flour mixed with seasoning in a two- to four-minute process. It is then pressure fried for between seven and ten minutes (the timing differs between countries) in oil at 185 degrees Celsius. Following this, the chicken is left to stand for 5 minutes in order for it to sufficiently cool before it {{is placed in the}} warming oven. It is KFC policy to discard chicken if it has not been sold within 90 minutes, in order to ensure freshness. The <b>frying</b> <b>oil</b> varies regionally, and versions used include sunflower, soybean, rapeseed and palm oil. A KFC executive stated that the taste of the chicken will vary between regions depending on the oil variety used, and whether the chicken has been corn-fed or wheat-fed.|$|E
500|$|To {{prepare the}} chicken pieces for frying, {{they may be}} coated in a batter of flour and liquid (and seasonings) mixed together. The batter can contain {{ingredients}} like eggs, milk, and leavening. Alternatively, they may be dredged in flour or a similar dry substance, to coat the meat {{and to develop a}} crust. Seasonings such as salt, pepper, cayenne pepper, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, or ranch dressing mix can be mixed in with the flour. Either process may be preceded by marination or by dipping in milk or buttermilk. As the pieces of chicken cook, some of the moisture that exudes from the chicken is absorbed by the coating of flour and browns along with the flour, creating a flavorful crust. According to Nathan Bailey's 1736 cookbook, Dictionarium Domesticum, for example, the chicken can be covered in a marinade that consists of the juice of two large fresh lemons, malt vinegar, bay leaves, salt, pepper, ground cloves, and green onions; it then must be settled in the marinade for three hours before being dipped in the batter that consists of all-purpose flour, white wine, three egg yolks and salt, and then slowly submerged in a deep pot of either oil, lard, or clarified butter over an open fire. [...] It can then be topped with fresh, dried parsley dipped in the same <b>frying</b> <b>oil.</b>|$|E

The net result depends {{on the type of}} food, the frying fat used and the frying process. Moreover, the modifications that frying produces in other nutrients could indirectly affect the availability of dietary minerals. The most outstanding ones are those that can take place in the fat or in the protein. With respect to the interactions between <b>frying</b> <b>oils</b> and minerals, we have recent knowledge concerning the effects of consuming vegetable oils used in repeated fryings of potatoes without turnover, on the nutritive utilization of dietary minerals. The experiments have been carried out in pregnant and growing rats, which consumed diets containing, as a sole source of fat, the testing <b>frying</b> <b>oils</b> or unused oils. It seems that the consumption of various <b>frying</b> <b>oils,</b> with a polar compound content lower or close to the maximum limit of 25 % accepted for human consumption, does not alter the absorption and metabolism of calcium, phosphorous, iron or copper.

The urinary excretion of Zn also increased although its balance remained unchanged. Different studies referring to the effects of consuming fried fatty fish on mineral bioavailability will also be presented.
