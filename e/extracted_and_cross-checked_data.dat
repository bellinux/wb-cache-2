40|$|Background Recovery {{strategies}} are often usedwith {{the intention of}} preventing orminimisingmuscle soreness after exercise. Whole-body cryotherapy, which involves a single or repeated exposure(s) to extremely cold dry air (below - 100 °C) in a specialised chamber or cabin for two to four minutes per exposure, is currently being advocated as an effective intervention to reduce muscle soreness after exercise. Objectives To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of whole-body cryotherapy (extreme cold air exposure) for preventing and treating muscle soreness after exercise in adults. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, the British Nursing Index and the Physiotherapy Evidence Database. We also searched the reference lists of articles, trial registers and conference proceedings, handsearched journals and contacted experts. The searches were run in August 2015. Selection criteria We aimed to include randomised and quasi-randomised trials that compared the use of whole-body cryotherapy (WBC) versus a passive or control intervention (rest, no treatment or placebo treatment) or active interventions including cold or contrast water immersion, active recovery and infrared therapy for preventing or treating muscle soreness after exercise in adults. We also aimed to include randomised trials that compared different durations or dosages of WBC. Our prespecified primary outcomes were muscle soreness, subjective recovery (e. g. tiredness, well-being) and adverse effects. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently screened search results, selected studies, assessed risk of bias and <b>extracted</b> <b>and</b> <b>cross-checked</b> <b>data.</b> Where appropriate, we pooled results of comparable trials. The random-effects model was used for pooling where there was substantial heterogeneity. We assessed {{the quality of the}} evidence using GRADE. Main results Four laboratory-based randomised controlled trials were included. These reported results for 64 physically active predominantly young adults (mean age 23 years). All but four participants were male. Two trials were parallel group trials (44 participants) and two were cross-over trials (20 participants). The trials were heterogeneous, including the type, temperature, duration and frequency of WBC, and the type of preceding exercise. None of the trials reported active surveillance of predefined adverse events. All four trials had design features that carried a high risk of bias, potentially limiting the reliability of their findings. The evidence for all outcomes was classified as ’very low’ quality based on the GRADE criteria. Two comparisons were tested: WBC versus control (rest or no WBC), tested in four studies; and WBC versus far-infrared therapy, also tested in one study. No studies compared WBC with other active interventions, such as cold water immersion, or different types and applications of WBC. All four trials compared WBC with rest or no WBC. There was very low quality evidence for lower self-reported muscle soreness (pain at rest) scores after WBC at 1 hour (standardised mean difference (SMD) - 0. 77, 95...|$|E
40|$|BackgroundNeuropsychiatric {{involvement}} in {{systemic lupus erythematosus}} (SLE) is complex {{and it is an}} important cause of morbidity and mortality. Management of nervous system manifestations of SLE remains unsatisfactory. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2000 and previously updated in 2006. ObjectivesTo assess the benefits and harms of cyclophosphamide and methylprednisolone in the treatment of neuropsychiatric manifestations of SLE. Search methodsWe searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, SCOPUS and WHO up to and including June 2012. We sought additional articles through handsearching in relevant journals as well as contact with experts. There were no language restrictions. Selection criteriaWe included all randomised controlled trials that compared cyclophosphamide to methylprednisolone in patients with SLE of any age and gender and presenting with any kind of neuropsychiatric manifestations. Data collection and analysisTwo review authors independently <b>extracted,</b> assessed <b>and</b> <b>cross-checked</b> <b>data.</b> We produced a 'Summary of findings' table. We presented dichotomous data as risk ratios (RRs) with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs). Main resultsWe did not include any new trials in this update. One randomised controlled trial of 32 patients is included. Concerning risk of bias, generation of the allocation sequence was at low risk; however, allocation concealment, blinding and selective reporting were at high risk. Treatment response, defined as 20 % improvement from basal conditions by clinical, serological and specific neurological measures, was found in 94. 7 % (18 / 19) of patients using cyclophosphamide compared with 46. 2 % (6 / 13) in the methylprednisolone group at 24 months (RR 2. 05, 95 % CI 1. 13 to 3. 73). This was statistically significant and the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) of treatment response is three. We found no statistically significant differences between the groups in damage index measurements (Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics (SLICC)). the median SLE Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) rating favoured the cyclophosphamide group. Cyclophosphamide use was associated with a reduction in prednisone requirements. All the patients in the cyclophosphamide group had electroencephalographic improvement but there was no statistically significant difference in decrease between groups in the number of monthly seizures. No statistically significant differences in adverse effects, including mortality, were reported between the groups. Authors' conclusionsThis systematic review found one randomised controlled trial with a small number of patients in the different clinical subgroups of neurological manifestation. There is very low-quality evidence that cyclophosphamide is more effective in reducing symptoms of neuropsychiatric {{involvement in}} SLE compared with methylprednisolone. However, properly designed randomised controlled trials that involve large numbers of individuals, with explicit clinical and laboratory diagnostic criteria, sufficient duration of follow-up and description of all relevant outcome measures, are necessary to guide practice. As we did not find any new trials to include in this review at update, the conclusions of the review did not change.

40|$|Background: Depression is an {{important}} consequence of stroke that impacts on recovery yet is often not detected or inadequately treated. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2004. Objectives: To determine whether pharmaceutical, psychological, or electroconvulsive treatment (ECT) of depression in patients with stroke can improve outcome. Search strategy: We searched the trials registers of the Cochrane Stroke Group (last searched October 2007) and the Cochrane Depression Anxiety and Neurosis Group (last searched February 2008). In addition, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library, Issue 1, 2008), MEDLINE (1966 to May 2006), EMBASE (1980 to May 2006), CINAHL (1982 to May 2006), PsycINFO (1967 to May 2006) and other databases. We also searched reference lists, clinical trials registers, conference proceedings and dissertation abstracts, and contacted authors, researchers and pharmaceutical companies. Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials comparing pharmaceutical agents with placebo, or various forms of psychotherapy or ECT with standard care (or attention control), in patients with stroke, {{with the intention of}} treating depression. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors selected trials for inclusion and assessed methodological quality; three review authors <b>extracted,</b> <b>cross-checked</b> <b>and</b> entered <b>data.</b> Primary analyses were the prevalence of diagnosable depressive disorder at the end of treatment. Secondary outcomes included depression scores on standard scales, physical function, death, recurrent stroke and adverse effects. Main results: Sixteen trials (17 interventions), with 1655 participants, were included in the review. Data were available for 13 pharmaceutical agents, and four trials of psychotherapy. There were no trials of ECT. The analyses were complicated by the lack of standardised diagnostic and outcome criteria, and differing analytic methods. There was some evidence of benefit of pharmacotherapy in terms of a complete remission of depression and a reduction (improvement) in scores on depression rating scales, but there was also evidence of an associated increase in adverse events. There was no evidence of benefit of psychotherapy. Authors' conclusions: A small but significant effect of pharmacotherapy (not psychotherapy) on treating depression and reducing depressive symptoms was found, as was a significant increase in adverse events. More research is required before recommendations can be made about the routine use of such treatments...|$|R

DATA SOURCES: Articles were searched from the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and Ovid database. STUDY SELECTION: We included randomized controlled trials from 1992 to 2011, and their quality was assessed using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) scale. DATA EXTRACTION: Studies were evaluated by 2 independent reviewers for their methodologic quality. Disagreements were settled by a third reviewer. <b>Data</b> were then <b>extracted</b> <b>and</b> <b>cross-checked</b> for accuracy. The reviewers were not blinded to the authors of the articles.

40|$|Background and {{objective}} The combination therapy of chemotherapy and {{epidermal growth factor}} receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) has {{attracted the attention of}} more and more investigators. The aim of this meta-analysis is to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of intercalated combination of chemotherapy and EGFR- TKIs versus chemotherapy alone in the first-line therapy of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Methods We retrieved the Cochrane Library, PubMed, EMBASE, CBM, CNKI and Wanfang databases for randomized controlled trials which involved the intercalated combination of chemotherapy and EGFR-TKIs, and chemotherapy alone in the first-line treatment of advanced NSCLC. The progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), and adverse events were analyzed. The quality evaluation <b>and</b> <b>cross-checked</b> <b>data</b> were independently performed by two investigators according to the Cochrane Systematic Reviews Handbook. The Stata 12. 0 software was used to conduct the meta-analysis. Results This study included 933 NSCLC patients from 6 RCTs. The meta-analysis demonstrated that the intercalated combination of chemotherapy and EGFR-TKIs significantly prolonged the PFS (HR= 0. 72, 95 %CI: 0. 53 - 0. 98, P= 0. 037) of advanced NSCLC patients compared with mono-chemotherapy. However, there was no statistical difference in OS (HR= 0. 85, 95 %CI: 0. 72 - 1. 01, P= 0. 060), ORR (OR= 1. 59, 95 %CI: 0. 86 - 2. 95, P= 0. 142) and DCR (OR= 1. 09, 95 %CI: 0. 95 - 1. 25, P= 0. 226) between the two groups. Further, the subgroup analysis showed that the intercalated combination markedly improved the PFS in female, adenocarcinoma, never smoking, EGFR mutant patients. In the aspect of safety, the main side effects of the intercalated combination therapy were rash (OR= 7. 81, 95 %CI: 3. 74 - 16. 34, P< 0. 001) and diarrhea (OR= 2. 73, 95 %CI: 1. 92 - 3. 89, P< 0. 001). Conclusion The intercalated combination of chemotherapy and EGFR-TKIs significantly prolonged the PFS in the first-line therapy of advanced NSCLC patients compared with mono-chemotherapy, and the main adverse events were tolerable rash and diarrhea.

Clavicle or collarbone fractures account for around 4 % of all fractures. While treatment of these fractures is usually non-operative, {{some types of}} fractures, as well as non-union of the middle third of the clavicle, are often treated surgically. ObjectivesTo {{evaluate the effectiveness of}} different methods of surgical treatment for acute fracture or non-union of the middle third of the clavicle. Search strategyWe searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (to December 2008), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2008, Issue 4), MEDLINE (1966 to December 2008), EMBASE (1988 to December 2008), LILACS (1982 to December 2008), trial registries and reference lists of articles. No language or publication restrictions were applied. Selection criteriaRandomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials evaluating any surgical intervention for treating people with fractures or non-union of the middle third of the clavicle were considered. the primary outcomes were pain, treatment failure and health-related quality of life or shoulder function. Data collection and analysisTwo authors independently selected eligible trials and three authors assessed methodological quality <b>and</b> <b>cross-checked</b> <b>data</b> extraction. There was no pooling of data. Main resultsData from three small trials, each testing a different comparison, were included. Two trials had design features that carry a high risk of bias, limiting the strength of their findings. Low-contact dynamic compression plates appeared to be associated with significantly better upper-limb function throughout the year following surgery, earlier fracture union and return to work, and a reduced incidence of implant-associated symptoms when compared with a standard dynamic compression plate in 36 adults with symptomatic non-union of the middle third of the clavicle. One study (69 participants) compared the Knowles pin versus a plate for treating middle third clavicle fractures or non-union. Knowles pins appeared to be associated with lower pain levels and use of post-operative analgesics, reduced incidence of implant-associated symptoms, and shorter operation time and hospital stay. One study (133 participants) found that a three-dimensional technique for fixation with a reconstruction plate was associated with a significantly lower incidence of symptomatic delayed union than a standard superior position surgical approach.

ObjectivesTo evaluate the effects of different methods for conservative (non-operative) treatment for acute (treated soon after injury) middle third clavicle fractures in adolescents and adults. Search methodsWe searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (2013, Issue 12), MEDLINE (from 1966), EMBASE (from 1980), LILACS (from 1982), trial registers, orthopaedic proceedings and reference lists of articles. We applied no language or publication restrictions. {{the date of the}} last search was 29 January 2014. Selection criteriaRandomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials testing conservative interventions for treating adolescents and adults with acute middle third clavicle fractures. the primary outcomes were shoulder function or disability, pain and treatment failure. Data collection and analysisAt least two authors selected eligible trials, independently assessed risk of bias <b>and</b> <b>cross-checked</b> <b>data</b> extraction. We calculated risk ratios and 95 % confidence intervals for dichotomous variables, and mean differences and 95 % confidence intervals for continuous variables. There was no pooling of data. Main resultsWe included three trials in this review with 354 participants. No new trials were included in this update. Very low quality evidence was available from two trials (234 participants) that compared the figure-of-eight bandage with an arm sling for treating acute middle third clavicle fractures. Both trials were underpowered and compromised by poor methodology. One trial found slightly higher pain levels in the bandage group at 15 days (mean difference 0. 80, 95 % confidence interval 0. 34 to 1. 26; visual analogue scale: 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain)); and the other trial reported greater discomfort during bandage wear. There {{were no significant differences between}} the two interventions in functional or other outcomes reported for either trial. Moderate quality evidence was available from the third trial (120 participants), which evaluated therapeutic ultrasound. This trial was at low risk of any type of bias but was underpowered. the trial found no statistically significant difference between low-intensity pulsed ultrasound and placebo in the time to clinical fracture healing (mean difference - 0. 32 days, 95 % CI - 5. 85 to 5. 21 days), nor in any of the other reported outcomes. Authors' conclusionsThere is limited evidence available from randomised controlled trials to determine which methods of conservative treatment are the most appropriate for acute middle third clavicle fractures in adolescents and adults.

40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, {{consumer}} {{researchers have been}} interested in understanding symbolic relationship between consumers and brands, especially on identity construction (Elliott & Wattanasuwan, 1998; Escalas & Bettman, 2005; Kirmani, 2009) and its implications on brand management (Arvidsson, 2005; Holt, 2002; 2004). Following a cultural-psychological view to study how culture shapes brand-identity relationship, Eckhardt (2000) addresses that little attention have been paid to understand consumer behavior within interdependent cultures when compare with the prolific account of western literatures that reported the consumption behavior with an independent self-construal. This paper strives to address this absence through researching how a group of Chinese youngsters internalize their cultural values with a sense of assumed emotion and developed local specific brand literacy towards fashion brands’ perception and consumption. Following Bengtsson and Firat (2006) ’s concept of brand literacy, this interpretative research aims to extend our current understanding of symbolic brand consumption and brand-identity relationship in particular to the interdependent Asian context. The literature review discusses previous studies on brand symbolism in formulating brand-identity relationship and how social psychological understanding of interdependent construal of self can be applied to consumer researches. The cultural characteristics of Chinese consumers are also discussed with reference to previous indigenous consumer researches on symbolic brand consumption. As part of a greater project on fashion and brand consumption experience among young Chinese in Guangzhou, 18 Chinese volunteers aged around 20 are recruited from local universities and colleges and become the main research informants. The fieldwork is conducted in Guangzhou. In-depth interviews and participant observations are the main data collection method. Triangulation analysis technique has been adopted to review <b>and</b> <b>cross-check</b> <b>data</b> collected. Our findings and discussions demonstrate different dimensions of assumed emotion (Hu, 1949) among the Chinese youngsters in structuring their brand literacy. We discuss how cultural concern towards their social identities, including as students, sons/daughters, friends, and changing identities expected in the future, may significantly impact the youngsters’ fashion and brand value, perception and consumption. Through symbolic consumption, the Chinese youngsters depict a sense of culturally specific fashion and brand knowledge as demonstrated in their fashion choice, taste and consumption, {{in a way that is}} culturally appropriate in fitting themselves in a complex social network. Guided by this sense of assumed emotion, Chinese youngsters adopt the signs and meanings embedded in brand names and its associated symbols to engage in the different social situations within their cultural setting. This has resulted in a different construct of brand literacy within the interdependent cultural context. An emergent theme is also found as there is a major difference in fashion brands perceptions and choices between the urbanities (i. e. Guangzhou localities) and peripheries (i. e. outsiders) because of a cultural difference in constructing their cosmopolitan identities (Thompson & Tambyah, 1999). To conclude, this study has contributed to our understanding of brand-identity relationship in the interdependent Asian context. Consumers in the eastern cultures tend to be subjected to integrate a larger socio-cultural context than maintaining individualistic pleasures as in western cultures. A greater concern of understanding the assumed emotion and how consumers asserted their social identities with symbolic fashion and brand consumption would be a key to understand the consumption cultures with interdependent self-construal.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to study the process used for {{selecting}} research areas and methodological approaches in distance education in India. Experts from the field of distance education in India were interviewed at length, with the aim of collecting qualitative data on opinions on process-issues for selecting areas for research, research design, and appropriate methodological approaches in distance education. Data collected from these interviews were subjected to content analysis; triangulation and peer consultation techniques were used for <b>cross-checking</b> <b>and</b> <b>data</b> verification. While the findings and recommendations of this study have limited application in that they can only be used in the specific context outlined in this paper, respondents in this study nonetheless revealed the pressing need for more process-oriented research in examining media and technology, learners and learning, and distance learning evaluation processes. Our research, which yielded interesting empirical findings, also determined that a mixed approach – one that involves both quantitative and qualitative methods – is more appropriate for conducting research in distance education in India. Qualitative evidence from our research also indicates that respondents interviewed felt that emphasis should be placed o...|$|R
40|$|Part I. The one-dimensional, {{time-dependent}} equations describing laminar deflagration are {{solved by}} an integral method, {{under the assumption}} of a physical model for the flame structure and behavior, with restrictions {{on the type of}} deviation from steady-state behavior. By virtue of application of a hot-boundary approximation of the von Kármán type, certain sensitive integrals are expressed in a form independent of the temperature profile assumed. Two cases are considered: the "thermal theory" neglecting diffusion, and the case of unity Lewis number (temperature/concentration similarity). Only first order reactions are considered. Arguments supporting the generality of the results are included, along with a discussion of accuracy, and some comparison with experimental work. Graphical display of the results anticipates the utility of the theory for correlating <b>and</b> <b>cross-checking</b> experimental <b>data.</b> It is concluded that the relaxation time is closely related to the time required for the gas undergoing rapid chemical reaction to pass through the flame. Part II. The interaction of an electromagnetic wave with a mildly ionized gas is described by an ensemble average treatment of electron motion, and under this description, electromagnetic wave propagation parameters derived. Motivated by the fact that mildly ionized gases in general exhibit inhomogeneous boundary regions, exemplary transition zones are described in terms of varying electron density but constant collision frequency, in order to simplify the solution of wave problems. The half-space reflection problem with a linear transition zone is solved exactly and under two approximations. It is discovered that the reflection and transmission coefficients are strong functions of zone thickness for thin zones. A piecewise-linear transition zone solution exemplifies the procedure for constructing an approximate solution to an arbitrary profile and illustrates the relative insensitivity of reflection and transmission coefficients to detailed zone structure. The "slab" reflection problem with symmetrical, linear transition zones is solved exactly, and it is discovered that the basic periodicity of reflection and transmission coefficients with slab thickness is unchanged, although shifted to higher values of slab thickness/wavelength. The text is supported by fairly extensive graphical presentation of results...|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjectivesFrom the {{perspective}} of public health, tuberculosis (TB) remains an important issue that threatens health. Korea is an intermediate burden country with a TB incidence of 97 / 100, 000 individuals. Among many TB control measures, a relapse rate of TB is one indicator {{that can be used}} to indirectly assess the level of TB control in countries and in communities. Relapse TB has an approximately 12 % yearly incidence in Korea. This study aims to estimate the relapse rate of TB and to investigate the associated factors by using nationwide TB notification data in Korea. MethodsThe nationwide TB notification data in 2005 was used with the exclusion criteria of duplicated reporting, foreign-born patients, outcome–died, and outcome–diagnosis changed. The data were double-checked as to whether they were reported again during 2006 – 2010 and the estimated relapse rate of TB. Associated factors were analyzed by multivariate logistic regression with the variables of age, sex, registration type, results of sputum smear test, medication, and outcome of treatment. ResultsAmong 45, 434 TB patients in 2005, 4, 371 patients were again reported as TB patients from 2006 to 2010. Five hundred and sixty-four patients were reported more than twice and the cumulative number of relapses was 5, 072 cases. The 5 -year relapse rate was estimated as 9. 62 %. The relapse rate decreased yearly: 4. 8 % in 2006, 2. 4 % in 2007, 1. 6 % in 2008, 1. 4 % in 2009, and 1. 0 % in 2010. Age, sex, registration type, tuberculosis type, and medication were independently associated with a relapse of TB. In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, the following factors were related: male sex, 40 – 49 years old; registration type, relapse, treatment after failure, treatment after default, transfer in, and other, the sputum smear-positive pulmonary TB, and medications (including individuals taking 2 – 5 drugs). ConclusionThis study has estimated a 5 -year relapse rate of TB in Korea that is slightly lower than the rate of relapse TB in the annual reports. This study could be conducted <b>and</b> <b>cross-checked</b> with <b>data</b> from the National Health Insurance in the future...|$|R
40|$|BackgroundClavicle {{fractures}} are common, {{accounting for}} 2. 6 % to 4 % of all fractures. Eighty per cent of clavicle fractures {{are located in}} the middle third of the clavicle. Although treatment of these fractures is usually non-surgical, displaced clavicle fractures may be considered for surgical treatment because of their greater risk of non-union. ObjectivesTo assess the effects (benefits and harms) of surgical versus conservative interventions for treating middle third clavicle fractures. Search methodsWe searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (to December 2012), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; in the Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 11), MEDLINE (1966 to December 2012), EMBASE (1980 to 2012 Week 40), LILACS (1982 to December 2012), and trial registries (December 2012). No language or publication restrictions were applied. Selection criteriaRandomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials evaluating surgical versus conservative interventions for treating middle third of the clavicle fractures were considered. the primary outcomes were shoulder function or disability, pain and treatment failure (defined as the number of participants who had been given a non-routine secondary surgical intervention (excluding hardware removal) for symptomatic non-union, malunion or other complications). Data collection and analysisAt least two review authors selected eligible trials, independently assessed risk of bias <b>and</b> <b>cross-checked</b> <b>data.</b> Where appropriate, results of comparable trials were pooled. Main resultsWe included eight trials involving 555 participants with middle third clavicle fractures. Four studies compared plate fixation with wearing a sling and four studies compared intramedullary fixation with wearing either a sling or a figure-of-eight bandage. Almost all trials had design features that carry a high risk of bias, thus limiting the strength of their findings. Low-quality evidence from seven trials (429 participants) showed that, compared with conservative treatment, surgical treatment of acute middle third clavicle fractures may not result in a significant improvement in upper arm function at one year of more follow-up: standardised mean difference 0. 46, 95 % confidence interval (CI) CI - 0. 06 to 0. 98. This corresponds to an absolute mean improvement of 3. 2 points in favour of surgery (0. 4 points worse to 7 points improvement) on the 100 -point Constant score; this is neither clinically nor statistically significant. Low-quality evidence from seven trials (437 participants) indicates a marginal difference in the incidence of treatment failure between surgery (9 / 232, 3. 9 %) and conservative treatment (24 / 205, 11. 7 %) (risk ratio 0. 38, 95 % CI 0. 15 to 0. 99). However, this was dominated by the results of the largest trial, which had an unusually high number of symptomatic malunions in the conservative treatment group. One trial providing pain results at one-year follow-up found no difference between the two groups. No trials reported on quality of life. No significant difference between groups was noted in the pooled results for adverse events but separate analyses by type of adverse events showed that wound infection and/or dehiscence (data from three trials) and secondary surgery due to hardware complications (data from five trials) occurred only in the surgical group. Skin and nerve problems were also more common after surgical treatment, although {{the difference between the two}} groups was not statistically significant (data from four trials). Conversely, stiffness or restriction of shoulder movement was more common after conservative treatment (data from three trials). Authors' conclusionsLimited evidence is available from randomised controlled trials on the relative effectiveness of surgical versus conservative treatment for acute middle third clavicle fractures. Treatment options must be chosen on an individual patient basis, after careful consideration of the relative benefits and harms of each intervention and of patient preferences.

30|$|To {{answer the}} first {{research}} sub-question – What changes {{are there in}} the attitudes and activities of the teachers in classroom practices through their interaction with the designed curriculum appropriate for a CHC? – {{the characteristics of a}} social constructivist teacher and a traditional CHC teacher presented in Table 1 were used as organising elements to characterise the teachers’ changes in practices. The characteristics of the teachers in teaching the experimental lessons were compared to those of a social constructivist teacher and to those of a traditional CHC teacher (Table 1). This characterisation was primarily determined by classroom observations (Source A) and was triangulated with data from the student questionnaires (Source B) and the student interviews (Source C). The characterisation of changes in teachers’ attitudes and activities in the experimental lessons was first created by the first author. Then it was sent to the participating teachers to verify and come to an agreement among the members of the team. After that, the characterisation was discussed thoroughly with the second author several times. It was later discussed and validated again in the entire research group before reaching a final consensus.
