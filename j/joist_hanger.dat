5000|$|<b>Joist</b> <b>hanger</b> nail - special nails {{rated for}} use with joist hangers and similar brackets. Sometimes called [...] "Teco nails" [...] ( [...] Ã— [...]148 shank nails used in metal {{connectors}} such as hurricane ties) ...|$|E
40|$|A common {{model of}} light gauge, metal <b>joist</b> <b>hanger</b> is tested on a wood-to-wood {{connection}} for two conditions. One condition follows the commonly used test standard for joist hangers, {{which allows the}} support beam to be restrained from horizontal and rotational movement. The second condition (unrestrained) allows the support beam to freely move horizontally and in rotation. The {{results show that the}} unrestrained case is much weaker than the standard restrained case. For the model of hanger tested, the average ultimate load for the unrestrained case was 28 % of the standard restrained case. The mode of failure for the unrestrained case is different than that for the restrained case. This documents the importance of providing means of restraining the supporting beam by methods other than the connection via the <b>joist</b> <b>hanger.</b> The ASTM testing method for joist hangers may need to be adjusted to account for this possible mode of failure...|$|E
50|$|Products: finally, the {{individual}} products {{used to construct}} a system can be specified, e.g. <b>joist</b> <b>hangers,</b> terrazzo tiles, gas fired boilers.|$|R
50|$|Common {{mistakes}} made with installing I-joists include cutting or chiseling the flange, improperly sized <b>joist</b> <b>hangers,</b> improper nailing and wrong-sized nails. The rim joist depth must match the I-joist size. Mismatches can strain the joist.|$|R
50|$|Another type of {{fastening}} {{commonly found}} in construction is the strap fastening which is roughly analogous to the large head clout nail. These are {{used in conjunction with}} a strap shot nailer (or positive placement nailer UK) to fix metalwork such as <b>joist</b> <b>hangers,</b> corner plates, strengthening straps, etc. to timber structures. They differ from conventional nailers in that the point of the fastening is not sheathed so it can be exactly positioned before firing the nail gun.|$|R
50|$|Toenailing or skew-nailing is {{a popular}} {{technique}} that carpenters use regularly to fix two timbers together by slanted application. The fasteners (nails or screws), used in pairs, are driven in on opposing angles. This locks the timbers together, to create a stable framework, e.g. in stud walls (partitions) or roof framing. The angled nailing makes later dismantling difficult or destructive. One {{of the most common}} places to toenail a framing member is where a rafter meets the top plate of a wall at the birdsmouth. Alternatives to toenailing include the use of hurricane ties, <b>joist</b> <b>hangers,</b> and other engineered steel connectors that permit nails to be attached perpendicular to a member's surface.|$|R
50|$|An {{example of}} the {{situation}} to which Stage 3 refers would be where a solid stone wall has become soaked due to a gutter becoming blocked and rainwater allowed to overflow down the wall {{for a period of}} time. Roof timbers may rest on top of the wall. Even when the ingress of water has been stopped and good ventilation established, it will take a considerable length of time for the wall to dry out. During this time, it is probable that there will be sufficient moisture present to allow fungal growth to continue. In this situation {{it will be necessary to}} isolate the timber from the masonry with DPC material. Where the ends of timbers were originally built into a wall and have rotted, these may be cut off flush with the wall and reattached using <b>joist</b> <b>hangers.</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the benefits of}} introducing finite element methods in the curriculum of undergraduate courses. It looks at {{the structure of the}} CAA/CAD module and examines to what extent it fulfils its main aims and objectives. It discusses the efficiency of the modern teaching and learning techniques used as an aid for developing the necessary skills in solving engineering problems, and monitors the developing ability and confidence of the students to tackle many stress/structural analysis and design problems, which often have no clearly defined brief, data, or even solution. Project management, leadership, presentation skills and teamwork are encouraged and assessed among students. A short account is written about the behaviour of a family of <b>joist</b> <b>hangers</b> under direct loading conditions and their subsequent mode of failure. This is followed by a design optimization study and a series of tentative conclusions. A great deal of consideration was given {{to the development of a}} finite element model, simulating a component and its support system. Theoretical results were compared with those from a laboratory investigation. Satisfactory agreement was obtained between the measured vertical displacements and the calculated ones. Satisfactory, also, was the agreement between experimental and theoretical stresses in the supporting web, the flanges and the flange/web interface. The paper includes a discussion of the results and the conclusions drawn from them. Emphasis is given to the experience built up in running a module, which is considered to be essential for students wishing to pursue further studies, research, or a career in industry. Finally, the interface between the CAA/CAD module and other related modules, its usefulness and effectiveness are discussed...|$|R
