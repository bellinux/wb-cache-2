After much published literature claiming that the ABH substances were all attached to glycosphingolipids, Finne et al. (1978) found that the human erythrocyte glycoproteins contain polylactosamine chains that contains ABH substances attached and represent {{the majority of the}} antigens. The main glycoproteins carrying the ABH antigens were identified to be the Band 3 and Band 4.5 proteins and glycophorin.

Other enzymes, namely, transglycosidases, glycoside phosphorylases and ‘Leloir’ <b>glycosyl</b> <b>transferases,</b> each with specific characteristics, may also be used in glycosylation reactions [43]. Although ‘Leloir’ <b>glycosyl</b> <b>transferases</b> are highly efficient Nature’s catalyst for glycosylation reactions but they require very expensive nucleotide-activated sugars as donors like UDP-glucose, UDP-galactose which is the major bottleneck in their application for the commercial production of glycosides [43]. However, glycoside phosphorylases and transglycosidases are active with low cost donors that can be obtained in large quantities. Our discussion in the following paragraph focuses on β–glycosidases.|$|R
5000|$|Specific {{glycosylation}} {{has been}} shown to occur after the formation of the heptpeptide aglycone. [...] Data suggest three separate <b>glycosyl</b> <b>transferases</b> are required for the glycosylation of the teicoplanin aglycone. Two of these <b>glycosyl</b> <b>transferases</b> are involved in the addition of the N-fatty acyl-β-D-glucosamine and N-acetyl-β-D-glucosamine units. A third mannosyl transferase is responsible for the addition of the D-mannose unit onto residue 7. The fatty acyl chain is connected by amide bond to the glucosamine moiety by the action of an acyl transferase. In addition to glycosylation, some genes have been suggested to code for deacetylases.

This substitution {{can be used to}} identify the substrate specificities of uncharacterized transferase genes. The spsK gene of Sphingomonas strain S 88 and the pssDE genes of Rhizobium leguminosarum were identified as encoding glucuronosyl-(β 1 → 4) -glucosyl transferases based on reciprocal genetic complementation of mutations in the spsK gene and the pssDE genes by segments of cloned DNA and by the SpsK-dependent incorporation of radioactive glucose (Glc) and glucuronic acid (GlcA) into lipid-linked disaccharides in EDTA-permeabilized cells. By contrast, <b>glycosyl</b> <b>transferases</b> which form alternative sugar linkages to the same substrate caused inhibition of polysaccharide synthesis or were deleterious or lethal in a foreign host. The negative effects also suggested specific substrate requirements: we propose that spsL codes for a glucosyl-(β 1 → 4) -glucuronosyl transferase in Sphingomonas and that pssC codes for a glucuronosyl-(β 1 → 4) -glucuronosyl transferase in R. leguminosarum.

40|$|In Streptomyces ambofaciens, the {{producer}} of the macrolide antibiotic spiramycin, an open reading frame (ORF) was found downstream of srmA, a gene conferring resistance to spiramycin. The deduced product of this ORF had high degrees of similarity to Streptomyces lividans <b>glycosyl</b> <b>transferase,</b> which inactivates macrolides, and this ORF was called gimA. The cloned gimA gene was expressed in a susceptible host mutant of S. lividans devoid of any background macrolide-inactivating <b>glycosyl</b> <b>transferase</b> activity. In the presence of UDP-glucose, cell extracts from this strain could inactivate various macrolides by glycosylation. Spiramycin was not inactivated but forocidin, a spiramycin precursor, was modified. In vivo studies showed that gimA could confer low levels of resistance to some macrolides. The spectrum of this resistance differs from the one conferred by a rRNA monomethylase, such as SrmA. In S. ambofaciens, gimA was inactivated by gene replacement, without any deleterious effect on {{the survival of the}} strain, even under spiramycin-producing conditions. But the overexpression of gimA led to a marked decrease in spiramycin production.

These units are phosphodiester linked, at C 1 of muramic acid, to a C 55 undecaprenyl carrier. PBP 1 b has been purified {{in the form of}} His tag (M 46 -N 844) PBP 1 bgamma. This derivative provides the host cell in which it is produced with a functional wall peptidoglycan. His tag (M 46 -N 844) PBP 1 bgamma possesses an amino-terminal hydrophobic segment, which serves as transmembrane spanner of the native PBP. This segment is linked, via an congruent with 100 -amino-acid insert, to a D 198 -G 435 <b>glycosyl</b> <b>transferase</b> module that possesses the five motifs characteristic of the PBPs of class A. In in vitro assays, the <b>glycosyl</b> <b>transferase</b> of the PBP catalyses the synthesis of linear glycan chains from the lipid carrier with an efficiency of congruent with 39 000 M- 1 s- 1. Glu- 233, of motif 1, is central to the catalysed reaction. It is proposed that the Glu- 233 gamma-COOH donates its proton to the oxygen atom of the scissile phosphoester bond of the lipid carrier, leading to the formation of an oxocarbonium cation, which then undergoes attack by the 4 -OH group of a nucleophile N-acetylglucosamine. Asp- 234 of motif 1 or Glu- 290 of motif 3 could be involved in the stabilization of the oxocarbonium cation and the activation of the 4 -OH group of the N-acetylglucosamine. In turn, Tyr- 310 of motif 4 is {{an important component of the}} amino acid sequence-folding information. The <b>glycosyl</b> <b>transferase</b> module of PBP 1 b, the lysozymes and the lytic transglycosylase Slt 70 have much the same catalytic machinery. They might be members of the same superfamily. The <b>glycosyl</b> <b>transferase</b> module is linked, via a short junction site, to the amino end of a Q 447 -N 844 acyl transferase module, which possesses the catalytic centre-defining motifs of the penicilloyl serine transferases superfamily. In in vitro assays with the lipid precursor and in the presence of penicillin at concentrations sufficient to derivatize the active-site serine 510 of the acyl transferase, the rate of glycan chain synthesis is unmodified, showing that the functioning of the <b>glycosyl</b> <b>transferase</b> is acyl transferase independent. In the absence of penicillin, the products of the Ser- 510 -assisted double-proton shuttle are glycan strands substituted by cross-linked tetrapeptide-pentapeptide and tetrapeptide-tetrapeptide dimers and uncross-linked pentapeptide and tetrapeptide monomers. The acyl transferase of the PBP also catalyses aminolysis and hydrolysis of properly structured thiolesters, but it lacks activity on D-alanyl-D-alanine-terminated peptides. This substrate specificity suggests that carbonyl donor activity requires the attachment of the pentapeptides to the glycan chains made by the <b>glycosyl</b> <b>transferase,</b> and it implies that one and the same PBP molecule catalyses transglycosylation and peptide cross-linking in a sequential manner. Attempts to produce truncated forms of the PBP lead to the conclusion that the multimodular polypeptide chain behaves as an integrated folding entity during PBP 1 b biogenesis. Peer reviewe...|$|E

To the best of our knowledge, these compounds have not yet been reported for S. purpurascens. They have, however been reported for mutants of S. violaceus (Johdo et al. 1991 c), which is very closely related and a phylogenetic neighbor of S. purpurascens as is evident from the Figure  1.The biosynthetic pathway for rhodomycin synthesis has been elucidated by Oki (1977), according to which during the synthesis of rhodomycin (a β-RMN glycoside), ε-RMN is an intermediate. This ε-RMN can be glycosylated by a <b>glycosyl</b> <b>transferase</b> to form ε-RMN glycosides, epelmycins. It has been suggested that biosynthetic conversion from ε-RMN to β-RMN takes place at glycoside level (Johdo et al. 1991 b; Johdo et al. 1991 c). Therefore formation of Epelmycins which are ε-RMN glycosides can be expected to occur in S. pupurascens too. Similarly, Compound D identified as an aklavinone glycoside, Aclacinomycin A which is the main product in S. galilaeus has also not been reported for S. purpurascens.

To continue the study of the Methanococcus voltae N-glycosylation pathway, characteristics of known eukaryotic, bacterial, and archaeal proteins involved in the N-glycosylation process were examined and used to select candidate M. voltae genes for investigation as potential <b>glycosyl</b> <b>transferase</b> and flippase components. The targeted genes were knocked out via linear gene replacement, and the resulting effects on N-glycan assembly were identified through flagellin and surface (S) layer protein glycosylation defects. This study reports the finding that deletion of two putative M. voltae <b>glycosyl</b> <b>transferase</b> genes, designated aglC (for archaeal glycosylation) and aglK, interfered with proper N-glycosylation. This resulted in flagellin and S-layer proteins with significantly reduced apparent molecular masses, loss of flagellar assembly, and absence of glycan attachment. Given previous knowledge of both the N-glycosylation pathway in M. voltae and the general characteristics of N-glycosylation components, it appears that AglC and AglK are involved in the biosynthesis or transfer of diacetylated glucuronic acid within the glycan structure. In addition, a knockout of the putative flippase candidate gene (Mv 891) had no effect on N-glycosylation but did result in the production of giant cells with diameters three to four times that of wild-type cells.

40|$|Extremely thermoacidophilic {{microbes}} such as Sulfolobus solfataricus are strict chemoheterotrophs {{despite their}} geologic niche. Strain specific differences in genome structure implicated a unique role {{for one of}} three endogenous endoglucanases, which promoted the consumption of oligosaccharides including cellohexaose (G 6) through cellonanaose (G 9). Protein transporters required for cellodextrin uptake were identified through mutagenesis and complementation of an ABC transporter cassette including a putative oligosaccharide binding protein. In addition, ablation of the binding protein compromised growth on glucose and alpha-linked oligosaccharides while inactivation of a previously described glucose transporter had no apparent impact. These data demonstrate that S. solfataricus employs a redundant mechanism for soluble cellodextrin catabolism having both substrate uptake and extracytoplasmic hydrolytic components.

40|$|The {{role of the}} {{salicylic}} acid (SA) glycosides SA 2 -O-β-D-glucose (SAG), SA glucose ester (SGE) and the <b>glycosyl</b> <b>transferases</b> UGT 74 F 1 and UGT 74 F 2 {{in the establishment of}} basal resistance of Arabidopsis against Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato DC 3000 (Pst) was investigated. Both mutants altered in the corresponding <b>glycosyl</b> <b>transferases</b> (ugt 74 f 1 and ugt 74 f 2) were affected in their basal resistance against Pst. The mutant ugt 74 f 1 showed enhanced susceptibility, while ugt 74 f 2 showed enhanced resistance against the same pathogen. Both mutants have to some extent, altered levels of SAG and SGE compared to wild type plants, however, in response to the infection, ugt 74 f 2 accumulated higher levels of free SA until 24 hpi compared to wild type plants while ugt 74 f 1 accumulated lower SA levels. These SA levels correlated well with reduced expression in PR 1 and EDS 1 in ugt 74 f 1. In contrast, ugt 74 f 2 has enhanced expression of Enhanced Disease Susceptibility 1 (EDS 1) but a strong reduction in the expression of several jasmonate (JA) -dependent genes. Bacterial infection interfered with the expression of Fatty Acid Desaturase (FAD), Lipoxygenase 2 (LOX 2), carboxyl methyltransferase 1 (BSMT 1) and 9 -cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase (NCED 3) genes in ugt 74 f 1, thus promoting an antagonistic effect with SA-signalling and leading to enhanced bacterial growth. UGT 74 F 2 might be a target for bacterial effectors since bacterial mutants affected in effector synthesis were impaired in inducing UGT 74 F 2 expression. These results suggest that UGT 74 F 2 negatively influences the accumulation of free SA, hence leading to an increased susceptibility due to reduced SA levels and increased expression of the JA and ABA markers LOX- 2, FAD and NCED- 3...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Capacity for {{information}} in biological molecules is traditionally thought {{to reside in}} the primary sequence of proteins and RNA, recorded in the DNA. With the exception of some RNA molecules, proteins, if not structural, carry their information in binding sites for substrates of reactions, or in binding sites for control molecules. Some proteins bind to complex carbohydrates in a carbohydrate-specific fashion, including enzymes, lectins and antibodies. These carbohydrates, assembled by sequential <b>glycosyl</b> <b>transferases,</b> also carry biological information, {{the other side of}} which is a binding protein that recognizes a specific sugar monosaccharides, sequence, anomerity, linkage, ring size, branching and substitution. It is the latter 7 parameters, however, that give carbohydrates a very large potential {{for information}}-carrying capacity in a short sequence. An exponentially growing body of knowledge exists in this aspect of carbohydrate function...|$|R
