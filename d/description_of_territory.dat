The proposed method uses a process of iterative and incremental development. Two complete iterations of the development process are presented starting from the analysis model and ending with the code produced by the case-tools SQL code generator. The first iteration deals with the <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>territory</b> objects and the second one deals with the business objects used {{in the context of}} the spreading of organic waste. As a result of transformations applied, models are enriched with new concepts and, therefore, are more complex. The growing complexity of the model may negatively affect an actor’s understanding, which may become an impediment by slowing down the analysis phase. The authors show how the software development process model, a modeling artifact associated with the continuous integration unified process method, avoids the apparent complexity of the model and improves productivity. ...|$|E

Moreover, {{there is an}} ever-growing demand for a more “representative ” and “world widespread” digital cartography. More representative means the capabilities in describing physical phenomena but also social, economic and cultural data that are necessarily connected to geographical aspects. More widespread derives from the growing use of cartographic products by non-specialized users. Among the different formats of numerical cartography, threedimensional maps are certainly the more suitable. These represent a cartographic typology corresponding to different levels of accuracy and details to describe reality, such as DTM and city modelling.

40|$|Usually, the {{historical}} cartography {{is considered an}} essential tool to know and describe the territory. Even so, {{in the field of}} urban design, several ways, tools and techniques of representation have translated different concepts of “space” over the centuries. Thus the transition which takes place in modern times from the concept of space “of localization” to the one “of extension” (Foucault 2002), within the cartography it is marked by the origin of vedutist genre. More or less with awareness, studies of urban analysis sought to recover the capacity of {{the historical}} maps not only to fix the characters of a territory, but mainly to narrate its spatial structure and values, selecting elements and their way of being represented. From this point of view, it can be examined the study about Naples by Bisogni and Renna in 1966, an example that was defined “masterly” (Purini 1998). In the 80 ’s it was realized that the techniques of traditional representation “skid” (Boeri 2002) on a dynamically changing reality. So, the <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>territory</b> becomes a “complex” matter that is enriched by innovative techniques and tools, but sometimes loses its meaning as a planning tool, transforming itself in a kind of “descriptive anxiety” (Viganò, 1999). On the one hand it is necessary to recover or re-invent these kind of tools and techniques for describing territories, on the other we must be aware that the contemporary territory is constantly in “mutation” (Koolhaas 2001) and, as such, it can not be described through the use of universal categories. Starting from these considerations, the paper focuses on some examples in order to identify ways, tools and techniques that, similarly to historical representations of territory, are able to “set to shape” contemporary urban projects. So, the new “figures” of the project not only are able to tell the structure of the context they take place in, through the arrangement of their elements, but, above all, they become able to represent the idea of space in contemporary architecture: a dynamic and “topological” space, (such as) the space of the network that replaces the traditional concepts of measure with “position relationships” such as proximity and distance...|$|E

40|$|The {{assessment}} of {{the environmental impact of}} a mining site over surrounding areas can be evaluated {{through the use of a}} proper modelling. Models must rely on a mathematical <b>description</b> <b>of</b> the <b>territory,</b> allowing to take into account several features, treated such as point, linear or areal elements. In this context, Geographical Information Systems (GIS) are a very powerful working environment, allowing to realise a mathematical <b>description</b> <b>of</b> the <b>territory</b> to analyze and model the relationships existing between the different detected features. Satellite data can thus be considered as a key source, allowing the analysis of both existing and historical situation with an high level of detail, thanks to today’s commercial availability of satellite data acquired at a very high resolution. In the framework of the Extract-It project (ASIA IT&C European Programme), the analysis of the environmental impact of mining sites, adopting the proposed approach, has been carried out over three areas located in China, India and Thailand. Analysis have been developed within a GIS environment, based on data collected by multi-mission satellite images, integrated with information directly collected on site. The strategies adopted, and some of the results achieved, with reference to the Indian mine site are presented.
