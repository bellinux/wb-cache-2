25|$|Due to {{the nature}} of {{proteolytic}} venom, a viperid bite is often a very painful experience and should always be taken seriously, though it may not necessarily prove fatal. Even with prompt and proper treatment, a bite can still result in a permanent scar, and in the worst cases, the affected limb may <b>even</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> amputated. A victim's fate is impossible to predict, as this depends on many factors, including the species and size of the snake involved, how much venom was injected (if any), and the size and condition of the patient before being bitten. Viper bite victims may also be allergic to the venom and/or the antivenom.|$|E
25|$|If {{another team}} signs a {{released}} player {{who had a}} guaranteed contract (as long as the player has cleared waivers), the player's original team is allowed {{to reduce the amount}} of money they still owe the player (and lower their team payroll) by the right of set-off. This is true if the player signs with any professional team—it does not <b>even</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an NBA team. The amount the original team gets to set off is limited to one-half the difference between the player's new salary and a pro-rated share of the minimum salary for a one-year veteran (if the player is a rookie, then the rookie minimum is used instead).|$|E
25|$|The latest {{development}} and preferred method for timing racing pigeons is the Electronic Timing System. The bird's arrival is recorded automatically. When using an electronic system, the pigeon fancier does not <b>even</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> at the loft to clock the birds as they return. Birds are {{fitted with a}} band that has a tiny RFID chip in it which can be read when the bird comes home. At the home loft the electronic scanning records the pigeons arrival. The pad or antenna is placed at the entry point to the loft entrance and as the pigeon crosses it the electronic band is scanned. The clock {{is attached to the}} antennas. The serial number of the transponder ring is recorded along with the time of arrival. This is very similar to transponder timing systems used in human races.|$|E

500|$|There was a {{consensus}} amongst reviewers that Elite Force {{was the first}} truly successful Star Trek game, standing out from past titles deemed to be mediocre in quality and design. Game Revolution stated that Elite Force managed to [...] "fight off the curse which until now has plagued most Star Trek action games", while IGN enthusiastically proclaimed [...] "Trekkies, rejoice! You've finally got something to be proud of". GamePro further commented that [...] "you don't <b>even</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a full-fledged Trekker to appreciate the gaming goodness that Elite Force has to offer". GameSpot put Elite Forces success down {{to the influence of}} Half-Life and its expansion , noting that the influence of these games is [...] "evident in Elite Forces level design". GameSpy closed its review by putting Elite Force as one of the year's best first-person shooters, and [...] "almost certainly the best Star Trek game period, a franchise infamous for its string of bad titles". Likewise, PC Gamer UK commended the game as [...] "the best Star Trek game ever, and a first-rate FPS in its own right".|$|E
500|$|Extensive {{testing of}} the M22 {{occurred}} in 1943 and 1944, and was conducted by both the Ordnance Department and the British Armoured Fighting Vehicle (AFV) Gunnery School at Lulworth Ranges. These tests uncovered a number of faults and problems with the Locust. The AFV School noted {{that the process of}} loading the M22 into a C-54 transport aircraft took considerable time and involved the use of complex equipment. [...] Overall the process took six untrained men 24 minutes, although it was believed this could be shortened with sufficient training. Unloading was also a long process, taking approximately ten minutes; it was noted that the time it took to unload the M22 from a C-54 on the battlefield meant that both the tank and aircraft would make excellent targets for enemy fire. Operational use of the tank would therefore be restricted to the availability of airfields large enough to accommodate a fully laden C-54, which might not be in the right geographical location or might <b>even</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> captured in advance of a planned airborne operation. A heavy transport aircraft, the Fairchild C-82 Packet, was developed to specifically carry the M22 inside its fuselage and unload it through a set of clam-shell doors, but it did not enter service until after the war had ended. The US Army Armored Board released a critical report on the Locust in September 1943, stating that it was inadequate in the areas of reliability and durability, and indicating {{that it would not be}} able to be successfully used during airborne operations. By 1944 it was also realized that the design of the tank was actually obsolete. The armor of the M22 in several areas was found to be so thin that it was incapable of even resisting the armor-piercing ammunition of a [...]50 caliber machine-gun. [...] Complaints were also made about the 37mm main armament, which was not powerful enough to penetrate the armor of most tanks used by the Axis powers. Similarly a report made on March 13, 1944 by elements of the 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment complained that when a high-explosive shell was fired from the gun, the resulting shell-burst was so weak that observers had difficulty in seeing where it impacted. There were also mechanical problems with the design, which caused it to be unreliable; the engine was also found to be underpowered, possibly due to problems with the torque characteristics of the engine or an inefficient transmission system.|$|E
