60|$|A {{portion of}} the city is pretty {{exclusively}} Turkish; the Jews have a quarter to themselves; the Franks another quarter; so, also, with the Armenians. The Armenians, of course, are Christians. Their houses are large, clean, airy, handsomely paved with black and white squares of marble, and in the centre of many of them is a square court, which has in it a luxuriant flower-garden and a sparkling fountain; the doors of all the rooms open on this. A very wide hall leads to the street door, and in this the women sit, the most of the day. In the cool of the evening they dress up in their best raiment and show themselves at the door. They are all comely of countenance, and exceedingly neat and cleanly; they look as if they were just out of a band-box. Some of the young ladies--many of them, I may say--are even very beautiful; they average a shade better than American girls--which treasonable words I pray may be forgiven me. They are very sociable, and will smile back when a stranger smiles at them, bow back when he bows, and talk back if he speaks to them. No introduction is required. An hour's chat at the door with a pretty girl one never saw before, is easily obtained, and is very pleasant. I have tried it. I could not talk anything but English, and the girl knew nothing but Greek, or Armenian, or some such barbarous tongue, but we got along very well. I find that in cases like these, the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> not comprehend each other isn't much of a drawback. In that Russia n town of Yalta I danced an astonishing sort of dance an hour long, and one I had not heard of before, with a very pretty girl, and we talked incessantly, and laughed exhaustingly, and neither one ever knew what the other was driving at. But it was splendid. There were twenty people in the set, and the dance was very lively and complicated. It was complicated enough without me--with me it was more so. I threw in a figure now and then that surprised those Russians. But I have never ceased to think of that girl. I have written to her, but I can not direct the epistle because her name is one of those nine-jointed Russian affairs, and there are not letters enough in our alphabet to hold out. I am not reckless enough to try to pronounce it when I am awake, but I make a stagger at it in my dreams, and get up with the lockjaw in the morning. I am fading. I do not take my meals now, with any sort of regularity. Her dear name haunts me still in my dreams. It is awful on teeth. It never comes out of my mouth but it fetches an old snag along with it. And then the lockjaw closes down and nips off a couple of the last syllables--but they taste good.|$|E

The content of two basic approaches to the study of social problems ­ positivist (functional) and constructivist. Positivists (E. Durkheim, T. Parsons, R. Merton, R. Nisbet) believe that the main tool in solving social issues are the <b>facts</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> measure. In this sense the issues are the manifestation of improper performance of functions in society, that social issues can be studied as a social disorganization and behavior as deviant or deviation from accepted social norms and institutionalized. Constructivists (R. Fuller, C. W. Mills, H. Becker, H. Bloomer, M. Spector, J. Kitsuse) believe that dysfunction becomes a problem if it is understood, defined and can be fixed. It was found that in order to hit the social issue of the political agenda, it must be riveted attention from the media and the public. Reported that the theoretical basis of the consideration cycle attention to the issue laid A. Downs, T. O’Riordan, B. G. Peters, B. W. Hogwood. It is proved that {{in order to get to}} the regional political agenda, the social issue has to pass a series of attention to it. Initially there is an alternative view on the issue, and the source of this view must have the trust of the community. Also formed an alternative definition of the issue, its magnitude or its seriousness. The next step is subjected reformulation of issue, leading to a greater variety of arguments, and this, in turn, can lead to reducing bureaucratic involvement, reduced media attention and weaken the bonds between community members. As a result, the question loses its priority and will be removed from the regional political agenda. That is the importance of support at three levels: regional authorities, regional media and regional community. Each of them have their highs and lows on various issues and areas of policy. Manufacturers regional policy should listen to opinions as members of the community, and to position the media, that take into account changes in the regional public agenda and the agenda of the regional media. Therefore, the regional political agenda there is the stage when the cycle of attention to the issue of the regional public agenda and the agenda of the regional media is a maximum – at this time, regional authorities should take certain measures in respect of public issues. In the next cycle of attention to social issue, despite the weakening of interest in it from the community and the media continues to be perceived as a issue of governance structures created or adapted to work with it, which because of its bureaucratic nature does not stop working on this issue...|$|R

40|$|The {{main task}} {{of this project}} were to develop, {{hardware}} and software that could stream audio data via USB 2. 0. This project were based on XMOS, USB 2. 0 design. In this project we have brought an idea to reality {{in the form of}} a finished product. This with verification help from engineers on Syncore technologies. Under the development process the functionality surrounding component databases, provided by Altium designer, were to be evaluated. To be mentioned is that Altium designer was the software used to develop the PCB in this project. After many hours spent developing, we finally got the hardware and software to behave in the way it was suppose to do. That is, to be able to stream audio data from a high-resolution source(PC/MAC/unit with S/PDIF out, maximum resolution 24 -bit 192 kHz). This to both S/PDIF and analog stereo out via RCA-connectors. The sound quality from a possible subjective point of view is very good and we are happy with the result. We think that the functionality surrounding component databases are convenient in many applications. Not just the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> easily <b>can</b> generate an up to date pricing of all components used in a project, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> also shorten the development process.
