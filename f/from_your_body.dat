Marriage vows, duties, affections, and all our nearest and dearest interests would be unhinged, and this pleasant state of being would degenerate into a moral, or rather an immoral pandemonium.

On the command ‘get set,’ assume the front-leaning rest position by placing your hands {{where they are}} comfortable for you. Your feet may be together or up to 12 inches apart. When viewed <b>from</b> the side, <b>your</b> <b>body</b> should form a generally straight line <b>from</b> <b>your</b> shoulders to your ankles. On the command ‘go,’ begin the push-up by bending your elbows and lowering <b>your</b> entire <b>body</b> as a single unit until your upper arms are at least parallel to the ground. Then, {{return to the starting}} position by raising <b>your</b> entire <b>body</b> until <b>your</b> arms are fully extended. <b>Your</b> <b>body</b> must remain rigid in a generally straight line and move as a unit while performing each repetition. At the end of each repetition, the scorer will state the number of repetitions you have completed correctly. If you fail to keep <b>your</b> <b>body</b> generally straight, to lower <b>your</b> whole <b>body</b> until <b>your</b> upper arms are at least parallel to the ground, or to extend your arms completely, that repetition will not count, and the scorer will repeat the number of the last correctly performed repetition. If you fail to perform the first ten push-ups correctly, the scorer will tell you to go to your knees and will explain to you what your mistakes are. You will then be sent to the end of the line to be retested. After the first 10 push-ups have been performed and counted, however, no restarts are allowed. The test will continue, and any incorrectly performed push-ups will not be counted. An altered, front-leaning rest position is the only authorized rest position. That is, you may sag in the middle or flex your back. When flexing your back, you may bend your knees, but not to such an extent that you are supporting most of <b>your</b> <b>body</b> weight with <b>your</b> legs. If this occurs, your performance will be terminated. You must return to, and pause in, the correct starting position before continuing. If you rest on the ground or raise either hand or foot <b>from</b> the ground, <b>your</b> performance will be terminated. You may reposition your hands and/or feet during the event as long as they remain in contact with the ground at all times. Correct performance is important.

40|$|What is cholesterol, and whatdoes {{it have to}} do withdisease of {{the blood}} vessels and heart? Cholesterol is a fatty sub-stance that is present in all the cells in <b>your</b> <b>body.</b> Cholesterol travels in your blood in {{particles}} called lipoproteins. Three of the common lipoproteins are low-density lipoproteins (LDL), high-density lipoproteins (HDL), and very low density lipoproteins (VLDL). Medical {{studies have shown that}} ele-vated levels of LDL cholesterol are associated with an increased risk of developing blockages in the coronary arteries, whereas elevated levels of HDL cholesterol reduce that risk. Thus, doctors sometimes refer to LDL as “bad cholesterol ” and to HDL as “good cholesterol. ” Cholesterol comes <b>from</b> 2 sources. <b>Your</b> <b>body</b> makes some cholesterol, and you also get cholesterol in foods that come from an animal (meat, milk, eggs, or anything made from these). Eating too much of these foods may increase the total amount of cholester-ol in <b>your</b> <b>body.</b> <b>Your</b> <b>body</b> needs cholesterol to work properly. However, excess cho-lesterol can deposit in your arteries and promote formation of a deposit known as a plaque, which can grow larger over time; this process is called athero-sclerosis. A piece of the plaque may break off and a blood clot may form on the exposed surface of the plaque. These blood clots may block or de-crease the blood flow and oxygen sup-ply to your heart, brain, and other body parts. If the blockage is significant, you may have a heart attack or stroke, need a procedure performed on your heart to improve the supply of blood to your heart muscle (bypass surgery, angioplasty, or stent placement), or die prematurely from cardiovascular dis-ease.
