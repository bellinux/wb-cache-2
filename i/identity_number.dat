50|$|People {{who have}} no Swedish {{personal}} <b>identity</b> <b>number</b> can receive a co-ordination number (samordningsnummer) instead.

It is structured along the same lines, but with the day in the date of birth advanced by 60 (giving a number between 61 and 91). The reason for this routine {{is that there is a}} risk of running out of personal identity numbers. It is easier to get a co-ordination number than a personal <b>identity</b> <b>number</b> because the latter require evidence of work or education which would last at least a year, so many students or workers get a co-ordination number first and later a personal <b>identity</b> <b>number.</b> A Swedish identity card require personal <b>identity</b> <b>number,</b> while a bank account is troublesome to get with only a co-ordination number.|$|E
