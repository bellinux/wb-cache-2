The measurement of moisture buffer value (MBV) is held {{according to the}} NORDTEST protocol (Rode, 2005). Specimen are exposed to <b>daily</b> <b>cyclic</b> <b>variation</b> of relative humidity: 8 h at 75 %RH and 16 h at 33 %RH the test is held under isothermal conditions (23 °C). The experimental set-up is validated by comparison of moisture buffer value measured on cellular concrete with values given in the NORDTEST project for {{the same kind of}} material. Results show that sprayed hemp concrete has an excellent moisture buffer capacity (MBV = 2. 15 g/(m 2 %RH)). So, it is an excellent hydric regulator that improves hygrothermal comfort and reduces energy needs. Moisture effusivity is then calculated from sorption and water vapour permeability value and from dynamic test of MBV. The results (respectively 5. 8 * 10 ^- 07 and 4. 8 * 10 ^- 07 kg/ (m 2 Pa s 1 / 2) show a slight discrepancy between values obtained from steady-state and from dynamic conditions. Finally, the penetration depth for <b>daily</b> <b>cyclic</b> <b>variation</b> is estimated about 5. 8 cm for sprayed hemp concrete. Also, the experimental data set can be used for benchmarking buffering models...|$|E
40|$|International audienceHemp {{concrete}} is a bio-based {{building material}} made of hemp shiv and lime. This material {{is not used}} as load-bearing due to low mechanical properties. Hemp concrete is thus mainly used as filling material associated to a wooden structure. The indoor {{side of the wall}} can be coated or not. On hygrothermal point of view, hemp concrete shows low thermal conductivity, about 0. 1 W/m/K, and can be used without added insulation layer in buildings. The hydric characterization of hemp concrete shows high transfer and storage capacities. Thus, this study deals with hydric characterization of hemp concrete under dynamic conditions. The experimental method is based on the NORDTEST protocol where specimens are exposed to <b>daily</b> <b>cyclic</b> <b>variation</b> of relative humidity. Generally, hygrothermal characterization is held at 23 °C. This study deals with the impact of temperature on moisture buffer value of hemp concrete.

40|$|International audienceHemp-lime {{plasters}} are bio-based {{building materials}} {{made with a}} binder and hemp aggregate. Their main qualities are their low environmental impact due to bio-sourced components and their hygrothermal behavior. This study investigates two types of Hemp-lime plasters. The first composition corresponds to a mixture of Tradichanvre lime-based binder with hemp shiv (chanvribat). The second composition corresponds to a mixture of Tradichanvre lime-based binder with fibred hemp shiv (Terrachanvre). This study investigates the effect of temperature on thermal properties (conductivity and thermal diffusivity) and on Moisture Buffer Value (MBV) of hemp-lime plasters. The investigations are based on experimental measurements and are performed at 14 °C, 17 °C, 20 °C and 23 °C. The measurements of thermal properties are made at 50 % Relative Humidity (RH). To limit the problems of water migration, the measurements are performed with transient state methods. Hot disk is used at all temperatures; it provides both thermal conductivity and diffusivity. Hot wire is used at 23 °C, it provides thermal conductivity only. The measurement of moisture buffer value (MBV) is performed following the NORDTEST protocol. Specimens are exposed to <b>daily</b> <b>cyclic</b> <b>variation</b> of relative humidity: 8 hours at 75 % RH and 16 hours at 33 % RH. Over the considered temperature range (14 - 23 °C), the impact of temperature on thermal properties is very poorly while it is more sensitive on moisture buffer value. It is shown that the moisture buffer value decreases by about 36 % when the temperature decreases from 23 °C to 14 °C...|$|E

The analysis of locomotor activity rhythms of E. orientalis and E. vuilleti shows that the locomotor activity of both species presents <b>daily</b> <b>cyclic</b> <b>variations.</b> These two Eupelmidae have similar activity rhythms. Displacements of these parasitoids essentially take place during the photophase. But the activity of E. vuilleti is earlier, because the individuals of this species start their activity on average 4 to 5 h earlier than those of E. orientalis. E. vuilleti begins its displacements several hours before the onset of lighting, whereas E. orientalis is active only {{in the presence of the}} light.

40|$|Behaviour of the pile-soil {{interface}} {{is important}} to correctly predict the response of floating piles in terms of displacement and lateral friction. Regarding energy piles, which couple the structural roles of deep foundations with the principle of shallow geothermal energy, the response of pile-soil interfaces is influenced by seasonal and <b>daily</b> <b>cyclic</b> thermal <b>variations.</b> Accordingly, {{the goal of this}} paper is to experimentally investigate the response of the pile-soil interface at different temperatures. This experimental campaign aims to analyse (i) the cyclic mobilization of the shear strength of the soil-pile interface that is induced by thermal deformation of the pile and (ii) the direct influence of temperature variations on the soil and soil-pile interface behaviour. In this study, a direct shear device was developed and calibrated for nonisothermal soil-structure interface testing. It appears that the sand-concrete interface was affected by cyclic degradation but not affected directly by temperature. Conversely, the response of the clay-concrete interface changed at different temperatures, showing an increase of strength with increasing temperature, presumably due to the effects of temperature on clay deformation...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn {{a context}} of {{sustainable}} development, the choice of materials for building envelop shall {{take into account the}} environmental impact of the material, the energy consumption of building (for heating, cooling), the indoor environmental quality (safety and comfort), etc [...] . The so-called "environmentally friendly" materials are more and more used. Hemp concrete is told to have a low impact on environment as it is made of hemp shiv (renewable raw) and of lime (lower embedded energy than cement). This material is not used as load-bearing due to low mechanical properties. Hemp concrete is thus mainly used as filling material associated to a wooden structure. On hygrothermal point of view, hemp concrete shows low thermal conductivity, about 0. 1 W/m/K, and can be used without added insulation layer in buildings. The hydric characterization of hemp concrete shows high transfer and storage capacities. Numerical {{studies have shown that the}} transient hygrothermal behavior allows reducing energy demand of building while maintaining indoor relative humidity. However, these studies are based on experimental data of sorption curve and water vapour permeability; it was shown that the uncertainty on this kind of data hampers reliable simulations of hygroscopic buffering. Thus, this study deals with hydric characterization of hemp concrete under dynamic conditions looking for more realistic characterization. The experimental method is based on the NORDTEST protocol where specimens are exposed to <b>daily</b> <b>cyclic</b> <b>variation</b> of relative humidity. This measure leads to moisture buffer value. The study is held, firstly, on uncoated specimens of hemp concrete and then on coated ones. Six specimens are tested. Only one side is exposed to the ambient condition while the other sides are sealed with aluminum tape. Their thickness is chosen to be higher than the predicted penetration depth. The steady state is reached after two days and the measures are performed during five steady cycles. The mean value of moisture buffer value of uncoated hemp concrete is 2. 14 g/(m². %RH). This induces that hemp concrete is an excellent hydric regulator according to the MBV classification given in the NORDTEST project. By comparison, the moisture buffer value given in the NORDTEST project are : 1. 04 g/(m². %RH) for cellular concrete (good hydric regulator), 0. 64 g/(m². %RH) for gypsum (moderate hydric regulator) and 0. 38 g/(m². %RH) for concrete (limited hydric regulator). The coating reduces moisture buffer value of hemp concrete. For closed coating (sand-lime coating), the value is nearly half the previous one (1. 08 g/(m². %RH)). For open coating (hemp-lime coating), the value is much less reduced (1. 82 g/(m². %RH)). This capacity would allow energy saving while maintaining adequate air quality and hygrothermal comfort. Also, this experimental method is very relevant to characterize dynamic behavior of building material. The experimental data set can be used for benchmarking buffering models...|$|E
40|$|The {{operating}} range of Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) engines {{is limited by}} the knock boundary on one side and by high <b>cyclic</b> <b>variations</b> (misfire) on the other side. A challenging problem for HCCI engines is achieving cycle-by-cycle ignition control due to these variations. To control combustion in HCCI engines, it is essential to understand how parameters affect the <b>cyclic</b> <b>variations</b> of HCCI combustion. This paper investigates cyclic variability of HCCI combustion using experimental data collected at 360 operating points from a single cylinder Ricardo engine. The engine is fueled with four different blends of Primary Reference Fuels PRFs (iso-octane and n-heptane) at octane values of 0, 10, 20 and 40 over a wide range of equivalence ratios, intake temperatures, intake pressures, Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) rates, and engine speeds. The experimental results show there are three main distinct patterns of <b>cyclic</b> <b>variations</b> for combustion peak pressure (Pmax), Indicated Mean Effective Pressure (IMEP) and ignition timing. These patterns include normal <b>cyclic</b> <b>variations,</b> periodic <b>cyclic</b> <b>variations</b> and <b>cyclic</b> <b>variations</b> with weak/misfired ignitions. The results also show <b>cyclic</b> <b>variation</b> of HCCI combustion is highly dependant on the location of the start of combustion and there is less <b>cyclic</b> <b>variation</b> in the first stage of HCCI combustion compared to that of the second stage for the PRF blends studied...|$|R

To determine whether ultrasound tissue characterization can identify viable though stunned myocardium before recovery of regional wall thickening, transient ischemic injury was produced in eight open chest dogs for 15 min followed by reperfusion for 2 h. <b>Cyclic</b> <b>variation</b> and wall thickening were measured before ischemia, at 15 min after the onset of ischemia and at selected intervals after the onset of reperfusion from multiple sites within the ischemic zone with a novel combined two-dimensional and M-mode acquisition system. <b>Cyclic</b> <b>variation</b> and wall thickening were computed from digitized M-mode integrated backscatter images with an algorithm developed and validated for this purpose. Magnitude and “delay” of <b>cyclic</b> <b>variation</b> and wall thickening were compared. Delay represents the degree of synchrony of regional <b>cyclic</b> <b>variation</b> or wall thickening with global ventricular mechanical systole. Baseline <b>cyclic</b> <b>variation</b> and wall thickening magnitudes were 3. 8 ± 0. 2 dB and 37 ± 1. 4 %, respectively. With ischemia, <b>cyclic</b> <b>variation</b> and wall thickening decreased to 1. 7 ± 0. 2 dB and 17 ± 2 %, respectively (p < 0. 05, compared with baseline). <b>Cyclic</b> <b>variation</b> recovered to baseline levels within 20 min after reperfusion (3. 3 ± 0. 4 dB, p = NS). Wall thickening remained depressed for 2 h after the onset of reperfusion (23 ± 2 %, p < 0. 05 compared with baseline). Delay of <b>cyclic</b> <b>variation</b> in a unitless ratio expressed as delay (in milliseconds) divided by the QT interval (in milliseconds) increased from 0. 87 ± 0. 03 at baseline to 1. 10 ± 0. 12 with ischemia, a change consistent with mild asynchrony, and returned to baseline (0. 95 ± 0. 07, p = NS compared with baseline) within 20 min after reperfusion. Delay of wall thickening was 0. 88 ± 0. 02 at baseline, increased to 1. 23 ± 0. 09 with ischemia and remained significantly increased 2 h after reperfusion (1. 07 ± 0. 05, p < 0. 05 compared with baseline). Recovery time constants for <b>cyclic</b> <b>variation</b> and wall thickening with reperfusion reflected earlier restoration of <b>cyclic</b> <b>variation</b> (8. 1 min) than of wall thickening (420. 5 min). Thus, <b>cyclic</b> <b>variation</b> recovers before wall thickening with reperfusion.

The magnitude of the <b>cyclic</b> <b>variation</b> of integrated backscatter and the interval from the onset of the QRS wave of the electrocardiogram to the minimal integrated backscatter value were measured using an area of interest of variable size for integrated backscatter sampling and a software resident in the ultrasound scanner.

Relative echo amplitude values were assigned by standardising echo gain using the posterior parietal pericardium as an in-vivo calibration. M mode measurements of the left ventricle were used to assess cardiac systolic activity. Subjects were studied prospectively. Analysis of echo amplitude was performed by investigators who were blinded to the results of the M mode analysis. The influence of impaired left ventricular performance and abnormal wall motion were assessed. PATIENTS [...] 11 cardiomyopathy patients with impaired ventricular function, eight patients with severe pulmonary hypertension and reversed septal motion, and 19 healthy controls. SETTING [...] All subject studies were performed at Harefield Hospital. Echo amplitude analysis was performed at the Royal Brompton Hospital. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] <b>Cyclic</b> <b>variation</b> in echo amplitude was determined as the change in echo amplitude from end diastole to end systole. Additionally, an index of <b>cyclic</b> <b>variation</b> defined as the ratio of the cyclic change in echo amplitude to end diastolic echo amplitude was measured. Both <b>cyclic</b> <b>variation</b> and the <b>cyclic</b> <b>variation</b> index were analysed to see whether they correlated with left ventricular dimensions, fractional shortening, and systolic wall thickening. RESULTS [...] Stepwise regression analysis showed systolic wall thickening to be the most significant independent variable that correlated with the <b>cyclic</b> <b>variation</b> index for both the septum and posterior wall (r = 0. 68, p = 0. 0001, septum; r = 0. 69, p = 0. 0001, posterior wall). The slopes and intercepts for both regression equations were similar (y = 0. 005 x + 0. 006, septum; y = 0. 006 x + 0, posterior wall). Subgroup analysis showed that the healthy controls, patients with cardiomyopathy, and patients with pulmonary hypertension had similar slopes and intercepts for their individual regression equations. CONCLUSIONS [...] These data support the hypothesis of a quantitative relation between the extent of <b>cyclic</b> <b>variation</b> of echo amplitude and the degree of segmental myocardial shortening, as measured by systolic wall thickening, which is not significantly influenced by location within the myocardium, left ventricular performance, or wall motion. They provide further evidence of the usefulness of quantitative analysis of myocardial echo amplitude in the study of regional myocardial function in both normal and injured myocardium...|$|R
40|$|Naturally, {{there are}} complex {{interactions}} among {{internal combustion engine}} parameters such as in-cylinder pressure, emissions, speed, and load. These basic relationships are studied in a naturally aspirated, spark-ignited, two-stroke, large-bore natural gas engine. The typical application for such an engine is operating heavy machinery such as large compressors and oil field pump jacks. Cylinder pressure averaged over 300 cycles is captured for eight speeds from 350 to 525 RPM and six loads of 50 % to 100 % of maximum torque at each respective speed. Non-sequential individual cycle pressure curves are captured to depict <b>cyclic</b> <b>variation</b> at each operating point. Emissions are measured for each operating point. Equivalence ratio, delivery ratio, and trapping efficiencies are also calculated. The behavior of these parameters are then quantified and described {{in the context of}} <b>cyclic</b> <b>variation.</b> It is shown that low load <b>cyclic</b> <b>variation</b> is extreme, having coefficient of variance (COV) of indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP) values over 40 %. Low load cycles are shown to frequently misfire or experience partial burn. <b>Cyclic</b> <b>variation</b> is shown to decrease with increasing load and decreasing speed. Air flow rate is shown to increase with engine speed. It is also shown that the overall system equivalence ratio is highest at high loads and low speeds, and the values are between 0. 55 and 0. 90. Brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) is suspected to decrease with increasing load, likely due to improved scavenging at high load. Delivery ratio is shown to be, on average, slightly greater than 1. 0 at most operating conditions. Fuel trapping efficiency has a complex trend with increasing speed. Air trapping efficiencies disagree with those calculated for fuel, and are likely incorrect due to the lean-burning nature of the engine. Scavenging efficiency results are not credible. Emissions of CO 2, NO, and THC are shown (and emissions of CH 4 are suspected) to have an inverse correlation with cyclic variation; emissions of O 2 are shown (and emissions of CO are suspected) to have direct correlation with <b>cyclic</b> <b>variation...</b>|$|R
40|$|Sodium nitroprusside, {{a potent}} vasodilator, was {{evaluated}} for {{its effect on}} platelet aggregation in stenosed and endothelium-injured coronary arteries in a canine model. Twenty-five anesthetized dogs were studied; coronary blood flow velocity was continuously monitored. Recurrent intracoronary platelet aggregation and dislodgment (indicated by <b>cyclic</b> <b>variations</b> in coronary blood flow) were induced by mechanically injuring and stenosing the left anterior descending coronary artery. Sodium nitroprusside was administered either intrapericardially or intravenously 30 min after <b>cyclic</b> flow <b>variations</b> were established. Intrapericardial administration of saline (control) did not affect <b>cyclic</b> flow <b>variations</b> in any of 6 tested dogs. Sodium nitroprusside abolished <b>cyclic</b> flow <b>variations</b> in all 7 dogs (100 %) when given intrapericardially and in 5 to 7 dogs (71 %) when given intravenously (compared to intrapericardial salines, p < 0. 01). A smaller dose of sodium nitroprusside was required to abolish <b>cyclic</b> flow <b>variations</b> when given intrapericardially than when given intravenously (1. 6 +/- 0. 5 micrograms. kg- 1. min- 1 vs 4. 8 +/- 0. 8 micrograms. kg- 1. min- 1, p < 0. 01). The mean aortic pressure was reduced by 10 to 20 mmHg after intrapericardial sodium nitroprusside administration and by 30 to 40 mmHg after intravenous sodium nitroprusside administration. To investigate the mechanism of protection by sodium nitroprusside, NG-monomethyl-L-arginine, an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthetase, was used to induce <b>cyclic</b> flow <b>variations</b> in mildly injured and stenosed left anterior descending coronary arteries in 5 dogs. Intrapericardial sodium nitroprusside abolished the <b>cyclic</b> flow <b>variations</b> in all 5 dogs. Then oxyhemoglobin, an inhibitor of nitric oxide, was administered into the left anterior descending coronary arteries of these dogs, and it restored the sodium nitroprusside-abolished <b>cyclic</b> flow <b>variations</b> in all 5 dogs. Thus, sodium nitroprusside protects against platelet aggregation and <b>cyclic</b> flow <b>variations</b> in stenosed and endothelium-injured canine coronary arteries, probably {{by the action of}} nitric oxide, and it is more effective and hemodynamically safer when administered intrapericardially than when administered intravenously...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectives. The {{purpose of}} this study was to test the {{hypothesis}} that free oxygen radicals contribute to platelet aggregation and <b>cyclic</b> flow <b>variations</b> in stenosed and endothelium-injured coronary arteries. Background. Although free oxygen radicals, such as superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide, have been shown to alter platelet function in vitro, the potential role of free oxygen radicals has not been fully described in an in vivo model of coronary artery thrombosis. Methods. <b>Cyclic</b> flow <b>variations</b> were produced in dogs by an external constrictor placed at the site of the left anterior descending coronary artery with injured endothelium. Blood flow in this artery was monitored by a pulsed Doppler flow probe. If <b>cyclic</b> How <b>variations</b> were observed during postoperative days, dogs intravenously received superoxide dismutase plus catalase. In anesthetized dogs that did not develop an episode of <b>cyclic</b> flow <b>variations,</b> the effect of intracoronary infusion of xanthine plus xanthine oxidase or hydrogen peroxide on arterial blood flow velocity was studied. In platelet studies, the effect of free oxygen radicals and radical scavengers on platelet aggregation was examined. Result. In conscious dogs with <b>cyclic</b> flow <b>variations,</b> superoxide dismutase plus catalase significantly reduced <b>cyclic</b> flow <b>variations</b> (n = 7), whereas saline infusion had no effect (n = 7), The infusion of xanthine plus xanthine oxidase or hydrogen peroxide significantly induced <b>cyclic</b> flow <b>variations</b> in four of six dogs or in five of seven dogs, respectively. In vitro platelet studies showed that xanthine plus xanthine oxidase or hydrogen peroxide significantly enhanced platelet aggregation, and superoxide dismutase or catalase significantly inhibited such aggregation. Conclusion. Reduction of free radical formation decreases platelet aggregation and may eliminate <b>cyclic</b> flow <b>variations,</b> whereas promotion of free radical generation enhances platelet aggregation and may induce <b>cyclic</b> flow <b>variations.</b> Thus, free oxygen radicals are an important mediator in this model...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{object of}} this study was to test the {{hypothesis}} that administration of both serotonin S 2 and thromboxane A 2 -prostaglandin H 2 (PGH 2) receptor antagonists provides significant protection against epinephrine-induced cyclic coronary artery flow variations in open chest, anesthetized dogs with severe proximal coronary artery stenosis and endothelial injury. Three groups of dogs were studied. In Group 1 (n = 7) and Group 2 (n = 6), <b>cyclic</b> coronary flow <b>variations</b> were initiated after placement of a concentric constrictor around the left anterior descending coronary artery and were abolished by administration of either a thromboxane A 2 -prostaglandin H 2 receptor antagonist, SQ 29, 548 (SQ) (Group 1), or a serotonin S 2 receptor antagonist, LY 53, 857 (LY) (Group 2). <b>Cyclic</b> flow <b>variations</b> were restored with an epinephrine infusion and the second antagonist (LY for Group 1; SQ for Group 2) was administered to abolish epinephrine-induced <b>cyclic</b> flow <b>variations.</b> The rate of epinephrine infusion was increased until <b>cyclic</b> coronary flow <b>variations</b> returned (n = 8) or significant hemodynamic changes occurred. Plasma epinephrine concentrations were determined during a control period of <b>cyclic</b> coronary flow <b>variations,</b> after epinephrine restored <b>cyclic</b> flow <b>variations</b> in the presence of either SQ or LY, and again after epinephrine restored <b>cyclic</b> flow <b>variations</b> in the presence of both SQ and LY. A third group of dogs (Group 3, n = 9) required both SQ and LY to eliminate the initial <b>cyclic</b> coronary flow <b>variations</b> and infused epinephrine restored <b>cyclic</b> flow <b>variations</b> (n = 8). Plasma epinephrine concentrations were determined during a control period and after <b>cyclic</b> coronary flow <b>variation</b> restoration with epinephrine. Yohimbine, an alpha 2 -receptor antagonist, eliminated epinephrine-induced <b>cyclic</b> coronary flow <b>variations</b> in the presence of both SQ and LY in most dogs. Plasma epinephrine at control was 0. 03 ± 0. 01 ng/ml plasma (n = 22). Plasma epinephrine concentrations of 3. 11 ± 0. 63 ng/ml (n = 13) were required to restore <b>cyclic</b> coronary flow <b>variations</b> in the presence of either SQ or LY. Restoration of <b>cyclic</b> flow <b>variations</b> in the presence of both SQ and LY required a plasma epinephrine concentration of 13. 9 ± 4. 8 ng/ml (n = 18). <b>Cyclic</b> flow <b>variations</b> could not be restored in the presence of both SQ and LY in four dogs; plasma epinephrine in these dogs was 64. 8 ± 18. 3 ng/ml. Thus, combined serotonin and thromboxane receptor antagonists provide substantial protection against epinephrine-restored <b>cyclic</b> coronary flow <b>variations</b> in this experimental model. In fact, the plasma epinephrine concentrations required to restore <b>cyclic</b> flow <b>variations</b> in the presence of both receptor antagonists were considerably higher than those normally encountered in patients during maximal exercise or with myocardial infarction...|$|R
