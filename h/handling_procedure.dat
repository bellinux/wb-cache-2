50|$|The {{fundamental}} communications {{mechanism in}} the Microwindows API is the message. A message {{consists of a}} well-known message number, and two parameters, known as wParam and lParam. Messages are stored in an application's message-queue, and retrieved via the GetMessage function. The application blocks while waiting for a message. There are messages that correspond to hardware events, like WM_CHAR for keyboard input or WM_LBUTTONDOWN for mouse button down. In addition, events signaling window creation and destruction WM_CREATE and WM_DESTROY are sent. In most cases, a message {{is associated with a}} window, identified as an HWND. After retrieving the message, the application sends the message to the associated window's <b>handling</b> <b>procedure</b> using DispatchMessage. When a window class is created, its associated message <b>handling</b> <b>procedure</b> is specified, so the system knows where to send the message.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Fast {{convergence}} of BGP routes, coupled with reduced message complexity form {{one of the}} key factors determining the stability and performance of inter-domain routing in the Internet. This paper characterizes the impact of topology and the message <b>handling</b> <b>procedure</b> of BGP on its convergence time. For BGP router networks characterized by random graphs, we obtain analytic expressions to evaluate the convergence times {{in terms of the number}} of Minimum Route Advertisement Interval (MRAI) timer rounds. We then isolate artifacts in the BGP message <b>handling</b> <b>procedure</b> which lead to redundant MRAI timer instances and propose minor but effective modifications which significantly reduce the convergence times. Simulation results show that the proposed changes can successfully eliminate all redundant instantiations of the MRAI timer, even in the worst case convergence scenarios resulting from route withdrawals.

40|$|Early-life {{events may}} induce {{alterations}} in neuronal function in adulthood. A crucial aspect in studying long-lasting effects induced by environmental interventions imposed {{to the animal}} several weeks before is finding a stable change that could be causally related to the phenotype observed in adulthood. In order to explain an adult trait, it seems necessary to look back to early life and establish a temporal line between events. The neonatal <b>handling</b> <b>procedure</b> is an experimental tool to analyze the long-lasting impact of early-life events. Aside from the neuroendocrine response to stress, neonatal handling also alters the functionality of the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonad (HPG) axis. Reductions in ovulation and surge of the luteinizing hormone (LH) on the proestrous day were shown in female rats. Considering {{the importance of the}} medial preoptic area (MPA) for the control of ovulation, the present study aimed to verify the effects of neonatal handling on the numerical density and cell size in the MPA in 11 -day-old and 90 -day-old female rats. Cellular proliferation was also assessed using BrdU (5 -bromo- 2 `-deoxyuridine) in 11 -day-old pups. Results showed that neonatal handling induces a stable {{reduction in the number of}} cells and in the size of the cell soma, which were lower in handled females than in nonhandled ones at both ages. Cellular proliferation in the MPA was also reduced 24 h after the last manipulation. The repeated mother-infant disruption imposed by the <b>handling</b> <b>procedure</b> ""lesioned"" the MPA. The dysfunction in the ovulation mechanisms induced by the <b>handling</b> <b>procedure</b> could be related to that neuronal loss.

40|$|Background The {{diagnosis}} of encephalitis {{depends on the}} finding of pathogens in the brain parenchyma or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). But the success rates of finding pathogens by microscope are low by the traditional specimens <b>handling</b> <b>procedure</b> in which pathogens are detected by direct centrifugation of CSF getting from lumbar puncture. The process of pathogen collection from the CSF such as centrifugation and washing would cause the destruction and loss of pathogens, resulting in a lower rate of pathogen discovery. Therefore, {{in order to increase}} the detection rate of pathogenic microorganisms in CSF, these traditional steps need to be improved. Methods CSF samples of 23 patients with suspected viral encephalitis and 10 control patients with fracture were prepared by two methods: traditional specimens <b>handling</b> <b>procedure</b> (TSHP) and improved specimens <b>handling</b> <b>procedure</b> (ISHP). In the ISHP, a final concentration of 2. 5 % glutaraldehyde was added to CSF in a glass tube, mixed and kept not moving in 4 ℃ for 2 to 4 h or in 37 ℃for 1 h. Then a smear was made from the sediment formed in the tube to check pathogens by microscope. As for the TSHP, pathogens were collected by direct centrifugation of CSF which had not been treated after lumbar puncture, and checked through Gimenze staining. Results There was no statistically significant difference between the two dealing procedures in the control group (P = 1. 000). As for the case group, there were 10 cases showing positive in Pandy test after TSHP, and visible sediments were seen in all the 23 cases after ISHP. There was statistically significant difference between two kinds of CSF treatment for the finding of pathogens (P = 0. 000). Seven cases presented pathogen growth in CSF and were diagosed as rickettsial infections by Gimenze staining, immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR).

Significantly altered genes were identified in livers of animals following 1 or 4 days of handling when compared to the unhandled animals. Gene changes in animals handled for 4 days were similar to those handled for 1 day, suggesting a lack of habituation. The altered genes were primarily immune function related genes.
