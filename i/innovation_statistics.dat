40|$|Empirical {{evidence}} shows {{that the number of}} patents per R&D dollar declines with firm size. In this paper, we propose a Schumpeterian growth model that accounts for this evidence. We analyze an economy with firms that engage in cost-reducing innovation resulting from the accumulation of both codified and tacit knowledge: the former occurs through the purchase of patents, while the latter is the result of R&D conducted in-house by firms. We study the relation between knowledge appropriability and market structure, and we show that a shift from patents to in-house research occurs as firm size gets larger. Since <b>innovation</b> <b>statistics</b> concentrate mainly on patents, this process of research reallocation results into an under-estimation of innovative activity and is responsible for the declining ratio of patents to R&D expenditure.

40|$|A {{methodology}} for model error estimation is proposed and {{examined in this}} study. It provides estimates of the dynamical model state, the bias, and the empirical parameters by combining three approaches: 1) ensemble data assimilation, 2) state augmentation, and 3) parameter and model bias estimation. Uncertainties of these estimates are also determined, {{in terms of the}} analysis and forecast error covariances, employing the same methodology. The model error estimation approach is evaluated in application to Korteweg–de Vries–Burgers (KdVB) numerical model within the framework of maximum likelihood ensemble filter (MLEF). Experimental results indicate improved filter performance due to model error estimation. The <b>innovation</b> <b>statistics</b> also indicate that the estimated uncertainties are reliable. On the other hand, neglecting model errors—either {{in the form of an}} incorrect model parameter, or a model bias—has detrimental effects on data assimilation, in some cases resulting in filter divergence.

40|$|Many {{innovation}} studies {{focus on}} innovation as an outcome measured by patents or <b>innovation</b> <b>statistics</b> {{and tend to}} neglect the notion that innovation processes are contingent and unfold over time.

However, this paper examines how local and non-local knowledge sourcing vary throughout the innovation process and seeks to clarify whether the innovation process {{can be understood as}} multi-locational. The paper applies a biographical approach that focuses on the innovation process as it unfolds over time and through space from idea generation through problem solving to implementation. The study finds that patterns of knowledge interactions vary throughout innovation processes, that the core level of innovative activities frequently changes its physical location and that the locality of the firm seems to play a larger role early in the innovation process rather than at later stages...|$|E

40|$|Covariance {{inflation}} {{plays an}} important role within ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) in preventing filter divergence and handling model errors. However the inflation factor needs to be tuned and tuning a parameter in EnKF is expensive. Wang and Bishop (2003), followed by Miyoshi (2005), adaptively estimated the inflation factor from the <b>innovation</b> <b>statistics.</b> Although the results were satisfactory it is clear that this inflation factor estimation method relies on the accuracy of the estimated observation error covariance, which in practice is not perfectly known. In this study we propose to estimate the inflation factor and observational errors simultaneously within the EnKF. Our results for the Lorenz- 96 model show that without accurate observation error statistics, a scheme for adaptively estimating inflation alone does not work appropriately. By contrast, the simultaneous approach works very well in the perfect model scenario and in the presence of random model errors or small systematic model bias. For an imperfect model with large model bias, our algorithm may require the application of an additional method to remove the bias...|$|E

From the <b>innovation</b> <b>statistics</b> and rank histograms, the EnKF behaves well in terms of ensemble spread, despite some spread deficiency in low-tropospheric winds and warm and moist biases. Assimilation of targeted dropsonde observations leads to improved initial position and subsequent track forecast compared with experiments that only assimilate conventional observations. In the meantime, assimilation of TC position reduces the initial position error, whereas assimilation of minimum sea level pressure (SLP) information is efficient to analyse the strong vortex structures of TC and reduces track forecast errors.

In particular, {{the construction of the}} correlation functions can be improved to give more flexibility. We describe a correlation operator that features high correlations within a short scale and weak correlations within a larger scale. This multiple length scale correlation operator is defined as a linear combination of Whittle–Matérn functions with different length scales. The main characteristics of the resulting correlation function are described. In particular, a focus is given on features that might be of interest to determine the parameters of the model: the Daley length scale, the normalised spectrum inflexion point and the kurtosis coefficient. The multiple length scale operator has been implemented in NEMOVAR, a variational ocean data assimilation system. A dual length scale formulation was tested in a one-year reanalysis and compared with a single length scale formulation. The results emphasise the importance of estimating with great care the factors used within the combination.

We start by performing non parametric tests on TFP distributions on different groups of firms characterized by their export and innovation behavior. We show that the TFP distributions of exporters and innovators stochastically dominate those of non exporters and of non innovators, respectively. We pursue with OLS regressions and show that the export premium, defined as the productivity advantage of exporters over non-exporters, is robust {{to the introduction of}} <b>innovation</b> <b>statistics.</b> We conclude that export and innovation each have specific mechanisms in their relationship with productivity. The contribution of innovation abilities remains however small: once controlled for the firm size, its ownership, and its innovation abilities, the residual export premium is still around 3 %. Two additional results are found. First, both process and product innovations are associated with higher productivity when process innovation is strictly defined. Second, when accounting for distance to export markets, the export premium remains significant for global exporters only, whereas that of intra-Europe exporters vanishes. From these findings, we conclude that, beyond innovative abilities and mere size advantage, specific export-related competencies, such as specific managerial competencies or specific human capital, takes an important part in the success of Global exporters...|$|E

The `Class 4 ' in the title refers to a set of forecast verification metrics defined in the MERSEA-IP/GODAE internal metrics document (Hernandez 2007), the defining feature of which is that comparisons between forecasts and observations take place in observation space. This approach is seen as a departure from other diagnostic approaches such as analysing model trends or <b>innovation</b> <b>statistics,</b> and is commonly used in the atmospheric community. The physical parameters involved in the comparison are sea surface temperature (SST), sub-surface temperature, sub-surface salinity and sea level anomaly (SLA).
