500|$|The song {{begins with}} a [...] "strange, electronic, {{slightly}} broken noise" [...] that spans between {{the start of the}} song up until 54 seconds. The ambient-influenced beginning gives the impression that [...] "Nothing Really Matters" [...] would be a ballad, but in the minute mark, it changes to a mid-tempo dance-pop song. The ambient music becomes restrained, although a cursory bleeping sound can be heard from the right to the left. The background has a number of faint strings in it, which signifies the depth of the stereo field. The chorus starts with a fast-pacing dance sound, over which Madonna sings, [...] "Nothing really matters / love <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>we</b> need / everything I give you / all comes back to me." [...] Throughout the entire song, it includes two verses, three choruses, one bridge section, and an outro. The bridge is backed by piano sounds with a descending sequence by a couple of bars. Madonna sings the same lyrics in the outro, but is slowed down and echoed longer until the music fades out.|$|E

That <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>we</b> {{have to do is}} put ourselves at his disposal...is an extremely important message.

According to Peter Robb: [...] "The foreign correspondents who covered what was soon being called the War of Canudos, {{as if it were a}} conflict between nations rather than the extermination of a tiny community within a single country, were nearly all embedded with the army of the Brazilian republic."(Robb, 2004:215). [...] Euclides da Cunha did not see the fighting [...] but did bear witness afterward.
