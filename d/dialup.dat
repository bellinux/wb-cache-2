25|$|It {{should be}} noted however that due to Telstra's {{extensive}} use of pair-gain technology for connecting home landlines from 1994 to 2000, some homes have been excluded from ADSL and are limited to a <b>dialup</b> speed of 28.8 kbit/s.|$|E
25|$|The Policy Block List (PBL) {{is similar}} to a <b>Dialup</b> Users List. The PBL lists not only dynamic IP {{addresses}} but also static addresses that should not be sending email directly to third-party servers. Examples of such are an ISP's core routers, corporate users required by policy to send their email via company servers, and unassigned IP addresses. Much of the data is provided to Spamhaus by the organizations that control the IP address space, typically ISPs.|$|E
25|$|The Apple Pippin {{platform}} {{was based}} on the PowerPC Platform, a platform designed and supported by IBM and Apple. The PowerPC 603 processor is based on RISC design, thereby allowing peripherals to rely on the Pippin CPU. For example, instead of relying on a fully featured analog modem, the Pippin has a GeoPort serial port. Various <b>dialup</b> Internet service providers (ISP)—including Prodigy, America On-Line, and eWorld—were supported by the Pippin platform, as well as generic ISPs.|$|E
25|$|State-owned Etisalat {{and private}} du {{communication}} companies provide telephone and cell phone {{service to the}} city. Cellular coverage is extensive, and both GSM and CDMA (from Etisalat and Du) services are available. Etisalat, the government owned telecommunications provider, held a virtual monopoly over telecommunication services in Abu Dhabi prior {{to the establishment of}} other, smaller telecommunications companies such as Emirates Integrated Telecommunications Company (EITC — better known as Du) in 2006. Internet was introduced into Abu Dhabi in 1995. The current network is supported by a bandwidth of 6 GB, with 50,000 <b>dialup</b> and 150,000 broadband ports.|$|E
25|$|By 1995, {{many of the}} DOS-based BBSes {{had begun}} {{switching}} to modern multitasking operating systems, such as OS/2, Windows 95, and Linux. One of the first graphics based BBS applications was Excalibur BBS with a low bandwidth applications that required its own client for efficiency. This led {{to one of the}} earliest implementations of Electronic Commerce in 1996 with replication of partner stores around the globe. TCP/IP networking allowed most of the remaining BBSes to evolve and include Internet hosting capabilities. Recent BBS software, such as Synchronet, Mystic BBS, EleBBS, DOC or Wildcat! BBS, provide access using the Telnet protocol rather than <b>dialup,</b> or by using legacy DOS-based BBS software with a FOSSIL-to-Telnet redirector such as NetFoss.|$|E
25|$|As {{is it was}} prohibitively {{expensive}} for the hobbyist SysOp to have a dedicated connection to another system, FidoNet was developed as a store and forward network. Private email (Netmail), public message boards (Echomail) and eventually even file attachments on a FidoNet-capable BBS would be bundled into one or more archive files over a set time interval. These archive files were then compressed with ARC or ZIP and forwarded to (or polled by) another nearby node or hub via a <b>dialup</b> Xmodem session. Messages would be relayed around various FidoNet hubs until they were eventually delivered to their destination. The hierarchy of FidoNet BBS nodes, hubs, and zones was maintained in a routing table called a Nodelist. Some larger BBSes or regional FidoNet hubs would make several transfers per day, some even to multiple nodes or hubs, and as such, transfers usually occurred at night or early morning when toll rates were lowest. In Fido's heyday, sending a Netmail message to a user on a distant FidoNet node, or participating in an Echomail discussion could take days, especially if any FidoNet nodes or hubs in the message's route only made one transfer call per day.|$|E
500|$|Internet {{service and}} Internet cafés are well established; these are mostly served through broadband, data card of {{different}} mobile services, WLL, <b>dialup</b> lines, Kalimpong News, Kalimpong Online News, Kalimpong Times [...] and KTV {{are the main}} online news sites that collect and present local and North Bengal & Sikkim news from its own agencies like KalimNews and other newspapers. Besides this there are others like kalimpong.info, kalimpongexpress.blogspot.com and several others.|$|E
500|$|The {{gameplay}} {{was praised}} for its variety {{of weapons and}} enemies. Game Revolution said that each enemy is [...] "unique both in ability, structure, and behavior so that each requires a specific combat approach". Maximum PC reviewer Josh Norem praised the levels for their interesting objectives, stating that the missions [...] "vary widely, ranging from finding lost colleagues to defending strategic structures against enemy assaults". Computer Games Magazine praised {{the fact that the}} developers replaced the wire-frame automaps of previous Descent games with flat-shaded polygons because they [...] "provide more detail and make it easier to recognize where you are and how to get where you want to go". The multiplayer was highlighted positively due to its replay value and variety of game types. Computer Games Magazine also credited its [...] "rock-solid performance on standard <b>dialup</b> modems and easy connectivity", while GameSpot praised it for being [...] "fun and stable". The game was a runner-up for GameSpy's Action Game of the Year and a nominee for GameSpot's PC Action Game of the Year. Despite the positive reviews, the game did not perform well in sales. As a result, Daily Radar awarded the game a [...] "System Shock Award", named after the Looking Glass Studios 1994 game of the same name, implying that Descent 3 is a [...] "game that the critics loved but is over-shadowed by lesser or greater games".|$|E
2500|$|The modern forum {{originated}} from bulletin boards, and so-called computer conferencing systems, {{and are a}} technological evolution of the <b>dialup</b> bulletin board system. From a technological standpoint, forums or boards are web applications managing user-generated content.|$|E
2500|$|Despite the {{bandwidth}} limitations, transparent TCP/IP is supported. [...] Iridium claims {{data rates}} up to 10 {{kilobits per second}} for their [...] "direct Internet" [...] service which utilizes v.42bis compression over a PPP <b>dialup</b> connection to Iridium's Arizona gateway. [...] Actual data rates remain at 2300 to 2400 bit/s for any compressed data such as a JPG image or ZIP file, but plain text or HTML may transfer [...] "up to" [...] 10 kbit/s. [...] Iridium 9500, 9505 and 9505A phones can be connected to computers using an RS-232 connection, as can the 9522A transceiver module. [...] The 9555 and Extreme phones connect to computers with a standard USB cable, using an internal USB to serial bridge chip and Windows drivers to emulate a serial COM port for compatibility with standard PPP clients.|$|E
2500|$|Rating {{the overall}} system at 6.0 out of 10.0, IGN's Peer Schneider finds the {{industrial}} design {{language of the}} 64DD and its accessories to perfectly match and integrate {{with that of the}} Nintendo 64, with no user-accessible moving parts, a single mechanical eject button, sharing the N64's power button, and child-friendly usability. [...] Installation is said to be [...] "quick and painless", operation is [...] "even simpler", and the whole system [...] "couldn't be easier to use". [...] Software load times are described as [...] "minimal", where the most complex possible point of the system's library reaches about five seconds. [...] The site says that the 64DD popularity was inherently limited, due in part to its limited release in Japan, a country which had a limited adoption of the Nintendo 64 and of <b>dialup</b> Internet connectivity.|$|E
2500|$|In April 1999, Nintendo {{ended their}} {{partnership}} with St.GIGA which {{had created the}} Super Famicom's proprietary Satellaview online service in Japan, broadcasting from April 23, 1995, to June 30, 2000. [...] The company then partnered with Japanese media company Recruit to develop the 64DD's completely new proprietary online service called Randnet (a portmanteau of [...] "Recruit and Nintendo network"). The resulting equity-owned joint Japanese corporation was announced on June 30, 1999, as RandnetDD Co., Ltd. Active only ever in Japan, from December 1, 1999, to February 28, 2001, the Randnet service allowed gamers to surf the Internet including a members-only portal, and to share user-generated game data. The subscription fee included the <b>dialup</b> Internet service, 64DD system hardware, and a delivery schedule of game disks by mail. Reportedly, Nintendo and several third party game developers had originally planned multiplayer online gaming as being more important than even a web browser.|$|E

50|$|Ascend Communications {{designed}} and manufactured equipment for high density <b>dialup</b> installations, {{most notably the}} MAX TNT, which allowed for a DS3 of <b>dialup</b> lines to be terminated in a few rack units. Customers such as AOL, Earthlink, and UUnet purchased over two million <b>dialup</b> ports worth of MAX TNT access servers during the <b>dialup</b> days of the internet. Many companies still use MAX TNT for <b>dialup</b> (look for TNT in <b>dialup</b> hostnames). In the mid-1990s, the company {{was one of the}} leading vendors of ISDN modems and concentrators.|$|E

50|$|The {{bulk of the}} {{companys}} {{revenue was}} generated by the commercial accounts, but <b>dialup</b> accounts did comprise the majority part of WWAs actual end-users -- and <b>dialup</b> offered easily the most problems, as during that point in time, Ameritech and MFS (later SBC and AT&T, and WorldCom, respectively) were going through growing pains due to the exploding popularity of the Internet. Customers <b>dialup</b> calls were often dropped or of such low line quality that little bandwidth could be sustained.|$|E
50|$|In recent years, {{the number}} of {{consumers}} using <b>dialup</b> access has dropped and as the Classic and Plus clients were restricted to <b>dialup</b> access, their subscriber count began to drop. Because the WebTV client was subsidized hardware, the company had always required individual subscriptions for each box, but with the subsidies ended, MSN started offering free use of MSN TV boxes to their computer users who subscribed to MSN, as an incentive to not stray to discount <b>dialup</b> ISPs.|$|E
50|$|Paradise {{was founded}} in Wellington in November 1997 by {{businessman}} Shane Cole. Initially, <b>dialup</b> service was offered in Wellington only. Paradise quickly became a leading <b>dialup</b> ISP in the Wellington region. Service was expanded to Auckland and Christchurch in 1998. A reselling agreement was also entered with Telstra Saturn in 1998, which meant that customers who subscribed to Telstra Saturn's cable telephone and cable TV service could also get Paradise included on their phone bill (either <b>dialup</b> or cable modem service).|$|E

In Spring 2000, T-Online {{becomes the first}} major ISP in Germany to offer a {{flat-rate}} <b>dialup</b> plan for consumers. This was important because local telephone calls in Germany, including <b>dialup</b> access to ISPs, were not offered on a flat price per call (i.e., unlimited) basis. The flat-rate service was also offered to customers with ISDN connections at the same price as for analog service. In Spring 2001, T-Online announced {{the demise of the}} flat-rate <b>dialup</b> plan but offered a flat-rate DSL plan in its place.|$|E
