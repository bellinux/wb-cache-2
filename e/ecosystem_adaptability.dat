Though these features such as hard seeds, nitrogen fixation and anti-nutritional compounds (ANCs) are disadvantageous in the aspects of agronomy, photosytherate accumulation and the processing and consuming of seed respectively, but these may have very important functions in germplasm existence, multiplying and survive to the different circumstances, that had kept to the abundant and distribute <b>ecosystem</b> <b>adaptability</b> of these species extensively. It is important and realistic to discover and utilize of tolerance and resistance to the stress circumstances of Leguminosae, study and inquiry into its adaptability mechanism, for keeping biodiversity and tolerance breeding of these plants...|$|E

40|$|Currently in China {{there are}} growing {{concerns}} about environmental {{issues related to}} the growth of suburban towns. Rapid urbanization and lagged environmental infrastructures resulted in severe environment issues for suburban owns, consequently affecting the sustainable development of suburban areas. In Xiamen, a southeastern coastal city of China, suburban town environmental planning (EP) has been proposed since 2003 as one of the important tools to control pollution and conserve <b>ecosystem.</b> However, <b>adaptability</b> of EP should be improved to integrate its results into the decision-making process. In this paper, the adaptive management was introduced, principles of adaptive suburban town EP were advanced, and the EP process integrating information from multi-source and different stakeholders was summarized according to the experience in Dongfu Town of Xiamen. Ecological functional zoning (EFZ) was identified as the focal element of EP; a method of effective EFZ without compromising scientific consideration was formulated. The experience indicates that the application of proposed EP methods can integrate science into decision-making process, avoiding both narrow-minded viewpoints of planners and natural resource use conflicts among variety of stakeholders. Subsequently, the EP approach enables its results acceptable for local communities and decision-makers. More importantly, sustainable development of targeted areas can be achieved through well-designed environmental planning...|$|R

The short term benefits {{of the use of}} water are high, but could be higher under a sustainable use of the resources seen in a long term perspective, what could guarantee goods services, protection of associated <b>ecosystems</b> as well <b>adaptability</b> to future environmental changes (Climate Change). The environmental flow forms part of a sustainable management of water resources which is based on keeping a good ecological balance. Different methodologies worldwide were reviewed for estimating environmental flows and critical reflection from the Colombian context of the possibilities and constraints to implement them where made. ...|$|R

Complex systems thinking has inspired both theory and applied strategies for improving <b>ecosystem</b> resilience and <b>adaptability,</b> but applications in forest ecology and management {{are just beginning}} to emerge. We review the properties of complex systems using four well-studied forest biomes (temperate, boreal, tropical and Mediterranean) as examples. The lens of complex systems science yields insights into facets of forest structure and dynamics that facilitate comparisons among ecosystems. These biomes share the main properties of complex systems but differ in specific ecological properties, disturbance regimes, and human uses. We show how this approach can help forest scientists and managers to conceptualize forests as integrated social-ecological systems and provide concrete examples of how to manage forests as complex adaptive systems. © 2014 Filotas et al...|$|R
50|$|Those {{in favor}} of the hotspot {{approach}} point out that species are irreplaceable components of the global ecosystem, they are concentrated in places that are most threatened, and should therefore receive maximal strategic protections. The IUCN Red List categories, which appear on Wikipedia species articles, {{is an example of the}} hotspot conservation approach in action; species that are not rare or endemic are listed the least concern and their Wikipedia articles tend to be ranked low on the importance scale. This is a hotspot approach because the priority is set to target species level concerns over population level or biomass. Species richness and genetic biodiversity contributes to and engenders ecosystem stability, <b>ecosystem</b> processes, evolutionary <b>adaptability,</b> and biomass. Both sides agree, however, that conserving biodiversity is necessary to reduce the extinction rate and identify an inherent value in nature; the debate hinges on how to prioritize limited conservation resources in the most cost-effective way.|$|R

40|$|Purpose of {{currently}} running research, {{which is}} part of research program Biological and technological aspects of sustainability of controlled <b>ecosystems</b> and their <b>adaptability</b> to climate change at Faculty of Agronomy, is mapping of progress in water infiltration on selected areas at Žabčice locality and to specify possibilities of a water accumulation and retention influence in a landscape. During of the first year of measurement (2008), from April to November, has proceeded field measurement of soil infiltration ability at Žabčice locality. To get statistically conclusive results, measurement runs in three repetitions and data are subsequently averaged. Three sets of homocentric metal cylinders were used for the measurement. Measurement of infiltration has been preceded by an overflow. Empirical equations according to Kosťjak were used for evaluation of field measurement. At the same time there were ensured intact soil samples for laboratory determination of soil physical properties using Kopecky cylinders at depths of 10, 20 and 30 [*]cm, and for the calculation of selected hydro-physical parameters of soil. ­ reduced volume weight, actual monture, porosity, aeration and other.

Although the genomic and phenotypic diversity of the bacterial component of the oceans has been intensively studied, little is known about the genomic and phenotypic diversity within each of the diverse eukaryotic species present. We report the level of genomic diversity in a natural population of Ostreococcus tauri (Chlorophyta, Mamiellophyceae), the smallest photosynthetic eukaryote. Contrary to the expec- tations of clonal evolution or cryptic species, the spectrum of genomic polymorphism observed suggests a large panmictic population (an effective population size of 1. 2 × 107) with pervasive evidence of sexual reproduction. De novo assemblies of low-coverage chromosomes reveal two large candidate mating-type loci with suppressed recom- bination, whose origin may pre-date the speciation events in the class Mamiellophyceae. This high genetic diversity is associated with large phenotypic differences between strains. Strikingly, resistance of isolates to large double- stranded DNA viruses, which abound in their natural environment, is positively correlated with the size of a single hypervariable chromosome, which contains 44 to 156 kb of strain-specific sequences. Our findings highlight the role of viruses in shaping genome diversity in marine picoeukaryotes...|$|R
