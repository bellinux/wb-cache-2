40|$|High shoring towers, {{the common}} shoring {{solution}} for <b>high</b> <b>clearance</b> <b>construction,</b> cause the entire formwork system {{to account for}} a remarkably high percentage {{of the cost of}} the constructed concrete element. However, data on work inputs in assembly and disassembly of high towers are scarce, and the reason lies in the difficulty in conducting the numerous work studies that would be needed to cover the wide variety of tower types offered by the market and the extensive range of heights to which towers are erected. A model is presented, based on a limited number of work studies, for the prediction of work inputs in the assembly and disassembly of shoring towers of two configurations, rising to heights of up to 30 m. Results of actual measured work input data for three tower models representing three tower types widely used on construction sites are presented. An insight is provided into the anatomy of tower erection, which should make possible use of the proposed methodology for the development of similar models for additional tower types.

One of the most practical yet most reliable protection schemes is installing automatic fire sprinklers on the ceiling.

40|$|Abstract — Maintaining clearance, or {{distance}} from obstacles, {{is a vital}} component of successful motion planning algorithms. Maintaining <b>high</b> <b>clearance</b> often creates safer paths for robots. Contemporary sampling-based planning algorithms that utilize the medial axis, or the set of all points equidistant to two or more obstacles, produce <b>higher</b> <b>clearance</b> paths. However, they are biased heavily toward certain portions of the medial axis, sometimes ignoring parts critical to planning, e. g., specific types of narrow passages. We introduce Uniform Medial Axis Probabilistic RoadMap (UMAPRM), a novel planning variant that generates samples uniformly on the medial axis of the free portion of Cspace. We theoretically analyze the distribution generated by UMAPRM and show its uniformity. Our results show that UMAPRM’s distribution of samples along the medial axis is not only uniform but also preferable to other medial axis samplers in certain planning problems. We demonstrate that UMAPRM has negligible computational overhead over other sampling techniques and can solve problems the others could not, e. g., a bug trap. Finally, we demonstrate UMAPRM successfully generates <b>higher</b> <b>clearance</b> paths in the examples. I...|$|R

40|$|In motion planning, <b>high</b> <b>clearance</b> paths are {{favorable}} due {{to their}} increased visibility and reduction of collision risk such as the safety of problems involving: human- robot cooperation. One popular approach to solving motion planning problems is the Probabilistic Roadman Method (PRM), which generates a graph of the free space of an environment {{referred to as a}} roadmap. In this work we describe a new approach to making <b>high</b> <b>clearance</b> paths when using PRM The medial axis is useful for this since it represents the set of points with maximal clearance and is well defined in higher dimensions. However it can only be computed exactly in workspace. Our goal is to generate roadmaps with paths following the medial axis of an environment without explicitly computing the medial axis. One of the major steps of PRM is local planning: the planning of motion between two nearby nodes PRMs have been used to build roadmaps that have nodes on the medial axis but so far there has been no local planner method proposed for connecting these nodes on the medial axis. These types of <b>high</b> <b>clearance</b> motions are desirable and needed in many robotics applications. This work proposes Medial Axis Local Planner (MALP), a local planner which attempts to connect medial axis configurations via the medial axis. The recursive method takes a simple path between two medial axis configurations and attempts to deform the path to fit the medial axis. This deformation creates paths with <b>high</b> <b>clearance</b> and visibility properties. We have implemented this local planner and have tested it in 2 D and 3 D rigid body and 8 D and 16 D fixed base articulated linkage environments. We compare MALP with a straight-line local planner (SL), a typical local planer used in motion planning that interpolated along a line in the planning space. Our results indicate that MALP generated <b>higher</b> <b>clearance</b> paths than SL local planning. As a result, MALP found more connections and generated fewer connected components as compared to connecting the same nodes using SL connections. Using MALP connects noes on the medial axis, increasing the overall clearance of the roadmap generated...|$|R

40|$|Roof rats (Rattus rattus) live {{mainly in}} human habitats. Heavy use of rodenticides, such as warfarin, {{has led to}} the {{development}} of drug resistance, making pest control difficult. There have been many reports regarding mutations of vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKOR), the target enzyme of warfarin, in resistant rats. However, it has been suggested there are other mechanisms of warfarin resistance. To confirm these possibilities, closed colonies of warfarin-susceptible roof rats (S) and resistant rats from Tokyo (R) were established, and the pharmacokinetics/ pharmacodynamics of warfarin in rats from both colonies was investigated. R rats had low levels of warfarin in serum and <b>high</b> <b>clearance</b> activity. These rats can rapidly metabolize warfarin by hydroxylation. The levels of accumulation in the organs were lower than those of S rats. R rats administered warfarin showed high expression levels of CYP 2 B, 2 C, and 3 A, which play roles in warfarin hydroxylation, and may explain the <b>high</b> <b>clearance</b> ability of R rats. The mechanism of warfarin resistance in roof rats from Tokyo involved not only mutation of VKOR but also <b>high</b> <b>clearance</b> ability due to high levels of CYP 2 B, 2 C and 3 A expression possibly induced by warfarin.

The explanation provided in this paper builds on a simple signaling model. By assumption, lenders have no direct possibility to infer a firm’s financial stance.
