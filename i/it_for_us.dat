500|$|Following Alice in Chains' {{extensive}} 1993 world tour, Staley {{said the}} band [...] "just {{wanted to go}} into the studio for a few days with our acoustic guitars and see what happened". [...] "We never really planned on the music we made at that time to be released. But the record label heard it and they really liked <b>it.</b> <b>For</b> <b>us,</b> it was just the experience of four guys getting together in the studio and making some music." ...|$|E
500|$|It took Meany {{three years}} to {{negotiate}} the merger, {{and he had to}} overcome significant opposition. John L. Lewis of the United Mine Workers called the merger a [...] "rope of sand," [...] and his union refused to join the AFL-CIO. Jimmy Hoffa, second in command of the Teamster's Union, protested, [...] "What's in <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>us?</b> Nothing!" [...] However, the Teamsters went along with the merger initially. Mike Quill, president of the Transport Workers Union of America also fought the merger, saying that it amounted to a capitulation to the [...] "racism, racketeering and raiding" [...] of the AFL.|$|E
500|$|The result kept Burton in {{the lead}} in the Drivers' Championship. After the race, Jeff Gordon (who was {{involved}} in the lap-137 accident) was less optimistic about his championship chances: [...] "This pretty much does <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> as far as I'm concerned for the championship. You knew exactly that something like that was going to happen." [...] In the Manufacturers' Championship Chevrolet increased its point total to 231; Dodge moved into second place with 180 and Ford was a close third with 179. The race took three hours, ten minutes and twenty-three seconds to complete; because it ended under caution, no margin of victory was recorded.|$|E

500|$|In May 1976 Gallacher was {{replaced}} by Russell Dunlop, formerly of Aesop's Fables, Levi Smith's Clefs, SCRA, Mother Earth, and the Johnny Rocco Band. In an interview with Greg Kelton of The Advertiser, Loughnan outlined the band's future: [...] "If Beyond doesn't make <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> in the States {{we might as well}} forget all about Ayers Rock." [...] From May to July they toured the US again, [...] "only achiev limited success overseas." [...] After the tour Dunlop and Loughnan left, and on 25 August Mushroom Records announced that Ayers Rock had broken up after Loughnan decided to remain in the US to study. Brown, Doyle, and McGuire indicated that they would revive the group with new members.|$|E
500|$|King {{states the}} cover was odd; [...] "It {{took me a}} minute and a half to find a spot in the song where I knew where she was. It's so weird. If she had never told us, we would have never known. You could have played <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> and we'd have been like, 'What's that?' Like {{a minute and a}} half through I heard a line and was like, 'I know where she's at!" [...] In response, Slayer sent some T-shirts to Amos, which she said was appreciated. Hanneman echoed similar sentiments as King, but noted that a few years later when Slayer was playing a festival before Amos, Amos would allow Slayer to play a full set when the band was late.|$|E
500|$|Whedon {{noted that}} the pod does not entirely {{take place in the}} Framework, and that the {{characters}} [...] "have their full memories of what happened" [...] once they return to the real world. Some, such as Fitz, struggle with their actions in the Framework. The producers felt the impact of the [...] "what if" [...] scenario comes from rooting the changes in character choices, with Bell saying, [...] "I will give the writers room credit that everything that was chosen had an emotional resonance. It was something you hadn’t seen, or wanted to see or wondered about, so for us it was really rich territory to mine." [...] Whedon added, [...] "It wasn’t just, 'OK, let’s go Wacky World!' It was, 'What if you’d made different decisions?' That made <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> a much more fun puzzle." [...] Regarding the season finale and setting up the next season, Bell said that [...] "Each year we’ve tried to reinvent the series in some way ... I think the end [...] really does suggest something quite different." ...|$|E

500|$|David Whitehouse of Wonderland Magazine {{declared}} the [...] "Bad Boys" [...] video as [...] "the {{birth of a}} pop star". After commenting that America generates better, glossier pop than the British, such as the [...] "holy trinity of 21st century pop music", Christina Aguilera, Britney Spears, and Justin Timberlake, Whitehouse said that the video looked and sounded American, [...] "dripping" [...] with [...] "dollar signs and expensive lenses". The review commending Burke's look in the video calling her, [...] "the gutsier, sassier alternative to the anaemic, high school warbling of, say, Kelly Clarkson or the pre-pubescent offal piped into our children by Miley Cyrus." [...] Whitehouse stated, [...] "It has pomposity, big dance routines, cars built like tanks, moody street hunks (also built like tanks), stunts, jewellery and a rapper, Flo Rida, who in honesty, could have been anyone". He went on to say, [...] "If {{we want to make}} a megastar, let the Americans do <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>us.</b> They make megastars. If Alexandra Burke {{is going to be the}} pop star we want her to be, she’s going the right way about it".|$|E
500|$|... "Raining Blood" [...] {{was covered}} by Tori Amos on her 2001 album Strange Little Girls.

Like {{a minute and a half}} through I heard a line and was like, 'I know where she's at!'". The band, however, liked the cover enough to send Slayer T-shirts to her. The song was also covered by Malevolent Creation, Chimaira, Vader, Dokaka, Reggie and the Full Effect and Killick Erik Hinds, who covered the entire album on a H'arpeggione. [...] "Raining Blood" [...] was also covered by the New Zealand drum and bass band Concord Dawn on their 2003 album Uprising, and by Nashville, Tennessee band Asschapel on their 7" [...] "Satanation". A medley of [...] "Raining Blood" [...] and [...] "Postmortem" [...] appears on Body Count's 2016 album Bloodlust, preceded by a short monologue by lead singer Ice-T where he names Slayer as both a major influence on Body Count and as one of his favorite bands of all time [...] "and always will be"; a video for Body Count's version was released in August of 2017.|$|E

2500|$|Cyril of Alexandria, his {{antagonist}} Theodoret, and Theodore of Mopsuestia, who was {{loose from}} all tradition, {{had the same}} clear belief.

For the Son shall come down, as Judge, in the glory of the Father, attended by the angels, and shall 'sit on the throne of His glory, judging the world in righteousness, and shall reward every man according to his works.' But since we are in many sins, well is <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>us,</b> that the divine prophet goes before Him, bringing all those on earth to one mind; that all, being brought to the unity through the faith, and ceasing from evil intents, may fulfill that which is good, and so be saved when the Judge cometh down. The blessed John the Baptist came before Him [...] "in the spirit and power of Elias." [...] But, as he preached saying, 'Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make His paths straight,' so also the divine Elias proclaims His then being near and all-but-present, that He may 'judge the world in righteousness.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{first four}} Tests of the 1926 England v Australia series were {{scheduled}} for {{just three days}} and were all curtailed by poor weather. The final Test at the Oval was timeless to ensure a finish. It {{has become one of}} the most famous matches in cricket history, not because England regained the Ashes for the first time since 1912 but for the manner it which it was achieved as Hobbs and Sutcliffe produced their most famous partnership in treacherous batting conditions. Australia had a narrow first innings lead of 22 and, at close of play on the second day (a Monday), Hobbs and Sutcliffe had taken the England second innings score to 49–0, a lead of 27. [...] Heavy rain fell overnight and next day, as the sun shone, the pitch soon developed into a [...] "sticky wicket" [...] on which it was generally assumed that England would be bowled out cheaply and so lose both the match and the series. [...] But, in spite of the very difficult batting conditions, Hobbs and Sutcliffe put up a great defence of their wickets and gradually increased their partnership to 172 before Hobbs was out for exactly 100. Sutcliffe went on to make 161 and, in the end, England won the game comfortably, by 289 runs, and regained the Ashes. The tributes paid to Hobbs and Sutcliffe after this partnership are extensive. Pelham Warner perhaps encapsulated them all when he wrote: [...] "Hobbs and Sutcliffe won <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> by their incomparable batting.
