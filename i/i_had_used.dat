I left my {{cup of tea}} undrunk and rushed {{back to the office}} to tell Mr Philby. He wasn't there, but there was a light in Sir Percy's room. I went in and told him. He bade me go at once to Sasun Eff and charged me to make him change his mind. I set off feeling as if I carried the future of the 'Iraq in my hands, but when I got to Sasun's house to my immense relief I found Mr Philby and Capt Clayton already there. The Naqib had got Sasun's letter and had sent Mr Philby off post haste. I arrived, however, in the nick of time. They had exhausted all their arguments and Sasun still adhered to his decision. I think my immense anxiety must have inspired me for after an hour of concentrated argument he was visibly shaken, {{in spite of the fact}} that his brother Sha'al (whom I also admire and respect) came in and did his best against us. Finally however we persuaded him that Sir Percy had no desire to thrust Talib or anyone else upon Mesopotamia, but that Talib like everyone else must be given his chance. If he proved valuable he would take his part in the foundation of national institutions, if not he was politically a dead man. We got Sasun Eff to consent to think it over and to come and see Sir Percy next day. I had an inner conviction that the game was won—partly, thank heaven, to the relations of trust and confidence which I personally had already established with Sasun—but we none of us could feel sure. You will readily understand that I didn't sleep much that night. I turned and turned in my mind the arguments <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>used</b> and wondered if I could not have done better.|$|E

Well, I'm not James Joyce am I? When I came to work on this project I thought I would ask for permission again and this time they said yes." ...|$|E

The first phase of the project involves a discussion of the occupational therapy method named School AMPS and how it is used in the intervention on children with brain damage. The second phase of the study is a description and an analysis of an intervention that’s based on Lev Vygotsky learning theory. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>used</b> the theory to argue for the need to focus on the social aspect when students are leaning, and furthermore how the students are dependent of the supervision and interaction with the adult. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>used</b> two different kinds of observations to obtain material and to answer the questions posed in the study. For School amps <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>used</b> the method observation without participation and after that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>used</b> a method called “interaction-based observation”. The findings may be useful in planning of Occupational Therapy intervention, but also to provide inspiration for learning and teaching generally in schools...|$|R
