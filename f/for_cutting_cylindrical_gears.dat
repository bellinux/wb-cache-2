40|$|The {{localization}} of {{the contact}} patch by <b>cylindrical</b> <b>gears</b> is realized usually through the flank grinding operation. This is achieved due by the continuous {{modification of the}} tooth thickness on the pitch circle. The tooth contact by external gears, as it knows by previous studies, will be produced between convex tooth flanks. M??t?? and Hollanda in [5] proposes a new procedure of <b>cutting</b> <b>cylindrical</b> <b>gears</b> using a milling head whose cutting edges are aligned on an Archimedic spiral. The meshing tooth results with a convex and a concave flank.
