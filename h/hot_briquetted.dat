Models {{for the main}} units of an integrated metallurgical plant (sinter strand, blast furnace, converter) and for promising process integrated pollution control measures (circulating fluidized bed, <b>hot</b> <b>briquetting,</b> hydrocyclone, Inmetco, low blast furnace, oxygen cupola furnace) were created and then various options for residue streams in the plant were simulated. Of special interest were the environmental and process relevant elements zinc, lead, potassium and sodium {{as well as their}} compounds. This modelling method based equally on empirical knowledge and fundamental thermodynamical principles provides profound mass and energy balances. Based on the calculated data, a technical, economical and ecological assessment was made to support decision makers regarding investments in innovative pollution control technologies, which will become necessary in the near future due to decreasing dump capacities and increasing law requirements. The modelling method proved to be suitable for the problem and is going to be applied to other industrial areas (electric steelmaking, non-ferrous metal industry). The first steps to commercialize this tool have already been taken. Within the continuation project (5 / 1997 - 4 / 1999) the existing models are being supplemented and new ones will be created to achieve greater consideration of emission transfers between the environmental media soil, air and water and to improve the possibilities for their application and commercialization.

40|$|The {{integrated}} steelmaking cycle {{based on}} the blast furnace-basic oxygen furnace (BOF) route {{plays an important role}} in the production of plain and ultra-low carbon steel, especially for deep drawing operations. BOF steelmaking is {{based on the}} conversion of cast iron in steel by impinging oxygen on the metal bath at supersonic speed. In order to avoid the addition of detrimental chemical elements owing to the introduction of uncontrolled scrap and in order to decrease environmental impact caused by the intensive use of coke for the production of cast iron, HBI (<b>hot</b> <b>briquetted</b> iron) can be used as a source of metal and a fraction of cast iron. Forty industrial experimental tests were performed to evaluate the viability of the use of HBI in BOF.

40|$|The {{increasing}} use of <b>Hot</b> <b>Briquetted</b> Iron (HBI) as a {{feed stock}} to electric arc furnace (EAF) steelmaking presents significant challenges to producers in terms of energy usage and productivity. In this context, the University of Wollongong has been studying {{the use of the}} hot off gases from EAF's for the preheating of RBI feed to an EAF. Of particular concern is the potential for excessive oxidation of the HBI from the hot oxidised gases. A thermodynamic model was developed to predict what energy savings were available through preheating for different levels of post combustion, heat transfer efficiency and scrap/HBI feed ratios. The results from this model indicated that significant savings were achievable. A thermogravimetric study of HBI was carried out using a range of gases including N 2, CO 2, air, CO 2 /O 2 and CO 2 /O 2 /N 2 mixtures. The study identified that when HBI was heated in an oxidising atmosphere simultaneous oxidation and decarburisation reactions took place.

40|$|Within the {{research}} project {{a system for}} the support of strategic decision called KOSIMEUS has been developed and prototypically applied. All unit operations of an integrated metallurgical plant and an electric steel works (sinter strand, blast furnace, desulphurisation, converter, electric arc furnace) were modelled with a flowsheeting system and simulated in combination with also modelled promising process integrated pollution control measures (<b>hot</b> <b>briquetting,</b> low blast furnace, INMETCO- and COMET-process). The method of problem adequate modelling, which was developed within {{the research}} project, is based equally on empirical knowledge and fundamental thermodynamical principles. It provides profound mass and energy balances, which are the basis for a technical, economical and ecological assessment. Besides the consideration of the main elements, the relevant substances for processes and environment as well as important elements for the product quality, the method allows a modelling of the predominant non linear process coherencies. KOSIMEUS has found its first prototypical application in a reference company, the Salzgitter AG Stahl und Technologie. In the application innovative concepts for the recycling of production residues were developed, simulated and extensively evaluated. It was shown, that the implementation of process integrated pollution control measures does not cause necessarily a rise in the specific production costs. With suitable technical measures the iron content of the residues can be regained in a recycling product like sponge iron and can be recycled within the process chain and thus reduce the consumption of other iron bearing input materials. Processing technologies like INMETCO or COMET can also enrich zinc in a secondary dust, which could possibly be sold to the zinc industry. Studies, which were carried out in co-operation with other (reference-) companies, show further promising fields of application of the developed method. For this reason additional areas of the process industry should be opened up for KOSIMEUS. Simultaneously it should be aimed at a expansion of the system for further planing problems, for example operative planing, the evaluation of recycling concepts including a company network or in the field of environmental controlling.

40|$|The {{kinetics}} of oxidation-reduction of <b>Hot</b> <b>Briquetted</b> Iron (HEI) {{has been}} investigated in both N 2 and CO 2 atmospheres over the temperature range 400 to 900 degrees Celsius. The reaction rate was measured using thermogravimetric techniques and differential thermal analysis. Reactions between wustite (FeO) and carbon, which is predominantly present as cementite (Fe 3 C) in HBI, were detectable in nitrogen above 500 degrees Celsius. A parabolic rate law, suggested to be governed by gas diffusion, was followed {{in the initial stages}} of reaction above 700 degrees Celsius. The highest rate of decarburisation was found at 800 degrees Celsius. In a CO 2 atmosphere, the degree of the HBI oxidation increased with the temperature, though simultaneous decarburisation was detectable from 700 degrees Celsius onwards. Only external oxidation was observed, with either magnetite or wustite formation, due to the relative low porosity of the HBI samples. The decarburisation predominantly occurs by reaction of pre-existing FeO with Fe 3 C/C. Linear oxidation were obtained between 400 and 500 degrees Celsius, whilst parabolic oxidation was observed initially at higher temperatures. At 800 degrees Celsius, a high decarburisation rate during the first 10 minutes resulted in increased metallisation of the HBI sample...|$|E

This study has developed a more complete understanding of the behavior of phosphorus in DRI during EAF steelmaking, through a thorough investigation of the kinetics and thermodynamics of phosphorus transfer in the EAF based upon laboratory and plant experiments and trials. Laboratory experiments have shown that phosphorus mass transfer between oxide and metallic phases within commercial {{direct reduced iron}} pellets occurs rapidly upon melting according to the local equilibrium for these phases.

40|$|In today`s steel {{industry}} {{about one third}} of the total steel production is produced by electric arc steel making. The production of steel is a very energy intensive industry, but when considering the total cost of the final steel mill product, it is the cost of raw materials that are dominating. A global trend for the manufacturing industry isto produce more energy effective products by usinglow alloyed steels which in turn affects the scrap based {{steel industry}}. Thereforean increased need of iron ore based metallic, such as direct reduced iron (DRI) and <b>hot</b> <b>briquetted</b> iron (HBI), as scrap supplement is then needed formaintaining low levels of trace elements in the produced steel. The selection ofraw materials is a matter that affects the conditions for the entire productionsystem, product properties, slag properties, off gas and dust generation, energyuse and the conditions for processes downstream. For the integrated iron and steel industry and also for other energy intensiveprocess industry, research in the field of process integration has shown goodresults regarding optimization of energy use and material utilization. Theapplication of process integration as a method for the scrap based industry, andin particular for Höganäs AB:s production system, is discussed in the thesis. Mixed Integer Linear Programing has been used to develop system models foroptimization and evaluation of costs and energy usage. Also processes notpresent in Höganäs current production system have been developed for analysisof future raw material scenarios. The current system models include six mainprocess steps: a direct reduction process, an electric arc furnace, a ladle furnace, a continuous casting process and a hot rolling mill. Among the presented results in this thesis, a major result is the models` ability to predict and constrain product quality in an improved way and show potentialcost- and energy savings for the modeled production system. Furthermore,another very useful result is the models` ability to minimize cost and energy usefor sequences of different product qualities, while taking stock levels intoconsideration. A constant concern for steelmakers is that raw material prices, composition and availability are changing and fluctuating over time. Therefore, system modeling {{can be seen as a}} good tool for helping to maintain flexibility in production units by taking advantage of these market fluctuations to keep conversion costs andenergy use at lowest levels possibleGodkänd; 2014; 20141103 (philin); Nedanstående person kommer att hålla licentiatseminarium för avläggande av teknologie licentiatexamen.
