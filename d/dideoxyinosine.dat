40|$|To {{determine}} whether <b>dideoxyinosine</b> is actively transported across the placenta, four pregnant macaques (Macaca nemestrina) near term and their fetuses were infused intravenously in random order with simulta-neous doses of <b>dideoxyinosine</b> (42. 5,ug/min/kg of body weight) and antipyrine (41. 7,ug/min/kg) for 30 h. The infusions took {{place after the}} dams had been chronically catheterized at 128 ± 0. 8 days of gestation. In a third infusion, the dams alone received a higher dosage of <b>dideoxyinosine</b> (425,ug/min/kg) and the same dosage of antipyrine (41. 7,ug/min/kg). Samples of maternal and fetal blood and amniotic fluid were collected at intervals for up to 30 h. The concentrations of <b>dideoxyinosine</b> and antipyrine were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. The transplacental maternal-fetal drug clearances were compared by the paired Student's t test. The ratio (mean ± standard deviation) of the steady-state plasma <b>dideoxyinosine</b> concentra-tion in the fetus {{to that in the}} dam was 0. 49 ± 0. 10 at the low <b>dideoxyinosine</b> infusion rate and 0. 51 ± 0. 00 at the high <b>dideoxyinosine</b> infusion rate. The clearance associated with maternal-fetal transfer of the drug, CLdf (0. 38 ± 0. 21 ml/min/kg), was not significantly different (P> 0. 05) from the clearance associated with fetal-maternal transfer of the drug, CLfd (0. 56 ± 0. 27 ml/min/kg). Also, CLdf was not significantly different (P> 0. 05) from CLfd when normalized with respect to the corresponding transplacental clearance of antipyrine (0. 07 ± 0. 04 CLdf versus 0. 09 ± 0. 04 CLfd).

When a dose of 4 mg/ml was used, no infected THP- 1 cells or parasites were found after 60 h of incubation. An electron-microscopic study confirmed that after 12 h at 1 mg/ml, the few parasites observed were severely altered.

Similarly, when embryonic or fetal mouse or human cells (from brain, limb buds, or different organ rudiments) were exposed to AZT or DDI in vitro, cytotoxicity was observed only in the mM range, with AZT showing slightly higher cytotoxicity and brain cells appearing slightly more sensitive to both nucleosides. However, even in cultures treated with very high concentrations of AZT or DDI, the {{reduction in the number of}} terminally differentiated skeletal myotubes, cardiocytes, neurons, and chondrocytes was similar to the reduction in the total number of cells, indicating that AZT and DDI did not selectively inhibit differentiation of any of the above-mentioned cell types.

Dideoxyguanosine (ddG) caused reproducible, progressive telomere shortening over several weeks of passaging, after which the telomeres stabilized and remained short. However, the prolonged passaging in ddG caused no observable effects on cell population doubling rates or morphology. Azidothymidine (AZT) caused progressive telomere shortening in some but not all T- and B-cell cultures. Telomerase activity was present in both cell lines and was inhibited in vitro by ddGTP and AZT triphosphate. Prolonged passaging in arabinofuranyl-guanosine, <b>dideoxyinosine</b> (ddI), dideoxyadenosine (ddA), didehydrothymidine (d 4 T), or phosphonoformic acid (foscarnet) did not cause reproducible telomere shortening or decreased cell growth rates or viabilities. Combining AZT, foscarnet, and/or arabinofuranyl-guanosine with ddG did not significantly augment the effects of ddG alone. Strikingly, with or without inhibitors, telomere lengths were often highly unstable in both cell lines and varied between parallel cell cultures.

The mean drug concentration which yielded 50 % p 24 Gag negative cultures were substantially different: 0. 06, 0. 2, and 6 microM for AZT, ddC, and ddI, respectively. We found that AZT was preferentially phosphorylated to its triphosphate (TP) form in PHA-PBM rather than unstimulated, resting PBM (R-PBM), producing 10 - to 17 -fold higher ratios of AZTTP/dTTP in PHA-PBM than in R-PBM. The phosphorylation of ddC and ddI to their TP forms was, however, much less efficient in PHA-PBM, resulting in approximately 5 -fold and approximately 15 -fold lower ratios of ddCTP/dCTP and ddATP/dATP, respectively, in PHA-PBM than in R-PBM.

All of these nucleoside triphosphate analogs, however, produced analog-specific alterations of the normal banding patterns seen upon gel electrophoresis of the synthesis products of telomerase, suggesting that their chain terminating and/or competitive actions differ at different positions along the RNA template. The analogs AZT, 3 '-deoxy- 2 ', 3 '-didehydrothymidine (d 4 T) and Ara-G in nucleoside form caused consistent and rapid telomere shortening in vegetatively growing Tetrahymena. In contrast, ddG or ddI {{had no effect on}} telomere length or cell growth rates. AZT caused growth rates and viability to decrease in a fraction of cells, while Ara-G had no such effects even after several weeks in culture. Neither AZT, Ara-G, acycloguanosine (Acyclo-G), ddG nor ddI had any detectable effect on cell mating, as assayed by quantitation of the efficiency of formation of progeny from mated cells. However, AZT decreased the efficiency of programmed de novo telomere addition during macronuclear development in mating cells...|$|E
40|$|Mutations in {{and around}} the {{catalytic}} site of the reverse transcriptase (RT) of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) are associated with resistance to nucleoside RT inhibitors (NRTIs), whereas changes in the hydrophobic pocket of the RT are attributed to nonnucleoside RT inhibitor (NNRTI) resistance. In this study, we report a novel series of nonnucleoside inhibitors of HIV- 1, exemplified by VRX- 329747 and VRX- 413638, which inhibit both NNRTI- and NRTI-resistant HIV- 1 isolates. Enzymatic studies indicated that these compounds are HIV- 1 RT inhibitors. Surprisingly, however, following prolonged (6 months) tissue culture selection, this series of nonnucleoside inhibitors did not select NNRTI-resistant mutations in HIV- 1 RT. Rather, four mutations (M 41 L, A 62 T/V, V 118 I, and M 184 V) known to cause resistance to NRTIs and two additional novel mutations (S 68 N and G 112 S) adjacent to the catalytic site of the enzyme were selected. Although the M 184 V mutation appears to be the initial mutation to establish resistance, this mutation alone confers only a two- to fourfold decrease in susceptibility to VRX- 329747 and VRX- 413638. At least two additional mutations must accumulate for significant resistance. Moreover, while VRX- 329747 -selected viruses are resistant to lamivudine and emtricitabine due to the M 184 V mutation, they remain susceptible to zidovudine, stavudine, <b>dideoxyinosine,</b> abacavir, tenofovir, and efavirenz. These results directly demonstrate that VRX- 329747 and VRX- 413638 are novel nonnucleoside inhibitors of HIV- 1 RT with the potential to augment current therapies...|$|E
40|$|Derivatives of pyridinones {{were found}} to inhibit human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) reverse transcriptase (RT) activity and {{prevent the spread of}} HIV- 1 infection in cell culture without an appreciable effect on other retroviral or cellular polymerases. 3 -[((4, 7 -Dimethyl- 1, 3 -benzoxazol- 2 -yl) methyl]amino]- 5 -ethyl- 6 -methylpyridin- 2 (1 H) -one (L- 697, 639) and 3 -[[(4, 7 -dichloro- 1, 3 -benzoxazol- 2 -yl) methyl]amino]- 5 -ethyl- 6 -methylpyridin- 2 (1 H) -one (L- 697, 661), two compounds within this series, had HIV- 1 RT IC 50 values in the range of 20 - 800 nM, depending upon the template-primer used. The most potent inhibition was obtained with rC. dG and dA. dT as template [...] primers. With rC. dG, reversible slow-binding non-competitive inhibition was observed. [3 H]L- 697, 639 bound preferentially to enzyme-template-primer complexes. This binding was magnesium-dependent and saturable with a stoichiometry of 1 mol of [3 H]L- 697, 639 per mol of RT heterodimer. Displacement of [3 H]L- 697, 639 was seen with phosphonoformate. In human T-lymphoid-cell culture, L- 697, 639 and L- 697, 661 inhibited the spread of HIV- 1 infection by at least 95 % at concentrations of 12 - 200 nM. Synergism between 3 '-azido- 3 '-deoxythymidine or <b>dideoxyinosine</b> and either of these compounds was also demonstrated in cell culture. Based upon their specificity for HIV- 1 RT activity, template-primer dependence on potency and ability to displace [3 H]L- 697, 639; a tetrahydroimidazo [4, 5, 1 -jk] [1, 4]-benzodiazepin- 2 (1 H) -thione derivative R 82150 and the dipyridodiazepinone BI-RG- 587 appear to inhibit RT activity by the same mechanism as the pyridinones...|$|E
40|$|The {{efficacy}} of antifolate, antiviral, {{and other drugs}} was compared in an experimental model of pneumocystosis. Sulfamethoxazole (SMX) administered alone in doses of {{greater than or equal}} to 60 mg/kg/day was highly effective in treatment and prophylaxis. Low (less than or equal to 15 mg/kg/day) doses of SMX showed limited, dose-related anti-Pneumocystis carinii activity in therapy but were more effective in prophylaxis. The dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) inhibitors trimethoprim (TMP), pyrimethamine, and trimetrexate exhibited little anti-P. carinii activity when administered alone and did not enhance the {{efficacy of}} SMX; the effects of the DHFR inhibitors could not be related to the dose or the concentration in serum. These data suggested that the rat model is an excellent system for studying the anti-P. carinii activity of sulfonamides but is of limited value in studying DHFR inhibitors. The antiviral drugs azidothymidine, <b>dideoxyinosine,</b> inosine pranobex (Isoprinosine), amantadine, and acyclovir displayed little or no activity against P. carinii; however, azidothymidine did not impair the efficacy of SMX or TMP-SMX. These results supported the clinical practice of giving antiviral agents together with antifolate drugs to patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus and suggested that the beneficial effects of antiviral agents on the occurrence of pneumocystosis are due mainly to their effects on the virus or the host immune response. In contrast to the antiviral drugs, 9 -deazainosine, a nucleoside analog with antiprotozoal properties, demonstrated marked activity against P. carinii which was related to dose and route of administration. These data raised the possibility that anti-P. carinii activity is a general property of purine nucleosides and suggested that further exploration of this class of compounds might lead to clinically useful agents...|$|E
40|$|The K 65 R {{mutation}} in {{human immunodeficiency virus}} type 1 (HIV- 1) reverse transcriptase (RT) is selected in vitro by many d-nucleoside analog RT inhibitors (NRTI) but has been rarely detected in treated patients. In recent clinical trials, the K 65 R mutation has emerged frequently in patients experiencing virologic failure on antiretroviral combinations that do not include 3 ′-azidothymidine (AZT). The reason for this change is uncertain. To gain insight, we examined trends {{in the frequency of}} K 65 R in a large genotype database, the association of K 65 R with thymidine analog mutations (TAMs) and other NRTI mutations, and the viral susceptibility profile of HIV- 1 with K 65 R alone and in combination with TAMs. Among > 60, 000 clinical samples submitted for genotype analysis that contained one or more NRTI resistance mutations, the frequency of K 65 R increased from 0. 4 % in 1998 to 3. 6 % in 2003. Among samples with K 65 R, a strong negative association was evident with the TAMs M 41 L, D 67 N, L 210 W, T 215 Y/F, and K 219 Q/E (P 50 -fold to < 2. 5 -fold in both backgrounds. In addition, TAMs antagonized the phenotypic effect of K 65 R, reducing resistance to tenofovir, abacavir, 2 ′, 3 ′-dideoxycytidine, <b>dideoxyinosine,</b> and stavudine. In conclusion, K 65 R and TAMs exhibit bidirectional phenotypic antagonism. This antagonism likely explains the negative association of these mutations in genotype databases, the rare emergence of K 65 R with antiretroviral therapies that contain AZT, and its more frequent emergence with combinations that exclude AZT...|$|E
40|$|Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) reverse transcription can be notably affected by cellular activation, differentiation, and division. We hypothesized {{that changes in}} the cell cycle could also affect HIV susceptibility to nucleoside analogues, which compete with natural nucleotides for incorporation into viral DNA and inhibit viral replication through premature termination of reverse transcription. Proliferating HeLa-derived indicator cells were arrested in the S/G 2 phase with etoposide, a topoisomerase II inhibitor, or in the G 1 /S phase with aphidicolin, a polymerase α inhibitor. Cell cycle arrest by both agents induced a remarkable decrease in HIV susceptibility to zidovudine (AZT). This decrease was seen both with a single-cycle infectivity assay and with a viral DNA quantitation assay, indicating {{that the effect of}} cell cycle arrest was exerted at the reverse transcription stage. The increase in the 50 % inhibitory concentration (IC 50) seen with arrested cells was strongest for AZT (23 -fold) and stavudine (21 -fold) but more modest for other drugs (lamivudine, 11 -fold; <b>dideoxyinosine,</b> 7 -fold; and nevirapine, 3 -fold). In drug-resistant reverse transcriptase mutants, the increase in AZT IC 50 (relative to that in dividing cells) was most prominent with a Q 151 M mutant and was comparable to the wild type in other drug-resistant mutants. Quantitation of intracellular pools of dTTP and AZT 5 ′-triphosphate (AZTTP) showed that etoposide treatment induced a significant increase in intracellular dTTP and consequently a decrease in AZTTP/dTTP ratios, suggesting that the decrease in viral susceptibility to AZT was caused by reduced incorporation of the analogue into nascent viral DNA. These results emphasize the importance of cellular proliferation and deoxynucleoside triphosphate metabolism in HIV susceptibility to nucleoside analogues and underscore the need to study the activities of drugs of this class with natural target cells under physiological conditions of activation and proliferation...|$|E
40|$|Foscarnet (phosphonoformate) is {{a potent}} virustatic drug against herpes-like viruses and is widely used in the therapy of {{cytomegalovirus}} infections in immunosuppressed patients. To obtain data on its penetration across the blood-brain barrier, we determined concentrations of foscarnet in cerebrospinal fluid and in plasma specimens from 26 patients with human immunodeficiency virus (stages 2 to 6 by Walter Reed Army Institute of Research classification) after a single infusion of 90 mg of foscarnet per kg of body weight and at steady state by electrochemical detection by high-pressure liquid chromatography. Penetration coefficients were correlated with {{the integrity of the}} blood-brain barrier. After a single infusion of foscarnet, levels in plasma ranged from 297 to 1, 775 micrograms/ml (990 to 5, 920 mumol/liter), with a mean of 766 +/- 400 micrograms/ml. Corresponding levels in cerebrospinal fluid were 57 to 225 micrograms/ml (190 to 750 mumol/liter), with a mean of 131 +/- 52 micrograms/ml. The penetration coefficient was 0. 05 to 0. 72 (mean, 0. 23 +/- 0. 16). At steady state, mean foscarnet levels in plasma were 464 +/- 219 micrograms/ml (1, 553 mumol/liter) and mean levels in cerebrospinal fluid were 308 +/- 155 micrograms/ml (1, 023 mumol/liter). The penetration coefficient was 0. 66 +/- 0. 11. Although penetration coefficients were highly variable after a single administration and at steady state, the concentrations of foscarnet attained in cerebrospinal fluid are sufficient for complete inhibition of cytomegalovirus replication in vitro. In conclusion, we show that foscarnet seems to be the drug of choice for the treatment of cytomegalovirus encephalitis, because it penetrates the blood-brain barrier and is found in the cerebrospinal fluid in virustatic concentrations. Foscarnet might be considered for additive therapy for human immunodeficiency virus encephalitis in combination with zidovudine or <b>dideoxyinosine...</b>|$|E
40|$|We have {{identified}} and characterized a potent new nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitor (NNRTI) of {{human immunodeficiency virus}} type 1 (HIV- 1) that also is active against HIV- 2 and which interferes with virus replication by two distinct mechanisms. 1 -(3 -Cyclopenten- 1 -yl) methyl- 6 -(3, 5 -dimethylbenzoyl) - 5 -ethyl- 2, 4 -pyrimidinedione (SJ- 3366) inhibits HIV- 1 replication at concentrations of approximately 1 nM, with a therapeutic index of greater than 4 × 106. The efficacy and toxicity of SJ- 3366 are consistent when evaluated with established or fresh human cells, and the compound is equipotent against all strains of HIV- 1 evaluated, including syncytium-inducing, non-syncytium-inducing, monocyte/macrophage-tropic, and subtype virus strains. Distinct from {{other members of the}} pharmacologic class of NNRTIs, SJ- 3366 inhibited laboratory and clinical strains of HIV- 2 at a concentration of approximately 150 nM, yielding a therapeutic index of approximately 20, 000. Like most NNRTIs, the compound was less active when challenged with HIV- 1 strains possessing the Y 181 C, K 103 N, and Y 188 C amino acid changes in the RT and selected for a virus with a Y 181 C amino acid change in the RT after five tissue culture passages {{in the presence of the}} compound. In combination anti-HIV assays with nucleoside and nonnucleoside RT and protease inhibitors, additive interactions occurred with all compounds tested with the exception of <b>dideoxyinosine,</b> with which a synergistic interaction was found. Biochemically, SJ- 3366 exhibited a Ki value of 3. 2 nM, with a mixed mechanism of inhibition against HIV- 1 RT, but it did not inhibit HIV- 2 RT. SJ- 3366 also inhibited the entry of both HIV- 1 and HIV- 2 into target cells. On the basis of its therapeutic index and multiple mechanisms of anti-HIV action, SJ- 3366 represents an exciting new compound for use in HIV-infected individuals...|$|E
40|$|The structure-activity {{relationships}} {{of a series}} of compounds related to the nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitor (NNRTI) oxathiin carboxanilide have been described (R. W. Buckheit, Jr., T. L. Kinjerski, V. Fliakas-Boltz, J. D. Russell, T. L. Stup, L. A. Pallansch, W. G. Brouwer, D. C. Dao, W. A. Harrison, R. J. Schultz, J. P. Bader, and S. S. Yang, Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 39 : 2718 - 2727, 1996). From these studies, the furanyl-containing analog UC 10 was identified as the most potent inhibitor of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) replication and a promising candidate for further development. Three new UC analogs (UC 040, UC 82, and UC 781) have been determined to inhibit laboratory-derived and low-passage-number, primary virus isolates at low nanomolar concentrations in both established and fresh human cells. Each of the compounds synergistically interacted with the nucleoside analogs zidovudine, <b>dideoxyinosine,</b> dideoxycytosine, and lamivudine to inhibit HIV- 1 replication. As a group, the UC compounds were found to be less active against viruses with the L 100 I, K 103 N, and Y 181 C amino acid changes in the RT and, upon in vitro selection, yielded resistant virus with the Y 181 C mutation in the RT. The most potent of the three new compounds, UC 781, contains a furanyl side chain, similar to UC 10, but differs in having an extended ether side chain instead of an oxime chain. The broad therapeutic index of UC 781 (> 62, 000) resulted in effective inhibition of NNRTI-resistant virus isolates at high nanomolar concentrations. Furthermore, UC 781 and the NNRTI costatolide were able to synergistically inhibit HIV- 1 replication when used in combination, suggesting that UC 781 may interact with the RT differently than the other UC analogs. The favorable anti-HIV properties of the UC compounds suggest they should be considered for further clinical development...|$|E
