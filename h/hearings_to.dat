5|$|The {{committees}} of the Australian Senate are {{committees of}} Senators, {{established by the}} Australian Senate, for purposes determined by that body.

5|$|The victims' families, the media, {{and members}} of the U.S. Congress were sharply {{critical}} of the U.S. Navy's findings. The U.S. Senate and U.S. House Armed Services Committees both held <b>hearings</b> <b>to</b> inquire into the Navy's investigation and later released reports disputing the U.S. Navy's conclusions. The Senate committee asked the GAO to review the U.S. Navy's investigation. To assist the GAO, Sandia National Laboratories provided a team of scientists to review the Navy's technical investigation.|$|E

5|$|For much of 2009 and 2010, China {{was under}} {{pressure}} from the US to allow the yuan to appreciate. Between June and October 2010, China allowed a 2% appreciation, but there were concerns from Western observers that China only relaxed its intervention when under heavy pressure. The fixed peg was not abandoned until just before the June G20 meeting, after which the yuan appreciated by about 1%, only to devalue slowly again, until further US pressure in September when it again appreciated relatively steeply, just prior to the September US Congressional <b>hearings</b> <b>to</b> discuss measures to force a revaluation.|$|E
5|$|Brentwood Academy {{sued the}} {{association}} over this action. Brentwood {{argued that the}} enforcement of the rule constituted state action which they claimed violated the First Amendment and the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause. The school asserted that their due process rights had been violated because there were no evidentiary <b>hearings</b> <b>to</b> determine the validity of the claim that they inappropriately recruited football players. Further, they argued that the rule violated their freedom of speech because it restricted the ways the Academy could recruit. In July 1998, the District Court agreed with this argument and granted summary judgement to the Academy, while enjoining the association from enforcing the rule. A year later, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the lower court's decision, finding that the actions of the association did not constitute 'state action'. The United States Supreme Court granted certiorari of the case to review this question.|$|E
5|$|Committees are {{designed}} to assist the Senate as a whole. Thus the main formal structure of their work is that the Senate refers something to a committee for examination, and the committee reports back to the Senate on that matter. These reports are tabled during parliamentary sittings, but can also be presented when the Senate is not in session. Committees can gather evidence and will often hold public <b>hearings</b> <b>to</b> assist this process. To gather their evidence committees can (with exceptions) travel {{from place to place}} to hear evidence. Committees are able to order the production of documents and the appearance of witnesses (powers that are in practice used very sparingly). Most evidence taken by committees (both written submissions and transcripts of public hearings) is published, however committees have the power to take evidence confidentially (in camera), and regularly do so. Committees hold both public hearings and conduct business at private meetings. The minutes of private meetings are confidential (in contrast, for example, to those of New South Wales parliamentary committees).|$|E

5|$|In 1971, {{political}} friction increased {{between the}} Army and the Air Force over the {{close air support}} (CAS) mission. The Air Force asserted that the Cheyenne would infringe on the Air Force's CAS mission {{in support of the}} Army, which had been mandated with the Key West Agreement of 1948. The Department of Defense (DOD) conducted a study that concluded that the Air Force's A-X program, the Marine Corps' Harrier, and the Cheyenne were significantly different that they did not constitute a duplication of capabilities. On 22 October 1971, the Senate Armed Services subcommittee on Tactical Air Power conducted <b>hearings</b> <b>to</b> evaluate the CAS mission and the pending programs. The most damaging testimony for the Army's program came from the commander of the Air Force's Tactical Air Command, General William W. Momyer, who cited helicopter casualty statistics of Operation Lam Son 719.|$|E
5|$|Private {{associations}} and country clubs have no obvious public law function, yet the courts exercise judicial review over their decisions and proceedings, such as hearings relating to disciplinary matters and those held {{to decide if}} persons should be deprived of their memberships in the associations, {{to ensure that they}} are fair and comply with the requirements of natural justice. It has been suggested that the courts' jurisdiction in such matters depends on contract. The rules of an association form a contract between the members of the association themselves, and the need for <b>hearings</b> <b>to</b> be conducted in accordance with natural justice is an implied term in the contract. Accordingly, the courts are merely enforcing the contract rather than exercising a judicial review function.|$|E
5|$|Speculation {{that this}} would be the {{decision}} had already taken place, and both Glenn and McCain were frustrated that the long delay in resolving their cases was damaging their reputations. However, there were political implications, as the removal of the two would eliminate the only Republican from the case. The committee's work was further made difficult by there being no specific rule that governed the propriety of members intervening with federal regulators. By mid-October, several Republican senators, including former Ethics Committee chair Ted Stevens, were taking the unusual step of publicly complaining about the Ethics Committee's inaction, saying that it was unfair to Glenn and McCain, that the whole lengthy process was unfair to all five, and that political motives might be behind the delays. Eventually, the committee could not agree on the Bennett recommendation regarding Glenn and McCain: vice chair Rudman agreed with Bennett, chair Heflin did not. On October 23, 1990, the committee decided to keep all five senators in the case, and scheduled public <b>hearings</b> <b>to</b> question them and other witnesses.|$|E

5|$|The bill then {{proceeds}} {{to the committee}} stage, where {{the details of the}} drafting of the proposed law are examined. Where a bill is relatively uncontroversial, it is referred to a committee of the whole Parliament; in other words, all the MPs attending the sitting form a committee and discuss the bill clause by clause. Bills that are more controversial, or that require the views of interested groups or the public, are often referred to a select committee. This is a committee of selected MPs who invite interested people to make representations to the committee. Public <b>hearings</b> <b>to</b> hear submissions on the bill may be held. The select committee then reports its findings, together with any suggested amendments to the bill, to Parliament.|$|E
5|$|Planning for {{the freeway}} began in 1954, with the {{proposal}} for a freeway from Elliott Bay to the Central Freeway, later I-5, via Broad and Mercer streets added to the city's comprehensive plan in 1957. Funded by a bond measure passed by Seattle voters in 1960, plans were drawn for the newly renamed Bay Freeway to serve a multi-purpose stadium at the Seattle Center via an elevated structure. Citizen groups voiced {{their opposition to the}} project at public hearings in 1967, forcing the Seattle Engineering Department to consider other designs. After determining that a cut-and-cover tunnel would not be feasible, a second series of public <b>hearings</b> <b>to</b> discuss the impact of an elevated option were held in 1970, leading to widespread controversy and a civil suit launched in opposition to the freeway. The lawsuit ended in November 1971, with a King County Superior Court judge ruling that a major deviation from the voter-approved 1960 plan occurred, forcing a referendum to be held on whether to continue the project. On February 8, 1972, the Bay Freeway project was rejected by a 10,000-vote margin in a municipal referendum, alongside the repeal of the R.H. Thomson Expressway. Mercer Street would later undergo several projects that attempted to provide congestion relief promised by the rejected freeway, culminating in the Mercer Corridor Project in 2012, which widened the street into a boulevard.|$|E
