5|$|Phreatomagmatic eruptions are eruptions {{that arise}} from {{interactions}} between water and magma.

The products of phreatomagmatic eruptions are believed to be more regular in shape and finer grained than the products of magmatic eruptions because of the differences in eruptive mechanisms.|$|E
