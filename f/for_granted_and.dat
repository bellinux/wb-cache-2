5|$|I {{realized}} {{that for a}} long time I had been holding onto this whole dogma of nonracism almost like a religion... But in the course of that debate I began to feel there was a lot lacking in the proponents of the nonracist idea... they had this problem, you know, of superiority, and they tended to take us <b>for</b> <b>granted</b> <b>and</b> wanted us to accept things that were second-class. They could not see why we could not consider staying in that church, and I began to feel that our understanding of our own situation in this country was not coincidental with that of these liberal whites.|$|E

25|$|At the First Council of Nicaea (325) this {{position}} of the metropolitan was taken <b>for</b> <b>granted,</b> <b>and</b> was made the basis for conceding to him definite rights over the other bishops and dioceses of the state province. In Eastern canon law since the fourth century (cf. also the Synod of Antioch of 341, can. ix), it was a principle that every civil province was likewise a church province under the supreme direction of the metropolitan, i.e. of the bishop of the provincial capital.|$|E
25|$|A dysplastic animal has {{probably}} {{lived with the}} condition since {{it was only a}} few months old, and has therefore grown up taking the chronic pain <b>for</b> <b>granted</b> <b>and</b> has learned to live with it. Dogs suffering such pain do not usually exhibit acute signs of pain. Sometimes, they will suddenly and abnormally sit down when walking, or refuse to walk or climb objects which they usually would, but this can equally be a symptom of many other things, including a thorn in the paw, or a temporary muscle pain. So pain recognition is less common a means of detection than the visible gait and other abnormalities described above.|$|E

25|$|Gerald Weiss {{noted that}} {{although}} Tylor's classic definition of culture {{was restricted to}} humans, many anthropologists take this <b>for</b> <b>granted</b> <b>and</b> thus elide that important qualification from later definitions, merely equating culture with any learned behavior. This slippage is a problem because during the formative years of modern primatology, some primatologists were trained in anthropology (and understood that culture refers to learned behavior among humans), and others were not. Notable non-anthropologists, like Robert Yerkes and Jane Goodall thus argued that since chimpanzees have learned behaviors, they have culture. Today, anthropological primatologists are divided, several arguing that non-human primates have culture, others arguing that they do not.|$|E
25|$|The {{dependency}} representations above (and further below) show syntactic dependencies. Indeed, most work in {{dependency grammar}} focuses on syntactic dependencies. Syntactic dependencies are, however, {{just one of}} three or four types of dependencies. Meaningâ€“text theory, for instance, emphasizes the role of semantic and morphological dependencies in addition to syntactic dependencies. A fourth type, prosodic dependencies, can also be acknowledged. Distinguishing between these types of dependencies can be important, in part because if one fails to do so, the likelihood that semantic, morphological, and/or prosodic dependencies will be mistaken for syntactic dependencies is great. The following four subsections briefly sketch each of these dependency types. During the discussion, the existence of syntactic dependencies is taken <b>for</b> <b>granted</b> <b>and</b> used as an orientation point for establishing the nature of the other three dependency types.|$|E
25|$|Once {{they left}} home these armies and fleets {{had to be}} supplied, not only with food and {{clothing}} for the men but also forage for the horses which gave them mobility and were fitting to their Station. Yet if armies of the seventh and eighth centuries were accompanied by servants and a supply train of lesser free men, Alfred found these arrangements insufficient to defeat the Vikings. One of his reforms, if {{he was responsible for}} them, was to divide his military resources into three. One part manned the burhs and found the permanent garrisons which would make it impossible for the Danes to overrun Wessex, although they would also take to the field when extra soldiers were needed. The remaining two would take it in turns to serve. They were allocated a fixed term of Service and brought the necessary provisions with them. This arrangement did not always function perfectly. On one occasion a division on Service went home in the middle of blockading a Danish army on Thorney Island, its provisions consumed and its term expired, before the king came to relieve them. This method of division and rotation remained in force right up to 1066. In 917, when armies from Wessex and Mercia were in the field from early April until November, one division went home and another took over. Again, in 1052 when Edward's fleet was waiting at Sandwich to intercept Godwine's return, the ships returned to London to take on new earls and crews. The importance of supply, vital to military success, was appreciated even if it was taken <b>for</b> <b>granted</b> <b>and</b> features only incidentally in the sources.|$|E

500|$|The late philosopher of {{mind and}} {{language}} Donald Davidson, despite his many differences of opinion with Putnam, wrote that semantic externalism constituted an [...] "anti-subjectivist revolution" [...] in philosophers' way of seeing the world. Since the time of Descartes, philosophers had been concerned with proving knowledge from the basis of subjective experience. Thanks to Saul Kripke, Putnam, Tyler Burge and others, Davidson said, philosophy could now take the objective realm <b>for</b> <b>granted</b> <b>and</b> start questioning the alleged [...] "truths" [...] of subjective experience.|$|E

The song speaks {{about the death of}} a loved one, how the protagonist took their presence <b>for</b> <b>granted</b> <b>and</b> misses them, and finally about seeing the person in heaven. Both Carey and Boyz II Men wrote the song about specific people in their lives, being inspired by sufferers of the AIDS epidemic, which was globally prevalent at that time.|$|E
500|$|Research psychologists Kassin and Wrightsman {{indicate}} that the model employed (demographic factors predict attitudes that predict verdicts) has empirical weaknesses. That attitudes predict verdicts is taken <b>for</b> <b>granted</b> <b>and</b> rarely studied. For example, veterans might favor current troops, {{but that does not}} necessarily translate into a likelihood to acquit their brethren of crimes. However, the relationship between demographics and verdicts can be more reliably predicted by mock trials. Successful prediction of jury verdicts often requires data specific to the case and jurisdiction. The sheer number of ways that one case can be unique outstrips the published research on the subject, so original research is often required. That necessity is exacerbated by the fact that many modern consultants are reluctant to share knowledge, even with other firms, because of paranoia, client confidentiality, and their regard for their work as [...] "trade secrets".|$|E

500|$|Sutton was {{diagnosed}} with stage 3B colorectal cancer {{at the age of}} 15, and subsequently went through aggressive radiation and chemotherapy treatments. He was declared cancer-free, but a tumour returned behind his knee, which was treated by further chemotherapy. Doctors considered an amputation of Sutton's left leg, but the tumour had already spread to other parts of his lower body. In December 2012, two years after the initial diagnosis, the cancer was deemed incurable after spreading to the lungs and liver. Sutton did not ask how long he was expected to survive, choosing to measure his life in the difference he could make, rather than in time. On 24 January 2014, in a speech at London's O2 Arena, he called his first diagnosis [...] "a good thing. It was a huge kick up the backside, it taught me to take nothing <b>for</b> <b>granted,</b> <b>and</b> gave me a lot of motivation for life".|$|E
500|$|The {{lyrics of}} [...] "If I Were a Boy" [...] {{are about a}} gender-swapping thought experiment, through which BeyoncÃ© {{analyses}} the ideologies of a tense relationship. As she sings about things she would do {{if she were a}} boy, BeyoncÃ© highlights the vulnerability of a woman and ponders how things would be different if men had women's sense of empathy. During {{the first part of the}} ballad, BeyoncÃ© alternates between the role of her flawed partner and that of the better man she would be. In the first verse, she envisions herself impersonating her unfeeling love interest as she sings about consuming beer with other men, chasing after girls, and treating her lover cruelly, before adding that she would never be confronted for it. BeyoncÃ© then sings the chorus, in which she gives her vision of life as a better man, [...] "I think I could understand / How it feels to love a girl / I swear I'd be a better man", because she knows [...] "how it hurts when you lose the one you wanted / 'cause he's taken you <b>for</b> <b>granted</b> <b>and</b> everything you had got destroyed".|$|E
500|$|In the film, Carey's {{character}} Billie Frank argues {{with her}} boyfriend and producer Dice (Max Beesley) and they break-up. Her emotional pain leads her to solo songwriting. Dice also misses Billie, and also begins writing a song. Billie goes to Dice's apartment {{in an attempt to}} reconcile. He was not home, but the music he has written is and Billie realizes they wrote the same song: [...] "Never Too Far". She kisses the sheet music, leaving a lipstick imprint, which Dice later discovers. Dice plans a reconciliation, but is killed by Billie's former producer Timothy Walker (Terrence Howard) after Dice did not pay the US$100,000 from their agreement to release Billie from Walker's contract. At Billie's first show at Madison Square Garden, her management and support crew see a report of the murder on television. They wonder if Billie was with him, they see that she is there and has seen the report. Billie onstage commands the band to stop playing [...] "Loverboy", tells the crowd never to take someone <b>for</b> <b>granted,</b> <b>and</b> that if you love them, you should tell them, because you might never have the chance to tell them how you really feel. She then starts to sing [...] "Never Too Far".|$|E

500|$|Following Terry-Thomas's death, Lionel Jeffries {{called him}} [...] "the {{last of the}} great gentlemen of the cinema", while the {{director}} Michael Winner commented that [...] "no matter what your position was in relation to his, as the star he was always terribly nice. He was the kindest man and he enjoyed life so much". Reviewing his career in The Guardian, Adrian Turner considered that [...] "we took him <b>for</b> <b>granted</b> <b>and</b> he was ideal for his time. Not to put too serious a point on it, his portrayal of crass stupidity and blatant deviousness struck a chord with British audiences during the fifties as they experienced the clumsy dismemberment of the Empire and the 'never had it so good' ethos of the Macmillan era. During the sixties he became a glorious anachronism, much in demand in America, who saw in him the irrelevant pageantry of Britain"; {{he also said that}} Terry-Thomas was [...] "a national treasure". Gilbert Adair, writing in The Independent, considered that [...] "for three decades, and in literally scores of films, he personified the Englishman as amiable bounder"; Adair wrote that [...] "the characterisation he was to assume represented the very essence of patrician, double-barrelled caddishness". Terry-Thomas's friend Jack Lemmon called him [...] "a consummate professional... he was a gentleman, a delight to be with personally, let alone professionally, and above all as an actor he had one of the qualities that I admire so muchâ€”he made it look simple".|$|E
