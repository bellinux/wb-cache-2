The right thing for the rōnin to do, wrote Yamamoto, was to attack Kira and his men immediately after Asano's death. The rōnin would probably have suffered defeat, as Kira was ready for an attack at that time—but this was unimportant.|$|R

This chapter presents a case study of World Vision Australia 2 ̆ 7 s (WVA) fundraising and programming responses to the Asian Tsunami. The initial stages of the fundraising campaign were largely unplanned and reactive. Yet WVA received over 110 million for its tsunami appeal <b>in</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> over three months. This is incomparable with other recent large-scale disaster fundraising campaigns. The experiences of how the initial phases of the response were implemented arc gauged through a qualitative analysis of interviews conducted with twenty-one staff members who completed short-term secondments during the initial tsunami response. These interviews extract a number of reflections of WVA 2 ̆ 7 s programming and provide a number of lessons for WVA for future complex humanitarian emergencies. This chapter thus reviews the effectiveness of both roles of NGOs - raising funds and expending these funds to implement programs. </div...|$|R

[...] Worse, the mysterious circumstances surrounding the end of the second fight probably linked Liston forever to all that was corrupt and suspect in boxing.

40|$|Despite Bluetooth’s popularity, low cost, and {{low power}} requirements, Bluetooth {{applications}} remain remarkably unsophisticated. Although the research community and industry have designed games, cell-phone backup, and contextual advertising systems with Bluetooth, few such applications have been prototyped or evaluated {{on a large}} scale. Evaluating Bluetooth applications requires recruiting devices in the wild and developing robust software that can adapt to the heterogeneity of these devices. These requirements have limited both the number and {{the magnitude of the}} experiments with Bluetooth applications. This paper proposes BlueMonarch, a system for evaluating Bluetooth applications in the wild. BlueMonarch emulates a Bluetooth transfer to any device responding to Bluetooth Service Discovery requests; because many cell-phones, laptops, and PDAs in the wild respond to such probes, BlueMonarch enables quick prototyping of Bluetooth applications in the wild, to hundreds of unmodified Bluetooth devices. After we present the feasibility and accuracy of BlueMonarch, we use BlueMonarch to evaluate a content delivery system for Bluetooth. With BlueMonarch, we evaluated our system inside a mall and a subway system; we were able to send tens of megabytes of data to hundreds of Bluetooth devices <b>in</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> over <b>an</b> hour...|$|R

The course is {{designed}} to inform students about career planning and management interventions and to accommodate students {{at different levels of}} career decidedness. Lectures, electronic media, computer-based career guidance systems, outside projects, and readings constitute the instructional techniques. Purpose & Goals of this Course Career planning and management is a relatively recent social invention. For generations there was very little freedom of choice in occupational selection. Sons of farmers became farmers, sons of miners became miners, sons of factory workers became factory workers, and the daughters of all three worked only in the home. But in the last 100 years society has undergone significant change. Contemporary Americans have well over 12, 000 different occupations from which to choose. <b>In</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> over <b>a</b> century we have gone from a limited-choice situation to a point where the sheer multitude of possibilities often makes the process of choosing an occupation frustrating, time consuming, and haphazard. Sometimes, the occupation finally chosen does not fit the temperaments, interests, and values of the individual. This course is designed to help students understand how to remedy this dissonance as well as define the above terms with respect to occupational choice...|$|R
