5|$|Billy and Frank stopped {{first at}} the Grand Hotel on Allen Street, and were greeted by Doc Holliday. They learned {{immediately}} after of their brothers' beatings by the Earps within the previous two hours. The incidents had generated {{a lot of talk}} in town. Angrily, <b>Frank</b> <b>said</b> he would not drink, and he and Billy left the saloon immediately to seek Tom. By law, both Frank and Billy should have left their firearms at the Grand Hotel. Instead, they remained fully armed.|$|E
5|$|Both Newt Lee, {{after the}} {{discovery}} of Phagan's body, and the police, just after 4a.m., had unsuccessfully tried to telephone Frank early on Sunday, April 27. The police contacted him later that morning and he agreed to accompany them to the factory. When the police arrived after 7a.m. without telling the specifics of {{what happened at the}} factory, Frank seemed extremely nervous, trembling, and pale; his voice was hoarse, and he was rubbing his hands and asking questions before the police could answer. <b>Frank</b> <b>said</b> he was not familiar with the name Mary Phagan and would need to check his payroll book. The detectives took Frank to the morgue to see Phagan's body and then to the factory, where Frank viewed the crime scene and walked the police through the entire building. Frank returned home about 10:45a.m. At this point, Frank was not considered a suspect.|$|E
5|$|Leopard Trek {{came to the}} Tour de France with, per season-long expectations, a squad {{centered}} around overall victory. The leader was probably Andy Schleck, entering as runner-up {{in the past two}} Tours de France and three-times running winner of the young rider classification, an award for which he was no longer eligible. Brother <b>Fränk</b> <b>said</b> his goal was to have Andy win the Tour, with Fränk himself also there on the podium with him. The remaining squad members were Cancellara, Gerdemann, Monfort, Fuglsang, Voigt, O'Grady, and Posthuma. Every rider on the squad had ridden the Tour de France before, and all but Monfort, Fuglsang, and Posthuma had previously worn the yellow jersey. Pre-race analysis speculated Cancellara could aim for a few days in the race lead before the course shifted to the high mountains.|$|E
50|$|According to Time magazine, on November 21, 2003, <b>Franks</b> <b>said</b> that in {{the event}} of another {{terrorist}} attack, American constitutional liberties might be discarded by popular demand in favor of a military state. Discussing the hypothetical dangers posed to the US {{in the wake of the}} September 11, 2001 attacks, <b>Franks</b> <b>said</b> that “the worst thing that could happen” is if terrorists acquire and then use a biological, chemical or nuclear weapon that inflicts heavy casualties. If that happens, <b>Franks</b> <b>said,</b> “... the Western world, the free world, loses what it cherishes most, and that is freedom and liberty we’ve seen for a couple of hundred years in this grand experiment that we call democracy.” Franks then offered “in a practical sense” what he thinks would happen in the aftermath of such an attack.|$|R

6000|$|... "We've seen enough," [...] <b>Franks</b> <b>said,</b> {{raising his}} voice. [...] "All {{this is very}} serious. It must be {{reported}} below and a study made to determine our policy." ...|$|R
5|$|On Monday, April 28, Frank, {{accompanied}} by his attorney, Luther Rosser, gave a written deposition to the police that provided a brief timeline of his activities on Saturday. He said Phagan was in his office between 12:05 and 12:10p.m., that Lee had arrived at 4p.m. but was asked to return later, and that Frank had a confrontation with ex-employee James Gantt at 6p.m. as Frank was leaving and Lee arriving. Frank explained that Lee's time card for Sunday morning had several gaps (Lee was supposed to punch in every half-hour) that Frank had missed when he discussed the time card with police on Sunday. At Rosser's insistence, Frank exposed his body to demonstrate {{that he had no}} cuts or injuries and the police found no blood on the suit that <b>Frank</b> <b>said</b> he had worn on Saturday. The police found no blood stains on the laundry at Frank's house.|$|E
25|$|Rabbi Frank left Beth El in 1969 after {{accepting}} {{a position at}} Temple De Hirsch, a Reform congregation in Seattle. Rabbi <b>Frank</b> <b>said</b> {{he was proud of}} always speaking from his heart about what he believed to be true.|$|E
25|$|On April 20, neighbors saw Frank Jr., age 6, lugging a {{pick and}} shovel out into South Troy Street and start digging. Upon inquiry, <b>Frank</b> <b>said</b> {{there had been}} a lot of {{construction}} on the street the day Elsie disappeared, and he had heard his parents discussing the possibility that she had fallen into a hole. As she struggled to climb out, she might have been buried under falling sand and gravel. Workers still fixing the street said that it was possible, but they would have noticed immediately. Meanwhile, people in the West End and a woman in Kings, Illinois reported sightings of light-skinned girls traveling with gypsies.|$|E
6000|$|... "It won't be much longer," [...] <b>Franks</b> <b>said.</b> [...] "We're almost there. The surface {{tower is}} not expecting us. I gave orders that no signal {{was to be}} sent." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You're like {{everyone}} else," [...] <b>Franks</b> <b>said.</b> [...] "Old women afraid of burglars. No radiation leaks down to first stage. There's lead and rock, and what {{comes down the}} Tube is bathed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Listen," [...] <b>Franks</b> <b>said,</b> {{his voice}} low and hard. [...] "We must get back down at once. There's {{a lot to get}} started on. All this can be turned to our advantage." ...|$|R
500|$|The next day, 20 May, Hollinshead {{called the}} local {{hospitals}} {{in order to}} locate Sabina's sister Ursula. At 19:40, Hollinshead came outside {{of the house to}} ask a neighbour, Frank Booth, for tea bags. <b>Frank</b> <b>said</b> he would get the tea bags once he had finished washing his vehicle, and Hollinshead went back to his home. One minute after returning inside he staggered back outside to the neighbour and told him [...] "she stabbed me", before collapsing to the ground. Sabina had stabbed him five times with a kitchen knife and Hollinshead died from his injuries. Sabina fled the premises and the neighbour dialled 999.|$|E
500|$|Hans <b>Frank</b> <b>said</b> in 1940, [...] "Poles {{may have}} only one master—a German. Two masters cannot exist side by side, {{and this is why}} all members of the Polish intelligentsia must be killed." [...] Thomas J. Craughwell wrote that from 1939 to 1945, an {{estimated}} 3,000 members of the Polish clergy (18 percent) were murdered; of these, 1,992 died in concentration camps. According to the Encyclopædia Britannica, 1,811 Polish priests died in Nazi concentration camps. Among the persecuted resisters was Irena Sendlerowa, head of the children's section of Żegota, who placed more than 2,500 Jewish children in convents, orphanages, schools, hospitals and homes. Captured by the Gestapo in 1943, Sendlerowa was crippled by torture.|$|E
500|$|In 2006, Frank was one {{of three}} Representatives to oppose the Respect for America's Fallen Heroes Act, which {{restricted}} protests (notably those of Fred Phelps' Westboro Baptist Church) at soldiers' funerals. He opposed the bill, which passed unanimously in the Senate, on civil liberties and constitutional grounds. <b>Frank</b> <b>said</b> of the vote, [...] "I think it's very likely to be found unconstitutional. [...] It's true that when you defend civil liberties you are typically defending people who do obnoxious things... You play into their hand when you let them provoke you into overdoing it. I don't want these thugs to [...] claim [...] America is hypocritical." [...] The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People scored him at 100% in 2006 indicating a pro-affirmative-action stance.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{see what}} the leadys mean about {{diplomacy}} becoming outmoded," [...] <b>Franks</b> <b>said</b> at last. [...] "People who work together don't need diplomats. They solve their problems on the operational level instead of at a conference table." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{may be an}} accident," [...] <b>Franks</b> <b>said.</b> [...] "There's {{always the}} {{possibility}} that a given object might escape being exposed above. But {{this is the second time}} it's happened that we know of. There may be others." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "These suits {{will protect}} us," [...] <b>Franks</b> <b>said.</b> [...] "In any case, it's not your responsibility. What I want is an {{immediate}} Council meeting so I can acquaint myself with conditions, {{with the situation}} here. Can that be arranged?" ...|$|R
500|$|Yi {{made his}} return from injury after the 2009 NBA All-Star Game in a loss to the Houston Rockets on 17 February 2009. However, after {{averaging}} only six points on 36% shooting after his return, Yi {{was removed from the}} team's starting lineup. His final averages for the season were 8.6 points and 5.3 rebounds per game, as well as a 38% shooting percentage from the field and 34% on three-point field goals. After New Jersey finished the season outside of the playoffs, Yi's agent Dan Fegan suggested New Jersey played better when Yi played more minutes and took more shots, and said it [...] "begs the question...who's accountable?" [...] New Jersey's head coach Lawrence <b>Frank</b> <b>said</b> that [...] "you have to be patient. He's only 21", and Yi assessed his season by saying he was [...] "still too much up and down." ...|$|E
500|$|Frank {{was criticized}} by {{conservative}} organizations for campaign contributions totaling $42,350 between 1989 and 2008. Bill Sammon, the Washington {{managing editor for}} Fox News Channel, claimed the donations from Fannie and Freddie influenced his support of their lending programs, and said that Frank did not play a strong enough role in reforming the institutions in the {{years leading up to}} the economic crisis of 2008. In 2006, a Fannie Mae representative stated in SEC filings that they [...] "did not participate in large amounts of these non-traditional mortgages in 2004 and 2005." [...] In response to criticism, <b>Frank</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "In 2004, it was Bush who started to push Fannie and Freddie into subprime mortgages, because they were boasting about how they were expanding homeownership for low-income people. And I said at the time, 'Hey—(a) this is going to jeopardize their profitability, but (b) it's going to put people in homes they can't afford, and they're gonna lose them.'" ...|$|E
500|$|In a Wall Street Journal opinion {{piece in}} 2007, <b>Frank</b> <b>said</b> that the Department of Treasury and SEC should urge the Supreme Court to reject {{expanded}} securities litigation liability in Stoneridge v. Scientific-Atlanta. Congressmen John Conyers, Jr. and Barney Frank criticized this op-ed in their saying that Frank's argument substituted policy considerations for the plain text of statute. Frank rebutted the allegation on the Overlawyered weblog. Also in 2007, Frank posted an article regarding tort trial lawyer Arthur Alan Wolk on Overlawyered, a website he has regularly posted on since 2003 about tort reform issues, that prompted Wolk to sue Frank for defamation. [...] The case was dismissed as barred {{by the one}} year statute of limitations. On appeal, the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, the Society of Professional Journalists, the American Society of News Editors, the New York Times, the Washington Post, the Associated Press, and law professors and First Amendment experts Eugene Volokh and Glenn Reynolds, among others, filed amicus briefs {{in support of the}} defendants saying that there was no actionable claim of libel.|$|E
6000|$|... "Two periods from now," [...] <b>Franks</b> <b>said</b> softly, [...] "an initial {{investigating}} {{party will}} be ready to go surface-side. We're going up the Tube in suits, up to the top--the first human party to leave undersurface in eight years." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Trail {{scowled at}} the young {{passenger}} who had paid no money for his passage. He scarcely nodded {{his head to the}} stranger, when Captain <b>Franks</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "This here gentleman is Mr. Trail, sir, whose name you have a-heerd of." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They can't fire back," [...] <b>Franks</b> <b>said</b> calmly. [...] "This {{is another}} bluff. They've tried to bluff {{us all the}} way." [...] He fired {{into the face of}} a leady. The leady dissolved. [...] "They can only try to frighten us. Remember that." ...|$|R
500|$|Founder Ted Frank {{has said}} that [...] "the whole reason I started this is {{because there is a}} high {{probability}} of district courts rubber-stamping settlements. I think these are very bad settlements that the [...] will provide guidance for when judges should or shouldn’t approve settlements.” He has also said [...] "the class action landscape has long included some “professional settlement objectors” who target large cases in hopes of extracting a percentage of the attorney fees as a reward. But that doesn’t solve the problem. The niche isn’t being filled unless you find somebody crazy like me who is willing to spend dozens of hours of his own time and hundreds of dollars of his own money to make a claim he can’t benefit from." [...] <b>Frank</b> <b>said</b> in an objection in a case at the Court of the United States District Court Northern District of Ohio of the CCAF, [...] "while the Center focuses on bringing objections to unfair class action settlements, it makes no effort to engage in quid pro quo settlements to extort attorneys, and has never settled an objection. The Center analyses complaints from consumers aggrieved by class actions settlement notices to determine whether a settlement is objectionable under the law because it favors attorneys over class members." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rabbi <b>Frank</b> <b>said</b> {{he would}} return to speak at the church the {{following}} Sunday because [...] "I have a lot to say and I don't run that easy." [...] Rabbi <b>Frank</b> <b>said</b> the bomb threat was the work [...] "of a group of cowards who are afraid to come out into the daylight." [...] People from around the country mailed letters to Beth El in support of Rabbi Frank.|$|E
2500|$|As the {{investigation}} began, L.A. Police Lt. Horace <b>Frank</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "people {{ought to be}} outraged by every murder. We're outraged by every murder and will pursue every murder aggressively." ...|$|E

2500|$|<b>Franks</b> <b>said</b> viewers {{would see}} a {{completely}} different side of her character during the series, explaining that the series shows Esther growing up as she turns eighteen. She continued to say that Esther {{would have a hard}} time but shows that she is a [...] "tough cookie" [...] during the episodes. On filming racier scenes for the late night show, the actress said she felt [...] "petrified" [...] and was nervous but that filming the scenes in one day made them easier to do. <b>Franks</b> <b>said</b> that Jade is shown to be a [...] "weirdo" [...] as her sinister side is revealed, explaining that Jade is [...] "a bit mental". The later air time allowed the scenes to be pushed further and the episodes did not have to hide anything due to their darker nature which would lead them to become [...] "pretty gruesome".|$|R

2500|$|German Public Prosecutor General Peter <b>Frank</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "We have to {{get used}} to the idea that the man apprehended may not be the {{perpetrator}} or belong to the group of perpetrators." [...] The man was released on the evening of 20 December due to lack of evidence.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the debate}} on the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, some {{commentators}} claimed that a draft provision (omitted in the adopted bill) to give money to funds run by the U.S. Department of the Treasury could potentially lead to money flowing to groups like ACORN. When asked how much money ACORN or other community groups would get, a spokesman for Financial Services Committee chairman Barney <b>Frank,</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Absolutely none. All funds would go to state and local governments." [...] Critics also claimed that ACORN's complex organizational structure allowed it to escape public scrutiny.|$|E
2500|$|J. Frank Norris {{was born}} in Dadeville in Tallapoosa County in eastern Alabama, but the family shortly moved to Arkansas {{and then back to}} Columbiana in Shelby County in central Alabama. In the late 1880s, the Norrises {{purchased}} land near Hubbard in Hill County, Texas, about thirty miles north of Waco, where they farmed. [...] James Warner Norris was an alcoholic, and Frank Norris claimed that his father once beat him severely after he had emptied his liquor bottles. In 1891, both were shot by an acquaintance of Warner Norris, and <b>Frank</b> <b>said</b> he did not fully recuperate for three years.|$|E
