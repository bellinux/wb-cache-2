40|$|Introduction: The Langerhans cell {{histiocytosis}} is {{an inflammatory}} cells proliferative disorder of unknown etiology. It is uncommon disease in children. Objective: To proceed with a literature review on Langerhans cell histiocytosis, with {{focus on the}} otorhinolaryngological complications. Materials and methods: The methodology used was advised based on online data from MEDLINE, between 1966 and 2008, with research of terms related to Langerhans cell histiocytosis, temporal bones and otorhinolaryngology. Literature Review: The manifestations {{in the head and}} neck are the most common ones and their diagnosis becomes difficult once it mimetizing other more common diseases the otorhinolaryngologist sees as <b>external</b> <b>ear</b> <b>eczema,</b> acute mastoiditis and gingivitis. The temporal bone disease manifests as recurrent otorrhea and external auditory meatus and retroauricular granulomas. The radiological evaluation confirms lytic lesions especially in the cranial cap, jaw, temporal bones and spines. The definitive diagnosis is made by biopsy through the histopathological discoveries and immunohistochemistry detection of the CD 1 a antigen. The main form of treatment is by chemotherapy and, in a lower scale, radiotherapy or surgery. Conclusions: he otorhinolaryngological manifestations must be suspected for recurrent otological symptoms and the presence of retroauricular granulation tissue or and the external auditory meatus. The biopsy with characteristic histological discoveries and immunohistochemistry positive for CD 1 a were diagnostic. The chemotherapy may be the initial treatment in most cases or secondary in refractory or recurrent forms...|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: Aging causes {{changes in}} the <b>external</b> <b>ear</b> as a {{collapse}} of {{the external auditory canal}} and tympanic membrane senile. Knowing them is appropriate for the diagnosis of hearing loss and selection of hearing aids. For this reason, the study aimed to verify the influence of the anatomical changes of the <b>external</b> <b>ear</b> resonance in the auditory canal in the elderly. METHODS: The sample consisted of objective measures of the <b>external</b> <b>ear</b> of elderly with collapse (group A), senile tympanic membrane (group B) and without changing the external auditory canal or tympanic membrane (group C) and adults without changing the <b>external</b> <b>ear</b> (group D). In the retrospective/clinical study were performed comparisons of measures of individuals with and without alteration of the <b>external</b> <b>ear</b> through the gain and response <b>external</b> <b>ear</b> resonant frequency and the primary peak to the right ear.

40|$|Objectives. To {{investigate}} {{the best time}} of examination and section chosen of routine prenatal ultrasound screening for <b>external</b> <b>ear</b> abnormalities and evaluate the feasibility of examining the fetal <b>external</b> <b>ear</b> with ultrasonography. Methods. From July 2010 until August 2011, 42118 pregnant women with single fetus during 16 – 40 weeks of pregnancy were enrolled in the study. Fetal auricles and external auditory canal in the second trimester of pregnancy were evaluated by routine color Doppler ultrasound screening and systematic screening. Ultrasound images of fetal <b>external</b> <b>ears</b> were obtained on transverse-incline view at cervical vertebra level and mandible level and on parasagittal view and coronal view at <b>external</b> <b>ear</b> level. Results. Five fetuses had anomalous ears including bilateral malformed auricles with malformed external auditory canal, unilateral deformed <b>external</b> <b>ear,</b> and unilateral microtia. The detection rate of both auricles was negatively correlated with gestational age. Of the 5843 fetuses undergoing a routine ultrasound screening, 5797 (99. 21 %) had bilateral auricles. Of the 4955 fetuses following systematic screening, all fetuses (100 %) had bilateral auricles. The best time for fetal auricles observation with ultrasonography is 20 – 24 weeks of pregnancy.

The present study was performed to see if movement of the <b>external</b> <b>ears</b> in a human embryo could be explained by differential growth. Methods In all, 171 samples between Carnegie stage (CS) 17 and CS 23 were selected from MR image datasets of human embryos obtained from the Kyoto Collection of Human Embryos. The three-dimensional absolute position of 13 representative anatomical landmarks, including <b>external</b> and internal <b>ears,</b> from MRI data was traced to evaluate the movement between the different stages with identical magnification. Two different sets of reference axes were selected for evaluation and comparison of the movements. Results When the pituitary gland and the first cervical vertebra were selected as a reference axis, the 13 anatomical landmarks of the face spread out within the same region as the embryo enlarged and changed shape. The <b>external</b> <b>ear</b> did move mainly laterally, but not cranially. The distance between the <b>external</b> and internal <b>ear</b> stayed approximately constant.

40|$|Background: The {{habit of}} {{cleaning}} {{the external auditory}} canal with cotton buds is a common practice of the masses.

30|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to analyze the human mastoid cavity on sound {{transmission}} using finite element method. Pressure distributions in the <b>external</b> <b>ear</b> canal and middle ear cavity at different frequencies were demonstrated. Our results showed that, first, blocking the aditus improves middle ear sound transmission in the 1500 - to 2500 -Hz range and decreases displacement in frequencies below 1000 [*]Hz when compared with the normal ear. Second, at frequencies lower than 1000 [*]Hz, the acoustic pressures were almost uniformly distributed in the <b>external</b> <b>ear</b> canal and middle ear cavity. At high frequencies, higher than 1000 [*]Hz, the pressure distribution varied along the <b>external</b> <b>ear</b> canal and middle ear cavity. Third, opening the aditus, the pressures difference in dB between the middle <b>ear</b> cavity and <b>external</b> <b>ear</b> canal were larger than those of the closed mastoid cavity in low frequency (< 1000 [*]Hz). Finally, there was no significant difference in the acoustic pressure between the oval window and round window is noted and increased by 5 [*]dB by blocking the aditus. These results suggest that our complete FE model including the mastoid cavity is potentially useful and can provide more information in the study of middle ear biomechanics.|$|R
40|$|AbstractHuman {{temporal}} {{bones in}} teaching ear surgery are rare. The lamb's temporal bone {{might be a}} possible alternative. Material and Methods: Temporal bones of the lamb were dissected with a typical temporal bone lab drilling program. We included a mastoidectomy, endaural approaches, but also analyzed the outer appearance, the <b>external</b> <b>ear</b> canal and the hypotympanon. Some steps differed from preparation done in humans. The morphometric results were compared to the known anatomy of human in order to verify the lambs' temporal bone for suitability in otosurgic training. Results: The lambs' temporal bone appears smaller than the human one. We found a bullous extended hypotympanon located under the <b>external</b> <b>ear</b> canal. The tympanic membrane {{is very similar to}} the human one. The <b>external</b> <b>ear</b> canal is smaller and shorter. The ossicular chain shows analogies to human one. Discussion: This study shows, that especially the middle ear, the tympanic membrane and the <b>external</b> <b>ear</b> canal are morphologically equal to the structures found in human temporal bones. The lamb seems feasible for teaching the anatomy of the ear. The smaller scales of some structures, especially the outer components of the temporal bone are a disadvantage.
