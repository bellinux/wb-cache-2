40|$|For some model {{molecules}} (methanoic and <b>ethanoic</b> <b>acids,</b> methane, and phenol), systematic {{investigations of}} quantum yields {{were carried out}} in the present paper, as a function of concentration and of absorbed radiant power. Quantum yields ÃŽÂ¦Ã¢ÂˆÂž, calculated from rates, followed an apparently Langmuirian function of initial concentration C 0, by which ÃŽÂ¦Ã¢ÂˆÂž values at Ã¢Â€ÂœinfiniteÃ¢Â€Â concentration could be obtained. By having thus established that quantum yields of photomineralisation ÃŽÂ¦Ã¢ÂˆÂž are independent of radiation wavelength, within the absorption range of semiconductor, but depend on radiant power, such a dependency was experimentally investigated. For all the investigated molecules, the maximum allowable values reached in the low radiant power range clearly appeared as a plateau. On the contrary, at high radiant power values, another plateau, at a value of about 1 / 4 - 1 / 5 with respect to the maximum value, was evident. This was interpreted {{on the basis of a}} competition kinetics of hydroxyl radicals with themselves, leading to hydrogen peroxide formation, other than with substrate or intermediate molecules leading to full mineralisation. Modelling of quantum yields as a function of concentration and radiant power thus allows a fully consistent and trustworthy design of photoreactors...|$|R

Pure TiO 2 and TiO 2 :Cr thin films were deposited by means of radio frequency (RF) magnetron co-sputtering (13.56  MHz) technique on the PS/mc-Si substrates. Technical details of the co-sputtering deposition conditions were reported elsewhere[16]. The TiO 2 target was submitted to an RF power of 360  W, while the Cr element target was sputtered with variable power values (Pcr) ranging from 8 to 150  W. The Cr content in the TiO 2 :Cr films increases with Pcr and can be adjusted, at will, from 2 to 17  at. % Cr[16].

The effect of PS and TiO 2 /PS on the minority carrier diffusion length (L) of the active mc-Si material was evaluated by means of light beam-induced current (LBIC) measurements using the 632 -nm wavelength of a He-Ne laser. The effective minority carrier lifetimes (τeff) were measured by photoconductance technique (WCT- 120).

40|$|Hydrogen {{peroxide}} (HP) can degrade soluble heme, forming {{yellow or}} colorless degradation products. Thermal treatment during bloodmeal production changes the conformation of oxyhemoglobin trapping heme in hydrophobic protein regions or forms methemoglobin (metHb) heme which catalytically removes HP. As a result, HP can only degrade {{a portion of}} the heme present in bloodmeal leading to poor decoloring. Equilibrium peracetic acid (PAA) solutions can effectively decolor bloodmeal. This work assessed the ability of PAA to decolor bloodmeal and the mechanism by which it occurs. The inability of HP to decolor bloodmeal is determined {{by the fact that it}} is unable to permanently degrade metHb heme, or hydrophobically trapped heme. Addition of organic acids to HP led to significant swelling of the protein chains but also to poorer decoloring and lower HP consumption compared to PAA. This suggested that in the case of PAA solutions, where bleaching was facile, the reason PAA solutions are capable of decoloring bloodmeal was due to the action of the PAA molecule against heme, whereas HP and acetic (<b>ethanoic)</b> <b>acid</b> played only minor roles in total bleaching. The decolored protein powder has reduced odor and whiter color, and is suitable for applications such as bioplastics...|$|E
