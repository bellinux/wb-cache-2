40|$|Printed {{electronics}} {{can lower}} the cost and increase the ubiquity of electrical components such as batteries, sensors, and telemetry systems. Unfortunately, the advance of printed electronics has been held back by the limited minimum resolution, aspect ratio, and feature fidelity of present printing techniques such as <b>gravure,</b> <b>screen</b> printing and inkjet printing. Templated dry printing offers a solution to these problems by patterning nanoparticle inks into templates before drying. This dissertation shows advancements in two varieties of templated dry nanoprinting. The first, advective micromolding in vapor-permeable templates (AMPT) is a microfluidic approach that uses evaporation-driven mold filling to create submicron features with a 1 : 1 aspect ratio. We will discuss submicron surface acoustic wave (SAW) resonators made through this process, and the refinement process in the template manufacturing process necessary to make these devices. We also present modeling techniques {{that can be applied}} to future AMPT templates. We conclude with a modified templated dry printing that improves throughput and isolated feature patterning by transferring dry-templated features with laser ablation. This method utilizes surface energy-defined templates to pattern features via doctor blade coating. Patterned and dried features can be transferred to a polymer substrate with an Nd:YAG MOPA fiber laser, and printed features can be smaller than the laser beam width...|$|E
40|$|Printed {{electronics}} {{represent an}} alternative {{solution for the}} manufacturing of low-temperature and large area flexible electronics. The use of inkjet printing is showing major advantages {{when compared to other}} established printing technologies such as <b>gravure,</b> <b>screen</b> or offset printing, allowing the reduction of manufacturing costs due to its efficient material usage and the direct-writing approach without requirement of any masks. However, several technological restrictions for printed electronics can hinder its application potential, e. g. the device stability under atmospheric or even more stringent conditions. Here, we study the influence of specific mechanical, chemical, and temperature treatments usually appearing in manufacturing processes for textiles on the electrical performance of all-inkjet-printed organic thin-film transistors (OTFTs). Therefore, OTFTs where manufactured with silver electrodes, a UV curable dielectric, and 6, 13 -bis(triisopropylsilylethynyl) pentance (TIPS-pentacene) as the active semiconductor layer. All the layers were deposited using inkjet printing. After electrical characterization of the printed OTFTs, a simple encapsulation method was applied followed by the degradation study allowing a comparison of the electrical performance of treated and not treated OTFTs. Industrial calendering, dyeing, washing and stentering were selected as typical textile processes and treatment methods for the printed OTFTs. It is shown that the all-inkjet-printed OTFTs fabricated in this work are functional after their submission to the textiles processes but with degradation in the electrical performance, exhibiting higher degradation in the OTFTs with shorter channel lengths (L = 10 μm) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{hypothesis}} {{of this study}} supposes {{that it is possible}} to design a more accurate prepress, 2 ̆ 2 user friendly 2 ̆ 2 method of type selection for gravure printing than the system used today. The experimental methods chosen for this project were based on the suggestions made by the Gravure Association of America, the professors at Rochester Institute of Technology, and the technical staff at Areata Graphics, Buffalo, NY. The purpose of these methods was to gather technical information about how the gravure printing process generates type images. More specifically, this meant investigating the effects of the <b>gravure</b> <b>screen</b> on type. To accomplish this, line and circle patterns of various widths and a variety of typefaces, styles, and sizes were printed by gravure at Areata Graphics in four different engraving settings most commonly used for publication printing. The printed samples were measured and analyzed, both visually and with magnification equipment. The typeface samples of different styles and sizes were subjected to a panel review by five gravure printing professionals through the Gravure Association of America for their acceptablility or unacceptability for gravure reproduction. The results of the panel review were subjected to statistical analysis and correlations were drawn to the results of the visual observation and measurement of the samples. The results of this study suggest that a wider range of typefaces and typeface styles are suitable for gravure printing than those identified by the system of type selection used today. The existing guidelines discourage the use of several typefaces and typeface styles that registered favorable responses from the Gravure Association of America 2 ̆ 7 s panel review in this study. Garamond Light, a typeface characterized by fine serifs and thick and thin strokes, and traditionally thought as unsuitable for gravure printing was found to be acceptable at seven point size type. Statistical analysis of the Gravure Association of America 2 ̆ 7 s panel review revealed that only one of the four engraving settings tested (60 - 0), registered a high percentage of statistically significant responses. In engraving setting 60 - 0, it was possible to determine the cutoff point between acceptable and unacceptable type sizes for sixteen of the nineteen typeface styles tested. The majority of typeface styles were found to have lower acceptable type size limits at seven and eight point size type. The italic or oblique styles registered higher lower limits, at least one type size higher than the normal style of the same typeface. This can be attributed to the distortion of the line image caused by the <b>gravure</b> <b>screen</b> referred to as 2 ̆ 2 jaggies 2 ̆ 2 and observed to be more pronounced in italic and oblique styles as compared to normal styles. The visual observation of the 2 ̆ 2 jaggies 2 ̆ 2 in the line and circle patterns supports this conclusion. It appeared unusual that the statistical analysis of the GAA panel review recorded a high percentage of statistically significant findings for only one engraving setting. The GAA judges 2 ̆ 7 responses appeared to follow the same pattern for all the engraving settings except that the finer screen settings recorded more favorable responses in smaller type sizes. Statistical tests were run on the original experimental data assuming that if type sizes two and three had been included in the type sample review, the judges would have found them unacceptable for gravure printing. The results of these tests recorded one hundred percent statistically significant findings for all four engraving settings. The finer screen settings recorded lower type size preferences which can be attributed to the sharper and finer rendering of smaller type sizes in these settings. It is recommended that the Gravure Association of America examine these findings and decide on their significance. The primary conclusion of the study is that the hypothesis is true. It is possible to design a more accurate prepress, 2 ̆ 2 user-friendly 2 ̆ 2 system of type selection for gravure printing than the system used today. This study explores the possibility of using a mechanical means of measuring typefaces for suitability for gravure printing. The results show that it is not possible to predict the suitability of a particular typeface, type style, or type size by mechanical means alone. However, a tool to measure typefaces may be a very effective way to eliminate a large number of typefaces, styles, and sizes from consideration. Two models of practical or 2 ̆ 2 user-friendly 2 ̆ 2 methods of type measurement may be useful tools to develop. One method involves measuring type from type sample books, the other using computer software programs...|$|E

30|$|Micro and {{nanofabrication}} {{are essential}} for the modern electronic devices [1]. Recently, printed electronics has been highlighted by many researchers in academia and industry as emerging manufacturing technologies to fabricate portable and display devices [2 – 6]. The fabrication methods of printed electronics reported so far include direct printing techniques such as inkjet, <b>gravure,</b> and <b>screen</b> printing [7 – 9]. These techniques have been put forward as alternative methods for patterning conducting circuits due to the short manufacturing time, low cost, large-area patternability, and environmental friendliness compared to conventional photolithography [10]. Printed electronics {{is based on an}} additive manufacturing technology and thereby requires heat treatment after the printing process. In addition, the features of the patterns directly printed on a substrate also depend on the heat treatment. Therefore, it is essential to understand the behaviors of nanoparticles in a sintering process in order to provide an insight into the printing techniques.|$|R
30|$|Freedom {{of design}} that was {{introduced}} as organic photovoltaic (OPV) modules were fabricated by printing. As proof-of-concept, we show OPV leaf fabrication in A 5 size using <b>gravure</b> and rotary <b>screen</b> printing processes {{for the main}} active layers of the OPV structure. These printing methods allow direct printing {{of any kind of}} arbitrary, two-dimensional shapes including patterning of the electric contacts thus post-patterning stages are not needed. Fabrication of custom-shaped OPV modules requires detailed information about the technical boundaries set by the manufacturing process and materials which in turn influence the layout design and R 2 R upscaling. In this paper, we show custom-shaped OPV modules, patterned directly in a shape of a tree leaf with an overall size of 110  cm 2 and an active area of 50  cm 2 providing a power conversion efficiency of 2.0 % and maximum power of 98  mW.|$|R

Ink market in Bangladesh is growing parallel {{to the growth of}} printing and packaging material industries. There is significant demand of various types of industrial ink in Bangladesh, such as Flexo Ink, <b>Gravure,</b> Offset, <b>Screen</b> Printing Ink and Letterpress Printing. In this study, focus was mainly given on metal sheet ink market and to some extent on Flexo and Gravure ink as market size of those ink are quite substantial. The study covered ink producers, annual consumption, value, importers, ink association and ink types to collect all types of information regarding this industry. From the study, the estimated annual market size of Flexo ink in Bangladesh is 5444 M. Ton in volume and BDT 188. 44 Crore in value and Gravure ink is 10, 509 M. ton in volume and BDT 370. 65 Crore in value. Out of 15 major ink producers in the country, 5 ink manufacturers currently produce Flexo ink and Gravure ink. The big users of Flexo ink in Bangladesh are WPP bag manufacturer companies. Bengal poly and paper sacks, Paragon Limited, Khan Brothers are major WPP bag manufacturers. The major ink users of Gravure are the food packaging companies and among them Premafelx, BRAC printing, Mecca Multilayer, Arbab Poly are the bigger ones. There only five major market player in metal sheet industries and those are Abul Khair, KDS, S. Alom, PHP and Appolo ispat. Seven rings cement, Shah Cement, Desh Bondhu Polymer, and Tiger Cement etc. are some of the companies that are using Flexo ink. Some of the ink users import the raw materials from outside and hire chemist to make their own ink in Bangladesh. These metal sheet companies directly import major portion of their ink requirement. Ink and Thinner are complementary goods. Almost all of the thinner are imported from outside of Bangladesh as there are no good thinner manufactures here. From the study, the market size of Thinner for Flexo printing is 7777. 14 M. ton / year in volume and BDT 145. 24 Crore in value and for Gravure printing is 12892. 77 M. ton /year and 232. 75 Crore in value. Many big companies like Premaflex wants to inspire the local ink manufactures to make quality ink as the local ink is not yet as good as imported.

30|$|The entire OPV device stack can be {{directly}} printed into any kind of two-dimensional shape using mass-manufacturing printing technologies, namely <b>gravure,</b> flexography and <b>screen</b> printing [2, 13]. These printing methods and the materials used for printing however set some technical boundary conditions for the layout design, which are especially important for the electrical performance of the modules. In this work, the technical boundaries for the custom-shaped OPVs were determined by the processing method, the used equipment and materials. First, the overall feature size was defined to be 120 by 130  mm. This was limited by the engraved area of the gravure printing plate {{and the size of}} the evaporation mask. Secondly, the dimensions of the individual OPV cells were influenced by the electrode materials. The length of the cell was limited to 50  mm due to the thermal evaporating process of LiF/Al where the fine features of the shadow mask are prone for bending, and the width of the cells were fixed into 5  mm due to the sheet resistance of ITO [5]. Additionally, the precision of the printed image is influenced by the dimensional accuracy of the printed layer i.e. the shrinking/spreading of the ink thus the dimensions of the test prints were compared with the layout. In R 2 R rotary screen printing of ITO, the dimensions in machine (MD) and cross-machine direction (CD) perpendicular to the direction of printing deviated + 0.2 % (MD) and + 0.1 % (CD). In S 2 S, gravure printing of PEDOT:PSS dimensions deviated + 4 % (MD) and + 0.4 % (CD) compared to the layout and respectively, P 3 HT:PCBM − 0.9 % and + 0.1 %.|$|R
