25|$|Polyacetylene can be {{synthesized}} by ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) from cyclooctatetraene, {{a material}} easier to handle than the acetylene monomer. This synthetic route {{also provides a}} facile method for adding solubilizing groups to the polymer while maintaining the conjugation. Robert Grubbs and coworkers synthesized a variety of polyacetylene derivatives with linear and branched alkyl chains. Polymers with linear groups such as n-octyl had <b>high</b> <b>conductivity</b> but low solubility, while highly branched tert-butyl groups increased solubility but decreased conjugation due to polymer twisting to avoid steric crowding. They obtained soluble and conductive polymers with sec-butyl and neopentyl groups, because the methylene (CH2) unit directly connected to the polymer reduces steric crowding and prevents twisting.|$|E

25|$|A {{direct current}} flows uniformly {{throughout}} the cross-section of a uniform wire. An alternating current of any frequency is forced {{away from the}} wire's center, toward its outer surface. This is because the acceleration of an electric charge in an alternating current produces waves of electromagnetic radiation that cancel the propagation of electricity {{toward the center of}} materials with <b>high</b> <b>conductivity.</b> This phenomenon is called skin effect. At very high frequencies the current no longer flows in the wire, but effectively flows {{on the surface of the}} wire, within a thickness of a few skin depths. The skin depth is the thickness at which the current density is reduced by 63%. Even at relatively low frequencies used for power transmission (50Hz – 60Hz), non-uniform distribution of current still occurs in sufficiently thick conductors. For example, the skin depth of a copper conductor is approximately 8.57mm at 60Hz, so high current conductors are usually hollow to reduce their mass and cost. Since the current tends to flow in the periphery of conductors, the effective cross-section of the conductor is reduced. This increases the effective AC resistance of the conductor, since resistance is inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area. The AC resistance often is many times higher than the DC resistance, causing a much higher energy loss due to ohmic heating (also called I2R loss).|$|E
