The objectives {{of this study were}} to evaluate the attitudes and knowledge of ICU nurses regarding oral care delivery to critically ill patients in Saudi Arabian ICUs. The findings were further correlated to the presence of healthcare <b>quality</b> <b>accreditation</b> of the institution. Materials and Methods: The nurses′ knowledge, attitudes, and healthcare <b>quality</b> <b>accreditation</b> status of the hospital were recorded. Two hundred fifteen nurses conveniently selected from 10 random hospitals were included in this study from Riyadh city, Saudi Arabia.

The majority of the nurses agreed that the oral cavity is difficult to clean and that oral care delivery is a high priority for mechanically ventilated patients.

Conclusion: The presence of healthcare <b>quality</b> <b>accreditation</b> did not reflect any significance in attitudes or knowledge of the ICU nurses in regard to mechanically ventilated patients.
