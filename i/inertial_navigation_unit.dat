40|$|A major {{tenet of}} Network Centric Warfare is “Information Dominance. ” The {{accuracy}} {{and availability of}} position information directly affects operational effectiveness. The traditional role of positioning was for “own ship ” pilotage. That is, “can I get from Point A to Point B? ” The evolving role of positioning is as a shared resource to establish nearperfect Situation Awareness (SA) to enhance Command and Control (C 2). C 2 systems such as the Army Battle Command Systems (ABCS) rely on digitized position reports from all platforms on the battlefield. The predominate source of that position data is the NAVSTAR Global Positioning System (GPS). GPS provides a common consistent coordinate reference. GPS accuracy does not degrade with time or distance traveled as self-contained <b>navigation</b> <b>units,</b> e. g. <b>Inertial</b> <b>Navigation</b> <b>Units</b> (INU) or Doppler Radar Navigation Sets. In addition, GPS receivers are significantly less expensive to integrate, operate and maintain than INU’s or Doppler’s. GPS has vulnerabilities to Electro-Magnetic Interference (EMI) and satellite signal blockage. Technology initiatives are concentrating on investigating sophisticated integration techniques for combining externally-aided and self-contained navigation systems. This paper addresses the relationship of navigation systems to command and control systems and recent/new technology initiatives to improve the robustness of position information...|$|R

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} {{the efficacy of}} a commercial portable 2 D laser scanner (operating at a wavelength close to 1, 000 nm) deployed from a fixed-wing aircraft for measuring the sea surface topography and wave profiles over coastal waters. The LiDAR instrumentation enabled simultaneous measurements of the 2 D laser scanner with two independent <b>inertial</b> <b>navigation</b> <b>units,</b> and also simultaneous measurements with a more advanced 2 D laser scanner (operating at a wavelength near 1, 500 nm). The latter scanner is used routinely for accurately measuring terrestrial topography and {{was used as a}} benchmark in this study. We present examples of sea surface topography and wave profiles based on low altitude surveys (< ~ 300 m) over coastal waters in the vicinity of Cape de Couedic, Kangaroo Island, South Australia and over the surf zone adjacent to the mouth of the Murray River, South Australia. Relative wave heights in the former survey are shown to be consistent with relative wave heights observed from a waverider buoy located near Cape de Couedic during the LiDAR survey. The sea surface topography of waves in the surf zone was successfully mapped with both laser scanners resolving relative wave height variations and fine structure of the sea surface to within approximately 10 cm. A topographic map of the sea surface referenced to the airborne sensor frame transforms to an accurate altimetry map which may be used with airborne electromagnetic instrumentation to provide an averaged altimetry covering a portion of the larger electromagnetic footprint. This averaged altimetry is deemed to be significantly more reliable as a measurement of altimetry than spot measurements using a nadir-looking laser altimeter and would therefore improve upon the use of airborne electromagnetic methods for bathymetric mapping in surf-zone waters. The aperture range of the scanner does not necessarily determine the swath. We observed that instead, the maximum swath at a given altitude was limited by the angle of incidence of the laser at the water surface...|$|R
40|$|GeoSAR is an airborne, {{interferometric}} Synthetic Aperture Radar (IFSAR) {{system for}} terrain mapping, currently under development by a consortium including NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), Calgis, Inc., a California mapping sciences company, and the California Department of Conservation (CaIDOC), with funding {{provided by the}} U. S. Army Corps of Engineers Topographic Engineering Center (TEC) and the U. S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). IFSAR data processing requires high-accuracy platform position and attitude knowledge. On 9 GeoSAR, these are provided by one or two Honeywell Embedded GPS <b>Inertial</b> <b>Navigation</b> <b>Units</b> (EGI) and an Ashtech Z 12 GPS receiver. The EGIs provide real-time high-accuracy attitude and moderate-accuracy position data, while the Ashtech data, post-processed differentially with data from a nearby ground station using Ashtech PNAV software, provide high-accuracy differential GPS positions. These data are optimally combined using a Kalman filter within the GeoSAR motion measurement software, and the resultant position and orientation information are used to process the dual frequency (X-band and P-band) radar data to generate high-accuracy, high -resolution terrain imagery and digital elevation models (DEMs). GeoSAR requirements specify sub-meter level planimetric and vertical accuracies for the resultant DEMS. To achieve this, platform positioning errors well below one meter are needed. The goal of GeoSAR is to obtain 25 cm or better 3 -D positions from the GPS systems on board the aircraft. By imaging a set of known point target corner-cube reflectors, the GeoSAR system can be calibrated. This calibration process yields the true position of the aircraft with an uncertainty of 20 - 50 cm. This process thus allows an independent assessment of the accuracy of our GPS-based positioning systems. We will present {{an overview of the}} GeoSAR motion measurement system, focusing on the use of GPS and the blending of position data from the various systems. We will present the results of our calibration studies that relate to the accuracy the GPS positioning. We will discuss the effects these positioning, errors have on the resultant DEM products and imagery...|$|R

Major {{differences}} include the carriage of the AGM-45 Shrike, AGM-88 HARM, and the AIM-120 missiles, which entered service in September 1991. From Block 30D, aircraft were fitted with larger engine air intakes (called a Modular Common Inlet Duct) for the increased-thrust GE engine. Since the Block 32 retained the Pratt and Whitney F-100 engine, the smaller (normal shock inlet) was retained for those aircraft. A total of 733 aircraft were produced and delivered to six countries. The Block 32H/J aircraft {{assigned to the}} USAF Thunderbird flight demonstration squadron were built in 1986 and 1987 and {{are some of the}} oldest operational F-16s in the Air Force. The Air National Guard procured many upgrades for their fleet of aging block 30/32s including the addition of improved inertial guidance systems, improved electronic warfare suite (AN/ALQ-213), and upgrades to carry the Northrop Grumman LITENING targeting pod. The standard <b>Inertial</b> <b>Navigation</b> <b>Unit</b> (INU) was first changed to a ring laser gyro, and later upgraded again to an Embedded GPS/INS (EGI) system which combines a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver with an Inertial navigation system (INS).

The key problem is to design a nonlinear filter to fuse IMU and radiolocation information.

40|$|Knowledge of {{your own}} and other's {{positions}} are frequently a prerequisite for acting, leading others, and interacting in and with the environment; to retrieve relevant information and to process and interpret it; and to understand, compile, and learn from observations of the surrounding and its dynamics. This holds for humans {{as well as for}} machines and systems made for supporting and controlling them. Consequently, systems which automatically provide position information of peoples are of interest and the larger subject area of this thesis. Position can be obtained from well-known infrastructure based systems such as GPS. However, these systems carry obvious drawbacks in their infrastructure dependence which gives them limited coverage and system robustness. By observing our own ability to localize ourselves, it is obvious that localization without infrastructure at with a better (relative) accuracy is achievable. The development over the last decades of sensor and processing hardware and statistical methods have started to make such localization possible. This thesis specifically concerns systems and statistical methods for infrastructure-free localization. The this primarily deals with statistical methods but also describe hardware in terms of high-level system designs. For many critical applications such as positioning of emergency responders, dismounted soldiers, and security personnel, it is unsuitable for the positioning system to be dependent on infrastructure or prior knowledge about the environment. Consequently, this thesis deals with systems and methods for infrastructure-free and prior-knowledge-free pedestrian localization. The thesis is specifically concerned with statistical methods but will also cover hardware in terms of high-level system designs. The thesis is composed of an introduction followed by a collection of papers which are divided into two parts, each concerning a separate problem area. The introduction motivates and describes the localization problem in general terms and gives a coherent guide to the articles. The first group of articles together describes an infrastructure-free system for tactical localization of small units of agents. The physical implementation of the localization system carries the name TOR (Tacitcal lOcatoR) and have been tested on fire fighters during realistic smoke diving exercises. This system primarily depends on pedestrian dead-reckoning based on foot-mounted <b>inertial</b> <b>navigation</b> and inter-agent radio ranging. The core parts of the system which are dealt with are: foot-mounted <b>inertial</b> <b>navigation</b> <b>units</b> which provides dead reckoning of individual agents, system structure and estimation algorithms which, based on the dead reckoning and inter-agent ranging, provides estimates of the agent positions, initialization algorithms for the estimation, and a user interface which exploits voice radio communication and 3 D-audio to let the agents hear where they have each other. The second group of articles concerns low-level processing for extraction of spatial information of camera images (video), a prevailing infrastructure-free data source for relating an agent's position to the environment. These articles are focused on formalization and fast implementations of fundamental processing steps. An implementation of scale-space only relying on integer signal representation of image data and simple arithmetic operations is presented. Further, a unifying theory of feature point orientation assignment is derived and a novel method for the same is presented. Thereafter, the small but frequently occuring processing step in which image gradient samples are binned based on their argument, is treated and three fast solutions with varying properties are suggested. Finally, a localization system based on <b>inertial</b> <b>navigation</b> aided by imagery data is presented. QC 20131105 </p...|$|R

Unfortunately, in conjunction with dead reckoning localization approaches, the position accuracy is degraded by the accumulation of sensor errors. Most pedestrian dead reckoning systems are therefore adapted to human gait patterns to constraint this error growth. These interventions however make them ignore any user displacements different from doing steps, such as by elevators and escalators, {{and as a result}} they fail to track the full user trajectory indoors.

40|$|GeoSAR is an airborne, {{interferometric}} Synthetic Aperture Radar (INSAR) {{system for}} terrain mapping, currently under development by a consortium including NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), Calgis, Inc., and the California Department of Conservation (CalDOC) with funding {{provided by the}} Topographic Engineering Center (TEC) of the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). The radar simultaneously maps swaths {{on both sides of}} the aircraft at two frequencies, X-Band and P-Band. For the P-Band system, data is collected for two across track interferometric baselines and at the crossed polarization. The aircraft position and attitude are measured using two Honeywell Embedded GPS <b>Inertial</b> <b>Navigation</b> <b>Units</b> (EGI) and an Ashtech Z 12 GPS receiver. The mechanical orientation and position of the antennas are actively measured using a Laser Baseline Metrology System (LBMS). In the GeoSAR motion measurement software, these data are optimally combined with data from a nearby ground station using Ashtech PNAV software to produce the position, orientation, and baseline information are used to process the dual frequency radar data. Proper calibration of the GeoSAR system is essential to obtaining digital elevation models (DEMS) with the required sub-meter level planimetric and vertical accuracies. Calibration begins with the determination of the yaw and pitch biases for the two EGI units. Common range delays are determined for each mode, along with differential time and phase delays between channels. Because the antennas are measured by the LBMS, baseline calibration consists primarily of measuring a constant offset between mechanical center and the electrical phase center of the antennas. A phase screen, an offset to the interferometric phase difference which is a function of absolute phase, is applied to the interferometric data to compensate for multipath and leakage. Calibration parameters are calculated for each of the ten processing modes, each of the operational bandwidths (80 and 160 MHZ), and each aircraft altitude. In this talk we will discuss the layout calibration sites, the synthesis of data from multiple flights to improve the calibration, methods for determining time and phase delays, and techniques for determining radiometric and polarimetric quantities. We will describe how calibration quantities are incorporated into the processor and pre-processor. We will demonstrate our techniques applied to GeoSar data and assess the stability and accuracy of the calibration. This will be compared to the modeled performance determined from calibrating the output of a point target simulator.
