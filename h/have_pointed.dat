5|$|On 9 December, one of Albert's doctors, William Jenner, {{diagnosed}} typhoid fever. Albert died at 10:50p.m. on 14 December 1861 in the Blue Room at Windsor Castle, in {{the presence}} of the Queen and five of their nine children. The contemporary diagnosis was typhoid fever, but modern writers <b>have</b> <b>pointed</b> out that Albert was ill for at least two years before his death, which may indicate that a chronic disease, such as Crohn's disease, renal failure, or abdominal cancer, was the cause of death.|$|E
5|$|Scholars of anthropology, sociology, and {{feminism}} <b>have</b> <b>pointed</b> out {{the symbolic}} nature of phallic architecture, especially large skyscrapers which dominate the landscape {{as symbols of}} male domination, power and political authority.

There are many examples of modern architecture that {{can be interpreted as}} phallic, but very few for which the architect has specifically cited or admitted that meaning as an intentional aspect of the design.|$|E

Women's tombstones have rounded tops; men's <b>have</b> <b>pointed</b> tops, and inscriptions for royalty are gilt. For family members, small mausoleums with intricately-decorated stone walls were built.|$|E

5|$|The {{painting}} {{has been}} called a masterpiece depiction of a battle scene, and much more than a simple depiction of a bloody battle. It is a complex picture, requiring more than a cursory look; a French critic, viewing it in Paris in 1879, declared that it was a museum in its own right, requiring eight days of study before one could properly appreciate it. At the same time, critics <b>have</b> <b>pointed</b> to the unrealistic depiction of the battle, and some anachronistic accessories present in the painting. Others have criticized the painting for being too crowded and chaotic.|$|E
5|$|Tooth shape {{depends on}} the shark's diet: those that feed on mollusks and {{crustaceans}} have dense and flattened teeth used for crushing, those that feed on fish have needle-like teeth for gripping, and those that feed on larger prey such as mammals <b>have</b> <b>pointed</b> lower teeth for gripping and triangular upper teeth with serrated edges for cutting. The teeth of plankton-feeders such as the basking shark are small and non-functional.|$|E
5|$|Eliot {{included}} other literary sources {{within the}} poem: Stéphane Mallarmé, W. B. Yeats, Jonathan Swift, Arnaut Daniel, Nijinsky's dancing in Le Spectre de la Rose, and Shakespeare's Hamlet. Religious images {{were used to}} connect the poem to the writings of Julian of Norwich, to {{the life and death}} of Thomas Wentworth, to William Laud, to Charles I, and to John Milton. Eliot relied on theological statements similar to those of Alfred, Lord Tennyson's In Memoriam and Thomas Hardy's The Impercipient. The Bible also played a large role within the poem, especially in discussions on the Holy Spirit and Pentecost. Many commentators <b>have</b> <b>pointed</b> out the influence of George Herbert within the poem, but Eliot, in a letter to Anne Ridler dated 10 March 1941, stated that he was trying to avoid such connections within Little Gidding.|$|E

5|$|Except for nautiloids (represented by {{the modern}} order Nautilida) and coleoids (which had already diverged into modern octopodes, squids, and cuttlefish) all {{other species of}} the {{molluscan}} class Cephalopoda became extinct at the K–Pg boundary. These included the ecologically significant belemnoids, {{as well as the}} ammonoids, a group of highly diverse, numerous, and widely distributed shelled cephalopods. Researchers <b>have</b> <b>pointed</b> out that the reproductive strategy of the surviving nautiloids, which rely upon few and larger eggs, played a role in outsurviving their ammonoid counterparts through the extinction event. The ammonoids utilized a planktonic strategy of reproduction (numerous eggs and planktonic larvae), which would have been devastated by the K–Pg extinction event. Additional research has shown that subsequent to this elimination of ammonoids from the global biota, nautiloids began an evolutionary radiation into shell shapes and complexities theretofore known only from ammonoids.|$|E
5|$|Historian Jean-Claude Willame {{argued that}} the speech {{was the result of}} Lumumba's growing {{frustration}} with the process of independence which he believed might represent a purely nominal change in government with no real effects. Lumumba blamed Kasa-Vubu and his colleagues for failing to publicly oppose this situation. Gender historians have therefore {{argued that the}} speech was the result of Lumumba's growing feeling of emasculation. Others <b>have</b> <b>pointed</b> to the influence of Belgian Socialist delegates and representatives of the Guinean President, Ahmed Sékou Touré, who had a strongly Marxist ideology, all of whom hoped a public and international denouncement of colonialism would help them politically.|$|E
5|$|It was alleged by medieval chroniclers that Edward II and Piers Gaveston were lovers, a rumour {{that was}} {{reinforced}} by later portrayals in fiction, such as Christopher Marlowe's late 16th-century play Edward II. This assertion has received the support of some modern historians, while others have questioned it. According to Pierre Chaplais, {{the relationship between the}} two was that of an adoptive brotherhood, and Gaveston served as an unofficial deputy for a reluctant king. Other historians, like J. S. Hamilton, <b>have</b> <b>pointed</b> out that concern over the two men's sexuality was not at the core of the nobility's grievances, which rather centred on Gaveston's exclusive access to royal patronage.|$|E

5|$|John's father {{augmented}} the family's {{position by}} exploiting the favour of the King, Henry VI, {{to whom he}} was an important councillor in the 1440s. Already Earl of Suffolk, John's father was in turn elevated to a marquess (in 1444) and then Duke of Suffolk (1448), and with these titles received major grants from the crown. Also, it had been his father's receipt of the wardship of Margaret Beaufort from the king that enabled John's marriage to her, whilst both were still infants and despite them being within the prohibted degrees of consanguinity. Contemporaries claimed that the marriage to the daughter of John Beaufort, Duke of Somerset (cousin of the-then childless king) was intended to make John de la Pole an eventual heir to the crown; this is considered unlikely by modern historians, who <b>have</b> <b>pointed</b> at indications that the King supported William in these plans. It {{has suggested that the}} marriage was the direct result of Willim's political difficulties during the 1450-1 parliament.|$|E
5|$|Since Reagan {{left office}} in 1989, {{substantial}} debate has occurred among scholars, historians, {{and the general}} public surrounding his legacy. Supporters <b>have</b> <b>pointed</b> to a more efficient and prosperous economy as a result of Reagan's economic policies, foreign policy triumphs including a peaceful end to the Cold War, and a restoration of American pride and morale. Proponents also argue Reagan restored faith in the American Dream with his unabated and passionate love for the United States, after a decline in American confidence and self-respect under Jimmy Carter's perceived weak leadership, particularly during the Iran hostage crisis, as well as his gloomy, dreary outlook {{for the future of the}} United States during the 1980 election. Critics contend that Reagan's economic policies resulted in rising budget deficits, a wider gap in wealth, and an increase in homelessness and that the Iran–Contra affair lowered American credibility.|$|E
5|$|The pelagic {{stingray}} {{is an active}} predator that captures prey by wrapping its pectoral fins around it, before manipulating it to the mouth. It is the only stingray in which both sexes <b>have</b> <b>pointed</b> teeth, for grasping and cutting into slippery prey. A wide variety of organisms are represented in its diet: crustaceans including amphipods, krill, and larval crabs, molluscs including squid, octopus, and pteropods, bony fishes including herring, mackerel, sea horses and filefish, comb jellies and medusae, and polychaete worms. Off California, {{pelagic stingray}}s hunt large mating aggregations of squid that form from November to April. Off Brazil, this species follows groups of Atlantic cutlassfish (Trichiurus lepturus) towards the coast in January and February, with both predators seeking small schooling fishes. Juvenile rays consume 67% of their body weight in food per day, which declines to just above 1% in adults.|$|E
