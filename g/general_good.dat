5|$|Khrushchev's U.S. visit {{resulted}} in an informal agreement with U.S. president Dwight Eisenhower {{that there would be}} no firm deadline over Berlin, but that there would be a four-power summit to try to resolve the issue, and the premier left the U.S. to <b>general</b> <b>good</b> feelings. Khrushchev returned from the U.S. convinced that he had achieved a strong personal relationship with Eisenhower (who in fact was unimpressed by the Soviet leader) and that he could achieve détente with the Americans. He pushed for an immediate summit, but was frustrated by French President Charles de Gaulle, who postponed it until 1960, a year in which Eisenhower was scheduled to pay a return visit to the Soviet Union.|$|E

Because of that season-ending victory and the Hokies' <b>general</b> <b>good</b> performance during the 2009 season, Virginia Tech was ranked No. 10 in preseason national polling. The Hokies' {{first game of the}} season was a nationally televised contest against then-No. 3 Boise State at FedExField near Washington, D.C.. Because the game {{was the first of the}} season to feature two top-10 teams, it received large amounts of media coverage. During the game, Virginia Tech fell behind 17–0 in the first quarter, but rallied to take a 21–20 lead early in the third quarter. The two teams traded the lead, alternating scoring drives until Boise State scored a touchdown with 1:06 remaining. Virginia Tech was unable to reply one final time, and Boise State earned a 33–30 victory.|$|E

The proponents have identified solutions that would avoid much of the existing housing. The next section to the north is covered by a golf course that regularly suffers flooding in the winter.

25|$|A {{total of}} around 4,000 islanders were sentenced for {{breaking}} laws during the occupation (around 2,600 in Jersey and 1,400 in Guernsey); 570 prisoners {{were sent to}} continental prisons and camps, and at least 22 persons from Jersey and 9 from Guernsey did not return.

500|$|On the {{outbreak}} of the First World War in August 1914, Cruttwell enlisted in the Royal Berkshire Regiment and was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant. He fought in France and Belgium, until a severe leg wound in 1916 ended his front line military service. Apart from its physical effects, Cruttwell's experience in the trenches seemingly inflicted permanent psychological damage on his personality, replacing the <b>general</b> <b>good</b> manners of his youth with a short-tempered, impatient and bullying character. The novelist Evelyn Waugh, an undergraduate at Hertford in the 1920s, wrote later that [...] "It was as though he had never cleansed himself from the muck of the trenches". [...] In {{the latter part of the}} war, Cruttwell was employed in the military intelligence department at the War Office in London, before returning to Oxford in 1919. In 1922, he published a short history of his regiment's wartime exploits.|$|E

500|$|Although the State Opening of Parliament {{was planned}} for February 1605, {{concern over the}} plague delayed it until 3October. A {{contemporaneous}} government account has the plotters engaged in digging a tunnel beneath Parliament by December 1604, but no other evidence exists to prove this, and no trace of a tunnel has since been found. If the story is true, the plotters ceased their efforts when the tenancy to the undercroft beneath the House of Lords became available. Several months later, early in June 1605, Catesby met the principal Jesuit in England, Father Henry Garnet, on Thames Street in London. While discussing the war in Flanders, Catesby asked about the morality of [...] "killing innocents". Garnet said that such actions could often be excused, but according to his own account during a second meeting in July he showed Catesby {{a letter from the}} pope which forbade rebellion. Catesby replied, [...] "Whatever I mean to do, if the Pope knew, he would not hinder for the <b>general</b> <b>good</b> of our country." [...] Father Garnet's protestations prompted Catesby's next reply, [...] "I am not bound to take knowledge by you of the Pope's will." [...] Soon after, Father Tesimond told Father Garnet that while taking Catesby's confession he had learned of the plot. Father Garnet met with Catesby a third time on 24July at White Webbs in Enfield Chase, the home of Catesby's wealthy relative Anne Vaux, and a house long suspected by the government of harbouring Jesuit priests. Without acknowledging that he was aware of the precise nature of the plot, the priest tried in vain to dissuade Catesby from his course.|$|E
