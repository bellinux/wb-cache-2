25|$|Simpson {{wanted a}} speedy trial, {{and the defense}} and prosecuting {{attorneys}} worked around the clock for several months to prepare their cases. In October 1994, <b>Judge</b> <b>Ito</b> started interviewing 304 prospective jurors, each of whom had {{to fill out a}} 75-page questionnaire. On November 3, 12 jurors were seated with 12 alternates.|$|E
25|$|At 10:07a.m. PDT on October 3, 1995, O. J. Simpson {{was found}} not guilty of murder on both counts. The only {{testimony}} reviewed was that of limo driver Alan Park, who had said that he did not see Simpson's Bronco outside of the Rockingham estate when he arrived to pick him up (after the murders occurred). The jury arrived at the verdict by 3:00p.m. on October 2, after only four hours of deliberation, but <b>Judge</b> <b>Ito</b> postponed the announcement.|$|E
25|$|The {{issue of}} whether or not to allow any video cameras into the {{courtroom}} was among the first issues <b>Judge</b> <b>Ito</b> had to decide, ultimately ruling that live camera coverage was warranted. Ito would be later criticized for this decision by other legal professionals. Dershowitz said that he believed that Ito, along with others related to the case (Clark, Fuhrman, Kaelin), was influenced to some degree by the media presence, and the related publicity. The trial was covered in 2,237 news segments from 1994 through 1997.|$|E
25|$|<b>Judge</b> Lance <b>Ito</b> {{was also}} criticized for {{allowing}} the trial {{to become a}} media circus and {{not doing enough to}} regulate the court proceedings as well as he could have.|$|R
50|$|In early 1995, Lynn Redgrave and John Clark, at the {{invitation}} of <b>Judge</b> Lance <b>Ito,</b> performed the play for the sequestered jury on their day off, in the same courtroom where the O.J. Simpson trial was being held.|$|R
5000|$|Elysian Heights {{is served}} by Elysian Heights Elementary School. The author Beverly Mason was {{principal}} there for many years, and Toshi Ito, the mother of noted <b>judge</b> Lance <b>Ito,</b> taught kindergarten and 1st grade there for many years as well.|$|R
25|$|A women's shelter, Sojourn, {{received}} a call from Brown four days prior to the murders; she said that she was afraid of her ex-husband, whom she believed was stalking her. The prosecution did not present this information in court because they thought that <b>Judge</b> <b>Ito</b> would rule the evidence to be hearsay. In addition, friends and family indicated that Brown had consistently said that Simpson had been stalking her. She claimed that everywhere she went, she noticed Simpson would be there, watching her. Her friends Faye Resnick and Cynthia Shahian said she was afraid because Simpson had told her he would kill her if he ever found her with another man.|$|E
25|$|At the June 1994, {{grand jury}} hearing, Ross Cutlery {{provided}} store receipts indicating that Simpson had purchased a 12-inch (305mm) stiletto knife {{six weeks before}} the murders. The knife {{was determined to be}} similar to the one the coroner said caused the stab wounds. The prosecution did not present this evidence at trial after discovering that store employees had sold their story to The National Enquirer for $12,500. The knife was later collected from Simpson's residence by his attorneys; they presented it to <b>Judge</b> <b>Ito</b> and it was subsequently sealed in a manila envelope to be opened only if brought up at trial. This was not the murder weapon: tests on the knife determined that an oil used on new cutlery was still present on the knife, indicating the knife had never been used. The police searched Simpson's Rockingham estate three times and could not find this knife. Simpson told his attorneys exactly where it was in the house and it was promptly recovered.|$|E
500|$|In April 1996, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco {{ruled that}} state trial <b>judge</b> <b>Ito</b> {{had given the}} jury faulty {{instructions}} [...] about the law regarding fraud. The conviction was overturned. In December 1996, the same Court of Appeals ruled {{that some of the}} jurors in the federal case might have been influenced by their knowledge and discussion {{of the results of the}} state case, and threw out the federal conviction. Keating was freed after 4½ years in prison; he later said that staying tough during his incarceration was the thing he was proudest of. He was said to have gotten along well with other prisoners and served as best man at weddings for some that he met there.|$|E
25|$|Veteran LAPD detective Tom Lange led {{the murder}} investigation. The {{prosecution}} {{decided not to}} {{seek the death penalty}} and instead sought a life sentence. The TV exposure made celebrities of many of the figures in the trial, including the presiding <b>judge,</b> Lance <b>Ito.</b>|$|R
50|$|Like {{many critics}} of the prosecution, Fuhrman felt that <b>Judge</b> Lance <b>Ito</b> allowed the defense to control the trial. For instance, like Bugliosi, Fuhrman insists that {{relevant}} case law demanded that Ito forebear the defense from asking him about racial slurs, because {{of the possibility of}} prejudice to the prosecution's case.|$|R
40|$|If juries are {{to bring}} in just {{verdicts}} in criminal trials, {{they need to understand}} the criminal standard of proof – beyond reasonable doubt – and apply it to the evidence they have heard in court. Yet courts have been notoriously ineffective in communicating that standard to lay jurors. This paper locates the problem not so much in specific wordings as in the entire paradigm of ‘instruction as legal text’ under which courts have tended to operate. After illustrating the effects of this paradigm on <b>Judge</b> <b>Ito’s</b> instruction in the O. J. Simpson criminal trial, the paper calls for a paradigm shift. It thus reinterprets the criminal standard as a communicative act, beginning with the message to be conveyed, some necessary conditions for conveying that message to the jury, {{and the role of the}} judge in delivering the message. The paper concludes with some recommendations for communicating the standard of proof instruction effectively...|$|R
2500|$|During {{the middle}} of the trial a number of the jurors staged what the media called a [...] "revolt." [...] After being sequestered for 101 days, 13 of the 18 jurors refused to enter the {{courtroom}} until they were granted a meeting with <b>Judge</b> <b>Ito.</b> Eventually, the jury returned with 13 members wearing black or dark-colored clothing in what was described as a [...] "funeral procession." ...|$|E
2500|$|Former NFL {{player and}} pastor Rosey Grier visited Simpson at the Los Angeles County Jail {{in the days}} {{following}} the murders. A jailhouse guard, Jeff Stuart, testified to <b>Judge</b> <b>Ito</b> that at one point Simpson yelled to Grier that he [...] "didn't mean to do it," [...] after which Grier had urged Simpson to come clean. Ito ruled that the evidence was hearsay and could not be allowed in court.|$|E
2500|$|Simpson's defense {{sought to}} show that one or more hit men hired by drug dealers had murdered Brown and Goldman—giving both [...] "Colombian neckties"—because {{they were looking for}} Brown's friend, Faye Resnick, a known cocaine user who had failed to pay for her drugs. However, <b>Judge</b> <b>Ito</b> barred {{testimony}} about Resnick's drug use. She had stayed for several days at Brown's condominium until entering drug rehabilitation four days before the killings. Ito stated that the defense had failed to provide sufficient direct or circumstantial evidence that the scenario was possible, indicating: [...] "I find that the offer of proof regarding motive to be highly speculative." [...] Consequently, he prohibited Christian Reichardt from testifying about the drug problem of Resnick, his former girlfriend.|$|E
5000|$|Outside of broadcasting, Ono has {{produced}} several documentaries chronicling the Asian American and immigrant experience, such the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II and Phan Thi Kim Phuc, the [...] "Napalm girl" [...] from the Vietnam War.

50|$|Bugliosi wrote a bestselling book, Outrage: The Five Reasons Why O.J. Simpson Got Away with Murder, on the {{acquittal}} of O.J. Simpson for {{the murders}} of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Lyle Goldman. Bugliosi argues Simpson's guilt and criticizes {{the work of the}} district attorney, prosecutors, defense lawyers, and <b>Judge</b> Lance <b>Ito.</b> He criticized the media for characterizing Simpson's lawyers as the Dream Team, arguing the lawyers were unremarkable and of average ability. He uses these profiles to illustrate broader problems in American criminal justice, the media, and the political appointment of judges.|$|R
50|$|Evidence was {{presented}} that a Colombian necktie, a variation where the executed {{are killed by}} a horizontal slash at the throat and the tongue is drawn through the wound, is often employed by Colombian drug dealers. <b>Judge</b> <b>Ito</b> barred this admission of testimony.|$|E
5000|$|As General Counsel for the Radio and Television News Association of Southern California {{since the}} 1990s, Oakes has {{appeared}} in court on numerous occasions to urge judges to allow or continue televised coverage of court proceedings.2 During the O.J. Simpson criminal trial held before the Honorable Lance Ito, Oakes appeared {{in an attempt to}} dissuade <b>Judge</b> <b>Ito</b> from making good on a threat to “pull the plug” on cameras {{as a result of the}} perceived “media circus” atmosphere. In the book Cameras In The Courtroom: Television and the Pursuit of Justice (1998), authors Marjorie Cohn and David Dow stated at page 82 that “Also pleading with <b>Judge</b> <b>Ito</b> to retain the camera in Simpson’s trial was media attorney Royal Oakes, who argued, the camera ‘is a perfectly accurate reflection of reality.’” ...|$|E

Yet, although he has remained active professionally, and the name got reexposed in the 1990s due to <b>judge</b> Lance <b>Ito's</b> presiding over the O. J.

50|$|McGhee {{was raised}} in the {{neighborhood}} of Atwater Village, a lower middle class area of Los Angeles consisting of 1.78 square miles just north of downtown Los Angeles along Interstate 5 adjacent to Glendale, California. Actor Leonardo DiCaprio, born the year after McGhee, grew up in the neighborhood. <b>Judge</b> Lance <b>Ito,</b> who presided over the O.J. Simpson murder trial, and Michelle Phillips, member of The Mamas & the Papas, both attended John Marshall High School there.

50|$|Protagonist Gus Bailey, {{introduced}} in Dunne's earlier novel People Like Us, {{is a successful}} writer who is assigned to cover the Simpson trial for Vanity Fair. He firmly believes Simpson is guilty from the very beginning, and in his monthly column Letter from Los Angeles, he clearly states his position and puts his personal spin on what he observes in the courtroom and beyond. Those involved with the criminal proceedings, including Marcia Clark and Christopher Darden for the prosecution, Johnnie Cochran, F. Lee Bailey, Robert Kardashian, Barry Scheck, and Robert Shapiro for the defense, and <b>Judge</b> Lance <b>Ito,</b> all figure prominently in the story.|$|R

Then imagine that the prosecutors refused to do so. And that, instead of being fined for contempt of court (or thrown in jail themselves), these same prosecutors somehow got their boss to get Ito tossed off the bench. And then the D.A.'s office worked {{behind the scenes to}} replace Ito with a more, shall we say, compliant judge." ...|$|R
50|$|The abrasive, pugnacious D'Amato {{was another}} matter entirely. Since his narrow victory in 1992, his profile had grown more {{partisan}} Republican in this still-Democratic state. Summoning First Lady Hillary Clinton to testify before his Senate committee in 1995, and aggressive campaigning for Dole in 1996, damaged D'Amato {{in a state where}} Bill Clinton crushed the Kansan by nearly 2-to-1 (59.5% to 30.6%), doubling his 1992 margin over Bush. D'Amato's decision to divorce his wife after a long separation and announce his engagement to a young socialite was no help, and others recalled his mock-Japanese impression of O.J. Simpson case <b>Judge</b> Lance <b>Ito</b> in 1995 (for which he was forced to apologize on the Senate floor).|$|R
50|$|A senior boxing {{official}} {{was quoted as}} saying that there is deep-rooted corruption in Olympic boxing, which led to controversial decisions.“As predicted, corruption is alive and well and the decisions speak for themselves.

It is time now for the IOC to step in,” the senior official told the Guardian, adding that amateur boxing is so rotten that only the removal of Wu, his administration and all of the officials at the Olympics could cut it out.“President Wu needs to resign, as well as the executive director and the senior staff. Every RJ and <b>judge</b> and <b>ITO</b> technical official needs to be suspended. That’s the only way it’s going to change,” the official said.|$|R
50|$|On August 31, <b>Judge</b> <b>Ito</b> {{ruled that}} {{evidence}} could {{be introduced to}} prove that Fuhrman had lied about {{use of the word}} nigger, but that claims of violence and police misconduct were inadmissible. On September 5, the defense produced multiple witnesses and audiotape to establish that Fuhrman had used the word nigger within the last 10 years. The audiotape eventually resulted in a perjury charges brought against Fuhrman, to which he pleaded no contest.|$|E
