2500|$|Most {{vineyards}} {{planted on}} the hills around Sancerre are on south facing slopes at altitudes between 655-1,310 feet (200–400 meters). The soils around the area can be roughly classified into three categories. The far western reaches heading towards Menetou-Salon have [...] "white" [...] soils with clay and limestone. Around the village of Chavignol (considered a cru of Sancerre), the soil also includes some Kimmeridgian marl. Wines from these western reaches {{tend to have more}} body and power in their <b>flavour</b> <b>profile.</b> Heading closer to the city of Sancerre the soil picks up more gravel mixed with the limestone and tends to produce more light bodied wines with delicate perfumes. The third classification of soil is found around the city of Sancerre itself which includes many deposits of flint (also known as silex) that add distinctive mineral components. These wines tend to be heavily perfumed with the longest aging potential of Sancerres.|$|E

Qualitative descriptive analysis (QDA) was used to assess the organoleptic impact of the different melons and the sensory data were correlated with the chemical analysis. There were significant, consistent and substantial differences between the mature and immature fruit for the medium shelf-life genotype, the less mature giving a green, cucumber character and lacking the sweet, fruity character of the mature fruit. However, maturity at harvest had a much smaller impact on the long shelf-life melons and fewer differences were detected.

40|$|This study {{provides}} innovative {{information on the}} simultaneous use of Limousin oak and chestnut wood in the ageing of wine brandy. Ageing was performed in 650 -L wooden barrels and in 3000 -L stainless steel tanks with staves over a 2 -year period. Effect of both kinds of wood in the brandy features depended on the ageing technology. Stainless steel tanks with staves originated lower enrichment of the brandy in dry extract (0. 89 vs. 1. 25 g L− 1), total phenolics (22. 33 vs. 29. 40) and low molecular weight extractable compounds (119. 83 vs. 231. 65 mg L− 1), but promoted a faster evolution of the analytical colour (lower L*, higher C*, a* and b*) and sensory colour (topaz and greenish vs. golden). The aroma and <b>flavour</b> <b>profiles</b> of the brandy were not significantly influenced by the ageing technology.

2500|$|While the {{parentage}} of Ciliegiolo and Calabrese Montenuovo for Sangiovese {{was established}} based on 50 genetic markers and is generally accepted by ampelographers, some wine texts publish contradictory information that Ciliegiolo is an offspring (rather than parent) of Sangiovese. This belief {{is based on}} a 2007 study of 38 genetic markers stating that suggested that Ciliegiolo was the product of Sangiovese crossing with an obscure Portuguese wine grape, Muscat Rouge de Madère, that was once grown on the island of Madeira as well as the Douro and Lisboa wine regions of Portugal. In addition to support of fewer genetic markers, this alternative theory is disputed by geneticists such as José Vouillamoz and Masters of Wine like Jancis Robinson because Muscat Rouge de Madère has no history of ever being cultivated in Italy (where it could have crossed with Sangiovese). Furthermore, while many grapes with lineage involving members of the Muscat family of grapes tend to have pronounced [...] "grapey" [...] flavours characteristic of Muscat grapes, Ciliegiolo exhibits none of those <b>flavour</b> <b>profiles</b> which makes it unlikely to be an offspring of Muscat Rouge de Madère.|$|R

40|$|In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, {{branched-chain}} {{amino acid}} transaminases (BCAAT ases) are encoded by the BAT 1 and BAT 2 genes. BCAATases catalyse {{the transfer of}} amino groups between those amino acids and α-keto-acids, α-Keto-acids are precursors for the biosynthesis of higher alcohols, which significantly influence the aroma and flavour of yeast-derived fermentation products. The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the influence of BAT-gene expression on general yeast physiology, on aroma and flavour compound formation and on the sensory characteristics of wines and distillates. For this purpose, the genes were overexpressed and deleted in a laboratory strain, BY 4742, and overexpressed in an industrial wine yeast strain, VIN 13. The data show that, with the exception of a slow growth phenotype observed for the BAT 1 deletion strain, the fermentation behaviour of the strains was unaffected by the modifications. The chemical and sensory analysis of fermentation products revealed a strong correction between BAT gene expression and the formation of many aroma compounds. The data suggest that the adjustment of BAT gene expression could play an important role in assisting winemakers in their endeavour to produce wines with specific <b>flavour</b> <b>profiles.</b> © 2006 Federation of European Microbiological Societies Published by Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

40|$|Immobilised-cell fermentors offer great {{benefits}} {{compared to}} traditional free-cell systems. However, {{a major problem}} is unbalanced flavour production when these fermentors are used {{for the production of}} alcoholic beverages. One of the keys to obtaining better control over flavour formation may be the concentration of dissolved CO 2, which has inhibitory effects on yeast growth and metabolism. This article demonstrates that the presence of immobilisation matrices facilitates the removal of CO 2 from the liquid medium, which results in a low level of dissolved CO 2 during fermentation. Moreover, the formation of volatile higher alcohols and esters was greatly enhanced in the immobilised-cell system when compared to the free cell system. By sparging a CO 2 flow (45 ml/min) into the immobilised-cell system, cell growth was reduced by 10 - 30 % during the active fermentation stage, while the fermentation rate was unaffected. The uptake of branched-chain amino acids was reduced by 8 - 22 %, and the formation of higher alcohols and esters was reduced on average by 15 % and 18 %, respectively. The {{results of this study suggest}} that mismatched <b>flavour</b> <b>profiles</b> with immobilised-cell systems can be adjusted by controlling the level of dissolved CO 2 during fermentation with immobilised yeast. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Fruit beers, {{appreciated}} worldwide, {{represent a}} small but rising segment in the Belgian beer export, amounting to a volume which should not be underestimated. This fruit beer ‘kriek’ is a school example of beer mixed drinks and originally kriek is produced by addition of fresh sour cherries to mid-young lambic beer (spontaneous fermentation). The traditional kriek beer is less fruity and more acid. As fresh sour cherries are limited available, and due to a trend towards sweeter beers, commercial kriek beers are nowadays often sweetened and prepared by use of cherry juice and aroma, which can be entirely or partly substituted by colourings and flavourings, resulting {{in a wide variety}} of fruit beers. Forced by the international trade and increasing competition with other beers, this study is to aim at a detailed characterisation of a number of kriek beers to bear mutual comparison or comparison with other beverages. Based on the resulting data matrix, great diversification is noticed between the commercial kriek beers investigated in this study. The characterisation of the Belgian kriek beers is performed by analytical <b>flavour</b> <b>profiling,</b> including higher alcohols, ethyl esters, acetate esters and aldehydes, by headspace solid phase microextraction in combination with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (HS-SPME-GC-MS), and by quantitative determination of the bittering profiles, organic acids and sugars by high pressure liquid chromatography.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{evaluate}} the sensory profile and acceptability of six types of fufu (a fermented cassava product) produced by different processes using sensory evaluation and consumer acceptability testing. Fufu samples were selected to evaluate the acceptability of dried fufu flours, which are increasingly being consumed, and compare with a traditional paste and a newly developed paste that produces less environmental waste. Descriptive sensory profiles of the selected samples demonstrated distinct differences in sensory profiles. They were evaluated for consumer acceptance at three demographic locations; Lagos (n = 91), Ibadan (n = 121) and Abeokuta (n = 99), Nigeria. Fufu made from a paste that produced less environmental waste had the highest acceptance scores, followed by flour and paste made by the traditional method and finally the remaining flours. Average consumer liking between the three locations did not differ. Three distinct consumer segments were identified and the number of consumers in these segments differed between the locations. Consumers differentiated fufu made from pastes and from flour. Internal preference mapping indicated that consumers associated the flours with sensory attributes such as sticky texture and raw cassava odour, while pastes were associated with soft texture, and shiny and creamy appearance. Fufu acceptance varies widely among consumers and is related to preferences for distinct fufu <b>flavour</b> <b>profiles.</b> Correlations between consumer acceptance scores and sensory scores appeared to be non-linear for many attributes but a larger sample size of fufu samples would be necessary to confirm this. The implications of these finding are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Alcohol is {{fundamental}} {{to the character of}} wine, yet too much can put a wine off-balance. A wine is regarded to be well balanced if its alcoholic strength, acidity, sweetness, fruitiness and tannin structure complement each other so that no single component dominates on the palate. Balancing a wine's positive fruit flavours with the optimal absolute and relative concentration of alcohol can be surprisingly difficult. Over the past three decades, consumers have increasingly demanded wine with richer and riper fruit <b>flavour</b> <b>profiles.</b> In response, grape and wine producers have extended harvest times to increase grape maturity and enhance the degree of fruit flavours and colour intensity. However, a higher degree of grape maturity results in increased grape sugar concentration, which in turn results in wines with elevated alcohol concentration. On average, the alcohol strength of red wines from many warm wine-producing regions globally rose by about 2 % (v/v) during this period. Notwithstanding that many of these 'full-bodied, fruit-forward' wines are well balanced and sought after, there is also a significant consumer market segment that seeks lighter styles with less ethanol-derived 'hotness' on the palate. Consumer-focussed wine producers are developing and implementing several strategies in the vineyard and winery to reduce the alcohol concentration in wines produced from well-ripened grapes. In this context, Saccharomyces cerevisiae wine yeasts have proven to be a pivotal strategy to reduce ethanol formation during the fermentation of grape musts with high sugar content (>  240  g l⁻¹). One of the approaches has been to develop 'low-alcohol' yeast strains which work by redirecting their carbon metabolism away from ethanol production to other metabolites, such as glycerol. This article reviews the current challenges of producing glycerol at the expense of ethanol. It also casts new light on yeast strain development programmes which, bolstered by synthetic genomics, could potentially overcome these challenges. 15 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Considerable {{knowledge}} has been accumulated on the biochemical processes occurring during the ripening of cheese, which have in turn major consequences on flavour development. The <b>flavour</b> <b>profiles</b> of cheeses {{are complex and}} are variety specific. According to the ‘component balance’ theory, the flavour of cheese {{is the result of}} the correct balance of a wide variety of volatile flavour compounds originating from the degradation of milk constituents during ripening. Primary degradation of milk constituents leads to a whole range of flavour precursor compounds which are followed by a concerted series of secondary catabolic reactions that result in the formation of a variety of volatile compounds. Only some of the compounds formed directly contribute to cheese flavour. The formation of flavour compounds is mainly dependent on the enzymatic potentials of the microflora, their autolytic abilities and physiological states as well as on the manufacturing process, coagulant and indigenous milk enzymes. Some factors limiting the formation of flavour compounds have been recently identified. The availability of improved sensory and volatile instrumentation methodologies for the analysis of volatiles have aided our understanding and characterisation of cheese flavour. The analysis of the volatile profile of cheeses relies heavily on the extraction technique used (DHS, SHS, SPME, Thermal desorption, ITEX, HS-trap) as well as the sensitivity of the detectors. The use of GC-olfactometry to identify the odour activity of separated compounds has also served to improve our understanding of the contribution of individual compounds to the perception of flavour. However, to fully elucidate cheese flavour, descriptive sensory analysis should be conducted in tandem. New perspectives offered by analytical developments in -omic approaches can lead to a better knowledge of the potentials of micro-organisms (genome sequence), their global activity and physiology in cheese under starvation or at cold temperature (transcriptomics, flow cell cytometry, release of stress proteins observed by proteomics...|$|R
