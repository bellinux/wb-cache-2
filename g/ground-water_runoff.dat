40|$|Estimates {{of annual}} {{ground-water}} contribution to streamflow in 38 drainage basins of Minnesota {{by use of}} standard streamflow hydrograph separation methods permit determination of relations between <b>ground-water</b> <b>runoff</b> and such basin characteristics as geologic environment, precipitation and temperature, and percentage of lake and wetland cover. Generalized conclusions derived from {{analysis of the data}} are that <b>ground-water</b> <b>runoff</b> is (1) least from glaciated basins that have surficial lake bed sediments or gray-drift ground moraine immediately underlain by relatively impermeable bedrock and (2) greatest from glaciated basins that have surficial depos its immediately underlain by permeable bedrock or that have thick surficial loess deposits immediately underlain by permeable bedrock. <b>Ground-water</b> <b>runoff</b> is much greater from glaciated basins having red drift than from basins having gray drift. The rate of ground-water increases as annual precipitation increases. Lakes and wetlands sustain and regulate streamflow during rainless periods; if they were absent sustained streamflow from northern parts of the state would be greatly reduced. Recharge to aquifers in the state is difficult to ascertain. Because many aquifers are deeply buried by glacial materials of varying characteristics, not all <b>ground-water</b> <b>runoff</b> can be diverted into cones of depression, for there is some lateral as well as vertical movement of water in surficial deposits. Data on <b>ground-water</b> <b>runoff</b> can be useful in estimating the rate of recharge to aquifers and in evaluating the potential yields of ground-water reservoirs. However, no simple re- 1 ation exists between <b>ground-water</b> <b>runoff</b> and ground-water recharge or the potential yields of aquifers. Studies of basin characteristics were handicapped {{because of a lack of}} detailed geologic information. Collection and study of data intended to describe the dimensions and water -yielding properties of unconsolidated deposits in the basins of the state are urgently needed to support hydrologic studies involving ground-water development and management decisions...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{attempts}} to analyse some hydrological {{data from the}} small-scaled drainage area in the Mie University Forests, and to propose a simple system of quantitative description of runoff characteristics. The main poins of discussion are summarized as follows : Results of the multiple regression analysis on several runoff variables show that time lags of the runoff procedure correlate more highly with an antecedent precipitation accumulated through a pre-week, a maximum precipitation and its peak position within the duration. It is {{also pointed out that}} a peak discharge is remarkably affected by a maximum precipitation. In the application of filter-separation autoregressive method (AR-method) to inverse estimates for precipitation, some important properties of precipitation for identifying a subsurface-surface and a <b>ground-water</b> <b>runoff</b> could be fairly explained. In conclusion, it appears that for recognizing runoff components and for assessing the discharge, the proposed techniques seem to be valid and useful...|$|E
40|$|The hydrologic system {{responsible}} for the perennial flow of Aravaipa Creek in southeastern Arizona consists of a basin filled with sediments and ground water. Ground-water flow through the basin sediments converges {{at the entrance of}} Aravaipa Canyon where much of it is forced to the surface due to a restriction in the cross-sectional area of the unindurated sediments. By applying Darcy's law, these sediments are found to have a hydraulic conductivity of up to 1, 300 feet/day. The data used in the analysis show that Aravaipa Creek attains its full discharge within 2 miles of the canyon entrance due to a gradual reduction in the transmissivity of the sediments. Precipitation over the watershed is divided quantitatively into evapotranspiration, stream discharge, and pumpage. Ten years of streamflow data divided into base flow and storm runoff show that 8, 500 acrefeet/ year become base flow due to <b>ground-water</b> <b>runoff</b> from the valley aquifer. Recharge in the Aravaipa aquifer equals discharge. The discharge, Aravaipa Creek base flow plus pumpage, is 11, 600 acre-feet/year, or 2. 4 percent of total precipitation. Streamflow statistics, water quality, and current water use are documented, and suggestions for further research are made...|$|E
40|$|A Professional Project Report {{prepared}} in partial {{fulfillment of the}} requirements For the Degree of Master of Water Resources Administration, Water Resources Program, The University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, New Mexico, June 2000 The village of Seven Springs, New Mexico, lies north of Fenton Lake in {{the valley of the}} Rio Cebolla in the Jemez Mountains of northern New Mexico. The valley is funnel shaped [...] narrowest downstream [...] with homes most densely packed {{at the bottom of the}} funnel. It is typical of many small communities scattered throughout the state in that residents rely on private wells for drinking water and on individual septic systems for disposal of household waste. The current population in the village and the valley is light [...] about 50 permanent residents swelling to about 100 during the summer months. However, increased development of the valley is likely resulting in more permanent and seasonal residents. Ground water in the valley is shallow, ranging in depth from five to forty feet, and the threat to ground-water quality from increased development is high. To assess current and projected impacts to ground water from septic systems, water was sampled from wells at eleven homes, from two springs from which people obtain water, and from the Rio Cebolla above and below the village. Ground and surface waters were analyzed for major ions, metals, nutrients, volatile organic compounds, and coliforms. Coliform bacteria were found in Cebolla Spring, Hatchery Spring, and the Rio Cebolla. Water from Cebolla Spring tested positive for total coliform bacteria and water from the Hatchery Spring and the Rio Cebolla tested positive for both fecal and total coliforms. Residents who participated in the study were cautioned to avoid drinking water from the springs and the river. The ground water in the valley is of good quality with hardness under 37 mg/L (2. 2 grains), total dissolved solids content less than 200 mg/L, nitrate at 0. 2 mg/L or less and no coliforms or elevated metals. No detectable impact was found from the old gas station located in the village. There are some areas where anoxic conditions exist and at least one resident complained of rusty water with an odor of rotten-eggs. However, it was not determined if these conditions are the direct result of septic system discharge. Increased development may, however, adversely impact ground-water quality in the valley. Construction of a simple hydro geologic model shows that the septic discharge from only 46 homes with 127 year-round residents in the valley may be enough to increase nitrate levels in shallow ground water at the bottom of the valley to 5 mg/L [...] half of the <b>ground-water</b> standard. <b>Runoff</b> from farming and grazing operations has likely contaminated the river and Fenton Lake with excessive nutrients. Additionally, an increase in population may bring more people into contact with spring and river water, which were been found to be contaminated with coliform bacteria...|$|R
