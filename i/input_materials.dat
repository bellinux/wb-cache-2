25|$|Combustion of syngas or derived fuels emits {{exactly the}} same amount of carbon dioxide as would have been emitted from direct {{combustion}} of the initial fuel. Biomass gasification and combustion could {{play a significant role in}} a renewable energy economy, because biomass production removes {{the same amount of}} CO2 from the atmosphere as is emitted from gasification and combustion. While other biofuel technologies such as biogas and biodiesel are carbon neutral, gasification in principle may run on a wider variety of <b>input</b> <b>materials</b> and can be used to produce a wider variety of output fuels.|$|E

2500|$|Feedstocks {{can include}} {{biodegradable}} waste materials, such as waste paper, grass clippings, leftover food, sewage, and animal waste. Woody wastes are the exception, {{because they are}} largely unaffected by digestion, as most anaerobes are unable to degrade lignin. Xylophalgeous anaerobes (lignin consumers) or using high temperature pretreatment, such as pyrolysis, {{can be used to}} break down the lignin. Anaerobic digesters can also be fed with specially grown energy crops, such as silage, for dedicated biogas production. In Germany and continental Europe, these facilities are referred to as [...] "biogas" [...] plants. A codigestion or cofermentation plant is typically an agricultural anaerobic digester that accepts two or more <b>input</b> <b>materials</b> for simultaneous digestion.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{two main}} methods of calculating VAT: the credit-invoice or invoice-based method, and the {{subtraction}} or accounts-based method. Using the credit-invoice method, sales transactions are taxed, with the customer informed of the VAT on the transaction, and businesses may receive a credit for VAT paid on <b>input</b> <b>materials</b> and services. The credit-invoice method is the most widely employed method, used by all national VATs except for Japan. Using the subtraction method, {{at the end of}} a reporting period, a business calculates the value of all taxable sales then subtracts the sum of all taxable purchases and the VAT rate is applied to the difference. The subtraction method VAT is currently only used by Japan, although subtraction method VATs, often using the name [...] "flat tax", have been part of many recent tax reform proposals by US politicians. With both methods, there are exceptions in the calculation method for certain goods and transactions, created for either pragmatic collection reasons or to counter tax fraud and evasion.|$|E

40|$|Material {{recycling}} systems support sustainable manufacturing by separating product and industrial waste streams into their valuable material components. The material {{performance of a}} separation system is critical as output quality directly affects output material value and its substitutability for new materials. Current prediction methods evaluate system performance based on fixed <b>input</b> <b>material</b> and separation performance data, however, separation process performance varies stochastically, affecting the material separation at each stage {{as well as the}} final output material quality. Variation in <b>input</b> <b>material</b> concentration also effects output material performance. This research develops aggregate models that consider the effects of this variability on system performance using Monte Carlo simulation. The resulting output material performance probability distributions suggest that system designs may be different when variation in individual process performance and <b>input</b> <b>material</b> composition is taken into account. These results inform the design of multi-stage separation systems that are robust to uncertainty and variability...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} experimental investigations on {{the perceived}} level of running reverberation in {{various types of}} monophonic audio signals. The design and results of three listening tests are discussed. The tests focus {{on the influence of}} the <b>input</b> <b>material,</b> the direct-to-reverberation ratio, and the reverberation time using artificially generated impulse responses for simulating the late reverberation. Furthermore, a comparison between mono and stereo reverberation is conducted. It can be observed that with equal mixing levels, the <b>input</b> <b>material</b> and the shape of the reverberation tail have a prominent effect on the perceived level. The results suggest that mono and stereo reverberation with identical reverberation times and mixing ratios are perceived as having equal level regardless of the material...|$|R
40|$|The {{applicability}} of the radiocarbon (C- 14) method for the quantification of the biogenic carbon fractions {{at different stages of}} the Synthetic Natural Gas (SNG) production process is demonstrated in this study. The C- 14 -based biogenic carbon fractions were determined in process flue gas and raw SNG and were 38 % and 89 % respectively, for a mixture of wood and fossil lignite with 75 +/- 3 % biogenic carbon as <b>input</b> <b>material.</b> The differences in biogenic carbon fractions between the <b>input</b> <b>material,</b> flue gas and raw SNG are caused by bio-fossil carbon partitioning during the SNG production process. This study demonstrates that the main bio-fossil carbon partitioning took place during the gasification of the <b>input</b> <b>material.</b> This is due to the large differences in volatility and char content of the wood and lignite materials. For the determination, verification or certification of the biogenic carbon fraction in process flue gas and (raw) SNG in the SNG production process, separate investigations of the gases are inevitable. The C- 14 method is a useful and reliable independent method for these purposes. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

50|$|The {{digestion}} {{process begins}} with bacterial hydrolysis of the <b>input</b> <b>materials.</b> Insoluble organic polymers, such as carbohydrates, are broken down to soluble derivatives that become available for other bacteria. Acidogenic bacteria then convert the sugars and amino acids into carbon dioxide, hydrogen, ammonia, and organic acids. These bacteria convert these resulting organic acids into acetic acid, along with additional ammonia, hydrogen, and carbon dioxide. Finally, methanogens convert these products to methane and carbon dioxide. The methanogenic archaea populations play an indispensable role in anaerobic wastewater treatments.|$|E

50|$|Digital {{manufacturing}} is {{an integrated}} approach to manufacturing that is centered around a computer system.

Overall, digital manufacturing can be seen sharing the same goals as computer-integrated manufacturing (CIM), flexible manufacturing, lean manufacturing, and design for manufacturability (DFM). The main difference is that digital manufacturing was evolved for use in the computerized world.|$|E
50|$|The {{experience}} of reverse engineering FOGBANK produced some improvements in scientific {{knowledge of the}} process. The new production scientists noticed that certain problems in production resembled those noted by the original team. These problems were traced to a particular impurity in the final product that was required to meet quality standards. A root cause investigation showed that <b>input</b> <b>materials</b> were subject to cleaning processes that had not existed during the original production run. This cleaning removed a substance that generated the required impurity. With the implicit role of this substance finally understood, the production scientists can control output quality better than during the original run.|$|E
5000|$|Possible {{military}} {{applications of}} nanotechnology {{have been suggested}} {{in the fields of}} soldier enhancement (http://web.mit.edu/ISN/) and chemical weapons amongst others.

40|$|Both ORIGEN-S and SOURCES {{generate}} thick-target neutron {{yields and}} energy spectra from ({alpha},n) reactions in homogeneous materials. SOURCES calculates yield and spectra for any material containing {alpha}-emitting and ({alpha},n) target elements by simulating reaction physics, using {alpha}-emission energy spectra, elemental stopping cross sections, ({alpha},n) cross sections for target nuclei, and branching fractions to produce-nuclide energy levels. This methodology results in accurate yield and spectra. ORIGEN-S has two options for calculating yields and spectra. The UO{sub 2 } option (default) estimates yields and spectra assuming the input {alpha}-emitters to be infinitely dilute in UO{sub 2 }. The borosilicate-glass option estimates yields {{from the total}} <b>input</b> <b>material</b> composition and generates spectra purportedly representative of spectra generated by {sup 238 }Pu, {sup 241 }Am, {sup 242 }Cm, and {sup 244 }Cm infinitely dilute in borosilicate glass, even if none of these four {alpha}-emitters {{are present in the}} <b>input</b> <b>material</b> composition. Because yields from the borosilicate-glass option in ORIGEN-S are based on entire <b>input</b> <b>material</b> composition and are reasonably accurate, the same is often assumed to be true for spectra. The input/output functionality of the borosilicate-glass option, along with ambiguity in ORIGEN-S documentation, gives the incorrect impression that spectra representative of input compositions are generated. This impression is reinforced by wide usage of the SCALE code system and its ORIGEN-S module and their sponsorship by the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission...|$|R
