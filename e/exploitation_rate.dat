Nonetheless the Commission also needs to manage the risk of adverse impacts on dependent and related populations which might occur if fishing is concentrated in sensitive areas. Advances are needed to improve management of krill fisheries to manage these risks and to ensure that management is robust to the potential impacts of climate change.

30|$|One {{possible}} explanation for the rising <b>exploitation</b> <b>rates</b> is that social insurance dependency is “contagious”, e.g., because it becomes less stigmatizing to be a benefit recipient when recipiency is already widespread.

Despite methodological difficulties, there is now convincing evidence that such multiplier effects are empirically important (Bertrand et al. 2000; Ichino and Maggi, 2000; Aizer and Currie, 2004; Hesselius et al. 2009; Åslund and Fredriksson, 2009; Rege et al. 2012; Markussen and Røed, 2012).

However, model estimates often demonstrate poor precision. A multiple-year IR model (1 qIR) was developed to improve the precision of model estimates. Both the multiple-year and single-year models were applied to simulated data to compare model performance over a range of exploitation rates, and to test 1 qIR model robustness to failure of the assumption of constant catchability over all years. Both models were then applied to data from a southern rock lobster fishery in Tasmania, Australia.

40|$|Research PaperFisheries affect {{fish stocks}} through their <b>{{exploitation}}</b> <b>rate</b> and exploitation pattern. Both influence the economic yield from the fish stock. In regulated fisheries, the <b>exploitation</b> <b>rate</b> is determined {{either by the}} acceptable level of fishing effort or catch, whereas the exploitation pattern is determined by selectivity of gears and/or regulatory measures like closed areas, closed seasons and minimum catch and/or landing sizes. This paper describes the process of improving the exploitation pattern in the fishery for Northeast Arctic Saithe in Norway. The process was started in 1996 when the Norwegian Ministry of Fisheries requested the Directorate of Fisheries and the Institute of Marine Research to calculate the biological and economic consequences of increasing the minimum catch size in the fishery. Data on the biological characteristics of the fish stock, the selectivity of the various fishing gears and cost and earnings from the various fleet segments were collected. Using these data, the biological and economic consequences of increasing the minimum catch size on spawning stock biomass, catch and net economic revenue during a 10 -year period were calculated. Regional consequences for the fishermen were also described. The calculated consequences were written in a report sent to various interested parties.

40|$|Abstract. —We used {{computer}} simulation to examine potential yields and sustainable <b>exploitation</b> <b>rates</b> for white sturgeon Acipenser transmontanus {{in the lower}} Columbia River. Simulated yields varied with assumptions used for mortality, growth, and stock-recruitment relationship, and with size restrictions imposed on harvest. The stock-recruitment function had the greatest influence on our results. Maximum yields (sustained or at 100 years) ranged from 0. 2 to 2. 9 % of unexploited biomass. Maximum yields were produced with <b>exploitation</b> <b>rates</b> ranging from 0. 02 to 0. 20, and yields declined or collapsed at higher rates. Size restrictions (sport and commercial harvest of fish only between 92 and 183 cm or 122 and 183 cm, respectively) resulted in higher yields and higher supportable exploitation than no size restrictions. However, size windows did not prevent collapse of the fishery under higher <b>exploitation</b> <b>rates</b> when a stock-dependent recruitment function was used. The fishery on the Columbia River has expanded dramatically in recent time. Most recent yields were about 30 % of the peak yield realized when the stock was overfished before 1890, and were {{at least three times}} the sustained yields expected from our most optimistic simulations. Cultural development of the river could have reduced the productivity of the stock and made it vulnerable to overexploitation. The present fishery appears to be overexpanded. Current yields probably cannot be sustained, and current harvest risks eventual collapse of the fishery. Overexploitation of long-lived, relatively slow-growing fishes is a well-known problem (Ricker 1963; Adams 1980; Francis 1986). Expanding fisheries typically produce increasing yields in a "fishing-up " process (Ricker 1975) that cannot be sustained. Yields can decline dramatically, often to levels that represent {{a small fraction of the}} peak (Francis 1986). If the fishery expands beyond the effort producing maximum sustained yield (MSY), stocks can be quickly and seriously overfished. Recovery to a level supporting MSY can take man...|$|R

Using an ecosystem modelling approach, we explored the trade-offs between invertebrate catches and their impacts on the associated ecosystem on the south coast of Wellington, New Zealand. We simulated exploitation of lobster (Jasus edwardsii), abalone (Haliotis australis, H. iris), and sea urchin (Evechinus chloroticus) over a range of depletion levels-fromno depletion to local extinction-to estimate changes in target catches and associated effects on other species groups, trophic levels, and benthic and pelagic components.

In all three fisheries, the current <b>exploitation</b> <b>rate</b> exceeds that which produces maximum sustainable yield, with considerable ecosystem effects.

The theoretical age of C. nigrodigitatus (t 0) at length zero was estimated to - 0. 69 while the maximum age (or longevity, tmax) was estimated to 9. 09 year. The values of the total mortality coefficients (Z), natural mortality (M) and fishing mortality rate (F) as well as the <b>exploitation</b> <b>rate</b> (E) of C. nigrodigitatus were respectively 1. 79 year- 1, 0. 73 year- 1, 1. 73 year- 1, and 0, 59. This study shows that in the sector Potou of the Ebrié lagoon, C. nigrodigitatus is subjected to a fishing mortality (1. 73 year- 1) far superior to the natural mortality (0. 73 year- 1). Besides, C. nigrodigitatus is overfished with <b>exploitation</b> <b>rate</b> (E = 0. 59) superior to the maximal <b>exploitation</b> <b>rate</b> (Emax) to 0. 414...|$|E
40|$|Investigations {{have been}} carried out on the age, growth and {{mortality}} of sardine Sardinella longiceps based on the length frequency data. The hypothetical asymptotic length (L∞) and growth coefficient (K) were estimated as 220. 3 mm and 1. 209 yr- 1 respectively. The species grows from 155 and 200 mm at the end of 1 and 2 years of life. The life span appeared to be around 2 years of species life. The total (Z), natural (M) and fishing (F) mortalities were represented as 4. 11 yr- 1, 2. 21 yr- 1 and 1. 91 yr- 1 respectively. The <b>exploitation</b> <b>rate</b> (E) was 0. 46. The <b>exploitation</b> <b>rate</b> suggested that the stock was below the optimum level of exploitation. As a management plan, {{there is a need to}} increase the fishing scale and protecting spawning season to maintain sustainability over time...|$|E
50|$|This {{species was}} an {{important}} component of the cisco (chub) fishery in the Great Lakes. Competition and predation from rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax)and alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus), two introduced exotic fish species, have had a negative impact on shortjaw cisco populations. The cumulative effect of these factors, sea lamprey predation and habitat changes associated with urban, agricultural, and industrial activities in the Great Lakes Basin undoubtedly combined to make this species vulnerable to over-exploitation, even at <b>exploitation</b> <b>rates</b> that had once been sustainable.|$|R
40|$|The {{status of}} the gulf menhaden, Brevoortia patronus, fishery was {{assessed}} with purseseine landing data from 1946 to 1992 and port sampling data from 1964 to 1992. These data were analyzed to determine growth rates, biological reference points for fishing mortality from yield per recruit and maximum spawning potential analyses, spawner-recruit relationships, and maximum sustainable yield (MSY). Virtual population approaches were used to obtain point estimates of stock size, recruits to age I, spawning stock size, and fishing mortality <b>rates.</b> <b>Exploitation</b> <b>rates</b> ranged between 14...|$|R
30|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{determine}} the dynamics of the reproductive cycle along with the patterns of energy storage and utilization, in five Mytilus galloprovincialis populations from the Basque Country (SE Bay of Biscay). In a previous study, shellfish aquaculture had been experimentally tested in the open waters of the SE Bay of Biscay (Azpeitia et al. 2016). The present study focuses on reproductive cycle and nutrient storage, and it is considered necessary to assess both sustainable <b>exploitation</b> <b>rates</b> for this species and potential capacity for aquaculture production in the region.|$|R
