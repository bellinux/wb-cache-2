5|$|Malaria {{has several}} serious complications. Among {{these is the}} {{development}} of respiratory distress, which occurs in up to 25% of adults and 40% of children with severe P.falciparum malaria. Possible causes include respiratory compensation of metabolic acidosis, noncardiogenic pulmonary oedema, concomitant pneumonia, and severe anaemia. Although rare <b>in</b> <b>young</b> <b>children</b> with severe malaria, acute respiratory distress syndrome occurs in 5–25% of adults and up to 29% of pregnant women. Coinfection of HIV with malaria increases mortality. Renal failure is a feature of blackwater fever, where hemoglobin from lysed red blood cells leaks into the urine.|$|E
5|$|Antibiotics are {{not usually}} used for gastroenteritis, {{although}} they are sometimes recommended if symptoms are particularly severe or if a susceptible bacterial cause is isolated or suspected. If antibiotics are to be employed, a macrolide (such as azithromycin) is preferred over a fluoroquinolone due to higher rates {{of resistance to the}} latter. Pseudomembranous colitis, usually caused by antibiotic use, is managed by discontinuing the causative agent and treating it with either metronidazole or vancomycin. Bacteria and protozoans that are amenable to treatment include Shigella Salmonella typhi, and Giardia species. In those with Giardia species or Entamoeba histolytica, tinidazole treatment is recommended and superior to metronidazole. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the use of antibiotics <b>in</b> <b>young</b> <b>children</b> who have both bloody diarrhea and fever.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{treatment}} of gastroenteritis in {{both children and}} adults is rehydration. This is preferably achieved by drinking rehydration solution, although intravenous delivery may be required {{if there is a}} decreased level of consciousness or if dehydration is severe. Drinking replacement therapy products made with complex carbohydrates (i.e. those made from wheat or rice) may be superior to those based on simple sugars. Drinks especially high in simple sugars, such as soft drinks and fruit juices, are not recommended in children under 5 years of age as they may increase diarrhea. Plain water may be used if more specific ORT preparations are unavailable or the person is not willing to drink them. A nasogastric tube can be used <b>in</b> <b>young</b> <b>children</b> to administer fluids if warranted. In those who require intravenous fluids, one to four hours' worth is often sufficient.|$|E

5|$|The {{symptoms}} of the common cold {{are believed to be}} primarily related to the immune response to the virus. The mechanism of this immune response is virus specific. For example, the rhinovirus is typically acquired by direct contact; it binds to human ICAM-1 receptors through unknown mechanisms to trigger the release of inflammatory mediators. These inflammatory mediators then produce the symptoms. It does not generally cause damage to the nasal epithelium. The respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), on the other hand, is contracted by direct contact and airborne droplets. It then replicates in the nose and throat before frequently spreading to the lower respiratory tract. RSV does cause epithelium damage. Human parainfluenza virus typically results in inflammation of the nose, throat, and bronchi. <b>In</b> <b>young</b> <b>children</b> when it affects the trachea it may produce the {{symptoms of}} croup due to the small size of their airways.|$|E
25|$|There are {{a number}} of {{developmental}} theoretical accounts for this BPO pantomime proclivity <b>in</b> <b>young</b> <b>children.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the thesis is to {{determine}} which materials encourage language development during symbolic play, how often do children in the first age group engage in symbolic play, and how can the teacher influence speech development during this activity.

The empirical part of the thesis examines which material encourages symbolic play and thus speech development <b>in</b> <b>younger</b> <b>children,</b> and how the presence of the teacher influences the way children play. A survey questionnaire was employed to find that structured materials perform better in encouraging both symbolic play and speech development <b>in</b> <b>younger</b> <b>children.</b> If the teacher is present, symbolic play lasts longer and involves more verbal language. ...|$|R
50|$|Allergic {{rhinitis}} may be seasonal or perennial. Seasonal {{allergic rhinitis}} occurs in particular during pollen seasons. It does not usually develop until after 6 years of age.

30|$|Another {{important}} factor related to patient age is {{the location of}} the injury. Prior reports have demonstrated that SCIWORA <b>in</b> <b>younger</b> <b>children</b> occurs more commonly in the upper cervical spine, while SCIWORA in adolescents is more often located in the lower cervical and thoracic spine [1, 12, 13, 14, 15]. The patients in the present series showed significant variability in injury location based on age, with higher rates of upper cervical spine injuries <b>in</b> <b>younger</b> <b>children</b> and higher rates of lower cervical spine injuries in older children. No significant difference was found between the rates of thoracic and lumbar injuries. However, a statistically significant increase in unspecified level SCIWORA in older children was identified which may represent a confounding factor in the data.|$|R

40|$|Between 1940 and 2005, in the United States, {{the rate}} of unnatural death {{declined}} about 75 percent <b>in</b> infant and <b>young</b> <b>child</b> boys and girls; a remarkable indicator of successful child protection. During this same period, {{the rate of}} reported homicide in infant boys increased 64. 0 percent, in infant girls increased 43. 5 percent, <b>in</b> <b>young</b> <b>child</b> boys increased 333. 3 percent, and <b>in</b> <b>young</b> <b>child</b> girls increased 300. 0 percent, a dismal and disturbing indicator of failed child protection. Can these simultaneously encouraging and discouraging observations be reconciled? The four categories of unnatural death, homicide, suicide, motor vehicle accident (MVA), and non-MVA, are mutually exclusive classifications. Correlations between the four categories of unnatural death among U. S. men and woman in all age groups for the years 1940 through 2005 were calculated. A negative correlation between homicide and non-MVA death rates was shown for all age groups, encompassing the entire human lifespan, in both genders. This consistently observed negative correlation was only observed between homicide and non-MVA death rates, and was not demonstrated between other causes of unnatural deaths. Moreover, this negative correlation was strongest (less than − 0. 7) <b>in</b> infants and <b>young</b> <b>children.</b> These observations {{are consistent with the}} suggestion that as the rate of unnatural death <b>in</b> infants and <b>young</b> <b>children</b> dramatically declined, society gave greater scrutiny to those fewer occurring unnatural deaths and demonstrated an increasing propensity to assign blame for those fewer deaths...|$|R
