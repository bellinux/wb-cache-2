[...] "Saw Dr. Eller decomposing water into elastic air [or thinking he did so, 1743]; saw the Opera of TITUS, which is a masterpiece of music [by Friedrich himself, with the important aid of Graun]: it was, without vanity, a treat the King gave me, or rather gave himself; he wished I should see him in his glory.|$|E
6000|$|This much is certain: at Vienna, Maupertuis, {{prisoner}} on parole, glided {{about for}} some time in deep eclipse, till the Newspapers began babbling of him. He confessed then that he was Maupertuis, <b>Flattener</b> of the Earth; but for the rest, [...] "told rather a blind story about himself," [...] says Robinson; spoke {{as if he had}} been of the King's suite, [...] "riding with the King," [...] when that Hussar accident befell;--rather a blind story, true story being too sad. The Vienna Sovereignties, in the turn things had taken, were extremely kind; Grand-Duke Franz handsomely pulled out his own watch, hearing what road the Maupertuis one had gone; dismissed the Maupertuis, with that and other gifts, home:--to Brittany (not to Prussia), till times calmed for engrafting the Sciences.

60|$|Some {{four weeks}} after those Carrousel effulgencies, Perpetual President Maupertuis had a visit (September 21st, just while the Sun was {{crossing}} the Line; thanks to Formey for the date, who keeps a Note-book, useful in these intricacies): visit from Professor Konig, an effective mathematical man from the Dutch parts. Whom readers have forgotten again; though they saw him once: in violent quarrel, about the Infinitely Little, with Madame du Chatelet, Voltaire witnessing with pain;--it was just as they quitted Cirey together, ten years ago, for these new courses of adventure. Do readers recall the circumstance? Maupertuis, referee in that quarrel, had, with a bluntness offensive to the female mind, declared Konig indisputably in the right; and there had followed a dryness between the divine Emilie and the <b>Flattener</b> of the Earth, scarcely to be healed by Voltaire's best efforts.|$|E
6000|$|Voltaire too, in his way, is fond {{of these}} {{mathematical}} people; eager enough to fish for knowledge, here as in all elements, when he has the chance offered: this is much an interest of his at present. And he does attain sound ideas, outlines of ideas, in this province,--though privately defective in the due transcendency of admiration for it;--was wont to discuss cheerily with Konig, about VIS VIVA, monads, gravitation and the infinitely little; above all, bows to the ground before the red-wigged Bashaw, <b>Flattener</b> of the Earth, whom for Madame's sake and his own he is anxious to be well with. [...] "Fall on your face nine times, ye esoteric of only Impure Science!"--intimates Maupertuis to mankind. [...] "By all means!" [...] answers M. de Voltaire, doing it with alacrity; {{with a kind of}} loyalty, one can perceive, and also with a hypocrisy grounded on love of peace. If that {{is the nature of the}} Bashaw, and one's sole mode of fishing knowledge from him, why not? thinks M. de Voltaire. His patience with M. de Maupertuis, first and last, was very great. But we shall find it explode at length, a dozen years hence, in a conspicuous manner!-- ...|$|E
6000|$|Again: on Friedrich's birthday, 24th January, 1744, the new Academy of Sciences had, in the Schloss of Berlin, {{its first}} Session. But of this,--in {{the absence of}} Maupertuis, <b>Flattener</b> of the Earth, who is still in France, since that Mollwitz adventure; by and for behoof of whom, when he did return, and become [...] "Perpetual First President," [...] many changes were made,--I will not speak at present. Nor indeed afterwards, except on good chance rising;--the new Academy, with its Perpetual First President, being nothing like so sublime an object now, to readers and me, as it then was to itself and Perpetual President and Royal Patron! Vapid Formey is Perpetual Secretary; more power to him, as the Irish say. Poor Goldstick Pollnitz is an Honorary Member;--absent {{at this time in}} Baireuth, where those giggling Marwitzes of Wilhelmina's have been contriving a {{marriage}} for the old fool. Of which another word soon: if we have time. Time cannot be spent on those dim small objects: but there are two Marriages of a high order, of purport somewhat Historical; there is Barberina the Dancer, throwing a flash through the Operatic and some other provinces: let us restrict ourselves to these, and the like of these, and be brief upon them.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the amateur}} {{astronomy}} field {{there are many}} types of commercial and amateur built telescopes designed for astrophotography labeled [...] "astrographs". Optical designs of amateur astrographs vary widely but include apochromatic refractors, variations of Cassegrain reflectors including Ritchey-Chretien and Dall-Kirkham designs, or Newtonian reflectors. Most optical designs do not produce large, flat, and well-corrected imaging fields and therefore require some type of optical correction by way of field <b>flatteners</b> or coma correctors. Amateur astrographs typically have purpose-built focusers, are constructed of thermally stable materials like carbon fiber and are paired with heavy duty mounts to facilitate accurate tracking of deep sky objects {{for long periods of}} time.|$|R
6000|$|No reader guesses in {{our time}} what a shining {{celestial}} body the Maupertuis, who is now fallen so dim again, then was to mankind. In cultivated French society {{there is no such}} lion as M. Maupertuis since he returned from flattening the Earth in the Arctic regions. [...] "The Exact Sciences, what else is there to depend on?" [...] thinks French cultivated society: [...] "and has not Monsieur done a feat in that line?" [...] Monsieur, with fine ex-military manners, has a certain austere gravity, reticent loftiness and polite dogmatism, which confirms that opinion. A studious ex-military man,--was Captain of Dragoons once, but too fond of study,--who is conscious to himself, or who would fain be conscious, that he is, in all points, mathematical, moral and other, the man. A difficult man to live with in society. Comes really near the limit of what we call genius, of originality, poetic greatness in thinking;--but never once can get fairly over said limit, though always struggling dreadfully to do so. Think of it! A fatal kind of man; especially if you have made a lion of him at any time. Of his envies, deep-hidden splenetic discontents and rages, with Voltaire's return for them, there will be enough to say in the ulterior stages. He wears--at least ten years hence he openly wears, though I hope it is not yet so flagrant--"a red wig with yellow bottom (CRINIERE JAUNE);" [...] and as <b>Flattener</b> of the Earth, is, with his own flattish red countenance and impregnable stony eyes, a man formidable to look upon, though intent to be amiable if you do the proper homage.

50|$|The American {{astronomer}} and lens designer James Gilbert Baker {{first proposed}} a Cassegrain design for Bernhard Schmidt's Schmidt camera in 1940. The optical shop at Mount Wilson Observatory manufactured {{the first one}} during World War II {{as part of their}} research into optical designs for the military. As in the Schmidt camera, this design uses a spherical primary mirror and a Schmidt corrector plate to correct for spherical aberration. In this Cassegrain configuration the convex secondary mirror acts as a field <b>flattener</b> and relays the image through the perforated primary mirror to a final focal plane located behind the primary. Some designs include additional optical elements (such as field flatteners) near the focal plane. The first large telescope to use the design was the James Gregory Telescope of 1962 at the University of St Andrews.|$|E
50|$|Schmidt cameras {{have very}} {{strongly}} curved focal planes, thus requiring that the film, plate, or other detector be correspondingly curved. In {{some cases the}} detector is made curved; in others flat media is mechanically conformed {{to the shape of}} the focal plane through the use of retaining clips or bolts, or by the application of a vacuum. A field <b>flattener,</b> in its simplest form a planoconvex lens in front of the film plate or detector, is sometimes used. Since the corrector plate {{is at the center of}} curvature of the primary mirror in this design the tube length can be very long for a wide-field telescope. There are also the drawbacks of having the obstruction of the film holder or detector mounted at the focus halfway up the tube assembly, a small amount of light is blocked and there is a loss in contrast in the image due to diffraction effects of the obstruction and its support structure.|$|E

40|$|The MODS optical {{spectrograph}} uses a de-centered Maksutov-Schmidt {{camera with}} a clear aperture of ~ 300 mm. This large camera has two widely spaced elements, the corrector and the camera mirror, and a field <b>flattener</b> near the focal plane. This paper describes the truss system that supports the optical elements very rigidly, uses adjustable length links to provide a deterministic method for alignment of the optical elements, and uses material combinations which result in a camera with nearly zero focus shift due to changes in temperature.
