40|$|Dark <b>enclaves</b> rich in {{amphibole}} and biotite are {{ubiquitous in}} granitoid rocks and generally thought to represent fragments of mafic magmas, cumulates or restites. However, magmatic assimilation of metamorphic or sedimentary country rock can also form dark <b>enclaves.</b> To develop criteria for identifying dark <b>enclaves</b> of non-magmatic origin, we investigated dark <b>enclaves</b> from a complete spectrum of light (carbonate- or feldspar-rich) to dark (amphibole-rich, biotite-rich, or composite) <b>enclaves,</b> reflecting progressive thermal and chemical equilibration with host tonalite from the Domenigoni Valley pluton in the Peninsular Ranges Batholith, California. Metasedimentary dark <b>enclaves</b> {{have a number}} of major and trace element characteristics that overlap those of literature-compiled igneous dark <b>enclaves.</b> Comparison to modeled igneous differentiation paths shows metasedimentary <b>enclaves</b> can have anomalous CaO and K 2 O contents for a given SiO 2, but other major element systematics may not deviate noticeably from igneous differentiation trends. In addition, {{the fact that there are}} literature-compiled mafic <b>enclaves</b> trending towards high K 2 O and high CaO suggests that not all mafic <b>enclaves</b> are of igneous origin. While the majority of dark <b>enclaves</b> may not be metasedimentary, this work provides some criteria for identifying <b>enclaves</b> should a case of metasedimentary origin arise...|$|R
40|$|Thirty-eight new <b>enclaves</b> {{from the}} Vaca Muerta mesosiderite have been studied, and {{detailed}} SEM-petrography {{was carried out}} on fourteen of them. Three are coarse-grained gabbroic ilmenite-free <b>enclaves</b> consisting mainly of pigeonite (En_) and plagioclase, seven are fine- to medium-grained ilmenite-bearing <b>enclaves</b> (En_) with ophitic to granular texture, and four are breccias. The most important breccias are diogenitic monomict breccias (En_) and an olivine-orthopyroxenite monomict breccia (Fo_). Reduction-induced orthopyroxene commonly surrounds pigeonite grains in the ilmenite-free <b>enclaves,</b> and occurs rarely in the marginal parts of the ilmenite-bearing <b>enclaves.</b> Whitlockite forms from augite lamellae {{as a result of}} reduction, and the ilmenite-free <b>enclaves</b> have been enriched in P_ 2 O_ 5. Reduction of the ilmenite-free <b>enclaves</b> occurred in the parent body before mixing with Fe-Ni metal on the mesosiderite parent body. In the ilmenite-bearing <b>enclaves</b> reduction occurred on the mesosiderite parent body after Fe-Ni metal was mixed in. Thus, two stages of subsolidus reduction occurred in <b>enclaves.</b> Ilmenite and rutile occur in the ilmenite-bearing and diogenitic <b>enclaves,</b> and various subsolidus reaction textures of chromite, ilmenite, rutile and probably preexisting pseudobrookite are found. Al_ 2 O_ 3 -depleted chromite formed through the decomposition of Cr_ 2 O_ 3 -bearing ilmenite and pseudobrookite. Zircon and baddeleyite were also found in the ilmenite-bearing <b>enclaves,</b> and the latter is the first occurrence reported in mesosiderites. The ilmenite-bearing <b>enclaves</b> always contain baddeleyite, whereas ZrO_ 2 -bearing phases are hardly ever found in HED meteorites. The bulk compositions of the <b>enclaves</b> were analyzed, and found to be more SiO_ 2 -enriched than the HED meteorites. Highly SiO_ 2 -enriched ilmenite-bearing <b>enclaves</b> are especially common, and follow the Nuevo Laredo trend of the eucrites, whereas the other ilmenite-bearing <b>enclaves</b> follow the Stannern trend. The highly SiO_ 2 -enriched <b>enclaves</b> probably formed by fractional crystallization, whereas the other ilmenite-bearing <b>enclaves</b> formed through partial melting. The existence of the highly SiO_ 2 -enriched <b>enclaves</b> may partly explain the SiO_ 2 -rich nature of mesosiderites, in addition to the in situ reduction process. Our observations suggest that the parent body and the parental magmas of the <b>enclaves</b> in the mesosiderites were initially {{different from those of the}} HED meteorites...|$|R
50|$|The {{discourse}} surrounding ethnic <b>enclaves</b> {{has prompted}} debate among scholars in two related areas of thought.

5|$|The {{applicability}} {{of state and}} municipal alcohol laws on federal lands is a complex and partially unresolved legal issue that depends on whether the federal property is considered a federal <b>enclave,</b> what rights the state reserved when it granted the property to the federal government, and whether the law is criminal or civil.

5|$|As for King Leopold II's {{original}} {{designs for}} turning the expedition into a campaign into Sudan, the mutiny of Baron Dhanis' column had severely reduced the expedition's fighting power and {{made such a}} campaign impossible. Instead, Leopold's conquest of the Lado <b>Enclave</b> pleased the British government, at least initially, which welcomed any aid in their ongoing war with Mahdist Sudan. But frequent raids outside of Lado territory by Belgian forces based in Rejaf caused alarm and suspicion among British and French officials wary of Leopold's imperial ambitions. In 1910, {{following the death of}} the Belgian King in December 1909, British authorities reclaimed the Lado <b>Enclave</b> as per the Anglo-Congolese treaty signed in 1894, and added the territory to Anglo-Egyptian Sudan.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: <b>Enclaves</b> {{which are}} relicts of initial basic magma give {{important}} {{information on the}} origin and evolution of granitic magmas. The mafic microgranular <b>enclaves</b> from the l–type Kozak pluton are less than 1 m that are located at the margin of pluton and mostly less than 15 cm and are generally in sharp contact with the surrounding granodiorite. In some cases, several <b>enclaves</b> may occur close to each other, {{but they are not}} closely clustered to form swarms. Most of the <b>enclaves</b> are ellipsoidal in shape. The largest <b>enclaves</b> are less ellipsoidal with curved boundaries. The mafic microgranular <b>enclaves</b> contain same mineral species as the host granodiorite; however the proportions are different. In the mafic micragranular <b>enclaves</b> plagioclase, K–feldspar and hornblende are more abundant, quartz and biotite are less abundant. In some equigranular <b>enclaves</b> clinopyroxene and orthopyroxene are accessory minerals. The mafic microgranular <b>enclaves</b> are mostly intermediate in composition all contain more than 46 % SiO 2. The femic oxides (Fe 2 O 3 t, MgO and MnO) decrease systematically relative to SiO 2; most of mafic microgranular <b>enclaves</b> compositions cluster near the granodiorite trend line. Many trace elements do not show clear linear correlation with SiO 2; are scattered off the trends defined by related granodiorite. The petrographic and geochemical characteristics of the mafic <b>enclaves</b> and their host granodiorite indicate that the Kozak granodiorite is a product of partial melting and fractional crystallization of basic magma, and <b>enclaves</b> are trapped blobs of basic initial magma. Petrographic properties indicate that during magmatic evolution, the granodiorit...|$|R

40|$|This article {{presents}} conditions of insecurity {{and violence in}} Karachi in relation to an emerging geography whereby the city is fragmented into various <b>enclaves</b> of business, leisure and residence. Such <b>enclaves</b> have proliferated {{as a response to}} impotent public security in the face of rising urban violence and insecurity. Focusing on residential <b>enclaves,</b> which are primarily privately securitized spaces that attempt to restrict unwanted circulation, I emphasize the paradox of Karachi’s enclavization. Although the city is fast morphing into an archipelago of <b>enclaves,</b> Karachi continues to be drawn into a vortex of violence, and residents remain insecure. In this article, I investigate this paradox through a relational study of enclavization, insecurity and violence. I argue although <b>enclaves</b> in Karachi emerge as a tactic to deal with everyday insecurity and violence, the socio-political conditions generated by processes of enclavization create circumstances that produce a continuum of violence. This argument is illustrated through an analysis of two case studies, Clifton Block 7 and Sultanabad, which are both residential <b>enclaves</b> within Karachi. The case studies are an output of qualitative field research that focused on the politics of everyday life within <b>enclaved</b> spaces in relation to the city ‘outside’. Analysis demonstrates that <b>enclaves</b> are spaces of subjectivity that also create contradictions of security and insecurity, and generate vulnerabilities of inclusion and exclusion. The article also demonstrates how such <b>enclaves</b> emerge as urban political actors that shift existing state–society relations. In conclusion, it presents a critical analysis of emerging connections between enclavization and insecurity, which proves that the causes and consequences of <b>enclaves,</b> insecurity and violence exist in a continuum...|$|R
