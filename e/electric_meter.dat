25|$|Historically, Karaites {{refrained from}} using or {{deriving}} benefit from fire until the Sabbath ends, and accordingly their homes were not lit {{during the night}} of the Sabbath. Many modern Karaites today use a fluorescent or LED lamp powered by batteries, which is turned on prior to Shabbat. Many observant Karaites either unplug their refrigerators on Shabbat or turn off the circuit breakers. Karaites consider producing electricity to be a violation of Shabbat, no matter who produces it. Additionally, some Karaites view the purchasing of electricity that is charged on an incremental basis during the Shabbat as a commercial transaction that the Tanakh prohibits, no matter when the payment is made; the recording of the <b>electric</b> <b>meter</b> is considered by them to be a commercial transaction.|$|E

A Smart meter with a local utility that supports “green button” data is the most accurate option to measure Home Idle Load. Another option involves using the user’s utility website to access consumption charts showing hourly electric use. If green button data is not available, the user may measure Home Idle Load by analysing the home’s <b>electric</b> <b>meter</b> while all home electronic devices are in innactive mode.
