5|$|The <b>electrostatic</b> <b>force</b> {{was first}} {{described}} in 1784 by Coulomb {{as a force}} that existed intrinsically between two charges. The properties of the <b>electrostatic</b> <b>force</b> were that it varied as an inverse square law directed in the radial direction, was both attractive and repulsive (there was intrinsic polarity), was independent {{of the mass of}} the charged objects, and followed the superposition principle. Coulomb's law unifies all these observations into one succinct statement.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} to produce a plasma that is not quasineutral. An electron beam, for example, has only negative charges. The density of a non-neutral plasma must generally be very low, or it must be very small, otherwise it will be dissipated by the repulsive <b>electrostatic</b> <b>force.</b>|$|E
5|$|All the bound {{protons and}} {{neutrons}} in an atom {{make up a}} tiny atomic nucleus, and are collectively called nucleons. The radius of a nucleus is approximately equal to 1.07fm, where A is {{the total number of}} nucleons. This is much smaller than the radius of the atom, which is on the order of 105fm. The nucleons are bound together by a short-ranged attractive potential called the residual strong force. At distances smaller than 2.5 fm this force is much more powerful than the <b>electrostatic</b> <b>force</b> that causes positively charged protons to repel each other.|$|E

By {{measuring}} the flatness of a thin Si-wafer across the supporting pins at high chucking voltages, local bending values are obtained. Comparing these values with FE calculations based on the wafer parameter and chuck design data, the local <b>electrostatic</b> <b>forces</b> can be derived. Our measurements reveal considerable stochastic bending variation across the surface, but are (on the whole) in good agreement with calculated <b>electrostatic</b> <b>forces</b> from the chuck design and demonstrate the potential of this method for chuck characterization...|$|R

25|$|In all {{most any}} of the methods in {{simulation}} of ion channels, the major computational cost comes from the calculation of <b>electrostatic</b> <b>forces</b> acting on the ions. In continuum models, for instance, where ionic density exist rather than explicit ions, the electrostatic potential is calculated in a self-consistent manner by solving the Poisson equation. In MD simulations, on the other hand, the <b>electrostatic</b> <b>forces</b> acting on the particles are calculated by explicit evaluation of the Coulombic force term, often splitting the short-range and long-range <b>electrostatic</b> <b>forces</b> {{so they could be}} computed with different methods. In our model as a reduced particle method, the longrange <b>electrostatic</b> <b>forces</b> are evaluated by solving the Poisson equation and augmenting the forces so obtained with a short-range component. By solving the Poisson equation it is possible to self-consistently include the forces arising from the bias to the system, while this is a difficult issue to be addressed in MD simulations.|$|R

Solving the Poisson equation on the grid counts for the particlemesh component of the P3M scheme. However, this discretization leads to an unavoidable truncation of the short-range component of <b>electrostatic</b> <b>force,</b> which can be corrected by computing the short-range charge-charge Coulombic interactions.|$|E
25|$|A {{substantial}} energy {{barrier of}} electrostatic forces must be overcome before fusion can occur. At large distances, two naked nuclei repel one another {{because of the}} repulsive <b>electrostatic</b> <b>force</b> between their positively charged protons. If two nuclei can be brought close enough together, however, the electrostatic repulsion can be overcome by the quantum effect in which nuclei can tunnel through coulomb forces.|$|E

40|$|Manipulation by contact {{of objects}} between 1 μm and 1 mm are often {{disturbed}} by adhesion between the manipulated object and the gripper. <b>Electrostatic</b> <b>forces</b> {{are among the}} phenomena responsible for this adhesive effect. Analytical models have been developed in the literature to predict <b>electrostatic</b> <b>forces.</b> Most models have been developed {{within the framework of}} scanning probe microscopy, i. e. for a contact between a conducting tip and a metallic surface. In our study, we developed a simulation tool based on finite elements modeling. The strength of this model {{lies in the fact that}} it integrates roughness parameters. Measurements of <b>electrostatic</b> <b>forces</b> in function of roughness were conducted by atomic force microscopy. The experimental results were compared with the simulation results showing very good correlation. This demonstrates the influence of surface topography on <b>electrostatic</b> <b>forces,</b> especially for very small separation distances and proves the utility of the simulation tool in designing surfaces with controlled adhesion. Some application fields to which these results can be applied are drug delivery devices and micromanipulation tools. © 2009 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

25|$|When surface charges {{present at}} {{the wall of a}} channel of micro-scaled width, counterions are {{attracted}} and co-ions are repelled by <b>electrostatic</b> <b>force.</b> The counterions form a shielding area near the wall. This region penetrate into solution to a certain distance called Debye length until the electric potential decays to the bulk value of neutrality. The Debye length is ranging typically from 1nm to 100nm for aqueous solutions.|$|E
25|$|By convention, {{the charge}} of an {{electron}} is −1, while that of a proton is +1. Charged particles whose charges have the same sign repel one another, and particles whose charges have different signs attract. Coulomb's law quantifies the <b>electrostatic</b> <b>force</b> between two particles by asserting that the force {{is proportional to the}} product of their charges, and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.|$|E
25|$|Fusion {{reactions}} {{occur when}} {{two or more}} atomic nuclei come close enough for long enough that the nuclear force pulling them together exceeds the <b>electrostatic</b> <b>force</b> pushing them apart, fusing them into heavier nuclei. For nuclei lighter than iron-56, the reaction is exothermic, releasing energy. For nuclei heavier than iron-56, the reaction is endothermic, requiring an external source of energy. Hence, nuclei smaller than iron-56 {{are more likely to}} fuse while those heavier than iron-56 are more likely to break apart.|$|E

25|$|The {{situation}} is similar if two nuclei are brought together. As they approach each other, all the protons in one nucleus repel all the protons in the other. Not until the two nuclei actually come {{close enough for}} long enough so the strong nuclear force can take over (by way of tunneling) is the repulsive <b>electrostatic</b> <b>force</b> overcome. Consequently, even when the final energy state is lower, {{there is a large}} energy barrier that must first be overcome. It is called the Coulomb barrier.|$|E
25|$|For {{electrolyte}} solution in a channel with a macro- or micro-scaled radius, surface charges {{at the wall}} attract counterions and repel co-ions due to <b>electrostatic</b> <b>force.</b> Therefore, an electrical double layer exists between the wall of channel and the solution. The dimension of the electrical double layer {{is determined by the}} Debye length in this system, which is typically much smaller than the channel radius. Most of the solution in the channel is electrically neutral due to the shielding effect of the electrical double layer.|$|E
25|$|Activation {{energies}} for fusion {{reactions are}} generally high because the protons in each nucleus {{will tend to}} strongly repel one another, as they each have the same positive charge. A heuristic for estimating reaction rates is that nuclei {{must be able to}} get within 100 femtometers (1 × 10−13 meter) of each other, where the nuclei are increasingly likely to undergo quantum tunneling past the electrostatic barrier and the turning point where the strong nuclear force and the <b>electrostatic</b> <b>force</b> are equally balanced, allowing them to fuse. In ITER, this distance of approach is made possible by high temperatures and magnetic confinement.|$|E

25|$|An {{ionic bond}} is formed when a metal loses {{one or more}} of its electrons, {{becoming}} a positively charged cation, and the electrons are then gained by the non-metal atom, becoming a negatively charged anion. The two oppositely charged ions attract one another, and the ionic bond is the <b>electrostatic</b> <b>force</b> of attraction between them. For example, sodium (Na), a metal, loses one electron to become an Na+ cation while chlorine (Cl), a non-metal, gains this electron to become Cl−. The ions are held together due to electrostatic attraction, and that compound sodium chloride (NaCl), or common table salt, is formed.|$|E

They spotted alpha particles bouncing off the metal foil in all directions, some right back at the source. This should have been impossible according to Thomson's model; the alpha particles should have all gone straight through. Obviously, those particles had encountered an <b>electrostatic</b> <b>force</b> far greater than Thomson's model suggested they would, which in turn implied that the atom's positive charge was concentrated in a much tinier volume than Thomson imagined.|$|E
25|$|Stability of {{nanoparticle}} agglomerates {{is critical}} for estimating size distribution of aerosolized particles from nano-powders or other sources. At nanotechnology workplaces, workers can be exposed via inhalation to potentially toxic substances during handling and processing of nanomaterials. Nanoparticles in the air often form agglomerates due to attractive inter-particle forces, such as van der Waals force or <b>electrostatic</b> <b>force</b> if the particles are charged. As a result, aerosol particles are usually observed as agglomerates rather than individual particles. For exposure and risk assessments of airborne nanoparticles, {{it is important to}} know about the size distribution of aerosols. When inhaled by humans, particles with different diameters are deposited in varied locations of the central and periphery respiratory system. Particles in nanoscale have been shown to penetrate the air-blood barrier in lungs and be translocated into secondary organs in the human body, such as the brain, heart and liver. Therefore, the knowledge on stability of nanoparticle agglomerates is important for predicting the size of aerosol particles, which helps assess the potential risk of them to human bodies.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. In {{this paper}} we propose a {{nonlinear}} elasticity model of macromolecular conformational change (deformation) induced by <b>electrostatic</b> <b>forces</b> generated by an implicit solvation model. The Poisson-Boltzmann equation for the electrostatic potential is analyzed in a domain varying with the elastic deformation of molecules, and a new continuous model of the <b>electrostatic</b> <b>forces</b> is developed to ensure solvability of the nonlinear elasticity equations. We derive the estimates of <b>electrostatic</b> <b>forces</b> corresponding to four types of perturbations to an electrostatic potential field, and establish the existance of an equilibrium configuration using a fixed-point argument, under the assumption that the change in the ionic strength and charges due to the additional molecules causing the deformation are sufficiently small.

The results are that the mass transport coefficient for Brownian diffusion is limited by the <b>electrostatic</b> <b>forces</b> mostly for large aggregates. The mass transport coefficient for the velocity gradients is not limited by the surface charge for measured ζ potential.
