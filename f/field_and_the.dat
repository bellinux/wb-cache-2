5|$|Between 15 and 20 August, the U.S. {{carriers}} {{covered the}} delivery of fighter and bomber aircraft to the newly opened Henderson Field on Guadalcanal. This small, hard-won airfield was a critical point in the entire island chain, and both military sides strategically considered that control of the airbase offered potential control of the local battle area airspace. In fact, Henderson <b>Field</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> aircraft based upon it soon resulted in telling effects on the movement of Japanese forces in the Solomon Islands and in the attrition of Japanese air forces in the South Pacific Area. Historically, Allied control of Henderson Field became the key factor in the entire battle for Guadalcanal.|$|E
5|$|Construction on the Blue Line, {{which was}} {{initially}} {{known as the}} Hiawatha Line, began in 2001. The line opened in two phases in 2004, beginning with a 12-station stretch from the Warehouse District / Hennepin Avenue station through the Fort Snelling station in June. In December, five more stations were opened, continuing service south of Fort Snelling to the Mall of America station. Two additional Blue Line stations opened in late 2009: a new northern terminus at Target <b>Field</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> American Boulevard station in Bloomington. Construction on the Green Line, which was initially designated as the Central Corridor, began in 2010. The line opened in its entirety in June 2014.|$|E
5|$|Goebel {{played a}} role in a famous Ohio State-Illinois game on November 13, 1943. The game was Paul Brown's last game as coach of the Buckeyes. With the score tied 26–26, Ohio State threw an {{incomplete}} forward pass into the end zone as the gun sounded. The game appeared to have ended in a tie, the teams left the <b>field,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> stands emptied. However, Ohio State assistant coach Ernie Godfrey had noticed Goebel, who was the head linesman, drop a handkerchief to signal a penalty. On hearing the gun sound, Goebel had picked up the handkerchief and put it back in his back pocket. Godfrey confronted Goebel, who conceded that Illinois was offsides. Twenty minutes later, the teams came back onto the <b>field</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Buckeyes kicked a 33-yard field goal to give Coach Brown a 29–26 win in his final game.|$|E

5|$|In week nine, the All-Americans {{played the}} Bulldogs. Jim Thorpe, who was later {{inducted}} into the Pro Football Hall of Fame, started the game for the Bulldogs, but he came out at halftime because he believed it would end in a tie. Both teams were slowed by a muddy <b>field,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> football became soggy after three quarters. Neither the All-Americans nor the Bulldogs could gain a lot of yards during the game. The lone score of the game came with under four minutes to play: a field goal from the Bulldogs' Al Feeney. He never missed a field goal the entire 1920 season, and the final score of the game was 3–0.|$|E

The lone score of the game came with under four minutes to play: a field goal from the Bulldogs' Feeney. The game was the only loss of the season for the All-Americans.|$|E

5|$|MFP Baseball, which {{purchased}} the Sounds in early 2009, invested over $2million to make repairs and upgrades to the aging stadium's playing field, restrooms, concession stands, scoreboard, sound system, and seating.

The entire concourse and guitar scoreboard were repainted, broken seats were replaced, and Sluggers Sports Bar & Grill was remodeled. A permanent concert stage and a family fun zone were constructed by the concourse entrance.|$|E

When the brothers sold Rockwell <b>Field</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> new owner canceled WAE's lease, the airline had to look for another airport. Local businessman P. A.

Mickey Mantle, Yogi Berra, and Whitey Ford were among the players fielded by the Yankees during the era. After the 1964 season, a lack of effective replacements for aging players caused the franchise to decline on the <b>field,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> team became a money-loser for owners CBS while playing in an aging stadium.|$|E
