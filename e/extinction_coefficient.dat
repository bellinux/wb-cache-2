For example, peak absorption of NAD is at a wavelength of 259nanometers (nm), with an <b>extinction</b> <b>coefficient</b> of 16,900M−1cm−1. NADH also absorbs at higher wavelengths, with a second peak in UV absorption at 339nm with an <b>extinction</b> <b>coefficient</b> of 6,220M−1cm−1. This difference in the ultraviolet absorption spectra between the oxidized and reduced forms of the coenzymes at higher wavelengths makes it simple to measure the conversion of one to another in enzyme assays– by measuring the amount of UV absorption at 340nm using a spectrophotometer.|$|E

Observations were taken intermittently from January to March, and continuously from April through October, 2003. We assessed the data quality of ILAS-II version 1. 4 aerosol <b>extinction</b> <b>coefficients</b> at 780 nm from comparisons with the Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment (SAGE) II, SAGE III, and the Polar Ozone and Aerosol Measurement (POAM) III aerosol data. At heights below 20 km in the Northern Hemisphere, aerosol <b>extinction</b> <b>coefficients</b> from ILAS-II agreed with those from SAGE II and SAGE III within 10 %, and with those from POAM III within 15 %. From 20 to 26 km, ILAS-II aerosol <b>extinction</b> <b>coefficients</b> were smaller than <b>extinction</b> <b>coefficients</b> from the other sensors; differences between ILAS-II and SAGE II ranged from 10 % at 20 km to 34 % at 26 km.

25|$|The spectroscopic {{properties}} of FAD and its variants allows for reaction monitoring {{by use of}} UV-VIS absorption and fluorescence spectroscopies. Each of the different forms of FAD have distinct absorbance spectra, making for easy observation of changes in oxidation state. A major local absorbance maximum for FAD is observed at 450nm, with an <b>extinction</b> <b>coefficient</b> of 11,300. Flavins in general have fluorescent activity when unbound (proteins bound to flavin nucleic acid derivatives are called flavoproteins). This property can be utilized when examining protein binding, observing loss of fluorescent activity when put into the bound state. Oxidized flavins have high absorbances of about 450nm, and fluoresce at about 515-520nm.|$|E
25|$|A {{new class}} of {{fluorescent}} protein was evolved from a cyanobacterial (Trichodesmium erythraeum) phycobiliprotein, α-allophycocyanin, and named small ultra red fluorescent protein (smURFP) in 2016. smURFP autocatalytically self-incorporates the chromophore biliverdin without the need of an external protein, known as a lyase. Jellyfish- and coral-derived fluorescent proteins require oxygen and produce a stoichiometric amount of hydrogen peroxide upon chromophore formation. smURFP does not require oxygen or produce hydrogen peroxide and uses the chromophore biliverdin. smURFP has a large <b>extinction</b> <b>coefficient</b> (180,000 M−1 cm−1) and has a modest quantum yield (0.20), which makes it comparable biophysical brightness to eGFP and ~2-fold brighter than most red or far-red fluorescent proteins derived from coral. smURFP spectral properties {{are similar to the}} organic dye Cy5.|$|E
