30|$|We assume in {{this paper}} that the {{accelerations}} experienced by the accelerometer cage have a linear relationship to the <b>electrode</b> <b>voltages.</b> Thus, the conversion from <b>electrode</b> <b>voltages</b> to accelerations involves {{the application of a}} scale factor and an bias, for which nominal values are known from the design of the accelerometers. It is expected that the real scale factor and bias differ from the nominal ones. Because the control voltages applied to the electrodes are too small for lifting the proof mass in a 1 -g environment (Fedosov and Pereštý 2011), the real scale factor and bias cannot be determined on-ground. Instead, they have to be determined in-flight when the accelerometers are in a micro-g environment.|$|R

50|$|For this to work, {{the cell}} {{capacitance}} must {{be higher than}} the electrode capacitance by at least an order of magnitude. Capacitance slows the kinetics (the rise and fall times) of currents. If the electrode capacitance is much {{less than that of}} the cell, then when current is passed through the electrode, the <b>electrode</b> <b>voltage</b> will change faster than the cell voltage. Thus, when current is injected and then turned off (at the end of a duty cycle), the <b>electrode</b> <b>voltage</b> will decay faster than the cell voltage. As soon as the <b>electrode</b> <b>voltage</b> asymptotes to the cell voltage, the voltage can be sampled (again) and the next amount of charge applied. Thus, the frequency of the duty cycle is limited to the speed at which the <b>electrode</b> <b>voltage</b> rises and decays while passing current. The lower the electrode capacitance the faster one can cycle.|$|E

50|$|Faradaic loss is {{only one}} form of energy loss in an {{electrochemical}} system. Another is overpotential, {{the difference between the}} theoretical and actual <b>electrode</b> <b>voltages</b> needed to drive the reaction at the desired rate. Even a rechargeable battery with 100% faradaic efficiency requires charging at a higher voltage than it produces during discharge, so its overall energy efficiency is the product of voltage efficiency and faradaic efficiency.

50|$|The {{problem of}} contact {{resistance}} {{can be overcome}} by using four electrodes. The two end electrodes are used to inject current as before, but the voltage is measured between the two inner electrodes. The effective length of the sample being measured is {{the distance between the}} two inner <b>electrodes.</b> Modern <b>voltage</b> meters draw very little current so there is no significant current through the <b>voltage</b> <b>electrodes</b> and hence no voltage drop across the contact resistances.|$|R
50|$|The basic {{spot welder}} {{consists}} of a power supply, an energy storage unit (e.g., a capacitor bank), a switch, a welding transformer, and the welding electrodes. The energy storage element allows the welder to deliver high instantaneous power levels. If the power demands are not high, then the energy storage element isn't needed. The switch causes the stored energy to be dumped into the welding transformer. The welding transformer steps down the voltage and steps up the current. An important feature of the transformer is it reduces the current level that the switch must handle. The welding electrodes {{are part of the}} transformer's secondary circuit. There is also a control box that manages the switch and may monitor the welding <b>electrode</b> <b>voltage</b> or current.|$|E
50|$|SEVC-d {{has a major}} {{advantage}} over SEVC-c in allowing the experimenter to measure membrane potential, and, as it obviates passing current and measuring voltage at the same time, there is never a series resistance error. The main disadvantages are that the time resolution is limited and the amplifier is unstable. If it passes too much current, so that the goal voltage is over-shot, it reverses the polarity of the current in the next duty cycle. This causes it to undershoot the target voltage, so the next cycle reverses the polarity of the injected current again. This error can grow with each cycle until the amplifier oscillates out of control (“ringing”); this usually results {{in the destruction of}} the cell being recorded. The investigator wants a short duty cycle to improve temporal resolution; the amplifier has adjustable compensators that will make the <b>electrode</b> <b>voltage</b> decay faster, but, if these are set too high the amplifier will ring, so the investigator is always trying to “tune” the amplifier as close to the edge of uncontrolled oscillation as possible, in which case small changes in recording conditions can cause ringing. There are two solutions: to “back off” the amplifier settings into a safe range, or to be alert for signs that the amplifier is about to ring.|$|E
50|$|The dual-cell {{voltage clamp}} {{technique}} is a specialized {{variation of the}} two <b>electrode</b> <b>voltage</b> clamp, and is only {{used in the study}} of gap junction channels. Gap junctions are pores that directly link two cells through which ions and small metabolites flow freely. When two cells in which gap junction proteins are expressed either endogenously or via injection of mRNA, a junction channel will form between the cells. Since two cells are present in the system, two sets of electrodes are used. A recording electrode and a current injecting electrode are inserted into each cell, and each cell is clamped individually (each set of electrodes is attached to a separate apparatus, and integration of data is performed by computer). To record junctional conductance, the current is varied in the first cell while the recording electrode in the second cell records any changes in Vm for the second cell only. (The process can be reversed with the stimulus occurring in the second cell and recording occurring in the first cell.) Since no variation in current is being induced by the electrode in the recorded cell, any change in voltage must be induced by current crossing into the recorded cell, through the gap junction channels, from the cell in which the current was varied.|$|E
