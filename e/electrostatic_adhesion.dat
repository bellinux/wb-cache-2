A double tracked wall climbing robot based on <b>electrostatic</b> <b>adhesion</b> technology is presented including electrode panel design, mechanical structure design, power supply system design and control system design. A theoretical adhesion model was established and the electrostatic potential and field were expressed by series expansions in terms of solutions of the Laplace function. Based on this model, the <b>electrostatic</b> <b>adhesion</b> force was calculated using the Maxwell stress tensor formulation. Several important factors which may influence the <b>electrostatic</b> <b>adhesion</b> force were analysed and discussed by both FEM simulation and theoretical calculation. In addition, experiments on the adhesion performance of the electrode panel and the climbing performance of the robot on various wall materials were carried out.

30|$|The {{first is}} {{fluctuation}} and limited time-response of the <b>electrostatic</b> <b>adhesion</b> force. When voltage is applied between the pad electrode {{and the screen}} electrode, the electrodes deform due to the <b>electrostatic</b> <b>adhesion</b> force. The resulting gap variation between the electrodes can fluctuate the electrostatic force. Especially, when a soft conductive rubber is utilized as the pad electrode, the <b>electrostatic</b> <b>adhesion</b> force suddenly increases as the voltage is gradually increased, probably due to a sudden change of {{the gap between the}} electrodes [12]. The deformation of the electrodes also affects the time-response of the electrostatic force. As a result, on the actual device, the force does not simply follow the square-law.|$|E
40|$|Previous electroadhesive {{climbing}} robots generally employed typical electromagnetic motors, which spoiled some of {{the advantages}} of electroadhesion such as it being light, thin and flexible.

Based on these analyses, we designed and fabricated a lightweight (94 g) and low-height (15 mm) prototype with electrode films made by screen printing.

40|$|Initial {{adhesion}} of fungi to plasticized {{polyvinyl chloride}} (pPVC) may determine subsequent colonization and biodeterioration processes. The deteriogenic fungus Aureobasidium pullulans {{was used to}} investigate the physicochemical nature of adhesion to both unplasticized PVC (uPVC) and pPVC containing the plasticizers dioctyl phthalate (DOP) and dioctyl adipate (DOA). A quantitative adhesion assay using image analysis identified fundamental differences in the mechanism of adhesion of A. pullulans blastospores to these substrata, Adhesion to pPVC was greater than that to uPVC by a maximum of 280 % after a 4 -h incubation with 10 (8) blastospores ml(- 1). That plasticizers enhance adhesion to PVC was confirmed by incorporating a dispersion of both DOA and DOP into the blastospore suspension. Adhesion to uPVC was increased by up to 308 % {{in the presence of}} the dispersed plasticizers. Hydrophobic interactions were found to dominate adhesion to uPVC because (i) a strong positive correlation was observed between substratum hydrophobicity (measured by using a dynamic contact angle analyzer) and adhesion to a range of unplasticized polymers including uPVC, and (ii) neither the pH nor the electrolyte concentration of the suspension buffer, both of which influence <b>electrostatic</b> interactions, affected <b>adhesion</b> to uPVC. In contrast, adhesion to pPVC is principally controlled by <b>electrostatic</b> interactions. Enhanced <b>adhesion</b> to pPVC occurred despite a relative reduction of 13 degrees in the water contact angle of pPVC compared to that of uPVC. Furthermore, adhesion to pPVC was strongly dependent on both the pH and electrolyte concentration of the suspension medium, reaching maximum levels at pH 8 and with an electrolyte concentration of 10 mM NaCl. Plasticization with DOP and DOA therefore increases adhesion of A. pullulans blastospores to pPVC through an interaction mediated by electrostatic forces...|$|R

Therefore, the previous work tried to directly relate the measured capacitance (more exactly, the sum of the current sensor outputs) with the sum of the pushing force and electrostatic force.

40|$|The {{micromanipulation}} {{of objects}} of size between 10 μm and 1 mm is often {{disturbed by the}} adhesionbetween the contacting surfaces. The electrostatic force in the contact alone can significantly perturb themicromanipulation by its important adhesion effect. The <b>electrostatic</b> <b>adhesion</b> force is influenced by manyfactors, i. e. the materials of the contacting bodies and the topography of the contact surface. Micromanipulation by contact involves applying a squeezing force to hold the object firmly which causes the contact surface to deform, flattening the surface asperities. The prime purpose of this work is to study {{the influence of the}} plastic deformation of the surface asperities on the <b>electrostatic</b> <b>adhesion</b> force considering the contact between two conductors. A single-level model of the surface roughness was considered in this study, approximating the shape of a surface asperity by a sine function. A simulation tool based on the finite element method was used to compute the elastic–plastic deformation of the model surface asperities during micromanipulation. Another numerical model was used to compute the <b>electrostatic</b> <b>adhesion</b> force acting on the surface asperities in the initial and in the deformed configurations. A magnification factor of up to 20 was obtained for the electrostatic force in the contact evaluated numerically, related to the flattening of the surface asperities, which can potentially lead to perturbations when releasing the object.

40|$|The use of colloid iron hydroxide, Alcian Blue and enzymic {{treatments}} {{confirmed that}} the negative charges of Dictyostelium discoideum cell surface are mostly due to carboxylic groups. The role of <b>electrostatic</b> charges in <b>adhesion</b> and ingeation was determined by exposing cells to untreated latex beads, polylysine or polyglutamic-acid-coated beads, or carboxylated beads. This study showed that negatively charged beads presented a weaker adhesion strength than positively charged ones and that adhesion was strongest with untreated beads.

The treatment of cells with polylysine or polyglutamic acid before neutral bead addition generally enhanced the ingestion rate.

40|$|Particulate {{contamination}} of the optical surfaces of solar collectors, often called "soiling", can have a significant deteriorating impact on energy yield due to the absorption and scattering of incident light. Soiling has more destructive effect on concentrated solar systems than on flat-plate photovoltaic panels, as the former are incapable of converting scattered sunlight. The {{first part of this}} thesis deals with the soiling losses of flat-plate photovoltaic (PV), concentrated solar power (CSP), and concentrated photovoltaic (CPV) systems in operation in several regions of the world. Influential parameters in dust accumulation losses, as well as different cleaning mechanisms in pursuit of restoring the efficiency of soiled systems, have been thoroughly investigated. In lieu of the most commonly-practiced manual cleaning method of using high-pressure water jets, the concept of automatic dust removal using the electrostatic forces of electrodynamic screen (EDS) technology is in a developmental stage and on its way toward commercialization. This thesis provides comprehensive analytical solutions for the electric potential and electric field distribution in EDS devices having different configurations. Numerical simulations developed using finite element analysis (FEA) software have corroborated the analytical solutions which can easily be embedded into software programs for particle trajectory simulations while also providing flexibility and generality in the study on the effect of different parameters of the EDS on the electric field and ensuing dust-removal performance. Evaluation and comparison of different repelling and attracting forces exerted on dust particles is of utmost importance to a detailed analysis of EDS performance in dust removal. Hence, the balance of <b>electrostatic</b> and <b>adhesion</b> forces, including van der Waals and capillary forces, have received significant attention in this dissertation.

Different tests have been conducted on an EDS sample integrated with a PV cell to restore the efficiency of the cell after dust deposition.

The vascular flow dynamics of nanocarriers (NCs) in human microcapillaries play an impor-tant role in the ultimate efficacy of this drug delivery method. This article reports an ex-perimental study {{of the effect of}} nanoparticle size on their margination and adhesion propensity in microfluidic channels of a half-elliptical cross section. Spherical polysty-rene particles ranging in diameter from 60 to 970 nm were flown in the microchannels and individual particles adhered to either the top or bottom wall of the channel were imaged using fluorescence microscopy. When the number concentration of particles in the flow was kept constant, the percentage of nanoparticles adhered to the top wall increased with decreasing diameter (d), with the number of particles adhered to the top wall following a d 3 trend. When the volume concentration of particles in solution was kept constant, no discernible trend was found. This experimental finding is explained by the competition between the Brownian force promoting margination and repulsive parti-cle–particle <b>electrostatic</b> forces retarding <b>adhesion</b> to the wall. The 970 nm particles were found to adhere to the bottom wall much more than to the top wall {{for each of the three}} physiologically relevant shear rates tested, revealing the effect of gravitational force on the large particles.

40|$|This thesis {{illustrates}} the behaviour of cellulose ethers during powder processing, compaction and drug release, {{as these are}} frequently employed in the fabrication of compressed hydrophilic matrices. The handling operations can give rise to the electrification of powder particles, which can affect the end product‘s quality. Controlling the parameters which can dictate the quality of compressed matrices is an ambition inherent {{in the development of}} pharmaceutical formulations. Thus, the aims and objectives of this thesis were to firstly study the <b>electrostatic,</b> surface <b>adhesion,</b> dissolution and compaction properties of plain polymers and model drugs. Secondly, binary mixtures of fixed drug to polymer ratios were made in order to investigate the effect of polymer concentration and physico-chemical attributes (particle size, chemistry and viscosity) on the tribo-electric charging, surface adhesion (SA), swelling, erosion, drug release kinetics and compaction properties of model drugs. It can be discerned that the both drugs charged negatively, whereas the methylcellulose (MC) and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) particles charged positively. The physico-chemical properties associated with MC and HPMC, such as particle size, chemical heterogeneity and molecular size of cellulose ethers all {{have a significant effect on}} charging and adhesion behaviour of plain MC and HPMC particles. Moreover, the concentration, particle size, chemical heterogeneity and molecular size of MC/HPMC all significantly affect the charging and SA propensity of the model drugs studied. The swelling and dissolution results confirm that the extent and rate of swelling, swelling exponent, dissolution rate and drug release kinetic parameters were affected by physico-chemical attributes (concentration, particle size, substitution and viscosity) of MC/HPMC and drug solubility. The mechanism of swelling and drug release was found to be anomalous. However, it inclined towards more diffusion-oriented swelling/drug release with higher MC/HPMC levels, viscosity, Hpo/Meo substitution ratios, drug solubility but smaller MC/MC particle size. The matrix erosion results obtained from newly developed phenol-sulphuric acid assay (PSA) method confirmed that the solubility of the drug, and levels of HPMC in a particular matrix tablet, significantly affect the matrix erosion rate and the results were similar to those determined using the much more labour-intensive gravimetric method. Moreover, the combination of conventional UV drug analysis technique and PSA assay can be used to simultaneously quantify the matrix erosion, polymer dissolution and drug release kinetics in a single set of experiments avoiding the need for separate studies. The compaction results confirmed that the FBP has poor compaction as compare to THP. The particle size, substitution ratios and molecular size of MC/HPMC affect the compaction and consolidation behaviour of plain MC/HPMC compacts. Furthermore, it can be noticed that the concentration and physico-chemical attributes (particle size, chemistry and molecular size) of MC/HPMC have a significant influence on the densification and consolidation process of hydrophilic matrices. In summary, the information obtained can be used in the future to develop and adopt strategies for development and further optimization of compressed hydrophilic matrices...|$|R
40|$|A novel {{technique}} is developed to measure quantitatively the adhesion strength of metallizations deposited on substrates such as silicon. <b>Electrostatic</b> <b>adhesion</b> testing employs electrostatic forces to generate delaminating stresses in thin metallic films. The interfacial adhesion strength is readily {{calculated from the}} electrode geometry and the applied electrostatic field at failure. Unlike other adhesion tests, this technique does not require any mechanical contact and is virtually independent of the plastic deformation of the film. Furthermore. this test provides direct strength measurements as opposed to work or energy of adhesion measurements obtained by the common peel-test. The adhesion strengths of several metallizations (Cu, Al, Al-Cu alloy, and TiN) are characterized using this electrostatic technique. The distribution of stress-at-failure data follows Weibull statistics. Field emission scanning electron microscopy reveals that films are delaminated in a micro-blister-type mode. Annealing of metallizations causes reactions and changes flaw distributions. The presence of brittle compounds near the interface may create easy fracture paths and can act as stress concentrators to initiate and propagate the fracture.

Both EC and PVP were used as coating agents to study polymers with significantly different chemistry. Carriers were prepared via sieve fractioning followed by spray drying from a saturated lactose suspension with and without polymer additive. Each uncoated and coated carrier systems were evaluated in terms of particle size, morphology, drug carrier adhesion, and aerosolisation performance of blended micronized salbutamol sulphate (in terms of both in vitro mass deposition and electrostatic charge). Furthermore, each formulation was studied directly after blending and after storage for 24 hours. All the carrier-based systems prepared had similar particle sizes, as measured by laser diffraction and similar morphologies (as studied using atomic force microscopy and electron microscopy). Interestingly, the surface chemistries of the carriers were significantly different as was drug-carrier adhesion and aerosolisation performance. Particle adhesion between salbutamol sulphate and each carrier followed the rank: PVP coated > un-coated > EC coated lactose. Similarly the aerosol performance (fine particle fraction; FPF) of salbutamol sulphate followed the rank order PVP coated > un-coated > EC coated lactose, correlating well with the adhesion studies. This rank order {{could be attributed to}} the surface energy measured by contact goniometry and related to the chemistry of lactose and each polymer. Interestingly, storage did not significantly affect aerosol performance, however a rank increase in mean FPF value was observed for uncoated and EC coated lactose. Finally the net charge across the aerosol cloud (measured via an electrostatic NGI) indicated that the EC coated lactose transferred less charge to the salbutamol sulphate particles. In general, modification of lactose carrier surface chemistry via coating can be used to alter the aerosol performance of attached drug.

30|$|When a particle, cell or {{microorganism}} {{approaches a}} surface, electrostatic interactions {{are among the}} first forces encountered [1, 2]. Especially for motile microorganisms, surface charge affects adhesion and extended Derjaguin, Landau, Verwey, Overbeek (DLVO) theory, in conjunction with electrostatic interactions, are used to describe observed experimental trends [1, 3]–[6]. A series of studies by the Whitesides group show that an overall electrically neutral surface {{seems to be a}} prerequisite for an inert surface [7, 8]. Electrostatic interactions may still be involved even for formally neutral surfaces, such as self assembled monolayers (SAM) of ethylene glycol, as theory suggests that hydroxyl ions can accumulate on top of the SAM and thus form a negatively charged interface [9]. Studies of electrostatic interactions between microorganisms or cells with surfaces in many cases rely on the presence of charged groups and differently charged surfaces are a result of a changed chemistry and it is desirable to experimentally access the impact and relevance of <b>electrostatic</b> contributions on <b>adhesion</b> phenomena. To restrict interaction studies to electrostatic contributions requires surfaces with constant surface energy and identical surface chemistry. Electrets with embedded charges in polytetrafluoroethylene are one option and recently used to correlate the polarity of the electret with the favorability of this substrate to be colonized by spores of the green algae Ulva linza[5]. Another class of surfaces capable retaining a stable oxide surface but permit local alterations polarization are periodically poled inorganic ferroelectric materials. One of the characteristic features of the ferroelectrics is the presence of electrically reversible polarization. In a properly oriented ferroelectric sample, for example (001)-cut LiNbO 3 crystal or (001)-grown BaTiO 3 thin film, the polarization can be aligned perpendicular to the surface in the positive or negative direction. In this case, the abrupt change in the normal component of the spontaneous polarization on a ferroelectric surface results in the appearance of a bound polarization charge, which in ambient conditions is compensated by accumulation of ionic species or dipole molecules and through redistribution of mobile carriers in the bulk [10]. This screening significantly affects the surface charge distribution and the surface potential and results in band bending [11]. Similarly, charged surface states can pin the surface Fermi level resulting in a change in both the surface charge, the surface potential, and change the molecular band offsets [12]. It has been shown recently that these electrically switchable properties of the ferroelectrics can be used to tailor surface reactivity. Several examples illustrating the effect of polarization on the photo-reduction rate of Ag+[*]ions, the sticking coefficients and interaction energies of alcohol and water molecules can be found in literature [13]–[19], including the selective deposition of virus particles [20].|$|R

40|$|Today, {{there are}} only a few types of {{structural}} engineering applications where structural adhesives play a role, in contrast to other engineering sectors. The possibilities and difficulties of structural adhesive bonding in structural engineering, especially for steel-to-steel connections, are investigated. Practically all structural adhesives are polymers. The cohesive properties mainly depend on their polymer structure and eventual additives. Specific adhesion covers all adhesion types through intermolecular forces (chemical, adsorptive, diffusive and <b>electrostatic).</b> For specific <b>adhesion,</b> good wetting is important. Mechanical adhesion is characterised by interlocking. The mechanical behaviour of most structural adhesives is best described by the Drucker Prager (or related) model. Therefore the tension strength is limited, hence connections should be designed for shear and compression. Lap connections are prone to shear lag which causes a low effectiveness of long laps. Shear lag is mainly influenced by the axial stiffness of the adherents, and shear stiffness and thickness of the adhesive. Lap connections are also prone to peel, due to eccentricity of the lines of action (externally and/or internally). Peel is mainly influenced by adhesive and adherent thicknesses, bending stiffness of the adherents and axial stiffness of the adhesive. The material properties of adhesive are strongly influenced by time-and-environmental effects, especially temperature, moister and creep are important. The mechanical properties of adhesive bonds provide potential for lengthening of steel beams, structures with thin elements, small tolerances or HSS, and fatigue sensitive, composite, hybrid and laminated structures. Due to the relative low weight, adhesive bonds have potential for light weight structures. Due to the appearance, aesthetics may allow the choice for adhesive bonding. For structural engineering there are four specific points of attention. Firstly, the strength of adhesive bonds depend on the adhesive thickness. An optimal thickness exists which is relatively small. The tolerances used in structural engineering make the application of a thin bondline difficult. Secondly, the service life of structural engineering applications is usually 50 years. At such time spans the time-and-environmental effect may lower the design strength drastically. Thirdly, for adhesive bonding a clean working environment is needed, which is difficult to achieve on a construction site. Finally, there is a lack in knowledge, products and code/directives for structural engineering. For adhesive bonded beam-to-column connections a continuous beam instead of a continuous column is beneficial with respect to tension. Nevertheless, tension is hard to avoid in T- or X-shaped beam-to-column connections. An L-shaped roof connection is the most suitable beam-to-column connection for adhesive bonding. The connection can be achieved by two adhesive bonded L-shape plates to the flanges of the beam and column at the inner and outer corner. Linear elastic FEM calculations with linear elements show that, due to shear lag, the effective length of these plates is limited. Due to the large differences of axial stiffness over the width of an H-shaped profile, load transfer mainly takes place near the web. Calculations with higher order element or non-linear material behaviour are not possible with commercial computers. To increase the efficiency of load transfer at the middle of a lap, stepped adherents can be used. The change of axial stiffness at the steps causes an uplift of the shear stress distribution. FEM and practice tests are executed for an adhesive bonded stepped double strap connection. The connection exists of two 15 mm thick steel plates (S 235) which are bonded (Sikadur- 30) by two bonded (Sikadur- 30) steel stepped straps. The straps exists of three 3 mm thick, steel plates (S 235) of 200 mm, 400 mm and 600 mm length. FEM calculations predict a nearly linear load-displacement curve and a failure load of at least 400 kN. The load-displacement curves of the practice tests are similar to the FEM curves up to 300 kN, afterwards the curve slowly flattens. A mean failure load of 561 kN, a sample standard deviation of 12. 85 kN and a 5 th percentile failure load of 549 kN have been achieved. Failure was imposed by adhesion failure; all connections show delamination near nearly all lap ends. Structural EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
40|$|The {{exploration}} of the genetic information carried by DNA {{has become a major}} scientific challenge. Routine DNA analysis, such as PCR, still suffers from important intrinsic limitations. Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) has emerged as an outstanding opportunity for the development of DNA analysis, but its application to duplexes (dsDNA) has been largely hampered by reproducibility and/or sensitivity issues. A simple strategy is presented to perform ultrasensitive direct label-free analysis of unmodified dsDNA with the means of SERS by using positively charged silver colloids. <b>Electrostatic</b> <b>adhesion</b> of DNA promotes nanoparticle aggregation into stable clusters yielding intense and reproducible SERS spectra at nanogram level. As potential applications, we report the quantitative recognition of hybridization events as well as the first examples of SERS recognition of single base mismatches and base methylations (5 -methylated cytosine and N 6 -methylated Adenine) in duplexes...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{multicomponent}} oxides provides {{new opportunities}} for replica functionality, but introduces new complications in controlling phase. Five research areas will be presented. First, robotic coating systems were designed and fabricated to facilitate this research. Second freestanding photoluminescent lanthanide-doped oxide replicas of optically active biological templates were synthesized via layer-by-layer (LbL) surface sol-gel (SSG) deposition and subsequent morphology-preserving thermal treatments to create structures with tailorable optical response. Third, freestanding ferroelectric replicas of bio-organic templates were produced via LbL SSG deposition and controlled atmosphere thermal treatments for tailorable <b>electrostatic</b> <b>adhesion.</b> Fourth, the deposition kinetics of the SSG coating process using a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) was investigated for commonly used precursors. This work will help guide future research on SSG thin film coatings and replication. Finally, a synthetic inverse opal structure was coated with the SSG method to demonstrate {{the use of the}} coatings on inorganic templates. Ph. D...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — A {{simple and}} robust inter-module latch is {{possibly}} the most important component of a modular robotic system. This paper describes a latch based on electric fields and capacitive coupling. Our design provides not only significant adhesion forces, but {{can also be used}} for inter-module power transmission and communication. The key insight presented in this paper, and the factor that enables <b>electrostatic</b> <b>adhesion</b> to be effective at the macroscale, is the use of electric field attraction to generate frictional shear forces rather than electric field attraction alone. A second important insight is that a specific degree of flexibility in the electrodes is essential to maximize their mutual coupling and the resulting forces— electrodes which are too flexible or too rigid will perform less well. To evaluate the effectiveness of our latch we incorporate it into a cubic module 28 cm on a side. The result is a latch which requires almost zero static power and yet can hold 0. 6 N/cm 2 of latch area. I...|$|E
40|$|Clusters of {{magnetite}} nanoparticles (MNPs) were synthesized using poly(acrylic acid-co-maleic acid) coated MNPs (PAM@MNP) and branched polyethylenimine (PEI). Materials {{were characterized}} by potentiometric titration, zeta potential and dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements. PEI and PAM@MNP are oppositely charged as characterized by zeta potential measurements (+ 8, − 34 mV respectively) and titration (10. 30 mmol −NH 3 +/g PEI; 0. 175 mmol −COO−/g PAM@MNP) at pH 6. 5 ± 0. 2; therefore magnetic clusters are formed by <b>electrostatic</b> <b>adhesion.</b> Two different preparation methods {{and the effect of}} PEI and electrolyte (NaCl) concentration on the cluster formation was studied. Choosing an optimal concentration of PEI (charge ratio of PEI to PAM@MNP: 0. 17) and electrolyte (10 mM), a concentrated (10 g MNP/L) product containing PEI–PAM@MNP nanoclusters with size of 165 ± 10 nm was prepared. Its specific absorption rate (SAR) measured in AC magnetic field (110 kHz, 25 mT) is 12 W/g Fe. The clustered product is expected to have enhanced contrast efficiency in MRI...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{explored}} {{the effect of}} copper sulphate on the morphology of actin filaments. Actin filaments attain different shapes and structure when exposed to 2 mM concentration of copper sulphate. Lateral branches were observed after 4 h of incubation while shapes like Y- and V- were formed after 8 h of incubation. Rings and loops of actin filaments were formed when the concentration of copper sulphate was increased from 2 to 5 mM. Additionally, ring formation was also observed when bead tailed actin filaments were incubated with copper sulphate (5 mM). <b>Electrostatic</b> <b>adhesion</b> energy between ends of actin filaments attracted due to counterion {{was estimated to be}} 7. 34 kT/μm. Divalent cation induced actin ring formation are similar to toroids of DNA but actin filaments have great bending stiffness due to large diameter of the ring formed. From these results we proposed that polyelectrolyte nature of actin filaments leads to the change in their morphology on exposure to high concentration divalent cations...|$|E
40|$|A <b>electrostatic</b> <b>adhesion</b> tester for {{thin film}} conductors. In one embodiment, a device is {{provided}} for testing the adhesion {{strength of a}} thin film conductor that has been formed upon a substrate. The device includes an adhesion tester that is primarily comprised of a conducting portion. The conducting portion {{is applied to the}} thin film conductor so that it does not physically contact the thin film conductor, but leaves a small space there between. A power supply may further be provided for coupling to either the adhesion tester, the thin film conductor, or both {{in order to create a}} potential difference between the conducting portion and the thin film conductor. The potential difference creates an electric field between the conducting portion and the thin film conductor that induces stress in the thin film conductor. A measuring device may also be provided for coupling to the adhesion tester and the thin film conductor in order to measure an electrical parameter of the electric field, which is indicative of the adhesion strength...|$|E
30|$|In recent studies, lateral haptic {{feedback}} {{on a flat}} visual displays, such as liquid crystal displays (LCD), has often been realized utilizing ultrasonic vibration [3, 4] or electrovibration [5, 6]. These technologies modulate surface friction for haptic rendering, by inducing a squeeze film effect or an electrostatic adhesion force between a fingertip and a flat surface. The change of friction, however, is not large enough for kinesthetic force rendering; they can only provide up to 0.1  N of friction change [7], which can only realize surface texture rendering, such as rendering of surface roughness; {{it is not possible}} to render, for example, virtual walls. Some studies have mentioned that <b>electrostatic</b> <b>adhesion</b> can realize large force almost up to 2 N between a fingertip and an electrode by using Johnsen-Rahbeck effect [8]. However, the effect requires special electrode material, which is not transparent, and thus it has not been applied to {{haptic feedback}} on an LCD. In addition, the technology needs further investigation on the time response, as it seems the effect becomes dominant only when DC voltage is applied.|$|E
