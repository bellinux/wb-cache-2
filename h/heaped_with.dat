Ladies' groups set up tables at the Northern Central Railway depot. Here {{they were able to}} feed and encourage the passing soldiers. The tables were <b>heaped</b> <b>with</b> various foods and drinks including cold meat, bread, fresh vegetables, buttermilk, lager beer, and a variety of distilled spirits. Ladies Aid Societies banded together to roll bandages and knit socks, trousers, and shirts for the soldiers.|$|E

Diệm {{received}} a glowing welcome and was <b>heaped</b> <b>with</b> praise {{as a leader of}} a [...] "free country" [...] {{in the midst of the}} Cold War. The receptions during the visit were in large part organized by the American Friends of Vietnam (AFV), a lobby group dedicated to resolute US support of South Vietnam and which included many politicians from both major parties. The visit was mainly celebratory and ceremonial, rather than being a policy or planning mission. It was part of a year of travelling for Diệm, as he made a visit to Australia in September, as well as to fellow anti-communist countries South Korea and Thailand.|$|E
500|$|The {{effect of}} Phoebes broadsides on the overladen French frigate were disastrous: {{for two hours}} Africaine limped northwards with Phoebe pouring fire into the French ship without {{significant}} reply. Even as they were cut down by cannon fire, French soldiers continued {{to climb out of}} the hold and join the combat on deck, their musketry useless at the range between the ships and the press of bodies obstructing the French sailors from working their guns effectively. Saulnier was killed, Général de division Edme Desfourneaux badly wounded and many of their subordinates including all of the naval lieutenants, made casualties; almost all of the rigging had been torn away, most of the guns smashed from their mounts and the decks literally <b>heaped</b> <b>with</b> dead bodies. Even the orlop, usually the safest part of a ship and therefore where the ships medical facilities were located, came under heavy fire and three surgeons were killed while standing at the operating table. Eventually the senior surviving officer, Captain Jean-Jacques Magendie, who had suffered a severe head wound, authorised the colours to be struck at 21:30, approximately [...] east of Gibraltar, thereby surrendering the ship. Phoebe by contrast was only lightly damaged, with the principle injury being to the masts: both ships might have been dismasted had there been any strong wind rather than a deep calm during the evening. Only one man, Seaman Samuel Hayes, had been killed and just 12 wounded including the first lieutenant.|$|E

500|$|Inspired by Kumara Vyasa, {{the first}} {{complete}} brahminical {{adaptation of the}} epic Ramayana was written by Kumara Valmiki (a pseudonym of Narahari, 1500) and is called Torave Ramayana after the village Torave, where it was composed. As with the Mahabharata, this adaptation veers away from the Jain version by Nagachandra (1105). Nagachandra had used the champu metre popular in Sanskrit works and sought to portray Ravana as a tragic hero. In {{a departure from the}} original version (by Valmiki), the Jain epic ends with Rama's asceticism and nirvana. Kumara Valmiki's account, written in the Valmiki tradition, is in the shatpadi metre and is steeped in the author's devotion for the god Rama, an incarnation of the god Vishnu. According to the author, the epic he wrote was actually a recounting of Shiva's conversation with his consort Parvati. In this version of the epic, King Ravana, the villain, is one of the suitors at Sita's Swayamvara (lit a ceremony of [...] "choice of a husband"). His failure in winning the bride's hand results in jealousy towards Rama, the eventual bridegroom. As the story progresses, Hanuman, for all his services, is <b>heaped</b> <b>with</b> encomium and is exalted to the status of [...] "the next creator". At the end of the story, during the war with Rama, Ravana realises that Rama is none other than the god Vishnu and hastens to die at his hands to achieve salvation. The chapter narrating the war (Yuddhakanda) is given prominence over all other chapters. The writing has remained popular for centuries and inspired folk theatre such as the Yakshagana, which draws from episodes of Torave Ramayana for enactment. The influence of the Puranic tradition and that of Madhvacharya are visible in this lively yet religious narration that uses every opportunity to glorify its hero, Rama. However, the author has been criticised for dwelling in abstractions and for not reaching the graceful poetic level of his predecessor Kumara Vyasa.|$|E

2500|$|The Inauguration on November 28, 1850, led by King Oscar I and {{including}} two military orchestras, salutes, and cheering crowds, culminated as the king descended the dock, {{and was the}} last to leave it before the water was let in and the bridges were opened to the public. [...] Ericson was made Commander of the Royal Order of Vasa and the city rewarded the engineer amply, while the supervisor of the project, de Geer, was made Knight of the same order. A model of the dock was displayed at the Exposition Universelle in Paris in 1855 were Ericson received the silver medallion. [...] The creation of the lock made it obvious the untidy surrounding area needed a facelift, and Ericson was therefore given the task of embellishing it. [...] A paved space was added south of the lock, Karl Johans Torg, and the sculptor Bengt Erland Fogelberg (1786–1854) created an equestrian statue of Charles XIV John (1763–1844), carried out in Rome and cast in Munich in 1852. [...] Ericson was raised to peerage at the unveiling ceremony November 4, 1854, which made him skipped the second s in his surname. [...] The old canal was rebuilt into a fish sump with a bazaar added on top of it. [...] The irregular waterfront running along Skeppsbron east and north of the lock, at the time still <b>heaped</b> <b>with</b> wooden hovel and other hardly representative structures, was unified 1852–1854 to a single, coherent quay 600 meters long, while Kornhamnstorg on the western side was furnished with a 45 meters long quay. [...] Finally, Ericson also designed two of the drydocks on Beckholmen, still in use.|$|E
