To not say anything is to become stagnant, is to stand still. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>anyone</b> who {{is a fan of}} Star Trek doesn't need to be beaten over the head by some political statement.

But Mavrias has not come close to being included in the first-team squad, however is not bitter over seeing his career stall on Wearside. “I took the decision to leave Panathinaikos and go to Sunderland, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>anyone</b> in my position would take this decision,” he told the Greek press. On 9 January 2016, almost two years after his last match with the first team, Mavrias entered the game in second half as a substitute in a 3-1 away loss against Arsenal for FA Cup.|$|E

So I washed my mouth out with soap. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>anyone</b> can really relate to this song. I'm sure {{there was a time}} in everyone's life where they felt too scared to say how they felt so they 'washed their mouth out with soap'".

5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Die Zeit on 3 May, Böhmermann sharply criticized Angela Merkel. [...] "The chancellor must not waver {{when it comes to}} freedom and human rights", he said. [...] "But instead she filleted me, served me to a neurotic despot for tea and made me become a German Ai Weiwei." [...] His [...] "belief" [...] was shaken, [...] "that every person in Germany has a non-negotiable, inalienable right to exercise certain basic rights: the freedom of art and the freedom of expression." [...] Merkel did [...] "obviously not think for a moment" [...] about the poem, which he said was only an illustration of an insult: [...] "It was much too dumb for me to insult Erdogan. <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>anyone</b> can see this from the stupid smear poem." [...] Böhmermann claimed that he had not even written it himself.|$|E

[...] Teters again {{discussed}} the logo in a 2009 documentary produced by New Mexico PBS: [...] "This image should have gone by the wayside along with Little Black Sambo and the Frito Bandito. ... That this image honors neither Indian or non-Indian people, and that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>anyone</b> who looks at this can recognize it as a blatant racist caricature, tells you, really, again, {{our place in the}} society. ...

I mean, if I can see it, I'll happily comment on it. But can I make the point that we have said that all sides have to respect the inviolability of UN compounds. And that's both side. So if it is what you say it is, we would strongly condemn it. And we're a humanitarian organization. We're not an organization with an army. We have moral force. We have the force of international law. And we have the principles of humanitarianism to protect us. But that's it.” ...|$|E

5000|$|A {{number of}} drivers defended Badoer's performance. Lewis Hamilton said: [...] "I think he's {{done a good}} job. He's not {{put it in the}} wall. He's kept it on the track. It's an {{incredibly}} tall order to jump into the footsteps of Felipe Massa. He hasn't even raced for ten years, so <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>anyone</b> who has taken that long out of the car is going to struggle, but instead I think he {{has done a good job}} just to keep it on the track and bit-by-bit he will catch up". Heikki Kovalainen stated, [...] "I don't know what else you could have expected. Sometimes the tyres warm up, or they overheat or they don't warm up, and it's much more complicated than a few years ago where they brought out tyres that worked straightaway in different conditions. I think that knocks the driver's confidence very easily - if the tyres are not working 100 percent you can't push if you don't feel you have the grip".|$|E
5000|$|Bruce Wayne's butler, {{chief of}} {{security}} and trusted confidant. Irons described his take on Alfred Pennyworth as being [...] "quite a different Alfred than we have seen so far. Zack Snyder had very clear views about what he wanted. I would just say he's more hands-on perhaps than just a butler." [...] When asked what makes his Alfred different than from previous portrayals, Irons said, [...] "Zack Snyder, the director, {{wanted to create a}} completely different Alfred. So I felt I didn't have to carry any baggage from previous ones. It's sort of a reincarnation, if you'd like. I had a feeling I was creating my own Alfred, more of a man who can actually do anything if he has to." [...] According to Irons, Alfred is [...] "a bit of a grease monkey, and he's very involved in the decisions Bruce makes." [...] On how Alfred will be in the film, Irons stated, [...] "He has an interesting history. He's a very competent man. He's the sort of man <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>anyone</b> would like to be married to. He can sort of do everything: change light bulbs, blow up bridges if he has to." ...|$|E
40|$|Stata's svytab {{command is}} quite limited because tables that users need to produce for reports often involve extracting {{a single point}} {{estimate}} (and standard error, confidence intervals, or p-value) from each of dozens or hundreds of svytab commands. Svytabs was designed to produce these tables directly. It sets up and performs many svytab commands and grabs the appropriate output to create formatted tables ready to export to word processor or spreadsheet. The added features include: 1) allows a full varlist for the rowvar if they are dichotomous (sequencing through and grabbing the estimate of interest from each); 2) allows either dichotomous or multi-valued rowvars (if multivalued then varlist is restricted to one); 3) allows multiple subpops and cycles through them; 4) doesn't require [...] but allows [...] a column var (allowing subpops to substitute); 5) formats the output into a log file for exporting as CSV (with table titling options); 6) uses characteristics to provide "nice" naming of rows and columns; 7) provides options for outputting standard errors, confidence intervals, asterisking significance levels, deff, etc [...] . <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>anyone</b> producing complex survey tables would find svytabs quite useful. ...|$|E

40|$|Scientists {{these days}} tend {{to keep up}} a polite fiction that all science is equal. Except {{for the work of}} the misguided {{opponent}} whose arguments we happen to be refuting at the time, we speak as though every scientist's field and methods of study are as good as every other scientist's and perhaps a little better. This keeps us all cordial when it comes to recommending each other for government grants. But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>anyone</b> who looks at the matter closely will agree that some fields of science are moving forward very much faster than others, perhaps by an order of magnitude, if numbers could be put on such estimates. The discoveries leap from the headlines— and they are real advances in complex and difficult subjects, like molecular biology and high-energy physics. As Alvin Weinberg says (1), "Hardly a month goes by without a stunning success in molecular biology being reported in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. " Why should there be such rapid advances in some fields and not in others? I think the usual explanations that we tend to think of—such as the tractability of the subject, or the quality or education of the men drawn into it, or the size of research contracts—are important but inadequate.

[...] A one was bestowed by Rog Reviews, which said [...] "I don’t know who {{this is going to}} appeal to" [...] and [...] "The sex is never really the focus of the movie. It's more about the music and the make up. Are there people who will get off on this? Probably, but <b>I</b> don’t <b>think</b> <b>anyone</b> is going to confuse this with a great jerk-off flick.
