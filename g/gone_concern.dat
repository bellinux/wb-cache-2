30|$|Going over Table  7 {{leads to}} three conclusions: First, the optimal capital ratios for Swiss G-SIBs are about 2.5 {{percentage}} {{points higher than}} the required Swiss TBTF capital ratios of 14.3 % (Basel III Tier 1) and 10 % (CET 1). Second, a similar picture emerges for the large banks of other countries. The optimal capital ratios are always above the minimum equity requirements of the BCBS. Third, results vary across studies. With the exception of Brooke et al. (2015), all studies estimate optimal capital ratios above 15 %. This difference mainly results from a different understanding of loss-absorbing bank capital. As in all the other studies, Brooke et al. (2015) estimate the optimal capital ratios {{on the basis of}} going concern equity capital because bank equity is the only reliable loss absorber in financial crises. Other forms of capital, in particular hybrid capital, failed in the financial crisis of 2007 / 2008. Nevertheless, Brooke et al. (2015) make a general downward adjustment of their optimal capital ratios to reflect the regulatory requirement that banks have to meet <b>gone</b> <b>concern</b> capital in addition to the going concern bank equity. 31 <b>Gone</b> <b>concern</b> capital is equity-like capital such as subordinated debt subject to bail-in. Its intention is to provide capital for failed banks in order to recapitalize, restructure, or wind them down without using taxpayer funds. Moreover, from a conceptional point of view, it is not appropriate to mix going and <b>gone</b> <b>concern</b> capital considerations as it would imply not only a different cost curve but also a benefit curve that includes two objectives: (i) the reduction of crisis probability due to higher equity capital and (ii) the benefits of an orderly resolution due to <b>gone</b> <b>concern</b> capital.|$|E
40|$|With the {{introduction}} of the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) in the European Union, the qualitative requirements for bank regulatory capital have changed. These changes aim at implementing in Europe the Basel III principles for better bank capital that is able to absorb losses of banks, without hindering the continued operations of banks. The qualitative requirements introduced with effect from 1 January 2014 do not relate to the measures introduced in Europe for bank’s recovery and resolution nor do they relate to the additional capital requirements imposed on systematically important banks. They also are not related to the newest requirements to be introduced in respect of total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC) capital to assist with resolution of the largest G-SIB’s. One of the topics researched in this contribution concerns the direct horizontal effect of European regulations. This topic is relevant to address the potential consequences of contractual provisions in bank capital instruments conflicting with the CRR rules and, similarly, conflicts with bank corporate organizational documents. We conclude that in view of the direct binding effect in European jurisdictions of regulations, the CRR provisions create direct binding effects between banks and their shareholders and bond investors. Another topic addressed in this contribution concerns the original concepts introduced by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision as regards capital requirements for banks that are beyond a point of viability. The CRR qualitative requirements for bank’s regulatory capital assume the bank’s operations are continued on a going concern basis and therefore the bank’s business is still viable. Measures to be taken <b>gone</b> <b>concern</b> and potential bail in mechanisms applied in that respect are regulated in other parts of European law. We observe in this contribution that the relevant regulations in Europe are misaligned and therefore create considerable uncertainties for banks in Europe...|$|E
40|$|With the {{adoption}} of the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive, Europe has completed one of the three important pillars of the Banking Union. This directive introduces the resolution tool of ‘bail in’ that aims at putting the burden of bank rescue operations with the private sector. Bail outs financed with public money must be avoided, {{as a result of this}} new mechanism. The original ideas for contingent capital instruments had been developed by the Bazel Comité on Banking Supervision in 2010, albeit that the concepts of the Bazel Comité aimed at forcing the bank’s shareholders and creditors to contribute to loss absorption exclusively in situations where a bank was beyond a point of viability. The manner in which that concept was described at the time of issue of the report in 2010, suggested that the contingent capital mechanism was particularly to be applied in circumstances where a bank’s operation were still going concern. The European transposition of the ideas of the Bazel Comité has taken place at the level of two different frameworks. On the one hand certain bank regulatory capital providers will be obligated to accept a contingent capital mechanism resulting into write down of debt or conversion of debt to equity if certain regulatory triggers apply. Such regulatory triggers are not necessarily clear evidence that a bank is beyond a point of viability. To the contrary, the trigger as defined in European law suggests that a bank may be financially healthy, albeit that certain constraints in the regulatory capital base became imminent. The other framework where a contingent capital mechanism have been introduced, concerns the bail in mechanism of the BRRD. The distinction between the objectives of the two frameworks is not easy to make. One cannot distinct the contingent capital mechanism in the framework of common regulatory capital rules by stating that it applies only if a bank’s operation is going concern, whereas BRRD only applies when the bank’s operation is <b>gone</b> <b>concern.</b> Both frameworks aim at safeguarding the continued operations of banks. In this working paper we explore further differences and question whether or not the European lawmakers have sufficiently aligned the applicable rules of both frameworks with each other. In the meantime practice develops where it seems that banks aim at issuing debt capital instruments aligned to avoid the application of the BRRD bail in mechanism, by introducing relative high triggers resulting into recapitalization of the bank at a very early stage and prior to recovery or resolution mechanisms become applicable to the bank...|$|E

40|$|Purpose – This study aims {{to examine}} the {{industry}} reaction as determined by stock returns when firms in the electric services industry announced receipt of <b>Going</b> <b>concern</b> audit opinions from 1984 through 1991. Design/methodology/approach – The study utilizes standard event study methodology to test for significant excess performance. Findings – From 1984 to 1991, going concern opinion (GCO) announcements produce a contagion response in the industry on the announcement date {{more than half the}} time. Also, over the event window of the announcement date plus the five days following, six of the seven announcements were accompanied by significant negative industry reaction. Regression analysis suggests non-announcing a firm's leverage and earnings correlation with the announcing firm significantly impact abnormal returns, as does the exchange on which the announcer's equity is traded, the size of the announcing firm and whether nuclear plant problems were mentioned in the announcement. Research limitations/implications – The findings suggest that audit opinions provide new information for investors in the electric services industry. Also, GCO announcements in this industry normally result in contagion among rival firms.

[...] Dept. of Economics. University of Missouri [...] Kansas City, 2013 This dissertation applies heterodox {{concepts of the}} social construction and allocation of resources in the provisioning process; the organization of going concerns in societies that are themselves going concerns; and the governance of markets, and production more generally, toward a heterodox theory of the firm. It is argued that, in contrast to extant theories of the firm, the boundaries of modern firms are {{not the result of}} processes of individual contracting in the face of transactions costs, or coterminous with knowledge-based resources. Rather, they are principally the product of the coevolution of business and technological practices, chiefly {{in the interest of the}} former over the latter. It is furthermore argued that this process, in a socioeconomic system defined by the firm as a hierarchy of going concerns, is more akin to the gerrymandering of congressional districts than to an efficient allocation of material transactions between the firm and market spheres. The history of the US software industry from the 1950 s through the 1990 s is provided as a case both illustrating and informing the theory. In particular, it is shown that this industry owes its structure, and indeed its existence, to the evolution of business strategies concerning the technological relationships surrounding the provision and use of computer systems. The industry's history corroborates the general hypotheses that (1) markets and firms themselves tend to be governed by the concerns operating therein; and (2) the resulting governance structures necessarily involve state sanctioning, including the administration of appropriate property rights over the relevant technological relationships.
