2500|$|Throughout {{four days}} of combat, {{including}} the initial breach of Iraqi lines and the battles of Al Busayyah and Medina Ridge, the unit conducted one of the US Army's largest artillery bombardments {{since the second world}} war. All totaled, 4-27 FA fired 588 M26 [...] "cluster bomb" [...] rockets into Iraqi forces and inflicted several thousand casualties in advance of 1st AD's armored assault. To put the scale of this bombardment in perspective, each rocket contained 644 DPICM bomblet submunitions, for a total of 378,672 warheads. Which is why US service members nickname these barrages [...] "steel rain." [...] While in practice many targets received multiple salvos and the submunitions had a 2â€“5% <b>dud</b> <b>rate,</b> if each rocket had been spaced out to maximize submunition blast radius, then the barrage would have theoretically [...] "sanitized" [...] a target area up to 49 square kilometers.|$|E
5000|$|Even though cluster {{bombs are}} {{designed}} to explode prior to or on impact, there are always some individual submunitions that do not explode on impact. The US-made MLRS with M26 warhead and M77 submunitions {{are supposed to have}} a 5% <b>dud</b> <b>rate</b> but studies have shown that some have a much higher rate. The rate in acceptance tests prior to the Gulf War for this type ranged from 2% to a high of 23% for rockets cooled to [...] before testing. The M483A1 DPICM artillery-delivered cluster bombs have a reported <b>dud</b> <b>rate</b> of 14%.|$|E
50|$|It {{was heavily}} criticized during the Second World War for {{its failure to}} quickly remedy the {{numerous}} issues with the Mark 14 torpedo which had an over 70% <b>dud</b> <b>rate.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Critics annihilated the record. David Browne of Entertainment Weekly, in an {{intensely}} scathing review, gave the album a D, calling it [...] "one {{of the most}} ridiculous albums ever released". Browne compared the album to The Best of Marcel Marceau, an album which consisted of two sides of silence opened by brief applause. According to Browne, Extremely Live [...] "affords you the chance to hear inane stage patter ... and unaccompanied drumming, during which, one assumes, Ice and his posse are onstage dancing." [...] A remorseless Robert Christgau gave the album a <b>dud</b> <b>rating,</b> which signifies [...] "a bad record whose details rarely merit further thought. At the upper level it may merely be overrated, disappointing, or dull. Down below it may be contemptible." [...] Allmusic reviewer Steve Huey wrote that the album is [...] "not so much awful as instantly forgettable".|$|R
500|$|Despite viewing it {{imperfect}} and noting Songz had not {{mastered the}} balancing act [...] "between being a horny boy and ladies' man", Mark Edward Nero of About.com {{said it was}} the best album of Songz's career, commenting, [...] "Trey takes a big step toward establishing himself as an A-list singer." [...] Nero also commended consistent vocals as a plus, and complimented the eclecticity of the songs, saying no tracks are unlistenable. Tyler Lewis of PopMatters said that Songz continued his tradition of inconsistent albums, commenting that the album is best is when it departs from the R. Kelly template. Lewis recommended that the album needed to be trimmed down and included with some from his mixtape Anticipation for what could have been, [...] "the black pop record of the year." [...] In his consumer guide for MSN Music, critic Robert Christgau gave to the album a <b>dud</b> (...) <b>rating,</b> indicating [...] "a bad record whose details rarely merit further thought. At the upper level it may merely be overrated, disappointing, or dull. Down below it may be contemptible". Ajitpaul Mangat of Tiny Mix Tapes called the album often [...] "generic" [...] and [...] "monotonous" [...] noting how Songz's work on freestyles and work ethic proves how the album could be better. Mangat did overall compliment the album, [...] "While Ready is far from a perfect album, it seems Trey is learning how to inspirit his original works with the charm and inventiveness found in his freestyles and covers." [...] The album earned Songz a Grammy Award nomination for Best Contemporary R Album in 2010.|$|R
50|$|The mines self-destruct after a {{preset time}} {{which can be}} set to 4 hours, 15 hours or 15 days. Any that do not will become {{disabled}} after 40 days when the batteries discharge fully. The self-destruct time is set just prior to aircraft takeoff using a simple selector switch on the dispenser. During the Gulf War the <b>dud</b> <b>rate</b> for this system was significant, in one of seven Kuwati battlefield sectors there were 205 BLU-91 and 841 BLU-92 duds. Given that 89,235 BLU-91 and 27,535 BLU-92 mines were used during the Gulf War, this represents a <b>dud</b> <b>rate</b> of somewhere between 0.5 and 2% for the BLU-91 and to 6 to 21% for the BLU-92. Additionally, Conventional Munition Systems Inc. mine field clearing personnel reported dud GATOR mines detonating with no apparent triggering event, and speculated that the extreme heat of the Kuwait desert may have triggered detonation.|$|E
50|$|The US {{military}} is developing new cluster bombs that it claims {{could have a}} much lower (less than 1%) <b>dud</b> <b>rate.</b> Sensor-fused weapons that contain {{a limited number of}} submunitions that are capable of autonomously engaging armored targets may provide a viable, if costly, alternative to cluster munitions that will allow multiple target engagement with one shell or bomb while avoiding the civilian deaths and injuries consistently documented from the use of cluster munitions. Certain such weapons may be allowed under the recently adopted Convention on Cluster Munitions, provided {{they do not have the}} indiscriminate area effects or pose the unexploded ordnance risks of cluster munitions.|$|E
5000|$|The {{rockets and}} ATACMS {{missiles}} {{are contained in}} interchangeable pods. Each pod contains six standard rockets or one guided ATACMS missile; the two types cannot be mixed. The LLM can hold two pods at a time, which are hand-loaded using an integrated winch system. All twelve rockets or two ATACMS missiles can be fired in under a minute. One launcher firing twelve rockets can completely blanket one square kilometer with submunitions. For this reason, the MLRS is {{sometimes referred to as}} the [...] "Grid Square Removal System" [...] (metric maps are usually divided up into 1 km grids). A typical MLRS cluster salvo consisted of three M270 vehicles each firing all 12 rockets. With each rocket containing 644 M77 grenades, the entire salvo would drop 23,184 grenades in the target area. However, with a two percent <b>dud</b> <b>rate,</b> that would leave approximately 400 undetonated bombs scattered over the area, which could endanger friendly troops and civilians.|$|E
50|$|U.S. {{arguments}} {{favoring the}} use of cluster munitions are that their use reduces the number of aircraft and artillery systems needed to support military operations {{and if they were}} eliminated, significantly more money would have to be spent on new weapons, ammunition, and logistical resources. Also, militaries would need to increase their use of massed artillery and rocket barrages to get the same coverage, which would destroy or damage more key infrastructures. The U.S. was initially against any CCW negotiations but dropped its opposition in June 2007. Cluster munitions have been determined as needed for ensuring the country's national security interests, but measures are being taken to address humanitarian concerns of their use, as well as pursuing their original suggested alternative to a total ban of pursuing technological fixes to make the weapons no longer viable after the end of a conflict. In July 2012, the U.S. fired at a target area with 36 Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) unitary warhead rockets. Analysis indicates that the same effects could have been made by four cluster GMLRS rockets. If cluster weapons cannot be used, the same operation would require using nine times as many rockets, cost nine times as much ($400,000 compared to $3.6 million), and take 40 times as long (30 seconds compared to 20 minutes) to execute. The U.S. suspended operational use of cluster munitions in 2003, and the U.S. Army ceased procurement of GMLRS cluster rockets in December 2008 because of a submunition <b>dud</b> <b>rate</b> as high as 5 percent. Pentagon policy is to have all cluster munitions used after 2018 to have a submunition unexploded ordnance rate of less than 1 percent. To achieve this, the Army has undertaken the Alternative Warhead Program (AWP) to assess and recommend technologies to reduce or eliminate cluster munition failures, as some 80 percent of U.S. military cluster weapons reside in Army artillery stockpiles.|$|E
40|$|The revolutionary insensitive, green, and {{healthier}} training technology with reduced adverse contamination (RIGHTTRAC) {{program is a}} 5 -year technology demonstration program (TDP) aimed at showing that green and insensitive munitions have better properties than current munitions, {{and that it is}} feasible to implement safer weapon solutions that would ease the environmental pressure on ranges and training areas and decrease the health hazards for the users. The goals of this TDP are to reach a near-zero <b>dud</b> <b>rate</b> and to eliminate the potential for research development explosive (RDX) contamination as well as the use of toxic and carcinogenic compounds. This will be done by performing significant improvements to the fuzing system, the main explosive charge and the gun propellant. The vehicle used for this demonstration is a 105 -mm army artillery munition (high-explosive Ml), currently filled with Composition B (a 60 : 40 RDX:TNT mix) and using a single-base gun propellant (Ml formulation). The aim of this communication is to provide an overview of the project and to describe the steps taken to evaluate the environmental properties of the chosen propellant and explosive formulations. At its completion, it is believed that this project will have provided the required data to assess the long-term effects of the munitions on the environment right at an early stage of the weapon development cycle, and that this can be cost effective in the long run. This will help sustain military training while preserving our resources, as well as shaping the future of weapon system development. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|E
