To be able to rapidly respond to such changing environments, <b>integration</b> of <b>software</b> systems has entered among the top priorities of many organizations. However, despite extended use of <b>software</b> <b>integration,</b> methods for estimating the business value of implementing such integration are still missing. Besides presenting a conceptual model to define the benefits of systems integration and related causal relationships, this study proposes a method for measuring such benefits in monetary terms. In particular, weÂ  demonstrate how a mathematical programming technique called Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) can be used to evaluate the business value of <b>software</b> <b>integration.</b> Our method is illustrated using data from 12 organizations. The results indicate significant productivity gains by integrating software systems, which represent the value of <b>software</b> <b>integration</b> in organizations...|$|R

40|$|Enterprise {{architecture}} frameworks {{define the}} goals of enterprise architecture {{in order to make}} business processes and IT operations more effective, and {{to reduce the risk of}} future investments. These enterprise architecture frameworks offer different architecture development methods that help in building enterprise architecture. In practice, the larger organizations become, the larger their enterprise architecture and IT become. This leads to an increasingly complex system of enterprise architecture development and maintenance. Application software architecture is one type of architecture that, along with business architecture, data architecture and technology architecture, composes enterprise architecture. From the perspective of integration, enterprise architecture can be considered a system of interaction between multiple examples of application software. Therefore, effective <b>software</b> <b>integration</b> is a very important basis for the future success of the enterprise architecture in question. This article will provide interface-based integration practice in order to help simplify the process of building such a <b>software</b> <b>integration</b> system.
