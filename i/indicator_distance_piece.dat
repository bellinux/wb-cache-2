Currently, the railway system of Sri Lanka {{does not have a}} correct system to monitor and indicate correct positions of trains. Therefore vehicle drivers and pedestrians imagine the location of trains and try to cross level crossings. Hence accidents happen at rail gates. A suitable security system should be arranged at rail gates. Hence this project is done to find the correct position of the train. The outcome of the research would provide a time <b>indicator</b> and a <b>distance</b> <b>indicator</b> are fixed at level crossings.

With an {{advent of the}} CCDs in astronomy, another <b>distance</b> <b>indicator</b> joins the primary <b>distance</b> <b>indicator</b> group. It is {{the tip of the}} red giant branch. The tip of the red giant branch (called as TRGB hereafter) seen in the color-magnitude diagrams of old stellar populations corresponds to the helium-flash stage in the evolution of low mass stars. It was recognized early by Baade and Sandage that the luminosity of the TRGB can be a potential <b>distance</b> <b>indicator.</b> The TRGB method had been sometimes used for estimating the distances to nearby galaxies since 1980 's. However, the accuracy of the TRGB method had not been known until Lee et al. (1993) showed that the luminosity of the TRGB at I-band is an excellent <b>distance</b> <b>indicator</b> for resolved galaxies (Lee et al. 1993).

In addition to Cepheids, RR Lyr and red clump stars, which photometry was presented in the earlier OGLE papers, we present the so far most accurate determination of brightness of the tip of the red giant branch in the LMC and SMC. We analyze the ratios of brightness of all four <b>distance</b> <b>indicators</b> in the LMC and SMC. Additionally, we include in our analysis, when possible, photometric data of the <b>distance</b> <b>indicators</b> in the metal poor Carina dwarf galaxy for which photometry was also {{collected during the}} OGLE-II experiment. The analysis is largely differential, free from zero point and extinction uncertainties. The main conclusion is that the distance scales resulting from all four stellar <b>distance</b> <b>indicators</b> are fully consistent with each other. Therefore the distance scale problem is not a problem resulting from different distances yielded by <b>distance</b> <b>indicators,</b> but rather a problem of the proper zero point of this common distance scale. All four stellar <b>distance</b> <b>indicators</b> have to be treated as an ensemble, and any determination of the zero point for one of them must predict reasonable luminosities of the others. This puts strong constraints on many proposed calibrations of <b>distance</b> <b>indicators.</b> For example, very bright calibrations of Cepheids or RR Lyr can practically be ruled out.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this report {{was to determine the}} effects of press temperature and pressing time on the density distribution of particleboards throughout the thickness, and to make clear the relation of the density distribution to the strength properties of these boards. Wood particle used in this experiment was splinter type (5 - 16 mesh) of Lauan. The bond used was phenol resin and its solid content was 6 % (OD) for weight of a particle-mat. <b>Distance</b> <b>piece</b> of 15 mm thick was used and press temperature was varied within the range of 130 to 190 °C, and pressing time 10 - 35 min. The density distribution of particleboard was measured by soft x-ray and densitometric method. The results obtained will be summarized as follows: (1) The percentages of thickness recovery of particleboards after hot-pressing decrease rapidly with increasing of pressing time as shown in Fig. 1, and critical pressing time is about 25 min for 130 °C of press temperature and about 15 min for 150 - 190 °C of press temperature. (2) The consolidation progress of each layer within particle-mat and the variation of density distribution of the particleboard through the thickness during hot-pressing are illustrated in Fig. 2 and 3. These figures indicate that the final type of density distribution of particleboards which are hot pressed with <b>distance</b> <b>piece</b> at the different press temperature in the range of 130 - 190 °C are not differ from each other. However, the density distribution of the particleboard which is hot-pressed without <b>distance</b> <b>piece</b> is differ from them (Fig. 4). (3) The bending strength of particleboards depend primarily on the density of the face (back), and so, the values are scarecely affected by press temperature and pressing time after the layers have been consolidated (Fig. 5). In contrast with this, the internal bonding strength depend chiefly on the density of the core layer, and so, the values are affected by the two factors till the consolidation progress of the layer has been completed (Fig. 6) ...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} impact of the four-quark dipenguin {{operator}} to the D 0 − ¯ D 0 mixing. It is shown to contribute to the short <b>distance</b> <b>piece</b> at the same order of magnitude as the box diagram. Typeset using REVTEX 1 The phenomenon of meson mixing has been studied for a long time. Observed in the K 0 − ¯ K 0 and B 0 − ¯ B 0 systems, it provides an extremely sensitive test of the Standard Model (SM) and essential for the CP violation in the neutral meson system. It is well known that because of the GIM cancellation mechanism and large mass of the top quark the short distance box diagram dominates in B 0 − ¯ B 0 system and constitutes a significant fraction of the K 0 − ¯ K 0 mixing amplitude. The case of D 0 − ¯ D 0 system is somewhat special: the b-quark contribution to the fermion loop of the box diagram providing ∆C = 2 transition is diminished by a tiny Vub CKM matrix element. Thus, only the light quark mass difference guarantees that mixing does take place. The effect vanishes in the limit of the SU(3) invariance. All of that results in the estimated value for ∆mD being of the order of 10 − 17 GeV if only short distance contributions are taken into account [1], [2].

40|$|The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) {{is widely}} {{considered}} {{as the first step}} of the cosmological distance ladder, since it contains many different <b>distance</b> <b>indicators.</b> An accurate determination of the distance to the LMC allows one to calibrate these <b>distance</b> <b>indicators</b> that are then used to measure the distance to far objects. The main goal of this thesis is to study the distance and structure of the LMC, as traced by different <b>distance</b> <b>indicators.</b> For these purposes three types of <b>distance</b> <b>indicators</b> were chosen: Classical Cepheids,"hot" eclipsing binaries and RR Lyrae stars. These objects belong to different stellar populations tracing, in turn, different sub-structures of the LMC. The RR Lyrae stars (age > 10 Gyr) are distributed smoothly and likely trace the halo of the LMC. Classical Cepheids are young objects (age 50 - 200 Myr), mainly located in the bar and spiral arm of the galaxy, while "hot" eclipsing binaries mainly trace the star forming regions of the LMC. Furthermore, we have chosen these <b>distance</b> <b>indicators</b> for our study, since the calibration of their zero-points is based on fundamental geometric methods.
