Using two events of financial distress – the Brazilian <b>Funding</b> <b>Loan</b> of 1898 and the Greek <b>Funding</b> <b>Loan</b> of 1893 – as quasi-natural experiments, we document that, following the crises, the bond prices of countries with no meaningful economic links to the distressed countries, but shared the same financial intermediary, suffered a reduction relative {{to the rest of the}} market. This result is true for the mean, median and the whole distribution of bond prices, and robust to an extensive sensitivity analysis. We interpret it as evidence that the identity of the financial intermediary was informative, i. e, investors extracted information about the soundness of a debtor based on the existence of financial relationships. This spillover, informational in essence, arises as the flip-side of the relational lending coin: contagion arises for the same reason why relational finance, in this case, underwriting, helps alleviate informational and incentive problems...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of one empirical essay on contagion (co-authored with Joao Manoel Pinho de Mello¹ and Marcelo de Paiva Abreu²). We document a novel type of international financial contagion whose driving force is shared financial intermediation. In the London peripheral sovereign debt market during pre- 1914 period financial intermediation {{played a major}} informational role to investors, given the absence of international monitoring agencies and substantial agency costs. Using a hand-collected dataset of weekly bond prices and borrower-underwriters relationships in the pre- 1914 London market for sovereign debt, we explore two events of financial distress - the Brazilian <b>Funding</b> <b>Loan</b> of 1898 and the Greek <b>Funding</b> <b>Loan</b> of 1893 - as quasi-natural experiments to contagion by shared underwriter. Following the two crises, bond prices of countries that shared the same merchant bank dropped by some 3. 5 % relative {{to the rest of}} the market. This result is true for the mean, median and the whole distribution of bond prices, and robust to an extensive sensitivity analysis. Two theoretical explanations can rationalize this phenomenon: information spillovers and portfolio realignment. by Antonio Carlos de Azevedo Sodre. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|This paper {{shows that}} banks that {{increase}} {{their use of}} short-term funding engage in less maturity transformation {{in an attempt to}} decrease their exposure to rollover risk. These banks shorten both the maturity of newly issued loans as well as the maturity of their portfolio of loans. We also find that the loan yield curve becomes steeper with banks’ increasing use of short-term funding. The loan maturity shortening is driven by banks and affects borrowers ’ financing choices—they turn to the bond market for long-term funding. To the extent that borrowers do not manage to compensate for the undesirable shortening of loan maturities by going to the bond market, they may become more exposed to rollover risk due to banks. This potential synchronization of banks ’ and borrowers ’ rollover risk can be a source of financial instability once short-term funding suddenly disappears.

40|$|Two {{roads to}} promote the {{development}} of a democratic culture in Veliky Novgorod in post-Soviet Russia are described. The development of home owner partnerships in the city means privatisation of apartment houses which previously were state property. This required considerable support from city administration to establish both <b>funding,</b> <b>loan</b> and proper economic and administrative routines. Educational programmes were run to develop the competence needed among those to work in the new partnerships. Responsibility for the houses as well as surrounding territory resulted in considerably improved housing conditions. These included effective sharing of common property, better and cheaper maintenance and services, and a better social situation. Secondly the creation of a folk high school or "Peoples university" in Novgorod, in cooperation with the Swedish city of Örebro, is described. Also here the focus is on democratisation especially in practical life. The subjects studied include new communication technologies, foreign languages, and political education. The promotion of culture is important. The education also has a goal to promote employment, e. g. in public health, services or environmental work...|$|E
40|$|The {{history of}} Brazilian {{accounting}} {{has not been}} explored at length. Through a historical survey, this article presents {{the history of the}} Double-entry Bookkeeping Committee of 1914. After the Proclamation of the Republic was announced in 1889, the government started to expand its administrative bodies, necessitating the introduction of a bureaucracy able to perform new functions. In the same period, Brazil experienced a strong economic development with the development of its coffee industry. In 1905, under the leadership of Carlos de Carvalho, São Paulo State Treasury bookkeeping tasks were introduced under a double-entry bookkeeping system and through accrual and financial accounting. Double-entry bookkeeping practices in the federal public accounting system, although enshrined in law since 1808, were only fully realized after the creation of the Double-entry Bookkeeping Committee in 1914. In that same year, due to the negotiation of a second <b>funding</b> <b>loan,</b> English creditor bank auditors requested a balance of the National Treasury from the Minister of Finance Rivadávia Corrêa. Because the balance had not been prepared in eight years, the Double-entry Bookkeeping Committee was established in June of 1914, and this body completed a technical audit of Revenues and Expenditures. The committee also conducted the state administration's first Asset and Liability audit since the colonial era. The Double-entry Bookkeeping Committee of 1914 spearheaded changes to the Brazilian public accounting system, including the creation of the Public Accounting Code in 1922 and the approval of Central Accounting Office of the Republic regulation in 1924, strengthening and ascribing perpetuity to practices adopted after 1914...|$|E
