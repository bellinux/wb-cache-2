25|$|With his assault {{schedule}} {{thrown out}} of whack by the PAVN, and his troops consequently in trouble, Vang Pao went looking for help. On 1 September, he made an <b>emergency</b> <b>flight</b> to Vientiane for a tense meeting with Ambassador G. McMurtrie Godley at the airfield. Hoping to cadge more air support, the general blamed a shortage of tactical air for the offensive's lack of success. From Godley's standpoint, the Hmong unit commanders left much to be desired for combat leadership of a force crippled by trench foot. The ambassador {{made it clear that}} U.S. tactical air support was limited to 18 daily sorties. He then asked if Vang Pao would continue the offensive on those terms. At this, Vang Pao returned to battle, knowing that saving Long Tieng was essential for the Royalists.|$|E

One Vietnamese public servant said that [...] "All these preparations are the result of a big misunderstanding on both sides.

[...] Taylor was on an <b>emergency</b> <b>flight</b> from Honolulu—where he had been in meetings with senior American military figures—back to Saigon and he said the coup [...] "certainly was unannounced and unheralded."

500|$|Inspired by {{this early}} success, Kubrick {{quit his job}} at Look and visited {{professional}} filmmakers in New York City, asking many detailed questions about {{the technical aspects of}} film-making. He stated that he was given the confidence during this period to become a filmmaker {{because of the number of}} bad films he had seen, remarking, [...] "I don't know a goddamn thing about movies, but I know I can make a better film than that". He began making Flying Padre (1951), a film which documents Reverend Fred Stadtmueller, who travels some 4,000 miles to visit his 11 churches. The film was originally going to be called [...] "Sky Pilot", a pun on the slang term for a priest. [...] During the course of the film, the priest performs a burial service, confronts a boy bullying a girl, and makes an <b>emergency</b> <b>flight</b> to aid a sick mother and baby into an ambulance. Several of the views from and of the plane in Flying Padre are later echoed in [...] (1968) with the footage of the spacecraft, and a series of close-ups on the faces of people attending the funeral were most likely inspired by Sergei Eisenstein's Battleship Potemkin (1925) and Ivan the Terrible (1944/1958).|$|E

UFM officials said they appeared only as a courtesy and not to negotiate. [...] At the end of the two-and-a-half hour meeting, at which BCTD and Nabakowski representatives also appeared, Locher ruled that the August 4 agreement permitted Foster to submit an application for membership in the sheet metal workers union only by following regular procedures. [...] This required him to wait until August 28 to submit his application. Under union rules, this would allow the union executive board to consider his application on September 4, and (if successful before the board) for the membership to vote on his membership on September 11. UFM leaders were divided on whether to accept Locher's reading of the agreement. After a one-and-a-half hour membership meeting on August 19, they agreed to postpone any decision on picketing until after the September 11 union membership meeting.|$|E
