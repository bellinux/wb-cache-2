40|$|Abstract: The {{insulation}} {{systems are}} subjected to different exploitation <b>stresses.</b> There are <b>electrical</b> <b>stresses</b> due to the time dependence and spatial distribution of the electric field. A differentiation {{has to be made}} between sinusoidal (power network) and pulsed stresses. In spite of the overvoltages (lightning and switching) they are also a result of power converters. The power converters technology leads to different and higher <b>electrical</b> <b>stresses</b> in machine windings insulation and cable terminations. Then the interfaces in insulation systems generally consist of combination of conducting, semiconducting and insulation materials adjacent to each other. A criterion for the <b>electrical</b> <b>stresses</b> in insulation systems are partial discharges which occur at these interfaces.
