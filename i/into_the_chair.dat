5|$|Morsell {{found it}} {{challenging}} to film a scene {{near the end}} of the game, in which Adrienne is pleading with Don while getting strapped <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> with a guillotine overhead. Several different versions of the scene had to be filmed, and Morsell said it was difficult for her to work up the genuine emotion she needed take after take. The torture devices featured in the game were scale models made by local craftsmen. During one scene, the mansion roof starts to collapse, causing beams and chunks of debris to fall around the actors. To achieve this, the crew built lightweight beams out of hollow cardboard, which had to fall in the correct sequence. In another scene, Adrienne crawls along a water pipe that breaks. To film the scene without damaging equipment, the crew built a giant plastic box with a plastic tray underneath for the shoot. Three hoses ran through the pipe so water would spray in multiple directions.|$|E
25|$|The Hollys (Hardcore and Crash) {{versus the}} New Age Outlaws (Billy Gunn and The Road Dogg) was next. In {{the midst of}} the match, Hardcore Holly threw a steel chair into the ring. Billy Gunn, however, used the chair to his {{advantage}} by performing an offense maneuver on Crash Holly that caused his head to slam <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> which was lying in the ring. Therefore, the Hollys won the match by disqualification.|$|E
25|$|In the 1830s rolled T-shaped (or single-flanged T {{parallel}} rail) and I-shaped (or double-flanged T parallel or bullhead) rails were introduced; both required cast-iron {{chairs to}} support them. Originally, iron keys {{were used to}} wedge the rail into the vertical parallel jaws of the chair; these were superseded by entirely wooden keys. The wooden keys were formed from oak, steam softened and then compressed with hydraulic presses and stored in a drying house. When inserted <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair,</b> exposure to the wet atmosphere caused the key to expand, firmly holding the rail. The wedge {{may be on the}} inside or outside of the rail. In Britain they were usually on the outside.|$|E
50|$|The {{game was}} {{presented}} in two styles of cabinets: an upright standup, and a sit-down/semi-enclosed deluxe cabinet with <b>the</b> players <b>chair</b> modeled after <b>the</b> Star Trek Motion Pictures bridge chairs with controls integrated <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>chairs</b> arms.|$|R

500|$|The primary {{composition}} of the painting is in {{the contrast between the}} solemn jester (Stańczyk)– obviously the focus of the painting– and the lively ball going on in the background. Stańczyk is shown sitting alone in a dark room, while a ball, hosted by the royal family, is in full swing in the neighbouring hall. His appearance is unlike that one would expect in a jester– gloomy, deep in thought. His seriousness is reinforced by his accessories: his marotte lies discarded on the floor, whereas a holy medallion of the Black Madonna of Częstochowa can be seen on his torso. The wrinkled carpet at Stanczyk's feet could have been formed by his collapsing heavily <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> upon reading the letter, or through a nervous shifting of the feet thereafter. On the table lies a letter likely announcing that Poland has lost Smolensk (now in Russia) to the Grand Duchy of Muscovy, causing Stańczyk's sorrow and reflection on his fatherland's fate. The letter seems to have been discarded by some official, and only the jester realizes its significance– while the rulers are partying, celebrating the recent victory at the battle of Orsha, disregarding the bad news about Smolensk. [...] It {{is interesting to note that}} the letter bears the year 1533 (A.d. MDXXXIII) and the name [...] "Samogitia", a province of the Commonwealth. [...] The note is incongruent with the actual date of the fall of Smolensk in 1514, and is a matter of ongoing debate, with an outright mistake by the meticulous Matejko, known for use of symbolism and iconography, being unlikely. [...] Another symbol, a lute, symbol of glory, is being carried by a midget, stereotyped as a person of low stature and morale in Matejko's time; this suggests a decline of the Jagiellon dynasty's fortunes. The window is thrown - or was blown - open, ruffling the tablecloth and alluding to an upset of the present order. [...] Through the open window, the darkened profile of Wawel Cathedral in Krakow is visible - the site of the coronation of Polish kings. [...] Next to it, a comet is seen– a portent of ill fortune. [...] The imagery of downfall is completed with the inclusion of the three stars of Orion's Belt seen above and to the left of the cathedral spire. [...] In Greek mythology, Orion was a powerful hunter blinded by ego and his own greatness, but was ultimately brought down by the pinprick of a scorpion's sting.|$|E
2500|$|The modern {{movement}} of the 1960s produced new forms of chairs: the butterfly chair (originally called the Hardoy chair), bean bags, and the egg-shaped pod chair that turns. It also introduced the first mass-produced plastic chairs such as the Bofinger chair in 1966. Technological advances led to molded plywood and wood laminate chairs, as well as chairs made of leather or polymers. Mechanical technology incorporated <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> enabled adjustable chairs, especially for office use. [...] Motors embedded in the chair resulted in massage chairs.|$|E
2500|$|The tour's {{rendition}} of [...] "Rope Burn" [...] was considered [...] "incredibly sexy" [...] and [...] "what everyone was talking about", becoming its most controversial performance. During the act, Jackson [...] "plucks a male fan {{out of the}} crowd and ties his hands to the arms of a chair on stage while she gyrates around him and eventually kisses him." [...] The selected fan was required to be strapped <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> due to safety concerns from Jackson's previous tour, after the participant had forcefully grabbed and fondled her while onstage. Jackson said, [...] "Everyone thinks it's this kinky thing. But the reason he gets strapped in is on this last tour, this guy grabbed my crotch. I sat on his lap and then I stood up and he grabbed my crotch, and I was trying to move his hand and he was too strong for me and he was just rubbing on my crotch. There was nothing I could do, so I said to myself I would never let that happen again." [...] Jackson's performance of [...] "What About" [...] is also infamous for its portrayal of domestic violence and abuse. The tour's [...] "racy" [...] costumes were designed by fashion designer David Cardona, who commented [...] "All her life it's been about Janet being cute. Now it's about Janet being sexy." ...|$|E
