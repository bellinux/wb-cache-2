Some finer models had spigots for draining ice water from a catch pan or holding tank. In cheaper models a <b>drip</b> <b>pan</b> was placed under the box and had to be emptied at least daily.

50|$|This {{design is}} similar to smoking with {{indirect}} heat due to {{the distance from the}} coals and the racks (typically 24 in). The temperatures used for smoking are controlled by limiting the amount of air intake {{at the bottom of the}} drum, and allowing a similar amount of exhaust out of vents in the lid. UDSs are very efficient with fuel consumption and flexible in their abilities to produce proper smoking conditions, with or without the use of a water pan or <b>drip</b> <b>pan.</b> Most UDS builders/users would say a water pan defeats the true pit BBQ nature of the UDS, as the drippings from the smoked meat should land on the coals, burning up, and imparting a unique flavor one cannot get with a water pan.|$|E

Fragments of the Great Gate (circa. 1200 AD) exist in a rearranged form adjacent to the east end of St John’s Church. The destruction of the walls has continued in recent years following the grant of Planning Permission by Lewes District Council to Lewes Football Club to demolish a section of the longest surviving extent of the structure along Ham Lane in 2006 for unrealised business objectives whilst a further adjacent length subsequently delaminated and fell in 2008 with repairs started in late 2009.|$|R

40|$|DOD) pollution-prevention {{procedures}} require {{cleanup of}} spills {{of any size}} or volume. Army vehicle maintenance shops typically use <b>drip</b> <b>pans</b> and absorbing materials, mostly clay-based compounds, to clean up spills. The use of absorbents (sorbents) to clean spills is the preferred alternative by DOD and Army installations. The U. S. Army Construction Engineering Research Laboratory (CERL) conducted this study to evaluate and summarize {{the properties of the}} many commercially available absorbing materials. This study concludes that no single solution exists to control oil drips and clean up small oil spills at Army motor pools. Most installations require a combination of <b>drip</b> <b>pans,</b> sorption pads, and sorbing loose material. The study further found that: 1. While election of sorbents is specific to installation and application, in general, cellulose products are the best choice, followed by synthetic products. 2. Disposal of the saturated sorbents is a critical factor in selecting sorbents. Regulatory requirements and cost are key elements in deciding disposal procedures. 3. Training is required for all Army staff on characteristics of different products and their applications to avoid wrong applications that may result in environmental problems...|$|R
