40|$|To {{reduce the}} exergy loss that {{is caused by}} the {{high-grade}} extraction steam of traditional heating mode of combined heat and power (CHP) generating unit, a high back-pressure cascade heating technology for two jointly constructed large-scale steam turbine power generating units is proposed. The Unit 1 makes full use of the exhaust steam heat from high back-pressure turbine, and the Unit 2 uses the original heating mode of extracting steam condensation, which significantly reduces the flow rate of high-grade extraction steam. The typical 2 × 350 MW supercritical CHP units in northern China were selected as object. The boundary conditions for heating were determined based on the actual climatic conditions and heating demands. A model to analyze the performance of the high back-pressure cascade heating supply units for off-design operating conditions was developed. The load distributions between high back-pressure exhaust steam direct supply and extraction steam heating supply were described under various conditions, based on which, the heating efficiency of the CHP units with the high back-pressure cascade heating system was analyzed. The <b>design</b> <b>heating</b> <b>load</b> and maximum <b>heating</b> supply <b>load</b> were determined as well. The results indicate that the average coal consumption rate during the heating season is 205. 46 g/kWh for the <b>design</b> <b>heating</b> <b>load</b> after the retrofit, which is about 51. 99 g/kWh lower than that of the traditional heating mode.

40|$|Spacecraft {{radiators}} are sized {{for their}} maximum heat load in their warmest thermal environment, but must operate at reduced heat loads and in colder environments. For systems where the radiator environment can be colder than the working fluid freezing temperature, radiator freezing becomes an issue. Radiator freezing {{has not been}} a major issue for the Space Shuttle and the International Space Station (ISS) active thermal control systems (ATCSs) because they operate in environments that are warm relative to the freezing point of their external coolants (Freon- 21 and ammonia, respectively). For a vehicle that lands at the Lunar South Pole, the design thermal environment is 215 K, but the radiator working fluid must also be kept from freezing during the 0 K sink of transit. A radiator bypass flow control design such as those used on the Space Shuttle and ISS requires more than 30 % of the <b>design</b> <b>heat</b> <b>load</b> to avoid radiator freezing during transit - even with a very low freezing point working fluid. By changing the traditional ATCS architecture to include a regenerating heat exchanger inboard of the radiator and by using a regenerator bypass flow control valve to maintain system setpoint, the required minimum heat load can be reduced by more than half. This gives the spacecraft much more flexibility in design and operation. The present work describes the regenerator bypass ATCS setpoint control methodology. It includes analytical results comparing the performance of this system to the traditional radiator bypass system. Finally, a summary of the advantages of the regenerator bypass system are presented...|$|E

40|$|This is the 20 th article {{based on}} a recent DOE report cover-ing {{energy-saving}} HVAC technologies. Air-source heat pumps (ASHP) are air conditioners with a reversing valve and a few additional components that allow the vapor cycle to pump heat either out of the conditioned space (cooling) or into the conditioned space (heating). The resulting cost increase is small compared to an air conditioner with electric resistance heating and {{much less than the}} additional cost of a gas furnace.

As some design limitations are faced related to the maximum heat flux able to be managed by LHPs, improvements on their capillary evaporator design can result on a gain on its capability of heat management along with a substantial decrease on the heat source temperature, which is very desirable, as well as the use of alternative working fluids.

This paper describes the initial phase of project SCENIC, achieving truly distributed generation within a heat network. The first of its kind, the system has a four pipe network configuration, consisting of a network flow loop to supply heat to homes, and a generation loop to collect energy from residential heating systems and supply it to a centralised thermal store. To achieve the design, IES-VE steady state <b>heat</b> <b>load</b> and dynamic building modelling have been used. A pre-insulated Rehau Rauthermex piping diameter was sized using flow rate calculations. Pipe diameter is reduced in line with distance from the central pump and associated pressure losses. The diameter ranges from 40 to 25 mm, with a heat loss as low as 7. 0 W/m. In addition, flow rates will fluctuate below a maximum of 1. 99 l/s.
