5000|$|The Glen Mountains Layered Complex (GMLC), {{thought to}} be the oldest surface unit of the aulacogen, covers roughly 2000 square {{kilometers}} and has several major units, including plagioclase cumulate, plagioclase-olivine-pyroxene, and plagioclase-pyroxene overlying a layer of plagioclase-olivine cumulate. The plagioclase crystals found in this area contain a proportion of anorthite much higher than the average content for massif-type anorthosites. On average, plagioclase ranges from An40 to An65 in massif-type anorthosites. In the plagioclase crystals from the GMLC, the anorthite content is, on average, An70 and ranges from An57 to An80. The rocks from this area generally have much more aluminium oxide and calcium oxide, and less silicon dioxide and sodium oxide than average massifs, which is related to the anorthosite content. Large clinopyroxene crystals (10s of centimeters) are found in this area, as well as in both cumulate and intercumulate phases, though intercumulate clinopyroxene is more rare. The Roosevelt Gabbros are a small sequence of biotite-bearing, hydrous gabbro plutons and dikes that intrude on the Glen Mountains Layered Complex. These plutons contain various distinct layers, such as iron-rich, biotite-hornblende-quartz diorites, tonalite layers, and olivine gabbro layers. Pegmatites displaying <b>deuteric</b> alteration are also present. These characteristics are congruous with shallow, hydrous gabbroic magma. However, this is at odds with the Glen Mountains Layered Complex, and thus it is hypothesized that the two subgroups formed from separate magmatic bodies, one of which being anhydrous and the other of which being hydrous.|$|E

These similarities are consistent with a mineral assemblage on Mars consisting of ferric-bearing phyllosilicate, sulfate, and oxyhydroxide phases.

40|$|Charge {{contrast}} imaging in {{the scanning}} electron microscope can provide {{new insights into the}} scale and composition of alkali feldspar microtextures, and such information helps considerably with the interpretation of their geological histories and results of argon isotope thermochronological analyses. The effectiveness of this technique has been illustrated using potassium-rich alkali feldspars from the Dartmoor granite (UK). These feldspars contain strain-controlled lamellar crypto- and microperthites that are cross-cut by strain-free <b>deuteric</b> microperthites. The constituent albite- and orthoclase-rich phases of both microperthite generations can be readily distinguished by atomic number contrast imaging. The charge contrast results additionally show that sub-micrometre-sized albite ‘platelets’ are commonplace between coarser exsolution lamellae and occur together to make cryptoperthites. Furthermore, charge contrast imaging reveals that the orthoclase-rich feldspar is an intergrowth of two phases, one that is featureless with uniform contrast and another that occurs as cross-cutting veins and grains with the { 110 } adularia habit. Transmission electron microscopy shows that the featureless feldspar is tweed orthoclase, whereas the veins and euhedral grains are composed of irregular microcline that has formed from orthoclase by ‘unzipping’ during <b>deuteric</b> or hydrothermal alteration. The charge contrast imaging results are especially important in demonstrating that <b>deuteric</b> perthites are far more abundant in alkali feldspars than would be concluded from investigations using conventional microscopy techniques. The unexpected presence of such a high volume of replacement products has significant implications for understanding the origins and geological histories of crustal rocks and the use of alkali feldspars in geo- and thermochronology. Whilst the precise properties of feldspars that generate contrast remain unclear, the similarity between charge contrast images and corresponding cathodoluminescence images of <b>deuteric</b> microperthites indicates that trace element chemistry and possibly also elastic strain within the crystal play a major role...|$|E

40|$|Cryptoperthitic alkali feldspars {{within the}} Proterozoic Klokken syenite have been pervasively altered deuterically to patch perthites whose {{constituent}} subgrains display very fine-scale zoning in optical cathodoluminescence (CL). Electron-probe analyses and hyperspectral maps were acquired from several areas of patch perthite to potentially identify the centers responsible for CL emission and to access {{information that the}} subgrains might provide about the late-stage geological evolution of the pluton. Each hyperspectral map is composed {{of tens of thousands}} of CL spectra covering a wavelength range of 350 - 850 nm, and images can be formed from any desired wavelength band. The patch perthite subgrains have two emission bands: one in the blue (similar to 460 nm) and the other at red to infrared wavelengths (similar to 690 - 725 nm). Cathodoluminescence images formed using both bands show that the optically visible zoning is developed only at blue wavelengths. Comparisons of emission intensities with electron-probe analyses show that the blue band is activated by Ti 3 + and less than similar to 25 ppm of the trace element is required for optically detectable luminescence. Adjacent Ab- and Or-rich subgrains can have identical patterns of zoning at blue wavelengths, indicating that they crystallized from the <b>deuteric</b> fluid simultaneously, but in most cases, differences in zoning within any one area of patch perthite indicate that subgrains grew at different times and slowly relative to the frequent changes in concentrations of Ti within the <b>deuteric</b> fluid. The red to infrared CL emission band is inferred to be activated by Fe 3 +. Ab-rich feldspar with the greatest intensities of long-wavelength emission and FeO concentrations crystallized from a late-stage and relatively low-T fluid that obtained a proportion of its Fe from mafic grains. The generally poor correlation between variations in intensities of the two emission bands within any one subgrain indicates that concentrations of Ti and Fe in the <b>deuteric</b> fluid varied independently of each other, and one trace element has no sensitizing or quenching effect on emission from the other center. The maximum length of zones within individual subgrains (similar to 0. 5 mm) and maximum separation of subgrains with similar zoning patterns (similar to 1 mm) helps to constrain the length and interconnectivity of the thin films of <b>deuteric</b> fluid that mediated alteration...|$|E

40|$|The {{alteration}} {{state of}} basalt lavas {{is shown to}} be largely {{the result of the}} combined action of two alteration processes, <b>deuteric</b> oxidation and regional hydrothermal alteration. The former process is well des-cribed in the literature while the latter is shown here to be another widespread source of lava alteration. The environment of regional hydro-thermal alteration is that of the zeolite metamorphic facies, with tempera-tures of up to 300 °C, and abundant groundwater being the major elements. Independent and rapid spatial variation of the two alteration processes results in the wide range of observed lava properties. Micro-scopically undetectable titanomagnetite alteration, indicated by steady rise in strong field Curie point, is the first response of a non-deuterically oxidized basalt to regional hydrothermal alteration. With more extreme alteration, titanohematite etc. is seen to pseudomorph titanomagnetite grains. Ilmenite also shows very distinctive mineralogical changes. Initially, high <b>deuteric</b> oxidation specimens appear to be immune mag-netically to moderate alteration but these too eventually succumb when conditions are extreme enough for the formation of prehnite in the rock. The geophysical implications of this widespread post eruption lava alteration process is discussed. We conclude that it is probably possible to obtain information on the original TRM of basalts at least in many cases but that the implications for potassium-argon dating need serious investigation. 1...|$|E
40|$|Reactions between olivine and {{plagioclase}} form kelyphytic corona textures in the Rymmen gabbro, southern Sweden. The coronas surround olivine and {{consist of}} enstatite + amphibole and phlogopite, {{combined with an}} outer rim of symplectic intergrowth of green spinel and amphibole. Corona reactions took place in fractures within olivine prior {{to the formation of}} chlorite, serpentine, and magnetite in the fractures at cooler conditions. Disequilibrium between olivine and plagioclase has been put forward as an explanation for the corona formation. However, inclusions of plagioclase in olivine show that there is no reaction between these minerals, since no new minerals formed between them. The conclusion drawn is that the most important factor for development of kelyphytic structures in the Rymmen gabbro is contact with a late <b>deuteric</b> fluid in an environment where olivine and plagioclase are close to each other. Temperature estimates for the formation of the kelyphytic coronas in the Rymmen gabbro yield consistent temperatures of around 800 + 308 C and pressures 6 ÿ 8 kbar, which indicate emplacement at a depth of 20 ÿ 30 km in the crust. Late <b>deuteric</b> fluids caused olivine replacement by intergrown orthopyroxene and magnetite, in Fe-Ti oxide-rich rocks only. In these, plagioclase is replaced by symplectite when in contact with ilmenite and magnetite. It is noted that the symplectite minerals have low Ti contents. This suggests that the Fe-Ti oxide was a catalyst for the reaction between plagioclase and late-stage aqueous fluids rather than being a reactant, alternatively that the magnetite/ilmenite was a reactant and Ti was retained in the oxide...|$|E

The composition of Ardglen todorokite is somewhat simpler than previously recorded occurrences, nmst {{of which were}} in manganese and manganese-b~se-metal ore deposits. The simpler composition is {{explained in terms of}} its occurrence as a late <b>deuteric</b> mineral associated with manganocalcite and zeolites in an altered Tertiary basalt.

T ODOROKITE has a variable composition of the general form (Mn ~+, X) (Mn 4 +) a 07. 2 [...] x H 20, where X represents various arrange-ments of Zn, Mg, Ba, Sr, Ca, Cu, Pb, Na 2, K s.

An {{attempt was made}} to calculate the structural formula, and the results of X-ray, differential thermal and electron diffraction analyses are given. During an investigation of the alteration products of beryl from the Dernburg peg-matite, Karibib, South West Africa (Roering & Heckroodt, 1964), a mineral with a 30 A spacing was detected in the fine fraction. The responses of reflections, attributed to this mineral, to treatment with organic liquids indicated that the mineral is of an expanding lattice type. The fine fraction was subsequently beneficiated in an attempt to obtain a pure sample for a detailed investigation. The altered beryl occurs in a pegmatite located in quartzites of the Damara System. It has been mined for beryl, amblygonite, and tantalite. Replacement bodies consisting of lithium-bearing mica and albite also occur, with or without cleave-landite-rich borders. The altered beryl occurs where these cleavelandite-rich borders abut against he beryl in the central zone of the pegmatite. From field relationships it would appear that this alteration was caused by <b>deuteric</b> pegmatite solutions intimately associated with the formation of the lithium mica-bearing replacement zones and their cleavelandite-rich margins. PREPARATION OF SAMPLE Two small specimens of highly altered beryl were crushed in an iron pestle and mortar, and any contaminating iron was removed by means of a strong magnet.

40|$|We {{document}} a new {{and unusual}} occurrence of patterns of protruding spheroidal weathering developed in a dunitic rock of the Pados-Tundra mafic-ultramafic complex of Early Proterozoic age, Kola Peninsula, Russia. It provides an example similar to that reported recently from a mineralized harzburgite in the Monchepluton layered complex in the same region. These patterns are genetically different from common results of “normal spheroidal weathering” sensu stricto. The spheroidally weathered dunite at Pados-Tundra consists of a high-Fo olivine, Ol (Fo 87. 5), which is, in fact, not altered. Accessory grains of aluminous chromite are present. Relief spheroids (1. 5 to 4 cm in diameter; up to ~ 5 vol. %) are distributed sparsely and heterogeneously. They are hosted by the olivine matrix and composed of talc, Tlc, and tremolite, Tr, (Mg# = 95 - 96) formed presumably {{at the expense of}} orthopyroxene, Opx, (i. e., pre-existing oikocrysts) during a <b>deuteric</b> (autometasomatic) alteration. In contrast, oikocrystic Opx (En 86. 0) is quite fresh in related spheroids at Monchepluton, in which only minor <b>deuteric</b> alteration (Tlc + Tr) are observed. We infer that (1) the ball-shaped morphology of the weathered surface {{is a reflection of the}} presence of oikocrysts of Opx, which crystallized after Ol at the magmatic stage; they were entirely replaced by the deuterically induced Tlc + Tr at Pados-Tundra. (2) Differential rates of weathering are implied for rock-forming minerals in these ultramafic rocks, with a higher resistance of Opx vs. Fo-rich Ol, and Tlc + Tr vs. Fo-rich Ol.

Geochemical evolution was controlled by restricted eutectic fractionation in a periodically replenished magma chamber. The basalts are of a 'transitional' nature between typical alkali or tholeiitic types. The basalts are not'barren' with regard to mineralisation but fundamental changes {{in the style of}} mineralisation within basalt hosts are noted. Hydrothermal interactions result in zoned wall-rock alteration the development of which correlates with the attainment of wall-rock diffusion equilibrium, while geochemical variations correspond with fluid-inclusion data. K-Ar isotopic dating indicate complex relationships, with devitrification and smectite replacement of interstitial phases resulting in systematic argon loss. Samples yielding true stratigraphic ages can only be selected on an empirical basis. <b>Deuteric</b> smectite phases persist during incipient hydrothermal alteration and exert an older 'contaminating' influence resulting in a spread of 'apparent' ages. This is negated during 'advanced' -alteration reflecting in relative potassium saturations and resolves the spread of ages into two distinct mineralising events at 240 5 m. y. and 170 ± 5 m. y. These correlate with widespread episodes of Mesozoic mineralisation in the United Kingdom. The Sills and Lavas are consanguineous, it is envisaged that replenishment of a number of shallow magma chambers was accompanied by ascensive injections of magma which in places reached the surface as extrusive lavas, but elsewhere formed high-level Sills often localised by intrusion along the 'line of weakness' afforded by older Lava interfaces...|$|E
40|$|Ilmenite and {{magnetite}} are investigated {{from the}} point of view of their distribution, micro-texture, and chemical composition (major and minor elements) in the Bjerkreim-Sokndal massif (Egersund area, South-Rogaland, SW. Norway). This massif is an igneous layered lopolith made up of cumulates of the anorthosite-mangerite suite. The lower part of the massif presents a rhytmic structure. The microtextures of ilmenite result from simple exsolution of ilmenite-hematite solid solution. Magnetite contains intergrowths of ilmenite formed by oxidation-exsolution of ulvöspinel-magnetite solid-solution. In the stratigraphic sequence, on a large scale, ilmenite appears first alone, and is then accompanied by magnetite; its hematite content decreases towards the top of the massif, while the titanium content of the magnetite increases. On the scale of the rhythms, similar trends but of a lesser amplitude are also observed. Evidence of <b>deuteric</b> readjustment of the orthomagmatic composition of the two oxides is provided (1) by the observation of microtextures at the contact betwen grains (zoning of primary ilmenite and rim of secondary ilmenite) (2) by the existence of differences in chemical composition between isolated grains and grains in contact, and (3) bythe determination of the equilibrium temperature by means of the Buddington and Lindsley geothermonmeter. Reconstruction of the T-fO 2 orthomagmatic conditions is provided in two particular levels of the massif shows that the reducing character of the magma increases during differentiation. The sudden changes in the oxide assembalge at the base of the rythmic units reflect a sudden increase in the fO 2 of the magma. These increases, as shown by variation in Cr, Ni and Co, are due to recurrences of the basic character of the magma. The variations of the minor elements Mn, V, Ga, and Zn are interpreted in terms of the influence of the <b>deuteric</b> readjustment. It follows that the ratios Mn/Fe 2 +; Ga/Fe 3 +, and Zn/Fe 2 + increase and that the ratio V/Fe 3 + decreases in the magma in the course of differentiation. The distribution of Mn between ilmenite and magnetite is discussed. Intermittent supplies of undifferentiated magma are proposed as the geological mechanism controlling the chemical recurrencess associated with the rhythmic structure. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Among the {{dominant}} species of chromium, the trivalent form widely occurs in nature in chromite ores or in silicate minerals and is extremely immobile. The higher oxidation state Cr(VI), is, however, rarely found in nature, is more mobile, and several times more toxic than Cr(III). Cr(VI) occurs in {{chromates and dichromates}} manufactured from chromite ores. The hexavalent state is stable in an oxidizing alkaline environment, whereas the trivalent state is stable in a reducing acidic environment. Serpentinization and Mg release during <b>deuteric</b> alteration of ultramafic rocks create alkaline pore water and lateritization is an intensive oxidation process. Chromite ore bodies in oxidized serpentinite therefore may generate hexavalent chromium from the inert chromites and cause hazardous chromium pollution of the water. With this end in view, a combined field and laboratory study has been made on chromite-bearing oxidized serpentinite rocks of Sukinda in Orissa, India. Laboratory leaching studies on mine overburden samples, chemical analyses of streamwater, and hydrolysate incrustation on detrital grains taken from stream beds have indicated the possibility of chromium mobilization from the chromite ores into the waterbodies...|$|E
40|$|The Tissint {{meteorite}}, a picritic shergottite, fell to Earth in Morocco on the 18 th of July 2011, and is {{only the}} fifth Martian meteorite witnessed to fall. Hydrogen isotope ratios and water contents are variable within different minerals in Tissint. Ringwoodite and shock melt pockets contain elevated D/H ratios relative to terrestrial values (δD = 761 to 4224 ‰). These high ratios in recrystallized phases indicate significant implantation of hydrogen from the D-rich Martian atmosphere during shock. In contrast, although olivine has detectable water abundances (230 - 485 ppm), it exhibits much lower D/H ratios (δD = + 88 to - 150 ‰), suggesting this water was not implanted from the Martian atmosphere. The minimal terrestrial weathering experienced by Tissint gives confidence that the olivine-hosted water has a Martian origin, but its high concentration indicates direct inheritance from the parental melt is improbable, especially given the low pressure of olivine crystallisation. Incorporation of a low δD crustal fluid, or <b>deuteric</b> alteration during crystallisation, could explain the relatively high water contents and low D/H ratios in Tissint olivine...|$|E
40|$|Wolframite-bearing quartz veins {{flanked by}} greisen {{alteration}} occur at {{and near the}} Black Pearl mine, Yavapai County, Arizona. The veins are genetically related to a small albitite stock, and cut a series of Proterozoic metasedimentary and intrusive rocks. The largest vein, the only one mined, {{is located at the}} apex of the stock. Field relations imply that this stock is a late-stage differentiate of time 1. 4 -Ga anorogenic Lawler Peak batholith, which crops out about 3 km to the south. The albitites are of igneous origin and have suffered only minor <b>deuteric</b> alteration. A thin (1 to 2 m) pegmatite unit ('stockscheider') occurs at the contact of the Black Pearl Albitite stock with the country rocks. Directional indicators and other evidence suggest that the pegmatite was formed {{in the presence of a}} volatile-rich fluid phase close to the time of magma emplacement. The sudden change from coarse-grained microcline-rich pegmatite to fine-grained, albite-rich albitite suggests pressure quenching, possibly due to escape of fluids up the Black Pearl vein. Stockscheider-like textures typically occur near the apical contacts of productive plutons. The presence or absence of this texture is a useful guide in prospecting for lithophile metal deposits...|$|E
40|$|Mineral {{replacement}} reactions {{take place}} primarily by dissolution-reprecipitation processes. Processes such as cation exchange, chemical weathering, <b>deuteric</b> alteration, leaching, pseudomorphism, metasomatism, diagenesis and metamorphism are all linked by common features {{in which one}} mineral or mineral assemblage {{is replaced by a}} more stable assemblage. The aim {{of this paper is to}} review some of these aspects of mineral replacement and to demonstrate the textural features they have in common, in order to emphasize the similarities in the underlying microscopic mechanisms. The role of volume change and evolution of porosity is explored both from natural microtextures and new experiments on model replacement reactions in simple salts. It is shown that the development of porosity is often a consequence of mineral replacement processes, irrespective of the relative molar volumes of parent and product solid phases. The key issue is the relative solubility of the phases in the fluid phase. Concepts such as coupled dissolution-precipitation, and autocatalysis are important in understanding these processes. Some consequences of porosity generation for metamorphic fluid flow as well as subsequent crystal growth are also discussed.
