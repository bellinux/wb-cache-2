40|$|It is {{generally}} said that code clone {{is one of}} the factors to make software maintenance difficult. A code clone is a code portion in source files that is identical or similar to another. Clones are introduced because of various reasons such as reusing code by ‘copy-and-paste’ and so on. Since developers usually modify the copied-and-pasted code portions, there are some gaps between the original code portion and it.

40|$|In Zymomonas mobilis, {{the genes}} {{encoding}} glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase and phosphoglycerate kinase are transcribed together from the gap-pgk operon. However, {{higher levels of}} the former enzyme {{are present in the}} cytoplasm because of increased stability of a 5 ' segment containing the <b>gap</b> <b>coding</b> region. This segment is bounded by an upstream untranslated region which can be folded into many stem-loop structures and a prominent intercistronic stem-loop. Mutations eliminating a proposed stem-loop in the untranslated region or the intercistronic stem-loop resulted in a decrease in the stability and pool size of the 5 ' gap segment. Site-specific mutations in the unpaired regions of both of these stems also altered the message pools. Elimination of the intercistronic stem appeared to reduce the endonucleolytic cleavage within the pgk coding region, increasing the stability and abundance of the full-length message.

40|$|The {{evolutionary}} {{mechanisms that}} {{give rise to}} microsatellite alleles remain poorly understood in general and are especially understudied for fungal microsatellite loci. The unusual G 28 microsatellite locus was developed from the Hawaiian mushroom Rhodocollybia laulaha. Here, we employ a novel approach to test for allele size homoplasy and examine competing mechanistic models of microsatellite evolution in the context of biogeographic expectations for this locus based on Hawaiian geologic history. Seven G 28 alleles have been identified from a sampling of 153 individuals. The G 28 locus is composed of a trinucleotide imperfect motif, which permits examination of the relationships between alleles and allows for detection of potential size homoplasy within the repetitive element. Alignment of G 28 allele sequence data across multiple unrelated individuals suggests that alleles of like size are homologous within Hawaii.

The lamprey GnRH-I precursor {{is the first}} identified in an ancient lineage of vertebrates and has the same overall tripartite structure as other vertebrate GnRH precursors. The amino acid sequence of lamprey GnRH-I and the processing site (Gly-Lys-Arg) are highly conserved during 500 million years of evolution with 60 – 70 % identity {{compared with those of}} tetrapod and teleost GnRH precursors. In contrast, the GnRH associated peptide regions are markedly divergent, with less than 20 % identity compared with all identified vertebrate precursors. Unlike all other known vertebrate GnRH precur-sors, which typically have one and in a single case two transcripts, three distinct transcripts were isolated and sequenced in lampreys. These lamprey GnRH-I transcripts, termed GAP 49, GAP 50 and GAP 58, differed in the length of the <b>GAP</b> <b>coding</b> sequence and were demonstrated to be the products of a single gene. Analysis of the lamprey GnRH-I gene intron- 2 splice junction demonstrated that alternate splicing produces the different lamprey GnRH-I transcripts.

Parsimony and Bayesian analyses support the monophyly of Drimys, Tasmannia, and Zygogynum s. l., but {{do not support the}} monophyly of Belliolum, Zygogynum s. s., and Bubbia. Within Drimys, the combined data-set recovers two subclades. Divergence time estimates suggest that the splitting between Drimys and its sister clade (Pseudowintera + Zygogynum s. l.) occurred around the end of the Cretaceous; in contrast, the divergence between the two subclades within Drimys is more recent (15. 5 - 18. 5 MY) and coincides in time with the Andean uplift.

On day 4 after hatching, the first prepro-chicken GnRH-II mRNA-expressing cells appeared in the germinal zone of the third ventricle. They increased in number and size from 10 to 21 days, reaching at day 30 their adult final position, within the synencephalic area, at the transitional zone between the diencephalon and the mesencephalon. First prepro-salmon GnRH mRNA-expressing cells became evident on day 7 arising from the olfactory placode and migrating towards the olfactory nerve. On day 10, this cell group reached the olfactory bulb, being evident in the ventral telencephalon and preoptic area from days 15 and 45, respectively.

Auditory nerve {{studies in}} animals demonstrate qualitatively different patterns of firing elicited by low versus high pulse rates, suggesting that stimulus pulse rate might influence {{the transmission of}} temporal information through the auditory pathway. We tested in awake guinea pigs the temporal acuity of auditory cortical neurons for gaps in cochlear implant pulse trains. Consistent with results using anesthetized conditions, temporal acuity improved with increasing pulse rates. Unlike the anesthetized condition, however, cortical neurons responded in the awake state to multiple distinct features of the gap-containing pulse trains, with the dominant features varying with stimulus pulse rate. Responses to {{the onset of the}} trailing pulse train (Trail-ON) provided the most sensitive gap detection at 1, 017 and 4, 069  pulse-per-second (pps) rates, particularly for short (25  ms) leading pulse trains. In contrast, under conditions of 254  pps rate and long (200  ms) leading pulse trains, a sizeable fraction of units demonstrated greater temporal acuity in the form of robust responses to the offsets of the leading pulse train (Lead-OFF). Finally, TONIC responses exhibited decrements in firing rate during gaps, but were rarely the most sensitive feature. Unlike results from anesthetized conditions, temporal acuity of the most sensitive units was nearly as sharp for brief as for long leading bursts. The differences in stimulus coding across pulse rates likely originate from pulse rate-dependent variations in adaptation in the auditory nerve. Two marked differences from responses to acoustic stimulation were: first, Trail-ON responses to 4, 069  pps trains encoded substantially shorter gaps than have been observed with acoustic stimuli; and second, the Lead-OFF <b>gap</b> <b>coding</b> seen for < 15  ms gaps in 254  pps stimuli is not seen in responses to sounds. The current results may help to explain why moderate pulse rates around 1, 000  pps are favored by many cochlear implant listeners...|$|E
40|$|Gastropods have {{traditionally}} been extremely hard to construct phylogenetic relationships for {{because of the lack}} of easily coded morphological characters in their hard-parts. Many gastropod groups, such as the turritellids, are widespread and abundant in both the Recent and the fossil record, and other than the lack of available phylogenies are excellent candidates for addressing a wide variety of macroevolutionary questions, such as how new species occur. Here a new methodology for generating phylogenies for gastropods and other groups that {{have traditionally}} suffered the same problems is developed and applied. New algorithms implemented in the phylogenetic analysis software Tree Analysis using new Technology (TNT; Goloboff et al., 2006) allows the inclusion of continuous data directly into an analysis rather than requiring arbitrary <b>gap</b> <b>coding</b> to reduce the continuous character data to discrete character states. This method uses TNT's ability to analyze continuous characters to allow detailed descriptions of shell shape to be incorporated and analyzed as continuous characters generated from a geometric morphometric (GM) shape analysis. A test case for the methodology using Recent members of the hyper-diverse genus Conus, which has an exceptional molecular phylogeny, shows that GM-continuous characters generated from an eigenshape analysis can contribute to a phylogenetic hypothesis and allow the correct placement of taxa (such as fossils) that have only morphological data into a larger phylogenetic context. A phylogenetic analysis of the two New Zealand turritellid genera Stiracolpus and Zeacolpus carried out using suites of GM-continuous characters generated from whorl profile shape and traditional discrete characters has generated the first phylogenetic hypothesis of turritellid gastropods. These phylogenies indicate that species of both genera have significant ghost ranges. When these ghost ranges are taken into account, the pattern of species originations appears very different from the raw appearance data through the New Zealand Cenozoic, with speciation events clustering in four stages rather than occurring gradually. Paleoenvironmental data suggests that species of the two genera had different environmental tolerances, with Zeacolpus being less well able to survive in the cooler conditions that Stiracolpus appears to have thrived in during the Pliocene to Recent...|$|E
