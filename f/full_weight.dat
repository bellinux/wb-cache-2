Because slavery (except as punishment for crime) had been abolished by the Thirteenth Amendment, the freed slaves would henceforth be given <b>full</b> <b>weight</b> for purposes of apportionment. This situation was a concern to the Republican leadership of Congress, who worried that it would increase {{the political power of}} the former slave states, even as they continued to deny freed slaves the right to vote.|$|E

When enemy counterattacks threatened, Kesselring threw the <b>full</b> <b>weight</b> of his force against them. Now that the Army was {{convinced of the}} value of air support, units were all too inclined to call for it. Kesselring now had to convince the Army that air support should be concentrated at critical points. He strove to improve army–air cooperation with new tactics and the appointment of Colonel Martin Fiebig as a special close air support commander. By 26 July, Kesselring reported the destruction of 165 tanks, 2,136 vehicles and 194 artillery pieces.|$|E
5|$|Along the coast, the 2/28th Infantry Battalion was {{assigned}} {{the task of}} leading the Australian advance along with a troop from the 1st Tank Battalion and engineers from the 2/7th Field Company. Commencing in the afternoon of 27 November, they began clearing operations between Bonga and North Hill along the coast with a secondary task of sending a company towards Pabu to facilitate the relief of the 2/32nd. In the vicinity, the Japanese 20th Division, consisting of {{the remnants of the}} 79th, 80th and 238th Infantry Regiments, numbered 4,670 men, of which 2,500 were combat effective. The lead company of the 2/28th Infantry Battalion moved off shortly after midday, passing through the 2/43rd Infantry Battalion's lines. Initially there was no opposition and by the afternoon they established a defensive position near a waterfall. The following morning, the advance continued. The ground astride the coastal track, although flat, was covered in dense jungle, which was not suitable for tracked vehicles to move across. The result of this was that the Australian tanks had to remain on the track, advancing behind the infantry, which limited the rate of their advance and prevented them from being able to apply the <b>full</b> <b>weight</b> of their firepower.|$|E

5|$|As {{infantry}} disembarked {{from the}} landing craft, they often found themselves on sandbars 50 to 100 yards (45 to 90m) out. To reach the beach {{they had to}} wade through water sometimes neck deep, and they still had 200 yards (180m) or more to go when they did reach shore. Those that {{made it to the}} shingle did so at a walking pace because they were so heavily laden. Most sections had to brave the <b>full</b> <b>weight</b> of fire from small arms, mortars, artillery, and interlocking fields of heavy machine gun fire. Where the naval bombardment set grass fires burning, as it had at Dog Red opposite the Les Moulins strongpoint, the smoke obscured the landing troops and prevented effective fire from being laid down by the defenders. Some sections of G/116 and F/116 were able to reach the shingle bank relatively unscathed, though the latter became disorganized after the loss of their officers. G/116 was able to retain some cohesion, but this was soon lost {{as they made their way}} westwards under fire along the shingle in an attempt to reach their assigned objectives. The scattering of the boats was most evident on the 16th RCT front, where parts of E/16, F/16 and E/116 had intermingled, making it difficult for sections to come together to improvise company assaults that might have reversed the situation caused by the mis-landings. Those scattered sections of E/116 landing at Easy Red were able to escape heavy casualties, although, having encountered a deep runnel after being landed on a sandbank, they were forced to discard most of their weapons to make the swim ashore.|$|E

40|$|The goal of limit feeding is {{to reduce}} {{variability}} in rumen fill at weighing. The amount of rumen fill varies by diet. Cattle {{included in this study}} were grazing cornstalks, smooth bromegrass pasture, or in a drylot and fed a forage and modified distillers grains (MDGS) mix. Cattle were limit fed for at least three days and then weighed on two or three consecutive days to obtain a beginning BW. <b>Full</b> <b>weights</b> of individuals were + 99 to - 86 lb compared to their limit fed weights.

50|$|Historically, in the United States, capitalization-weighted indices {{tended to}} use <b>full</b> <b>weighting,</b> i.e., all {{outstanding}} shares were included, while float-weighted indexing {{has been the}} norm in other countries, perhaps because of large cross-holdings or government ownership.

The new Mozambican government threw its <b>full</b> <b>weight</b> behind the ZANLA cause and Rhodesia's entire border with Mozambique became a front line across which guerrillas began to operate freely.

25|$|To {{increase}} the likelihood of a good outcome after surgery, multiple weeks of physical therapy is necessary. In these weeks, the therapist will help the patient return to normal activities, as well as prevent blood clots, improve circulation, increase range of motion, and eventually strengthen the surrounding muscles through specific exercises. Treatment includes encouraging patients to move early after the surgery. Continuous Passive Motion machines also known simply as CPM Often range of motion (to the limits of the prosthesis) is recovered over the first two weeks (the earlier the better). Over time, patients are able to {{increase the}} amount of weight bearing on the operated leg, and eventually are able to tolerate <b>full</b> <b>weight</b> bearing with the guidance of the physical therapist.

After refusing a direct order by the Bolshevik government to disband his anarchist army, Makhno intercepted three messages from Lenin to Christian Rakovsky, {{the head of}} the Bolshevik Ukrainian Soviet based in Kharkiv. Lenin's orders were to arrest all members of Makhno's organization and to try them as common criminals. On November 26, 1920, less than two weeks after assisting Red Army forces to defeat Wrangel, Makhno's headquarters staff and many of his subordinate commanders were arrested at a Red Army planning conference to which they had been invited by Moscow, and executed.

25|$|In {{the year}} 2001, the National Automobile Dealers Association {{conducted}} a study revealing {{the average age of}} vehicles in operation in the US. The study found that of vehicles in operation in the US, 38.3% were older than ten years, 22.3% were between seven and ten years old, 25.8% were between three and six years old, and 13.5% were less than two years old. According to this study the majority of vehicles, 60.6%, of vehicles were older than seven years in 2001. This relatively high age of automobiles in the US might be explained by unaffordable prices for comparable new replacement vehicles and a corresponding gradual decline in sales figures since 1998. Also, many Americans own three or more vehicles. The low marginal cost of registering and insuring additional older vehicles, many of which are rarely used, could cause the study to be skewed as these vehicles are still given <b>full</b> <b>weight</b> in the statistics.|$|E
