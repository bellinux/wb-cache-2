40|$|International audienceThis study {{investigates the}} {{mechanical}} response of sodium borosilicate (SBN) glasses {{as a function}} of their chemical composition. Vickers's indentation tests provide an estimate of the material hardness (H V) and indentation fracture toughness (K C VIF) plus the amount of densification/shear flow processes. Sodium content significantly impacts the glass behavior under a sharp indenter. Low sodium glasses maintain high connected networks and low Poisson's ratios (ν). This entails significant <b>densification</b> <b>processes</b> during deformation. Conversely, glasses with high sodium content, i. e. large ν, partake in a more depolymerized network favoring deformation by shear flow. As a consequence, indentation patterns differ depending on the <b>processes</b> occurring. <b>Densification</b> <b>processes</b> appear to hinder the formation of halfpenny median–radial cracks.

40|$|Abstract. Currently, México has {{problems}} related to dry seasons, which reduce the availability of forage and generate economic losses to cattlemen. But Mexico produces about 60 million tons of agricultural crop residues every year. A good alternative use for these residues is to produce cattle feed after the harvest season. Additional problems {{are associated with the}} low density of these materials, such as handling, storage and transportation. In order to solve these problems the <b>densification</b> <b>process</b> is proposed as a solution. Some current machines use the extrusion principle as a <b>densification</b> <b>process.</b> However, before selecting or designing these machines, it is necessary to know the mechanical behavior of the material and the processing conditions.

40|$|As wood’s density increases, {{strength}} properties tend to increase {{due to a}} decrease in cavity volume. This study aimed {{to determine the effect}} of temperature levels in the <b>densification</b> <b>process</b> with an open-system thermomechanical method on the density, bending, modulus of elasticity in bending, compression, shear strength, and Brinell hardness in radial/tangential directions of Scots pine. The <b>densification</b> <b>process</b> significantly increased the {{strength properties}} of Scots pine. This increase stemmed from the decrease in the rate of cavities with the <b>densification</b> <b>process,</b> which also resulted in an increase in cell wall elements that have load-bearing properties per unit volume. An increase in densification temperature decreased strength properties. The decrease in the strength values can be explained by increasing chemical degradation with a rise in the temperature level. The most suitable temperature level was 120 ºC for a higher bending, shear, and compression strength, and it was 140 ºC for a higher radial and tangential hardness in the densification of Scots pine. Increases of 42 % in the bending strength, 20 % in the shear strength, 47 % in the compression strength, 242 % in the radial hardness, and 268 % in the tangential hardness were obtained after densification...|$|E

Six firn samples were obtained from depths of 8 to 9 m. Sample densities ranged from 0. 433 to 0. 521 g/(cm) ^ 3. Uniaxial compression creep tests were done under a constant stress of 1 bar and constant temperatures ranging between - 2 and - 10 ℃ in a cold room. Each sample was deformed for about 100 hours. Experimental results show relatively shorter transient creep regions and slight increase in steady-state creep rates compared with artificial firns sample tests.

40|$|International audiencePore {{connectivity}} is {{a measure}} of the fraction of pore space (vesicles, voids or cracks) in a material thatis interconnected on the system length scale. Pore connectivity is fundamentally related to permeability,which has been shown to control magma outgassing and the explosive potential of magma duringascent in the shallowest part of the crust. Here, we compile a database of connectivity and porosityfrom published sources and supplement this with additional measurements, using natural volcanic rocksproduced in a broad range of eruptive styles and with a range of bulk composition. The databasecomprises 2715 pairs of connectivity C and porosity φ values for rocks from 35 volcanoes as well as 116 products of experimental work. For 535 volcanic rock samples, the permeability k was also measured. Data from experimental studies constrain the general features of the relationship between C and φassociated with both vesiculation and <b>densification</b> <b>processes,</b> which can then be used to interpret naturaldata. To a first order, we show that a suite of rocks originating from effusive eruptive behaviour can bedistinguished from rocks originating from explosive eruptive behaviour using C and φ. We observe thaton this basis, a particularly clear distinction can be made between scoria formed in fire-fountains andthat formed in Strombolian activity. With increasing φ, the onset of connectivity occurs at the percolationthreshold φc which in turn can be hugely variable. We demonstrate that C is an excellent metric forconstraining φc in suites of porous rocks formed in a common process and discuss the range of φc valuesrecorded in volcanic rocks. The percolation threshold is key to understanding the onset of permeability,outgassing and compaction in shallow magmas. We show that this threshold is dramatically different inrocks formed during <b>densification</b> <b>processes</b> than in rocks formed in vesiculating processes and proposethat this value is the biggest factor in controlling the evolution of permeability at porosities above φc...|$|R
