40|$|Different from {{conventional}} {{compressed air energy storage}} (CAES) systems, the advanced adiabatic compressed air energy storage (AA-CAES) system can store the compression heat {{which can be}} used to reheat air during the electricity generation stage. Thus, AA-CAES system can achieve a higher energy storage efficiency. Similar to the AA-CAES system, a compressed air energy storage in aquifers (CAESA) system, which is integrated with an aquifer thermal energy storage (ATES) could possibly achieve the same objective. In order to investigate the impact of ATES on the performance of CAESA, different <b>injection</b> <b>air</b> temperature schemes are designed and analyzed by using numerical simulations. Key parameters relative to energy recovery efficiencies of the different injection schemes, such as pressure distribution and temperature variation within the aquifers as well as energy flow rate in the injection well, are also investigated in this study. The simulations show that, although different injection schemes have a similar overall energy recovery efficiency (~ 97 %) as well as a thermal energy recovery efficiency (~ 79. 2 %), the higher <b>injection</b> <b>air</b> temperature has a higher energy storage capability. Our results show the total energy storage for the <b>injection</b> <b>air</b> temperature at 80 ̊C is about 10 % greater than the base model scheme at 40 °C. Sensitivity analysis reveal that permeability of the reservoir boundary could have significant impact on the system performance. However, other hydrodynamic and thermodynamic properties, such as the storage reservoir permeability, thermal conductivity, rock grain specific heat and rock grain density, have little impact on storage capability and the energy flow rate. Overall, our study suggests that the combination of ATES and CAESA can help keep the high efficiency of energy storage so as to make CAESA system more efficiency...|$|E

This study assessed: (1) how <b>air</b> <b>injection</b> rate affects the mass removal of dissolved phase contamination, (2) the effect of induced groundwater flow on mass removal and air distribution during <b>air</b> <b>injection,</b> and (3) the effect of initial contaminant concentration on mass removal. Dissolved-phase chlorinated solvents can be effectively removed {{through the use of}} {{air sparging}}; however, rapid initial rates of contaminant removal are followed by a protracted period of lower removal rates, or a tailing effect. As the air flow rate increases, the rate of contaminant removal also increases, especially during the initial stages of <b>air</b> <b>injection.</b> Increased <b>air</b> <b>injection</b> rates will increase the density of air channel formation, resulting in a larger interfacial mass transfer area through which the dissolved contaminant can partition into the vapor phase.

The goal {{of the project was}} to reduce emissions of NO{sub x} by 60 %, from the as found baseline of 0. 98 lb/MBtu and to reduce emissions of SO{sub 2 } by 50 %. Since the unit currently fires a blend of high sulfur Illinois coal and low sulfur Kentucky coal to meet an SO{sub 2 } limit of 1. 8 lb/MBtu, the goal at this site was amended to meeting this limit while increasing the fraction of high sulfur coal to 57 % from the current 15 % level. GR-SI requires injection of natural gas into the furnace {{at the level of the}} top burner row, creating a fuel-rich zone in which NO{sub x} formed in the coal zone is reduced to N{sub 2 }. Recycled flue gas is used to increase the reburning fuel jet momentum, resulting in enhanced mixing.

The <b>air</b> <b>injection</b> increased the internal bond strengths by 2.2 times. The <b>air</b> <b>injection</b> reduced the modulus of rupture and increased the internal bond strength. The effect of increasing the internal bond strength was larger than the reduction of modulus of rupture. The <b>air</b> <b>injection</b> also reduced the pressing time. Thus, the advantages of <b>air</b> <b>injection,</b> which include a remarkable increase of internal bond strength, and shortened pressing time, outweigh the disadvantage of {{a drop in the}} modulus of rupture.|$|R
