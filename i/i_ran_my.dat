2500|$|At Calder, I had a jockey named Nick Navarro {{who worked}} for me. [...] He {{was one of the}} good guys. [...] He wouldn't hold horses or charge them or run them on dope. [...] He was very skilled, and when <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>my</b> horses clean, I used Nick.|$|E
60|$|DON JUAN. Only a duel. <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>my</b> sword {{through an}} old man who was trying to run his through me.|$|E

5000|$|Marvin H. Scilken—Advocate of {{practical}} customer-oriented librarianship and founding {{editor of the}} U*N*A*B*A*S*H*E*D Librarian, the how <b>I</b> <b>run</b> <b>my</b> library good letter.|$|R
6000|$|I {{turned to}} [...] "What {{to do in}} Case of Accidents," [...] on page 117. <b>I</b> <b>run</b> <b>my</b> finger down the page, and struck it. Good old Herkimer, he never {{overlooked}} anything! It said: ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>runs</b> <b>my</b> {{arm around}} her neck and raises her head, gentle, and breaks the bag of {{flaxseed}} with the other hand; and as easy as I could I bends over and slips three or four of the seeds in the outer corner of her eye.|$|R
60|$|Though it was October, {{the evening}} was warm, and the tables on the {{pavement}} were crowded. <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>my</b> eyes over them, but did not see Strickland.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Burns, {{while still}} acting captain, had hastened {{to sign a}} {{charter-party}} which {{in an ideal world}} without guile would have been an excellent document. Directly <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>my</b> eye over it I foresaw trouble ahead unless the people of the other part were quite exceptionally fair-minded and open to argument.|$|E
6000|$|With a single, low: [...] "For the Princess of Helium!" [...] <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>my</b> blade {{straight}} through the rotten heart of Okar's rotten ruler, and before the white, drawn faces of his nobles Salensus Oll rolled, grinning in horrible death, {{to the foot of}} the steps below his marriage throne.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>ran</b> to <b>my</b> lady's room, {{and with}} no preparatory cruelty {{disclosed}} my news.|$|R
60|$|In the {{interval}} of waiting, <b>I</b> hastily <b>ran</b> <b>my</b> eye {{through the pages}} of the manuscript.|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>ran,</b> in <b>my</b> madness, to {{seek out}} the source [...] Of the redolent river--directed By some supernatural, {{sinister}} force [...] To a forest, dark, haunted, infected.|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>my</b> eye {{down the}} list of stipulations {{respecting}} the work to be done at so much per rod, with allowance for extra depth scooped out through the rises per cubic ton, saw there should be a profit in it from what little I knew, and tossed the sheet to Harry, answering: ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>my</b> canoe ashore and {{approached}} the little fellow quietly, without hurry or excitement. Nose, eyes, and ears questioned me; and his fear gradually changed to curiosity as he saw how harmless a thing had frightened him. He even tried to pull his awkward little legs out of the mud in my direction. Meanwhile the big mother moose was thrashing around in the bushes in a terrible swither, calling her calf to come.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{dropped into}} that Home Restaurant next door this evening," [...] said he. [...] "I don't care who knows it; I like {{a dish of}} some kind of greens {{at this time of the}} year. <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>my</b> eye down that nice typewritten bill of fare looking for {{something}} in that line. When I got below cabbage I turned my chair over and hollered for the proprietor. He told me where you lived." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It may be nonsense," [...] {{retorted}} Billy, [...] "but if I {{thought he}} really meant it, <b>I</b> would <b>run</b> <b>my</b> head butt into his breadbasket, an' drive 'im overboard." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well," [...] I said, [...] "you {{may come}} with us, Hooja; {{but at the}} first intimation of treachery <b>I</b> shall <b>run</b> <b>my</b> sword through you. Do you understand?" ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{thought of}} it was too much. <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> to <b>my</b> {{grandfather}} crying: [...] "Not Mr. Allen, sir, not Mr. Allen. Any one else you please,--Mr. Fairbrother even." ...|$|R
6000|$|A {{malignant}} humour took {{possession of}} me. [...] "What would they call you?" [...] I speculated. [...] "The vicar would like Duffield. Too much like Duffer! Difficult thing, a title." [...] <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>my</b> mind over various possibilities. [...] "Why {{not take a}} leaf from a socialist tract I came upon yesterday. Chap says we're all getting delocalised. Beautiful word--delocalised! Why {{not be the first}} delocalised peer? That gives you--Tono-Bungay! There is a Bungay, you know. Lord Tono of Bungay--in bottles everywhere. Eh?" ...|$|E
60|$|As {{the steamer}} slipped westward my spirits rose, {{to reach a}} climax of exhilaration when I saw the towers of New York rise gleaming like huge stalagmites in the early winter sun. Maude likened them more happily--to {{gigantic}} ivory chessmen. Well, New York was America's chessboard, and the Great Players {{had already begun to}} make moves that astonished the world. As we sat at breakfast in a Fifth Avenue hotel <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>my</b> eye eagerly over the stock-market reports and the financial news, and rallied Maude for a lack of spirits.|$|E
6000|$|The {{day before}} she was to leave she told us she would not {{go out in the}} afternoon; so I {{determined}} to stroll down the river to Iffley by myself in a [...] "tub dingey"--a small boat with room in it for two, if occasion demands. When I reached the Iffley Lock, imagine my horror at seeing Ida {{in the middle of the}} stream, quietly engaged in paddling herself down the river in a canoe. <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>my</b> dingey close beside her, drove her remorselessly against the bank, and handed her out on to the meadow, before she could imagine what I was driving at.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{promise to}} be of much use, Major," [...] he said quietly. [...] "I know myself too well; but at least <b>I</b> can <b>run</b> <b>my</b> chance of being killed." ...|$|R
50|$|Scilken’s {{advocacy}} through writing {{would later}} inspire him {{to create his}} own publication the U*N*A*B*A*S*H*E*D Librarian, the how <b>I</b> <b>run</b> <b>my</b> library good letter. Choosing topics {{that focused on the}} practical parts of librarianship, the publication featured a collection of articles, cartoons, letters, and advice all dealing with the world of libraries. Advice was given on how to better improve library services including an assortment of topics from more traditional cataloguing techniques to more practical cleaning techniques.|$|R
6000|$|... "Allie, {{these men}} are all bad," [...] said Durade. [...] "You must avoid them when my back's turned. <b>I</b> cannot <b>run</b> <b>my</b> place without them, so I am {{compelled}} to endure much." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Assuredly," [...] said Charles; [...] "I had not {{the least}} doubt at the moment. I know <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>my</b> sword through his body, and felt a jar that I believe was his backbone," [...] {{he said with a}} shudder, [...] "and he fell prone and breathless; but since I have seen more of fencing, and heard more of wounds, the dread has crossed me that I acted as an inexperienced lad, and that I ought to have tried whether the life was in him, or if he could be recovered. If so, I slew him twice, by {{launching}} him into that pit. God forgive me!" ...|$|E
60|$|I {{remember}} one that greeted me, the first living {{thing in the}} great woods, as <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>my</b> canoe ashore on a wilderness river. Meeko heard me coming. His bark sounded loudly, in a big spruce, above the dip of the paddles. As we turned shoreward, he ran down the tree in which he was, and out on a fallen log to meet us. I grasped {{a branch of the}} old log to steady the canoe and watched him curiously. He had never seen a man before; he barked, jeered, scolded, jerked his tail, whistled, did everything within his power to make me show my teeth and my disposition.|$|E
6000|$|At {{the end of}} {{that time}} I {{returned}} through France. Having nothing to read I happened to buy a volume of Maupassant's Tales which I had never seen before. The first story was called [...] "L'Auberge" [...] (The Inn)--and as <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>my</b> eye down the printed page I was amazed to see the two words, [...] "Kandersteg" [...] and [...] "Gemmi Pass." [...] I settled down and read it with ever-growing amazement. The scene was laid in the inn I had visited. The plot depended on the isolation of a group of people through the snowfall. Everything that I imagined was there, save that Maupassant had brought in a savage hound.|$|E
6000|$|... "Come, come, monsieur!" [...] he bade him sharply. [...] "Am <b>I</b> to <b>run</b> <b>my</b> blade {{through an}} {{uncovered}} man?" [...] Deliberately he fell back, whilst his shaken opponent recovered himself at last.|$|R
6000|$|... "My son, <b>I</b> <b>run</b> <b>my</b> own business," [...] replied Dorn, sullenly, with a pale {{fire in his}} opaque eyes. [...] "You're a wild boy, unfaithful to your blood. You've {{fallen in}} love with an American girl.... Anderson says he needs money!"... With hard, gloomy face the old man shook his head. [...] "He thinks he'll harvest!" [...] Again that strange shake of finality. [...] "I know what I know.... I keep my money.... We'll have other rule.... I keep my money." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There is {{no fear of}} {{his doing}} any running now. Just come and sit down by this wall, my lad, and {{remember}} {{if you make the}} slightest sound <b>I</b> will <b>run</b> <b>my</b> sword through your body." ...|$|R
60|$|I now tore {{open the}} blank envelope, {{and found it}} {{contained}} a letter on a single sheet, and in this was a folded paper, very dirty. The letter was apparently written in Italian, and had no signature. <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>my</b> eye along the opening lines, and soon found {{that it would be}} a very difficult piece of business for me to read it. I was a fair French and German scholar, but my knowledge of Italian was due entirely to its relationship with Latin. I told the man to rest himself somewhere, and went to the house, and, finding Miss Edith, I informed her that I had a letter from the bear man, and asked her if she could read Italian.|$|E
6000|$|... "Sorrow wan o' me knows," [...] {{returned}} the Irishman, wiping the perspiration from his brow; [...] "d'ye suppose I {{can see in}} the dark like the moles? All I know is that half a dozen of ye have bin shoutin' `Here he is!' an' another half-dozen, `No, he's here--this way!' an' sure I ran this way an' then I ran that way--havin' a nat'ral disposition to obey orders, acquired in the Louth Militia--an' then <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>my</b> nose flat on a tree-- bad luck to it!--that putt more stars in me hid than you'll see in the sky this night. Ah! ye may laugh, but it's truth I'm tellin'. See, there's a blob on the ind of it as big as a chirry!" ...|$|E
60|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{singular}} discovery I made was a tree, {{the stem of}} which had been so completely surrounded by spiders' webs that it could not be seen, and I had to cut through the network with my knife in order to get at the tree. The lines of those webs were as thick as coarse threads, and pretty strong, as I had reason to know; for when walking back to camp the same evening, meditating deeply on our unfortunate detention, <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>my</b> head into the middle of a spider's web, and was completely enveloped in it, so much so that it was with considerable difficulty I succeeded in clearing it away. I was as regularly netted as if a gauze veil had been thrown over me.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} work {{on using}} Minimal Recursion Semantics (MRS) representations {{for the task}} of recognising textual entailment. I use entailment data from a SemEval- 2010 shared task to develop and evaluate an entailment recognition heuristic. I compare my results to the shared task winner, and discuss differences in approaches. Finally, <b>I</b> <b>run</b> <b>my</b> system with multiple MRS representations per sentence, and show that this improves the recognition results for positive entailment sentence pairs.

6000|$|... "That's {{very strange}} and interestin'. I'd like well to visit old Adams, lad, an' I thank 'ee for the invitation; but <b>I</b> won't <b>run</b> <b>my</b> ship {{through such a}} surf as that, an' don't like to risk leavin' her to go ashore in your canoe." ...|$|R
60|$|But you may suppose I paid no heed; jumping, ducking, and {{breaking}} through, <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> straight before <b>my</b> nose till <b>I</b> could <b>run</b> no longer.|$|R
