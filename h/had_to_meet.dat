5|$|At {{the very}} outset of his reign, Alexios <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> the {{formidable}} {{threat of the}} Normans under Robert Guiscard and his son Bohemond of Taranto, who took Dyrrhachium and Corfu, and laid siege to Larissa in Thessaly (see Battle of Dyrrhachium). Alexios led his forces in person against the Normans, yet despite his best efforts his army was destroyed in the field. Alexios himself was wounded, but the death of Robert Guiscard in 1085 led to the Norman danger receding for a time.|$|E
5|$|The {{casting process}} for Monica Reyes was unconventional. Gish {{received}} a call from her agent, who informed her that The X-Files were looking for a new female character. Gish applied for the part, but instead of having to a do a reading, she only <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> with Chris Carter and Frank Spotnitz. After receiving the part, Gish's first shot was scheduled four in the morning; her first scene in the episode was to run down a hill to discover a former abductee.|$|E

(2) Piccinini 2 ̆ 7 s answer: it <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> the objectivity criterion (i. e. identifying computation {{as a matter of}} fact), the explanation criterion (i. e. explaining the computer 2 ̆ 7 s behaviour), the right things compute criterion, the miscomputation criterion (i. e. accounting for malfunctions), the taxonomy criterion (i. e. distinguishing between different classes of computers) and the empirical criterion. (3) Von Neumann 2 ̆ 7 s answer: it <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> the precision and reliability of computers criterion, the single error criterion (i. e. addressing the impacts of errors) and the distinction between analogue and digital computers criterion.

5|$|Both Eisenhower's {{speech to}} the excited crowd and {{telegram}} to his running mate were noncommittal. The general applauded his running mate for his speech, but stated that the two <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> face to face before a final decision could be made. While Eisenhower affirmed that the RNC {{had the power to}} elect a replacement candidate, Eisenhower indicated that the committee would, most likely, be guided by his wishes. Eisenhower asked Nixon to meet with him in person in Wheeling, West Virginia, where the general's campaign was next scheduled to go. Eisenhower's telegram was delayed in transmission and lost among the flood being sent to Nixon's suite, and the latter learned of his running mate's position from a wire service report.|$|E
5|$|The gaseous {{diffusion}} process required suitable pumps that <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> stringent requirements. Like the diffusers, they had to resist corrosion from the uranium hexafluoride feed. Corrosion would not only damage the pumps, but would contaminate the feed. They could not afford any leakage of uranium hexafluoride, especially if it was already enriched, or leak oil, which would react with the uranium hexafluoride. They had to pump at high rates, and handle a gas twelve times as dense as air. To meet these requirements, the SAM Laboratories chose to use centrifugal pumps. They were aware that the desired compression ratio of 2.3:1 to 3.2:1 was unusually high {{for this type of}} pump. For some purposes, a reciprocating pump would suffice, and these were designed by Henry A. Boorse at the SAM Laboratories, while Ingersoll Rand tackled the centrifugal pumps.|$|E

5|$|The primary {{authority}} {{on the design of}} the film was concept artist Albert Hurter. All designs used in the film, from characters' appearances to the look of the rocks in the background, <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> Hurter's approval before being finalized. Two other concept artists— Ferdinand Hovarth and Gustaf Tenggren— also contributed to the visual style of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Hovarth developed a number of dark concepts for the film, although many other designs he developed were ultimately rejected by the Disney team as less easily translated into animation than Hurter's. Tenggren was used as a color stylist and to determine the staging and atmosphere of many of the scenes in the film, as his style borrowed from the likes of Arthur Rackham and John Bauer and thus possessed the European illustration quality that Walt Disney sought. He also designed the posters for the film and illustrated the press book. However, Hovarth didn't receive a credit for the film. Other artists to work on the film included Joe Grant, whose most significant contribution was the design for the Queen's Witch form.|$|E

25|$|Notwithstanding this prosperous situation, the {{government}} <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> certain economic problems besetting the country.

25|$|The {{government}} {{response to}} the crisis sent mixed messages, with falling interest rates doing nothing to support confidence in the rupiah, and the rupiah continued to be sold, as companies who had been borrowing heavily in dollars <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> their obligation.

25|$|In {{designing}} St Paul's, Christopher Wren <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> many challenges. He had {{to create}} a fitting cathedral to replace Old St Paul's, {{as a place of}} worship and as a landmark within the City of London. He had to satisfy the requirements of the church and the tastes of a royal patron, as well as respecting the essentially mediaeval tradition of English church building which developed to accommodate the liturgy. Wren was familiar with contemporary Renaissance and Baroque trends in Italian architecture and had visited France, where he studied the work of François Mansart.|$|E
25|$|The tariff {{issue was}} pulling the GOP apart. Roosevelt tried to {{postpone}} the issue, but Taft <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> it head on in 1909 with the Payne–Aldrich Tariff Act. Eastern conservatives led by Nelson W. Aldrich wanted high tariffs on manufactured goods (especially woolens), while Midwesterners called for low tariffs. Aldrich tricked them by lowering the tariff on farm products, which outraged the farmers. Insurgent Midwesterners led by George Norris revolted against the conservatives led by Speaker Cannon. The Democrats won control of the House in 1910 as the rift between insurgents and conservatives widened.|$|E

Aggregates used in the office build were from predominantly recycled sources, part of a strategy to integrate sustainable products and materials throughout the site, delivering both affordable and sustainable environmentally friendly features to the building.|$|E

25|$|Before 1948 world {{championship}} matches were financed by arrangements {{similar to those}} Emanuel Lasker described for his 1894 match with Wilhelm Steinitz: either the challenger or both players, {{with the assistance of}} financial backers, would contribute to a purse; about half would be distributed to the winner's backers, and the winner would receive the larger share of the remainder (the loser's backers got nothing). The players <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> their own travel, accommodation, food and other expenses out of their shares of the purse.
