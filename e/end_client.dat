This yields any replication algorithm that can replicate the contents to minimum number of surrogate servers within the SON. Such servers can be accessed from anywhere. Then we propose a content distribution algorithm named Optimal Fast Replica (O-FR) and apply our proposed algorithm to distribute the content over the Equitable Dominating set based Semantic Overlay Networks (EDSON). We analyze the performance of our proposed Optimal Fast Replica (O-FR) in terms of average replication time, and maximum replication time and compare its performance with existing content distribution algorithms named Fast Replica and Resilient Fast Replica. The result of such approach improves the service quality perceived by the <b>end</b> <b>clients.</b> This paper also analyzes the use of equitable dominating set {{for the construction of}} semantic overlay networks and also investigates how it is useful for maintaining the uniform utilization of the surrogate servers...|$|R

This enables the use of highly scalable wavelet based codecs on the one hand and the utilization of already existing network technologies without accruing high implementation costs on the other hand.

40|$|Content Distribution Networks (CDN) are overlay {{networks}} used {{to place}} content near <b>end</b> <b>clients</b> {{with the aim}} at reducing delay, servers load and network congestion, hence improving the service quality perceived by <b>end</b> <b>clients.</b> In traditional CDN architectures, clients requests are initially received by a central server and then redirected to another server that {{is close to the}} client and that is able to handle the request. However, in some cases, clients requests will not be served by the closest server. It may be advantageous to use a server that is a further away but that is not as loaded as the closest one. Contents in CDN are replicated, in many cases, according to contractual clauses, because of the costs involved in the maintenance of such replicated contents. Therefore, some contents are not replicated through the entire overlay network of the CDN provider.

40|$|Internet {{geolocation}} technology (IP geolocation) aims {{to determine}} the physical (geographic) location of Internet users and devices. It is currently proposed or in use {{for a wide variety}} of purposes, including targeted marketing, restricting digital content sales to authorized jurisdictions, and security applications such as reducing credit card fraud. This raises questions about the veracity of claims of accurate and reliable geolocation, and the ability to evade geolocation. We begin with a state-of-the-art survey of IP geolocation techniques and limitations, and examine the specific problems of (1) approximating a physical location from an IP address; and (2) approximating the physical location of an <b>end</b> <b>client</b> requesting content from a web server. In contrast to previous work, we consider also an adversarial model: a knowledgeable adversary seeking to evade geolocation. Our survey serves as the basis from which we examine tactics useful for evasion/circumvention. The adversarial model leads us to also consider the difficulty of (3) extracting the IP address of an <b>end</b> <b>client</b> visiting a server. As a side-result, in exploring the use of proxy servers as an evasionary tactic, to our surprise we found that we were able to extract an end-client IP address even for a browser protected by Tor/Privoxy (designed to anonymize browsing), provided Java is enabled. We expect our work to stimulate further open research and analysis of techniques for accurate and reliable IP geolocation, and also for evasion thereof. Our work is a small step towards a better understanding of what can, and cannot, be reliably hidden or discovered about IP addresses and physical locations of Internet users and machines. ...|$|E
40|$|As {{multiple}} {{types of}} traffic converge onto one network (frequently wireless), enterprises face a tradeoff between effectiveness and security. Some types of traffic, such as voice-over-IP (VoIP), require certain {{quality of service}} (QoS) guarantees to be effective.

In many environments (such as universities), end users relish having control over their own machines. However, if end users administer their own machines, nothing stops dishonest ones from marking undeserving traffic for high QoS. How can an enterprise ensure that only appropriate traffic receives high QoS, while also allowing end users to retain control over their own machines?

In this regard, a compression scheme for the rendered images is vital for efficient utilization of the server-client bandwidth. Also, the complexity of the decompressor should be considered so that a low <b>end</b> <b>client</b> workstation can decode images at the desired frame rate.

While {{the first two}} are perceived as a re-emergence of older models (e. g., ASP), crowdsourcing is a new model that creates {{an opportunity for a}} global workforce to compete with established service providers. Organizations engaging in crowdsourcing need to develop the capabilities to successfully utilize this sourcing model in delivering services to their clients. To explore these capabilities we collected qualitative data from focus groups with crowdsourcing leaders at a large technology organization.

The user's secret password never crosses the network during login or when executing other commands requiring authentication such as the UNIX passwd (change password) or su (change privilege) commands.

Relaying brings stable multimedia services to end clients, compared to multiple description coding (MDC). Also, retransmission of only parity data about one or more video layer using channel coder to the <b>end</b> <b>client</b> of the relay device is paramount to the robustness of the loss situation. Using these methods in resource-constrained environments, such as real-time user created content (UCC) with layered video transmission, can provide high-quality services even in a poor communication environment. Minimal services are also possible. The mathematical analysis shows that the proposed method reduced the probability of GOP loss rate compared to MDC and raptor code without relay. The GOP loss rate is about zero, while MDC and raptor code without relay have a GOP loss rate of 36 % and 70 % in case of 10 % frame loss rate.
