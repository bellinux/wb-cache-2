500|$|While Hurley {{had been}} able to command Friday's respect, {{it soon became clear that}} Andrews was unable to control him and that the Londoner disliked his new manager. Indeed, soon after moving to Cardiff, Friday {{appeared}} one day in Hurley's office at Elm Park asking to come back to Reading. [...] "He still called me boss", Hurley recalled. [...] "I can't play for that little bastard", Friday told Hurley, referring to Andrews. [...] "You're the one who seems to be able to get me right. Can <b>I</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> you?" [...] Hurley replied that although he would be happy to have Friday back on the team, the club could not afford to repay the £28,000 transfer fee to Cardiff, so he would have to go back and continue playing there. Unhappy living so far from home, Friday began to travel back to London at weekends; he avoided paying rail fares by knocking on locked toilet doors and shouting, [...] "Tickets, please!", pretending to be the ticket inspector. When the occupant passed his ticket under the door to be checked, Friday would pick it up, walk off and use it for himself. Paul Went also recalled an incident during training when he had thrown a ball out from goal and accidentally hit Friday on the back of the head. A player standing near the forward started laughing, leading Friday to conclude that he had thrown the ball. Friday viciously punched the laughing player in the jaw, striking him with such force that he wore a neck brace for two weeks afterwards.|$|E

He told me there would be no deal because [...] Arafat would not sign. I told myself that {{there was nothing to be}} done – these right-wingers were simply insane. I had no doubt that there would be a deal and the problems would be resolved. History proved that Sharon was right and I was wrong. In matters relating to security, that moved me to the right.

2500|$|The Rabbis {{taught that}} God's promise in [...] "and, behold, I am with you, and {{will keep you}} {{wherever}} you go," [...] answered all of Jacob's requests, except that for sustenance.

[...] Jacob prayed in [...] "So that <b>I</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> my father's house in peace," [...] and God assured Jacob, [...] "and will bring you back." [...] But the Rabbis taught that God did not answer Jacob's request for sustenance. Rabbi Assi, however, taught that God answered Jacob's request for sustenance, too, for in [...] God says, [...] "for I will not forsake you," [...] and forsaking applies to sustenance, as in , [...] "Yet I {{have not seen the}} righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread." ...|$|E
