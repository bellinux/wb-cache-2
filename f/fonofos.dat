The mortality probabilities, based on behavior of moribund larvae, resulted in data that was more consistent with the assumptions underlying parameteric statistics and provided more precision {{when compared to the}} usually accepted alternate method of considering moribund larvae as dead. The rating system bioassay technique was used to study the effects of different soil factors on the relative decline in biological activity of six soil insecticides: carbofuran, chlorpyrifos, <b>fonofos,</b> isofenphos, phorate, and terbufos. Field studies (including one that altered pH with lime and sulfur) were conducted to measure the effects of soil pH, texture, organic matter, and moisture on insecticide persistence. In the laboratory, the LC 90 levels were determined for each insecticide in several soils. Studies measured the effects of moisture and temperature on the change in biological activity of the six insecticides in soils of varying texture, pH, and percent organic matter. All insecticides were influenced by pH, to varying degrees, in at least one test. Carbofuran persistence was most sensitive to increasing pH. The influence of soil texture was variable. Loss of carbofuran activity in sandy soils was attributed to leaching. Mortality from chlorpyrifos was inversely proportional to percent clay. Soil pH and texture influences on activity of <b>fonofos</b> and isofenphos were inconsistent. The effect of organic matter on biological activity of the insecticides was minimal. Regression models indicated that time accounted for approximately 55 % of variation in the activity of phorate and terbufos with little effect attributed to soil factors. Variation in chlorpyrifos mortality increased an average of 17 % (from 25 %) by the inclusion of soil factors in the models. The LC 90 s revealed that terbufos was the most toxic and <b>fonofos</b> the least toxic insecticide. Higher moisture levels accelerated the decline of <b>fonofos</b> and terbufos activity.

Enhanced degradation in the phenomenon whereby a soil-applied insecticide is rapidly degraded by populations of soil microorganisms previously exposed to it or a similar insecticide. A laboratory methodology was employed in these studies;The enhanced degradation of isofenphos was investigated in soil in order to elucidate the chemistry and microbiology of this phenomenon. Isofenphos was most rapidly degraded in Iowa cornfield soils that had a history of isofenphos insecticide use. Between 13 and 42 % of an applied dose of 5 ppm remained as isofenphos after 4 weeks in soil with isofenphos use history, whereas between 63 and 75 % remained incomparable nonhistory soils. Soils with enhanced isofenphos degradation contained an adapted population of soil microorganisms responsible for its degradation. Degradation products of isofenphos detected in cultures of adapted soil microorganisms included isopropyl salicylate, CO[subscript] 2, and polar products;The specificity of enhanced degradation within the organophosphorus insecticide class was investigated. The degradation rates and product distributions of chloropyrifos, <b>fonofos,</b> ethoprop, terbufos, and phorate were not dramatically altered in soils containing microbial populations adapted to rapidly degrade isofenphos. An Arthrobacter sp. isolated from soils with a history of isofenphos use rapidly metabolized isofenphos in pure culture, but did not metabolize or cometabolize any of the other 5 organophosphorus insecticides.

This strain showed greatest similarity {{to members of the}} order Enterobacteriales and was closest to members of the Enterobacter asburiae group. The ability of the strain to mineralize chlorpyrifos was investigated under different culture conditions, and the strain utilized chlorpyrifos as the sole source of carbon and phosphorus. Studies with ring or uniformly labeled [14 C]chlorpyrifos in liquid culture demonstrated that the isolate hydrolyzed chlorpyrifos to diethylthiophospshate (DETP) and 3, 5, 6 -trichloro- 2 -pyridinol, and utilized DETP for growth and energy. The isolate was found to possess mono- and diphosphatase activities along with a phosphotriesterase activity. Addition of other sources of carbon (glucose and succinate) resulted in slowing down of the initial rate of degradation of chlorpyrifos. The isolate degraded the DETP-containing organophosphates parathion, diazinon, coumaphos, and isazofos when provided as the sole source of carbon and phosphorus, but not fenamiphos, <b>fonofos,</b> ethoprop, and cadusafos, which have different side chains. Studies of the molecular basis of degradation suggested that the degrading ability could be polygenic and chromosome based. Further studies revealed that the strain possessed a novel phosphotriesterase enzyme system, as the gene coding for this enzyme had a different sequence from the widely studied organophosphate-degrading gene (opd). The addition of strain B- 14 (106 cells g− 1) to soil with a low indigenous population of chlorpyrifos-degrading bacteria treated with 35 mg of chlorpyrifos kg− 1 resulted in a higher degradation rate than was observed in noninoculated soils.

40|$|A recent {{concern in}} the {{widespread}} use of soil-applied pesticides is the phenomenon of enhanced degradation by soil microorganisms. This study investigated selected factors influencing the enhanced microbial degradation of pesticides. Because hydrolysis is a significant initial step in the degradation of pesticides, the role of hydrolysis metabolites in the induction of enhanced degradation was studied. Salicylic acid, p-nitrophenol, and 2, 4 -dichlorophenol conditioned the soil for enhanced degradation of their parent compounds, isofenphos, parathion, and 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, respectively. Repeated applications of 3, 5, 6 -trichloro- 2 -pyridinol resulted in increased persistence of its parent compound, chlorpyrifos. Pretreatment of soil with hydrolysis metabolites of carbofuran, diazinon, <b>fonofos,</b> and 2, 4, 5 -T did not have any effect on the degradation of their respective parent compounds;The properties of pesticide metabolites such as toxicity and availability to microorganisms may influence their potential to condition soils for the enhanced degradation of their parent pesticides. Mobility studies using a soil thin-layer chromatography technique indicated that for a pesticide to be susceptible to enhanced degradation, it need not necessarily be very mobile. Because some metabolites are capable of inducing or inhibiting the enhanced degradation process the mobility/availability of hydrolysis metabolites is of practical significance. Soil pH significantly affected mobility of most of the chemicals studied, with increased mobility in soils with higher pH 2 ̆ 7 s. Water solubility, by itself, was not a good predictor of mobility and structural similarity {{does not seem to be}} an indicator of mobility. The Microtox system was employed to determine the toxicity of pesticides and their metabolites to bacteria. Hydrolysis metabolites of pesticides susceptible to enhanced degradation (isofenphos, diazinon, and carbofuran) recorded higher EC[subscript] 50 values, indicating their low toxicity to bacteria;The effect of manuring on the degradation of pesticides was investigated.

Sifting soil samples through screens was effective for estimating post-feeding third instar, prepupae, pupae, and teneral adult MFB in the soil. Berlese funnel extraction {{was the most}} effective method for estimating MFB larvae from peppermint rhizomes. Results of Iwao's (1968) patchiness regression indicated that MFB have an aggregated spatial distribution in the field. Aggregation could {{be influenced by the}} original deposition of MFB eggs and by agronomic practices on peppermint in central Oregon. Yearly accumulation of degree-days was more effective to predict immature MFB development than either calendar dates or twenty-year degree-day averages. Degree-days were calculated using the Baskerville Emin single sine method and a lower development threshold of 5 °C. In the _ rhizomes initial detection of first instar MFB were observed at 226 degreedays, initial detection of second instar MFB were observed at 319 degree-days and initial detection of third instar MFB were observed at 433 degree-days. In the soil initial detection of prepupae MFB were observed at 582 degree-days, initial detection of pupae were observed at 757 degree-days and initial detection of teneral adults were observed at 864 degree-days. Initial detection of first instar MFB was considered to be an approximation of egg hatch. Results also suggested that the climatic station closest to where developmental predictions are to be made should be used. Of the registered insecticides tested, oxamyl, <b>fonofos</b> and chlorpyrifos provided significant control of immature MFB. Degree-days provided a more reliable method for timing insecticide applications than calendar dates and allowed early treatment in the spring prior to significant damage to the peppermint rhizomes. Two species of entomogenous nematodes, Heterorhabditis heliothidis and Neoaplectana carpocapsae effectively controlled third instar, prepupae and pupae MFB in the soil during early June. However, early spring applications may not be effective because of the cold temperatures, small size of the larvae, and their concealment in the rhizomes...|$|E

To access the final edited and published work see [URL] this work, a durable and easy to handle thin film microextraction (TFME) device is reported. The membrane is comprised of poly(divinylbenzene) (DVB) resin particles suspended in a high-density polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) glue, which is spread onto a carbon fiber mesh. The currently presented membrane was shown to exhibit a substantially lesser amount of siloxane bleed during thermal desorption, while providing a statistically similar extraction efficiency toward {{a broad spectrum of}} analytes varying in polarity when compared to an unsupported DVB/PDMS membrane of similar shape and size which was prepared with previously published methods. With the use of hand-portable GC-TMS instrumentation, membranes cut with dimensions 40 mm long by 4. 85 mm wide and 40 ± 5 μm thick (per side) were shown to extract 21. 2, 19. 8, 18. 5, 18, 4, 26. 8, and 23. 7 times the amount of 2, 4 dichlorophenol, 2, 4, 6 trichlorophenol, phorate D 10, <b>fonofos,</b> chloropyrifos, and parathion, respectively, within 15 min from a 10 ppb aqueous solution as compared to a 65 μm DVB/PDMS solid phase microextraction (SPME) fiber. A portable high volume desorption module prototype was also evaluated and shown to be appropriate for the desorption of analytes with a volatility equal to or lesser than benzene when employed in conjunction with TFME membranes. Indeed, the coupling of these TFME devices to hand-portable gas chromatography toroidial ion trap mass spectrometry (GC-TMS) instrumentation was shown to push detection limits for these pesticides down to the hundreds of ppt levels, nearing that which can be achieved with benchtop instrumentation. Where these membranes can also be coupled to benchtop instrumentation {{it is reasonable to assume}} that detection limits could be pushed down even further. As a final proof of the concept, the first ever, entirely on-site TFME-GC-TMS analysis was performed at a construction impacted lake. Results had indicated the presence of contaminants such as toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene, 2, 2, 4 -trimethyl- 1, 3 -pentanediol diisobutyrate, and tris(1 -chloro- 2 -propyl) phosphate, which stood out from other naturally occurring compounds detected. the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of 46 herbicides, 17 fungicides and 15 insecticides on transformations of urea nitrogen in soil was studied by determining {{the effects of}} different amounts of each pesticide on the amounts of urea hydrolyzed and the amounts of nitrite and nitrate produced when samples of two coarse-textured and two fine-textured soils were incubated aerobically at 20 (DEGREES) C for various times after treatment with urea. The pesticides tested are commonly used for control of weedy plant species, plant pathogens and soil insects {{in a range of}} cropping situations;When the 46 herbicides tested were applied at the rate of 5 (mu) g g(2 ̆ 7 - 1) soil, they had little or no effect on urea hydrolysis or nitrification of urea nitrogen in the four soils. When they were applied at the rate of 50 (mu) g g(2 ̆ 7 - 1) soil, only dinoseb retarded urea hydrolysis in all four of the soils, but all except siduron retarded nitrification of urea nitrogen in one of the coarse-textured soils and ten (2, 4 -D amine, 2, 4 -D ester, propanil, chlorpropham, alachlor, amitrole, dinoseb, propham, fenoxaprop ethyl and tridphane) retarded nitrification of urea nitrogen in all four soils;When the 17 fungicides tested were applied at the rate of 1 (mu) g g(2 ̆ 7 - 1) soil, only maneb retarded hydrolysis of urea and only terrazole retarded nitrification of urea nitrogen in the four soils used. When they were applied at the rate of 50 (mu) g g(2 ̆ 7 - 1) soil, most of them retarded urea hydrolysis in the two coarse-textured soils and all except anilazine, benomyl, chloroneb, fenarimol, iprodione and PCNB markedly retarded nitrification of urea nitrogen in all four of the soils;When the 15 insecticides tested were applied at the rate of 5 (mu) g g(2 ̆ 7 - 1) soil, none of them retarded urea hydrolysis in the four soils used, but five (carbaryl, lindane, trimethacarb, diazinon and fenitrothion) retarded nitrification of urea nitrogen in the two coarse-textured soils.

Microfiche. xiii, 89 leaves ill. 29 cmThis {{study was}} {{undertaken}} to (1) obtain {{a better understanding}} of the interrelationship of ants, mealybug, and mealybug wilt disease of pineapple in Hawaii, and (2) to develop alternative methods of ant control. The study was in three parts: 1) a follow-up study of the epidemiology of mealybug wilt in a pineapple field at Poamoho, Oahu, Hawaii, Which was previously used for a study on the biology and ecology of big-headed ant, Pheido 1 e megacephala (Fabricius), and the gray pineapple mealybug, Dysmicoccus neobrevipes Beardsley, the two most important insects associated with the mealybug wilt of pineapple; 2) laboratory screening of potentially useful insecticide compounds for possible use as ant baits or as broadcast spray; and 3) field tests of promising ant baits and broadcast spray for ant control on the Island of Molokai. The population density of the big-headed ant was higher during the second crop than during the first crop of pineapple at both Poamoho and Molokai. No mealybug wilt plants were found in plots with excellent ant control, while the number of mealybug wilt plants increased sharply during the second crop in blocks where ants were not controlled. The incidence of mealybug wilt was higher at the edge of the plot than toward the middle of the field. Infestation of the Mo 10 kai experimental planting (20. 3 ha divided into 102 0. 2 -ha plots) by big-headed ants started at the edge of the planting adjacent to an abandoned field and along a waste area. The ant dispersal and percentage of ant infested plots increased progressively with the age of the pineapples. A baited stake technique is described for use of evaluation of big-headed ant populations. Soybean oil mixed with peanut butter (50 : 50) was the most attractive bait material of all those tested for the big-headed ant workers. The greatest foraging activity of the ant occurred after sunset. Sixteen pesticides were selected from laboratory screening tests and tested as baits. Baits of AC 217300 (2 (1 H) -Pyrimidinone, tetrahydro- 5, 5 -dimethyl-, [3 - 4 -(trifluoromethyl) phenyl]- 1 -[2 -[4 (trifluoromethyl) phenyl]=ethenyl]- 2 -propenylidene]hydrazone) were acceptable to the ant and were more effective than any of the other pesticides studied. Field tests were conducted with baits of AC 217300 (85 % corncob grits, 15 % soybean oil, and AC 217300 at concentration of 1500 to 7500 ppm) at a rate of 2. 24 kg bait per hectare. Results showed that the baits at 7500 ppm were as effective as mirex baits (0. 3 %) for controlling ~. megacephala. Broadcast sprays of 8 insecticides were applied for control of P. megacephala in the pineapple field at Molokai. Carbofuran, chlordane, diazinon, <b>fonofos,</b> heptachlor, and acephate all gave a high initial kill of the ants one day after the treatment. However, five months after the treatment, only heptachlor and chlordane continued to give good control of the ants. Tests with diazinon and acephate showed that their effectiveness was affected by the size of the pineapple plants. Additional tests with acephate indicated it has some promise for ant control. Pest management strategies for control of pineapple mealybug wilt disease are discussed. Information of ant movement would be useful in ant control programs. Destroying ants and mealybugs along edges of pineapple plantings may prevent pest migrations into newly planted fields. Use of insecticides only at the periphery of the fields and in uncultivated areas contiguous with new plantings may effectively control the ants, thus minimizing the overall use of insecticides...|$|E
