2500|$|... 200 U.S. gallon (758l) ferry tank: A {{conformal}} tub-shaped <b>jettisonable</b> <b>tank</b> made of paper, which barely {{cleared the}} ground on grass airfields, {{was used as an}} interim measure between 30 July and 31 August 1943.|$|E
5000|$|The {{fuselage}} of the Mureaux {{was built}} around four duralumin tube longerons, with easily repaired connections to tubular diagonals and with removable panels covering the forward part. Two removable engine mountings allowed either a [...] Hispano-Suiza 12Hb V-12, a type often identified {{at the time}} as the V-12 500 hp (its officially approved power) Hispano-Suiza, [...] or a water-cooled [...] Salmson 18 Cm radial engine to be fitted. Both engine types used an adjustable honeycomb radiator projecting from the fuselage underside and were fed fuel from a <b>jettisonable</b> <b>tank</b> behind the engine and ahead of the engine firewall. The Hispano version was designated the Les Mureaux 3 and the Salmson powered aircraft Les Mureaux 4, the latter 78 kg heavier.|$|E
50|$|On 23 December 1942, the “Regia Aeronautica” command with a {{circular}} letter authorized {{the use of}} under-wing <b>jettisonable</b> <b>tanks,</b> to increase {{the range of the}} C.202s of 6° and 7° Gruppo, based in Pantelleria.|$|R
50|$|Mark VII with <b>jettisonable</b> fuel <b>tanks,</b> new studded tracks, {{oil cooler}} and {{protected}} headlights.|$|R
5000|$|Spindle-shaped <b>jettisonable</b> {{external}} <b>tanks</b> with {{a capacity}} of 650 gal, fitted to the sponsons and braced by struts attached to the fuselage ...|$|R
50|$|The B-47B {{was also}} {{fitted with a}} pair of <b>jettisonable</b> {{external}} <b>tanks,</b> carried between the inboard and outboard engine assemblies. These external drop tanks were very large, with a capacity of 1780 usgal L.|$|R
50|$|IS-3M: (1952) Modernized {{version of}} IS-3. Fitted with {{additional}} <b>jettisonable</b> external fuel <b>tanks</b> and improved hull welding.|$|R
25|$|The {{improved}} HH-3E variant {{would follow}} later, with eight built, and all 50 CH-3Es {{were converted to}} this standard. Known as the Jolly Green Giant, the HH-3E featured protective armor, self-sealing tanks, a retractable inflight refueling probe, <b>jettisonable</b> external <b>tanks,</b> a high-speed hoist, and other specialized equipment.|$|R
25|$|Drop tanks, {{external}} tanks, wing tanks, pylon tanks or belly {{tanks are}} all terms {{used to describe}} auxiliary externally mounted fuel tanks. Drop tanks are generally expendable and often <b>jettisonable.</b> External <b>tanks</b> are commonplace on modern military aircraft and occasionally found in civilian ones, although the latter {{are less likely to}} be discarded except in the event of emergency.|$|R

25|$|Fitted with Emerson nose turret {{with two}} 20 mm cannon {{replacing}} solid nose of earlier versions, while retaining dorsal and tail turrets. New, larger, <b>jettisonable</b> tip <b>tanks,</b> with traverable searchlight slaved to nose turret {{in front of}} starboard tip-tank and AN/APS-8 radar in nose of port tip-tank. AN/APS-20 search radar under fuselage. Later aircraft featured glazed observation nose and MAD gear in place of nose and tail turrets, and revised crew accommodation, with many earlier aircraft refitted. Dorsal turret often removed. 424 built.|$|R
25|$|In July the 56th FG {{was moved}} from its {{comfortable}} quarters at Horsham St. Faith to a much-less improved installation at RAF Halesworth, {{along the coast}} of Suffolk, both to be nearer to German-occupied territory and to allow Horsham St. Faith to be completed as a heavy bomber base. On 12 August it used partially filled and unpressurized 200-gallon ferry <b>tanks</b> as <b>jettisonable</b> fuel <b>tanks</b> {{for the first time in}} combat, escorting bombers headed for Bonn, Germany. In its first four months of missions, the 56th Group shot down 9 aircraft and lost 10.|$|R
50|$|The Bobolink had two-bay biplane {{wings and}} was {{powered by the}} same Bentley BR2 rotary engine as used by the {{competing}} Sopwith Snipe. An unusual feature of the aircraft {{was the use of}} <b>jettisonable</b> fuel <b>tanks.</b> These were fitted behind the pilot and separated by a sheet of armour, allowing an individual tank to be jettisoned {{in the event of a}} fire. While the Bobolink and Snipe had similar performance, the Snipe was easier to build, while the Bobolink was claimed to have poor ground handling, with the Snipe winning the Camel replacement competition. Only a single prototype was produced.|$|R
5000|$|The 110 was {{designed}} as a contender in the so-called [...] "Jockey" [...] lightweight interceptor contest in which it competed against 9 other types. It was of all-metal construction, with fabric wing skinning. Basically a parasol monoplane, it was fitted with a <b>jettisonable</b> aerofoil-section fuel <b>tank</b> inserted in the fuselage aft of the main undercarriage.|$|R
5000|$|The {{fuselage}} of the D.VI was circular in cross-section, {{with its}} 11-cylinder, [...] Siemens-Halske Sh.IIIa rotary engine completely cowled {{in the nose}} driving a four blade propeller. The fuselage diameter decreased markedly to the tail but an unusual <b>jettisonable</b> fuel <b>tank</b> bulged out below for about 35% of the overall length. The blunt delta shaped tailplane was mounted at mid-fuselage height and had a single balanced elevator. The fin was small, with a generous, balanced, swept back, blunt topped rudder. The fighter had a simple, fixed conventional undercarriage, with mainwheels on a single axle supported by wire braced V-struts to the lower fuselage. Its tall tailskid was faired aft forming a little ventral fin.|$|R

50|$|Despite {{protecting}} his strategic bombing force from demands of other services and allies, Arnold {{was forced to}} divert resources from the Eighth to support operations in North Africa, crippling the Eighth in its infancy and nearly killing it. Eaker (now Eighth Air Force commander) found from experience that the pre-war doctrine of daylight precision bombing, developed at the Air Corps Tactical School {{as a foundation for}} separating the Air Force from the Army, was mistaken in its tenet that heavily armed bombers could reach any target without the support of long-range escort fighters. Early in 1943 he began requesting more fighters and <b>jettisonable</b> fuel <b>tanks</b> to increase their range, in addition to repeated requests to increase the size of his small bombing force.|$|R
50|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1938, Dornier issued manufacturing specification No. 1323, recognising {{the need for a}} twin-engine bomber or long-range reconnaissance aircraft powered by Daimler-Benz DB 601B engines. In February 1938 the Reichsluftfahrtministerium (RLM - Air Ministry) authorized a testing program.Dornier worked on a version of the Do 17M with the all round vision cockpit of the Do 17Z and a fuselage having a large bomb bay capable of holding a maximum of two 500 kg and ten 50 kg bombs. For reconnaissance an Rb 50/30 movie camera was fitted ahead of the front spar of the wing, and an Rb 20/30 was mounted in the second bomb bay. <b>Jettisonable</b> fuel <b>tanks</b> were carried in the forward bomb bay. For smoke-laying, the aircraft could be fitted with two Type S200 smoke generators. Dornier also envisaged the Do 217 as a naval dive bomber, in which case it was to be fitted with twin floats. In April and May 1938, the Do 217 WV1 and WV2 prototypes were produced.|$|R
50|$|Briz-M, GRAU index 14S43, is {{designed}} for injecting large payloads into a low, medium-height or high geosynchronous orbit. Briz-M is a twin upper stage consisting of a core module (using Briz-KM as the baseline) and a <b>jettisonable</b> add-on doughnut <b>tank</b> surrounding the core. It {{is powered by a}} pump-fed gimballed main engine, the 14D30. The main engine can be restarted 8 times in flight and allows precision placement of the spacecraft into orbit. Orbital lifetime of the Briz-M is limited by available onboard battery power and is currently 24 hours. The total time of the standard Proton/Briz-M mission to geosynchronous orbit profile from lift-off to spacecraft separation is approximately 9.3 hours. A Proton launch vehicle with a Briz-M upper stage can also inject payloads to Earth escape trajectories.|$|R
500|$|The {{most unusual}} {{feature of the}} {{aircraft}} was its use of [...] "Metalite" [...] for its skin. This was made of balsa that was sandwiched between two thin sheets of aluminum. [...] "Fabrilite" [...] was also used for the surfaces of the vertical stabilizer and rudder; this was similar to Metalite, but used fiberglass instead of aluminum. Two fuel tanks were fitted {{in the center of}} the fuselage. The forward tank, ahead of the wing, contained [...] and the rear tank, [...] These were supplemented by two <b>jettisonable</b> [...] tip <b>tanks.</b> The cockpit was well forward and was provided with a bubble canopy which gave the pilot good visibility. He was provided with a Mk 6 lead-computing gyro gunsight. Underneath the cockpit were four 20mm (0.79in) M3 autocannon. Their 600 rounds of ammunition were carried behind the pilot. The empty casings of the two upper guns were retained in the aircraft, while those from the two lower guns were ejected overboard.|$|R
5000|$|The {{fighter-bomber}} version (F-86H) {{could carry}} up to 2,000 lb (907 kg) of bombs, including an external fuel-type tank that could carry napalm. Unguided 2.75 in (70 mm) rockets were used on some fighters on training missions, but 5 inch (127 mm) rockets were later carried on combat operations. The F-86 {{could also be}} fitted {{with a pair of}} external <b>jettisonable</b> jet fuel <b>tanks</b> (four on the F-86F beginning in 1953) that extended the range of the aircraft. Both the interceptor and fighter-bomber versions carried six 0.50 in (12.7 mm) M3 Browning machine guns with electrically boosted feed in the nose (later versions of the F-86H carried four 20 mm (0.79 in) cannons instead of machine guns). Firing at a rate of 1,200 rounds per minute, the [...]50 in (12.7 mm) guns were harmonized to converge at 1,000 ft (300 m) in front of the aircraft, using armor-piercing (AP) and armor-piercing incendiary (API) rounds, with one armor-piercing incendiary tracer (APIT) for every five AP or API rounds. The API rounds used during the Korean War contained magnesium, which were designed to ignite upon impact but burned poorly above 35000 ft as oxygen levels were insufficient to sustain combustion at that height. Initial planes were fitted with the Mark 18 manual-ranging computing gun sight. The last 24 F-86A-5-Nas and F-86E were equipped with the A-1CM gunsight-AN/APG-30 radar, which used radar to automatically compute a target's range, which later proved to be advantageous against MiG opponents over Korea.|$|R
