5|$|The size of {{the welding}} torch nozzle depends {{on the amount of}} {{shielded}} area desired. The {{size of the}} <b>gas</b> <b>nozzle</b> depends upon the diameter of the electrode, the joint configuration, and the availability of access to the joint by the welder. The inside diameter of the nozzle is preferably at least three times the diameter of the electrode, but there are no hard rules. The welder judges the effectiveness of the shielding and increases the nozzle size to increase the area protected by the external gas shield as needed. The nozzle must be heat resistant and thus is normally made of alumina or a ceramic material, but fused quartz, a high purity glass, offers greater visibility. Devices can be inserted into the nozzle for special applications, such as gas lenses or valves to improve the control shielding gas flow to reduce turbulence and introduction of contaminated atmosphere into the shielded area.

50|$|There are {{two ways}} of using {{electric}} arcs for surface activation: non-transferred and transferred electric arcs. In the non-transferred technique, both electrodes {{are part of the}} plasma source. One of them also acts as a <b>gas</b> <b>nozzle</b> producing a stream of plasma. After the plasma stream leaves the arc region, the ions recombine quickly, leaving the hot gas having high concentrations of chemically active hydrogen, nitrogen and oxygen atoms and compounds, which is also called remote plasma. The temperature of this gas stream is of the order of 200 - 500 C. The gas is very reactive allowing high surface treatment speeds when only a short-time contact with the substrate is sufficient to achieve the activation effect. This gas can activate all materials, including temperature-sensitive plastics. Moreover, it is electrically neutral and free from electric potentials, which is important for activation of sensitive electronics.|$|E
50|$|The basic {{plasma cutting}} process {{involves}} creating an electrical channel of superheated, electrically ionized gas i.e. plasma from the plasma cutter itself, {{through the work}} piece to be cut, thus forming a completed electric circuit back to the plasma cutter via a grounding clamp. This is accomplished by a compressed gas (oxygen, air, inert and others depending on material being cut) which is blown through a focused nozzle at high speed toward the work piece. An electrical arc is then formed within the gas, between an electrode near or integrated into the <b>gas</b> <b>nozzle</b> and the work piece itself. The electrical arc ionizes some of the gas, thereby creating an electrically conductive channel of plasma. As electricity from the cutter torch travels down this plasma it delivers sufficient heat to melt through the work piece. At the same time, much of the high velocity plasma and compressed gas blow the hot molten metal away, thereby separating i.e. cutting through the work piece.|$|E

50|$|Any {{impairment}} {{of the electric}} contact between sensor scanning element and workpiece is, {{in the case of}} electric-contact sensors, problematic, e.g. welding spatters at the shielding <b>gas</b> <b>nozzle,</b> scale and rolling skin on the workpiece surface or through a wire electrode end which has molten spheroidally and has adherence of slag.When mechanical-contact sensors are used, the scanning elements must be adapted to the respective groove shapes. Butt welds with a square butt joint preparation must have a groove gap of more than 3 mm; in overlap joints the top plate must have a thickness of more than 3 mm.The sensor must be mounted separately from the welding torch.Thus, the groove scanning is mainly carried out in a leading position in front of the torch. If the welds are mainly straight, this adjustment is no problem. It is also possible to use scanning element arrays (e.g. fork callipers or separated scanning elements for height and lateral scanning which allow scanning in the torch level and thus weld scanning which is almost free from errors. Apart from the torch guidance along a weld groove, mechanical contact sensors can also be applied for detection of the weld start and end of the weld.|$|E

40|$|The {{deposition}} of tungsten by decomposing a W(CO) sub 6 precursor gas under a focussed electron beam is a promising technique for X-ray mask repair. A lateral resolution of 0, 2 mym and a dot {{growth rate of}} 16 nm/s had been demonstrated in a simple experiment using a gas pressure cell inside a scanning electron microscope (1). For automated mask handling our SEM is now equipped with a <b>gas</b> <b>nozzle</b> arrangement (Micrion Corp.) with temperature controlled W(CO) sub 6 reservoir inside the vacuum system. With the common <b>gas</b> <b>nozzle</b> opening of 500 mym in diameter (2), {{the temperature of the}} reservoir could not be raised beyond 50 degree C because the corresponding gas flow deteriorated the vacuum in the system to a maximum allowed pressure of 1 - 10 high - 5 mbar. At these conditions the resulting W deposition rates did not reach the values of the gas pressure cell experiment reported in (1). To increase the axial flux at constant total flux, the angular distribution of molecules leaving the <b>gas</b> <b>nozzle</b> was characterized for different nozzle geometries by calculation and experiment.
