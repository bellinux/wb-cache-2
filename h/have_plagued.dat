25|$|The above {{shows the}} {{contribution}} Petty made to theoretical {{issues that have}} dominated the later subject of economics ever since. He covered such {{a wide range of}} topics according to his political arithmetic method, i.e. like modern economists, he set out to prove his claims by finding data and statistics, rather than relying on anecdotal evidence. He wrote rigorously, but also with concision and humour. The issues that Petty thought about and wrote are major topics that <b>have</b> <b>plagued</b> the minds of economic theorists ever since.|$|E
25|$|The bridge {{superstructure}} {{is designed}} to withstand shipping accidents and the natural disasters that <b>have</b> <b>plagued</b> Charleston’s history. The span {{is designed to}} endure wind gusts in excess of 300mph (480km/h), far stronger {{than those of the}} worst storm in Charleston's history, Hurricane Hugo in 1989. Engineers also considered the 1886 earthquake that nearly leveled Charleston. The Ravenel Bridge is designed to withstand an earthquake of approximately 7.4 on the Richter magnitude scale without total failure. To protect the bridge from errant ships, the towers are flanked by one-acre rock islands. Ships will run aground on the islands before colliding with the towers.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{dangerous}} forms of wine fraud is when producers add hazardous materials such as lead(II) acetate ("sugar of lead"), diethylene glycol, and methanol to wine in order to increase sweetness. Some chemicals may be used to mask other wine faults and unpleasant aroma. Government authorities, such as the European Union and the American Food and Drug Administration, across the globe have set up laws and regulations of acceptable chemicals that can be added to wine in order to avoid some of the scandals that <b>have</b> <b>plagued</b> certain wine producing countries in the 20th century.|$|E

25|$|Restrictions on {{transport}} {{introduced by}} Spanish dictator Francisco Franco closed the land frontier in 1969 and also prohibited any air or ferry connections. In 1982, the land border was reopened. As {{the result of}} an agreement signed in Córdoba on 18 September 2006 between Gibraltar, the United Kingdom and Spain, the Spanish government agreed to relax border controls at the frontier that <b>have</b> <b>plagued</b> locals for decades; in return, Britain paid increased pensions to Spanish workers who lost their jobs when Franco closed the border. Telecommunication restrictions were lifted in February 2007 and air links with Spain were restored in December 2006.|$|E
25|$|The NBA 2K {{series has}} {{achieved}} consistent critical and commercial success. Elements {{of the series}} that are frequently praised include its presentation, specifically its commentary, attention to detail, and soundtrack, its abundance of content, its overall gameplay, and its consistency in terms of yearly releases without any drastic dips in quality. Technical issues <b>have</b> <b>plagued</b> many of the releases, however, particularly {{in regards to the}} online components. The introduction of microtransactions into the series has also been scrutinized, while the story-focused incarnations of the MyCareer mode have received mixed responses. Numerous games in the series have been lauded for being among the highest-quality sports games available, especially in comparison with other basketball games, such as the NBA Live series, published by EA Sports.|$|E
25|$|The social {{problems}} associated with poverty, from crime to drug addiction, <b>have</b> <b>plagued</b> the area for decades. Despite the decline of crime compared to its peak during the crack and heroin epidemics, violent crime {{continues to be a}} serious problem in the community, especially gang-related gun violence. Empty lots and unused storefronts are common in Brownsville due to high rates of crime, mostly in the area's public housing developments. A reporter for The New York Times observed that some of the area's playgrounds were inadequately maintained with broken lights and unlocked gates, and that shootings were common in these public housing developments. Brownsville was so dangerous that one UPS driver, robbed at gunpoint, needed an armed security guard to accompany him while delivering packages to houses in the neighborhood. In an effort to reduce crime, the NYPD started a stop-and-frisk program in the early 2000s; this was controversial especially in Brownsville, with 93% of residents in one eight-block area reportedly being stopped and frisked (compared to a 7% rate citywide). However, serious crime per resident is decreasing, and from 2000 to 2011, the rate dropped from 45.0 to 35.3 serious crimes per 1,000 residents.|$|E

500|$|PC Zone said, [...] "It's hard, {{its opening}} acts don't match {{the quality of}} those which follow and some {{characters}} grate—but as a modern rendition of a traditional formula, The Angel Of Death has both pointed and clicked wisely.

[...] Adventure Classic Gaming said, [...] "Not only the game succeeds in addressing many of the flaws in Broken Sword: The Sleeping Dragon that <b>have</b> <b>plagued</b> the previous title, this sequel is able to surpass the high standard and expectation set forth by past games in the series to create yet another chapter in {{the legend of the}} Knights Templar."

He praised the episode for feeling [...] "like a big answer to many of the issues that <b>have</b> <b>plagued</b> the show so far this season", specifically pointing to Dwight's meta-commentary on Cathy's [...] "lack of personality". He moreover wrote that he was {{looking forward to the}} rest of the season and the change in dynamic. Despite this, he criticized Dwight's role in the episode, comparing his orientation to Michael's conference room lectures and wrote he had a [...] "distaste" [...] for the broader moments for the character. He ultimately gave the episode an A-, his highest grade for an eighth-season episode.|$|E

Entertainment Weekly writer Leah Greenblatt commented that [...] "it's {{hard to imagine a}} more explicit snapshot of the highly publicized family problems that <b>have</b> <b>plagued</b> the star than [...] "Confessions of a Broken Heart (Daughter to Father)"". PopMatters's Whitney Strub said [...] "Confessions of a Broken Heart (Daughter to Father)" [...] "immediately commences with a line about 'wait for the postman to bring me a letter', which suggests songwriters dipping into the well of cliché without worrying about freshness," [...] while commenting that [...] "the world might not need another version of Britney Spears' 'E-Mail My Heart', but good lord, that song came out in 1999. Perhaps a text-message might arrive faster than snail-mail in late 2005, should Lohan's song-persona deign to enter the 21st century".|$|E

500|$|A {{pattern of}} {{political}} and financial motivation, {{and a lack of}} understanding of the geography and ecology of the Everglades <b>have</b> <b>plagued</b> the history of drainage projects. The Everglades are a part of a massive watershed that originates near Orlando and drains into Lake Okeechobee, a vast and shallow lake. As the lake exceeds its capacity in the wet season, the water forms a flat and very wide river, about [...] long and [...] wide. As the land from Lake Okeechobee slopes gradually to Florida Bay, water flows at a rate of half a mile (0.8km) a day. Before human activity in the Everglades, the system comprised the lower third of the Florida peninsula. The first attempt to drain the region was made by real estate developer Hamilton Disston in 1881. Disston's sponsored canals were unsuccessful, but the land he purchased for them stimulated economic and population growth that attracted railway developer Henry Flagler. Flagler built a railroad along the east coast of Florida and eventually to Key West; towns grew and farmland was cultivated along the rail line.|$|E
500|$|Peter and Olivia (Anna Torv) {{are sent}} by Walter {{to observe the}} {{building}} as he monitors seismic equipment from the lab. Peter and Olivia go to a bar while waiting, where Olivia tries to kiss Peter but becomes uncomfortable, knowing {{of the influence of}} her parallel universe doppelganger, Fauxlivia (Torv), on Peter. Her emotional reaction triggers her ability to see once again the [...] "shimmer" [...] around Peter that marks him [...] as a native of the parallel universe. She excuses herself and steps outside for some fresh air, followed by Peter. Olivia notices a similar glow emanating from the windows of apartment 6B in the Rosencrantz building, owned by the widow Mrs. Alice Merchant (Phyllis Somerville). When Olivia and Peter enter the apartment, Olivia (but not Peter) can see a shimmering figure that Alice claims is the ghost of her late husband Derek (Ken Pogue). Walter surmises that the figure is a parallel Derek seen across a crack between the universes. If the crack widens, Walter predicts they would see occurrences of the same singularities that <b>have</b> <b>plagued</b> the parallel universe, and suggests the use of the same amber-like compound they had previously recovered ("The Ghost Network") to limit the damage. With Massive Dynamic's resources, they are able to recreate the amber and a release system to encase the building, but hold it in reserve as a last resort only.|$|E
