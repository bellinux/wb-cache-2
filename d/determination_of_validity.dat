Not coincidentally, it was formed shortly after {{the organization of the}} Grand Lodge of Chile, and it has maintained a close relationship with Chilean Freemasonry throughout its life. As such, it represented the anticlericalist position in Chilean politics, and was instrumental in producing the [...] "theological reforms" [...] in Chilean law in the early 1880s. These laws removed the cemeteries from the control of the Roman Catholic Church, established a civil registry of births and death in place of the previous recordkeeping of the church, and established a civil law of matrimony, which removed the <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> <b>validity</b> of marriages from the church. Prior to these laws, it was impossible for non-Catholics to contract marriage in Chile, and meant that any children they produced were illegitimate. Non-Catholics had also been barred from burial in Catholic cemeteries, which were virtually the only cemeteries in the country; instead, non-Catholics were buried in the beaches, and even on the Santa Lucia Hill in Santiago, which, in the 19th century, functioned as Santiago's dump.|$|E

The aim of present study was development and <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> <b>validity</b> and rater reliability of Persian version of the Consensus Auditory Perceptual Evaluation of Voice (CAPE -V). Methods: The qualitative content validity was detected by collecting 10 questionnaires from 9 experienced speech and language pathologists and a linguist. For reliability purposes, the voice samples of 40 dysphonic (neurogenic, functional with and without laryngeal lesions) adults (20 - 45 years of age) and 10 normal healthy speakers were recorded. The samples included sustain of vowels and reading the 6 sentences of Persian version of the consensus auditory perceptual evaluation of voice called the ATSHA. Results: The qualitative content validity was proved for developed Persian version of the consensus auditory perceptual evaluation of voice. Cronbach’s alpha was high (0. 95). Intra-rater reliability coefficients ranged from 0. 86 for overall severity to 0. 42 for pitch; inter-rater reliability ranged from 0. 85 for overall severity to 0. 32 for pitch (p< 0. 05).

40|$|Providing assurances of {{performance}} {{is an important}} aspect of successful development and commercialization of expert systems. However, this can only be done if the quality of the system can be assured through a rigorous and effective validation process. However, a generally accepted validation technique that can, if implemented properly, lead to a <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> <b>validity</b> (a validity statement) has been an elusive goal. This has led to a generally haphazard way of validating expert systems. Validation has traditionally been mostly done through the use of test cases. A set of test cases, whose solution is previously known and benchmarked, is presented to the expert system. A comparison of the system’s solutions to that of the test cases is then used to somehow generate a validity statement. It is an intuitive way of testing the performance of any system, but it does require some consideration as to how extensively to test the system in order to develop a reliable validity statement. One completely reliable statement of a system’s validity could result from exhaustive testing of the system. However, that is commonly considered to be impractical for all but the most trivial of systems. A better means to select “good ” test cases must be developed. The authors have developed a framework for such a system (Abel, Knauf and Gonzalez 1996).

40|$|Objective: The term ‘child development’ {{is used to}} {{describe}} the skills acquired by children between birth and the age of 6 years. Development is rather an integrated process and impairment in one developmental milestone can affect other areas too. The goal {{of the present study was}} preparation and <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> <b>validity</b> and reliability of the "Newsha Developmental Scale" as an integrated scale for assessing developmental skills of Persian speaking children up to the age of six years. Methods: The Newsha developmental scale was created to thoroughly evaluate seven developmental domains in 13 age groups from birth to 72 months. It was based on the concerns of parents and nursery teachers about child development. In order to obtain the scores of normal population, 593 children in nurseries and health centers of Tehran were assessed. The children had no medical concern or confirmed disorders. With consideration of the age of each child, the score of minimum or higher in each developmental milestone was considered as the normal range. The test-retest reliability and inter-rater reliability were measured. In addition, the content validity was assessed by ideas taken from 10 specialists in the field of child development and the content validity Index (CVI) was calculated. Also construct validity was considered by establishing the effect of age on test results. Findings: A correlation of more than 95 % was shown in both test-retest and inter-rater reliabilities (P< 0. 001). The CVI of various skills of the age groups was between 0. 8 and 1, and construct validity revealed the effect of age on the test results. The gender difference was shown only in 6 items among 646 items of the scale (P< 0. 02).

In this study, Fisher’s linear discrimination function analysis was used to evaluate the results from different methods of cluster analysis (i. e. different distance criteria, different cluster procedures, standardized and un-standardized data). Furthermore, Hotelling T 2, CCC plot and multivariate analysis of variance were used to support the results. To achieve the goals, 8 rapeseed genotypes were planted in a randomized complete block design with three replications in Rice Research Institute of Iran, Rasht, durin 2005 - 2006, and 14 characteristics were measured. Analysis of variance based on the randomized complete block design showed significant differences between genotypes for all the studied traits. Comparison of means between genotypes indicated that the genotype Hyola 401 for grain yield and most of the measured characteristics was better than the other genotypes. Evaluation of phenotypic and genotypic coefficient of variations showed that most of the traits had high variability in the population. Discrimination function analysis showed that the Euclidean distance criterion was better than others and a desirable clustering was obtained by this criterion. Also, all of the data standardization methods produced similar clusters and were better than un-standardized data. Based on evaluation of dendrograms derived from different methods of cluster analysis determined that the UPGMA, complete linkage and Ward’s minimum variance methods were better than the other methods, and grouped the genotypes into three clusters. Fisher’s linear discrimination function analysis showed that UPGMA and Ward's minimum variance methods with clustering validity of 87. 5 percent, was more suitable than other cluster analysis methods; however, discrimination analysis grouped genotypes into two clusters. Tests of Hotelling T 2, CCC plot and multivariate analysis of variance supported the results from the discrimination function analysis. It seems that the UPGMA and Ward's minimum variance procedures based on Euclidean distance criterion of standardized data function better in grouping genotypes, yet, the use of discrimination function analysis is recommended to confirm the results and determine the actual groups...|$|E

Therefore, based on this biased method, the 325 subjects were selected. For gathering of data, the Levy’s questionnaire of assessing the value-satisfaction with e-learning systems’ characteristics was used. For <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> <b>validity</b> of mentioned questionnaire, the content, construct and formal validity were used. Also, for approving the reliability of this questionnaire, the test of Cronbach’s Alpha was used.

European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer has developed a 30 -item quality of life questionnaire to obtain information about the impact of disease and treatment on the daily living of cancer patients. This questionnaire was translated into many languages and used in various countries. But, validity and reliability of version 3. 0 has not yet been checked for use with Iranian patients. The aims of the present study are to evaluate {{the reliability and validity of}} the QLQ-C 30 (version 3. 0) questionnaire. Materials & Methods: We conducted an analytical cross-sectional study on 132 random samples of breast cancer patients for <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> <b>validity</b> and reliability of QLQ-C 30 (version 3. 0) questionnaire. The questionnaire was completed for all patients that referred to chemotherapy ward in Namazi Hospital, Shiraz, during 19 Dec 2005 - 19 Feb 2006. Reliability was evaluated through the internal consistency of multi-item subscales. Pearson’s correlations of an item with its own scale (corrected for overlap) and other scales were calculated to evaluate convergent and discriminate validity. Clinical validity was evaluated by known-group comparisons using ANOVA and Kruskal Wallis tests. Data were then analyzed with SPSS software. Results: In the reliability analysis, most scales fitted the criteria (Alpha> 0. 70) except the fatigue, pain, nausea and vomiting scales. Convergent validity was evidenced by item own subscale correlation above 0. 40 for all multi-item subscales. Item discriminate validity was successful in all analyses except for item 4 of the physical functioning scale. Results of the known group based analysis show significant differences in QLQ-C 30 functioning and symptom scores, where patients with higher grade have the worst (p< 0. 05).

This is particularly useful when the observed parameter is barely above the background or the histogram of multiparametric data contains many empty bins, so that the <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> the <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> a theory cannot be based on the chi-squared-criterion. In addition to the solutions of practical problems, this approach provides an epistemic insight: the logic of quantum mechanics is obtained as the logic of unbiased inference from counting data. New sections feature factorizing parameters, commuting parameters, observables in quantum mechanics, the art of fitting with coherent and with incoherent alternatives and fitting with multinomial distribution. Additional problems and examples help deepen the knowledge. Requiring no knowledge of quantum mechanics, the book is written on introductory level, with many examples and exercises, for advanced undergraduate and graduate students in the physical sciences, planning to, or working in, fields such as medical physics, nuclear physics, quantum mechanics, and chaos...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} is to develop a measurement tool to assess 21 st Century learning and innovation skills of primary school students. Study data was collected from 632 fourth grade students in five different primary schools during 2014 – 2015 academic year and data obtained from 609 fourth grade students were utilized in the study. The scale was developed in six stages. These were; establishing the scale items, consultation of experts, pretest stage, <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> structural <b>validity,</b> reliability assessment, and finalization of the scale, respectively. Cronbach alpha reliability coefficient for the whole scale, which consisted of three factors, was calculated as 0. 95. 0. 89. As a result of the current study, a Likert-type 21 st Century learning and innovation skills scale with 39 items was developed. 20 items of the scale were related to creativity and innovation skills, 12 were related to critical thinking and problem solving skills, and 7 were related to cooperation and communication skills...|$|R
