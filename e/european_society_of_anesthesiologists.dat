40|$|Target-controlled {{infusion}} (TCI) {{incorporates the}} pharmacokinetic variables of an IV drug to facilitate {{safe and reliable}} administration. In this clinical study we investigated the performance of propofol TCI in combination with remifentanil. Fifty-four adult patients scheduled for general surgery lasting longer than 1 h received a combined TCI of propofol (Marsh parameter set; propofol randomly either dissolved with long- or middle-/long-chain triglycerides) and remifentanil. Arterial propofol plasma concentrations and hemodynamic and derived electroencephalogram variables were determined at various stages before, during, and after surgery. Measured propofol plasma concentrations exceeded the predicted values by 59 %, and 48 % when recalculated with the Schnider parameter set. Pharmacokinetic population analysis showed a small central volume of distribution (3. 55 L) and reduced clearance (1. 31 L/min) for propofol. ASA status and sex were the only variables that had a significant influence on propofol pharmacokinetics. In a second step, a new pharmacokinetic variable set for propofol was determined in the first 27 patients. Post hoc performance analysis of the remaining 27 patients showed improved accuracy using the new variable set. Our results show that when remifentanil and propofol are combined, the Marsh and Schnider parameter sets systematically underestimate propofol plasma concentrations.

30|$|TEE {{initially}} was used reluctantly during OLT {{because of the}} potential for variceal rupture (De Wolf 1999). Per the practice guidelines for perioperative TEE published by the American <b>Society</b> <b>of</b> <b>Anesthesiologists</b> and the <b>Society</b> <b>of</b> Cardiovascular <b>Anesthesiologists</b> Task Force in 2010 (Practice guidelines for perioperative transesophageal echocardiography. An updated report by the American <b>Society</b> <b>of</b> <b>Anesthesiologists</b> and the <b>Society</b> <b>of</b> Cardiovascular <b>Anesthesiologists</b> Task Force on transesophageal echocardiography 2010), esophageal varices are not an absolute contraindication to TEE. The guidelines recommend using TEE in patients with esophageal disease if the expected benefit outweighs the potential risk and appropriate precautions are taken (Practice guidelines for perioperative transesophageal echocardiography. An updated report by the American <b>Society</b> <b>of</b> <b>Anesthesiologists</b> and the <b>Society</b> <b>of</b> Cardiovascular <b>Anesthesiologists</b> Task Force on Transesophageal Echocardiography 2010). Studies have reported that TEE significantly improved the intraoperative management of patients undergoing OLT (Suriani et al. 1996; Rafferty et al. 1993). One study, although not conducted during intraoperative OLT procedures, showed that “TEE without transgastric views can be performed without serious complications in patients with grade I or II esophageal varices who have not experienced recent variceal hemorrhages”(Spier et al. 2009).|$|R
