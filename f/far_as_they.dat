5|$|In this episode, flashbacks reveal why Hurley is {{hesitant}} {{at his new}} job of distributing food {{found in}} the newly discovered Swan station. Meanwhile, a few castaways become worried that the raft sent by them for rescue may have not gone as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> hoped. Jack and Sayid explore the hatch, while Sawyer, Jin, and Michael find out that their captors are from the tail section of the plane..|$|E
5|$|Team Ninja {{kept working}} on the Ninja Gaiden project after its release, {{with the aim of}} pushing the action genre and their first such title as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> could. To this end, they {{released}} downloadable expansions, known as Hurricane Packs, free of charge. Itagaki said that since the packs were born out of his team's interest, they did not care to charge players for their efforts. The two packs were available over Xbox Live {{in the third quarter of}} 2004.|$|E

50|$|Magnum's lawyers {{realised}} {{the mistake}} the following day, and contacted Viko's lawyers to notify {{them of the}} error, offering to immediately refund the cheque, and even go <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> suggest <b>they</b> cancel the cheque.|$|R
5|$|While Strez's murder meant {{an end to}} the Latin–Bulgarian campaign, Stefan did not {{undertake}} a campaign into Macedonia due to the proximity of the coalition troops, which had halted at Niš. In 1217, all of Strez's territory was under the Epirote rule of Theodore Komnenos Doukas, though Boril may have controlled some or all of it in the meantime. The Serbs failed to take advantage of Strez's death as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> did not manage to acquire any of his former domains.|$|E
5|$|Pliny's {{purpose in}} writing the Natural History was to cover all {{learning}} and art so <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> are connected with nature or draw their materials from nature. He says:My subject is a barren one – the world of nature, or in other words life; and that subject in its least elevated department, and employing either rustic terms or foreign, nay barbarian words that actually have to be introduced with an apology. Moreover, the path is not a beaten highway of authorship, nor {{one in which the}} mind is eager to range: there is not one of us who has made the same venture, nor yet one among the Greeks who has tackled single-handed all departments of the subject.|$|E
5|$|The Court of Appeal {{rejected}} {{the application of}} the subjective test in favour of the objective test on the following grounds. Firstly, the Court held that Karam Singh and other cases following it were no longer good law in so <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> applied Liversidge v. Anderson (1941) and Greene v. Secretary of State for Home Affairs (1941), which were World War II cases from the United Kingdom. The House of Lords and the Privy Council had since recognized that the majority judgments in Liversidge and Greene had been wrong, and preferred Lord Atkin's dissenting judgment in Liversidge which advocated the objective approach.|$|E
50|$|Drayton {{would have}} another long season with wins few and <b>far</b> between, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> {{finished}} {{the season with}} a 3-22-1 record, finishing in eighth place in the nine team WOAA North Division.|$|R

I only know that I can't be {{expected}} to take count of them all. You can't expect me to know them, just because {{they happen to be}} there. As <b>far</b> <b>as</b> I go <b>they</b> might <b>as</b> well not be there.' ...|$|R
50|$|Railmotor {{services}} {{began in}} 1905 and several new halts were built. Running from Silverdale <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> Trentham, <b>they</b> {{were intended to}} compete with trams and were somewhat successful in this respect, although they only lasted until 1926.|$|R
25|$|The {{following}} is a chronological list of the abbots as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> are known. It is based on that in Swift's book, and from the Victoria County History.|$|E
25|$|The {{counties}} of Cambridgeshire, Lincolnshire, Northamptonshire, Suffolk, Sussex and Yorkshire were undivided so <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> were one county at {{the passing of}} the Act. The three ridings of Yorkshire and the three parts of Lincolnshire therefore retained their status.|$|E
25|$|Concerning {{the seven}} Councils of the {{undivided}} church, it affirms {{the teaching of}} the first four Ecumenical Councils and the Christological clarifications of the fifth, sixth and seventh councils, in so <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> are agreeable to the Bible.|$|E
50|$|In Japan, {{the species}} {{can be found}} in Hakone, Miyanoshita and <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> Sapporo. <b>They</b> prefer various moss and rotten stumps or trees where they are abundant. The species were also found in the city Hakodate of Hokkaido.|$|R
50|$|When railmotors were {{introduced}} on GWR branches, {{they worked on}} these lines <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> Tavistock. <b>They</b> were replaced later with class 517 type engines fitted for auto-train working. From the 1920s the 45XX and 44XX type were dominant.|$|R
50|$|Although upper-pharyngeal stops are {{not found}} in the world's languages, <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> is known, <b>they</b> occur in disordered speech.|$|R
25|$|Other {{languages}} {{were only}} {{represented in the}} original vocabulary in so <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> were cognate with, or as their words had become widespread in, Esperanto's source languages. However, since that time many languages have contributed words for specialized or regional concepts, such as haŝio (chopsticks) from Japanese and boaco (reindeer) from Saami.|$|E
25|$|Based on {{the fact}} that Category Three {{officials}} represented by both the SRFA and the Scottish Association of Referees (SAR) had not been represented at the strike meeting, the SSFRA informed them on 23 November that as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> were concerned, they were at liberty to choose whether or not they accepted appointments for the weekend.|$|E
25|$|Unfortunately for the Dynamo, {{that would}} be as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> would go. After an uninspired draw at home against Sporting Kansas City, the future champions, the Dynamo would fall 2–1 to Sporting on the return leg in Kansas. However, 2013 would still be {{considered}} another {{in a long line}} of successes for the Dynamo, and the team had their core players all locked into long-term contracts for the future.|$|E

30|$|Second, the Doreans, a mountainous race entered {{from western}} Macedonia, and {{following}} the main mountain range went down <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> Peloponessos. <b>They</b> also converted large areas of forests to grasslands for the same reason, using the most effective tool, burning.|$|R
40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of any {{national}} park service in administering natural areas is to maintain an area’s ecosystems in as nearly pristine a condition as possible. This means that ecological processes, including plant succession and the natural regulation of animal numbers, {{should be permitted to}} proceed <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> possible <b>as</b> <b>they</b> did under pristine conditions, and that modern man must be restricted to generally non-consumptive uses of these areas (Houston 1971). </p...|$|R
25|$|Miike has {{garnered}} international notoriety for depicting shocking {{scenes of}} extreme violence and sexual perversions. Many {{of his films}} contain graphic and lurid bloodshed, often portrayed in an over-the-top, cartoonish manner. Much of his work depicts the activities of criminals (especially yakuza) or concern themselves with gaijin, non-Japanese or foreigners living in Japan. He {{is known for his}} dark sense of humor and for pushing the boundaries of censorship as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> will go.|$|E
25|$|The {{research}} Ricketts did on sardines was {{a seminal}} application of ecology to fisheries science, {{but it was}} not published as an academic paper. He is not widely recognized by fisheries scientists. The prominent fisheries scientist Daniel Pauly comments: “That’s probably {{due to the fact that}} his stuff isn’t widely available... This is strange, but fisheries scientists so <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> are trained do extraordinarily little ecology... I will not publish a paper on pelagics without now mentioning Ricketts”.|$|E
25|$|In fact, no {{decision}} on an approach (much less multiple approaches) had been made. Federal officials said on September 7, 1931, {{that there were}} no Arlington County approaches, and as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> could ascertain none would be open in 1932, either. A road from the bridge south down Columbia Island and a bridge over the Boundary Channel to connect with the Mount Vernon Memorial Parkway would open in late 1931 or early 1932, they said. But that was the only work foreseen.|$|E
50|$|Adult glasswings can {{be found}} mostly from Central to South America <b>as</b> <b>far</b> south <b>as</b> Chile. <b>They</b> can migrate great {{distances}} and have been documented <b>as</b> <b>far</b> north <b>as</b> Mexico and Texas.|$|R
50|$|Madhava (Madhavan) is a doctor, and {{a single}} {{appearance}} as hero in a film has made him the heartthrob of thousands of girls. He marries Simi (Simran), but a revelation about his past separates them and takes them <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> divorce. <b>They</b> remain friends though, even going so <b>far</b> <b>as</b> to fix up each other's second marriages.|$|R
50|$|The Erythrinidae are {{a family}} of fishes found in rivers and other {{freshwater}} habitats from Costa Rica south <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> Argentina. <b>They</b> are common and are caught with hooks by fishermen, partially because of their voracious behaviour. They are sometimes called trahiras or tarariras.|$|R
25|$|Northamptonshire Steelbacks {{took their}} second victory from two Twenty20 Cup matches thus <b>far,</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> {{accumulated}} 143 for 5 in 14 overs, despite no batsman hitting more than 40 in a rain-shortened match at Northampton. Scotsman Dougie Brown took one for nine off three overs for Warwickshire Bears, but {{the target was}} too large for the visitors, as Northamptonshire bowler Ben Phillips removed four Warwickshire lower-order batsmen - his second four-wicket-haul in three days - as the Bears crumbled to 105 for 9.|$|E
25|$|The Director of the Serious Fraud Office {{has decided}} to {{discontinue}} {{the investigation into the}} affairs of BAE Systems plc as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> relate to the Al Yamamah defence contract. This decision has been taken following representations that have been made both to the Attorney General and the Director concerning the need to safeguard national and international security. It has been necessary to balance the need to maintain the rule of law against the wider public interest. No weight has been given to commercial interests or to the national economic interest.|$|E
25|$|Of {{the ships}} departing on December 8, 32 Acadian {{families}} (225 prisoners) {{on board the}} British ship Pembroke, bound for North Carolina, seized control of the vessel. On February 8, 1756, the Acadians had sailed up the Saint John River as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> could. The Acadians disembarked and burned their ship. A group of Maliseet met them and directed them upstream, where they joined an expanding Acadian community. The Maliseet took them to one of Charles Deschamps de Boishébert et de Raffetot's refugee camps for the fleeing Acadians, which was at Beaubears Island.|$|E

50|$|In 376 BC, a large band of Triballi under King Hales crossed Mount Haemus and {{advanced}} <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> Abdera; <b>they</b> had backing from Maroneia and {{were preparing to}} besiege the city when Chabrias appeared off the coast, with the Athenian fleet, and organized a reconciliation.|$|R
