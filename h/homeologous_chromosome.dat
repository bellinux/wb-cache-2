50|$|Allopolyploids are species whose {{increased}} {{complement of}} genetic material {{is the result}} of hybridization of two closely related species. Thus homeologous chromosomes in allopolyploids are equivalent, but not identical. These differences mean that the precise pattern of silencing and expression can have important phenotypic effects. Reciprocal silencing on the population level refers to the case where two populations are each descended from the same allopolyploid. In one population, one of the two equivalent locci (A) is expressed while the other (B) has been silenced, while in the other population the reciprocal pattern occurs, with B being expressed and A silenced. It {{is important to note that}} this refers to equivalent loci, specific locations within the genome, rather than the entire <b>homeologous</b> <b>chromosome.</b>|$|E

In oilseed rape haploids, <b>homeologous</b> <b>chromosome</b> pairing at metaphase I was found to be genetically based and controlled by a major gene, PrBn, segregating in a background of polygenic variation.

We have identified three to six minor QTL/BTL that have slight additive effects on the amount of pairing at metaphase I but do not interact with PrBn.

Of thirty-one pairings between species, only five were successful, producing eleven newborns. Like parents, hybrids had 38 metacentric chromosomes, except for the subtelocentric Y chromosome inherited from P. mugisteu. There was almost total C and G band correspondence between homeologous autosomes. However, parental sex chromosomes had different morphology, C and G bands. Ag-NOR bands appeared as small telomeric Ag+ regions, distributed in four chromosomal pairs of durwini, three of mugister and four <b>homeologous</b> <b>chromosomes</b> of the hybrids. The three forms had similar indexes of NOR activity per cell, {{in spite of the}} variability in NOR expression which was always detected. Usually, only one member of parental homologous chromosomes showed AgNOR +; nevertheless, both <b>homeologous</b> <b>chromosomes</b> were active in many hybrid cells. The frequencies of cells that expressed their ribosomal genes in the two homologous or <b>homeologous</b> NOR <b>chromosomes</b> were similar in parental and hybrid cells. These results strongly suggest that ribosomal genes of both parental genomes would function codominantly in the hybrids. The gonad histological and morphometric analyses showed that hybrids conformed to Haldane's rule, since females were fertile and males were infertile. Our results indicate that P. durwini and P. mugister genomes can function in relative harmony and compatibility when they are placed together in their laboratory generated hybrids, suggesting that these species have few genetic differences, probably because they have recently diverged...|$|R

40|$|Homosporous ferns are {{generally}} considered polyploid {{due to high}} chromosome numbers, but genetically diploid since the expression of isozymes is generally controlled by a single locus. Gene silencing over evolutionary time is one means by which this apparent contradiction can be explained. A prediction of this hypothesis is that silenced gene sequences still reside in the genomes of homosporous ferns. We examined the genomes of Ceratopteris richardii and C. thalictroides for sequences which are similar to expressed gene sequences. Genomic DNA blots hybridized with C. richardii cDNA clones showed {{that the majority of}} these clones detected multiple fragments, suggesting that most gene-like sequences are duplicated in Ceratopteris. Hybridization signal intensity often varied between fragments of the same size between accessions, sometimes dramatically, which indicates that not all sequences are equivalent, and may represent the products of silenced genes.

40|$|Allopolyploids form {{through the}} {{hybridization}} {{of two or}} more diploid genomes. A challenge to reproduction in allopolyploids is that pairing can occur between homologous <b>chromosomes</b> or <b>homeologous</b> <b>chromosomes</b> (i. e. different subgenomes.). Crossover between <b>homeologous</b> <b>chromosomes</b> can result in chromosome rearrangements that lower fertility and overall fitness. Rearrangements can alter the dosage of either entire chromosomes or just parts of chromosomes. Understanding the frequency and extent of rearrangements will help to explain the evolution and genome stabilization of agriculturally important allopolyploid species. Pyrosequencing is a useful tool in the study dosage changes in allopolyploids because it allows quantification of the relative contribution from each progenitor species at any given locus. Here we use pyrosequencing to analyze resynthesized Brassica napus allopolyploids and their progeny. Targets for pyrosequencing were identified using a bioinformatic approach taking advantage of recently-released Brassica genome sequence. SNPs identified through bioinformatics were confirmed through molecular biology. Markers along the A 3 /C 3 homeolog pair were used to identify the occurrence of novel homeologous exchanges during meiosis in the parent plant, and segregation patterns arising from dosage changes in the parent. We identify a higher frequency of homeologous rearrangements at the distal end of the chromosomes. We also observe that the presence of a dosage change in a parent increases the likelihood that the chromosome bearing the dosage change will undergo subsequent rearrangements in neighboring loci...|$|R

These strains exhibit physiological properties of potential biotechnological interest. A preliminary characterization of these hybrids showed a trend to reduce the S. kudriavzevii fraction of the hybrid genome. We characterized the genomic constitution of several wine S. cerevisiae × S. kudriavzevii strains by using a combined approach based on the restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of gene regions, comparative genome hybridizations with S. cerevisiae DNA arrays, ploidy analysis, and gene dose determination by quantitative real-time PCR. The high similarity in the genome structures of the S. cerevisiae × S. kudriavzevii hybrids under study indicates that they originated from a single hybridization event. After hybridization, the hybrid genome underwent extensive chromosomal rearrangements, including chromosome losses and the generation of chimeric chromosomes by the nonreciprocal recombination between <b>homeologous</b> <b>chromosomes.</b> These nonreciprocal recombinations between <b>homeologous</b> <b>chromosomes</b> occurred in highly conserved regions, such as Ty long terminal repeats (LTRs), rRNA regions, and conserved protein-coding genes.

Whether this loss proceeds gene by gene or through deletion of multi-gene DNA segments is controversial, as {{is the question of}} fractionation bias, namely whether one <b>homeologous</b> <b>chromosome</b> is more vulnerable to gene deletion than the other. Results As a null hypothesis, we first assume deletion events, on either homeolog, excise a geometrically distributed number of genes with unknown mean μ, and a number r of these events overlap to produce deleted runs of length l. There is a fractionation bias 0 ≤ ϕ ≤ 1 for deletions to fall on one homeolog rather than the other. The parameter r is a random variable with distribution π (·). We simulate the distribution of run lengths l, as well as the underlying π (·), as a function of μ, ϕ and θ, the proportion of remaining genes in duplicate form. We show how sampling l allows us to estimate μ and ϕ. The main part of this work is the derivation of a deterministic recurrence to calculate each π (r) as a function of μ, ϕ and θ. Conclusions The recurrence for π provides a deeper mathematical understanding of fractionation process than simulations. The parameters μ and ϕ can be estimated based on run lengths of single-copy regions. </p...|$|E

To understand how S. demissum germplasm is incorporated to S. tuberosum through backcrosses, a linkage analysis of 590 DNA markers from S. demissum-specific simplex alleles was performed in an aneuploid population of 87 BC 1 plants. Five hundred eighty-one markers were mapped to 38 linkage groups, of which 37 were assigned to potato chromosomes using markers of known location. Three homoeologous chromosomes were distinguished for each of the 12 potato chromosomes. Approximately 50 % of the markers were transmitted to the BC 1 progeny except for chromosomes 2 c, 3 b and 6 c, which were significantly under-represented. Two of the three <b>homeologous</b> <b>chromosomes</b> in at least nine of the chromosomes were transmitted to the BC 1 progeny with negative correlations, which demonstrated that the two <b>homeologous</b> <b>chromosomes</b> paired at meiosis in the F- 1 parent then separated into different gametes.

However, {{a recent study}} pointed out the occurrence of recombination between <b>homeologous</b> <b>chromosomes,</b> especially when synthetic allotetraploids are used, challenging the view of disomic inheritance in peanut. In this study, we investigated the meiotic behavior of allotetraploid peanut using 380 SSR markers and 90 F 2 progeny derived from the cross between Arachis hypogaea cv Fleur 11 (AABB) and ISATGR 278 - 18 (AAKK), a synthetic allotetraploid that harbors a K-genome that was reported to pair with the cultivated B-genome during meiosis. Segregation analysis of SSR markers showed 42 codominant SSRs with unexpected null bands among some progeny. Chi-square tests for these loci deviate from the expected 1 : 2 : 1 Mendelian ratio under disomic inheritance. A linkage map of 357 codominant loci aligned on 20 linkage groups (LGs) with a total length of 1728 cM, averaging 5. 1 cM between markers, was developed. Among the 10 homeologous sets of LGs, one set consisted of markers that all segregated in a polysomic-like pattern, six in a likely disomic pattern and the three remaining in a mixed pattern with disomic and polysomic loci clustered on the same LG.

Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 111 (6), 2182 - 2187 The Arabidopsis cyclin-dependent kinase G (CDKG) gene defines a clade of cyclin-dependent protein kinases related to CDK 10 and CDK 11, {{as well as to}} the enigmatic Ph 1 -related kinases that are implicated in controlling <b>homeologous</b> <b>chromosome</b> pairing in wheat. Here we demonstrate that the CDKG 1 /CYCLINL complex {{is essential for}} synapsis and recombination during male meiosis. A transfer-DNA insertional mutation in the cdkg 1 gene leads to a temperature-sensitive failure of meiosis in late Zygotene/Pachytene that is associated with defective formation of the synaptonemal complex, reduced bivalent formation and crossing over, and aneuploid gametes. An aphenotypic insertion in the cyclin L gene, a cognate cyclin for CDKG, strongly enhances the phenotype of cdkg 1 - 1 mutants, indicating that this cdk-cyclin complex is essential for male meiosis.

Pairing and behavior at meiosis I of the Het share features with both Y and B chromosomes and suggest that the Del arose from a translocation event or homeologous recombination between a B. holboellii (or related taxon) and a B. stricta chromosome. Based on its presence exclusively in apomictic accessions, we propose that the Het chromosome plays a role in the genetic control of apomixis...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Paralog reduction, {{the loss}} of {{duplicate}} genes after whole genome duplication (WGD) is a pervasive process. Whether this loss proceeds gene by gene or through deletion of multi-gene DNA segments is controversial, as {{is the question of}} fractionation bias, namely whether one <b>homeologous</b> <b>chromosome</b> is more vulnerable to gene deletion than the other. Results As a null hypothesis, we first assume deletion events, on one homeolog only, excise a geometrically distributed number of genes with unknown mean µ, and these events combine to produce deleted runs of length l, distributed approximately as a negative binomial with unknown parameter r, itself a random variable with distribution π (·). A more realistic model requires deletion events on both homeologs distributed as a truncated geometric. We simulate the distribution of run lengths l in both models, as well as the underlying π (r), as a function of µ, and show how sampling l allows us to estimate µ. We apply this to data on a total of 15 genomes descended from 6 distinct WGD events and show how to correct the bias towards shorter runs caused by genome rearrangements. Because of the difficulty in deriving π (·) analytically, we develop a deterministic recurrence to calculate each π (r) as a function of µ and the proportion of unreduced paralog pairs. Conclusions The parameter µ can be estimated based on run lengths of single-copy regions. Estimates of µ in real data do not exclude the possibility that duplicate gene deletion is largely gene by gene, although it may sometimes involve longer segments. </p...|$|E
40|$|We {{incorporated}} 69 microsatellite loci into {{an existing}} data set of 132 markers {{to test for}} quantitative trait loci (QTLs) affecting spawning date and body weight in a backcross between two outbred strains of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Twenty-six linkage groups were identified and synteny of duplicated microsatellite markers was used to confirm 13 <b>homeologous</b> <b>chromosome</b> pairs. Gene-centromere data were used to localize the centromeres for 13 linkage groups whose orientations were previously unknown. We applied a combination of interval mapping and single marker analysis to the segregating maternal and paternal alleles at 201 microsatellite loci. Four spawning date QTLs with suggestive evidence for an additional two QTLs were detected in female trout spawning at 3 and 4 years of age. Similarly we detected three QTLs for body weight in females at 2 years of age plus four suggestive QTLs for this trait. We found marginal evidence that three pairs of ancestral homeologues contained detectable QTLs for the same trait. In {{one of the three}} pairs of homeologues, the duplicated QTL regions mapped to the same relative chromosomal location, while the exact localization of the QTL position in one of the other pairs was difficult to infer since it was based on data from a male-derived map. The existing data were unable to refute a hypothesis that duplicated functional genes will be maintained within the telomeric regions of salmonids due to preferential male-mediated crossing over in this region. Two of the four spawning date QTLs were detected on linkage groups with unknown homeologous relationships. QTLs with possible pleiotropic effects on bot...|$|E
5000|$|Embryonic {{mortality}} in parthenogenic amphibians is high. Hatching rates for North American salamander species {{have ranged from}} 19.5% [...] to 30.5%. It is speculated that intergenomic exchanges, like crossing over during meiosis, may play a role. Intergenomic exchanges are often lethal {{due to the fact}} that chromosomes in unisexual species are <b>homeologous.</b> Homologous <b>chromosomes</b> are largely identical, in this case as a result of the chromosome replication.|$|R
40|$|A {{defining}} {{character of}} the piscine family Salmonidae is autotetraploidy resulting from a genome-doubling event some 25 - 100 million years ago. Initially, duplicated genes may have undergone concerted evolution and tetrasomic inheritance. <b>Homeologous</b> <b>chromosomes</b> eventually diverged and the resulting reduction in recombination and gene conversion between paralogous genes allowed the re-establishment of disomic inheritance. Among extant salmonine fishes (e. g. salmon, trout, char) the growth hormone (GH) gene is generally represented by two functional paralogs, GH 1 and GH 2. Sequence analyses of salmonid GH genes from species of subfamilies Coregoninae (whitefish, ciscos) and Salmoninae were {{used to examine the}} evolutionary history of the duplicated GH genes. Two divergent GH gene paralogs were also identified in Coregoninae, but they were not assignable to the GH 1 and GH 2 categories. The average sequence divergence between the coregonine GH genes was more than twofold lower than the corresponding divergence between the salmonine GH 1 and GH 2. Phylogenetic analysis of the coregonine GH paralogs did not resolve their relationship to the salmonine paralogs. These findings suggest that disomic inheritance of two GH genes was established by different mechanisms in these two subfamilies...|$|R
40|$|A {{reciprocal}} chromosomal transposition {{was identified}} in several annual oilseed Brassica napus genotypes used as parents in crosses to biennial genotypes for genetic mapping studies. The transposition involved {{an exchange of}} interstitial homeologous regions on linkage groups N 7 and N 16, and its detection {{was made possible by}} the use of segregating populations of doubled haploid lines and codominant RFLP markers. RFLP probes detected pairs of homeologous loci on N 7 and N 16 for which the annual and biennial parents had identical alleles in regions expected to be homeologous. The existence of an interstitial reciprocal transposition was confirmed by cytological analysis of synaptonemal complexes of annual x biennial F 1 hybrids. Although it included approximately one-third of the physical length of the N 7 and N 16 chromosomes, few recombination events within the region were recovered in the progenies of the hybrids. Significantly higher seed yields were associated with the parental configurations of the rearrangement in segregating progenies. These progenies contained complete complements of <b>homeologous</b> <b>chromosomes</b> from the diploid progenitors of B. napus, and thus their higher seed yields provide evidence for the selective advantage of allopolyploidy through the fixation of intergenomic heterozygosity...|$|R
