50|$|Ventilation System: A {{system of}} local and/or general exhaust is {{recommended}} to keep employee exposures {{as low as}} possible. Local exhaust ventilation is generally preferred because it can control the emissions of the contaminant at its source, preventing dispersion of it into the general work area. Please refer to the ACGIH document, <b>Industrial</b> <b>Ventilation,</b> A Manual of Recommended Practices, most recent edition, for details. Personal Respirators (NIOSH Approved): For conditions of use where exposure to dust or mist is apparent and engineering controls are not feasible, a particulate respirator (NIOSH type N95 or better filters) may be worn. If oil particles (e.g. lubricants, cutting fluids, glycerine, etc.) are present, use a NIOSH type R or P filter. For emergencies or instances where the exposure levels are not known, use a full-face positive-pressure, air-supplied respirator.Skin Protection: Not required.Eye Protection: Not required. Optionally use chemical safety goggles where dusting or splashing of solutions is possible.|$|E

40|$|Our novel concept {{utilizing}} continuous {{emission of}} unipolar ions, {{which has been}} recently proven to enhance the efficiency of facepiece respirators, was applied to conventional HVAC filters. Laboratory study demonstrated that the air ion emission {{in the vicinity of}} a low-efficiency HVAC filter significantly improves its performance. For example, the collection efficiency of two commercial HVAC filters challenged with 1 孠PSL particles jumped from 5 - 15 % (measured with no ion emission) to 40 - 90 % (when the ion output rate was ~ 1012 e-/sec). The enhancement effect depends on the filter type and, generally, on the distance from the ion emitter to the filter surface. The results were explained as follows. The air ions with high mobility are deposited on the fibers forming a macroscopic electric field, which shield out some incoming unipolarly charged particles due to repelling forces. The field estimate has shown that this explanation is feasible.

40|$|This thesis {{considers}} {{the development of}} a Hammerstein-bilinear approach to non-linear systems modelling, analysis and control systems design, which builds on and extends the applicability of an existing bilinear approach. The underlying idea of the Hammerstein-bilinear approach is to use the Hammerstein-bilinear system models to capture various physical phenomena of interest and subsequently use these for model based control system designs with the premise being that of achieving enhanced control performance. The advantage of the Hammerstein-bilinear approach is that the well-structured system models allow techniques that have been originally developed for linear systems to be extended and applied, while retaining moderate complexity of the corresponding system identification schemes and nonlinear model based control designs. In recognition of the {{need to be able to}} identify the Hammerstein-bilinear models a unified suite of algorithms, being the extensions to the simplified refined instrumental variable method for parameter estimation of linear transfer function models is proposed. These algorithms are able to operate in both the continuous-time and discrete-time domains to reflect the requirements of the intended purposes of the identified models with the emphasis being placed on straightforward applicability of the developed algorithms and recognising the need to be able to operate under realistic practical system identification scenarios. Moreover, the proposed algorithms are also applicable to parameter estimation of Hammerstein and bilinear models, which are special cases of the wider Hammerstein-bilinear model class. The Hammerstein-bilinear approach has been applied to an <b>industrial</b> heating, <b>ventilation</b> and air conditioning (HVAC) system, which has also been the underlying application addressed in this thesis. A unique set of dynamic control design purpose oriented air temperature and humidity Hammerstein-bilinear models of an environmentally controlled clear room manufacturing zone has been identified.
