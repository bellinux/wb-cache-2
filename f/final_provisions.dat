40|$|This essay {{analyses}} {{the recent}} {{amendment to the}} Fair Trading Act 1986 that created a prohibition of “unsubstantiated representations” in trade.

This essay traces the prohibition through the wider consumer law reform process to investigate how the <b>final</b> <b>provision</b> was arrived at. By critically analysing the process {{that led to the}} amendments, the essay suggests that the decision to create a prohibition was based on flawed reasoning. In particular, it is argued that New Zealand should have followed the Australian approach, and that creating a prohibition has instead produced unnecessary liability in the absence of sufficient justification...|$|R

The Cuban government had taken power and the U.S. withdrawn its forces as of May 20, 1902.
