Vachon {{explained}} that the GrandMA console was [...] "the desk {{you can do the}} most with LEDs; <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> further, you need a media serverCTB." [...] The assistant lighting designer used a full-sized GrandMA console. Two NSPs provided the necessary extra channels. The show's color palette was somewhat restricted. There was mostly white lights, but Upton used lighter colors to get the most light output. The original palette was also based on colors like amber, steel blue, sea green, and orange. Late in the tour Vachon would add additional bursts of color, which included intense oranges, reds, and violets.|$|E

[...] He compared his experience on Voyager to working in a car factory, and said that the repetitive scenes meant that it limited his creativity.

500|$|During World War I, Prokofiev {{returned}} to the Conservatory and studied the [...] organ to avoid conscription. He composed The Gambler based on Fyodor Dostoyevsky's novel of the same name, but rehearsals were plagued by problems, and the scheduled 1917 première had to be cancelled because of the February Revolution. In the summer of that year, Prokofiev composed his first symphony, the Classical. It was his own name for the symphony, which {{was written in the}} style that, according to Prokofiev, Joseph Haydn would have used if he had been alive at the time. It is more or less Classical in style but incorporates more modern musical elements (see Neoclassicism). The symphony was also an exact contemporary of Prokofiev's Violin Concerto No. 1 in D major, Op. 19, which was scheduled to premiere in November 1917. The first performances of both works had to wait until 21 April 1918 and 18 October 1923, respectively. He stayed briefly with his mother in Kislovodsk in the Caucasus. After completing the score of Seven, They Are Seven, a [...] "Chaldean invocation" [...] for chorus and orchestra, Prokofiev was [...] "left with nothing to do and time hung heavily on my hands". Believing that Russia [...] "had no use for music at the moment", Prokofiev decided to try his fortunes in America until the turmoil in his homeland had passed. He set out for Moscow and Petersburg in March 1918 to sort out financial matters and to arrange for his passport. In May he headed for the US, having obtained official permission to do so from Anatoly Lunacharsky, the People's Commissar for Education, who told him: [...] "You are a revolutionary in music, we are revolutionaries in life. We ought to work together. But <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to America I shall not stand in your way." ...|$|E

It became a bestseller. In March 2003, <b>If</b> <b>You</b> <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> Walk on Water was the third-best-selling religious book in Britain and the fourth-best-selling religious book in Scotland. In his book God Can't Sleep: Waiting for Daylight On Life's Dark Nights, Palmer Chinchen writes that <b>If</b> <b>You</b> <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> Walk on Water is an [...] "excellent book on faith". Religion News Service journalist Jonathan Merritt called the book a modern classic book.
