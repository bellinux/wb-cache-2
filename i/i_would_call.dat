Drake has been described as [...] "dreamy", and a [...] "handsome, charismatic hero." [...] Claudia Black, voice of Chloe Frazer from , admitted having a crush on Drake as well. Drake has been cited {{as an example of a}} male character who, while attractive, is not over-masculine. One commentator pointed out: [...] "Very few of our protagonists (Nathan Drake and Alan Wake to name a few exceptions) depict men in what <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>call</b> a non-degrading manner." [...] Steve McGarvey of GameSpy wrote that Drake was: [...] "hardly oozing with machismo compared to the likes of most gaming protagonists". Drake's attractiveness drew criticism from Meagan Marie of Game Informer, who stated that he did not: [...] "stand out much among the crowd of other ideally proportioned and intentionally unblemished gaming icons." [...] GameDaily named Drake the third greatest gaming hunk. GamesRadar named Drake [...] "Mister 2007", stating that he was not picked just because they could [...] "stare at his ass for hours on end", but because he is heroic and has a [...] "winning attitude".

500|$|Part of the New Hollywood film-making wave, Kubrick's {{films are}} {{considered}} by film historian Michel Ciment to be [...] "among {{the most important}} contributions to world cinema in the twentieth century", and he is frequently cited {{as one of the}} greatest and most influential directors in the history of cinema. [...] Leading directors, including Martin Scorsese, Steven Spielberg, Wes Anderson, George Lucas, James Cameron, Woody Allen, Terry Gilliam, the Coen brothers, Ridley Scott, and George A. Romero, [...] have cited Kubrick as a source of inspiration, and in the case of Spielberg, collaboration. On the DVD of Eyes Wide Shut, Steven Spielberg comments that the way Kubrick [...] "tells a story is antithetical to the way we are accustomed to receiving stories" [...] and that [...] "nobody could shoot a picture better in history". Writing in the introduction to a recent edition of Michel Ciment's Kubrick, film director Martin Scorsese notes that most of Kubrick's films were misunderstood when first released, and came to be regarded as masterpieces only in the years after their releases. Orson Welles, one of Kubrick's greatest personal influences and all-time favorite directors, said that: [...] "Among those whom <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>call</b> 'younger generation', Kubrick appears to me to be a giant." ...|$|E
500|$|Hillenburg {{made his}} first {{animated}} works, short films The Green Beret and Wormholes (both 1992), while at CalArts. The Green Beret was about a physically-challenged Girl Scout with enormous fists who toppled houses and destroyed neighborhoods while trying to sell Girl Scout cookies. Wormholes, on the other hand, was his seven-minute thesis film, about the theory of relativity. He described it as [...] "a poetic animated film based on relativistic phenomena", in his grant proposal in 1991 to the Princess Grace Foundation, which assists emerging artists in American theater, dance, and film. The foundation agreed to fund the effort, providing Hillenburg with a Graduate Film Scholarship. [...] "It meant a lot. They funded one of the projects I'm most proud of, even with SpongeBob. It provided me the opportunity just {{to make a film}} that was personal, and what <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>call</b> independent, and free of some of the commercial needs," [...] he said in 2003. Wormholes was shown at several international animation festivals, including the Annecy International Animated Film Festival, the Hiroshima International Animation Festival, the Los Angeles International Animation Celebration, the International Short Film Festival Oberhausen, and the Ottawa International Animation Festival, where it won Best Concept. LA Weekly labeled the film [...] "road-trippy" [...] and [...] "Zap-comical", while Manohla Dargis of The New York Times opined that it was inventive.|$|E

500|$|When {{asked what}} sets Gravity {{apart from his}} {{previous}} releases, Lecrae stated that [...] "Obviously, there's more risk involved in terms of just making more mature music that's not as straight [...] explicit. it's dealing with bigger issues. People may have to think a little bit more. The production is a lot bigger and more advanced than it's been. Lyrically, as an artist, I think I've written {{some of the best}} lyrics I've ever written." [...] Lecrae provided insight into the album's concept during an interview with Family Christian, stating that [...] "Gravity is loosely based on Ecclesiastes and I think what Solomon was trying to do was bring some weight to life and that’s really what I want to do, to paint some sober pictures." [...] He described that [...] "there’s a sober picture of how it’s only {{for a short period of}} time, it’s short-lived, or that we still have Jesus. So that’s what <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>call</b> a weighty part, a gravitational pull to remind us of who we are in Jesus." [...] Billboard stated that Lecrae increased his level of production for Gravity and [...] "mixed reggae and soul influences with his signature brash sound." [...] AllHipHop described the album as opening with [...] "an influx of instruments like violin, drums, guitars". [...] "I Know" [...] was described as having one of the hardest beats on the album, while [...] "Mayday" [...] was considered one of the most [...] "organic" [...] sounding tracks. [...] "Violence" [...] was considered one of the most energetic tracks, and was described as [...] "caribbean-esque" [...] with a dancehall vibe. After the music video for [...] "Lord Have Mercy" [...] was released, an article in The Christian Post article compared the song to the Kanye West single [...] "Mercy", both in its title and musical style. The article elaborated that [...] "like Kanye West's song, [...] "'Lord Have Mercy' features slowed down sampled vocals for its chorus along with heavy bass and an overall dark tone." [...] It noted the appearance of No Malice in the video, stating that [...] "the chorus seems to sample his voice." ...|$|E

2500|$|Author Michael Zager {{wrote that}} Pet Sounds resembles Spector's {{productions}} {{more than it}} does Rubber Soul, and that it recycles many of Spector's Wall of Sound production watermarks. Wilson talked of Spector's influence on his work, having learned how to produce records through attending his sessions, and in a 1988 interview, Wilson asserted that the album aspired to [...] "extend" [...] Spector's music, that [...] "in one sense of the word, we [...] were his messengers." [...] In Pet Sounds, Wilson sought to emulate Spector's Wall of Sound, driven by his fascination with [...] "combining one [...] to make another... It's amazing". Shortly before the album's release, Wilson spoke of recent popular music trends, saying [...] " [...] helped the Beach Boys evolve. We listen to what's happening and it affects what we do too. The trends have influenced my work, but so has my own scene." [...] In 1996, Wilson said of his partnership with Asher: [...] "none of us looked back... We went forward, kind of like on our own little wavelength. It wasn't like we were thinking, 'Okay, let's beat Spector,' let's out-do Motown.' It was more what <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>call</b> exclusive collaboration not to specifically try to kick somebody's butt, but just {{to do it the}} way you really want it to be.

2500|$|The song [...] "Wu-Gambinos" [...] {{was one of}} {{the first}} songs {{recorded}} for the album, and marked the beginning of the Gambino aliases used for the members who appeared on the album, and would eventually become highly influential on hip hop. Raekwon later explained [...] "The Wu-Gambinos aliases come from how I used to like that movie Once Upon a Time in America, with Robert De Niro and James Woods. I liked how these young little niggas grew up, from the ground up, not having nothing to start. And the names came. You know, [...] "Tony Starks" [...] came from Iron Man. [...] "Lou Diamond" [...] came from Louis Roederer who made Cristal, and from me being infatuated with the diamond world. Back then I was wearing a lot of ice, was calling shit ice.

2500|$|Although a 2005 court {{settlement}} gave Nestlé {{the right to}} pump 250 gallons per minute (GPM) from a well in unincorporated Osceola Township, Osceola County, Michigan, Nestlé has tried to increase that rate to 400 GPM. Its bottled water is sold under the Ice Mountain Spring label. The local planning commission denied the application to build a booster station to increase {{the capacity of the}} pipeline that delivers water to a water truck depot some distance from the town. Local citizens mounted considerable grassroots opposition to the plan, with 55 opponents testifying against the proposal at a meeting attended by almost 500 people in July, 2017. The litigation has been costly to the small town, which receives its only compensation from a $200 annual pumping fee. Regarding the 1976 Michigan Safe Drinking Water Act, section 17, a measure precipitated by Nestlé's previous demands, Bill Cobbs, a current Democratic gubernatorial candidate said, [...] "This is wrong -- when this act was written in 1976 it was never intentioned that water would be up for sale." [...] The [...] "David vs. Goliath" [...] situation is drawing increasing national attention. Nestlé approaches water purely as a commodity. In 1994 Helmut Maucher, Nestlé's CEO commented, “Springs are like petroleum. You can always build a chocolate factory. But springs you have or you don’t have.” His successor, Peter Brabeck-Letmathe, was criticized when, in a 2005 documentary, he similarly promoted and rationalized the commodification of water, saying: “One perspective held by various NGOs—which <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>call</b> extreme—is that water should be declared a human right.|$|E
2500|$|Considerable media {{attention}} {{was paid to}} the ideology and pathology of Zehaf-Bibeau. Along with Martin Couture-Rouleau and Justin Bourque, he has been labelled a [...] "lone-wolf terrorist". Couture-Rouleau and Zehaf-Bibeau were [...] "both self-radicalized and adrift in their lives and connected in their sympathy to radical Islamic ideology." [...] Other opinions diverged from simply calling Zehaf-Bibeau a terrorist. Vancouver Sun columnist Ian Mulgrew commented on how the incident, as well as a failed bombing attempt in Victoria by persons motivated similarly to Zehaf-Bibeau, showed 'gaping holes' in the social security net. [...] "These incidents are examples not of Muslim extremism but of the lack of community support for the dysfunctional of any faith who, with a lack of proper attention or the wrong catalyst, become dangerous. I know which approach would make me feel safer, what <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>call</b> real security measures: a social safety net that caught those in obvious need before they went postal, people like Zehaf-Bibeau." [...] Green Party leader Elizabeth May said in the House of Commons: [...] "I would put money on these being the acts of isolated, disturbed and deeply troubled men who were drawn to something crazy. I do not believe that it was a vast network, or that the country is more at risk today than it was last week. However, that is my opinion. I can be wrong...I am undoubtedly going to be wrong again, but what I would like to suggest is that we wait for answers from the police before we make assumptions, and that we speak calmly, truthfully and openly to all Canadians." ...|$|E
2500|$|Shortly before Rodriguez, the Supreme Court {{had held}} in another {{arbitration}} case, Volt Information Sciences, Inc. v. Board of Trustees of Leland Stanford Junior University, that parties could, in their contracts, deviate from {{the terms of}} the FAA. They could specify when and where the arbitration could take place, and who could do it. Some lawyers, mindful of the unsettled debate over manifest disregard, began drafting contracts whose arbitration clauses provided for a more clearly defined standard of judicial review. That raised the question of whether parties could require more of judges than the FAA did. In 1995 the Fifth Circuit decided that the Supreme Court's pro-arbitration decisions from Moses Cone onwards required that they enforce the contract as written in Gateway Technologies, Inc. v. MCI Telecommunications Corp. Two years later the Ninth Circuit followed suit in LaPine Technology Corp. v. Kyocera Corp., where Judge Ferdinand Fernandez writing for the panel that [...] "the FAA is not an [...] designed to avert overburdened court dockets; it is designed to avert interference with the contractual rights of the parties."
