5|$|After the war, Szilard {{switched}} to biology. He invented the chemostat, discovered <b>feedback</b> <b>inhibition,</b> and {{was involved in}} the first cloning of a human cell. He publicly sounded the alarm against the possible development of salted thermonuclear bombs, a new kind of nuclear weapon that might annihilate mankind. Diagnosed with bladder cancer in 1960, he underwent treatment using a cobalt-60 treatment that he had designed. He helped found the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, where he became a resident fellow. Szilard founded Council for a Livable World in 1962 to deliver “the sweet voice of reason” about nuclear weapons to Congress, the White House, and the American public. He died in his sleep {{of a heart attack in}} 1964.|$|E
5|$|In 1946, Szilard {{secured a}} {{research}} professorship at the University of Chicago {{that allowed him}} to dabble in biology and the social sciences. He teamed up with Aaron Novick, a chemist who had worked at the Metallurgical Laboratory during the war. The two men saw biology as a field that had not been explored as much as physics, and was ready for scientific breakthroughs. It was a field that Szilard had been working on in 1933 before he had become subsumed in the quest for a nuclear chain reaction. The duo made considerable advances. They invented the chemostat, a device for regulating the growth rate of the microorganisms in a bioreactor, and developed methods for measuring the growth rate of bacteria. They discovered <b>feedback</b> <b>inhibition,</b> an important factor in processes such as growth and metabolism. Szilard gave essential advice to Theodore Puck and Philip I. Marcus for their first cloning of a human cell in 1955.|$|E

Pathways for Thr degradation were removed by deleting tdh and mutating ilvA. The metA and lysA genes were deleted to make more precursors available for Thr biosynthesis. Further target genes to be engineered were identified by transcriptome profiling combined with in silico flux response analysis, and their expression levels were manipulated accordingly. The final engineered E. coli strain was able to produce Thr with a high yield of 0. 393 g per gram of glucose, and 82. 4 g/l Thr by fed-batch culture.

40|$|The {{striatum}} is {{the main}} input station of the basal ganglia and is strongly associated with motor and cognitive functions. Anatomical evidence suggests that individual striatal neurons are unlikely to share their inputs from the cortex. Using a biologically realistic large-scale network model of striatum and cortico-striatal projections, we provide a functional interpretation of the special anatomical structure of these projections. Specifically, we show that weak pairwise correlation within the pool of inputs to individual striatal neurons enhances the saliency of signal representation in the striatum. By contrast, correlations among the input pools of different striatal neurons render the signal representation less distinct from background activity. We suggest that for the network architecture of the striatum, there is a preferred cortico-striatal input configuration for optimal signal representation. It is further enhanced by the low-rate asynchronous background activity in striatum, supported by the balance between feedforward and <b>feedback</b> <b>inhibitions</b> in the striatal network. Thus, an appropriate combination of rates and correlations in the striatal input {{sets the stage for}} action selection presumably implemented in the basal ganglia...|$|R
40|$|In the {{previous}} paper (1), isoleucine fer-mentation utilizing D-threonine was demon-strated. Accumulation of L-isoleucine was observed {{only in the}} media containing r>-threonine. No accumulation occurred in the media devoid of D-threonine, also in the media supplemented with the other isoleucine iso-mers. It was {{interesting to note that}} L-isoleu-cine formation did not occur by the addition of L-threonine which has been generally recognized as the normal precursor of L-isoleucine in microorganisms (2 —f). This phenomenon suggested that threonine dehyd-ratase [threonine hydro-lyase (. deaminating) ] played an important role for isoleucine for-mation. Previous study (5) on the enzyme activities revealed that L-threonine dehydratase [EC 4. 2. 1. 16] was easily inhibited at low level of L-isoleucine, but D-threonine dehyd-ratase [EG 4. 2. 1. group] was inhibited only at high level of L-isoleucine. This difference of <b>feedback</b> <b>inhibitions</b> by L-isoleucine was considered to be the main cause for the ac-cumulation of L-isoleucine. From these results, D-threonine was sup-posed to be incorporated directly to L-isolcucine in this fermentation.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Poor {{counting}} {{and number}} identification {{in early childhood}} adulthood {{is associated with a}} wide range of negative adult outcomes. Despite the large amount of research showing a relationship between mathematics and inhibitory control, no intervention studies were found that included inhibition training as part of the numeracy instruction strategy. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of an audio taped counting and number identification intervention (Taped Numbers) and inhibitory control training (<b>Inhibition</b> <b>Feedback)</b> on counting and number identification in Aotearoa/New Zealand children in their first year of school. METHOD: This study employed an across participants multiple baseline design. Participants were six children in their first year of school from a primary school in Christchurch, Aotearoa/New Zealand who were nominated by their teacher as likely to benefit from a counting and number identification intervention. Taped Numbers used an audio-delivered task-based <b>feedback</b> strategy and <b>Inhibition</b> <b>Feedback</b> used an instructor-delivered task-based feedback strategy. RESULTS: Visual analysis of the data revealed that the Taped Numbers component of the intervention was moderately effective with two out of four replications for counting and three out of five replications for number identification. Extended Line Celeraton (ECL) analysis indicated large effect sizes for participants that made gains. DISCUSSION: Although both Taped Numbers and <b>Inhibition</b> <b>Feedback</b> were effective, no relationship could be established between gains in inhibitory control and gains in counting and number identification. The results are also discussed in relation to the current literature on counting and number identification interventions in early primary school. The practical implications of the findings are discussed as are recommendations for future research...|$|R
25|$|The flux of {{the entire}} pathway is {{regulated}} by the rate-determining steps. These are the slowest steps in a network of reactions. The rate-limiting step occurs {{near the beginning of}} the pathway and is regulated by <b>feedback</b> <b>inhibition,</b> which ultimately controls the overall rate of the pathway. The metabolic pathway in the cell is regulated by covalent or non-covalent modifications. A covalent modification involves an addition or removal of a chemical bond, whereas a non-covalent modification (also known as allosteric regulation) is the binding of the regulator to the enzyme via hydrogen bonds, electrostatic interactions, and Van Der Waals forces.|$|E
25|$|Acetyl-CoA {{is formed}} into malonyl-CoA by acetyl-CoA carboxylase, {{at which point}} malonyl-CoA is destined to feed into the fatty acid {{synthesis}} pathway. Acetyl-CoA carboxylase {{is the point of}} regulation in saturated straight-chain fatty acid synthesis, and is subject to both phosphorylation and allosteric regulation. Regulation by phosphorylation occurs mostly in mammals, while allosteric regulation occurs in most organisms. Allosteric control occurs as <b>feedback</b> <b>inhibition</b> by palmitoyl-CoA and activation by citrate. When there are high levels of palmitoyl-CoA, the final product of saturated fatty acid synthesis, it allosterically inactivates acetyl-CoA carboxylase to prevent a build-up of fatty acids in cells. Citrate acts to activate acetyl-CoA carboxylase under high levels, because high levels indicate that there is enough acetyl-CoA to feed into the Krebs cycle and produce energy.|$|E
25|$|Malignant Tumor cells perform {{glycolysis}} at a {{rate that}} is ten times faster than their noncancerous tissue counterparts. During their genesis, limited capillary support often results in hypoxia (decreased O2 supply) within the tumor cells. Thus, these cells rely on anaerobic metabolic processes such as glycolysis for ATP. Some tumor cells overexpress specific glycolytic enzymes which results in higher rates of glycolysis. Often these enzymes are Isoenzymes, of traditional glycolysis enzymes, that vary in their susceptibility to traditional <b>feedback</b> <b>inhibition.</b> The increase in glycolytic activity ultimately counteracts the effects of hypoxia by generating sufficient ATP from this anaerobic pathway. This phenomenon was first described in 1930 by Otto Warburg and {{is referred to as the}} Warburg effect. The Warburg hypothesis claims that cancer is primarily caused by dysfunctionality in mitochondrial metabolism, rather than because of uncontrolled growth of cells.|$|E

Proteome level quantification reveals that over 20 % of the observed overlapping proteome is differentially expressed under these conditions. Metabolic-induced differential expressions are observed along the central carbon metabolism, along with 12 other significantly regulated pathways.

Neovascularization may act as a conduit for the entry of leukocytes into sites of chronic inflammation. We observe vasa vasorum density correlates highly with the extent of inflammatory cells, not the size of atheromas in apolipoprotein E-deficient mice. We show atherosclerotic aortas contain activities that promote angiogenesis. The angiogenesis inhibitor angiostatin reduces plaque angiogenesis and inhibits atherosclerosis. Macrophages in the plaque and around vasa vasorum are reduced, but we detect no direct effect of angiostatin on monocytes. After angiogenesis blockade in vivo, the angiogenic potential of atherosclerotic tissue is suppressed.
