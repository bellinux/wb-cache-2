Aishwarya Rai was {{originally}} offered the lead role, but she refused <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>she</b> {{did not want to}} end up with another man in her first film with her husband (Bachchan) after their marriage. After Dostana release, she regretted the decision. Saif Ali Khan refused the role of Kunal because he was uncomfortable with a husband and wife (Bachchan and Rai) playing the other two leads. In early April 2008, Shilpa Shetty was signed for a special appearance in one of the film's songs.|$|E

5|$|Although Susan Hayward was {{reported}} to be in the running for one of the two female leads, Julie Harris was chosen for the role of Eleanor Lance. Wise had seen Harris on stage, and felt she was right for the part of the psychologically fragile Eleanor. Harris agreed to do the film in part because the role was complex and the idea of the house taking over Eleanor's mind was interesting. But she also chose <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>she</b> had a long-standing interest in parapsychology. English actress Claire Bloom was cast as Theo. In part, however, the decision to cast Bloom and Johnson was because of Eady Levy requirements that the cast be partly British. To make Bloom's character appear more bohemian, beatnik clothing designer Mary Quant was hired to design mod clothing specifically for the Theodora character.|$|E
5|$|Later {{on in the}} day, Mary Margaret finds a dove in {{the forest}} trapped in some wire mesh. The town vet (Kwesi Ameyew) at the shelter where David works tells her the bird will be okay but only if she returns to her flock. David offers to help Mary Margaret return the dove but she declines. He follows her anyway {{and is able to}} save her from falling off a cliff. It starts to pour so the two take shelter in an empty cabin. David asks Mary Margaret what is wrong and she admits she still has {{feelings}} for him, and he is the reason she goes to Granny's at 7:15. David replies that he goes to Granny's to see her. They nearly kiss but Mary Margaret stops <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>she</b> knows about Kathryn's pregnancy test. David explains that his feelings for Kathryn are memories but his feelings for Mary Margaret are real. She says they have to forget each other.|$|E
5|$|In Kansas City, Kansas, two {{religious}} missionaries visit {{two women}} at two different {{homes in the}} same neighborhood who look exactly alike. The second woman yells at them to go away and the two men, inexplicably, get into a fight in the second woman's front yard. Later, two FBI agents who look and sound remarkably similar to Mulder and Scully visit the first woman, Betty Templeton (Kathy Griffin). Betty claims to have never seen the other woman before. The other woman then passes her by in a car and the two agents begin fighting each other, much like the missionaries. They are severely injured after the gruesome mauling. Both agents, who had worked together for seven years, said that they were possessed. Meanwhile, the other woman, Lulu Pfeiffer (also Kathy Griffin), applies for a job at Koko's Copies, but does not get <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>she</b> has had 17 jobs in 17 states {{in the past three years}} and moves around too much.

When Michael Moon (Steve John Shepherd) tells his brother Tyler about Whitney's recent ordeal, he rejects her but later gives her his special Moon pendant {{to make up for}} it. Whitney agrees to go on a date with Tyler and they agree to have sex but Whitney is unsure as she remembers her past and runs out, telling Tyler she never wants to see him again. Tyler is hurt. He later tells Fatboy she needs a shrink which Whitney overhears. She runs out and kisses Fatboy and starts a relationship with him. Fatboy publicly declares his love for Whitney, but when he is unable to give her a driving lesson, Lucy (now Hetti Bywater) suggests that Tyler do <b>it,</b> <b>because</b> <b>she</b> knows that Tyler likes Whitney. Whitney starts to feel smothered by Fatboy's affections. Lucy teases Tyler by telling him that Fatboy plans to publicly propose to Whitney, so Tyler tells Whitney he likes her but Whitney says it is too late. Tyler then surprises Whitney by kissing her. Whitney, feeling guilty, refuses to go on holiday with Fatboy, and tells him to kiss her. He does, but she says it is like kissing her best friend. She then admits she wants Tyler, and Fatboy is heartbroken. Whitney then goes to see Tyler but finds him with Lucy, kissing. She then tells Tyler to leave her alone. However, Tyler later tells Whitney that he cannot, as he loves her. Whitney admits to feeling the same way, and they begin a relationship.|$|E
25|$|Sackville-West was {{a writer}} and author of novels. The Edwardians (1930) and All Passion Spent (1931) are perhaps her best-known novels today. In the latter, the elderly Lady Slane courageously embraces a long {{suppressed}} sense of freedom and whimsy {{after a lifetime of}} convention. This novel was dramatised by the BBC in 1986 starring Dame Wendy Hiller. All Passion Spent appears to reflect Woolf's influence, as Lady Slane, who has only existed while married to her late husband, a former prime minister, finally begins to live after his death, and becomes friends with the servants on her estate, discovering that the lives of people she had ignored until then are also interesting. At the end of the novel, Lady Slane persuades her granddaughter to break off an arranged marriage to pursue her career as a musician. Sackville-West took up writing again in 1930 after a six-year break {{for a variety of reasons}} as she needed money to pay for the Sissinghurst Castle which had just been purchased; Nicolson having left the Foreign Office no longer had a diplomat's salary to draw upon; she had to pay tuition for her two sons to attend Eton, one of the most expensive public schools in England; and <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>she</b> felt she had become a better writer thanks to the mentorship of Woolf who had taught her how to write better.|$|E

Refusing assistance from the fairies, they give her her own wand instead should she need help. At first reluctant to use <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>she</b> is determined to accomplish everything on her own, Aurora eventually succumbs when her duties prove overwhelming. However, her inexperience with magic leads to several consequences, which she is then forced to solve without magic.|$|E

500|$|Anniemal {{focuses on}} heavily layered beats, {{with a strong}} 1980s influence. Annie was {{influenced}} by 1980s dance-pop, and on [...] "No Easy Love", she includes a sample of Shakatak's 1982 song [...] "Easier Said Than Done". Unlike many of her contemporaries, Annie avoids using an ironic or kitschy in her take on 1980s music. The songs' styles span genres including bubblegum pop, electro, disco, R, dance-pop, and rock. Annie's DJing experiences taught her about sound and production and affected her music. She stated {{that she wanted to}} make a pop album that would not quickly become dated, [...] "an album that you could listen to in five years and it wouldn't sound terrible." [...] Annie considered excluding [...] "Greatest Hit" [...] from Anniemal to achieve this but ultimately included <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>she</b> felt it did not sound as if it were five years old.|$|E

Vulture.com's Maura Johnston criticized Trenyce for being [...] " [...] little yell-y, a little pitch-y, a little guarded", but praised her voice and song choices and felt that she set [...] "a precedent for the divas who followed" [...] in later American Idol seasons. Trenyce's performance of [...] "Let's Stay Together" [...] was included on the compilation album [...] (2003). AllMusic's Heather Phares thought Trenyce {{was one of the}} strongest performers of the show, but criticized her cover version for having an [...] "indistinct quality". In an interview, Trenyce said that she was offered a record deal, following her appearance on American Idol, but she and her mother (who was then her manager) rejected <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>she</b> found the terms unsatisfactory.|$|E

Back at Michael's condo, a frustrated Pam loses her composure and tells Michael she made a mistake leaving Dunder Mifflin and only did <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>she</b> was tired of being a receptionist. Michael calms her down, telling her the reality is they both quit and that their only option is to continue trying with the new company. Michael purchases office space in the Scranton Business Park, where Dunder Mifflin is located; {{it turns out to be}} a large closet directly underneath the Dunder Mifflin office. Michael and Pam put their company name in the office lobby directory where they encounter Charles.

500|$|Vishwam, an educated, {{unemployed}} youth, is {{an aspiring}} writer {{and had some}} of his short stories published in the newspapers earlier. He dreams of having his novel, titled Nirvriti (Ecstasy), published in the newspaper. He meets one of the newspaper editors (Vaikom Chandrasekharan Nair), who agrees to read his novel but declines to publish it as Vishwam does not have many writings to his credit. Sita is offered {{a job as a}} sales girl but cannot accept <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>she</b> is unable to pay the required security deposit of [...] 1,000. With several unsuccessful attempts to get a job, the increasing financial pressure forces them to shift to a slum. With an old lady named Janaki (Adoor Bhavani) and a prostitute named Kalyani (K. P. A. C. Lalitha) as their neighbours, things do not work as desired for the couple and they end up selling Sita's jewellery.|$|E
500|$|Even the novel's {{language}} bridges this divide. Waters often {{employs the}} word [...] "queer" [...] {{to describe the}} unusual or remarkable, instead of its post-1922 connotation to refer to homosexuality. She also uses the term specifically to highlight what is unusual {{as it applies to}} gender, or Nan's own emotions toward Kitty. Nan's father uses the symbol of the oyster, what he calls a [...] "real queer fish" [...] that exhibits both male and female characteristics, and compares it to Kitty who sits before them in feminine attire though they have seen her on stage dressed as a man. The landlady of the boarding house where Kitty and Nan are staying appraises Nan's first male costume, and is troubled by the [...] "queerness" [...] of <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>she</b> looks too much like a man, instead of a woman pretending to be a man. Donna Allegra suggests that by using the contemporary term for prostitutes, [...] "gay girls", Waters is winking at her readers.|$|E
500|$|The album {{begins with}} [...] "Phases and Stages/Washing the Dishes", {{with the woman}} tired of caring for her unfaithful husband, {{emphasizing}} her domestic chores. This is followed by [...] "Phases and Stages/Walkin'" [...] where, after consideration, she leaves her husband at night, saying [...] "Walkin' is better than runnin' away, and crawlin' ain't no good at all". In [...] "Pretend I Never Happened", she advises him to forget her and continue with his life. In [...] "Sister's Coming Home/Down at the Corner Beer Joint", her [...] younger sister describes the woman moving back home and sleeping late. Eventually, she overcomes her grief and begins a social life at the corner beer joint, representing her liberation with the lyrics [...] "(she's) dancin' on a hardwood floor, her jeans fit a little bit tighter than they did before". The final song of side one depicts the woman falling in love again but reluctant to admit <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>she</b> fears that her story will be repeated.|$|E

500|$|EMI Records, {{which had}} more {{experience}} in the pop market, headed the project and allowed Selena to choose one song that she liked. Her sister and drummer of the band, Suzette Quintanilla, said in a 1997 interview that the singer carefully chose a song that represented what [...] "Selena was all about". She chose [...] "Dreaming of You", which was written by American songwriters Franne Golde and Tom Snow in 1989 for American R group The Jets, who rejected it. [...] According to Snow, Golde [...] "never gave up on the tune and eventually got it to Selena". When Quintanilla III heard the demonstration recording, he told Selena {{he did not like}} the track. Selena told him she was going to record <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>she</b> favored its lyrical content and message. In a 2002 interview, Quintanilla III said he was [...] "more judgmental" [...] on his first impression of the demonstration recording than the song itself and cited its medley, content, and song structure for changing his mind.|$|E
500|$|Gillan {{refused to}} read the script {{for a few weeks}} after she {{received}} <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>she</b> [...] "didn't want to make it real".

I don't think it'll be what people expect."

However, on 12 October 2012, the BBC released an animated storyboard entitled [...] "P.S." [...] that depicted the scene with narration by Darvill. It takes place one week later in Brian's timeline after [...] "The Power of Three" [...] when a man named Anthony delivers him a letter from Rory, telling him that they will never return and that Anthony is their son they adopted in 1946. The scene was written to be a DVD extra, and was not filmed due to time constraints.|$|E
500|$|The {{flu season}} has hit Pawnee hard, leaving nurse Ann (Rashida Jones) caring for many sick {{citizens}} at the hospital. Among them are April (Aubrey Plaza), who constantly mistreats Ann {{in retaliation for}} kissing Andy (Chris Pratt). [...] April asks Ron (Nick Offerman) not to tell Andy {{she is in the}} hospital, and Ron is anxious not to get involved in their personal affairs. Leslie (Amy Poehler) also has the flu, but will not admit <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>she</b> wants to give an important presentation to the Pawnee Chamber of Commerce about the planned Harvest Festival, which she hopes will restore the dwindling budget of the parks department. Ben (Adam Scott) finally takes a reluctant Leslie to the hospital, where she is admitted with a dangerously high fever and dehydration. Ben and Tom (Aziz Ansari) decide to do the presentation themselves, much to the chagrin of Leslie, who does not trust anyone but herself to do it. Tom immediately abandons Ben to hang out with a group of older men at the spa.|$|E
