5|$|Fork-marked lemurs are {{sensitive}} to light intensity, and emerge at twilight, calling numerous times and answering their neighbors' calls before going off to forage. Just before dawn, they also communicate again {{on their way to}} their sleep site. Cold temperatures can also cause individuals to retire to their sleeping site as early as two hours before dawn. Their eye shine creates a unique pattern among lemurs because they tend to bob their heads up and down and <b>from</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> <b>side.</b>|$|E
5|$|If a male is interested, he will stretch {{his neck}} and erect his feathers, then bend over and peck at the ground. He will circle around and sidle up to the female, swaying his body and neck <b>from</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> <b>side,</b> and rubbing his breast against his partner's rump. Often the female will reject his {{advances}} with aggression, but if amenable, she signals acceptance by squatting down and raising her rump.|$|E
5|$|Kenny Baker as R2-D2, an astromech droid {{that saves}} Queen Amidala's ship when other droids fail. Before the film's {{production}} started, fans campaigned on the Internet to retain Baker as R2-D2; Lucas replied that the actor would remain. Baker {{is used for}} scenes where R2-D2 bends forwards and backwards and wobbles <b>from</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> <b>side.</b> Robots and a digital model were used in other shots.|$|E

A defensive attitude involves lying {{flat on the ground}} or crouching with wings spread out.|$|E
5|$|When tufted males clap, females look {{towards them}} and display {{a greater number}} of tap {{displays}} to them than to the gray morph. Females also respond to tufted morphs' clapping more often by settling than for gray males. However, after the females look towards the males, gray males approach the female more often than the tufted male. Females often tip their abdomens <b>from</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> <b>side.</b>|$|E
5|$|While long {{thought to}} have been aquatic or semiaquatic, hadrosaurids were not as well-suited for {{swimming}} as other dinosaurs (particularly theropods, who were once {{thought to have}} been unable to pursue hadrosaurids into water). Hadrosaurids had slim hands with short fingers, making their forelimbs ineffective for propulsion, and the tail was also not useful for propulsion because of the ossified tendons that increased its rigidity, and the poorly developed attachment points for muscles that would have moved the tail <b>from</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> <b>side.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{habits of}} the Gabon batis {{are similar to those}} of other batises and it is {{territorial}} and usually seen either singly, in pairs or in small family groups. It is a restless but unobtrusive bird and patrols the whole of its 18-20 ha territory each day, the male taking the lead and singing his song, especially in the morning and late afternoon. This species and the West African batis regularly have hostile interactions which the Gabon batis reacts to by raising its crown feathers and flicking its wings and tail while moving <b>from</b> <b>sided</b> <b>to</b> <b>side.</b> In the hottest part of the day the Gabon batis has been known to sunbathe.|$|R

5|$|While seated {{upon the}} bare rocks I have often {{observed}} these little animals watching me, apparently {{with as much}} curiosity as I watched them, turning their heads <b>from</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> <b>side</b> as if {{in an effort to}} be wise. If I kept quiet for a few minutes they would creep up to me and finally upon me; if I moved, they ran down the faces of the rocks, and turning, stuck their heads above the edges to watch me.|$|E
5|$|Crocodilians are large, low-slung aquatic {{reptiles}} {{with long}} snouts and {{large numbers of}} teeth. The head and trunk are dorso-ventrally flattened and the tail is laterally compressed. It undulates <b>from</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> <b>side</b> to force the animal through the water when swimming. The tough keratinized scales provide body armour and some are fused to the skull. The nostrils, eyes and ears are elevated above {{the top of the}} flat head enabling them to remain above {{the surface of the water}} when the animal is floating. Valves seal the nostrils and ears when it is submerged. Unlike other reptiles, crocodilians have hearts with four chambers allowing complete separation of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood.|$|E
5|$|Even when staying {{relatively}} motionless, a rider can {{balance a}} bike {{by the same}} principle. While performing a track stand, the rider can keep {{the line between the}} two contact patches under the combined center of mass by steering the front wheel to {{one side or the other}} and then moving forward and backward slightly to move the front contact patch <b>from</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> <b>side</b> as necessary. Forward motion can be generated simply by pedaling. Backwards motion can be generated the same way on a fixed-gear bicycle. Otherwise, the rider can take advantage of an opportune slope of the pavement or lurch the upper body backwards while the brakes are momentarily engaged.|$|E
50|$|Typically {{the bearing}} boxes were {{designed}} to allow the axle to slide some either way, and the wheel cranks and the coupling rods were modified to accommodate this extra range of motion. Spring centering might also be provided to keep the wheels on such axles <b>from</b> hunting <b>side</b> <b>to</b> <b>side.</b>|$|R
50|$|With the Cine Capri {{continental}} seating {{was introduced}} to the community. This was a sloping floor plan using eight hundred high-back, maroon rocking chairs in which the rows of seats flowed <b>from</b> <b>side</b> aisle <b>to</b> <b>side</b> aisle; eliminating the center aisle. In later years however this floor plan had to be changed to conform to changes in the fire codes.|$|R
5000|$|Stationary DCC {{recorders}} (i.e. recorders {{meant for}} use in home stereo systems) such as the DCC-900 use a head assembly that has 9 (MR) playback heads and 9 (coil) recording heads for DCC, and two (MR) heads for playing analog compact cassettes. This type of head assembly {{was designed to be}} rotated by the mechanism when the recorder/player switched <b>from</b> <b>side</b> A <b>to</b> <b>side</b> B.|$|R
5|$|Females are {{attracted}} by the booms of the competing males; they too may need to walk several kilometres from their territories to the arena. Once a female enters the court {{of one of the}} males, the male performs a display in which he rocks <b>from</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> <b>side</b> and makes clicking noises with his beak. He turns his back to the female, spreads his wings in display and walks backwards towards her. He will then attempt copulation for 2 to 14minutes. Once the birds have mated, the female returns to her home territory to lay eggs and raise the chicks. The male continues booming in the hope of attracting another female.|$|E
5|$|Frogs {{that live}} in or visit water have adaptations that improve their {{swimming}} abilities. The hind limbs are heavily muscled and strong. The webbing between the toes of the hind feet increases {{the area of the}} foot and helps propel the frog powerfully through the water. Members of the family Pipidae are wholly aquatic and show the most marked specialization. They have inflexible vertebral columns, flattened, streamlined bodies, lateral line systems, and powerful hind limbs with large webbed feet. Tadpoles mostly have large tail fins which provide thrust when the tail is moved <b>from</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> <b>side.</b>|$|E
5|$|In frogs the {{pelvic girdle}} is robust and the hind legs are much longer and {{stronger}} than the forelimbs. The feet have four or five digits and the toes are often webbed for swimming or have suction pads for climbing. Frogs have large eyes and no tail. Salamanders resemble lizards in appearance; their short legs project sideways, the belly is close to or {{in contact with the}} ground and they have a long tail. Caecilians superficially resemble earthworms and are limbless. They burrow by means of zones of muscle contractions which move along the body and they swim by undulating their body <b>from</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> <b>side.</b>|$|E
50|$|Nine {{heads are}} used to read/write half {{the width of the}} tape; {{the other half of the}} width are used for the B-side. Eight of these tracks contain audio data, the ninth track is used for {{auxiliary}} information such as song titles and track markers, as well as markers to make the player switch <b>from</b> <b>side</b> A <b>to</b> <b>side</b> B (with or without winding towards the end of the tape first) and end-of-tape markers.|$|R
50|$|Like most {{role-playing}} games, Supernatural requires several players; {{one person}} to be the Game Master and two to five others to play hunters such as Dean Winchester and Sam Winchester. It also requires multiple polyhedral dice ranging <b>from</b> four <b>sided</b> <b>to</b> twelve <b>sided.</b>|$|R
50|$|Motorcycle {{carrying}} trailers may be open or enclosed. They may be wide, for two machines side-by-side, or narrow, {{for just}} a single machine. The main features that distinguish them from other flatbed or enclosed trailers are track(s) to keep the wheels <b>from</b> sliding <b>side</b> <b>to</b> <b>side</b> and sufficient tiedown points to keep the motorcycle(s) from tipping. They may also tilt, or include ramp(s) to facilitate the loading and unloading of motorcycles. Trailer manufacturers often offer trailers specifically designed for carrying motorcycles.|$|R
5|$|In frogs, the {{hind legs}} {{are larger than}} the fore legs, {{especially}} so in those species that principally move by jumping or swimming. In the walkers and runners the hind limbs are not so large, and the burrowers mostly have short limbs and broad bodies. The feet have adaptations for the way of life, with webbing between the toes for swimming, broad adhesive toe pads for climbing, and keratinised tubercles on the hind feet for digging (frogs usually dig backwards into the soil). In most salamanders, the limbs are short and {{more or less the}} same length and project at right angles from the body. Locomotion on land is by walking and the tail often swings <b>from</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> <b>side</b> or is used as a prop, particularly when climbing. In their normal gait, only one leg is advanced at a time in the manner adopted by their ancestors, the lobe-finned fish. Some salamanders in the genus Aneides and certain plethodontids climb trees and have long limbs, large toepads and prehensile tails. In aquatic salamanders and in frog tadpoles, the tail has dorsal and ventral fins and is moved <b>from</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> <b>side</b> as a means of propulsion. Adult frogs do not have tails and caecilians have only very short ones.|$|E
5|$|In most amphibians, {{there are}} four digits on the fore foot and five on the hind foot, but no claws on either. Some {{salamanders}} have fewer digits and the amphiumas are eel-like in appearance with tiny, stubby legs. The sirens are aquatic salamanders with stumpy forelimbs and no hind limbs. The caecilians are limbless. They burrow {{in the manner of}} earthworms with zones of muscle contractions moving along the body. On the surface of the ground or in water they move by undulating their body <b>from</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> <b>side.</b>|$|E
5|$|The third {{mechanism}} {{occurs when}} the chest is compressed from front to back, causing it to widen <b>from</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> <b>side.</b> The lungs adhere to the chest wall because of the negative pressure {{between them and the}} pleural membranes lining the inside of the chest cavity; thus when the chest widens, they are pulled apart. This creates tension at the carina; the airway tears if this tensile force exceeds its elasticity. This mechanism may be the cause of injury when the chest is crushed. Most TBI are probably due to a combination of these three mechanisms.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} {{absorption}} and transport of pachymic acid (PA) {{isolated from the}} sclerotium of Poria cocos (Schw.) Wolf. in human intestinal epithelium. Methods: By using Caco- 2 (the human colonic adenocarcinoma cell lines) cell monolayers as an intestinal epithelial cell model, the permeability of PA was studied <b>from</b> apical <b>side</b> (AP <b>side)</b> <b>to</b> basolateral <b>side</b> (BL <b>side)</b> or <b>from</b> BL <b>side</b> <b>to</b> AP <b>side.</b> The PA was measured by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography coupled with UV detector at maximum absorption wavelength of 210 nm. Transport parameters and apparent permeability coefficients (Papp) were then calculated and {{compared with those of}} propranolol and atenolol, which were the transcellular transport markers for high and poor permeability respectively. Results: The Papp values of PA were (9. 50 ± 2. 20) 10 － 7 cm/s <b>from</b> AP <b>side</b> <b>to</b> BL <b>side,</b> and (11. 30 ± 5. 90) 10 － 7 cm/s <b>from</b> BL <b>side</b> <b>to</b> AP <b>side,</b> respectively. Under the condition of this experiment, the Papp values were 1. 45 × 10 － 5 cm/s for propranolol and 4. 22 × 10 － 7 cm/s for atenolol. Conclusion: PA is transported through the Caco- 2 cell monolayer in a concentration-dependent manner and the transport was linear with time. The absorption in apical to basolateral direction and secretion in basolateral to apical direction were poor and their Papp values were comparable to atenolol. Besides passive diffusion of PA, ATP is partially involved in its transpor...|$|R

5|$|The willie wagtail {{is almost}} always on the move and rarely still {{for more than a}} few moments during {{daylight}} hours. Even while perching it will flick its tail <b>from</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> <b>side,</b> twisting about looking for prey. Birds are mostly encountered singly or in pairs, although they may gather in small flocks. Unlike other fantails, much of its time is spent on the ground. It beats its wings deeply in flight, interspersed with a swift flying dip. It characteristically wags its tail upon landing after a short dipping flight.|$|E
5|$|There are 34 known {{vertebrae}} of Plesiorycteropus. The animal had {{at least}} seven sacral and five or six lumbar vertebrae. A find of associated caudal vertebrae {{from the base of}} the tail, which diminish in size only slowly from front to back, suggests that the tail was long. There is no evidence for the additional joints between the vertebrae that are characteristic of xenarthrans. In the seven known thoracic (chest) vertebrae, the articulations with the intervertebral disks are bean-shaped and much wider <b>from</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> <b>side</b> than from top to bottom. In the back thoracics and all lumbars, a longitudinal transarcual canal is present in the neural arch.|$|E
5|$|Despite Arsenal being {{reduced to}} 10 men, the scores {{remained}} {{level as the}} game went into its final minute, when Diego Forlán went to ground in the penalty area under a challenge from Arsenal defender Martin Keown while trying to reach a Gary Neville cross. The referee deemed this a foul and awarded a penalty. Van Nistelrooy stepped up to take the penalty, despite having missed his previous two penalties for Manchester United. Lehmann tried to put him off by moving <b>from</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> <b>side</b> along the goal line, and it appeared to work: the shot hit the bar and rebounded back into play, and the Dutchman was immediately confronted by Keown. Within a minute, the final whistle blew and the match finished as a goalless draw.|$|E

40|$|A {{thickness}} gradient interpenetrating {{polymer network}} (IPN) was easily created that {{takes advantage of}} the relatively poor compatibility and curing rates discrepancy between epoxy (EP) and polyurethane (PU). Ultraviolet absorption spectrum (UV-Vis), thermogravimetric (TG), Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), Dynamic thermomechanical analysis (DMA), Atomic force microscope (AFM) and water contact angle were adopted to characterize this IPN structure. We found that the absorption in visible light region, glass-transition temperatures (Tg), thermal decomposition temperatures (Td) and Derjaguin–Muller–Toporov (DMT) modulus were increasing along with the gradient direction <b>from</b> bottom <b>side</b> <b>to</b> top <b>side</b> of the IPN. While the absorption in ultraviolet region and adhesion force were decreasing along with the gradient direction <b>from</b> bottom <b>side</b> <b>to</b> top <b>side</b> of the IPN.
