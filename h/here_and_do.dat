25|$|In the Churwell area of Leeds is the White Rose Shopping Centre. Opening in 1997, {{the centre}} has over 100 high street stores {{anchored}} by Debenhams, Marks & Spencer, Primark and Sainsbury's. Some stores have their only Leeds presence <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>do</b> not trade in Central Leeds, {{such as the}} Disney Store and Build-A-Bear workshop. Although the centre is below the average typical size for out of town shopping malls like the Trafford Centre or Meadowhall in nearby Yorkshire city Sheffield, it remains popular with national and international chains. Of the 40,000 {{people who work in}} retailing in Leeds 75% work in places which are not located in the city centre. There are additional shopping centres located in the many villages that became part of the county borough and in the towns that were incorporated in the City of Leeds in 1974.|$|E
500|$|In February, Dodd {{turned his}} {{attention}} fully to the early primary states of Iowa and New Hampshire. When asked by the Associated Press {{on the campaign trail}} if his campaigning really made a difference in changing public perceptions, he replied, [...] "There is enough time yet to change this , because there are places like Iowa and New Hampshire that give candidates like myself a chance to be heard." [...] Dodd's strategy was to speak to voters in restaurants, homes, and small-town diners, although political analysts wondered whether such methods were out-of-date. But he maintained that [...] "chatting in a living room face to face is still a very important feature of campaigning here. I don't think you can come in <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>do</b> sort of a wholesale political operation from [...] with a pit stop here and there and a media campaign behind you." [...] At the end of February, Dodd differentiated himself from his Democratic counterparts by stating his support for the Bush administration's willingness to hold joint talks with Iran and Syria and by stating that as president he would avoid talking with Iran as long as Mahmoud Ahmadinejad remained as president. On the trail, he referred to Ahmadinejad as a [...] "thug".|$|E
