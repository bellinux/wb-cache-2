Lansdale had written a legal opinion for the Manhattan Project that it was within the powers of the President of the United States to conclude such agreements with the British without consulting Congress. In July 1945, Lansdale concluded an agreement with Brazil for the purchase of 3,000 tons of thorium-bearing monazite ore. For his wartime services, Lansdale was awarded the Legion of Merit and was made an honorary Commander of the Order of the British Empire.|$|E
500|$|After Hurricane Katrina in 2005, Rowland and Beyoncé {{founded the}} Survivor Foundation, a {{charitable}} <b>entity</b> <b>set</b> up to provide transitional housing for victims and storm evacuees in the Houston, Texas area. The Survivor Foundation extended the philanthropic {{mission of the}} Knowles-Rowland Center for Youth, a multi-purpose community outreach facility in downtown Houston. Rowland and Beyoncé lent their voices to a collaboration with Kitten Sera, entitled [...] "All That I'm Lookin for". The song appeared on The Katrina CD album, whose proceeds went to the Recording Artists for Hope organization. In 2006, Rowland joined other artists such as Pink and Avril Lavigne in ads for so-called empowerment tags for the ALDO Fights AIDS campaign, which went on sale exclusively at ALDO stores and benefited the YouthAIDS initiative. Rowland returned to television that same year, playing Tammy Hamilton, in the sixth season of UPN sitcom Girlfriends. Rowland initially hoped her three-episode stint would expand to a larger recurring role, but as the show was moved to The CW Television Network the following year plans for a return eventually went nowhere.|$|E
500|$|Prior to the 2011–2012 season, Barcelona had a {{long history}} of {{avoiding}} corporate sponsorship on the playing shirts. On 14 July 2006, the club announced a five-year agreement with UNICEF, which includes having the UNICEF logo on their shirts. The agreement had the club donate €1.5million per year to UNICEF (0.7% of its ordinary income, equal to the UN International Aid Target, cf. ODA) via the FC Barcelona Foundation. The FC Barcelona Foundation is an <b>entity</b> <b>set</b> up in 1994 on the suggestion of then-chairman of the Economical-Statutory Committee, Jaime Gil-Aluja. The idea was to set up a foundation that could attract financial sponsorships to support a non-profit sport company. In 2004, a company could become one of 25 [...] "Honorary members" [...] by contributing between £40,000–60,000 (£–) per year. There are also 48 associate memberships available for an annual fee of £14,000 (£) and an unlimited number of [...] "patronages" [...] for the cost of £4,000 per year (£). It is unclear whether the honorary members have any formal say in club policy, but according to the author Anthony King, it is [...] "unlikely that Honorary Membership would not involve at least some informal influence over the club".|$|E

40|$|Success in schema {{integration}} {{depends on}} understanding the semantics of schema components (e. g., <b>entity</b> <b>sets,</b> relationship sets, attributes), {{and the ability}} to capture and reason about these semantics. An important objective of our work on schema integration is to automate the reasoning as much as possible, and when not possible, depend on the human input and guidance. A key results of comparing the semantics associated with schema objects is that of determining attribute relationship. Once attribute relationships are determined, the task of object class(e. g., <b>entity</b> <b>sets</b> and relationship sets) integration becomes simpler and can e automated to a great extent. In our work, we use a classifier borrowed from the research in knowledge representation(particularly the KL-ONE family of systems) for automatically integrating objects classes...|$|R
40|$|This a {{proposal}} for adding seven mathematical and letterlike characters that was considered and approved at a recent Unicode Technical Committee meeting and is submitted as a liaison contribution. The text below is {{an updated version of}} {{a proposal}} submitted to the UTC by the mathematical community. Background Unicode 3. 2, but also Unicode 3. 1 and to a lesser degree Unicode 4. 0 added mathematical characters to support the mathematical user community. The large number of character involved made these additions a rather complex undertaking. During a recent review of the mathematical classification and mapping to the ISO 9573 - 13 <b>entity</b> <b>sets</b> for addition to Unicode Technical Report # 25, Unicode support for Mathematics, several characters were found missing. In some cases, these can more or less directly be encoded by combining sequences, and where that was possible, they were removed from the request before completion of this proposal. In reviewing existing character collections, some non-mathematicaletterlike characters were discovered and are proposed here for addition. One of the goals of MathML is complete support for the SGML <b>entity</b> <b>sets</b> from ISO 9573 - 13. Providing this support allows existing SGML documents to be carried forward into MathML. The mapping of these <b>entity</b> <b>sets</b> has three issue...|$|R

40|$|Association rule mining is an {{important}} data mining problem. It {{is found to be}} useful for conventional relational data. However, previous work has mostly targeted on mining a single table. In real life, a database is typically made up of multiple tables and one important case is where some of the tables form a star schema. The tables typically correspond to <b>entity</b> <b>sets</b> and joining the tables in a star schema gives relationships among <b>entity</b> <b>sets</b> which can be very interesting information. Hence mining on the join result is {{an important}} problem. Based on characteristics of the star schema we propose an efficient algorithm for mining association rules on the join result but without actually performing the join operation. We show that this approach can significantly out-perform the join-then-mine approach even when the latter adopts a fastest known mining algorithm. ...|$|R
