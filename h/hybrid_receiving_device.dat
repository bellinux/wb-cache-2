50|$|One {{drawback}} {{of using}} source-synchronous clocking {{is the creation}} of a separate clock-domain at the <b>receiving</b> <b>device,</b> namely the clock-domain of the strobe generated by the transmitting device. This strobe clock-domain is often not synchronous to the core clock domain of the <b>receiving</b> <b>device.</b> For proper operation of the received data with other data already present in the device, an additional stage of synchronization logic is required to transfer the received data into the core clock-domain of the <b>receiving</b> <b>device.</b> This stage can often be found alongside source synchronous logic. This usually results in greater system complexity compared to globally clocked systems, but the benefits are generally much greater than this increase in complexity.|$|R
