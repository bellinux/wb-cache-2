25|$|The American {{economist}} and New York Times columnist Paul Krugman {{has suggested that}} he fails {{to understand how the}} short term costs of euro membership to the Finnish economy outweigh the large gains caused by greater integration with the European economy. Krugman notes, that Sweden which has yet to join the single currency, had similar rates of growth compared to Finland for the period since the introduction of the euro. Membership of the euro protects Finland from currency fluctuation, which is particularly important for small member states of the European Union like Finland that are highly integrated into the larger European economy. If Finland had retained its own currency, an unpredictable exchange rates would prevent the country from selling its products at competitive prices on the European market. In fact, business leaders in Sweden, which is obliged to join the euro when its economy has converged with the eurozone, are almost universal in their support for joining the euro. Although Sweden's currency is not officially pegged to the euro like Denmark's currency the Swedish government maintains an unofficial peg. This exchange rate policy has in the short term benefited the Swedish economy in two ways; (1) much of Sweden's European trade is already denominated in euros and therefore bypasses any currency fluctuation and <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> <b>losses,</b> (2) it allows Sweden's non euro-area exports to remain competitive by dampening any pressure from the financial markets to increase the value of the currency. Maintaining this balance has allowed the Swedish government to borrow on the international financial markets at record low interest rates and allowed the Swedish central bank to quantitatively ease into a fundamentally sound economy. This has led Sweden's economy to prosper at the expense of less sound economies who have been impacted by the 2008 financial crisis. Sweden's economic performance has therefore been slightly better than Finland's since the financial crisis of 2008. Much of this disparity has, however, been due to the economic dominance of Nokia, Finlands largest company and Finland's only major multinational. Nokia supported and greatly benefited from the euro and the European single market, particularly from a common European digital mobile phone standard (GSM), but it failed to adapt when the market shifted to mobile computing. One reason for the popularity of the euro in Finland is the memory of a 'great depression' which began in 1990, with Finland not regaining it competitiveness until approximately a decade later when Finland joined the single currency. Some American economists like Paul Krugman claim not to understand the benefits of a single currency and allege that poor economic performance is the result of membership of the single currency. These economists do not, however, advocate separate currencies for member states within the American union, many of which have quite disparate economies.|$|E

40|$|I. The export {{performance}} of the euro area Euro–area exporters have performed relatively well during the period spanning {{the launch of the}} euro up to the onset of the global economic crisis. Notwithstanding a substantial appreciation of the euro's real effective <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> <b>losses</b> in market share were more contained than for the US or Japan. Euro-area exporters benefited from a strong position in fast-growing destinations such as Russia and new EU Member States, which more than offset a comparatively weaker position on the Chinese market. Judging by traditional indicators of comparative advantage, the sectoral structure of the euro-area exports does not appear particularly strong, with a higher specialisation in labour intensive goods than the US or Japan and a weaker specialisation in research-intensive and ICT sectors. But euro-area exporters performed well in some key export sectors, which worked as export engines. Among those were fast-growing, high-tech sectors such as pharmaceuticals, but also medium-tech, slower-growing ones such as machinery and transport. There is also evidence that exporters have withstood competition by improving product quality. Notwithstanding a relatively good pre-crisis performance, euro-area exporters have been strongly affected by the crisis and face a number of medium-term challenges. These include the shift of the driving force of world trade from advanced to emerging economies and a potentially lasting negative effect of the crisis on demand in some important trade destinations...|$|E

It also considers the determinants of the REER in connection with the choice of exchange regime after unification. The study illustrates how economic policy variables and exogenous shocks affect the real exchange rate primarily through the fiscal balance, and consequently, the savings-investment gap. It further illustrates that the appropriate level of REER and its medium-term path depend upon the mix of monetary, fiscal, and structural policies that underpin the evolution of inflation, balance of payments, and productivity growth.

40|$|Many {{countries}} have moved towards more {{flexible exchange rate}} regimes {{over the last decade}} to take advantage of greater monetary policy autonomy and flexibility in responding to external shocks. Some reluctance to let go of pegged exchange rates persists, however, despite the benefits of flexibility. The institutional and operational requirements needed to support a floating exchange rate, as well as difficulties in assessing the right time and manner to exit, tend to be additional factors in this reluctance. This volume presents the concrete steps taken by a number of countries in transition to greater exchange rate flexibility and elaborates on the operational ingredients that proved helpful in promoting successful and durable transitions. It attempts to provide a better understanding (and hence a "road map") of how these various operational ingredients were established and coordinated, how their implementation interacted with macro and other conditions, and how they contributed to the smoothness of each transition.

In contrast to theoretical predictions, employment in both the tradable and non-tradable sectors contracts following a real appreciation.

40|$|Emerging market {{countries}} have enjoyed an exceptionally favorable economic environment throughout 2004, 2005, and early 2006. In particular, accommodative U. S. monetary policy {{in recent years}} has helped create an environment of low interest rates in international capital markets. However, if world interest rates were to take a sudden upward course, this would lead to less hospitable financing conditions for emerging market countries. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to measure the effects of world interest rate shocks on real activity in Thailand. The analysis incorporates balance sheet related credit market frictions into the IMF’s Global Economy Model (GEM) and finds that Thailand would best minimize the adverse effects of rising world interest rates if it were to follow a flexible <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regime.

We find that {{these two types of}} FDI differ substantially with respect to their influence on growth. While Greenfield FDI substantially enhances growth, M&As have no effect, at best. We also demonstrate that, in contrast to Greenfield FDI, a larger volume of M&As results in an appreciated real <b>exchange</b> <b>rate.</b> The resulting <b>loss</b> in price competitiveness may explain the poor growth effect of the M&A variant of FDI.

40|$|This paper uses a two-country {{version of}} the global economy model to {{investigate}} some costs and benefits of a small, emerging economy’s abandoning a flexible <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regime in favor of adopting the currency of its main trading partner. The topic is particularly relevant for countries in central and eastern Europe, which recently joined the European Union and are now preparing to adopt the euro. We begin by evaluating macroeconomic performance in an inflation-targeting regime under various monetary policy rules. The results are then compared with the case where the small economy gives up its flexible <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> and joins the monetary union, under a number of alternative assumptions about the magnitude of shocks and structural rigidities. The analysis shows that although the monetary union has the benefit of eliminating <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> shocks, the <b>loss</b> of the buffering role of the <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> leads to greater volatility in domestic output and inflation. These costs are likely to decline over time, as markets become more competitive, flexible, and integrated in the monetary union. [JEL C 51, E 31, E 52...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{estimates}} a {{speculative attack}} model of currency crises {{in order to}} identify the role of economic fundamentals and any early warning signals of a potential currency crisis. The data from the Mexican economy was used to illustrate the model. Based on the results, a deterioration in fundamentals appears to have generated high one-step-ahead probabilities for the regime changes during the sample period 1982 - 1994. Particularly, increases in inflation differentials, appreciations of the real <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> foreign reserve <b>losses,</b> expansionary monetary and fiscal policies, and increases in the share of short-term foreign currency debt appear to have contributed to the market pressures and regime changes in that period. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{look for}} {{symptoms}} of Dutch {{disease in the}} Pakistani economy arising from international remittances. The presence of endogeneity and uncertainty in our model due to the managed float of Pakistani Rupee prevalent {{during most of the}} studied period requires the use of a probabilistic rather than a standard frequentist technique. Therefore, we carry out an IV Bayesian analysis using the Gibbs algorithm. We find evidence for both spending and resource movement effects, both of them in the short as well as the long-run. Remittances cause an appreciation of the real <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> and <b>loss</b> of competitiveness of Pakistan’s exports sector along with a concomitant rise in the share of the non-tradable sector in the economy. These impacts are stronger and different from those the Official Development Assistance and the FDI exert. We find that while aggregate remittances and the remittances from Persian Gulf contribute to the Dutch disease in Pakistan, those from North America and Europe do not.

40|$|During {{the last}} decade many Central and East European (CEE) {{countries}} experienced strong foreign capital inflows. Slovenia was one of them. Sources of inflows in Slovenia changed radically, even though privatisation-driven inflows were absent, in contrast to other CEE countries. Since such inflows could have significant adverse effects {{on the performance of}} the economy, some policy measures were taken. This article presents an empirically tested assessment of policy for adjustment to surges in capital flows during {{the last decade}}. Speculative reversals, a decline in external competitiveness, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> appreciation, <b>loss</b> of control over the monetary base and inflation {{are just some of the}} detrimental effects that can be provoked by surges in capital flows if the economy suffers from fundamental sectoral deficiencies. Empirical results indicated that Slovenia quite successfully mitigated the listed effects of excessive foreign exchange inflows. Efficient combination of direct and indirect adjustment methods succeeded in preventing the still vulnerable economy from suffering a major financial crisis and nominal currency appreciation (which was not the case in some other CEE countries) although there was some real appreciation. ...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{provides}} an alternative {{explanation for the}} "resource curse" based on the income effect resulting from high government current spending in resource rich economies. Using a simple life cycle framework, we show that private investment in the non-resource sector is adversely affected if private agents expect extra government current spending financed through resource sector revenues in the future. This income channel of the resource curse is stronger for countries with lower degrees of openness and forward altruism. We empirically validate these findings by estimating non-hydrocarbon sector growth regressions using a panel of 25 oil-exporting countries over 1992 - 2005.

40|$|The {{benefit of}} {{international}} trade is a more efficient employment of the productive forces of the world. (John Stuart Mill) The <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> is a primary factor that influences economy. This instrument is used by some countries {{in order to improve}} the lack of balance caused {{as a result of the}} financial crisis felt in many countries considered by then infallible. The negative effects of the financial crisis can also be found in the decreased volume of commodities involved in international trade exchanges, as a consequence of modified prices and decreased offer. The globalizing trend leads to a constant expansion of exchanges between countries and to the consolidation of international cooperation. Except that economic interdependence generates an increased risk under the influence of economic, financial, monetary or political factors. The currency risk can generate either a gain or loss during foreign trade operations. The long period of RON depreciation made possible the entry of Romanian products on the international markets due to their prices. Sheltered by the gain generated by the evolution of the <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> most of the exporters were not concerned by the increase of product competitiveness or by avoiding the currency risk. The fact that, for many years, the evolution of the <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> generated substantial <b>losses</b> for the exporters shows that risk coverage in Romania is, in most cases, a purely theoretical concept. <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> currency, depreciation, appreciation, J Curve...|$|R
