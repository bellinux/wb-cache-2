40|$|The British general {{election}} on 10 May 2010 delivered Britain’s first hung Parliament since February 1974, {{and in the}} run-up, the Conservative Party made much of the economic difficulties Britain faced {{in the second half}} of the 1970 s in order to try and convince voters that anything other than a Tory vote would risk exposing the nation to the discipline of financial markets. The question of how well equipped an exceptional kind of British government is to deal with <b>exceptional</b> <b>economic</b> <b>circumstances</b> is therefore of paramount importance. This paper argues that the Conservative Party made too much of the impact of the 1974 hung Parliament in precipitating subsequent economic crisis and suggests that as such, there is no reason to assume that the Conservative-Liberal coalition government is ill-equipped to manage British economic affairs in difficult circumstances...|$|E
30|$|Compared {{with the}} {{previous}} literature, our paper {{has a number of}} novelties. Firstly, it uses data from the 2007 – 13 EU programing period. All the previous empirical studies refer to older programing periods. Thanks to the availability of high-quality data (with localization details) of the website OpenCoesione, we are able to estimate the impact of the EU funding on a number of local outcomes, which, at the time of writing, are measurable until 2013. Our estimation window covers the period of the financial and economic crisis. Therefore, our findings provide hints about the countercyclical impact of the EU policy rather than suggestions for the medium-term consequences of the interventions. Indeed, as we explain below, many programs were re-targeted explicitly to address the strains of the downturn. Given that we are studying a timespan of <b>exceptional</b> <b>economic</b> <b>circumstances,</b> it might be hard to imagine that our findings could provide lessons for periods with less extreme conditions.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{tries to}} {{contribute}} to the research stream of organizational buying behavior by examining the impact of the economic situation on organizational buying. It aims to discover whether purchasing managers changed their behavior during the economic boom in 2007 and the subsequent crisis of 2008. On the basis of 84 interviews in the business-to-business field, the perceived risks and countermeasures revealed by purchasers in these <b>exceptional</b> <b>economic</b> <b>circumstances</b> were investigated. The empirical findings suggest that economic circumstances influence altered risk perception and also the type of risk which is perceived. The further research results indicate that purchasers adapt their countermeasures according to the types of risks they perceive. For instance, many purchasers still pursue a co-operative policy during times of economic boom but only change to aggressive buying behavior when recession afflicts business. Moreover, their openness and search for new suppliers are more important during economic booms. Based on the examined types of perceived risk, sales and marketing managers of B-to-B companies could provide specific information, support and argumentation to purchasing managers in different economic situations, e. g. support them in internal marketing activities during an economic boom or provide them data about internal production planning as well as non-confidential cost analysis. Conversely, during times of recession different information like financial performance compared to competitors might be consciously distributed to purchasers...|$|E

40|$|This article {{adopts a}} {{holistic}} approach to the complex interconnections between <b>economic</b> <b>circumstances,</b> crime and mental health. It reviews some of the criminological and economic literature on unemployment, property crime, health inequality and worker well-being. It stresses the explanatory importance both of adopting a chronological approach to people’s experience of <b>economic</b> <b>circumstances</b> relative to others and of pursuing economic remedies on two levels: individually (investment in mental health treatment and protective strategies) and at a societal level (avoidance of strategies that will increase unemployment etc). Four conclusions are drawn: first, criminologists should strive to enhance links within and across disciplines; second, that injecting resources into protective strategies may be significantly more cost effective than merely punishing individual offenders; third, that the economic and personal consequences of these issues are sufficiently serious to make this task urgent; and finally, that current <b>economic</b> <b>circumstances</b> should make such proposals irresistible...|$|R
