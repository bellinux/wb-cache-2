5|$|One day, Zhou surprises the {{children}} with a written exam and leaves the classroom to speak with a visitor. Wang's son, Wang Gui (王贵), tricks their maid's son, Yue Fei, into completing their assignment while they go outside to play. After easily finishing the task at hand, Yue writes a heroic poem on a whitewashed wall and signs it with his name. The children then burst <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>classroom</b> upon learning of Zhou's forthcoming return and tell Yue to escape {{in order to avoid}} apprehension. The old teacher eventually discovers the ruse and, after marveling at Yue's impromptu ballad, asks Yue to fetch his mother, Lady Yao (姚夫人), for an important meeting. With the entire Wang household assembled in the main hall, Zhou asks the Lady for her blessing to have the boy as his adopted son and student. She consents and Yue takes his seat amongst Zhou's students the following morning. Because Zhou knows Yue is poor, he commands the four students to become sworn brothers. Zhou also begins to teach Yue all of the eighteen weapons of war.|$|E

25|$|Spot strikes {{occurred}} {{throughout the}} state after the August rally. Even though public employee strikes are illegal in Florida, teachers in Pinellas and Broward counties struck in September.

25|$|Zook and {{her mother}} reached the farm, where they asked Amos Smoker to call 911. Roberts and the boys carried lumber, a shotgun, a stun-gun, wires, chains, nails, tools and a small bag. Also brought <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>classroom</b> was a length of wooden board with {{multiple}} sets of metal eye-hooks. The contents of the bag included a change of clothes, toilet paper, candles, and flexible plastic ties. Using wooden boards, Roberts barricaded the front door.|$|E
25|$|Roy {{was born}} in 1995 in New Bedford, Massachusetts. He was {{sometimes}} socially anxious attending school and going <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>classroom.</b> For many years he worked with his father, grandfather, and uncle in his family's marine salvage business, Tucker-Roy Marine Towing and Salvage, Inc. in the New England area. In the Spring of 2014 he earned his captain's license from the Northeast Maritime Institute by completing three months of night classes. In June 2014 he graduated on the Honor Roll (highest grades) from Old Rochester Regional High School (ORR) in Mattapoisett. He was an all-around high school athlete who played baseball, rowed crew, and ran track. He graduated with a 3.88 GPA and had been accepted to Fitchburg State University to study business, {{but at that point}} had decided not to go.|$|E
50|$|Throughout the building, the {{brickwork}} has finely-shaped {{corners and}} the rendered walls have stop-chamfering. Verandahs run {{the length of}} the rear elevations giving access to the rooms and to concrete stairs {{at each end of the}} building. The stairs have decorative iron balustrades and timber handrails. The floors of the circulation areas are polished concrete with a painted margin. The walls are face brick and parts retain original ceilings of sheets and battens in a decorative pattern. The verandah wall retains some original timber, double-hung sash windows with fanlights <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>classrooms.</b> Air conditioning units have been wall-mounted on the verandah wall and penetrations have been made by removing fanlights. Some doors <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>classrooms</b> are original timber double-leaf doors with fanlights.|$|R
50|$|The timber {{verandah}} on {{the east}} side of the building was also built in 1914, and is contemporary with the two eastern doorways <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>classrooms,</b> and <b>the</b> removal of the original galleries from the building interior.

50|$|The early 21st {{century was}} {{characterized}} by the widespread adoption of information technology for everyday use by classroom teachers, students, and parents. One noteworthy process was the phased introduction of Excelsior Software's Electronic Gradebook, Riverdeep software, BrainPOP, TeenBiz and FCAT Explorer. During the 2010s, Edmodo was also phased <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>classrooms</b> of Miami-Dade.|$|R
25|$|Roberts backed {{a pickup}} truck {{up to the front}} of the Amish schoolhouse and entered the school at {{approximately}} 10:25a.m. EDT, shortly after the children had returned from recess. He asked the teacher, Emma Mae Zook, and the students if they had seen a missing clevis pin on the road. Survivors said that Roberts was mumbling his words and was not making direct eye contact. After the occupants of the classroom denied seeing a clevis pin, Roberts walked out to his truck and reappeared in the classroom holding a Springfield XD 9mm handgun. He ordered the boys to help him carry items <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>classroom</b> from the back of his pickup. Zook and her mother, who was visiting the schoolhouse, took this opportunity to escape the school and ran toward a nearby farm to get help. Roberts saw them leave, and ordered one of the boys to stop them, threatening to shoot everyone if the women got away.|$|E

The boys actively try to court Ms. Ellen, but Chef (having beaten them to it) warns them she is a lesbian and thus only likes other lesbians. The boys do not realise what this means and try to become lesbians {{in order to attract}} Ms. Ellen. Meanwhile, Mr. Garrison's nose job makes him a [...] "hot and sexy" [...] man, with his face resembling David Hasselhoff, and he decides to quit teaching to pursue women. Stan wins the dinner (much to Wendy's dismay), but finds out that Ms. Ellen has no intention of making love with him. Wendy however sees them through the window and leaves distraught. The next day, several Iraqi men burst <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>classroom</b> and declare that Ms. Ellen is actually an Iraqi fugitive. As she resists arrest, she inadvertently kills Kenny by impaling him with a sword to his face. The soldiers take her into custody and shoot her {{into the center of the}} Sun via a rocket.|$|E

2500|$|The {{developer}} of the World Wide Web, Tim Berners-Lee, aimed to promote sharing and publishing of information globally. Later his employer {{opened up the}} technology for free use. In the early '90s, the Internet's potential was still untapped, until the mid-1990s when 'critical mass', as termed {{by the head of}} the Advanced Research Project Agency (ARPA), Dr. J.C.R. Licklider, demanded more accessibility and utility. The driving force of this Internet-based collective intelligence is the digitization of information and communication. Henry Jenkins, a key theorist of new media and media convergence draws on the theory that collective intelligence can be attributed to media convergence and participatory culture [...] He criticizes contemporary education for failing to incorporate online trends of collective problem solving <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>classroom,</b> stating [...] "whereas a collective intelligence community encourages ownership of work as a group, schools grade individuals". Jenkins argues that interaction within a knowledge community builds vital skills for young people, and teamwork through collective intelligence communities {{contribute to the development of}} such skills. Collective intelligence is not merely a quantitative contribution of information from all cultures, it is also qualitative.|$|E
