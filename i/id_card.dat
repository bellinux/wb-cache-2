5|$|Further {{research}} has revealed more detail. German records confirmed Specht flew a Fw 190, not a Bf 109, {{and that he}} was a major at the time, confirming Johnson's victim was most likely to have been Engel. Johnson's claim form revealed he had claimed a Bf 109, not an Fw 190. The <b>ID</b> <b>card</b> of Johnson's victim was passed on to a member of the ground crew who spoke German. This individual stated that the rank was given as lieutenant colonel. The incorrect identification was most likely a language error and misunderstanding of German ranks. This may have caused the belief that Johnson had killed Specht. Johnson died in October 1976, and aviation historians were unable to secure his version of events.|$|E

50|$|Still the {{identity}} cards are not 100.0% reliable, since there {{might still be}} people prepared to do false certification.
