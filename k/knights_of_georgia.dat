5000|$|The Association <b>of</b> <b>Georgia</b> Klans, {{also known}} as the Associated Klans <b>of</b> <b>Georgia</b> was a Klan faction {{organized}} by Dr. Samuel Green in 1944, and led by him until his death in 1949. At its height the organization had klaverns in each <b>of</b> <b>Georgia's</b> 159 counties, as well as klaverns in Alabama, Tennessee, South Carolina and Florida. It also had connections with klaverns and kleagles in Ohio and Indiana. After Green death, however, the organization foundered as it split into different factions, was hit with a tax lien and was beset by adverse publicity. It was moribund {{by the time of the}} Supreme Court's [...] "Black Monday" [...] ruling in 1954. A second Association <b>of</b> <b>Georgia</b> Klans was formed when Charles Maddox led dissatisfied members out of the U.S. Klans in 1960.

50|$|Since the {{dissolution}} <b>of</b> the <b>Knights</b> <b>of</b> the Ku Klux Klan, Inc. in 1944, {{there have been}} many Klan groups. Details of the nomenclature have varied, somewhat, among the different groups, but some terms have had more currency than others. Over time, the term klavern replaced klan for local groups. Imperial Wizard and Grand Dragon have still been generally used for the leader of a Klan organization and for state (realm) leaders. Exceptions included cases of one state Klans, such as the Association <b>of</b> <b>Georgia</b> Klans, whose leader Dr. Samuel Green, kept the title Grand Dragon until shortly before his death. The White <b>Knights</b> <b>of</b> the Ku Klux Klan created some innovations in their organization including a bicameral Klongress with an upper house Klonvokation and lower Klanburgess.|$|R

The name of the Order refers to the Sacred Tunic that Jesus Christ wore during His martyrdom. According to tradition, after the relic was raffled off by Roman soldiers, it was taken to Georgia, preserved and buried in the Svetitskhoveli Cathedral, alongside the insignias of King.|$|R
