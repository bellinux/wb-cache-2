30|$|At <b>glomerule</b> level, male flowers open earlier but {{protandry}} {{is incomplete}} {{because when the}} female flowers begin to be receptive, male flowers are still opening in the <b>glomerule.</b>|$|E
30|$|Male flower {{phenology}} was {{studied in}} 2007 by counting {{the number of}} male flowers in each <b>glomerule</b> which marked three different developmental stages of the flower: B) male flower bud differentiated, A) male flower at anthesis liberating pollen, and S) senescent male flowers. As male flower bud differentiation occurs sequentially, and the male flowers fall from the <b>glomerule</b> and disappear after flower senescence, we estimated the average number of male flowers per <b>glomerule</b> by calculating the arithmetic mean for the two weeks when male flowering peaked (7 and 14 August 2007). The average values for different levels of inflorescence were also calculated.|$|E
30|$|In {{this study}} we examine the {{flowering}} phenology pattern of A. halimus in a Mediterranean habitat, determining male and female flower development on three levels (population, plant and <b>glomerule)</b> in order to analyze protandry effectiveness.|$|E
50|$|The {{plants are}} usually dioecious, (rarely monoecious). The male flowers are in <b>glomerules</b> forming {{interrupted}} terminal spike-like panicles. They consist of 4-5 oblong perianth segments and 4-5 stamens. Female flowers are in <b>glomerules</b> {{sitting in the}} leaf axils. Enclosed by 2 accrescent or united bracteoles, without perianth, they consist of an ovary with 4-5 filiform stigmas.|$|R

50|$|Focal {{segmental}} glomerulosclerosis is characterised by a sclerosis of {{segments of}} some <b>glomerules.</b> It {{is likely to}} present as a nephrotic syndrome. This form of glomerulonephritis {{may be associated with}} conditions such as HIV and heroin abuse, or inherited as Alport syndrome. The cause of about 20-30% of focal-segmental glomerulosclerosis is unknown. On microscopy, affected <b>glomerules</b> may show an increase in hyalin, a pink and homogenous material, fat cells, an increase in the mesangial matrix and collagen. Treatment may involve corticosteroids, but up to half of people with focal segmental glomerulonephritis continue to have progressive deterioration of kidney function, ending in kidney failure.|$|R
30|$|Each {{week the}} number of male flower per <b>glomerule</b> at each stage was {{calculated}} with the percentage of plants and glomerules with only male flowers opened, with only female flowers opened, with both types opened, and with no flower opened.|$|E
40|$|Phenotypic {{variation}} of weed beet (stalk and root length, root shape, presence of anthocyanin colouring, number of flowers (achenes) in the <b>glomerule),</b> {{with regard to}} the BBCH phase and the habitat conditions. ANOVA analysis and three categories of traits monitored. Evaluating demonstrable variability in the framework of the traits category and between localities. Demonstrable effect of locality on the presence of anthocyanin colouring was found, however genetic conditionality cannot be ruled out. For the other phenotypic traits no influence was demonstrated. Anthocyanin colouring and root length show significant variability. The most frequent traits are the stem length (100 – 130 cm), the pencil-shaped root and 2 – 3 flowers (achenes) in the <b>glomerule.</b> However, these traits do not necessarily manifest themselves at the same time...|$|E
30|$|The {{start of}} fruit set and ovule {{development}} {{began when the}} stigmas were totally receptive. In 2006 the number of fruits per <b>glomerule</b> {{was significantly higher than}} in 2007, but seeds and bracts were much smaller in the first year. Abbad and Benchaabane (2004) observed that drought could cause a {{reduction in the number of}} female flowers in this species, so yearly variations in the number of fruits per <b>glomerule</b> could be explained by differences in rainfall between these years (Figure  1); the average accumulated rainfall from January to July in the location studied is 255.1  mm, while in 2006 and 2007 this value reached 327.0 and 175.6  mm respectively. This environmental effect has been observed in other species of Atriplex (McArthur 1977; McArthur and Freeman 1982).|$|E
50|$|Spermacoce neoterminalis is a {{perennial}} herb with a woody root. Stems {{are up to}} 40 cm tall, generally not branching above the ground. Leaves are elliptical. Flowers are small, white, clustered in terminal and axillary <b>glomerules.</b>|$|R
50|$|The inflorescences {{consist of}} loose dichasia in the axils of leaf-like bracts, {{sometimes}} of more condensed <b>glomerules</b> of flowers arranged spicately.

40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} {{expression}} of angiopoietin receptor Tie- 2 in the renal tissue of diabetic rats {{and the effects of}} Astragalus. Methods: SD rats were randomly divided into normal control group, diabetes group and Astragalus-treated group. The expression of receptor Tie- 2 in the renal tissue was assessed by using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemical method. Results: <b>Glomerule</b> Tie- 2 protein expression was significantly elevated in the diabetes group as compared with the normal control group (P< 0. 01). <b>Glomerule</b> Tie- 2 protein expression in the Astragalus-treated group was decreased as compared with the diabetes group (P< 0. 01). Conclusion: Tie- 2 may {{play an important role in}} the pathogenesis of the early stage diabetic renal injury. The reno-protection effect of Astragalus may be mediated by down-regulating {{the expression of}} Tie- 2 in the kidney tissue of diabetic rats...|$|E
30|$|At {{population}} level, {{male and}} female flowers seemed {{to open in the}} same weeks, but at plant and <b>glomerule</b> level male flowers opened one week before the females. Fruit predation levels were 62.42 and 43.14 % in 2006 and 2007 respectively, with no significant differences between different parts of the inflorescence. And larvae of Coleophoridae were the most abundant predators.|$|E
30|$|Female flower {{phenology}} {{and fruit}} evolution were studied in 2006 and 2007 by counting {{the number of}} female flowers in each <b>glomerule,</b> which yielded three different developmental stages of the flower: B) female flower bud differentiated, A) female flower at anthesis protruding stigmas from the flower bracts, and F) fruiting female flower, showing prominent bract development. No senescent female flower was recorded as all the flowers observed had initiated fruit development. Once all female flowers are differentiated, and there is no flower drop, we assume that their numbers will remain stable until the onset of flower drop, with possible record variations due to sampling. In order to establish an approximate level of female flowers per <b>glomerule,</b> we considered the week in both years when flowering peaked (28 August 2006 and 18 September 2007) together with the week before and after. The global mean values for different levels of the inflorescence were calculated.|$|E

30|$|Atriplex halimus is a {{monoecious}} scrub {{that produces}} staminate flowers, with a whorl of 5 green sepals and 5 stamens, and female flowers {{with a single}} carpel enclosed within two opposite bracts which develop into dry fruit (achenes) surrounded by 2 valves, giving rise to a fruit structure that disperses as a unit. (Talamali et al. 20012003) studied floral polymorphism in the flowers of this species, observing other types sporadically including hermaphrodite flowers. Male and female flowers are set in glomerules formed by the concrescence of several dichasial cymes deployed along the axis of the branched inflorescence. Female flowers mainly develop in the proximal part and male flowers in the distal part of each <b>glomerule</b> (Talamali et al. 2001), and the sex ratio is affected by day length and light intensity (Talamali et al. 2003).|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} structural changes that occur in the kidney of rats with hyperthyroidism and the effect of melatonin on these changes. The rats were divided into 3 groups; group I was designated as the control, group II was injected daily with 3, 3, 5 -triiodo-L-thyronine (Tg) and group III was injected daily with T 3 +melatonin. After 40 days, tissue specimens of kidney were removed and examined by light and electron microscopy. In the proximal tubule of the Ta injected group, basement membrane thickening, microvillus irregularity and evidence of basal folding were observed. In the <b>glomerule,</b> basal lamina thickening, irregularity of pedicels and somewhere an increase of mesangium were recorded. Moreover, in the melatonin injected group, the findings were similar to the Ts injected group. In conclusion, it was observed that hyperthyroidism caused structural changes in the kidney and melatonin had no important effects on these changes...|$|E
30|$|The Atriplex species {{seems to}} be self-compatible (Heyligers 2001), and A. halimus is {{considered}} to be highly outbreeding (Haddioui and Baaziz 2001; Ferchichi et al. 2006), indicating that this species has effective mechanisms to prevent self-crossing. Protandry had been observed in this species by Abbad and Benchaabane (2004), who established a delay of nearly a month between the appearance of male and female flowers. In our study, we observed that male and female flowers seemed to open in the same weeks at population level (Figure  3), but the highest number of male flowers opened is reached one week before that of the female flowers, and that the upper, middle and lower parts of the inflorescence showed a similar pattern of behaviour (Figure  4). At plant and <b>glomerule</b> level (Figure  5), we see that male flowers opened one week before the females. This is in line with observations by Talamali et al. (2001), because female flowers are distributed along the distal parts of the dichasium and so open later than the males, which are mainly found on the proximal parts.|$|E

40|$|Glomerular {{filtration}} rate (GFR) {{is the best}} indicator of renal function. GFR is usually estimated by serum creatinine or the creatinine clearance calculated on urine collected over 24 hours or with the Cockcroft formula. These methods are however limited. Serum creatinine has a very poor sensitivity and urine collection is difficult. Cystatin C is a protease inhibitor produced in a constant manner by nucleated cells. This molecule is freely filtrated by the <b>glomerule</b> and quite completely catabolized in the proximal tubules. Its plasmatic concentration might thus be used to estimate GFR. Presently available data allow to conclude that plasmatic cystatin C {{is at least as}} good as serum creatinine to estimate GFR. It is less sensible to changes in body mass. Its determination appears more sensitive to detect early mild changes in GFR. Reference values are presently available for the different methods of determination. Cystatin C plasma level determination is more expensive than routine creatinine plasma determination. In the absence of very significant advantages, this might explain its limited use in daily clinical practice. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The {{work has}} been devoted to the {{development}} of the method of the Gaussian self-coordinated field for the description of the state of balance and kinetics of the conformation transitions of the finite copolymer chains in the strong diluted solutions.
