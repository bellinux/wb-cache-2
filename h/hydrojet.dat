40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} the design, development and preliminary {{test of a}} new active microendoscope for neuroendoscopy and therapy of the spinal cord. Endoscopy of the spinal sub-arachnoid space is useful for some pathologies, {{but it is a}} very challenging task for several reasons: the navigation space is very narrow, there are many blood vessels and delicate structures which could be damaged by manoeuvres and large forces and, finally, the Cerebro-Spinal Fluid (CSF) is a peculiar environment which must be preserved. An innovative method for active safe navigation in the sub-arachnoid space has been devised, based on <b>hydrojets</b> sustentation of the endoscope. The <b>hydrojets,</b> if appropriately tuned and oriented, allow the tip of the endoscope to avoid the delicate structures of the spinal cord and could also assist propulsion. A MATLAB simulation of the <b>hydrojets</b> is illustrated and a digital controller for the regulation of the <b>hydrojets</b> is demonstrated. The pressure ripple is about 5 %, as tested experimentally on a 2 D simulator.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{possibility}} of utilizing water jets in flotation has been experimentally proved at the laboratory scale..

With the use of waterjet cell performance always resulted to be considerably better than that achieved with the cell agitated by a conventional impeller. For improving metallurgical results, a new configuration of the flotation cell was designed in which the nozzles were placed at the periphery of the vessel. Flotation tests on coal so far carried out in continuous runs show that the hydrodynamic regime in the cell is further improved and combustible recovery is considerably higher than that achieved with either the previous model of the <b>Hydrojet</b> cell or with the mechanical cell at equal conditions. Finally, a further substantial reduction in specific energy consumption is also obtained. ...|$|E

40|$|A {{large number}} of flows {{encountered}} in nature and in many industrial processes areintrinsically multiphase flows. The efficiency {{and the effectiveness of}} multiphase flow processes strongly depend on the ability to model the fluid flow behaviour. Thus, a robust and accurate description of multiphase flow can lead to an increase in performance, a reduction in cost, and an improvement in safety for engineering systems. In recent years, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) has become an indispensable predictive tool for gathering information to be used for design and optimization for fluid systems. In this thesis the hydrodynamics of two bubbly flow systems, a bubble column and a waterjet-agitated flotation cell (<b>Hydrojet</b> cell), were studied by means of numerical simulations. In order to validate the bubble column CFD simulations Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) was used. An experimental investigation about bubble size distribution (BSD) along a water jet was carried out by means of image analysis. Because of high gas fraction and high velocity of the air/water streams used to agitate the <b>Hydrojet</b> cell, with the available equipment, no experimental measurements could be done to evaluate the velocity field of the cell. The thesis consists of three parts: theoretical part, bubble column study and <b>Hydrojet</b> cell study. In the theoretical part, first, a summary of fluid dynamics principles and an overview of the principal issues related to multiphase flow modelling were presented. Then a brief introduction to PIV and its application to two phase bubbly flow were given. Finally a review of the principle of the flotation process and its modelling were done in order to highlight the reasons for the low recovery of fine particles. Then the potentialities offered by the use of waterjets to fine particles flotation were presented. In the second part experimental and numerical studies of a bubble column were presented. PIV technique was used to determine the velocity field of a laboratory bubble column. A separation method for multiphase PIV was developed and tested. By means of the proposed method, the acquired mixed-fluid images were processed to obtain two sets of single phase images before PIV analysis. The velocity field was determined using a multi-pass crosscorrelation. Following three-dimensional time-dependent CFD simulations of a lab-scale bubble column were presented. The simulations were carried out using the Euler - Euler approach. Two different multiphase turbulence models, Shear Stress Transport (SST) and Large Eddy Simulation (LES), were tested, and different interfacial closure models reported in the literature were examined. When LES were used to model the turbulence instead of the SST model, much better agreement with the experimental data was found, provided that the drag, lift and virtual mass forces were taken into account. In the third part a preliminary experimental study, carried out in a rectangular flat cell, was presented. It was carried out to investigate the size distribution of bubbles generated by a moderate pressure water jet, by means of image analysis. This study showed the ability of water jets at moderate pressure to break an air stream into small bubbles. Increasing the pressure of the pump, smaller and more uniform bubbles were obtained. Then three-dimensional CFD simulations of the <b>Hydrojet</b> cell are presented. The <b>Hydrojet</b> cell, due to the exceeding computational burden, was simulated as a two-phase (gas-liquid) system, although actually it is a three-phase (gas-liquid-solid) system. Also in this case simulations were carried out using the Euler - Euler approach. The turbulence of the liquid phase was modelled with the SST model. The single reference frame technique was used to describe the movement of the waterjet lance. To achieve a homogeneous aeration in the region near the inlets different inlet velocity and rotational speed were tested. The results gave useful indications {{about the role of the}} four principal operating parameters: nozzles diameter, velocity of rotation of the lance, speed of the water jets and then pressure of the pump and inlet air flow rate. What emerges is the need of high rotational speed of the waterjet lance in order to ensure an uniform gas distribution within the mixing zone. This is not possible with the current apparatus. Thus in order to make the system suitable to produce an appropriate environment for the full development of the flotation process it is necessary to modify the system...|$|E

5000|$|Some light tanks {{such as the}} PT-76 are amphibious, {{typically}} being propelled in {{the water}} by <b>hydrojets</b> or by their tracks. In 1969, the U.S. Army rushed the new M551 Sheridan to Vietnam. This 17 ton light tank was built with an aluminium hull, steel turret and gun (although the 152 mm gun was called a [...] "launcher" [...] at the time), and could swim across bodies of water. The M551 upon arrival in Vietnam began replacing the M48A3 Patton in all cavalry squadrons, leaving only the M48A3 in the U.S. Army's three armored battalions in Vietnam, the 1/77th, 1/69th, and the 2/34th Armor. The Sheridan needed no modifications for river crossings, crewmen simply raised the cloth sides that were tucked inside rubber tubes along the hull's upper edges, raised the driver's front shield which had an acrylic glass window, the driver turned on his bilge pumps, shifted his transmission lever to water operations and the Sheridan entered the water. For newly arrived Sheridans, this might work as engineered. For [...] "war weary" [...] M551s, the driver's window was often [...] "yellowed" [...] and/or cracked as to obscure his vision, and the rubber tubes that contained the rolled up side sleeves were often cracked and/or frozen into place. The Sheridan could still cross a body of water, but like its swimming cousin, the M113 APC (Armoured Personnel Carrier, also built of aluminium) the river had to be narrow, less than 100 yd. In all cases, the bilge pumps had to be working properly, and even then {{by the time the}} Sheridan or the APC reached the other side, water would often fill the insides up to their armoured roofs, spilling through the hatches' cracks and emptying onto the earth once safely ashore. Often a fold down trim vane is erected to stop water washing over the bow of the tank and thus reducing the risk of the vehicle being swamped via the driver's hatch.|$|R

40|$|The lifting paddlewheel, (LPW), is a non-buoyant, bladed wheel {{similar to}} the paddlewheels used on riverboats, but is {{arranged}} to produce both propulsive and lift forces. Four suitable LPW's used on a high powered, amphibious vehicle would enable it to drive on land as well as water, where it could lift itself up to drive over the water surface at speed, supported only on its blade tips. Experimental testing tank work with over 40 LPW forms was undertaken, covering force measurements, power measurements and flow visualisation. A wake regime was identified, comprising displacement, transition and planing type wakes, as exhibited by other water craft. A stall-like phenomenon, denoted cavity intrusion, was found to occur when each descending blade begins to encounter the cavity left by the previous blade. A theory was developed to describe the lift and propulsive forces in the relatively simple case of a flat-bladed LPW in the planing condition. These forces were shown to be predominantly impulsive in nature and to occur at blade entry. A semi-empirical scheme, based on the above theory, was developed for designing LPW craft. A 4 kg four-wheel-drive, radio controlled model LPW vehicle successfully demonstrated the LPW concept, and speeds of 32 kph were attained. Practical experience {{with this type of}} craft was gained while using this model as a testbed for over 25 different LPW types. Outline design for a full-sized prototype craft indicated that a performance, in terms of power requirements and speed capability, equalling that of high powered <b>hydrojet</b> boats could be expected.

40|$|Well {{testing is}} widely used today in water wells, oil and gas wells, for {{geothermal}} applications, within civil engineering projects, thermal storage and CO 2 storage. The overall testing goal is to verify the productivity from a well and/or for characterization of hydraulic and thermal properties, {{as well as the}} spatial limitations of an aquifer. There are three major methods for conducting well testing; slug tests, pumping tests and injection tests. The main objective of this thesis is to compare and evaluate the applicability of the three major well testing methods, using experiences gained by active participation in several well testing operations. Testing of shallow and very deep wells as injection tests using a complete tunnel lining are compared and uniquely presented together in the same work. To compare and evaluate the applicability of the three well testing methods, several conditions which govern the selection of hydraulic testing methods are varied and these include, amongst others, the location, depth and diameter of the well. In addition, technical constraints, such as logistics, water handling and external power supply for conducting the testing are also considered. Certain emphasis is also placed on the use and comparison of pneumatic slug testing with other well testing methods, as pneumatic slug testing often complementary to the more expensive and logistically demanding pumping and injection tests. A small diameter slug test equipment was put together for evaluating the applicability of this method and applied in three different geological environments, namely sedimentary deposits, volcanic deposits and the crystalline basement. It was found that knowledge of the applicability of slug tests, pumping tests and injection tests is essential for selecting the most appropriate method. Two of the methods, namely pumping tests and injection tests, are logistically demanding while the third one, slug tests, is easy to execute. Consequently, it is therefore also an inexpensive test method, which is supported by the fact that several tests can be conducted in different wells during the same day. Slug testing using pneumatic initiation has also been demonstrated as a good alternative to pumping tests, obtaining similar transmissivity estimates. An advantage of slug testing is that the transmissivity is estimated from a series of slug tests and not from one single test, which is often the case for pumping or injection tests. Slug testing using pneumatic initiation is often associated with testing in small diameter wells, but in this work it has been shown applicable in large diameter wells at least up to 12 ". A major advantage with pneumatic slug testing compared with the other methods is that it can be used for transmissivity mapping, simplified by the method’s easy logistics. It is a useful approach if the wells are distributed over a large area. It is suggested that slug testing using pneumatic initiation should be used as a preinvestigation method for civil engineering projects. Further work needs to be carried out for explaining the observed non-linear characteristics in data obtained from some of the slug tested wells. It has also been demonstrated that well testing methods are not only restricted to drilled wells. The methods can also be applied inside a tunnel with injection through the tunnel lining. The testing was performed as step injection and constant head/pressure tests and, in conjunction, the response from the testing was measured in observation wells drilled from ground level. Analytical solutions developed for vertical wells could be used to interpret hydraulic properties such as transmissivity, using injection tests performed at tunnel level and the pressure response measured in two of the observation wells. Well development was found to be of great importance for any type of well testing and, for deep wells, a <b>hydrojetting</b> system using coiled tubing and simultaneous pumping was found to be applicable, successful and time efficient...|$|R
