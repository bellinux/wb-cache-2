40|$|Background—Although {{bicycle helmets}} are eVective in {{preventing}} head and brain injury, some helmeted individuals nevertheless sustain head injury. One {{of the possible}} reasons may be poor <b>fit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>helmet</b> on the head. This study was under-taken {{to examine the relationship}} between helmet fit and risk of injury. Methods— 1718 individuals who were hel-meted riders in a crash were queried on helmet fit and position. A sample of 28 children 2 – 14 years of age who sustained a head injury while wearing a bicycle hel-met and 98 helmeted individuals of the same age treated in the same hospital emergency departments for injuries other than to the head, underwent anthropo-metric measurements of helmet fit. Meas-urements were made of the child’s head, the helmet, and on a cast made of the child’s head. Results—Individuals whose helmets were reported to fit poorly had a 1. 96 -fold increased risk of head injury compared with those whose helmets fit well. Chil-dren with head injuries had helmets which were significantly wider than their heads compared with children without head injuries. Helmet fit was poorer among males and among younger children. Conclusions—Poor fit of helmets may be associated with an increased risk of head injury in children, especially in males. Helmets may not be designed to provide optimal protection...|$|E
50|$|Unlike most combat helmets, {{they are}} not one piece, but consist of three {{separate}} plates: two round ones on <b>the</b> sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> head, and one bow-shaped one that sits on top, stretching from the neck to the forehead. These plates are kept together by a padded cover, with drawstring to adjust <b>the</b> size and <b>fit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plates. <b>The</b> <b>helmet</b> may also be camouflaged with a helmet cover which appears in such patterns as VSR and Flora.|$|R
50|$|Whereas <b>the</b> PASGT <b>helmet</b> {{shell is}} olive drab, the LWH is coyote brown {{and can be}} fitted with cloth helmet covers, either {{originally}} made for the PASGT or more commonly those made for the LWH in desert and woodland MARPAT, {{as well as a}} mounting bracket on the front for any sort of night vision device, such as the AN/PVS-7 night vision goggle or AN/PVS-14 monocular night vision device (MNVD). Marines currently can be issued with a sling suspension or a pad suspension to <b>fit</b> <b>the</b> inside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>helmet</b> to <b>the</b> head. A nape protection system adds ballistic protection to <b>the</b> rear <b>of</b> <b>the</b> head was also added as to reduce strain and improve comfort to <b>the</b> back <b>of</b> <b>the</b> neck.|$|R
50|$|Another feature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>helmet</b> {{is that a}} player's uniform number {{appears on}} both {{the front and back}} (the Steelers are one of only two teams in the NFL to do so, with the other team being the New York Giants). Just like the Giants, the Steelers have <b>the</b> two digit <b>helmet</b> numbers located to the left and right <b>of</b> <b>the</b> center stripe on both the front and back <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>helmets.</b> Also just like the Giants, the Steelers have <b>the</b> one digit <b>helmet</b> number located on the center stripe on both the front and back <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>helmets.</b> <b>The</b> numbers {{traditionally}} do not appear on <b>the</b> front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>helmet</b> during <b>the</b> exhibition season, and also do not appear on <b>the</b> front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> throwback <b>helmets.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Kansas State has had {{the same}} design on its {{football}} helmets since 1989: silver with a dark purple Powercat logo on both sides, and a white stripe and purple trim from the front to <b>the</b> rear <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>helmet.</b> On each side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>helmet's</b> stripe is <b>the</b> individual player's number. The word [...] "Wildcats" [...] is also written on <b>the</b> back <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>helmet</b> at <b>the</b> very bottom.

50|$|The site {{shows signs}} of having been {{occupied}} from the Bronze Age through the Iron Age, the Gallo-Roman period and into the Middle Ages.The entrance collapsed and closed the cave in the 13th or 14th century AD.At <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> discovery almost all <b>the</b> parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>helmet</b> had been disturbed by burrowing animals.In 1983, the cheek guard and three fragments <b>of</b> ornamentation from <b>the</b> side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>helmet</b> were discovered during excavations.Other fragments were found in 1986, including <b>the</b> base <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>helmet's</b> crest, several meters from where <b>the</b> <b>helmet</b> had been found.They {{seem to have been}} carried there accidentally, either by people or by badgers.The second cheek guard and <b>the</b> ornamentation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> summit <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>helmet</b> have not been found.|$|R
5000|$|When necessary, a {{night vision}} goggle mount is issued. <b>The</b> mount {{consists}} <b>of</b> a green metal bracket that hooks over <b>the</b> front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>helmet</b> and <b>the</b> mount which is screwed into it. There is a strap that loops through the mount and connects {{to a large}} ring which is usually on <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>helmet</b> and two more straps secure the mount to <b>the</b> back <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>helmet.</b> [...] <b>The</b> mount is compatible with AN/PVS-7 and AN/PVS-14 night vision systems.|$|R
50|$|From being uniformly conical in shape, <b>the</b> skull <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nasal <b>helmet</b> {{became more}} varied during the 12th century. For most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> century nasal <b>helmets</b> with a forward {{deflected}} apex, {{often called the}} 'Phrygian cap' shape, were in widespread use. It is possible that <b>the</b> deflection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> apex <b>of</b> <b>the</b> skull was <b>the</b> natural result <b>of</b> making <b>the</b> front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>helmet</b> thicker than <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>helmet</b> during <b>the</b> process <b>of</b> raising <b>the</b> skull from sheet iron.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> {{main part}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>helmet</b> is {{constructed}} from two sheets of bronze, one forming {{the front and}} one <b>the</b> back <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>helmet,</b> that are riveted together at the sides and top. A separate crescent-shaped bronze piece is riveted to <b>the</b> bottom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> front sheet, and two conical bronze horns with terminal knobs are riveted to <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>helmet.</b> A decorative strip with a row <b>of</b> rivets overlays <b>the</b> join between {{the front and back}} sheets, and goes around <b>the</b> base <b>of</b> <b>the</b> horns. At <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> strip, on both sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>helmet,</b> is a ring fitting for a chin-strap or cheekpiece. There are a number of small holes around the bottom edge, which may have been used to attach a lining.|$|R

50|$|Based on <b>the</b> US Army <b>helmet</b> type M1 used in World War II, the Korean War and Vietnam War, <b>the</b> <b>helmet</b> {{began to}} be used by the Police Reserve after the war and was officially adopted in 1966 after {{improvements}} to the design were carried out.The helmet is a dual structure, the outer shell and <b>the</b> inner <b>helmet</b> liner, <b>the</b> same design as <b>the</b> <b>helmet</b> used by <b>the</b> US military. <b>The</b> appearance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>helmet</b> is also similar to the M1 type, though <b>the</b> shape <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>helmet</b> brim is slightly longer. In addition, as <b>the</b> M1 <b>helmet</b> was designed to <b>fit</b> <b>the</b> head <b>of</b> a typical Anglo-Saxon American, <b>the</b> inner <b>helmet</b> liner was re-designed to remove <b>the</b> problem <b>of</b> instability while being used by a Japanese wearer. Whereas <b>the</b> design <b>of</b> pre-war <b>helmets</b> was to prevent bullet penetration through <b>the</b> hardness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>helmet,</b> <b>the</b> Type 66 high manganese steel helmet is designed to dent utilising <b>the</b> high flexibility <b>of</b> <b>the</b> material. For this reason, rather than wear <b>the</b> <b>helmet</b> directly on <b>the</b> head as with pre-war designs, <b>the</b> <b>helmet</b> is a dual structure, with the shell sitting on top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>helmet</b> liner with a gap between the two layers.The material <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>helmet</b> liner is simple moulded resin. <b>The</b> total weight <b>of</b> <b>the</b> outer shell and helmet liner is 1.4 kilograms. <b>The</b> newer Kevlar <b>helmet</b> Type 88 model was adopted in 1988, however a full update to that model has not yet taken place within the JSDF. The Type 66 is still in use in teaching and with the Self-Defence Force reserve. And too <b>the</b> <b>helmet</b> liners based on those of Type 66 are used widely for non-combat missions.|$|R
