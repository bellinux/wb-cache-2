Most papers, like the daily Magyar Nemzet, or the leading online magazine index.hu, the daily Népszabadság and also revizoronline.hu say, among others, that Jameson CineFest is Hungary’s leading international film festival. ‘Jameson CineFest accomplished something - from a meager budget by European standards - {{in the city of}} steel industry, that is second to none among Hungarian film events’, wrote Gábor Muray in Magyar Nemzet in 2010. According to György Báron’s article published in the leading weekly Élet és Irodalom in 2010, ‘the brilliant film selection at this year’s CineFest was the best of all Hungarian festival line-ups ever’; furthermore the Miskolc film muster was the first among the Hungarian film <b>festivals</b> <b>to</b> have <b>entered</b> the field of the great international festivals. ‘Jameson CineFest needed less than ten years to grow into becoming the most important Hungarian film festival with the best official selection’, wrote László Kolozsi in revizoronline.hu, at the Hungarian National Cultural Fund’s critical site in the very same year. ‘It feels like we were in Cannes… 2011 will be remembered as the year of the turning point {{in the history of the}} festival: it became visible in the map of the great European film festivals’ wrote index.hu in September 2011. ‘Great festival, little money, and all the other clichés… Jameson CineFest is not all about that but about dedicated people who are professionals in bringing out the maximum from the minimum’ says the critic of filmtett.ro in her article with the title ‘A Humane Festival’. She continues: ‘Screening something like the 70-year-old film People on the Alps (Emberek a havason) by István Szőts on a festival is a trendsetting event. István Szöts would be 100 next year and talking about him is the celebration of the Hungarian film… Jameson CineFest is proud to do so, either for the profession or the audience… Touching films, intense competition, great conferences, and all in a human voice: this Miskolc joyride in the autumn sunshine was a true tour de force of films, and no one could desire more - but same time, next year, here again!’ ...|$|R
