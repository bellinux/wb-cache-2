500|$|Miller {{described}} his biggest challenge in writing Rivens music as reconciling the linear, pleasing construction of music with the nonlinearity of the gameplay. As players can freely explore all areas, Miller explained in an interview, [...] "the music can't say anything too specific. If it says something, if it builds in intensity and there starts to be a climax, {{and people are}} <b>just</b> <b>standing</b> in a room looking around, and they're thinking 'What's going on in here? Is something about to jump out from behind me?' You can't have the basic parts of music that you'd like to have, you can't have a basic structure. It's all got to be just flowing, and continue to flow." [...] Allmusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine argued that the soundtrack is [...] "appealingly atmospheric", but [...] "lacks definition", and that the music loses impact when separated from the game.|$|E

I'm walking up to the Plaza , and when I was dressed as Mariah Carey, there were a lot of people <b>just</b> <b>standing</b> there taking pictures, and the street was closed down, and it was a whole rigmarole. It is what it is. So, basically, I went into costume as the stalker, and I told my bodyguard, 'I don't want you to walk with me.' So, a friend of mine was there, and I was like, 'Let's walk together.'" [...] After reports continued to speculate regarding the video's subject, Ratner explained that the main inspiration behind the video was the 1983 film, The King of Comedy. On July 10, 2009, Carey announced through her Twitter account that the video would premiere on the talent competition program, America's Got Talent, which was hosted by Cannon. The full version premiered two days later on 106 & Park. Carey was present at the show and discussed the making of the video.|$|E
500|$|The {{title of}} the album, The Hunting Party, is a contextual metaphor. The album, {{a return to the}} band's {{original}} harder rock-centric sounds, represents the band's desire to not only create something different from other rock bands, but to also bring back the [...] "energy and soul" [...] of rock itself, and that Linkin Park are the party that will hunt for that energy and soul. Shinoda elaborated on the {{title of the}} album in an interview with Kerrang! explaining: [...] "We got so sick of other bands trying to be other bands and playing it safe the whole time, so the album name comes from a theory about culture becoming too passive, everyone <b>just</b> <b>standing</b> around waiting for opportunities to come to them instead of going out and getting theirs. I'm aware there {{are always going to be}} heavier bands than us, but The Hunting Party is Linkin Park going out and getting it for ourselves." [...] The inspiration for the title came from a news article Shinoda read online about a Japanese writer's concerns about today's growing society. The writer described the young men of today as [...] "herbivores", and explained how they are essentially grazing, waiting for an opportunity to come to them, rather than hunting for it.|$|E

500|$|The Beatles {{began their}} third {{nationwide}} tour on 18 May 1963, the bill this time headed by Roy Orbison. Orbison had established even greater UK chart success than either Montez or Roe, with eight previous chart entries of his own—four of them entering the top 10, including the #2 [...] "Dream Baby" [...] and the #1 [...] "Only the Lonely"—and {{was about to}} achieve his next top 10 entry with [...] "Falling", which entered the charts during the tour. However, at the tour's opening show, staged at the Adelphi Cinema, Slough, the American star proved less popular than The Beatles, just as had happened with Roe and Montez throughout the previous nationwide tour. As events unfolded it became obvious this {{was not going to}} change, and a week into the tour the covers of the souvenir programs were reprinted to place The Beatles above Roy Orbison. Despite The Beatles' ascent {{to the top of the}} bill, Starr was impressed with the response Orbison still commanded. Starr recalled, [...] "We would be backstage, listening to the tremendous applause he was getting. He was just doing it by his voice. <b>Just</b> <b>standing</b> there singing, not moving or anything." [...] The third tour had a duration of three weeks, and ended on 9 June 1963.|$|E
500|$|Given {{the task}} of forming the personalities of the Crash Nitro Kart cast through the full-motion videos, the Red Eye Studio artists set certain rules for how each {{character}} would carry itself by default. As animator Thomas Happ noted, [...] "N. Gin, for example, would always default to twitchy, side-to-side glances, while Tiny would often scratch his head in confusion. There {{were a lot of}} scenes where the characters are <b>just</b> <b>standing</b> around listening to Emperor Velo talk, and we had to invent ways to personalize their mannerisms and create a uniquely 'thinking character'." [...] To achieve the bold and deeply saturated colors and textures for the characters and environments, the artists used Maya as well as Adobe Photoshop and Corel Painter. While the artists adapted many of the sets and props in the cinematics from in-game counterparts, they recreated the majority of these objects from scratch in order to add surrealism to the scenery. The cinematics were completed well in advance of the four-month deadline. The console version of Crash Nitro Kart was announced by Vivendi Universal prior to the Electronic Entertainment Expo of 2003, while the N-Gage version was announced on February 16, 2004. Crash Nitro Kart is among the first titles to be developed using the Intrinsic Alchemy middleware technology following Vicarious Visions' purchase of its rights from the defunct Intrinsic Graphics.|$|E
500|$|The game's storyline, themes, graphics, and {{artificial}} intelligence were praised by critics. A reviewer from Game Informer stated {{that despite the}} game did not [...] "hold back" [...] the decadent experience from being an [...] "unhinged flaming rollercoaster ride". A reviewer from the Official Xbox Magazine concluded stated that the game was an accomplished shooter [...] "on the whole", and a fittingly [...] "thunderous" [...] send-off for Resident Evil, while also praising the length and variety of the game. GameTrailers noted the shift away from the style and tone of past games in the series, yet still praised the overall direction, stating that despite the [...] "old identity stripped away", the game presented itself as a [...] "massive" [...] action game. Richard George of IGN was favourable toward the technical and artistic design of the game, stating that the game was among Capcom’s greatest successes with an [...] "incredibly strong" [...] world, lighting, and creature designs. Ryan McCaffrey of IGN also noted the new enemies as [...] "some of the best" [...] designs and concepts {{in the history of}} the franchise. Hollander Cooper of GamesRadar praised the improvements to the controls over its predecessor, stating that the game had an emphasis placed on fluidity and movement, although noted that the cover system [...] "never seems to work right". The Escapist also praised the improved AI companion that [...] "does a decent job of backing you up and taking the fight to the enemy rather than <b>just</b> <b>standing</b> by", however also disliked the cover system, calling it [...] "the most forgettable new feature of the game".|$|E

2500|$|The {{race was}} {{widely viewed as}} neck-and-neck between Fenty and Cropp through the spring of 2006.

Fenty said he would take his uncompromising style to the mayor's office, and cited with approval, Margaret Thatcher's saying that, [...] "Consensus is the absence of leadership". Cropp stressed her 25 years of experience in city government and her desire to continue the progress made by Anthony Williams, who endorsed her candidacy. She also stressed her ability to cooperate with diverse groups and reach consensus. She criticized Fenty's proposed approach to governing; being mayor, saying the mayor's job is [...] "not <b>just</b> <b>standing</b> up and saying, 'This is what I want done,' and miraculously it's going to happen." [...] Both candidates raised significant and nearly equal amounts of money– roughly $1.75 million through June 10, 2006– and neither gained any significant advantages from the numerous candidate debates and forums.|$|E

[...] Underwood also stated she has been planning another tour, which might be toned down from her earlier ones, stating, [...] "I haven't thought about it much because I don't know what the next album {{is going to sound}} like, but I like <b>just</b> <b>standing</b> there and singing, too. I may take a different approach, a more simple approach on the next one. I loved the energy that rock concerts had," [...] Underwood told Billboard.

We never use a zoom," [...] he said. [...] "I don't even carry a zoom lens with me, unless it's for something very specific." [...] The famous coin-tossing scene between Chigurh and the old gas station clerk is a good example; the camera tracks in so slowly that the audience isn't even aware of the move. [...] "When the camera itself moves forward, the audience is moving, too. You're actually getting closer to somebody or something. It has, to me, a much more powerful effect, because it's a three-dimensional move. A zoom is more like a focusing of attention. You're <b>just</b> <b>standing</b> in the same place and concentrating on one smaller element in the frame. Emotionally, that's a very different effect." ...|$|E

2500|$|Although {{the court}} issued a {{unanimous}} opinion in Quirin, {{the road to}} the final decision was marked by disagreement. Justice Douglas wrote that it was unfortunate that the court agreed to take the case. He stated that [...] "while it was easy to agree on the original per curiam, we almost fell apart when it came to write the views." [...] Chief Justice Stone, for his part, was very concerned with the court's reputation, specifically because he did not want the court to be perceived as <b>just</b> <b>standing</b> by while six men were executed. [...] He pushed for a unanimous opinion. [...] Despite Stone's views, Justice Robert H. Jackson wrote a concurring draft opinion, expressing his disagreement with portions of the Court's opinion. [...] Over time, his concurring draft got longer and longer and evolved into a typewritten memorandum. [...] This memorandum was written two years before his dissent in Korematsu v. United States and a decade before his famous concurrence in Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer.

2500|$|Wilson {{received}} the 10-year sentence following {{a refusal to}} enter into a proposed plea bargain, stating his adamant belief that [...] "It's all about doing what's right [...] And what's right is right, and what's wrong is wrong. And I'm <b>just</b> <b>standing</b> up for what I believe in." [...] His decision to reject the plea agreement, as well as his continued fight to overturn his conviction, takes into account that sex offenders in Georgia must register themselves and are subject to penalty laws for life, and that the law was not intended to penalize teenage partners. As the law stands, Wilson would not even be able to return to his own family after an early release, as he has an 8-year-old sister Jiaya Bennett with whom he would be forbidden contact. The other young males involved (including one charged for the same oral sex acts as Wilson) accepted plea bargains with the possibility of parole; they are required to register as convicted sex offenders. Wilson had been offered a plea bargain for a five-year sentence with the possibility of parole before the trial but rejected the offer. After the jury had returned the guilty verdict, the prosecutor offered the same 5-year plea bargain again, and Wilson refused again. Another young man involved in the case had accepted a similar 5-year plea bargain and was paroled after two years.|$|E
2500|$|As [...] "In Dreams" [...] was {{released}} in April 1963, Orbison was asked to replace guitarist Duane Eddy {{on a tour of}} the UK in top billing with the Beatles, whose popularity was on the rise. When he arrived in Britain, however, he saw the amount of advertising devoted to the quartet and realized he was no longer the main draw. He had never heard of them and, annoyed, asked rhetorically, [...] "What's a Beatle anyway?" [...] to which John Lennon replied, after tapping his shoulder, [...] "I am". On the opening night, Orbison opted to go onstage first, although he was the more established act. Known for having raucous shows expressing an extraordinary amount of energy, Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr stood dumbfounded backstage as Orbison performed completely still and simply sang through 14 encores. Finally, when the audience began chanting [...] "We want Roy!" [...] again, Lennon and McCartney prevented Orbison from going on again by physically holding him back. Starr later said, [...] "In Glasgow, we were all backstage listening to the tremendous applause he was getting. He was <b>just</b> <b>standing</b> there, not moving or anything." [...] Through the tour, however, the two acts quickly learned to get along, a process made easier by the fact that the Beatles admired his work. Orbison felt a kinship with Lennon, but it was Harrison with whom he would later form a strong friendship.|$|E
