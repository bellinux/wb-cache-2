Her proficiency with poultry led her to become a staff member at the college from January to April 1913. She later claimed that at the college she was the victim of mental manipulation from her employer, the college warden Lillias Hamilton, resulting in a mental breakdown that made her abandon the institution and return to her parental home.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyze the {{performance}} of the preschool <b>girl</b> <b>with</b> autism in areas of Curriculum. This analysis could help me answer the question, how the <b>girl</b> <b>with</b> autism functions according to the program with adjusted pursuance and extra professional assistance that she is directed to. In order to establish whether the girl was successful or not, she was evaluated by a test which included five exercises for each area of Curriculum. Eleven children were tested and one of them was the <b>girl</b> <b>with</b> autism, named Lara. The results of ten other children were then compared with the results of the <b>girl</b> <b>with</b> autism. According to the results the <b>girl</b> <b>with</b> autism significantly differs from her peers in the areas of language and movement, while no significant differences were noticed in other areas of Curriculum. On the basis of these results we can conclude that the <b>girl</b> <b>with</b> autism was introduced to the appropriate educational program. ...|$|R

5|$|Kazamatsuri is {{the setting}} for a secret war being waged by two main groups: Gaia and Guardian. Gaia, an {{organization}} {{under the auspices of}} the environmental conservation group Martel, is populated by nihilistic and misanthropic people able to contract with familiars, which manifest as constructs fueled by the summoner's life force. Martel itself used to be a church and contains within it a holy maiden group of <b>girls</b> <b>with</b> developmental disabilities. Guardian is dedicated to the destruction of familiars and is composed almost entirely of humans who possess special powers. Gaia and Guardian came to Kazamatsuri in the pursuit of the Earth's familiar named Kagari, who manifests as a young, high school age-looking girl. Kagari, the main heroine of Rewrite, has the power to initiate a period of re-evolution, which restarts the process of evolving another means of intelligent life. However, this is done with the use of the Earth's energy, and by the time the events of Rewrite occur, there is no more energy left to do another re-evolution. Gaia wants to capture Kagari to ensure the destruction of humanity, but Guardian wishes to seek out Kagari to kill her, ensuring that human life continues.|$|E
5|$|Virtually {{all of its}} surfaces, columns, lintels {{and even}} roofs are carved. There are miles of reliefs {{illustrating}} scenes from Indian literature including unicorns, griffins, winged dragons pulling chariots as well as warriors following an elephant-mounted leader and celestial dancing <b>girls</b> <b>with</b> elaborate hair styles. The gallery wall alone is decorated with almost 1,000 square metres of bas reliefs. Holes {{on some of the}} Angkor walls indicate that they may have been decorated with bronze sheets. These were highly prized in ancient times and were a prime target for robbers. While excavating Khajuraho, Alex Evans, a stonemason and sculptor, recreated a stone sculpture under , this took about 60 days to carve. Roger Hopkins and Mark Lehner also conducted experiments to quarry limestone which took 12 quarrymen 22 days to quarry about 400 tons of stone. The labour force to quarry, transport, carve and install so much sandstone must have run into the thousands including many highly skilled artisans. The skills required to carve these sculptures were developed hundreds of years earlier, as demonstrated by some artefacts that have been dated to the seventh century, before the Khmer came to power.|$|E
25|$|Researchers {{found that}} having an older sibling, {{especially}} an older brother, affected how girls viewed sex and sexuality. <b>Girls</b> <b>with</b> older brothers held more traditional views about sexuality {{and said they}} were less interested in seeking sex, as well as less interested responding to the sexual advances of boys compared with <b>girls</b> <b>with</b> no older siblings. Researchers believe this is because older siblings model gender roles, so <b>girls</b> <b>with</b> older siblings (especially brothers) may have more traditional views of what society says girls and boys should be like; <b>girls</b> <b>with</b> older brothers may believe that sexual intercourse is mostly for having children, rather than for gaining sexual pleasure. This traditional view can inhibit them from focusing on their own sexualities and desires, and may keep them constrained to society‚Äôs prescribed gender roles.|$|E
