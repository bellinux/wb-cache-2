5000|$|The Lower Saxon {{water quality}} report [...] of 2004 {{assessed}} the chemical water pollution {{level of the}} Aller overall as moderately polluted (quality level II). Some individual indicators were rated as quality level I (unpolluted to very lightly polluted), some however showed heavy levels of pollution (quality levels III-IV). Heavy pollution is predominantly caused by nitrates. Pollution by ammonium in places is ascribed to the unsatisfactory operation of certain sewage works. Raised phosphate values were put down to intensive arable farming near {{the source of the}} river. Its salt content today is above the critical level for aquatic plants. Since 1990, the salt content has reduced considerably, which may be connected with lower discharges from the former East German area following the Wende in 1989.

50|$|The Imhoff tank, {{named for}} German {{engineer}} Karl Imhoff (1876-1965), is a chamber {{suitable for the}} reception and processing of sewage. It {{may be used for}} the clarification of sewage by simple settling and sedimentation, along with anaerobic digestion of the extracted sludge. It consists of an upper chamber in which sedimentation takes place, from which collected solids slide down inclined bottom slopes to an entrance into a lower chamber in which the sludge is collected and digested. The two chambers are otherwise unconnected, with sewage flowing only through the upper sedimentation chamber and no flow of sewage in the lower digestion chamber. The lower chamber requires separate biogas vents and pipes for the removal of <b>digested</b> <b>sludge,</b> typically after 6-9 months of digestion. The Imhoff tank is in effect a two-story septic tank and retains the septic tank's simplicity while eliminating many of its drawbacks, which largely result from the mixing of fresh sewage and septic sludge in the same chamber.|$|E

Climbazole is classified as very toxic to aquatic organisms. It affects the growth of green algae Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata at very low concentrations. Zebrafish experienced lethal effects after exposure to climbazole in laboratory testing. Effects included thickening of fertilized eggs, lack of somite formation, lack of detachment of the tail bud from the yolk sac, and lack of a heartbeat were evaluated after 48 hours. Along with Danio rerio, Lemna minor, Navicula pelliculosa, Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata, and Daphnia magna were tested and all were found to be negatively affected by climbazole in a concentration-dependant manner with highest toxicity observed in L. minor. Effects included stunted colony growth and darkening in color. Effects of climbazole on oats and turnip included retarded, stunted growth of the leaves and shoot as well as turning darker in color. The aquatic ecotoxicity of climbazole can be classified as very toxic to Lemna and algae, toxic to fish and harmful to Daphnia.|$|E

The rates at which fecal streptococci were destroyed by mesophilic and thermophilic digestion of anaerobic sludges approached those at which the viruses were destroyed by those processes; this suggested that the rates at which fecal streptococci in sludges are destroyed by those processes may serve as useful indicators for the rates at which viruses in sludges are destroyed by those processes...|$|R

Two aerobic incubations, one to follow N mineralization {{and the other one}} to assess CO 2 emissions, were performed during 140 days.

In DSS there was nitrogen net mineralization but only 17 % of the applied carbon was mineralized, showing that anaerobic digestion stabilized the sludge organic matter. Sewage sludge treatment with quicklime reduced its NH 4 + content, but enhanced carbon (40 %) and nitrogen (39. 2 %) mineralization after soil application.

40|$|The {{degradation}} potential of 77 organic chemicals under methanogenic conditions was examined with an anaerobic <b>digesting</b> <b>sludge</b> from the United Kingdom. Degradation was assessed {{in terms of}} net total gas (CH 4 plus CO 2) produced, expressed {{as a percentage of}} the theoretical production (ThGP). The compounds tested were selected from various chemical groups and included substituted phenols and benzoates, pesticides, phthalic acid esters, homocyclic and heterocyclic ring compounds, glycols, and monosubstituted benzenes. The results obtained were in good agreement with published surveys of biodegradability in U. S. <b>digesting</b> <b>sludges</b> and other methanogenic environments. In general, the presence of chloro or nitro groups inhibited anaerobic gas production, while carboxyl and hydroxyl groups facilitated biodegradation. The relationship between substituent position and susceptibility to methanogenic degradation was compound dependent. The following chemicals were completely degraded (≥ 80 % ThGP) at a concentration of 50 mg of carbon per liter: phenol, 2 -aminophenol, 4 -cresol, catechol, sodium benzoate, 4 -aminobenzoic acid, 3 -chlorobenzoic acid, phthalic acid, ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, sodium stearate, and quinoline. 3 -Cresol, 4 -chlorobenzoic acid, dimethyl phthalate, and pyridine were partially degraded. Although the remaining chemicals tested were either persistent or toxic, their behavior may differ at more environmentally realistic chemical-to-biomass ratios. Our findings suggest that biodegradability assessments made with sludge from one source can be extrapolated to sludge from another source with a reasonable degree of confidence and should help in predicting the fate of an organic chemical during the anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge...|$|R

Initially {{sections}} were {{large enough for}} septic tanks to {{work as well as}} they could in peatlands, but it wasn't long before the 1882 drainage scheme was used for sewage connections. By 1904 complaints were being made about the blocked insanitary drain between Victoria and Anglesea Streets, resulting in a faltering start on a night soil service. The 1907 referendum, which approved purchase of the gasworks also agreed to raise a loan for sewage pipes (though rejected a plan for tramways). By 1919 only {{about a third of the}} city had sewers, but between 1923 and 1925 [...] "considerable progress" [...] was made and sewage reticulation was further extended in 1933. However, there was a sewage related epidemic in Melville in 1940 and Melville, Fairfield and Hillcrest were added to the sewer network from 1949. Although by 1956 80% of Hamilton had sewage pipes, it was only piped to 14 septic tanks (17 when replaced in 1976), which were emptied several times a year, either into the Waitawhirwhiri Stream, or directly into the Waikato. In 1956 the Pollution Advisory Council said, [...] "the daily flow of sewage effluent and trade wastes from Hamilton City is three million gallons… in effect, partly <b>digested</b> <b>sludge</b> and raw sewage is being disposed of into the Waikato River". Downstream from Hamilton contaminants increased 10 times between the 1950s and the early 1970s. The 1953 Water Pollution Act set up a Pollution Advisory Council, but it had no control powers until 1963.In 1964 the Department of Health ordered adequate treatment for the sewage. Steven and Fitzmaurice, Consulting Engineers, presented a plan to Council early in 1966. There was some work on piping new areas in 1966, but work on the major trunks and interceptors didn't start until 1969 and building at Pukete sewage works started in January 1972. The first sewage was treated in July 1975 and was fully connected early in 1977.The trunk lines needed a 165 m bridge, about 14 m above the Waikato, another prestressed concrete box girder bridge over Kirikiriroa Stream at Tauhara Gully and 2 steel pipe bridges over other gullies. The River bridge was designed by Murray-North Partners and the others by council engineers.|$|E

Sludge mixtures exhibited non-Newtonian, shear thinning, yield stress behaviour. The apparent viscosity and yield stress of sludge mixtures prepared at the same total solids concentration was influenced by the interactions within the <b>digested</b> <b>sludge</b> and increased with the volume fraction of <b>digested</b> <b>sludge</b> - highlighted using shear compliance and shear modulus of sludge mixtures. However, when a thickened primary - secondary sludge mixture was mixed with dilute <b>digested</b> <b>sludge,</b> the apparent viscosity and yield stress decreased with increasing the volume fraction of <b>digested</b> <b>sludge.</b> This was caused by the dilution effect leading to a reduction in the hydrodynamic and non-hydrodynamic interactions when dilute <b>digested</b> <b>sludge</b> was added.

40|$|Abstract: The {{paper will}} {{report about the}} {{experiences}} matured at an Austrian large wastewater treatment plant of 720. 000 population equivalents, where anaerobically digested sewage sludge is further stabilised under aerobic conditions. Enhanced stabilisation of the anaerobically <b>digested</b> <b>sludge</b> was required at the plant {{in order to get}} a permit for landfill disposal of the dewatered stabilized sludge. By implementing a post-aeration treatment (SRT~ 6 d; 36 °C) after anaerobic digestion the organic content of the anaerobically well <b>digested</b> <b>sludge</b> can be decreased by 16 %. Investigations on site showed that during <b>digested</b> <b>sludge</b> post-aeration anoxic phases for denitrification are needed to provide stable process conditions. In this way the pH value can be kept in a more favourable range for micro-organisms and concrete structures. Additionally, inhibition of the biological process due to nitrite accumulation can be avoided. By optimising the aeration/pause ratio ~ 45 % of total nitrogen in <b>digested</b> <b>sludge</b> can be removed. This significantly improves nitrogen removal efficiency at the wastewater treatment plant. NH 4 -removal occurs mainly through nitritation and denitritation with an efficiency of 98 %.

The disposal of sludge in Netherlands is costly (500 EUR/ton wet solids), and therefore reduction techniques of <b>digested</b> <b>sludge</b> are {{of great interest to}} improve the costs of wastewater treatment. First part of this study focused on one of the biological approaches to reduce the excess sludge that can be achieved by aquatic worms in short period of time. Worms are efficient degraders to extra mineralization of sludge into biomass, water and CO 2. In optimal condition the total biomass production is low. The investigation on worm predation shows high concentration of ammonia in sludge is toxic and it inhibits the growth of worms, so flocculation was done to separate ammonia from solid. The hypothesis is that flocculated <b>digested</b> <b>sludge</b> (FDS) can be degraded by aquatic worms. In this study, we evaluated the degradation rate, temperature effect, ammonia concentration and worm growth rate. The obtained results from worm experiment showed, in long test (12 days), with the worm biomass of (21. 2 g/ww), the degradation of sludge in worm reactor is (15. 75 %), while it is (6. 65 %) in aerated reactor.

Spontaneous precipitation of calcium phosphate minerals in the <b>digested</b> <b>sludge</b> centrate {{was achieved by}} the sustained concentrative action of the FO process and the gradual pH increase due to the diffusion of protons to the draw solution.

Reusing sludge for energy production (biogas production) through the anaerobic digestion of sludge can provide a sustainable solution. However, for the optimum performance of digesters with minimal use of energy input, operating conditions must be regulated in accordance with the rheological characteristics of the sludge. If it is assumed that only secondary sludge enters the anaerobic digesters, an impact of variations to the solids concentration and volume fraction of each sludge type must be investigated to understand how the apparent viscosity and yield stress of the secondary and <b>digested</b> <b>sludge</b> mixture inside the digesters changes. In this study, five different total solids concentration of secondary and <b>digested</b> <b>sludge</b> were mixed at different <b>digested</b> <b>sludge</b> volume fractions ranging from 0 to 1. It was found that if secondary sludge was mixed with <b>digested</b> <b>sludge</b> at the same total solids concentration, the apparent viscosity and the yield stress of the mixture increased exponentially by increasing the volume fraction of <b>digested</b> <b>sludge.</b> However, if secondary sludge was added to <b>digested</b> <b>sludge</b> with a different solids concentration, the apparent viscosity and yield stress of the resulting mixed sludge was controlled by the concentrated sludge regardless of its type. Semi e empirical correlations were proposed to predict the apparent viscosity and yield stress of the mixed digested and secondary sludge. A master curve was also developed to predict the flow behaviour of sludge mixtures regardless of the total solid concentration and volume fraction of each sludge type within the studied solids concentration range of 1. 4 and 7 %TS. This model can be used for digesters optimization and design by predicting the rheology of sludge mixture inside digester...|$|E
40|$|A {{method of}} {{labelling}} <b>digested</b> sewage <b>sludge</b> with iodine 131 was investigated for the South Australian Engineering and Water Supply Department, who {{are investigating the}} the possibility of disposing of sewage into the ocean, and hence are interested in tracing {{the movement of the}} sludge in the sea, in order to determine whether pollution of neighbouring beaches would occur. Satisfactory labelling of both solid and liquid phases was achieved...|$|R
40|$|The {{disposal}} of anaerobically <b>digested</b> sewage <b>sludge</b> onto farmland in Pima county {{has created the}} need to evaluate the potential public health impact of pathogens which are indigenous to sewage and may be present in sludge. The occurrence of enteroviruses and Giardia cysts in sewage sludge before and after anaerobic digestion was monitored {{for a period of}} 14 months. This study showed that significant concentrations of enteroviruses and Giardia cysts are present in anaerobically <b>digested</b> sewage <b>sludge</b> being applied to farmland in Pima County. The concentration of Giardia cysts ranged from 1. 33 x 103 to 8. 6 x 104 per liter of raw sludge and 2. 0 x 103 to 2. 8 x 104 per liter of treated sludge. The concentration of enteroviruses in sludge ranged from 1. 74 x 102 to 1. 28 x 104 per liter before anaerobic digestion and from 99. 95 %. Methods to study the fate of enteroviruses in the sludge-soil matrix were also evaluated. An increase in the ratio of eluant to solids seemed to enhance virus recoveries from sludge:soil mixtures...|$|R
50|$|Mesophilic {{anaerobic}} digestion (MAD) {{is also a}} common method for treating sludge produced at sewage treatment plants. The sludge is fed into large tanks and held {{for a minimum of}} 12 days to allow the digestion process to perform the four stages necessary to <b>digest</b> the <b>sludge.</b> These are hydrolysis, acidogenesis, acetogenesis, and methanogenesis. In this process the complex proteins and sugars are broken down to form more simple compounds such as water, carbon dioxide, and methane.|$|R
