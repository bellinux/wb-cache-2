5|$|Although the {{manufacture}} of artificial plant <b>ice</b> was still negligible in 1880, it began to grow in volume {{towards the end of}} the century as technological improvements finally allowed the production of plant <b>ice</b> at a competitive price. Typically <b>ice</b> plants first took hold in more distant locations where natural <b>ice</b> was at a cost disadvantage. The Australian and Indian markets were already dominated by plant <b>ice,</b> and <b>ice</b> plants began to be built in Brazil during the 1880s and 1890s, slowly coming to replace imported <b>ice.</b> In the U.S., plants began to become more numerous in the southern states. The long distance transportation companies continued to use cheap natural <b>ice</b> for the bulk of their refrigeration needs, but they now used purchased local plant <b>ice</b> at key points across the US, to allow for surge demand and to avoid the need to hold reserve stocks of natural <b>ice.</b> After 1898 the British fishing industry too began to turn to plant <b>ice</b> to refrigerate its catches.|$|E
5|$|Altrincham {{is one of}} the few {{towns in}} North West England with an <b>ice</b> rink, and has had an <b>ice</b> hockey team since 1961, when Altrincham <b>Ice</b> Rink was built in Broadheath. The Altrincham Aces (later renamed the Trafford Metros) played from 1961 until 2003, when Altrincham <b>Ice</b> Rink closed. The town then had a three-year period without a rink or <b>ice</b> hockey team, until {{construction}} of the 2,500 capacity Altrincham <b>Ice</b> Dome was completed. Manchester Phoenix, a club having a professional presence in the English Premier <b>Ice</b> Hockey League and an extensive junior development aspect, relocated to the <b>Ice</b> Dome during the 2006–07 season, having withdrawn from competition two years earlier due to the high cost of playing matches at Manchester's MEN Arena. In 2009 the Manchester Phoenix English National <b>Ice</b> Hockey League team was renamed Trafford Metros, bringing the old Altrincham team's name back into use. When not being used by Phoenix the Altrincham <b>Ice</b> Dome is open to the public for <b>ice</b> skating.|$|E
5|$|Antarctica is {{intensely}} {{cold and}} arid. Most of the world's freshwater <b>ice</b> is contained within its sheets.

5|$|At {{its peak}} {{at the end}} of the 19th century, the U.S. <b>ice</b> trade {{employed}} an estimated 90,000 people in an industry capitalised at $28 million ($660 million in 2010 terms), using <b>ice</b> houses capable of storing up to 250,000 tons (220 million kg) each; Norway exported a million tons (910 million kg) of <b>ice</b> a year, drawing on a network of artificial lakes. Competition had slowly been growing, however, in the form of artificially produced plant <b>ice</b> and mechanically chilled facilities. Unreliable and expensive at first, plant <b>ice</b> began to successfully compete with natural <b>ice</b> in Australia and India during the 1850s and 1870s respectively, until, by the outbreak of World War I in 1914, more plant <b>ice</b> was being produced in the U.S. each year than naturally harvested <b>ice.</b> Despite a temporary increase in production in the U.S. during the war, the inter-war years saw the total collapse of the <b>ice</b> trade around the world. Today, <b>ice</b> is occasionally harvested for <b>ice</b> carving and <b>ice</b> festivals, but little remains of the 19th-century industrial network of <b>ice</b> houses and transport facilities.|$|E
5|$|<b>Ice</b> {{houses were}} also {{built in the}} major <b>ice</b> {{consuming}} cities to hold the imported <b>ice</b> before final sale and consumption, where they were often termed depots. In London, the early <b>ice</b> depots were often circular and called wells or shades; the New Cattle Market depot built in 1871 was 42 feet (13 m) wide and 72 feet (22 m) deep, able to hold 3,000 short tons (three million kg) of <b>ice.</b> Later <b>ice</b> depots at Shadwell and Kings Cross in London were larger still, and, along with incoming barges, were used for storing Norwegian <b>ice.</b> The city of New York was unusual and did not build <b>ice</b> depots near the ports, instead using the incoming barges and, on occasion, ships that were delivering the <b>ice</b> as floating warehouses until the <b>ice</b> was needed.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to this increasing competition, natural <b>ice</b> companies examined various options. Some invested in plant <b>ice</b> themselves. New tools were brought in {{to speed up the}} harvesting of <b>ice,</b> but these efficiency improvements were outstripped by technical advances in plant <b>ice</b> manufacture. The Natural <b>Ice</b> Association of America was formed to promote the benefits of natural <b>ice,</b> and companies played on the erroneous belief amongst customers that natural <b>ice</b> melted less slowly than manufactured <b>ice.</b> Under pressure, some <b>ice</b> companies attempted to exploit their local monopolies on <b>ice</b> distribution networks to artificially raise prices for urban customers. One of the most prominent cases of this involved Charles Morse and his American <b>Ice</b> Company, which suddenly almost tripled wholesale and doubled the retail prices in New York in 1900 {{in the midst of a}} heat wave; this created a scandal that caused Morse to sell up his assets in the <b>ice</b> trade altogether to escape prosecution, making a profit of $12 million ($320 million) in the process.|$|E

5|$|Melting of {{floating}} <b>ice</b> shelves (<b>ice</b> that originated on the land) {{does not in}} itself contribute much to sea-level rise (since the <b>ice</b> displaces only its own mass of water). However it is the outflow of the <b>ice</b> from the land to form the <b>ice</b> shelf which causes a rise in global sea level. This effect is offset by snow falling back onto the continent. Recent decades have witnessed several dramatic collapses of large <b>ice</b> shelves around the coast of Antarctica, especially along the Antarctic Peninsula. Concerns have been raised that disruption of <b>ice</b> shelves may result in increased glacial outflow from the continental <b>ice</b> mass.|$|E

5|$|The {{large scale}} {{production}} of <b>ice</b> cream also {{resulted from the}} <b>ice</b> trade. <b>Ice</b> cream had been produced in small quantities {{since at least the}} 17th century, but this depended both on having large quantities of <b>ice</b> available, and substantial amounts of labour to manufacture it. This was because using <b>ice</b> to freeze <b>ice</b> cream relies both on the application of salt to an <b>ice</b> mixture to produce a cooling effect, and also on constantly agitating the mixture to produce the light texture associated with <b>ice</b> cream. By the 1820s and 1830s, the availability of <b>ice</b> in the cities of the U.S. east coast meant that <b>ice</b> cream was becoming increasingly popular, but still an essentially luxury product. In 1843, however, a new <b>ice</b> cream maker was patented by Nancy Johnson which required far less physical effort and time; similar designs were also produced in England and France. Combined with the growing <b>ice</b> trade, <b>ice</b> cream became much more widely available and consumed in greater quantities. In Britain, Norwegian <b>ice</b> was used by the growing Italian community in London from the 1850s onwards to popularise <b>ice</b> cream with the general public.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a Neural Network (NN) identification of <b>icing</b> parameters in an A 340 aircraft and a reconfiguration technique {{to keep the}} A/C performance close to the performance prior to <b>icing.</b> Five aircraft parameters {{are assumed to be}} considerably affected by <b>icing.</b> The off-line training for identifying the clear and <b>iced</b> dynamics is based on the Levenberg-Marquard Backpropagation algorithm. The <b>icing</b> parameters are located in the system matrix. The physical locations of the <b>icing</b> are assumed at the right and left wings. The reconfiguration is based on the technique known as the control mixer approach or pseudo inverse technique. This technique generates the new control input vector such that the A/C dynamics is not much affected by <b>icing.</b> In the simulations, the longitudinal and lateral dynamics of an Airbus A 340 aircraft model are considered, and the stability derivatives affected by <b>icing</b> are identified. The simulation results show the successful NN identification of the <b>icing</b> parameters and the reconfigured flight dynamics having the similar performance before the <b>icing.</b> In other words, the destabilizing <b>icing</b> affect is compensated...|$|R
5|$|The {{trend toward}} {{artificial}} <b>ice</b> was hastened by the regular <b>ice</b> famines during the period, {{such as the}} 1898 British famine, which typically caused rapid price increases, fuelled demand for plant <b>ice</b> and encouraged investment in the new technologies. Concerns also grew over the safety of natural <b>ice.</b> Initial reports concerning <b>ice</b> being produced from polluted or unclean lakes and rivers had first emerged in the U.S. {{as early as the}} 1870s. The British public health authorities believed Norwegian <b>ice</b> was generally much purer and safer than American sourced <b>ice,</b> but reports in 1904 noted the risk of contamination in transit and recommended moving to the use of plant <b>ice.</b> In 1907, New York specialists claimed <b>ice</b> from the Hudson River to be unsafe for consumption and potentially containing typhoid germs; the report was successfully challenged by the natural <b>ice</b> industry, but public opinion was turning against natural <b>ice</b> on safety grounds. These fears of contamination was often played on by artificial <b>ice</b> manufacturers in their advertising. Major damage was also done to the industry by fire, including a famous blaze at the American <b>Ice</b> Company facilities at Iceoboro in 1910, which destroyed the buildings and the adjacent schooners, causing around $130,000 ($2,300,000 in 2010 terms) of damage and crippling the Maine <b>ice</b> industry.|$|E
5|$|A polar <b>ice</b> cap, or polar <b>ice</b> sheet, is a high-latitude {{region of}} a planet or moon that is covered in <b>ice.</b> <b>Ice</b> caps form because high-latitude regions receive less energy as solar {{radiation}} from the sun than equatorial regions, resulting in lower surface temperatures.|$|E
5|$|A similar {{suggestion}} {{holds the}} 21,636-year precession cycles solely responsible. <b>Ice</b> ages {{are characterized by}} the slow buildup of <b>ice</b> volume, followed by relatively swift melting phases.

40|$|<b>Icing</b> on {{structures}} is {{an important}} issue for wind energy developments in many regions of the world. Unfortunately, information about <b>icing</b> conditions is mostly rare {{due to a lack of}} measurements. Additionally, there is not much known about the operation of wind turbines in <b>icing</b> conditions. It is the aim of the current study to investigate the effect of <b>icing</b> on power production and to evaluate the potential of <b>icing</b> forecasts to help optimizing wind turbine operation. A test site with two Enercon E- 82 turbines was set up in the Jura region in Switzerland in order to study the turbines' behaviour in <b>icing</b> conditions. <b>Icing</b> forecasts were performed by using an accretion model driven by results of the mesoscale weather forecast model WRF. The <b>icing</b> frequency at the test site is determined from pictures of a camera looking at the measurement sensors on the nacelle. The results show that the site is affected by frequent icing: 11. 5 days/year of meteorological <b>icing</b> and 41. 5 days/year of instrumental <b>icing</b> were observed corresponding to a factor of about four. The comparison of power production with and without blade heating shows that blade heating results in a 3. 5 % loss and operation without blade heating results in a 10 % loss of the annual power production due to <b>icing.</b> <b>Icing</b> forecasts are performed for winter 2009 / 2010. Simulated and observed <b>icing</b> events agree well and also coincide with periods of power drop. Thus, the results suggest that <b>icing</b> forecasts can help to optimize the operation of wind parks in <b>icing</b> conditions...|$|R

5|$|Ariel is {{the fourth}} largest of the Uranian moons, and may have the third {{greatest}} mass. The moon's density is 1.66g/cm3, which indicates that it consists of roughly equal parts water <b>ice</b> and a dense non-ice component. The latter could consist of rock and carbonaceous material including heavy organic compounds known as tholins. The presence of water <b>ice</b> is supported by infrared spectroscopic observations, which have revealed crystalline water <b>ice</b> {{on the surface of}} the moon. Water <b>ice</b> absorption bands are stronger on Ariel's leading hemisphere than on its trailing hemisphere. The cause of this asymmetry is not known, but it may be related to bombardment by charged particles from Uranus's magnetosphere, which is stronger on the trailing hemisphere (due to the plasma's co-rotation). The energetic particles tend to sputter water <b>ice,</b> decompose methane trapped in <b>ice</b> as clathrate hydrate and darken other organics, leaving a dark, carbon-rich residue behind.|$|E
