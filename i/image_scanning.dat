Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University combined <b>image</b> <b>scanning,</b> cloud computing and public profiles from social network sites to identify individuals in the offline world. Data captured even included a user's social security number. Experts have warned of the privacy risks faced by the increased merging of our online and offline identities. The researchers have also developed an 'augmented reality' mobile app that can display personal data over a person's image captured on a smartphone screen. Since these technologies are widely available, our future identities may become exposed to anyone with a smartphone and an Internet connection. Researchers believe this could force us to reconsider our future attitudes to privacy.|$|E

In this category, one might include the laser printers, barcode readers, <b>image</b> <b>scanning,</b> illuminators, designators, optical data recording, combustion ignition, laser surgery, industrial sorting, industrial machining, and directed energy weaponry.

2500|$|Microprinting is the {{production}} of recognizable patterns or characters in a printed medium at a scale that requires magnification to read with the naked eye. [...] To the unaided eye, the text may appear as a solid line. Attempts to reproduce by methods of photocopy, <b>image</b> <b>scanning,</b> or pantograph typically translate as a dotted or solid line, unless the reproduction method can identify and recreate patterns to such scale. [...] Microprint is predominantly used as an anti-counterfeiting technique, due to its inability to be easily reproduced by digital methods.|$|E

2500|$|In 1881, English {{inventor}} Shelford Bidwell {{constructed the}} scanning phototelegraph {{that was the}} first telefax machine to scan any two-dimensional original, not requiring manual plotting or drawing. Around 1900, German physicist Arthur Korn invented the [...] widespread in continental Europe especially since a widely noticed transmission of a wanted-person photograph from Paris to London in 1908 used until the wider distribution of the radiofax.

2500|$|Experiments in {{television}} systems using radio broadcasts {{date to the}} 19th century, {{but it was not}} until the 20th century that advances in electronics and light detectors made development practical. A key problem was the need to convert a 2D image into a [...] "1D" [...] radio signal; some form of <b>image</b> <b>scanning</b> was needed to make this work. Early systems generally used a device known as a [...] "Nipkow disk", which was a spinning disk with a series of holes punched in it that caused a spot to scan across and down the image. A single photodetector behind the disk captured the image brightness at any given spot, which was converted into a radio signal and broadcast. A similar disk was used at the receiver side, with a light source behind the disk instead of a detector.|$|E
2500|$|A {{few months}} after {{arriving}} in California, Farnsworth was prepared to show his models and drawings to a patent attorney who was nationally recognized as an authority on electrophysics. Everson and Gorrell agreed that Farnsworth should apply for patents for his designs, a decision which proved crucial in later disputes with RCA. Most television systems in use at the time used <b>image</b> <b>scanning</b> devices ("rasterizers") employing rotating [...] "Nipkow disks" [...] comprising lenses arranged in spiral patterns such that they swept across an image in a succession of short arcs while focusing the light they captured on photosensitive elements, thus producing a varying electrical signal corresponding to the variations in light intensity. Farnsworth recognized {{the limitations of the}} mechanical systems, and that an all-electronic scanning system could produce a superior image for transmission to a receiving device.|$|E
