40|$|A team {{composed}} of scientists from Michigan State University (MSU) and Michigan Technological University (MTU) assembled to better understand, document, and improve systems for using forest-based biomass feedstocks {{in the production}} of energy products within Michigan. Work was funded by a grant (DE-EE- 0000280) from the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) and was administered by the Michigan Economic Development Corporation (MEDC). The goal of the project was to improve the <b>forest</b> <b>feedstock</b> supply infrastructure to sustainably provide woody biomass for biofuel production in Michigan over the long-term. Work was divided into four broad areas with associated objectives: • TASK A: Develop a Forest-Based Biomass Assessment for Michigan – Define forest-based feedstock inventory, availability, and the potential of forest-based feedstock to support state and federal renewable energy goals while maintaining current uses. • TASK B: Improve Harvesting, Processing and Transportation Systems – Identify and develop cost, energy, and carbon efficient harvesting, processing and transportation systems. • TASK C: Improve <b>Forest</b> <b>Feedstock</b> Productivity and Sustainability – Identify and develop sustainable feedstock production systems through the establishment and monitoring of a statewide network of field trials in forests and energy plantations. • TASK D: Engage Stakeholders – Increase understanding of forest biomass production systems for biofuels by a broad range of stakeholders. The goal and objectives of this research and development project were fulfilled with key model deliverables including: 1) The Forest Biomass Inventory System (Sub-task A 1) of feedstock inventory and availability and, 2) The Supply Chain Model (Sub-task B 2). Both models are vital to Michigan’s forest biomass industry and support forecasting delivered cost, as well as carbon and energy balance. All of these elements are important to facilitate investor, operational and policy decisions. All other sub-tasks supported the development of these two tools either directly or by building out supporting information in the forest biomass supply chain. Outreach efforts have, and are continuing to get these user friendly models and information to decision makers to support biomass feedstock supply chain decisions across the areas of biomass inventory and availability, procurement, harvest, forwarding, transportation and processing.

40|$|The {{world is}} {{shifting}} to an innovation economy and forest biotechnology {{can play a}} major role in the bio-economy by providing farmers, producers, and consumers with tools that can better advance this transition. First-generation or conventional biofuels are primarily produced from food crops and are therefore limited in their ability to meet challenges for petroleum-product substitution and climate change mitigation, and to overcome the food-versus-fuel dilemma. In the longer term, forest lignocellulosic biomass will provide a unique renewable resource for large-scale production of bioenergy, biofuels and bio-products. These second-generation or advanced biofuels and bio-products have also the potential to avoid many of the issues facing the first-generation biofuels, particularly the competition concerning land and water used for food production. To expand the range of natural biological resources the rapidly evolving tools of biotechnology can ameliorate the conversion process, lower the conversion costs and also enhance target yield of <b>forest</b> biomass <b>feedstock</b> and the product of interest.

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2013 Residual-based {{biofuels}} potentially {{provide a}} renewable and technically feasible route of mitigating {{negative effects of}} climate change. Washington State is uniquely placed to develop biofuels given its abundance of woody biomass as <b>feedstock.</b> <b>Forest</b> residuals provide an excellent use of otherwise overly abundant forest fire hazards, and {{have the potential for}} economic profitability. However, ecological and economic arguments present only one side of the story. Others significantly oppose use of <b>forest</b> residuals as <b>feedstock</b> for bioenergy production. Use of forest residuals for biofuel production is therefore a socially contested phenomena within Washington State. It is important to understand the underpinnings of this contention in order to pinpoint and mitigate it to increase cooperation between decision-makers and stakeholders and overall social acceptability. My objective for this study was to understand stakeholder attitudes to illuminate points of contention and attitude change and suggest ways in which decision and policy makers can utilize these to promote more favorable attitudes towards residual based biofuels. Favorable attitudes are critical in reducing opposition and conflict between decision- and policy-makers and stakeholders to increase social acceptability. Results can be used to inform decision- and policy-making of stakeholder perceived benefits, constraints, and suggested solutions. I conducted key-stakeholder and focus group interviews that focused on the attitudes and perceptions informing expressed attitudes about using <b>forest</b> residuals as <b>feedstock</b> for biofuels production. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using deductive and inductive qualitative methods and NVivo software. Interviewees from Native American, political, government, and industry stakeholder groups held positive attitudes towards <b>forest</b> residuals as <b>feedstock</b> for biofuels, while nongovernment organizations and community members had mixed perspectives. Perceived benefits and constraints primarily focused on economic and ecological sustainability, with extensive deliberation and repeated occurrences in all interviews.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{a model of}} price determination to analyze the impacts of increased biofuel production on <b>forest</b> <b>feedstocks</b> markets in Sweden. The model {{is based on a}} spatially-explicit, demand-supply framework. Data on forest biomass supply and harvest cost at the gridcell level is available for Sweden for 334 0. 5 x 0. 5 degree gridcells. We use the data to construct supply curves, both at the national level and sub-national level. The supply and harvest cost data is available for four forest commodities: branch & tops, pulpwood, sawlogs and stumps. The latter are further distinguished {{depending on the type of}} harvest operation: thinning or final felling. On the demand side, the model is calibrated using data on current demand for each feedstock at gridcell level. Demand scenarios for different biofuel targets are generated from the BeWhere-Sweden model at the gridcell level, which allow us to investigate the potential impacts on market price as approximated by the harvest cost data. We run simulation scenarios for increased biofuel production from forest biomass for Sweden: a 10 and 20 terawatt hour (TWh) of biofuel by 2030. As expected, the results show that increased demand pressure on the forest biomass will tend to push prices up. The magnitudes of change are highest for pulpwood and branches & tops from final felling, where they reach 0. 004 % to 18. 95 % and 0. 001 % to 7. 2 % respectively.

40|$|Summary. Biomass from {{sustainably}} managed forests {{can contribute}} to the energy profile of the United States by providing a homegrown and renewable energy source that off-sets fossil fuel use, reducing overall carbon emissions. <b>Forest</b> bioenergy <b>feedstocks</b> production and harvesting systems range from small-scale fuelwood gathering to large-scale industrial plantations and removals of virtually all above-and-below ground biomass from intensively managed forests. Across this wide range of options for production and extraction, there is an equally wide range of potential impacts. It is therefore critical that forest biomass procurement systems do not adversely impact forests or the environment; therefore, effective standards and planning tools, based on the best available scientific knowledge, must be in place prevent these impacts being realized, and hence ensure a sustainable industry. Sustainable forest management (SFM) certification schemes are one mechanism for applying measurable environmental standards (in the form of criteria and indicators, or C&I) to forest management systems. We will examine how existing SFM certification schemes and frameworks, such as C&I and Adaptive Forest Management, can be used to help guide sustainable biomass operations.

40|$|This paper investigates three {{important}} energy and climate policy issues: (1) {{the availability of}} biomass for electricity generation (i. e., supply), (2) climate policy effects on this supply, and (3) the net greenhouse gas reduction when biomass is used for electricity generation. Using a detailed model of U. S. agriculture and forestry markets and land-use, that includes a broad and diverse set of biomass feedstocks, we evaluate competing potential sub-national and feedstock specific supplies of biomass for U. S. electricity generation. Our preliminary results suggest significant supply, with residues dominating at lower delivered energy prices, and dedicated crops significant at higher prices. Sub-national variation is dramatic and will affect generation siting and sustainability. We find displacement of food crops, but net forest land and cropland expansion. We also find that GHG policies could substantially increase the delivered cost of biomass; however, the implications for individual regions and feedstocks is non-uniform, with some supplies falling to zero and others increasing. Finally, we find that bioelectricity is not carbon neutral, but can be emissions reducing relative to coal generation, yield greater direct GHG benefits than biofuels, and even result in domestic indirect emissions reductions with incentives for <b>forest</b> based <b>feedstocks.</b> Agricultural and Food Policy, Environmental Economics and Policy, Land Economics/Use, Resource /Energy Economics and Policy,...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2013 The {{emerging}} biofuels {{industry in}} Washington State presents enormous opportunities for family <b>forest</b> owners. <b>Feedstock</b> supply from family forest owners {{will likely be}} necessary to supplement the supply of forest residuals from public lands and large-scale private industrial properties. Like every innovation, feedstock-for-biofuels production is challenging. It entails new and different private forest management practices. In this thesis I explore family forest owner perceived motivations and constraints towards producing feedstock for biofuel. Through key informant interviews with pertinent biofuel scientists and "experts" I explored {{state of the art}} feedstock production practices and perceived opportunities and barriers to implementation by family forest owners. I also conducted focus group interviews with family forest owners to uncover the factors that explain interviewees' perceived motivations and constraints to feedstock production. Salient motivations included land management benefits, economics, ecological sustainability, and the potential for small-scale, decentralized infrastructure. Salient constraints included ecological concerns, perceived lack of economic feasibility and market uncertainty, and conflicts with forest values and management preferences. Interviews were also moderated to reveal a descriptive sense of the impact, probability and penetration of feedstock production practices. Interviewees expressed that centralizing and transporting biomass might be the most impactful, or constraining practices. Transporting biomass off-site also had the least penetration of feedstock production behaviors. However, interviewees expressed a higher likelihood of supplying forest residuals if this barrier could be overcome by having someone pick up residuals from their property.

40|$|Global {{demand for}} <b>forest</b> biomass <b>feedstock</b> has {{increased}} drastically in recent years, mainly {{due to the}} implementation of policies and strategies for climate change mitigation and renewable energy production in many jurisdictions. The biomass from dead trees has been recognized by the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) as a promising source of forest biomass for bioenergy at the global scale both because of its wide scale availability and its potential to limit global warming. In eastern Canada, dead trees are not only very abundant but are also widely perceived by lumber and pulp and paper producers as contaminants in the wood supply chain with marginal profitability. The general aim {{of this study was to}} determine the conditions of profitability of an eastern Canada independent sawmill (i. e., unaffiliated with a pulp plant) to produce pellets destined for international export using either co-products or roundwood from dead trees as feedstock. We compared the yield and monetary value of dead trees at various sizes and degradation levels for the production of wood pellets, alone or in conjunction with the production of lumber, to current market conditions. Our results suggest that using dead trees for lumber and pellets is almost as profitable as using them for lumber and pulp, with a difference of about 1 - 12 % depending on tree size. Dead trees from all classes of wood degradation could serve as an interesting feedstock for pellets because wood density was only slightly affected by wood degradation. Small dead trees (DBH. <. 15. cm) could serve for all scenarios, as the difference between revenues and costs remained generally minimal between them. Larger dead trees did not appear to represent a financially viable option under current market prices, unless suitable subsidies or other types of financial support are provided. The sustainability criteria applied by European consumers could therefore be a determining factor for the future importance of dead trees from eastern Canada as a source of feedstock for wood pellet production...|$|R

Enzymatic sugar production is a mature technology {{that can produce}} high quality sugars but requires a pretreatment step to open wood cell wall structure to improve its accessibility to enzymes, because nature produces wood as a structural material that is not easily accessible to most microbes to deconstruct into basic building blocks such as simple sugars.

Investigating a range of <b>feedstocks</b> (<b>forest</b> residues, corn stover, etc.) provided insight into the use of biomass residues rather than bioenergy crops as biochar production substrates and the resulting energy and climate change impacts. The analyses were conducted based on various optimized pyrolysis parameters for corn fodder and forest residue. The observed reductions of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (CO 2 equivalent per Mg dry feedstock) for both corn fodder and forest residue were mainly contributed by the stable carbon in the biochar. Corn fodder showed a greater reduction in emissions than forest residue, indicating the corn fodder’s greater economic potential for soil sequestration of stable carbon. The relative GHG emission analysis found that the optimization of a biomass pyrolysis system for biochar production is better suited for soil sequestration of stable carbon than as a fuel source. The economic viability of the pyrolysis-biochar system is largely dependent on the costs of feedstock production, pyrolysis, {{and the value of}} C offsets.

40|$|By 2030, the United States will consume over 300 {{million tons}} of <b>forest</b> and {{agricultural}} <b>feedstocks</b> for energy production. The supply chain necessary to provide unprecedented quantities of new “bioenergy crops,” however, is fraught with uncertainty. The vertically integrated model currently used by the nascent sector may have limited opportunity for expansion to meet renewable energy mandates. A hybrid structure is likely to emerge as the industry evolves, in which end-users closely cooperate {{with a large number}} of heterogeneous producers through long-term contracting rather than as direct owners or operators of biomass farms. This “vertically coordinated” industry model is dependent on a series of biomass supply contracts between end-user and farmer. The “take it or leave it” production contracts offered by end-users represent the archetypal cost- and risk-minimization perspectives common in the fossil fuel-based energy context (e. g., petroleum, coal). These initial offerings lack many of the considerations provided in agricultural-based contracting and are unlikely to engender the level of dedicated energy biomass cultivation needed to meet renewable energy mandates. In response, we propose an alternative Biomass Contract Framework, which incorporates three separate theoretical approaches to contract design with the objective of removing barriers to entry into the market. Incorporating a socioeconomic perspective into the more familiar risk- and cost-minimizing approaches found in contract theory literature will enhance producer ability to maintain existing social networks, while minimizing farmer disincentives to enter into production contracts for novel biomass crops. Our Framework also recognizes end-users’ needs to meet emerging environmental sustainability requirements, even perhaps facilitating “shed-level” coordination...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Nationwide county level supply curves {{have been}} {{estimated}} for forest-based biomass {{in order to}} help evaluate their potential contributions to producing bioenergy and biofuels. These estimates build on the estimates of potential supply in the USDA / DOE Billion ton biomass supply study. Forest biomass sources include logging residue, thinnings, other removals, unused mill residue, urban wood waste and conventional sourced wood (pulpwood size material). To make the estimates it is assumed that lower cost forest biomass will be supplied by in integrated harvesting operations which also remove sawlogs and pulpwood. It is assumed that such removals can be estimated at the county level in two ways. First as a portion of recent estimates of logging residues and second by simulated thinning operations that use tops, branches and small trees for biomass. Supply from thinning dense forest stands is assumed to occur over 30 years as in the original Billion Ton Supply Study. Harvest and stumpage costs are estimated for each of these methods. Final supply estimates for each county assume supply that is half way between the two estimates. Preliminary forest and agricultural biomass supply estimates have been used to indicate that for about $ 44 per oven dry ton (odt) at roadside or farm gate <b>forest</b> and agricultural <b>feedstocks</b> could produce 20 billion gallons of advanced biofuels as called for under the 2007 Energy Independence and Security Act.

The emissions balance analysed include greenhouse gas emissions from cultivation, land use change, processing and transport of biofuels. The biofuel production pathways reviewed are: -Biodiesel from palm oil in Indonesia, -Biodiesel from jatropha in South Africa and Mexico, -Bioethanol from sugar cane in South Africa, Mexico and Indonesia, -Bioethanol from wood in South Africa and Mexico, -Fischer-Tropsch diesel from wood in South Africa and Mexico Most calculations are undertaken using a tool developed by the BioGrace project funded by the European Union. For land use change emissions, three default values based on results from the partial equilibrium Global Biomass Optimisation Model (GLOBIOM) are used. An allocation of greenhouse gas emissions to the biofuel and its co-products is done by using the energy allocation method. The results show that wherever a land use change default value for non-wood feedstocks is used, this value dominates by far all other emission sources. Default land use change emissions for pathways using wood as feedstock are minor (short rotation coppice) or negative (wood from existing <b>forests).</b> However, woody <b>feedstocks</b> require second-generation conversion technologies. The least emission intensive first-generation pathways are bioethanol from sugar cane in Mexico and Indonesia due to the high productivity of sugar cane and the simple conversion process. Due to the limited country-specific database, a differentiation between countries or regions could not clearly be made. Differentiation can rather be done {{for the importance of}} particular factors such as feedstock productivity in conjunction with fertiliser use, allocation of co-products or the energy demand of specific conversion technologies...|$|R
40|$|As new markets, {{technologies}} and economies evolve {{in the low}} carbon bioeconomy, forest logging residue, a largely untapped renewable resource will play a vital role. The feedstock can however be variable depending on plant species and plant part component. This heterogeneity can influence the physical, chemical and thermochemical properties of the material, and thus the final yield and quality of products. Although {{it is challenging to}} control compositional variability of a batch of feedstock, it is feasible to monitor this heterogeneity and make the necessary changes in process parameters. Such a system will be a first step towards optimization, quality assurance and cost-effectiveness of processes in the emerging biofuel/chemical industry. The objective of this study was therefore to qualitatively classify forest logging residue made up of different plant parts using both near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIRS) together with linear discriminant analysis (LDA). Forest logging residue harvested from several Pinus taeda (loblolly pine) plantations in Alabama, USA, were classified into three plant part components: clean wood, wood and bark and slash (i. e., limbs and foliage). Five-fold cross-validated linear discriminant functions had classification accuracies of over 96 % for both NIRS and FTIRS based models. An extra factor/principal component (PC) was however needed to achieve this in FTIRS modeling. Analysis of factor loadings of both NIR and FTIR spectra showed that, the statistically different amount of cellulose in the three plant part components of logging residue contributed to their initial separation. This study demonstrated that NIR or FTIR spectroscopy coupled with PCA and LDA {{has the potential to be}} used as a high throughput tool in classifying the plant part makeup of a batch of <b>forest</b> logging residue <b>feedstock.</b> Thus, NIR/FTIR could be employed as a tool to rapidly probe/monitor the variability of forest biomass so that the appropriate online adjustments to parameters can be made in time to ensure process optimization and product quality...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), School of Economic Sciences, Washington State UniversiyThis {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} three studies that investigate impact of environmental taxes on firms' technology and entry behaviors, substitution between greenhouse gas (GHG) polluting and nonpolluting inputs in agricultural production, and lifecycle emissions with incorporation of input substitution in production and transportation sectors of biofuel. The first study examines under which conditions an environmental tax {{can be used to}} induce firms to adopt a clean technology and, also, to deter entry. We find that despite facing a polluting incumbent, an entrant might enter the market and acquire a clean technology when the tax is stringent enough and the clean technology is effective in eliminating pollution. A duopoly with two clean firms is socially optimal if the technology cost is low and the environmental damage is sufficiently high. However, if the environmental damage is low, a partially clean duopoly, in which only one firm adopts the green technology, could be socially optimal. The second study reports meta-regressions of Morishima substitution elasticities between GHG polluting and each of three nonpolluting inputs (labor, land, and capital) in agricultural production. We treat energy, fertilizer, and manure collectively as the "polluting input". Our results show that each estimated long-run elasticity for the reference case, which is most relevant for assessing GHG emissions through lifecycle analysis, is greater than 1. 0 and significantly different from zero. Predicted long-run elasticities generally remain significantly different from zero at the data means for alternative plausible cases. These findings imply that lifecycle analysis based on fixed proportions production functions could provide grossly inaccurate measures of GHG of biofuel. The third study develops a lifecycle economic analysis (LCEA) model that integrates input substitution, technology switching, and substitution of biodiesel for diesel into the standard lifecycle analysis (LCA) of biofuel that assumes fixed-proportions production. We use the LCEA model to examine the impacts of a pure carbon tax and a revenue-neutral tax-subsidy policy on lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions from cellulosic ethanol using <b>forest</b> residues as <b>feedstock</b> in Washington State. Our findings document that a standard LCA that assumes fixed input proportions substantially underestimates emission reduction from carbon tax policies.

40|$|Over {{the past}} few decades, a growing {{interest}} in the thermal conversion of alternative fuels such as biomass and waste-derived fuels has been observed among the energy-producing companies. Apart from meeting the increasing demand for sustainable heat and power production, other advantages such as reducing global warming and ameliorating landfilling issues have been identified. Among the available thermal conversion technologies, combustion in grate-fired furnaces {{is by far the}} most common mode of fuel conversion. In recent years, Fluidized-Bed (FB) technologies have grown to become one of the most suitable technologies for combustion and gasification of biomass and waste-derived fuels. In spite of the benefits, however, some difficulties are attributed to the thermal conversion of the alternative fuels. Ash-related issues could be a potential problem, as low-grade fuels may include considerable concentrations of ash-forming elements such as K, Na, S, Ca, Mg, P, Si and Cl. These elements undergo many undesirable chemical and physical transformations during the thermal conversion, and often cause operational problems such as deposition-related issues, slag formation in furnaces, corrosion of the heat transfer surfaces, and bed agglomeration of the fluidized-beds. Ash-related problems in the utility boilers are a major concern that may result in decreased efficiency, unscheduled outages, equipment failures, increased cleaning and high maintenance costs. This thesis investigated the ash behavior and ash-related problems in two different FB conversion systems: a Bubbling Fluidized-Bed (BFB) boiler combusting solid waste, and a Dual Fluidized-Bed (DFB) gasifier using biomass as feedstock. Full-scale measurements, chemical analysis of fuel and ash, as well as thermodynamic equilibrium modeling have been carried out for the BFB boiler (Papers I-IV), to investigate the impact of reduced-bed temperature (RBT) and also co-combustion of animal waste (AW) on the ash transformation behavior and the extent of ash-related issues in the boiler. For the DFB gasifier (Paper V), a thermodynamic equilibrium model was developed to assess the risk of bed agglomeration when forest residues are used as feedstock. The experimental results showed that the RBT and AW co-combustion could decrease or even resolve the ash-related issues in the BFB boiler, resulting in a lower deposit-growth rate in the superheater region, eliminating agglomerates, and a less corrosive deposit (in RBT case). Thermodynamic equilibrium modeling of the BFB boiler gave a better understanding of the ash transformation behavior, and also proved to be a reliable tool for predicting the risk of bed agglomeration and fouling. The modeling of the DFB gasifier indicated a low risk of bed agglomeration using the <b>forest</b> residues as <b>feedstock</b> and olivine as bed material, which was in good agreement following the observations in a full-scale DFB gasifier...|$|R
