In 2002, Dark Horse comics published a Kiss comic book authored by X-Men writer Joe Casey, which lasted for thirteen issues and ended production in 2004. On January 30, 2007, {{it was announced that}} the KISS Comics Group, a joint venture between Platinum Studios and the band, would launch a new comic, [...] "KISS 4K", with an oversized $50 Destroyer Edition, at the Wizard World Los Angeles Convention in March and with an ongoing series to follow in May by writer Ricky Sprague and artist Kevin Crossley. [...] "KISS 4K" [...] ran for six issues and one special edition issue in 2008. In 2011 Kiss teamed up with popular comic series Archie for a four-part series, Archie Meets Kiss.

40|$|In a {{printing}} <b>ink</b> <b>plant,</b> phthalocyanine (Pc) aqueous slurries {{are produced by}} grinding the Pc pigment in water using a media mill. Mostly, dispersions of Pc in water are used in heat-set printing inks to make the color phthalo blue. Typically, Pc slurries are 40 - 50 % solids and ground with steel media (spherical beads) to produce a stabilized dispersion with 99. 9 percent of all solid particles less than 0. 5 microns in size. Vertical media mills have been the industry norm; however, in producing submicron particle sizes, the efficiency is {{less than that of}} newer horizontal media mills that feature high internal flow and multiple pass grinding (Savastano, 2004). The goal of this experimental {{study was to determine the}} optimum operating conditions for a small industrial unit that incorporates newer technology. The first objective was to demonstrate in the laboratory the efficacy of grinding aqueous slurries of Pc using a horizontal peg media mill whose grinding chamber has a small length to width ratio. This was accomplished using a 0. 55 L Labstar Zeta mill, producing a satisfactory dispersion. A second objective in the laboratory was to optimize operating conditions (shot loading, agitator speed, and pump speed) in order to minimize the grinding time to produce acceptable product. The optimized conditions were: shot loading level of 85 %; agitator speed of 3000 RPM; and pump speed of 200 RPM yielding a run time of 1. 33 hours (80 minutes). The success of this project enabled an industrial chemical company to quickly bring a new 25 L unit on stream to grind and disperse Pc in water. Efficient production of finished ink was accomplished using almost identical operating conditions...|$|E

40|$|Today three {{series of}} {{regulations}} {{have a direct}} impact on reducing the consumption of petrochemical solvents: these are directive 1999 / 13 /EC aimed at reducing emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) due to industrial uses of solvents, and the directives on dangerous substances (67 / 548 /EEC) and on dangerous goods (1999 / 48 /EC) amended in 2002 that pertain mainly to chlorinated solvents (for example, trichloroethylene) and aromatics. The use of molecules derived from agriculture is an attractive alternative, both for agricultural production and in terms of environmental constraints. Companies in France are increasingly interested in biosolvents, with research programmes that receive funding from ADEME (via AGRICE) and are supported by several research laboratories and technical institutes. Three classes of biosolvents possess the technical characteristics that enable them to replace petrochemical solvents: vegetable oil esters (oilseed rape, sunflower, soy); esters of organic acids obtained by fermentation (acetic, citric, gluconic, lactic and succinic acid); ethanol and terpenes, in particular terpene alcohols that are not considered to be VOCs (steam pressure < 10 Pa at 293. 15 K). Overall, biosolvents have indubitable advantages. They possess high solvent capacity and low volatility, and are non-inflammable, biodegradable and non-toxic for the environment. They present no health risks, and are favourably rated for the impact classes “non-renewable primary energy” and “greenhouse effect”. Depending on the degree of product maturity, the main application sectors for biosolvents are printing <b>inks,</b> <b>plant</b> protection products, manual cold surface cleansing, paints and detergents...|$|R

40|$|Epoxy resins are an {{important}} class of thermostable polymers, widely used in structural applications or as adhesives. However, the low fracture resistance is their main weakness in many applications. Due to this fact, this study aims to modify a polymer matrix based on a novolac epoxy resin with an organo siloxane (AMS). The final properties of cured epoxys resins {{are affected by the}} curing process and the coatings modified in this study with AMS and cured with acid catalyst presented greater resistance to thermal decomposition compared to that cured with Aradur, demonstrating a higher content of crosslinking in the siloxane polyether and the novolak epoxy resin chains. This epoxy matrix modified was used to prepare coatings whose films applied to 1020 steel surfaces presented a resistance of 1010 Ohm-cm- 2. This resistance value is one order of magnitude greater than that of epoxy resins films modified by siloxanes in published studies, which demonstrates a potential economy in terms of maintenance costs of metal structures and machines used in power plants (UTE). To obtain the developed <b>inks</b> in pilot <b>plant</b> scale, it was used an aromatic polyamine as curing agent, characterizing the product obtained as an epoxy bi-component paint for commercial use...|$|R
5000|$|The Book of Rites {{describes}} ancient {{stereotypes about}} the Si Yi Four Barbarians surrounding China. The people of those five regions - the Middle states, and the Rong, Yi, (and other wild tribes round them) - had all their individual cultures, {{which they could}} not be made to alter. The tribes on the east were called Yi. They wore their hair long and natural, and tattooed their bodies with <b>ink</b> made from <b>plants</b> & roots. They were an agrarian people who lived off the land and raised their own animals for food. Those on the south were called Man. They also tattooed their foreheads with symbols, and were as tan-skinned as the Yi from working their crop fields and tending to animals. Those on the west were called Rong. They also wore their hair long and in braids. They sometimes sewed their animal skins into warm clothing. Some of them did not eat grain-food, however meat and fish were a main source of their diet. Those on the north were called Di. They also wove skins of animals and colorful birds to adorn their clothing, and preferred to build their shelters in the more mountainous hillsides. Some of them also did not eat grain-food, but relied heavily on a meat supply. The people of the Middle states, and of those Yi, Man, Rong, and Di, all established their own individual cultures and thriving communities, where they lived at relative ease; with much peace among their tribes. They made clothes suitable for themselves; practical tools for proper use; and their shelters were diverse and prepared in abundance. In those five regions, the languages of the people were not mutually intelligible, as their likings and desires were different. To make what was in their minds apprehended, and to communicate their likings and desires, (there were officers) - in the east, called transmitters; in the south, representationists; in the west, Di-dis; and in the north, interpreters.|$|R
