The horse population, consisting almost entirely of Finnhorses, remained stable for 50 years. The rebuilding of the country after two wars had increased demand for horse power, and by the 1950s, the breed reached its all-time peak, with an estimated 409,000 animals, with a great majority of the horses being of the draught type. However, with the increased mechanisation of agriculture and forestry in the 1960s, the number of Finnhorses dropped precipitously. Horses, having been bred in large numbers only a few years earlier, were taken to slaughter by the thousands; a change in <b>forestry</b> <b>tax</b> policy made previously state-supported horse-powered forestry unprofitable and further discouraged keeping horses. Many working horse bloodlines ended, while lines more suitable for sports and recreation survived. By the 1970s, the breed's numbers had declined to 90,000 animals, and 10 years later as few as 20,000 Finnhorses existed. The breed's all-time lowest point was 1987, with only 14,100 horses. By this time, however, the overall horse population in Finland had been increasing for almost a decade, with lighter harness racing horse breeds establishing their position, counting 12,800 animals the same year.|$|E

40|$|Partial Abstract: Private {{industrial}} and non-industrial forest landowners in Washington face federal, state, and local regulations concerning {{the practice of}} commercial forestry. Such regulations certainly impact decisions related to conversion of forestlands into other uses. This paper briefly describes relevant laws and regulations governing forestry operations in Washington, including the State Forest Practices Act (FPA), the State Forests and Fish Rules (FFR), economic mitigation programs associated with those rules, federal Habitat Conservation Plans (HCP’s), conservation easements, <b>forestry</b> and conservation <b>tax</b> issues, and the State Growth Management Act (GMA) ...|$|R
40|$|In early 2004, {{the finance}} ministers of Bavaria and Rhineland-Palatinate {{put forward a}} new model for {{assessing}} land tax. The model envisages {{the abolition of the}} current Land Tax A (tax on agricultural and <b>forestry</b> enterprises); Land <b>Tax</b> B (developed/ developable real estate) is in future to comprise a flatrate tax on the buildings and a more up-to-date and realistic taxation of the land value based on the standard land value. Nevertheless, the question still remains: Why not go one step further and replace this ‘combined tax on land and buildings’ with a simple ‘land value tax’...|$|R
40|$|This paper reviews {{forestry}} {{reform in}} the Congo basin, focusing on Gabon. It argues that the key challenge for the Congo basin countries is to manage their forests in a sustainable manner. It presents the current situation of forestry taxation and forestry reform in Gabon. The paper analyzes optimal taxation in the forestry sector using a static model. The model works from the proposition that tax policy should be used exclusively for revenue purposes and resource preservation should be achieved mainly through legislation and enforcement. It argues that when prices are uncertain the best practice is to tax only profits.

50|$|The Flow Country {{was badly}} damaged between 1979 and 1987 through the {{planting}} of non-native conifer forests and the cutting {{of thousands of}} miles of drains. The trees dried out the peat, changing the habitat and destroying its value for birds and other wildlife. The trees were mostly planted on land bought by Fountain Forestry who recognised that this would be attractive to wealthy investors who could claim planting grants and tax relief against all their other income, at a time of high personal taxation. The ploughing of the bogs and tree planting helped to reduce local unemployment which was {{among the highest in the}} United Kingdom: however in 1987 the Nature Conservancy Council (NCC) launched a report in London that was highly critical of the foresters. The Conservative Party which was in government at the time decided to disband the NCC and create a separate Scottish agency now called Scottish Natural Heritage. However, in 1988 Nigel Lawson, The Chancellor of the Exchequer, recognised that a tax break was doing enormous harm to the last real wilderness in the United Kingdom and scrapped the <b>forestry</b> <b>tax</b> reliefs. This immediately halted further planting and encouraged the Forestry Commission to adopt a much broader approach that respects existing landscapes. In an effort to restore the damage, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) have bought a large area in the centre of the Flow Country and have created the Forsinard nature reserve. More than 20 km2 has been bought back from Fountain Forestry and the young trees felled and allowed to rot in the plough furrow in the hope and expectation that, in 30 to 100 years, the land will revert to peat bog.|$|E

40|$|Recent genetic {{improvements}} {{with some}} tree species {{has given us}} hybrids that have disease resistance, rapid growth, {{and the ability to}} regenerate from the stump after harvest. Grown intensively these hybrids are capable of producing and storing a usable 250 mBTU per acre per year on a biennial harvest of the total tree. Employing the best of today's silvicultural techniques and boiler equipment each tree can produce a little more than one boiler horsepower per year. Utilizing non-prime lands for the production of 'hybrid poplars' one acre can generate the wood fuel equivalent of 40 barrels of oil ($ 8 /bbl) or 2500 therms of natural gas ($ 0. 13 /therm) per year and can be harvested every other year. Beyond the economic and environmental benefits there are additional merits to be realized by growing your own woodfuel. Like money in the bank, fuel may be withdrawn from the forest bank 'as needed' while the reserves accrue growth. The nutrient rich ash 'remains' can be utilized to sustain the yield of an energy plantation. Unlike other alternative sources of energy that are capital intensive, 'growing your own woodfuel' is labor intensive. You can also receive significant <b>forestry</b> <b>tax</b> incentives; and, above all, you can avoid any fuel 'cartel'...|$|E
40|$|Many forest {{amenities}} {{are derived}} {{not only from}} the age of the trees, but also from the density of the trees. When an externality such as erosion control is considered, clear-cutting results in much larger damages than occur with selective cutting. This paper extends current methodology, allowing firms to optimize over both rotation time and the commercial use percentage per acre. A two-part instrument, a "clear-cut" tax combined with a lump sum "licensing fee", controls for commercial use percentage and rotation time in a firm that does not internalize non-timber benefits. Optimal taxes are presented that correct the firm's suboptimal behavior. A two-part instrument is shown to remedy market failure when a private firm clear-cuts and harvests too soon, and when an overgrown forest is not privately optimal to maintain. Numerical analysis on a simple case, simulating a forest where the externality is erosion control shows the clear-cut tax policy's relevance for a variety of erosion severity scenarios and interest rates.

40|$|Countries {{generally}} <b>tax</b> the <b>forestry</b> {{sector to}} achieve the twin objectives of revenue maximization and sustainability of logging levels. In an ideal world of perfect markets and information, auctions {{would be the best}} instrument to determine the price of extraction rights. However, a number of factors-including a lack of information on the forest resources under consideration, uncertainties as to the stability of property rights over time, and a lack of access to credit-have limited the use of auctions so far, particularly in low-income countries. To establish transparency of the forestry sector''s financial flows, this paper discusses a radical simplification of Liberia''s current timber tax structure, including a proposal to reduce the sector''s current tax system to two instruments, an area tax and an export <b>tax.</b> Forestry;Taxation;Agriculture;forest, <b>forestry</b> sector, forests, forest management, forest resources, tax structure, environmental <b>taxes,</b> <b>forestry</b> activity, timber production, forest land, forest sector, <b>tax</b> system, <b>forestry</b> activities, timber companies, fiscal instruments, forest exploitation, tax burden, fiscal arrangements, tropical forests, revenue collection, timber taxation, wood products, timber products, forest areas, government revenue, tax administration, tax credits, forest owners, wood processing industry, high tax burden, timber harvest, sustainable forest management, arable land, tax rates, conservation activities, forest resource utilization, wood processing, forest stock, tax administrations, concession rights, forest management plans, forest resource, forest product, forest policy, forest concessions, forest management plan, demand for timber, tax authority, forest revenue, forestry agencies, forestry development, forest cover, forest development, forest sustainability, forest lands, forest taxation, fiscal rules, forest biodiversity, sustainable management of forests...|$|R
40|$|While {{there has}} been a large {{increase}} in investment in plantation forestry in New Zealand by smallholders during the past decade, there are still many smallholders who have chosen not to become involved in this land use or who are using only a portion of their potentially planted land for forestry. To understand why this is the case, this paper studies two issues, the differences between those who have and have not established plantation forests, and the factors that explain the proportion of land used in forestry by small landholders who have identified that they have potentially plantable land. Land used for forest plantations is treated as a two-step decision process, where first a landowner must decide whether they would consider planting trees at all and then secondly how much land would be planted in trees. With this approach, a double hurdle model is used to study planting decisions. Using survey data obtained from 344 landholders in four South Island districts, the results indicate that property-specific factors, such as property size, years of ownership, and ownership being part of a partnership, as well as landowner characteristics such as perceptions of tax policies being favourable for forestry, off farm income level and expectations of increasing log prices were correlated with the decision whether to establish a plantation forest. The factors determining the extent of land identified as being potentially profitable in forestry actually being used for plantation forestry include <b>forestry</b> <b>tax</b> policy, expectations of increasing log prices, regional location of a property, owner’s annual income, and area used in sheep and beef production. forestry investment, land use change, non-industrial forests, double hurdle model, Land Economics/Use, Q 15, Q 23,...|$|E
