5000|$|Dominant - The element or {{stimulus}} {{that determines}} all subsequent and subordinate elements or stimuli. For films that implement Montage Theory, these dominant elements are determined prior to shooting and inform {{the script and}} editing process. Not all dominants are singular elements (lighting, allusion, timing, etc.) but can be the product or sum total of all stimulants. For example, in The General Line, Eisenstein determined dominant stimulants based on the composition of single shots [...] "by the method of 'democratic' equal rights for all the stimulants, viewed together as a complex". This was Eisenstein's attempt to parallel Japanese Kabuki theater, which composed movement in a simultaneously fragmented but hierarchal fashion. More frequently, however, dominants took overt and singular form. In Man with a Movie Camera, Vertov constructs one sequence- scarcely definable as a “scene”- through the dominant movement of circularity, displaying <b>industrial</b> <b>threading</b> machines and human movements that performed circularly.|$|R

Cataloged from PDF version of Internship report. RMG sector {{is one of the}} biggest and most GDP earning sectors in Bangladesh. This sector works with some raw materials. One of those raw materials is <b>industrial</b> sewing <b>thread.</b> RMG sector could be stopped without <b>industrial</b> sewing <b>thread.</b> There are many companies world for supply threads and coats PLC is one of them and the largest one. Coats PLC runs its business named Coats Bangladesh Ltd. My report contains a brief study on this company and SCM process of sewing thread supplying industry in Bangladesh based on this company. For completing this report I went through the extended enterprise which includes key suppliers, manufacturers, and end customers of a specific company as well as industry. I tried to analyze the real situation for preparing the report. Sk Abdullah Al JameoB. Business Administratio...|$|R

50|$|Ramie {{is used to}} {{make such}} {{products}} as <b>industrial</b> sewing <b>thread,</b> packing materials, fishing nets, and filter cloths. It is also made into fabrics for household furnishings (upholstery, canvas) and clothing, frequently in blends with other textile fibers (for instance when used in a mixture with wool, shrinkage {{is reported to be}} greatly reduced when compared with pure wool.) Shorter fibers and waste are used in paper manufacture. Ramie ribbon is used in fine bookbinding as a substitute for traditional linen tape.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Industrial</b> Digital <b>Thread</b> is {{a complex}} and {{comprehensive}} concept {{and it will be}} implemented in multiple phases. Phase 1 focuses on assembling the software stack, establishing the architecture and connectivity, and addressing one use case around premature wear. Throughout Phase 1, the testbed will be run by IIC members General Electric and Infosys. In subsequent phases, this testbed will be able to support multiple use cases in design, manufacturing, services and supply-chain optimization. At this time, additional members will be invited to join.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Industrial</b> Digital <b>Thread</b> (IDT) testbed drives efficiency, speed, and {{flexibility}} through digitization and automation of manufacturing processes and procedures. Beginning at design, the seamless digital integration of design systems into manufacturing, leveraging the model-based enterprise, helps to enable virtual manufacturing before even one physical part is created. Sensor enabled automation, manufacturing processes, procedures, and machine data will enable optimization in operations and supply chain. Once {{the manufacturing process}} is complete, the digital ‘birth certificate’ (as built-signature) can then {{be compared to the}} as-designed engineering intention. This provides the opportunity for powerful big data analytics to enable service teams and field engineers to have better awareness, insights, and practical actions to improve the servicing and maintenance of critical assets.|$|R

They are noted for making hammocks so large that they resemble fishing nets. They envelope the occupant completely, including those meant for two people. They netting is light to let air pass but close enough {{to act as a}} mosquito net. They made hammocks of both sisal and <b>industrial</b> cotton <b>thread.</b> The most traditional are made of sisal, which is a type of agave. The process of creating fiber from the agave leaves is called “corchado” and has its origins in the pre Hispanic period. It is difficult work but it results in fine and study products.|$|R

40|$|Due to {{the demand}} for high <b>industrial</b> productivity, <b>thread</b> tension is of vital {{significance}} in embroidery machine systems. By appropriately adjusting the thread tension during the embroidering process, a lower thread-breakage rate can be achieved, and as a result, the embroidering speed and productivity will be greatly improved. In this research, we shall address the thread tension problem. First, we analyze the critical part of the thread, where breakage {{is most likely to}} occur during the embroidering process, using an image capturing and processing technique; then, a particular dynamics model of the thread motion in the critical part will be derived. From the model attained, mechanisms to reduce the peak tension and the thread breakage rate for embroidery machines will be developed. The thread breakage rate can be reduced from the improvement of the tension system. However, a reliable and economical breakage detection system is also indispensable for an embroidery machine system. But current design of the breakage detection system cannot meet the requirements of the embroidering process at higher and higher speeds. A new detection system is constructed in this research. Based on the detector mechanism of current design, an advanced breakage judgment rule is proposed. And, new designs in the detection logic unit and the communication network provide the high-performance detection function, which is desired in embroidery machine systems...|$|R

Also, each thread has one lock associated with it that is used when the thread requests a new clause from the master clause database. This lock is used to increment its current database position pointer. This pointer keeps track of which clauses the thread has already looked at, and those that can still be added. Figure 1 shows a top level diagram with threads inserting pointers to clauses into the master clause database (represents a pointer to a conflict clause) ...|$|R
