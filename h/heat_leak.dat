Current cryogen feed line multilayer insulation (MLI) performance is 10 times worse per area than tank MLI insulation. During each launch, cryogenic piping loses approximately 150, 000 gallons (equivalent to $ 300, 000) in boil-off during transfer, chill down, and ground hold. Quest Product Development Corp., teaming with Ball Aerospace, developed an innovative advanced insulation system, Wrapped MLI (wMLI), to provide improved thermal insulation for cryogenic feed lines. wMLI is high-performance multilayer insulation designed for cryogenic piping.

These tests were performed with ambient <b>heat</b> <b>leaks</b> = 20 and 50 W for tank fill levels of 90 %, 50 %, and 25 %. TVS performance testing revealed that the spray bar was highly effective in providing tank pressure control within a 7 -kPa band (131 - 138 Wa), and complete destratification of the liquid and the ullage was achieved with all test conditions.

40|$|The {{multipurpose}} hydrogen {{test bed}} (MHTB), with an 18 -cu m liquid hydrogen tank, {{was used to}} evaluate a combination foam/multilayer combination insulation (MLI) concept. The foam element (Isofoam SS- 1171) insulates during ground hold/ascent flight, and allowed a dry nitrogen purge as opposed to the more complex/heavy helium purge subsystem normally required. The 45 -layer MLI was designed for an on-orbit storage period of 45 days. Unique WI features include a variable layer density, larger but fewer double-aluminized Mylar perforations for ascent to orbit venting, and a commercially established roll-wrap installation process that reduced assembly man-hours and resulted in a roust, virtually seamless MLI. Insulation performance was measured during three test series. The spray-on foam insulation (SOFI) successfully prevented purge gas liquefaction within the MLI and resulted in the expected ground hold <b>heat</b> <b>leak</b> of 63 W/sq m. The orbit hold tests resulted in heat leaks of 0. 085 and 0. 22 W/sq m with warm boundary temperatures of 164 and 305 K, respectively.
