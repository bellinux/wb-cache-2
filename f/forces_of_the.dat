30|$|<b>The</b> normal <b>force</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> foot is {{generally}} {{much larger than}} the tangential <b>force.</b> <b>The</b> normal <b>force</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> foot is not only a key factor on influencing the position and balance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> robot as well as power consumption <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mobile system, but also a principle balance force to equilibrate <b>the</b> weight <b>of</b> <b>the</b> robot and its load. Thus, to easily calculate <b>the</b> normal <b>force</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> foot using the mechanical equilibrium equation, <b>the</b> tangential <b>force</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> foot can be ignored in the theoretical mechanical analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> foot <b>force</b> under the robot’s gait.

30|$|According to Figure  11, {{when the}} step pitch s changes from 0.1  m to 0.4  m {{and the initial}} angle Δθ is 60 °, {{it can be found}} that <b>the</b> maximum normal <b>force</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> foot remains {{constant}} for the leg 2, <b>the</b> maximum normal <b>force</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> foot first decreases, then increases, and finally decreases for leg 4, and <b>the</b> maximum normal <b>force</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> foot <b>of</b> leg 6 varies from augmentation to a decrease.|$|R
30|$|<b>The</b> normal <b>force</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> foot is {{the main}} component, and it is often larger than <b>the</b> {{tangential}} <b>force</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> foot. From <b>the</b> perspective <b>of</b> posture and balance, the main factors influencing <b>the</b> poses <b>of</b> <b>the</b> multi-legged robots are pitch, roll, and vertical fluctuation. The factors {{are directly related to}} <b>the</b> normal <b>force</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> foot on every leg [17]. From <b>the</b> perspective <b>of</b> power consumption for <b>the</b> mobile system <b>of</b> robot, <b>the</b> power consumption <b>of</b> joint is primarily confirmed by <b>the</b> normal <b>force</b> <b>of</b> foot. <b>The</b> reason is that the mass and load of robot are counterpoised by <b>the</b> normal <b>force</b> <b>of</b> foot of each leg. Hence, it shows that <b>the</b> normal <b>force</b> <b>of</b> foot directly affects the posture and balance of robot and power consumption of mobile system. However, <b>the</b> normal <b>force</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> foot varies when the same leg is under different walking modes or gait. The walking mode and gait of robot are inherently associated with <b>the</b> normal <b>force</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> foot. Hence, the relationship between the gait and <b>the</b> normal <b>force</b> <b>of</b> foot will be important for reducing <b>the</b> power consumption <b>of</b> mobile systems and improving the load to mass ratio and stability of heavy-duty multi-legged robots.|$|R
30|$|Based on Figure  6, <b>the</b> normal <b>force</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> foot <b>of</b> leg 2 {{gradually}} decreases from 1478  N to 1098  N, {{when the}} initial angle Δθ of abductor joint varies from 0 ° to 60 °. <b>The</b> normal <b>force</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> foot <b>of</b> leg 2 {{is a constant}} with a change of step pitch s.
