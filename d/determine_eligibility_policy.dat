40|$|Abstract This study {{investigates the}} factors that {{underlie}} large variation in Medic-aid and Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) policies among states. Both eli-gibility and provider payment policies are examined for low-income children and parents. I find that state variation {{in the cost of}} providing health care, due to variation in the intensity of health care use, is a key determinant of <b>eligibility</b> <b>policies,</b> and I also find tentative evidence of an effect for payment policies. Because rising health care spending increases the cost of providing health insurance coverage, state policy mak-ers in high-spending states enact less generous Medicaid and CHIP policies. Results also indicate that the political environments of states are very important in <b>determining</b> their <b>eligibility</b> <b>policies,</b> but fewer political variables influence payment policies. In addition to including variables not yet examined in the context of Medicaid policy, this study uses an innovative measure of state-level health care spending and carefully con-structed dependent variables that lend credibility to causal interpretations of relationships...|$|R
