Trace fossils are {{particularly}} significant because {{they represent a}} <b>data</b> <b>source</b> that {{is not limited to}} animals with easily fossilised hard parts, and they reflect organisms' behaviours. Also many traces date from significantly earlier than the body fossils of animals that are thought to have been capable of making them. Whilst exact assignment of trace fossils to their makers is generally impossible, traces may for example provide the earliest physical evidence of the appearance of moderately complex animals (comparable to earthworms).|$|E

40|$|Web {{communities}} involve {{networks of}} loosely coupled <b>data</b> <b>sources.</b> Members in those communities {{should be able}} to pose queries and gather results from all <b>data</b> <b>sources</b> in the network, where available. At the same time, <b>data</b> <b>sources</b> should have limited restrictions on how to organize their data. If a global schema is not available for such a network, query processing is strongly based on the existence of (hard to maintain) mapping rules between pairs of <b>data</b> <b>sources.</b> If a global schema is available, local schemas of <b>data</b> <b>sources</b> have to follow strict modelling restrictions posed by that schema. In this paper, we suggest an architecture to provide better support for distributed data management in loosely coupled <b>data</b> <b>sources.</b> In our approach, <b>data</b> <b>sources</b> can maintain diverse schemas. No explicit mapping rules between <b>data</b> <b>sources</b> are needed to facilitate query processing. <b>Data</b> <b>sources</b> can join and leave the network any time, at no cost for the community.

The DSN stores this information in a standardized format, and the DM provides this to the driver during connection requests. The DM also includes functionality to present a list of DSNs using human readable names, and to select them at run-time to connect to different resources.|$|E
