The series included pesos of six denominations, including $1, $5, $10, $20, $50 and $100 bills. The designs of all banknotes feature Pedro Albizu Campos in the front side while the reverses are adorned with the flags of Puerto Rico, Jayuya and the Nationalist Party. Microprint with the names of Pedro Albizu Campos and Filiberto Ojeda Ríos are found throughout the pesos. On July 10, 2005, Liberty Dollar of Puerto Rico was created by Alfredo Pacheco Martínez. Silver ounces began circulating on October 8, 2005, marking {{the first time that a}} silver coin was distributed in more than a century. After an <b>intervention</b> <b>with</b> parent company Liberty Services concluded with its assets being confiscated, leading to a process that resulted in the indictment and conviction of founder Bernard von NotHaus, Pacheco Martínez continued to circulate the coins under the name of Dólar Boricua. In August 2010, he was also indicted on the same charges faced by Von NotHaus. Pacheco Martínez was found guilty on June 29, 2012, being subsequently sentenced to 19 years in prison.|$|E
5|$|The Congress disbanded in {{the third}} week of December, and the next step would be a {{congress}} at Laibach to discuss <b>intervention</b> <b>with</b> Ferdinand. Metternich found himself able to dominate Laibach more than any other congress, overseeing Ferdinand's rejection of the liberal constitution he had agreed to only months before. Austrian armies left for Naples in February and entered the city in March. The Congress was adjourned but, forewarned or by luck, Metternich kept representatives of the powers close at hand until the revolt was put down. As a result, when similar revolts broke out in Piedmont in the middle of March, Metternich had the Tsar at hand, who agreed to send 90,000 men to the frontier in a show of solidarity. Concerns grew in Vienna that Metternich's policy was too expensive. He responded that Naples and Piedmont would pay for stability; nonetheless, he, too, was clearly worried for the future of Italy. He was relieved when able to create a Court Chancellor and Chancellor of State on 25 May, a post left vacant since the death of Kaunitz in 1794. He was also pleased at the renewed (if fragile) closeness between Austria, Prussia and Russia; however, it had {{come at the expense of}} the Anglo-Austrian entente.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES. A {{large number}} of studies {{evaluating}} adolescent smoking prevention programs have been published. Systematic quantitative reviews of this literature are needed to learn what does and does not work. The present meta-analysis focuses on the efficacy of school-based programs. METHODS. Evaluations of 94 separate interventions {{were included in the}} meta-analysis. Studies were screened for methodological rigor and those with weaker methodology were segregated from those with more defensible methodology; major analyses focused on the latter. RESULTS. Behavioral effect sizes were found to be largest for <b>interventions</b> <b>with</b> a social reinforcement orientation, moderate for <b>interventions</b> <b>with</b> either a developmental or a social norms orientation, and small for <b>interventions</b> <b>with</b> the traditional rational orientation. Attitude effect sizes followed the same pattern, but knowledge effect sizes were similar across all four orientation categories. CONCLUSIONS. Because behavioral effect represents the fundamental objective of programs for prevention of adolescent tobacco use, the present results indicate that school-based programs should consider adopting <b>interventions</b> <b>with</b> a social reinforcement, social norms, or developmental orientation...|$|R

Joined by Jin and Canaan, they unlock the data within Canaan, revealing that the Immigrant Fleet has funded U-TIC since its inception, and that MOMO's father Mizrahi sacrificed himself to seal Miltia away after Albedo released the energy U-DO. After a skirmish with Margulis, the group find the Zohar and two deformed comatose Realians used to control its energy: these are Cecily and Cathe. Shion reluctantly allows KOS-MOS to kill Cecily and Cathe. The Zohar is claimed by Sergius in behalf of Ormus and the Immigrant Fleet. He installs the Zohar into the Proto Omega, a giant machine built within the structure of Miltia, with the intent of destroying the Gnosis and Federation so Ormus will be free to rediscover Lost Jerusalem.|$|E

40|$|Background. Evidence-based {{practice}} aims {{to improve}} patient care and service delivery, {{particularly in the}} management of individuals with low back pain, the largest client group seen by out-patient physiotherapists. Objective: This study determined the prevalence of use of <b>interventions</b> <b>with</b> evidence of effectiveness {{in the management of}} acute non-specific low back pain by physiotherapists. Methods. A multi-centered cross-sectional study was conducted on 100 physiotherapists working with low back pain patients. Using a telephone-administered interview, therapists described their current and desired treatment practices for a typical case of low back pain. Each intervention reported was coded according to its evidence of effectiveness (strong, moderate, limited or none) as per Van Tulder's rating system. Information on clinician, workplace and client characteristics was also obtained. Results. The prevalence of use of <b>interventions</b> <b>with</b> strong or moderate evidence of effectiveness was 68 %. Almost all therapists use <b>interventions</b> <b>with</b> limited or no evidence of effectiveness or moderate evidence of ineffectiveness. Users of <b>interventions</b> <b>with</b> high evidence of effectiveness, as compared to non-users, had graduated more recently (p = 0. 0098) and had taken a higher number of post-graduate clinical courses (p = 0. 0091). Conclusion. Although most therapists use <b>interventions</b> <b>with</b> high evidence of effectiveness, much of their treatment programs consist of interventions that are not well studied in the literature...|$|R
