Recent findings discussed within this review offer new insight and provide direction for future research to conclusively resolve this debate...|$|E
40|$|A {{significant}} number of Australian schools are implementing greening projects. Grant and Littlejohn describe this as “transforming barren expanses of asphalt and frayed grass into exciting natural spaces for learning, playing and socialising” (2001, pg. 2). The benefits of greening projects have become <b>increasingly</b> <b>more</b> <b>convincing</b> to schools especially {{with the advent of}} supporting research and funding increases for this area (Sterling, 2001). This paper reports the stories (research) of 5 teachers experience with a recently developed program, Schoolgrounds for Learning which was designed and delivered by the Gould Group 1 (Cutter-Mackenzie, 2007). The teachers researched their schoolgrounds practice over 6 months. Teachers were given a research pack containing a journal, camera and research tips. All teacher researchers were also supported by a mentor (Monash researcher). The teachers’ research revealed significant insights and findings about the program and school greening projects more broadly. Their research showed that the program acted as a springboard leading to other sustainability initiatives, in addition to providing an impetus or driver for teacher enthusiasm, commitment and change in adopting environmental education / sustainability teaching and learning pedagogies. In short, the paper outlines the transformative effects of schoolgrounds approaches on teaching and learning and the social and ecological culture of schools...|$|E

40|$|One {{complement}} to domestic climate policies {{could be the}} regulation of carbon dioxide emissions arising during the production of imported products. Such ‘border carbon adjustments’ (BCAs) {{are said to have}} several benefits, but are also severely criticised. This Policy Brief highlights some weaknesses in the standard argumentation for BCAs. But there is an alternative argument for border carbon measures, {{based on the fact that}} countries expose each other to climate externalities. The reformulated argument is economically <b>more</b> <b>convincing,</b> and provides a <b>more</b> <b>convincing</b> justification for the extraterritorial feature of border carbon measures. However, there are also several important factors mitigating against the implementation of such measures, including the risk that these measures will be used for protectionism.

40|$|In this paper, we {{describe}} precedent-based explanations for case-based classification systems. Previous work {{has shown that}} explanation cases that are more marginal than the query case, {{in the sense of}} lying between the query case and the decision boundary, are <b>more</b> <b>convincing</b> explanations. We show how to retrieve such explanation cases in a way that requires lower knowledge engineering overheads than previously. We evaluate our approaches empirically, finding that the explanations that our systems retrieve are often <b>more</b> <b>convincing</b> than those found by the previous approach. The paper ends with a thorough discussion of a range of factors that affect precedent-based explanations, many of which warrant further research...|$|R
