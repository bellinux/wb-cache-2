These advancements are achieved through the large bandwidth available in this band and through the use of highly directional links that will be used to overcome the large pathloss at these frequencies. Although the terrestrial application of mmWave systems is advancing at a rapid pace, the use of mmWave communication systems in aviation systems or airports is still in its infancy. This can be attributed to the challenges related to radio technology and lack of development, and characterization of mmWave wireless channels for the aviation field and the airport environment. Consequently, one of our goals is to develop methodologies that support mmWave air to <b>ground</b> <b>links,</b> and various links at airports, by applying new localization schemes that allow for application of highly directional links that can be deployed over longer distances despite the high path loss at mmWave frequencies.

40|$|This thesis investigates new {{schemes to}} improve the {{operability}} of heterogeneous Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) teams through the exploitation of inter-vehicular communications. Releasing <b>ground</b> <b>links</b> from unnecessary data exchanges saves resources (power, bandwidth, etc) and alleviates the inherent scalability problem resulting from {{the increase in the}} number of UAS to be controlled simultaneously. In first place, a framework to classify UAS according to their level of autonomy is presented along with efficient methodologies to assess the autonomy level of either individual or multiple UAS. An architecture based on an aerial Mobile Ad-hoc Network (MANET) is proposed for the management of the data exchange among all the vehicles in the team. A performance evaluation of the two most relevant MANET approaches for path discovery (namely, reactive and proactive) has been carried out by means of simulation of two well-known routing protocols: Ad-hoc On-demand Distance Vector (AODV) and Destination Sequenced Distance Vector (DSDV). Several network configurations are generated to emulate different possible contingencies that might occur in real UAS team operations. Network topology evolution, vehicle flight dynamics and data traffic patterns are considered as input parameters to the simulation model. The analysis of the system behaviour for each possible network configuration is used to evaluate the appropriateness of both approaches in different mission scenarios. Alternative network solutions based on Delay Tolerant Networking (DTN) for situations of intermittent connectivity and network partitioning are outlined. Finally, an assessment of the simulation results is presented along with a discussion about further research challenges...|$|E

40|$|In recent years, {{free space}} optical (FSO) {{communication}} has gained significant importance owing to its unique features: large bandwidth, license free spectrum, high data rate, easy and quick deployability, less power and low mass requirement. FSO communication uses optical carrier {{in the near}} infrared (IR) and visible band to establish either terrestrial links within the Earths atmosphere or inter-satellite or deep space links or ground to satellite or satellite to <b>ground</b> <b>links.</b> However, despite of great potential of FSO communication, its performance {{is limited by the}} adverse effects (viz., absorption, scattering and turbulence) of the atmospheric channel. Out of these three effects, the atmospheric turbulence is a major challenge that may lead to serious degradation in the bit error rate (BER) performance of the system and make the communication link infeasible. This paper presents a comprehensive survey on various challenges faced by FSO communication system for both terrestrial and space links. It will provide details of various performance mitigation techniques in order to have high link availability and reliability of FSO system. The first part of the paper will focus on various types of impairments that poses a serious challenge to the performance of FSO system for both terrestrial and space links.

40|$|A {{large-scale}} {{network that}} supports {{a large number}} of users can have an aggregate data rate of hundreds of Mbps at any time. High-fidelity simulation of a large-scale network might be too complicated and memory-intensive for typical commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) tools. Unlike a large commercial wide-area-network (WAN) that shares diverse network resources among diverse users and has a complex topology that requires routing mechanism and flow control, the ground communication links of a space network operate under the assumption of a guaranteed dedicated bandwidth allocation between specific sparse endpoints in a star-like topology. This work solved the network design problem of estimating the bandwidths of a ground network architecture option that offer different service classes to meet the latency requirements of different user data types. In this work, a top-down analysis and simulation approach was created to size the bandwidths of a store-and-forward network for a given network topology, a mission traffic scenario, and a set of data types with different latency requirements. These techniques were used to estimate the WAN bandwidths of the <b>ground</b> <b>links</b> for different architecture options of the proposed Integrated Space Communication and Navigation (SCaN) Network. A new analytical approach, called the "leveling scheme," was developed to model the store-and-forward mechanism of the network data flow. The term "leveling" refers to the spreading of data across a longer time horizon without violating the corresponding latency requirement of the data type. Two versions of the leveling scheme were developed: 1. A straightforward version that simply spreads the data of each data type across the time horizon and doesn't take into account the interactions among data types within a pass, or between data types across overlapping passes at a network node, and is inherently sub-optimal. 2. Two-state Markov leveling scheme that takes into account the second order behavior of the store-and-forward mechanism, and the interactions among data types within a pass. The novelty of this approach lies in the modeling of the store-and-forward mechanism of each network node. The term store-and-forward refers to the data traffic regulation technique in which data is sent to an intermediate network node where they are temporarily stored and sent at a later time to the destination node or to another intermediate node. Store-and-forward can be applied to both space-based networks that have intermittent connectivity, and ground-based networks with deterministic connectivity. For groundbased networks, the store-and-forward mechanism is used to regulate the network data flow and link resource utilization such that the user data types can be delivered to their destination nodes without violating their respective latency requirements...|$|E
40|$|Outside polar latitudes, {{features}} {{corresponding to}} surface thaw {{have yet to}} be identified on Mars. The youthful gully landforms observed at mid-high latitude [Malin, M., Edgett, K., 2000. Science 288, 2330 - 2335] are the nearest candidate, but the source (and nature) of the gully carving agent remains controversial [e. g., Musselwhite, D. S., Swindle, T. D., Lunine, J. I., 2001. Geophys. Res. Lett. 28, 1283 - 1285; Mellon, M. T., Phillips, R. J., 2001. J. Geophys. Res. 106, 1 - 15; Knauth, L. P., Burt, D. M., 2002. Icarus 158, 267 - 271; Costard, F., Forget, F., Mangold, N., Peulvast, J. P., 2002. Science 295, 110 - 113; Christensen, P. R., 2003. Nature 422, 45 - 48; Treiman, A. H., 2003. J. Geophys. Res. 108]. At higher obliquity than the present epoch, near-surface ground ice should be present globally [Mellon, M. T., Jakosky, B. M., 1995. J. Geophys. Res. 100 (E 6), 11781 - 11799], populated by condensation of atmospheric water vapour in the top few metres of the regolith, or emplaced as dusty ice sheets reaching down towards the equator. The latitudinal restriction of these gullies to regions poleward of +/- 30 degrees appears to argue against a thaw component to their formation-since ground ice is present and stable at all latitudes at high obliquity, the current (low) obliquity regime should result in ground ice thaw at low latitudes, where insolation and daytime temperatures are currently greatest, and this is not observed. A previously undescribed meltwater sequence in the Cerberus plains, at 20 degrees N/ 187 degrees E, shows that comparable, but much more continuous, and mappable melting and surface runoff have occurred in the geologically recent past at near-equatorial latitudes on Mars. Polygonal ground in the Cerberus plains is seen by the Mars Global Surveyor Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) to suffer sequential, regional-scale volatile-loss consistent with thaw of near-surface ground ice under periglacial conditions. This degradation is continuously sampled by a single MOC strip, showing an icy landscape undergoing thaw modification and collapse, and may form the first evidence of equatorial wet-based glaciation during late Amazonian time, with indications of melting within the last million years. The dissolution and re-formation of polygonal <b>ground</b> <b>links</b> this landform to freeze-thaw processes, providing the conclusion to a question that {{has been the subject of}} debate for three decades-whether Mars' polygonal grounds require ice to form-and a consistent explanation for the fate of the water that carved the great outflow channels, much of which may still reside as ground ice in the regolith. This thaw occurs in the Cerberus Formation; deposits that are considered to be magmatic in origin, and the type formation for late-stage, "plains-style" volcanism on Mars [Keszthelyi, L., McEwen, A. S., Thordarson T., 2000. J. Geophys. Res. 105, 15027 - 15049]. By superposing large numbers of small impact craters, polygonal ground in the Cerberus plains sustains previous suggestions of a non-magmatic origin for this and other landforms in the region [Page, D. P., Murray, J. B., 2006. Icarus 183, 46 - 54]. Together, these periglacial landforms document evidence of climate change much younger than is currently recognised by crater counts, with important implications for age constraints on young surfaces and absolute age determinations by this method. It is tentatively suggested that this melting may be Occurring today, with a striking correspondence between permafrost thaw in the Cerberus plains, the high atmospheric methane flux currently observed over this region [Mumma, M. J., Noak, R. E., DiSanti, M. A., Bonev, B. P., Dello Russo, N., 2004. Bull. Am. Astron. Soc. 36, 1127; Krasnopolsky, V. A., Maillard, J. P., Owen, T. C., 2004.

Science 306, 1758 - 1761], and the only latitude zone on Mars-equatorward of 30 degrees N-where melting of ground ice is thought possible in the current climate [Haberle, R. M., McKay, C. P., Schaeffer, J., Cabrol, N. A., Grin, E. A., Zent, A. P., Quinn, R., 2001. J. Geophys. Res. 106 (E 10), 23317 - 23326; Lobitz, B., Wood, B. L., Averner, M. M., McKay, C. P., 2001. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 98, 2132 - 2137]. Low-latitude polygonal ground as transient, and hydrologically active over wide areas transforms our understanding of the recent climatic evolution of Mars, supporting models of atmospheric water-ice migration [Mischna, M., Richardson, M.
