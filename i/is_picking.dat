25|$|Many, perhaps most, {{threaded}} parts {{have potential}} to be generated via additive manufacturing (3D printing), {{of which there are}} many variants, including fused deposition modeling, selective laser sintering, direct metal laser sintering, selective laser melting, electron beam melting, layered object manufacturing, and stereolithography. For most additive technologies, it has not been long since they emerged from the laboratory end of their historical development, but further commercialization <b>is</b> <b>picking</b> up speed. To date, most additive methods tend to produce a rough surface finish and tend to be restricted in the material properties that they can produce, and thus their earliest commercial victories have been in parts for which those restrictions were acceptable. However, the capabilities are continually growing.|$|E
25|$|Before 2011, a cab's {{availability}} {{was indicated}} by {{the lights on the}} top of the car. When no lights were lit, the cab would be occupied by passengers. When just the center light showing the medallion number was lit, the cab would be empty and available. When the OFF and DUTY inscriptions to either side of the medallion number were lit, with the medallion number off, the cab would be off duty and not accepting passengers. However, when the OFF and DUTY inscriptions were lit and the medallion number was still lit, the cab would be off duty but the driver could choose to pick up passengers heading in the same direction as the driver. In fall 2011, the TLC announced a plan to replace the three-light system with a simple indicator as to whether the taxi is available. In 2012, the TLC simplified the light system further, with a lit roof light indicating that the taxi is available and an unlit light indicating that the taxi is not available, regardless of whether it has passengers or is simply off duty. It also started fining drivers $100 for picking up passengers without the light on, except for if the driver <b>is</b> <b>picking</b> up their last passenger of their shift.|$|E

500|$|A {{sequel to}} God of War was first teased {{at the end}} of its credits, which stated, [...] "Kratos Will Return". God of War II was officially {{announced}} at the 2006 Game Developers Conference (GDC). God of War Game Director David Jaffe stepped down and became the Creative Director of its sequel. God of Wars lead animator Cory Barlog assumed the role of Game Director. In an interview with Computer and Video Games (CVG) in June 2006, Barlog said that while working on the first few drafts of script, he studied the mythology extensively. He said that the mythology is so large that [...] "the real difficulty <b>is</b> <b>picking</b> things that really fit within the story of Kratos as well as being easy to swallow for audiences." [...] Although he loves the idea of teaching things through storytelling (in this case Greek mythology), Barlog said, [...] "you can't let your story get bogged down by that." [...] He said that in the game, players would see [...] "a larger view of Kratos' role within the mythological world." [...] He also said that he liked the idea of a trilogy, but there were no plans [...] "as of right now." ...|$|E
500|$|Objects {{that are}} smaller than the katamari will stick to it when the player comes into contact with them, while greater objects can be hurdles; colliding at high speed with any may cause objects to fall off the katamari, slowing the player's progress. The game uses size, weight, and surface area to {{determine}} if an object will stick to the katamari. [...] This allows slender objects, such as pencils, that are longer than the katamari is wide, to be picked up, and these will alter how the katamari rolls until more objects are picked up. [...] Animals such as cats will chase the katamari, knocking things from it, but once the katamari is great enough, it will scare the animals away, {{and they can be}} rolled up once they are chased down. As objects stick to the katamari, the katamari will grow, eventually allowing objects that were once hurdles to be picked up, and creating access to areas that were formerly blocked. [...] In this manner, the player might start the game by picking up thumbtacks and ants, and slowly work up {{to the point where the}} katamari <b>is</b> <b>picking</b> up buildings, mountains, and clouds.|$|E

500|$|Recording of {{the album}} began September 6, 2010, lasting for eleven weeks, each one {{focusing}} on a particular song, something Vig stated [...] "was good because each song kinda had its own life". The recordings started with Grohl's rhythm guitar and Taylor Hawkins' drumming to provide the foundations and see if both could [...] "lock in". Hawkins usually played for hours before he got [...] "a drum track I'd be proud of". Click tracks were used, but Vig {{said that there was}} not a worry for the drums to follow it exactly as they [...] "wanted it to groove" [...] and [...] "we realized that when everything is off just a few milliseconds, the sound gets wider and thicker." [...] After the guitar and drum track, Mendel would play his basslines, which were practiced enough for them to be recorded perfectly on the first take. The following day, Shiflett and Smear would play guitars, with the latter being the last and usually being given a baritone guitar to have a different sound from the other guitarists. After the instrumental backing was ready, Grohl did the vocals either on the control room or the isolation booth. As Grohl wanted the songs [...] "to have maximum emotional potential", the vocals were screamed to the point he had headaches—"when the mic <b>is</b> <b>picking</b> up every tiny inconsistency, you really strain to make it sound right." ...|$|E
500|$|Three days later, it was {{reported}} that Marvel was looking at Alan Taylor and Daniel Minahan as prospective directors to replace Jenkins, and were also in the midst of hiring a writer to rewrite Don Payne's script, with the shortlist of possible writers consisting of John Collee, Robert Rodat, and Roger Avary. At the end of the month, Alan Taylor, best known for directing episodes of the HBO fantasy series Game of Thrones, was chosen to direct the sequel. Feige mentioned Taylor's work on the series Mad Men, Boardwalk Empire and Game of Thrones as reasons for his hiring, saying [...] "With Alan's direction we got a few more layers of patina, of texture, of reality into our golden realm." [...] By January 10, Marvel Studios had commissioned screenwriter Robert Rodat to rewrite the sequel and Hiddleston stated that filming was expected to begin in London in the summer of 2012. Hemsworth later confirmed that filming was scheduled to begin in August. Hemsworth also revealed that the film would have a more Viking-influenced feel, elaborating [...] "I think the science fiction element to Thor… the danger is it falls a little bit into the world of it's 'tough to throw a light to.' I think of big waterfalls and mountains and a Viking influence, where the Norse mythology kind of grew from. Having that in Asgard {{is going to make it}} all the more special and that's what Alan [...] wants to bring to it." [...] Feige said [...] "while the relationship between Loki and Thor certainly has changed [...] and has progressed, a lot of Thor 2 <b>is</b> <b>picking</b> up where it left off in terms of Jane, who you just saw for a moment on a computer monitor, and also what's been going on in the nine realms without the Asgardians being able to use the Bifrost." [...] Feige also said that while Loki has a part, [...] "there will be a different villain, another big villain".|$|E

2500|$|The {{first step}} in making raw or ripened pu'er <b>is</b> <b>picking</b> {{appropriate}} tender leaves. Plucked leaves are handled gingerly to prevent bruising and unwanted oxidation.

If so, the leaves would be spread out in the sun, weather permitting, or a ventilated space to wilt and remove some of the water content. On overcast or rainy days, the leaves will be wilted by light heating, a slight difference in processing that will affect the quality of the resulting maocha and pu'er.|$|E

2500|$|A {{feedback}} suppressor detects unwanted audio feedback and suppresses it, typically by automatically inserting a notch filter into the signal {{path of the}} system, which prevents feedback [...] "howls" [...] from occurring. Audio feedback can create unwanted loud, screaming noises which are disruptive to the performance, and which can damage performers' and audience members' ears and speakers. Audio feedback from microphones occurs when a microphone [...] "hears" [...] the sound it <b>is</b> <b>picking</b> up through the monitor speakers or the main speakers. While microphone audio feedback is almost universally regarded as a negative phenomenon, in hard rock and heavy metal music, electric guitarists purposely create guitar feedback to create unique, sustained sounds with their guitar and guitar amplifier. This type of feedback is sought out by guitarists, so the sound engineer does not try to prevent it.|$|E
