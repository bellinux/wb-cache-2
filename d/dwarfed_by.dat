5|$|Downtown Amman, {{the city}} centre area (known in Arabic as Al-Balad), has been <b>dwarfed</b> <b>by</b> the {{sprawling}} urban area that surrounds it.

Jabal Amman also contains the famous Rainbow Street and the cultural Souk Jara market.|$|E
5|$|Major {{construction}} at Tikal was already {{taking place in}} the Late Preclassic period, first appearing around 400–300 BC, including the building of major pyramids and platforms, although the city was still <b>dwarfed</b> <b>by</b> sites further north such as El Mirador and Nakbe. At this time, Tikal participated in the widespread Chikanel culture that dominated the Central and Northern Maya areas at this time – a region that included the entire Yucatan Peninsula including northern and eastern Guatemala and all of Belize.|$|E

5|$|On 10 May 1940, Germany invaded France. By that time, the BEF {{consisted}} of 10 infantry divisions in three corps, a tank brigade and a Royal Air Force detachment of around 500 aircraft. The BEF was pinned by a German diversionary attack through Belgium and then isolated {{by the main}} attack that came through the Ardennes forest. Well-equipped and highly mobile Panzer divisions of the Wehrmacht overran the French and then British prepared defences. There was some fierce fighting, however being <b>dwarfed</b> <b>by</b> the German land forces most of the BEF withdrew to a small area around the French port of Dunkirk.|$|E
5|$|The Condor Legion spearheaded many Nationalist victories, {{particularly}} providing air dominance from 1937 onwards; 300 air-to-air victories were claimed, {{although this}} was <b>dwarfed</b> <b>by</b> some 900 claimed by Italian forces. Spain provided a proving ground for German tank tactics, {{as well as}} aircraft tactics, the latter being only moderately successful. The air superiority which allowed {{certain parts of the}} Legion to excel would be replicated {{in the first year of}} World War II, until ultimately failing to prevail in the Battle of Britain.|$|E
5|$|Initially the {{shallower}} pits at Aberdare {{proved a}} bigger attraction for prospective mine owners, but once Aberdare became fully worked by the 1860s the Rhondda saw a {{rapid growth in}} development. During the 1860s-1870s 20 collieries opened in the Rhondda Valleys with the leading coalowner in the Rhondda Fach being David Davis of Aberdare, and David Davies in the Rhondda Fawr. In 1865 the output of coal from the Rhondda Valley was roughly one quarter of that of Aberdare; ten years later the Rhondda was producing over two million tons, more than the Aberdare Valleys. These figures would later be <b>dwarfed</b> <b>by</b> the massive excavation rates {{seen in the last}} quarter of the 19th century up to the beginning of the First World War. In 1913 it was recorded that the Rhondda Valley's output was 9.6 million tons.|$|E

5|$|The {{neutral theory}} of {{molecular}} evolution proposed that most evolutionary changes {{are the result}} of the fixation of neutral mutations by genetic drift. Hence, in this model, most genetic changes in a population {{are the result of}} constant mutation pressure and genetic drift. This form of the neutral theory is now largely abandoned, since {{it does not seem to}} fit the genetic variation seen in nature. However, a more recent and better-supported version of this model is the nearly neutral theory, where a mutation that would be effectively neutral in a small population is not necessarily neutral in a large population. Other alternative theories propose that genetic drift is <b>dwarfed</b> <b>by</b> other stochastic forces in evolution, such as genetic hitchhiking, also known as genetic draft.|$|E
5|$|All {{day train}} service was {{restored}} from Burlington to Whitby, and peak service was finally brought to Oshawa in 2000, {{but this would}} be only one indicator of things to come. A large initiative to expand the GO Transit network in the mid-2000s under the GO Transit Rail Improvement Plan, or GO TRIP. $1 billion was invested in multiple rail and bus projects, making it the largest commuter rail project in Canadian history. This was later <b>dwarfed</b> <b>by</b> a further slate of new GO infrastructure proposed in MoveOntario 2020, the provincial transit plan announced by Premier Dalton McGuinty in the leadup to the 2007 provincial election. With significant re-investment in regional transit, GO experienced significant growth in its train network: all day service was restored to Oshawa in 2006 and Aldershot in 2007; service was expanded to Barrie South in 2007, to Lincolnville in 2008 and to Kitchener in 2011; and an excursion train now operates on summer weekends to Niagara Falls.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the evening, key {{warships}} {{that remained}} in government hands included Bahias sister , the aging cruiser , and the eight new destroyers of the Pará class. Their potential power, however, was <b>dwarfed</b> <b>by</b> the dreadnoughts—each of which outgunned all of the warships alone—and was severely tempered by personnel issues. First, naval officers were suspicious of even the enlisted men who remained loyal to the government. Officers took over all of the positions that would be involved in direct combat, and the numbers of enlisted men were reduced wherever possible. Further complicating matters were missing weapon components, such as the destroyer's torpedoes, which could not be fired without firing caps, yet the caps were not where they were supposed to be. When caps were finally located and delivered, they did not fit the newer torpedoes carried by the destroyers. The correct caps were fitted only two days after the rebellion began.|$|E

5|$|The {{conquest of}} Nanking had been quicker and easier than the Japanese had foreseen; they lost only 1,953 {{soldiers}} in battle, plus 4,994 wounded. Japan's casualties were undoubtedly <b>dwarfed</b> <b>by</b> those of China, though no precise figures exist {{on how many}} Chinese were killed in action. The Japanese claimed to have killed up to 84,000 enemies during the Nanking campaign whereas a contemporary Chinese source claimed that their army suffered 20,000 casualties. Masahiro Yamamoto noted that the Japanese usually inflated their opponent's body counts while the Chinese had reason to downplay the scale of their loss. Ikuhiko Hata estimates that 50,000 Chinese soldiers were killed in combat during the entire battle whereas Jay Taylor puts the number at 70,000 and states that proportionate {{to the size of}} the force committed, such losses were greater than those suffered in the devastating Battle of Shanghai. On the other hand, Chinese scholar Sun Zhaiwei estimates Chinese combat losses at 6,000 to 10,000 men.|$|E
5|$|The sauropods {{were the}} largest and {{heaviest}} dinosaurs. For much of the dinosaur era, the smallest sauropods were larger {{than anything else in}} their habitat, and the largest were an order of magnitude more massive than anything else that has since walked the Earth. Giant prehistoric mammals such as Paraceratherium (the largest land mammal ever) were <b>dwarfed</b> <b>by</b> the giant sauropods, and only modern whales approach or surpass them in size. There are several proposed advantages for the large size of sauropods, including protection from predation, reduction of energy use, and longevity, but {{it may be that the}} most important advantage was dietary. Large animals are more efficient at digestion than small animals, because food spends more time in their digestive systems. This also permits them to subsist on food with lower nutritive value than smaller animals. Sauropod remains are mostly found in rock formations interpreted as dry or seasonally dry, and the ability to eat large quantities of low-nutrient browse would have been advantageous in such environments.|$|E
5|$|The {{surviving}} Pipe roll from 1130 records {{an income}} of £24,500. This figure is <b>dwarfed</b> <b>by</b> the amount recorded on the Pipe roll that was actually owed to the king, which totals £68,850. The income that they record {{in the early years}} of Henry II is much smaller than that of the one surviving year for Henry I. Those early Pipe rolls of Henry I record an income about £10,000 to £15,000. By the end of Henry II's reign, royal income recorded in the Pipe rolls had risen to £20,000. The end of John's reign saw a recorded income of about £30,000, but Henry III's reign recorded only £8,000 in the early years, rising to £16,500 by 1225. Not only do the rolls from the early years of Henry II's reign show less income reaching the Exchequer than during Henry I's reign, those early rolls were haphazard and not as accurate and detailed as rolls dating from the later part of the reign. Nor are they as carefully produced as either the later rolls or the roll of 1130.|$|E

5|$|On {{the other}} hand, puffin numbers {{increased}} considerably {{in the late}} twentieth century in the North Sea, including on the Isle of May and the Farne Islands where numbers increased by about 10% per year. In the 2013 breeding season, nearly 40,000 pairs were recorded on the Farne Islands, a slight increase on the 2008 census and on the previous year's poor season when some of the burrows flooded. This number is <b>dwarfed</b> <b>by</b> the Icelandic colonies with five million pairs breeding, the Atlantic puffin being the most populous bird on the island. In the Westman Islands, where about half Iceland's puffins breed, the birds were almost driven to extinction by overharvesting around 1900 and a thirty-year ban on hunting was put in place. When stocks recovered, a different method of harvesting was used and now hunting is maintained at a sustainable level. Nevertheless, a further hunting ban covering the whole of Iceland was called for in 2011, although the puffin's lack of recent breeding success was being blamed on a diminution in food supply rather than overharvesting. Since 2000, a sharp population decline has been seen in Iceland, Norway, Faroe Islands and Greenland. A similar trend has been seen in the United Kingdom, where an increase in 1969-2000 appears to have been reversed. For example, the Fair Isle colony was estimated at 20,200 individuals in 1986, but it had been almost halved by 2012. Based on current trends, it is estimated that the European population will decline by 50-79% between 2000 and 2065.|$|E
