In 1979 upgrading work was done and the pit lane was extended past the first left-hand turn (Curva 1), making the corner more narrow, and the pit lane ended {{right in the middle of}} Curva 1 and 2. The present <b>design</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>track</b> dates back from 1990, when the original circuit was shortened from 7,829 m to only 4,397 m (so that it could fit the new FIA restrictions on track length). As a consequence of the reduction, the track lost three long straight sections and nine fast curves (5 were lost forever, 4 were made slower and are still there). The original track was full of fast corners and it allowed cars to keep maximum speed for up to twenty seconds [...] and was considered very dangerous (although no one ever died there whilst racing Formula One) and in 1990 the old layout was majorly revised. The new track still had a very long top-speed section that contained bumps, high-speed turns and little run-off area (though the track is very wide at this point).|$|E

40|$|The {{goal of this}} senior {{project was}} {{to come up with}} a structural-engineering-related {{schematic}} design for a roller coaster to be installed in Disneyland called TRON 2. 0 : The Experience. This involved looking at both design processes that we had already learned through our curriculum as well as researching concepts that were previously foreign to us, namely the dynamic application of loads and the effects of fatigue stresses. A story was established based on the source material: the TRON movies produced by Walt Disney Studios. Thematic elements from the story were used as the basis for design implications that would become necessary as the process continued. These design implication influenced the design of the Ride System, Track Layout, and Ride Vehicle Design. These factors would end up influencing applicable loads, which would be utilized in the <b>design</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Track</b> Layout. The site was chosen to be constructed on Disneyland proper so that realistic site parameters and dimensions would give a sense of scale to the project and eliminate ambiguity. However, existing elements on the site would cause challenges for us to work around. Once the site was chosen, Queue and Show buildings were designated simple designs to tie back to story-driven implications and reinforce the standards set by the Walt Disney Imagineering process model. In addition, we gained more information such as crowd capacity to dictate further mechanical design and dynamic applications. The mechanical side of the process saw the development of a ride system used to propel the Ride Vehicles, all designed by the Mechanical Engineers on the project. The Ride Vehicle weights became relevant for the <b>design</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>track.</b> A Track Layout was created and inputted into simulation software so that dynamic accelerations could be developed as new loading conditions for Track Design. Finally, all of the preceding elements of design were culminated into a schematic design of a roller coaster track making sure to account for subjects such as dynamic applications, torsion, and fatigue. All designs were replicated in modeling software to confirm constructability and viability of the resulting schematic design...|$|E
40|$|Dynamic {{wireless}} charging (DWC) of electric vehicles (EVs) is an emerging technology {{that could lead}} to the breakthrough of EVs. The technology is based on the inductive coupling between an electrified track deployed under the road surface and a pickup coil fitted in EV. This paper refers to a lumped track made of DD coils and is concerned with the <b>design</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>track</b> layout, namely coil dimension in the motion direction and track coil distance for a given energy requirement. This paper starts by comparing the coupling characteristics of DD coils with different dimensions by a finite-element method (FEM) analysis. Afterward, an analytical procedure is developed to establish the track coil distance able to transfer to a moving EV the propulsion energy required per unit of traveled space. The procedure utilizes the DD-coil coupling characteristics to calculate the power and, from it, the energy transferred from the track coils to the pickup coil along the track. Instrumental in the calculation is the definition of a parameter, denoted as track flux coverage, which gives the ratio between the dimension of the track coils in the motion direction and the coil distance; such a parameter corresponds to the percentage of road populated with track coils so that it is a cost index of the DWC system implementation. Effects of a lateral displacement of the EV motion from the line joining the track coil centers are also analyzed. Design findings are checked against the results obtained with a computer-assisted analysis...|$|E
40|$|The work {{covers the}} <b>design</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Track</b> Finder Processor {{in the high}} energy {{experiment}} CMS (Compact Muon Solenoid, planned for 2005) at CERN/Geneva. The task of this processor is to identify muons and measure their transverse momentum. The track finder processor {{makes it possible to}} determine the physical relevance of each high energetic collision and to forward only interesting data to the data an alysis units. Data of more than two hundred thousand detector cells are used to determine the location of muons and measure their transverse momentum. Each 25 ns a new data set is generated. Measurem ent of location and transverse momentum of the muons can be terminated within 350 ns by using an ASIC (Application Specific Integrated Circuit). A pipeline architecture processes new data sets with th e required data rate of 40 MHz to ensure dead time free operation. In the framework of this study specifications and the overall concept of the track finder processor were worked out in detail. Simul ations were performed in order to select the most appropriate measurement method and implementation technology. Already existing systems were evaluated and their specifications were compared with thos e of the track finder processor's. The classic method in high energy physics experiments is to search for predefined tracks or bit patterns in the measurement data and to determine their properties. T he predefined patterns are compared to the found patterns. The high number of data channels of the track finder processor and the complex requirements to the spatial detector resolution do not permit to employ a pattern comparison method. A so called track following algorithm was designed, which is able to assemble complete tracks through the whole detector starting from single track segments. Ins tead of storing a high number of track patterns an algorithm for track finding and momentum measurement is employed directly. This enables to realize a hardware implementation within the requirements given by the experiment. The algorithm was translated to the level of digital electronics. Comprehensive simulations, employing the hardware simulation language VHDL, were conducted in order to optimi ze the algorithm and its hardware implementation. An FPGA (field programmable gate array) -prototype and a test system was designed. A feasibility study to implement the track finder processor employin g ASICs was conducted. The study proves that the track finder processor can be implemented using today's technology...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, a {{procedure}} for the numerical simulation of train-bridge interaction is described. This {{is based on}} a finite element schematisation of the bridge (and possibly of the track) and on a multi-body schematisation of the railway vehicles. Wheel-rail contact forces are defined using a non-linear contact model which accounts for the main non-linear effects related to wheel-rail contact forces. The numerical procedure considers train-bridge interaction in both the vertical and horizontal plane. With reference to train ride safety and passenger comfort, the dynamic interaction model allows the analysis of the effect of global and local structure deformations on vehicle dynamics. When dealing with long span suspension bridges, in addition to the limits regarding global deformations during train passage, the structure must satisfy restrictive requirements concerning the effect on rail vehicle dynamics produced by structure deformations under wind loads. An example of numerical simulation for the case of an ETR 500 train crossing the Messina bridge at the maximum design speed, in the presence of extreme transversal wind conditions was reported. Another interesting example of global interaction analysis is that involving the identification of critical velocity phenomena. The train transit over a bridge generates a periodic excitation whose fundamental frequency depends on the speed and on the distance end-to-end between the coaches; as a consequence, resonance occurs if one of the excitation frequencies approaches one of the bridge's natural frequencies. While this phenomenon is generally negligible in long span bridges, it is particularly interesting for smaller bridges, like the bow-arch bridge considered in the paper as the second case study. Local interaction phenomena involve bridge and track deformations having a scale much smaller than that of the complete bridge. Although being of small entity, local deformations play a key role with respect to the cyclic dynamic stresses induced in the bridge structural elements by repeated train passages and the generation of structural noise and vibrations. One key issue is the <b>design</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>track</b> system. An example is presented referring to the comparison of two design alternatives for the Messina bridge track system: a conventional design with rails resting on timber sleepers and an innovative embedded rail system. The analysis was performed by comparing the two design solutions in terms of forces and vibrations locally transmitted to the deck. A numerical-experimental comparison is reported {{at the end of the}} paper, which refers to the measurements taken on a bow-arch bridge on the Milano-Torino high speed line, crossed by a test train at the maximum speed of 280 km/h. The comparison demonstrates the reliability of the developed train-bridge interaction model in reproducing both bridge accelerations and stresses...|$|E
