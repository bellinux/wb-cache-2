5|$|The United States' {{involvement}} in World War <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>as</b> a neutral party {{for most of}} the war, but included the deployment of expeditionary forces {{towards the end of the}} war.

5|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>as</b> {{student in}} the sixties, engaged {{in the civil rights}} movement, anti-Vietnam War protests. I'd come from New York to attend the University of Wisconsin. It was an {{exciting}} time. A lot of active students wound up in different cities and communities as organizers. I chose Racine, Wisconsin. I spent three years there. We had developed a legal clinic and we had a whole health program, but the city was too small. I had, of course, heard about Uptown in Chicago, and the challenges. So I wound up here in 1976. I waited tables. I did photography, took pictures for attorneys. Ultimately we started our own print shop in order to print our own newspapers and magazines.|$|E
25|$|When I saw Going My Way <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>as</b> {{moved as}} they were by the {{character}} he played. Father O'Malley handled that gang of young hooligans in his parish with such kindness and wisdom that I thought he was wonderful too. Instead of coming {{down hard on the}} kids and withdrawing his affection, he forgave them their misdeeds, took them to the ball game and picture show, taught them how to sing. By the last reel, the sheer persistence of his goodness had transformed even the worst of them into solid citizens. Then the lights came on and the movie was over. All {{the way back to the}} house I thought about the difference between the person up there on the screen and the one I knew at home.|$|E

500|$|As a vocalist, Rollins {{has adopted}} a number of styles through the years. He was noted in the Washington, D.C. {{hardcore}} scene for what journalist Michael Azerrad described as a [...] "compelling, raspy howl." [...] With State of Alert, Rollins [...] "spat out the lyrics like a bellicose auctioneer." [...] He adopted a similar style after joining Black Flag in 1981. By their album Damaged, however, Black Flag began to incorporate a swing beat into their style. Rollins then abandoned his State of Alert [...] "bark" [...] and adopted the band's swing. Rollins later explained: [...] "What I was doing kind of matched the vibe of the music. The music was intense and, well, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>as</b> intense as you needed." ...|$|E
500|$|Tynan {{remarked to}} Olivier, [...] "you aren't really a contemplative or {{philosophical}} actor"; Olivier {{was known for}} the strenuous physicality of his performances in some roles. He told Tynan this {{was because he was}} influenced as a young man by Douglas Fairbanks, Ramon Navarro and John Barrymore in films, and Barrymore on stage as Hamlet: [...] "tremendously athletic. I admired that greatly, all of us did.... One thought of oneself, idiotically, skinny as <b>I</b> <b>was,</b> <b>as</b> a sort of Tarzan." [...] According to Morley, Gielgud was widely considered [...] "the best actor in the world from the neck up and Olivier from the neck down." [...] Olivier described the contrast thus: [...] "I've always thought that we were the reverses of the same coin... the top half John, all spirituality, all beauty, all abstract things; and myself as all earth, blood, humanity." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1931, Heyer {{released}} The Conqueror, {{her first}} novel of historical fiction to give a fictionalized account of real historical events. She researched the life of William the Conqueror thoroughly, even travelling the route that William took when crossing into England. The following year, Heyer's writing took an even more drastic departure from her early historical romances when she released her first thriller, Footsteps in the Dark. The novel's publication coincided {{with the birth of}} her only child, Richard George Rougier, whom she called her [...] "most notable (indeed peerless) work". Later in her life, Heyer requested that her publishers refrain from reprinting Footsteps in the Dark, saying [...] "This work, published simultaneously with my son... was the first of my thrillers and was perpetuated while <b>I</b> <b>was,</b> <b>as</b> any Regency character would have said, increasing. One husband and two ribald brothers all had fingers in it, and I do not claim it as a Major Work." ...|$|E
500|$|Press {{framing of}} Reagan changed {{from that of}} just helpmate and {{protector}} to someone with hidden power. As {{the image of her}} as a political interloper grew, she sought to explicitly deny that she was the power behind the throne. At the end of her time as First Lady, however, she said that her husband had not been well-served by his staff. She acknowledged her role in reaction in influencing him on personnel decisions, saying [...] "In no way do I apologize for it." [...] She wrote in her memoirs, [...] "I don't think <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>as</b> bad, or as extreme in my power or my weakness, as I was depicted," [...] but went on, [...] "However the first lady fits in, she has a unique and important role to play in looking after her husband. And it's only natural that she'll let him know what she thinks. I always did that for Ronnie, and I always will." ...|$|E
500|$|On 27 April 2006, the BBC {{announced}} the commissioning of Holby Blue, a police procedural spin-off from Holby City created by Tony Jordan. Jordan contemplated that [...] "soap snobs" [...] {{may hold the}} series in disdain for using the Holby brand, but concluded: [...] "After much thought, I remembered who <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>as</b> a writer, the joy I take from surprising an audience, by subverting expectation – and HolbyBlue was born." [...] Holby City was moved to Thursdays {{for the duration of}} HolbyBlue first series, with the spin-off broadcast on Tuesday nights at 8pm. A two-part crossover episode with Holby City was developed for the beginning of the show's second series, broadcast in 2008. The episodes were written by McHale and Jordan, and saw Holby City registrar Jac Naylor accused of murder. Yorke compared the crossover to the American CSI franchise, in that: [...] "You really believe it's a world." [...] While the second series attracted 5.6million viewers with its opening episode, by the end of May 2008 viewership had fallen to 2.5million. In August 2008, the BBC announced that due to declining ratings, Holby Blue would not be recommissioned for a third series.|$|E

500|$|Tolkien {{had been}} writing The Lord of the Rings {{for several years}} when Saruman came into {{existence}} as the solution to a long-unresolved plot development, and his role and characteristics continued {{to emerge in the}} course of writing. Tolkien started work on the book in late 1937, but was initially unsure of how the story would develop. Unlike some of the other characters in the book, Saruman had not appeared in Tolkien's 1937 novel, The Hobbit, or in his then-unpublished Quenta Silmarillion and related mythology, which date back to 1917. When he wrote of Gandalf’s failure to meet Frodo, Tolkien did not know what had caused it and later said: [...] "Most disquieting of all, Saruman had never been revealed to me, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>as</b> concerned as Frodo at Gandalf's failure to appear." [...] Tolkien's son, Christopher, has said that {{the early stages of the}} creation of The Lord of the Rings proceeded in a series of waves, and that having produced the first half of The Fellowship of the Ring, Tolkien rewrote the tale from the start three times. Saruman first appeared during a fourth phase of writing in a rough narrative outline dated August 1940. Intended to account for Gandalf's absence, it describes how a wizard titled [...] "Saramond the White" [...] or [...] "Saramund the Grey", who has fallen under the influence of Sauron, lures Gandalf to his stronghold and traps him. The full story of Saruman's betrayal was later added to the existing chapters.|$|E
500|$|Against the Penguins in the Patrick Division Final, Hextall's {{performances}} were mixed: he under-performed {{early in the}} series, and in game five was swapped out of the net and then reinstated twice during a 10–7defeat for the Flyers. Hextall faced 17shots in the game, conceding nine of the Penguins goals. After the game, he denied being out of control, despite having assaulted one of the officials and chasing Rob Brown around the ice. He said, [...] "I like to think I'm strong mentally. Hey, if <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>as</b> out of control as people say I am, I wouldn't be in the National Hockey League." [...] The Penguins coach, Gene Ubriaco, agreed with Hextall's assessment, and believed the goaltender lost control intentionally: [...] "He uses a loss of control to his advantage, in a way. He's the extreme example of controlled violence. And they [...] live and die with it." [...] The Flyers won the next game to force a decider, but Hextall was ruled out of the contest with a first degree sprain of the medial collateral ligament (MCL) in his right knee. Hextall's injury {{kept him out of}} the first three games of the series against the Canadiens, during which the Canadiens took a 2–1 lead. He returned for the fourth game, but could not prevent his side losing 3–0. The Flyers won the following game to extend the series to six games, but lost the next game 4–2, and were eliminated. Hextall displayed his violent side during the final minutes of game six, skating out of his crease to attack Chris Chelios. Hextall claimed that the attack was in retaliation for Chelios' hit on his Flyer teammate Brian Propp in game one, when Chelios caught Flyer Propp with a [...] "flying elbow" [...] {{to the side of the}} head, rendering him unconscious. Hextall was given a 12-game suspension for his actions, at the beginning of the 1989–90 season. Following the announcement of the suspension, Hextall stated his disappointment, and added that his intention was to fight rather than hurt Chelios.|$|E
