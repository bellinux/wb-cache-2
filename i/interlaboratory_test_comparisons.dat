40|$|Introduction. Activities of FSBI “VIMS” {{are aimed}} at {{ensuring}} accuracy and comparability {{of the results of}} mineralogical analyses accompanying exploration and technological work. Evaluation of the research result quality is carried out with the help of various metrological instruments, one of which is an <b>interlaboratory</b> <b>comparison</b> <b>test.</b> Purpose. The purpose of <b>interlaboratory</b> <b>comparison</b> <b>tests</b> (ICTs) is to assess the results of X-ray quantitative phase analysis of an artificial mixture of minerals and to confirm the level of competence of testing laboratories. Methods. The procedure for conducting <b>interlaboratory</b> <b>comparison</b> <b>tests</b> is as follows: development of the programme and its approval; collecting and registering applications from laboratories, willing to participate in the ICT programme; preparation and simultaneous sending of control samples with accompanying information materials to those participating in the experiment; statistical processing of obtained results; drawing up, approval and circulation of documents confirming participation of the laboratories. The control sample is a homogenized artificial mixture of minerals (quartz, kaolinite, calcite and pyrite). The accuracy (quality) control of test results was carried out by X-ray quantitative phase analysis. Results. The ICT results showed a high level of competence of testing laboratories. For unreliable and unsatisfactory results percentages total less than 11 %, the percentage for unfulfilled results is equal to zero. <b>Interlaboratory</b> <b>comparison</b> <b>tests</b> in mineralogical works are an important means for controlling competence of testing laboratories. </p...|$|R

30|$|The {{final test}} design {{should be in}} line with the {{recommendations}} of EFSA for testing non-target organisms [12] and must ensure sufficient statistical power to detect the relevant effect level [36]. To do so, the Federal Agency for Nature Conservation commissioned a follow-up R&D project starting in 2018, which will amend the current test design and perform <b>interlaboratory</b> <b>comparison</b> <b>tests</b> followed by a full ring test [35]. Although B. impatiens would be a suitable test species, the new project aims to adapt the test procedure to Lycoriella castanescens (Diptera: Sciaridae) which is abundant in agricultural fields and therefore more relevant for the risk assessment. In the course of this follow-up project, the method will also be applied for the assessment of actual GMP material. Assuming that the results from the ring test confirm the replicability, sensitivity, practicability, and robustness of the new test method, either an OECD guideline or a guidance document will be prepared.|$|R

40|$|Chromium {{occurs in}} soils in the {{oxidation}} numbers III and VI. While Cr(III) {{is an essential}} nutrient, Cr(VI) is cancerogen. Starting with a photometrically DIN-method for the determination of Cr(VI) in water and waste water, a method for the determination of soluble Cr(VI) in soils was developed and optimized. The soil is extracted with phosphate-buffered aluminium sulfate solution. For the prevention of interfering redox reactions oxidizing compounds are reduced using sulfite and reducing compounds are oxidized by hypochlorite. The determination of Cr(VI) at 550 nm is performed after reaction with 1, 5 -diphenylcarbazide. Cr(VI) -concentrations of 0, 2 - 25 mg/kg in soils are detectable. With the optimized method soils were investigated which contained different amounts of Cr(III) and Cr(VI). While anthropogenically chromium-contaminated soils showed relatively high amounts of Cr(VI), only traces of Cr(VI) were detectable in soils with geogenic chromium. In the frame of this R and D-project a <b>interlaboratory</b> <b>comparison</b> <b>test</b> was performed {{for the evaluation of}} the method in different laboratories. The result proves the reproducibility of the method and forms the base for a standardization of the procedure. (orig.)

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a test programme to validate the Dutch pre-normative protocol NVN 5623 'Radioactivity measurements: Determination of the activity of gamma-ray emitting nuclides in a counting sample by means of semi-conductor gamma-spectrometry'. Batches of two reference materials. water and sand. both spiked with radionuclides (Ba- 133, Cs- 134, Cs- 137, K- 40, Co- 57 and Co- 60) were used in an intra- and <b>interlaboratory</b> <b>test.</b> For the water and sand, 10 and 9 laboratories, respectively, agreed to analyse three samples of each reference material strictly according to the pre-normative protocol. The <b>interlaboratory</b> <b>test</b> programme showed that for both reference materials the values for the reproducibility standard deviation were 1. 5 - 6 times larger than those for the repeatability standard deviation. This extra variation is caused by the parameter 'laboratory. For both reference materials the repeatability standard deviation was found in the range 0. 9 - 2. 0 % of the mean activity concentration: the reproducibility standard deviation ranged from 2. 5 - 6. 0 %. Bias of the test method was found for Cs- 134 (- 6. 8 %) and Ba- 133 (- 2. 3 %) in case of the spiked water and for Cs- 134 (- 7. 8 %) in case of the spiked sand. This bias is attributed to no or insufficient correction for coincidence summing. In general, the <b>interlaboratory</b> <b>test</b> showed satisfactory agreement between laboratories, In the light of regulations on radioactivity in materials it is concluded that for measurement of this activity the Dutch protocol may serve as a blueprint for an (European Community) protocol.

40|$|Livestock {{facilities}} have historically generated public concerns {{due to their}} emissions of odorous air and various chemical pollutants. Odor emission factors and identification of principal odorous chemicals are needed {{to better understand the}} problem. Applications of odor emission factors include inputs to odor setback models, while chemical emission factors may be compared with regulation thresholds as a means of demonstrating potential health impacts. A companion study of the National Air Emissions Monitoring Study (NAEMS) included measurements necessary for establishing odor and chemical emission factors for confined animal feeding operations. This additional investigation was conducted by the University of Minnesota, Iowa State University, West Texas A 2 ̆ 6 M Agri-Life Center, and Purdue University. The objectives were to (1) determine odor emission rates across swine and dairy facilities and seasons using common protocols and standardized olfactometry methods, (2) develop a chemical library of the most significant odorants, and (3) correlate the chemical library with the olfactometry results. This document describes the sampling and quality assurance methods used in the measurement and evaluation of odor and chemical samples collected at two freestall dairy farms, one sow (gestation/farrowing) facility, and one finishing pig site. Odor samples were collected in Tedlar bags and chemical samples were collected in sorbent tubes at barn inlet and exhaust locations using the NAEMS multiple-location gas sampling systems. Quality assurance protocols included <b>interlaboratory</b> <b>comparison</b> <b>tests,</b> which were evaluated to identify variations between olfactometry labs.

An <b>interlaboratory</b> <b>test,</b> carried out in 2003, has shown that bond strength tests of samples that were joined by different institutions in accordance to DIN EN 582 lead to bond strength values that varied by the factor 2, even if the same adhesive was used.

It was also clarified that the DIN standard needs to be supplemented in order to improve the comparability and the reproducibility of the bond strength test results.
