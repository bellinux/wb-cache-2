In {{order to}} protect the {{occupational}} health and safety of migrant workers, government has developed a series of regulations, policies, and requires enterprises to pay injury insurance costs for migrant workers. Most of migrant workers concentrate in small and medium enterprises (SME’s). The intrinsic motivation that SMEs will pay the cost of <b>industrial</b> <b>injury</b> <b>insurance</b> for migrant workers is not strong. The migrant workers also do not want SMEs to pay the costs. Therefore, proceeding from the fundamental interests of the SMEs and migrant workers, the article is based on Evolutionary Game approach and analyzes the evolution paths of SMEs ’ behaviors. The research provides the reliable theory reference for Chinese government to adjust the <b>industrial</b> <b>injury</b> <b>insurance</b> policy and protect the occupational health and safety of migrant workers’...|$|E

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this thesis is to analyse the {{possibilities}} and problems facing a privatised work <b>injury</b> <b>insurance.</b> This discussion includes the element of premium differentiation. Todays´ Swedish social insurance system is ineffectively formed. The costs have dramatically increased during the 1990 ´s. The Swedish government is now {{looking for ways to}} improve the efficiency of the system. The work <b>injury</b> <b>insurance</b> has not followed this pattern of increased costs. On the other hand there are reasons to believe that many of the costs derived from work injuries have been allocated o burden other social insurance. This is one of the distortions in which the system results. With focus on a privately financed work <b>injury</b> <b>insurance</b> the aim is to increase the fairness of the social insurance system. The allocation of cost burdens on the right party is included in this aim. It is believed that the motive of prevention for an injury to occur and the efforts in rehabilitation will improve when introducing a private work <b>injury</b> <b>insurance.</b> More responsibility is given to the insured, i. e. the employer. Private insurance companies can specialise and are, on a competitive market, able to keep the premiums on a fair price level. The conclusion is that efficiency can, in several aspects, increase when introducing a privately financed work <b>injury</b> <b>insurance...</b>|$|R

In 1968, various steps were taken to reduce the severity with which the [...] "wage-stop" [...] operated, a regressive mechanism which restricted the amount of assistance payable to an unemployed person. For miners, the Coal Industry Act 1965 introduced aid towards severance payments for miners about to be made redundant or for the vocational retraining of staff, while the Coal Industry Act 1967 provided subsidisation of redundancy and early retirement.
