40|$|Transposons (TEs) shape genomes via {{recombination}} and transposition, lead to chromosomal rearrangements, {{create new}} gene neighbourhoods and alter gene expression. They play key roles in adaptation either to symbiosis in Amanita genus or to pathogenicity in Pyrenophora tritici-repentis. Despite growing {{evidence of their}} importance, the abundance and distribution of mobile elements replicating in a “cut and paste” fashion is barely described so far. In order to improve our knowledge on this old and ubiquitous class of transposable elements, 1, 730 fungal genomes were scanned using both de novo and homology-based approaches. DNA TEs have been identified across the whole dataset and display uneven distribution from both DNA TE classification and fungal taxonomy perspectives. DNA TE content correlates with genome size, which confirms that many transposon families proliferate simultaneously. In contrast, it is independent from intron density, average <b>gene</b> <b>distance</b> and GC content.

40|$|Characterizing the {{functions}} of sequences in the human genome is crucial for the study and treatment of human disease. Though {{it is known that}} approximately 5 % of the human genome is conserved, about 40 % of these sequences have yet to be characterized, many of which may be important players in human disease pathways (1). Experimental and computational techniques have been developed which use histone modifications to segment the human genome into 25 different chromatin states, including states corresponding to various functional sequences like promoters and enhancers (4). However, the availability of this data is very limited, as these assays have been performed on a limited number of cell types, and the distribution of chromatin states varies across different cell types. We therefore took a computational rather than experimental approach to discovering regulatory regions.

The branching order of the clades suggested that the colonization of the islands by Hegeter politus proceeded from {{the southern part of}} Fuerteventura in a north-northeast direction to Lanzarote and the smaller islands. Based on this, a colonization scenario compatible with the reported geological ages and volcanisms of the various parts of the islands has been proposed. The high divergence of the beetles collected from the extreme south of Fuerteventura (the Jandía peninsula) from all other samples has led us to propose that they may be from a new species that has not been described previously. The ecological isolation of Jandía from the rest of Fuerteventura by the sand dunes that cover its narrow isthmus in the north, and the existence of many plant and animal endemisms unique to Jandía, lend supportive evidence to our proposal. The similarities between the evolution of island endemics in the Hawaiian and Canary archipelagos have been discussed. We conclude that many endemics in the Canary archipelago, like the Hawaiian Islands, are most likely to have originated from post-colonization differentiation and divergence...|$|E

We have here taken a very strict definition of cluster as sets of physically adjacent genes that are highly coexpressed and form so-called local coexpression domains. The Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) genome was analyzed {{for the presence of}} such local coexpression domains to elucidate its functional characteristics. We used expression data sets that cover different experimental conditions, organs, tissues, and cells from the Massively Parallel Signature Sequencing repository and microarray data (Affymetrix) from a detailed root analysis.

The {{aim of this study}} was to gain a better understanding of their genomic features and relationship to other Mycoplasma species. The genome structure and dynamics of hemoplasmas were analyzed by evaluating gene synteny, adaptive evolution of paralogous gene families (PGF) and horizontal gene transfer (HGT). The Mollicutes class was then phylogenetically analyzed by constructing a distance matrix of the 16 S rRNA genes and a phylogenetic tree with 32 conserved, concatenated proteins. Our results suggest that the hemoplasmas have dynamic genomes. The genome size variation (from 547 to 1, 545 genes) indicates substantial gene gain/loss throughout evolution. Poorly conserved gene syntenies among hemoplasmas, positional shuffling of paralogous genes between strains, HGT, and codons under positive selection in PGFs were also observed.

We developed a new tool ComPhy, 'Composite Distance Phylogeny', based on a composite distance matrix calculated from the comparison of complete gene sets between genome pairs to produce a prokaryotic phylogeny. Results The composite distance between two genomes is defined by three components: <b>Gene</b> Dispersion <b>Distance</b> (GDD), Genome Breakpoint <b>Distance</b> (GBD) and <b>Gene</b> Content <b>Distance</b> (GCD). GDD quantifies the dispersion of orthologous genes along the genomic coordinates from one genome to another; GBD measures the shared breakpoints between two genomes; GCD measures the level of shared orthologs between two genomes. The phylogenetic tree is constructed from the composite distance matrix using a neighbor joining method. We tested our method on 9 datasets from 398 completely sequenced prokaryotic genomes. We have achieved above 90 % agreement in quartet topologies between the tree created by our method and the tree from the Bergey's taxonomy. In comparison to several other phylogenetic analysis methods, our method showed consistently better performance.

Isolated lissencephaly sequence (ILS), a human developmental disease characterized by a smooth cerebral surface (classical lissencephaly) and microscopic evidence of incomplete neuronal migration, {{is often associated with}} small deletions or translocations at chromosome 17 p 13. 3. Miller–Dieker syndrome (MDS) is associated with larger deletions of 17 p 13. 3 and consists of classical lissencephaly with additional phenotypes including facial abnormalities. We have isolated the murine homologs of three genes located inside and outside the MDS region: Lis 1, Mnt/Rox, and 14 - 3 - 3 ε. These genes are all located on mouse chromosome 11 B 2, as determined by metaphase FISH, and the relative order and approximate <b>gene</b> <b>distance</b> was determined by interphase FISH analysis.

Using the introduced VDE site, the orientation of this gene was determined by pulsed field gel electrophoresis and Southern blot analysis.

We have analysed six genes (Pif 1 A, Abi, Sqd, Yrt, Atpa and Fmr 1), located inside and outside three inversions of the O chromosome in European populations of Drosophila subobscura. Genetic differentiation was significant between inversions despite extensive recombination inside inverted regions, irrespective of <b>gene</b> <b>distance</b> to the inversion breakpoints. Surprisingly, the highest level of genetic differentiation between arrangements was found for the Atpa gene, which is located outside the O 1 and O 7 inversions. Two derived unrelated arrangements (O 3 + 4 + 1 and O 3 + 4 + 7) are nearly fixed for several amino acid substitutions at the Atpa gene that have been described to confer resistance in other species to the cardenolide ouabain, a plant toxin capable of blocking ATPases. Similarities in the Atpa variants, conferring ouabain resistance in both arrangements, {{may be the result of}} convergent substitution and be favoured in response to selective pressures presumably related to the presence of plants containing ouabain in the geographic locations where both inversions are present.

Genetic distances among these species are calculated to determine relative times of genetic divergence. The four extant species of Pollicipes have a Tethyan relict distribution that geographically borders that {{of many of the}} fossil records for the genus. Three of the living species of Pollicipes exhibit an eastern boundary distribution in either the Pacific or the Atlantic Oceans. However, Pollicipes polymerus differs by having a range into the high latitudes of the northern Pacific. Pollicipes elegans inhabits the tropical eastern Pacific Ocean. The third and fourth species, Pollicipes pollicipes and an undescribed Pollicipes from the Cape Verde Islands, live in the eastern Atlantic Ocean. Pollicipes aboriginalis, a fossil species from western Australia, and the closest known living relatives of Pollicipes, Capitulum mitella and Calantica spinosa, two West Pacific species, are relicts in what was the far eastern region of the Tethys Sea. Bayesian analysis of concatenated DNA sequence data from mitochondrial genes cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (CO 1) and ribosomal subunit 16 s (16 s), and nuclear gene histone subunit 3 (H 3) fragments support the hypothesis, initially based on morphological similarities, that the two eastern Atlantic species, P. pollicipes and an undescribed species of Pollicipes from the Cape Verde Islands, and P. elegans, the amphitropical eastern tropical Pacific species, are the most recently diverged of the four species in the genus. In addition to the molecular-level evidence for earlier divergence from the other three species of Pollicipes, P. polymerus differs from them morphologically. A single phylogenetic relationship among these three most closely related species of Pollicipes is not conclusively supported by the trees generated from the individual gene or combined DNA sequence data.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between the structure of genes and their expression {{is a relatively new}} aspect of genome organization and regulation. With more genome sequences and expression data becoming available, bioinformatics approaches can help the further elucidation of the relationships between gene structure and gene expression. This will contribute to our understanding of a yet deeper level of gene regulation in higher eukaryotes. This thesis focuses on two issues of genome organization in relationship to expression. The genomic configuration involved in coexpression of neighboring genes is investigated (chapters 3 + 4) and the genome-wide relationships between structural parameters of a gene and its expression are analyzed (chapters 5 + 6). A short introduction (chapter 1) outlines the motivation and structure of this thesis. This is followed by an overview of issues that need to be considered in the study of gene and genome structure in relation to gene expression (chapter 2). DNA configuration in the nucleus is summarized and concepts as gene, chromatin and higher order domains are presented {{in the context of the}} measurement of gene expression and gene regulation. Special attention is given to the characteristics and functions of introns in the genomes of higher eukaryotes. Expression of genes in eukaryotic genomes is known to cluster in domains, but domain size is generally loosely defined and highly variable. The concept of local coexpression domain is introduced and defined as set of physically adjacent genes that are highly coexpressed (chapter 3). The Arabidopsis thaliana genome was analyzed for the presence of such local coexpression domains and their functional characteristics were investigated. Public domain expression data from the Massively Parallel Signature Sequencing (MPSS) repository that cover a range of different experimental conditions, organs, tissues and cells and microarray data (Affymetrix) from a detailed analysis of gene expression in root were used. With these expression data, we identified 689 (MPSS) and 1481 (microarray) local coexpression domains consisting of 2 to 4 genes with a pair-wise Pearson's correlation coefficient larger than 0. 7. This number is about 2 to 5 -fold higher than the numbers expected by chance on the basis of genome randomizations. A small (5 - 10 %) yet significant fraction of genes in the Arabidopsis genome is therefore organized into local coexpression domains. These local coexpression domains were apparently randomly distributed over the genome. Genes in such local domains were for the major part not categorized in the same functional category (GOslim). Neither tandemly duplicated genes, nor a s hared promoter sequence, or <b>gene</b> <b>distance</b> fully explained the occurrence of coexpression of genes in such chromosomal domains. This indicates that other parameters in genes or gene positions are important to establish coexpression of genes in local domains of Arabidopsis. The analytical approach was extended to the analysis of the occurrence of local coexpression domains in the genome of rice (Oryza sativa), the monocotyledonous model plant (chapter 4). Also in the rice genome, there is a small, yet significant number of local coexpression domains that for the major part were not categorized in the same functional category (GOslim). The various configuration parameters studies could not fully explain the occurrence of local coexpression domains. The regulation of coexpression is therefore thought to be regulated at the level of chromatin structure. The characteristics of the local coexpression domains in rice are strikingly similar to such domains in the Arabidopsis genome. Yet, no microsynteny between local coexpresion domains in Arabidopsis and rice could be identified (chapter 4). Although the rice genome is not yet as extensively annotated as the Arabidopsis genome, the lack of conservation of local coexpression domains indicates that such domains have not played a major role in evolution. In chapter 5, the relationships between the structure of a primary transcript and the expression level of the gene were investigated to identify the parameters and mechanisms that have helped shaping such relationships. In both monocotyledonous rice and dicotyledonous Arabidopsis, highly expressed genes were shown to have more and longer introns, as well as a larger primary transcript than lowly expressed genes. It is concluded that higher expressed genes tend to be less compact than lower expressed genes. In animal genomes, it is reported to be the other way round. Although the length differences in plant genes are much smaller than in animals, these findings indicate that plant genes are in this respect different from animal genes. Explanations for the {{relationship between}} gene configuration and gene expression in animals may be (or may have been) less important in plants. We speculate that selection, if any, on genome configuration has taken a different turn after the divergence of plants and animals. To be able to exclude that the methodological differences were the reason for the reported differences between plant and animal gene structure and expression relationships, a comparative genomics study of five widely diverged genomes was undertaken (chapter 6). The relationships between gene structure and gene expression were analyzed for five genomes (Arabidopsis, rice, worm, mouse, human), using public domain MPSS and affymetrix microarray (for worm) expression data sets that cover a wide variety of tissues and conditions. Five different parameters of gene structure were examined with the help of rank-based methods: the number of introns, as well as the total length of introns, combined untranslated regions, coding sequence and the combined total length of the primary transcript. In addition, the broadness or breadth of expression is evaluated. The methods of analyses were identical for all genomes considered. It was found that tissue specific genes, defined as genes that are expressed in only one (or at most a few) tissues/conditions, are among the more compact genes in all genomes evaluated. Moreover, in plants the higher expressed genes tend to be longer and less compact than the lower expressed genes, whereas in the mammalian genomes analyzed the trend is the opposite. Worm takes an intermediate position. The different genomes differ markedly in the details of the relationship between expression and structure for the genes that are in the middle class of expression level. As the major difference in genome configuration is the absolute length of introns, possible explanations for the contrasting trends in plant and mammalian genomes question the role and evolutionary history of introns. Possibly there is a threshold amount of intron number and/or size upon which selection acts that differs between genomes. Alternatively, some groups of plant introns have been introduced in plant genomes well after the split between animals and plants. The results of the research presented in this thesis are considered in the context and future prospects of the wider, more detailed and more comparative analyses of the relationships between gene structure and gene expression in the genomes of higher eukaryotes (chapter 7) ...|$|E

40|$|International audienceHorizontal {{transfer}} of transposable elements (HTT) is increasingly appreciated {{as an important}} source of genome and species evolution in eukaryotes. However, our understanding of HTT dynamics is still poor in eukaryotes because the diversity of species for which whole genome sequences are available is biased and does not reflect the global eukaryote diversity. RESULTS: In this study we characterized two Mariner transposable elements (TEs) in the genome of several terrestrial crustacean isopods, a group of animals particularly underrepresented in genome databases. The two elements have a patchy distribution in the arthropod tree and they are highly similar (> 93 % over {{the entire length of the}} element) to insect TEs (Diptera and Hymenoptera), some of which were previously described in Ceratitis rosa (Crmar 2) and Drosophila biarmipes (Mariner- 5 _Dbi). In addition, phylogenetic analyses and comparisons of TE versus orthologous <b>gene</b> <b>distances</b> at various phylogenetic levels revealed that the taxonomic distribution of the two elements is incompatible with vertical inheritance. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the two Mariner TEs each underwent at least three HTT events. Both elements were transferred once between isopod crustaceans and insects and at least once between isopod crustacean species. Crmar 2 was also transferred between tephritid and drosophilid flies and Mariner- 5 underwent HT between hymenopterans and dipterans. We demonstrate that these various HTTs took place recently (most likely within the last 3 million years), and propose iridoviruses and/or Wolbachia endosymbionts as potential vectors of these transfers...|$|R

30|$|Future {{research}} on gene transfer between GM rice and rice CWR in Colombia and beyond should therefore focus on identifying potential insect pollinators, and understanding CWRs’ phenology, <b>gene</b> flow <b>distances,</b> seeds and pollen longevity, and the adaptive advantage of any transgenic traits introduced. For example, our {{hypothesis that the}} O. glumaepatula populations we sampled may have a mixed mating system characterized by a significant degree of outcrossing (implying that these populations may be more susceptible to introgression of alien genes), requires exhaustive field testing to allow developing adequate in situ conservation strategies. In the absence of detailed knowledge on the actual probabilities of gene flow between GM rice and its wild relatives, including the tetraploid ones, a precautionary approach may be appropriate.|$|R

Advisors: Jean-Pierre Kocher, Claudia Neuhauser. 1 {{computer file}} (PDF); vi, 27 pages. Microarray data contain {{information about the}} level of expression of genes that can be informative of changes taking place in cells. This information has been widely used to study the changes in gene expression between normal and cancer cells. Gene expression {{has been used as a}} biomarker predictive of the progression of a disease and to identify drug targets specifically expressed in cancer tissue. Although the level of expression of a gene can change by multiple folds across tissues, the simplest information (on/off status) about a gene is whether it is or is not expressed in a given tissue. In this study we propose to take advantage of a large set of tissue specific gene expression data to study the profile of gene expression in pathways and tissues. To perform this analysis, we leverage and improve a method that computes the on/off status of a gene from their level of expression. The percent of genes with on status in a given tissue was selected to summarize across bio specimen. The gene state method was applied to sets of tissue specific expression microarray extracted from the GEO database. We then studied the profile of on/off state of genes in KEGG pathways across several tissues. The data were then used to calculate a <b>distance</b> between <b>gene</b> sets. Using all <b>genes,</b> a <b>distance</b> could be calculated between normal and cancer tissue, as well as pairwise comparisons between each tissue type. The gene sets were then narrowed and selected based on pathway annotation from KEGG. This demonstrated an ability to identify known cancer pathways based on their <b>gene</b> signature <b>distances.</b> The results affirm known cancer pathways by calculating relative distances...|$|R
40|$|Initially using 143 genomes, we {{developed}} a method for calculating the pair-wise distance between prokaryotic genomes using a Monte Carlo method to estimate the conservation of gene order. The method was based on repeatedly selecting five or six non-adjacent random orthologs from each of two genomes and determining if the chosen orthologs {{were in the same}} order. The raw distances were then corrected for gene order convergence using an adaptation of the Jukes-Cantor model, as well as using the common distance correction D’ = -ln(1 -D). First, we compared the distances found via the order of six orthologs to distances found based on ortholog gene content and small subunit rRNA sequences. The Jukes-Cantor <b>gene</b> order <b>distances</b> are reasonably well correlated with the divergence of rRNA (R 2 = 0. 24), especially at rRNA Jukes-Cantor distances of less than 0. 2 (R 2 = 0. 52). Gene content is only weakly correlated with rRNA divergence (R 2 = 0. 04) over all distances, however, it is especially strongly correlated at rRNA Jukes-Cantor distances of less than 0. 1 (R 2 = 0. 67). This initial work suggests that gene order may be useful in conjunction with other methods to help understand the relatedness of genomes. Using the <b>gene</b> order <b>distances</b> in 143 genomes, the relations of prokaryotes were studied using neighbor joining and agreement subtrees. We then repeated our study of the relations of prokaryotes using gene order in 172 complete genomes better representing a wider-diversity of prokaryotes. Consistently, our trees show the Actinobacteria as a sister group to the bulk of the Firmicutes. In fact, the robustness of gene order support was found to be considerably greater for uniting these two phyla than for uniting any of the proteobacterial classes together. The results are supportive of the idea that Actinobacteria and Firmicutes are closely related, which in turn implies a single origin for the gram-positive cell...|$|R
40|$|Abstract A narrow-down {{strategy}} {{to restrict the}} Vf region, which controls resistance to the fungal disease apple scab in apple, to a genetic distance of 0. 4 cM is presented. Using 11 AFLP-derived SCARs and three RAPD-derived SCARs, all linked to the Vf gene, we subjected 1, 412 scab-resistant individuals from 16 map-ping populations to genotype analysis. Eleven recombi-nant individuals were identified within a genetic distance of 0. 9 cM around the Vf gene. Using these 11 recombi-nants, we achieved fine-resolution of several AFLP-derived SCAR markers surrounding the Vf gene, resulting in the following genetic linkage map: ACS- 6 and ACS are located left of the Vf <b>gene</b> at genetic <b>distances</b> of 0. 2 cM and 0. 1 cM, respectively; ACS- 7 and ACS- 9 are insep-arable from the Vf gene; ACS- 8, ACS- 10, and ACS- 4 are located {{to the right of}} the Vf <b>gene</b> at genetic <b>distances</b> of 0. 1 cM, 0. 4 cM, and 0. 5 cM, respectively; the remaining five SCARs—ACS- 11, ACS- 5, ACS- 2, ACS- 1, and AL 07 —are inseparable and are located right of the Vf gene at a genetic distance of 0. 7 cM. By integrating this linkage data with our previous physical map, we gener-ated a revised map of the narrowed-down region of Vf...|$|R

For species identification, Pseudomonas like organisms creates {{lot of problems}} when identified {{with the help of}} morphological and biochemical characters. However, sequencing of 16 S rRNA region is a suitable technique for species identification. The amplified product of 16 S rRNA was submitted to NCBI database.

40|$|Enhancers, {{silencer}} and insulators are DNA {{elements that}} play central roles in {{regulation of the}} genome that are crucial for development and differentiation. In metazoans, these elements are often separated from target <b>genes</b> by <b>distances</b> that can reach 100 [*]Kb. How regulation can be accomplished over long distances has long been intriguing. Current data indicate that although the mechanisms by which these diverse regulatory elements affect gene transcription may vary, an underlying feature is the establishment of close contacts or chromatin loops. With the generalization of this principle, new questions emerge, such as how the close contacts are formed and stabilized and, importantly, how they contribute to the regulation of transcriptional output at target genes. This review will concentrate on examples where a functional role and a mechanistic understanding has been explored for loops formed between genes and their regulatory elements or among the elements themselves...|$|R
