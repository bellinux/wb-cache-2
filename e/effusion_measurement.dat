In human medicine PEs are divided into only two categories: transudates and exudates. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate, in 20 cats presented with PE, paired samples of serum and pleural fluid for the following parameters: Light's criteria (pleural fluid lactate dehydrogenase concentration (LDHp), pleural fluid/serum LDH ratio, pleural fluid/serum total protein ratio (TPr)), pleural fluid total protein, pleural fluid cholesterol concentration, pleural fluid/serum cholesterol ratio (CHOLr), serum-effusion cholesterol gradient (serum cholesterol minus PE cholesterol concentration (CHOLg)), PE total nucleated cells count (TNCCp) and pleural fluid glucose (GLUp). LDHp and TPr were found most reliable when distinguishing between transudates and exudates, with sensitivity of 100 % and 91 % and specificity of 100 %, respectively.

In contrast to films with intermediate material properties, the passivation by low-and high density films showed a reduced thermal stability at relatively high annealing temperatures (similar to 600 degrees C). These observations proved to be in good agreement with thermal effusion results of hydrogen and inert gas atoms that were also strongly dependent on film microstructure. We demonstrate that the temperature of maximum effusion decreased for films with progressively lower density (i. e., with increasing [H]). Therefore, the reduced thermal stability of the passivation for low-density hydrogen-rich ([H] &gt; similar to 5 at. %) films can be attributed to a loss of hydrogen at relatively low annealing temperatures.

The hydrogen and carbon content of the passivation layers control the surface passivation depending on hydrogen bonding and alnealing temperature [64, 65].

40|$|Pleural {{effusion}} is {{a common}} diagnostic problem. The analysis of serum and pleural fluid for tumour markers is widely used as a diagnostic aid in clinical practice. The aim {{of the present study}} was to determine the usefulness of simultaneous quantification of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and carbohydrate antigen (CA- 125) in distinction of malignant from benign effusion. Data from a total of 78 patients including 53 patients with benign and 25 patients with malignant effusion was evaluated. The cut-off values for differentiating benign from malignant effusions were determined using results obtained from patients with known benign effusions (mean + 2 SD, 95 % confidence interval). The cut-off for CEA and CA- 125 were S. lng/ml and 1707 IU/ml respectively. CEA assay in pleural fluid had an acceptable sensitivity and good specificity of 64 % and 98 % respectively. CA- 125 had a sensitivity of 36 % and specificity of 94 %. The combination of the two tumour markers gave a sensitivity of 72 % and specificity of 92. 4 %. We suggest a good clinical strategy may be to begin with CEA measurement (assay specificity 98 %); if CEA is below the cut-off value (negative), CA- 125 could then be measured to improve the sensitivity of detection of malignant <b>effusions.</b> However, <b>measurement</b> of these tumour markers is not cost effective from the point of view that it does not give information on the type of malignancy present. The latter has to be determined either by histological or cytological study...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Pleural {{effusion}} is {{a common}} clinical presentation in several diseases. Various parameters from pleural fluid have been studied to identify the cause of effusion. D-dimer is a degradation product of cross-linked fibrin and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) {{is one of the}} biochemical markers found in pleural effusion. ALP is a plasma membrane derived enzyme of uncertain physiologic function that hydrolyzes synthetic phosphate esters at pH 9. It is present in the serum in several forms, i. e., ALP- 1 alpha 2, ALP- 2 beta 1 and ALP- 3 beta 2. Aim: The present study was carried out to evaluate the value of alkaline phosphatase and D-dimer concentration in the pleural effusions and serum as a diagnostic tool. Methods: This study was carried out on one hundred patients with pleural effusions of different aetiologies. 75 patients had exudative pleural effusions (35 patients had tuberculous effusion, 20 patients had malignant effusion, 10 had parapneumonic effusion, 5 had empyema and 5 patients had systemic lupus erythematosis) and 25 patients had transudative effusions (20 patients had hepatic and 5 patients had cardiac effusions). Serum and pleural effusion D-dimer (measured by ELISA), ALP, LDH and protein levels were measured. Results: There was a highly significant difference in the pleural fluid D-dimer and ALP levels between exudative and transudative effusions (P    0. 05). Lastly {{there was no significant difference}} (P >  0. 05) in the serum levels of either the ALP or the D-dimer between different types of <b>effusions.</b> Conclusion: <b>Measurement</b> of pleural fluid D-dimer and ALP levels aids in the differentiation between exudative and transudative pleural effusions. Also, both pleural fluid D Dimer and ALP are significantly higher in tuberculous pleural effusions...|$|R
40|$|AbstractKnudsen <b>effusion</b> mass {{spectrometry}} <b>measurements</b> on neptunium dioxide {{are reported in}} this work, which have allowed to improve the understanding of its vapourization behaviour and solved discrepancies noticed in the literature: the enthalpy of formation of NpO 2 (g) has been re-assessed and the composition of neptunia at congruent vapourization has been determined at 2262 K. In addition, a thermodynamic model for the neptunium-oxygen system has been developed using the CALPHAD method. The non stoichiometric NpO 2 −x phase is described herein using the compound energy formalism with ionic constituents (Np 3 +,Np 4 +) 1 (O 2 -,Va) 2, while the liquid phase is represented with the ionic two-sublattice model (Np 4 +) P(O 2 -,VaQ-,O) Q. The reliability and consistency of all optimized Gibbs energies have been verified by calculating the phase equilibria, thermodynamic data, oxygen chemical potential and equilibrium partial pressures. Finally, a number of ill-defined data in the Np–O system have been identified after critical {{review of the literature}} and comparison with the present experimental results and CALPHAD model...|$|R
40|$|The {{photodissociation}} of mass-selected linear carbon clusters (Cn, n) 4 - 6) is studied using fast beam photofragment translational spectroscopy. The photofragment yield (PFY) spectra {{consist of}} several continua spanning the whole visible and ultraviolet region. The product mass distributions for dissociation of Cn clusters {{are dominated by}} C 3 and its partner fragment Cn- 3, although some minor channels are also identified for dissociation of C 4 and C 5 clusters. Translational energy P(ET) distributions for the C 3 + Cn- 3 channel were measured at several photolysis energies. The PFY spectra and P(ET) distributions indicate that multiphoton dissociation occurs at photon energies below the dissociation threshold and that both single-photon and multiphoton dissociation occur above the threshold. The one-photon components of the P(ET) distributions can be modeled by phase space theory (PST), suggesting that photoexcitation is followed by internal conversion to the ground state. The PST analysis yields dissociation energies for Cnf C 3 + Cn- 3 in reasonable agreement with recent Knudsen <b>effusion</b> mass spectrometry <b>measurements.</b> I...|$|R
40|$|The {{limitation}} of {{fossil fuel resources}} {{and the necessity of}} reducing CO 2 emission require an increase of the efficiency of power plants by using combined cycle power systems. The pressurized pulverized coal combustion (PPCC) combined cycle is a coal fired combined cycle concept which is able to achieve efficiencies in excess of 53 %. The direct use of the hot flue gas for driving a gas turbine requires a hot gas cleanup to achieve corrosion prevention of the turbine blading. One of the main problems is the release of alkalies during the coal combustion process. Therefore, the thermodynamic basics for the control of alkali vapor pressures in the hot flue gas of PPCC have been investigated by thermodynamic equilibrium calculations and Knudsen <b>effusion</b> mass spectrometric <b>measurements</b> on alkali oxide activities in and alkali partial pressures over coal ash slags with and without additives and alkali laden model sorbents. The obtained results reveal that the requirements of the gas turbine manufacturers regarding alkali concentration in the hot flue gas should be satisfiable by certain aluminosilicate sorbents. On the basis of these results, a concept for alkali vapor removal is proposed...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to assess the {{usefulness}} of soluble vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the effusions of patients with malignant and tuberculous diseases. Using a sandwich enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assay, VEGF concentration was measured in malignant (n= 17) and tuberculous (n= 11) pleural effusions. Pleural biopsy, cytology or microbiological methods were used to make final diagnoses. Adenosine deaminase (ADA) levels in tuberculous pleural effusions were significantly higher than those in malignant pleural effusions. The median level of VEGF in patients with malignant effusions (median, 2418 pg/mL; range, 97 - 62103 pg/mL) was significantly higher than tuberculous effusions (median, 994 pg/mL; range, 44 - 3552 pg/mL). There were no significant differences in pleural VEGF levels in patients with different histological types of lung cancer. The VEGF level was not correlated with ADA, lactate dehydrogenase and total protein levels of pleural fluid. In conclusion, pleural VEGF levels in patients with malignant effusions were significantly higher than tuberculous <b>effusions,</b> and the <b>measurement</b> of pleural VEGF is helpful in discriminating between malignant and tuberculous effusions. Further studies are needed to determine the clinical value of VEGF as a tumor marker and a prognostic factor...|$|R
