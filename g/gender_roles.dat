40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the {{relationship}} between masculine <b>gender</b> <b>role</b> conflict, attachment variables, narcissism, and adjustment. It was expected that men who reported higher masculine <b>gender</b> <b>role</b> conflict would also report unhealthy attachment, have a greater degree of narcissism and poorer adjustment. This study employed a sample of undergraduate males who completed self-report questionnaires measuring masculine <b>gender</b> <b>role</b> conflict, narcissism, adjustment, and attachment. Hypotheses were tested using canonical correlation techniques. Results indicated that healthy attachment was related to low masculine <b>gender</b> <b>role</b> conflict; however, unhealthy attachment was not related to high masculine <b>gender</b> <b>role</b> conflict. In terms of narcissism, higher amounts of narcissism were related to high amounts of <b>gender</b> <b>role</b> conflict, but in a subset of results individuals who reported low masculine <b>gender</b> <b>role</b> conflict also reported higher narcissism in areas that are assumed to relate to positive self regard. Results related to adjustment indicated that high masculine <b>gender</b> <b>role</b> conflict was related to less psychological well-being replicating past studies. Theoretical and methodological issues were discussed in light of these findings...|$|R

40|$|Alcohol misuse is an {{important}} public health concern as it is related to an elevated probability of experiencing a number of negative life events.

The goal of this two-part study was to investigate the relation of <b>gender</b> <b>role</b> orientation and alcohol use behaviors with the expectation that masculine <b>gender</b> <b>role</b> orientation would be associated with these behaviors and related motives for use.

40|$|Purpose This study {{examines}} {{the association between}} <b>gender</b> <b>role</b> attitudes and risky sexual behavior among young women. Previous studies have posed seemingly contradictory arguments: that either traditional attitudes or egalitarian attitudes are associated with riskier behavior. Methods Data {{are based on the}} children of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, representing 520 sexually active 18 – 19 -year-old women. Propensity radius matching was used to assess differences in rates of multiple sexual partners and sex outside of a committed relationship. Results Relative to moderate <b>gender</b> <b>role</b> attitudes, both egalitarian <b>gender</b> <b>role</b> attitudes and traditional <b>gender</b> <b>role</b> attitudes are associated with higher rates of risky sexual behavior. Both women with egalitarian role attitudes and those with traditional role attitudes have about a 10 % higher prevalence of risky behavior compared to women with more moderate <b>gender</b> <b>role</b> attitudes. Conclusion Existing, seemingly contradictory contentions about the relationship between <b>gender</b> <b>role</b> attitudes and risky sexual behavior may be more coherent than they seem. By shifting focus from risk to protection, the results suggest that moderate <b>gender</b> <b>role</b> attitudes are protective against risky sexual behavior. Future studies should investigate the causal mechanisms and intervention implications of this protective relationship...|$|R
40|$|Rape myths persist {{among college}} {{students}} {{for a variety of}} reasons, and therefore rape remains a serious problem on college campuses. Past research has consistently shown that there is a relationship between traditional <b>gender</b> <b>role</b> attitudes and belief in rape myths. For example, Szymanski, Devlin, Chrisler, and Vyse (1993) found that men with traditional <b>gender</b> <b>role</b> attitudes believe in more rape myths. Studies suggest that traditional <b>gender</b> <b>role</b> attitudes have decreased as women have entered the work force, and that individuals who grow up in egalitarian households are less likely to hold traditional <b>gender</b> <b>role</b> attitudes. This study examines the extent to which growing up in an egalitarian family affects traditional <b>gender</b> <b>role</b> attitudes and the acceptance of rape myths. Gender differences in beliefs will also be examined. The data for this study was collected from 100 college students enroJled at a mid-sized private university using a self-administered questionnaire. This survey included the modified Illinois Rape Myth Acceptance Inventory, the BEM sex role inventory, General Social Survey measures of <b>gender</b> <b>role</b> attitudes, as well as questions regarding family structure. It was found that students from egalitarian households were less likely to hold traditional <b>gender</b> <b>role</b> attitudes and were less accepting of rape myths.

Using data on 1159 fathers aged 50 - 94 from the National Survey of Families and Households (W- 1), I sought to determine if fathers 2 ̆ 7 traditional <b>gender</b> <b>role</b> attitudes would predict receipt of support in two domains: help with instrumental tasks (e. g., help {{around the house and}} help with repairs), and expressive support (e. g., expressive support, encouragement, moral or emotional support). : My research question was: what are {{the effects of}} fathers 2 ̆ 7 traditional <b>gender</b> <b>role</b> attitudes on receipt of support from their adult children? To this end I formed two hypotheses: 1) fathers who exhibit higher <b>gender</b> <b>role</b> traditional beliefs will receive less instrumental support than fathers who exhibit lower <b>gender</b> <b>role</b> traditional beliefs; and 2) fathers who exhibit lower <b>gender</b> <b>role</b> traditional beliefs will receive more expressive support than those who exhibit higher <b>gender</b> <b>role</b> traditional beliefs. I created a scale to assess <b>gender</b> <b>role</b> attitudes of respondents. Logistic regression analyses revealed no evidence for an association between fathers 2 ̆ 7 <b>gender</b> <b>role</b> attitudes and receipt of support from their adult children in terms of expressive or instrumental support. Additional comparisons using crosstabular analysis offered no further insights. The lack of findings may indicate the complexity of intergenerational exchanges.

The second manuscript is a quantitative study that investigates the impact <b>gender</b> <b>role</b> beliefs and partner status has on depression in Mexican American women. Furthermore, the second manuscript suggests variables that contribute to depression in Mexican American women and recommendations for clinicians. The aim of the second manuscript is to examine the literature concerning depression in Mexican American women {{and the ways in which}} traditional <b>gender</b> <b>role</b> beliefs and self-discrepancies may impact Mexican American women's mental health. This dissertation begins by examining the literature concerning depression in Mexican American women. It then explores Mexican American women's <b>gender</b> <b>role</b> socialization, including a review of the values that are taught through this process. This study then provides an in depth inspection of the ideal of marianismo, which guides traditional Mexican American women's <b>gender</b> <b>role</b> beliefs. Next it progresses to discuss Self-Discrepancy theory and possible mental health outcomes. Examples of possible self-discrepancies related to traditional Mexican American women's <b>gender</b> <b>role</b> beliefs are provided to illustrate how depression may occur when self-discrepancies are present. Finally, it provides recommendations for clinicians who work with depressed Mexican American women. The second manuscript examines the impact of traditional <b>gender</b> <b>role</b> beliefs and partner status on depression in a sample of 325 Mexican American women. It is hypothesized that an interaction effect between partner status and <b>gender</b> <b>role</b> beliefs will be found, whereas Mexican American women who are unpartnered and have traditional <b>gender</b> <b>role</b> beliefs will experience a greater amount of depression, due to the presence of a discrepancy. Contrarily, results from the analysis of variance (ANOVA) found no interaction between partner status and <b>gender</b> <b>role</b> beliefs on depression. The manuscript provides possible explanations for such findings. In addition, results from a hierarchical regression indicate that level of education and the family pillar aspect of marianismo significantly impact depression in Mexican American women...|$|R

Although this is merely just a few <b>gender</b> <b>roles</b> that are not set in stone, they may hold to be true. It was found that working women sleep twenty-five minutes less a night due solely to their responsibility for domestic work. Applying this statistic in larger scale leads to the assumption that women on average lose up to thirteen hours of sleep per month due to domestic duties. It can be assumed that it is possible for an average woman to lose up to one hundred and fifty-six hours of sleep during a year because of domestic work and motherly duties.|$|E

Recent studies on college men's gender identity development suggests diversity experiences in higher education may influence positive and healthy masculine identities (Harris III, 2010; Edwards & Jones, 2009). Therefore, the purpose of this study is to identify relationships between fraternity men's diversity experiences and their degree of <b>gender</b> <b>role</b> conflict. The research subjects in the present study include 341 fraternity men at a comprehensive research university in the Pacific Northwest. Data was collected through a survey instrument that measured fraternity men's degree of <b>gender</b> <b>role</b> conflict, interactional diversity experiences, and classroom diversity experiences. Descriptive statistics and inferential analysis is used to evaluate the existence of relationships between fraternity men's diversity experiences and their degree of <b>gender</b> <b>role</b> conflict. Findings indicate there is no significant statistical relationship between <b>gender</b> <b>role</b> conflict and interactional diversity experiences or <b>gender</b> <b>role</b> conflict and classroom diversity experiences. However, results do show college men's interactional diversity experiences may be an indirect negative predictor of <b>gender</b> <b>role</b> conflict because of the identified negative relationship interactional diversity experiences has on two out of the four patterns that make up <b>gender</b> <b>role</b> conflict: Restrictive Emotionality and Restrictive Affectionate Behavior Between Men.
