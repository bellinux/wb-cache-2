5|$|A deleted {{scene from}} this episode is {{included}} on the complete thirteenth season DVD and Blu-ray Disc sets. <b>It</b> <b>shows</b> <b>the</b> boys taking Michael Jackson (in Ike's body) to the Glendale location of Forest Lawn Memorial-Parks & Mortuaries to prove he is dead. When they reach the grave, Jackson denies it and Kyle attempts to show him by taking a shovel and digging his grave. Stan at first opposes but he, with Cartman and Kenny take shovels and the scene ends with the boys digging Jackson's grave to show he is dead while Ike/Jackson dances. Jackson's grave shows his date of death as July 25, 2009, when in fact he died on June 25.|$|E
5|$|Altar Q is {{the most}} famous {{monument}} at Copán. It was dedicated by king Yax Pasaj Chan Yopaat in AD776 and has {{each of the first}} 16 kings of the Copán dynasty carved around its side. Each figure is depicted seated on his name glyph. A hieroglyphic text is inscribed on the upper surface, relating the founding of the dynasty in AD426427. On one side, <b>it</b> <b>shows</b> <b>the</b> dynastic founder K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' transferring power to Yax Pasaj. Interestingly, Tatiana Proskouriakoff first discovered the inscription on the West Side of Altar Q that tells us the date of the inauguration of Yax Pasaj. This portrayal of political succession tells us much about Early Classic Maya culture.|$|E
5|$|Many {{cities in}} Poland now have {{memorials}} to the massacre in public spaces {{as well as}} within churches and cemeteries.

5|$|Scientists {{have so far}} {{recognized}} {{only one}} class of geological feature on Umbriel—craters. The surface of Umbriel has far more and larger craters than do Ariel and Titania. <b>It</b> <b>shows</b> <b>the</b> least geological activity. In fact, among the Uranian moons only Oberon has more impact craters than Umbriel. The observed crater diameters range from a few kilometers {{at the low end}} to 210kilometers for the largest known crater, Wokolo. All recognized craters on Umbriel have central peaks, but no crater has rays.|$|E
5|$|Sowing and Harvesting and Market, popularly {{referred}} to as the Vršac triptych, is a three-panel oil painting by the Serbian realist Paja Jovanović. Painted around 1895, <b>it</b> <b>shows</b> <b>the</b> everyday interactions of the inhabitants of Vršac, a multi-ethnic and multi-religious town in the Banat region of Austria-Hungary of which Jovanović was a native. The painting was commissioned by the Vršac city council in 1895 for the following year's Budapest Millennium Exhibition.|$|E

5|$|The Nineteenth Dynasty saw {{a further}} {{standardisation}} of tomb layout and decoration. The {{tomb of the}} first king of the dynasty, Ramesses I, was hurriedly finished due {{to the death of}} the king and {{is little more than a}} truncated descending corridor and a burial chamber. However, KV16 has vibrant decoration and still contains the sarcophagus of the king. Its central location makes it one of the more frequently visited tombs. <b>It</b> <b>shows</b> <b>the</b> development of the tomb entrance and passage and of decoration.|$|E
5|$|The Virgin and Child with Canon van der Paele {{is a large}} oil-on-oak panel {{painting}} completed around 1434–36 by the Early Netherlandish painter Jan van Eyck. <b>It</b> <b>shows</b> <b>the</b> painting's donor, Joris van der Paele, {{within an}} apparition of saints. The Virgin Mary is enthroned at {{the centre of the}} semicircular space, which most likely represents a church interior, with the Christ Child on her lap. St. Donatian stands to her right, Saint George—the donor's name saint—to her left. The panel was commissioned by van der Paele as an altarpiece. He was then a wealthy clergyman from Bruges, but elderly and gravely ill, and intended the work as his memorial.|$|E

In addition, <b>it</b> <b>shows</b> <b>the</b> extraordinary ability to trap molecules and metallic clusters which have similar sizes to the nanomesh pores, forming a well-ordered array. These characteristics promise interesting applications of the nanomesh in areas like catalysis, surface functionalisation, spintronics, quantum computing and data storage media like hard drives.|$|E

5|$|The fossil has {{a number}} of {{features}} that suggest a relation to a group of oryzomyine rodents that includes the South American marsh rat Holochilus, its living relatives Lundomys and Pseudoryzomys, and the extinct Noronhomys and Holochilus primigenus. They share high-crowned (hypsodont) molars and several simplifications of molar morphology, as well as other features that cannot be assessed in Carletonomys, which indicate specializations towards a semiaquatic lifestyle. <b>It</b> <b>shows</b> <b>the</b> most similarity to Noronhomys and Holochilus, so much so that Pardiñas considered placing it in either of these two genera, but its distinctive morphological features justify placement in a separate genus.|$|E

5|$|Britomart Redeems Faire Amoret was {{intended}} by Etty {{to illustrate the}} virtues of chastity and honour. <b>It</b> <b>shows</b> <b>the</b> moment in which Busirane is interrupted by Britomart {{as he prepares to}} kill Amoret. Amoret is chained to a gilded Solomonic column, carved with depictions of Venus, and her clothes fall from her shoulders as she struggles. Britomart, clad in armour, enters Busirane's Moorish chamber, and tramples a blood-stained grimoire as she draws her sword. Busirane, naked from the waist up and with Chinese-style trousers and queue, falls to the floor, his blade still pointing at Amoret's heart. Unusually for Etty, Britomart is painted very thinly, with the canvas weave still visible through the paint. Art historian Alison Smith considers that this was likely inspired by Henry Fuseli, who painted a depiction of Britomart using the same style of painting.|$|E
5|$|Charles Dickens is {{reputed to}} have set his novel Hard Times in the city, {{and while it}} is partly {{modelled}} on Preston, <b>it</b> <b>shows</b> <b>the</b> influence of his friend Mrs Gaskell. Gaskell penned all her novels, with the exception of Mary Barton, at her residence on Plymouth Grove. On numerous occasions Gaskell's house played host to influential authors including Dickens, Charlotte Brontë, Harriet Beecher Stowe and Charles Eliot Norton. It is now open as a literary museum. Also closely associated with the city is Victorian poet and novelist Isabella Banks, most famed for her 1876 novel The Manchester Man. Anglo-American author Frances Hodgson Burnett was born in the city's Cheetham Hill district in 1849, and wrote much of her classic children's novel The Secret Garden while visiting nearby Salford's Buile Hill Park.|$|E
