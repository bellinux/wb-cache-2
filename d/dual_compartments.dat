The results show that in cortical-thalamic dissociated co-cultures, burst events initiate in the cortical region and propagate to the thalamic region and the burst events in thalamic region can be controlled by blocking the synaptic receptors in the cortical region. Whereas, in cortical-cortical co-culture system, {{one of the region}} acts as a site of burst initiation and facilitate propagation of bursts in the entire network.

40|$|By {{screening}} a yeast two-hybrid {{library with}} COOH-terminal fragments of vinculin/metavinculin as the bait, we identified a new protein termed raver 1. Raver 1 is an 80 -kD multidomain protein and widely expressed but to varying amounts in different cell lines. In situ and in vitro, raver 1 forms complexes with the microfilament-associated proteins vinculin, metavinculin, and α-actinin and colocalizes with vinculin/metavinculin and α-actinin at microfilament attachment sites, such as cell–cell and cell matrix contacts of epithelial cells and fibroblasts, respectively, and in costameres of skeletal muscle. The NH 2 -terminal part of raver 1 contains three RNA recognition motifs with homology {{to members of}} the heterogeneous nuclear RNP (hnRNP) family. Raver 1 colocalizes with polypyrimidine tract binding protein (PTB) /hnRNPI, a protein involved in RNA splicing of microfilament proteins, in the perinucleolar compartment and forms complexes with PTB/hnRNPI. Hence, raver 1 is a <b>dual</b> <b>compartment</b> protein, which is consistent with the presence of nuclear location signal and nuclear export sequence motifs in its sequence. During muscle differentiation, raver 1 migrates from the nucleus to the costamere. We propose that raver 1 may coordinate RNA processing and targeting as required for microfilament anchoring in specific adhesion sites...|$|R

The connectivity between neuronal populations via the microchannels and the crossing-over of neurites are verified using transfection experiments and immunofluorescence staining. In addition to the neurite cross-over to the adjacent compartment, functional connectivity between cells in both the compartments is verified using cross-correlation based techniques. Bidirectional signal propagation between the compartments is demonstrated using functional connectivity maps.

Here, we present an approach to derive such fluxes from (a) in situ HOC concentration gradients measured with passive samplers and (b) mass transfer coefficients measured with a novel flux method using Empore disks. For eight undisturbed sediments, this method identified whether the sediment acted as a source or as a sink for HOCs. The analysis also identified which type of transport resistance governed sediment water exchange. For seven inland locations, exchange was limited by benthic boundary layer transport, showing no dependencies on sediment or chemical properties other than concentration. For one river mouth location, exchange was limited by slow in-bed intraparticle diffusion. A biphasic <b>dual</b> <b>compartment</b> radial diffusion model adequately described the data for this location. Fast desorption was interpreted as molecular diffusion retarded by microscale dual domain sorption to amorphous as well as black carbon (BC).

Soil samples from this compartment were analyzed at 0, 90, 120, 150, and 180 days. For each sample, Illumina sequencing {{was used to assess}} any changes in the soil bacterial communities.

In addition, time and AMF significantly affected bacterial genera (e. g., Candidatus Solibacter, Dyella, Phenylobacterium) involved in litter decomposition. Opposite to the bacterial community composition, we found that overall soil bacterial OTU richness and diversity are relatively stable and were not significantly influenced by either time or AMF inoculation. OTU richness at phylum and class levels also showed consistent results with overall bacterial OTU richness.

40|$|Volume {{overload}} is {{a common}} feature in patients on haemodialysis (HD). This contributes significantly to the cardiovascular disease burden seen in these patients. Clinical assessments of the volume state are often inaccurate. Techniques such as interdialytic blood pressure, relative blood volume monitoring, bioimpedance are available to improve clinical effectives. However all these techniques exhibit significant shortcomings in their accuracy, reliability and applicability at the bed side. We evaluated the usefulness of a <b>dual</b> <b>compartment</b> monitoring technique using Continuous Segmental Bioimpedance Spectroscopy (CSBIS) and Relative Blood Volume (RBV) {{as a tool to}} assess hydration status and determine dry weight. We also sought to evaluate the role of Atrial Natriuretic Peptide (ANP) and B-type Natriuretic Peptide (BNP) as a volume marker in dialysis patients. The Retrospective analysis of a historical cohort (n = 376, 55 Diabetic) showed a significant reduction in post-dialysis weights {{in the first three months}} of dialysis (72. 5 to 70 kg, p< 0. 027) with a non-significant increase in weight between months 6 - 12. The use of anti-hypertensive agents reduced insignificantly in the first 3 months, increased marginally between months 3 - 6 and significantly increased over the subsequent 6 months. The residual urea clearance (KRU) fell and dialysis times increased. The cohort was very different to that dialysing at Tassin and showed a dissociation between weight reduction and BP control. This may relate to occult volume overload. CSBIS-RBV monitoring in 9 patients with pulse ultrafiltration (pulse UF) showed distinct reproducible patterns relating to extra cellular fluid (ECF) and RBV rebound. An empirical Refill Ratio was then used to define the patterns of change and this was related to the state of their hydration. A value closer to unity was consistent with the attainment of best achievable target weight. The refill ratio fell significantly between the first (earlier) and third (last) rebound phase (1. 97 ?? 0. 92 vs 1. 32 ?? 0. 2). CSBIS monitoring was then carried out in 31 subjects, whilst varying dialysate composition, temperature and patient posture to analyse the effects of these changes on the ECF trace and to ascertain whether any of these interventions can trigger a change in the slope of the ECF trace distinct to that caused by UF. Only, isovolemic HD caused a change in both RBV and ECF in some patients that was explained by volume re-distribution due to gravitational shifts, poor vascular reactivity, sodium gradient between plasma and dialysate and the use of vasodilating antihypertensive agents. This has not been described previously. These will need to be explored further. The study did demonstrate a significant lack of comparability of absolute values of RECF between dialysis sessions even in the same patient. This too has not been described previously. This is likely to be due to subtle changes in fluid distribution between compartments. Therefore a relative changes must be studied. This sensitivity to subtle changes may increase the usefulness of the technique for ECF tracking through dialysis. The potential of <b>dual</b> <b>compartment</b> monitoring to track volume changes in real time was further explored in 29 patients of whom 21 achieved weight reductions and were able to be restudied. The Refill Ratio decreased significantly in the 21 patients who had their dry weights reduced by 0. 95 ?? 1. 13 kg (1. 41 ?? 0. 25 vs 1. 25 ?? 0. 31). Blood pressure changes did not reach statistical significance. The technique was then used to examine differences in vascular refill between a 36 oC and isothermic dialysis session in 20 stable prevalent patients. Pulse UF was carried out in both these sessions. There were no significant differences in Refill Ratios, energy removed and blood pressure response between the two sessions. The core temperature (CT) of these patients was close to 36 oC and administering isothermic HD did not confer any additional benefit. Mean BNP levels in 12 patients during isovolemic HD and HD with UF did not relate to volume changes. ANP concentrations fell during a dialysis session in 11 patients from a mean 249 ?? 143 pg/ml (mean ?? SD) at the start of dialysis to 77 ?? 65 pg/ml at the end of the session (p< 0. 001). During isolated UF levels did not change but fell in the ensuing sham phase indicating a time lag between volume loss and decreased generation. (136 ?? 99 pg/ml to 101 ?? 77. 2 pg/ml; p< 0. 02) In a subsequent study ANP concentrations were measured throughout dialysis and in the post-HD period for 2 hours. A rebound in ANP concentration was observed occurring at around 90 min post-HD. The degree of this rebound may reflect the prevailing fluid state and merit further study. We have shown the utility of <b>dual</b> <b>compartment</b> monitoring with CSBIS-RBV technique and its potential in assessing volume changes in real time in haemodialysis patients. We have also shown the potential of ANP as an independent marker of volume status in the same setting. Both these techniques merit further study...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Cytokine {{signaling}} {{within the}} amnionic, chorionic and decidual extraplacental gestational membranes {{plays an important}} role in membrane rupture and the timing of birth. The predominant in vitro explant culture system for evaluating cytokine induction in human gestational membranes has been the free-floating biopsy punch culture. Punch systems have been used to investigate the impact of various toxicants, pharmaceuticals and genetic variation on expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. More recently, a <b>dual</b> <b>compartment</b> transwell culture system has been developed that more closely mimics the intrauterine compartment. The current study compares these two systems with respect to release of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a model stimulant. Methods Tissue samples were exposed to 100 ng/ml LPS for 12 h and cytokines were measured by ELISA. Data are expressed as increase relative to non-treated controls. Results Levels of interleukin- 6 increased in punch culture medium samples to a significantly greater extent (34. 2 fold) compared with medium from transwell cultures in the amnion (6. 6 fold) or choriodecidual (7. 1 fold) compartments. Interleukin- 8 also showed a significantly greater induction in punch (4. 8 fold) than transwell amnion (1. 6 fold) or choriodecidual (1. 7 fold) samples. The anti-inflammatory interleukin- 10 showed a significant difference between punch (36. 5 fold) and transwell amnion (15. 4 fold) samples, but no difference was observed between punch and transwell choriodecidual (28. 5 fold) samples. Neither interleukin- 1 beta nor tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) showed a significant difference between the punch and transwell samples.

METHODS: Blood samples were drawn at the start and end of surgery, and on removal of the venous cannula from 70 children (aged 1 to 12 years, weight 9 to 37 kg) who received a preoperative oral 1 mg kg - 1 dose; these were pooled with rich (14 post-dose samples) data from 30 adult volunteers. Population pharmacokinetic modelling was undertaken with NONMEM. The optimum adult dose of diclofenac for acute pain is 50 mg. Simulation from the final model was performed to predict a paediatric dose to achieve a similar AUC to 50 mg in adults. RESULTS: A total of 558 serum diclofenac concentrations from 100 subjects {{was used in the}} pooled analysis. A single disposition compartment model with first order elimination and <b>dual</b> absorption <b>compartments</b> was used. The estimates of CL/F and V D/F were 53. 98 l h - 1 70 kg - 1 and 4. 84 l 70 kg - 1 respectively. Allometric size models appeared to predict adequately changes in CL and V D with age. Of the simulated doses investigated, 1 mg kg - 1 gave paediatric AUC (0, 12 h) to adult 50 mg AUC (0, 12 h) ratios of 1. 00, 1. 08 and 1. 18 for ages 1 - 3, 4 - 6 and 7 - 12 years respectively.

40|$|If {{our global}} society wants to evolve to net zero {{greenhouse}} gas emissions, {{one of the}} key technological changes that need to be made is the transition from burning fossil-based fuels towards the use of renewable fuels. Hydrogen is such a suitable fuel and can be made from sunlight by splitting water into its constituents: hydrogen (H 2) and oxygen (O 2). This can be achieved by using renewable electricity from solar panels to perform water electrolysis, a technology well known today. Another way is to integrate both systems and directly perform the water splitting reactions on a photovoltaic material which is coated with a suitable catalyst. Such integrated systems are called photoelectrochemical (PEC) cells. In this PhD thesis, PEC solar hydrogen devices were investigated with an emphasis on upscaling and design of complete PEC cells. In Chapter 2, a general overview of integrated PEC cells is given with an emphasis on cell design and nanostructuring of components. Economic, technical and practical aspects are discussed, pinpointing the major current bottlenecks for solar hydrogen devices to reach the market. In Chapter 3 a first PEC technology based on a particulate TiO 2 photoanode, proton conducting membrane and Pt cathode was investigated at larger scales (up to 9 cm²) in a <b>dual</b> <b>compartment</b> cell. These obtained results emphasize that upscaling of PEC cells is not trivial and suitable techniques for large scale deposition of membranes and catalyst must be considered. Further, the concept of oxidation of volatile organic components (VOCs) was proposed in this PEC cell. Finally an advanced two-compartment experimental PEC, suitable to characterize a monolithic solar hydrogen device in experimental as well as real-life conditions was designed and constructed. In Chapter 4, the transient phenomena occurring in the aforementioned PEC cell were further investigated. Through collaboration with EPFL, Lausanne, a numerical model was developed based on existing data. Based on results the model assumed the presence of two parallel pathways for charge transport at the photoabsorber−electrolyte interface. The model was experimentally validated and used in combination with a design of experiments (DOE) to predict the transient phenomena in varying operational conditions. A second PEC system was formulated and is based on introducing well-controlled porosity into monolithic Si-based PEC systems. This design was investigated experimentally in Chapter 5. In an attempt to only look at the electrochemical effects, porous monoliths were fabricated without inclusion of photovoltaic materials. Pore diameter and spacing between pores were varied and the effect on Ohmic losses was measured in different conditions. Low Ohmic losses could even be achieved at reduced electrolyte concentrations which have the additional benefit of lowering the stringent requirement for both catalysts as well as encapsulation materials when working at extreme pH values. A simplified electrochemical circuit model suggests Ohmic losses inside the pores start to dominate over surface Ohmic losses at low pore spacing. At lower device thickness, Ohmic losses are expected to decrease further, even at lower porosity. The porous monolithic PEC cell proposed in this thesis is intrinsically scalable. The first steps toward such a device have been made in this work but more research is needed. Currently the effect of pores into photovoltaic materials is being investigated. Also the deposition of membrane materials onto the surface and inside the pores is crucial for product separation. Additionally, this would allow the PEC cells to be operated in air with water vapour as source of water. Such solid state ‘air-PEC cells’ could provide technical and practical solutions to the renewable energy conundrum. A standalone rooftop panel turning air and sunlight into fuel would be a ground-breaking addition to the global renewable energy portfolio. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|In {{eukaryotic}} cells actin is {{the most}} abundant protein, forming different cytoskeletal structures and having different functions. Thus, actin {{plays a crucial role}} in processes such as the establishment of cellular shape, cell motility, cell adhesion, muscle contraction and cytokinesis. The structures of actin networks and their cellular functions are regulated by other proteins, generally known as actin binding proteins (ABPs). Subject of this work was the investigation of the novel ABP synaptopodin 2 (SYNPO 2) and its relevance in vascular smooth muscle cell phenotype modulation. SYNPO 2 is involved in the regulation of actin nucleation and remodeling of actin cytoskeleton. SYNPO 2 is a <b>dual</b> <b>compartment</b> protein that alters its subcellular localization or shuttles between the cell nucleus and cytoplasm in cardiac and skeletal muscle cells depending on cAMP dependent kinases like protein kinase A (PKA), and calcium/Calmodulin-­‐ dependent kinase II (CaMKII). SYNPO 2 shuttling occurs in several processes like differentiation, heat shock response, as well as under pathophysiological conditions, such as bladder and prostate cancer. SYNPO 2 is abundantly expressed in VSMCs, whereas its functional role in these cells remains elusive. Our results demonstrate that the cAMP-­‐mediated PKA pathway is involved in the shuttling of endogenous SYNPO 2 between the cell nucleus and the cytoplasm in both directions. As described before, we detected that increased cAMP causes nuclear accumulation of SYNPO 2 in VSMCs. Additionally,we show that inhibition of phosphatases like protein phosphatases 1 and 2 A (PP 1 and PP 2 A) and/or inhibition of phosphodiesterases (PDEs) affected the accumulation of SYNPO 2 in the cytoplasm. Contrary to Weins et al. 2001, reporting a nuclear localization of GFP-­‐myopodin upon heat schock, we did not detect any changes in the localization of endogenous SYNPO 2 due to heat shock. Furthermore, the phenotype switch of VSMCs not only causes an alteration of subcellular localization of endogenous SYNPO 2 but it also affects its expression level. Contractile VSMCs (day one) showed a strong accumulation of SYNPO 2 in the cytoplasm, while non-­‐contractile (proliferative) VSMCs from passage 3 displayed a strong reduction of cytoplasmic SYNPO 2 and {{an increase in the number}} of cells with nuclear-­‐localized SYNPO 2. We observed that plating of VSMCs (passage 3) on laminin-­‐ coated matrices led to a back-­‐switch from a synthetic phenotype to a contractile phenotype, which subsequently induces an accumulation of SYNPO 2 in the cytoplasm. In contrast VSMCs plated on collagen I remain non-­‐contractile, displaying nuclear accumulation of SYNPO 2. Interestingly, we found an upregulation of SYNPO 2 in the contractile phenotype of fresh isolated VSMCs (day one), as well as VSMCs (passage 3) grown on laminin. A new bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BIFC) based assay was established in order to analyze the subcellular localization and the interaction of SYNPO 2 with its binding partners. An interaction between the SYNPO 2, 14 -­‐ 3 -­‐ 3 β, and importinα was detected in the nucleus, while SYNPO 2 interacts with 14 -­‐ 3 -­‐ 3 γ exclusively in the cytoplasm. The nuclear interaction of SYNPO 2 with 14 -­‐ 3 -­‐ 3 β was detected in form of nuclear bodies-­‐like structures, which were not observed for the SYNPO 2 -­‐importinα complexes. Interestingly, both SYNPO 2 -­‐ 14 -­‐ 3 -­‐ 3 β and SYNPO 2 -­‐importinα complexes formed a loop-­‐like structure. Finally, we show a self-­‐association of SYNPO 2 in the form homo-­‐dimers mainly in the cytoplasm. Taken together, our findings indicate that the novel actin binding protein SYNPO 2 plays a potential role in at least three different processes in which phenotype switch is essential, like during cell differentiation and vascular development, after vascular injury (vascular repair) and under pathological conditions like atherosclerosis, cancer. In summary, we may conclude that SYNPO 2 is essential for early and late differentiation of VSMCs via mechanisms involving actin and actin-­‐mediated transcription networks...|$|R
40|$|The proper {{distribution}} of proteins between the cytosol and various membrane-bound compartments {{is crucial for}} the functionality of eukaryotic cells. This requires the cooperation between protein transport machineries that translocate diverse proteins from the cytosol into these compartments and targeting signal(s) encoded within the primary sequence of these proteins that define their cellular destination. The mechanisms exerting protein translocation differ remarkably between the compartments, but the predominant targeting signals for mitochondria, chloroplasts and the ER share the N-terminal position, an α-helical structural element and the removal from the core protein by intraorganellar cleavage. Interestingly, similar properties have been described for the peroxisomal targeting signal type 2 mediating the import of a fraction of soluble peroxisomal proteins, whereas other peroxisomal matrix proteins encode the type 1 targeting signal residing at the extreme C-terminus. The structural similarity of N-terminal targeting signals poses {{a challenge to the}} specificity of protein transport, but allows the generation of ambiguous targeting signals that mediate dual targeting of proteins into different <b>compartments.</b> <b>Dual</b> targeting might represent an advantage for adaptation processes that involve a re{{distribution of}} proteins, because it circumvents the hierarchy of targeting signals. Thus, the co-existence of two equally functional import pathways into peroxisomes might reflect a balance between evolutionary constant and flexible transport routes...|$|R
40|$|The {{neurotransmitter}} serotonin (5 -hydroxytryptamine, 5 -HT) modulates many key brain functions {{including those}} subserving sensation, emotion, reward and cognition. Efficient clearance of 5 -HT after release {{is achieved by}} the antidepressant-sensitive 5 -HT transporter (SERT, SLC 6 A 4). To identify novel SERT regulators, we pursued a proteomic analysis of mouse midbrain SERT complexes, evaluating findings {{in the context of}} prior studies that established a SERT-linked transcriptome. Remarkably, both efforts converged on a relationship of SERT with the synaptic adhesion protein neuroligin 2 (NLGN 2), a postsynaptic partner for presynaptic neurexins, and a protein well known to organize inhibitory GABAergic synapses. Western blots of midbrain reciprocal immunoprecipitations confirmed SERT/NLGN 2 associations, and also extended to other NLGN 2 associated proteins (e. g. -neurexin (NRXN), gephyrin). Midbrain SERT/NLGN 2 interactions were found to be Ca 2 +-independent, supporting cis versus trans-synaptic interactions, and were absent in hippocampal preparations, consistent with interactions arising in somatodendritic <b>compartments.</b> <b>Dual</b> color in situ hybridization confirmed co-expression of Tph 2 and Nlgn 2 mRNA in the dorsal raphe, with immunocytochemical studies confirming SERT:NLGN 2 co-localization in raphe cell bodies but not axons. Consistent with correlative mRNA expression studies, loss of NLGN 2 expression in Nlgn 2 null mice produced significant reductions in midbrain and hippocampal SERT expression and function. Additionally, dorsal raphe 5 -HT neurons from Nlgn 2 null mice exhibit reduced excitability, a loss of GABAA receptor-mediated IPSCs, and increased 5 -HT 1 A autoreceptor sensitivity. Finally, Nlgn 2 null mice display significant changes in behaviors known to be responsive to SERT and/or 5 -HT receptor manipulations. We discuss our findings in relation to the possible coordination of intrinsic and extrinsic regulation afforded by somatodendritic SERT:NLGN 2 complexes...|$|R
40|$|Background: Perfusion CT is a {{technology}} which allows functional evaluation of tissue vascularity. Due to this potential, it is finding increasing utility in oncology. Although since its introduction continuous advances have interested CT technique, some issues {{have to be}} still defined, concerning both clinical and technical aspects. In this study, we dealt with the comparison of two widely employed mathematical models (<b>dual</b> input one <b>compartment</b> model - DOCM - and maximum slope - SM -) analyzing their robustness to the noise. Methods. We carried out a computer simulation process to quantify effect of noise on the evaluation of an important perfusion parameter (Arterial Blood Flow - BFa) in liver tumours. A total of 4500 liver TAC, corresponding to 3 fixed BFa values, were simulated using different arterial and portal TAC (computed from 5 real CT images) at 10 values of {{signal to noise ratio}} (SNR). BFa values were calculated by applying four different algorithms, specifically developed, to these noisy simulated curves. Three algorithms were developed to implement SM (one semiautomatic, one automatic and one automatic with filtering) and the last for the DOCM method. Results: In all the simulations, DOCM provided the best results, i. e., those with the lowest percentage error compared to the reference value of BFa. Concerning SM, the results are variable. Results obtained with the automatic algorithm with filtering are close to the reference value, but only if SNR is higher than 50. Vice versa, results obtained by means of the semiautomatic algorithm gave, in all simulations, the lowest results with the lowest standard deviation of the percentage error. Conclusions: Since the use of DOCM is limited by the necessity that portal vein is visible in CT scans, significant restriction for patients' follow-up, we concluded that SM can be reliably employed. However, a proper software has to be used and an estimation of SNR would be carried out...|$|R
