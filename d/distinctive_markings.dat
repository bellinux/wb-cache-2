5|$|Horses {{exhibit a}} {{diverse array of}} coat colors and <b>distinctive</b> <b>markings,</b> {{described}} by a specialized vocabulary. Often, a horse is classified first by its coat color, before breed or sex. Horses of the same color may be distinguished from one another by white markings, which, along with various spotting patterns, are inherited separately from coat color.|$|E
5|$|Their coat differs geographically, with elands {{in north}} Africa having <b>distinctive</b> <b>{{markings}}</b> (torso stripes, markings on legs, dark garters and a spinal crest) that are absent in the south. Apart from a rough mane, the coat is smooth. Females have a tan coat, while the coats of males are darker, with a bluish-grey tinge. Bulls {{may also have}} a series of vertical white stripes on their sides (mainly in parts of the Karoo in South Africa). As males age, their coat becomes more grey. Males also have dense fur on their foreheads and a large dewlap on their throats.|$|E
25|$|The Siberian Husky (Russian: Сибирский хаски) is {{a medium}} size working dog breed that {{originated}} in north-eastern Siberia, Russia. The breed {{belongs to the}} Spitz genetic family. It is recognizable by its thickly furred double coat, erect triangular ears, and <b>distinctive</b> <b>markings.</b>|$|E

25|$|She {{had some}} <b>distinctive</b> <b>markings</b> on her body. A 2- to 6-inch scar was visible above {{one of her}} heels. Two moles on her face, one above her left eye and one on her left cheek, may have {{developed}} during her pregnancy.|$|E
25|$|It always {{sits with}} its wings closed {{to display the}} bright {{markings}} of its undersides. It fearlessness, weak flight and <b>distinctive</b> <b>markings</b> all indicate {{that it is a}} protected butterfly, which is peculiar considering that its host plants are not known to contain any sequestrable toxins.|$|E
25|$|There was {{originally}} no native writing system for Māori. It {{has been suggested}} that the petroglyphs once used by the Māori developed into a script similar to the Rongorongo of Easter Island. However, {{there is no evidence that}} these petroglyphs ever evolved into a true system of writing. Some <b>distinctive</b> <b>markings</b> among the kōwhaiwhai (rafter paintings) of meeting houses were used as mnemonics in reciting whakapapa (genealogy) but again, there was no systematic relation between marks and meanings.|$|E

25|$|The size of {{the brown}} facial {{markings}} on the heads of females {{also serves as a}} visual cue for members of the colony and serves as a badge of higher ranking status and reproductive status. Females with larger brown facial markings also have larger ovaries. These visual cues help other wasps to not only determine if a wasp is of the same species, but also to determine what to do and how to distribute themselves around the nests. Visiting females that lack these brown visual marks {{are more likely to be}} accepted into foreign nests. Acts of aggressions are much more likely to be exhibited towards a female with these <b>distinctive</b> <b>markings</b> in order to maintain a control system within the nest.|$|E
25|$|The first {{deliveries}} of lend-lease Corsairs {{began in}} March 1944 {{with the arrival}} of 30 F4U-1s at the RNZAF Base Depot Workshops (Unit 60) on the island of Espiritu Santo in the New Hebrides. From April, these workshops became responsible for assembling all Corsairs for the RNZAF units operating the aircraft in the South West Pacific; and a Test and Despatch flight was set up to test the aircraft after assembly. By June 1944, 100 Corsairs had been assembled and test flown. The first squadrons to use the Corsair were 20 and 21 Squadrons on Espiritu Santo, operational in May 1944. The organization of the RNZAF in the Pacific and New Zealand meant that only the pilots and a small staff belonged to each squadron (the maximum strength on a squadron was 27 pilots): squadrons were assigned to several Servicing Units (SUs, composed of 5-6 officers, 57 NCOs, 212 airmen) which carried out aircraft maintenance and operated from fixed locations: hence F4U-1 NZ5313 was first used by 20 Squadron/1 SU on Guadalcanal in May 1944; 20 Squadron was then relocated to 2 SU on Bougainville in November. In all there were ten front line SUs plus another three based in New Zealand. Because each of the SUs painted its aircraft with <b>distinctive</b> <b>markings</b> and the aircraft themselves could be repainted in several different colour schemes, the RNZAF Corsairs were far less uniform in appearance compared with their American and FAA contemporaries. By late 1944, the F4U had equipped all ten Pacific-based fighter squadrons of the RNZAF.|$|E
500|$|French naturalist Bernard Lacépède {{originally}} {{described the}} crossback stingaree as Raja cruciata, in an 1804 {{volume of the}} scientific journal Annales du Muséum d'Histoire Naturelle Paris. The specific epithet means [...] "cross-like" [...] in Latin, referring to the <b>distinctive</b> <b>markings</b> on its back. The origin of the type specimen was given simply as New Holland (Australia). In their 183841 Systematische Beschreibung der Plagiostomen, German biologists Johannes Müller and Jakob Henle placed this species in the newly created genus Urolophus.|$|E

500|$|Each Jacob has <b>distinctive</b> <b>markings</b> {{that enable}} the {{shepherd}} to identify specific sheep from a distance. Desirable colour traits include an animal which is approximately 60% white, {{with the remaining}} 40% consisting of a random pattern of black or [...] "lilac" [...] (brownish-gray) spots or patches. The skin beneath the white fleece is pink, while skin beneath coloured spots is darkly pigmented. Both rams and ewes exhibit black markings, {{some of which are}} breed specific and some of which are random.|$|E
500|$|Indian tribes were {{familiar}} with the painted turtle—young braves were trained to recognize its splashing into water as an alarm—and incorporated it in folklore. A Potawatomi myth describes how the talking turtles, [...] "Painted Turtle" [...] and allies [...] "Snapping Turtle" [...] and [...] "Box Turtle", outwit the village women. Painted Turtle is the star of the legend and uses his <b>distinctive</b> <b>markings</b> to trick a woman into holding him so he can bite her. An Illini myth recounts how Painted Turtle put his paint on to entice a chief's daughter into the water.|$|E
500|$|<b>Distinctive</b> <b>markings,</b> {{especially}} on its head, make the saxaul sparrow {{unlikely to be}} confused with any other bird. It is dull-coloured, with plumage ranging between dull grey and warm sandy brown, varying between and within subspecies. Birds of the subspecies ammodendri are a sandy grey, while nigricans birds are similar but darker, and stoliczkae birds are warm brown or russet. Birds of the subspecies stoliczkae and those from the southwest of the range of ammodendri also differ from usual ammodendri birds in their lack of streaking on the rump and upper tail coverts. [...] Birds in Mongolia have a larger and deeper bill and broad bluish streaks on their chest.|$|E

500|$|The British 'G' Patrol {{vehicles}} carried no <b>distinctive</b> <b>markings,</b> {{although some}} vehicles had the Guards insignia. They took over 'W' Patrol's vehicles when that unit was disbanded. The 'Y' Patrol vehicles were slightly different; 'Y1' half-patrol vehicles all had names of famous drinking establishments (such as 'Cock O’ The North') and 'Y2' half-patrol had names from the [...] "Three Musketeers" [...] books (for example, 'Aramis') {{on the left}} sides of their vehicle bonnets. The Headquarters Section used a sequence of letters arranged in a square (see photo of [...] "Louise"). The Rhodesian 'S' Patrol vehicles had names with a Rhodesian connection (such as 'Salisbury') painted {{on the left side}} of the vehicles' bonnets. By 1943 the practice of naming replacement vehicles was dropped.|$|E
500|$|The {{head and}} body {{length of a}} red panda {{measures}} , and its tail is [...] Males weigh [...] and females [...] They have long, soft, reddish-brown fur on the upper parts, blackish fur on the lower parts, and a light face with tear markings and robust cranio dental features. The light face has white badges {{similar to those of}} a raccoon, but each individual can have <b>distinctive</b> <b>markings.</b> Their roundish heads have medium-sized upright ears, black noses, and blackish eyes. Their long, bushy tails with six alternating transverse ochre rings provide balance and excellent camouflage against their habitat of moss- and lichen-covered trees. The legs are black and short with thick fur on the soles of the paws. This fur serves as thermal insulation on snow-covered or icy surfaces and conceals scent glands, which are also present on the anus.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} years, {{the color and}} {{markings}} were not very important. By the 20th century the breed's <b>distinctive</b> <b>markings</b> and color were written into the standard, becoming an essential feature. The Boston Terrier has lost most of its aggressive nature, preferring the company of humans, although some males will still challenge other dogs if they feel their territory is being invaded.|$|E
50|$|Genus Bucephala, the goldeneyes. These {{are less}} marine than some species in this group, and will winter on fresh water. Drakes have white bodies with black backs and <b>distinctive</b> head <b>markings.</b> Females are grey with {{chestnut}} heads.|$|R
50|$|During the 1990s, Volkswagen {{sponsored}} three high-profile rock bands' European tours, {{and issued}} a special-edition Golf, with <b>distinctive</b> exterior <b>markings,</b> for each: the Golf Pink Floyd Edition (1994), the Golf Rolling Stones Edition (1995), and the Golf Bon Jovi Edition (1996).|$|R
50|$|These {{birds have}} brown backs {{streaked}} with black, and <b>distinctive</b> head <b>markings.</b> Their cup nests, {{built by the}} female, are of plant material lined with fine grasses and constructed on the ground, low in a tree or bush, or in a niche in a wall.|$|R
2500|$|When Europeans first settled Eastern North America, semianadromous or sea-run brook trout, {{commonly}} called [...] "salters", ranged from southern New Jersey, north throughout the Canadian maritime provinces, and west to Hudson Bay. Salters may {{spend up to}} three months at sea feeding on crustaceans, fish, and marine worms in the spring, not straying {{more than a few}} miles from the river mouth. [...] The fish return to freshwater tributaries to spawn in the late summer or autumn. While in salt water, salters gain a more silvery color, losing much of the <b>distinctive</b> <b>markings</b> seen in freshwater. [...] However, within two weeks of returning to fresh water, they assume typical brook trout color and markings.|$|E
2500|$|Yellowjacket or Yellowjacket is {{the common}} name in North America for predatory social wasps of the genera Vespula and Dolichovespula. Members of these genera are known simply as [...] "wasps" [...] in other English-speaking countries. Most of these are black and yellow like the eastern yellowjacket Vespula maculifrons and the aerial yellowjacket Dolichovespula arenaria; some are black and white like the bald-faced hornet, Dolichovespula maculata. Others may have the abdomen {{background}} color red instead of black. They can be identified by their <b>distinctive</b> <b>markings,</b> their occurrence only in colonies, and a characteristic, rapid, side-to-side flight pattern prior to landing. All females are capable of stinging. Yellowjackets are important predators of pest insects.|$|E
2500|$|The pattern {{found on}} the surface of Liubo boards is also {{found on the}} most common type of Han Dynasty bronze mirror, known from their <b>distinctive</b> <b>markings</b> as TLV mirrors. There is some debate over whether the Liubo pattern on these mirrors was simply decorative, or whether it had a ritual significance, or whether perhaps the mirrors doubled as {{portable}} Liubo game boards. Zhou Zheng has pointed out that one TLV mirror dating to the reign of Wang Mang (9–23) has an inscription that includes the words [...] "Carved with a Liubo board pattern to dispel misfortune" [...] (刻具博局去不羊), which suggests that the main purpose of the Liubo pattern on mirrors was ritual, and that the pattern had a special significance beyond game-playing.|$|E
5000|$|Originally bred in the Trøndelag {{region of}} Norway, {{from where the}} sheep derives its name, the Grey Troender are most {{commonly}} varying shades of grey in color with <b>distinctive</b> white <b>markings</b> under the eyes. However, black, brown and white woolled Grey Troenders occasionally do occur.|$|R
25|$|The {{player can}} also gain an {{advantage}} by identifying cards from <b>distinctive</b> wear <b>markings</b> on their backs, or by hole carding (observing during the dealing process {{the front of}} a card dealt face down).
