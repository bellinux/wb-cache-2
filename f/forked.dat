5|$|Glareolidae is {{a family}} of wading birds {{comprising}} the pratincoles, which have short legs, long pointed wings and long <b>forked</b> tails, and the coursers, which have long legs, short wings and long, pointed bills which curve downwards.|$|E
5|$|Terns are slender seabirds with long, pointed wings, {{a pointed}} bill and a tail {{which is usually}} <b>forked.</b> There are about 44 species worldwide, 10 {{recorded}} in Leicestershire and Rutland.|$|E
5|$|The drongos {{are mostly}} black or dark grey in colour, {{sometimes}} with metallic tints. They have long <b>forked</b> tails, and some Asian species have elaborate tail decorations. They have short legs and sit very upright when perched, like a shrike. They flycatch or take prey from the ground.|$|E

50|$|The 6.9 mi Middle <b>Fork</b> {{is formed}} by the {{confluence}} of the short South <b>Fork</b> Middle <b>Fork</b> Tule River and the North <b>Fork</b> Middle <b>Fork</b> Tule River. The South <b>Fork</b> flows northwest and west, paralleling California State Route 190, from its headwaters near Camp Nelson. The larger North <b>Fork</b> flows south from inside Sequoia National Park, plunges over North <b>Fork</b> of the Middle <b>Fork</b> of the Tule River Falls, and flows southwest to join the South <b>Fork.</b> After {{the confluence of the}} North and South <b>forks,</b> the Middle <b>Fork</b> Tule River flows more or less south and southwest, parallel to State Route 190, to join the North <b>Fork</b> and form the Tule River.|$|R
5|$|The treeswifts, {{also called}} crested swifts, {{are closely related}} to the true swifts. They differ from the true swifts in that they have crests, long <b>forked</b> tails and soft plumage.|$|E
5|$|Austrian naturalist Franz Xaver von Wulfen {{described}} the false chanterelle in 1781, noting both its resemblance with the true chanterelles and people's propensity to confuse them. The false chanterelle was then {{placed in the}} genus Clitocybe, but it was later observed that its <b>forked</b> gills and dextrinoid spores indicated a relationship to Paxillus. Genetic analysis has confirmed that {{it belongs to the}} order Boletales and is more closely related to boletes.|$|E
5|$|Both {{species can}} be {{distinguished}} from most other swallows in their breeding or wintering ranges by the streaking on the underparts. Although the lesser striped swallow has white underparts with dark streaking, it is larger, has a deeply <b>forked</b> tail and a very different plumage, with dark blue upperparts, a red rump and a chestnut head.|$|E

2500|$|The Sabine {{rises in}} {{northeast}} Texas by {{the union of}} three branches: the Cowleech <b>Fork,</b> Caddo <b>Fork,</b> and South <b>Fork.</b> The Cowleech <b>Fork</b> rises in northwestern Hunt County and flows southeast for [...] The Caddo <b>Fork,</b> shown as [...] "Caddo Creek" [...] on federal maps, rises in two tributary <b>forks,</b> the East Caddo <b>Fork</b> and the West Caddo <b>Fork,</b> in northwestern Hunt County. The South <b>Fork</b> rises in the southwestern corner of Hunt County and flows east for , joining the Caddo <b>Fork</b> and Cowleech <b>Fork</b> in southeastern Hunt County.

50|$|A <b>fork</b> of {{the king}} and queen, the highest material-gaining <b>fork</b> possible, is {{sometimes}} called a royal <b>fork.</b> A <b>fork</b> of the opponent's king, queen, and one (or both) rooks is sometimes called a grand <b>fork.</b> A knight <b>fork</b> of the opponent's king, queen, and possibly other pieces is sometimes called a family <b>fork</b> or family check.|$|R
5|$|Characteristics {{typically}} {{used in the}} field to distinguish Hygrophoropsis aurantiaca from lookalike species include: the soft, dry consistency of its cap; the crowded, decurrent, and <b>forked</b> gills that are saffron to orange coloured; and the lack of any distinctive taste or odour. The false chanterelle can be distinguished from the true chanterelle (Cantharellus cibarius) by its deeper orange colour, brown base to the stipe, velvety cap surface, <b>forked</b> gills rather than gill-like ridges, softer (and thinner) flesh, and lack of the characteristic apricot-smell. The cap surface of Hygrophoropsis fuscosquamula, found in Britain, has fine brown scales overlaying a dull orange background. H.rufa has velvety brown fur covering its cap, while H.macrospora has cream gills and stipe. Microscopically, these three species have larger spores than H.aurantiaca. H.tapinia, found in a range extending from southern Florida to Central America, is set apart from H.aurantiaca by its growth on or under deciduous trees (never conifers), and smaller spores, which measure 3.3–4.8 by 2.5–3.3µm.|$|E
5|$|Following its completion, Highway58 was rerouted {{through the}} tunnel, west {{of which it}} <b>forked.</b> At the Pine Road interchange, one fork {{travelled}} north on Pine, east along Richmond Street and north along Ormond Street (now Niagara Regional Road52). The other fork followed the present route.

5|$|Frigatebirds {{are large}} seabirds usually found over {{tropical}} oceans. They are large, black or black-and-white birds, with long wings and deeply <b>forked</b> tails. The males have colored inflatable throat pouches. They do not swim or walk and cannot {{take off from}} a flat surface. Having the largest wingspan-to-body-weight ratio of any bird, they are essentially aerial, able to stay aloft {{for more than a}} week.|$|E
50|$|The Obion {{has four}} major <b>forks,</b> the North <b>Fork,</b> Middle <b>Fork,</b> South <b>Fork</b> and Rutherford <b>Fork</b> (which {{is named after}} the town of Rutherford).

50|$|Inside most {{tubes are}} springs, <b>fork</b> oil, and air, {{creating}} a shock absorber. Some <b>forks</b> allow pressurized air {{to be added}} through a valve {{in the top of}} the <b>fork</b> to stiffen the suspension. Quality <b>forks</b> have a flexible air tube between both <b>fork</b> tubes in order to balance the air pressure in both <b>forks.</b> Modern <b>fork</b> tubes have a method which employs a screw to compress <b>fork</b> spring to increase or decrease spring pre-load.|$|R

5|$|Kauri gum {{formed when}} resin from kauri trees leaked out through {{fractures}} or {{cracks in the}} bark, hardening with the exposure to air. Lumps commonly {{fell to the ground}} and became covered with soil and forest litter, eventually fossilising. Other lumps formed as branches <b>forked</b> or trees were damaged, which released the resin.|$|E
5|$|Pratincoles have short legs, {{very long}} pointed wings and long <b>forked</b> tails. Their most unusual feature for birds classed as waders {{is that they}} {{typically}} hunt their insect prey on the wing like swallows, although they can also feed on the ground. Their short bills are an adaptation to aerial feeding.|$|E

5|$|Eriophorum angustifolium {{differs from}} other species within the genus Eriophorum in its habitat and morphology. Its {{multiple}} flower heads and growth from rhizomes {{distinguish it from}} E.vaginatum, which has a single flower head and grows from dense tussocks. Although E.latifolium has 2–12 flower heads, it has laxly caespitose (tufted) growth, and its pappi are <b>forked.</b> The smooth peduncles and preference for acidic soil pH distinguishes E.angustifolium from E.gracile, which grows in swamp with a neutral pH and has scabrid (rough) peduncles.|$|E
5|$|In mass, {{the spores}} are whitish. The spores are elliptical, smooth, hyaline, devoid of oil {{droplets}} (eguttulate), and have dimensions of 13–18 by 7–9µm. They are thin walled and germinate and grow rapidly in vitro {{in the absence}} of external stimuli. The asci are 190–225 by 9–10µm. The paraphyses are slightly club-shaped, unbranched, and have irregular orange-brown granules, with tips up to 5µm wide, and are not <b>forked</b> or lobed. The hypothecium, the layer of cells below the hymenium, is made of densely packed, small irregular cells.|$|E
