5|$|The Western Ghats {{are home}} to four {{tropical}} and subtropical moist broadleaf forest ecoregions – the North Western Ghats moist <b>deciduous</b> forests, North Western Ghats montane rain forests, South Western Ghats moist <b>deciduous</b> forests, and South Western Ghats montane rain forests. The northern portion of the range is generally drier than the southern portion, and at lower elevations makes up the North Western Ghats moist <b>deciduous</b> forests ecoregion, with mostly <b>deciduous</b> forests made up predominantly of teak. Above 1,000 meters elevation are the cooler and wetter North Western Ghats montane rain forests, whose evergreen forests are characterised by trees of family Lauraceae.|$|E
5|$|Boletus subluridellus is a {{mycorrhizal}} fungus, {{and grows}} {{in association with}} <b>deciduous</b> trees, especially oak (genus Quercus). Fruit bodies grow scattered or in groups {{on the ground in}} <b>deciduous</b> or mixed forests, and appear from July to October. An eastern North American species, the mushroom is found from New England west to the Great Lakes, north to Quebec in Canada.|$|E
5|$|In Indochina, {{the jungle}} cat occurs mainly in <b>deciduous</b> forests rich in dipterocarp trees.|$|E
5|$|The primary biome of inland Massachusetts is {{temperate}} <b>deciduous</b> forest.|$|E
5|$|Tylopilus alboater is a {{mycorrhizal}} species, and its fruit bodies grow on {{the ground}} solitarily, scattered, or in groups under <b>deciduous</b> trees, particularly oak. Fruiting occurs in <b>deciduous,</b> coniferous, and mixed forests. Its dark color {{makes it difficult to}} notice in the field.|$|E
5|$|Tylopilus alboater, {{commonly}} known as the black velvet bolete, is a bolete fungus in the Boletaceae family. The species is found in North America east of the Rocky Mountains, and in eastern Asia, including China, Japan, Taiwan, and Thailand. A mycorrhizal species, it grows solitarily, scattered, or in groups on the ground usually under <b>deciduous</b> trees, particularly oak, although it has been recorded from <b>deciduous,</b> coniferous, and mixed forests.|$|E
5|$|Conversely, populations {{can expand}} rapidly {{after a series}} of mild winters. In lowland Britain, there was an {{increase}} of 48% following the 1970/71 winter, with many pairs spreading into <b>deciduous</b> woodlands where they would not normally breed.|$|E
5|$|Germany: The {{species is}} known from two {{different}} areas in the country. In 2005 and 2006, specimens were caught in an old moist forest near the Rhine in western Baden-Württemberg. Two other bats were found in highway tunnels close to this site. The species is also known from the Kyffhäuser hill range of Thuringia in central Germany, an island of relatively warm habitat with some unusual wildlife. There, bats were caught near a spring in a karst landscape amid oak-dominated <b>deciduous</b> forest. The species was also recorded in <b>deciduous</b> forest at a former Soviet military training site in eastern Thuringia. M.alcathoe has also been recorded in the nearby states of Saxony-Anhalt and Saxony, where it occurs in mixed <b>deciduous</b> forest. Many Saxony-Anhalt records are from near water. However, the species was also recorded {{in the center of}} the city of Chemnitz in Saxony.|$|E
5|$|Lactifluus piperatus (synonym Lactarius piperatus), {{commonly}} known as the peppery milk-cap, is a semi-edible basidiomycete fungus of the genus Lactifluus. Despite being edible, it is not recommended by some because of its poor taste, though can be used as seasoning when dried. The fruiting body is a creamy-white mushroom which is funnel-shaped when mature, with exceptionally crowded gills. It bleeds a whitish peppery-tasting milk when cut. Widely distributed across Europe and eastern North America, Lactifluus piperatus has been accidentally introduced to Australia. Mycorrhizal, it forms a symbiotic relationship with various species of <b>deciduous</b> tree, including beech, and hazel, and fruiting bodies are found on the forest floor in <b>deciduous</b> woodland.|$|E
5|$|Marshlands, cypress {{forests and}} {{mixtures}} of shortleaf pine, loblolly pine, blue palmetto, and <b>deciduous</b> forests dominate the state's southeastern quarter, while mixtures of largely post oak, elm, red cedar (Juniperus virginiana) and pine forests cover northeastern Oklahoma.|$|E
5|$|Most nests are in trees, both <b>deciduous</b> and coniferous. Sometimes, {{they can}} be found in shrubs, vines, or on {{artificial}} constructs like buildings, or hanging flower pots. When there is no suitable elevated object, mourning doves will nest on the ground.|$|E
5|$|Only thirty-one {{species of}} <b>deciduous</b> tree and shrub are native to Scotland, {{including}} 10 willows, four whitebeams and three birch and cherry species.|$|E
5|$|The {{forest that}} make up much of the Buffalo Creek {{watershed}} consist mostly of <b>deciduous</b> hardwood trees. However, there are some hemlock and pine trees in the watershed as well.|$|E
5|$|The fruit bodies grows solitary, scattered, or {{clustered}} {{together on}} soil in both coniferous and <b>deciduous</b> woods, typically {{in spring and}} summer. A preference for growing in association with coast live oak (Quercus agrifolia) has been noted for Californian populations.|$|E
5|$|The {{western and}} {{southern}} sides, which {{lie in the}} rain shadow of the central highlands, are home to dry <b>deciduous</b> forests, spiny forests, and deserts and xeric shrublands. Due to their lower population densities, Madagascar's dry <b>deciduous</b> forests have been better preserved than the eastern rain forests or the original woodlands of the central plateau. The western coast features many protected harbors, but silting {{is a major problem}} caused by sediment from the high levels of inland erosion carried by rivers crossing the broad western plains.|$|E
5|$|There are densely forested regions around Gangtok, {{consisting}} of temperate, <b>deciduous</b> forests of poplar, birch, oak, and elm, {{as well as}} evergreen, coniferous trees of the wet alpine zone. Orchids are common, and rare varieties of orchids are featured in flower shows in the city. Bamboos are also abundant. In the lower reaches of the town, the vegetation gradually changes from alpine to temperate <b>deciduous</b> and subtropical. Flowers such as sunflower, marigold, poinsettia, and others bloom, especially in November and December.|$|E
5|$|Trees {{are either}} evergreen, having foliage that {{persists}} and remains green throughout the year, or <b>deciduous,</b> shedding their leaves {{at the end}} of the growing season and then having a dormant period without foliage. Most conifers are evergreens but larches (Larix and Pseudolarix) are <b>deciduous,</b> dropping their needles each autumn, and some species of cypress (Glyptostrobus, Metasequoia and Taxodium) shed small leafy shoots annually in a process known as cladoptosis. The crown is a name for the spreading top of a tree including the branches and leaves, while the uppermost layer in a forest, formed by the crowns of the trees, is known as the canopy. A sapling is a young tree.|$|E
5|$|A {{saprobic}} species, Entoloma murrayi derives nutrients {{by breaking}} down organic matter. Fruit bodies {{are found in}} wet coniferous and <b>deciduous</b> forests, where they grow singly or in small groups {{on the ground in}} litterfall or humus, or in moss. Fruiting occurs in the summer and autumn.|$|E
5|$|Although no {{specific}} {{studies have been}} done on the black catbird's feeding ecology, it is thought to be an omnivore, like its close relatives are. It is known to eat the fruits of Bursera simaruba and Ficus cotinifolia, two <b>deciduous</b> trees found in the Neotropics.|$|E
5|$|Amanita ravenelii is a {{mycorrhizal}} fungus, {{meaning it}} forms mutualistic associations with shrubs and trees. Mushrooms grow {{on the ground}} solitarily, scattered, or in groups in mixed coniferous and <b>deciduous</b> forests. Although the specific tree associations preferred by A.ravenelii are unknown, in general, Amanita from section Lepidella tend to associate with diploxylon pine (that is, pines in subgenus Pinus), oak, and hickory.|$|E
5|$|Compared to {{the other}} crested newt species, the Danube crested newt is more adapted to life along a river system and {{frequently}} occurs in flowing water and together with fish. Typical breeding sites are slow-flowing river margins, oxbow lakes, flooded marshland, larger ponds, or ditches, provided abundant underwater vegetation is available. During land phase, the newts live in <b>deciduous</b> forests or groves, bushlands, or meadows.|$|E
5|$|Coniferous trees such {{as black}} spruce, white spruce, and balsam fir {{dominate}} the native vegetation. The largest <b>deciduous</b> tree is white birch; species of lesser stature include alder, cherry and mountain ash. Of introduced tree species, sycamore maple is most abundant and Norway maple is common. Blue spruce, common horsechestnut, European beech and littleleaf linden {{are among the}} other non-native species grown.|$|E
5|$|Coprinellus impatiens {{is found}} in North America and Europe ({{including}} Germany, Poland, and the Ukraine) including northern Turkey. In the Pacific Northwest region of the United States, it {{is found in}} Oregon and Idaho. Fruit bodies grow solitarily, or rarely in small bundles, on forest litter in <b>deciduous</b> forests, especially ones dominated by beech.|$|E
5|$|Cyptotrama asprata is a {{saprobic}} fungus, {{and grows}} on the decaying wood of <b>deciduous</b> and coniferous trees. Host species include white fir (Abies concolor), sugar maple (Acer saccharum) and other maple (Acer) species, grey alder (Alnus oblongifolia), beech (Fagus) species, spruce (Picea) species, ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) and other pine (Pinus) species, poplar (Populus) and oak (Quercus) species. In temperate North America, specimens are typically collected between July through September.|$|E
5|$|<b>Deciduous</b> {{trees and}} {{plants have been}} {{promoted}} {{as a means of}} controlling solar heating and cooling. When planted on the southern side of a building in the northern hemisphere or the northern side in the southern hemisphere, their leaves provide shade during the summer, while the bare limbs allow light to pass during the winter. Since bare, leafless trees shade 1/3 to 1/2 of incident solar radiation, there is a balance between the benefits of summer shading and the corresponding loss of winter heating. In climates with significant heating loads, <b>deciduous</b> trees should not be planted on the Equator-facing side of a building because they will interfere with winter solar availability. They can, however, be used on the east and west sides to provide a degree of summer shading without appreciably affecting winter solar gain.|$|E
5|$|Dense moist <b>deciduous</b> forest mainly {{consists}} of sal, haldu, peepal, rohini and mango trees. Forest covers almost 73% of the park, 10% {{of the area}} {{consists of}} grasslands. It houses around 110 tree species, 50 species of mammals, 580 bird species and 25 reptile species.|$|E
5|$|Field {{observations}} {{suggest that}} the mushroom associates mycorrhizally with the plant Castanopsis fissa, a <b>deciduous</b> tree found only in the southern provinces of China, such as Guangdong, Yunnan and Hunan. Mushroom fruitings are abundant in the warm spring rains of March and April, although they are also seen in May to July.|$|E
5|$|Fifty-seven {{percent of}} the Nescopeck Creek {{watershed}} is composed of <b>deciduous</b> forest. Areas of perennial herbaceous vegetation make up 11 to 12 {{percent of the}} creek's watershed. Additionally, there are scattered patches of mixed vegetation and annual herbaceous vegetation in the northwestern part of the Nescopeck Creek watershed. Four to seven percent of the Nescopeck Creek watershed consists of mines, quarries, and gravel pits.|$|E
5|$|For {{almost two}} decades after its discovery, Psilocybe tampanensis was known only from the type locality, {{southeast}} of Brandon, Florida. In 1996, Guzmán reported finding it in a meadow with sandy soil in a <b>deciduous</b> forest in Pearl River County, Mississippi, a habitat {{similar to that of}} the type location. Due to its scarcity, however, its habitat preferences are not known with certainty. Like all Psilocybe species, it is saprobic.|$|E
5|$|In Europe, Amanita ceciliae is {{widespread}} everywhere, though infrequently encountered. It often inhabits <b>deciduous</b> forests with hornbeam (Carpinus), oak (Quercus), beech (Fagus) and birch (Betula), {{but it can}} also rarely occur with conifers: pine (Pinus), fir (Abies), spruce (Picea) and cedar (Cedrus). It has a preference for neutral to calcareous soils.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} phytogeography, Croatia {{is a part}} of the Boreal Kingdom and {{is a part of}} Illyrian and Central European {{province}}s of the Circumboreal Region and the Adriatic province of the Mediterranean Region. The World Wide Fund for Nature divides Croatia between three ecoregions—Pannonian mixed forests, Dinaric Mountains mixed forests and Illyrian <b>deciduous</b> forests.|$|E
5|$|India {{lies within}} the Indomalaya ecozone and {{contains}} three biodiversity hotspots. One of 17 megadiverse countries, it hosts 8.6% of all mammalian, 13.7% of all avian, 7.9% of all reptilian, 6% of all amphibian, 12.2% of all piscine, and 6.0% of all flowering plant species. About 21.2% of the country's landmass {{is covered by}} forests (tree canopy density >10%), of which 12.2% comprises moderately or very dense forests (tree canopy density >40%). Endemism is high among plants, 33%, and among ecoregions such as the shola forests. Habitat ranges from the tropical rainforest of the Andaman Islands, Western Ghats, and North-East India to the coniferous forest of the Himalaya. Between these extremes lie the moist <b>deciduous</b> sal forest of eastern India; the dry <b>deciduous</b> teak forest of central and southern India; and the babul-dominated thorn forest of the central Deccan and western Gangetic plain. The medicinal neem, widely used in rural Indian herbal remedies, is a key Indian tree. The luxuriant pipal fig tree, shown on the seals of Mohenjo-daro, shaded Gautama Buddha as he sought enlightenment.|$|E
5|$|Inocybe maculata is an ectomycorrhizal species, {{with a wide}} {{ecological}} range. It can {{be found}} in all biomes from low-lying <b>deciduous</b> woodland to arctic-alpine areas. It typically grows on the ground in <b>deciduous</b> (or mixed) woodland, favouring beech. It grows best on chalky soil, among leaf litter. In North America, it favours sandy soil, clay or moss. It is also encountered on pathsides. As well as beech, the species has been recorded growing in association with hornbeam, hazel, oak and lime. Inocybe maculata f. fulva favours birch, spruce, pine, Populus, willow, (as well as Dryas and Polygonum in alpine regions). Mushrooms grow individually or in scattered groups. Though widespread in the areas it is found, it is not a common species. It can be found from western Europe to eastern Asia; and in North America, from where it was first collected in the 1960s. Inocybe maculata f. fulva was first identified in France, and has since been found elsewhere in Europe.|$|E
5|$|Kitti's hog-nosed bat {{occupies}} limestone caves along rivers within dry evergreen or <b>deciduous</b> forests. In Thailand, Kitti's hog-nosed bat {{is restricted}} to a small region of the Tenasserim Hills in Sai Yok District, Kanchanaburi Province, within the drainage basin of the Khwae Noi River. While Sai Yok National Park in the Dawna Hills contains much of the bat's range, some Thai populations occur outside the park and are therefore unprotected.|$|E
5|$|Leucopholiota decorosa is a {{saprobic}} species, deriving {{nutrients from}} decaying organic matter, particularly the rotting branches and stumps of <b>deciduous</b> trees. One field guide notes {{a preference for}} sugar maple. It grows singly or in bunches, clustered together {{at the base of}} the stem. In Ohio, it typically fruits from late September to mid November.|$|E
5|$|Most Hippeastrum bulbs are {{tunicate}} (a protective dry {{outer layer}} and fleshy concentric inner scales or leaf bases). The bulbs are generally between 512cm (2"5") {{in diameter and}} produce two to seven long-lasting evergreen or <b>deciduous</b> leaves that are 3090cm (12"36") long and 2.55cm (1"2") wide. The leaves are hysteranthous (develop after flowering), sessile, rarely persistent and subpetiolate.|$|E
