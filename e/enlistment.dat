5|$|Biographer Stephen Henderson {{maintains}} that Macdonald {{played a key}} role in the wartime conscription crises that beset the federal government in 1942, and again in 1944, as Prime Minister Mackenzie King tried to avoid imposing compulsory military service overseas. Macdonald himself strongly favoured conscription rather than relying solely on voluntary <b>enlistment.</b> A committed internationalist, he believed it unfair that some bore the sacrifices of overseas service while others escaped what he saw as their military obligations. Macdonald realized however, that conscription was highly unpopular in French-speaking Quebec and that enforcing it would split the country at a time when national unity was crucial. He also recognized that in the early years of the war, voluntary <b>enlistment</b> was producing enough recruits to meet the needs of the armed forces.|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedTwo distinct analytical techniques {{were used to}} develop models in order to forecast monthly first term regular <b>enlistments</b> in the United States Marine Corps. A multiple regression model was derived based on its compatibility with a theory of occupational choice, the intuitive appeal of the explanatory variables, the past literature of manpower supply, and the statistical significance of each variable's impact on monthly <b>enlistments.</b> A second model was developed by applying the Box-Jenkins methodology to the time series of monthly <b>enlistments</b> spanning the period from July 1973 to June 1978. As a further refinement the residuals from the multiple regression equation were treated as an original time series and the Box-Jenkins technique applied to them. then the two models were combined and forecasts calculated.

5|$|The final {{demobilisation}} plan assigned differing {{scales of}} points for service men and women. Service men were allocated two points {{for each year}} of age based on their age at <b>enlistment</b> and a further two points for each month of service {{if they did not}} have dependent children or three points if they did. Service women received three points for each year of age at <b>enlistment</b> and a point for each month of service. Women with children were given priority for demobilisation, followed by those who had married {{before the end of the}} war. Service women who married after the war could ask for an early discharge on compassionate grounds. Men were also eligible for early discharge on compassionate or health grounds, if they had skills which were important to the Australian economy or had been accepted into a full-time training course.|$|E

5|$|In {{the years}} {{immediately}} preceding the war and during its first <b>enlistment,</b> the regiment consisted primarily of companies from Middlesex County.

5|$|Lilly {{was elected}} {{to serve as the}} {{commanding}} officer of his battery from August 1862 until the winter of 1863, when his three-year <b>enlistment</b> expired. His only prior military experience had been in a Lafayette, Indiana, militia unit. Several of his artillerymen considered him too young and intemperate to command; however, despite his initial inexperience, Lilly became a competent artillery officer. His battery was instrumental in several important battles, including the Battle of Hoover's Gap in June 1863 and in the Second Battle of Chattanooga and the Battle of Chickamauga in September 1863.|$|E
50|$|From December 1942 until VJ-day {{there were}} {{relatively}} few <b>enlistments</b> into {{the armed forces}} as restrictions against the direct recruiting {{of men in the}} age group acceptable for service (18-37) were in effect. There were, however, 483,605 other <b>enlistments</b> into the Army and Navy during the period July 1, 1944, to June 30, 1945, but only 1.3 percent were African Americans. Although African Americans constitute approximately 11 percent of the population, aged 18 through 37, only 0.8 percent of Army enlistees and 1.4 percent of Navy enlistees during the period July 1, 1944, to June 30, 1945, were of that race. The reasons why relatively few African Americans enlisted during World War II were numerous. The principal one, however, was the severe restrictions placed against African American <b>enlistments</b> by the armed forces, which, in some periods, amounted to complete prohibition.|$|R
