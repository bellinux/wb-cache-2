50|$|Tibial <b>dyschondroplasia</b> (TD) is a {{metabolic}} disease of young poultry {{that affects the}} growth of bone and cartilage. Often occurs in broilers (chickens raised for meat) and other poultry which have been bred for fast growth rates. The tibial cartilage does not mature enough to ossify (turn into bone). This leaves the growth plate prone to fracture, infection, and deformed bone development.It {{is the leading cause}} of lameness, mortality, and carcass condemnations in commercial poultry.|$|E
5000|$|Breeding for {{increased}} breast muscle {{means that the}} broilers’ centre of gravity has moved forward and their breasts are broader compared with their ancestors, which affects the way they walk and puts additional stresses on their hips and legs. There is a high frequency of skeletal problems in broilers, mainly in the locomotory system, including varus and valgus deformities, osteodystrophy, <b>dyschondroplasia</b> and femoral head necrosis. These leg abnormalities impair the locomotor abilities of the birds, and lame birds spend more time lying and sleeping. [...] The behavioural activities of broilers decrease rapidly from 14 days of age onwards. Reduced locomotion also decreases ossification of the bones and results in skeletal abnormalities; these are reduced when broilers have been exercised under experimental conditions.|$|E

40|$|The tibial <b>dyschondroplasia</b> is {{attributed}} to an asynchrony in the endochondral ossification process, leading to an accumulation of non-calcified and non-vascularized cartilage {{in the place where}} the trabecular bone should be formed. A synchronized action of ectoenzyme nucleotide phosphodiesterase pyrophosphatase (PC- 1), alkaline phosphatase and acid phosphatase is required in the biological calcification process, because they act in the regulation of pyrophosphate concentrations, which in high concentrations is an inhibitor of calcification and may lead to the development of tibial <b>dyschondroplasia.</b> The birds were divided into normal and dyschondroplasic, sacrificed, then the tibiae were removed, frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at - 70 °C. Afterwards, the growth plates were homogenized, submitted to different treatments to make each enzyme extract and then were aliquoted, frozen and stored at - 70 °C for posterior enzyme assays and protein dosage. There was no difference between the specific activity of PC- 1 extracted from normal birds compared to that obtained from dyschondroplasic birds, on the other hand the specific activity of alkaline phosphatase was lower in birds with tibial <b>dyschondroplasia,</b> when compared with healthy birds, suggesting that <b>dyschondroplasia</b> may be attributed to an increase in the concentration of pyrophosphate, which may cause prejudice to mineralization by binding directly to the hydroxyapatite crystals and preventing their growth and also because there is no production of inorganic phosphate. The acid phosphatase activity decreased in dyschondroplasic birds when compared to the normal ones, suggesting that the growth plate has its remodeling functions affected.

Studies indicate that the quantitative requirement for cholecalciferol (D 3) for broiler chickens is much greater than previously thought. Ascorbic acid {{may play a role in}} stimulating 1 -hydroxylation of 25 -hydroxycholecalciferol [25 -(OH) D 3], but the evidence is not clear under exactly what conditions this relationship is important in practical prevention of tibial <b>dyschondroplasia.</b> Studies indicate that dietary supplementation with 1, 25 -dihydroxycholecalciferol [1, 25 -(OH) 2 D 3] will reduce the incidence of tibial dyschon-droplasia in three different strains of broilers bred to develop a high incidence of the disease. But it did not prevent the disease totally in the strains, unless high enough levels of 1, 25 -(OH) 2 D 3 were fed to reduce growth rate. These studies indicate that these high tibial <b>dyschondroplasia</b> strains have a defect(s) in vitamin D metabolism.

40|$|ABSTRACT Experiments were {{conducted}} to determine the relative acidoge-nicities of several anions, including chloride, sulfate, and mono-, di-, and tribasic phosphate in commercial broiler chickens. Graded levels (80 and 160 meq/kg of diet in two experiments; 50, 100, and 150 meq/kg in a third experiment) of all anions were substituted as calcium salts on a molar equiva-lent basis for calcium carbonate in a semipurified diet. All diets contained equivalent amounts of calcium. The occurrence of tibial <b>dyschondroplasia</b> was determined by visual scoring of the epiphyseal growth plate in the distal end of the tibiotarsus. None of the anions added to the diet at levels of 160 meq/kg or less affected body weight or feed consumption. A higher level of chloride (240 meq/kg) that was utilized in some experiments decreased weight gain by 16 to 22 %. All anions except tribasic phosphate resulted in reduced blood pH or bicarbonate concentrations or bom. Monobasic phosphate was more acidogenic than dibasic phosphate and sulfate and chloride was the most acidogenic of all mineral anions.

40|$|ABSTRACT Continuous {{light with}} 1 h of {{darkness}} at midnight {{is a common}} photoperiod for raising meat-type fowl. The logic behind the 1 h of darkness, usually provided between midnight and 0100 h, is to acclimate the birds to darkness {{in the event of}} a power failure. Increasing evidence from several research laboratories indicates that lighting regimens other than continuous light, such as intermittent or step-up lighting, can lower the incidence of leg abnormalities in meat-type fowl. Some evidence suggests that increased exer-cise contributes in part to the reduction in lameness due to lighting. Management can influence the incidence of leg and foot problems via effects on rate of gain, flooring systems, and litter moisture. Rapid weight gains have been correlated with tibial <b>dyschondroplasia</b> (TD), although more evidence is needed to determine whether other types of leg deformities, such as long bone distortion, are related to rapid growth rates. Using low intensity X-ray imaging (hand-held lixiscope), live breeders with TD lesions can be identified and the incidence of TD can be reduced in breeder flocks through genetic selection. In addition, turkeys can be selected for wider shanks to improve walking ability. Slippery surfaces should be avoided to prevent spraddled legs. With the exception of TD, broilers reared in cages have more leg deformities than floor-reared birds.

40|$|ABSTRACT Locomotion {{problems}} in broiler chickens can cause economic losses {{of up to}} 40 % of the total revenues due to carcass condemnation and downgrading at processing. Leg disorders, such as femoral lesions, tibial <b>dyschondroplasia,</b> and spondylolisthesis, substantially impact the welfare of chickens as these disorders can prevent birds from reaching the feeders and drinkers, thus reducing feed and water intake. The most important issues related to broiler welfare reported {{in the last two}} decades are their growing sensitivity to metabolic and locomotion problems due to the fast growth rates and inactivity. Traditional methods for the determination of gait score include the manual scoring of animal behavior in the broiler house. Recorded video images can also be used for manual scoring of chicken gait score. However, scoring of some animal-based information by human experts and manual methods remain difficult, time consuming and expensive when implemented at farm level.

In this study, gait score as a measure for lameness, is thoroughly investigated in relation to the following physiological variables: weight, sex, corticosterone content in the blood plasma, hock burns, chest dirtiness, foot pad dermatitis, tibial <b>dyschondroplasia</b> and femoral head necrosis. A total of 152 birds were selected from a house of 1500 birds in 3 consecutive growth periods. The chickens were scored for their locomotion by experts, weighed, their sex was determined and blood samples were taken for quantification of stress hormones in the blood plasma. They were then slaughtered and visually scored for hock burns, chest dirtiness and foot pad dermatitis. The birds were dissected to diagnose tibial <b>dyschondroplasia</b> and femoral head necrosis. Between the 8 mentioned parameters, sex, blood stress hormone corticosterone, chest dirtiness and femoral head necrosis had significant relations with the lameness of the birds. Body weight and gait score relation was significant (p < 0. 001) and non-linear. Males were significantly heavier than the females (p < 0. 001).

PTH-deficient mice were dysmorphic but viable, whereas mice lacking PTHrP died at birth with <b>dyschondroplasia.</b> PTH-deficient mice uniquely demonstrated diminished cartilage matrix mineralization, decreased neovascularization with reduced expression of angiopoietin- 1, and reduced metaphyseal osteoblasts and trabecular bone. Compound mutants displayed the combined cartilaginous and osseous defects of both single mutants. These results indicate that coordinated action of both PTH and PTHrP are required to achieve normal fetal skeletal morphogenesis, and they demonstrate an essential function for PTH at the cartilage-bone interface. The effect of PTH on fetal osteoblasts may be relevant to its postnatal anabolic effects on trabecular bone...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Tibial <b>dyschondroplasia</b> (TD) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{prevalent}} skeletal abnormalities in avian species; it causes economic losses and is an animal welfare problem. It has been hypothesized that the absence of vasculature in the lesion of the TD growth plates at the ends of the long bones is involved in the etiology of the disease. We evaluated the hypoxia status of normal and thiram-induced TD growth plates by immunostaining the protein adducts after pimonidazole hydrochloride administra-tion. In addition, we evaluated the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor- 1 α (HIF- 1 α), the major regulator of the hypoxic response that is essential for chondrogenesis, and that of heat-shock proteins (Hsp) downstream from HIF- 1 α. We demonstrated that, in contrast to the normal growth plates, those afflicted by TD were hypoxic. A major increase in hypoxia was observed in the prolifera-tive, hypertrophic, and calcified zones. In the norma...|$|E
