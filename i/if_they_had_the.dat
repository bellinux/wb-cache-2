25|$|Pandemic was {{aided by}} Weta Digital in {{developing}} the game. They provided many of their digital models, including the fell beasts. Pandemic also used elements that were cut from the films, and have taken inspiration from J. R. R. Tolkien's original fantasy series, such as a level based loosely around Balin's conquest of Moria, in which Gimli attempts to retake the dwarven city from the orcs. Some inspiration was less direct: the armies of Rohan and Gondor decide not to attack Minas Morgul in the novel, but a level in the game is based on what might possibly have happened <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>had.</b> <b>The</b> game uses Howard Shore's score to the films as its soundtrack.|$|E
25|$|Some polls, {{such as the}} Gallup World Poll in 2007 {{revealed}} that significant numbers of Israelis, 20 percent, would ideally, <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> opportunity, move permanently to another country. This was in the mid-range of desire to migrate and less than, for example, the residents of Denmark, Belgium, Mexico, Argentina, Italy, Poland, Hungary, South Korea and Chile. The 'push factor' bringing about migration is often reflected in quality of life perceptions. In terms of self ranked quality of life Israelis rate their own lives on a scale numbered from zero at the bottom to ten at the top, Israelis' average rating in 2007 was 6.84, which is far higher than the 4 average for the world and compares with Denmark's 8, among the world's top.|$|E

25|$|Slave-ownership was {{the primary}} marker of class and even the town's freedmen and other people of color {{typically}} kept slaves <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> wealth to do so. Visitors commonly remarked on {{the sheer number of}} blacks in Charleston and their seeming freedom of movement, though in fact—mindful of the Stono Rebellion and the violent slave revolution that established Haiti—the whites closely regulated the behavior of both slaves and free people of color. Wages and hiring practices were fixed, identifying badges were sometimes required, and even work songs were sometimes censored. Punishment was handled out of sight by the city's Work House, whose fees netting the municipal government thousands a year. In 1820, a state law mandated that each individual act of freeing a slave henceforth legislative approval, effectively halting the practice.|$|E
25|$|Burke was {{a leading}} sceptic with respect to democracy. While admitting that theoretically, {{in some cases it}} might be desirable, he insisted a {{democratic}} government in Britain in his day would not only be inept, but also oppressive. He opposed democracy for three basic reasons. First, government required a degree of intelligence and breadth of knowledge of the sort that occurred rarely among the common people. Second, he thought that <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> vote, common people had dangerous and angry passions that could be aroused easily by demagogues; he feared that the authoritarian impulses that could be empowered by these passions would undermine cherished traditions and established religion, leading to violence and confiscation of property. Third, Burke warned that democracy would create a tyranny over unpopular minorities, who needed the protection of the upper classes.|$|E
25|$|A {{week after}} the assassination, the Warren Commission was {{established}} by President Johnson to investigate the assassination, with Chief Justice Earl Warren leading the investigation.

25|$|There {{is a small}} {{community}} of Swedish-speaking immigrants in Finland. Many of them come from Sweden, or have resided there (about 8,500 Swedish citizens live in Finland and around 30,000 residents in Finland were born in Sweden), while others have opted for Swedish {{because it is the}} main language in the city in which they live, or because their partners are Swedish-speaking. About one quarter of immigrants in the Helsinki area would choose to integrate in Swedish <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> option. According to a report by Finland's Swedish think tank, Magma, there is a widespread perception among immigrants that they are more easily integrated in the Swedish-speaking community than in the majority society. However, some immigrants also question whether they ever will be fully accepted as Finland Swedes. Swedish-speaking immigrants also have their own association, Ifisk and in the capital region there is a publicly financed project named Delaktig aimed at facilitating integration of immigrants who know or wish to learn Swedish. Most if not all immigrants also wish to be fluent in Finnish {{due to the fact that}} it is the dominant language in Finnish society.|$|E
25|$|Ricarda Huch was {{not well}} known in the English-speaking world until the Australian critic and man of letters Clive James devoted pp.328–33 of his 2007 Cultural Amnesia: Necessary Memories from History and the Arts to her. He called her the First Lady of German humanism and as a {{bridging}} figure between Germaine de Stael and Germaine Greer. He reminds readers that she was educated at the University of Zurich, from which {{she was one of the}} first women to graduate, because in her day, German universities did not allow women to be candidates for degrees. He describes her gift for talking about the powerless as <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> importance of the powerful, as shown in her book about the Thirty Years' War. According to James, when the Nazis came to power in 1933, they sought to recruit her into the party or at least “co-opt her prestige” but she declined to cooperate. She resigned as the first woman ever elected to the Prussian Academy of Arts and wrote to composer Max von Schillings, president of the Prussian Academy, asserting that the Nazi concept of Germanness (Deutschtum) was not her Germanness. She then retired to private life in Jena (she turned 69 in 1933), effectively going into internal exile.|$|E

500|$|Early puberty {{and early}} {{masturbation}} are seen by Tripp as {{important factors in}} the development of male homosexuality, albeit not direct causes. He maintains that homosexual men tend to start masturbating earlier than heterosexual men, continue to masturbate more extensively {{for the rest of their}} lives, and also tend to have a larger than average penis size. Tripp sees early sexual experiences with persons of the same sex as having only a limited role {{in the development of}} male homosexuality. While he observes that homosexual men vary in their sexual attitudes, Tripp writes that, [...] "when two men are excited and unrestrained in their sexual interaction, the fire that is fed from both sides often does whip up levels of eroticism that are rarely reached elsewhere." [...] Tripp considers promiscuity [...] "relatively prevalent" [...] among homosexual men as a group, though he noted that not all homosexual men are promiscuous. Tripp maintains that heterosexual men would be as promiscuous as homosexual men <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> same level of opportunity. He criticizes psychotherapeutic attempts to convert homosexuals to heterosexuality, writing that Kinsey and his associates found no evidence of their effectiveness. Tripp writes that a [...] "New York psychiatrist who for a number of years has headed a large psychoanalytic research program on homosexuality" [...] admitted to Pomeroy that he knew of only one patient he had helped to become heterosexual but was on such poor terms with him that he did not feel free to contact him so that he could verify his claim to have changed his sexual orientation.|$|E
500|$|Cabernet Sauvignon {{has had a}} {{controversial}} history in Tuscan wine, particularly for {{its role in the}} arrivals of [...] "Super Tuscan" [...] in the mid-1970s. The origin of Super Tuscans is rooted in the restrictive DOC practices of the Chianti zone prior to the 1990s. During this time Chianti could be composed of no more than 70% Sangiovese and had to include at least 10% of one of the local white wine grapes. Many Tuscan wine producers thought they could produce a better quality wine if they were not hindered by the DOC regulations, particularly <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> freedom to use Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend and not required to use white grape varieties. The marchese Piero Antinori {{was one of the first}} to create a [...] "Chianti-style" [...] wine that ignored the DOC regulations, releasing a 1971 Sangiovese-Cabernet Sauvignon blend known as Tignanello in 1978. Other producers followed suit and soon the prices for these Super Tuscans were consistently beating the prices of some of the most well known Chianti. Other Tuscan wine regions followed suit, blending Cabernet Sauvignon with Sangiovese and even making varietal versions of the grape. Gradually the DOC system caught on and began allowing more regions to use the grape in their DOC designated wines. Cabernet Sauvignon in Tuscany is characterized by ripe black cherry flavors that can give a perception of sweetness as well as strong notes of blackcurrant. The wines typically reach an alcohol level around 14% but can still maintain notable levels of acidity. When blended with Sangiovese in significant quantities, Cabernet Sauvignon can dominate the blend with most Tuscan producers aiming to find a particular balance that suits their desired style.|$|E

500|$|The trio {{became so}} excited {{with the concept}} they came up with, they decided to do initial {{development}} on their own instead of pitching it to someone else. The Wachowskis wrote three hour-long spec scripts, and together with Straczynski attempted to shop them around, such as at Warner Bros. and HBO, but when they saw that nobody could understand the concept they decided to shelve it. A few years later, when they felt that the landscape of television had become friendlier towards more experimental concepts, they decided to pitch it a second time. On October 2, 2012, Variety first reported {{the existence of the}} show, by writing that the Wachowskis, with the help of Straczynski's Studio JMS and Georgeville Television, would be shopping Sense8 around Los Angeles the week to follow. If the series was picked up, the sisters and Straczynski would be sharing showrunner duties. Additionally, the Wachowskis were planning to direct a few episodes of the show if their schedule permitted it. According to Straczynski, the first meeting with potential buyers was with Netflix. The Wachowskis and Straczynski talked to them about subjects such as gender, identity, secrecy and privacy. According to Lana they pitched shooting on location all over the globe to which Netflix responded favorably, which was in contrast to the [...] "clearly impossible" [...] response they had received by other outlets during their earlier abortive attempt. They also told Netflix they were only interested <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> freedom to [...] "do anything", like [...] "crazy psychic orgies with all sorts of different bodies" [...] and [...] "live births even" [...] to which Netflix also responded positively. After the end of the meeting, despite it having seemingly gone well, they worried they had made a mistake because they had not pitched any action or otherwise commercial aspects. By noon, and before they had the chance to pitch it to other outlets, such as HBO, Netflix called them to preemptively offer to buy and produce the first season. Netflix announced that they had ordered a 10-episode first season for the series on March 27, 2013. Later, during filming, because of the density of the scripts and the extended length of the first cut of the first episode, the showrunners and Netflix came to an agreement to extend the season to 12 episodes. The Wachowskis and Straczynski's production company that was set up to run the show was named Unpronounceable Productions. The name was suggested by Straczynski, as a joke that references the difficulty of pronouncing the showrunners' long last names.|$|E
