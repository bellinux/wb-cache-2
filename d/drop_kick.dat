5|$|Michigan's first {{touchdown}} was {{scored by}} right halfback Herb Steger on a 15-yard pass from left halfback Harry Kipke. Steger missed the extra point kick. Then, {{in the second}} quarter, Steger scored his second touchdown on a 53-yard run through right tackle. Kipke's <b>drop</b> <b>kick</b> for the extra point was blocked, and Michigan led, 12–0. Kipke also missed a <b>drop</b> <b>kick</b> for field goal in the second quarter. Still in the second quarter, Steger scored his third touchdown on a pass from quarterback Irwin Uteritz. Kipke's <b>drop</b> <b>kick</b> for extra point was good, and Michigan led, 19–0, at halftime.|$|E
5|$|He {{began playing}} {{football}} at Centre in 1917, making an impact {{as a freshman}} when his 17-yard <b>drop</b> <b>kick</b> defeated the rival Kentucky Wildcats 3–0 (his only field goal). During his freshman year, McMillin was also on the track team; on April 27, 1917, he won the 220-yard dash at a Centre interscholastic track meet.|$|E
5|$|A {{day after}} their victory over Birmingham High School, Alabama {{suffered}} their first all-time loss against the Birmingham Athletic Club (B.A.C.) 5–4. In a game noted for numerous fumbles by both squads, Alabama scored first {{and took a}} 4–0 lead on a William G. Little touchdown run {{late in the first}} half. However, the B.A.C. won the game 5–4 late in the second half when J. P. Ross successfully kicked a 63-yard field goal on a <b>drop</b> <b>kick.</b> Alabama would not lose another game by a single point until their 1947 game against Tulane.|$|E
50|$|<b>Drop</b> <b>kicks</b> {{are most}} {{importantly}} {{used as a}} method of restarting play and scoring points in rugby union and rugby league. Association football goalkeepers also often return the ball to play with <b>drop</b> <b>kicks.</b> The kick was once in wide use in both Australian rules football and gridiron football, but is today rarely seen in either sport.|$|R
50|$|The {{usage of}} <b>drop</b> <b>kicks</b> in rugby sevens {{is the same}} as in rugby union, except that <b>drop</b> <b>kicks</b> are used for all {{conversion}} attempts and for penalty kicks, both of which must be taken within 40 seconds of the try being scored or the award of the penalty.|$|R

5|$|The Golden Tornado was {{the clear}} favorite. Georgia Tech outplayed Vanderbilt {{and had the}} ball for three-fourths of the game. Several of Vanderbilt's players left with injuries. Its ends were easily skirted by the Tech backs Buck Flowers, Red Barron, and Frank Ferst. Tech's first {{touchdown}} came when Barron ripped off a 55-yard run. Captain Flowers once made a <b>drop</b> <b>kick</b> from 44 yards out. Ferst came in for Flowers {{in the middle of}} the second quarter when Georgia Tech started to use substitutes.|$|E
5|$|The fair catch kick is a rule at the {{professional}} and high school levels of American football that allows {{a team that has}} just made a fair catch to attempt a free kick from the spot of the catch. The kick must be either a place kick or a <b>drop</b> <b>kick,</b> and if it passes over the crossbar and between the goalposts of the defensive team's goal, a field goal, worth three points, is scored to the offensive team.|$|E
5|$|After {{a safety}} is scored, {{the ball is}} put into play by a free kick. The team that was scored upon must kick the ball from their own 20-yard line and can punt, <b>drop</b> <b>kick,</b> or place kick the ball. In {{professional}} play, a kicking tee cannot be used – however, a tee {{can be used in}} high school or college football. Once the ball has been kicked, it can be caught and advanced by any member of the receiving team, and it can be recovered by the kicking team if the ball travels at least 10 yards and bounces at least once or a player of the receiving team touches the ball.|$|E
5000|$|Moffat was {{a member}} of the Princeton {{football}} team from 1882 to 1884. As the team's senior captain in 1883, Moffat kicked 32 field goals in 15 games. [...] In Princeton's 26 to 7 victory over Harvard in 1883, Moffat made five field goals, two <b>drop</b> <b>kicks</b> with his right foot, two <b>drop</b> <b>kicks</b> with his left foot, and one from placement.|$|R
50|$|Left-footed, Sorrell was {{a superb}} athlete and his raking <b>drop</b> <b>kicks</b> {{provided}} numerous opportunities for his forwards. His vision and anticipation marked him {{out from his}} opponents.|$|R
50|$|In rugby league, <b>drop</b> <b>kicks</b> are {{mandatory}} {{to restart}} play from {{the goal line}} (called a goal line drop-out) after the defending team is tackled or knocks on in the in-goal area or the defending team causes the ball to go dead or into touch-in-goal. <b>Drop</b> <b>kicks</b> are also mandatory to restart play from the 20 metre line after an unsuccessful penalty goal attempt goes dead or into touch-in-goal and to score a drop goal (sometimes known as a field goal) in open play, which is worth one point.|$|R
5|$|The next {{match was}} for the WWE Intercontinental Championship, in which Randy Orton defended the {{championship}} against Shelton Benjamin. The match began with Benjamin performing a <b>drop</b> <b>kick</b> on Orton, which knocked him out {{to the outside of}} the ring. Benjamin proceeded to knock Orton over the security barricade into the crowd. Orton got the advantage, after Ric Flair {{made his way to the}} ring, distracting Benjamin in the process. The match came to an end when Benjamin went off the top rope and dove onto Orton, but Orton rolled through and hooked Benjamin's tights to pin Benjamin for the three count and retaining the Intercontinental Championship.|$|E
5|$|The Flyers {{last game}} of the 1920 season was against the Gas City Tigers. The Tigers signed up several players to help them defeat the Flyers. The first quarter was scoreless, as the only near score was from a failed <b>drop</b> <b>kick</b> from the Flyers. The first score of the game came in the second quarter. Weaver of the Tigers {{returned}} a punt 85yards for a touchdown. On the Tigers' next possession, they dropped a pass in the endzone on fourth down. Early in the third quarter, {{a member of the}} Tigers fumbled, and the Flyers recovered it on the 5-yard line. Huffine score a rushing touchdown on that possession to tie the game 7–7. The last score of the game came from the Flyers; Checkaye returned a punt 60yards for a touchdown to give the Flyers a 13–7 victory. The Tigers almost scored on their final possession on the game but fumbled.|$|E
5|$|The {{three types}} of {{scrimmage}} kicks are place kicks, drop kicks, and punts. Only place kicks and drop kicks can score points. The place kick is the standard method used to score points, because the pointy shape of the football {{makes it difficult to}} reliably <b>drop</b> <b>kick.</b> Once the ball has been kicked from a scrimmage kick, it can be advanced by the kicking team only if it is caught or recovered behind the line of scrimmage. If it is touched or recovered by the kicking team beyond this line, it becomes dead at the spot where it was touched. The kicking team is prohibited from interfering with the receiver's opportunity to catch the ball, and the receiving team has the option of signaling for a fair catch. This prohibits the defense from blocking into or tackling the receiver, but the play ends as soon as the ball is caught and the ball may not be advanced.|$|E

5|$|In 1884 {{a team of}} New Zealanders, {{organised}} by the Canterbury {{player and}} administrator William Millton, and Dunedin businessman Samuel Sleigh, was selected to tour New South Wales. This is now officially regarded as the first New Zealand representative rugby side. Warbrick was included in a squad that was selected from throughout the country; the entire endeavour was performed without the oversight of a national body – several provincial rugby unions existed, but the New Zealand Rugby Football Union was not formed until 1892. The squad's 19 players were expected to assemble in Wellington before disembarking for Sydney on 21 May, however Warbrick missed his ship from Auckland and so travelled to Sydney alone. Millton was elected captain, and Sleigh managed the team. The side won all eight of their matches on tour, including the three games against New South Wales. Warbrick appeared in seven matches and scored three drop goals; {{one of the goals}} was reportedly kicked from well inside his own half. He played at both fullback and three-quarter, and was noted for his good ball handling and speed, as well as his ability to <b>drop</b> <b>kick.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Welsh backs {{repeatedly}} {{exposed the}} three threequarter system {{used by the}} English, as once the Welsh backs broke through the pack there was little defensive-cover to prevent run away scores. With the score at 9–7 to England, Marshall extended the lead with his third try of the match. This gave England an 11–7 lead with only ten minutes remaining. The game swung again when Percy Phillips received ball quickly before passing to Gould. Gould broke through the English defence and scored, though again Bancroft missed the conversion. With further Welsh pressure, a penalty was awarded to Wales on the English 25-yard line, but at a wide angle. Accounts differ as to what happened; some say that Gould tried to place the ball for Bancroft, but failed on the frozen ground, another states that Bancroft defied his captain to take the penalty as a <b>drop</b> <b>kick,</b> while other accounts mention Bancroft and Gould arguing on the pitch before Bancroft's attempt. Regardless, Bancroft kicked the penalty, the first penalty to be scored in an international match. It was the final score {{of the game and}} Wales were victorious, 12–11.|$|E
5|$|After his NFL career ended, Lillard {{joined the}} Westwood Cubs of the Pacific Coast Football League for the 1934 season, {{throwing}} the most touchdown passes of any {{player in the}} league and compiling the second-most touchdowns on runs. In 1935, he drew interest from coach Fritz Pollard, who was leading the New York Brown Bombers, a semi-professional team of African-American players. Based in Harlem, the team competed against minor league sides and clubs not affiliated with a league. Lillard had played for a Chicago team coached by Pollard before entering the NFL, and decided to join the Brown Bombers. In his first game with the team, on October 13, 1935, Lillard scored two touchdowns against the Cagle All-Stars in a 28–6 New York win. After three more victories, the Brown Bombers faced the Passaic Red Devils, a three-time champion of Eastern American football leagues. Despite suffering from an illness, Lillard converted a <b>drop</b> <b>kick</b> attempt and intercepted a pass, returning it 52yards for a touchdown. He was responsible for all of the Brown Bombers' points in their 10–3 win over the Red Devils. Lillard stayed with the Brown Bombers through the 1937 season; the team went out of business in 1938. That year, {{he was a member of}} an All-Star team of black players that played an exhibition game against the Bears, losing 51–0.|$|E

50|$|He played {{mainly as}} a ruck-rover {{resting on the}} backline, sharing the duties with Hugh Mitchell. He was a strong {{overhead}} mark, a fearless defender, and widely acknowledged {{as one of the}} best <b>drop</b> <b>kicks</b> in the VFL.|$|R
25|$|It {{appears that}} when the game was first played the types of kicks used were the punt kick, the place kick and the <b>drop</b> <b>kick.</b>|$|E
25|$|Movement of {{the ball}} and scoring: four downs are allowed to advance the ball ten yards for a first down, or to score. Six points for a touchdown. One point for a {{conversion}} by place kick after a touchdown or safety is scored off any conversion attempt, two points for a conversion by <b>drop</b> <b>kick</b> or for successful run or pass after a touchdown. Three points for a field goal by placement or four points for a field goal by <b>drop</b> <b>kick.</b> Two points for a safety or for a defensive turnover off any conversion attempt returned for a touchdown.|$|E
25|$|The <b>drop</b> <b>kick</b> was an {{important}} feature of the game for many decades mainly because of its accuracy, but it fell into disuse as {{the pace of the}} game speeded up and it was rarely used after the 1960s.|$|E
50|$|October 13: In a midweek game, Princeton {{found itself}} losing 6-5 to visiting Virginia Tech after an {{interception}} was {{returned for a}} touchdown. The Tigers stayed unbeaten (4-0-0) on a <b>drop</b> <b>kicked</b> field goal {{in the last four}} minutes.|$|R

25|$|The {{tactics of}} the times made the play {{essentially}} a kicking game. The backs <b>kicked</b> punts, <b>drop</b> <b>kicks,</b> and place kicks... Not only was the ball kicked as at present, but it was kicked, and cleverly kicked, while bouncing upon the ground.|$|R
25|$|The ball can {{be kicked}} in any {{direction}} and is used as an attacking option or to gain territory. There are three types of kicks used; the punt, <b>drop</b> <b>kick</b> and place kick. To punt the ball the player must kick the ball before it touches the ground. A <b>drop</b> <b>kick</b> occurs if the ball first bounces on the ground before being kicked. With a place kick the ball must {{be placed on the}} ground (usually on a kicking tee or in sand) before being kicked. Slight variations that commonly occur are taps, when a player kicks the ball a very short distance and regathers it, and toe-throughs, when a player kicks the ball along the ground instead of diving on it or picking it up.|$|E
25|$|Former {{assistant}} Bernie Bierman's Mississippi Aggies {{took the}} lead 3–0 in the opening quarter with a <b>drop</b> <b>kick.</b> Harry P.

25|$|Play stops when a try is scored, {{the ball}} crosses the side line or dead ball line, or an {{infringement}} occurs. After a team scores points, {{the other team}} restarts the game at the halfway with a <b>drop</b> <b>kick</b> towards the opposition. The team with the most points at the end wins the game.|$|E
25|$|Punt: Kicking {{the ball}} {{after it has}} been {{released}} from the kicker's hand and before it hits the ground. Punts may not score a field goal, even if one should travel through the uprights. As with <b>drop</b> <b>kicks,</b> players may punt at any time.|$|R
50|$|<b>Drop</b> <b>kicks</b> are {{optional}} for {{a penalty}} kick {{to score a}} penalty goal (this being done rarely, as place kicks are generally used) and when kicking for touch (the sideline) from a penalty, although the option of a punt kick is usually taken instead.|$|R
50|$|During the game, {{the wind}} was such a factor that it aided the Titan's punter who, with a quick 1-step <b>drop,</b> <b>kicked</b> a punt {{travelling}} 70 yards past scrimmage before hitting the ground. It appeared to contribute to difficulties with short passes and long snaps.|$|R
