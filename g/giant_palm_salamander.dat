He would sit in apparent indifference, gazing in another direction, while the crippled creature, wriggled slowly and painfully away from him, and then, just as his victim felt assured of escape, he would reach out a <b>giant</b> <b>palm</b> and slam it down upon the fugitive. Again and again he repeated this operation, until, tiring of the sport, he ended the sufferings of his plaything by devouring it.|$|R

40|$|The {{mystery of}} the trees of Rapa Nui (Easter Island) is a complex problem within a dynamic ecosystem. With new {{physical}} cores from the volcanic crater lake Rano Kao, this dissertation uncovers a detailed 15, 000 year ecological history of Easter Island and its climatic variability. New radiocarbon dating methods establish a more precise chronology which shows that the island before human habitation was very different than what we know today. It had a simple but prolific ecology that transitioned into a barren grassland. What factors caused the transition are unclear but {{are likely to be}} human related. As the forests slowly disappeared, it could have triggered changes in regional and local climate, particularly rainfall, which generally leads to a rapid loss of ecosystems. With virtually stable climate conditions over the last 2, 000 years, Easter Island has lost 33 species of plants including the <b>giant</b> <b>palms,</b> and still has not recovered today. This research challenges the previously accepted theory that humans deforested the island {{for the sole purpose of}} moving the Moai around, and focuses rather on uncovering the role of climate change that may have altered the ecosystem. New cores were obtained in 2005 from Rano Kao that were radiocarbon dated using scirpus seeds. The nine meters of core were sampled for oxygen isotope analysis of the lake water changes, a new science to the island. Detailed palynological studies of pollen and non-pollen palynomorphs uncovered changing vegetation patterns that aligned with a 700 year drought cycle. Conclusions support a cool-dry event that occurred 545 years ago, at which time the <b>giant</b> <b>palms</b> disappeared. While it was not the focus of this study, evidence confirms human occupation for more than 500 years before the disappearance of the trees...|$|R

50|$|PT Asiatic Persada is a {{palm oil}} firm from Jambi, Indonesia. It {{was founded in}} 1979. Its oil palm {{plantations}} spread over an area of approximately 270 km2. Wilmar International has sold PT Asiatic Persada due to its alleged involvement in land grabs.The forest of Bungku village was cleared for <b>giant</b> <b>palm</b> oil plantations of PT Asiatic Persada in the mid-1980s. In the following years, the company’s bulldozers illegally claimed a further 200 km2 of rain forest — an area about {{half the size of}} Berlin, including areas for which indigenous peoples held guaranteed land rights. Ganda Group, owned by Ganda Sitorus, the younger brother of Martua Sitorus, the co-founder of Wilmar International, bought PT Asiatic Persada in 2013. In the same year, the governor of Jambi urged officials to review PT Asiatic Persada’s license because of violations of the law. Copies of the letter were also sent to the Justice Ministry and the national police chief.|$|R
25|$|The Lincoln Park Conservatory offers year-round {{displays}} of plants {{from many different}} climates around the world. Today's conservatory was built in stages from 1890 to 1895. It consists of a vestibule, four display halls and fifteen propagating and growing houses. The vestibule and Palm House were built and {{opened to the public}} in 1892 and contain <b>giant</b> <b>palms</b> and rubber trees, including a 15m (50ft) fiddle-leaf rubber tree planted in 1891. In the Palm House, one can also find Garden Figure, a sculpture by Frederick Hibbard. The Fern Room or Fernery was opened in 1895. It contains plants of the forest floor, primarily a vast collection of ferns. The Tropical Room was originally called the stove house. Opened in 1895, it contained an assortment of tropical plants suspended from bark-covered walls. It is now called the Orchid Room and has a collection of approximately 25,000 natural species. The Display House is used for seasonal flower and plant exhibits. A docent program run by the Chicago Park District and Lincoln Park Conservancy provides free tours of the Conservatory and its outdoor gardens from 1-4 p.m. on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays and from 9 to Noon on Saturdays.|$|R

Remnants of this vegetation exist in a number gullies in Highgate Hill leading to the river.|$|R
25|$|On {{the death}} of George Loddiges in 1846, the nursery {{business}} passed to his son Conrad Loddiges II (1821–1865), who found {{it increasingly difficult to}} negotiate a new lease from the land-owner (St. Thomas' Hospital), given the much higher prices the land could now command for housing development, due to London's growth into the surrounding countryside. Similarly, the part of the nursery that was owned by the Loddiges family in freehold, was becoming more valuable as building land, whilst losing its attractive countryside village setting. Conrad was involved with the display of ferns and terrariums for the Great Exhibition. The nursery closed in stages between 1852 and 1854 due to expiry of the lease from St. Thomas' Hospital. Conrad Loddiges II offered the whole of the exotic plant stock to Kew Gardens for a sum of £9000 (20 years earlier the collection was valued at £200,0000) but this was refused. Many rare plants were auctioned via Stevens auctioneers, including rare orchids sold to John Day who would later become famous as a botanical illustrator. Joseph Paxton purchased 300 palms and plants for the opening of the new Crystal Palace at Sydenham. The Illustrated London News of 5 August 1854 illustrated plumed horses pulling a <b>giant</b> <b>palm</b> tree through the City of London on its way to be prominently displayed by Paxton in time for the opening of the Crystal Palace by Queen Victoria.|$|R
50|$|Although Easter Island {{currently}} has only 48 {{different kinds of}} plants as evidenced by botanical surveys of the island, it once possessed many more, shown through pollen analysis conducted on sediment layers from swamps or ponds. From these samples, 22 no longer present on the island were shown to have existed at some time there. These plants included a <b>giant</b> <b>palm,</b> the Rapa Nui Palm, that showed signs of being the largest palm species in the world, eclipsing {{the size of the}} Chilean Wine Palm if it were not extinct. There are also signs of Easter Island's once possessing a far more diverse collection of fauna. The skeletal remains of 25 different species of nesting bird have been located on the island, but have since been reduced to 16. This trend of extinction and extirpation is a common occurrence when humans populate a new area, because of tendencies to overhunt and overexploit resources. Deforestation would have caused a decrease in crop yields due to soil erosion, loss of wood as a resource to construct fishing boats, among other things, and would have necessitated a halt to the construction of the moai erected around the island. Diamond hypothesizes that resource scarcity may have led to brutal civil war, creating a drop in population. He further hypothesizes that there were about 7,000 individuals pre-war, which fell to the 2,000 missionaries met when they showed up in the 19th century and conducted the first census of the island.|$|R

50|$|Neighborhood DevelopmentKnob Hill Addition was {{situated}} between the Southern Pacific Depot and South Heights rail car lines {{and within a}} five-minute walk to two public schools on cement sidewalks and along macadamized streets. All lots in the addition were offered at $500 to $800, were fronted north and south, and included the luxury of city water and gas. The streets, lined with a six-foot easement between the sidewalks and curb, were planted with palm trees and Ligustrum japonicum. The home at 1145 Virginia currently occupied by the University of Texas San Antonio (UTSA), Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity, Omicron Tau Alumni Chapter still has two of the <b>giant</b> <b>palms</b> flanking the front entrance. Homes along these tree-lined streets were set back 25 feet from the front property line on terraced lots to ensure symmetry of the development and avoidance of dust from the streets. The original Knob Hill plat consisted of 96 lots with 24 even lots per block {{for a total of}} 4 blocks. By early 1911, 11 homes had been completed at a cost of $3,000 to $10,000 each. Major construction for the development occurred between 1910 and 1935. According to the 1915 City Directory, 27 addresses were listed including those of owners W.T. Goode and R.H. and Harry Traylor. Goode lived at 1125 Virginia Avenue and R.H. Traylor at 101 Nelson Avenue, which was replaced around 1997. Harry Traylor also resided in Knob Hill. By 1951, only six vacant lots remained. Today, there are 89 lots with 2 lots vacant. In addition to the home of the Kappa Alpha Psi chapter described above, Knob Hill is the home of the UTSA-affiliated Omega Psi Phi fraternity, Psi Alpha Chapter, which is located at 1135 Virginia Avenue.|$|R
