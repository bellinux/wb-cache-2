5|$|The {{noble gas}} atoms, like atoms in most groups, {{increase}} steadily in atomic radius from one period {{to the next}} due to {{the increasing number of}} electrons. The size of the atom is related to several properties. For example, the ionization potential decreases with an increasing radius because the valence electrons in the larger noble gases are farther away from the nucleus and are therefore not held as tightly together by the atom. Noble gases have the largest ionization potential among the elements of each period, which reflects the stability of their electron configuration and is related to their relative lack of chemical reactivity. Some of the heavier noble gases, however, have ionization potentials small enough to be comparable to those of other elements and molecules. It was the insight that xenon has an ionization potential {{similar to that of the}} oxygen molecule that led Bartlett to attempt oxidizing xenon using platinum hexafluoride, an oxidizing agent known to be strong enough to react with oxygen. Noble gases cannot accept an electron to form stable anions; that <b>is,</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> a negative electron affinity.|$|E
25|$|All {{vertebrates}} (including humans) {{have the}} same basic body plan they are strictly bilaterally symmetrical in early embryonic stages and largely bilaterally symmetrical in adulthood. That <b>is,</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> mirror-image left and right halves if divided down the centre. For these reasons, the basic directional terms can {{be considered to be}} those used in vertebrates. By extension, the same terms are used for many other (invertebrate) organisms as well.|$|E
25|$|Some traits do {{not appear}} to be adaptive, that <b>is,</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> a neutral or {{deleterious}} effect on fitness in the current environment. Because genes have pleiotropic effects, not all traits may be functional: they may be what Stephen Jay Gould and Richard Lewontin called spandrels, features brought about by neighbouring adaptations, like the triangular areas under neighbouring arches in architecture which began as functionless features.|$|E

That <b>they</b> <b>were</b> of those of whom it is written, 'Let him that <b>is</b> athirst come.' <b>They</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> athirst for Life. <b>They</b> <b>had</b> had instincts and longings; very simple and humble, but very pure and noble. At times, it may <b>be,</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> unfaithful to those instincts. At times, it may <b>be,</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> fallen. <b>They</b> <b>had</b> said 'Why should I not do like the rest, and be a savage? Let me eat and drink, for to-morrow I die;' and <b>they</b> <b>had</b> cast themselves down into sin, for very weariness and heaviness, and were for a while as the beasts which have no law.|$|R

25|$|Like {{the video}} camera, most {{sampling}} schemes are periodic; that <b>is,</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> a characteristic sampling frequency in time or in space. Digital cameras provide {{a certain number}} of samples (pixels) per degree or per radian, or samples per mm in the focal plane of the camera. Audio signals are sampled (digitized) with an analog-to-digital converter, which produces a constant number of samples per second. Some of the most dramatic and subtle examples of aliasing occur when the signal being sampled also has periodic content.|$|E
25|$|These are diodes that {{conduct in}} the reverse {{direction}} when the reverse bias voltage exceeds the breakdown voltage. These are electrically {{very similar to}} Zener diodes (and are often mistakenly called Zener diodes), but break down by a different mechanism: the avalanche effect. This occurs when the reverse electric field applied across the p–n junction causes a wave of ionization, reminiscent of an avalanche, leading to a large current. Avalanche diodes are designed to break down at a well-defined reverse voltage without being destroyed. The difference between the avalanche diode (which has a reverse breakdown above about 6.2V) and the Zener is that the channel length of the former exceeds the mean free path of the electrons, resulting in many collisions between them on {{the way through the}} channel. The only practical difference between the two types <b>is</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> temperature coefficients of opposite polarities.|$|E
25|$|Many island species evolved {{on small}} islands, or even {{restricted}} habitats on small islands. Small populations {{are vulnerable to}} even modest hunting, and restricted habitats are vulnerable to loss or modification of said habitat. More importantly, island species are often ecologically naive, that <b>is</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> not evolved alongside a predator, or have lost appropriate behavioural responses to predators. This often resulted in flightlessness, or unusual levels of tameness. This made many species susceptible to hunting (it is thought, for example, that moas were hunted to extinction {{in a few short}} generations) and to predation by introduced species. Some, such as the dodo, are thought to have become extinct because of the pressure of both humans and introduced animals. One estimate of birds in the Pacific islands puts the extinctions at 2000 species. Between 40 and 50% of the bird species of New Zealand have become extinct since 200 AD.|$|E

2500|$|Isocyanates {{are very}} {{reactive}} materials. This makes them useful in making polymers but also requires special care in handling and use. [...] The aromatic isocyanates, diphenylmethane diisocyanate (MDI) or toluene diisocyanate (TDI) are more reactive than aliphatic isocyanates, such as hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI) or isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI). Most of the isocyanates are difunctional, that <b>is</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> exactly two isocyanate groups per molecule. An important {{exception to this}} is polymeric diphenylmethane diisocyanate, which {{is a mixture of}} molecules with two, three, and four or more isocyanate groups.

2500|$|Complexes {{that have}} {{unfilled}} or half-filled orbitals often show {{the capability to}} react with substrates.

[...] Some substrates (e.g., molecular oxygen) have a triplet ground state, which results that metals with half-filled orbitals have a tendency to react with such substrates (it must be said that the dioxygen molecule also has lone pairs, so it is also capable to react as a 'normal' Lewis base).|$|E
