40|$|One of {{the decay}} {{mechanisms}} of historical earthen walls of Ajina Tepa (Tajikistan) {{is represented by}} salt crystallization. Halite, calcite and gypsum are found in abundance on the historical walls. Because the rate of crystallization {{is thought to be}} a function of evaporation, this was measured by using a newly developed a portable <b>evaporation</b> <b>meter.</b> Before the measurement, the accuracy of the <b>evaporation</b> <b>meter</b> was carefully studied under both no-wind and wind conditions in laboratory and field tests in Japan. The effect of average wind velocity on the evaporation measurement was also evaluated before the measurement. It was found that the evaporation rate is high {{at the foot of the}} wall and it decreases on top. This feature implies that moisture is mainly supplied from ground and that a protective shelter coat is needed to prevent the destruction of historical wall due to salt crystallization...|$|E
40|$|On-farm storages {{can be a}} {{major source}} of water loss on cotton farms. Previous studies in the Macintyre valley (Dalton 2001) {{indicated}} seepage losses of between 2 % and 10 % and evaporation losses of between 14 % and 40 % of all farm water in a year. In order to better understand the range of seepage and evaporation losses across the whole industry, the project 'Measurement to Improve the Water Efficiency of On-Farm Storages in the Cotton Industry', was established in 2008 to undertake storage seepage and evaporation measurements. This project was specifically designed to also encourage the ongoing measurement of storage seepage and evaporation losses using newly developed measurement technology. A network of consultants was utilised to undertake measurements for 136 storages across all cotton regions using the Irrimateâ„¢ Seeepage and <b>Evaporation</b> <b>Meter.</b> ...|$|E
40|$|Australia is {{employing}} mitigation {{technologies to}} counter annual evaporation losses from irrigation storage dams and channels. Annual evaporation losses from these storages {{are estimated to}} be around 1. 32 GL/yr and up to 2. 88 GL/yr. A water balance approach provides a practical approach for estimating aggregate losses due to evaporation. The accuracy of this method depends greatly on the accuracy of the equipment used to measure the change in water depth. Monitoring systems and data analysis techniques have recently been commercialized by Aquatech Consulting as the Irrigate Seepage and <b>Evaporation</b> <b>Meter.</b> Chemical covers have been promoted as a low cost method to reduce evaporation losses. These products are generally biodegradable and {{there is a need to}} reapply frequently (between three and ten days). Monolayers also offer much potential for affecting evaporation savings but inconsistent evaporation saving performance has limited their adoption in Australia. ...|$|E
40|$|Persian Gulf {{region is}} {{globally}} {{of great importance}} due to its economical and political reasons. The importance lies in oil sources and sea exports. Geophysical phenomena dominated in the water circulation affected this region is called Monsoon it stretches from African coasts to the half way of Red Seal affected all coasts of Persian Gulf and goes toward east to the Indian ocean. Other essential factors in the water circulation in this region are net <b>evaporation</b> (several <b>meters</b> in per year), high density and high salinity. In this article the effects of wind stress and evaporation in the water circulation in the region will be considered and model equations for wind forces, density, pressure, gradient, and bottom friction for Persian Gulf will be discussed...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the possibility that}} infants with breath-holding spells have breathing disorders during sleep. Seventy-one breath holders with a median age of 14 weeks were selected from a well babies clinic because of their histories: 34 infants without loss of consciousness, and 37 with loss of consciousness (21 of the latter had had cyanotic spells, 14 pallid spells, and 2 combined cyanotic and pallid spells). For each breath holder, one control infant without a history of breath holding was chosen from the same clinic. All infants were healthy and had no known cause of disrupted breathing during sleep. Their histories indicated that the breath holders were covered with sweat during sleep (p = 0. 005) or wakefulness (p = 0. 006) significantly more often than were the control infants. The infants were studied during a one-night monitoring session, and the 142 sleep recordings were analyzed without knowledge of the history. The breath holders had significantly less nonrapid eye movement (stage III) sleep, more indeterminate sleep, more arousals, and more sleep-stage changes than the control infants had. Central apneas were evenly distributed in the two groups. Airway obstructions were found in 41 breath holders and six control infants; the obstruction lasted longer in the breath holders. The infants with airway obstruction during sleep snored more often (p = 0. 023) and sweated more (p = 0. 035) during sleep. The water evaporation rate, measured on the forehead with an <b>evaporation</b> <b>meter,</b> was significantly greater in the breath holders (p = 0. 001). Ocular compression induced longer asystoles in the infants with pallid syncopes than in either those with cyanotic syncopes (p = 0. 036) or those without loss of consciousness (p = 0. 031). We conclude that the obstructed breathing during both wakefulness and sleep {{could be related to}} a common immature breathing control. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
