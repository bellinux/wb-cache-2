5|$|The British Army during World War I was {{the largest}} {{military}} force that Britain had put into the field up to that point.

French casualties amounted to more than 12percent of their force, and Austrian, approximately four percent. The French were forced back to Stockach, where on 25March the armies engaged again, this time with greater losses on both sides, and a decisive Austrian victory.|$|E

The French withdrew to Engen and Stockach, where {{a few days later}} the armies engaged again, this time with greater losses on both sides, and an Austrian victory.|$|E
5|$|Another {{addition}} to the <b>fighting</b> <b>force</b> debuting in Halo 2 were Drones, or Yanme'e (from the planet Palamok); the animators found the creatures challenging, as {{they had to be}} animated to walk, run, crawl, or fly on multiple surfaces. Old concept art from Combat Evolved was re-purposed in influencing the Drone's final shape, which took cues from cockroaches, grasshoppers, and wasps.|$|E
5|$|As Barksdale's men pushed toward Sickles's {{headquarters}} {{near the}} Trostle barn, the general {{and his staff}} began {{to move to the}} rear, when a cannonball caught Sickles in the right leg. He was carried off in a stretcher, sitting up and puffing on his cigar, attempting to encourage his men. That evening his leg was amputated, and he returned to Washington, D.C. Gen. Birney assumed command of the III Corps, which was soon rendered ineffective as a <b>fighting</b> <b>force.</b>|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of the losses it had suffered, the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) had ceased to be an {{effective}} <b>fighting</b> <b>force.</b> Following a series of raids on the Japanese shipyard at Kure, Japan, the only major warships in fighting order were six aircraft carriers, four cruisers, and one battleship, none of which could be fueled adequately. Although 19destroyers and 38submarines were still operational, their use was limited by the lack of fuel.|$|E
5|$|Having {{recovered}} from their losses at Trebia (218 BC) and Lake Trasimene (217 BC), the Romans decided to engage Hannibal at Cannae, with roughly 86,000 Roman and allied troops. They massed their heavy infantry in a deeper formation than usual, while Hannibal utilized the double-envelopment tactic. This {{was so successful}} that the Roman army was effectively destroyed as a <b>fighting</b> <b>force.</b> Following the defeat, Capua and several other Italian city-states defected from the Roman Republic to Carthage.|$|E
5|$|According to Eastern Han-era sources, the Northern Army was a {{relatively}} small <b>fighting</b> <b>force</b> of between 3,500 and 4,200 professional soldiers, each regiment consisting of approximately 750 soldiers and 150 junior officers. To aid this force, Emperor Guangwu established a 1,000-soldier unit of army reserves in Liyang County along the Yellow River in 43 AD, while two other reserve units were created in 110 AD; these were headed by a Commandant (the same title used for the commandery-level military officer). The main purpose of these reserve units was to position Han troops at strategic passes to guard the lower Wei River against Xiongnu, Wuhuan, and Tibetan tribes.|$|E

5|$|It was {{the first}} battle in the War in Afghanistan in which Afghan army units were the {{principal}} <b>fighting</b> <b>force.</b> Statements from the British Ministry of Defence (MOD) emphasised that the operation was Afghan-led, although the ability of Afghan units to function without NATO control was questioned during the battle. Military engagement over Musa Qala {{is part of a}} wider conflict between coalition forces and the Taliban in Helmand. Both before and after the battle, related fighting was reported across a larger area, particularly in Sangin district to the south of Musa Qala.|$|E
5|$|Raised in 1940 {{as part of}} the Second New Zealand Expeditionary Force (2NZEF), the 28th (Māori) Battalion was {{attached}} to the 2nd New Zealand Division as an extra battalion that was moved between the division's three infantry brigades. The battalion fought during the Greek, North African and Italian campaigns during which it earned a formidable reputation as a <b>fighting</b> <b>force</b> which has subsequently been acknowledged by both Allied and German commanders. It was also the most decorated New Zealand battalion during the war. Following the end of hostilities, the battalion contributed a contingent of personnel to serve in Japan {{as part of the}} British Commonwealth Occupation Force, before being disbanded in January 1946.|$|E
5|$|The {{destruction}} of the North Korean Army at Pusan made communist continuation of the war impossible with North Korean troops alone. The massive equipment and manpower losses rivaled those of the ROK Army in the first stages of the war. The North Koreans totally collapsed as a <b>fighting</b> <b>force,</b> and the remainder of their routed military retreated into North Korea offering very weak resistance against the UN force, which was now on the offensive with overwhelming superiority by land, air and sea. Many of the outmaneuvered North Korean units simply surrendered, having been reduced from units of thousands {{to just a few}} hundred men.|$|E

5|$|The rise of Macedon, {{from a small}} kingdom at the {{periphery}} of classical Greek affairs to one which came to dominate the entire Hellenic world (and beyond), occurred {{in the span of}} just 25 years, between 359 and 336 BC. This ascendancy is largely attributable to the personality and policies of Philip II (r. 359–336 BC). In addition to utilising effective diplomacy and marriage alliances to achieve his political aims, Philip II was also responsible for reforming the ancient Macedonian army into an effective <b>fighting</b> <b>force.</b> The Macedonian phalanx became the hallmark of the Macedonian army during his reign and the subsequent Hellenistic period. His army and engineers also made extensive use of siege engines.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the Pacific War, remnants of the United States Asiatic Fleet fled to Australia, on orders from Washington. The S-boats from the Philippines were organized into a <b>fighting</b> <b>force</b> at Brisbane, and Admiral Ernest King ordered S-boats from the Atlantic Fleet to supplement the force in Australia. Christie went along, arriving in April 1942, {{just in time for the}} Battle of the Coral Sea. During the Solomon Islands campaign, he ordered his boats to patrol around harbors which, while being key points for shipping, also tended to be heavily patrolled by aircraft and anti-submarine craft. In step with then-current U.S. Navy submarine doctrine, he made capital ships the prime targets, rather than have his boats focus on merchant shipping.|$|E
5|$|During {{the period}} when various Islamic empires {{controlled}} much of the Middle East as well as parts of West Africa and the Iberian peninsula, Muslim armies consisted mostly of cavalry, made up of fighters from various local groups, mercenaries and Turkoman tribesmen. The latter were considered particularly skilled as both lancers and mounted archers. In the 9th century the use of Mamluks, slaves raised to be soldiers for various Muslim rulers, became increasingly common. Mobile tactics, advanced breeding of horses, and detailed training manuals made Mamluk cavalry a highly efficient <b>fighting</b> <b>force.</b> The use of armies consisting mostly of cavalry continued among the Turkish people who founded the Ottoman Empire. Their need for large mounted forces lead to an establishment of the sipahi, cavalry soldiers who were granted lands in exchange for providing military service in times of war.|$|E

5|$|Even {{though the}} Viet Cong {{had won a}} clear victory over the regular units of the South Vietnamese army, they did not get away with light casualties. After the battle, a {{combined}} total of 126 Viet Cong bodies were recovered within the Special Forces compound and the district headquarters, and several hundred more were strewn all over the battlefield. Indeed, individual Viet Cong soldiers usually spare no efforts to evacuate their dead or wounded comrades; but as military operations were conducted during the rainy season, the Viet Cong struggled to evacuate all their casualties from the battlefield as conditions on the main roads deteriorated. Despite the minor setbacks, the Đồng Xoài campaign marked the rapid maturity of the Viet Cong 9th Division as a <b>fighting</b> <b>force.</b> For their efforts during the battle, the Viet Cong 272nd Regiment received the title of 'Đồng Xoài Regiment' to mark their achievements.|$|E
5|$|Financially the Militia was {{neglected}} also. Despite the upturn in {{the economic}} situation in the early 1930s there was little financial respite for the Militia in this time. As the situation continued to improve, however, the defence vote was increased steadily after 1935. Indeed, in 1938 the government decided to double {{the strength of the}} Militia as war clouds began to loom on the horizon, and late in the year a recruiting campaign was launched that saw the size of the Militia increase from 35,000 to 43,000 men over the space of three months. This trend continued into 1939 and by midway through the year there were over 80,000 men serving on a part-time voluntary basis. Nevertheless, there was a serious shortage of equipment and as a result, when World War II broke out in September 1939 the Militia was by no means an effective <b>fighting</b> <b>force</b> and {{the nation as a whole}} was not as well prepared for war as it had been in 1914.|$|E
5|$|The Allies {{called for}} {{unconditional}} Japanese surrender in the Potsdam Declaration of 27 July, but the Japanese government rejected the call. In early August, the USAAF dropped atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The Allies justified the atomic bombings {{as a military}} necessity to avoid invading the Japanese home islands which would cost the lives of between 250,000 and 500,000 Allied servicemen and millions of Japanese troops and civilians. Between the two bombings, the Soviets, pursuant to the Yalta agreement, invaded Japanese-held Manchuria, and quickly defeated the Kwantung Army, which was the largest Japanese <b>fighting</b> <b>force.</b> The Red Army also captured Sakhalin Island and the Kuril Islands. On 15 August 1945, Japan surrendered, with the surrender documents finally signed at Tokyo Bay {{on the deck of}} the American battleship USS Missouri on 2 September 1945, ending the war.|$|E
