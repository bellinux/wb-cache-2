50|$|In 1210 Pope Innocent III excommunicated High Duke Leszek. Mieszko IV Tanglefoot quickly conquered Kraków {{and took}} the title of High Duke. The <b>excommunication</b> <b>bull</b> was issued {{at the request of}} an {{anonymous}} Duke of Silesia, probably Henry (because Mieszko IV used the title Duke of Racibórz-Opole). The situation became quite confused and no one was sure who held the real power.|$|E

50|$|Although {{probably}} an atheist during the War of Independence, he returned {{later in life}} to the Catholic church. On forming the Neutral Group of the IRA in December 1922, he tried to unify differences in the volunteers between Republicans and the Free Staters. He communicated with the Papal Nuncio during the inter-war years {{in an attempt to}} have Bishop Colahan's <b>excommunication</b> <b>bull</b> lifted. Instead he turned to commemoration as a way to earn favour in Rome, with the dedication of a catholic church in Finnbarr's cemetery. After his wife's passing he became a close friend with Florence O'Donoghue until his own death, knowing the importance of benediction.|$|E

Urban's successor Gregory VIII nullified Peter's <b>excommunication</b> in a <b>bull</b> issued on November 30, 1187, whereupon Peter returned to his diocese, which he set himself to putting in order.|$|R
50|$|The quiet {{government}} of Leszek over Kraków after the deposition of Władysław III Spindleshanks was interrupted in 1210 with his <b>excommunication</b> in the <b>Bull</b> issued by Pope Innocent III. This fact {{was used by}} Mieszko Tanglefoot, who quickly conquered Kraków and took the title of High Duke for himself. The Bull was issued by the request of an anonymous Duke of Silesia, which could have only been Henry I the Bearded (because Mieszko used {{the title of a}} Duke of Racibórz-Opole). The situation became quite confused, as nobody was sure who held the real power.|$|R
500|$|Mary {{was soon}} the focus for rebellion. In 1569 {{there was a}} major Catholic rising in the North; the goal was to free Mary, marry her to Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk, and put her on the English throne. After the rebels' defeat, over 750 of them were {{executed}} on Elizabeth's orders. In the belief that the revolt had been successful, Pope Pius V issued a bull in 1570, titled Regnans in Excelsis, which declared [...] "Elizabeth, the pretended Queen of England and the servant of crime" [...] to be excommunicate and a heretic, releasing all her subjects from any allegiance to her. Catholics who obeyed her orders were threatened with <b>excommunication.</b> The papal <b>bull</b> provoked legislative initiatives against Catholics by Parliament, which were, however, mitigated by Elizabeth's intervention. In 1581, to convert English subjects to Catholicism with [...] "the intent" [...] to withdraw them from their allegiance to Elizabeth was made a treasonable offence, carrying the death penalty. From the 1570s missionary priests from continental seminaries came to England secretly in the cause of the [...] "reconversion of England". Many suffered execution, engendering a cult of martyrdom.|$|R
