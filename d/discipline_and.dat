5|$|Academic reviewers {{were mostly}} positive, but several raised {{concerns}} over Berger's incorrect use of terminology.

In the years following the study's publication, Berger continued to investigate the Pagan community, focusing her interest on the popularity of Wicca among teenagers.|$|E

5|$|According to this view, {{the barbarian}} {{officers}} and men {{recruited by the}} late army, coming from tribes that were traditional enemies of Rome, had no real loyalty to Rome and often betrayed her interests, colluding with invading barbarian tribes, especially if those tribes were their own. At the same time, the spread of barbarian customs and culture led {{to a decline in}} traditional military <b>discipline,</b> <b>and</b> internal army disunity due to friction between Romans and barbarians. Ultimately, the army degenerated into just a collection of foreign mercenary bands that were incapable of defending the empire effectively.|$|E
5|$|Active duty {{officers}} in the rank of captain or major serve as Company Tactical Officers (TAC Officers). The role of the TAC is to mentor, train, and teach the cadets proper standards of good order and <b>discipline</b> <b>and</b> be a good role model. There is one TAC for every cadet company. There is also one senior Non-Commissioned Officer to assist each TAC, known as TAC-NCOs.|$|E
5|$|American {{officers}} serving under Pulaski {{had difficulty}} taking orders from a foreigner who could scarcely speak English and whose ideas of <b>discipline</b> <b>and</b> tactics differed enormously from those {{to which they}} were accustomed. This resulted in friction between the Americans and Pulaski and his fellow Polish officers. There was also discontent in the unit over delays in pay, and Pulaski's imperious personality was a regular source of discontent among his peers, superiors, and subordinates. Pulaski was also unhappy that his suggestion to create a lancer unit was denied. Despite a commendation from Wayne, these circumstances prompted Pulaski to resign his general command in March 1778, and return to Valley Forge.|$|E

In 2010, Australia's sole representative Alexei Almoukov came second last in his event—one competitor did not finish.

5|$|Geology is {{the science}} and study of the solid and liquid matter that {{constitutes}} the Earth. The field of geology encompasses {{the study of the}} composition, structure, physical properties, dynamics, and history of Earth materials, and the processes by which they are formed, moved, and changed. The field is a major academic <b>discipline,</b> <b>and</b> is also important for mineral and hydrocarbon extraction, knowledge about and mitigation of natural hazards, some Geotechnical engineering fields, and understanding past climates and environments.|$|E
5|$|In contrast, the {{excellent}} {{performance of the}} infantry, both comitatenses and limitanei, is a recurrent feature of Ammianus' history. At the Persian siege of Amida, Ammianus' eye-witness account describes the city's defence by limitanei units as skilful and tenacious, if ultimately unsuccessful. At Strasbourg (357), the infantry showed remarkable skill, <b>discipline</b> <b>and</b> resilience throughout, saving the day at two critical moments.(see Battle of Strasbourg for a detailed account). Even at the disaster of Adrianople, the Roman infantry fought on, despite being abandoned by their cavalry and surrounded on three sides by overwhelmingly superior numbers of Goths.|$|E

5|$|In {{early modern}} Europe, the {{systematic}} study of fossils emerged {{as an integral part}} of the changes in natural philosophy that occurred during the Age of Reason. In the Italian Renaissance, Leonardo Da Vinci made various significant contributions to the field as well designed numerous fossils. At the end of the 18th century Georges Cuvier's work established comparative anatomy as a scientific <b>discipline</b> <b>and,</b> by proving that some fossil animals resembled no living ones, demonstrated that animals could become extinct, leading to the emergence of paleontology. The expanding knowledge of the fossil record also played an increasing role in the development of geology, particularly stratigraphy.|$|E
5|$|In the U.S. Marine Corps, {{sergeant}} major is the ninth and highest enlisted rank, just above first sergeant, and equal in grade to master gunnery sergeant, {{although the two}} have different responsibilities. A {{sergeant major}} typically serves as the unit commander's senior enlisted adviser and to handle matters of <b>discipline</b> <b>and</b> morale among the enlisted Marines. The Sergeant Major of the Marine Corps is chosen by the Commandant of the Marine Corps to serve as his adviser and is the preeminent and highest ranking enlisted Marine with a protocol equivalency of a lieutenant general.|$|E
