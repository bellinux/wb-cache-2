60|$|Stolen from Artemis that jealous maid To please Athena, and the <b>dappled</b> <b>hide</b> Of a tall stag who in some {{mountain}} glade Had met the shaft; {{and then}} the herald cried, And from the pillared precinct one by one Went the glad Greeks well pleased that they their simple vows had done.|$|E
60|$|I {{followed}} {{her eyes with}} a certain thrill of pride. Wheat land, many of the dusty cattle, broad stretch of prairie, barns, and buildings were mine, and the sinewy statuesque horsemen, who came up across the levels behind further bunches of <b>dappled</b> <b>hide</b> and tossing horns, moved at my bidding. By physical strain and mental anxiety I had steadily extended the boundaries of Gaspard's Trail, and, had I been free from Lane, would in one respect have been almost satisfied. Then I looked up at my companion, whose pale-tinted draperies and queenly head with its clustering dark locks were outlined against the golden straw, and a boldness, {{as well as a}} great longing, came upon me.|$|E
5000|$|The myth of Diana and Actaeon can {{be found}} within Ovidâ€™s Metamorphoses. The tale recounts the unfortunate fate of a young hunter named Actaeon, who was a {{grandson}} of Cadmus, and his encounter with chaste Artemis, known to the Romans as Diana, goddess of the hunt. The latter is nude and enjoying a bath in a spring with help from her escort of nymphs when the mortal man unwittingly stumbles upon the scene. The nymphs scream in surprise and attempt to cover Diana, who, {{in a fit of}} embarrassed fury, splashes water upon Actaeon. He is transformed into a deer with a <b>dappled</b> <b>hide</b> and long antlers, robbed of his ability to speak, and thereafter promptly flees in fear. It is not long, however, before his own hounds track him down and kill him, failing to recognize their master.|$|E
