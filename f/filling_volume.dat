40|$|Effect of {{increased}} dialysate <b>fill</b> <b>volume</b> on peritoneal fluid and solute transport. It {{has recently been}} recommended that the peritoneal dialysate volume should in general be increased to increase the peritoneal small solute clearances. However, the net ultrafiltration volume may decrease due to higher intraperitoneal hydrostatic pressure (IPP) and higher peritoneal fluid absorption induced by higher <b>fill</b> <b>volume.</b> In the present study, we investigated the effects of increasing the <b>fill</b> <b>volume</b> on peritoneal fluid and solute transport. A four-hour dwell study with frequent dialysate and blood sampling was performed in 32 male Sprague-Dawley rats using 16 ml, 25 ml, 30 ml or 40 ml (8 rats in each group) of 3. 86 % glucose solution with 131 I albumin as an intraperitoneal volume marker. The peritoneal transport of fluid, glucose, urea, sodium, potassium, phosphate and total protein as well as IPP with different <b>fill</b> <b>volume</b> were evaluated. The IPP and peritoneal fluid absorption rate (as estimated from the 131 I albumin elimination coefficient, KE) significantly increased with increase in <b>fill</b> <b>volume</b> (P < 0. 05), whereas the direct lymphatic absorption did not change with increasing <b>fill</b> <b>volume.</b> There was {{a strong correlation between}} IPP and KE. However, the net ultrafltration volume was significantly higher in the high <b>fill</b> <b>volume</b> groups compared to the low <b>fill</b> <b>volume</b> groups, mainly due to a better maintenance of the dialysate to plasma glucose concentration gradient in the high <b>fill</b> <b>volume</b> groups. There {{was no significant difference in}} the diffusive mass transport coefficients (KBD) and sieving coefficients for any of the investigated solutes, although KBD values tended to be lower in the 16 ml group. The clearances for small solutes increased with increased <b>fill</b> <b>volume,</b> although these increases were slightly smaller than predicted from the increase in <b>fill</b> <b>volume.</b> We conclude that: (1) An increase in dialysate <b>fill</b> <b>volume</b> using 3. 86 % glucose solution results in higher intraperitoneal hydrostatic pressure and higher peritoneal fluid absorption, but, on the other hand, a higher net ultrafiltration; (2) The increase in net ultrafiltration with increased <b>fill</b> <b>volume</b> is mainly due to a better maintenance of glucose concentration in the dialysate, inducing an increased transcapillary ultrafiltration rate; (3) Solute clearances increase although not quite to the same extent as predicted from the increase in <b>fill</b> <b>volume.</b> Our results indicate that decreased net ultrafiltration volume associated with higher dialysate <b>fill</b> <b>volume</b> (due to higher IPP and higher peritoneal fluid absorption) could be avoided if hypertonic glucose solutions are used...|$|R

50|$|During diastole, the {{ventricular}} pressure {{falls from}} the peak reached {{at the end of}} systole. When this pressure falls below the atrial pressure, atrio-ventricular valves open (mitral valve at left side and tricuspid valve at right side) and the blood passes from the atria into the ventricles. First, ventricles are filled by a pressure gradient but near the end, atria contract (atrial kick) and force more blood to pass into ventricles. Atrial contraction is responsible for around 20% of the total filling blood volume. (In atrial fibrillation, this additional 20% <b>filling</b> <b>volume</b> is lost and the patient may experience systolic heart failure symptoms). Complete left ventricular filling is essential to maintain maximum cardiac output. Left ventricular filling is dependent upon ventricular relaxation and compliance, mitral valve area, atrio-ventricular gradient, atrial contraction and end-systolic volume. Diastole has four phases: isovolumetric relaxation, rapid filling, diastasis and atrial contraction. All of these phases can be evaluated by Doppler echocardiography.|$|E

The CVC was then trimmed by 5 cm and the experiment repeated. 3 repeat measurements were obtained and catheters were fully flushed with air between readings. A telephone survey of tertiary Paediatrics Intensive Care units (PICUs) in England was performed in September 2013. Recom-mended CVC lock volumes were recorded. A prospective audit of trimmed CVC lengths was performed at the time of insertion. Results The MicroClave ® connector adds 0. 04 mls to the <b>fill</b> <b>volume</b> of a CVC. Trimming the CVC to its minimum length can reduce the <b>fill</b> <b>volume</b> by 50 % compared to the manufac-turer’s data. The correlation between total CVC length and <b>fill</b> <b>volume</b> is a linear one, allowing CVC <b>fill</b> <b>volumes</b> to be accu-rately estimated (Fig 1).

By analogy, diastolic compensatory mechanisms that maintain <b>filling</b> <b>volume</b> must exist, but {{remain to be}} fully elucidated. Viewing filling in spatially distinct (longitudinal, radial) mechanistic terms facilitates elucidation of diastolic compensatory mechanisms. Because impairment of longitudinal (long-axis) diastolic function (DF) in left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is established, we hypothesized that to maintain <b>filling</b> <b>volume,</b> radial (short-axis) filling function would compensate. In 20 normal ejection fraction (LVEF) subjects (10 with LVH, 10 non-LVH controls), we analyzed longitudinal function via Doppler tissue imaging of mitral annular motion and radial function as change in short-axis endocardial dimension via M-mode.

40|$|Hyaluronan {{prevents}} the decreased net ultrafiltration caused by increased peritoneal dialysate <b>fill</b> <b>volume.</b> In the present study, we investigated (1) {{the effect of}} an increase in dialysate <b>fill</b> <b>volume</b> on peritoneal fluid and solute transport using a 1. 36 % glucose solution, and (2) the effect of intraperitoneal administration of hyaluronan on peritoneal transport characteristics when different <b>fill</b> <b>volumes</b> were used. A four-hour dwell study with frequent dialysate and blood sampling was performed in 26 male Sprague-Dawley rats with 131 I albumin as the intraperitoneal volume marker. Each rat was injected intraperitoneally with 25 ml (group Con 25, N = 6) or 40 ml (group Con 40, N = 7) of 1. 36 % glucose dialysis solution alone or 25 ml (group HA 25, N = 6) or 40 ml (Group HA 40, N = 7) of 1. 36 % glucose dialysis solution with 0. 01 % hyaluronan. The peritoneal transport of fluid, glucose, urea, and total protein as well as the intraperitoneal hydrostatic pressure (IPP) with different <b>fill</b> <b>volumes</b> were evaluated. We found that IPP and peritoneal fluid absorption rate significantly increased with the increase in <b>fill</b> <b>volume</b> (P < 0. 01), and therefore the net ultrafiltration volume was significantly lower in the Con 40 group compared to the Con 25 group despite a higher transcapillary ultrafiltration rate in the Con 40 group. The addition of hyaluronan to dialysate significantly (P < 0. 01) decreased the peritoneal fluid absorption rate (by 22 % in HA 25 vs. Con 25 and by 29 % in HA 40 vs. Con 40) and thus significantly increased the net peritoneal fluid removal. The diffusive mass transport coefficients for glucose, urea and total protein did not differ between the Con 25 and Con 40 groups or between the two hyaluronan groups as compared to their respective control groups. The peritoneal clearance of urea increased significantly in the high <b>fill</b> <b>volume</b> group (by 58 % in Con 40 vs. Con 25) and in the two hyaluronan groups (by 21 % in HA 25 vs. Con 25 and by 16 % in HA 40 vs. Con 40). We conclude that: (1) An increase in dialysate <b>fill</b> <b>volume</b> using 1. 36 % glucose dialysis solution results in higher intraperitoneal hydrostatic pressure and higher peritoneal fluid absorption rate, and therefore lower net ultrafiltration. (2) Intraperitoneal addition of hyaluronan significantly decreases the peritoneal fluid absorption rate, and the decreasing effect is even more marked when a high <b>fill</b> <b>volume</b> is used. (3) Small solute clearances increase markedly with increases in <b>fill</b> <b>volume,</b> and then further increase by adding hyaluronan to the dialysate due to the increase in drainage volume. Thus, intraperitoneal administration of hyaluronan during a single peritoneal dialysis exchange may significantly increase the peritoneal fluid and solute removal by decreasing peritoneal fluid absorption, and may thereby prevent the decreased net ultrafiltration caused by an increase in dialysate <b>fill</b> <b>volume...</b>|$|R

We employed this model in an attempt to mimic actual clinical scenarios. Using our sigmoid fitting method, we confirmed previous two major findings regarding the relationship between balloon <b>filling</b> <b>volume</b> and geometric volume and surrounding pressure [14, 15]. First, the balloon <b>filling</b> <b>volume</b> is determined by the geometric volume of the balloon (Fig. 3): the larger the geometric volume, the larger the balloon <b>filling</b> <b>volume</b> that is needed to reflect surrounding pressure. Second, the balloon <b>filling</b> <b>volume</b> required for accurate measurement increases as the balloon surrounding pressure increases (Fig. 4). The latter finding is of clinical significance during esophageal monitoring in passive patients under controlled ventilation. Because pleural pressure increases during inspiration, the balloon volume suitable for measuring during the end-expiratory phase may not be adequate for measurement during the end-inspiratory phase. Fortunately, this did not occur in our bench model with simulated pleural pressures ranging from 5  cmH 2 O during end-expiratory occlusion to 20  cmH 2 O during end-inspiratory occlusion.

30|$|One of {{the major}} factors {{affecting}} both bacterial cell growth and recombinant protein expression is the concentration of dissolved oxygen in the medium. It is commonly accepted, that high oxygen transfer rates lead to higher cell densities in bacterial cell cultures (Losen et al. 2004, Collins et al. unpublished). In shake flask fermentations, the OTR is influenced by several factors namely shaking frequency and shaking diameter, <b>filling</b> <b>volume,</b> flask shape and size, surface properties of the flask material and the physical-chemical properties of the liquid (Maier and Büchs 2001). Increasing the shaking frequency or lowering the <b>filling</b> <b>volume</b> leads to higher OTR due to liquid mixing and a high area of contact that allows efficient oxygen diffusion (Maier and B&#x 00 FC;chs 2001; McDaniel et al. 1965; McDaniel and Bailey 1969).

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Pre-analytical {{variability}} currently {{represents the}} most important source of errors {{that can lead to}} inaccurate patient results in monitoring of patients being treated with oral anticoagulant therapy. The volume of blood collected is critical for accurate coagulation results. The National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) recommends a ratio of blood to anticoagulant volume of 9 : 1. However, investigators have published reports which suggest that a lower ratio may be acceptable. Unfortunately the recommendations of these reports are inconsistent. AIM: The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the impact of tube <b>fill</b> <b>volume</b> on INR values both in healthy subjects and patients receiving oral anticoagulation therapy.
