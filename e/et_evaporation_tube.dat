The particle number measurement system {{consists of a}} volatile removal unit followed by a particle number counter with a 50 % cut-point diameter at 23 nm. The volatile removal unit must achieve a > 99 % concentration reduction of a monodisperse aerosol of tetracontane (CH 3 (CH 2) 38 CH 3) particles of diameter = 30 nm with inlet concentration = 104 cm- 3. In this paper the evaporation of tetracontane particles in the volatile removal unit is investigated theoretically. The temperature and the residence time in the <b>evaporation</b> <b>tube</b> are discussed, {{as well as the}} possibility of nucleation events of evaporated particles at the exit of the <b>evaporation</b> <b>tube.</b> In addition, sulfuric acid nucleation at the <b>evaporation</b> <b>tube</b> exit is analyzed. Theoretical calculations are, finally, compared to experimental data. Our main conclusion is that the volatile removal efficiency requirements of the legislation can be easily met. However, as some experimental measurements showed, the removal efficiency might differ for large particle sizes and high concentrations; thus, the results of particle number counters with a 50 % cut-point diameter less than 23 nm should be interpreted with care.

The effects of gas stream flow regimes in the sample transport line and dilution strategies for removal of the volatile fraction on measured PM size distribution are evaluated behind a simulated aero-derivative gas turbine exhaust using a fast mobility DMS 500 particle sizer. The PM size distribution and concentration within the primary transport sample was found to be relatively insensitive to flow regime, with conditions of turbulent flow (lowest residence time) providing the highest number concentrations, and hence least losses. However, given the natural variation of PM production from the combustor source the statistical certainty of these observations require consolidation. A ‘bespoke’ volatile particle removal system based on the European automotive PMP protocol was constructed to allow the effects of dilution ratio and <b>evaporation</b> <b>tube</b> residence time to be investigated. It was shown that both strategies of increasing dilution ratio and residence times in the <b>evaporation</b> <b>tube</b> did not affect the size distribution at the two distinct nucleation and accumulation modes to any statistical certainty.

The mineral fraction undergoes strong modifications and it {{is involved in the}} fouling of evaporator surface at increasing concentrations and temperature. In order to identify the composition of the fouling deposit, the behavior of the mineral fraction was studied during the concentration by evaporation of by-products of the manufacture of fresh cheeses and acid casein, lactic acid whey and hydrochloric acid whey respectively. These latter have the same pH (about 4. 6) and are strongly mineralized, but differ from their mineral composition: lactic acid whey contains a high level of lactic acid but no citrate ion whereas hydrochloric acid whey contains citrate ion and no lactic acid. Concentration of both wheys was performed using a pilot-scale falling-film evaporator. Concentrates at different concentration factors (up to 6) were prepared and their mineral composition were determined experimentally. Total and soluble concentrations were compared to the theoretical values obtained by multiplying the concentration factor and the initial concentrations in the raw materials. The composition of the precipitates formed in the concentrates and on the <b>evaporation</b> <b>tubes</b> was then deduced. The behavior of the mineral fraction of both acid wheys during evaporation was shown very different. The concentration of lactic acid whey did not lead to the formation of mineral precipitate of calcium phosphate or other salts. On the contrary, precipitation of calcium citrate occurred into the concentrate during the concentration of hydrochloric acid whey. Moreover, losses of citrate and calcium in the concentrates were deduced, suggesting calcium citrate deposit {{on the surface of the}} <b>evaporation</b> <b>tubes.</b> This study underlines the key-role of citrate ion in the fouling of evaporators during the concentration of acid whey.

The calculated results show that the average velocity and the film thickness change sharp at the entrance region when x 100 mm. The film thickness depends largely on the flow rate of solution.

Molybdenum oxide (MoOx) submicron structures were grown on lithium niobate (LiNbO 3) substrates via the thermal evaporation of MoO 3 nanopowder at 750 °C in a horizontal tube furnace. A mixture of 90 % argon and 10 % oxygen was introduced into the thermal <b>evaporation</b> <b>tube</b> at flow rate of 1 L/min.

Target {{of this paper was}} to investigate whether existing PN measurement equipment are capable of measuring below 23 nm. More specifically, it was investigated 1) whether all volatile particles can be removed efficiently in the PN measurement systems 2) whether any artifacts happen in the PN systems (e. g. formation of non-volatile particles due to pyrolysis), and 3) whether by lowering the lower size the measurement uncertainty increases significantly. The main conclusions are: 1) The volatiles are not always removed efficiently in the PN measurement systems. The major issue is re-nucleation of sulfuric acid downstream of the <b>evaporation</b> <b>tube.</b> These particles typically do not grow at sizes above 23 nm. 2) There are indications of formation of 10 nm solid particles from hydrocarbons and sulfuric acid in the PN systems. 3) The measurement uncertainty due to differences between commercial systems will increase.

Although A. caroliniana had higher frond area index (FAI) and specific frond area, its CER per unit frond weight was significantly lower than A. microphylla and A. pinnata at a photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) of 300 μmol m^ s^ probably due to mutual shading; at 1300 μmol m^ s^, however, the differences in CERs among the species were not significant.

40|$|As the {{legislation}} on vehicle emissions {{is becoming more}} and more stringent, increasing attention has been paid to the fine particles emitted by diesel and gasoline vehicles. The high number emission of fine particles has been shown to have a large impact on the atmospheric environment and human health. Researchers have shown that gasoline engines, especially Gasoline Direct Injection (GDI) engines, tend to emit large amounts of small size particles compared to Port Fuel Injection (PFI) gasoline engines and diesel engines fitted with Diesel Particulate Filters (DPFs). As a result, the particle number emissions of GDI engines will be restricted by the EU 6 legislation. The particulate emission level of GDI engines means that they would face some challenges in meeting the EU 6 requirement. This thesis undertakes research in the following area. Firstly, the filtration efficiencies of glass fibre filters were quantified using a Cambustion Differential Mobility Spectrometer 500 (DMS 500) to see if all of the particles from the sampled gas can be collected by the filters. Secondly, various valve timings and different injection modes such as double injection with a second injection after compression, single early injection and split early injection were implemented to measure the Particulate Matter (PM) emissions and combustion characteristics of a GDI engine under warm-up operating conditions. Thirdly, the techniques for removing volatile particles were investigated using a catalytic Volatile Particle Remover (VPR) and an <b>Evaporation</b> <b>Tube</b> (<b>ET)</b> with hot air dilution under various test conditions. The results show that for the glass fibre filters tested here, the transmission efficiencies of the particles are very low, indicating that PM sampling using fibre filters is an effective method of studying the particulate emissions from the engine. Particle number emissions using double injection with injection after compression were much higher than those with single injection during the intake stroke. Under 1200 rpm, 110 Nm cold engine operation, no reduction effect on PM emissions was shown by using split intake injection to further facilitate homogeneous mixture formation compared with single intake injection. Valve timings showed moderate effects on particulate emissions. Properly adjusted timing for exhaust valve closure led to reduced particulate emissions by a factor of about 2 and the combustion characteristics were not adversely affected much. The VPR temperature and exhaust residence time did not show much effect on the catalytic VPR performance once the mass flow rate of exhaust was above 0. 09 g/s. Generally, the transmission efficiencies of the VPR follow the trends of the scaled PMP counting efficiency specification. Hot air dilution is effective in reducing the small size particles. At 23 nm, the transmission efficiencies are within the error range of the PMP specification. The catalytic VPR and the <b>Evaporation</b> <b>Tube</b> were all found to be effective in reducing the particle number of small size (nucleation mode) particles. Both systems have some particle loss mainly due to the physical effects of diffusion and thermophoresis. Until now, GDI engines have not been optimised for reducing particulate emissions as the focus has been on gaseous emissions and fuel economy. With careful re-optimisation of the catalyst light-off and engine calibration (especially for transients) then there is scope for GDI engines to meet forthcoming emissions legislation.

Extension to gasoline direct injection vehicles raised concerns because many studies found particles below the lower size limit of the method (23 nm). Here we investigated experimentally the feasibility of lowering this size. A nano condensation nucleus counter system (nCNC) (d 50 % = 1. 3 nm) was used in parallel with condensation particle counters (CPCs) (d 50 % = 3 nm, 10 nm and 23 nm) at various sampling systems based on ejector or rotating disk diluters and having thermal pre-treatment systems consisting of <b>evaporation</b> <b>tubes</b> or catalytic strippers. An engine exhaust particle sizer (EEPS) measured the particle size distributions. Depending on the losses and thermal pre-treatment of the sampling system, differences of up to 150 % could be seen on the final detected particle concentrations when including the particles smaller than 23 nm in diameter. A volatile artefact as particles with diameters below 10 nm was at times observed during the cold start measurements of a 2 -stroke moped. The diesel vehicles equipped with the Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) had a low solid sub- 23 nm particles fraction (< 20 %), the gasoline with direct injection vehicles had higher (35 – 50 %), the gasoline vehicles with port fuel injection and the two mopeds (two and four-stroke) had the majority of particles below 23 nm. The size distributions peaked at 60 – 80 nm for the DPF equipped vehicles, at 40 – 90 nm for the gasoline vehicles with a separate nucleation mode peak at approximately 10 nm sometimes.

This paper focuses on Particulate Matter (PM) emissions by mass {{and number of}} a representative light-duty Diesel vehicle equipped with a DPF and employing a fuel-borne catalyst (FBC) to aid regeneration. PM emissions and solid particle numbers according to the Particle Measurement Programme (PMP) proposals and regulated gaseous emissions were acquired throughout testing. According to the PMP recommendations, a particle number counter was employed downstream of an <b>evaporation</b> <b>tube</b> sampling from the CVS to measure solid particles. In addition, an Engine Exhaust Particle Sizer (EEPS) connected directly to the CVS was used to give real time number and size distributions, both volatile and nanoparticles. The effect of cold start (at 23 °C) is discussed, especially for particle number emissions. Low temperature start (- 7 °C) gave increased gaseous emissions but resulted in small changes in PM and number concentration compared to the 23 °C tests. The paper focuses on particle emissions changes in response to types of regenerations. Real time size distributions show nucleation mode evolution during regeneration events. When the vehicle speed changes during active DPF regenerations a second nucleation mode peak may appear due {{to changes in the}} oxidation process of the deposited material in the DPF. NEDC emissions of total solid and volatile particles during regenerating cycles are two orders of magnitude higher than those from non regenerating cycles. However, non-volatile particle emissions levels observed from regenerating cycles stay at the same order as non-regenerating cycles. Differences between emissions before and after regeneration are discussed for both PM mass and number.

40|$|Observed and {{projected}} trends in riparian evapotranspiration (<b>ET)</b> and free-water <b>evaporation</b> are {{examined in this}} study to help improve water demand forecasting, particularly in modeling of lower Colorado River system reservoir operations. While most previous research in the Colorado River basin have focused on the impacts of climate change and climate variability on water supply, the impacts of changing climate on water demand have not been adequately addressed. Changes in temperature, precipitation, and wind patterns are expected to increase evaporative demands in the lower Colorado River mainstream, including free-water <b>evaporation</b> and <b>ET</b> from riparian vegetation, and may also impact infiltration rates, alter cropping patterns, and change the temporal and spatial distribution of water deliveries. This study utilized historic {{and projected}} hydroclimatic variables, such as temperature, wind, and precipitation, to analyze their impacts on riparian <b>ET</b> and free-water <b>evaporation</b> in the lower Colorado River mainstream. Analysis of historic and projected hydroclimatic data shows that mean annual daily temperature in the lower Colorado River mainstream reach has increased by 0. 8 ° Celsius (C) from the 30 -year period ending in 1980 to the 30 -year period ending in 2010 and is projected to increase by an additional 1. 7 ° C by the 30 -year period ending in 2060. Estimates of riparian <b>ET</b> and free-water <b>evaporation</b> indicate that the combined evaporative demands in the lower Colorado River mainstream have increased by 14, 750 acre-feet, or 1. 8 percent, during the 30 -year period ending in 2010, and may increase by an additional 16, 600 acre-feet, or 2. 0 percent, during the 30 -year period ending in 2060, when compared to the period from 1951 to 1980. Due the highly regulated nature of the lower Colorado River mainstream, projected increases in evaporative demands are assumed to be decoupled from changes in environmental demand. Projected changes in evaporative demands under different climate scenarios were assessed to determine their potential impacts on reservoir operations in the Colorado River basin. Increases in evaporative demands are projected to reduce the combined storage of Lake Powell and Lake Mead by a cumulative volume of 75, 400 acre-feet, or 0. 15 percent of total conservation capacity, based on 10 -year running averages from 2020 to 2060. In addition to reductions in reservoir storage, average annual shortage volumes in the lower Colorado River basin are projected to increase by 40, 000 acre-feet, or 0. 30 percent, from 2012 to 2060. Trends of increasing evaporative demands in the recent past and projected increases under changing climate conditions have implications for water managers and stakeholders attempting to balance future water supply and use in the lower Colorado River basin. Incorporating dynamic evaporative demands into operational modeling will help to improve demand forecasting.

40|$|As diesel PM {{regulation}} {{gets more}} stringent, the current gravimetric method {{which has been}} used for legal determination of PM mass for vehicle emissions will have difficulty accurately quantifying PM mass emissions. Progress in regulating diesel PM emissions by non-gravimetric means has been made in the Europe. The method, so called particle measurement program (PMP) protocol specifies counting solid particles larger than 23 nm. This method has already been adopted for Euro V and VI to regulate light-duty and heavy-duty vehicle emissions and it is also expected to be adopted to regulate emissions for aviation section. However, exclusion of sub- 23 nm particles poses some potential issues. In this thesis, the PMP method was investigated with a focus on finding the nature of sub- 23 nm particles which are excluded in the current PMP protocol. A PMP-compliant system, an AVL advanced particle counter (APC) and an alternative volatile particle removal system, a catalytic stripper (CS) were evaluated and compared for measuring solid particle number emissions in chapters 2 and 3. The evaluations and comparisons were conducted using sulfuric acid and hydrocarbon particles as model volatile particles in laboratory tests, and diluted exhaust from a diesel particle filter (DPF) -equipped heavy-duty diesel vehicle operated on a heavy-duty chassis dynamometer under steady speed conditions at two different engine loads. Thisstudy also compared particulate matter (PM) mass and particle number (PN) emissions from a heavy-duty diesel vehicle operating over the urban dynamometer driving schedule (UDDS) and actual on-road flow-of-traffic driving conditions, including two uphill (phases 1 and 2) and two downhill (phases 3 and 4) segments. The UDDS and on-road flow-of-traffic tests represent a broader engine operating conditions than those currently certified emissions testing cycles. For the laboratory test, both the APC and CS removed more than 99 % of the volatile particles in terms of PN when using aerosols composed of pure sulfuric acid or hydrocarbons. When using laboratory test aerosols consisting of mixtures of sulfuric acidand hydrocarbons more than 99 % of the particles were removed by the APC but the surviving particles were no longer entirely volatile, with 12 - 14 % being solid. For the chassis dynamometer test, PN emissions of particles between 3 and 10 nm downstream of the APC were 2 and 7 times higher than the PN emissions of particles above 10 nm at the 74 and 26 % engine load, respectively. At the 26 % engine load, PNlevel of the 3 to 10 nm particles downstream of the APC were significantly higher than that in the dilution tunnel, demonstrating that the APC was making 3 to 10 nm particles. The PN emissions of 3 to 10 nm particles downstream of the APC were related to theheating temperature of the APC <b>evaporation</b> <b>tube,</b> suggesting these particles are artifacts formed by renucleation of semivolatiles. Considerably fewer particles between 3 to 10 nm were seen downstream of the CS for both engine loads due mainly to removal of semivolatile material by the catalytic substrates, although some of this difference could be attributed to diffusion and thermophoretic losses. Chapter 4 provides an evaluation of the nature of sub 23 nm particles downstream of the European PMP methodology with prescribed cycles and on-road flow-of-traffic driving conditions. Particle number concentrations and size distributions were measured using two PMP measurement systems in parallel. For this analysis, {{the focus is on the}} real-time results from multiple instruments. The results revealed that a significant fraction of particles downstream of both PMP systems for all tested cycles werebelow 11 nm. The fraction of sub 11 nm particles observed downstream of the PMP system decreased when the overall dilution ratio of one PMP system was increased from 300 to 1500, suggesting those sub 11 nm particles were formed through re-nucleation of semivolatile precursors. When the <b>evaporation</b> <b>tube</b> temperature was increased from 300 to 500 °C, no difference in particle number concentrations was observed, suggesting incomplete evaporation of semivolatile particles did not contribute to those sub 11 nm particles. Particle emissions were about one order of magnitude higher during flow-of-traffic driving along a highway with a steep grade than during the prescribed driving cycles. During the same flow-of-traffic condition, a sudden jump of PMP operationally defined solid particle concentration was observed, while the accumulation mode particle concentrations in the constant volume sampling (CVS) tunnel measured by engine exhaust particle sizer (EEPS) only showed a slight increase. This discrepancy was attributed to the extensive growth of the re-nucleated particles downstream of the PMP systems. In chapter 5, the PMP system was evaluated over a standard laboratory testing cycle and uphill and downhill on-road, flow-of-traffic driving conditions. The PM mass emissions for the UDDS and on-road tests were more than 6 times lower than the U. S. 2007 heavy-duty PM mass standard. The PM mass emissions for the UDDS fell between those for the uphill and downhill driving on-road driving conditions. The PN emissions of particles larger than 23 nm for the UDDS and downhill on-road driving conditions were 3 times lower than the Euro VI heavy-duty PN limit for transient cycles, while the PN emissions from the uphill on-road driving conditions were 4 to 5 times higher than the Euro VI PN limit. The PN emissions of particles larger than 23 nm for the UDDS (with an average engine load of 38 %) were comparable in magnitude to those for the phase 3 downhill segment (with an aveage engine load of 40 %) of the on-road test, and were 25 % lower than those for the phase 4 downhill segment (with an avearage engine load of 18 %) of the on-road test. The variability of the PN emissions of particles larger than 23 nmranged from 10 to 40 % for the UDDS and on-road tests, comparable to that found in the European PMP study...|$|R

The field instrumentation included detailed monitoring of volumetric water content, matric suction and temperature within the embankment as well as measurements of meteorological data. The field measurements show that the used instrumentation worked well on monitoring the soil responses to the meteorological changes in the two soils. The study also evaluates different empirical methods for estimating potential <b>evaporation</b> (<b>ET)</b> values based on regional meteorological data. The results show a large variability observed on the ET values for the investigated site calculated by empirical methods or equations based on meteorological local date...|$|R
30|$|Although Hombolo dam (HD) high {{salinity}} {{has been}} debated for over 20  years, its origin remains unclear. While some studies associated it with high dam surface <b>evaporation</b> (<b>ET)</b> (Shindo 1991), others linked it to geological origin, {{but would not}} clearly indicate the mechanisms (Nkotagu 1996). All, previous studies, however, did not show the spatial source of the salts that would end up being concentrated by ET nor assess water suitability for various uses. Furthermore, available data at Hombolo Irrigation Scheme (HIS), which started in 1995, do not suggest a significant rainfall dilution and that the dam retains high salinity year-round (Shindo 1991; Shemsanga et al. 2015). This suggests that the water feeding the dam could already be saline, details of which remains to be investigated.|$|R
40|$|The {{milk powder}} {{facilities}} {{of the factory}} Nestle La Penilla covers from the reception of the milk to the dryer and dry mix of the different products. Milk from Nestle farmers is analyzed to check its quality, if everything is correct the milk undergoes thermization, which consists of a heat treatment to reduce the microbial flora for further storage in silos. Milk is standardized and is treated in the evaporator, which aims {{to reduce the amount}} of water. In the dairy industry, the evaporation is used to concentrate products like milk, skimmed milk and dairy whey. It is also used as a preliminary treatment before drying. Dissolved solids in milk do not evaporate, so there is an increase of the concentration in the liquid phase. To perform this operation triple effect falling film evaporator plus a finisher is used. The objective of this project is to increase the evaporator capability. There are several points to improve: i) Increase the mass flow treated for each product, in the case of condensed milk from 7. 500 L/h to 8. 000 L/h and in products like 1 % milk Sveltesse and 26 % milk from 7. 800 L/h up to 8. 000 L/h. ii) Reduce the time required for sterilizations. iii) Optimization of operating conditions. However, this objective is subjected to the following restriction: the quality of the product, measured as the amount of total solids at the evaporator outlet, a theoretical 75 % for condensed milk and 44 % to 1 % and 26 % milk respectively, has to be maintained. The DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve and Control) methodology, used by Six Sigma, is used systematically in the company Nestle to solve problems appearing during operation. DMAIC methodology is divided into five stages that are solved iteratively. Therefore, this is the methodology employed in the present work. It has been observed and reported that the overall efficiency and production is improved due to automation. So, control loops, process sequences or valves and pumps operation have been modified in this work. The main result of the project has been achieved because the capability of the evaporator has been increased, so now it can be operating 350 hours more. This is due to an increase in the flow of the products to 8. 000 L/h and because the sterilization time has been reduced at an average of 47, 3 minutes for sterilization. Savings in water consumption have been also obtained, corresponding to 114, 5 m 3 /yr due to reduced sterilizations and 1. 260 m 3 per year in the automation, which represents 1. 374, 5 m 3 /yr. An increase in the temperature of the separator finisher has been achieved up to an average of 52 °C, which allows, together with the enhancement in the milk distribution into the <b>evaporation</b> <b>tubes</b> due to the increment of flow, a reduction in the pressure of the thermocompressor about 0, 5 bar. All these improvements have been carried out without affecting the quality of the product. Máster en Ingeniería Químic...|$|R

The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate how vegetation cover changes in composition and structure affected the water budgets of a 9. 6 -km 2 Dakeng watershed located in a humid subtropical mountainous region in southern China. We analyzed 27 years (i. e., 1967 - 1993) of streamflow and climate data and associated vegetation cover change in the watershed. Land use ⁄ land cover census and Normalized Difference of Vegetation Index (NDVI) data derived from remote sensing were used to construct historic land cover change patterns. We found that over the period of record, annual streamflow (Q) and runoff ⁄precipitation ratio did not change significantly, nor did the climatic variables, including air temperature, Hamon’s potential evapotranspiration (<b>ET),</b> pan <b>evaporation,</b> sunshine hours, and radiation. However, annual ET estimated as the differences between P and Q showed a statistically significant increasing trend. Overall, the NDVI of the watershed had a significant increasing trend in the peak spring growing season. This study concluded that watershed ecosystem ET increased as the vegetation cove...|$|R

The root cause analysis indicates that there is intergranular corrosion due a differential concentration caused by seawater <b>evaporation</b> inside the <b>tubes</b> during the ship transit from the port of origin in China to the destination port in Brazil. The intergranular corrosion depth showed by root cause failure analysis is smaller than that showed by EC inspection. We attribute the EC inspection results deviation to a tube magnetisation due to mechanical stress and to a secondary phase due to an incomplete solubilisation after tube conforming and welding. Traditionally, these tubes are visually inspected and deemed acceptable but our conclusions reveal that eddy current testing is capable of detecting some corrosion anomalies which makes the tubes unfit for service...|$|R
40|$|Changes {{in total}} {{alkalinity}} and in pH during the evaporation of seawater {{in the laboratory}} were studied for an evaporation range extending between 1. 1 and 26 (as defined by the concentration ratio of Mg in the evaporated sample relative to mean ocean water).

Data from naturally formed marine brines fall within the experimental field.

A methodology for the design optimization of a MW solar DSG plant is {{presented in this article}} and applied to a real case study of a Brazilian tire manufacturing facility. A steady-state model, with spatial discretization of the ordinary equations, allows characterizing the physical phenomena such as pressure drop and heat transfer, and therefore to determine the pressure and specific enthalpy trend along the recirculation loop.
