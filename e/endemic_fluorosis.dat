40|$|Background Dental {{fluorosis}} is the hypomineralization {{of dental}} enamel caused by chronic ingestion of fluoride during the formative {{stages of the}} dental hard tissues. Fluoride in excess of 1. 5 mg/L in water is the principle cause of <b>endemic</b> dental <b>fluorosis.</b> Other causes of dental fluorosis are fluoride supplements (e. g. toothpaste) and food additives like traditional salt "trona". Dental fluorosis has social and psychological effects, whereby individuals affected even with the mild form demonstrate significant dissatisfaction over their appearance thus affecting their ability to interact and form relationships leading to exclusion, loneness, long term depression and other undesirable social behaviors. Aim The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the impact of dental fluorosis on quality of life using OrDP index, to determine the normative and subjective oral treatment need among individuals with dental fluorosis, the relationship between clinically defined dental fluorosis at different diagnostic cut-off points and self-rated appearance among adolescents. Methodology This cross-sectional study was conducted at Kibosho, a known area for <b>endemic</b> dental <b>fluorosis</b> in Kilimanjaro between August and September 2009. A sample of 269 secondary school students aged 15 - 18 years with dental fluorosis was involved. Data were collected using self administered questionnaire and clinical examination forms, orDP questions were used to assess the impact of dental fluorosis on quality of life. Clinical examinations were carried out by one calibrated dentists (Kappa = 0. 90) under natural light. Prior to examination the front teeth and first premolars of both maxilla and mandible were cleaned and dried with gauze. Dental fluorosis was diagnosed according to TF index. Data analysis was done using SPSS version 15 and statistical level of significance was p< 0. 05. Results Total of 269 students with dental fluorosis aged 15 - 18 years (mean age 17. 3) were involved in this study where 62. 5 % were female. Majority of the participants (65. 4 %) had severe dental fluorosis (TFI 6 - 9), while (29. 4 %) had TFY 4 - 5 and (5. 2 %) had dental fluorosis ofTFI 1 - 3. Most of the students (92. 6 %) perceived at least one oral impact on daily performance. The performances most affected were smiling 88. l%, emotional stability (81. 4 %), and having contact with others (75. 5 %). Brown discoloration of teeth was the most frequent perceived actual cause of oral impact on all eight performances. The treatment most frequently perceived was removal of brown discoloration 95. 2 % and 72. 0 % required esthetic veneer for treatment.

Skeletal fluorosis, a chronic metabolic bone and joint disease causing excessive ossification and joint ankylosis, has been only rarely considered in differential diagnoses of palaeopathological lesions. Even today its early stages are misdiagnosed in endemic areas. Methodology/ Principal Findings: <b>Endemic</b> <b>fluorosis</b> induced by high concentrations of fluoride in water and soils is a major health problem in several countries, particularly in volcanic areas. Here we describe {{for the first time}} the features of <b>endemic</b> <b>fluorosis</b> in the Herculaneum victims of the 79 AD eruption, resulting from long-term exposure to high levels of environmental fluoride which still occur today. Conclusions/ Significance: Our observations on morphological, radiological, histological and chemical skeletal and dental features of this ancient population now suggest that in this area fluorosis was already endemic in Roman times. This evidence merged with currently available epidemiologic data reveal for the Vesuvius area population a permanent fluoride health hazard, whose public health and socio-economic impact is currently underestimated.

40|$|<b>Endemic</b> <b>fluorosis</b> in {{northern}} China is usually produced by high fluorine (F) content in drinking water. Thirty-one samples of drinking waters, mainly well waters and nearly 200 samples of rocks, loess, and coal were analyzed for F content using the combustion hydrolysis-fluoride-ion selective electrode (ISE) method. The geologic cross sections of two well-known fluorosis basins were studied. The solubility of F in different rock types collected from fluorosis areas was determined. Results showed that areas of <b>endemic</b> <b>fluorosis</b> {{in northern}} China {{are located in}} coal-bearing basins which are comprised of three stratagraphic portions. The lowest portion is Precambrian granitic rocks or Cambrian-Ordovician carbonates. The middle portion consists of Permo-Carboniferous or Jurassic coal-bearing sequences. The upper portion is 0 - 400 m Pleistocene loess. Flourine content in the Precambrian granite-gneiss contained (a) 1090 - 1460 ppm, in the Cambrian-Ordovician limestone and dolomite, (b) 52 - 133 ppm, in black shales and coal gob of Permo-Carboniferous coal-bearing strata, (c) 200 - 700 ppm, and (d) Pleistocene loess 454 - 542 ppm. The solubility of F in black shales of coal-bearing sequences was higher than in Precambrian granitic rocks, and both were more soluble than loess. F solubility from Precambrian granitic rocks was moderate, but Precambrian granitic rocks have high F content and thus contribute an appreciable amount of ion to the shallow groundwater (well water). Varying F content in shallow groundwater is controlled by geological conditions. The sources of F in the shallow groundwater from fluorosis areas in northern China are mainly derived from black shales of coal-bearing sequences and Precambrian granitic basement in the basins of northern China. © 2008 Taylor & Francis...|$|E

40|$|Objective: Fluoride {{excess of}} 0. 05 – 0. 07 mg F/kg bw/day in water or food {{additives}} like salt {{is the principal}} cause of <b>endemic</b> dental <b>fluorosis.</b> How fluoride causes these defects is not clear yet. Recent studies in rodents suggest that development of enamel fluorosis is associated with insufficient neutralization of protons released during the formation of hypermineralized lines. Design: Here we examined whether hypermineralization could also be assessed by MicroCT in developing molar enamel of humans exposed to fluoride. Result Micro-CT analysis of hypomineralized enamel from human fluorotic molars graded by the Thylstrup–Fejerskov (TF) Index as III–IV showed weak hypermineralized lines and hypermineralized patches not seen in TF-I/II grade enamel.

The As content in coal-burning dried corn and capsicum contain more than 0. 7 mg/kg the natural standard amount of arsenic content allowed in food by China. The Se and Hg content in the coal-burning dried corn is lower than the natural standard of Se and Hg content in the food of China, but Se and Hg content of coal-burning dried capsicum is exceed the amount allowed by the natural standard in food of China. Clay was used as an additive for the coal-burning process and as a binder in making briquettes, contain a high content of As, generally more than 16 mg/kg. However, the Se and Hg content of clay itself are low. The As, Se and Hg content of drinking water are lower than the natural standard of As, Se and Hg content in the drinking water. So, there are high-As content coal and high-As content coal-burning dried corn and capsicum in the <b>endemic</b> <b>fluorosis</b> area of Zhaotong City of Yunnan Province. The high As content of the dried corn and capsicum might have originated from the high arsenic content of burnt coal and clay...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} {{relationship}} between exposure to different drinking water fluoride levels and children′s intelligence in Madhya Pradesh state, India. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted among 12 -year-old school children of Madhya Pradesh state, India. The children were selected from low (0. 05). However, {{a statistically significant difference}} was observed in the urinary fluoride levels (P 0. 000). Reduction in intelligence was observed with an increased water fluoride level (P 0. 000). The urinary fluoride level was a significant predictor for intelligence (P 0. 000). Conclusion: Children in <b>endemic</b> areas of <b>fluorosis</b> are at risk for impaired development of intelligence...|$|R
40|$|It is observational, {{analytical}} and cross-sectional aimed {{to evaluate the}} association between severity and prevalence of fluorosis and dental caries in rural communities with <b>endemic</b> dental <b>fluorosis</b> in the north state of Minas Gerais, Brazil, with fluoride concentrations in water up to 4. 8 mg/L. Data were collected by one examiner (intra-examiner kappa, 0. 96 to 0, 95 for caries and fluorosis) after toothbrushing. The study included 511 individuals aged 7 - 22 years, categorized according to age: 7 - 9 years (n = 227), 10 to 12 years (n = 153), 13 to 15 years (n = 92), 16 to 22 years (n = 39). For the diagnosis of dental caries used the criteria of the World Health Organization to measure indices DMFT. For fluorosis used the index Thylstrup and Fejerskov (TF), dichotomized according to prevalence (TF = 0 and TF > 0) and severity (TF 5). In the two younger groups, the DMFT and its decay component {{were higher in the}} group with more severe fluorosis (p 0. 05). The association was found between the conditions more severe fluorosis and caries in individuals under 12 years...|$|R
40|$|Fluorosis is a {{widespread}} disease related to ingestion of high levels of fluorine through water and food. Although sometimes of anthropogenic origin, high levels of fluorine are generally related to natural sources. One of the main sources is represented by volcanic activity, which releases magmatic fluorine generally as hydrogen fluorine through volcanic degassing. For example, Mt. Etna in Italy is considered the greatest point source at the global scale, releasing on average 70 Gg of HF each year. But the impact of fluorine on human health is highly dependent on its chemical state, which means that high rates of release not necessary point to high impacts. The major pathway of magmatic fluorine to humans {{is in the form}} of fluoride ion (F-), through consumption of contaminated vegetables and drinking water. Contamination can happen either through direct uptake of gaseous HF or through rainwaters and volcanic ashes. Furthermore hydrogen fluoride, being one of the most soluble gases in magmas, exsolves only partially (< 20 %) during volcanic activity. Volcanic rocks thus contain high levels of fluorine, which are transferred to groundwaters through water-rock interaction processes in the aquifers. Large magmatic provinces, like for example the East African Rift Valley, are therefore <b>endemic</b> for <b>fluorosis.</b> Finally a literature review of volcanic related fluorosis is given...|$|R
