Following its closure in 1983, a Trust was created to {{campaign}} for its restoration. The lift became a Scheduled Ancient Monument in 1994, and work eventually started on its refurbishment in 1999. It reopened in 2002, and is once more hydraulically powered.

This time, they conducted the test to know if <b>hydraulic</b> <b>fluids</b> of Flight 420 would ignite when it contacted the hot surface of the brake assembly.

The test also revealed that the contaminated <b>hydraulic</b> <b>fluids</b> have lower ignition point than the uncontaminated one.|$|E
