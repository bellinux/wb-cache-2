5|$|After {{his release}} in October 2004, he once again faced court for {{firearms}} charges and, later, {{for the murder}} of security guard Erwin Kastenberger during an armed robbery in Blackburn North, Victoria on 8 March 2005. He was found <b>guilty</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> murder of Erwin Kastenberger in the Supreme Court of Victoria on 12 June 2009, and he was subsequently jailed for life with a non-parole period of 30 years.

5|$|Allegations of {{research}} misconduct or improprieties have received substantial press coverage. Professor David Baltimore, a Nobel Laureate, became {{embroiled in a}} misconduct investigation starting in 1986 that led to Congressional hearings in 1991. Professor Ted Postol has accused the MIT administration since 2000 of attempting to whitewash potential research misconduct at the Lincoln Lab facility involving a ballistic missile defense test, though a final investigation into the matter has not been completed. Associate Professor Luk Van Parijs was dismissed in 2005 following allegations of scientific misconduct and found <b>guilty</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same by the United States Office of Research Integrity in 2009.|$|E
5|$|Bokhary's first {{brush with}} the police {{was in the early}} hours of 24 June 2001, when the manager of a bar in Central {{district}} of Hong Kong reported to police that she was causing a disturbance. When police officers arrived and attempted to arrest Bokhary, she hit one officer on the cheek; it took four officers at the scene to put her in handcuffs. Police also found a plastic bag with small amounts of cocaine on her person. She was found <b>guilty</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> assault and fined HK$9,000 (US$1,153). She was held not guilty of cocaine possession because of doubts over the evidence.|$|E
5|$|Chandler {{was found}} <b>guilty</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> murders, {{and was sentenced}} to death on November 4, 1994. He {{maintained}} his innocence, and continued to pursue legal appeals while on Florida's Death Row. He admitted to the Madeira Beach incident but said the sex was consensual, and that the victim changed her mind during the act. Since Chandler had already been sentenced to death for the Rogers family murders, and prosecutors did not want to subject Blair to the emotional trauma of a rape trial, he was never prosecuted for Blair's rape.|$|E

5|$|Coakley {{summed up}} his {{prosecution}} case on September 22. His {{aim was to}} show the court that a conspiracy had taken placethe mass of accounts from officers and men appeared to support the conclusion that ringleaders and agitators had forced a rebellion against authority. Veltmann pointed out that few of the accused had been ordered to load ammunition, meaning {{that they could not}} all be <b>guilty</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> charge of disobeying orders. Veltmann stressed that much of the testimony was hearsay and failed to establish a conspiracy or a mutiny. The court, however, seemed to side with Coakley on all points, settling each objection in favor of the prosecution.|$|E
5|$|In United States v. Price (1965), {{eighteen}} Ku Klux Klan {{members were}} charged with murder and conspiracy {{for the deaths of}} James Chaney, Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner, but the charges were dismissed by the trial court. A unanimous Supreme Court, which included Black, reversed the dismissal and ordered the case to proceed to trial. Seven of these men, including fellow Klansmen Samuel Bowers, Cecil Price and Alton Wayne Roberts were found <b>guilty</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crime; eight of them, including Lawrence A. Rainey, were found not guilty; and three of them, including Edgar Ray Killen, had their cases end in a mistrial.|$|E
5|$|In fiction, Druitt is {{depicted}} as the murderer in the musical Jack the Ripper by Ron Pember and Denis de Marne. In John Gardner's Sherlock Holmes story The Return of Moriarty, Professor Moriarty's criminal exploits are hampered by increased police activity {{as a result of}} the Jack the Ripper murders. He discovers that Druitt is the murderer and so fakes his suicide in the hope that the police will lose interest once the murders cease. In Alan Moore's graphic novel From Hell, Druitt is portrayed as a patsy for the royal family, made to look <b>guilty</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ripper murders in order to protect the real killer, Sir William Gull.|$|E
50|$|At <b>the</b> {{conclusion}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two-day trial, in February 1936 {{the jury}} found him <b>guilty</b> <b>of</b> murder. <b>The</b> judge sentenced him to death for <b>the</b> murder <b>of</b> Rushmer.|$|R
50|$|Deeb, who had {{continued}} to protest his innocence, was found <b>guilty</b> <b>of</b> instigating <b>the</b> murders, and on March 14, {{he was sentenced to}} death by lethal injection.|$|R
500|$|The High Court {{said that}} the trial judge {{did not seem to}} be aware that he had the {{authority}} to adjourn the trial. Another factor which complicated the case was that although the jury found Dietrich <b>guilty</b> <b>of</b> importing <b>the</b> heroin in the condoms, they found him not <b>guilty</b> <b>of</b> owning <b>the</b> heroin which had been hidden in a plastic bag. For the High Court, this uncertainty meant that it was possible that Dietrich could also have been acquitted <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other charges, if he had been legally represented: ...|$|R
5|$|Katherine Hewitt (a.k.a. Mould-Heeles) {{was charged}} and found <b>guilty</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> murder of Anne Foulds. She was {{the wife of}} a clothier from Colne, and had {{attended}} the meeting at Malkin Tower with Alice Grey. According to the evidence given by James Device, both Hewitt and Grey told the others at that meeting that they had killed a child from Colne, Anne Foulds. Jennet Device also picked Katherine out of a line-up, and confirmed her attendance at the Malkin Tower meeting.|$|E
5|$|On December 5, 1989, Judge Roth found Taylor <b>guilty</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first-degree {{child rape}} and first-degree murder of Charla Nicole King. During the penalty phase of Taylor's trial, his {{half-sister}} Leslie Beale traveled from Florida {{to testify about}} his harsh treatment under his stepfather and the three years that Taylor spent in a sex offender program at a Florida mental institution. On December 19, Taylor became the first convict in 40 years {{to be sent to}} death row by a Weber County court. Roth said that {{the facts of the case}} outweighed any mitigating circumstances. Taylor's father Albert attended most of his son's court proceedings until he died of heart failure on October 8, 1990. Taylor said he was not permitted to attend his father's funeral.|$|E
5|$|The killings were publicised in 1997, when {{a wartime}} member of Autumn Rains {{paramilitary}} {{spoke about the}} unit's involvement in killings of civilians in Gospić in an interview to the Feral Tribune. No formal investigation was launched until 2000, after three former Croatian intelligence and military police officers informed the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia about the killings. Five, including Orešković and Norac, were arrested in 2001 and tried. Orešković, Norac and Stjepan Grandić were found <b>guilty</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crime and sentenced to 14, 12 and 10 years in prison respectively in 2004.|$|E

5|$|To {{satisfy the}} {{prejudice}} prong of Strickland, a defendant who pleads guilty must {{show that there}} is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's deficient performance, he or she would not have plead guilty. In Padilla v. Kentucky (2010), the Court held that counsel's failure to inform an alien pleading <b>guilty</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> risk of deportation fell below the objective standard of the performance prong of Strickland and permitted an alien who would not have plead guilty but for such failure to withdraw his guilty plea.|$|E
5|$|Wrecking and {{smuggling}} supplemented local incomes. In 1743 John Roberts and Huw Bedward from Y Rhiw {{were found}} <b>guilty</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> murder of two shipwrecked sailors {{on the beach}} at Porth Neigwl on 6 January 1742, and hanged; Jonathan Morgan had been killed by a knife thrust into the nape of his neck, and Edward Halesham, described as a boy, had been choked to death. A ship claimed to be from France unloaded illicit tea and brandy at Aberdaron in 1767, and attempted to sell its cargo to the locals; a Revenue cutter discovered salt being smuggled at Porth Cadlan in 1809; and a schooner en route from Guernsey to Scotland was reported to have offloaded lace, tea, brandy and gin at Y Rhiw in 1824.|$|E
5|$|A third subplot centres on the {{relationship}} between Fenwick, Mr. Puddleham, the village's Methodist minister, and the Marquis of Trowbridge, Bullhampton's principal landowner. The marquis believes that Sam Brattle is <b>guilty</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> murder, and is angered by Fenwick's support for him. He spreads rumours about Fenwick's relations with Carry Brattle, and grants Puddleham permission to build a chapel on a piece of land neighbouring Fenwick's residence, where he hopes that the sight of it and the sound of its bell will annoy the vicar. Fenwick tries to reconcile himself to the existence of the chapel, but it subsequently comes to light that the land does not belong to the marquis, and is instead part of the parish's glebe. The embarrassed marquis pays to move the chapel to a new location, and through the intervention of his son, a suave Member of Parliament, he and Fenwick are reconciled.|$|E
