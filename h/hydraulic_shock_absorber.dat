2500|$|The rear {{suspension}} system was of the sliding pillar type, a block carrying the stub axle rode {{up and down on}} two guide pillars mounted on a solid casting bolted {{to the side of the}} body.

2500|$|The {{torsion bar}} {{suspension}} consists of six evenly spaced large rubber-tired road wheels with the drive sprocket {{at the rear}} and the idler at the front. The road wheels are hollow to minimize weight. These hollow road wheels increase the tank's buoyancy by 30%. There are no track-return rollers. The first and last road wheels have a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>shock</b> <b>absorber</b> and the steel tracks have 96 links each when new, each link has a single pin. There is a small, thin, horizontal skirt over each track. Its straight 6-cylinder, 4-stroke water-cooled diesel engine was developed under the designation [...] "V-6" [...] by halving the [...] "V-12"-engine from the T-54/55. It develops 240hp (179kW) at 1,800rpm which gives it a road speed of 44km/h {{and a range of}} 370km to 400km. The vehicle can cross 1.1 m high vertical obstacles and 2.8 m wide trenches and climb 52° gradients. The engine has a cooling system and an initial heater (intended for use when the air temperature is -20°C or colder). The PT-76 has a 5-speed manual shaft-type transmission system similar to the one in the T-34/85. The gearbox has four forward gears and one reverse. The vehicle has a side clutch that enables it to make turns and a handbrake. The tank has four mounts for additional external fuel tanks {{at the rear of the}} hull. The two on the corners are for flat type external tanks and the two in the center are for a drum type. These additional tanks increase the range from 370km – 400km to 480km – 510km. The PT-76 is a reliable, simple to operate and highly mobile reconnaissance vehicle and is ideally designed for amphibious operations, but it has many limitations as a fighting vehicle.|$|E

50|$|The {{rear-wheel drive}} Type 175, 178 and 180 chassis is {{considerably}} {{more sophisticated than}} its 135 predecessor, the front suspension being independent with pivoting horizontal cylinders that contained a powerful coil-spring and <b>hydraulic</b> <b>shock</b> <b>absorber</b> in an oil-bath Dubonnet. The rear was by de Dion, with semi-elliptical springs. Brakes were hydraulic type made by Lockheed. The brake-drums were deeply finned cast-iron, actuated by dual master cylinders with a balance-bar drums all around.|$|E
50|$|The {{torsion bar}} {{suspension}} consists of six evenly spaced large rubber-tired road wheels with the drive sprocket {{at the rear}} and the idler at the front. The road wheels are hollow to ensure additional amphibious abilities. Usage of hollow road wheels increased APC's buoyancy by 30%. There are no track-return rollers. The first and last road wheels have a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>shock</b> <b>absorber</b> and the steel tracks with a single pin have 96 chain links each when new. There is a small, thin, horizontal skirt over each track. OT-62 has the PV-6 6-cylinder, inline diesel engine developing 300 hp (224 kW) at 1,800 rpm. The engine gives it a road speed of 60 km/h with a cruising range of 450 km - 550 km. The vehicle can cross 0.9 m high vertical obstacles and 2.8 m wide trenches and climb 38° gradients.|$|E
50|$|The T-62 uses {{torsion bar}} suspension. It has five pairs of rubber-tired roadwheels, a drive {{sprocket}} {{at the rear}} and idler at the front on each side, with no return rollers. The first and last road wheels each have a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>shock</b> <b>absorber.</b> The tank is powered by the V-55 12-cylinder 4-stroke one-chamber 38.88 litre water-cooled diesel engine developing 581 hp (433 kW) at 2,000 rpm. This is the same engine as the one used in the T-55. Because the T-62 weighs more than the T-55, it is less maneuverable. Like the T-55, the T-62 has three external diesel fuel tanks on the right fender and a single auxiliary oil tank on the left fender. The tank carries 960 litres of fuel in its internal and external fuel tanks. Two optional 200-litre drum-type fuel tanks can be fitted on {{the rear of the}} vehicle for an increased operational range.|$|E
50|$|Pneumatic and <b>hydraulic</b> <b>shock</b> <b>absorbers</b> {{are used}} in {{conjunction}} with cushions and springs. An automobile <b>shock</b> <b>absorber</b> contains spring-loaded check valves and orifices to control the flow of oil through an internal piston (see below).|$|R
50|$|Half-elliptical zinc {{interleaved}} springs were {{fitted with}} self-lubricating discs {{and controlled by}} <b>hydraulic</b> <b>shock</b> <b>absorbers.</b> In front the springs were shackled forward and were flat, the back springs underhung.|$|R
50|$|On one car was tested, {{this is a}} novelty, the {{solution}} to independent multilink rear wheels with anti-bar and telescopic <b>hydraulic</b> <b>shock</b> <b>absorbers</b> and springs elicoidal cylindrical cosaxial inclined.|$|R
50|$|Of similar {{construction}} to a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>shock</b> <b>absorber</b> the strut used {{the motion of}} the suspension travelling over bumps to pump itself back up to a pre-set height. It was sufficiently powerful to regain up to 85% of normal ride height with a full load over the rear axle, and had the advantage of requiring no external power source or a dedicated hydraulic system in the vehicle. The same system was applied to the Land Rover in the 1980s when these vehicles adopted the Range Rover's coil spring suspension. In the 1990s Land Rover, in pursuit of the same blend of on- and off-road ability, developed an air suspension system that was both self-levelling and height adjustable. Originally this was in conjunction with live axles but it is now used with fully independent suspension using wishbones. The original coil-springs-with-hydraulic-strut system is still used on certain models of the current Land Rover Defender.|$|E
5000|$|The {{high power}} {{meant that the}} gearbox and clutch did not cope well. and it was {{developed}} into the ‘Series B’ which had internal oil pipes and the gearbox integrated with the engine casting (Unit Construction). The angle between the cylinders was increased to 50° instead of the 47.5° of the Series A engine, which allowed {{the use of the}} engine as part of the frame. The Rapide had ‘’Girdraulic’’ front forks and triangulated rear springing to prevent front end twist under hard braking. and the cantilever rear became the most widely used form of rear suspension for motorcycles after 1980. Brakes were dual 7 in single-leading shoe (SLS), front and rear. A more modern <b>hydraulic</b> <b>shock</b> <b>absorber</b> and spring assembly later replaced the old twin springs and friction damper. The rear seat was supported by a sub-frame down to the rear frame pivot point, providing a semi-sprung seat with 6 in of suspension.|$|E
50|$|The {{torsion bar}} {{suspension}} consists of six evenly spaced large rubber-tired road wheels with a drive sprocket {{at the rear}} and an idler at the front. The road wheels are hollow to assist its amphibious capabilities. These wheels increase the APC's buoyancy by 30%. There are no track-return rollers. The first and last road wheels have a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>shock</b> <b>absorber,</b> the steel tracks have a single pin and 96 links each when new. There is a small, thin, horizontal skirt over each track. The BTR-50 {{is powered by a}} V-6 6-cylinder 4-stroke in line water-cooled diesel engine developing 240 hp (179 kW) at 1800 rpm. This gives it a road speed of 44 km/h with a cruising range of 400 km. The vehicle can negoiate 30° side slopes, ascend 60° gradients, cross 1.1 m high vertical obstacles and 2.8 m wide trenches. The engine has a cooling system and a pre-heater (intended for ignition when the air temperature is −20 °C or below). The APC has a five gear manual shaft-type transmission system similar to that in the T-34/85 medium tank. The gearbox has four forward and one reverse gear. The vehicle has a side clutch that enables it to make turns, mechanical transmission and a bandbrake. The vehicle has three fuel tanks, two on the right {{at the front of the}} engine compartment and one at the rear. The total fuel capacity is 400 liters. The vehicle has four mounts for additional external fuel tanks located on the rear of the hull; the two on the hull corners are for a flat external tanks, whereas the two in the center are for a drum-type of tank.|$|E
