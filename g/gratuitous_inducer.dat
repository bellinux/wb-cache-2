40|$|Induction of {{penicillinase}} (β-lactamase) in Bacillus licheniformis 749 by 2 -(2 ′-carboxyphenyl) -benzoyl- 6 -aminopenicillanic acid (CBAP) was examined, {{since this}} compound {{was reported to}} be a <b>gratuitous</b> <b>inducer</b> of penicillinase in Staphylococcus aureus. The specific activity of enzyme optimally induced by CBAP is slightly more than that formed in response to cephalosporin C and threefold the level induced by benzylpenicillin. The optimal inducer concentration of CBAP was not inhibitory toward the growth of penicillinase-deficient mutants, unlike benzylpenicillin or cephalosporin C which showed marked toxicities. CBAP is hydrolyzed by the Bacillus penicillinase, but as indicated by its “physiological efficiency” (Vmax/Km), CBAP is a poor substrate at low concentrations. At very high concentrations, CBAP inhibited benzylpenicillin hydrolysis. The overall effectiveness of CBAP as an inducer can be attributed to its low “physiological efficiency” which enables the use of nontoxic levels of CBAP for induction without its rapid hydrolysis. Although CBAP is not a true <b>gratuitous</b> <b>inducer,</b> operationally it approaches gratuity for induction of B. licheniformis penicillinase better than other known inducers...|$|E

40|$|In the {{presence}} of <b>gratuitous</b> <b>inducers,</b> the lac operon of Escherichia coli exhibits bistability. Most models in the literature assume that the inducer enters the cell via the carrier (permease), and exits by a diffusion-like process. The diffusive influx and carrier efflux are neglected. However, {{analysis of the data}} shows that in non-induced cells, the diffusive influx is comparable to the carrier influx, and in induced cells, the carrier efflux is 7 times the diffusive efflux. Since bistability entails the coexistence of steady states corresponding to both non-induced and induced cells, neither one of these fluxes can be ignored. Here, we formulate a model accounting for both fluxes. We show that: (a) The thresholds of bistability are profoundly affected by both fluxes. The diffusive influx reduces the on threshold by enhancing inducer accumulation in non-induced cells. The carrier efflux increases the off threshold by decreasing inducer accumulation in induced cells. (b) Simulations of the model with experimentally measured parameter values are in good agreement with the data for IPTG. However, there are discrepancies with respect to the data for TMG. They are most likely due to two features missing from the model, namely, the variation of the inducer exclusion effect and the specific growth rate with the lactose enzyme levels. (c) The steady states and thresholds obtained in {{the presence}} of both fluxes are well approximated by simple analytical expressions, which may be useful for the preliminary design of the lac genetic switch in synthetic biology.

Glucose, in concentrations from 10 − 5 to 10 − 2 m, had no effect on the differential rate of enzyme synthesis. Cultures growing on maltotriose, maltotetraose, maltopentaose, and maltohexaose exhibited the same growth rate (k) and differential rate of α-amylase synthesis over a concentration range of 2. 92 × 10 − 4 to 1. 46 × 10 − 2 m. Growth of cultures in various concentrations of pure maltose revealed that with concentrations of maltose ranging from 2. 92 × 10 − 3 to 1. 46 × 10 − 2 m the K value for α-amylase production increased 18 -fold. The amount of maltose utilized, during the growth period, at each concentration of maltose, was constant.

A strain with plasmid RP 1 (which does not confer resistance to Hg 2 +) similarly did not volatilize mercury. All 10 plasmids determine mercury resistance by way of an inducible enzyme system. Hg 2 + was reduced to Hg 0, which is insoluble in water and rapidly volatilizes from the growth medium. Plasmids pMG 1, pMG 2, R 26, R 933, R 93 - 1, and pVS 1 in P. aeruginosa and MER in P. putida conferred resistance to and the ability to volatilize mercury from Hg 2 +, but strains with these plasmids were sensitive to and could not volatilize mercury from the organomercurials methylmercury, ethylmercury, phenylmercury, and thimerosal. These plasmids, in addition, conferred resistance to the organomercurials merbromin, p-hydroxymercuribenzoate, and fluorescein mercuric acetate. The other plasmids, FP 2, R 38, R 3108, and pVS 2, determined resistance to and decomposition of a range of organomercurials, including methylmercury, ethylmercury, phenylmercury, and thimerosal. These plasmids also conferred resistance to the organomercurials merbromin, p-hydroxymercuribenzoate, and fluorescein mercuric acetate by a mechanism not involving degradation. In all cases, organomercurial decomposition and mercury volatilization were induced by exposure to Hg 2 + or organomercurials. The plasmids differed in the relative efficacy of inducers. Hg 2 + resistance with strains that are organomercurial sensitive appeared to be induced preferentially by Hg 2 + and only poorly by organomercurials to which the cells are sensitive.

Studies using 2, 3, 5 -triphenyl tetrazolium chloride plates to examine amino acid catabolism suggest that accumulation of ipa or iopa leads to inactivation of aspartate amino-transferase (AAT). This interpretation is supported by studies of an Escherichia coli mutant lacking AAT. The mutant grows poorly on succinate minimal medium, and the poor growth is relieved by the same amino acids that relieve ipa- and iopa-restricted growth.

Induction tests with various compounds indicate that inducer recognition has specificity for chain length and can be affected by the degree of oxidation of the carbon chain. Some inducers are neither growth nor respiration substrates. Growth tests with and without a <b>gratuitous</b> <b>inducer</b> indicate that undecane is not a growth substrate because it does not induce alkane hydroxylase activity. Using a growth test for determining induction of the plasmid alcohol dehydrogenase it is possible to show that heptane induces this activity in hydroxylase-negative mutants. This suggests that unoxidized alkane molecules are the physiological inducers of both plasmid activities...|$|E
40|$|The URA 3 gene from Saccharomyces cerevisiae is {{localized}} on a 1. 1 -kilobase (kb) DNA fragment. By {{using this}} fragment as a hybridization probe, {{we found that}} oxalurate, a <b>gratuitous</b> <b>inducer</b> of the allantoin degradative system, also serves to induce URA 3 specific RNA. This response is restricted to oxalurate; other conditions which bring about high-level synthesis of the allantoin degradative enzymes did not produce the effect. Two classes of RNA (1. 0 and 1. 5 kb) {{were found to be}} oxalurate induced. Both classes are encoded by the URA 3 gene, overlap, and probably do not significantly differ at their 5 ' termini. Northern blot mapping of the transcripts indicated that the 1. 5 -kb transcript was likely encoded by sequences extending up to 0. 5 kb downstream from the 3 ' terminus of the 1. 0 -kb transcript. Analysis of the endpoints of the major 1. 0 -kb URA 3 transcript by S 1 nuclease mapping revealed the existence of two 5 ' termini, separated by 5 to 10 nucleotides, and seven 3 ' termini, separated by 5 to 20 nucleotides each, over a range of about 70 bases...|$|E
40|$|The alk {{genes of}} Pseudomonas oleovorans, which {{is able to}} metabolize alkanes and alkenes, are {{organized}} in alkST and alkBFGHJKL clusters, in which the expression of alkBFGHJKL is positively regulated by AILS, Growth of the wild-type strain GPo 1 and P. oleovorans GPo 12 alk recombinants on octane resulted in changes of cellular physiology and morphology. These changes, which included lower growth rates and a reduction {{of the number of}} CFU due to filamentation, were also seen when the cells were grown on aqueous medium, and the alk genes were induced with dicycloproplketone, a <b>gratuitous</b> <b>inducer</b> of the alk genes, These effects were seen only for recombinants carrying both alkST and alkBFGHJKL operons, Deletion of parts of either alkB or alkJ, which encode two major Alk proteins located in the cytoplasmic membrane, modified but did not eliminate the effects described above, suggesting that they were due to induction and expression of several alk genes, Continuous growth of the cells in the presence of dicyclopropylketone for about 10 generations led to inactivation, but not elimination, of the alk genes, This resulted in a return of the recombinants to normal physiology and growth...|$|E
