5|$|Ship {{services}} in Nordhordland started in 1866, and in 1923 {{the first car}} was purchased. A car ferry service between Isdalstø in Lindås and Steinestø in Åsane on the mainland was established on 7 July 1936. A plan was launched whereby all traffic from Nordhordland would be collected <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>place</b> <b>and</b> transported across Salhusfjorden to Åsane. By moving the ferry quay from Isdalstø to Knarvik, {{the length of the}} ferry service could be reduced. However, the fares would be kept the same and the extra revenue used to finance a bridge from Flatøy to Lindås. This allowed the Alversund Bridge to open in 1958, and the ferry service from Flatøy and Meland to move to Knarvik. The proposal to cross Salhusfjorden was launched during the planning of the Alversund Bridge. Cost estimates were made based on the Golden Gate Bridge in the United States, but it proved too expensive for a suspension bridge crossing between Frekhaug and Salhus.|$|E

25|$|After the {{withdrawal}} of the Lombards in the migration period, from about 700 AD Lüneburg Heath belonged to the Duchy of Saxony, which was conquered by Charlemagne in the 9th century and became part of the Frankish Empire. The resulting close control of the population and the Christianization meant that the rural settlements had to stay <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>place</b> <b>and</b> could no longer move about freely. The land had to be farmed more intensively which led to the heathland spreading.|$|E

25|$|The Army and the Navy are {{regionally}} organized, with central, national {{headquarters in}} Mexico City and subordinate, regional headquarters. Historically, this {{has proven to}} be effective, as the military's main deployments have been domestic. Troops are stationed throughout the country to serve as a continuing presence of authority and to allow for an immediate critical response. Dispersion by regional military zones has facilitated local recruitment of non-commissioned officers (Army sergeants, Navy petty officers) and enlisted men and women, allowing them to be stationed near family during their military service, an important cultural consideration. On the other hand, mobility is expected of commissioned officers, moving from assignment to assignment and to the military center, in Mexico City, giving them much experience, and, historically, preventing any senior officer from remaining too long <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>place</b> <b>and</b> developing a personal power base through local allegiances, and so becoming too powerful as a warlord.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that Eleanor and Edward were more devoted to each other than to their children. As king and queen, however, it was impossible for them to spend much time <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>place,</b> <b>and</b> when the children were very young, they could not tolerate the rigors of constant travel with their parents. The children had a household staffed with attendants carefully chosen for competence and loyalty, with whom the parents corresponded regularly. The children lived in this comfortable establishment until they were about seven years old; then they began to accompany their parents, if at first only on important occasions. By their teens they were with the king and queen much of the time. In 1290, Eleanor sent one of her scribes to join her children's household, presumably to help with their education. She also sent gifts to the children regularly, and arranged for the entire establishment to be moved near to her when she was in Wales. In 1306 Edward sharply scolded Margerie de Haustede, Eleanor's former lady in waiting who was then in charge of his children by his second wife, because Margerie had not kept him well informed of their health. Edward also issued regular and detailed instructions for the care and guidance of these children.|$|E

500|$|These {{animals are}} mainly nocturnal, {{particularly}} in summers. In the day, they {{dig into the}} sand in shady locations and rest in these depressions, which also protect them from sandstorms. Addax herds contain both males and females, and have from five to 20 members. They will generally stay <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>place</b> <b>and</b> only wander widely in search of food. The addax have a strong social structure, probably based on age, and herds are led by the oldest female. [...] Herds {{are more likely to}} be found along the northern edge of the tropical rain system during the summer and move north as winter falls. [...] They are able to track rainfall and will head for these areas where vegetation is more plentiful. Males are territorial, and guard females, while the females establish their own dominance hierarchies.|$|E
500|$|Kimberella {{probably}} grazed on microbial mats, but {{a selective}} predatory habit cannot be ruled out. Fedonkin reckons {{that as it}} ate, it moved [...] "backwards"; the trail thus created was destroyed by the subsequent grazing activity. [...] Conversely, Gehling et al. claim that it moved 'forwards'. [...] Fans of grooves are often found radiating from the [...] "head" [...] end of the organism; these indicate that the organism stayed <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>place,</b> <b>and</b> raked {{the surface of the}} microbial mat towards it by extension of its head, which bore two [...] "teeth". Gehling et al. reconstruct Kimberella as having a long neck that operated like the arm of a digger, rotating about an axis perpendicular to the sea floor in order to produce the sweep of the fan, and rotating towards and away from the animal to scrape food from the substrate to the mouth.|$|E
500|$|The {{scientific}} {{subjects of}} Wright's paintings {{from this time}} were meant {{to appeal to the}} wealthy scientific circles in which he moved. While never a member himself, he had strong connections with the Lunar Society: he was friends with members John Whitehurst and Erasmus Darwin, as well as Josiah Wedgwood, who later commissioned paintings from him. The inclusion of the moon in the painting was a nod to their monthly meetings, which were held when the moon was full. Like The Orrery, Wright apparently painted Air Pump without a commission, and the picture was purchased by Dr Benjamin Bates, who already owned Wright's Gladiator. An Aylesbury physician, patron of the arts and hedonist, Bates was a diehard member of the Hellfire Club who, despite his excesses, lived to be over 90. Wright's account book shows a number of prices for the painting: Pd£200 is shown <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>place</b> <b>and</b> £210 in another, but Wright had written to Bates asking for £130, stating that the low price [...] "might much injure me in the future sale of my pictures, and when I send you a receipt for the money I shall acknowledge a greater sum." [...] Whether Bates ever paid the full amount is not recorded; Wright only notes in his account book that he received £30 in part payment.|$|E
