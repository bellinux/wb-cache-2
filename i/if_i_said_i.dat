We always want cremations {{to go off}} {{smoothly}} for the dear relatives. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> knew I was getting money under the Will they might get suspicious and I like cremations and burials to go smoothly. There was nothing suspicious really. It was not deceitful.|$|E
500|$|As the Nixon {{presidency}} slowly collapsed, Voorhis {{spoke out}} more frequently. In 1972, he said, [...] "Sour grapes {{to criticize the}} man who beat me, but I just wouldn't be human <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> liked spending {{the second half of}} my life as 'the man who Nixon beat'". After Nixon resigned as President, Voorhis, noted, [...] "Here is the philosophy of doing-anything-to-win receiving its just and proper reward." [...] Voorhis, believing he had been labeled a subversive by Nixon, [...] "took some satisfaction" [...] in stating that Nixon himself had been the subversive, seeking, according to Voorhis, to impose [...] "a virtual dictatorship" [...] on the country.|$|E
500|$|On Selection Sunday, Temple Owls {{received}} a seven seed and {{was due to}} face Penn State in the 2011 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament on March 17 at the McKale Center in Tucson, Arizona. The two teams had played {{each other in a}} scrimmage in the preseason. They had also met in the 2001 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament when the Owls earned an 84–72 victory in the Sweet Sixteen. Coming into the game, Fran Dunphy had a NCAA tournament record 11-game losing streak, at Penn and Temple Owls. [...] "I probably think about it less than others do," [...] said Dunphy, [...] "but you think about it. I would be lying <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> didn't. But I'm so thrilled for these kids and so thrilled to be in the tournament. We've had a nice run – this particular group, four straight years of going to the NCAA tournament is pretty special." ...|$|E

2500|$|Tutu {{came out}} in support of {{assisted}} dying on July 2014, stating that life shouldn't be preserved [...] "at any cost". He also said that laws that deny the right to assisted dying deprive those who are dying of their [...] "human right to dignity". He gave the example of Nelson Mandela, whose long and painful illness was in his opinion [...] "an affront to Madiba's dignity". Tutu stated that {{in a similar situation}} he would not want to have his own life [...] "prolonged artificially", saying [...] "I {{think a lot of people}} would be upset <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> wanted assisted dying. I would say I wouldn't mind actually." ...|$|E
2500|$|Speaking in January 2010 to noted UK soul writer Pete Lewis of {{the award-winning}} Blues & Soul, Fakir {{confirmed}} {{plans for the}} [...] "new" [...] Four Tops to release a new album, while revealing his personal feelings about the current line-up: [...] "To me the new group is like {{an extension of the}} family, because we've all been very close for so many years... Which makes it easier for ME, because I truly miss Lawrence, [...] "Obie" [...] AND Levi - I'd be lying <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> didn't - and not one of them could EVER be replaced. But, you know, these new guys do perform well enough for the people to still enjoy the shows and still enjoy the music. So for me, it kinda makes it bittersweet. Because, {{at the end of the}} day, the legacy is still going on and I'm very pleased that it IS!" ...|$|E
60|$|A fatal question. I {{recognized}} that I was defeated. If I answered no, he {{would cut the}} matter short and wave me to the door without the grace of a word--I saw it in his uncompromising eye; <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> was a lecturer, he would despise me, and dismiss me with opprobrious words; <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> was a dramatist, he would throw {{me out of the}} window. I saw that my case was hopeless, so I chose the course which seemed least humiliating: I would pocket my shame and glide out without answering. The silence was growing lengthy.|$|E

6000|$|... "No, not mild. I can't bear it. I {{shall be}} good for nothing. I shouldn't mind {{anything}}, if it were settled between us. I could do anything then," [...] said Rex, impetuously. [...] "But it's of no use to pretend that I will obey you. I can't do it. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> would, I should be sure to break my word. I should see Gwendolen again." ...|$|E
60|$|I suppose I bowed. Habit carries us {{mechanically}} {{through many}} impossible situations.

6000|$|... "Then I can't {{say that}} I forgive her. How {{is a man}} to forgive such treatment? <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> that <b>I</b> did, you wouldn't believe me. I will keep out of her way, {{and that will be}} better for her than {{forgiving}} her." ...|$|R

[...] There was a kind of logic in this that silenced Mrs. Kenton for the moment. In view of her {{advantage}} Lottie relented so far as to add, [...] "I've found out something about him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{not very}} convincing--but what could you say? And you are, after all, not very wise," [...] she said. [...] "I wonder if I might tell you that I knew part of this long ago; but the rest I did not know until the evening the team bolted in the hollow.

6000|$|... 'Because I am {{conceited}} in all {{the ways}} which Rupert has mentioned,' said Anne; 'I believe myself witty, and wise, and amiable, and useful, and agreeable, and I do not like taking advice, and I am very angry when my friends are abused, and I do believe I think I have the most exquisite brother in the world; and besides, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> was not conceited {{it would be the}} best possible proof of the contrary.--But, Mamma, there is a person whom we have not mentioned, who has no conceit and plenty of self-control.' ...|$|E
60|$|Still gazing on the floor, {{with her}} hands folded before her, she asked me what I wished. At first I could not answer her.

6000|$|... 'Yes, I am a good shot, but I don't {{pretend to}} be as quick with it as these {{professional}} bullies.

60|$|Your generous sympathy, my dear Mrs. Kinney, {{would have}} made me glad yesterday, if I {{had not been so}} very, very sad with some news of the day before, telling me of the loss of the loved friend to whom that book is dedicated. So sad I was that I could not lift up my head to write and express to you how gratefully I felt the {{recognition}} of your letter. You are most generous--overflowingly generous. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> wished to deserve it better, it would be like wishing you less generous; so I won't. I will only thank you from my heart; that shall be all I shall say.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm glad I've {{told you}} this, Anne," [...] she whispered. [...] "It {{has helped me}} just to say it all out. I've wanted to all summer--every time you came. I wanted to talk it over with you--but I COULDN'T. It seemed {{as if it would}} make death so SURE <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>SAID</b> <b>I</b> was going to die, or if any one else said it or hinted it. I wouldn't say it, or even think it. In the daytime, when people were around me and {{everything}} was cheerful, it wasn't so hard to keep from thinking of it. But in the night, when I couldn't sleep--it was so dreadful, Anne. I couldn't get away from it then. Death just came and stared me in the face, until I got so frightened I could have screamed.|$|E
5000|$|On 17 November, Blair {{was granted}} a release from his {{contract}} from the Wests Tigers and {{on the next day}} on 18 November it was announced that he had signed with the Brisbane Broncos on a three-year deal, starting in 2015.

6000|$|... "I don't {{like you}} when you talk like that, Uncle Harry--that is, I shouldn't like you <b>if</b> <b>I</b> thought you meant it; but you only talk so out of contradiction. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> had <b>said</b> <b>I</b> thought Frank was very foolish for having gone into the water, you would have taken the {{opposite}} side directly." ...|$|R
6000|$|Now I {{knew that}} I {{was in a}} tight place, for on this matter of loyalty, Zulu, and indeed all native ideas, are very primitive. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> that <b>I</b> had sympathy with the Boers, Dingaan would set me down as a traitor. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> that <b>I</b> hated the Boers, then still I should be a traitor because I {{associated}} with them, and a traitor in his eyes would be one to be killed. I {{do not like to}} talk religion, and anyone who has read what I have written in various works will admit that I have done so rarely, if ever. Yet at that moment I put up a prayer for guidance, feeling that my young life hung upon the answer, and it came to me--whence I do not know. The essence of that guidance was that I should tell the simple truth to this fat savage. So <b>I</b> <b>said</b> to him: ...|$|R
60|$|I don't think I did blush--at all events, {{it was not}} {{important}} <b>if</b> <b>I</b> did--and <b>I</b> <b>said</b> my present fortune perfectly contented me and I {{had no wish to}} change it.|$|R
5000|$|... "Yes, I am, {{which seems}} to offend the {{religious}} right far worse than <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> thought there was no God. Every time I've been asked if I believe in God, I've said yes, because I do, {{but no one ever}} really has gone any more deeply into it than that, and I have to say that does suit me, because if I talk too freely about that I think the intelligent reader, whether 10 or 60, will be able to guess what's coming in the books." ...|$|E
5000|$|David Browne {{described}} this: [...] "In Role Model, he gleefully debunks {{the idea}} of rappers as heroes (So <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> never do drugs, that would mean I lie and get f ---ed more than the President does)." [...] RapReviews highlighted following lyrics: [...] "I get a clean shave, bathe, go to a rave/ Die from an overdose and dig myself up out of my grave/ My middle finger won't go down, how do I wave?/ And this is how I'm supposed to teach kids how to behave?" ...|$|E
5000|$|In person, {{most people}} have been very kind to me, A few people havent, usually when theyre under the {{influence}} of some stimulants or depressants. Its not nice. I dont like it.

2500|$|The initial title, Ruddygore, was changed: {{because of}} claims that [...] "ruddy" [...] was too {{similar to the}} then-taboo curse word [...] "bloody", it was shortly changed to Ruddigore.
