50|$|The acid hydride of tellurium, <b>hydrogen</b> <b>telluride,</b> H2Te, is an {{unstable}} compound that decomposes to tellurium metal. It is strongly acidic, dissociating into a <b>hydrogen</b> <b>telluride</b> ion (HTe−) in aqueous solutions.

50|$|<b>Hydrogen</b> <b>telluride</b> {{cannot be}} {{efficiently}} prepared from its constituent elements, {{in contrast to}} H2Se.|$|E
50|$|It {{should have}} {{properties}} {{similar to that}} of hydrogen selenide and <b>hydrogen</b> <b>telluride,</b> other borderline hydrides. It is very unstable at room temperature and must be stored at freezer temperatures to prevent reversion to elemental polonium and hydrogen; this is because it is an endothermic compound, like the lighter <b>hydrogen</b> <b>telluride</b> and hydrogen selenide, and decomposes into its constituent elements, releasing heat in the process. The amount of heat given off in the decomposition of polonium hydride is over 100 kJ/mol, the largest of all the hydrogen chalcogenides.|$|E
50|$|Tellurous acid (H2TeO3), {{containing}} tellurium in its +4 oxidation state, {{is known}} but not well characterised. <b>Hydrogen</b> <b>telluride</b> is an unstable gas that forms hydrotelluric acid upon addition to water.|$|E

5000|$|Water (H2O), a {{well known}} oxide of hydrogen, is a {{spectacular}} anomaly. Extrapolating from the heavier hydrogen chalcogenides, namely hydrogen sulfide H2S, hydrogen selenide H2Se, and <b>hydrogen</b> <b>telluride</b> H2Te, water should be [...] "a foul-smelling, poisonous, inflammable gas…condensing to a nasty liquid at around -100° C". Instead, due to hydrogen bonding, water is [...] "stable, potable, odorless, benign, and…indispensable to life".|$|E
50|$|However, {{because they}} formed {{volatile}} hydrides on the primitive Earth when the controlling redox reaction was the oxidation or reduction of hydrogen, the less metallic chalcophile elements are strongly depleted on Earth {{as a whole}} relative to cosmic abundances. This is most especially true of the chalcogens selenium and tellurium (which formed volatile hydrogen selenide and <b>hydrogen</b> <b>telluride,</b> respectively), which for this reason are among the rarest elements found in the Earth's crust (to illustrate, tellurium is only about as abundant as platinum).|$|E
50|$|The acidity of tellurols can be {{inferred}} by the acidity and dissociation constant of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>telluride,</b> H2Te, which has a (first) pKa of 2.64 corresponding to a dissociation constant of 2.3 × 10−3.5. H2Te has a lower pKa and higher dissociation constant than H2S and H2Se. The absence of hydrogen-bonding explains the low boiling temperature of tellurols. The Te-H bond in tellurols is weak. Tellurols are easily oxidized and decompose thermally. Ultraviolet light also induces decomposition. Methanetellurol decomposes to dimethyl ditelluride and hydrogen.|$|E
50|$|Water can {{dissolve}} the other hydrogen chalcogenides (at least those up to <b>hydrogen</b> <b>telluride),</b> forming acidic solutions known as hydrochalcogenic acids. Although these are weaker acids than the hydrohalic acids, they follow a similar trend of acid strength increasing with heavier chalcogens, and also form {{in a similar}} way (turning the water into a hydronium ion H3O+ and the solute into a XH− ion). It is unknown if polonium hydride forms an acidic solution in water like its lighter homologues, or if it behaves more like a metal hydride (see also hydrogen astatide).|$|E
50|$|Sodium {{telluride}} is {{the chemical}} compound with the formula Na2Te. This salt is the conjugate {{base of the}} thermally unstable acid <b>hydrogen</b> <b>telluride,</b> but it is usually prepared by reduction of tellurium with sodium. Na2Te is a challenging material to handle because it is very sensitive to air. Air oxidizes it initially to polytellurides, which have the formula Na2Tex (x > 1), and ultimately Te metal. Samples of Na2Te, which are colourless when absolutely pure, generally appear purple or dark gray due {{to the effects of}} air oxidation.|$|E
50|$|Borderline {{hydrides}} exhibit bonding characteristics between ionic and {{covalent bond}} types. A specific {{examples of a}} borderline hydride CuH, copper hydride, that appears as a spongy reddish-brown substance is a moderate reducing agent. It will catalytically oxidize hypophosphorous acid to phosphorous acid at room temperature, and it gives off hydrogen gas when subjected to heat.ZnH2 is also a solid at room temperature that breaks down at 90 °C, but even left alone decomposes over several days to zinc metal and hydrogen gas. <b>Hydrogen</b> <b>telluride</b> (H2Te) and hydrogen selenide (H2Se) are both borderline hydrides of high volatility that produce strong, unpleasant odors.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hydrogen</b> <b>telluride</b> (tellane) is the {{inorganic}} compound with the formula H2Te. A hydrogen chalcogenide and the simplest hydride of tellurium, it is a colorless gas. Although unstable in ambient air, the gas can exist {{at very low}} concentrations {{long enough to be}} readily detected by the odour of rotting garlic at extremely low concentrations; or by the revolting odour of rotting leeks at somewhat higher concentrations. Most compounds with Te-H bonds (tellurols) are unstable with respect to loss of H2. H2Te is chemically and structurally similar to hydrogen selenide, both are acidic. The H-Te-H angle is about 90°. Volatile tellurium compounds often have unpleasant odours, reminiscent of decayed leeks or garlic.|$|E
50|$|The other {{hydrogen}} chalcogenides {{are highly}} toxic, malodorous gases. Hydrogen sulfide occurs commonly {{in nature and}} its properties compared with water reveal a lack of any significant hydrogen bonding. Since they are both gases at STP, hydrogen can be simply burned {{in the presence of}} oxygen to form water in a highly exothermic reaction; such a test can be used in beginner chemistry to test for the gases produced by a reaction as hydrogen will burn with a pop. Water, hydrogen sulfide, and hydrogen selenide may be made by heating their constituent elements together above 350 °C, but <b>hydrogen</b> <b>telluride</b> and polonium hydride are not attainable by this method due to their thermal instability; <b>hydrogen</b> <b>telluride</b> decomposes in moisture, in light, and in temperatures above 0 °C. Polonium hydride is unstable, and due to the intense radioactivity of polonium (resulting in self-radiolysis upon formation), only trace quantities may be obtained by treating dilute hydrochloric acid with polonium-plated magnesium foil. Its properties are somewhat distinct {{from the rest of the}} hydrogen chalcogenides, since polonium is a metal while the other chalcogens are not, and hence this compound is intermediate between a normal hydrogen chalcogenide or hydrogen halide such as hydrogen chloride, and a metal hydride like stannane. Like water, the first of the group, polonium hydride is also a liquid at room temperature. Unlike water, however, the strong intermolecular attractions that cause the higher boiling point are van der Waals interactions, an effect of the large electron clouds of polonium.|$|E
40|$|The key {{step in the}} {{synthesis}} of four diastereomers of casuarine from eight carbon sugar lactones is the efficient reduction of open chain azidodimesylates by sodium <b>hydrogen</b> <b>telluride</b> [Suzuki-Takaoka reduction] to allow {{the formation of the}} pyrrolizidine nucleus by bicyclisation. This is the first report of {{the synthesis}} of such highly oxygenated pyrrolizidines...|$|E
40|$|<b>Hydrogen</b> <b>telluride</b> (H 2 Te) is {{prepared}} by the modified method of Moser and Doctor for H 2 Se. Hydrogen chalcogenides, H 2 X (X=O,S,Se,Te) are reported to be of C 2 v symmetry by many previous papers, and no one reports the molecules to be of D∞h symmetry. However some of the present authors (K. Hamada and H. Morishita) report the R-X-R (R=CH 3, C 2 H 5) type molecules to have a linear -X-. The present authors have, therefore, found it worthwhile to investigate the structures of H 2 X by measuring the vibrational spectra of these molecules...|$|E
30|$|The CdTe QDs {{colloidal}} solutions {{were prepared}} {{according to a}} method proposed by Weller’s group [24]. The method {{is based on the}} interaction between cadmium thioglycolate and Te 2 − anions in an aqueous medium. To prepare the initial precursor, aliquots of 0.01  M 3 CdSO 4 · 8 H 2 O solution and 98  % thioglycolic acid (TGA) from Sigma-Aldrich were mixed and the solution was titrated by 1  M sodium hydroxide until the pH became 11. As a Te 2 − source, we used electrolytically generated <b>hydrogen</b> <b>telluride</b> which was bubbled through the preceding solution deaerated by argon flow. The final step of the synthesis was CdS shell formation by refluxing the colloid for several hours.|$|E
30|$|In a 50 -mL two-neck flask, 278.8  mg NaBH 4 and 7  mL double {{distilled}} water were deaerated with argon and stirred for 30  min. Then, 90  mg tellurium powder was added, and the resulting suspension was stirred under argon until tellurium powder was completely dissolved. After that, the resulting suspension was cooled down to 0 °C under vigorous stirring and argon bubbling. During 15  min, the characteristic color of the suspension changed from faint pink to colorless state. The disappearance of the solution color {{is due to the}} formation of aqueous sodium <b>hydrogen</b> <b>telluride</b> (NaHTe) solution. After removal by filtration, the obtained solution transferred into the two-neck flask and 42  mL of double {{distilled water}} was added, deaerated with argon, and stirred for 120  min. Finally, the prepared NaHTe solution was kept at 5 °C and was used freshly in the next experiments.|$|E
30|$|The {{water-soluble}} thiol-capped CdTe QDs {{were prepared}} via the modified hydrothermal route using the thiolglycolic acid as a stabilizer [20]. Briefly, by a molar ratio of 2 : 1, sodium borohydride {{was used to}} react with tellurium in water to prepare the sodium <b>hydrogen</b> <b>telluride</b> (NaHTe). Fresh solutions of NaHTe were diluted with N 2 -saturated deionic water to 0.0467 M for further use. CdCl 2 (1 mmol) and thioglycolic acid (1.2 mmol) were dissolved in 50 mL of deionized water. Stepwise addition of NaOH solution adjusted the precursors solution to pH = 9. Then, 0.096 mL of oxygen-free solution containing fresh NaHTe, cooled to 0 °C, was added into 10 mL of the above precursor solution and vigorously stirred. Finally, the solution with a faint yellow color was put into a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave with a volume of 15 mL. The autoclave was maintained at the reaction temperature (200 °C) {{for a certain time}} and then cooled to the room temperature by a hydro-cooling process.|$|E
30|$|The Glu capped CdTe QDs were {{synthesized}} {{according to}} a modified, previously reported procedure [42]. In short, 2.75  mmol of Cd(ClO 4) 2 • 6 H 2 O were dissolved in 125  mL water and followed by adding of 3.6  mmol Glu as the stabilizer. The pH of the solution was adjusted to 12 by dropwise adding of 1  M NaOH. The resulting solution {{was placed in a}} three-necked flask and flushed with Argon for 30  min to remove all oxygen. The gaseous Te-precursor <b>hydrogen</b> <b>telluride</b> H 2 Te was generated by reacting 0.2  g (0.458  mmol) Al 2 Te 3 with 5  mL of a 0.5  M H 2 SO 4 solution and passed through the solution under slow argon flow and vigorous stirring. The growth of the CdTe QDs proceeded under open air conditions at 100  °C and reflux. After precipitation in isopropanol and re-dispersing in water, the final colloidal QDs solution was obtained.|$|E
40|$|A set of {{water-soluble}} CdTe {{quantum dots}} (QDs) was {{prepared by the}} chemical reaction between cadmium chloride and sodium <b>hydrogen</b> <b>telluride</b> {{in the presence of}} 3 -mercaptopropionic acid (MPA). QDs were characterized using fluorescence spectroscopy, lifetime measurements, slab-gel and capillary electrophoresis. The particle sizes, determining the wavelength of the fluorescence emission, were evaluated to be from 2. 5 nm (500 nm) to 5. 2 nm (750 nm). The fluorescence lifetimes determined by the time-resolved fluorescence spectrometry, increases from 3. 05 to 20. 5 ns with the increasing size of particles. The uptake of non-conjugated QDs into the living cells, which has a potential for single cell analyses, was apparent for human lymphocytes and yeast cells (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) after 30 minutes and 3 hours, respectively. The cell manipulation, lysis and monitoring was performed in microfluidic devices with laser-induced fluorescence detection. The conjugation of QDs with functional biomolecules allows the selective labeling and localization of specific molecules. Several coupling agents such as N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide (NHS) and 1 -ethyl- 3 -(3 - dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) or carbonyldiimidazole (CDI) were used. The concentrations of reaction products were checked by capillary electrophoresis with laser-induced fluorescence detection...|$|E
30|$|The {{synthesis}} of CdTe QDs {{has been described}} in detail elsewhere [22]. Briefly, 100 mg sodium borohydride was used to react with 127 mg (1 mmol) tellurium in 20 ml of distilled water under an ice water bath condition to prepare sodium <b>hydrogen</b> <b>telluride</b> (NaHTe). With continuous steady nitrogen flow and vigorous stirring, a clear and purple NaHTe solution was successfully produced. To ensure that the mole ratio of Cd 2 + to MPA was 1 : 1.8, 366.6 mg (2 mmol) CdCl 2 and 382.1 mg (3.6 mmol) MPA were dissolved in 100 ml of water followed by adjustment of pH to 9.0 in the ice water bath. Then, 1 ml of oxygen-free solution containing fresh NaHTe, cooled to 0 °C, was added to 20 ml of the above CdCl 2 -MPA solution and vigorously stirred. Finally, a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave with a volume of 9 ml of precursor solution {{was placed in a}} drying oven at 185 °C. The precipitation products were washed with ethanol three times and then put into a vacuum drying oven at 40 °C. Primary QDs were thus obtained. The photoluminescence (PL) quantum yield (QY) of CdTe QDs was estimated by comparison with Rhodamine 6 G in ethanol at room temperature, assuming its PL QY as 45 % [22]. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of CdTe QDs were taken on a Rigaku D/MAX-IIA diffractometer (Shibuya-ku, Japan) using Cu KαR radiation [21].|$|E
