While word went about regarding this, Marie {{went to her}} notary with the will, not knowing that it was invalid. Only Emma Pontier would <b>go</b> <b>near</b> her and, already torn by doubts, told Marie that Lafarge's brother-in-law {{was going to the}} police at Brive.

Another neighbor, Howard Haulk, said he heard one large blast followed by several smaller blasts over the course of about 20 minutes. The initial blast shattered glass in the Haulks' living room.|$|E

25|$|Robinson {{was only}} briefed by Aborigines on the {{massacre}} when 30 {{men and women}} from various clans of the Gunditjmara people met with him on 23 March 1842 at Campbell's station on the Merri River and told him that all but two men of the Kilcarer gundidj clan were slain in the massacre. The two survivors were called Pollikeunnuc and Yarereryarerer and were adopted by the Cart Gundidj clan of Mount Clay. The Cart Gundidj would not allow any member of the clan to <b>go</b> <b>near</b> the settlement of Portland following the massacre, although in May 1842 Cart Gundidj resistance leader Partpoaermin was captured at the Convincing Ground after a violent struggle.|$|E
25|$|Negative {{spirits are}} {{believed}} to be irritated or angered by human presence. Negative spirits are responsible for accidents, illnesses, and deaths befalling those who have had contact with their habitation. Thus even today, haunted places are especially sacrosanct, to the point that many people refuse to develop perfectly suited properties or live next to beautiful areas because they have been judged to be inhabited by a negative spirit. An especially famous example of this is the half-finished Nakagusuku Hotel ruins that stand within walking distance from Nakagusuku Castle in Kitanakagusuku, which was abandoned during its construction as the result of several deaths both on- and off-site and still stands as it was; most Okinawan people will not <b>go</b> <b>near</b> the hotel.|$|E
25|$|The next week, Stacey and T.J. take an {{examination}} and T.J. creates cheat sheets that he gives to Stacey {{when he sees}} Mrs. Logan approaching. She finds the notes, accuses Stacey of cheating on the test and whips {{him in front of}} the class before failing him. After school, T.J. runs to the Wallace store, which the Logans forbid their children from visiting due to the Wallaces causing much of the black people's troubles. Stacey follows T.J. and the others follow Stacey. Mr. Morrison finds them fighting and separates them, much to the Wallace's anger. Instead of telling their mother, Morrison leaves Stacey to do it himself. Stacey tells her and she takes the children to visit the Berrys. Mr. Berry is badly burned, gruesomely disfigured and mute. Mama explains that the Wallaces are responsible for this and that is why they are never to <b>go</b> <b>near</b> Wallace's store again.|$|E

25|$|In {{the poem}} Lalla Radha and the Churel, a priest warns the protagonist to not <b>go</b> <b>near</b> the Peepul trees {{because that is}} where the Churel lives and she might take him away and kill him. He still went to the Peepul tree and she called out to him in a sweet tone and seduced him until he went to her. Blinded by his desire, he did not notice that while he lay with her, his body seemed to get frailer until he died in a state of ecstasy. In The Female Element in Indian Culture, it says, “The Churel runs after and seeks to possess every man whom she meets, for, it is said, her carnal {{appetite}} remains unsatisfied in life”. She also possesses girls during dances, causing a trance. According to Persian legend, when travelers saw the tracks of a Churel in the dirt they would try to flee by heading in the opposite direction, but her reversed feet would inevitably lead them right into her grasp. The Patari and Majhwar think that she appears to take her victims to the mountains and {{the only way they can}} be freed is if a goat is sacrificed.|$|E
25|$|An MP for {{the ruling}} Pakistan Peoples Party, Syed Mumtaz Alam Gillani, {{has come forward}} with {{testimony}} evidencing a purportedly serious security breach at the Marriott on the night between 16 and 17 September, several days before the bombing. Alam Gillani and two friends {{are said to have}} witnessed several large steel boxes being unloaded from a U.S. Embassy truck by a group of U.S. Marines and, according to someone at the hotel, transported to the fourth and fifth floors. Among the several people who witnessed this incident was Pakistan Peoples Party leader Sajjad Chaudhry. However, Alam Gilani {{was the only one who}} objected to and protested the apparent security breach taking place, but was met with silence from the American Marines. The hotel security staff did not respond to Alam Gilani's protests as they passively watched what was taking place, not being allowed to <b>go</b> <b>near</b> the boxes by the U.S. Marines. Alam Gilani has since denounced the newspaper account, asserting that he was merely making light conversation with the journalist; the newspaper, however, stands by its account. Pakistani authorities are also investigating this issue.|$|E

However, the Red River did not <b>go</b> <b>near</b> {{the level of}} the 1997 flood and only caused minor damage, primarily in rural areas, including water over roads and bridges. [...] The lack of damage done to Grand Forks and East Grand Forks in particular can largely be attributed to the aforementioned improved dikes and Greenway zone.|$|E

He added, [...] "You are so absolutely necessary to us that we can do nothing, resolve on nothing without you." ...|$|E
500|$|The film opens when Sayo Arima, a girl {{brought up}} in a wealthy family and now an elderly woman, {{unexpectedly}} receives a manuscript written by Haigo, a circus clown whom she met many years ago. It deals with the events seventy years earlier when Sayo was friends with Sota, a poor village boy who lived with his grandfather and dreamt of being a painter. The film moves back to that time, when a circus came to the town where Sayo and Sota lived. Despite Sota's grandfather warning him not to <b>go</b> <b>near</b> the circus, Sota goes with Sayo. After the performance, they sneak backstage and are caught by the circus clown Haigo, who kindly gives Sota an egg, which he had intended to buy for his grandfather. Sota believes that the clown can read his mind, and calls him Kamisama, which means [...] "god" [...] in Japanese.|$|E
500|$|The album sold {{a million}} copies in the United States, and five million worldwide. Taraborrelli felt that at that moment, riding on Madonna's coattails proved {{profitable}} for everyone involved, including Warner Bros. Records, which notched up big sales with a compilation soundtrack album that was basically a showcase for its marginal artists. But still they wanted to [...] "milk-in" [...] the success of Madonna, a view shared by Peter Guber and Jon Peters, executive producers of the film. Hence they felt a worldwide concert tour was the appropriate thing to do, since it would promote both the soundtrack and the film, as well as Madonna's successful third studio album True Blue, released the year before. As Madonna's first world tour, Who's That Girl ended up being a resounding success, although by its end, Madonna declared {{that she did not}} want to hear any of her songs again and she did not know whether she would ever write another one. [...] "I returned feeling so burned out and I was convinced that I wouldn't <b>go</b> <b>near</b> music for quite a while", she said.|$|E

500|$|Lody's {{information}} was entirely inaccurate {{and had been}} gleaned, as he was to admit at his trial, purely from rumours: [...] "I heard it in the boarding-house and I heard it in the barber's shop." [...] His second letter, in German, was addressed to [...] "Herr Stammer" [...] at German naval intelligence in Courbierestrasse, Berlin, and contained details of British naval losses and vessels stationed at Leith and Grangemouth. He had obtained details of the naval vessels simply by climbing Calton Hill in Edinburgh and observing the panorama from the summit, and by taking a promenade along the seafront at Grangemouth, used by thousands of citizens as a popular excursion. He {{was worried about the}} risks that he was taking and stated in his letter that he would not <b>go</b> <b>near</b> any place where he could be challenged, or where barricades and restrictions prevented access. His lack of training or preparation meant that these letters, like all of his communications, were written with no attempt at concealment whatsoever– no code or invisible ink– and were composed entirely en clair in ordinary written English or German.|$|E
500|$|Assigned {{to produce}} the serial was Dixon of Dock Green {{producer}} Joe Waters. Preliminary filming on Quatermass began in June 1973 at Ealing Studios where special effects designer Jack Wilkie and his assistant, Ian Scoones, shot model footage, for part one of the serial, of a space station with astronauts working on its hull. At this point the BBC got cold feet about the project; they had become concerned {{about the cost of}} mounting the production and had been refused permission to film at Stonehenge, one of the locations at which Kneale had envisaged the Planet People would gather to be reaped by the alien force. Kneale recalled that Stonehenge [...] "had become Big Business and the place was like a factory with tourists there from dawn to dusk... they weren't going to let anyone <b>go</b> <b>near</b> it". Kneale also felt that the BBC were unhappy with the script believing it [...] "didn't suit their image at that time; it was too gloomy". In the end, it was decided during summer 1973 that for financial reasons the BBC would not proceed with the production. However the BBC still had an option on the script until 1975, and they retained this until it expired.|$|E
500|$|The tenth track, [...] "White Christmas", was {{the first}} song to be {{recorded}} for Wrapped in Red. A cover of Rodgers and Hammerstein's [...] "My Favorite Things" [...] follows up as the eleventh track. Clarkson opted for the Broadway performance of the song to stray away from Julie Andrews' version, citing: [...] "I think you shouldn't <b>go</b> <b>near</b> anywhere of what she's doing because she's so good." [...] Clarkson and Kurstin co-wrote [...] "4 Carats" [...] with Cathy Dennis and Livvi Franc. Originally written as a pop song, they converted it into a Christmas song to fit the album's theme, describing it as a crossover between Eartha Kitt's [...] "Santa Baby" [...] (1953) and Madonna's [...] "Material Girl" [...] (1984). A rendition of Imogen Heap's [...] "Just for Now" [...] was described by Clarkson as her highly dysfunctional environment, saying: [...] "Can we just stop for like five minutes and have like a normal Christmas setting?" [...] The song begins by sampling the melody of the Christmas tune [...] "Carol of the Bells". The closing track, a rendition of the traditional carol [...] "Silent Night", features McEntire and Trisha Yearwood and ends in an a cappella setting between the trio. In addition, two tracks were {{also included in the}} deluxe edition of the album: the first, Clarkson's cover of [...] "I'll Be Home for Christmas" [...] from her iTunes Session extended play, and the second, her rendition of the first stanza of the ecclesiastical hymn [...] "Oh Come, Oh Come Emmanuel".|$|E
