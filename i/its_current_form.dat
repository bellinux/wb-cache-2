5|$|The {{core of the}} I Ching is a Western Zhou divination text {{called the}} Changes of Zhou (周易 Zhōu yì). Various modern {{scholars}} suggest dates ranging between the 10th and 4th centuries BC for the assembly of the text in approximately <b>its</b> <b>current</b> <b>form.</b> Based on {{a comparison of the}} language of the Zhou yi with dated bronze inscriptions, the American sinologist Edward Shaughnessy dated its compilation in <b>its</b> <b>current</b> <b>form</b> to {{the early decades of the}} reign of King Xuan of Zhou, in the last quarter of the 9th century BC. A copy of the text in the Shanghai Museum corpus of bamboo and wooden slips (recovered in 1994) shows that the Zhou yi was used throughout all levels of Chinese society in <b>its</b> <b>current</b> <b>form</b> by 300 BC, but still contained small variations as late as the Warring States period. It is possible that other divination systems existed at this time; the Rites of Zhou name two other such systems, the Lianshan and the Guizang.|$|E

5|$|John de Breton (died c. 12 May 1275) was {{a medieval}} Bishop of Hereford. He {{served as a}} royal justice and sheriff before being {{nominated}} to Hereford. He is sometimes credited with the legal treatise Britton; but in <b>its</b> <b>current</b> <b>form</b> Breton cannot be the author as the work refers to laws written 15 years after the bishop's death.|$|E
5|$|On August 24–25, 1814, in a raid {{known as}} the Burning of Washington, British forces invaded the capital during the War of 1812. The Capitol, Treasury, and White House were burned and gutted during the attack. Most {{government}} buildings were repaired quickly; however, the Capitol was largely under construction {{at the time and}} was not completed in <b>its</b> <b>current</b> <b>form</b> until 1868.|$|E
5|$|The Broadway Hollywood Building {{was built}} as a {{department}} store, but has been refurbished as both commercial office space and as <b>its</b> <b>current</b> <b>form</b> of residential condominiums.

5|$|The main gun {{tower is}} flanked by two mid-16th century gun platforms, altered in the 18th century to house newer forms of artillery. Just behind the gun tower is Saint Petrox Church, a three-aisled {{building}} which dates in <b>its</b> <b>current</b> <b>form</b> to 1641, with some alterations resulting from its restoration in 1833.|$|E
5|$|The {{structure}} that stands {{on what is}} known locally as the Canal Bank, called Cromwell's Castle, primarily derives <b>its</b> <b>current</b> <b>form</b> from the Napoleonic Wars. Similar to the Martello Tower that stands opposite it, on the same bank of the river, Cromwell's Castle was largely reconstructed as a defensive position to repel any invading fleet coming upstream towards Banagher.|$|E
5|$|Although {{visually}} {{similar to}} Rare's family-oriented Nintendo 64 platform games Banjo-Kazooie and Donkey Kong 64, Conker's Bad Fur Day {{was designed for}} mature audiences and features graphic violence, alcohol and tobacco use, profanity, vulgar humor and pop culture references. It was developed {{over the course of}} four years and was originally intended for a family audience, but was ultimately retooled into <b>its</b> <b>current</b> <b>form</b> because previews were criticised for being both too cute and similar to Rare's earlier platform games.|$|E

5|$|Appearing on a {{document}} of May 28, 1239, the oldest seal of Munich has {{a picture of}} a monk wearing an open hood. While all seal impressions show the monk with the book in one hand and three outstretched fingers in the other, the monk has varied slightly, appearing in profile, then later full-faced and bare-headed. By the 19th century the figure was portrayed as youthful and became known as the Münchner Kindl or Munich Child. The coat of arms in <b>its</b> <b>current</b> <b>form</b> was created in 1957 and is still an important symbol of the Bavarian state capital.|$|E
5|$|Archimedes' Book of Lemmas or Liber Assumptorum is a {{treatise}} with fifteen propositions on {{the nature}} of circles. The earliest known copy of the text is in Arabic. The scholars T. L.

The Lemmas may be based on an earlier work by Archimedes that is now lost.|$|E
5|$|In 1933, the {{government}} brought the UERL and the Metropolitan Railway {{together as a}} single organisation, the London Passenger Transport Board.

5|$|M-138 {{became a}} part of the state highway system in 1931 between then M-24 (current M-15) in Bay County and then M-83 in Tuscola County. In early 1940, the highway was {{extended}} east and northeasterly through Akron to end at M-25 in Unionville; {{by the end of the}} year, all of M-138 was paved. When M-24 was extended northward from Caro in 1997, it supplanted the M-138 designation from the Akron area north to Unionville; the latter highway was truncated to <b>its</b> <b>current</b> <b>form</b> as a result.|$|E
5|$|Peterborough is a borough {{constituency}} {{represented in}} the House of Commons of the UK Parliament. <b>Its</b> <b>current</b> <b>form</b> is the direct, unbroken successor of a smaller constituency that {{was created in the}} mid-16th century as such used for the legislatures of England, Great Britain and the United Kingdom (UK). Today's version of the seat elects one Member of Parliament by the first past the post system of election since 1885, before which its earlier form had two-member representation using the similar bloc vote system and both forms had a broadening but restricted franchise until 1918.|$|E

5|$|The castle {{remained}} in royal hands {{until it was}} given to John Dudley in 1553. Dudley came to prominence under Henry VIII and became the leading political figure under Edward VI.

Before his execution in 1553 by Queen Mary for attempting to place Lady Jane Grey on the throne, Dudley had built the new stable block and widened the tiltyard to <b>its</b> <b>current</b> <b>form.</b>|$|E

The Arts and Crafts style garden is modeled on that at Hidcote Manor Garden in Gloucestershire. It was originally laid out by Phyllis Reiss and developed by Penelope Hobhouse.|$|E
5|$|Under the {{original}} 1838 charter, mayors were elected citywide for {{a term of}} one year. In 1868 the State Legislature extended the term of office to two years. In 1892, the Legislature again changed the term of office, extending it to five years. The city adopted a commission form of government under the Walsh Act in 1913. This form provided for five commissioners elected citywide. The Commissioners decided from among themselves which would serve as mayor. All terms were four years.

30|$|The {{increase}} in part-time arrangements {{is a sign}} of growing flexibility on the labour markets. One question in this context is whether flexibility in fact characterises a new development at all. Kratzer [4] asserts that flexibility in itself is nothing new, although <b>its</b> <b>current</b> <b>forms</b> certainly are. Following this interpretation, “conventional” normal employment in a Post-Fordist sense is already a type of flexible employment. 2 Work, labour as well as the working environment are all dramatically changing. According to Kratzer, this is not a transformation from a stable system to a flexible one, but more “(…) a transition of flexibilisation, virtually a flexibilisation of the flexibilisation” [4, p. 3].|$|R
