Vouchered, or vouched, means that an invoice is approved for payment and has been recorded in the General Ledger or AP subledger as an outstanding, or open, liability because {{it has not been}} paid. Payables are often categorized as Trade Payables, payables for the purchase of physical goods that are recorded in Inventory, and Expense Payables, payables for the purchase of goods or services that are expensed. Common examples of Expense Payables are advertising, travel, entertainment, office supplies and utilities.

40|$|Delinquent <b>invoice</b> <b>payments</b> can be {{a source}} of {{financial}} instability if it is poorly managed. Research in supply chain finance shows that effective invoice collection is positively correlated with the overall financial performance of companies. In this thesis I address the problem of predicting the delinquent <b>invoice</b> <b>payments</b> in advance with machine learning of historical invoice data. Specifically, this thesis demonstrates how supervised learning models can be used to detect the invoices that would have delay payments, as well as the problematic customers, which enables customized collection actions from the firm. The model from this thesis can predict with high accuracy if an invoice will be paid on time or not and also estimate the magnitude of the delay. This thesis builds and trains its invoice delinquency prediction capability based on the real-world invoice data from a Fortune 500 company. by Hu Peiguang. Thesis: S.

Medijska hiša Delo, d. d. je trenutno na pragu uvajanja celovite programske rešitve v svoj informacijski sistem. V diplomski nalogi so v prvem delu opisane osnove celovitih rešitev ter možni pristopi k prenovi poslovanja podjetja. Predstavljena je celovita rešitev SAP ERP. V drugem delu je analiza obstoječega stanja v podjetju Delo, d. d. narejena z obravnavo procesa nabave izdelkov (surovin za izdelavo časopisa, kot so barve, papir, itd.) za proizvodnjo in tisk časopisov. Predstavljen je tudi prototip celovite rešitve SAP ERP na primeru nabavnega procesa. Nakazana je pot od zapisa novega izdelka v bazo do obdelave prejetega računa. Problem, ki se v nabavnem procesu v podjetju Delo, d. d. pojavlja, je predolgo trajanje od zaznave potrebe po izdelku do plačila računa. S pomočjo večje transparentnosti podatkov ter enotnim poslovanjem bi lahko veliko pripomogli k skrajšanju tega časa, prav to pa prinaša uvedba rešitve SAP ERP. Namen diplomske naloge je prikazati celovito rešitev SAP ERP in njeno uporabnost v podjetju Delo, d. d. na primeru nabavnega procesa. For a {{business}} {{to be a success}} a company needs an appropriate information support. This assures a general transparency and a quick access to the essential information, enabling a adequate business decisions. Delo, d. d., the media company, has recently started the introduction of the Enterprise resource planning into its information system. In the first part of my graduate thesis I have described the basics of the Enterprise resource planning with possible approaches for the reconstruction of the business management. In my second part I have made the status analysis of the company Delo, d. d. I have examined the process of the purchasing process (materials for the newspaper production, such as colours, paper, etc.) for the manufacturing and newspaper print. Moreover, with an example of the purchasing process I have introduced the prototype of the Enterprise resource planning solution SAP ERP. I have also showed the process from the initial noting of new product, into the working of the received receipt. The apparent issue of the purchasing process in the company Delo, d. d. seems to be the extensive time from the recognition of the need for a certain product, to the <b>invoice</b> <b>payment.</b> The business could shorten this prolonged time with the bigger data transparency and united management. However, the introduction of the SAP ERP will improve precisely this matter.

It is a rapidly growing network application that addresses a business fundamental: paperwork reduction in routine business transactions.
