5|$|Robert E. Hall applied {{rational}} expectations to Friedman's permanent <b>income</b> hypothesis that people base {{the level of}} their current spending on their wealth and lifetime <b>income</b> rather than current <b>income.</b> Hall found that people will smooth their consumption over time and only alter their consumption patterns when their expectations about future <b>income</b> change. Both Hall's and Friedman's versions of the permanent <b>income</b> hypothesis challenged the Keynesian view that short-term stabilization policies like tax cuts can stimulate the economy. The permanent <b>income</b> view suggests that consumers base their spending on wealth, so a temporary boost in <b>income</b> would only produce a moderate increase in consumption. Empirical tests of Hall's hypothesis suggest it may understate boosts in consumption due to <b>income</b> increases; however, Hall's work helped to popularize Euler equation models of consumption.|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} diploma {{thesis is}} a detailed {{analysis}} of tax <b>incomes</b> of municipalities and regions with focus on four particular municipalities and one region in a practical part. From the year 2001 to 2015 the share of tax <b>incomes</b> and their development are evaluated as a part of total <b>incomes.</b> The theme is highly topical due to ongoing discussions among lawmakers {{on the subject of}} budgetary allocation of taxes. The law determining the budgetary allocation of taxes is modified frequently, that is why knowing the impact of changes on particular municipalities or regions is helpful. This knowledge can be useful base for planning new adjustments of budgetary allocation of taxes. In the theoretical part there are mentioned expert opinions on financial management of municipalities and regions that arise from their functions and positions. The emphasis is put on <b>incomes</b> of municipalities and regions, especially on tax <b>incomes.</b> Particular changes from 2001 to 2015 in law regulating budgetary allocation of taxes are described here with their impacts on municipalities and regions. <b>Incomes</b> and management of selected municipalities representing various size categories and Liberec region are analysed in the practical part. Financial self-sufficiency is evaluated here. In general municipalities are more financial self-sufficient than regions. This thesis is further dealing with individual tax <b>incomes</b> and impacts of changes in budgetary allocation of taxes on their size. Making models of theoretical <b>incomes</b> is used to simulate effects of diverse law adjustments. Results of the analysis show that tax <b>incomes</b> of municipalities and regions are generally increasing. During the observed period there was tendency to lower the growth of tax <b>incomes</b> of large cities, to increase the growth of tax <b>incomes</b> of small municipalities and to straighten the level of tax <b>incomes</b> of medium municipalities thanks to changes in budgetary allocation of taxes. Tax <b>incomes</b> of regions were increased thanks to changes in budgetary allocation of taxes despite of partial decrease in particular segments of tax <b>incomes</b> after 2012...|$|R
