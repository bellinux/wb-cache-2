50|$|The D-40 {{uses the}} {{fuselage}} and empennage of the Rolladen-Schneider LS3. This is a GRP shell, slender aft of {{the wings and}} with a T-tail with straight tapered surfaces. The rather wide cockpit occupies most of the deeper forward fuselage and has a long, one piece, <b>front</b> <b>hinged</b> canopy. A retractable monowheel undercarriage was assisted by a tail bumper.|$|R
50|$|The single-seat {{pressurized}} cockpit {{also contained}} the avionics equipment. The cockpit was enclosed with a two-part transparent blue-tinted canopy {{consisting of a}} front-hinged tilting front part and a fixed rear part. The front part of the canopy served as a blast shield that protected the pilot from high velocity air when ejecting at supersonic speeds. Cockpit armor protection weighed 59.8 kg and consisted of bulletproof glass in the <b>front</b> <b>hinged</b> <b>front</b> part of the canopy, an armor plate at the front and armored backrest and headrest at the rear.|$|R
5000|$|The DKW 3=6 (F93). This {{was built}} in Brazil between 1958 and 1967 as the DKW-VEMAG Belcar ("beautiful car"). The station wagon was called the [...] "Vemaguet".

The front doors were <b>front</b> <b>hinged,</b> in total about 51,000 of the Belcar variants were built in Brazil.|$|R
5000|$|The Sylva Leader was an {{evolution}} of the Sylva Star retaining the two seater, open top, layout but with improved design features. The two piece fiberglass body consisted of a <b>front</b> <b>hinging</b> bonnet (hood) and low sided passenger compartment. Engine options were Ford Kent Crossflow and Fiat Twin cam engines.

50|$|After the Second World War, {{a number}} of {{manufacturers}} introduced microcars, which contained many of the elements that City Cars would {{come to be known}} for, such as small size and good maneuverability. Microcars were also among the first cars to marketed on their good parking ability; for example, Iso, and later BMW used the Isetta's <b>front</b> <b>hinged</b> door as a marketing advantage, saying you could pull into a parallel parking spot nose forward and exit onto the sidewalk using the door.|$|R
50|$|The Grantura {{bodyshell}} {{was made}} from glass-reinforced plastic and made use {{of a variety of}} proprietary components. The bonnet was <b>front</b> <b>hinged.</b> There was no opening at the rear but the boot could be accessed from inside the car - the spare wheel had to be removed through the front doors. Buyers could choose from a range of powerplants which included a choice of side or overhead valve engines from Ford, a Coventry Climax unit or the MGA B-series engine.|$|R

She also served as Team Manager in 2005.Bohn-Meyer died while practicing for the 2005 U.S. National Aerobatic Championships when the Giles 300 aerobatic aircraft she was piloting crashed in Yukon, Oklahoma, near the Clarence E. Page Municipal Airport. The cause of the crash was deemed to be the catastrophic failure of the <b>front</b> <b>hinge</b> of the canopy - which apparently incapacitated her and led to the crash.|$|R
50|$|Orders were {{received}} through XVIII Airborne Corps which directed the 1st Battalion to the 3rd Armored Division sector near Soy, Belgium.

Company D was immediately attached to the 3rd Armored's Task Force Kane. This unit held the key point on which the <b>front</b> <b>hinged.</b> Companies A and B detrucked northeast of Soy and was ordered to attack along the highway leading from Soy to Hotton.|$|R
50|$|The {{fuselage}} is a GRP monocoque with a <b>front</b> <b>hinged</b> canopy {{over the}} single seat cockpit and a tank for 150 kg (331 lb) of water ballast. The SB-12 has a T-tail, with tailplane and elevators set {{on top of}} a straight edged, only slightly tapered fin and rudder. The fixed surfaces are formed from GRP and plastic foam sandwich, the moving surfaces using only GRP. Its undercarriage has a retractable, unsprung monowheel, fitted with an internal drum brake, with a fixed, partly recessed tailwheel.|$|R

50|$|Some {{of these}} early city cars {{included}} the Bond Minicar and AC Petite in Britain; the Iso Isetta in Italy in 1953; the Fulda, Messerschmitt Kabinenroller, and Brütsh in Germany in 1954 (all two-seaters with a Fulda and Sachs two-stroke engine); the Goggomobil, and the Dornier-designed Zündapp Janus, which placed passengers back to back, and featured two <b>front</b> <b>hinged</b> doors similar to the Isetta's. However, these early microcars weren't true city cars; most were designed, built, and sold cheaply, mainly for poor customers in war ravaged Europe. With {{the exception of a}} few examples, these were also not designed for specific use in cities.|$|R
5000|$|The {{body and}} outfit had {{remained}} {{more or less}} the same, until in 1967 the modified Fiat 500 design introduced in 1965 was adopted in Graz. The most essential new feature were the <b>front</b> <b>hinged</b> doors as opposed to the former suicide doors. At the same time, the roof was adopted from Fiat. The new models were given the additional label [...] "Europa". In 1969, due to decreasing demand, it was decided to adopt not only the body but the complete drivetrain minus engine from Fiat. The engine was the only unit remaining under local manufacture and the model was now called 500 S (Sport).|$|R
50|$|A sailor's valentine {{is a form}} of shellcraft, a type {{of mostly}} antique souvenir, or sentimental gift made using large numbers of small seashells. These were {{originally}} made between 1830 and 1890, and they were designed to be brought home from a sailor's voyage at sea and given to the sailor's loved one or loved ones. Sailor valentines are typically octagonal, glass <b>fronted,</b> <b>hinged</b> wooden boxes ranging from 8 to 20 in in width, displaying intricate symmetrical designs composed entirely of small sea shells of various colors glued onto a backing. Patterns often feature a centerpiece such as a compass rose or a heart design, hence the name, and in some cases the small shells are used to spell out a motto or sentimental message.|$|R
50|$|First model {{change from}} {{previous}} generation saw minor improvements, to include {{installation of the}} <b>front</b> door <b>hinges</b> to a conventional implementation {{as opposed to the}} rear-hinged door. The design was boxier over all, with a more wedgy appearance. This generation was also offered as an all-electric truck and van.|$|R
5000|$|Under {{direction}} by Bill Mitchell, the Corvair Monza GT coupe {{was designed by}} Larry Shinoda and Tony Lapine in 1962, borrowing from the Bertone designed Testudo concept car. Like the earlier design, the GT doors swung upward and were actually a <b>front</b> <b>hinged</b> canopy that extended into the B section; the rear engine cover also hinged at the rear. The engine was a standard Corvair [...] , flat six with two carburetors. Unlike the production Corvair, the GT engine was mounted ahead of the transaxle, turned around 180 degrees and mounted as a mid-engine layout. The chassis was on a 92 in wheelbase, 16 in shorter than production cars. The overall dimensions were similarly reduced with a length of 165 in, and a height of 42 in, creating a small but well-proportioned sports car.|$|R

Success on the software <b>front</b> <b>hinges</b> {{on the design of}} algorithms that can scale up with system size. Given that the number of individual cooperating devices will reach high orders of magnitude (hundreds of thousands or even millions), debugging and evaluating the software in such a large system can reap much benefit from simulation.

This simulator also provides detailed models for radio signal propagation and node mobility...|$|R
50|$|In 1968 the RPB Piraya was introduced. It was a low, two seated kit {{car with}} gullwing-doors {{inspired}} by the Ford GT40 and made for a Volkswagen Beetle chassis. It sold 40 kits {{in less than a}} year, but some customers found it difficult to assemble the cars. In 1969 the RPB-GT was introduced. Prices started at 3800 SEK. The design was similar to the Piraya, but had normal <b>front</b> <b>hinged</b> doors. The kit was made easier to assemble for the customer. The GT sold well, most as kits, but some as completed cars. It used a fuel tank from Renault 10, <b>hinges</b> to the <b>front</b> and rear hood came from Renault 4, door handles and locks from Renault 16, door hinges and side windows (cut to size) from the Mini, the front screen from a 1967 Chevrolet Corvette, rear and front lights were Hella universal (although the same headlight units was also used in Saab 96, Saab 99 and Renault 16).|$|R

5000|$|The Hartmann {{alligator}} forceps or Hartmann {{foreign body}} forceps are {{named after the}} German physician Arthur Hartmann medical forceps for removing foreign bodies. It is used in addition to surgery mainly in otorhinolaryngology (ENT). More than 80% of the Hartmann alligator forceps are produced in Pakistan in small workshops handmade in many variations of the mouth. Their quality depends on the origin {{and quality of the}} stainless steel. Indian steel is used often for hobbyist use. FDA and CE certified instruments also veterinary instruments are normal made of Japanese or German steel.The shaft length varies up to one meter, is predominantly 8 to 12 cm. Only the top mouth opens alligator-like. (in US therefore has the medical term [...] "Alligator Mouth" [...] or [...] "Hartmann Alligator Forceps" [...] enforced. A common name also is [...] "Crocodile forceps"). The standard length of the muzzle from the <b>front</b> <b>hinge</b> implementation is 1.5 cm or 1 cm.
