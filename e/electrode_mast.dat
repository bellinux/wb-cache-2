40|$|The DREAMS {{package is}} an {{integrated}} multi-sensor scientic payload mainly devoted to characterizing the landing site environment in dusty conditions (dust properties/abundance, potential electric activity, meteorological state such us environmental parameters. DREAMS architecture is conceived with a modular approach to provides interfaces {{and resources to}} several sensors. The current baseline is composed by the following units: primary battery holding an <b>electrode</b> <b>mast</b> and a Common Electronic Unit (CEU) holding an Environmental mast to which anemometer, thermometer, optical sensor, pressure and humidity sensor are connected. The CEU show a multi-stack conguration in which the following functionalities are implemented: Power distribution, data acquisition (both analog and digital sensors, DataHandling, data compression and data storage, thermal control and I/Fs to EDM, CanBUS for data exchange, and Power interfaces both redundant. In addition a timer functionality is implemented to manage the switch on-Switch o of the CEU and the Sensors according to signal received from EDM via CanBus. The extreme temperature range to which DREAMS is exposed, forces to a demanding thermal design and a robust thermal control to guarantee in particular for the battery operational temperature range in which its eciency is compliant to provide 300 - 400 [Wh] for Martian operations and thermal conditioning. The DREAMS modular approach meets EDM Surface PayLoad accommodation constraints (total mass 3 [kg] including maturity margins, data volume 50 [Mbit], data transmission two times per sol) as well as options oering signicant increase of science return. The DREAMS package gathers a wide consortium of institutions led by Italy, re ecting the current involvement of European countries in the ExoMars program...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Four main {{ingredients}} {{of the dust}} and four material corona electrodes were selected from sintering machine electrostatic precipitator (ESP) in this paper, affinity differences of the corona electrode with the four kinds of dusts can be concluded from the experiment {{on the condition of}} low voltage. According to the composition of dust to be processed in actual production, corresponding corona electrode and collecting plate materials should be selected to improve the phenomenon of corona <b>electrode</b> surface <b>mast</b> and tip balling and to improve collection efficiency...|$|R
