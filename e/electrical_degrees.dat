5000|$|Sometimes as a {{precaution}} against out-of-step connection of a machine to a system, a [...] "synchro check" [...] relay is installed that prevents closing the generator circuit breaker unless the machine is within a few <b>electrical</b> <b>degrees</b> of being in-phase with the system.

50|$|As {{the speed}} increases, the {{inductance}} of the rotor {{means that the}} ideal commutating point changes. Small motors typically have fixed commutation. While some larger universal motors have rotatable commutation, this is rare. Instead larger universal motors often have compensation windings in series with the motor, or sometimes inductively coupled, and placed at ninety <b>electrical</b> <b>degrees</b> to the main field axis. These reduce the reactance of the armature, and improve the commutation.|$|E

These signals are inverted “A”, “B” and “Z” signals. Controllers can compare each pair (“A” must be equal to inverted “/A”) to ensure that there is no error during the transmission.|$|E
50|$|A simple {{anti-fading}} antenna is {{a vertical}} radiator whose height is between 1/2 wavelength (180 <b>electrical</b> <b>degrees)</b> and 5/9 wavelength (200 degrees), 195 degrees being considered ideal. 200 degree and taller simple radiators have largely fallen into disuse, although {{these can be}} useful on medium power stations, in which case radiators as tall as 5/8 wavelength (225 degrees) are somewhat common. Any simple radiator (or array of radiators) which is taller than 195 degrees is generally not considered to have anti-fading properties.|$|E
5000|$|Another manual {{method of}} {{synchronization}} relies on observing an instrument called a [...] "synchroscope", which displays the relative frequencies of system and generator. The pointer of the synchroscope will indicate [...] "fast" [...] or [...] "slow" [...] {{speed of the}} generator {{with respect to the}} system. To minimize the transient current when the generator circuit breaker is closed, usual practice is to initiate the close as the needle slowly approaches the in-phase point. An error of a few <b>electrical</b> <b>degrees</b> between system and generator will result in a momentary inrush and abrupt speed change of the generator.|$|E

50|$|There {{are some}} loads, however, that are {{affected}} by even the slightest loss of power. There are also operational conditions where it may be desirable to transfer loads with zero interruption of power when conditions permit. For these applications, closed transition transfer switches can be provided. The switch will operate in a make-before-break mode provided both sources are acceptable and synchronized. Typical parameters determining synchronization are: voltage difference less than 5%, frequency difference less than 0.2 Hz, and maximum phase angle between the sources of 5 <b>electrical</b> <b>degrees.</b> This means the engine driving the generator supplying one of the sources generally must be controlled by an isochronous governor.|$|E
50|$|The rotor is a {{cylindrical}} core made {{of steel}} lamination with slots to hold the wires for its 3-phase windings which are evenly spaced at 120 <b>electrical</b> <b>degrees</b> apart and connected in a 'Y' configuration. The rotor winding terminals are brought out and attached to the three slips rings with brushes, on the shaft of the rotor. Brushes on the slip rings allow for external three-phase resistors to be connected in series to the rotor windings for providing speed control. The external resistances {{become a part of}} the rotor circuit to produce a large torque when starting the motor. As the motor speeds up, the resistances can be reduced to zero.|$|E

40|$|The present {{invention}} relates {{generally to}} an electric motor winding and, more particularly, to a three phase motor armature winding arrangement designed to reduce motor vibration and improve efficiency. An individual phase winding arrangement having a sixty <b>electrical</b> <b>degree</b> phase belt width for use with a three phase motor armature includes a delta connected phase winding portion and a wye connected phase winding portion. Both the delta and wye connected phase winding portions have a thirty <b>electrical</b> <b>degree</b> phase belt width.

5000|$|WSM's unusual {{diamond-shaped}} antenna (manufactured by Blaw-Knox) {{is visible}} from Interstate 65 {{just south of}} Nashville (in Brentwood) {{and is one of}} the area's landmarks. It is located near the I-65 exit 71 interchange with Concord Road (State Highway 253). When the 878-foot tower was built in 1932, it was the tallest antenna in North America. Its height was reduced to 808 feet (246 m) in 1939 when it was discovered that the taller tower was causing self-cancellation in the [...] "fringe" [...] areas of reception of the station (it is now known that 195 <b>electrical</b> <b>degrees,</b> about 810 feet, is the optimum height for a Class A station on that frequency). For a period during World War II it was designated to provide transmissions to submarines in the event that ship-to-shore communications were lost.

50|$|A {{split-phase}} motor has {{a secondary}} startup winding that is 90 <b>electrical</b> <b>degrees</b> {{to the main}} winding, always centered directly between the poles of the main winding, and connected to the main winding {{by a set of}} electrical contacts. The coils of this winding are wound with fewer turns of smaller wire than the main winding, so it has a lower inductance and higher resistance. The position of the winding creates a small phase shift between the flux of the main winding and the flux of the starting winding, causing the rotor to rotate. When the speed of the motor is sufficient to overcome the inertia of the load, the contacts are opened automatically by a centrifugal switch or electric relay. The direction of rotation is determined by the connection between the main winding and the start circuit. In applications where the motor requires a fixed rotation, one end of the start circuit is permanently connected to the main winding, with the contacts making the connection at the other end.|$|E
5000|$|In power engineering, {{winding factor}} is a {{technique}} that is employed to improve the rms generated voltage or emf in a three-phase AC electrical machine so that the output voltage and hence torque {{does not have any}} harmonics in it which may reduce efficiency. This is because the armature winding of each phase is distributed in a number of slots. Since the emf induced in different slots are not in phase, their phasor sum is less than their numerical sum. This reduction factor is called distribution factor Kd. Another factor that can reduce the winding factor is when the slot pitch is smaller than the pole pitch, called pitch factor Kp. The winding factor can be calculated as Kw = Kd * Kp To calculate the winding factor, Kw=Kd X Kp [...] ----(1) Where Kd=~1 (point here {{to keep in mind is}} that all(three phase) motors are balanced systems. Kp=Cos(a/2) ----(2) where a is the value of by which the coil is short-pitched To calculate a, one need to know and hence calculate the coil pitch and pole pitch of the motor. coil pitch It is the 2pi/number of slots. It needs to be in <b>electrical</b> <b>degrees</b> so divide the answer by 2. pole pitch It is 2pi/number of poles. Again, divide the answer by 2 to get elec deg.|$|E

5000|$|For broadcasting, mast {{radiators}} are {{the most}} common type of antenna used, consisting of a steel lattice guyed mast in which the mast structure itself is used as the antenna. Stations broadcasting with low power can use masts with heights of a quarter-wavelength (about 310 millivolts per meter using one kilowatt at one kilometer) to 5/8 wavelength (225 electrical degrees; about 440 millivolts per meter using one kilowatt at one kilometer), while high power stations mostly use half-wavelength to 5/9 wavelength. The usage of masts taller than 5/9 wavelength (200 electrical degrees; about 410 millivolts per meter using one kilowatt at one kilometer) with high power gives a poor vertical radiation pattern, and 195 <b>electrical</b> <b>degrees</b> (about 400 millivolts per meter using one kilowatt at one kilometer) is generally considered ideal in these cases. Usually mast antennas are series-excited (base driven); the feedline is attached to the mast at the base. The base of the antenna is at high electrical potential and must be supported on a ceramic insulator to isolate it from the ground. Shunt-excited masts, in which the base of the mast is at a node of the standing wave at ground potential and so does not need to be insulated from the ground, have fallen into disuse, except in cases of exceptionally high power, 1 MW or more, where series excitation might be impractical. If grounded masts or towers are required, cage or long-wire aerials are used. Another possibility consists of feeding the mast or the tower by cables running from the tuning unit to the guys or crossbars at a certain height.|$|E
