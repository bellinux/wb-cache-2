Lemaitre and Chambers were seen as the only gold medal contenders for the 100 m final at the European Athletics Championships, but the event defied <b>expectations</b> <b>in</b> terms of times and placings. The Frenchman won in 10.11seconds into a headwind while a tight finish between the four following athletes (all 10.18) saw Chambers finish fifth.|$|E

5|$|Attachments between {{infants and}} {{caregivers}} form {{even if this}} caregiver is not sensitive and responsive in social interactions with them. This has important implications. Infants cannot exit unpredictable or insensitive caregiving relationships. Instead they must manage themselves {{as best they can}} within such relationships. Based on her established Strange Situation Protocol, research by developmental psychologist Mary Ainsworth in the 1960s and 1970s found that children will have different patterns of attachment depending primarily on how they experienced their early caregiving environment. Early patterns of attachment, in turn, shape — but do not determine — the individual's <b>expectations</b> <b>in</b> later relationships.|$|E
5|$|Like Florida State, the Virginia Tech Hokies {{began the}} 1999college {{football}} season with raised <b>expectations.</b> <b>In</b> 1998, the Hokies had gone 93 {{during the regular}} season and had posted a 52 record against fellow Big East Conference teams. The Hokies concluded that 1998 season—which {{was supposed to be a}} rebuilding year—in the 1998 Music City Bowl, where the Hokies defeated the Alabama Crimson Tide, 387. With the addition of redshirt freshman quarterback Michael Vick to a team that had allowed an average of just 12.9points per game on defense, there was the possibility that Tech could improve upon its previous season's performance. Sports Illustrated, for example, predicted that the Hokies might challenge Miami for the Big East football championship, and the preseason Coaches' Poll ranked the Hokies No. 14 prior to the first game of the season.|$|E

One ground of the application was that the applicant had a legitimate expectation to two procedural rights: the opportunity to make representations to the Minister before he considered her case under the Immigration Act, and the duty of the Minister to give reasons for his decision.|$|E

5|$|The {{commercial}} success of Phantasmagoria had an immediate positive financial impact on Sierra On-Line. Even before its release, the company's stock rose in July 1995, up $3.875 to $30.875, which Vince Turzo of Jeffries & Co attributed {{in part due}} to anticipation of Phantasmagoria. Sierra's stock continued to rise after it was released. The company closed on the NASDAQ stock market at $43.25 on September 8, 1995, translating to a 73 percent gain in less than three months, which Turzo attributed partially to Phantasmagorias success. For the quarter ending September 30, 1995, Sierra posted a profit of $3.26 million, compared to a loss of $850,000 in 1994. This improvement exceeded <b>expectations</b> <b>in</b> analysts' forecasts, and was thanks largely to Phantasmagoria sales.|$|E

5|$|Though {{he was the}} team's second leading scorer, Tanguay {{continued}} {{to be the subject}} of trade talks throughout the season. Set to become a restricted free agent in July 2006, the Avalanche chose to trade his negotiating rights to the Calgary Flames at the 2006 NHL Entry Draft in exchange for defenceman Jordan Leopold and two second round draft picks. Tanguay felt that the team chose to trade him after he {{failed to live up to}} the team's <b>expectations</b> <b>in</b> the playoffs even though he {{continued to}} struggle with his knee injury. The Flames quickly signed Tanguay to a three-year contract worth US$15.75 million.|$|E
5|$|Although the U.S. {{administration}} has denied that devaluing their currency {{was part of}} their objectives for implementing quantitative easing, the practice can act to devalue a country's currency in two indirect ways. Firstly, it can encourage speculators to bet that the currency will decline in value. Secondly, the large increase in the domestic money supply will lower domestic interest rates, often they will become much lower than interest rates in countries not practising quantitative easing. This creates the conditions for a carry trade, where market participants can engage in a form of arbitrage, borrowing in the currency of the country practising quantitative easing, and lending {{in a country with}} a relatively high rate of interest. Because they are effectively selling the currency being used for quantitative easing on the international markets, this can increase the supply of the currency and hence push down its value. By October 2010 <b>expectations</b> <b>in</b> the markets were high that the United States, UK, and Japan would soon embark on a second round of QE, with the prospects for the Eurozone to join them less certain.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 2011–12 season, Westley signed a three-year {{contract}} extension at Stevenage that kept him contracted to the club until 2014. Westley acquired five players on free transfers, while also releasing five of the existing squad. Stevenage started their first ever League One campaign well, beating the 2010–11 League One play-off semi-finalists, Bournemouth, 3–1 at Dean Court to secure their first victory of the season on 16 August 2011. Stevenage were exceeding <b>expectations</b> <b>in</b> the third tier of English football, sitting just outside the play-off places after securing a notable 5–1 victory against Sheffield Wednesday Broadhall Way in September 2011. The club also inflicted Charlton Athletic's first league defeat of the season after a 1–0 win against the league leaders. The victory against Charlton was to spark a 13-game unbeaten run for Westley's Stevenage, and a 6–1 away victory at Colchester United on Boxing Day 2011 meant the club were sat in sixth place, the final play-off position. After managing Stevenage for three-and-a-half years, Westley left Stevenage in January 2012, joining fellow League One side Preston North End. His final game as manager of Stevenage was a 1–0 away victory at Reading in the FA Cup Third Round.|$|E

5|$|Columbus also traded {{former first}} round draft pick Nikita Filatov to the Ottawa Senators for a third-round {{pick in the}} 2011 Draft. Filatov had {{failed to live up}} to <b>expectations</b> <b>in</b> Columbus, playing in only 44 games over three seasons scoring six goals. Prior to the start of the season, the Blue Jackets were {{questioned}} for not signing a veteran back-up to starting goaltender Steve Mason, as the former Calder Memorial Trophy winner had struggled in consecutive seasons. The Blue Jackets signed Mark Dekanich as the back-up who had only 50 minutes of NHL experience prior to the start of the season. Columbus did sign a veteran Curtis Sanford to be their third string goaltender and to start for their American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Springfield Falcons. Sanford had not played in the NHL since 2009. During training camp, Dekanich suffered a high ankle sprain that was expected to keep him out of the line-up for a month. Additionally, Sanford suffered a groin injury, leaving Allen York as the back-up. York had only played four professional games, all in the AHL, entering the season.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the last}} week of {{regularly}} scheduled conference games, both teams moved up in the national college football polls. Florida State, which had been ranked No.22 in the BCS Poll, No.22 in the AP Poll, and No.21 in the Coaches' Poll, rose to No.21 in the BCS, No.20 in the AP Poll, and No.20 in the Coaches' Poll. Virginia Tech, which had been ranked 16th in the BCS, 13th in the AP Poll and 14th in the Coaches' Poll before the final week of the regular season, climbed to 15th in the BCS, 11th in the AP Poll and 11th in the Coaches' Poll. Spread bettors predicted Virginia Tech would win the game. Various betting organizations favored the Hokies by four or 4.5points. The matchup was a repeat of the inaugural ACC Championship game, and according to observers, the Seminoles' presence appeared to mark a resurgence for Florida State, which performed below <b>expectations</b> <b>in</b> the final years of Bowden's tenure. For Virginia Tech, there were hopes of breaking a trend of losing to Florida State. Virginia Tech head coach Frank Beamer was 1–8 against Florida State, and the Hokies overall were 11–22–1 against the Seminoles.|$|E
5|$|In Borissik Svetlana v. Urban Redevelopment Authority (2009), the {{applicant}} {{and her husband}} owned a semi-detached house which they wished to redevelop. In 2002, the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) had issued a circular imposing certain restrictions on the redevelopment of semi-detached houses. The URA rejected {{the applicant}}'s redevelopment application {{on the basis of}} the circular. Counsel for the applicant argued before the High Court that the applicant had a legitimate expectation that the proposal to redevelop the house would be approved. The Court held that the URA had not acted in a way that could have led the applicant to have such a legitimate expectation. It adopted four conditions set out in De Smith's Judicial Review (6th ed., 2007) to determine whether a legitimate expectation has been created: the public body's representation must be clear, unambiguous and devoid of any relevant qualification; induced by the conduct of the decision-maker; made by a person with actual or ostensible authority; and applicable to the applicant, who belongs to the class of persons to whom the representation is reasonably expected to apply. The only legitimate expectation that could have arisen after the 2002 circular had been issued was that the URA would act in accordance with those guidelines unless the circumstances were such that an exception has to be made. The applicant in Borissik argued that she had a legitimate expectation to a substantive right, but since the Court decided that the URA had made no clear representation to her, it did not make any pronouncements on the approach that should be taken towards substantive legitimate <b>expectations</b> <b>in</b> Singapore.|$|E
