By February 1999, Siemens had <b>given</b> <b>up</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> fix the locomotives, although they had established that the main fault lay in the generators. The issue never reached the courts. On 5 May 1999, the companies announcement that they had reached an agreement for the trains to be returned to Siemens, and NOK485 million be compensated to NSB. This was in addition to NOK80 million which had already been given as discount. In addition to the purchase price, the compensation included interest and coverage for NSB's extra expenses. The locomotives were immediately dismounted of NSB-owned equipment and on 20May sent by ship to Hamburg.|$|E

By 2033, {{most of the}} little {{remaining}} water is held in reserve by Kesslee (Malcolm McDowell) and his Water & Power (W) corporation, which controls the population by monopolising the water supply. Rebecca Buck – [...] "Tank Girl" [...] (Lori Petty) – {{is a member of}} a commune in the Australian outback that operates the last water well not controlled by the corporation. In an attack on the commune, W troops kill Tank Girl's boyfriend, Richard (Brian Wimmer), and capture Tank Girl and her young friend Sam (Stacy Linn Ramsower). Rather than killing her, Kesslee enslaves and tortures the defiant Tank Girl. Jet Girl (Naomi Watts), a talented but introverted jet mechanic who has <b>given</b> <b>up</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> escape W, urges Tank Girl to make less trouble for their captors, though Tank Girl refuses. Among other forms of torture, W personnel push her down into a long pipe to induce claustrophobia.|$|E

500|$|Azerrad {{asserted}} in his 1993 biography [...] {{that the}} music of In Utero showcased divergent sensibilities of abrasiveness and accessibility that reflected the upheavals Cobain experienced prior to the album's completion. [...] He wrote, [...] "The Beatlesque 'Dumb' happily coexists beside the all-out frenzied punk graffiti of 'Milk It,' while 'All Apologies' is worlds away from the apoplectic 'Scentless Apprentice.' [...] It's as if [...] has <b>given</b> <b>up</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> meld his punk and pop instincts into one harmonious whole. [...] Forget it. [...] This is war." [...] Cobain believed, however, that In Utero was not [...] "any harsher or any more emotional" [...] than any of Nirvana's previous records. [...] Novoselic concurred with Azerrad's comments that the album's music leaned more towards the band's [...] "arty, aggressive side"; the bassist said, [...] "There's always been [...] songs like 'About a Girl' and there's always been songs like 'Paper Cuts'... Nevermind came out kind of 'About a Girl'-y and this [...] came out more 'Paper Cuts'". [...] Cobain cited the track [...] "Milk It" [...] {{as an example of}} the more experimental and aggressive direction in which the band's music had been moving in the months prior to the sessions at Pachyderm Studio. [...] Novoselic viewed the album's singles [...] "Heart-Shaped Box" [...] and [...] "All Apologies" [...] as [...] "gateways" [...] to the more abrasive sound of the rest of the album, telling journalist Jim DeRogatis that once listeners played the record, they would discover [...] "this aggressive wild sound, a true alternative record".|$|E
