40|$|A simple, robust, sensitive, and {{selective}} liquid chromatography method {{suitable for the}} determination of the semi-synthetic antibiotic, <b>josamycin</b> <b>propionate,</b> and related substances is described. This method utilizes XTerra RP 18 5 mum (25 cm x 4. 6 mm ID) as a stationary phase at 30 degreesC and acetonitrile - 0. 2 M ammonium acetate (pH 6. 0) water (51 : 3 : 46, v/v/v) as a mobile phase, delivered at 1. 0 mL/min. UV detection is performed at 232 nm. <b>Josamycin</b> <b>propionate</b> is completely separated from the seven related substances of known identity and from at least seven unknown impurities, present in commercial samples. The robustness of the method was evaluated by a full-factorial experimental design. The LOQ for <b>josamycin</b> <b>propionate</b> was 0. 03 % and the LOD was 0. 01 %. For most samples the analysis time is 90 min. Exceptionally, very strongly retained impurities may require an isocratic analysis time of 160 min. In that case, time can be saved by using gradient elution, which needs an analysis time of almost 100 min. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Coupled liquid {{chromatography}} and ion trap mass spectrometry (LC/MS) {{was used for}} the characterization of the semi-synthetic 16 -membered ring macrolide <b>josamycin</b> <b>propionate.</b> On-line identification of impurities in this antibiotic complex was performed with an ion trap mass spectrometer without recourse to time-consuming isolation and purification procedures. Ion trap mass spectrometry is ideally suited to identification of impurities because it provides MSn capability, enabling multiple stages of mass spectrometry to obtain the maximum amount of structural information for a given molecule. The ion trap was used with an electrospray ionization source operated in the positive ion mode or with an atmospheric pressure chemical ionization source operated in the negative ion mode. The identity of the unknown compounds was deduced using the MS/MS and MSn collision-induced dissociation spectra of reference substances or structural analogs as interpretative templates, combined with knowledge about the nature of functional group fragmentation behavior. Given the importance attached to the identification of impurities of unknown identity in pharmaceutical substances, this study is useful for companies producing <b>josamycin</b> <b>propionate.</b> The knowledge of the fragmentation behavior is also of importance in further research on other 16 -membered macrolides. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|An isocratic liquid chromatographic {{method is}} {{described}} using as stationary phase the very stable poly(styrene-divinylbenzene) PLRP-S (8 mu m, 1000 Angstrom). The mobile phase was acetonitrile- 0. 2 M phosphate buffer, pH 10. 0 -water (52 : 20 :up to 100, v/v/v), delivered at a flow-rate of 1. 0 ml/min. UV detection was performed at 232 nm. The column was heated at 60 degrees C. <b>Josamycin</b> <b>propionate</b> {{was separated from}} all impurities which were present in commercial samples. The main impurities were josamycin, leucomycin A 4 propionate, josamycin 2 ', 9 -dipropionate, josamycin 3 ", 9 -dipropionate and platenomycin Al propionate. Full factorial design was applied to evaluate the robustness of the method. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved. status: publishe...|$|E
