5|$|The notch {{separates}} the Presidential Range, which forms the western wall, from the Wildcat Range, which forms the eastern wall. Two rivers <b>drain</b> <b>the</b> notch; the Ellis River drains {{the south end}} and is {{a tributary of the}} Saco, and the Peabody River drains the north end and is a tributary of the Androscoggin.|$|E
5|$|At E3 2012, Nintendo {{introduced}} the Wii U launch title Nintendo Land, which hosts Luigi's Ghost Mansion, a multiplayer minigame based on Luigi's Mansion. In this minigame, four players controlling Miis {{dressed up as}} Mario, Luigi, Wario and Waluigi have to <b>drain</b> <b>the</b> energy of a ghost, while the GamePad player, controlling the ghost, must make all the other players faint before time runs out.|$|E
25|$|Most of the county's {{borders are}} rivers. <b>The</b> Pequannock River <b>drains</b> <b>the</b> {{northern}} boundary area. <b>The</b> Pompton River <b>drains</b> <b>the</b> eastern section. The Passaic River also <b>drains</b> <b>the</b> eastern border area. The western border is <b>drained</b> by <b>the</b> Musconetcong River.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> lymph <b>drained</b> from <b>the</b> bladder {{begins in}} a series of {{networks}} throughout the mucosal, muscular and serosal layers. These then form three sets of vessels: one set near <b>the</b> trigone <b>draining</b> <b>the</b> bottom of the bladder; one set <b>draining</b> <b>the</b> top of the bladder; and another set <b>draining</b> <b>the</b> outer undersurface of the bladder. The majority of these vessels <b>drain</b> into <b>the</b> external iliac lymph nodes.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Mun River <b>drains</b> <b>the</b> southwestern {{portion of}} the district, Morna River <b>drains</b> <b>the</b> midsouth {{portion of the}} district, while <b>the</b> {{southeast}} is <b>drained</b> by <b>the</b> Katepurna River and Uma River.|$|R
5|$|Collins and his {{partners}} brought in slaves from Africa to dig a canal from Lake Phelps to the Scuppernong River. The canal served two purposes: first, {{as a means of}} transporting goods and people to and from the plantation; and second, it served as a massive drainage ditch as the slaves of Somerset Place worked to <b>drain</b> <b>the</b> surrounding swamps. Later, the canal system was expanded to provide irrigation for the rice and corn fields of the plantation.|$|E
5|$|During his 1904campaign to {{be elected}} governor, Napoleon Bonaparte Broward promised to <b>drain</b> <b>the</b> Everglades, and his later {{projects}} were more effective than Disston's. Broward's promises sparked a land boom facilitated by blatant errors in an engineer's report, pressure from real estate developers, and the burgeoning tourist industry throughout south Florida. The increased population brought hunters who went unchecked and had a devastating impact on the numbers of wading birds (hunted for their plumes), alligators, and other Everglades animals.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{completion}} of the dam, the entrances to the two outer diversion tunnels were sealed at the opening and halfway through the tunnels with large concrete plugs. The downstream halves of the tunnels following the inner plugs are now the main bodies of the spillway tunnels. The inner diversion tunnels were plugged at approximately one-third of their length, beyond which they now carry steel pipes connecting the intake towers to the power plant and outlet works. The inner tunnels' outlets are equipped with gates that can be closed to <b>drain</b> <b>the</b> tunnels for maintenance.|$|E
50|$|According to the USGS, variant names include Hushpuckaman Creek. <b>The</b> Hushpuckena River <b>drains</b> <b>the</b> northwestern {{part of the}} Sunflower River Basin, Quiver River <b>drains</b> <b>the</b> northeastern portion, and Bogue Phalia <b>drains</b> <b>the</b> west central {{portion of}} the watershed, all of which lies in the Mississippi River {{alluvium}} soil of the Yazoo Delta.|$|R
50|$|In females, <b>the</b> pampiniform plexus <b>drains</b> <b>the</b> ovaries. <b>The</b> right ovary <b>drains</b> from <b>the</b> plexus to the ovarian vein {{and then}} to the {{inferior}} vena cava. However, <b>the</b> left ovary <b>drains</b> from <b>the</b> plexus to the left ovarian vein, and from there <b>drains</b> to <b>the</b> left renal vein before emptying into the inferior vena cava.|$|R
50|$|The Geba River, {{along with}} <b>the</b> Corubal River, <b>drains</b> <b>the</b> Bafatá Plateau. It also <b>drains</b> <b>the</b> Gabú Plain, {{along with the}} Farim River (also known as the Cacheu River), and their tributaries.|$|R
5|$|In 1941 the Oval {{was bombed}} in the Belfast blitz, {{destroying}} both grandstands and leaving a crater in the pitch. As a result, {{the ground was}} flooded repeatedly by the Connswater River; the water pumps were insufficient to <b>drain</b> <b>the</b> pitch. Grosvenor Park {{was used as a}} temporary home for Glentoran, until August 1949. In 1953 the main grandstand was built.|$|E
5|$|In {{an attempt}} to drain Holland Fen, and prevent {{flooding}} from the River Witham, an adventurer called Earl Fitzwilliam constructed a drain in 1720, which runs broadly parallel to the River Witham, and terminated at Lodewick's Gowt, a sluice which he constructed on the Witham close {{to the location of}} the present Grand Sluice. The drain was for many years called Earl Fitzwilliam's drain, but is now called the North Forty-Foot <b>Drain.</b> <b>The</b> scheme was not entirely successful.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the early}} 19th century the Everglades {{have been a}} subject of {{interest}} for agricultural development. The first attempt to <b>drain</b> <b>the</b> Everglades occurred in 1882 when a Pennsylvania land developer named Hamilton Disston constructed the first canals. Though these attempts were largely unsuccessful, Disston's purchase of land spurred tourism and real estate development of the state. The political motivations of Governor Napoleon Bonaparte Broward resulted in more successful attempts at canal construction between 1906 and 1920. Recently reclaimed wetlands were used for cultivating sugarcane and vegetables, while urban development began in the Everglades.|$|E
50|$|While in Arizona <b>the</b> Sacramento Wash <b>drains</b> <b>the</b> Sacramento Valley {{southwest}} of Kingman, in Nevada <b>the</b> Piute Wash <b>drains</b> <b>the</b> Piute Valley of southeast Nevada. A separate drainage lies between {{them on the}} Colorado River, the Havasu-Mohave Lakes Drainage. These three drainages, the west, center, and east all <b>drain</b> into <b>the</b> Mohave Valley region.|$|R
30|$|Cauvery River <b>drained</b> <b>the</b> major {{parts of}} the Karur {{district}}. Amaravathi, Kodavanar, and Nanganji are <b>the</b> chief rivers <b>draining</b> <b>the</b> western region of the district and Pungar River <b>drains</b> in <b>the</b> eastern region of the district. The drainage pattern, generally, is dendritic. Except river Cauvery, all the rivers are seasonal and bring substantial flows during the monsoon time (Ahamed and Loganathan 2012).|$|R
50|$|The river flows {{south and}} then east to its {{confluence}} with the Whitewater River {{in the western}} Coachella Valley. It <b>drains</b> <b>the</b> land east of the San Gorgonio Pass, while the South Fork of the Santa Ana River <b>drains</b> <b>the</b> land west.|$|R
5|$|The English Great Horse was valued {{during the}} reign of Henry VIII, when stallions {{measuring}} less than 'fifteen handfuls' could not be kept, but the increasing role of gunpowder brought an end to the use of heavy horses in battle. Oliver Cromwell's cavalry favoured lighter, faster mounts and the big horses began to be used for draught work instead. During the 16th century, Dutch engineers brought Friesian horses with them when they came to England to <b>drain</b> <b>the</b> fens, and these horses probably had a significant influence on what became the Shire breed.|$|E
5|$|The {{coronary}} sinus {{is a large}} vein that drains {{into the}} right atrium, and receives most of the venous drainage of the heart. It receives blood from the great cardiac vein (receiving the left atrium and both ventricles), the posterior cardiac vein (draining {{the back of the}} left ventricle), the middle cardiac vein (draining the bottom of the left and right ventricles), and small cardiac veins. The anterior cardiac veins <b>drain</b> <b>the</b> front of the right ventricle and drain directly into the right atrium.|$|E
5|$|Bateman was {{referring}} to Longdendale, and the upper valley of the River Etherow. The {{western side of the}} Peak District is drained by the Etherow, Goyt, and Tame which are tributaries of the River Mersey. The north east is drained by tributaries of the River Don. Of the tributaries of the River Trent, that <b>drain</b> <b>the</b> south and east, the River Derwent is the most prominent. It rises on Bleaklow just east of Glossop and flows through the Upper Derwent Valley where it is constrained by the Howden, Derwent and Ladybower Reservoirs. The River Noe and the River Wye are its tributaries. The River Manifold and River Dove, in the south west whose sources are on Axe Edge Moor flow into the Trent, while the River Dane flows into the River Weaver.|$|E
50|$|The palmar {{metacarpal}} veins (or volar metacarpal veins) <b>drains</b> <b>the</b> metacarpal {{region of}} <b>the</b> palm, eventually <b>draining</b> into <b>the</b> deep veins of the arm.|$|R
50|$|Laurel Creek, which <b>drains</b> <b>the</b> White Oak Sink area, {{joins the}} West Prong, which <b>drains</b> <b>the</b> area beneath Spence Field. The West Prong then joins the Middle Prong a mile {{east of the}} Townsend Wye at the {{junction}} of Tremont Road and Laurel Creek Road.|$|R
50|$|The supreme {{intercostal}} vein (highest intercostal vein) is a paired vein that <b>drains</b> <b>the</b> first intercostal {{space on}} its corresponding side. It usually <b>drains</b> into <b>the</b> brachiocephalic vein. It can also <b>drain</b> into <b>the</b> superior intercostal vein, or the vertebral vein of its corresponding side.|$|R
5|$|Cerebrospinal fluid is a clear, {{colourless}} {{transcellular fluid}} that circulates around {{the brain in}} the subarachnoid space, in the ventricular system, and in the central canal of the spinal cord. It also fills some gaps in the subarachnoid space, known as subarachnoid cisterns. The four ventricles, two lateral, a third, and a fourth ventricle, all contain choroid plexus that produces cerebrospinal fluid. The third ventricle lies in the midline and {{is connected to the}} lateral ventricles. A single duct, the cerebral aqueduct between the pons and the cerebellum, connects the third ventricle to the fourth ventricle. Three separate openings, the middle and two lateral apertures, <b>drain</b> <b>the</b> cerebrospinal fluid from the fourth ventricle to the cisterna magna one of the major cisterns. From here, cerebrospinal fluid circulates around the brain and spinal cord in the subarachnoid space, between the arachnoid mater and pia mater.|$|E
5|$|Dorset's diverse {{geography}} ensures it has {{an assortment}} of rivers, although a moderate annual rainfall coupled with rolling hills, means most are typically lowland in nature. Much of the county drains into three rivers, the Frome, Piddle and Stour which all flow to the sea in a south-easterly direction. The Frome and Piddle are chalk streams but the Stour, which rises in Wiltshire to the north, has its origins in clay soil. The River Avon, which flows mainly through Wiltshire and Hampshire, enters Dorset {{towards the end of}} its journey at Christchurch Harbour. The rivers Axe and Yeo, which principally <b>drain</b> <b>the</b> counties of Devon and Somerset respectively, have their sources in the north-west of the county. In the south-west, a number of small rivers run into the sea along the Dorset coastline; most notable of these are the Char, Brit, Bride and Wey.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{hurricane}} and the widespread destruction, {{the hurricane}} caused outbreaks of malaria, dengue, cholera, and various fever and respiratory illnesses. Ongoing flooding caused {{an outbreak of}} Leptospirosis, notably in Cortés Department. There were widespread food and water shortages, leaving villagers near-starvation. Damaged crops also prevented the export of cash crops, and exports decreased by 9.4% in 1999. Many of the people left homeless also became unemployed, and there were reductions in exports and economic growth. Officials set up shelters that housed 285,000people for about a month. In Tegucigalpa, where the Choluteca River was dammed by a landslide, a temporary lagoon filled with sewage persisted for about two months, until a crew from the United States Army Corps of Engineers and United States Geological Survey dug a channel to <b>drain</b> <b>the</b> water.|$|E
50|$|Almost all {{the rivers}} {{in the valley}} area are in the mature stage and {{therefore}} deposit their sediment load in the Loktak lake. <b>The</b> rivers <b>draining</b> <b>the</b> Manipur Hills are comparatively young, due to the hilly terrain through which they flow. These rivers are corrosive and assume turbulent form in the rainy season. Important rivers <b>draining</b> <b>the</b> western area include the Maku, Barak, Jiri, Irang and Leimatak. Rivers <b>draining</b> <b>the</b> {{eastern part of the}} state, the Yu River Basin, include the Chamu, Khunou and other short streams.|$|R

50|$|Little Tarkio Ditch - <b>The</b> ditch <b>drains</b> <b>the</b> {{water from}} the Squaw Creek National Wildlife Refuge and <b>drains</b> into <b>the</b> Missouri at {{approximately}} RM 485 (RK 781).|$|R
5|$|Following {{the course}} of the {{enlarged}} South Drain, a lock raised the level of the canal at Shapwick, while the Drain turned off to run parallel to the canal but to its north. The railway ran between the two waterways, crossing to {{the south side of the}} canal immediately after the single arched aqueduct and syphon over the South <b>Drain.</b> <b>The</b> remains of the three-arched aqueduct and syphon over the River Brue are still visible, near the old railway bridge, and from there the canal headed towards Glastonbury, passing the Ham Wall and Street Heath nature reserves and making a sharp right-hand turn just before its terminal basin, which was located near the old Glastonbury and Street railway station.|$|E
5|$|Hearing {{the shark}} has been lured into the pipe, Michael and Kay {{go down to}} repair the {{underwater}} tunnel, so the technicians can restore air pressure and <b>drain</b> <b>the</b> water. Calvin orders the pump {{to be shut down}} to suffocate the shark, but this act instead allows her to break free from the pipe and attack Michael and Kay, but they are saved by the dolphins. They make their way back to the control room, but the shark appears {{in front of the window}} and smashes through the glass, flooding the room and killing a technician. Michael notices FitzRoyce's corpse still in the shark's throat with a grenade, and uses a bent pole to pull its pin, triggering the grenade's explosion and killing the shark. In the aftermath, Mike and Kay celebrate with the dolphins, who survived their brush with the shark.|$|E
5|$|Humans {{have lived}} for {{thousands}} of years in or around the Everglades. Plans arose in 1882 to <b>drain</b> <b>the</b> wetlands and develop the land for agricultural and residential use. As the 20th century progressed, water flow from Lake Okeechobee was increasingly controlled and diverted to enable explosive growth of the South Florida metropolitan area. The park was established in 1934, to protect the quickly vanishing Everglades, and dedicated in 1947, as major canal building projects were initiated across South Florida. The ecosystems in Everglades National Park have suffered significantly from human activity, and restoration of the Everglades is a politically charged issue in South Florida.|$|E
