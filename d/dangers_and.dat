5|$|According to Tough, it is {{unlikely}} that the avoidance of immediate <b>dangers</b> <b>and</b> prevention of future catastrophes would be conducted through radio, as these tasks would demand constant surveillance and quick action. However, cultural cooperation might take place through radio or a space probe in the Solar System, as radio waves could be used to communicate information about advanced technologies and cultures to humanity.|$|E
5|$|According {{to later}} Jain texts, Mahavira's {{childhood}} name was Vardhamāna ("the one who grows"), {{because of the}} increased prosperity in the kingdom {{at the time of}} his birth. According to the Kalpasutras, he was called Mahavira ("the great hero") by the gods because he stood steadfast in the midst of <b>dangers</b> <b>and</b> fears, hardships and calamities. Mahavira is also called a Tirthankara.|$|E
5|$|The {{project has}} been {{supported}} by some public officials, and received some public funding, but received criticism for its financial ties to the Church of Scientology, for exposing rescue workers to potential medical <b>dangers,</b> <b>and</b> for discouraging their use of orthodox medicine.

50|$|Scorpion {{was imprisoned}} in a State Prison {{where he was}} part of a chain gang with Dr. <b>Danger</b> <b>and</b> Bull Barton. When Kid Colt ended up in the same prison after turning himself over to the law. Scorpion, Dr. <b>Danger,</b> <b>and</b> Bull Barton decided that this was the {{opportunity}} for revenge. One day, they attacked Kid Colt in unison while on work detail. When a prison guard intervened, they took his gun, overpowered the guard, and broke their chains. Then they grazed Kid Colt with another bullet and fled. Across the border, Scorpion, Dr. <b>Danger,</b> <b>and</b> Bull Barton came across a town where Fred Yates (the man that Kid Colt turned himself over to) lived. When Scorpion, Dr. <b>Danger,</b> <b>and</b> Bull Barton confronted Fred Yates and his sister Susan, Fred fled in sheer terror. Kid Colt caught up to the trio, disarmed them, and saved Susan. Kid Colt then sent Scorpion, Dr. <b>Danger,</b> <b>and</b> Bull Barton back over the border to the waiting arms of the law.|$|R

40|$|This article {{presents}} the results of a survey of one hundred fifty six students enrolled in two major state universities. The survey was based on the model developed by Luce and Merrell (1995). The survey assessed students’ perceptions of the level of <b>danger</b> <b>and</b> addictive potential {{associated with the use of}} alcohol, cocaine, heroin, marijuana, and tobacco. Students consistently overestimated the <b>danger</b> <b>and</b> addictive potential of illicit drugs, <b>and</b> underestimated the <b>danger</b> <b>and</b> addictive potential of alcohol and tobacco. Student perceptions are compared with realistic assessments of <b>danger</b> levels <b>and</b> addictive potentials of drugs. Implications of these inaccuracies, as well as implications for changes in drug education, are discussed...|$|R
5|$|Bunnies & Burrows has the {{advantage}} of offering players an intuitive grasp of relative <b>dangers</b> <b>and</b> appropriate actions not possible in game worlds that are substantially fictional. For example, a player is told their character is confronted with a fox. There is an immediate intuition on the amount of peril a rabbit is facing. Although player characters are substantially weaker than many of the dangers they face, the game {{is one of the first}} to encourage problem solving and outwitting obstacles, rather than out-fighting them.|$|E

During the interview he gave his views on the <b>dangers</b> <b>and</b> thrills of night fighter operations.|$|E
5|$|After the {{departure}} of Bligh's launch, Christian turned Bounty eastward {{in search of a}} remote haven on which he and the mutineers could settle. He had in mind the island of Tubuai, 300miles south of Tahiti, partly mapped by Cook. Christian intended to pick up women, male servants and livestock from Tahiti, to help establish the settlement. As Bounty sailed slowly towards Tubuai, Bligh's launch, overcoming many <b>dangers</b> <b>and</b> hardships, made its way steadily towards civilisation and reached Coupang (now Kupang), on Timor, on 14 June 1789. Here Bligh gave his first report of the mutiny, while awaiting a ship to take him back to England.|$|E

5|$|More recently, habitat {{destruction}} and degradation {{have become the}} principal <b>dangers,</b> <b>and</b> a further reduction of 50% is expected in giant otter numbers within the 20 years after 2004 (about the span of three generations of giant otters). Typically, loggers first move into rainforest, clearing the vegetation along riverbanks. Farmers follow, creating depleted soil and disrupted habitats. As human activity expands, giant otter home ranges become increasingly isolated. Subadults leaving in search of new territory find it impossible to set up family groups. Specific threats from human industry include unsustainable mahogany logging {{in parts of the}} giant otter range, and concentrations of mercury in its diet of fish, a byproduct of gold mining. Water pollution from mining, fossil fuel extraction, and agriculture is a serious danger; concentrations of pesticides and other chemicals are magnified at each step in the food chain, and can poison top predators such as the giant otter.|$|E
5|$|The Negro Motorist Green Book (at times styled The Negro Motorist Green-Book or titled The Negro Travelers' Green Book) was {{an annual}} guidebook for African-American roadtrippers, {{commonly}} referred to simply as the Green Book. It was originated and published by New York City mailman Victor Hugo Green from 1936 to 1966, during the era of Jim Crow laws, when open and often legally prescribed discrimination against non-whites was widespread. Although pervasive racial discrimination and poverty limited black car ownership, the emerging African-American middle class bought automobiles {{as soon as they}} could, but faced a variety of <b>dangers</b> <b>and</b> inconveniences along the road, from refusal of food and lodging to arbitrary arrest. In response, Green wrote his guide to services and places relatively friendly to African-Americans, eventually expanding its coverage from the New York area to much of North America, as well as founding a travel agency.|$|E
5|$|The divine power seems {{originally}} to {{have designed}} Demosthenes and Cicero upon the same plan, giving them many similarities {{in their natural}} characters, as their passion for distinction and their love of liberty in civil life, and their want of courage in <b>dangers</b> <b>and</b> war, {{and at the same}} time also to have added many accidental resemblances. I think there can hardly be found two other orators, who, from small and obscure beginnings, became so great and mighty; who both contested with kings and tyrants; both lost their daughters, were driven out of their country, and returned with honor; who, flying from thence again, were both seized upon by their enemies, and at last ended their lives with the liberty of their countrymen.|$|E
