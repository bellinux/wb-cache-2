40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the feasibility of}} utilizing low-grade heat sources such as solar energy and waste heat from industrial processes for desalination. The premise of the approach is that saline waters can be desalinated by evaporation and condensation of fresh water at near-ambient temperatures at low pressures. Low pressures can be achieved naturally in the head space of water columns of height equal to the local barometric head. By connecting the head space of such a saline water column {{to that of a}} <b>distilled</b> water <b>column,</b> and by maintaining the temperature of the former about 15 - 20 degrees C above that of the latter, fresh water can be evaporated from the saline column and condensed in the <b>distilled</b> water <b>column.</b> In this study, it is proposed to use thermal energy storage (TES) system to heat the head space of the saline water column. The TES can be maintained at the desired temperature using solar energy and/or waste heat from thermal power plants, refrigeration plants or air conditioning units. This paper presents an integrated process model developed to evaluate the feasibility of combining solar energy with an absorption refrigeration system (ARS) to provide the energy to the TES. Results of this study show that the heat rejected by an existing ARS of cooling capacity of 3. 25 kW (~ 1 ton of refrigeration) is adequate to produce desalinated water at a rate of 5 kg/hr, with an additional energy input of 150 kJ/kg of desalinated water. The total solar panel area required for this application was 25 m 2. Performance curves and guidelines for preliminary design of such an integrated system are presented...|$|R

2500|$|<b>Column</b> <b>distilled</b> gin evolved {{following}} {{the invention of}} the Coffey still, and is produced by first distilling high proof (e.g. 96% ABV) neutral spirits from a fermented mash or wash using a refluxing still such as a column still. The fermentable base for this spirit may be derived from grain, sugar beets, grapes, potatoes, sugar cane, plain sugar, or any other material of agricultural origin. The highly concentrated spirit is then redistilled with juniper berries and other botanicals in a pot still. Most often, the botanicals are suspended in a [...] "gin basket" [...] positioned within the head of the still, which allows the hot alcoholic vapours to extract flavouring components from the botanical charge. This method yields a gin lighter in flavour than the older pot still method, and results in either a distilled gin or London dry gin, depending largely upon how the spirit is finished.|$|R

Delta- 3 -carene can be recovered from the crude turpentine produced by Kraft pulp mills in the Rocky Mountain region. Among the various catalysts investigated, Harshaw 1404 -T nickel catalyst was found to give the best results in a fixed bed flow tube reactor. The reaction conditions for maximum carane production {{in this study were}} found to be about 85 °C, 1200 psig, and. 025 hr^- 1 liquid hourly space velocity. Hydrogenation reactor product was <b>distilled</b> in a <b>column</b> with 40 theoretical stages at 28 : 1 reflux ratio to yield. 9 gallons of 92 % to 93 % carane per gallon of delta- 3 -carene charged to the process. Several methods of feed pretreatment to remove impurities which act as catalyst poisons were evaluated. Suspected poisons are sulfur, water, and auto-oxygenation products. The best pretreatment method appeared to be contacting the delta- 3 -carene with dilute caustic followed by steam evaporation under nitrogen and drying with CaSO 4 desicant.

40|$|Graduation date: 1984 Intensive {{cultivation}} of Walla Walla silt loams (coarse silty, mixed, mesic, typic Haploxeroll) in eastern Oregon and Washington {{during the past}} 50 years, has decreased internal soil drainage in the 15 to 40 cm layer. However, no measurements {{have been made to}} determine the causes and corrective management for this internal drainage problem. Gradual acidification of the plow layer, partially as a result of long-term use of nitrogen fertilizers in a summer-fallow management system may possibly have contributed to release of soil constituents that contribute to cementation of a high strength soil layer of variable thickness found at depths from 15 to 40 cm. Therefore, the potential for release, and possible interactions, of silicic acid, organic carbon, and major cations from the plow layer and subsequent movement through or desposition in layers below were evaluated. The test soils came from selected plots subjected to residue and nitrogen addition treatments for a period of 50 years. Samples were taken from the four upper 15 -cm layers of a Walla Walla silt loam, placed in a system of laboratory columns, and leached with <b>distilled</b> water. The <b>columns</b> were designed to simulate a leaching soil profile and to facilitate continuous collection of leachate for analysis. Results indicate that soluble silica concentrations in Walla Walla soils are high in comparison to soils of the United States found outside of the Pacific Northwest. When no silica enters a layer (the 0 to 15 -cm layer) silicic acid concentration in the leachate increases as original soil pH decreases. When the input fluid contained silicic acid, as in all layers below 15 cm, there was a smaller trend for increasing silicic acid concentration with decreasing soil pH.

40|$|The {{results of}} the macroinfaunal {{communities}} distributions from the annual series surveys PORCUPINE are shown. Those surveys were realized during the months of September and October in the years 2006, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013 by the Instituto Español de Oceanografía aboard the R /V Vizconde de Eza, within the research project ERDEM. This survey series has as main objective the obtainment of abundance indexes of the benthonic and demersal fauna from Porcupine Bank, west of Ireland, with special attention on the commercial species exploited by the Spanish fleet (hake, angler fish, megrim and norwegian lobster). For {{the study of the}} infaunal macrobenthos a total of 50 samples were analyzed from selected places of the Bank, where the bottom characteristics, the climatology or the survey schedule allowed. Samples were taken with an ULSNER box corer with 0. 09 m 2 of sampling area. Samples for the faunal study were sieved aboard with a 0. 5 mm mesh size sieve. The material collected in the sieve was preserved with 8 % formaldehyde neutralized with borax, and stained with Rose Bengal solution for the posterior sorting and identification of fauna. Additional samples were taken to estimate the organic content of the sediment and to perform the granulometric analyses. Once in the laboratory, the granulometry was analyzed following the method recommended by Buchanan (1984); which consists in a combination of dry sieving of the coarse fraction (> 62 µm) and the sedimentation at 20 ºC of the fine fraction (< 62 µm) in a <b>distilled</b> water <b>column.</b> Sediment organic matter content was calculated as the percentage of weight loss by means of 24 hours sample calcination at 500 ºC, after dried it at 100 ºC during the same time. Complementary, in order to obtain a better coverage of the sedimentary types from the study area, more than 350 samples were collected with a net collector coupled to the trawling fishing gear (Baca-GAV 39 / 52). Globally, the sediments {{of the majority of the}} sampled stations are mainly formed by sand, between fine and very fine, except in deep areas of the southeast, where there are large muddy areas with elevated organic content and high selection coefficient. In the north, around the shallowest area, we found thicker sandy sediments, with lower organic content and moderate selection. The macroinfaunal communities from the Porcupine Bank are characterized by the dominance of the faunistic group of polychaetes (68. 8 %), mainly represented by the families Owenidae, Spionidae, Paraonidae and Sabellidae. The next in number are the group of molluscs (17. 6 %), dominated by the family Kelliellidae, which reaches maximum abundances up to 7520 ind•m- 2. The poorest represented groups are the crustaceans (5. 0 %), echinoderms (4. 3 %) and the “others” (sipunculids, nemertine, etc.), being the latter the least abundant (3. 7 %). In relation with the spatial distribution four macroinfaunal groups were indentified in the Porcupine Bank: -	Group 1 : located in intermediate depth areas, over sandy sediments with low organic content. The infaunal community is dominated by polychaetes from the Owenidae family, mainly represented by the specie Galathowenia oculata. -	Group 2 : occupies the sandy and low organic content sediments from the shallowest area of the Bank. Polychaetes are the most representative faunistic group, highlighting the dominance of the families Spionidae and Paraonidae. Prionospio fallax and Aricidea wassi are the most representative species of the group. -	Group 3 : situated in two deep areas in the south area of the Bank with muddy and high organic matter content sediments. It has the lowest infaunal abundance of the study, being dominated by the bivalve molluscs from the family Kelliellidae and by the annelids polychaetes from the family Paraonidae. -	Group 4 : Is the cluster that includes more stations in throughout the study. It is distributed spatially in the south area of the Bank, in different bathymetries, with the most heterogeneous sediments and moderate organic content. The bivalve molluscs from the Kelliellidae family again become dominant, with Kelliella miliaris reaching abundance over 7500 ind•m- 2. IE...|$|R
