25|$|For women, {{the skirt}} suit or <b>dress</b> <b>suit</b> are both acceptable; a blouse, {{which can be}} white or {{coloured}}, usually {{takes the place of}} a shirt.

25|$|One type of music, {{based on}} Shlomo Carlebach's, {{is very popular}} among Orthodox artists and their listeners. This type of music usually {{consists}} of the same formulaic mix. This mix is usually brass, horns and strings. These songs are composed from within one pool of composers and one pool of arrangers. Many of the entertainers are former yeshiva students, and perform dressed in a <b>dress</b> <b>suit.</b> Many have day jobs and sideline singing at Jewish weddings. Others moonlight in kollel study or at Jewish organizations. Some have no formal musical education, and sing mainly pre-arranged songs.|$|E
500|$|Millionaire socialite Henry J. [...] "Bob" [...] Topping Jr. (1948–1952). A {{brother of}} New York Yankees owner Dan Topping and a {{grandson}} of tin-plate magnate Daniel G. Reid, Topping proposed to Turner at the 21 Club in Los Angeles by dropping a diamond ring into her martini. The ceremony occurred {{three days after}} Topping was divorced from his third wife, actress Arline Judge, who had been previously married to his brother Dan. Although worth millions when they married, Topping suffered heavy financial losses due to poor investments and excessive gambling. The couple's marriage resulted in a church trial for the officiant because the marriage took place {{less than a year}} after Topping's divorce from Judge. Cheryl Crane writes in her memoir that her mother's wedding to Bob Topping was a beautiful, lavish affair held in the spacious Topping family mansion in Greenwich, Connecticut, with all of the bells and whistles accompanying a traditional wedding. Despite the fact that both the bride and the groom had been married and divorced multiple times previously, Lana wore a traditional white gown, the bridesmaids wore equally beautiful gowns of Lana's choosing, and young Cheryl served as the flower girl. Crane goes on to state that she later saw this as her mother's attempt to finally have a beautiful, traditional wedding while she was still young after three failed marriages (to Artie Shaw and Steve Crane) in which the ceremonies took place before justices of the peace with Lana usually attired in a simple <b>dress</b> <b>suit</b> and heels.|$|E

Perhaps this resulted from the cavernous Annex, which felt more like a barn than a typical theatrical space. <b>Dress</b> <b>Suits</b> thrives on the suffocating and empowering nature of intimacy, both between its two characters and with the audience. Thus, the La MaMa production may have been most successful as a revival rather than as an isolated show. <b>Dress</b> <b>Suits</b> to Hire allowed the audience to revisit and contrast the value of lesbian performance art against a vastly different historical moment. What remained most provocative was seeing {{what used to be a}} hotly debated, boundary-pushing piece now revisited as a seminal work of performance art."
