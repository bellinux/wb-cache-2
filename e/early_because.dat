5|$|In 2017, the Series again drew criticism, {{this time}} for {{allowing}} games to be called <b>early</b> <b>because</b> of weather and treating them as official games. After the Yokohama BayStars lost a 5-inning game in the 2017 Central League Climax Series, Coskrey wrote that playoff games should never end like in that manner. He suggested that NPB could have easily suspended the game and resumed where it left off {{the next day or}} even postponed the game entirely until the next day.|$|E
5|$|Another riot {{occurred}} in August 1992 at Montreal's Olympic Stadium, during a co-headlining tour with Metallica. Prior to Guns N' Roses' appearance, Metallica's set {{was cut short}} after singer-guitarist James Hetfield suffered second-degree burns in a pyrotechnics accident. However, Guns N' Roses was unable to go on stage <b>early,</b> <b>because</b> Rose once again was late arriving at the venue. Nearly an hour into their show, Rose complained of voice problems before walking off stage, following which a riot erupted in downtown Montreal, resulting in an estimated $400,000 in damages. In November of that year, Rose was convicted of property damage and assault {{in relation to the}} Riverport riot; he was fined $50,000 and received two years' probation.|$|E

25|$|The {{second day}} ended <b>early</b> <b>because</b> of rain. After the early loss of Hunte, Nurse and Kanhai took the score to 108-2, with Kanhai {{by far the}} more aggressive, having scored 70 runs to his partner's 35.|$|E
25|$|In 1961 Tom Simpson {{became the}} first British winner in a {{controversial}} two-man sprint against Italian Nino Defilippis. Defilippis was the faster sprinter, but stopped pedalling too <b>early</b> <b>because</b> a finishing banner had been blown away and was foiled by Simpson.|$|E
50|$|During the 1948 war, nearby Mughr al-Khayt {{was struck}} by mortars on 2 May, while villages to the north were {{evacuated}} <b>earlier</b> <b>because</b> {{of the threat of}} the oncoming war.|$|R

25|$|In 2000, all of {{the eastern}} jurisdictions that {{normally}} observe DST – New South Wales, Victoria, the ACT, and Tasmania – began DST <b>early</b> <b>because</b> of the Summer Olympic Games held in Sydney. These jurisdictions moved to DST on 27 August 2000. South Australians did not change their clocks until the usual date, which was 29 October 2000.|$|E
25|$|In 1608, {{sponsored}} by Henry IV, Pierre Dugua, Sieur de Mons and Samuel de Champlain founded {{the city of}} Quebec with 28 men, the second permanent French settlement in the colony of Canada. Colonization was slow and difficult. Many settlers died <b>early</b> <b>because</b> of harsh weather and diseases. In 1630, there were only 103 colonists living in the settlement, but by 1640, the population had reached 355.|$|E
25|$|In 1996 Great Britain {{embarked}} on a disastrous tour of the Southern Hemisphere under coach Phil Larder. They did not play Australia because of the Super League War, but played and won their first and so far only test against Fiji, before losing a series 3–0 to New Zealand. Several British players had to be sent home <b>early</b> <b>because</b> the tour ran out of money.|$|E
50|$|Twenty new ELIRGs, {{including}} the most luminous galaxy found to date, have been discovered. These galaxies {{were not found}} <b>earlier</b> <b>because</b> of their distance, and because dust converts their visible light into infrared light.|$|R

25|$|Australia then flew to Antigua for {{the first}} one-day {{international}}. Australia won the toss and elected to field. Jeff Thomson was no-balled six times in the first over. The match was notable for Desmond Haynes' international debut, scoring 148 runs. Gary Cosier scored 84 off 78 balls in Australia's response, but they lost through inferior run rate. The game was called off <b>early</b> <b>because</b> of time taking up due to fast bowlers' run ups.|$|E
25|$|Kōichi and Shige pay {{for their}} parents' stay at a hot spring spa at Atami, but the parents return <b>early</b> <b>because</b> the nightlife at the hotel {{interrupts}} their sleep. When they return, Shige explains that she sent them to Atami {{because she wanted to}} use their bedroom for a meeting. Tomi goes to stay with Noriko, whose husband, her son, died eight years ago in the war. Tomi advises Noriko to remarry. Shūkichi, meanwhile, gets drunk with some old friends, then returns to Shige's salon.|$|E
25|$|As most {{nutrient}} supplements feed {{all living}} microorganism in the must (whether desirable or not), winemakers will often wait {{to add the}} nutrients until {{they are ready to}} inoculate the must with their desired S. cerevisiae strain. Producers who are using wild ferments may also wait until after sulfur dioxide additions have killed off unwanted microbes or feed <b>early</b> <b>because</b> they would like the potential complexity that other microbes could add to the wine. When added, the nitrogen is usually in the form of amino acids, combined with vitamins and minerals to help kick start the fermentation.|$|E
50|$|Working with Mao-Xi Zhang he is {{reported}} {{as having been}} the first to make octanitrocubane in 2000 or <b>earlier.</b> <b>Because</b> of its high density and highly strained C-C bonds octanitrocubane is a very powerful high explosive.|$|R
50|$|IAF had disbanded the 220 Squadron <b>earlier</b> <b>because</b> of {{very old}} aircraft, but resurrected {{that with the}} {{induction}} of the SU 30 MKIs on 25 September 2012. They received the President's standards at Halwara AFS on 20 September 2013.|$|R
50|$|Having {{been unable}} to race in Italy two weeks <b>earlier</b> <b>because</b> of a one-race ban he {{received}} for causing a serious collision in Belgium, Romain Grosjean {{was back in the}} driving seat again with Lotus F1 for the race in Singapore.|$|R
25|$|In 2001, {{the city}} {{sponsored}} SharkByte, {{an exhibit of}} decorated sharks, based on the mascot of the hockey team, the San Jose Sharks, and modeled after Chicago's display of decorated cows. Large models of sharks were decorated {{in a variety of}} clever, colorful, or creative ways by local artists and were then displayed for months at dozens of locations around the city. Many displays were removed <b>early</b> <b>because</b> of vandalism. After the exhibition, the sharks were auctioned off and the proceeds donated to charity. The sharks can still be found in their new owners' homes and businesses.|$|E
25|$|Physical {{effects were}} also created cheaply. Instead of using {{expensive}} rain towers, the rain {{featured in the}} film’s climactic scenes was created simply using hoses and unheated water. This meant that one night of production had to be wrapped three hours <b>early</b> <b>because</b> lead actor Andy Whitfield became hypothermic: his temperature dropped to 32.5 degrees Celsius (90.5 degrees Fahrenheit). Abbess described this as the hardest scene to shoot. Initially intending to make Gabriel without CGI effects, Abbess also tried to reproduce bullet time on a low budget by using giant props on strings, though he eventually decided computer generated effects were more successful.|$|E
25|$|Fassbinder {{used his}} {{theatrical}} {{work as a}} springboard for making films; {{and many of the}} Anti-Theater actors and crew worked with him throughout his entire career (for instance, he made 20 films each with actresses Hanna Schygulla and Irm Herrmann). He was strongly influenced by Brecht's Verfremdungseffekt (alienation effect) and the French New Wave cinema, particularly the works of Jean-Luc Godard. Fassbinder developed his rapid working methods <b>early.</b> <b>Because</b> he knew his actors and technicians so well, Fassbinder was able to complete as many as four or five films per year on extremely low budgets. This allowed him to compete successfully for the government grants needed to continue making films.|$|E
50|$|Three years <b>earlier,</b> <b>because</b> of the {{clashes between}} absolutists and liberals, {{the town hall}} of Tabeirós moved from Cereixo {{to the site of}} A Estrada, formed by four houses at a {{crossroads}} between the parishes of Figueroa, Ouzande and Guimarei.|$|R
50|$|The codex {{was written}} in the West, {{possibly}} in the St. Gallen monastery, by an Irish monk in the 9th century. It can not be dated <b>earlier,</b> <b>because</b> it has a reference to the (heretical) opinions of Gottschalk at Luke 13:24, John 12:40.|$|R
50|$|This {{left only}} Mount Pleasant and Swansea before Woodsdale and Ross {{reformed}} - Woodsdale had previously went into recess from the Association {{a few years}} <b>earlier</b> <b>because</b> of their inability to field a reserve side, however there is currently no reserve grade competition.|$|R
25|$|Early {{announcements}} send signals {{not only}} to customers and the media, but also to providers of support products, regulatory agencies, financial analysts, investors, and other parties. For example, an early announcement can relay information to vendors, letting them know to prepare marketing and shelf space. It can signal third-party developers to begin work on their own products, {{and it can be}} used to persuade a company's investors that they are actively developing new, profitable ideas. When IBM announced its Professional Workstation computer in 1986, they noted the lack of third-party programs written for it at the time, signaling those developers to start preparing. Microsoft usually announces information about its operating systems <b>early</b> <b>because</b> third-party developers are dependent on that information to develop their own products.|$|E
25|$|Harris and Klebold were {{eventually}} released from diversion several weeks <b>early</b> <b>because</b> of positive {{actions in the}} program; they were both on probation. Shortly after Harris' and Klebold's court hearing, Harris's online blog disappeared. His website was reverted to its original purpose of posting user-created levels of Doom. Harris began to write in a journal, in which he recorded his thoughts and plans. In April 1998, {{as part of his}} diversion program, Harris wrote a letter of apology to the owner of the van. However, around the same time, he furiously derided him in his journal, stating that he believed himself {{to have the right to}} steal something if he wanted to. Harris continued his scheduled meetings with his psychologist until a few months before he and Klebold committed the Columbine High School massacre.|$|E
25|$|Caspar René Gregory {{published}} another cataloging {{system in}} 1908 in Die griechischen Handschriften des Neuen Testaments, {{which is the}} system still in use today. Gregory divided the manuscripts into four groupings: papyri, uncials, minuscules, and lectionaries. This division is partially arbitrary. The first grouping {{is based on the}} physical material (papyrus) used in the manuscripts. The second two divisions are based on script: uncial and minuscule. The last grouping is based on content: lectionary. Most of the papyrus manuscripts and the lectionaries before the year 1000 are written in uncial script. There is some consistency in {{that the majority of the}} papyri are very <b>early</b> <b>because</b> parchment began to replace papyrus in the 4th century (although the latest papyri dates to the 8th century). Similarly, the majority of the uncials date to before the 11th century, and the majority of the minuscules to after.|$|E
2500|$|The Rabbis {{taught that}} [...] {{directed}} counting the Levites [...] "from a month old and upward" [...] and not <b>earlier</b> <b>because</b> they considered a newborn infant {{not to be}} definitely viable, but a child who had lived a month was definitely known to be viable.|$|R
50|$|A {{school bus}} was {{reported}} to have slid off the road early on January 7 as the storm caused impacts. No injuries were reported. Schools were also let out <b>earlier</b> <b>because</b> of the deteriorating conditions. By 9:30 a.m, there was about 53 reported crashes.|$|R
50|$|Emmotum {{was named}} by Desvaux and Hamilton (1783-1856) in 1825. George Bentham {{described}} the genus Pogopetalum in 1841, but John Miers recognized {{that it was}} the same as Emmotum, described <b>earlier.</b> <b>Because</b> the <b>earlier</b> name has priority, Pogopetalum is no longer a correct name.|$|R
