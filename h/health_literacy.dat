25|$|<b>Health</b> <b>literacy.</b> This {{is where}} {{patients}} have problems obtaining, processing, and understanding basic health information. For example, {{patients with a}} poor understanding of good health may not know when {{it is necessary to}} seek care for certain symptoms. While problems with <b>health</b> <b>literacy</b> are not limited to minority groups, the problem can be more pronounced in these groups than in whites due to socioeconomic and educational factors. A study conducted in Mdantsane, South Africa depicts the correlation of maternal education and the antenatal visits for pregnancy. As patients have a greater education, they tend to use maternal health care services more than those with a lesser maternal education background.|$|E

25|$|Another study {{examining}} {{the health and}} nutrition literacy status of residents of the lower Mississippi Delta found that 52 percent of participants had a high likelihood of limited literacy skills. While a precise comparison between the NAAL and Delta studies is difficult, primarily because of methodological differences, Zoellner et al. suggest that <b>health</b> <b>literacy</b> rates in the Mississippi Delta region {{are different from the}} U.S. general population and that they help establish the scope of the problem of <b>health</b> <b>literacy</b> among adults in the Delta region. For example, only 12 percent of study participants identified the My Pyramid graphic two years after it had been launched by the USDA. The study also found significant relationships between nutrition literacy and income level and nutrition literacy and educational attainment further delineating priorities for the region.|$|E

25|$|There is some {{evidence}} that claims of Medigap’s tendency to cause over-treatment may be exaggerated and that potential savings from restricting it might be smaller than expected. Meanwhile, there are some concerns about the potential effects on enrollees. Individuals who face high charges with every episode of care have been shown to delay or forgo needed care, jeopardizing their health and possibly increasing their health care costs down the line. Given their lack of medical training, most patients tend to have difficulty distinguishing between necessary and unnecessary treatments. The problem could be exaggerated among the Medicare population, which has low levels of <b>health</b> <b>literacy.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{findings}} of the 2003 National Assessment of Adult Literacy (NAAL) provide a basis upon which to frame the nutrition literacy problem in the U.S. NAAL introduced the first ever measure of [...] "the degree to which individuals {{have the capacity to}} obtain, process and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions"– an objective of Healthy People 2010 and of which nutrition literacy might be considered an important subset. On a scale of below basic, basic, intermediate and proficient, NAAL found 13 percent of adult Americans have proficient <b>health</b> <b>literacy,</b> 44% have intermediate literacy, 29 percent have basic literacy and 14 percent have below basic <b>health</b> <b>literacy.</b> The study found that <b>health</b> <b>literacy</b> increases with education and people living below the level of poverty have lower <b>health</b> <b>literacy</b> than those above it.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Public {{libraries}} {{are primarily}} established {{to meet the}} information needs of citizen at all levels. Obviously, one of such needs is health information. However, information poverty is so rampant in Nigeria consequent upon which people awareness about their health is low. This study therefore investigated <b>health</b> information <b>literacy</b> {{as a predictor of}} community information service utilization in public and national libraries in south western Nigeria. The descriptive research design was adopted. Simple random technique was used to distribute questionnaires to 40 respondents in each of 6 public and 4 national libraries in south western Nigeria. The total sample size was therefore 400. One questionnaire namely: <b>Health</b> Information <b>Literacy</b> and Community Information Service Utilization Questionnaire (HILCISUQ) (r = 0. 88) was used. Findings revealed that <b>health</b> information <b>literacy</b> (r = 0. 078) positively, and jointly predicted community information service utilization in public and national libraries of south western Nigeria. Besides, <b>health</b> information <b>literacy</b> was low (= 1. 57). It was recommended that citizens should be educated on the need to be literate in respect of health information...|$|R

[...] The World Product Center would have hosted trade shows and other events featuring medical device manufacturers, pharmaceutical companies, and healthcare associations to support healthcare commerce.

2500|$|Pay for {{performance}} programs often target patients with serious and complex illnesses; such patients commonly interact with multiple healthcare providers and facilities. However, pilot programs now underway focus on simple indicators such as improvement in lab values {{or use of}} emergency services, avoiding areas of complexity such as multiple complications or several treating specialists. A 2007 study analyzing Medicare beneficiaries' healthcare visits showed that a median of two primary care physicians and five specialists provide care for a single patient. The authors doubt that pay-for-performance systems can accurately attribute responsibility for the outcome of care for such patients. The American College of Physicians Ethics has stated concerns about using a limited set of clinical practice parameters to assess quality, [...] "especially if payment for good performance is grafted onto the current payment system, which does not reward robust comprehensive care...The elderly patient with multiple chronic conditions is especially vulnerable to this unwanted effect of powerful incentives." [...] Present pay-for-performance systems measure good performance based on specified clinical measurements, such as glycohemoglobin for diabetic patients. Healthcare providers who are monitored by such limited criteria have a powerful incentive to deselect (dismiss or refuse to accept) patients whose outcome measures fall below the quality standard and therefore worsen the provider's assessment. Patients with low <b>health</b> <b>literacy,</b> inadequate financial resources to afford expensive medications or treatments, and ethnic groups traditionally subject to healthcare inequities may also be deselected by providers seeking improved performance measures.|$|E

40|$|Although Massachusetts {{currently}} {{has the highest}} rate of health insurance coverage in the nation, reports suggest health care consumers do not fully understand how their insurance works. Thus, the insured and uninsured populations alike need ongoing support in order to develop <b>health</b> insurance <b>literacy,</b> defined as the degree to which individuals obtain, process, and understand information about health insurance in order to make informed decisions about choosing and using their coverage, which in turn can lead to positive health outcomes. Educating consumers and giving them tools and resources are strategies that advance <b>health</b> insurance <b>literacy.</b> Since 2001, the Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts Foundation (the Foundation) has awarded over 5 million to community health centers and community-based organizations throughout Massachusetts, through its Connecting Consumers with Care (CCC) grant program, to conduct outreach, provide education and help consumers enroll in health insurance and access primary care. In 2015, the Foundation focused its CCC grant activities to improve <b>health</b> insurance <b>literacy</b> and engage consumers to utilize the health care system more effectively.

50|$|<b>Health</b> <b>literacy</b> is {{the ability}} to obtain, read, understand, and use {{healthcare}} information in order to make appropriate health decisions and follow instructions for treatment. There are multiple definitions of <b>health</b> <b>literacy,</b> in part, because <b>health</b> <b>literacy</b> involves both the context (or setting) in which <b>health</b> <b>literacy</b> demands are made (e.g., health care, media, internet or fitness facility) and the skills that people bring to that situation (Rudd, Moeykens, & Colton, 1999). Studies reveal that only 12 percent of the adults in the U.S. have proficient <b>health</b> <b>literacy.</b> This means 77 million adults have basic or below basic <b>health</b> <b>literacy.</b> These individuals have difficulty with common health tasks including reading the label of a prescribed drug.
