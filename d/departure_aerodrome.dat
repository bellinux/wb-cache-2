50|$|The {{point of}} no return, {{sometimes}} referred to as the PNR, is the point on a flight at which a plane has just enough fuel, plus any mandatory reserve, to return to the airfield from which it departed. Beyond this point that option is closed, and the plane must proceed to some other destination. Alternatively, with respect to a large region without airfields, e.g. an ocean, it can mean the point before which it is closer to turn around and after which it is closer to continue. Similarly, the Equal time point, referred to as the ETP (also Critical point(CP)), is the point in the flight where it would take the same time to continue flying straight, or track back to the <b>departure</b> <b>aerodrome.</b> The ETP is not dependent on fuel, but wind, giving a change in ground speed out from, and back to the <b>departure</b> <b>aerodrome.</b> In Nil wind conditions, the ETP is located halfway between the two aerodromes, but in reality it is shifted depending on the windspeed and direction.|$|E
50|$|Unlike in the United States, {{even for}} VFR flights, pilots are {{required}} to file a flight plan or have a flight itinerary with a responsible person for any flight greater than 25 nm from the <b>departure</b> <b>aerodrome.</b> Also, in Canada, flight plans are opened automatically at the estimated time of departure (ETD). Flight information centres play a prominent role managing flight plans, collecting position reports from pilots en route, and initiating commsearch procedures to locate pilots who have not closed flight plans.|$|E

Also in 2016, Cork Airport became the first Irish airport to launch a no drone zone within 5km of the airfield. The campaign was launched following a number of incidents involving drones or aircraft on approach or <b>departure</b> from <b>aerodromes</b> throughout Europe. Despite this campaign, at least two drones encroached airspace during April 2017.|$|R
