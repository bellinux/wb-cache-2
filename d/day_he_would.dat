5|$|Louis XVIII chose many centrist cabinets, as {{he wanted}} to appease the populace, much {{to the dismay of}} his brother, the ultra-royalist Count of Artois. Louis always dreaded the <b>day</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> die, believing that his brother, and heir, Artois, would abandon the centrist {{government}} for an ultra-royalist autocracy, which would not bring favourable results.|$|E

In a typical <b>day</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> wake at 7am, paint from around 9 or 10am until 4pm, after which {{he would have a}} meal. Following the meal he would take a walk, and attend life classes between 6 and 8pm. On returning home he would drink two cups of tea, and go to bed at midnight.|$|E

5|$|By 22:00, the Rangers and ex-POWs {{arrived at}} Plateros, where they rested {{for half an}} hour. A radio message was sent and {{received}} by Sixth Army at 23:00 that the mission had been a success, {{and that they were}} returning with the rescued prisoners to American lines. After a headcount, it was discovered that POW Edwin Rose, a deaf British soldier, was missing. Mucci dictated that none of the Rangers could be spared to search for him, so he sent several guerrillas {{to do so in the}} morning. It was later learned that Rose had fallen asleep in the latrine before the attack. Rose woke early the next morning, and realized the other prisoners were gone and that he was left behind. Nevertheless, he took the time to shave and put on his best clothes that he had been saving for the <b>day</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be rescued. He walked out of the prison camp, thinking that he would soon be found and led to freedom. Sure enough, Rose was found by passing guerrillas. Arrangements were made for a tank destroyer unit to pick him up and transport him to a hospital.|$|E

His family moved to Regina, Saskatchewan when he was 18 months old, before {{settling}} in Victoria, British Columbia. He therefore holds British as well as Canadian citizenship. Before the family settled in Canada, his father played professional soccer {{in various parts of}} the world. Nash often played soccer and ice hockey with his younger brother Martin, and did not start playing basketball until he was 12 or 13 years old. In grade eight, however, he told his mother that one <b>day</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> play in the NBA and would become a star. He was neighbour to future NHL stars Russ and Geoff Courtnall, who used to babysit him and played soccer coached by Nash's father.|$|E
25|$|Although Tucker {{was one of}} {{the most}} well-respected legal thinkers of his <b>day,</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> never be {{appointed}} to the Supreme Court of the United States - quite possibly because there were already two Virginians (John Marshall and Bushrod Washington) serving there at the time.|$|E

50|$|By the Convention of London, {{signed on}} 15 July 1840, the Great Powers offered Muhammad Ali and his heirs {{permanent}} control over Egypt, Sudan, and the Eyalet of Acre, provided that these territories would nominally remain {{part of the}} Ottoman Empire. If he did not accept the withdrawal of his forces within ten <b>days,</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> lose the offer in southern Syrian; if he delayed acceptance more than 20 <b>days,</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> forfeit everything offered. The European powers agreed to use all possible means of persuasion to effect the agreement, but Muhammad Ali hesitated, believing in support from the Kingdom of France.|$|R
25|$|Crosby {{would spend}} hours sunbathing naked atop the mill's turret. Contrary to fashion of the <b>day,</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not wear a hat.

He would frequently drop in at Drosso where he would smoke opium. He would stay {{away from home for}} days.|$|E
25|$|Gabriel was devotedly in love, but {{he could}} not marry his {{mistress}} because the Romanov's family status forbade any morganatic union. He appealed to his aunt, Olga, Queen of the Hellenes, to intercede on his behalf, and she went to see Nicholas II requesting permission for his nephew to marry, but the emperor flatly refused. Through the twists and turns of the years that followed, Prince Gabriel remained passionate in his devotion to the dancer, determined that one <b>day</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> overcome the obstacles and marry her.|$|E

25|$|In 1969, {{at the age}} of 50, he made a life-changing {{decision}} and entered the Community of the Resurrection. It had been thought that one <b>day</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be made a bishop, but his earlier breakdown and now his entering religious life, ended any possibility of entering the episcopate. After more than two years as a postulant, he took his religious vows and officially became a monk on 1 January 1972. Having been the Dean of Trinity College when Prince Charles studied there, he was invited to the wedding of Charles and Diana in 1981. Williams composed and read one of the prayers used in the service.|$|E
25|$|Lee's {{offensive}} {{plan for}} June 27 {{was similar to}} that of the preceding <b>day.</b> <b>He</b> <b>would</b> use A.P. Hill's and Longstreet's divisions to pressure Porter's corps as it withdrew, while Stonewall Jackson, augmented by D.H. Hill (Jackson's brother-in-law), hit Porter's right and rear. The combined effort of all of Lee's force was destined to be the largest Confederate attack of the war, about 57,000 men in six divisions. Lee traveled to Walnut Grove Church to meet with Jackson and describe the plan, which called for Jackson to march toward Old Cold Harbor, and then south beyond Porter's flank. Unfortunately, Lee made incorrect assumptions about Porter's disposition. He assumed that the V Corps would defend the line of Powhite Creek, somewhat to the west of Porter's actual location.|$|E

25|$|Dale Malloy (Todd Stashwick) – Dale is {{cousin to}} Dahlia. He and Wayne were raised like {{brothers}} in the Malloy clan. Within the code of the family Dale expected that one <b>day</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> marry Dahlia and take his rightful place {{as head of the}} family once his father, Earl, died. A borderline sociopath whose life becomes slowly unhinged. Feeling wronged many times over by Wayne he is hell bent on revenge against Wayne and his family. Feeling the pain of his unrequited love and the fact that his father was going to pass the reins of the clan on to Wayne, Dale goes to murderous lengths to protect his legacy. Eventually discovering the Riches' secret, he now finds himself in an unholy alliance with Wayne, leveraging the truth to his selfish needs.|$|E
25|$|Throughout his cricket career, {{which lasted}} from 1948 until the 1977 season, Close {{was one of}} the most charismatic and {{well-known}} cricketers. He scored almost 35,000runs as a batsman, including 52centuries with a highest innings score of 198. He also took 1,168wickets as a bowler, over 800catches as a fielder and one stumping, as a stand-in wicket-keeper. At just over six feet (1.83 m) tall he was a noticeable presence on the field, often fielding at the short leg position, close to the batsman. As cricketers did not use head or body protection in Close's <b>day,</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> often get hurt when a batsman struck a ball that hit him. Close was also noted, as a batsman, for standing up to intimidatory bowling, letting the ball hit his unprotected torso rather than flinching.|$|E
25|$|Even {{when not}} under indictment, he {{prepared}} for inevitable charges (knowing the FBI was watching him). Almost every <b>day</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> return from his residence to his mother's apartment at 225 Sullivan Street in Greenwich Village and emerge {{dressed in a}} bathrobe and pajamas or a windbreaker and shabby trousers. Accompanied by one or two bodyguards, he crossed {{the street to the}} Triangle Civic Improvement Association — a dingy storefront club that served as his headquarters — where he played pinochle and held whispered conversations with his associates. Regular visitors to the Triangle included senior Genovese caporegimes Liborio Bellomo, John Ardito, Tino Fiumara, Ernest Muscarella and Daniel Leo. From Gigante's 1990 indictment and after his incarceration (in La Tuna, Texas) these men ran the crime family, with all major choices authorized by Gigante from his prison cell.|$|E

25|$|Following {{the tracks}} of Sínulhḵay̓, Xwechtáal could not follow its trail {{directly}} because of the power and energy emitted by the serpent wherever it slithered. Seeing where the trail lead, {{he came to the}} rock face of the Stawamus Chief Mountain. Xwechtáal saw the serpent's path as it went straight up the face of the cliff, leaving a black line of destruction. The man continued through the mountain pass, following the serpent from lake to lake, and creek to creek. While following the serpent, Xwechtáal would train spiritually by taking morning baths in the creeks, lakes and rivers to cleanse himself and become stronger. Day by <b>day,</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> sacrifice more of himself, eating a bit less, and sleeping with less blankets and clothes. All of this was part of his training to kill the serpent.|$|E
25|$|In {{its heyday}} of the 1930s through the 1950s, CCNY became known for its {{political}} radicalism. It was said that the old CCNY cafeteria {{in the basement of}} Shepard Hall, particularly in alcove 1, was {{the only place in the}} world where a fair debate between Trotskyists and Stalinists could take place. Being part of a political debate that began in the morning in alcove 1, Irving Howe reported that after some time had passed he would leave his place among the arguing students in order to attend class. When he returned to the cafeteria late in the <b>day,</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> find that the same debate had continued but with an entirely different cast of students. Alumni who were at City College in the mid-20th century said that City College in those days made the famously radicalism three decades later at the University of California at Berkeley in the 1960s look like a school of conformity.|$|E
25|$|His grandmother, {{originally}} from Yokohama, Japan, first introduced Jero to Enka {{and it was}} under her guidance that he grew to love the genre as a child. Jero, who majored in information technology at the University of Pittsburgh, did not initially imagine himself in a career as an Enka singer. Rather, after he permanently moved to Japan, his main forms of employment were as an English teacher at NOVA and as a computer engineer. He only began to actively work towards becoming an Enka singer because he had promised his grandmother that one <b>day</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> someday perform at the annual Kohaku Uta Gassen song show. As a result, he actively participated in numerous singing contests while he continued {{to work as a}} computer engineer and eventually achieved real success after only two months since he had arrived in Japan. His grandmother never was able to see her grandson achieve Enka fame, she died in 2005, three years before he became famous.|$|E
