25|$|Torishima {{is a fan}} {{of video}} games and was {{therefore}} put in charge of the first video game-related articles in Weekly Shōnen Jump, for which he brought in Yuji Horii to help. When his manager told him to <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>why</b> CoroCoro Comic was doing so well, Torishima determined {{it was because of the}} sealed pages that had to be cut opened and included cheats and tips for video games. In addition to including similar pages in Jump, they also began to rate games, something new at the time, with the resulting content being voted third in the magazine's reader polls. This was the birth of , the video game section of Weekly Shōnen Jump issues. After finding success with video game articles and wanting to show readers of Jump how one is developed, the magazine decided to develop their own role-playing game like Ultima so that they would have exclusive coverage of it. He decided to have Horii, who had begun working at Enix, write the scenario and Toriyama design the characters. Torishima claimed that he purposefully had Enix fully fund the game, intentionally keeping Shueisha out of the decision making process for the good of the product while still reserving the option to create a manga based on it and not pay any royalties. The video game was Dragon Quest.|$|E

500|$|Somewhat surprisingly, Clinton {{faced an}} erosion of support from women voters during her campaign, with her numbers declining {{throughout}} 1999. [...] This was partly a typical pattern seen with women candidates where they have an early surge of female support, which then wears off, and it was partly due to her early campaign stumbles. [...] But it also reflected the particular set of mixed feelings that women had towards Clinton's marriage and the ambition and the power she derived from it. [...] The problem was especially acute among some female demographics; one of her longtime advisers later said, [...] "Women in the educated professional class? They fucking couldn't stand her.

[...] The Village Voices Sean Fennessey {{said that}} it is [...] "not the flashiest or most forward-thinking song on the album, but certainly the most earthbound. And therefore the most important." [...] Chicago Sun-Times writer Thomas Conner complimented Rock's [...] "hilarious, X-rated spiel" [...] and cited the song as the best example of West's ability [...] "to contrast the light and dark pieces against each other, the profane and the sacred", writing that it utilizes [...] "Legend's soft, pretty voice to sing a smooth, troubling refrain." [...] Rolling Stone writer Rob Sheffield called it one of the funniest of West's career, a [...] "confessional" [...] song where he [...] "honestly struggles to <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>why</b> he has to be such a douchebag." [...] Steve Jones of USA Today cited the song as the album's pièce de résistance that [...] "plays out with growing hostility over John Legend's moody piano work." [...] Nitsuh Abebe of New York mused that the song successfully showcased a [...] "gloomy and elegiac" [...] presentation.|$|E

The stakes were huge and the heroes faced the greatest of hazards. The use of the oil rig created a sense of isolation for Mulder and Doggett, and the paranoia levels were sky-high. We still can't <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>why</b> we haven't seen more episodes along the lines of Vienen during the past three seasons." [...] Jessica Morgan from Television Without Pity awarded the episode a [...] "B–". Tom Kessenich, in his book Examinations, gave Vienen a positive review, and wrote, [...] "after watching 'Vienen', I can honestly say that for once of the few times this season, it felt good to be an X-Files fan again". Kessenich praised the significant development in Mulder and Scully's relationship and the return of the [...] "fourth season version" [...] of the black oil; the 1998 movie had dramatically altered the nature of the substanceinfected hosts gestate aliens inside their bodies rather than merely being taken over.|$|E

[...] "Someday We'll Know" [...] lyrically explores numerous mysteries throughout history, including Amelia Earheart's disappearance, with the lyrics [...] "Whatever happened to Amelia Earhart? Who holds the stars up in the sky?" [...] The song also centers on Alexander's trying to <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>why</b> his partner left him. [...] "I Hope I Didn't Just Give Away the Ending" [...] includes improvisation and only a piano and percussion {{for the first two}} minutes, and was noted in Song Means: Analysing and Interpreting Recorded Popular Song as [...] "strangely unfocused," [...] also noting that at the 3:18 point of the song, Alexander [...] "steps out of character" [...] with the lyric [...] "This may not be true, but I said it so you'd feel involved with the song;" [...] Spin commented that the song contains [...] "rangy slurs." ...|$|E
500|$|The group took a {{hands-on}} {{approach to the}} actual recording sessions for Phantom Power, engineering and producing themselves for the first time. Recording largely took place at AV Happenings {{during the second half}} of 2002, with the band working through the night so as not to disturb staff who worked in other parts of the building during the day. According to bassist Guto Pryce this involved a fair amount of trial and error as the band [...] "didn't really know what [...] were doing". Soundproof booths were improvised by setting up tents in the office corridors: [...] "we'd record a guitar and it'd sound rubbish and we had to <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>why.</b> So we started experimenting with different tent designs. In the end it was the wigwam that was easiest to put up and sounded best". The band had to take these booths down before office workers arrived in the morning, a process that guitarist Huw Bunford has described as [...] "ghosts in the night ... a bit clandestine". A brief two-week session with Gorwel Owen at Rockfield Studios saw some of the album's more [...] "straight ahead" [...] tracks recorded with live vocals before the band returned to AV Happenings and [...] "messed around" [...] with them. When the album was almost finished the band enlisted the services of Tony Doogan who engineered sessions during which several vocal parts were recorded.|$|E

500|$|According {{to music}} {{journalist}} Jon Pareles, Songs of Innocence features U2 strictly playing rock music, particularly arena rock, whose elaborate production [...] "puts a higher gloss, {{and sometimes a}} heavier fuzz tone, on the band's instantly recognizable sound". Thematically, Songs of Innocence revisits the group members' youth in Ireland in the 1970s, touching on childhood memories, loves, and losses, while paying tribute to their musical inspirations. Bono described it as [...] "the most personal album we've written". In an interview with Gus Wenner of Rolling Stone, he said, [...] "Let's try to <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>why</b> {{we wanted to be}} in a band, the relationships around the band, our friendships, our lovers, our family. The whole album is first journeys—first journeys geographically, spiritually, sexually." [...] He said that he felt challenged to write about more personal themes and why he wanted to be in a rock band after producer Jimmy Iovine told him, [...] "The person you need to be to make the album that you wanna make {{is a long way from}} where you live." [...] Rolling Stone deemed Songs of Innocence as having the feeling of a concept album, a notion that Bono rejected, although he did opine it was lyrically cohesive in a way the group's other records were not. For the album, the group revisited adolescent musical influences, such as punk rock band Ramones and electronic music group Kraftwerk, for inspiration.|$|E

He claims she was merely exhausted and he was trying to make her comfortable. [...] She attempts to leave but decides to continue when The Smoking Man tells her she's free to go and that the choice of whether to accept his help or not is hers.

At dinner, The Smoking Man tells Scully that the cure he possesses is not just the cure for cancer, but for all human disease, and that it is extraterrestrial. The Smoking Man goes outside and tells the man who has been following them that Cobra has not shown. Scully finds a note under her dessert plate saying to meet at Calico Cove at dawn. She goes alone and is stopped by Cobra, who gives her a disc before being shot and killed by a sniper. The sniper also attempts to kill Scully, but is killed by The Smoking Man.|$|E
