25|$|A crucial {{bottleneck}} {{of methods}} that simulate linear algebra computations with the amplitudes of quantum states is state preparation, which often requires one to <b>initialise</b> a quantum {{system in a}} state whose amplitudes reflect {{the features of the}} entire dataset. Although efficient methods for state preparation are known for specific cases, this step easily hides the complexity of the task.|$|E
2500|$|Mailer {{software}} {{was responsible for}} transferring files and messages between systems, as well as passing control to other applications, such as the BBS software, at appropriate times. [...] The mailer would initially answer the phone and, if necessary, deal with incoming mail via FidoNet transfer protocols. [...] If the mailer answered the phone and a human caller was detected rather than other mailer software, the mailer would exit, and pass control to the BBS software, which would then <b>initialise</b> for interaction with the user. [...] When outgoing mail was waiting on the local system, the mailer software would attempt to send it {{from time to time}} by dialing and connecting to other systems who would accept and route the mail further. [...] Due to the costs of toll calls which often varied between peak and off-peak times, mailer software would usually allow its operator to configure the optimal times in which to attempt to send mail to other systems.|$|E

50|$|In any case, {{even when}} a {{variable}} is implicitly <b>initialised</b> to a default value like 0, this is typically not the correct value. <b>Initialised</b> does not mean correct if the value is a default one. (However, default initialisation to 0 is a right practice for pointers and arrays of pointers, since it makes them invalid before they are actually <b>initialised</b> to their correct value.) In C, variables with static storage duration that are not initialized explicitly are initialized to zero (or null, for pointers).|$|R
