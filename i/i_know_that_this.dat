5|$|I've {{never had}} chills through my entire body like I had from hearing Beyoncé sing this song. 'I Was Here' came from my soul {{and became the}} song that was coming from hers. In all my life, I have never heard {{anything}} as amazing as this. Hearing her sing 'I Was Here' will forever {{be one of the}} best moments of my life, and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> song will touch many other lives as well.|$|E
500|$|Despite having {{plans for}} a tour of Europe to promote Spiderland, Slint broke up in November 1990, after Brian McMahan decided to quit the band. Members of the band went on to join other musical projects, {{including}} Tortoise, The Breeders, Palace and The For Carnation. Slint reunited briefly in 2005 for an eighteen-date tour. Pajo said, [...] "We don't {{want to be a}} reunion band that keeps reuniting.... <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> is going to be it." [...] However, in 2007 Slint reunited again for a tour featuring performances of Spiderland in its entirety as part of All Tomorrow's Parties' [...] "Don't Look Back" [...] concert series celebrating classic albums.Spiderland | News | nme.com |date=March 23, 2007 |work=nme.com |accessdate=October 14, 2012}} The tour included appearances at the 2007 Pitchfork Music Festival and Primavera Sound Festival. McMahan said in an interview at the Pitchfork Music Festival that performing the album live was [...] "pretty cool. It moves a little slower than it does on the record, but it's all there.... It took some getting used to, some revisiting the material and rehearsing." [...] In an August 2013 interview with Vish Khanna, former producer Steve Albini revealed that the band was working on remastering Spiderland with engineer Bob Weston.|$|E
2500|$|After Bush {{commuted}} Libby's sentence, Thompson {{released a}} statement: [...] "I am very happy for Scooter Libby. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> {{is a great}} relief to him, his wife and children. This will allow a good American, who {{has done a lot}} for his country, to resume his life." ...|$|E
60|$|I nodded, for <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> was so. Then, at some whispered {{word from}} Martina, Heliodore spoke.|$|R
60|$|Thus he wailed, {{then came}} the sound of sword blows and <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> prophet was dead also.|$|R
60|$|I {{forced a}} laugh. It rang hollow against the barrier that {{separated}} us. In my heart <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> barrier {{was not to}} be laughed away.|$|R
2500|$|I feel {{completely}} {{left out}} of the realm of everything that is so important to me. [...] And <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> is partly because punk rock is for and by boys mostly and partly because punk rock of this generation is coming of age in a time of mindless career-goal bands.|$|E
2500|$|Prime Minister David Cameron {{said he was}} [...] "delighted" [...] {{with the}} result, adding: [...] "it would have broken my heart to see our United Kingdom {{come to an end}} and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> {{sentiment}} was shared not just by people across our country but also around the world". While attending a public event with Michael Bloomberg later in September, Cameron told Bloomberg that the Queen had [...] "purred down the line" [...] when he informed her of the result. Cameron admitted he was [...] "very embarrassed" [...] for revealing the Queen's political view, which she had guarded in her own comments.|$|E
2500|$|The album's artwork is {{designed}} by Martin Kvamme, {{who has worked}} with A-ha on previous occasions, both as a band and on solo projects. Stian Andersen, Guy Berryman, Istockphoto and Helge Kvamme supplied photographs for the inner sleeve. Martin Kvamme said the following about the inspiration behind the cover art: [...] "In this case the title helped quite a lot. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> is a somehow poetic quote and that they are not necessarily talking about a mountain, but we wanted something majestic and simple. That's also why we made it quite abstract. It's a picture of the mountain Kyrkja (the church) in Jotunheimen, Norway. Inside we have more images of Norwegian nature (in a collage style). But in general I guess the inspiration comes from the overall idea (production and songwriting/lyrics), rather than the album title." ...|$|E
60|$|So I feared. A dreadful {{night was}} to pass before <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> {{was the day}} of the release of Sanders Webster, and that frail Nanny had walked into Tilliedrum to meet him at the prison gate.|$|R
60|$|Instantly <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> {{newcomer}} had bribed his way {{within the}} garden. Then {{he turned in}} the direction of the two women, and I saw that he was none other than Thurid, the black dator of the First Born.|$|R
6000|$|... "When I {{returned}} to the bedside of the young woman, I found her raving in precisely the same order of continuity. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> might last for many hours, {{and that it would}} probably end in the silence of the grave.|$|R
2500|$|... "You {{know that}} I have always {{considered}} that {{literature and the}} arts pursue an aim independent of morality. Beauty of conception and style is enough for me. But this book, whose title (Fleurs du mal) says everything, is clad, as you will see, in a cold and sinister beauty. It was created with rage and patience. Besides, the proof of its positive worth is in all the ill that they speak of it. The book enrages people. Moreover, since I was terrified myself of the horror that I should inspire, I cut out a third from the proofs. They deny me everything, the spirit of invention and even {{the knowledge of the}} French language. I don't care a rap about all these imbeciles, and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> book, with its virtues and its faults, will make its way in the memory of the lettered public, beside the best poems of V. Hugo, Th. Gautier and even Byron." ...|$|E
2500|$|... “It {{was during}} the last {{struggle}} of his people, {{at the time of}} the Messiah craze in 1890-1891 that American Horse demonstrated as never before the real greatness of the man. While many of his friends were carried away by the new thought, he held aloof from it and cautioned his band to do the same. When it developed into an extensive upheaval among the nations he took his positive stand against it. Presently all Indians who did not dance the Ghost Dance were ordered to come into camp at Pine Ridge Agency. [...] American Horse was the first to bring in his people. [...] I was there at the time and talked with him daily. When Little was arrested, it had been agreed among the disaffected to have him resist, which meant that he would be roughly handled. This was to be their excuse to attack the Indian police, which would probably lead to a general massacre or outbreak. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> desperate move was opposed from the beginning by American Horse, and it was believed that his life was threatened.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Others {{helped with}} {{providing}} information, including Asa Gray on American plants. Darwin wrote to Gray on 20 July 1857 saying that after 19 {{years of work}} {{on the question of}} whether species [...] "have descended from other species, like varieties from one species" [...] and [...] "that species arise like our domestic varieties with much extinction", he had [...] "come to the heteredox conclusion that there are no such things as independently created species – that species are only strongly defined varieties. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> will make you despise me. – I do not much underrate the many huge difficulties on this view, but yet it seems to me to explain too much, otherwise inexplicable, to be false." [...] An intrigued Gray admitted to his own notion that there was some law or power inherent in plants making varieties appear, and asked if Darwin was finding this law. Realising that Gray had not grasped what he was suggesting, Darwin sent him a letter on 5 September outlining the difficulties involved. He enclosed a brief but detailed abstract of his ideas on natural selection and divergence, copied out by the schoolmaster to make it more legible.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the liner}} notes to the 2001 reissue of The Hunter, {{producer}} Mike Chapman stated [...] "I <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> {{we were in}} a different and far less accessible artistic space. And that worried me. I could tell that things were different now, and <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> would be the last Blondie album." ...|$|R
6000|$|We parted rather hurriedly on the quay, {{each of us}} {{having his}} own {{pressing}} business to attend to. I {{would have been very}} much cut up had <b>I</b> <b>known</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> hurried grasp of the hand with [...] "So long, old boy. Good luck to you!" [...] was the last of our partings.|$|R
60|$|Then my spirits sank again, for <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> was possible. There is a path, steep but short, {{across the}} hills between Thrums {{and the top}} of the glen, which Mr. Glendinning took {{frequently}} when he had to preach at both places on the same Sabbath. It is still called the Minister's Road.|$|R
2500|$|... "At 12 noon on the {{eleventh}} {{day of the}} Fifth Month, my train from Hangchow arrived at the North Station Shanghai. In order to go quickly to the bank to send the money, I left my luggage at the depository and carried only a small bag with me. As soon as I {{came out of the}} train station, I saw a rather luxurious automobile and four Westerners standing by it. I did not realize that they were French, because in Shanghai there was a great mixture of Westerners and there were swarms of foreign visitors. It was quite common for cars to be used to pick up hotel guests. Little did <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> car was there to kidnap someone! When I had gone a few steps from the station, one of the Westerners {{came up to me and}} said in Mandarin: 'This car is very nice; please get in.' I politely refused, saying 'I do not need a car.' Suddenly, one of the Westerners behind the car with a great heave pushed me inside it, the engine accelerated and we were off like a shot. In no time we had already entered the French Concession. The car drew up to the waterfront, where a French warship was docked. I now became a prisoner on this warship." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It's {{little that}} I know, my dear,' cried Clemency, 'very little; but <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> should not be. Think {{of what you}} do!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do, Mademoiselle, and I know more. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> hinted {{conspiracy}} {{against your}} father is a trumped-up lie to lure you to the coppice." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{found it}} {{difficult}} to fit from laughing as the gestures of the Abbe, especially when I thought of my brother and how they would mock them; but <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> would be unpardonable bad taste, and as I had come in too late to have the clue to the discourse, I amused myself with looking about me.|$|R
60|$|And then {{suddenly}} I had the great idea. It {{came to me}} like a flash, I looked at her, crying there, and I looked over the rail at Charlie the Boy Wonder, and <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> was where <b>I</b> got a stranglehold on my place in the Hall of Fame, along with the great thinkers of the age.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{reserved}} it till now," [...] {{said the}} girl, [...] "for <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> being the second night, {{you would find}} it impossible to get to sleep at all without something in you, however small. If you manage to sleep on this and the cup of hot tea, you'll maybe rest well till morning--and then--" ...|$|R
60|$|THE GRAND DUCHESS. You promised everything. You swore anything. [She marches as if {{in front}} of a regiment.] <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> man alone can rouse the army to enthusiasm.|$|E
6000|$|... ‘Of course <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> {{has been}} in both our minds, Rosa, and of course I am in honour bound to confess freely {{that it does not}} {{originate}} with you.’ ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yea," [...] {{said the}} Prior, [...] "so thou hast told me ere now, but <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> knight is so poor {{that he will}} gladly sign away his lands for two hundred pounds of hard money." ...|$|E
60|$|At last I heard Ja {{shouting}} to {{the survivors}} in the dugouts--they were all {{quite close to}} us now--offer-ing them their lives if they would surrender. Perry was standing close behind Ja, and <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> merciful action was prompted, perhaps commanded, by the old man; for no Pellucidarian {{would have thought of}} showing leniency to a defeated foe.|$|R
60|$|I {{wanted the}} men of Helium to see me and to <b>know</b> <b>that</b> their beloved princess was here, too, for <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> {{knowledge}} would inspire them to even greater deeds of valor than they had performed in the past, though great indeed must have been those which won for them a way into the almost impregnable palace of the tyrant of the north.|$|R
60|$|I saw illimitable space peopled with shining suns, and sunk in the {{infinite}} void above them one vast Countenance {{clad in a}} calm so terrific that at its aspect my spirit sank to nothingness. Yes, and <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> was Destiny enthroned above the spheres. Those lips moved and obedient worlds rushed upon their course. They moved again and these rolling chariots of the heavens were turned or stayed, appeared or disappeared. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> also <b>that</b> against <b>this</b> calm Majesty the being, woman or spirit, at my side had dared to hurl her passion and her strength. My soul reeled. I was afraid.|$|R
6000|$|... "I can. I will be so, when <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> is settled. I do {{not wish}} to {{interfere}} with his fortune. There is my letter to his mother, and now I will go back to Stratton." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And how do <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> is {{not some}} infernal trap of yours? Tell me how you found out all this, or by Hercules (he had quite {{forgotten}} his Christianity by this time)--by Hercules and the Twelve Gods, I'll--' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Cease," [...] he answered, [...] "most beloved, I {{was weak}} and wandering, now <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> {{is not a}} dream, and I thank Caleb who has brought us {{together}} again, against his wish, I think. Say, what must I do?" ...|$|E
5000|$|Both Natalie and Emily were {{extremely}} different and very original, {{which is a}} rare thing nowadays. They avoid the obvious, and are capable of playing complex and conflicting attitudes. Above all, they had energy, which is key for a movie. When I brought them together for a workshop, I could see them feeding off of each other well, and <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> was going to work. Pawel Pawlikowski ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> remark {{applied to}} Grace's wish {{to dwell on}} the unknown future, and did not receive it as a reproach in any other sense. As she seemed calm, however, I was willing to indulge her wish to {{converse}} with me, so long as she dwelt on subjects that did not agitate her. Speaking of her hopes of heaven had a contrary effect, and I made no further opposition.|$|R
60|$|So <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> all <b>that</b> <b>this</b> young man, Parkins, {{was going}} to say, and all about his adventures before he began.|$|R
