5|$|As a character, Spencer {{has been}} seen as an everyman figure, his blank {{expression}} and plain dress keeping him a simple archetype. Spencer displays a pacifistic and fatalistic <b>inactivity</b> throughout the film, simply allowing events to unfold around him without taking control. This passive behavior culminates in his sole act of instigation at the film's climax; his apparent act of infanticide is driven by his life of being domineered and controlled. Spencer's <b>inactivity</b> has also been seen by film critics Colin Odell and Michelle Le Blanc as a precursor to Lynch's 1983–92 comic strip The Angriest Dog in the World.|$|E
5|$|The 1906 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season was the eleventh-deadliest Atlantic {{hurricane season}} in recorded history, with 381 deaths. The season was fairly active, with eleven storms, of which six became hurricanes and three became major hurricanes. The first storm of the season, {{a tropical storm}} in the northern Caribbean Sea, formed on June 8; although it struck the United States, no major impacts were recorded. July saw a period of <b>inactivity,</b> with no known storms. However, in August, the streak of <b>inactivity</b> ended with two storms, including a powerful hurricane. September brought three storms, including a deadly hurricane, with catastrophic impacts in Pensacola and Mobile. October included three storms, with a powerful hurricane that killed over 200 people. The final storm of the season impacted Cuba in early November and dissipated on November 9.|$|E
5|$|There {{can be no}} more {{complaints}} of <b>inactivity</b> of the government. The forward march movement into Virginia, indicated in my despatches last night, {{took place at the}} precise time this morning that I named, but in much more imposing and powerful numbers.|$|E
5|$|This mirrors {{tropical}} cyclone genesis near these features, as genesis clusters in 2–3weeks of activity followed by 2–3weeks of <b>inactivity.</b> Tropical cyclones can form in outbreaks around these features under special circumstances, tending {{to follow the}} next cyclone to its poleward and west.|$|E
5|$|After {{over three}} decades of <b>inactivity,</b> the Nice {{reformed}} in 2002 {{for a series of}} concerts. A three-CD set Vivacitas was released, with the third CD being an interview with Emerson, Jackson and Davison. Dave Kilminster guested on guitar at the concerts. Davison died on 15 April 2008 aged 65 in Horns Cross, Devon, from a brain tumour. Emerson died on 11 March 2016 in Santa Monica, California, of an apparently self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head.|$|E
5|$|Ants {{are active}} {{all year long}} in the tropics, but, in cooler regions, they survive the winter {{in a state of}} {{dormancy}} known as hibernation. The forms of <b>inactivity</b> are varied and some temperate species have larvae going into the inactive state (diapause), while in others, the adults alone pass the winter in a state of reduced activity.|$|E
5|$|At the {{latitude}} of Incapillo, the Nazca plate subducting beneath the South America plate abruptly shallows towards the south. This shallowing forms the limit between the volcanically active Central Volcanic Zone and the magmatically inactive Pampean flat slab region farther south. This magmatic <b>inactivity</b> occurs because the flat slab removes the asthenospheric wedge.|$|E
5|$|By February 1918, {{the crews}} of Sankt Georg {{and several other}} {{warships}} grew weary {{of the war and}} the long periods of <b>inactivity,</b> which led to the Cattaro Mutiny. The mutiny was quickly suppressed, but Sankt Georg and several other ships were subsequently decommissioned. Under the terms of the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, Sankt Georg was awarded as a war prize to Britain. In 1920, she was sold to Italian ship breakers and scrapped thereafter.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{statements}} from bandmembers, that Lamb of God planned {{to enter the}} studio in 2014 to begin recording their eighth studio album, hoping to complete it {{by the end of}} the same year, Chris Adler said in an interview with The Virginian-Pilot that besides the large amount legal fees the band encountered from Randy Blythe's trial, the band's <b>inactivity</b> during the trial meant no new income coming in, which eventually depleted the band's funds.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{failures}} of the hastily planned commando operations undertaken in June and July 1940, there was a period of <b>inactivity</b> in which the concept was refined and detailed planning was undertaken while individual units carried out extensive and specialised training. In early 1941 a number of raids were undertaken but No. 6 Commando did not conduct its first operation until later in the year.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} years of the war, a degree of tension existed between the {{government}} and the army, which divided its allegiance between government and King. The Free Belgian forces, particular the infantry who had been training since 1940, held the government responsible for not being allowed to fight. In November 1942, 12 Belgian soldiers mutinied, complaining about their <b>inactivity.</b> By 1943, the army's royalist stance had been moderated, allowing the government to re-gain the support of the military.|$|E
5|$|Forster was, however, criticised in {{the early}} part of his time at Celtic for lacking {{confidence}} and command, and uncertain when he had the ball at his feet. In time he matured, with his confidence and kicking noticeably improved. His level of concentration was also noted; given Celtic's dominance over the majority of their opponents in Scotland, their goalkeeper often has long periods of <b>inactivity,</b> but when eventually called into action Forster was invariably alert and ready.|$|E
5|$|Fraternisation—peaceful and {{sometimes}} friendly interactions between opposing forces—was a regular feature in quiet front-line {{sectors of the}} Western Front. In some areas, it manifested as a passive <b>inactivity,</b> where both sides would refrain from overtly aggressive or threatening behavior, while in other cases it extended to regular conversation or even visits from one trench to another.|$|E
5|$|In 1933, Indian Muslims, {{especially}} from the United Provinces, began to urge Jinnah to return and take up again his leadership of the Muslim League, an organisation which had fallen into <b>inactivity.</b> He remained titular president of the League, but declined to travel to India to preside over its 1933 session in April, writing {{that he could not}} possibly return there {{until the end of the}} year.|$|E
5|$|In 1979, {{following}} {{five years}} of <b>inactivity,</b> Frank and Ravetch returned to screen writing for Norma Rae, with Martin Ritt directing. The film {{tells the story of}} a factory worker from the Southern United States who becomes involved in labour union activities. Unusually, for the couple, the film was based on a true story, that of Crystal Lee Jordan. It was arguably their best received film, winning numerous awards, including two Academy Awards.|$|E
5|$|Sarita {{returned}} to work a house show main event on June 14 in Belton, Texas, in which she, Rosita, Angelina Love and Winter were defeated by Mickie James, Tara and Velvet Sky, before once again going inactive from TNA. After seven months of <b>inactivity,</b> it was reported on January 9, 2013, that Stock had parted ways with TNA.|$|E
5|$|The 2015 North Indian Ocean cyclone {{season was}} a below-average {{tropical}} cyclone season which featured {{the highest number}} of deaths since the 2010 season. Despite <b>inactivity</b> in the Bay of Bengal caused by the ongoing El Niño, the season produced an above-average number of tropical cyclones in the Arabian Sea. The first storm of the season, Ashobaa, formed on 7 June, while the final storm of the season, Megh, ultimately dissipated on 10 November.|$|E
5|$|The college's oldest club/student {{organization}} is Providence College Debate Society. It {{was founded in}} 1921 and has had several periods of <b>inactivity</b> and subsequent revival. Despite being a small group averaging 15-20 students a year the Debate Society has had notable achievements. Most recently the society was ranked 21st nationally in 2015 and has produced several nationally ranked debaters.|$|E
5|$|The {{season was}} the least active since the 1961–1962 season. It {{occurred}} during a significant El Niño event. Its <b>inactivity</b> was comparable to the 2010–11 season which had three named storms. There were 13days when storms were active, the same as 2010–11, although the latter season also had a long-lasting subtropical cyclone. It is estimated that Tropical Depression Fely {{and two of the}} other storms in this season would not have been named during the 2010–11 season.|$|E
5|$|The season's <b>inactivity</b> was {{reflected}} in its low accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 50. ACE is, broadly speaking, {{a measure of the}} power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed, so storms that last a long time, as well as particularly strong hurricanes, have high ACEs. It is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 39mph (63km/h), which is tropical storm strength.|$|E
5|$|Today, erosion {{caused by}} ship {{movements}} {{on the nearby}} Canal has left considerable portions of the Diolkos in a poor state, particularly at its excavated western end. Critics who blame the Greek Ministry of Culture for continued <b>inactivity</b> have launched a petition to save and restore the registered archaeological site.|$|E
5|$|UB-43 sank no ships {{over the}} next eight weeks. Author Paul Halpern reports that the {{majority}} of the German U-boats in the Mediterranean fleet were undergoing repairs and refits at Pola and Cattaro during January. Although no specific mention is made of repairs done on UB-43, the U-boat's <b>inactivity</b> in this period may be for that reason.|$|E
5|$|While {{she was out}} of {{commission}} at Mare Island, Bennington was refitted. A pilothouse that had been added on top of her bridge and a spotlight platform on her bow – both added in 1893–94 – were removed. Benningtons mainmast was also removed, leaving her as a two-mast rig. In addition, two tall ventilation cowls were added immediately behind the bridge. After 18months of <b>inactivity,</b> Bennington was recommissioned on 2 March 1903 under the command of Commander Chauncey Thomas.|$|E
5|$|A {{brief period}} of <b>inactivity</b> {{followed}} before the advance continued. On 26 July, {{as a result of}} the casualties that they had suffered earlier in the month, the battalion was withdrawn from the fighting and moved to the rear. Although they undertook security duties, they did not see action again before the war ended on 15 August 1945. During the fighting around Balikpapan the 2/31st Battalion suffered the highest number of casualties of any Allied unit deployed in the Borneo campaign, losing 44 men killed and 134 wounded.|$|E
5|$|After {{nearly two}} weeks of <b>inactivity,</b> an area of {{disturbed}} weather developed in the Bay of Campeche and quickly became better organized. It was designated Tropical Depression Two {{on the evening of}} June 28, and, two hours later, data from a Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicated that it had strengthened into a tropical storm, at which point the system was named Bret. This {{was the first time that}} two tropical storms had formed in June since the 1986 season, and only the thirteenth time since 1851.|$|E
5|$|After the Ottoman defeat, {{the fleet}} was laid {{up at the}} Golden Horn and left largely {{unattended}} for the following twenty years. During this period of <b>inactivity,</b> Mesudiye received a minor modernization at the Tersâne-i Âmire shipyard on the Golden Horn. At {{the start of the}} Greco-Turkish War in February 1897, Mesudiye was found to be unfit for combat, as were most of the other major warships of the fleet. On 15 May Mesudiye and several other warships attempted to hold a training exercise, which only highlighted the poor state of training of the ships' crews.|$|E
5|$|After the explosion, Bennington was refloated and towed to the Mare Island Navy Yard. Because of {{the extent}} of the damages and the age of the ship, Bennington was not {{repaired}} but was instead decommissioned on 31 October 1905. After five years of <b>inactivity,</b> Bennington was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 10 September 1910 and sold for scrap on 14 November. Bennington was not scrapped but was purchased in 1913 by the Matson Line for use as a molasses barge. She was towed to Honolulu and remained in use there from 1913 until 1924, when she was scuttled off Oahu.|$|E
5|$|At the time, {{the public}} {{strongly}} identified Leigh with {{her second husband}} Laurence Olivier, who was her spouse from 1940 to 1960. Leigh and Olivier starred together in many stage productions, with Olivier often directing, and in three films. She earned {{a reputation for being}} difficult to work with, and for much of her adult life she suffered from bipolar disorder as well as recurrent bouts of chronic tuberculosis, which was first diagnosed in the mid-1940s and ultimately claimed her life at the age of 53. Although her career had periods of <b>inactivity,</b> in 1999 the American Film Institute ranked Leigh as the 16th greatest female movie star of classic Hollywood cinema.|$|E
5|$|Blakeley was {{launched}} 19 September 1918 by William Cramp and Sons Ship and Engine Building Company in Philadelphia and {{sponsored by the}} wife of Charles Adams Blakeley. The ship was commissioned 8 May 1919, {{under the command of}} Commander W. Brown, Jr.. She immediately joined the Atlantic Fleet. Blakely patrolled along the East Coast of the United States until she was decommissioned on 29 June 1922, and returned to Philadelphia. She was recommissioned from 1932 to 1937 to serve with the Scouting Fleet, and then was again decommissioned in Philadelphia. Low military budgets were the cause of these periods of <b>inactivity,</b> as the Navy did not have the funds or manpower to maintain a number of ships, including Blakeley.|$|E
5|$|Edward {{was born}} at Windsor Castle on 13 November 1312, and was often {{referred}} to as Edward of Windsor in his early years. The reign of his father, EdwardII, was a particularly problematic period of English history. One source of contention was the king's <b>inactivity,</b> and repeated failure, in the ongoing war with Scotland. Another controversial issue was the king's exclusive patronage {{of a small group of}} royal favourites. The birth of a male heir in 1312 temporarily improved EdwardII's position in relation to the baronial opposition. To bolster further the independent prestige of the young prince, the king had him created Earl of Chester at only twelve days of age.|$|E
5|$|Following {{several years}} of {{relative}} <b>inactivity</b> as the band maintained their relaxed touring pace, Perry began writing material for a new Daddies album in early 2006, claiming to {{have come to the}} realization of a cathartic reliance on songwriting. In an April 2006 radio interview, he confirmed that the band was in preparation over recording a new studio album, noting that the music would cover new territory for the Daddies, drawing heavily on tropical themes. This was followed shortly thereafter by the band's first U.S. tour since 2000, where much of this new material was debuted.|$|E
5|$|Frank and Ravetch {{maintained}} a close {{working relationship with}} director Martin Ritt throughout their career, collaborating with him on eight occasions; after initially being suggested by Ravetch to direct The Long, Hot Summer (1958), Ritt would eventually draw the couple out of <b>inactivity</b> on three occasions, hiring them to write the screenplays for Norma Rae (1979), Murphy's Romance (1985) and Stanley & Iris (1990). The latter was both the last film directed by Ritt (who died later that year) and the last for which Frank and Ravetch wrote the screenplay.|$|E
5|$|Grayburn was {{promoted}} to war substantive lieutenant in 1942 and married Marcelle Chambers, {{with whom he had}} a son, in the same year. However, the Ox and Bucks remained on the home front and Grayburn became bored with the <b>inactivity.</b> Instead he applied to the Parachute Regiment and in June 1943 he was transferred to the 7th (Light Infantry) Parachute Battalion. The following year he was transferred to the regiment's 2nd Battalion, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel John Frost, and took command of 2 Platoon, A Company.|$|E
5|$|Heartstrings materialized {{following}} a brief hiatus by Howling Bells, whereupon {{the band members}} worked on other projects. Additionally, Juanita became a first-time mother after giving birth. This, along with frustration from the long period of <b>inactivity</b> and creation inspired her and she started to write songs again, at which point she got {{the other members of}} the band involved. They made demos and sent them out to prospective producers, one being Alan Moulder (Nine Inch Nails, The Smashing Pumpkins). Moulder was busy at the time so he recommended that the band contact an assistant of his, Catherine J. Marks (Foals, The Killers), who after meeting, Howling Bells chose to produce the album.|$|E
5|$|In 1658, Parchevich was {{appointed}} {{head of the}} Roman Catholic Diocese of Marcianopolis (named after an Ancient Roman city near modern Devnya, northeastern Bulgaria). Along with the Diocese of Nicopoli headed by Filip Stanislavov, Marcianopolis {{was one of the}} two sees which succeeded the Bulgarian Custody as the governing body of Catholicism in Bulgaria. Parchevich also held the position of Bulgarian internuncio to the Viennese court. In 1661, Parchevich had to step down as Archbishop of Marcianopolis due to pressure from Rome, which condemned his clerical <b>inactivity,</b> though in 1668 he became apostolic vicar to Moldavia despite continuing suspicion.|$|E
5|$|In 1943–1944, the {{battalion}} fought in New Guinea, conducting an amphibious landing {{as part of}} operations to capture Lae in early September {{at the end of}} the Salamaua–Lae campaign, before participating in the follow-up landing on the Huon Peninsula as Japanese forces withdrew inland from Lae. In early 1944, {{the battalion}} was withdrawn to Australia for rest and reorganisation and a long period of <b>inactivity</b> followed before it returned to combat. Its final campaign came late in the war when it was committed to the fighting in Borneo in June 1945, landing on Brunei. Following the end of the war, the battalion was disbanded in early 1946.|$|E
