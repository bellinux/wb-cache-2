30|$|The {{mechanism}} of splitting of timber loaded parallel to grain {{is not clear}} {{and it is difficult}} to evaluate the splitting strength. In this research, splitting tests on Japanese cedar and Douglas fir were conducted to clarify splitting strength. A monotonic tensile force was applied to a drift-pinned joint with steel side plates and splitting failure originated from the pin hole. In order to evaluate the splitting strength, specimens with various parameters, i.e., diameter of drift pin, <b>end</b> <b>margin,</b> edge margin and thickness were used. All parameters affected the splitting strength, but particularly, <b>end</b> <b>margin</b> and thickness also affected the failure mode. As the <b>end</b> <b>margin</b> lengthened, the failure mode was transferred from shear to splitting. On the other hand, as thickness increased, the drift pin bent more at splitting. This bending of the drift pin caused a lag of bearing stress to timber, and the failure mode was transferred from full width splitting to partial width splitting. The splitting strength under various conditions could be evaluated by consideration of the difference in failure modes.|$|E
5000|$|The basic {{advantage}} of a circular slide rule is that the widest dimension of the tool was reduced {{by a factor of}} about 3 (i.e. by π). For example, a 10 cm circular would have a maximum precision approximately equal to a 31.4 cm ordinary slide rule. Circular slide rules also eliminate [...] "off-scale" [...] calculations, because the scales were designed to [...] "wrap around"; they never have to be reoriented when results are near 1.0—the rule is always on scale. However, for non-cyclical non-spiral scales such as S, T, and LL's, the scale width is narrowed to make room for <b>end</b> <b>margins.</b>|$|R

40|$|The primary fault {{created in}} surface-mount MLC {{capacitors}} {{is related to}} flex cracking. This fault is created by a shear force applied to the ceramic element suspended between the terminations faces {{in contact with the}} PCB. The fault creation probability is proportional {{to the size of the}} ceramic chips in that smaller chips have a greater flex capability than larger chips. Utilizing this ceramic device in more circuitry requires larger chips in order to achieve higher capacitance at higher voltages. Early attempts of thicker cover plates, extended <b>end</b> <b>margins,</b> and soft terminations to mitigate this problem have not been 100 % effective as the crack is still capable of being created. We will present a review of those attempts as well as two new variations in design that can influence the levels at which the crack occurs or eliminates the crack. The ‘Flex Crack’ Figure 1.

50|$|The {{number of}} vein endings is very variable, as is whether second order veins <b>end</b> at the <b>margin,</b> or link back to other veins. There are many {{elaborate}} {{variations on the}} patterns that the leaf veins form, and these have functional implications. Of these, angiosperms have the greatest diversity. Within these the major veins function as the support and distribution network for leaves and are correlated with leaf shape. For instance the parallel venation found in most monocots correlates with their elongated leaf shape and wide leaf base, while reticulate venation is seen in simple entire leaves, while digitate leaves typically have venation in which three or more primary veins diverge radially from a single point.|$|R
