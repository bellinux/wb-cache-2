The sample on the left had been placed in an outdoor <b>exposure</b> <b>rack,</b> and weathered for a total of 6 years. It can be seen that the sample has a chalky appearance and has undergone a colour change in comparison to the unweathered sample on the right.|$|E
40|$|The {{application}} of coatings {{for control of}} degradation of materials has been historically used since ancient civilizations, but usually the coating systems {{take a long time}} to show the physical evidence of corrosion on coated metals, so the evaluation of coatings in aggressive atmospheres and with a rapid way has been the dream of the experts and users through the time. Laboratory standard tests have been developed as a quality control for coatings, including salt fog, climate chamber or artificially damaged conditions. The paint systems utilized for the study were zero volatile organic solvents or paints water base with metallic zinc content. The electrochemical measurements were made before and after the potentiostatic test using the electrochemical techniques of Corrosion Potential (Ecorr), Linear Polarization Resistance (LPR), Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) and the Polarization Curves. For the evaluation of the coatings exposed to the atmosphere, the samples were retired at different times to apply the electrochemical tests in the laboratory and then returned to the <b>exposure</b> <b>rack.</b> For the {{application of}} the Rapid Electrochemical Assessment of Paints (REAP), the galvanic current was registered during the potentiostatic conditions due that provides an alternative method for the qualification of paint systems, while the parameter of degradability for the paint systems can be calculated from the LPR results that are showed and compared with the results from both evaluation methods...|$|E
40|$|Low-density polyethylene-based {{greenhouse}} {{films have}} been monitored for outdoor weather effects by mounting the film on a model greenhouse and on aluminum <b>exposure</b> <b>racks</b> at Dhahran plastic exposure facility. The change in chemical properties was monitored by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The thermal properties were observed by {{differential scanning calorimetry}} (DSC) and the drop in percent elongation and stress at break was monitored. It is concluded that greenhouse film mounted on the model greenhouse degraded more {{in comparison to the}} film on aluminum racks. The spectral emissions with wavelength between 7 and 14 mu m {{are an important part of}} the energy losses from the soil and the plants inside a greenhouse. The partial prevention of the dissipation of this thermal energy from the greenhouse film during cool night hours creates a unique environment and influences the degradation reactions in the plastic Nm. Pesticides, mostly sulfur- and halogen-based compounds, can also accelerate the degradation of the film...|$|R

40|$|Qualified requesters may obtain {{copies of}} this report from DDC. When this study was {{initiated}} a list of 78 commercially avaiianle phosphate coatinhgs was compiled. After investiga-tion of the make-up and and factors of application involved in these products, {{it was discovered that}} only 41 had enough distinct differences to warrant their use in these compara-, tive tests. Fifty different sets of prepared specimens were used in this study. Forty-one commercial phosphating products, 3 commercial washprimers and 4 phosphating process solutions in use at the Rock Island Arsenal were used. Also included was a diluted commercial phosphoric acid rust remover and metal conditioner and one control set comprised only of cleaned steel. All phosphated panels were processed in accordance with directions supplied by the manufacturer. Six panels from each of the 50 sets of panels prepared were coated with one of the 9 different systems of organic coatings. The pre-pared panels were scored and mounted on outdoor <b>exposure</b> <b>racks.</b> This report covers the results of 8 years of South (at 45 degrees) exposure at Rock Island Arsenal!

40|$|Environmental {{degradation}} of UV-stabilized {{low density polyethylene}} (LDPE) film was observed by mounting the film on model greenhouse and aluminum <b>exposure</b> <b>racks.</b> The performance characteristics of weathered film in terms of drop in percent elongation was observed by testing mechanical property. The variations at molecular chain level were recorded by the Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC) and the surface and morphological changes were monitored by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). The results clearly reveal that the polyethylene film mounted on the model greenhouse has presented higher rate of degradation {{as compared to the}} film mounted on racks. The controlled environment inside the greenhouse partially prevent the dissipation of thermal energy from the greenhouse plastic film during cool night hours and create a unique environment which influence higher thermal degradation in the mechanically strained plastic film from inside. The overall hostile parameters inside the greenhouse contributes as a dual degradation factor in the deterioration of polymeric film. The chain scission reaction was predominant during the degradation phenomenon in terms of drop in elongation and molecular weight. Surfac...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Weathering {{degradation}} of thermally stabilized recycled and reprocessed high-density polyethylene (HDPE) was monitored by nat-urally exposing the HDPE dumbbells on the aluminum <b>exposure</b> <b>racks.</b> The HDPE dumbbells were prepared in the injection-molding machine using {{small percentage of}} anti-oxidants and slip agent to protect the thermo-oxidative {{degradation of}} the material. Four types of HDPE material were used under this study such as: virgin HDPE, 50 / 50 mix-ture of recycled and fresh HDPE, virgin HDPE with thermal stabilizers and recycled HDPE with thermal stabilizers. The performance charac-teristics of the weathered recycled HDPE material was monitored by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and the mechanical properties. The results clearly revealed the deterioration of virgin and recycled mixed HDPE formu-lations as compared to thermally stabilized recycled HDPE material under the hostile outdoor weather conditions of Dhahran, Saudi Arabia. A significant drop in the mechanical, thermal and the chemical prop-erties was observed for all the exposed HDPE formulations in terms of drop in elongation, increase in the percent crystallinity and percent carbonyl index. The photo-stability of recycled and reprocessed HDPE materials can be enhanced by incorporating appropriate amount of photo stabilizers in the base formulations...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an assembly designed to monitor atmospheric corrosion inside the concrete reactor vessel of a retired {{nuclear power plant}} in Spain during the waiting period (latency) of its decommissioning. Atmospheric corrosiveness was determined according to International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 11844 - 1 and 11844 - 2 standards, using gravimetric specimens and electrical resistance probes arranged on special racks inserted in the reactor vessel through three upper penetrations. Results are reported {{for the first three}} years of <b>exposure</b> of the <b>racks</b> inside the reactor vessel. Very low corrosion rates (< 0. 02 μm/y) were found for all three carbon steel types tested. © 2007, NACE International. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Alcohol (ethanol) {{abuse is}} a major {{societal}} problem. Although ethanol is a structurally simple, diffusible molecule, its sites of action are surprisingly selective, and the molecular mechanisms underlying specificity in ethanol actions are not understood. The NMDA receptor channel {{is one of the}} main targets for ethanol in the brain. We report here that the brain region-specific compartmentalization of Fyn kinase determines NMDA receptor sensitivity to ethanol. We demonstrate that, in the hippocampus but not in the cerebral cortex, Fyn is targeted to the NR 2 B subunit of the NMDA receptor by the scaffolding protein RACK 1. During acute <b>exposure</b> to ethanol, <b>RACK</b> 1 is dissociated from the complex, thereby facilitating Fyn-mediated phosphorylation of NR 2 B, which enhances channel activity, counteracting the inhibitory actions of ethanol. In this way, the selective scaffolding can account for the ethanol-induced acute tolerance of NMDA receptor activity that is detected in the hippocampus but not in the cerebral cortex. The phosphorylation-dependent, regionspecific activities of ethanol on the NMDA receptor provide a compelling molecular explanation that accounts for the selective activities of ethanol and may have important implications for elucidating pathways leading to alcohol addiction.
