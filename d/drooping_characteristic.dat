40|$|This {{high-speed}} automotive {{diesel engine}} {{was designed to}} achieve the greatest possible reliability in opera-tion, low operating and maintenance costs and maximum versatility of component and auxiliary arrange-ments, based on long experience of large-scale manufacture of engines for commercial vehicles and the increases in power output and time between overhauls made possible by improvements in design, materials, manufacturing processes, fuels and lubricants. Elimination of the cylinder high-pressure joint was {{a radical departure from}} current practice and promised considerable advantages in cooling, reducing thermal stress and freeing restrictions in cylinder-head porting layout. Thus the potential for operating at the highest rating now in use and for future development was improved. This paper deals with the design aims, describes the engine and outlines the development work with single and multi-cylinder engines that has been undertaken to ensure that each commercial variant meets the re-quirements of its rating. Vertical and horizontal configurations are used in naturally aspirated and pressure-charged versions. For automotive work, using mechanical transmissions, the <b>drooping</b> <b>characteristic</b> of the normal turbocharged engines torque curve at low speed is a serious disadvantage. Measures taken to over-come this are described. These included variations in camshaft timing, automatic variable control of injection timing and boost pressure control of fuel injection quantity to avoid undesirable smoke in the exhaust emission in addition to the normal development work of ensuring the highest practicable standards of mechanical, volumetric and combustion efficiency. Other methods such as special turbocharger matchings, including the waste-gate system of turbine by-pass, the system of auxiliary hydraulic drive of the turbocharger at low engine speeds and, as alternative to turbocharging, pressure charging by an aerodynamic pulse-converter are discussed. At {{the other end of the}} scale, considerable attention has been paid to increasing the maximum engine output by turbocharging with intercooling which promises to increase naturally aspirated power by over 100 per cent, if in road vehicles the problem of the intercooler, airlair or airlwater, can be dealt with satisfactorily...|$|E

40|$|A recent {{trend of}} the power system is the ever {{increasing}} number of distributed generators (DGs) utilizing renewable energy sources, which have output powers that fluctuate due to unpredictable weather and ambient conditions. This causes fluctuations in system frequency and bus voltages, resulting in poor quality power, higher prices for electricity, and increased chances of reverse power flow and voltage collapse. In order to allow higher levels of DG penetration, methods of reducing the effects of fluctuations must be implemented. This paper proposes a method to mitigate these fluctuations using controllable loads such as heat pump water heaters (HPs) and battery storage systems. The HPs are controlled using a decentralized bang-bang (on/off) control based on the cumulative distribution of water temperature of HPs in the local area and the local frequency. Battery systems are controlled using a smart frequency and voltage <b>droop</b> <b>characteristics</b> based control. The decentralized bang-bang control mitigates local frequency fluctuations by increasing active power consumption to lower frequency as well as decreasing active power consumption to increase the frequency. The smart <b>droop</b> <b>characteristics</b> based control applies a commonly used <b>droop</b> <b>characteristics</b> control to voltage and frequency; however, the control system monitors the state of charge (SOC) of the battery system and takes appropriate actions to prevent the SOC from reaching a critical level.

Specifically, decentralized schemes are more flexible, less computationally intensive, and easier to implement without relying on communication infrastructure. Economic operation of existing decentralized schemes is also usually achieved by either tuning the <b>droop</b> <b>characteristics</b> of distributed generators (DGs) or prioritizing their dispatch order. For the latter, an earlier scheme has tried to prioritize the DG dispatch based on their no-load generation costs. Although the prioritization works well with some generation costs saved, its reliance on only the DG no-load generation costs does not allow it to operate well under certain conditions. This paper thus presents a more comprehensive economic dispatch scheme, which considers the DG generation costs, their power ratings, and other necessary constraints, before deciding the DG dispatch priorities and <b>droop</b> <b>characteristics.</b> The proposed scheme also allows online power reserve to be set and regulated within the microgrid.

40|$|The {{decarbonisation}} of Europe’s {{energy sector}} {{is a key}} driver {{for the development of}} integrated HVDC networks or DC grids. A multi-terminal HVDC grid will enable a more reliable power transfer from offshore wind farms and will facilitate the cross-border exchange of energy between different countries. However, the widespread deployment of DC grids is prevented by technical challenges, including the control and protection of DC grids. In order to close the gap, this thesis aims to contribute to three aspects (1) : developing a control method for DC grids operation; (2) : developing a method for optimising wind power delivery using DC grids; (3) : developing a protection method for fast DC fault current interruption. The control of a DC grid demands the regulation of DC voltage and hence keeps the power into and out from the DC grid balanced. It is also important to keep the accuracy of regulating the converter DC current. In this thesis, the Autonomous Converter Control (ACC) is developed to meet this requirement. With this method, alternative <b>droop</b> control <b>characteristics</b> can be used for individual converters to share the responsibility of regulation of DC voltage while precisely controlling the converter DC current. The control algorithms of alterative <b>droop</b> <b>characteristics</b> are developed and interactions of different control characteristics are analysed. Furthermore, the potential risk of having multiple cross-over in control characteristics is uncovered. The method for designing <b>droop</b> <b>characteristics</b> is provided to avoid the multiple cross-over. The ACC is demonstrated on different simulation platforms including the PSCAD/EMTDC and a real-time hardware 4 -terminal HVDC test rig. It is found that the proper use of alternative <b>droop</b> <b>characteristics</b> can achieve better current control performance. The adverse impact of having multiple cross-over in control characteristics is also studied using both simulation platforms. The effect of the control of both converters and DC power flow controllers (DC-PFCs) on DC power flow in steady state is also investigated. A method for re-dispatching control orders to optimise the wind power delivery is developed. Case studies are undertaken and it is found that both the DC line power loss and wind power curtailment can be reduced by redispatching the control orders of converters and DC-PFCs. The protection of a DC grid demands a very fast speed for fault current interruption. Conventional methods proposed for HVDC grid protection take delays of several milliseconds to discriminate a faulted circuit to healthy circuits and then allow the DC circuit breakers (DC-CBs) to open at the faulted circuits. The fault current will keep rising during Control and Protection of HVDC Grids iv the delayed time caused by fault discrimination. The Open Grid protection method is thus developed to interrupt fault current before fault discrimination. With this method, multiple DC-CBs open to interrupt the fault current based on local measurements of voltage (and current) and the DC-CBs on healthy circuits will reclose to achieve discrimination afterwards. This will reduce the delay for fault current interruption and hence the fault current can be interrupted with a much smaller magnitude. The developed Open Grid method is tested via simulation models developed in PSCAD/EMTDC. The results show that the Open Grid can detect very quickly and discriminate various faults under different fault conditions in a meshed HVDC grid...|$|R
