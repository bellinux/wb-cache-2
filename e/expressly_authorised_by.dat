2500|$|In 2016, Heath J in Taylor v Attorney-General [...] 3 NZLR 791 {{issued a}} formal {{declaration}} of inconsistency between s80(1)(d) Electoral Act 1993 and s12(a) Bill of Rights Act 1990. This {{was the first}} declaration of inconsistency in New Zealand. It was appealed to the Court of Appeal which upheld the declaration of inconsistency. The Attorney-General argued that the Court had no jurisdiction to issue a declaration of inconsistency unless it was <b>expressly</b> <b>authorised</b> <b>by</b> legislation. The Court of Appeal called this a “bold argument” and concluded that “inconsistency between statutes {{is a question of}} interpretation…and it lies within the province of the courts." [...] As such, declarations of inconsistency are an available remedy under the Bill of Rights Act 1990.|$|E

5000|$|Prest v Secretary of State for Wales (1982) 81 LGR 193, Lord Denning MR, 'It {{is clear}} that no {{minister}} or public authority can acquire any land compulsorily except {{the power to do}} so be given by Parliament: and Parliament only grants it, or should only grant it, when it is necessary in the public interest. In any case, therefore, where the scales are evenly balanced - for or against compulsory acquisition - the decision - by whomsoever it is made - should come down against compulsory acquisition. I regard it as a principle of our constitutional law that no citizen is to be deprived of his land by any public authority against his will, unless it is <b>expressly</b> <b>authorised</b> <b>by</b> Parliament and the public interest decisively so demands. If there is any reasonable doubt on the matter, the balance must be resolved in favour of the citizen.' ...|$|E

The extent of authority is a question fact and is significantly more than the fact of an employment that gave the employee the opportunity to carry out the fraud.|$|R
30|$|For {{substances}} {{with certain}} properties {{of very high}} concern (SVHC), the REACH Regulation gives the option of inclusion in the candidate list and possibly in Annex XIV (list of substances subject to authorisation). This brings information requirements for manufacturers, importers and suppliers of articles. Furthermore, an application for authorisation must be made for substances listed in Annex XIV of the REACH regulation [8]. After a transitional period, substances included in this list can be used only for <b>expressly</b> <b>authorised</b> uses for limited time spans.|$|R
50|$|In most jurisdictions, {{punitive damages}} are not available. They are {{considered}} contrary to public policy, because the civil justice system {{in many countries}} {{does not have the}} same procedural protections as the comparable criminal justice system. Therefore, allowing punitive damages would have the effect of punishing actors for wrongful conduct without allowing them the ordinary procedural protections that are present in a criminal trial. The fear is that punitive damages encourage a vindictive, revenge seeking state of mind in the claimant and society more generally. In the UK, Rookes v Barnard limited the situations in which punitive damages can be won in tort actions to where they are <b>expressly</b> <b>authorised</b> <b>by</b> a statute, where a defendant's action is calculated to make profit, or where an official of the state has acted arbitrarily, oppressively or unconstitutionally. In the United States, though rarely awarded in tort cases, punitive damages are available, and are sometimes quite staggering when awarded. For example, in 1999, a Los Angeles County jury awarded $4.8 billion in punitive damages against General Motors to a group of six burn victims whose 1979 Chevrolet Malibu was rear-ended by a drunk driver, causing it to catch fire. That was later reduced to $1.2 billion by the judge.|$|E
5000|$|Care {{during periods}} of {{heightened}} sensitivity33. Local authorities should pay particular regard to the legislation governing publicity {{during the period of}} heightened sensitivity before elections and referendums - see paragraphs 7 to 9 of this code. It may be necessary to suspend the hosting of material produced by third parties, or to close public forums during this period to avoid breaching any legal restrictions.34. During the period between the notice of an election and the election itself, local authorities should not publish any publicity on controversial issues or report views or proposals {{in such a way that}} identifies them with any individual members or groups of members. Publicity relating to individuals involved directly in the election should not be published by local authorities during this period unless <b>expressly</b> <b>authorised</b> <b>by</b> or under statute. It is permissible for local authorities to publish factual information which identifies the names, wards and parties of candidates at elections.35. In general, local authorities should not issue any publicity which seeks to influence voters. However this general principle is subject to any statutory provision which authorises expenditure being incurred on the publication of material designed to influence the public as to whether to support or oppose a question put at a referendum. It is acceptable to publish material relating to the subject matter of a referendum, for example to correct any factual inaccuracies which have appeared in publicity produced by third parties, so long as this is even-handed and objective and does not support or oppose any of the options which are the subject of the vote.|$|E
40|$|The United Nations Charter's use {{of force}} {{paradigm}} prohibits all uses of force by states except in respect of self-defence or when authorised by the Security Council. However, in 1999, NATO, without express authorisation from the Security Council, undertook non-defensive military action against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, {{in response to the}} ongoing crisis in Kosovo. Then, in March 2003, the United States led a coalition of states in a war against Iraq. This military action was also not <b>expressly</b> <b>authorised</b> <b>by</b> the Security Council. Both of these uses of force are ~neral 1 y considered to constitute primafacie breaches of the Charter's {{use of force}} paradigm. These breaches of the Charter have led some observers to claim that the [...] :f Charter's use of force paradigm is now 'dead'. It is argued that the invasion of Iraq by the United States-led coalition represents a fmal assault on the Charter's use of force rules. These spectacular breaches of the Charter demonstrate that states no longer consider the Charter's use of force paradigm to be authoritative and controlling. Thereby, the Charter's use of force paradigm is no longer valid. Through the prism ofKosovo and Iraq, this thesis examines the question of :he impact of breaches of the Charter's use of force paradigm upon its :ontinued validity. It is posited that although the Charter's use of force rules lave been breached, these breaches do not mean that the Charter's use of orce paradigm is repudiated by states and thereby no longer valid. It is ontended that in spite of these breaches the Charter's use of force laradigm remains authoritative. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
