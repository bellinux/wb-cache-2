5|$|Chen Guangcheng, a blind self-taught Weiquan lawyer, rose to {{prominence}} for defending victims of China's one-child policy. First implemented in 1979, the one-child policy mandates that couples may {{only have one}} child, though there are exceptions for some rural citizens, ethnic minorities, and couples who were themselves only children. Though Chinese laws condemn harsh enforcement measures, Chinese authorities and <b>family</b> <b>planning</b> staff {{have been accused of}} carrying out coercive, late-term forced abortions, sterilization, incarceration and torture to enforce the policy. In 2005, Chen Guangcheng filed a class action case against <b>family</b> <b>planning</b> officials in Linyi, Shandong, who were accused of subjecting thousands of women to sterilization or forced abortions.|$|E

40|$|In the {{telecommunications}} market, firms often give consumers {{the option of}} purchasing an individual <b>plan</b> or a <b>family</b> <b>plan.</b> An individual plan gives a certain allowance of usage (e. g., minutes, data) for a single consumer, whereas a <b>family</b> <b>plan</b> allows multiple consumers to share a specific level of usage. The theoretical challenge is {{to understand how the}} firm stands to benefit from allowing <b>family</b> <b>plans.</b> In this paper, we use a game-theoretic framework to explore the role of <b>family</b> <b>plans.</b> An obvious way that <b>family</b> <b>plans</b> can be profitable is if it draws in very low-valuation consumers whom the firm would choose not to serve {{in the absence of a}} <b>family</b> <b>plan.</b> Interestingly, we find that even when a <b>family</b> <b>plan</b> does not draw any new consumers into the market, a firm can still benefit from offering it. This finding occurs primarily because of the strategic impact of the <b>family</b> <b>plan</b> on the firm's entire product line. By allowing high- and low-valuation consumers to share joint allowance in the <b>family</b> <b>plan,</b> the firm is able to raise the price to extract more surplus from the individual high-valuation consumers by reducing the cannibalization problem. Furthermore, a family obtains a higher allowance compared to the purchase of several individual plans and therefore contributes more profits to the firm. We also observe different types of quantity discounts in the firm's product line. Finally, we identify conditions under which the firm offers a pay-as-you-go plan. Dissertatio...|$|R

5|$|Birth control, {{also known}} as {{contraception}} and fertility control, is a method or device used to prevent pregnancy. Birth control has been used since ancient times, but effective and safe methods of birth control only became available in the 20th century. Planning, making available, and using birth control is called <b>family</b> <b>planning.</b> Some cultures limit or discourage access to birth control because they consider it to be morally, religiously, or politically undesirable.|$|E
5|$|In 1936 the U.S. {{court ruled}} in U.S. v. One Package that {{medically}} prescribing contraception {{to save a}} persons life or well being was not illegal under the Comstock Law; following this decision, the American Medical Association Committee on Contraception revoked its 1936 statement condemning birth control. A national survey in 1937 showed 71 percent {{of the adult population}} supported the use of contraception. By 1938 347 birth control clinics were running in the United States despite their advertisement still being illegal. First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt publicly supported birth control and <b>family</b> <b>planning.</b> In 1966, President Lyndon B. Johnson started endorsing public funding for <b>family</b> <b>planning</b> services, and the Federal Government began subsidizing birth control services for low-income families. The Affordable Care Act, passed into law on March 23, 2010 under President Barack Obama, requires all plans in the Health Insurance Marketplace to cover contraceptive methods. These include barrier methods, hormonal methods, implanted devices, emergency contraceptives, and sterilization procedures.|$|E
