40|$|AbstractSouth Africa is {{reliant on}} fossil fuels. These fossil fuels are {{important}} to economic development, being the most dependable, cost-effective energy source currently available in this country however, their conventional use results in significant CO 2 emissions for the country. South Africa will require a portfolio of technologies to reduce its CO 2 emissions however with a heavily coal-based economy, CCS {{is likely to be}} a particularly important part of this portfolio. To assess the technical potential for CCS in South Africa, the South African Centre for Carbon Capture and Storage (SACCCS) was established in 2009 as a public-private research collaboration. The current focus of SACCCS is the development of the Pilot CO 2 Storage Project (PCSP) which will inject and store between 10 - 50, 000 tCO 2 in South African conditions. With the development of the PCSP now underway, there has been significant progress to date, in particular in the areas of funding, permitting and stakeholder engagement where around USD 50 million has been raised for the project, a request for approval for basin exploration submitted, and a significant number of stakeholders engaged. There have however also been some delays with the development of the PCSP, particularly following the PCSP Advisory Committee (PAC) review of geological analysis done to date for the Zululand and Algoa Basins. The PAC recommended that more information could yet be extracted from the existing data prior to deciding whether or not to progress to the acquisition of new geological <b>data</b> (<b>Gate</b> 2 Review). SAC CCS is now working on the implementation of the PAC Review recommendations and the development of Gate 2 Deliverables in preparation for the Gate 2 Review...|$|E

We present instruction-levels <b>data</b> <b>gating</b> technique. We can control activation and swit-ching activity of the function units in the proposed data technique. We present instruction-levels DVS tech-nique without using DC-DC converter and voltage scheduler controlled by the operation system. We can control powers of the function units in the proposed DVS technique. The proposed instruction-levels DVS technique has the simple architecture than complicated DVS which is DC-DC converter and voltage sche-duler controlled by the operation system and a hard-ware implementation is very easy. But, the energy efficiency of the proposed instruction-levels DVS tech-nique having dual-power supply {{is similar to the}} complicated DVS which is DC-DC converter and voltage scheduler controlled by the operation system. We simulate the circuit simulation for running test program using Spectra. We selected reduced power supply to 0. 667 times of the supplied power supply. The energy efficiency of the proposed 32 bit parallel processor core using instruction-levels <b>data</b> <b>gating</b> and DVS techniques can improve about 88. 4 % than that of the 32 bit parallel processor core without using those.

30|$|Beyond gating, there {{persists}} {{the question}} {{on how best to}} utilize <b>gated</b> <b>data.</b> Respiratory <b>gating</b> provides an uncertain value, particularly in general, non-specific populations. When applying gating, there is a fundamental tradeoff between the potential improved resolution and increased noise resulting from sub-sampled statistics, which affects detectability and contrast-to-noise.

Patients move in different patterns and to different extents, and available count statistics vary from patient to patient and scanner to scanner.|$|R
40|$|Airborne time-domain {{electromagnetic}} methods (AEM) {{are useful}} for hydrogeological mapping due to their rapid and extensive spatial coverage and high correlation between measured magnetic fields, electrical conductivity, and relevant hydrogeological parameters. However, AEM data, preprocessing and modelling procedures can suffer from inaccuracies that may dramatically affect the final interpretation. We demonstrate the importance {{and the benefits of}} advanced data processing for two AEM datasets (AeroTEM III and VTEM) collected over the Spiritwood buried valley aquifer in southern Manitoba, Canada. Early-time <b>data</b> <b>gates</b> are identified as having significant flightdependent signal bias that reflects survey flights and flight lines. These data are removed from inversions along with late time <b>data</b> <b>gates</b> contaminated by apparently random noise. In conjunction with supporting information, the less-extensive, but broader-band VTEM data are used to construct an electrical reference model. The reference model is subsequently used to calibrate the AeroTEM dataset via forward modelling for coincident soundings. The procedure produces calibration factors that we apply to AeroTEM data over the entire survey domain. Inversion of the calibrated data results in improved data fits, particularly at early times, but some flight-line artefacts remain. Residual striping between adjacent flights is corrected by including a mean empirical amplitude correction factor within the spatially constrained inversion scheme. Finally, the AeroTEM and VTEM data are combined in a joint inversion. Results confirm consistency between the two different AEM datasets and the recovered models. On the contrary, joint inversion of unprocessed or uncalibrated AEM datasets results in erroneous resistivity models which, in turn, can result in an inappropriate hydrogeological interpretation of the study area...|$|R

40|$|We {{developed}} a new dedicated measurement protocol for dynamic (31) P MRS analysis in contracting calf muscles of the mouse, using minimally invasive assessment of the contractile force combined with the acquisition of spectroscopic <b>data</b> <b>gated</b> to muscle contraction and determination of phosphocreatine (PCr) recovery rate and ATP contractile cost. This protocol was applied in a comparative study of six wild type (WT) mice and six mice deficient in cytosolic creatine kinase and adenylate kinase isoform 1 (MAK(-/-) mice) using 70 repeated tetanic contractions at two contractions per minute. Force levels during single contractions, and metabolite levels and tissue pH during resting conditions were similar in muscles of MAK(-/-) and WT mice. Strikingly, muscle relaxation after contraction was significantly delayed in MAK(-/-) mice, but during repeated contractions, the decrease in the force was similar in both mouse types. <b>Gated</b> <b>data</b> acquisition showed a negligible PCr breakdown in MAK(-/-) immediately after contraction, without a concomitant decrease in ATP or tissue pH. This protocol enabled the determination of rapid PCr changes that would otherwise go unnoticed due to intrinsic low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in mouse skeletal muscles combined with {{an assessment of the}} PCr recovery rate. Our results suggest that MAK(-/-) mice use alternative energy sources to maintain force during repeated contractions when PCr breakdown is reduced. Furthermore, the absence of large increases in adenosine diphosphate (ADP) or differences in force compared to WT mice in our low-intensity protocol indicate that creatine kinase (CK) and adenylate kinase (AK) are especially important in facilitating energy metabolism during very high energy demands...|$|R
40|$|The {{extraction}} of spectral {{information in the}} inversion process of time-domain (TD) induced polarization (IP) data is changing {{the use of the}} TDIP method. Data interpretation is evolving from a qualitative description of the subsurface, able only to discriminate the presence of contrasts in chargeability parameters, towards a quantitative analysis of the investigated media, which allows for detailed soil-And rock-Type characterization. Two major limitations restrict the {{extraction of}} the spectral information of TDIP data in the field: i) the difficulty of acquiring reliable early-Time measurements, and ii) the selfpotential drift in the measured potentials distorting the shape of the late time. For measuring at early times, we developed a new method for removing harmonic noise from the data. Furthermore, a new scheme for spike removal was developed and tapered windows are used in the <b>data</b> <b>gating.</b> For measuring at late times, we developed a drift-removal scheme that model the polarization effect and allows for preserving the shape of the IP responses at late times.

40|$|Abstract: Both {{the control}} of {{territory}} possessing natural resources used to finance armed conflict and the distances an army must travel to project force affect how a civil war is fought and who will prevail. In this paper, a model based on a contest success function designed to explicitly account for distances is employed to model the ability to project force and sustain conflict. The strategic ambitions of the rebel group will determine whether the conflict is focused on territorial secession or conquest of the government. These goals, in turn, affect where the war is fought, how it is fought, {{and the likelihood of}} one of the parties succeeding militarily. Using both Cox regression and parametric survival analyses, specific propositions regarding the duration of conflicts derived from the formal model are analyzed. Using a precisely dated armed civil conflict duration <b>data</b> (<b>Gates</b> & Strand, 2004), which is based on the Uppsala Armed Conflict dataset (Eriksson & Wallensteen, 2004), and using data regarding the location of conflict (Buhaug & Gates, 2002) and natural resources (Buhaug & Lujala, 2004) we are able to assess the role geography has on the duration of armed civil conflict, especially in terms of the location of the conflict zone and location of lootable natural resources.
