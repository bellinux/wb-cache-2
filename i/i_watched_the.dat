25|$|We {{all knew}} {{in our hearts}} that Michael was disappointing. We felt that we had {{compensated}} adequately in making a fun, exciting, stylized world. You know, I was disappointed in one aspect: a voiceover from Tom’s sister that we had, which Walter later decided to cut. Um, {{there were a couple}} of things in the narrative that I felt went out that probably should have stayed in. At the same time, I was myself knocked out by what Walter and (cinematographer) Andy Laszlo and our editor were doing visually on the film. And I felt, as <b>I</b> <b>watched</b> <b>the</b> post-production process going on, I just saw the film getting better and better. More impressive. To the point where I thought it was going to do well. And I thought that we had done what we set out to do. Created the world that we set out to create.... It was a movie that was built to succeed. It’s funny. The movie screened very, very well. I remember, after the first screenings, people told me that I was going to be rich for life. There was tremendous love and confidence.|$|E

[...] Waddle personally directed the maneuvers. [...] According to Waddle, the DVs [...] "were loving it." [...] Waddle adds, [...] "I could barely suppress a smile as <b>I</b> <b>watched</b> <b>the</b> expressions of joy and amazement {{on the faces of}} our distinguished visitors." [...] During the maneuvers, several civilians in the sonar room conversed with the sonar technicians, who were at the same time trying to keep track of any sonar contacts in the vicinity.|$|E

500|$|The {{film has}} also been said to be {{inspired}} by The Devotion of Suspect X, a Japanese novel written by Keigo Higashino. Ekta Kapoor, who had purchased the Hindi movie rights of the novel, sent a legal notice to the makers of the film. However, the director clarified, [...] "After Ekta's legal team sent us the letter, <b>I</b> <b>watched</b> <b>the</b> Japanese film, Suspect X, which is an adaptation of the Japanese novel. There could be similarities between my film and that Japanese film, but my film is neither an adaptation nor a copy. The Japanese film is also about a murder cover-up and hence the allegation. Similarities are quite common {{in the works of}} creators and that shouldn't be made into an issue." [...] Rashomon (1950) was also cited as an inspiration for the film.|$|E
500|$|Prop master Rob Smith {{created the}} shapeshifter device and later regretted its design. He {{had joined the}} series during its second season, and had to quickly {{manufacture}} props while working under time and budget constraints. He explained, [...] " [...] first episode {{we had to make}} the shape-shifter device, the thing that you put into your mouth and it transforms one person into another person. I was brand new here and I wasn’t happy with the way that turned out, and it came back in about 5 or 6 episodes. Every time it came back I was like, ‘Oh, I wish I could have that time over again to redo this one." [...] He added, [...] "A lot of the time, I [...] actually see [...] on set, so <b>I</b> <b>watched</b> <b>the</b> episode to see how everything comes together." ...|$|E
500|$|The Wonderwall {{score was}} Harrison's first {{opportunity}} to compose extensively for a single project. He later described how he went about preparing the music: [...] "I had a regular wind-up stopwatch and <b>I</b> <b>watched</b> <b>the</b> film to 'spot-in' the music with the watch. I wrote the timings down in my book, then I'd go to , make up a piece, record it." [...] As with his songs for the Beatles over this period, including [...] "Within You Without You" [...] and [...] "Blue Jay Way", he composed mainly on keyboard instruments such as piano or organ, rather than guitar. In addition to the Indian pieces, Harrison wrote and arranged selections in Western musical styles. In some cases, these pieces were outlined to the musicians at the recording session by Harrison, on guitar, and they then improvised on his ideas. With other selections, he first made a demo, which the musicians followed.|$|E

500|$|Following its broadcast, [...] "Brother's Little Helper" [...] {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics. About nine {{years after its}} original broadcast, Robert Canning of IGN posted a [...] "flashback review" [...] of [...] "Brother's Little Helper". Canning, calling the episode [...] "funny" [...] and [...] "a standout episode in this later season", was particularly fond of the episode's opening. However, he was less impressed with the third act of the episode, calling it [...] "lackluster". He felt that the part involving Mark McGwire was [...] "a silly cop out" [...] and that it wasn't as funny as what was leading up to it. He also stated that he was {{put off by the}} writers wanting to come across a message. [...] "It's not that I necessarily disagreed with this sentiment", Canning wrote, [...] "but at the time, I didn't think I needed to be taught a lesson while <b>I</b> <b>watched</b> <b>The</b> Simpsons. I still don't." [...] He did, however, [...] "love" [...] the [...] "tag back" [...] to the volunteer fire department seen {{in the beginning of the}} episode, and [...] "the fact that they can't find how to fight a satellite fire in their handbook".|$|E

[...] In the subsequent press conference, pole position winner, Edwards, stated his frustration at his accident, [...] "I’m not exactly sure what happened. I’ll have to talk to Kyle about it. I thought at first he was just frustrated and he turned left to get back in line and he didn’t know I was there, but <b>I</b> <b>watched</b> <b>the</b> tape and I think he really did get loose. He hit me hard and I was left with nothing. I got rammed to the infield." [...] Rick Hendrick, the owner of Hendrick Motorsports, expressed his enjoyment of winning the race, stating, [...] "When you're a champion like Jeff Gordon, you know you can still do it, (even) when people overlook you. He's been right there but he hasn't had that edge. I think we're {{going to see a lot}} of momentum out of that team right now." ...|$|E

However, part of her could {{appreciate}} that Hilson does what she wants and that she is confident enough to do it. Concepcion further stated: [...] "Then <b>I</b> <b>watched</b> <b>the</b> above interview she did with Perez Hilton, {{and it made me}} respect her even more. She stood her ground and made no excuses for her words or her visuals, and I can dig that." [...] Niki A. M. of Vibe wrote that Hilson [...] "made quite tails wag with her titillating video" [...] and that [...] "men reeled over the scantily clad vixen gyrating and shouting sexplicit phrases like [...] "fuck me" [...] while females seethed in disappointment over her crotch shots that went viral just days ago." [...] Becky Bain, writing for Idolator, stated that [...] "the stilted dialog between Hilson and Columbus Short {{near the end of the}} mini-movie as well as the former's delivery makes the scene come off like the beginning of a porn movie, and unsurprisingly, the scene ends much like a porn movie." ...|$|E

500|$|Some reviews {{were more}} positive. Welch D. Everman, author of Cult Science Fiction Films, {{compared}} {{the relationship between}} West and Nelson to that of Victor Frankenstein and his monster in Mary Shelly's novel Frankenstein (1818). Everman wrote, [...] "This {{is the kind of}} movie we've come to expect from AIP — cheaply made, nasty, and lots of fun". John W. Bowen of the Belleville Intelligencer said he enjoyed the [...] "camp" [...] style of the film, adding, [...] "It's both inexplicable and sad this brain-damaged yet fiercely determined little drive-in bottom feeder never garnered more than a tiny cult following over the years". A 1978 critique in The Review of the News said, [...] "Films like The Incredible Melting Man are not made to be good; they are made to be scary. For anyone looking to raise goosebumps on their flesh, this one is sufficient to give you your money's worth". Matt Maiellaro, co-creator of the Cartoon Network series Aqua Teen Hunger Force, said the film inspired him to start making films himself, adding, [...] "When I was eight, <b>I</b> <b>watched</b> <b>The</b> Incredible Melting Man and knew that horror movies were going to be big religion in my life". Z movie director Tim Ritter said he was partially inspired to enter show business by watching a trailer for The Incredible Melting Man at age 9. Ritter said, [...] "I was too young to see the movie, but the trailer really got into my imagination".|$|E
500|$|Thematically, {{influences}} behind The Operative: No One Lives Forever {{were primarily}} 1960s spy-themed films, novels, television shows, {{as well as}} historical references. When {{it was decided that}} NOLF {{was going to be a}} 1960s spy game, lead designer Craig Hubbard started immersing himself in the subject matter, in order to [...] "develop some fluency" [...] in it. As he explained, he [...] "was a big fan of early Bond films, but didn't know a lot about the whole spy craze. So <b>I</b> <b>watched</b> <b>the</b> Derek Flint movies , Modesty Blaise, Matt Helm, , Avengers – anything I could get my hands on." [...] Other influences included books, such as The Spy Who Came in from the Cold, TV shows like The Saint, The Pink Panther films, commando movies, such as The Guns of Navarone, as well as [...] "lots of historical references, encompassing everything from books and documentaries on the spy trade to fashion catalogs and interior-design books." [...] The basis for the biological explosives plot was the 1967 film Casino Royale. According to Hubbard, [...] "the idea was to create a game that would make you feel like a superspy, so we tried to come up with situations, characters, and settings to support that goal." [...] During the course of the game, the player can hear explicit popular culture references, including the TV series The Prisoner and The Fugitive, the Matt Helm films The Silencers and The Ambushers, and exotica musicians Les Baxter and Sondi Sodsai. Other conversations allude to major events of the time, such as the studio years of The Beatles, and the commercial failure of the Edsel automobile.|$|E
500|$|The {{video was}} chosen by fans, in a Billboard poll for Madonna's best videos, as her sixth best effort of all time, in honor of her 54th birthday. At the 2013 International Dance Music Awards, the video was {{nominated}} in the categories of Best Dance Music Video and Best Pop Music Video, but failed to win either of them. Shortly after [...] "Girl Gone Wild"s release to YouTube on March 21, 2012, the video was rated by many viewers as inappropriate. This caused YouTube to set an age restriction, only allowing those of age 18 or older to view the video. According to the website, the video was labeled explicit because of the [...] "raunchy" [...] and [...] "orgy" [...] scenes, thereby blocking it from getting uploaded to the singer's Vevo account. YouTube also asked Madonna's representative to upload a more PG-rated version. Madonna later commented, [...] "What's wrong with... what grinding? I'm {{supposed to be a}} 'girl gone wild' in the video—how can I go wild and not grind? This is the question that people should be asking." [...] During her interview with Jimmy Fallon on Facebook, Madonna jokingly confessed that if she were president, [...] "There would be no restrictions whatsoever on any of my videos, ever". Jane Martinson of The Guardian expressed her disappointment with the ban, since she felt there were far more provocative content in YouTube than Madonna's video. Martinson also noted that the semi-nudity in question came from the men featured in the clip, and felt that Madonna had turned Francis' concept of girls going wild, to [...] " [...] can also be the ones in control. <b>I</b> <b>watched</b> <b>the</b> video ready to slate her and came away thinking, after 30 years Madonna can still show Rihanna how sex and music can subvert expectations." ...|$|E
