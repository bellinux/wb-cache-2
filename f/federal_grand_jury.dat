The main suspects identified by the FBI have all since died due to old age.|$|R
25|$|<b>Federal</b> <b>grand</b> <b>juries</b> in Cleveland and Washington, D.C., soon opened {{investigations}} into the FBI's handling of the Presser case as well as whether the promises made by FBI agents had been authorized. Justice Department leaders eventually undertook a prosecution {{of one of the}} FBI field agents who handled Presser, claiming that he had not been authorized to give Presser permission to engage in the payroll-padding scheme.|$|R
5|$|The case {{began when}} the {{investigation}} of an automobile rollover accident during Mateen Cleaves' 1996 Michigan Wolverines recruiting trip revealed a curious relationship between Martin and the team. Several Michigan basketball players were implicated {{over the next few}} years and by 1999 several were called before a <b>federal</b> <b>grand</b> <b>jury.</b> Four eventual professional basketball players (Chris Webber, Maurice Taylor, Robert Traylor and Louis Bullock) were discovered to have borrowed a total of $616,000 from Martin. During the investigation, Webber claimed not to have had any financial relationship with Martin. Eventually he confessed to having accepted some of the money he was charged with having borrowed. For his perjury during a <b>federal</b> <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> investigation, he was both fined in the legal system and briefly suspended by National Basketball Association after performing public service.|$|E
5|$|While {{living in}} Aruba five years earlier, Van der Sloot {{had been the}} prime suspect in the {{disappearance}} of American teenager Natalee Holloway, who disappeared in Aruba on 30 May 2005. He was indicted by a <b>federal</b> <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> in the U.S. for wire fraud and extortion related to Holloway's whereabouts. Holloway's disappearance remains unsolved.|$|E
5|$|On December 9, 1987, Stella Nickell {{was indicted}} by a <b>federal</b> <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> on five counts of product tampering, {{including}} two {{which resulted in}} the deaths of Susan Snow and Bruce Nickell, and arrested the same day. She went on trial in April, 1988 and was found guilty of all charges on May 9, after five days of jury deliberation.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the county <b>grand</b> <b>juries</b> in California, {{at least twice a}} year, the state impanels several <b>Federal</b> <b>Grand</b> <b>Juries.</b> The summons arrive in the mail just like regular jury summons. Jurors are requested to come on a certain date to be impaneled on the jury. There are over 500 people that attend this impanelment and multiple <b>grand</b> <b>juries</b> are chosen at this time. When the juries are chosen there are at least 50 alternates chosen as well. Each <b>Grand</b> <b>Jury</b> has 23 members and are expected to attend jury service one day per week for the time impaneled.|$|R
5000|$|After Fuller and McGee gave [...] "sensational" [...] full {{disclosures}} to {{the police}} on bucketshop operations in early August 1923, Federal authorities put both men in seclusion, to protect against [...] "attack by gunman {{who may have been}} employed by men fearing exposure." [...] The August <b>Federal</b> <b>Grand</b> <b>Jury's</b> investigation into Fuller and Mcgee's confessions was completed on August 27, 1923, with indictments drawn up the next day in the Federal Building.|$|R
50|$|The {{rules are}} very similar to the <b>federal</b> process; the <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> usually only hears from law {{enforcement}} personnel, with the exception of property crimes, where store detectives or actual victims of theft or vandalism are called to testify. The only cases brought to the <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> are those initiated from the Commonwealth's Attorney's office (the prosecutor for felonies). For the vast majority of cases, the grand jurors generally only hear a recitation of facts from the police report, crime laboratory & medical examiner reports, and other documentation generated during the evidence gathering process. Grand jurors can ask factual questions of the witnesses and legal questions of the Commonwealth's Attorney or Assistant Commonwealth's Attorney. The ability to broaden or narrow indictments does technically allow for <b>grand</b> <b>juries</b> to open new avenues of investigation, although since it is dependent on prosecutors for facts, this is very rarely done. Rules of confidentiality that apply to Kentucky grand jurors are similar to those that apply to <b>federal</b> <b>grand</b> <b>juries.</b>|$|R
5|$|On January 19, 2011, a <b>federal</b> <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> {{handed down}} an {{indictment}} for three counts against Loughner for {{the attempt to}} assassinate Representative Giffords, and attempting to kill two federal employees, her aides Ron Barber and Pamela Simon. Loughner was indicted on additional charges of murder and attempted murder on March 3, {{for a total of}} 49 counts.|$|E
5|$|On March 11, 1994 FBI agents {{executed}} {{a search warrant}} to confiscate records from the Cook County Board of (Tax) Appeals {{as part of an}} ongoing investigation. Weeks later, federal agents investigating ghost payrolling subpoenaed financial records regarding several past and current employees of the Board, including Berrios and Panayotovich. The US Treasury Department investigated the IDOT contracts with Berrios and Panayotovich, and a <b>federal</b> <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> subpoenaed the contracts. A <b>federal</b> <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> in Chicago subpoenaed records documenting the recipients of tuition waivers to state universities request by three current and two former state legislators, including Berrios and Panayotovich. The scholarship program, begun in 1905, allowed each state legislator to waive the tuition and fees of any of the state's 12 public universities, for any two students who live within the legislator's district, without regard to academic achievement or financial need. No charges were filed against anyone in the Cook County Board of (Tax) Appeals. The Cook County Board of (Tax) Appeals was reconstituted and renamed the Cook County Board of Review in 1998.|$|E
5|$|A <b>federal</b> <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri {{was already}} {{investigating}} the Brooks Brokerage Company, with which Dennis, the President of Rialto, was associated. Witnesses against Burton {{at the grand}} jury included Chief Post Office Inspector William E. Cochran, Dennis, and W.B. Mehaney, the Vice President of Rialto. About two weeks before Burton's indictment, the grand jury came into possession of the checks from Rialto to Burton.|$|E
50|$|In the 1950s, Wheeler {{became a}} dairy farmer in Washington state {{because he was}} unable to find {{teaching}} work. Wheeler was subpoenaed as a hostile witness before <b>federal</b> <b>grand</b> <b>juries</b> in Washington, D.C., and San Francisco, leaving his pregnant wife and four children to milk the cows. He was also summoned three times before the House Un-American Activities Committee. His sister, Margaret Jean Schuddakopf, said that his courage and steadfastness was her beacon as she fought her own battle for the right to teach.|$|R
50|$|Al-Arian was subpoenaed {{three times}} to testify in terrorism-related {{investigations}} before Virginia <b>federal</b> <b>grand</b> <b>juries</b> between 2006 and 2008. Each time, he refused to testify. He challenged the initial subpoena in four different federal courts, each of which held {{that he was in}} fact required to testify. He was imprisoned for 13 months for civil contempt for failing to testify in compliance with the first subpoena, later released on house arrest and eventually placed on daytime GPS monitoring. On June 27, 2014, all charges were dropped regarding his refusal to testify in <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> proceedings. Per his 2006 plea agreement he was deported to Turkey on February 5, 2015.|$|R

5|$|Ed Martin {{died of a}} {{suspected}} pulmonary embolism on February 14, 2003. He was awaiting sentencing {{at the time of}} his death. Malvo, who confessed to taking bets and paying off winning wagers for Martin, pleaded guilty April 8, 2002 to lying before a <b>federal</b> <b>grand</b> <b>jury.</b> He admitted to telling a grand jury in October 1999 that he bet money but did not work for Martin. He was sentenced in August 2002 to two years' probation.|$|E
5|$|Four {{months after}} his {{acquittal}} in Birmingham, Scrushy was indicted along with former Alabama Governor Don Siegelman on October 28, 2005, by a <b>federal</b> <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> in Montgomery, Alabama. The indictment included 30 counts of money laundering, extortion, obstruction of justice, racketeering, and bribery. Although the new charges were filed {{a month before the}} previous trial ended, Scrushy's attorneys accused prosecutors of filing charges as retaliation for Scrushy's acquittal. Scrushy pleaded not guilty to all charges, but was convicted along with Siegelman in June 2006.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, Bonds {{first became}} {{embroiled in a}} scandal when Greg Anderson of the Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative (BALCO), Bonds's trainer since 2000, was indicted by a <b>federal</b> <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California and charged with {{supplying}} anabolic steroids to athletes, including a number of baseball players. This led to speculation that Bonds had used performance-enhancing drugs {{during a time when}} there was no mandatory testing in Major League Baseball. Bonds declared his innocence, attributing his changed physique and increased power to a strict regimen of bodybuilding, diet, and legitimate supplements.|$|E
50|$|An {{investigation}} was reopened in 1999. A San Francisco <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> {{looked into the}} incident, but the results were not immediately made public. Secret <b>federal</b> <b>grand</b> <b>juries</b> were convened in 2001 and again in 2009 to re-open the Park Precinct cold case {{in an attempt to}} again tie WUO members to the deadly bombing. Ultimately, it was concluded that members of the Black Liberation Army, whom WUO members affiliated with while underground, were responsible for not only this action but also the bombing of another police precinct in San Francisco as well as bombing the Catholic Church funeral services of the police officer killed in the Park Precinct bombing in the early summer of 1970.|$|R
50|$|Her {{murder was}} {{investigated}} by the BIA, who started the investigation as the death appeared {{to have taken place}} on the reservation. The FBI became involved because of its interest in AIM. It was learned that she had been seen at the Pine Ridge Reservation before her disappearance in December 1975. <b>Federal</b> <b>grand</b> <b>juries</b> were called to hear testimony in her case in 1976, 1982 and 1994, but no indictments were made. In 1997 Paul DeMain, editor of the independent newspaper News From Indian Country, started regularly publishing articles about the investigation of the murder of Aquash.|$|R
50|$|George M. Bain, Jr. {{was indicted}} by a <b>federal</b> {{criminal}} <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> and subsequently convicted {{for making a}} false report or statement as cashier of a bank under U.S. Rev.

5|$|On September 20, 2007, federal {{prosecutors}} charged the Jew with {{one count of}} mail fraud in connection with extorting $80,000 from Quickly. Jew denied any wrongdoing. He questioned what influence he could have over the issuing of permits, and reiterated his refusal to resign his position, despite insistence from Mayor Gavin Newsom. On November 7, 2007, a <b>federal</b> <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> added five felony charges, including two counts each of bribery and mail fraud and one count of extortion. He was also accused of accepting $4,000 in cash from the owner of another local business, Wonderful Desserts and Cafe. Jew {{pleaded not guilty to}} all charges.|$|E
5|$|In October 1988, Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos, {{together}} with eight associates (including Adnan Khashoggi, a Saudi Arabian businessman and weapons smuggler {{believed to have}} been involved with her husband's regime), were indicted by a <b>federal</b> <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> in Manhattan on charges of racketeering, conspiracy, fraud and obstruction of justice. Tobacco heiress Doris Duke posted $5 million bail for the former First Lady. The Marcos couple's defense team was led by criminal defense attorney Gerry Spence. Actor George Hamilton, an unindicted co-conspirator, testified at trial under a grant of immunity, acknowledging that he had received a $5.5-million loan from an associate of hers. In July 1990, following a three-month trial, she was acquitted of all charges. By that time, Ferdinand had died in exile in Hawaii on 28 September 1989.|$|E
5|$|Other {{inquiries}} obtained similar {{testimony from}} witnesses, including {{the taxi driver}} who now stated that the activists were “alive and disarmed” when the police removed him from the scene. The taxi driver stated {{that there was a}} short exchange of gunfire, and when he was removed to another place nearby he heard a second volley of gunfire, but was asked by the police and investigators of the PR Justice Department to forget about the second round of shots. The statement regarding two different volleys of shots was upheld by various people, including ex-officer Jesus Quiñones before a <b>Federal</b> <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> (he quit the force shortly after the shootings), and three other civilian witnesses in a San Juan Star interview.|$|E
5000|$|Abramoff {{was under}} {{investigation}} by <b>federal</b> <b>grand</b> <b>juries</b> for {{his involvement in the}} multimillion-dollar defrauding of Native American tribes who were his lobbying clients, and related bribery of public officials. On January 3, 2006, Abramoff pled guilty to three felony counts: conspiracy, fraud, and tax evasion (Abramoff owes the Internal Revenue Service $1.7 million for that charge). In addition, Abramoff and other defendants must make restitution of at least $25 million USD that was defrauded from clients, most notably the Native American tribes. Abramoff's guilty plea was part of a plea deal that requires him to cooperate in the ongoing investigation of his role in congressional corruption.|$|R
50|$|Whereas the Most Wanted Terrorists list is {{reserved}} for terrorist fugitives who have been indicted by <b>federal</b> <b>grand</b> <b>juries,</b> the FBI recognized a further need to achieve a much quicker response {{time in order to}} prevent any future attacks which may be in the current planning stages. To enlist the public's help in this effort, the FBI sought a way to deliver the early known suspected terror attack information, often very limited, out to the public as quickly as possible. So, on January 17, 2002, the third major FBI wanted list was first released, which has now become known as the FBI Seeking Information - War on Terrorism list.|$|R
5000|$|After {{decades of}} {{investigation}} and the hearing of testimony by three <b>federal</b> <b>grand</b> <b>juries,</b> in March 2003, Arlo Looking Cloud and John Graham (also known as John Boy Patton) were indicted {{for the murder of}} Aquash. Looking Cloud was convicted in 2004 and Graham in 2010; both received life sentences. Thelma Rios was indicted along with John Graham, but she pleaded guilty to charges as an accessory to the kidnapping. In 2008 Vine Richard [...] "Dick" [...] Marshall was charged with aiding the murder, but was acquitted of providing the gun. Numerous Aquash supporters and her daughters believe that higher-level AIM officials ordered her murder, fearing she was an FBI informant.|$|R
5|$|The {{captain and}} most of the crew of the shipall {{nationals}} of the Philippineshad to face a U.S. Coast Guard Board of Inquiry, which required them to remain in the United States for several weeks after the wreck. In addition, a <b>federal</b> <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> investigated the incident for criminal wrongdoing. Captain Morgado refused to answer many of the questions posed at the inquiry, citing his Fifth Amendment rights. The crew was released after their testimony and returned to the Philippines. On September 16, the Coast Guard issued its findings that captain's error was the primary cause of the wreck, with the first and third officers of the ship also partly responsible. The investigation found no evidence of criminal wrongdoing, and no charges were filed against any member of the New Carissa crew.|$|E

5|$|The {{leaders of}} the strike, {{including}} McMenamin and Carney, were charged in federal court under the SmithConnally Act; some thirty strikers were also indicted later. The <b>federal</b> <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> was convened on August 9 and heard testimony for two months. However, the grand jury returned inconclusive findings; their report stated {{that most of the}} striking workers knew nothing about the strike at the start, and blamed a few instigators for escalating the situation, but did not detail the instigators' activities. The report was also critical of the PTC's response to the strike, characterizing it as inadequate and ineffective. The government dropped its charges against the defendants on March 12, 1945, with most of them pleading nolo contendere and receiving a fine of $100 each.|$|E
50|$|The {{existence}} of a U.S. <b>federal</b> investigation and <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> based in Brooklyn was first made public in November 2014 by The New York Daily News.|$|R
50|$|All violent offenses against Indians {{should be}} treated as federal crimes and the persons {{committing}} the crimes must face penalties under federal prosecution. Congress should also create a national <b>federal</b> Indian <b>grand</b> <b>jury.</b> This <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> should consist only of Indians that are chosen by the President as well as by Indian people. In addition this jury will have jurisdiction over non-Indian peoples living on Indian reservations.|$|R
40|$|The <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> {{practice}} of naming individuals as unindicted co-conspirators routinely results in injury to reputations, lost employment opportunities, and a practical inability {{to run for}} public office. Yet, because these individuals are not parties to a criminal trial, they have neither the right to present evidence nor the opportunity to clear their names. Thus, Professor Robbins argues that the practice violates the Fifth Amendment guarantee that 2 ̆ 2 [n]o person shall... be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law[. ] 2 ̆ 2 While prosecutors may offer many justifications to support the {{practice of}} naming unindicted co-conspirators, these reasons do not withstand careful scrutiny. Legitimate governmental objectives can be met in other ways. Professor Robbins concludes that Congress should breathe life into the traditional 2 ̆ 2 shielding 2 ̆ 2 function of <b>federal</b> <b>grand</b> <b>juries</b> and prohibit the use of unindicted co-conspirators 2 ̆ 7 real names in <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> indictments...|$|R
