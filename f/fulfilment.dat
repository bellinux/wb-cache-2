5|$|The Gospel of Matthew {{claims that}} the {{subsequent}} purchase of the Potter's field was <b>fulfilment,</b> by Jesus, of a prophecy of Zechariah.|$|E
5|$|Cultural {{attitudes toward}} gender roles have {{profound}} effects on people with SCI. The injury can cause insecurities surrounding sexual identity, {{particularly if the}} disability precludes <b>fulfilment</b> of societally taught gender norms.|$|E
5|$|Devotees offer abhishek, {{a ritual}} of pouring water {{on to the}} murti of Nilkanth Varni, and express their reverence and prayers for spiritual upliftment and <b>fulfilment</b> of wishes.|$|E
5|$|These points can {{be applied}} to the {{structure}} of The Waste Land, though there is not necessarily a <b>fulfilment</b> of these but merely a longing or discussion of them.|$|E
5|$|A {{battalion}} of the 121st Home Guard Regiment entered Hrvatska Kostajnica, while the 24th Home Guard Regiment battlegroup secured the national border behind them. The 52nd Home Guard Regiment {{connected with the}} Zagreb Corps and then turned south to the town, reaching it that evening. The capture of Hrvatska Kostajnica marked the <b>fulfilment</b> {{of all of the}} Bjelovar Corps' objectives.|$|E
5|$|Although Operation Backstop {{was within}} the UNPROFOR mandate (since the peacekeepers were {{authorised}} {{to use force to}} prevent armed incursions into the UNPAs), Croatian authorities resented the operation. Croatia considered the UNPROFOR overzealous in defending the UNPAs and protecting the Serbs while failing to ensure the <b>fulfilment</b> of other aspects of the Vance plan, such as the return of refugees to their homes.|$|E
5|$|Around 1497, while {{continuing}} {{with his work}} on the Caesars, Cairano also developed five keystones for portico of the Loggia palazzo, representing Sant'Apollonio, San Faustino, San Giovita, Justice and Faith. Between 1499 and 1500, he delivered two large trophies to be placed on the top order of palazzo, while between 1493 and 1505, Cairano participated in the <b>fulfilment</b> of leonine protome, capitals, and candelabras and friezes for the same top order. The attention of the artist to his craft and productions is evident, and it influenced in general all the decorative sculptural works made for the palazzo at the time.|$|E
5|$|Bishop {{received}} several honorary titles and fellowships during her career. In 1932, she was appointed a Yallow Fellow of Girton College, an honour she held {{until her death}} in 1990. Bishop was also a Beit Fellow from 1929 to 1932. The Medical Research Council awarded her a grant in 1937 that sparked her study of Plasmodium. In 1945 and 1947, {{she was involved in}} organising Girton College's Working Women's Summer School, an institution designed to provide intellectual <b>fulfilment</b> for women whose formal education ended at the age of 14. She was elected to the Royal Society in 1959, and at one point {{was a member of the}} Malaria Committee of the World Health Organization.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{projects}} such as these constituted only the most visible part of Domitian's religious policy, which also concerned itself with the <b>fulfilment</b> of religious law and public morals. In 85, he nominated himself perpetual censor, the office that held the task of supervising Roman morals and conduct. Once again, Domitian acquitted himself of this task dutifully, and with care. He renewed the Lex Iulia de Adulteriis Coercendis, under which adultery was punishable by exile. From the list of jurors he struck an equestrian who had divorced his wife and taken her back, while an ex-quaestor was expelled from the Senate for acting and dancing.|$|E
5|$|In terukkuttu performances, at {{the time}} of Aravan's sacrifice, he is often {{compared}} to Puru and Bhishma, characters in the Mahabharata who gave up their youth and sexual <b>fulfilment</b> for the sake of their respective fathers, Yayati and Santanu. In the drama, after acquiring Aravan's approval, Krishna approaches Aravan's mother, Ulupi—Nagakanni or Nakakanni ("Serpent maiden") in Tamil, for her consent. At first she strongly opposes her son's proposed sacrifice but finally relents when Aravan appeals to her, explaining that he belongs to Kali alone.|$|E
5|$|On 1 September 1939, Germany invaded Poland; {{two days}} later, Britain and France {{declared}} war on Germany, launching the Second World War. Within three weeks, the Red Army of the Soviet Union invaded the eastern regions of Poland in <b>fulfilment</b> of the secret Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact with Germany. A British Expeditionary Force (BEF) {{was sent to the}} Franco-Belgian border, but Britain and France did not take any direct action in support of the Poles. By 1 October, Poland had been completely overrun.|$|E
5|$|The first {{cross on}} the {{mountain}} was placed there in 1643 by Paul Chomedey de Maisonneuve, {{the founder of the}} city, in <b>fulfilment</b> of a vow he made to the Virgin Mary when praying to her to stop a disastrous flood. Today, the mountain is crowned by a 31.4 m-high (103ft) illuminated cross, installed in 1924 by the John the Baptist Society and now owned by the city. It was converted to fibre optic light in 1992. The new system can turn the lights red, blue, or purple, the last of which is used as a sign of mourning between the death of the Pope and the election of the next.|$|E
5|$|UNCRO was {{tasked with}} {{upholding}} the March 1994 ceasefire in the Croatian War of Independence, supporting {{an agreement on}} economic cooperation between Croatia and the self-declared Republic of Serbian Krajina (RSK), monitoring areas between opposing armies, monitoring the demilitarised Prevlaka peninsula, undertaking liaison functions, delivering humanitarian aid, and occupying 25 checkpoints along Croatia's international borders between RSK-held territory, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina. UNCRO, like the UNPROFOR mission before it, was criticised for lacking sufficient troops and adequate resources {{to carry out the}} mission, and <b>fulfilment</b> of the mission's mandate proved nearly impossible.|$|E
5|$|When Macbeth {{returns to}} the witches later in the play, they show him an {{apparition}} of the murdered Banquo, along with eight kings of his family, descending through Fleance. King James, on the throne when Macbeth was written, was the ninth Stuart king. This scene thus suggests strong support for James' right to the throne by lineage, and for audiences of Shakespeare's day, was a tangible <b>fulfilment</b> of the witches' prophecy. The apparition is also deeply unsettling to Macbeth, who not only wants the throne for himself, but also desires to father a line of kings.|$|E
5|$|When Macbeth {{returns to}} the witches later in the play, they show him an {{apparition}} of the murdered Banquo, along with eight of his descendants. The scene carries deep significance: King James, on the throne when Macbeth was written, {{was believed to be}} separated from Banquo by nine generations. What Shakespeare writes here thus amounts to a strong support of James' right to the throne by lineage, and for audiences of Shakespeare's day, a very real <b>fulfilment</b> of the witches' prophecy to Banquo that his sons would take the throne. This apparition is also deeply unsettling to Macbeth, who not only wants the throne for himself, but also desires to father a line of kings.|$|E
5|$|Among Hindus, Shashthi {{is widely}} {{regarded}} the benefactor and protector of children and tutelary deity of every household. She is also worshipped as a bestower of children to the childless, and regarded as the foremost goddess for blessing children. One of the earliest scriptural sources to describe a ritual in her honour is the second century BCE composition Manava Grhya Sutra, appended to the Yajurveda (written between the 14th and 10th centuries BCE), which describes a ritual called Shashthi-kalpa. In the Shashthi-kalpa rite, which was described as performed on the sixth lunar day of every fortnight, Shashthi was invoked to provide sons, cattle, treasures, corn, and the <b>fulfilment</b> of wishes. Today, Shashthi continues to be worshipped on the sixth day {{of each of the}} twelve lunar months of the Hindu calendar, {{as well as on the}} sixth day after childbirth in the lying-in chamber where the birth has taken place. Shashthi is worshipped in a different form in each of these lunar months as the deities Chandan, Aranya, Kardama, Lunthana, Chapeti, Durga, Nadi, Mulaka, Anna, Sitala, Gorupini or Ashoka.|$|E
5|$|Because {{value added}} tax (VAT) {{has not been}} levied in the island, luxury goods have often been cheaper than in the UK or in France, {{providing}} an incentive for tourism from neighbouring countries. The absence of VAT has also led {{to the growth of}} the <b>fulfilment</b> industry, whereby low-value luxury items, such as videos, lingerie and contact lenses are exported, avoiding VAT on arrival and thus undercutting local prices on the same products. In 2005, the States of Jersey announced limits on licences granted to non-resident companies trading in this way. Low-value consignment relief provided the mechanism for VAT-free imports from the Channel Islands to the UK until 1 April 2012, at which time this policy of the UK government was binned.|$|E
5|$|Divided {{into five}} stanzas of ten lines each, the ode {{contains}} a narrator's discourse {{on a series}} of designs on a Grecian urn. The poem focuses on two scenes: one in which a lover eternally pursues a beloved without <b>fulfilment,</b> and another of villagers about to perform a sacrifice. The final lines of the poem declare that beauty is truth, truth beauty,' – that is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know", and literary critics have debated whether they increase or diminish the overall beauty of the poem. Critics have focused on other aspects of the poem, including the role of the narrator, the inspirational qualities of real-world objects, and the paradoxical relationship between the poem's world and reality.|$|E
5|$|In 1513, Gasparem de Cayrano de Mediolano lapicida architectum et ingeniarum optimum {{signed the}} {{contract}} {{for the construction of}} a new entrance to the Duomo of Chiari. The document, a reconfirmation of an earlier negotiation, shows that the artist and the municipality had agreed terms two years earlier, but the plans hadn't been executed because of the war in the Brescia area. The contract provided for the <b>fulfilment</b> of the entire project - from the architectural parts to the figurative sculptures, including a group with the Madonna between the Saints Faustino and Giovita. These are now missing, so it's impossible to assess the evolution of Cairano's art after the completion of the ark of Sant'Appollonio. The rest of the work, moreover, again raise questions about the architectural skills of the artist that are still unanswered.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{successful}} aircraft engines of the World War II era, some fifty marks of Merlin were built by Rolls-Royce in Derby, Crewe and Glasgow, as well as by Ford of Britain at their Trafford Park factory, near Manchester. A de-rated version was also the basis of the very successful Rolls-Royce/Rover Meteor tank engine. Post-war, the Merlin was largely superseded by the Rolls-Royce Griffon for military use, with most Merlin variants being designed and built for airliners and military transport aircraft. Production ceased in 1956 with the <b>fulfilment</b> of an order for 170 Merlins for the Spanish Air Force's CASA 2.111 and Hispano Aviación HA-1112 aircraft, after 160,000 engines had been delivered. In addition, the Packard V-1650 was a version of the Merlin built in the United States, itself produced in numbers upwards of 55,000 examples, and was the principal engine used in the North American P-51 Mustang.|$|E
5|$|Saint Augustine {{offered a}} version of divine command theory that began by casting ethics as {{the pursuit of the}} supreme good, which {{delivers}} human happiness. He argued that to achieve this happiness, humans must love objects that are worthy of human love in the correct manner; this requires humans to love God, which then allows them to correctly love that which is worthy of being loved. Augustine's ethics proposed that the act of loving God enables humans to properly orient their loves, leading to human happiness and <b>fulfilment.</b> Augustine supported Plato's view that a well-ordered soul is a desirable consequence of morality. However, unlike Plato, he believed that achieving a well-ordered soul had a higher purpose: living in accordance with God's commands. His view of morality was thus heteronomous, as he believed in deference to a higher authority (God), rather than acting autonomously.|$|E
5|$|Seeking better {{performance}} and <b>fulfilment</b> of the Air Ministry Specification E.38/46, Sydney Camm designed the Hawker P.1052, which {{was essentially a}} Sea Hawk outfitted with a 35-degree swept wing. Performing its first flight in 1948, the P.1052 demonstrated good performance and conducted several carrier trials, but was ultimately determined to not warrant further development into a production aircraft. As a private venture, Hawker proceeded to convert the second P.1052 prototype into the Hawker P.1081 with swept tailplanes, a revised fuselage, and a single jet exhaust at the rear. On 19June1950, the P.1081 conducted its maiden flight, and was promising enough to draw interest from the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF); however, further development was stalled by difficulties with the engine's reheat. In 1951, the sole P.1081 prototype was lost in a crash.|$|E
5|$|While Bahá'u'lláh did not himself {{directly}} {{claim to}} be either the Hindu or Buddhist messiah, he did so in principle through his writings. Later, `Abdu'l-Bahá stated that Bahá'u'lláh was the Kalki avatar, who in the classical Hindu Vaishnavas tradition is the tenth and final Avatar (great incarnation) of Vishnu who will come to end The Age of Darkness and Destruction. Bahá'ís also believe that Bahá'u'lláh is the <b>fulfilment</b> of the prophecy of appearance of the Maitreya Buddha, who is a future Buddha who will eventually appear on earth, achieve complete enlightenment, and teach the pure Dharma. Bahá'ís believe that the prophecy that Maitreya will usher in a new society of tolerance and love has been fulfilled by Bahá'u'lláh's teachings on world peace. Bahá'u'lláh {{is believed to be}} a descendant of a long line of kings in Persia through Yazdgerd III, the last monarch of the Sasanian Dynasty; he also asserted to be a descendant of Abraham through his third wife Keturah.|$|E
25|$|Opponents of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad {{are largely}} silent about this prophecy. Others among his opponents {{state that the}} <b>fulfilment</b> of the prophecy is coincidental.|$|E
25|$|Gervais and co-writer Stephen Merchant made a {{film called}} Cemetery Junction, set in 1970s Britain, about class, love and <b>fulfilment.</b> The film was {{released}} in April 2010.|$|E
25|$|This <b>fulfilment</b> of {{function}} depends on {{all parts of}} an organism cohering and co-operating. This was {{what he called the}} 'Law of Help,' one of Ruskin's fundamental beliefs, extending from nature and art to society.|$|E
25|$|The general troop inspectorate is a {{separate}} section of the ministry with responsibility for co-ordination and <b>fulfilment</b> of the missions of the armed forces. It encompasses a general staff department, an attaché department, and planning and inspection groups.|$|E
25|$|Marguerite Louise later {{asked her}} to sort out {{arrangements}} when the Grand Prince of Tuscany proposed an alliance in 1658. Mademoiselle was asked to ensure its <b>fulfilment,</b> a previous proposal from the Duke of Savoy having failed.|$|E
25|$|The port handles Suezmax tankers {{of up to}} a {{draft of}} 17m at BD3 during day light, high tide as the per the present navigational {{practice}} and also during night hours subject to <b>fulfilment</b> of safety considerations on a ship-to-ship basis.|$|E
25|$|Such {{societies}} were characterised {{by their}} small, human-scale communities, low-impact technologies, successful population controls, sustainable resource management, holistic and ecologically integrated worldviews {{and a high}} degree of social cohesion, physical health, psychological well-being and spiritual <b>fulfilment</b> of their members.|$|E
25|$|Through his mission, he {{followed}} and communicated {{the teachings of}} Chaitanya Mahaprabhu and introduced bhakti yoga to an international audience. Within Gaudiya Vaishnavism this was viewed as the <b>fulfilment</b> of a long time mission to introduce Caitanya Mahaprabhu's teachings to the world.|$|E
25|$|In Roman Dutch law, a {{fiduciary}} heir {{may receive}} property subject to passing {{it to another}} on <b>fulfilment</b> of certain conditions; the gift is called a fideicommissum. The fiduciary of a fideicommissum is a fideicommissioner and one that receives property from a fiduciary heir is a fideicommissary heir.|$|E
25|$|Hitchcock's film {{is about}} obsession, {{which means that}} it's about {{circling}} {{back to the same}} moment, again and again... And the music is also built around spirals and circles, <b>fulfilment</b> and despair. Herrmann really understood what Hitchcock was going for— he wanted to penetrate to the heart of obsession.|$|E
25|$|The {{third and}} final tribute is a book of Capaldi's {{handwritten}} lyrics, released in November 2011. The ideas of a boxed set and lyrics book had been conceived by Jim Capaldi shortly before he died, and their releases were prepared by his widow Aninha in <b>fulfilment</b> of a last promise to him.|$|E
25|$|Nazi Germany invaded and {{occupied}} Poland in September 1939. From the start, {{the war against}} Poland {{was intended to be}} the <b>fulfilment</b> of a plan described by Adolf Hitler in his book Mein Kampf. The main gist of the plan was for all of Eastern Europe to become part of a Greater Germany, the German Lebensraum ("living space").|$|E
25|$|In January 1949 Koestler and Mamaine {{moved to}} a house he had bought in France, where he wrote a {{contribution}} to The God That Failed and finished work on Promise and <b>Fulfilment.</b> The latter book received poor reviews in both the U.S. and the UK. His other book published in 1949 was Insight and Outlook. This too received lukewarm reviews.|$|E
