40|$|Despite {{extensive}} use, {{information on}} the bioavailability of elemental iron powders to humans, as influenced by dose and other dietary constituents, is limited. Three experiments were conducted to assess the absorption of electrolytic iron powder relative to FeSO 4, as affected by iron dose and by ascorbic or phytic acid. Iron absorption by 56 volunteers was measured from a farina cereal breakfast radiolabeled with 59 FeSO 4 or an electrolytic 55 Fe powder irradiated by neutron activation. Absorption was determined from whole-body counting (59 Fe) and blood isotope incorporation 2 wk later. Absorption of iron from the irradiated <b>electrolytic</b> <b>powder</b> was 5 – 15 % that of FeSO 4. Ascorbic acid (; 160 mg) enhanced iron absorption from FeSO 4 by almost 4 -fold but only doubled absorption from electrolytic iron (P for interaction, 0. 01). Phytic acid from wheat bran inhibited iron absorption from FeSO 4 and electrolytic iron by 73 and 50 %, respectively (P for interaction, NS). Compared with 3 mg, a 20 -mg dose reduced fractional absorption from FeSO 4, but not electrolytic iron (P for interaction, 0. 0001). Despite a much higher bioavailability (50 % relative to FeSO 4) of this same electrolytic iron when tested previously in a pig model, the bioavailability of the irradiated electrolytic iron was poor in humans. The diminished influence of ascorbic acid on the absorption of less soluble iron sources such as elemental iron powders {{may be an important}} consideration when choosing iron fortificants. J.

Cereal flours that are used shortly after production (e. g., baking flour) can be fortified with soluble iron compounds, such as ferrous sulfate, whereas the majority of flours stored for longer periods is usually fortified with elemental iron powders to avoid unacceptable sensory changes. Elemental iron powders are less well absorbed than soluble iron compounds and they vary widely in their absorption depending on manufacturing method and physicochemical characteristics.

After milling all powders were treated in H 2 at 4000 C for 1 h, and finally hot pressing was used for compaction (800 oC, 3 h, Ar).

Introduction The consideration of the electromagnetic robustness (EMR) of integrated circuits (IC) appeared in these last years, i. e. the evolution of parasitic emission and susceptibility to electromagnetic interferences with time for electronic devices working in harsh environments. Publications such as [1] have demonstrated that the electromagnetic emission (EME) of digital circuits and I/O buffers changes with time because of the activation of intrinsic degradation mechanisms. As presented in a few works, the simulation can be utilized to predict the long-term EMC behavior. For example, in [2], the simulation results confirmed the evolution of the electromagnetic susceptibility of a phase-locked loop before and after aging stress. A switch-mode power supply (SMPS) is selected as the device under test in this study. Because of their high power efficiency, switch-mode power supplies are widely used in electronic applications [3]. However, one main drawback of SMPS is the noise delivered by the switching activity, responsible for conducted and radiated electromagnetic emission. In this way, the management of the parasitic emission of SMPS is a frequent topic in the literature on electromagnetic compatibility (EMC). Various papers dealt with the origin and the modeling of electromagnetic emission, and also the development of design guidelines to improve these issues [4] [5]. Several recent studies presented the long-term behavior of SMPS. Due to the degradation of the electrolytic capacitor which is used to filter the output voltage of SMPS, an increase of the ripple of the output voltage of SMPS was illustrated in [6] [7]. Another consequence is the increase of electromagnetic emission, as shown in [8], where the increase of the EME of a DC-DC converter after thermal stress is associated with the degradation of output filtering passive devices, not only the capacitor but also the inductor in the output side. As a following study of [8], this paper focuses o...|$|R
