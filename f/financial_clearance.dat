50|$|In 2006, Iraklis was {{relegated to}} the Greek A2 Basket League, after {{finishing}} 13th in the first-tier Greek League. In 2010, after four seasons in the second-tier level Greek League, the team was promoted {{back up to the}} top-tier Greek Basket League. After one season in the Greek top-tier level, Iraklis was again relegated down to the A2, with two matches left in the season. At the end of the season, Iraklis chose to play in the third-tier level of Greek basketball, the Greek B Basket League, in order to clear its debts. The club was promoted to the Greek A2 Basket League in 2013, after finishing 2nd in its group, and after Peristeri failed to receive <b>financial</b> <b>clearance</b> to participate in the league.|$|E
50|$|Cannon {{was born}} Isabella McLean Bett Walton (daughter of Helen Bett Seamans and James Walton) on May 12, 1904, in 15 Downieville Crescent, Dunfermline, Scotland, {{and came to}} the United States with her family in 1916. After graduating from Winecoff High School in North Carolina, she {{attended}} Elon College where she received a Bachelor of Arts in English and Science in 1924. While working as a teacher at Elon College high school, she married Claude M. Cannon in 1924, who was a registrar and business manager at Elon College. In addition to working as a high school teacher, she encountered a variety of work experience, including her position as the mayor of Raleigh. She served {{as the director of the}} Elon College weekday experimental school of religious education from 1925 to 1928, worked as a cashier at the Elon Banking and Trust Company from 1928 to 1930, and later became an assistant registrar and manager of the college bookstore at Elon in 1932. Ten years later, she became a bookkeeper and payroll manager at WRAL Radio Station in Raleigh and worked until 1943. She then held a position as a supervisor with the French Supply Council in Washington D.C. from 1944 to 1945. For the next two years, she was an interviewer for overseas <b>financial</b> <b>clearance</b> for returning and terminating personnel in the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. From 1947 to 1954, she traveled overseas to Liberia, West Africa, and Iraq with her husband, Claude Cannon, who was serving in diplomatic service. After returning to the United States, he died in 1954 in Raleigh. Soon after, she became the director of the library at North Carolina State University and maintained her job for the next fifteen years.|$|E

5000|$|Despite the {{quantitative}} lean of modern sociology; Kilburn, Costanza, Borgeson and Metchik (2011) {{point out that}} there are several methodological barbs to effectively and scientifically assessing the effect of Homeland Security measures. [...] In traditional criminology, the most quantitatively amenable starting point for measuring the effectiveness of any policing strategy (i.e.: Neighborhood Watch, Gun Abatement, Foot Patrols, etc.) is to assess total <b>financial</b> costs against <b>clearance</b> rates or arrest rates. Since terrorism is such a rare event phenomena, measuring arrests would be a naive way to test policy effectiveness.|$|R

30|$|Colombo {{performs}} {{significantly better}} than Kelang and Tanjung Pelepas in terms of “connected feeder markets,” as it is located {{in close proximity to}} Indian sub-continent feeder ports. Colombo has the lowest performances for seven different criteria, namely “deviation time,” “records of damage,” “policies and regulations,” “IT and advanced technology,” “marketing effort,” “finance clearance capability,” and “position of hub port with shipping line’s services.” Although Colombo is currently undergoing major infrastructure development, the lower performance of Colombo cannot be completely addressed with only infrastructure development. In particular, criteria such as policy and regulations and <b>financial</b> <b>clearance</b> capability must be considered by port authorities since they are strategic responsibilities. Moreover, since the availability of IT and advanced technologies indicates a lower performance, IT should be improved to enhance competitiveness.|$|E
50|$|In intelligence-led policing(ILP) efforts, {{the most}} quantitatively {{amenable}} {{starting point for}} measuring the effectiveness of any policing strategy (i.e.: Neighborhood Watch, Gun Abatement, Foot Patrols, etc.) is usually to assess total <b>financial</b> costs against <b>clearance</b> rates or arrest rates. Since terrorism is such a rare event phenomena, measuring arrests or clearance rates would be a non-generalizable and ineffective way to test enforcement policy effectiveness. Another methodological problem in assessing counter-terrorism efforts in law enforcement hinges on finding operational measures for key concepts {{in the study of}} homeland security. Both terrorism and homeland security are relatively new concepts for criminologists, and academicians have yet to agree on the matter of how to properly define these ideas {{in a way that is}} accessible.|$|R
50|$|After the club's relegation {{and a final}} {{attempt to}} vindicate without much effort, Piladakis began {{building}} the team that would return immediately in the Super League. He hired the experienced and reputable coach in the English grounds Chris Coleman and along with him players of International range like Zequinha, The famous Portuguese midfielder Luís Boa Morte, the Brazilian winger Césinha and many others.. The course of the team in the 2011-12 season started with the best omens, but soon all would be reversed. Financial problems that piled, appeared again and eventually led the coach {{and many of the}} players to the exit. Rupture between the owner and the organized fans substantially undermined the future of the team. Piladakis resigned and the club without any administration and financial support, deliberately relegated in the 3rd Division. A move that is used by many football teams in Greece and was based in a <b>financial</b> law (special <b>clearance),</b> made to ensure the deletion of the previous debts, as teams that competing in the 3rd Category are considered amateur. In the summer of 2013, Evangelos Plexidas, a local businessman from Trikala took over and promised immediate return. Although the team indeed promoted relatively easily from the 3rd category and also won the Greek 3rd Category Cup, and the 2013-14 Amateurs' Super Cup many incorrect choices about the team's administration and management were not accepted by the fans. The changing of 6 coaches in a single season (2014-15) and the leaving of almost 15 players (although the team managed to participate in the Football League Play-Offs but failed to promote), created again a poor situation that led the major shareholder in the decision to sell the majority stake of his shares to Alexis Kougias, a well-known Greek lawyer and football administrator in July 2015. A year later, on 15 May 2016, the team finally gained the promotion into the Super League. In clear contrast with the last time, however, there was little enthusiasm among the fans, as Kougias had longtime conflicts with them as well as the local community and veterans of the team. The first season back in top flight was a difficult one, with 3 managers employed : Sakis Tsiolis left almost immediately after the club's promotion on June 2, 2016 only to return 5 months later and replace Angelos Anastasiadis who took over after him the previous summer.. He managed to keep his place on the bench until March 21, 2017 when he resigned for personal reasons. After 1 match coached by careteker Theodoros Voutiritsas, Alexis Kougias hired the Dutch André Paus the club's current manager. Thus, despite relative financial stability the team struggled on and off the pitch, yet managed to keep its top flight status by finishing 13th, just above the relegation places.|$|R
