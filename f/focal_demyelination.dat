However, very {{little is known about}} possible differences in damage and distribution that may occur within lesions visible on magnetic resonance imaging in the 2 forms of the disease. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate differences in spatial distribution and structural damage of focal demyelinating lesions in patients with PPMS and RRMS. DESIGN: We acquired conventional magnetic resonance and magnetization transfer images in 24 PPMS and 36 RRMS patients (matched for sex, age, and disease duration) and 23 healthy sex- and age-matched controls. In each participant, we measured T 2 - and T 1 -weighted lesion volumes and magnetization transfer ratios in lesional and nonlesional brain tissues. The spatial distribution of <b>focal</b> <b>demyelination</b> was assessed using T 2 - and T 1 -weighted lesion probability maps in each patient group. Voxel-based procedures were performed. SETTING: University hospital. RESULTS: Patients with PPMS had greater disability than those with RRMS, with 70 % of PPMS patients and 11 % of RRMS patients having relevant motor symptoms. The T 1 - and T 2 -weighted lesion volumes were higher in PPMS than in RRMS patients (P <. 001). T 1 - and T 2 -weighted lesion probability maps showed that the maximum probability for lesions was higher in PPMS (peak probability, 45 % and 29 %, respectively) than in RRMS (peak probability, 33 % and 19 %, respectively) patients and was localized in the corona radiata. Voxelwise analysis of lesional magnetization transfer ratios gave overlapping results.

Methods We identified signal abnormalities in the SCC in three non-epileptic patients, {{all of them}} receiving AEDs. We examined two of these patients with multiplanar magnetic resonance (MR) imaging using 1. 0 -T equipment including fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), T 2 -weighted (TSE) and T 1 -weighted (SE) sequences before and after injection of contrast agent. the third patient was studied using 1. 5 -T equipment with the same sequences. Additionally, a T 1 SE sequence with a magnetization transfer contrast pulse off resonance (T 1 SE/MTC), diffusion-weighted imaging (EPI-DWI) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps were obtained. Results We observed an identical pattern of imaging abnormalities in all patients characterized by round lesions, hyperintense on FLAIR and hypointense on T 1 SE images, located in the central portion of the SCC. One lesion showed homogeneous gadolinium enhancement and perilesional vasogenic edema. This particular lesion showed restricted diffusion confirmed on the ADC map. This pattern was considered consistent with <b>focal</b> <b>demyelination.</b> Follow-up MR examinations showed complete disappearance or a clear reduction in lesion size.

40|$|AbstractMultiple {{sclerosis}} (MS) is {{a progressive}} demyelinating {{disease of the}} central nervous system (CNS). Many nerve axons are insulated by a myelin sheath and their demyelination not only prevents saltatory electrical signal conduction along the axons but also removes their metabolic support leading to irreversible neurodegeneration, which currently is untreatable. There is much interest in potential therapeutics that promote remyelination and here we explore use of leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF), a cytokine known to play a key regulatory role in self-tolerant immunity and recently identified as a pro-myelination factor. In this study, we tested a nanoparticle-based strategy for targeted delivery of LIF to oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPC) to promote their differentiation into mature oligodendrocytes able to repair myelin. Poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) -based nanoparticles of ∼ 120  nm diameter were constructed with LIF as cargo (LIF-NP) with surface antibodies against NG- 2 chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan, expressed on OPC. In vitro, NG 2 -targeted LIF-NP bound to OPCs, activated pSTAT- 3 signalling and induced OPC differentiation into mature oligodendrocytes. In vivo, using a model of <b>focal</b> CNS <b>demyelination,</b> we show that NG 2 -targeted LIF-NP increased myelin repair, both at the level of increased number of myelinated axons, and increased thickness of myelin per axon. Potency was high: a single NP dose delivering picomolar quantities of LIF is sufficient to increase remyelination.

Although remyelination is considered beneficial in the long term, it is not known, whether this is also the case early in lesion formation. Additionally, the precise timing of acute axonal damage and remyelination has not been assessed so far. To shed light onto the interrelation between axons and the myelin sheath during de- and remyelination, we employed cuprizone- and <b>focal</b> lysolecithin-induced <b>demyelination</b> and performed time course experiments assessing the evolution of early and late stage remyelination and axonal damage. We observed damaged axons with signs of remyelination after cuprizone diet cessation and lysolecithin injection. Similar observations were made in early multiple sclerosis lesions. To assess the correlation of remyelination and axonal damage in multiple sclerosis lesions, we took advantage of a cohort of patients with early and late stage remyelinated lesions and assessed the number of APP- and SMI 32 - positive damaged axons and the density of SMI 31 -positive and silver impregnated preserved axons. Early de- and remyelinating lesions did not differ with respect to axonal density and axonal damage, but we observed a lower axonal density in late stage demyelinated multiple sclerosis lesions than in remyelinated multiple sclerosis lesions.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Multiple {{sclerosis}} is {{a chronic}} inflammatory disorder {{of the central}} nervous system characterized by acute episodes of neurological dysfunction thought to reflect <b>focal</b> areas of <b>demyelination</b> occurring in clinically eloquent areas.

However, with increasing age (up to 13  months), the dorsally derived OPs become less able to differentiate into mature oligodendrocytes. Comparison of dorsally and ventrally derived OPs in culture revealed inherent differences in their migration and differentiation capacities.

Here we generate a comprehensive transcriptional {{profile of the}} separate stages of spontaneous remyelination following <b>focal</b> <b>demyelination</b> in the rat CNS and show transcripts encoding retinoid acid receptor RXR-gamma is highly differentially expressed during remyelination. We find that oligodendrocyte lineage cells express RXR-gamma in rat tissues undergoing remyelination and in active and remyelinated MS lesions. RXR-gamma knockdown by RNA interference or RXR-specific antagonists severely inhibit oligodendrocyte differentiation in culture. In RXR-gamma deficient mice, adult oligodendrocyte precursor cells efficiently repopulate lesions following demyelination, but display delayed differentiation into mature oligodendrocytes. Administration of the RXR agonist 9 -cis-retinoic acid to demyelinated cerebellar slice cultures and to aged rats following demyelination results in more remyelinated axons.

It was shown that conduction could be either blocked or slowed within a <b>focal</b> zone of <b>demyelination,</b> and that the histologically normal portion of the fibres beyond the lesion (distal with respect to the cell body) retains the ability to conduct impulses at a normal velocity. The next step in the systematic examination of the effects of pathological processes on the function of central nerve fibres has been to study conduction during degeneration in the spinal cord. It is obvious that conduction must cease when axonal continuity is lost. But what happens during the phases of degeneration preceding axon disruption, and what happens to conduction in surviving fibres intermingled with degenerating fibres? The present experiments have been designed to answer these questions. Disintegration of both axons and myelin is seen following mechanical separation of nerve fibres from their cell bodies (Wallerian degeneration), following intoxication with certain substances, and in many naturally occurring diseases of man an...|$|R
40|$|Multiple {{sclerosis}} (MS) is a {{neurodegenerative disease}} in which the immune system recognizes proteins of the myelin sheath as antigenic, thus initiating an inflammatory reaction in {{the central nervous system}}. It is characterized by intermittent or chronic damage to the myelin sheaths (<b>demyelination),</b> <b>focal</b> inflammation and axonal degeneration Inflammation has always been as the pathophysiology of multiple sclerosis. The present pharmacological treatment of MS administration of immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory drugs, which are only palliative and slow progress of the disease. Infection, trauma or autoimmune inflammation in experimental allergic multiple sclerosis and they are competent presenters of antigen and interact with T cells recruited to the inflamed CNS. Symptoms of inflammation in general and more specifically in multiple sclerosis, a demyelinating, autoimmune disease characterized by inflammation of the central nervous system (CNS). Inflammation has always been thought of as detrimental in the pathophysiology of multiple sclerosis. However, emerging genetic data, magnetic-resonance-imaging studies, and immunopathological evidence challenge this simplistic view. Inflammatory cells normally occurs via emigration or insitu apoptosis. Characterization of the inflammatory infiltrates present in MS brai...|$|R
40|$|X-linked {{adrenoleukodystrophy}} (X-ALD) is {{the most}} common inherited leukodystrophy. Nevertheless, no genotype-phenotype correlation has been established so far. Unidentified modifier genes or other cofactors are suspected to modulate phenotype and prognosis. We recently described polymorphisms of methionine metabolism as possible disease modifiers in X-ALD. To retest these findings, we analyzed 172 new DNA samples of X-ALD patients from different populations (France, Germany, USA, China) by genotyping eight genetic variants of methionine metabolism, including DHFR c. 594 + 59 del 19 bp, CBS c. 844 _ 855 ins 68, MTR c. 2756 A>G, MTHFR c. 677 C>T and c. 1298 A>C, MTRR c. 60 A>G, RFC 1 c. 80 G>A, and Tc 2 c. 776 C>G. We compared three X-ALD phenotypes: childhood-onset cerebral demyelinating inflammatory type (CCALD; n = 82), adulthood onset with <b>focal</b> cerebral <b>demyelination</b> (ACALD; n = 38), and adulthood onset without cerebral demyelination (AMN; n = 52). The association of genotypes and phenotypes was analyzed with univariate two-sided Pearson's chi(2). In the comparison between AMN and CCALD, the G allele of Tc 2 c. 776 C>G was associated with X-ALD phenotypes (chi(2) = 6. 1; P = 0. 048). The prevalence of the GG genotype of Tc 2 c. 776 C>G was higher in patients with CNS demyelination compared to those without CNS demyelination (chi(2) = 4. 42; P = 0. 036). The GG genotype was also more frequent in CCALD compared to AMN (chi(2) = 4. 7; P = 0. 031). The other polymorphisms did not show any significant associations in this study sample. Whereas the influence of other polymorphisms of methionine metabolism was not confirmed, the present study supports the previously made observation that the Tc 2 genotype contributes to X-ALD phenotype generation...|$|R
