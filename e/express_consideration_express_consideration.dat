40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{differences}} between the prefaced expressions used in dialogues and readers' letters to newspaper editors. Based on research, we found the following differences. First, considering the use or non-use of prefaced expressions, it is obvious that many kinds of such expressions are used in dialogues, regardless of the status of the participants or the context of the communication. However, in letters to the editor, there are no prefaced expressions of apology or explanation. Second, after counting the number of prefaced expressions used, we found that those phrases <b>expressing</b> <b>consideration</b> (or care, respect, attention, etc.) for the addressee appear more frequently in dialogues than in letters. By contrast, the frequency of use of phrases expressing communication context is lower in dialogues than in letters...|$|R

40|$|Abstract  The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{identify}} how Swedish clothing companies strategically communicate CSR – the issue being that CSR communication is frequently scrutinized and criticized. This is examined using semi-structured interviews with six company representatives. The result is presented thematically, dealing with (1) conditions for CSR and CSR communication, (2) how to manage the issue with criticism and (3) which communication strategies companies use. Following conclusions are drawn: the companies can be divided into Mirvis and Googins phases integrated or engaged/innovative, with conditions characterizing these phases. They <b>express</b> <b>consideration</b> of the issue, which is handled with cautious and transparent CSR communication. They use low profile communication strategies and collaborate with organizations. Half of the companies communicate through reports and a few admit to using third-party or indirect third-party endorsements. Only one of the companies uses social media. ...|$|R

40|$|Political apologies by {{one group}} to another often occur a {{significant}} {{period of time}} after the original transgression. What effect does such a delay have on perceptions of sincerity and forgiveness? A delayed apology could reflect the offender group 2 ̆ 7 s reluctance to apologize, or, alternatively, it could represent time and consideration spent on developing an appropriate response. In the latter case, the delayed apology would represent a sincere acknowledgment of the harm done, whereas in the former case it would not. In two studies, we found that a verbal collective apology, when delayed, was perceived to be less sincere than when offered more immediately following a transgression, and this translated to less forgiveness. However, in Study 2, {{the negative effects of}} time delay on sincerity and forgiveness were mitigated or reversed when the apology was in the form of commemoration. The commemorative apology, in particular when delayed, gave rise to favorable attributions (including representativeness of apologizing group, commitment to remember, and giving voice to victims), which mediated the effects on sincerity. The results suggest that collective apologies that are offered with considerable delay appear less meaningful and less deserving of a forgiving response, unless the apologizing group is able to <b>express</b> <b>consideration</b> and thoughtfulness through the apology process...|$|R

The multivariate rate equation is fitted to an appropriate set of data and found to provide a good description of variable-interval performance when both rate and power of reinforcement are varied. Rate and power measures completely describe reinforcement. The effects of their joint variation are not predicted and cannot be described by Herrnstein's equation...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{primarily}} {{concerns the}} study of parametric problems of infinite and semi-infinite programming, where functional constraints are given by systems of infinitely many linear inequalities indexed by an arbitrary set T, where decision variables run over Banach (infinite programming) or finite-dimensional (semi-infinite case) spaces, and where objectives are generally described by nonsmooth and nonconvex cost functions. The parameter space of admissible perturbations in such problems is formed by all bounded functions on T equipped with the standard supremum norm. Unless the index set T is finite, this space is intrinsically infinite-dimensional (nonreflexive and nonseparable) of the l(infinity) -type. By using advanced tools of variational analysis and generalized differentiation and largely exploiting underlying specific features of linear infinite constraints, we establish complete characterizations of robust Lipschitzian stability (with computing the exact bound of Lipschitzian moduli) for parametric maps of feasible solutions governed by linear infinite inequality systems and then derive verifiable necessary optimality conditions for the infinite and semi-infinite programs under <b>consideration</b> <b>expressed</b> {{in terms of their}} initial data. A crucial part of our analysis addresses the precise computation of coderivatives and their norms for infinite systems of parametric linear inequalities in general Banach spaces of decision variables.

We need complex models for dealing with this part. For their characteristic of being general approximators NNs seem one of most interesting instrument. This is true both for macroeconomic and for financial data. Often, the economic system is so complex that, to grasp the meaning of the information conveyed by the data, even a general approximator like NN is not enough. Larger information could be obtained using 2 or more instruments in cascade or in parallel. We will concentrate on this topic. We will try to illustrate how the combination of tools is possible.

His comment that a population can continue to grow even with a declining growth rate points out the dependency of the logistic growth model on an assumed rate of decline in the growth rate.
