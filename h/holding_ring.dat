5000|$|In Hassett’s {{first season}} on the team Tipp reached the provincial final and {{he was given the}} unenviable task of marking Cork’s Christy Ring. In one of the toughest games of hurling ever-played Hassett succeeded in <b>holding</b> <b>Ring</b> to just three points; while Tipp {{went on to win the}} game by 4-13 to 4-11. It was his first Munster title. [...] The {{subsequent}} All-Ireland final pitted Tipperary against Wexford. Tipperary displayed a certain amount of over-confidence going into the match and Wexford pounced at the beginning of each half with two goals by Mick Hassett and Oliver McGrath. The crowd invaded the pitch with a minute to go, mistaking the final whistle, and when the disorder was cleared Tipperary continued playing with twelve men. It mattered little as Wexford were the All-Ireland champions by 2-15 to 0-11.|$|E
50|$|In 1949 Ring {{endured the}} most torrid 150 minutes of {{championship}} hurling as Cork faced Tipperary in the Munster quarter-final. Tipperary had a relatively young and inexperienced team, however, {{for most of}} the match it looked as if youth would trump experience and with only a few minutes to spare they were ahead by 3-10 to 2-9. A solo effort from Jack Lynch, who by know was a TD, from his usual midfield berth resulted in a goal and brought his personal tally to 1-6. A point from Bernie Murphy levelled the scores at the death. The replay four weeks later was a classic. A Gerry O'Riordan goal gave Cork a 1-2 to 0-2 at the interval, however, Cork could have been further ahead but for a disallowed goal. Mossy O'Riordan sent a shot past Tipperary 'keeper Tony Reddin, however, the sliotar appeared to rebound off the stanchion supporting the net before being cleared. In spite of Ring protesting with the officials, the referee waved the play on. After five minutes of injury time Cork still led by 1-5 to 0-5, however, Jimmy Kennedy scored the equalising goal and the game headed for extra-time. Both sides took different approaches as extra-time was about to be played. Tipperary retired to their dressing room where the players refreshed themselves with a creamery churn full of cold water. Cork on the other hand remained out on the field in what was one of the warmest days ever recorded in Ireland. Tipperary took to the field a much fresher team and an early goal from Mick Ryan gave them the lead and they held out to win by 2-8 to 1-9. Tipp's Tommy Doyle, who earlier in the year ad been coaxed out of retirement, gave an inspired display by <b>holding</b> <b>Ring</b> scoreless for the two drawn games and the period of extra time. In spite of an early championship exit, Ring was chosen at centre-forward on the Sunday Press Team of the Year.|$|E

This, because final compression {{does not appear to}} be possible in the rings because of the huge velocity spread of the large bunches.
