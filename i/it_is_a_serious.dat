5|$|In Ratner's view, {{the most}} {{important}} of Saint-Saëns's chamber works are the sonatas: two for violin, two for cello, and one each for oboe, clarinet and bassoon, all seven with piano accompaniment. The First Violin Sonata dates from 1885, and is rated by Grove's Dictionary as one of the composer's best and most characteristic compositions. The Second (1896) signals a stylistic change in Saint-Saëns's work, with a lighter, clearer sound for the piano, characteristic of his music from then onwards. The First Cello Sonata (1872) was written after the death of the composer's great-aunt, who had taught him to play the piano more than thirty years earlier. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> work, in which the main melodic material is sustained by the cello over a virtuoso piano accompaniment. Fauré called it the only cello sonata from any country to be of any importance. The Second (1905) is in four movements, and has the unusual feature of a theme and variations as its scherzo.|$|E

500|$|Malicious rumours {{concerning}} Wenger's {{private life}} surfaced during November 1996, {{to the extent}} the City of London reported that his exit from Arsenal was imminent. Having returned {{from a trip to}} Strasbourg to visit his parents, Wenger attended a press meeting and strongly refuted the claims: [...] "If something comes out that is wrong, I will attack. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> matter if you can just create things that are not right." [...] Arsenal's press officer Clare Tomlinson, who was present at the news conference, recalled Wenger phoning the next day and demanding why he could not take action against the press for printing the story. The culprit responsible for spreading gossip in the City later apologised to Wenger. During this, Arsenal had led the Premier League, but poor form in February 1997 caused Wenger to rule out his team's chances of winning the title. They finished third in his first season, missing out on UEFA Champions League qualification to Newcastle United on goal difference – the tiebreaker used to determine the ranking between teams equal on points.|$|E

[...] Dostoyevsky later wrote to his brother on 23 March 1845, [...] "I finished the novel in November, then rewrote it in December, and again in February–March.

[...] Sometime around April 1845, his friend Dmitry Grigorovich, with whom he had shared an apartment since the autumn of 1844, proposed giving the manuscript to poet Nikolay Nekrasov, who was planning to issue an anthology in 1846. Dostoyevsky took the manuscript to Nekrasov and returned home. Shortly afterwards the doorbell of his house rang, and he {{opened the door to the}} excited Nekrasov and Grigorovich, both of whom congratulated him on his debut novel, of which they had only read 10 pages. They finished the full 112-page work during the night at Dostoyevsky's apartment. The next morning, the three men went to the critic Vissarion Belinsky; Nekrasov proclaimed Dostoyevsky [...] "the New Gogol" [...] though Belinsky replied sceptically [...] "You find Gogol's springing up like mushrooms". Dostoyevsky himself did not believe his book would receive a positive review from Belinsky, but when Nekrasov visited Belinsky in the evening, the latter wanted to meet Dostoyevsky to congratulate him on his debut. Dostoyevsky proposed to issue Poor Folk in the Fatherland Notes, but it was instead published in the almanac St. Petersburg Collection on January 15, 1846.|$|E

2500|$|In his Institutes of the Christian Religion, John Calvin {{sets the}} stage for {{discussing}} this commandment by noting that an oath is calling God to witness that what we say is true, and that an appropriate oath is a kind of worship of God in that it implies a profession of faith.

[...] False swearing robs God of his truth (to the observer), and therefore <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> matter.
