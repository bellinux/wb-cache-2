40|$|In this paper, {{we explore}} {{the use of}} digital {{photographs}} in computer-mediated communication. We present Lascaux, an instant messaging client {{that serves as a}} research platform for studying visual communication with digital photographs. Through a combined analysis of the uses of <b>images</b> in Lascaux <b>as</b> well as the uses of images in other communicative contexts, we arrived at six themes of appropriation: the <b>image</b> <b>as</b> amplification, the <b>image</b> <b>as</b> narrative, the <b>image</b> <b>as</b> awareness, the <b>image</b> <b>as</b> local expression, the <b>image</b> <b>as</b> invitation, and the <b>image</b> <b>as</b> object/ instrument. For each theme, we explore the ways in which a medium may be designed to support that class of appropriation. Finally, we reflect on the relationship between literacy, mastery, and appropriation.

5|$|Pigeon {{photography}} is an aerial photography technique invented in 1907 by the German apothecary Julius Neubronner, who also used pigeons to deliver medications. A homing pigeon was fitted with an aluminium breast harness {{to which a}} lightweight time-delayed miniature camera could be attached. Neubronner's German patent application was initially rejected, but was granted in December 1908 after he produced authenticated photographs taken by his pigeons. He publicized the technique at the 1909 Dresden International Photographic Exhibition, and sold some <b>images</b> <b>as</b> postcards at the Frankfurt International Aviation Exhibition and at the 1910 and 1911 Paris Air Shows.|$|E

5|$|The Cottingley Fairies {{appear in}} a series of five {{photographs}} taken by Elsie Wright (1901–88) and Frances Griffiths (1907–86), two young cousins who lived in Cottingley, near Bradford in England. In 1917, when the first two photographs were taken, Elsie was 16 years old and Frances was 9. The pictures {{came to the attention of}} writer Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, who used them to illustrate an article on fairies he had been commissioned to write for the Christmas 1920 edition of The Strand Magazine. Doyle, as a spiritualist, was enthusiastic about the photographs, and interpreted them as clear and visible evidence of psychic phenomena. Public reaction was mixed; some accepted the <b>images</b> <b>as</b> genuine, but others believed they had been faked.|$|E
5|$|The {{method of}} Malaysian batik making is {{different}} from those of Indonesian Javanese batik, the pattern being larger and simpler with only occasional use of the canting to create intricate patterns. It relies heavily on brush painting to apply colours to fabrics. The colours also tend to be lighter and more vibrant than deep coloured Javanese batik. The most popular motifs are leaves and flowers. Malaysian batik often displays plants and flowers to avoid the interpretation of human and animal <b>images</b> <b>as</b> idolatry, in accordance with local Islamic doctrine. However, the butterfly theme is a common exception.|$|E

Eric enters the house alone and eventually locates the bathroom, where he is attacked by a pig-masked figure.

5|$|Haynes' car is {{believed}} to be the second gasoline-engine powered vehicle successfully road tested in the United States, according to its exhibit information at the Smithsonian Institution. It was built two years before Henry Ford's Quadricycle, and preceded only by Charles Duryea's Motorized Wagon less than a year earlier. Unlike Duryea's car, which was an adapted buckboard wagon that was designed to run under its own power but still able to be pulled by horse, Haynes' car was designed only to run on its own. Some automotive historians use this difference to determine that Haynes' car was the first true American automobile. The Sintz company continued to be intrigued by Haynes' use of their motor and sent representatives to photo his vehicle and published the <b>images</b> <b>as</b> an advertisement for one of their engine's possible uses. The publicity spurred the creation of numerous other automobiles across the American midwest.|$|E
5|$|The Swedish band Europe {{released}} the anthemic album The Final Countdown which {{reached the top}} ten in several countries, including the U.S. and while the title single reached number one in 26 countries. Stryper made their mainstream breakthrough in 1986 {{with the release of}} their platinum album To Hell with the Devil and brought Christian lyrics to their hard rock music style and glam metal looks. Two Pennsylvania bands, with Harrisburg's Poison and Philadelphia's Cinderella released multi-platinum début albums, respectively Look What the Cat Dragged In and Night Songs in 1986. Van Halen released 5150 their first album with Sammy Hagar on lead vocals, which was number one in the U.S. for three weeks and sold over six million copies. Additionally, some established hard rock bands of the era such as the Scorpions, Whitesnake, Aerosmith, Kiss, Alice Cooper, and Judas Priest began incorporating glam metal elements into their sounds and <b>images,</b> <b>as</b> the genre's popularity skyrocketed in 1985-86.|$|E
5|$|The {{precursor}} to Arlene was first identified in satellite <b>images</b> <b>as</b> {{a cluster of}} disturbed weather east of the Mosquito Coast on June9. Over the following week, the system grew in expanse as it slowly tracked northwestward as strong wind shear in the area prohibited {{the development of a}} tropical cyclone. On June16, the formation of an upper-level low over the Bay of Campeche and the progression of a tropical wave across the Caribbean Sea helped foster the development of a low-pressure area over the Yucatán Peninsula. Although initially diffuse, new rainbands began to wrap around the new vortex's center, and at 0000UTC, the National Hurricane Center(NHC) classified the system as a tropical depression west of the Yucatán Peninsula. Although the storm was now considered a tropical cyclone, wind shear that had earlier inhibited development remained present, as well as the outflow of Tropical Storm Beatriz in the Eastern Pacific, disrupting the core of the infant tropical depression; aircraft reconnaissance often could not identify a defined center of circulation.|$|E
