5|$|In 1963, {{three major}} {{commuter}} groups in New Jersey made expansion proposals. One {{of them would}} have <b>involved</b> <b>an</b> extension of the IRT Flushing Line under the Hudson River with a three-track tunnel and then connect with the New York, Susquehanna and Western Railroad.|$|E
5|$|Nat Perrin and Arthur Sheekman, who {{had contributed}} to the scripts of the Marx Brothers' films Monkey Business (1931) and Horse Feathers (1932), were enlisted to write the comedy show.

5|$|Four main {{proposals}} were suggested {{for the new}} fixed link.

5|$|During {{the baby}} boom, DeLee's {{prophylactic}} forceps approach found new life. Busy physicians were often eager to adopt this systematic approach to anesthetized delivery because its efficiency {{allowed them to}} care for more patients. By 1968, nearly 40% of the babies born in U.S. hospitals were delivered with forceps. The use of episiotomies also continued to increase throughout DeLee's career and after his death. By the 1970s, 90% of delivering women received an episiotomy. A 1983 study did not support good outcomes with this practice, and by the year 2000, only 20 percent of U.S. deliveries <b>involved</b> <b>an</b> episiotomy.|$|E
5|$|In Barker v. Wingo (1972), the Supreme Court {{announced}} {{four factors}} {{relevant to the}} determination of a Speedy Trial Clause violation: (1) {{the length of the}} delay, (2) the reason for the delay, (3) whether the defendant demanded a speedy trial, and (4) prejudice. Applying Barker, the Court found such a violation in Doggett v. United States (1992), which <b>involved</b> <b>an</b> over eight-year period between indictment and arrest. The only possible remedy for a Speedy Trial Clause violation is dismissal with prejudice.|$|E
5|$|In January, the Eighth Army entered combat on Luzon, landing Major General Charles P. Hall's XI Corps on 29 January near San Antonio and Major General Joseph M. Swing's 11th Airborne Division at Nasugbu, Batangas {{two days}} later. Combining with Sixth Army, the Eighth Army enveloped Manila {{in a great}} pincer movement. Eichelberger assumed {{personal}} command of the operation, which <b>involved</b> <b>an</b> advance on Manila by the lightly equipped 11th Airborne Division. The audacious advance made rapid progress until it was halted by well-prepared positions {{on the outskirts of}} Manila. MacArthur awarded Eichelberger another Silver Star.|$|E

5|$|In the film, Stromberg's {{scheme to}} destroy {{civilisation}} by capturing Soviet and British nuclear submarines {{and have them}} fire intercontinental ballistic missiles at two major cities is actually a recycled plot from Gilbert's previous Bond film, You Only Live Twice, which involved stealing space capsules to start a war between the Soviets and the Americans. The similarity was apparent in the climax; both films <b>involved</b> <b>an</b> assault on a heavily fortified enemy that had taken refuge behind steel shutters.|$|E
5|$|June 28, 2012: In {{the case}} of United States v. Alvarez, the Supreme Court of the United States held that the Stolen Valor Act of 2005's criminalization of the making of false claims of having been awarded a {{military}} medal, decoration, or badge was an unconstitutional violation of the First Amendment's guarantee of free speech. The case <b>involved</b> <b>an</b> elected official in California, Xavier Alvarez, who had falsely stated at a public meeting {{that he had been}} awarded the Medal of Honor, even though he had never served in any branch of the armed forces.|$|E
5|$|Messages {{were also}} sent from the US. Rudloff, an agent {{based in the}} New York, sent four reports between 2 and 20 June. He {{identified}} the six divisions under Fredendall being sidelined for specialist training in bridge building but not amphibious assault and under heavy security. A last-minute deception <b>involved</b> <b>an</b> MI6 transmitter in France. Known to be under German control, when the operator asked about routes to send escaped prisoners of war the handlers replied that they should, from 15 June, be sent toward Bordeaux.|$|E

5|$|Pontecorvo's {{solution}} to the solar neutrino problem <b>involved</b> <b>an</b> idea that he had first considered in 1957, and developed over the following decade. This {{was the idea that}} neutrinos may convert into other types of neutrinos, a phenomenon known as neutrino oscillation. Somewhere between the Sun and the Earth, electron neutrinos might transform into muon neutrinos. An important point was that for this to happen, neutrinos could not have zero mass, and therefore could not travel at the speed of light. The existence of the oscillations was finally established by the Super-Kamiokande experiment in 1998 and later confirmed by other experiments.|$|E
5|$|Private flying can be {{for both}} {{recreational}} purposes and personal transport, using aircraft that are owned individually, collectively {{as part of a}} syndicate, or rented from a flying club. A survey of pilots conducted between 2001 and 2002 indicated that the most common purposes of recreational flights were local flights near the base aerodrome, visits to other aerodromes, and day trips away. Half of all flights landed at the same aerodrome they departed from, and only 9 per cent <b>involved</b> <b>an</b> overnight stay away from home.|$|E
5|$|Ralph was {{not chosen}} {{archbishop}} of Canterbury by the chapter of Canterbury alone. His election <b>involved</b> <b>an</b> {{assembly of the}} lords and bishops meeting with King Henry I of England. Ralph then received his pallium from Pope Paschal II, rather than travelling to Rome to retrieve it. As archbishop, Ralph was very assertive {{of the rights of}} the see of Canterbury and of the liberties of the English church. He claimed authority in Wales and Scotland. Ralph also quarrelled for a time with Pope Paschal II.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of Loznica <b>involved</b> <b>an</b> {{attack on}} the German {{garrison}} of that town by the Jadar Chetnik Detachment on 31 August 1941. Following the World War II German-led Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941, the Kingdom of Yugoslavia was partitioned.

5|$|The four judges {{then went}} on to decide that the {{jurisdiction}} <b>involved</b> <b>an</b> exercise of judicial power, mentioning an earlier decision of Justice Isaacs, in which he had taken a functional approach, and determined that some functions, when conferred upon a legislative or executive body, can involve the exercise of non-judicial power, but the same functions when conferred on a judicial body involve the exercise of judicial power. The four judges found that the powers conferred on the court, to take evidence and compel witnesses and such, when vested in a judicial body such as the court, involved the exercise of judicial power. As such, the jurisdiction did not offend the separation of powers.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea for}} Sholay {{began as a}} four-line snippet which screenwriter pair Salim-Javed told G. P.

The original idea of the film <b>involved</b> <b>an</b> army officer who decided to hire two ex-soldiers to avenge {{the murder of his}} family. The army officer was later changed to a policeman because Sippy felt that {{it would be difficult to}} get permission to shoot scenes depicting army activities. Salim-Javed completed the script in one month, incorporating names and personality traits of their friends and acquaintances.|$|E

5|$|Work on The Simpsons <b>involved</b> <b>an</b> {{irregular}} schedule.
