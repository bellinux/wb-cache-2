40|$|An <b>illustrative</b> <b>embodiment</b> of the {{invention}} includes apparatus which simultaneously produces both direct delta modulation and pulse code modulation. An input signal, after amplification, is supplied {{to a window}} comparator which supplies a polarity control signal to gate the output of a clock to the appropriate input of a binary up-down counter. The control signals provide direct delta modulation while the up-down counter output provides pulse code modulation...|$|E
40|$|A {{system and}} method for {{efficiently}} charging and discharging a capacitive load {{from a single}} voltage source. The system includes a brat switch for selectively connecting the voltage source to the load and a second switch for selectively providing a short across the load as may he common in the art. A particularly novel aspect of the invention resides {{in the provision of}} plural capacitive elements and a switching mechanism for selectively connecting each of the capacitive elements to the load whereby the load is gradually charged or discharged. In the <b>illustrative</b> <b>embodiment,</b> the switching mechanism includes a set of switches for selectively connecting each of the capacitive elements to the capacitive load and a switch control mechanism for selectively activating the switches...|$|E
40|$|Methods and {{apparatus}} {{for providing}} a multi-tier object-relational database architecture are disclosed. In one <b>illustrative</b> <b>embodiment</b> {{of the present}} invention, a multi-tier database architecture comprises an object-relational database engine as a top tier, one or more domain-specific extension modules as a bottom tier, and one or more universal extension modules as a middle tier. The individual extension modules of the bottom tier operationally connect with {{the one or more}} universal extension modules which, themselves, operationally connect with the database engine. The domain-specific extension modules preferably provide such functions as search, index, and retrieval services of images, video, audio, time series, web pages, text, XML, spatial data, etc. The domain-specific extension modules may include one or more IBM DB 2 extenders, Oracle data cartridges and/or Informix datablades, although other domain-specific extension modules may be used...|$|E
40|$|Techniques are {{disclosed}} for in-line storage of {{message authentication code}}s with respective encrypted data blocks. In one aspect, a given data block is encrypted and a message authentication code is generated for the encrypted data block. A target address is determined for storage of the encrypted data block in a memory. The target address is then modified to permit in-line storage of the message authentication code with the encrypted data block in the memory, and the encrypted data block and the message authentication code are transferred to the memory for storage at the modified address. <b>Illustrative</b> <b>embodiments</b> of the techniques advantageously facilitate secure off-chip storage of data in a processing system...|$|R
40|$|An antibuckling {{fatigue test}} {{assembly}} is described for holding a metal specimen which {{is subjected to}} compression and to rapid cyclical heating and cooling while permitting visual observation. In an <b>illustrative</b> <b>embodiment</b> of this invention, the anti-buckling fatigue test apparatus includes first and second guide members between which the metal specimen is disposed and held, a heating assembly comprising a suitable heating source such as a quartz lamp and a reflecting assembly directing the heat onto the specimen, and a cooling assembly for directing a suitable cooling fluid such as air onto the specimen. The guide members each have a passage to permit the heat to be directed onto the specimen. An opening is provided in the reflecting assembly to permit visual inspection of that region of the specimen adjacent to the opening onto which the heat is directed...|$|E
