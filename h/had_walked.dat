The next morning, Ashford was found drowned in a pit, with little outward signs of violence. Although public opinion was heavily against Thornton, the jury quickly acquitted him, and also found him not guilty of rape.|$|E
5|$|In 1870 Brassey {{was told}} that he had cancer but he {{continued}} to visit his working sites. One of his last visits was to the Wolverhampton and Walsall Railway, only a few miles from his first railway contract at Penkridge. In the late summer of 1870 he took to his bed at his home in St Leonards-on-Sea. There he was visited by members of his work force, not only his engineers and agents, but also his navvies, many of whom <b>had</b> <b>walked</b> for days to come and pay their respects.|$|E

50|$|It is {{interesting}} to note one instance where all translators, except one, have decidedly diverted from the temporal sense of the text. The first line haajaar bochor dhore aami path haatitechi prithibir pothey is in present perfect continuous tense. Most translations have rendered this either into simple past tense or present perfect tense. Oblivious of the continuity of the act Martin Kirkman translated : A thousand years I have wandered upon the earth. Amitabha Mukerjee translated : A thousand years I <b>have</b> <b>walked</b> these paths. Sukanta Chaudhuri rendered : I <b>have</b> <b>walked</b> the roads across the earth’s breast for a thousand years. Ananda Lal also used present perfect tense : I <b>have</b> <b>walked</b> the paths of earth for thousands of years. Now the translation by Joydeep Bhattacharya : I <b>have</b> <b>walked</b> earth’s byways for millennia. Fakrul Alam followed suit by writing : For a thousand years I <b>have</b> <b>walked</b> the ways of the world.|$|R

5|$|In 2010, the {{brothers}} were both accepted to New York University. They had initial {{plans to attend}} the university {{in the fall of}} 2010; however, they deferred for one year. Dylan initially planned on majoring in fine/studio arts and minoring in economics while Cole planned on majoring in film and television production and minoring in drama. Instead, they both enrolled in the Gallatin School of Individualized Study, which allows students to plan their own curriculum. Cole focused his curriculum on the humanities and archaeology while Dylan focused on video game design. In 2011, Dylan was elected president of the Third Avenue North residence hall at New York University. Both brothers graduated in May 2015; they told Entertainment magazine that they <b>had</b> <b>walked</b> away with each other's diplomas at the graduation ceremony.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fourth}} inning, Pujols doubled again {{and was able}} to score on an error by Mueller. The Red Sox also scored {{in the bottom of the}} inning when Bellhorn doubled to center with two runners on base, to give them a three-run lead. Cal Eldred came in to relieve Morris in the fifth inning, after he <b>had</b> <b>walked</b> the leadoff hitter, having already given up four runs in the {{previous}} four innings. Mueller committed his World Series record-tying third error of the game, in the sixth inning; however, the Cardinals failed to capitalize. In the bottom of the inning, Trot Nixon led off with a single to center, and two more singles by Johnny Damon and Orlando Cabrera enabled two more runs to score to make it 6–1.|$|E
5|$|Ornstein was {{the first}} {{important}} composer to make extensive use of the tone cluster. As a pianist, he was considered a world-class talent. By the mid-1920s, he <b>had</b> <b>walked</b> away from his fame and soon disappeared from popular memory. Though he gave his last public concert {{before the age of}} forty, he continued writing music for another half-century and beyond. Largely forgotten for decades, he was rediscovered in the mid-1970s. Ornstein completed his eighth and final piano sonata in September 1990 at the age of ninety-four, making him the oldest published composer in history (a mark since passed by Elliott Carter).|$|E

5|$|Shepard was {{diagnosed}} with leukemia in 1996, and died from complications of the disease in Pebble Beach, California, on July 21, 1998. He was the second astronaut who <b>had</b> <b>walked</b> on the Moon to die, Jim Irwin being the first in 1991. His widow Louise resolved to cremate his remains and scatter the ashes, but she died {{from a heart attack}} five weeks later on August 25, 1998, at 17:00, the time at which Shepard had always called her. They had been married for 53 years. The family decided to cremate them both, and their ashes were scattered together by a Navy helicopter over Stillwater Cove, in front of their Pebble Beach home.|$|E
5|$|Twelve {{days after}} the disappearance, Robert Murat, a 34-year-old British-Portuguese {{property}} consultant, became the first arguido. Born in Hammersmith, west London, Murat lived in his mother's house, Casa Liliana, 150 yards (137 m) from apartment 5A in {{the direction in which}} the man in the Tanner sighting <b>had</b> <b>walked.</b> He was made an arguido after a Sunday Mirror journalist told police he had been asking {{a lot of questions about}} the case. The Polícia Judiciária had briefly signed him up as an official interpreter; he said he had wanted to help because he had a daughter in England around Madeleine's age.|$|E
5|$|According to Herodotus, {{after the}} Persian navy began its maneuvers, Aristides {{arrived at the}} Allied camp from Aegina. Aristides had been {{recalled}} from exile {{along with the other}} ostracised Athenians on the order of Themistocles, so that Athens might be united against the Persians. Aristides told Themistocles that the Persian fleet had encircled the Allies, which greatly pleased Themistocles, as he now knew that the Persians <b>had</b> <b>walked</b> into his trap. The Allied commanders seem to have taken this news rather uncomplainingly, and Holland therefore suggests that they were party to Themistocles's ruse all along. Either way, the Allies prepared for battle, and Themistocles delivered a speech to the marines before they embarked on the ships. In the ensuing battle, the cramped conditions in the Straits hindered the much larger Persian navy, which became disarrayed, and the Allies took advantage to win a famous victory.|$|E

5|$|In 1552, Las Casas {{published}} A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies. This book, {{written a}} decade earlier {{and sent to the}} attention of then-prince Philip II of Spain, contained accounts of the abuses committed by some Spaniards against Native Americans during the early stages of colonization. In 1555 his old Franciscan adversary Toribio de Benavente Motolinia wrote a letter in which he described Las Casas as an ignorant, arrogant troublemaker. Benavente described indignantly how Las Casas had once denied baptism to an aging Indian who <b>had</b> <b>walked</b> many leagues to receive it, only on the grounds that he did not believe that the man had received sufficient doctrinal instruction. This letter, which reinvoked the old conflict over the requirements for the sacrament of baptism between the two orders, was intended to bring Las Casas in disfavour. However, it did not succeed.|$|E
5|$|Only Maryland and New York had yet {{to authorize}} {{independence}} {{towards the end of}} June. Previously, Maryland's delegates <b>had</b> <b>walked</b> out when the Continental Congress adopted Adams's radical May 15 preamble, and had sent to the Annapolis Convention for instructions. On May 20, the Annapolis Convention rejected Adams's preamble, instructing its delegates to remain against independence. But Samuel Chase went to Maryland and, thanks to local resolutions in favor of independence, was able to get the Annapolis Convention to change its mind on June 28. Only the New York delegates were unable to get revised instructions. When Congress had been considering the resolution of independence on June 8, the New York Provincial Congress told the delegates to wait. But on June 30, the Provincial Congress evacuated New York as British forces approached, and would not convene again until July 10. This meant that New York's delegates would not be authorized to declare independence until after Congress had made its decision.|$|E
5|$|The 3rd Battalion <b>had</b> <b>walked</b> into a {{prepared}} North Korean ambush, suffering a bombardment of mortar and machine gun fire from prepared and hidden North Korean positions, and almost its entire command group was eliminated {{within a minute}} of the first shot being fired. L Company, at the pass, was heavily engaged with the North Korean forces higher on the hill. The company's 1st Platoon sustained a direct assault on its foxholes, with {{two members of the}} company killed by bayonets. L Company was separated {{from the rest of the}} battalion by North Korean forces advancing on its position further up the ridge. K Company attempted to move up to relieve it but was unable to do so. However, the company held in place. Meanwhile, I Company began moving up the hill to provide support. North Korean forces were able to cut the battalion into disorganized groups, with L Company engaging forces in the pass and I Company under attack from forces on the north ridge behind them. By noon, the North Korean forces on the higher ground had enveloped the American forces.|$|E

5|$|The Circus Starring Britney Spears {{generated}} {{positive to}} mixed reception from critics. While some praised its aesthetics and deemed {{it as an}} entertaining show, others criticized Spears' lack of involvement during some segments. The tour was a commercial success, with a total gross of $131.8million. This made The Circus Starring Britney Spears one of the highest-grossing tours of the decade. A great number of tickets were sold {{within a week of}} the tour's announcement, which prompted supporters to add more dates. The tour also broke attendance records in many cities and all the North American shows were sold out. It became the fifth highest grossing tour of 2009, and the sixth highest grossing tour ever by a female artist. The show generated controversy on the Australian leg after a reporter said that a great number of fans <b>had</b> <b>walked</b> out during the performances.|$|E
5|$|Truman's unit {{joined in}} a massive {{prearranged}} assault barrage on September 26, 1918, {{at the opening of}} the Meuse-Argonne Offensive. They advanced with difficulty over pitted terrain to follow the infantry, and they set up an observation post west of Cheppy. On September 27, Truman saw through his binoculars an enemy artillery battery setting up across a river in a position allowing them to fire upon the neighboring 28th Division. Truman's orders limited him to targets facing the 35th Division, but he ignored this and patiently waited until the Germans <b>had</b> <b>walked</b> their horses well away from their guns, ensuring they could not relocate out of range of Truman's battery, and then he ordered his men to open fire. The enemy battery was destroyed. His actions were credited with saving the lives of 28th Division soldiers who otherwise would have come under fire from the Germans. Truman was given a dressing down by his regimental commander, Colonel Karl D. Klemm, but he was not court-martialed or otherwise punished.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} nevertheless sent Feynman to Geneva for the September 1958 Atoms for Peace Conference. On {{the beach}} on Lake Geneva, he met Gweneth Howarth, who was from Ripponden, Yorkshire, {{and working in}} Switzerland as an au pair. Feynman's love life had been turbulent since his divorce; his previous girlfriend <b>had</b> <b>walked</b> off with his Albert Einstein Award medal and, {{on the advice of}} an earlier girlfriend, had feigned pregnancy and blackmailed him into paying for an abortion, then used the money to buy furniture. When Feynman found that Howarth was being paid only $25 a month, he offered her $20 a week to be his live-in maid. That this sort of behavior was illegal was not overlooked; Feynman had a friend, Matthew Sands, act as her sponsor. Howarth pointed out that she already had two boyfriends, but eventually decided to take Feynman up on his offer, and arrived in Altadena, California, in June 1959. She made a point of dating other men but Feynman proposed in the spring of 1960. They were married on September 24, 1960, at the Huntington Hotel in Pasadena. They had a son, Carl, in 1962, and adopted a daughter, Michelle, in 1968. Besides their home in Altadena, they had a beach house in Baja California, purchased with the money from Feynman's Nobel Prize.|$|E
