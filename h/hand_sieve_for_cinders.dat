Archeological evidence indicates a continuous occupation of the site from the Bronze Age to the Roman period and the site is well-known, thanks to the existence of a sanctuary dedicated to the goddess Artemis. Based on the study of four boreholes, a paleogeographic reconstruction of the coastal landscape is proposed. Facies were determined based on mollusc identification, and sedimentology based on grain-size measurements (<b>hand</b> <b>sieving</b> <b>for</b> the fraction above 2 [*]mm and LASER technique for particles below 2 [*]mm) and loss-on-ignition. In addition, a series of 12 AMS radiocarbon dates define a reliable chronostratigraphy. Results suggest the presence of a fully marine environment from the early Holocene to ca. 2600 - 2400 [*]cal. BC, which developed into a brackish environment from ca. 2600 - 2400 [*]cal. BC to ca. 750 [*]cal. BC due to the deltaic progradation of the nearby stream (Sarandapotamos River). From ca. 750 [*]cal. BC onward, coastal swamps prevailed in the study area. Human-environmental interaction is discussed and particular attention is paid to the paleolandscape configuration of Amarynthos...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{describe}} a very general abstract form of sieve {{based on a}} large sieve inequality which generalizes both the classical sieve inequality of Montgomery (and its higher-dimensional variants), and our recent <b>sieve</b> <b>for</b> Frobenius over function fields. The general framework suggests new applications. We give some first results {{on the number of}} prime divisors of “most” elements of an elliptic divisibility sequence, and we develop in some detail “probabilistic ” <b>sieves</b> <b>for</b> random walks on arithmetic groups, e. g., estimating the probability of finding a reducible characteristic polynomial at some step of a random walk on SL(n, Z). In addition to the sieve principle, the applications depend on bounds <b>for</b> a large <b>sieve</b> constant. To prove such bounds involves a variety of deep results, including Property (τ) or expanding properties of Cayley graphs, and the Riemann Hypothesis over finite fields. Content...|$|R
40|$|The best {{practical}} algorithm {{for class}} group computations in imaginary quadratic number fields (such as group structure, class number, discrete logarithm computations) is {{a variant of}} the quadratic sieve factoring algorithm. Paradoxical as it sounds, the principles of the number field sieve, in a strict sense, could not be applied to number field computations, yet. In this article we give an indication of the obstructions. In particular, we first present fundamental core elements of a number field <b>sieve</b> <b>for</b> number field computations of which it is absolutely unknown how to design them in a useful way. Finally, we show that the existence of a number field <b>sieve</b> <b>for</b> number field computations with a running time asymptotics {{similar to that of the}} genuine number field sieve likely implies the existence of an algorithm for elliptic curve related computational problems with subexponential running time...|$|R
