In the PDA the player can view {{their list of}} objectives (which can change {{over the course of}} a mission), maps of the area if available, a <b>help</b> <b>screen</b> and a list of weapons held with information on each. Characters also typically have cell phones which they sometimes receive calls on during missions. Some missions involve sniping using first-person shooter gameplay. These missions resemble the use of a sniper rifle during normal missions but the player cannot switch to a third-person view.|$|E

25|$|One of the AWC's final {{projects}} was {{the funding}} of a worker training center. Since its inception, the corporation had required that 51 percent of each developer's workforce come from the District of Columbia, and that at least 10 percent of the workforce be residents of the city's impoverished Ward 8. But developers complained that few D.C. residents were prepared or trained for the jobs offered. The AWC established an employment organization to <b>help</b> <b>screen</b> D.C. residents who applied for jobs, better match residents to positions that they qualified for, and improve residents' job skills to better prepare them for the workplace. The organization would also help promote awareness of AWC redevelopment projects and job opportunities at those projects among Ward 7 and Ward 8 residents. This organization, known as the Business Resource Center, opened at 2311 Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue SE on April 11, 2007.|$|E

25|$|Cervical cancer {{represents}} {{the most common}} cause of cancer-related deaths—more than 3,000 deaths per year—among women in South Africa because of high HIV prevalence, making introduction of the vaccine highly desirable. A Papanicolaou test program was established in 2000 to <b>help</b> <b>screen</b> for cervical cancer, but since this program has not been implemented widely, vaccination would offer more efficient form of prevention. In May 2013 the Minister of Health of South Africa, Aaron Motsoaledi, announced the government would provide free HPV vaccines for girls aged 9 and 10 in the poorest 80% of schools starting in February 2014 and the fifth quintile later on. South Africa will be the first African country with an immunisation schedule that includes vaccines to protect people from HPV infection, but because the effectiveness of the vaccines in women who later become infected with HIV is not yet fully understood, it is difficult to assess how cost-effective the vaccine will be. Negotiations are currently underway for more affordable HPV vaccines since they are up to 10 times more expensive than others already included in the immunization schedule.|$|E
2500|$|G42 was {{a member}} of the Third Torpedo Boat Flotilla, Sixth Half-Flotilla of the High Seas Fleet at the Battle of Jutland. The 3rd Flotilla {{launched}} an unsuccessful torpedo attack against British Battlecruisers at about 18:37, and after turning away, exchanged fire with the crippled British destroyer [...] The British destroyer managed to immobilize the German destroyer [...] in this exchange before being sunk by a German torpedo.

2500|$|Although the {{handheld}} {{versions of}} the game feature updated graphics, the gameplay and game mechanics are identical to the original, with the storyline including the full twenty-one single-player missions from the original release (three Roman missions, three Viking missions, three Mayan missions, and a twelve mission Dark Tribe campaign). The main change to the game involves the HUD, which was redesigned so as to accommodate touchscreen controls. For example, rather than the building menu always present onscreen, it is accessed by pressing an icon which opens the [...] "Build Menu". From within this menu, the player then has access to various submenus, such as [...] "Basic Buildings", [...] "Food Buildings" [...] and [...] "Military Buildings." [...] Similarly, to access the menu to control specialist settlers, the player touches another icon, which is only available if the player has any such settlers available. Pressing down on any icon for two seconds brings up a brief <b>help</b> <b>screen</b> for that icon, and pausing the game allows the player to access a full help menu, replacing the [...] "Extended tool tips" [...] which appeared on-screen in the original.|$|E

60|$|With a lurid {{light in}} his eyes Wetzel now turned to the Indians. He would never leave that spot without sending a leaden {{messenger}} {{into the heart of}} someone in that camp. Glancing on all sides he at length selected a place where it was possible he might approach near enough to the camp to get a shot. He carefully studied the lay of the ground, the trees, rocks, bushes, grass,--everything that could <b>help</b> <b>screen</b> him from the keen eye of savage scouts. When he had marked his course he commenced his perilous descent. In an hour he had reached the bottom of the cliff. Dropping flat on the ground, he once more started his snail-like crawl. A stretch of swampy ground, luxuriant with rushes and saw-grass, made a part of the way easy for him, though it led through mud, and slime, and stagnant water. Frogs and turtles warming their backs in the sunshine scampered in alarm from their logs. Lizards blinked at him. Moccasin snakes darted wicked forked tongues at him and then glided out of reach of his tomahawk. The frogs had stopped their deep bass notes. A swamp-blackbird rose in fright from her nest in the saw-grass, and twittering plaintively fluttered round and round over the pond. The flight of the bird worried Wetzel. Such little things as these might attract the attention of some Indian scout. But he hoped that in the excitement of the war preparations these unusual disturbances would escape notice. At last he gained {{the other side of the}} swamp. At the end of the cornfield before him was the clump of laurel which he had marked from the cliff as his objective point. The Indian corn was now about five feet high. Wetzel passed through this field unseen. He reached the laurel bushes, where he dropped to the ground and lay quiet a few minutes. In the dash which he would soon make to the forest he needed all his breath and all his fleetness. He looked to the right to see how far the woods was from where he lay. Not more than one hundred feet. He was safe. Once in the dark shade of those trees, and with his foes behind him, he could defy the whole race of Delawares. He looked to his rifle, freshened the powder in the pan, carefully adjusted the flint, and then rose quietly to his feet.|$|E
