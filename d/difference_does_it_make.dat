40|$|One of {{the untold}} {{stories in the}} {{proliferation}} of independent media across Africa {{is the role of}} donor aid in this process. Overview This year, 2014, marks 25 years since the fall of the Berlin Wall and the symbolic end of the Cold War in 1989. It also marks the anniversary of the beginning of an extraordinary proliferation of media outlets in sub-Saharan Africa, which swept across the continent, freeing Africa’s press and liberating the airwaves from monopoly by the state. Economics, technology, and socio-political forces all played major roles in this boom of Africa’s media. But one of the untold stories of these changes is the role of donor aid in this process. This is the subject of the Center for International Media Assistance’s latest report, Africa’s Media Boom: The Role of International Aid, by veteran international media consultant Mary Myers. It explores these questions: 	How much of a catalyst were foreign donors in this mushrooming of Africa’s news media? 	What were the motives and mechanisms of this aid? 	What <b>difference</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>make</b> at the time, and subsequently? 	Was media proliferation necessarily a good thing–did it lead to pluralism and genuine freedom...|$|R

40|$|Developers often write {{reusable}} code in {{the form}} of libraries or components, at least in the C++ world.

The first part describes the state of the infrastructure library before patterns were used, and the second part describes the state after, and what <b>difference</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>make.</b> All examples are in C++. 1. BEFORE The infrastructure library has a collection of pointers to the abstract base class (ABC) Item as a part of its API. A client creates a concrete collection of Item * and passes it to the infrastructure. There are several reasons why we use a collection of pointers: the objects could be large; the same object could belong to several different collections and the duplication of objects is undesirable or unacceptable. All these objects must derive from the class Item, which declares some virtual functions. In order to use the infrastructure a client must use the same collections class library. There are two reasons why redesign was needed: • We have several applications that use different collection class libraries, and these applications need to be combined with the infrastructure library. You want to use a collection of your choice and if it is an associative collection to be sorted according to the collection; • There are cases when it is not feasible or desirable to make all classes inherit from the single class for a different reasons, legacy code, third party products, name clashes. - 1 - 1. 1. USAGE In the first implementation of the infrastructure the arguments to the function select( [...] .) were an object of type Criteria and an object of a concrete collection class; we will demonstrate this on an STL vector. This concrete class will contain pointers to Item, because the infrastructure returns Item * even if it really points to a derived class...|$|R

Unqualified practitioners not only fail to provide relief to patients but also contributes to spread of diseases e. g. Hepatitis C because {{of the use of}} infected syringes and delay in reaching appropriate diagnosis and generating misconceptions in public regarding health issues. There is need to create public awareness about health risks incurred when people visits unqualified dental practitioners. Methods: We reported the awareness level in people of Jamshoro/Hyderabad, regarding qualified and unqualified dental practitioner and what <b>difference</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> in treatment outcome. A descriptive type of study survey done on the sample comprising of 3087 individuals visited dental OPDs at LUMHS Jamshoro/Hyderabad during month of Oct, 2012. An assessment questionnaire comprising twelve items related to the objective was developed and administered to survey. Data is analyzed using MS Excel application software. Findings: The questionnaire was responded by 3059 individuals. Response rate was 99. 09 %, among respondents 53 % males and 47 % females. Only 68. 7 % patients reported that they were aware of difference in qualified and unqualified dental practitioners, 56 % individuals reported that they ask about qualification of dental of practitioner before treatment whether he is qualified or unqualified, 43 % individuals reported that qualified dental practitioner’s treatment is better outcome, 29 % individuals reported treatment outcome more or less similar whether it qualified or unqualified, 24 % individuals reported that unqualified dental practitioner’s treatment is better outcome. 66 % individuals reported that they like to visit unqualified dental practitioner because of socio-economic reasons, 23. 6 % individuals reported that they like to visit unqualified dental practitioner because they feel more comfortable, 10. 4 % individuals reported that they like to visit unqualified dental practitioner because of unavailability of qualified dental practitioners in their areas. Conclusions: Especial awareness campaigns should be launch to ensure that the masses refrain from going to unqualified dental practitioners. We can help out concerned authorities to play their role to curb the practices of unqualified dental practitioners. Key words: awareness, un-qualified practitioners, public, outcom...|$|R

40|$|In 1789, it was {{possible}} to speak of a federation of distinct states joined together for their mutual advantage, but today, it is rather the nation that is divided into subnational units. What caused this shift in focus from the states to the federal government? Surely, the transformation from a collection of thirteen historically separate states clustered along the Atlantic seaboard to a group of fifty states largely carved out of federal territory has played a role. Building on previous analysis of the economics of federalism, this Article considers the dynamic effects of increasing the number of states on the efficient allocation of government authority between the state and federal governments. When the number of states is low, the externalities imposed by state-level actions are more limited, and so is the scope of federal power. When the number increases, however, the scope of efficient federal power expands because the states face collective action problems. In the second Part of this Article, we apply these insights from the economics of federalism {{to the question of the}} optimal number of states in a federal system. Having too few states will lead to insufficient cohesion at the federal level, risking secession, and ensuring weak government. On the other end of the scale, having too many states encourages the centralization of power. While the optimal number of states in a federal system will ultimately depend on geography, legal culture, and technology, the available data suggest that the ten provinces of Canada may be too few, but the fifty states of the United States may well be too many. What <b>difference</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>make</b> to American federalism and constitutional law between 1791 and 1912 that the United States grew from being a federation of only thirteen coequal states to being a federation of forty-eight coequal states? This Article will attempt to speculate about that important question-a question which has not been systematically analyzed so far in the otherwise extensive law review literature on federalism. With its fifty states, the United States federation today has many more member units than it started out with and many more than do other federations around the world. Our thesis in this Article is that this trend in American federalism is a very consequential and under-appreciated development...|$|R

40|$|The {{international}} {{labour market}} {{has not been}} ?globalised? {{to the same degree}} over the last 40 years as have international markets for goods and capital. Immigration policies in developed economies clearly hinder the mobility of labour. But how much <b>difference</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> actually <b>make?</b> This paper compares emigration from Britain to four principal destinations in the era of free migration before 1914 with emigration to the same places since the 1960 s. As the doors were kept open to British emigrants for longer than most, the ?deglobalisation? of British labour only dates from the 1960 s. Since that time there has been a secular fall in British emigration, and this has been a major component in the transformation of the UK from a country of net emigration to one of net immigration. Before 1914 the economic and demographic forces that drove British emigration can be clearly identified. The same effects, applied to the later period, suggest that mass emigration from Britain should have continued until the early 1990 s. But from the mid 1960 s these influences became less powerful as they were increasingly inhibited by immigration policies in the principal destination countries. The decline in emigration is largely accounted for by shifts in policy, especially those that curtailed or abolished the preferences previously extended to settlers from the UK...|$|R
