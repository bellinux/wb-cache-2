5000|$|Up {{until the}} 1950s, most farms and many {{households}} kept a pig {{as part of}} their regular husbandry and means of self-sufficiency. Over time a local variety of pig was bred that was suited to the cooler and wetter climate in Cumberland. It was known as the Cumberland Pig, and this is where the product takes its name from. [...] The Cumberland pig was a <b>heavy</b> <b>pig</b> with an upturned snout and ears that flopped forwards. Its meat had a distinctive quality and flavour that was unique. Heavy boned, slow to mature, and extremely hardy, the creature became a symbol of the region, but was allowed to die out in the early 1960s at Bothel. [...] As an alternative, Large Black, Gloucestershire Old Spots and Welsh breeds can be used. The Cumberland pig breed has now been revived, although not officially recognised by the Rare Breeds Survival Trust.|$|E

Physical and chemical traits were similar {{for the two}} typologies of weight, whereas lower values of moisture (P< 0. 01) and higher fat content (P< 0. 05) were found in heavy pork loin; furthermore increased slaughter weight resulted in redder, more yellow and intensive colour (P< 0. 05). A selected and trained panel carried out difference from control test showing that <b>heavy</b> <b>pig</b> loin scored higher for appearance and taste parameters (P< 0. 05), but lower for tenderness (P< 0. 05). <b>Heavy</b> <b>pig</b> loin was redder, more marbling, wetter, sweeter, and saltier and had higher metallic flavour and lower tenderness...|$|E

40|$|It is {{generally}} accepted {{that the ability}} of pigs to digest protein increases with age. However, {{it has been shown}} that small pigs excreted more endogenous nitrogen (N) than large pigs. Consequently, the apparent amino acids (AA) digestibility may be lower in young pigs while true digestibility, which is corrected for endogenous losses, may be comparable with that found in older pigs. To test this hypothesis, six cannulated piglets (mean body weight 20. 6 kg) fitted with a simple T-cannula at terminal ileum were used to estimate apparent and true digestibilities of AA and of total N in a rye-based diet (96 % rye). The digestibility study was repeated on the same pigs fed the same diet when they reached mean body weight 61. 7 kg. The apparent ileal digestibilities of total AA and total N were significantly higher in <b>heavier</b> <b>pigs</b> than in piglets. Except for methionine and phenylalanine, the apparent digestibilities of individual AA showed a similar pattern. In contrast, there was no significant difference between piglets and <b>heavier</b> <b>pigs</b> for the true ileal digestibility of total N. True digestibility of most AA was lower in <b>heavier</b> <b>pigs</b> than in piglets, the differences for total and some individual AA being significant. The present results suggest that the higher apparent digestibility values found in <b>heavier</b> <b>pigs</b> as compared to piglets are due to the confounding effect of endogenous N losses rather than the better ability of older pigs to digest protein...|$|R

40|$|Swine research, 2005 {{is known}} as Swine day, 2005 Two studies were {{conducted}} {{to determine whether the}} amount of dietary energy fed to pigs of different weight categories influenced growth performance, market weight, and economic return in a commercial grow-finish facility. In Experiment 1, a total of 1, 032 pigs with initial weight of 67. 7 lb were individually weighed, fitted with electronic ear tags, and sorted into ten, 5 -lb weight categories. Pigs were then allotted to pens lighter and heavier then the barn mean or to pens remixed to create a normal distribution around the mean. To complete the 2 × 3 factorial, pigs were fed corn-soybean meal diets, with or without 6 % choice white grease. For the overall trial, there were no fat × weight-category interactions (P> 0. 15). Pigs fed 6 % added fat tended (P 0. 15) SD or CV of gain for the overall trial. For weight category, regardless of diet, <b>heavy</b> <b>pigs</b> grew faster (P 0. 25).

Journal of Animal Science, 94, 7 - 8. doi: 10. 2527 /msasas 2016 - 016 A total of 1092 finishing pigs (initially 36. 3 ± 1. 2 kg BW) were used in a 117 -d study to evaluate the impact of initial floor space allowance and removal strategy on the growth of finishing pigs up to 140 kg. There were 4 experimental treatments with 14 pens per treatment. The first treatment stocked pigs at 0. 91 m 2  (15 pigs/pen) throughout {{the duration of the}} study. The other 3 treatments initially stocked pigs at 0. 65 m 2  (21 pigs/pen) and were subject to 1 of 3 removal strategies. The second treatment (2 : 2 : 2) removed the 2 <b>heaviest</b> <b>pigs</b> from pens on d 64, 76, and 95. Treatment 3 (2 : 4) removed the 2 <b>heaviest</b> <b>pigs</b> on d 76 and the 4 <b>heaviest</b> <b>pigs</b> on d 105. Treatment 4 (6) removed the <b>heaviest</b> 6 <b>pigs</b> on d 105. All pigs remaining in pens after removals were fed to d 117. Overall (d 0 to 117), pigs initially provided 0. 91 m 2  of floor space had increased (P < 0. 05) ADG compared with pigs in pens on the 2 : 4 or 6 removal strategy. Pigs initially provided 0. 91 m 2  of floor space had increased (P < 0. 05) ADFI compared with pigs initially provided 0. 65 m 2  of floor space. Feed efficiency was poorer for pigs initially provided 0. 91 m 2  of floor space compared with pigs on the 2 : 2 : 2 or 2 : 4 removal strategy. Total BW gain per pen was greater (P < 0. 05) for pens initially stocked at 0. 65 m 2  compared with pens initially stocked at 0. 91 m 2.

At slaughtering, forty carcasses were sampled randomly. The T carcasses had lower backfat thickness (P vs 60. 64 %; P< 0. 01) and lean meat yield (P< 0. 07). In trial 2, 42 pigs [Dumeco Cofok x (LxLW) ], evenly divided into three groups, were fed the same feed containing respectively 10 (C), 60 (T 1) and 110 ppm (T 2) PA, from 95 to 165 kg live weight.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{influence}} of long-term fat supplementation on the fatty acid profile of <b>heavy</b> <b>pig</b> adipose tissue. Fifty-four Large White barrows, averaging 25 kg LW, were randomized (matched weights) to one of three isoenergetic diets supplemented with either tallow (TA), maize oil (MO), or rapeseed oil (RO). The fats were supplement- ed at 3 % as fed from 25 to 110 kg LW, and at 2. 5 % from 110 kg to slaughtering. Following slaughter at about 160 kg LW, backfat samples were collected from ten animals per treatment and analyzed. Fatty acid composition of backfat close- ly reflected the fatty acid composition of the supplemented fats. The backfat of pigs fed TA had the highest saturated fatty acid content (SFA) (P< 0. 01); those fed MO had the highest content in polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) and the lowest in monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) content; those fed RO had the highest content of linolenic acid (C 18 : 3) and cis 11 - ecosenoic acid (C 20 : 1). Only MO treatment had an effect on linoleic acid levels and the iodine value (IV) of backfat, result- ing in levels higher than those (IV = 70; C 18 : 2 = 15 %) accepted by the Parma Consortium for dry-cured ham. The IV and unsaturation index in both layers of subcutaneous backfat tissue differed significantly between treatments. These results show that long-term dietary supplementation with different fats changes the fatty acid profile of <b>heavy</b> <b>pig</b> adipose tissue. Supplementation with rapeseed oil increases the proportion of “healthy” fatty acids in pig fat, thereby improving the nutritional quality, however the effects on the technological quality of the fat must be carefully assessed...|$|E

The animals were individually housed in open circuit respiration chambers to determine the energy metabolism. The dietary treatments were as follows [% on dry matter (DM) ]: i) diet C (control) : 14. 2 crude protein (CP), 3. 7 EE, 13. 8 NDF; ii) diet B 05 : diet C plus 0. 5 % benzoic acid; iii) diet B 10 : diet C plus 1. 0 % benzoic acid. DM fed was fixed at 6. 8 % BW 0. 75. Apparent digestibility was similar among treatments for all the parameters studied. Nitrogen (N) retention was 35. 8, 37. 4, 41. 6 % of intake N for C, B 05 and B 10, respectively, with no significant difference. Energy and phosphorus balances were not influenced by dietary treatments.
