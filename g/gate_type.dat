40|$|We {{investigate}} in {{a method}} for proving separation results for abstract classes of languages. A well established method to characterize varieties of regular languages are identities.

While the main concern of their result is {{the existence of these}} equations, we investigate in a general method that could allow to find equations for language classes in an inductive manner. Thereto we extend an important tool [...] the block product or substitution principle [...] known from logic and algebra, to non-regular language classes. Furthermore, we abstract this concept by defining it directly as an operation on (non-regular) language classes. We show that this principle can be used to obtain equations for certain circuit classes, given equations for the <b>gate</b> <b>types.</b> Concretely, we demonstrate the applicability of this method by obtaining a description via equations for all languages recognized by circuit families that contain a constant number of (inner) gates, given a description of the <b>gate</b> <b>types</b> via equations...|$|R
