With increasing complexity of components the requirements on the clamping systems are rising. This paper shows the investigation of drilling tests fordifferent types of clamping positions which are examined regarding their influence on the resulting workpiece quality. The clamping of the planar specimens was realized by 3 and 4 points and by a ring clamping system with variable distances from the <b>drill</b> <b>axis</b> to the fixed points. During the experiments the process forces were measured and the resulting delamination and fiber pullouts at the workpiece surface were determined. The results demonstrate that the distance from the <b>drill</b> <b>axis</b> to the fixed points has a significant influence on the process forces and the achievable workpiece quality...|$|E

40|$|A {{mechanism}} for breaking off and retaining a core sample of a drill drilled into a ground substrate has an outer drill tube and an inner core break-off tube sleeved inside the drill tube. The break-off tube breaks off and retains the core sample by a varying geometric relationship of {{inner and outer}} diameters with the drill tube. The inside diameter (ID) of the drill tube is offset by a given amount with respect to its outer diameter (OD). Similarly, the outside diameter (OD) of the break-off tube is offset by the same amount with respect to its inner diameter (ID). When the break-off tube and drill tube are in one rotational alignment, the two offsets cancel each other such that the drill can operate the two tubes together in alignment with the <b>drill</b> <b>axis.</b> When the tubes are rotated 180 degrees to another positional alignment, the two offsets add together causing the core sample in the break-off tube to be displaced from the <b>drill</b> <b>axis</b> and applying shear forces to break off the core sample...|$|E
40|$|Studying the {{influence}} of defect on the dynamic behavior of wood in order to detect the local heterogeneities is of great importance in non-destructive testing of wood. The natural heterogeneities in wood are oriented in a volume. However, one- dimensional models are still used in dynamic characterization of wooden beams. The {{aim of this study}} was to experimentally investigate the effects of the orientation and position of an artificial defect on the flexural vibration frequencies. Different batches of Fagus orientalis specimens were drilled in the radial direction at five positions along the specimen. Dynamic tests in free flexural vibration were performed on the specimens before and after drilling both in the longitudinal-radial (LR) and longitudinal-tangential (LT) bending plan. The behavior in free flexural vibration was found to be different depending on the position and orientation of heterogeneity. When the <b>drilling</b> <b>axis</b> lies in the bending plane (LR), the weakening of frequency was maximal at the location of an antinode of vibration. On the contrary, the frequency offset was maximal in the place of a vibration node when the <b>drilling</b> <b>axis</b> was orthogonal to the bending plane (L T). (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
50|$|The {{apparatus}} {{consists of}} a massive drilling machine mounted on a framework {{that is a little}} like a short section of railroad track. At one end of the track, nearest the audience, is a raised frame large enough to hold a person. At the beginning of the performance the drill is positioned {{at the far end of}} the track with its long helical drill bit pointing horizontally forwards. The performer is chained to the frame with her torso in line with the <b>drilling</b> <b>axis.</b> A cover, consisting of translucent paper stretched on a circular frame, is attached to the apparatus in front of the performer, obscuring the centre of her torso. The machine is then started: the drill bit rotates and the machine begins advancing slowly towards the performer. Then the device appears to go out of control and speed up (sometimes with pyrotechnics for added drama). The drill appears to penetrate through the struggling performer, whose legs, shoulders, arms and head remain in full view and whose lower torso is seen in silhouette through the translucent cover. The tip of the drill emerges and rips through the cover, at which point both the forward motion and rotation of the drill bit stop. The cover is removed to show the limp body of the performer seemingly impaled on the end of the drill. The machine then begins to tilt the <b>drilling</b> <b>axis</b> upwards, in the process pulling the performer from her restraints and raising her high into the air. When the <b>drill's</b> <b>axis</b> is vertical the bit begins to rotate again, spinning the performer's limply spreadeagled body around. The drill then stops and lowers the performer back onto the frame, where assistants cover her torso with a blanket and seemingly push the drill back out of her. The performer then appears to revive and steps from the apparatus to take a bow.|$|R

40|$|Electromagnetic {{position}} sensing in navigation of metallic instruments requires {{measures for}} compensating for error due to distortions of the generated electromagnetic field by the metallic objects. In dental implantology, the working volume can be modelled by a plate at a defined position. Pitch, yaw and movements along the <b>drill</b> <b>axis</b> {{of the tool}} in the active working volume are small. Thus, error compensation is necessary only for three degrees of freedom for this application. We build a setup for the instrument navigation with a field generator fixed to a patient seat and performed tool calibrations in a defined working volume. During calibration, a vector field of error vectors was found and stored in a look-up table. The pose-dependant error vectors are determined at fixed supporting points and defined rotations around the <b>drill</b> <b>axis</b> of the tool. Entries of the look-up table were used to compensate for errors during navigation. Two experiments were performed, both resulting in positioning accuracy below 1 mm.

First, a mechanistic force model is introduced to relate drilling forces to drill geometry and drilling process parameters.

40|$|A novel technique, {{referred}} to as a vector setting in the aerospace industry, has been developed for positioning and orienting drilling bushes on curved surfaces. The position and orientation of holes and their axes in parts and tooling in the aerospace industry must conform to strict tolerances; however, the process of locating and orienting the bushes in drilling plates having curved surfaces is slow and time consuming. This is because the existing process used is a trial and error one, and past research in automated drilling in the aerospace industry has not covered this area. A prototype device has been developed which reduces the setting time. The device has two angular adjustments, which are computed using specially written software. The device is used in conjunction with a 3 D spatial measurement system in order to determine reference points on the part or tooling and the device. Experimental results on a prototype indicate a substantial time saving as well as good accuracy in orienting the <b>drill</b> <b>axis</b> at a given point on a surface...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a robotic bone drilling and screwing system for applications in orthopedic surgery. The {{goal is to}} realize two robot manipulators performing cooperative bone drilling. The proposed cooperative bone drilling system {{can be divided into}} hardware and software development. The hardware development section consists of two robot manipulator arms, which perform drilling and gripping of the bone, and operates using two joysticks. The software section assists the surgeon in visual and navigation control of those robot manipulators. Controller used in this system can be included in the hardware and software sections. Disturbance observer based position control was used in the robot manipulator maneuver and reposition controller (cooperative control) was used in cooperative drilling operation to maintain the alignment of the drill bit during drilling. A mathematical model for the control system was designed and a real environment mimicking simulation for bone drilling was designed. The result of the simulation shows that the cooperative robot system managed to perform cooperative drilling when misalignment occurs during bone drilling. The bone gripping robot managed to restore the drill bit to its ideal alignment in every event of misalignment in the <b>drilling</b> <b>axis.</b> Therefore this cooperative system has potential application in experimental orthopedic surgery...|$|R

40|$|Nowadays, {{there are}} no {{systematic}} methodologies for evaluating life assessment of the rail, and few systems provide the measures of vertical and lateral forces that train exchanges with the rail. These systems are quite expensive and require the substitution of {{a portion of the}} track. In the present paper is presented a simple transducer (MPQY) for measuring, at the same time, the vertical and lateral forces. The easy installation and use of this instrument are its main characteristics. It is sufficient to put it in a hole, made in the rail web in the concurrence of the <b>drilling</b> <b>axis,</b> and connect it to the transmitting station for measuring for each convoy the vertical and lateral forces induced by each wheel. It can be also used for analysing speed and mass of trains and the specific derailment ratio. In addition, by using a damage model, it is possible to estimate the residual life of a rail. In order to do this, a linear model of rolling contact fatigue damage is implemented and tested with same experimental acquisitions. Another application of this transducer can be identified in the variation of the mechanical behaviour of ballast. In fact, by using the information coming from the MPQY and comparing it with the flexural moment measurement, it is possible to evaluate the variation of ballast behaviour with respect to time and set new parameters for ballast maintenance and train safety...|$|R

(i) In drilling used the standard type drill that the chisel edge is not modified, the length of a transient period in thrust force makes a difference from material to material. Carbon-steel has the longest period and brass has the shortest one. (ii) It was confirmed from the measured results of thrust that type P and N_ 1 thinning were more effective than other for drilling carbon-steel and aluminium alloy, and type P thinning was the most effective on brass, (iii) Moreover, it was recognized from the measurements of dimensional difference between the drilled hole diameter and the drill diameter that the difference was able to reduce by making a choice of appropriate thinning for work-materials. The reason is that the thrust decreases by thinning and as the results a deflection of <b>drill</b> <b>axis</b> reduces...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — We are {{investigating}} the use of photoacoustic (PA) imaging to detect critical structures, such as the carotid artery, that may be located behind the bone being drilled during robot-assisted endonasal transsphenoidal surgery. In this system, the laser is mounted on the drill (via an optical fiber) and the 2 D ultrasound (US) probe is placed elsewhere on the skull. Both the drill and the US probe are tracked relative to the patient reference frame. PA imaging provides two advantages compared to conventional B-mode US: (1) the laser penetrates thin layers of bone, and (2) the PA image displays targets {{that are in the}} laser path. Thus, the laser can be used to (non-invasively) extend the <b>drill</b> <b>axis,</b> thereby enabling reliable detection of critical structures that may reside in the drill path. This setup creates a challenging alignment problem, however, because the US probe must be placed so that its image plane intersects the laser line in the neighborhood of the target anatomy (as estimated from preoperative images). This paper reports on a navigation system developed to assist with this task, and the results of phantom experiments that demonstrate that a critical structure can be detected with an accuracy of approximately 1 mm relative to the drill tip.

40|$|HYPOTHESIS A {{previously}} developed image-guided {{robot system}} can safely drill a tunnel from the lateral mastoid surface, through the facial recess, {{to the middle}} ear, as {{a viable alternative to}} conventional mastoidectomy for cochlear electrode insertion. BACKGROUND Direct cochlear access (DCA) provides a minimally invasive tunnel from the lateral surface of the mastoid through the facial recess to the middle ear for cochlear electrode insertion. A safe and effective tunnel drilled through the narrow facial recess requires a highly accurate image-guided surgical system. Previous attempts have relied on patient-specific templates and robotic systems to guide drilling tools. In this study, we report on improvements made to an image-guided surgical robot system developed specifically for this purpose and the resulting accuracy achieved in vitro. MATERIALS AND METHODS The proposed image-guided robotic DCA procedure was carried out bilaterally on 4 whole head cadaver specimens. Specimens were implanted with titanium fiducial markers and imaged with cone-beam CT. A preoperative plan was created using a custom software package wherein relevant anatomical structures of the facial recess were segmented, and a drill trajectory targeting the round window was defined. Patient-to-image registration was performed with the custom robot system to reference the preoperative plan, and the DCA tunnel was drilled in 3 stages with progressively longer drill bits. The position of the drilled tunnel was defined as a line fitted to a point cloud of the segmented tunnel using principle component analysis (PCA function in MatLab). The accuracy of the DCA was then assessed by coregistering preoperative and postoperative image data and measuring the deviation of the drilled tunnel from the plan. The final step of electrode insertion was also performed through the DCA tunnel after manual removal of the promontory through the external auditory canal. RESULTS Drilling error was defined as the lateral deviation of the tool in the plane perpendicular to the <b>drill</b> <b>axis</b> (excluding depth error). Errors of 0. 08 ± 0. 05 mm and 0. 15 ± 0. 08 mm were measured on the lateral mastoid surface and at the target on the round window, respectively (n = 8). Full electrode insertion was possible for 7 cases. In 1 case, the electrode was partially inserted with 1 contact pair external to the cochlea. CONCLUSION The purpose-built robot system was able to perform a safe and reliable DCA for cochlear implantation. The workflow implemented in this study mimics the envisioned clinical procedure showing the feasibility of future clinical implementation...|$|E

30|$|To {{position}} {{the axis of}} the fixator hinge, {{it is essential to}} identify the elbow rotation axis on fluoroscopy and <b>drill</b> an <b>axis</b> pin (Kirschner wire) through it. However, we showed in a previous fluoroscopic simulation study that the intraoperative accuracy to identify the elbow rotation axis is low and associated with substantial error [10]. Madey et al. [10] showed that applying an external fixator with 5 ° or 10 ° incongruence relative to the elbow axis, which was a common error in our previous fluoroscopic simulation study, results in a 3.7 - and 7.1 -fold increase in motion resistance, respectively [8]. Such incongruence often results in morbidity and secondary procedures. In a recent prospective study of hinged external elbow fixation, 19 % of patients had elbow incongruence resulting from fixator malalignment, and these patients all required secondary procedures for fixator realignment or replacement [6].|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe study {{deals with}} a {{proposal}} and experimental study on the tilted planetary motion drilling for CFRP.

The tilted angle is adjustable from 0 to 2 degrees. Because of tool rotation axis is tilted, penetration is not caused by outermost cutting edges but inner cutting edges. If penetration could be occurred, the inner cutting edges penetrate firstly, then the outermost edges enlarge drilled hole and these sequence can avoid generation of delaminations and burrs. The tilted planetary motion drilling has been demonstrated by the practical fundamental drilling experiment by use of a high-speed spindle unit and a lathe as imitating tilted planetary motion.

40|$|The {{increasing}} reliance of the United States {{on imported}} energy is most {{critical in the}} area of transportation. One solution which is beginning to receive more favorable consideration after having lain dormant for several years is the use of underground trains using magnetic levitation. The use of such a model of transport requires, however, a relatively rapid and inexpensive method of rock excavation. Conventional rock tunneling machines generally work by <b>drilling</b> the central <b>axis</b> of the tunnel first and then successively breaking rock to that exposed surface. This is relatively inefficient and a new approach, in which the kerf is first excavated is herein described. The machine requires that a kerf be cut, wide enough to allow central core stress relief, {{around the edge of the}} tunnel before the rock inside the excavation is removed. A method for achieving this result at a productive rate is described. The method requires the combination of polycrystalline diamond inserts on the cutt [...] ...|$|R
30|$|A 1912 -m {{exploration}} corehole was <b>drilled</b> {{along the}} <b>axis</b> {{of the eastern}} Snake River Plain, Idaho. Two temperature logs run on the corehole display an obvious inflection point at about 960  m. Such behavior is indicative of downward fluid flow in the wellbore. The geothermal gradient above 935  m is 4.5  °C/km, while the gradient is 72 – 75  °C/km from 980 to 1440  m. Projecting the higher gradients upward to where they intersect the lower gradient on the temperature logs places {{the bottom of the}} cold, freshwater Snake River Plain aquifer, which suppresses the geothermal gradient at this location, at least 860  m below the surface. The average heat flow for the corehole between 983 and 1550  m is 132  mW/m 2. Although the maximum bottom-hole temperature extrapolated from a measured time–temperature curve was only 59.3  °C, geothermometers suggest an equilibrium temperature on the order of 125 – 140  °C based on a single fluid sample from 1070  m. Furthermore, below 960  m the basalt core shows obvious signs of alteration, including a distinct color change, the formation of smectite clay, and the presence of secondary minerals filling vesicles and fracture zones. This alteration boundary could act as an effective cap or seal for a hot-water geothermal system.|$|R
40|$|Sampling cores {{requires}} the controlled breakoff {{of the core}} at a known location {{with respect to the}} drill end. An additional problem is designing a mechanism that can be implemented at a small scale that is robust and versatile enough to be used for a variety of core samples. This design consists of a set of tubes (a drill tube and an inner tube) and a rolling element (rolling tooth). An additional tube {{can be used as a}} sample tube. The drill tube and the inner tube have longitudinal holes with the axes offset from the axis of each tube. The two eccentricities are equal. The inner tube fits inside the drill tube, and the sample tube fits inside the inner tube. While drilling, the two tubes are positioned relative to each other such that the sample tube is aligned with the <b>drill</b> tube <b>axis</b> and core. The drill tube includes teeth and flutes for cuttings removal. The inner tube includes, at the base, the rolling element implemented as a wheel on a shaft in an eccentric slot. An additional slot in the inner tube and a pin in the drill tube limit the relative motion of the two tubes. While drilling, the drill assembly rotates relative to the core and forces the rolling tooth to stay hidden in the slot along the inner tube wall. When the drilling depth has been reached, the drill bit assembly is rotated in the opposite direction, and the rolling tooth is engaged and penetrates into the core. Depending on the strength of the created core, the rolling tooth can score, lock the inner tube relative to the core, start the eccentric motion of the inner tube, and break the core. The tooth and the relative position of the two tubes can act as a core catcher or core-retention mechanism as well. The design was made to fit the core and hole parameters produced by an existing bit; the parts were fabricated and a series of demonstration tests were performed. This invention is potentially applicable to sample return and in situ missions to planets such as Mars and Venus, to moons such as Titan and Europa, and to comets. It is also applicable to terrestrial applications like forensic sampling and geological sampling in the field...|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} carried in {{conjunction}} with the Orthodontic department at Halmstad General Hospital in Sweden to investigate the possibility of reducing cost and manufacture time of dental implant drill guides. The current system involves sending a digital image in STL format to the Materialise factory in Belgium where information of the position of dental implants is translated onto a moulded mouthpiece. Drill guides are placed in the mouth piece which is then returned to the surgeon. The mouthpiece complete with drill guides is then placed in the patients mouth and used as a guide for the implant drill holes. The cost of 10000 sek and a turnaround time of 2 weeks gave rise to the need for a faster and cheaper solution. A new mouthpiece was designed comprising of a solid cube which could be clearly seen on the x-ray. Linearisation of the cube faces is used to find a reference point from which to drive a 5 <b>axis</b> <b>drilling</b> platform. The mouthpiece is placed in the drill platform which is driven by stepper motors which in turn are controlled by a microcontroller. Co-ordinates are entered via a PC interface. The PC software then translates these co-ordinates into motor steps which are sent to the microcontroller. The drill platform then positions the mouthpiece in order to drill guide holes for the dental implants. The study showed that the machine design gave an acceptable degree of accuracy and repeatability. Further enhancements could be made by automating the detection of the cube using image analysis techniques. The study was also limited by the lack of graphical and geometrical data concerning the position of the implant. For {{the purpose of this study}} the co-ordinates for the implants guides is entered by hand. It was concluded that further software and hardware enhancement would be needed before the application could be developed commercially...|$|R
