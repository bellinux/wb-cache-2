A novel electrostatic dust detector, based on a fine grid of <b>interlocking</b> <b>circuit</b> traces biased to 30 or 50 ν has been developed {{for the detection of}} dust particles on remote surfaces in air and vacuum environments. Impinging dust particles create a temporary short circuit and the resulting current pulse is recorded by counting electronics. Up to 90 % of the particles are ejected from the grid or vaporized suggesting the device may be useful for controlling dust inventories. We report measurements of the sensitivity of a large area (5 x 5 cm) detector to microgram quantities of dust particles and review its applications to contemporary tokamaks and ITER...|$|E
40|$|Methods {{to measure}} the {{inventory}} of dust particles and to remove dust if it approaches safety limits will be required in next-step tokamaks such as ITER. An electrostatic dust detector, based on a fine grid of <b>interlocking</b> <b>circuit</b> traces, biased to 30 or 50 V, has been developed {{for the detection of}} dust on remote surfaces in air and vacuum environments. Gaining operational experience of dust detection on surfaces in tokamaks is important, however the level of dust generated in contemporary short-pulse tokamaks is comparatively low and high sensitivity is necessary to measure dust on a shot-by-shot basis. We report on modifications in the detection electronics that have increased the sensitivity of the electrostatic dust detector by a factor of up to 120, - a level suitable for measurements on contemporary tokamaks...|$|E
40|$|The {{inventory}} of dust in next-step magnetic fusion devices will be regulated for safety reasons, however diagnostics to measure in-vessel dust {{are still in}} their infancy. Advances in dust particle detection on remote surfaces are reported. Two grids of <b>interlocking</b> <b>circuit</b> traces with spacing in the range 125 mu m to 25 mu m are biased to 30 V. Impinging dust creates a short circuit and the result current pulse is recorded. The detector response was measured with particles scraped from a carbon fiber composite tile and sorted by size category. The finest 25 mu m grid showed a sensitivity more than {{an order of magnitude}} higher than the 125 mu m grid. The response to the finest particle categories (5  30 mu m) was two orders of magnitude higher than the largest (125  250 mu m) category. Longer duration current pulses were observed from the coarser particles. The results indicate a detection threshold for fine particles below 1 mu g/cm^ 2...|$|E

5000|$|Power signalling, however, was {{installed}} in two signal boxes, one at {{the north and the}} other at the south of Doncaster station. The work was planned and some equipment was on site before the Second World War but the installation was not commissioned until 1949. Searchlight colour light signals and electric point machines were controlled from switch panels. The interlocking equipment was unique being a sequence switch interlocking system manufactured by Standard Telephone Company using telephone switching techniques to the technical specification of the signal engineer of the then Southern Area of the London and North Eastern Railway. The sequence switches consisted of a rotary contact shaft which was rotated to a route position and proved a circuit through contact wipers. Each switch had a [...] "home" [...] position and eleven route positions. When a route was initiated, a clutch was engaged on the appropriate switch to rotate it into its correct position thus setting up the appropriate <b>interlocking</b> <b>circuits</b> through other switches and relays.

50|$|The MIPS ISA {{is based}} on a 32-bit word. It {{supported}} 32-bit addressing, and is word-addressed. It is a load/store architecture - all references to memory use load and store instructions that copied data between the main memory and 32 general-purpose registers (GPRs). All other instructions, such as integer arithmetic, operated on the GPRs. It possessed a basic instruction set consisting of instructions for control flow, integer arithmetic, and logical operations. To minimize pipeline stalls, all instructions except for load and store had to be executed in one clock cycle. There were no instructions for integer multiplication or division, or operations for floating-point numbers. The architecture exposed all hazards caused by the five-stage pipeline with delay slots. The compiler scheduled instructions to avoid hazards resulting in incorrect computation whilst simultaneously ensuring that the generated code minimized execution time. MIPS instructions are 16 or 32 bit long. The decision to expose all hazards was motivated by the desire to maximize performance by minimizing critical paths, which <b>interlock</b> <b>circuits</b> lengthened. Instructions were packed into 32-bit instruction words (as MIPS is word-addressed). A 32-bit instruction word could contain two 16-bit operations. These were included {{to reduce the size of}} machine code. The MIPS microprocessor was implemented in NMOS logic.|$|R
40|$|Summaries The author {{reflects}} on the <b>interlocking</b> <b>circuits</b> of accumulation and consumption that characterise the management of household solid waste or garbage in two South Asian cities. She examines the multiple axes of inequality and interdependence that characterise the social relations of residential waste work. Interactions are explored among household members, and between them and paid waste workers such as domestic workers, sweepers and pickers. The article challenges gender stereotypes of women having a special affinity with the environment, {{at least in the}} context of the urban environment and solid waste management. It also rejects any essentialist linking of particular social groups to waste and dirty work, arguing that in the case of both gender and caste relations, association with waste is socially constructed. It is argued that women's responsibility for waste management in the household gender division of labour is mediated by both wealth and poverty. Equally, that particular groups of waste workers have occupational niches in different areas of waste work is mediated by gender and caste?like relations. A case is made for recognising the micro?politics of household and residential solid waste management in policy formulation and planning. The article proposes that this has implications both for effective waste management and for policies concerned to integrate anti?poverty strategies in efforts to improve the managment of urban services...|$|R
50|$|On a gate stock train, each of {{the cars}} had its own conductor, who was {{responsible}} for the operation of the doors on that car. It was originally planned to work the air operated doors in a similar fashion, but the method adopted was for all the doors on a 3-car train to be controlled by a guard {{at the rear of the}} motor car. This reduced the number of staff needed to operate a 6-car train from seven to three, consisting of a driver, a rear guard and a front guard. Each guard controlled the doors on the three cars at his end of the train. The cars were initially fitted with yellow flipper arms, which protruded from the side of the vehicle when a door was open, and enabled staff to identify doors which had not yet closed. The design was unsatisfactory, and the arms were replaced by indicator lamps interlocked to the air engines in 1924. Traction control circuits and door operating circuits were carried along the train by 10-core jumpers fitted at roof height between the cars. There were two lighting circuits, one fed from {{each of the}} motor cars. It was possible to operate a 3-car train, but in order to do so, a shorting plug had to be fitted to the control trailer, to connect the lighting circuits, and to complete the door <b>interlock</b> <b>circuit.</b>|$|R

40|$|Due to {{imperfection}} of {{the single}} path absorption, ECRH at ASDEX Upgrade (AUG) is always accompanied by stray radiation in the vacuum vessel. New ECRH scenarios with O 2 and X 3 heating schemes extend the operational space, but they have also the potential to increase the level of stray radiation. There are hazards for invessel components. Damage on electric cables has already been encountered. It is therefore necessary to monitor and control the ECRH {{with respect to the}} stray radiation level. At AUG a system of Sniffer antennas equipped with microwave detection diodes is installed. The system is part of the ECRH <b>interlock</b> <b>circuit.</b> We notice, however, that during plasma operation the variations of the Sniffer antenna signal are very large. In laboratory measurements we see variations of up to 20 dB in the directional sensitivity and we conclude that an interference pattern is formed inside the copper sphere of the antenna. When ECRH is in plasma operation at AUG, the plasma is acting as a phase and mode mixer for the millimeter waves and thus the interference pattern inside the sphere changes with the characteristic time of the plasma dynamics. In order to overcome the difficulty of a calibrated measurement of the average stray radiation level, we installed bolometer and pyroelectric detectors, which intrinsically average over interference structures due to their large active area. The bolometer provides a robust calibration but with moderate temporal resolution. The pyroelectric detector provides high sensitivity and a good temporal resolution, but it raises issues of possible signal drifts in long pulses...|$|R

Heynh. TOC 1 and its four paralogues, the Arabidopsis PSEUDO-RESPONSE REGULATOR (PRR) genes, are expressed in an intriguing daily sequence.

We show that prr 9 and prr 5 null mutants have reciprocal period defects for multiple circadian rhythms, consistent with subtly altered expression patterns of CCA 1 and TOC 1.

Thus PRR 9 and PRR 5 modulate light input to the circadian clock but are neither uniquely required for rhythm generation nor form a linear series of mutual PRR gene regulation...|$|R
40|$|Jong-Hyen Baek) Abstract – To {{improve the}} {{efficiency}} and safety of railway systems, the train control system has been considerably evolved from the ground-equipment-based control system (e. g. track <b>circuit,</b> <b>interlocking</b> system, etc.) into the on-board-equipment-based control system. In addition, this train control system enables the rolling stock to intelligently control the trackside facilities by introducing the {{information and communication technologies}} (ICT). Accordingly, since the ICT-based train control system makes the railway system be simplified (i. e. the heavy ground-equipment can be removed), the efficient and cost-effective railway system can be realized. In this paper, we perform the feasibility test of the ICT-based train control system via a simulation. To this end, we have developed the prototypes of the on-board controller and wayside object control units which control the point and crossing gate and performed the integrated operation simulation in a testbed. In this paper, before the field test of the on-board-controller-based train control system, we perform the Consecutive operation test for prototypes of the on-board controller, wayside object control unit...|$|R
50|$|It is {{impossible}} to know precisely how many accidents were prevented by the proper observation of the rule, and it could not always prevent a crash. At Winwick, a train was brought to a stand some distance from the signal box. The fireman left promptly to carry out the rule, but he had not reached the signal box before his train was struck. To prevent such occurrences, 'call plungers' (which operate an indicator in the signal box when pressed) or telephones were installed at some signal posts, or track circuits installed. However, even this solution was not completely foolproof e.g. at Castlecary in 1937, the signalman observed that a train had passed a signal at danger, possibly due to a false signal indication, and assumed it had continued on past his signal box. The signalman failed to check his track circuit indicators, which would have shown that the train stopped, and the fireman arrived in the signal box moments too late to stop the signalman accepting a following express train. Full <b>interlocking</b> with track <b>circuits</b> and signal indications might have prevented this accident.|$|R
40|$|This thesis investigates {{ytterbium}} doped {{tantalum pentoxide}} as a material system for realising waveguide lasers on silicon substrate, {{as a basis}} to provide {{the next generation of}} mass-producible, low-cost planar devices with many <b>interlocking</b> photonic <b>circuits</b> for multi-functionality. Numerical modelling of symmetrical rib waveguide in Ta 2 O 5 was carried out finding an optimum waveguide design for a near-circular mode profile with maximum confinement of light within the core with various etch depths and rib widths. A numerical study investigating the feasibility of integrated Kerr lens elements for future mode-locking was carried out, predicting that a Kerr lens slab with a length of 20 µm with input and out waveguides was able to achieve a 9 % modulation depth for input intensity of 6 GW/m 2. Thin films were fabricated by RF magnetron sputtering onto a silicon substrate with 2. 5 µm silica layer from a powder pressed Yb:Ta 2 O 5 target, with shallow rib waveguides realised using photolithography and ion beam milling. The excited-state lifetime of Yb:Ta 2 O 5 was measured to be 0. 25 ± 0. 03 ms, and peak emission and absorption cross-sections were determined to be 2. 9 ± 0. 7 × 10 - 20 cm 2 and 2. 75 ± 0. 2 × 10 - 20 cm 2 respectively, with the fluorescence spectrum giving a broadband emission from 990 nm to 1090 nm. Finally a 10. 8 mm long waveguide laser in Ta 2 O 5 doped with ~ 6. 2 × 10 ^ 20 Yb atoms/cm 3 of ytterbium oxide was demonstrated with a laser cavity formed from a combination of high reflective mirrors with output couplers or reflections from the bare end-facets with Fresnel reflectivity of 12 %. In a 5. 4 µm wide waveguide, lasing was observed between 1015 nm and 1030 nm when end-pumped with a 977 nm laser diode with the highest output power of 25 mW at a wavelength of 1025 nm with an absorbed pump power of 120 mW for a cavity formed by a high reflector mirror and a bare end-facet at the output. In this case, the absorbed pump power threshold and slope efficiency were measured to be ~ 30 mW and ~ 26 % respectively. The results presented in this thesis demonstrate that tantalum pentoxide has great potential for mass-producible, integrated optical circuits on silicon using conventional CMOS fabrication technologies...|$|R
