5|$|Blue Shift {{is set in}} {{the same}} {{location}} and time frame as that of Half-Life, taking place at a remote New Mexico laboratory called the Black Mesa Research Facility. In Half-Life, the player takes on the role of Gordon Freeman, a scientist involved in an accident that opens an inter-dimensional portal to the borderworld of Xen, allowing the alien creatures of Xen to attack the facility. The player guides Freeman in an attempt to escape the facility and close the portal, ultimately traveling to Xen to do so. As in Opposing Force, Blue Shift shows the events of Half-Life {{from the perspective of a}} different protagonist. The player assumes the role of Barney Calhoun, a security guard working near the labs where the accident takes place. Calhoun is responsible for the preservation of <b>equipment</b> <b>and</b> <b>materials</b> and the welfare of research personnel, and after the accident turns Black Mesa into a warzone, he must work with Dr. Rosenberg, a high-ranking scientist involved in the experiment, to evacuate the facility.|$|E
5|$|Gas {{tungsten}} arc welding, {{because it}} affords {{greater control over}} the weld area than other welding processes, can produce high-quality welds when performed by skilled operators. Maximum weld quality is assured by maintaining cleanliness—all <b>equipment</b> <b>and</b> <b>materials</b> used must be free from oil, moisture, dirt and other impurities, as these cause weld porosity and consequently a decrease in weld strength and quality. To remove oil and grease, alcohol or similar commercial solvents may be used, while a stainless steel wire brush or chemical process can remove oxides from the surfaces of metals like aluminum. Rust on steels can be removed by first grit blasting the surface and then using a wire brush to remove any embedded grit. These steps are especially important when negative polarity direct current is used, because such a power supply provides no cleaning during the welding process, unlike positive polarity direct current or alternating current. To maintain a clean weld pool during welding, the shielding gas flow should be sufficient and consistent so that the gas covers the weld and blocks impurities in the atmosphere. GTAW in windy or drafty environments increases the amount of shielding gas necessary to protect the weld, increasing the cost and making the process unpopular outdoors.|$|E

5|$|The {{disposal}} of military <b>equipment</b> <b>and</b> <b>materials</b> {{was also a}} key priority {{after the end of}} the war. Equipment with civilian uses such as motor vehicles, clothing and housing were urgently needed to counter shortages in the civilian economy. The timing of equipment release had to be carefully planned, however, to avoid harming employment by creating surpluses of manufactured goods. Planning for the {{disposal of}} equipment began in 1943 and the Commonwealth Disposals Commission was established to oversee the sale or destruction of equipment on September 1944. Before the commission was established the Government decided that ex-military equipment would be offered to other government agencies before being made available to the public, that sales to the public were to be made on a 'as is, where is' basis and be processed through existing trade channels or public auction at 'fair market prices' and that payment was to be required in cash. Some special priorities were also established; farmers were to be given priority for motor vehicles, machine tools were to be allocated to ex-servicemen and training colleges and special consideration was to be given to the needs of the Red Cross and other overseas and domestic charitable associations.|$|E

40|$|The {{dimensioning}} {{of appropriate}} process <b>equipment</b> <b>and</b> <b>material</b> handling capacities for wafer fabs {{by means of}} simulation technique demands for an accurate prediction of the operational fab behavior. In order to get reliable data of maximum WIP and throughput of the fab, {{the implementation of the}} most crucial constraints and dispatching policies of the shop floor in the simulation model is an important prerequisite. This in turn is the information which is necessary for the fab design such as to designate storage capacities. Hence, future dispatching strategies should already be considered when performing simulation studies for the determination of process <b>equipment</b> capacities <b>and</b> the dimensioning of material handling systems. This gains even more importance for complex make-to-order manufacturing environments with a large quantity of process flows and strongly varying production orders. The paper points out the requirements of simulation models which are needed for an accurate analysis of process <b>equipment</b> <b>and</b> <b>material</b> handling capacities for highly complex wafer fabrication, especially in make-to-order manufacturing environment. The implementation of a customized manufacturing control strategy applied in the diffusion area for capacity modeling of process <b>equipment</b> <b>and</b> <b>material</b> handling is presented in detail...|$|R
