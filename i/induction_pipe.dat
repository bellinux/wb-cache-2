25|$|The EL {{introduced}} {{only minor}} running {{changes to the}} Falcon's base model straight-six engine, {{when compared to the}} radical overhaul presented by the EF. The coil-pack ignition system introduced in the EF was rolled back to the distributor-style ignition from the ED Falcon due to reliability problems. A divided air <b>induction</b> <b>pipe</b> which led to the throttle was replaced with a single, wider pipe. Engine output remained unchanged at 157kilowatts (211hp) and 357newton metres (263ft·lbf). In October 1997, the V8 engine fitted to the XR8 sports model was upgraded from 170kilowatts (228hp) to 185 (248hp). Torque figures were also upped from 398newton metres (294ft·lbf) to 402 (296ft·lbf).|$|E

50|$|During the 1920s Lanchesters competed {{directly}} with Rolls-Royce, {{taking care to}} undercut equivalent products from their double-barreled competitors by £50. Lanchesters were distinguished by the smoothness of the engines which George designed, {{paying close attention to}} detail. A particular triumph was the straight-eight engine that entered production in 1926 in the Lanchester Thirty, replacing the six-cylinder Lanchester 40.The drive shaft was located to minimise vibration, and close attention was paid to manifold design, with George even using transparent pipes to locate and remedy deposits appearing on the <b>induction</b> <b>pipes</b> at certain throttle settings.|$|R

5000|$|This valve {{worked by}} [...] "connecting {{the upper and}} lower valves so as to be worked by one rod or spindle, and in making the stem or tube which connects them hollow, so as to serve for an <b>induction</b> <b>pipe</b> to {{the upper end of the}} cylinder." [...] This allowed two valves to do the work of four.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} provide as much power as {{possible}} from the DB 601, the 100 used exhaust ejectors for a small amount of additional thrust. The supercharger inlet was moved from the normal position {{on the side of the}} cowling to a location in the leading edge of the left wing, which was also a feature of the earlier and larger He 119 experimental high-speed reconnaissance aircraft. Although cleaner-looking, the long, curved <b>induction</b> <b>pipe</b> most probably negated any benefit.|$|E
50|$|In {{common with}} other Le Rhône series engines, the 9J {{featured}} highly visible copper <b>induction</b> <b>pipes</b> {{and used a}} single push-pull rod to operate its two overhead valves. The main visual difference between the 9J and the earlier, less powerful Le Rhône 9C engine is that the copper intake manifold tubing (with round section lower ends) on the 110 hp 9J {{is attached to the}} crankcase behind the cylinders, whereas on the 9C (80 hp) the intake manifolds (with rectangular lower ends) are fully visible from the front.|$|R
50|$|Some {{explanation}} is required concerning the claimed bhp figures shown above. Jaguar used gross bhp figures throughout the production {{period of the}} Mk II and 240/340 models. A direct conversion into DIN bhp is not possible, {{but we know that}} the 3.8 Mk II engine developed around 190 bhp DIN. This compares with the later 4.2 XJ6 engine which also gave around 190 bhp DIN or 245 gross bhp, according to Jaguar, both being for 8:1 compression engines. The explanation was that the lower peak for the XJ6 4.2 engine meant that the bhp was being delivered at less rpm, for the same output. The camshaft timing and inlet and exhaust valve sizes were the same for the 2.4,3.4,3.8 Mk II and XJ6 4.2 engines, so the engines throttled themselves sooner in the bigger engine sizes. The later 4.2 XJ6 engines had special <b>induction</b> <b>pipes,</b> to reduce exhaust emissions, that crossed over between the inlet and exhaust sides of the engine, which reduced bhp to around 170 bhp on later production.|$|R
50|$|Having no moving parts, {{the engine}} works {{by having a}} coiled pipe in the {{combustion}} chamber that superheats the fuel (propane) before being injected into the air-fuel inlet. In the combustion chamber, the fuel/air mixture ignites and burns, creating thrust as it leaves through the exhaust <b>pipe.</b> <b>Induction</b> and compression of the fuel/air mixture is done both by the pressure of propane as its injected, along with the sound waves created by combustion acting on the intake stacks.|$|R
50|$|The {{hand-operated}} {{gear and}} rear-wheel brake controls {{are on the}} driver's right {{but there is a}} door for the driver which there was not on the 30-98 or 25. The spark and throttle levers are on the steering wheel together with an air lever working a valve in the <b>induction</b> <b>pipe</b> (after the throttle). There is also a mixture control (choke) on the dash. Gear and brake levers are well to hand. Accelerator and (transmission) brake pedals were set close together.|$|E
50|$|The dynamo {{is driven}} from the clutch casing {{so it is}} {{generating}} while the engine is running. The nearside of the engine carries the generator and magneto, the carburettor and its water-heated <b>induction</b> <b>pipe</b> with a proper hot-spot and the vacuum tank on the dash.The offside of the engine has the starter, steering-box, exhaust manifold, oil-dipper gauge and oil filler. The water connection between the lower casting and the cylinder head is through large external aluminium ports {{so there is a}} single compression joint between castings.|$|E
50|$|At introduction, {{the engine}} enjoyed {{considerable}} technological advancement compared with its competition, most notably being the lightest and shortest v6 in its class. It has fully automatically tensioned drive belts and adaptive Siemens EMS2000 engine management. The fuelling and ignition timing are constantly varied {{to match the}} load on the engine to improve refinement. The engine boasts Variable Geometry Induction, whereby air <b>induction</b> <b>pipe</b> lengths vary to optimise engine torque in response to different engine and road speeds, aiding refinement and efficiency. Although it bears the name of K Series, the engine has almost no components {{in common with the}} 4-cylinder version.|$|E
40|$|AbstractAn Elbow {{is one of}} {{the major}} {{component}} that make up the piping system of a nuclear power plant and chemical plant facilities. In general, the elbow is made by welding a straight pipe and bend part. So, periodic welding inspection is required due to the potential defects in weld zone. Recently, the application of <b>induction</b> heating <b>pipe</b> bend is increasing in order to reduce this problem. Pipe bend made by induction heating band is not necessary welding process because it is made by bending a straight pipe but the intrados thickness and the extrados thickness are different. On the other hand, J-integral is widely used to evaluate a structural integrity (to check crack stability) but the J estimation of pipe bend with un-uniform thickness is very difficult because of the thickness differences in each locations. This paper proposes a reference stress based J estimation scheme of circumferential through-wall cracked pipe bend with un-uniform thickness under in-plane opening bending loading condition. The pipe bend with un-uniform thickness is assumed to have different thickness between intrados and extrados and the crack to be located in the entre of the pipe bend, either at the intrados or extrados...|$|R
40|$|These {{calculations}} {{were developed}} {{as part of}} the ASHRAE 865 -RP project, and include tables that list the results for the 865 -RP accuracy tests, as well as the test conditions. These spreadsheets are also useful for developing educational materials, and can be used to check the values obtained from a computer simulation program that contain the exact same schematic as is shown for each system. With only a few exceptions, the formulas for the calculations have come from the ASHRAE Handbook, as indicated in the spreadsheet narrative. These spreadsheets were developed in the most basic Lotus *. wk 1 format and can be run in any spreadsheet that accepts Lotus *. wk 1 format. To use the spreadsheets the user loads the spreadsheet, updates only the values needed and recalculates the spreadsheet manually (i. e., press the F 9 button). Calculations are repeated column-wise in the spreadsheet to reach convergence. Each calculation represents one set of conditions. To obtain answers for multiple conditions the user will need to enter the new conditions and recalculate for each set of conditions. This report contains engineering calculations for seven (7) air-side, heating, ventilating and air conditioning systems (HVAC) systems, including: dual duct constant volume (DDCAV), dual duct variable volume (DDVAV), constant volume with reheat (CAVRH), and variable volume with reheat (VAVRH), four pipe fan coil unit (FC), four <b>pipe</b> <b>induction</b> unit (FI), and a single zone air conditioning system (SZ). These calculations are presented in spreadsheets that include a running commentary so that the reader can trace through the calculations to see what is being performed. Each system also contains a one-line diagram that shows the system being simulated and the location of the variables used in the calculation...|$|R
40|$|The {{last four}} decades have {{witnessed}} {{a significant change}} in the oil and gas offshore industry where field developments have moved from shallow water (10 metres to 100 metres) to deep water (100 metres to 1000 metres) and currently ultra deep water, 1000 metre and deeper. The subsea structures, components and pipelines have to stand such high external hydrostatic pressure which becomes in some cases the governing design criteria rather than the well pressure and temperature. This study focuses on <b>pipe</b> <b>induction</b> bends, which is a vital element in any ultra deep water subsea system. Bends are mainly used in the tie-in spools to connect pipeline end structures to manifolds or to well head trees. A significant amount of work has been conducted to study the behaviour of pipe bends under internal pressure in the last 150 years for its widely used applications in power plants, processing facilities and generic industrial use, however, minimal work has been conducted for pipe bends under external pressure for its rare applications. Oil and gas explorations and developments started to increase the demand of better understanding the pipe bend behaviour under high external pressure. As a result of the lack of knowledge and experimental work in this area, codes and standards have either considered it as a piping component or recommended quite stringent design criteria that more fits shallow water applications but is almost impossible to comply with deep water applications. Designers end up with required pipe wall thicknesses that exceed the manufacturing capabilities and the practical welding limits. This research investigates the failure modes of pipe bends subjected to external pressure and bending moments and presents a guideline on how to model, analyse and design these vital components for the subsea oil and gas fields developments. A limit state design criteria is proposed to enable the design of pipe bends, the proposed limit state design is in alignment with the current limit state design for pipelines...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{an investigation of}} the effects of piston-excited pressure waves in the plain <b>induction</b> <b>pipe</b> of a small, high-speed, single-cylinder air compressor. For a range of pipe lengths and diameters, compressor speeds and delivery pressures, the observed compressor throughput and driving torque are compared with those obtained with no intake pipe fitted. Based on classical laws of wave motion but using an experimentally obtained steady-flow characteristic for the inlet valve, a theoretical treatment is developed to describe the pressure pulsations in the inlet port and cylinder and to predict the change in airflow resulting from the fitting of any particular intake pipe. Experimentally recorded indicator diagrams compare satisfactorily with those predicted theoretically and similar agreement is obtained between the experimental and theoretical values of airflow. An 18 per cent increase in airflow is reported...|$|E
40|$|Unlike exhaust noise, {{the intake}} system noise off an {{automobile}} cannot be measured {{because of the}} proximity of the engine at the point-of measurement. Besides, the intake side is associated with turbocharger (booster),intercooler, cooling fan, etc., which will make the measurement of the intake noise erroneous. Therefore, in the present investigation, the source characteristics of the intake system have been expressed as functions of the engine's physical, operating and thermodynamic parameters. The pressure time history is first computed by means of the commercial software AVL-BOOST for different acoustic loads (<b>induction</b> <b>pipe</b> lengths), which are then used to determine source characteristics, Le.,p(s) and Z(S) (analogous to the open-circuit voltage and internal impedance of an electrical source), using an appropriate multi-load method. This investigation has been conducted for both naturally aspirated and turbocharged diesel engine. Using this methodology and the resultant empirical relations, one can analyze any compression-ignition (CI) engine configuration for the prediction of the un-muffled noise without having to carry out the rather cumbersome and time-consuming time-domain simulation of the intake side. The aim of the present study is to parameterize the source characteristics of an engine in terms of basic engine parameters, so that a first assessment of the un-muffled intake noise can be made by means of the frequency-domain transfer matrix method before a detailed design is taken up...|$|E
