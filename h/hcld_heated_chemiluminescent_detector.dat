A <b>chemiluminescent</b> <b>detector</b> based on the luminescent reaction of nitric acid with excess ozone was used in nitric acid measurements.

40|$|Chemiluminescent {{reactions}} can be {{used for}} specific and highly sensitive detection of a number of air pollutants. Among these are chemiluminescent reactions of ozone with NO or organics and reactions of luminol with a variety of oxidants. Reported here are studies exploring (1) the use of the temperature dependence of the chemiluminescent reactions of ozone with organic pollutants as a means of differentiating types of hydrocarbon classes and (2) the use of luminol techniques to monitor atmospheric concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO{sub 2 }) and organic oxidants, specifically peroxyacyl nitrates (PANs).

40|$|The chemiluminescent rocket {{ozonesonde}} utilizing rhodamine-B as a detector and self-pumping for {{air sampling}} has been improved. The instrument employs standard meteorological sounding systems {{and is the}} only technique available for routine nighttime ozone measurements above balloon altitudes. The <b>chemiluminescent</b> <b>detector,</b> when properly calibrated, is shown to be specific to ozone, stable, and of sufficient sensitivity for accurate measurements of ozone from about 65 - 20 km. An error analysis indicates that the measured ozone profiles have an absolute accuracy of about + or - 12 % and a precision of about + or - 6 %. Approximately 20 flights have been conducted for geophysical investigations, while additional flights were conducted with other rocket and satellite ozone soundings for comparisons. In general, these comparisons showed good agreement...|$|R
40|$|This work {{describes}} the calibration {{of a gas}} chromatograph equipped with a sulfur <b>chemiluminescent</b> <b>detector</b> with dual plasma (GC-SCD-DP) for analysis of sulfur-containing petroleum refinery gaseous streams. A packed column in an inert tube (Sulfinert) and an inlet system resistant to reactive sulfur compounds were used. The behavior of the calibration procedure over time depended on the sulfur compound: hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S), carbonyl sulfide (COS), methanethiol (MeSH) and dimethylsulfide (DMS) gave constant responses, whereas SO 2 presented a systematic increase and dimethyldisulfide (DMDS) showed a systematic decrease of their response factors. In all cases, the response factors were lower than the ones found in the ASTM D 5504 - 08 method. The GC-SCD-DP technique {{proved to be a}} suitable tool for quantification of sulfur compounds (including SO 2) at Âµg. m- 3 levels in several petroleum refinery gaseous streams...|$|R
40|$|Satellite {{instruments}} {{such as the}} {{backscattered ultraviolet}} (BUV) apparatus, have been in operation {{for a number of}} years. One current difficulty is the validation of the ozone inferences obtained from the BUV measurements using independent instruments. For higher altitudes rocket instruments are necessary. Two instruments currently under development include a <b>chemiluminescent</b> <b>detector</b> described by Hilsenrath et al. (1969) and a filter photometer rocket ozonesonde (Rocoz) developed by Krueger and McBridge (1968). The present investigation is concerned with an analysis of the Rocoz system, the information content of the measurements, and the utility of the system for intercomparison with the BUV system. It is found that the sampling characteristics of the Rocoz and BUV systems exhibit some fundamental differences. However, their results can be related through knowledge of the relation between pressure and altitude. This is best obtained through the solution of the hypsometric equation using rocket temperature measurements...|$|R
40|$|Results are {{presented}} from NO measurements obtained with a <b>chemiluminescent</b> NO <b>detector</b> and an in situ ozone instrument aboard high altitude balloons launched at Air sur L'Adour and Gap, France. NO profiles were obtained between 35 and 40 km {{in the late}} morning of September 17, 1987 and the early afternoon of June 18, 1988. The average NO concentration was 9 ppbv at 35 km, increasing with altitude to 11. 5 ppbv at 40 km. The difference in the temperature profile significantly contributes to the observed change in the NO concentration...|$|R
40|$|The {{activity}} {{carried out}} during my PhD was principally {{addressed to the}} development of portable microfluidic analytical devices based on biospecific molecular recognition reactions and CL detection. In particular, the development of biosensors required the study of different materials and procedures for their construction, with particular attention {{to the development of}} suitable immobilization procedures, fluidic systems and the selection of the suitable detectors. Different methods were exploited, such as gene probe hybridization assay or immunoassay, based on different platform (functionalized glass slide or nitrocellulose membrane) trying to improve the simplicity of the assay procedure. Different CL detectors were also employed and compared with each other in the search for the best compromise between portability and sensitivity. The work was therefore aimed at miniaturization and simplification of analytical devices and the study involved all aspects of the system, from the analytical methodology to the type of detector, in order to combine high sensitivity with easiness-of-use and rapidity. The latest development involving the use of smartphone as <b>chemiluminescent</b> <b>detector</b> paves the way {{for a new generation of}} analytical devices in the clinical diagnostic field thanks to the ideal combination of sensibility a simplicity of the CL with the day-by-day increase in the performance of the new generation smartphone camera. Moreover, the connectivity and data processing offered by smartphones can be exploited to perform analysis directly at home with simple procedures. The system could eventually be used to monitor patient health and directly notify the physician of the analysis results allowing a decrease in costs and an increase in the healthcare availability and accessibility...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{describes}} a rocket-borne <b>chemiluminescent</b> NO <b>detector</b> and gives some NO mixing ratios in the altitude range from 42 to 60 km calculated {{on the basis}} of data obtained from this instrument. The mixing ratios were calculated from the observed counting rates on the assumption of a standard atmospheric pressure profile and the known vehicle velocity profile. The NO mixing ratio decreased from 4. 2 billionths at 42 km to 2. 2 billionths at 50 km, and then increased to 5. 2 billionths at 60 km. The results are deemed accurate to within 20 % and may be viewed as upper bounds on nitric oxide concentration {{in the absence of any}} NO loss processes...|$|R

40|$|Local and {{systemic}} inflammation {{can lead to}} progression of burn wounds, converting second- to third-degree wounds or extending the burn to adjacent areas. Previous {{studies have suggested that}} the skin is an important site of production of nitric oxide (NO), synthesized by inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) activation after injury. NO increases in burned wounds, but its formation in noninjured skin has not been investigated. We hypothesized that after severe burns, NO and cytotoxic peroxynitrite would increase in noninjured skin. We also tested the hypothesis that BBS- 2, a specific inhibitor of iNOS, would impair NO formation after burn. Thirteen female sheep were randomized into burn injury and smoke inhalation (n = 5, group 1), burn and smoke treated with BBS- 2 (n = 3, group 2), and sham (saline treatment, no injury) (n = 5, group 3). All the animals, including the sham-injury group, were mechanically ventilated for 48 h. Samples of nonburned skin and plasma were collected from each animal, and levels of NO and its metabolites were evaluated using a NO <b>chemiluminescent</b> <b>detector.</b> Nitrotyrosine and iNOS expression were determined in the skin by Immunoperoxidase staining, and scoring of masked slides (epidermis, hair follicles, vessels, glands, and stroma) was performed. Skin NO and metabolites significantly increased in the burn and smoke injury group, and this was inhibited by BBS- 2. Nitrotyrosine expression also increased significantly in the skin of burned animals. BBS- 2 prevented the increase of NOx but not the increase of nitrotyrosine expression in skin. Plasma levels of NO increased in burned animals when compared with sham, but this increase was not significant. The increase of NO and its metabolites after burn in noninjured skin is followed by a significant increase in peroxynitrite, a potent cytotoxic mediator...|$|R
40|$|A new {{solid phase}} {{extraction}} procedure extracts N- Nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) at part-per-trillion (ng/L) concentrations from aqueous samples using a C{sub 18 } (reversed-phase) membrane extraction disk layered over a carbon-based extraction disk. The reversed-phase disk removes nonpolar water-insoluble neutrals and is set aside; the carbon-based disk is extracted {{with a small}} volume of dichloromethane. NDMA is quantitated in the organic extract using a gas chromatograph equipped with both a short-path thermal desorber and a <b>chemiluminescent</b> nitrogen <b>detector</b> (CLND). The Method Detection Limit for the procedure is 2 ng of NDMA/L; the analyte recovery is approximately 57 %. A related procedure substitutes a standard automatic sampler for the short-path thermal desorber, and is suitable for determining NDMA in heavily-contaminated aqueous samples. The Method Detection Limit for the `high-level` procedure, which employs an automatic sampler, is 180 ng of NDMA/L, with an analyte recovery of approximately 64 %...|$|R
40|$|A {{high-temperature}} {{catalytic oxidation}} method for determination of total dissolved N {{has been developed}} and tested on soil solution and throughfall. Unlike methods generally used for total dissolved N, this method is rapid, quantitative, and does not require use of strong acids or bases. The technique couples a commercially available <b>chemiluminescent</b> N <b>detector</b> with the combustion furnace of a commercially available C analyzer. An aqueous sample is combusted in an ultra pure oxygen environment at 680 Â°C, converting all forms of N to nitric oxide, which then reacts with ozone. The product, metastable NO 2, is measured chemiluminescently by the N detector. The method is appropriate for samples collected in studies of forest soil solution and throughfall, having a method detection limit of 0. 03 mg Lâ 1 total N, and a range from 0. 03 to 10. 0 mg Lâ 1.

40|$|N-nitrosodimethylamine is a high, {{carcinogenic}} manufacturing {{by-product of}} unsymmetrical dimethyl hydrazine {{a component of}} rocket fuel. Prior disposal practices resulted in the contamination of groundwater near certain military installations with both species. The current regulatory threshold promulgated by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for NDMA in surface waters designated for drinking is 0. 7 ng NDMA/L (0. 7 pptr) L. Existing procedures for determining NDMA in aqueous samples typically employ dichloromethane extraction followed by concentration to a final volume of 1 mL, and gas chromatographic analysis of a 2 {mu}L aliquot of concentrate using either a nitrogen-phosphorus detector (NPD), mass spectrometric <b>detector,</b> or <b>chemiluminescent</b> nitrogen <b>detector</b> (CLND). Such a protocol does not permit detection of NDMA at the desired health-based criterion unless high-resolution mass spectrometric (HRMS) detectors are employed.

40|$|Recently a new {{detection}} method, {{based upon}} aerosol charging (the charged aerosol detector (CAD)) {{has been introduced}} {{as an alternative to}} evaporative light-scattering <b>detector</b> (ELSD), <b>chemiluminescent</b> nitrogen <b>detector</b> and refractive index detector for detection of non-ultraviolet and weakly ultraviolet active compounds and for UV-absorbing compounds in the absence of standards. The content of this review article includes description of operation principle, advantages and disadvantages of CAD system, and short reports of selected applications of this detector. The main advantages of CAD detector are unique performance characteristics: better sensitivity than ELSD system, a dynamic range of up to 4 orders of magnitude, ease of use and constancy of response factors. Both detectors are mass dependent and the response generated does not depend on the spectral or physicochemical properties of the analyte. This attractive feature of a detection technique generating universal response factors is the potential use of a single, universal standard for calibration against which all other compounds or impurities can be qualified. CAD also has the same limitation as ELSD, namely,the response is affected by mobile-phase composition. This problem has been resolved by using inverse gradient compensation as is done for high pressure liquid chromatography and supercritical fluid chromatography. CAD has been applied for the analysis of structurally diverse compounds used in the pharmaceutical, chemical, food, and consumer products industries and in life science research. They include nonvolatile and semivolatile neutral, acidic, basic, and zwitterionic compounds, both polar and nonpolar (e. g. lipids, proteins, steroids, polymers, carbohydrates, peptides) ...|$|R
40|$|One problem {{encountered}} {{in the use of}} air-quality instrumentation on aircraft is the variation of instrument sensitivity with pressure as the result of altitude changes of the aircraft. Many instruments experience sensitivity changes of as much as a factor of 2 at altitudes of 6 km. Discussed are recent modifications to a <b>chemiluminescent</b> (ethylene) ozone <b>detector</b> that allow the instrument to automatically compensate for pressure/sensitivity effects. The modification provides automated mass flow rate control for both the sample and ethylene gas flows. The flow control systems maintain flow rate to within 15 percent for a 100 -torr instantaneous pressure change, and flow rates are returned to the desired set points within 10 s after the pressure change. During simulated altitude changes (300 m/min from mean sea level to 3 -km altitude), flow rates were controlled to within 3 percent of the set point. Laboratory data are summarized verifying the operation of the instrument for a pressure range of 760 torr (sea level) to 350 torr (approximately 20, 000 ft) and an ozone concentration range from 20 to approximately 700 ppb...|$|R
