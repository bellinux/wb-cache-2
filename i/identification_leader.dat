40|$|Employees’ identifications are a {{valuable}} asset for modern organizations, and identification research has stressed {{the necessity to}} distinguish identifications according to their focus (i. e. organizational, team, or <b>leader</b> <b>identification).</b> Interestingly, transformational leadership (TFL) has been proposed to unfold its effects by transforming followers’ identifications and could thus be a powerful way to actively manage identification. However, it remains unclear whether TFL affects identifications with different foci similarly or whether it predominantly influences a specific focus. To resolve this puzzle, the authors conducted a meta-analysis (k = 73; N = 20, 543) and found that TFL (and each TFL sub-dimension) is more strongly associated with <b>leader</b> <b>identification</b> than with organizational identification or team identification. By presenting a comprehensive model of TFL's effects on identifications, we show that <b>leader</b> <b>identification</b> mediates the relationships between TFL and collective identifications (i. e. organizational identification or team identification), illustrating that relational identification {{plays a crucial role}} in subsequently shaping collective identifications.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to explore two of the {{mechanisms}} by which transformational leaders have a positive influence on followers. It examined the mediating role of follower’s <b>leader</b> and group <b>identification</b> on the associations among different transformational leader behaviours and follower job satisfaction and supervisor-rated job performance. One hundred and seventy-nine healthcare employees and 44 supervisors participated in the study. The results from multilevel structural equation modelling provided results that partially supported the predicted model. <b>Identification</b> with the <b>leader</b> significantly mediated the positive associations between supportive leadership, intellectual stimulation, personal recognition, in the prediction of job satisfaction and job performance. <b>Leader</b> <b>identification</b> also mediated the relationship between supportive leadership, intellectual stimulation, personal recognition, and group identification. However, group identification did not mediate the associations between vision leadership and inspirational communication, in the prediction of job satisfaction and job performance.

40|$|Previous {{research}} has focused on the importance of leaders being seen to be of the group (i. e. to be prototypical of a group) but less on the impact of leaders 2 ̆ 7 own degree of identification with the group. Also, {{little is known about the}} combined impact of leader prototypicality and <b>leader</b> <b>identification</b> on followers 2 ̆ 7 responses.

In addition, results demonstrate that the aforementioned responses are more pronounced for highly identified followers.

40|$|We {{examined}} follower relational <b>identification</b> {{with the}} <b>leader</b> {{as a mediator}} and follower perceptions of leader creativity expectations as a moderator {{in the relationship between}} transformational leadership and follower creativity. Using a sample of 420 leader-follower dyads from an energy company in mainland China, we found that follower relational <b>identification</b> with the <b>leader</b> mediates the transformational leadership-follower creativity relationship, and this mediating relationship is conditional on the moderator variable of follower perceptions of leader creativity expectations for the path from follower relational identification to follower creativity. These results contribute to the literature by clarifying why (through relational identification) and when (high creativity expectations set by the leader) transformational leadership is positively related to follower creativity.

40|$|Despite {{the growing}} {{frequency}} of leadership transitions and their {{significant impact on}} team and organizational performance, little research has examined why and how teams develop an identification with a new leader or their subsequent receptiveness to the new leader’s change initiatives. Drawing from the contrast and congruence effects and the theoretical perspectives of <b>leader</b> <b>identification,</b> this study empirically tests a model in which the congruence of new leaders’ and their teams’ proactive personalities foster new <b>leader</b> <b>identification,</b> {{as well as the}} team’s behavioral responses to the new leader’s change agenda. This effect is strongest when the new leader’s proactive personality is higher than that of the former leader’s proactive personality (positive contrast). Our findings of a four-wave “before-and-after” transition survey of 155 hotel employees and 51 new leaders, achieved through polynomial regression analyses, proved very insightful. Essentially, we found that the congruence between a new leader’s and his/her team’s proactive personalities and the positive contrast between a former leader’s and the new leader’s proactive personalities enhanced new <b>leader</b> <b>identification</b> and the team’s shared identification with the new leader’s change agenda, and, thereby led the team to exhibit more behavioral engagement with, and voice behavior about, the new leader’s change agenda...|$|R
40|$|We theorized and {{examined}} a Pygmalion perspective beyond those proposed in past {{studies in the}} relationship between transformational leadership and employee voice behavior. Specifically, we proposed that transformational leadership influences employee voice through leaders’ voice expectation and employees’ voice role perception (i. e., Pygmalion mechanism). We also theorized that personal <b>identification</b> with transformational <b>leaders</b> influences the extent to which employees internalize leaders’ external voice expectation as their own voice role perception. In a time-lagged field study, we found that leaders’ voice expectation and employees’ voice role perception (i. e., the Pygmalion process) mediate the relationship between transformational leadership and voice behavior. In addition, we found transformational leadership strengthens employees’ personal <b>identification</b> with the <b>leader,</b> which in turn, as a moderator, amplifies the proposed Pygmalion process.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{experimental}} {{study was to examine}} the role of a Transformational, Transactional, and Laissez-faire leader in the perceived likelihood of employees exhibiting Organizational Citizenship Behaviors (OCBs) at work. The extent to which employees identify with their leaders was also examined as a mediator on the relationship between leadership style and OCB performance. OCBs are behaviors that are not directly required of an employee, but that benefit the overall organization by promoting excellence while allowing employees to go beyond the job requirements. Previous research suggests that Transformational Leaders inspire and instill values in employees through empowerment and positive relationships (Bass, 2007; Bass 2 ̆ 6 Riggio, 2006; Carter, Mossholder, Feild, 2 ̆ 6 Armenakis, 2014; Eagly, Johannesen-Schmidt, 2 ̆ 6 van Engen, 2003), and that employees that perform OCBs greatly benefit organizations (Akinbode, 2011; Finkelstein 2 ̆ 6 Penner, 2004; Organ 2 ̆ 6 Ryan, 1995; N. P. Podsakoff, Whiting, Podsakoff, 2 ̆ 6 Blume, 2009; Shaffer, Li, 2 ̆ 6 Bagger, 2015). One of three vignettes describing one of the three leadership styles (e. g., Transformational, Transactional, Laissez-faire) was shown to 200 employed participants working at least part time (i. e., 20 hours per week) under a supervisor via an online survey using MTurk. After rating their respective leader (as described in the vignette) on the Global Transformational Leadership (GTL) scale, participants completed an <b>identification</b> with <b>leader</b> inventory and an OCB-checklist, indicating likelihood of OCB performance under their particular leader. Multivariate analysis of variance was utilized to examine the effect of leadership style on OCB performance. Further, correlational analyses were used to examine the relationship between GTL scores and OCB-Checklist scores. Finally, a mediation analysis with <b>identification</b> with the <b>leader</b> mediating the relationship between leadership style and OCB performance was conducted. Results showed individuals in the Transformational Leader Condition reported the highest likelihood of performing OCBs, followed by Transactional Leader and finally Laissez-faire <b>Leader.</b> <b>Identification</b> with the <b>leader</b> significantly mediated the relationship between Transformational leadership and OCB performance. Finally, individuals that perceived their leader as more Transformational were also more likely to report performing OCBs. Implications of these findings for OCBs in the workplace are discussed...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this phenomenological {{qualitative}} {{study was to examine}} leader development within the college Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) in order to understand from the participating cadets’ perspectives, the leader development experience. The study focused on the following central research question: How do participants view and interpret their collegiate Army ROTC leadership development experience? Guiding theories for this study were Vygotsky’s sociocultural theory (1978), Bandura’s social learning theory (1977) and Tajfel’s identity theory (1982). The study involved twelve college seniors involved at three distinct universities; the data related to their experience as leaders and was collected through reflective journals, interviews, and observations. Data collected was sorted into themes that illuminated the importance of leadership experience, character, and mentorship in the leader development process. Insights from the ROTC student participant perceptions provided evidence of the uniqueness of leader identity and the importance of gaining a leader psyche as components to an effective leader development program. This study helps to inform education administrators, faculty, and fellow students about the importance of leadership experience, character, and personal <b>leader</b> <b>identification</b> throughout the <b>leader</b> development process.

40|$|Although working {{long hours}} {{is a common}} practice, {{scholars}} still know little about what really causes employees to work long hours. Drawing on social information processing and social learning theory, this study examines the role of social contextual antecedents (i. e. supervisor working hours and the perceived overtime climate of one’s workgroup) in influencing employee working hours, after controlling for individual background and job characteristics. Further, we examine whether such relationships are contingent on employees’ individual differences in their <b>identification</b> with <b>leader</b> and a collectivist tendency. A field study of 200 supervisor-subordinate dyads in South Korea revealed a strong positive relationship between the contextual antecedents and employees’ working hours, {{as well as the}} moderating effects of the two individual difference variables. Specifically, we found that the relationship between supervisor working hours and employee working hours was more positive for low identifiers than for high identifiers, while the relationship between the perceived overtime climate and employee working hours was more positive for those low in collectivism than for those high in collectivism. Finally, we found that working long hours was associated with lower job satisfaction, higher psychological distress, lower in-role performance, but not with organizational citizenship behavior. ope...|$|R

40|$|M. Ed. The aim of {{this study}} was to develop {{guidelines}} for principals and teachers when they identify leaders in secondary schools. That enables pupils with potential to function successfully as leaders in a school environment. Leadership in the secondary school has for too long been misinterpreted, misunderstood and grossly underscored in far too many ways. There is mistrust towards the identifying process. Present day demands require a specific form of education and training in leadership at school level to enable our youth to cope with these requirements. Educational authorities - especially school authorities are therefore compelled to address the matter of training and identification in a new light. Most of the existing research about <b>identification</b> of school <b>leaders</b> at secondary school level is of a quantitative nature and consisted of the completion of questionnaires. This brought about the testing and retesting of stereotyped proposals. In this study a qualitative research program was followed. By means of focus group interviews the views of a principal, teachers and secondary school pupils where collected. The research question in this study developed was the following: In what way does the personality of the pupil influences the teachers' choice of leaders at school level? The aim that followed was: To find out if there are personality traits that is necessary for a school leader at secondary school level to be successful. An explanatory, descriptive research design was used as part of qualitative research method during phase 1 of the research. The aim of phase 2 was to compare the results of the focus group interviews with a literature review. During phase 3 guidelines were developed for the <b>identification</b> of <b>leaders</b> in secondary schools. The conclusions of the research showed that the focus groups reflected reality, namely that the teachers lacked knowledge about leadership and that the pupils meaning reflects the findings of the literature study. Further it became apparent that although personality is relevant in leadership identification, it shouldn't be the main focus. Pupils should be helped to develop leadership skills which could be learned and to develop their personality or capabilities and in order to enable them to develop their full potential and to apply the leadership skills in their lives...|$|R

40|$|Purpose The {{purpose of}} this study is to shed light on donors’ {{decision}} process in their choice of aid recipients, which is still only partly understood. In particular, it is still unclear whether any imitative behaviour within donors’ decision process actually affects the degree of selectivity in their choice of recipients. This study contributes to fill such a gap by assessing whether the selectivity of donors’ aid allocation reflects an imitative behaviour and, if so, who leads the game and how the game has changed over time. Design/methodology/approach Donors’ selectivity is estimated using the Suits index for the analysis of aid allocations. The evolution of the Suits index is analysed in an autoregressive manner to test whether donors’ selectivity reflects an imitative behaviour. Findings This study documents a general increase in aid selectivity with regards to poverty, while selectivity according to governance reveals only limited change. The analysis shows how a redistributive process of donor leadership and influential power over aid allocation has been in place over three decades between 1980 and 2010, with the 1990 s signing the main phase of transition.

40|$|Based on {{research}} showing that feelings of self-uncertainty increase group identification, we explored the idea that leader-induced uncertainty might under some conditions also strengthen identification. Given that most leadership situations involve leading diverse subgroups, the effectiveness of leader-induced uncertainty to increase identification would likely {{be influenced by the}} extent to which members viewed the superordinate group as reflecting their own subgroup 2 ̆ 7 s attributes, as well as {{the extent to which the}} superordinate group leader was considered prototypical of their subgroup. Students (N = 125) indicated their party affiliation (Democrat vs. Republican) and political ideology (liberal vs. conservative), and read a speech by the current US President, George W. Bush, in which they were instructed to focus on aspects of the speech that made them feel uncertain or feel certain. Dependent measures were strength of national (American) identification and strength of identification with their political party (Democratic or Republican). As predicted, we found that uncertainty strengthened party identification among all participants, and weakened national identification among Democrats. Uncertainty did not affect national identification among Republicans, quite probably because as a group they already identified very strongly with nation.
