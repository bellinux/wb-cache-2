40|$|Several {{aspects of}} {{microwave}} <b>veneer</b> <b>drying</b> are described. The {{final moisture content}} profiles and quality of two <b>dried</b> <b>veneer</b> thicknesses A and B (3 and 1. 5 mm in thickness respectively) are determined. Veneer gluability of the two <b>veneer</b> thicknesses, <b>dried</b> by two different methods, are examined. The dimensional stability of veneer and plywood samples made from these <b>dried</b> <b>veneers</b> are also examined. Green {{weight per unit area}} was used as an indicator of moisture content during drying. A wide variation in final moisture content of <b>dried</b> <b>veneer</b> was found to be due to the presence of earlywood and latewood in veneer sample A and juvenile wood in veneer sample B. Green veneer sorting, based on water content per area or volume, green weight per area and percent saturation, can be used to improve drying performance. Statistical analysis indicates that the final veneer moisture content profiles estimated from green weight per unit area for two <b>dried</b> <b>veneer</b> thicknesses A and B dried by microwave, are not significantly different from those under conventional drying. However, the result indicates that microwave drying resulted in a higher degree of moisture content uniformity for both veneer thicknesses, whereas excessive drying occurred on the outer sections for both veneer thicknesses under conventional drying. A dark color was found in the <b>dried</b> <b>veneer</b> of both thicknesses under microwave drying compared to those of conventionally <b>dried</b> <b>veneers.</b> Statistically, both <b>drying</b> methods resulted in similar veneer quality, except microwave drying resulted in better veneer quality with respect to flatness, and has a low flatness ratio. Microwave <b>dried</b> <b>veneer</b> also had low percent shrinkage for both veneer thicknesses compared to conventionally <b>dried</b> <b>veneer</b> samples. Veneer gluability for veneer A is better than for veneer B, higher in the percentage of wood failures and greater glueline shear strength. Microwave drying resulted in better veneer gluability. Although microwave-dried plywood samples had a higher percentage of water absorption for both veneer thicknesses compared to conventional samples, they had lower percentage thickness swelling. In addition, the percent failure did not represent the glue bond quality of plywood samples. Restricted Access: University of Melbourne Staff and Students Onl...|$|R

For the 600 °F and higher operating temperatures, steam was found to be more effective than air. Under all drying conditions, Southern pine dried faster than Douglas fir. Effective heat transfer coefficients representing the convective effects of both heat and mass transfer associated with <b>drying</b> <b>veneer</b> were computed in two ways: based on the experimental data, and based on theoretical considerations.

40|$|Abstract — <b>Veneer</b> <b>drying</b> is an {{important}} process in manufacturing of plywood and laminated veneer lumber. In order to understand and to improve the <b>veneer</b> <b>drying,</b> a mathematical model was developed based on heat and moisture mass transfer processes within the wood in the air stream. The model was validated from commercial scale drying tests. Air temperature, humidity and exit air velocity all affect the veneering drying to a different extent. This paper describes the <b>drying</b> time of <b>veneer</b> for 0. 5 mm to 2. 0 mm thickness. The variables considered for two wood groups were temperature, thickness and moisture content. An empirical equation was derived from a simple physical model and used to correlate this data. The raw material used mainly are kanyin (Botanical Name: Dipterocarpus spp) and Inn. Drying {{is a process of}} reducing the water content of timber economically and with the minimal damage to the stock. The empirical equation depends on the measurement of the moisture content and indirectly the water potential, the temperature at the surface of a wood specimen and different thickness which were used for the determination of drying time. Key words: <b>veneer</b> <b>drying,</b> drying rates, thickness of veneer, moisture content, empirical equation I...|$|R
40|$|Moisture content (MC) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} factors that can affect many physical and mechanical properties of wood and veneers. MC strongly affects the final strength and durability of joints, development of surface checks in the wood and dimensional stability of the bonded assembly. In this study, plywood panels made from Alnus glutinosa (alder), Fagus orientalis (beech) and Picea orientalis (spruce) wood veneers were treated with ammonium acetate, borax and boric acid by using dipping method to test for their equilibrium moisture content (EMC). Borax and boric acid solutions were used for fire-retardancy, and ammonium acetate for reducing formaldehyde emission. Two different <b>veneer</b> <b>drying</b> temperatures (20 ºC and 180 ºC) were used to reveal the effects of <b>veneer</b> <b>drying</b> at high temperature on the hygroscopicity of plywood panels. EMC values of alder, beech and spruce panels decreased significantly with <b>veneer</b> <b>drying</b> at high temperature. Picea orientalis (spruce) plywood panels had the highest EMC values and followed by Alnus glutinosa (alder) and Fagus orientalis (beech) panels. EMC values of plywood panels increased significantly for both drying temperatures after ammonium acetate, borax and boric acid treatments...|$|R
25|$|The total (harmful) air {{emissions}} produced by wood kilns, including their heat source, can be significant. Typically, {{the higher the}} temperature the kiln operates at, the larger amount of emissions are produced (per pound of water removed). This {{is especially true in}} the <b>drying</b> of thin <b>veneers</b> and high-temperature <b>drying</b> of softwoods.|$|R
40|$|<b>Veneer</b> <b>drying</b> {{process is}} an {{important}} stage {{in the production of}} wood based composites such as plywood and LVL panels. Because <b>veneer</b> <b>drying</b> becomes a bottleneck in the production process due to the inefficient equipment and methods. Although drying temperatures between 90 - 160 °C may be considered normal, increased temperatures are being used to reduce the overall drying time and increase capacity. However, the reduction in drying time often results in an increase in drying related defects such as checks, splits and warp and decrease in wettability. Surface inactivation is one of these defects which occur on wood surfaces with heat effect and results in the loss of bonding ability. Surface inactivation is defined as physical and chemical modifications on the wood surfaces that results in reduced ability of the adhesive to properly wet, flow, penetrate and cure. Many investigations have been conducted to improve adhesion of inactivated wood surfaces, but no comprehensive solution has been revealed so far...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1993 The drying of wood is {{required}} in most forest products manufacturing operations. Depending on the wood species, dimensions, drying temperatures, and drying duration, the amount of emissions and energy consumption can greatly affect the operating cost, environment, and quality of wood dried. As such, the forest products industry continues to explore the use of new technologies to address these points of concern. A study was done to evaluate {{the addition of a}} radio-frequency (RF) heating system to a natural gas-fired conventional veneer dryer as a means to reduce emissions, reduce energy consumption, and improve productivity while maintaining material quality. To establish the benefits of RF-assisted drying, a study comparison was made for <b>drying</b> wood <b>veneer</b> in a RF-assisted dryer and a conventional dryer. The study was conducted at Western Veneer and Slicing in White City, Oregon. This plant was selected because both types of dryers, an RF-assisted dryer manufactured by Production Machinery, Inc. and a conventional dryer manufactured by Amitec, were located at the same site and were used for drying the same type of material. Two comparison drying tests were conducted, one using sliced ponderosa pine and the other using rotary peeled Douglas-fir. The sliced veneer was selected because it was the type of material used by the White City plant and the rotary veneer was used because it is of the type used in the plywood industry. The parameters measured for each drying run were material flows, drying rates, emission rates, dryer operating conditions, exhaust conditions, and electrical and natural gas consumption. It was found that although the RF-assisted dryer was able to successfully <b>dry</b> the sliced <b>veneer</b> as it was designed to do, it was not properly "tuned" to efficiently <b>dry</b> the rotary <b>veneer.</b> Therefore, {{the results of this study}} should only be made for the sliced veneer studies.

40|$|Graduation date: 1981 This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to determine whether}} Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) veneer could be platen-dried and then sucessfully glued into two-ply parallel-laminated panels. A range of veneer thicknesses, platen temperatures and final dry moisture contents were examined. Thicknesses included were nominal 0. 1, 0. 2, 0. 3 and 0. 4 inches; platen temperatures were 325, 375, 425 and 460 °F. Drying of both sapwood and heartwood was carried out to final moisture contents of either one, five or nine percent. Gluebond quality was evaluated using shear strength and percentage wood failure as criteria. Three aging methods were employed: none, vacuum-pressure soaking and cyclic boiling. The effective limit on subsequent gluability of platen-dried veneers {{was found to be}} a function of both platen temperature and <b>drying</b> time. Thin <b>veneers</b> (0. 1 and 0. 2 inch) typical of commercial plywood operations were most gluable after drying at the lowest platen temperature examined, 325 °F. However, 0. 4 inch thick <b>veneers</b> were best <b>dried</b> at a high platen temperature, 460 °F, and had laminate shear strengths equivalent to thin veneer panels. Shear strength after vacuum-pressure aging appeared to be the best method of performance evaluation of parallel-laminated platen-dried veneers. Percentage wood failure was uniformly high for all veneer thicknesses and platen temperatures. Shear strength was only moderately predictable empirically; platen temperature and temperature x drying time were the most important influences on subsequent mechanical capacity. Drying times to five percent moisture content varied from less than one minute for 0. 1 inch veneer at 460 °F to approximately 20 minutes for 0. 4 inch sapwood <b>veneer</b> <b>dried</b> at 325 °F. Volumetric shrinkage after platen-drying at all temperatures at 35 psi and air drying at 425 °F were approximately equal.

40|$|Wettability of {{the fire}} {{retardant}} treated (FRT) laminated veneer lumber (LVL) manufactured from wood <b>veneers</b> <b>dried</b> at different temperatures was investigated. Commercially manufactured veneer of beech wood (Fagus orientalis L.) was treated with borax-boric acid (BX/BA, 1 : 1 by weight), monoammonium phosphate (MAP), and diammonium phosphate (DAP) using a full-cell pressure process. The <b>veneers</b> were then <b>dried</b> at different temperatures (120, 140, 160, and 180 °C), and experimental LVLs were made from these veneer sheets. The wettability of LVL was characterized by contact angle analysis. The lowest contact angle was obtained from LVL made from BX/BA-treated veneers, while the highest value was found for the control LVL. The CA values of these samples at each re-drying level were lower than LVLs made from untreated veneers.

40|$|At {{the present}} time, plywood has lost market share to {{competitors}} such as waferboard and {{oriented strand board}} (OSB). Improvement in plywood production and plywood performance is required to make plywood competitive with other wood based panel products. The objectives of this study are: (1) to examine {{the possibility of using}} microwave for <b>drying</b> rotary cut <b>veneer,</b> (2) to investigate treatment methods for veneer both before and after fabrication of panels using diphenyl-methane diisocyanate (MDI), (3) to test the characteristics of veneer and panels visually and mechanically. The experimental (preliminary and main research topics) approach to addressing this question involves investigating the characteristics of high performance panel products. All experimental designs used in this study are factorial ANOVA models for different factorial levels. A one factorial design was used to analyse the effect of moisture content (0 % and 10 %) on the % solid MDI uptake of veneer samples, and the effect of % MDI concentrations (100 %, 80 %, 60 %, 40 %, and 20 %) on the % solid MDI uptake of small cube wood samples. A two factorial design was used to investigate uptake of MDI in veneer and plywood treatments. The variables tested included three concentrations of MDI (50 %, 60 % and 70 %) and three levels of soaking times (5. 10, and 15 minutes). Another two factorial design was used to analyse the effects of five levels of % MDI concentrations (100 %, 80 %, 60 %, 40 %, and 20 %) and three levels of temperature setting (60, 100, and 140 C) on the curing time of MDI solution for small cube wood samples. Analysis of the effects of edge sealing (sealed and unsealed) and pressure type (low and high pressure) on the uptake MDI and Copper Naphthenate was analysed using a two factorial design. The study shows that microwave <b>drying</b> of <b>veneer</b> is technically feasible to cope with <b>veneer</b> <b>drying</b> problems, which at the present time poses a "bottleneck" and is the major consumer of thermal energy used in plywood production. Microwave drying is characterised by having low within charge variability in moisture content after drying; no drying defects and has no effect on the glueability of plywood. However, some importance aspects of the use of microwaves should be taken into account- in designing a commercial drying process. These include: the position, condition, type of wave guide covers and the power level of microwave. Microwave power had a significant effect on drying time. The higher the microwave power used the shorter the drying time. The highest uptake of solid MDI in plywood samples was obtained with 70 MDI following 10 minutes soaking (51 kg/m 3). This was followed by 60 MDI (45 kg/m 3) after 15 minutes soaking and 50 % MDI after 15 minutes soaking (41 kg/m 3) respectively. The highest solid MDI uptake in radiata pine veneer was obtained with 70 % MDI following 10 minutes soaking (115 kg/m 3). This was followed by 60 % MDI (94 kg/m 3) after 15 minutes soaking and 50 % MDI after 15 minutes soaking (71 kg/m 3) respectively. Investigation into the curing processes indicated that the best temperature for curing MDI solution was 60 C. Microwave energy could not be applied for curing MDI treated samples. Microwaving resulted in substantial losses of MDI solution from the wood blocks. Pressure impregnation of MDI, increased the uptake of resin compared to soaking techniques. The highest uptake of solid MDI for plywood samples was obtained with 70 % MDI in unsealed samples using high pressure treatment (359 kg/m 3). This was followed by the treatment of plywood which had been edge sealed and high pressure treated (208 kg/m 3), sealed and low pressure treatment (71 kg/m 3) and unsealed and low pressure treatment (51 kg/m 3), respectively. The highest uptake of Copper Naphthenate in plywood samples was obtained for edge-sealed and high pressure treatment (0. 92 % wt/wt Cu) followed by unsealed and high pressure treatment (0. 88 % wt/wt Cu), unsealed and low pressure treatment (0. 45 % wt/wt Cu) and unsealed and low pressure treatment (0. 51 % wt/wt Cu), respectively. MDI solution applied to plywood and veneers by immersion improved the surface qualities of these products. The surfaces were smoother, more rigid; there was water resistance compared to untreated samples. Water absorption was limited to 8 kg/m 3 after 5 minutes exposure compared to 84 kg/m 3 for untreated plywood. The average surface hardness of MDI treated veneers (82) was 4 points (in Shore C scale) higher than untreated veneers (78). The greatest hardness was obtained for samples treated with 50 % MDI solution (85), followed by 60 % (83) and 70 % (78) MDI solutions. The average surface hardness of MDI treated plywood using soaking treatment (85) was 6 points higher than untreated plywood (79). When MDI was applied by pressure impregnation surface hardness scores of 90 were obtained. The average shear strength of MDI treated veneer (0. 183 kN) is 35 % higher than untreated veneers (0. 135 kN). The highest values were obtained for samples treated with 50 % MDI solution (0. 202 kN), followed by 70 % (0. 178 kN) and 60 % (0. 169 kN) MDI solutions. The average shear strength of MDI treated plywood using soaking treatment was 0. 125 kN. This was 24 % higher than untreated plywood (0. 101 kN). This shear strength value is 19 % higher when compared to that for Cu Naphthenate treated plywood using pressure treatment (0. 105 kN). It can be concluded that MDI resin can be used to improved the water resistance, surface hardness and strength properties of veneer and plywood. Cu naphthenate (in kerosene) preservative can also be used for treating finished plywood without affecting the strength properties of treated plywood.

30|$|Three major {{research}} initiatives involving durable eucalypts in New Zealand have been initiated {{in the last}} two decades. The Forest Research Institute (Scion) and the New Zealand Forestry Association undertook a series of trials on eucalypts with stringy bark. However, these were either discontinued {{due to a lack of}} funding or have a narrow genetic base (van Ballekom and Millen 2017). The New Zealand Dryland Forests Initiative (NZDFI) has been working since 2008 to establish a eucalypt forest industry producing naturally durable timber based on a large scale-breeding programme of three species E. bosistoana F.Muell., E. quadrangulata H. Deane & Maiden and E. globoidea (Millen 2009). This breeding programme took a range of wood-quality traits into account (including low growth-stress). While primarily chosen for the natural durability of their heartwood, these species also produce wood of high stiffness - up to 20  GPa (Bootle 2005). Demand for engineered timber products with exceptional stiffness has been generated by the emergence of high-rise timber buildings (Van de Kuilen et al. 2011). These species also have naturally durable heartwood so it may be possible to produce preservative-free durable LVL (McKenzie 1993; Page and Singh 2014). Some information on the wood properties of E. bosistoana, E. quadrangulata and E. globoidea is available from old-growth resources in Australia (Bootle 2005), but only young plantation-grown E. globoidea has been studied previously in New Zealand. Eucalyptus globoidea has been reported to be well suited for plantation forestry with good tree health, growth and adaptability combined with favourable timber properties of good stiffness and natural durability (Barr 1996; Haslett 1990; Millner 2006). Additionally, it is easy to dry and has relatively low growth-stress levels (Jones et al. 2010; Poynton 1979). No information on peeling parameters, <b>veneer</b> <b>drying</b> or bonding has been reported for this species, however.|$|R
30|$|The dynamic {{viscoelastic}} {{behavior of}} wood {{is essential in}} the wood industry, particularly in the processing and manufacturing operations, such as the <b>drying,</b> wood forming, <b>veneer</b> cutting, and panel pressing. The viscoelasticity of wood {{is closely related to}} its anatomy structure and chemical components, as well as ambient temperature and relative humidity (RH). Investigations of influence of the temperature on the dynamic viscoelasticity of wood are helpful in providing insight into mechanical relaxation and thermal degradation of constituents of wood cell walls [1 – 5]. The viscoelastic properties of wood change also with varying ambient RH. In 1961, Armstrong and Kingston [6] reported the viscoelastic behavior of wood during cyclical RH changing process, and which was referred to as the mechano-sorptive effects [7]. Numerous investigators studied the mechano-sorptive effect experimentally and theoretically [8 – 14], and some explanations regarding physical mechanisms were proposed. The MC variation caused the breaking and reforming of hydrogen bonds [8], created free volume which provided a destabilized condition [15] and molecular mobility, and the internal stress gradients varied with the presence of moisture gradients [11]. The changing of temperature and RH disturbed the equilibrium packing of molecular, which offered a destabilized condition that slowly returned to the equilibrium condition [16 – 19]. This asymptotic return to equilibrium is known as physical aging [15]. One of the most means of detecting the changes associated with destabilization and aging was the dynamic mechanical test. Ebrahimzadeh and Kubát [20] and Ebrahimzadeh et al. [21] observed the increase in loss factor (tanδ) at {{the early stages of the}} adsorption or desorption process due to the transient moisture effect and close relationship between the rate of adsorption/desorption and the shape of the tanδ peak. Furthermore, the tanδ was higher in a given moisture content if wood was in adsorption state rather than in desorption.|$|R
40|$|Heat {{transfer}} during {{materials processing}} and manufacturing is enhanced through jet impingement for many different applications including, the tempering and shaping of glass, the annealing {{of metal and}} plastic sheets, and the <b>drying</b> of textiles, <b>veneer,</b> paper, and film materials. Literature studies have examined average convective coefficients for jet arrays, but {{the understanding of the}} observed trends in the average transport coefficients and local effects are limited. Therefore, the physical mechanisms of impinging gaseous jets that affect the heat transfer characteristics were investigated. A liquid crystal technique was developed to measure local and average convective coefficients for impinging air jets, and the effects of separation distance, jet-to-jet spacing in an array, Reynolds number, and spent air exits were examined. ^ Small separation distances, H/D < 1, were found to significantly enhance the local and average convective coefficients for both single and multiple jet systems. Besides the presence of local secondary maxima situated in rings around the stagnation point of an individual jet, the dominant physical mechanism which influences the heat transfer coefficient and separation distance relationship for jet arrays is adjacent jet interference before impingement. Thus interference before impingement is minimized by using small separation distances. ^ The array jet-to-jet spacing was found to significantly affect the uniformity and magnitude of the average convective coefficient by varying the percentage of impingement surface area covered by the stagnation and wall jet regions. The larger percent area covered by the stagnation region with high local convective coefficients (smaller jet-to-jet spacing) resulted in higher average and more uniform local values. However, on an equivalent mass flux basis the larger jet-to-jet spacing was most efficient in cooling the impingement surface. ^ For small separation distances the Reynolds number was found to have a strong influence on the convective coefficient by increasing the size and magnitude of the secondary maxima in the local coefficient distributions. Spent air exits resulted in reduced wall jet interactions between adjacent jets and a more uniform coverage of the impingement surface. The elimination of crossflow is the main benefit of spent air exits for all but small separation distances. ...|$|R

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Jet impingement {{has been shown to be}} an effective method for enhancing convective heat transfer. There are a variety of applications of impinging jets in industry, including tempering and shaping of glass, annealing of metal and plastic sheets, cooling of electronic components and <b>drying</b> of paper, <b>veneer,</b> etc. Another application is the use of impinging jets in internal cooling channels in modern gas turbine blades. High velocity jets provide an effective way to augment the rate of heat removal from the blades to the cooling air, maintaining the blade temperatures within tolerable and metallurgical limits. This experimental research examines, for turbulent parallel and counter flows of air through an annular channel with holes for jet impingement along the inner tube, the effects of varying the geometries of the channel and the hole array, and the air flow rate, on the heat transfer distribution on the inner surfaces of the outer tube. Air enters one end of the inner tube, whose other end is closed, passes through the holes on the inner tube and exits through one end of the annular passage between the inner and outer tubes. Each hole array has inline or staggered circular holes with a given diameter and has a fixed number of holes around the circumference of the inner tube at any cross section of the annular channel. Heat transfer experiments are performed for Reynolds numbers of 5, 000, 12, 250 and 30, 000 to determine the distribution of the regionally average Nusselt numbers along the outer tube, as a result of the impinging jets along the inner tube. Pressure measurement experiments give the pressure distributions in the airflows in the inner tube and between the inner and outer tubes. The pressure data is needed to determine the mass flow rates of the impinging jets along the inner tube. The results of the experiments are presented and discussed, the Nusselt numbers for the various cases studied are compared and major findings are reported. The results of this investigation should be particularly useful to engineers in the design of the leading edges of airfoils of modern gas turbine blades...|$|R
40|$|Laminated bending of <b>veneers</b> {{mean that}} <b>dried,</b> thin <b>veneers</b> or thin wood sheets are glued {{together}} {{under influence of}} pressure and eventually increased temperature. At {{the same time the}} product is given its desired shape, most often curved. This thermo hydro mechanical process offers several benefits. For example thick bends of small radiuses of any species of wood may be formed and poor quality wood containing knots, splits and other defects may be utilised. Laminated bends can usually be set more readily and made to conform better to the shape of the form than similar bends of solid wood. Further no softening treatment is generally required before the pieces are bent. However, there are also disadvantages e. g. more technical skill and better equipment are usually required than for solid wood bending. The presence of glue may be somewhat detrimental to the machines used for the final cleaning up of the bent pieces. Further the glue lines which are usually visible on the sides may be an aesthetical unappreciated effect [1],[2]. The quality of the laminated bended veneer products are obtained as an interaction between the process, the veneers and the glue [3]. In industries designing and producing these products it is of interest to obtain better understanding of how processing- and material parameters affect the product quality. With an improved understanding of the material and processing parameters {{it may be possible to}} increase the efficiency of wood utilisation and promote the development of new processes and products that manipulate the viscoelastic nature of wood. In particular the possibilities to obtain narrower radius of curvature and better possibilities of bending in more than one plane would be advantageous. This study has focused on the moisture content (MC) and the grain angle orientation in the veneers. These two specific aspects were assumed to have a great influence on spring-back and distortions of the laminated bended veneer products. Spring-back and distortions were therefore studied in separate tests where MC and the grain angle orientation was varied separately in manufactured laminated bended wood products. After manufacturing the products were exposed to variations in humidity and temperature whereupon the spring-back and distortions were measuredThree tests were performed. For the first and the second test a seat shell was selected as test product, figure 1 a. To the third test another product was selected, figure 1 b. This product was a small bookshelf. The company producing this shelf had experienced large problems considering distortions of this product. Further the product was very simple in shape with only one bend and therefore suitable for measurements. In the first test the influence of MC of the veneers was investigated. In the second and third test the influence of grain angle of the veneers was studied. For the study veneers of birch and beech were selected in the production. For the first and third study only birch veneers were used. The veneers were initially conditioned to equilibrium moisture contents (EMC) according to setups in different test groups. For the first study a test group was also built up from veneers taken directly out of production to study the industrial conditions. The seat shells in this test group contained veneers conditioned to EMC 4 %, except for the surface veneers that had been stored in the production hall. The humidity and temperature conditions in this room corresponded to MC 7 %. The manufacturing of the products were performed in industrial conditions. In the tests the products were built up from a number of veneers and the studied factors were varied between the veneers in a controlled manner. The results from the first test showed that the MC of the veneers influenced the spring-back and the distortions. A large moisture gradient between veneers and especially unsymmetrical placements of these in the construction were especially critical. The results from the second and third tests showed that grain angle deviation has large effect on the distortions of the products. Even a small grain angle deviation as in study two (5 °) resulted in large problems with distortions. The study also showed that when crossing two or more veneers with deviating grain angles there were cases when these faults interacted and multiplied the distortions. In production grain angle deviations can be a result of inaccurate placement of the veneers during pressing, incorrect cutting of the veneers, inherent from the growth of the tree or a combination of these factors. Deviations of the grain angle were, however, shown to have only small effects on spring-back. Upprättat; 2011; 20130911 (ysko...|$|R
40|$|The timber sector, i. e. {{forestry}} {{and timber}} industry, {{is an important}} industry in Ghana. It provides {{a significant contribution to}} Ghana’s foreign exchange earnings through wood products export, provides jobs and incomes for numerous local economies and communities. The timber production in Ghana is associated with an increasing environmental burden in terms of use of resources, and production of emissions and waste. The overall objective of this thesis was to quantify the environmental performance of the sector and to explore the possible options and strategies to sustain and improve the environmental performance of the timber sector in Ghana. To achieve this objective, the following research questions are addressed in successive chapters: (1) Is the timber sector in Ghana sustainable?, (2) What is the most dominant environmental pressure for the five major production lines in the Ghanaian timber industry, and what is the influence of the choice of functional unit?, (3) What does the most dominant environmental pressure contribute to the life cycle impact of the timber sector in Ghana?, and (4) Which potentials improvement options and strategies are available for reducing the major environmental impact in the timber sector in Ghana? The research for question 1 identified a sustainability gap that has been created as a result of aggressive competition between the informal and formal timber sectors for raw material supply. The subsequent life cycle assessment (LCA), in response to research question 2 and 3, showed  land use and wood waste as the most dominant environmental pressure for five major production lines (air dried lumber, kiln <b>dried</b> lumber, plywood, <b>veneer</b> and furniture parts). Land use and wood waste pressures will eventually lead to complete deforestation in the year 2025 if major policies are not implemented. The LCA results were sensitive to the choice of the functional unit (1 m 3, 1 kg and 1 euro). The money-based functional unit, that  was seen as more appropriate, favors the value-added products. This holds a promising future in terms of sustainability for the timber industry in Ghana. The impact assessment results showed a strong correlation between wood waste and land use as proxy for biodiversity loss, and also positive correlations between wood waste and the other five impacts results. Wood waste production was concluded as a major driving force for biodiversity loss, and a sufficiently good single indicator for all other environmental impact in the timber sector of Ghana. The research for question 4 showed that combining technological changes, good operational practices and recycling measures could reduce wood waste by approximately 50 %. This thesis presents a first step in exploring the possible options and strategies to sustain and improve the environmental performance of the timber sector in Ghana. The understanding of the link between sustainability and environmental assessment can help to design and implement good and working sustainability policies in Africa. The presented research therefore contributes to the development of integrated policy support approaches, which aim at strengthening the sustainable management of the timber sector in Ghana. This research may serve as a guide for policy-makers as well as for companies in elaborating measures to sustain and reduce environmental impacts in terms of possible future developments in the timber sector in Africa and particularly Ghana.  ...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1971 Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) {{ranging from}} 9. 6 to 14. 3 inches {{diameter}} breast height {{were treated with}} the organic arsenicals, monosodium methanearsonate (MSMA) and cacodylic acid. Treatments were applied at monthly intervals from February, 1967 to October, 1968, to ten to 25 trees each month. Treated trees were sampled in September, 1967 and September, 1968. The time lapse from treatment to harvest ranged from five to 19 months, during which time the trees were left standing in the forest to air-dry. Untreated control trees were cut in February, 1967 and at both of the September cutting dates. Treatments consisted of boring holes, one for each three inches of diameter at breast height and pouring ten to 20 milliliters of the herbicide in each hole. Wafer samples were cut from the ends of each log {{at the time the}} trees were cut. The respective diameters and moisture contents of the bark, sapwood and heartwood were recorded. Tree and log measurements were taken in the field. Individual logs were weighed after skidding to the landing for each harvest made in September. A model tree was constructed mathematically, based on measurements from the samples and field data, for a standard comparison of the moisture profiles of each treatment. The moisture profiles were determined by multiple linear stepwise regression analysis of the moisture contents of the sample components (bark, sapwood and heartwood) and data characterizing each sample. Weights of these components and the total tree for each treatment were determined by integration of the moisture profiles over the model tree. Percentage weight reductions range from negative values to values greater than 2 O percent. Weight losses were a result of drying in the bark and sapwood and loss of bark. MSMA treated trees were consistently drier than trees treated with cacodylic acid. The moisture content of the heartwood was unaffected by the treatments. Bark loss was more apparent and breakage tended to occur more frequently with long drying periods. The data suggest that treating in mid-summer after the major insect flights created trees unattractive to certain insects during the second year. The summer of 1967 was abnormally hot and dry and the summer of 1968 was abnormally wet. Thus, weather had an important bearing on results, particularly in reducing the drying exposure of trees treated in September and October, 1967. The economic implications and potentials of the results are discussed for various aspects of the forest industry and forest practices. Visual observations made of the treated trees being cut into lumber and veneer indicated that utilization processes were not adversely affected. Drying times longer than those tested appear to be possible without degrade. The drier wood enables more uniform kiln drying and reduces the time required for air drying by nearly 25 percent. This feature should be applicable to all types of drying of various products. This is especially important for products requiring very long drying periods such as poles and pilings. Benefits of field drying carry through logging, shipping, manufacturing, and handling. Drying was adequate to permit faster <b>drying</b> of sapwood <b>veneer.</b> At the moisture contents obtained there was no effect on the veneer process nor on pulping quality. The loss of weight was adequate for an appreciable increase of the volume per truck load for hauling, and for an increase in the efficiency of present logging equipment while making less expensive equipment more practical. This type of treatment permits more intensive management of timber stands, enabling the land manager to accomplish many objectives at one time and has the potential of reducing the diameter of the marginal tree. Storage of the wood fiber on the stump by continuous thinnings is a logical outgrowth of the above findings. This practice would keep the stand at optimum stocking for maximum growth while maintaining the killed trees in salvagable condition. The combined silvicultural benefits of insect and disease control, along with slash reduction and reduction of operating costs in logging and manufacturing, provide a tool of broad utility to forest managers...|$|R
