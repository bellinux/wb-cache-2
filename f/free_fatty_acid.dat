25|$|Fat {{cells have}} an {{important}} physiological role in maintaining triglyceride and <b>free</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> levels, as well as determining insulin resistance. Abdominal fat has a different metabolic profile—being more prone to induce insulin resistance. This explains {{to a large degree}} why central obesity is a marker of impaired glucose tolerance and is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease (even in the absence of diabetes mellitus and hypertension). Studies of female monkeys at Wake Forest University (2009) discovered that individuals suffering from higher stress have higher levels of visceral fat in their bodies. This suggests a possible cause-and-effect link between the two, wherein stress promotes the accumulation of visceral fat, which in turn causes hormonal and metabolic changes that contribute to heart disease and other health problems.|$|E

IHN is usually sold as [...] "flush-free" [...] or [...] "no-flush" [...] niacin in units of 250, 500, or 1000mg/tablets or capsules. It is sold as an over-the-counter formulation, and often is marketed and labeled as niacin, thus misleading consumers into thinking they are getting the active form of the medication. [...] While this form of niacin does not cause the flushing associated with the immediate-release products, the evidence that it has lipid-modifying functions is disputed. As the clinical trials date from the early 1960s (Dorner, Welsh) or the late 1970s (Ziliotto, Kruse, Agusti), {{it is difficult to}} assess them by today's standards. One of the last of those studies affirmed the superiority of inositol and xantinol esters of nicotinic acid for reducing serum <b>free</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acid,</b> but other studies conducted during the same period found no benefit.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Biodiesel is an {{alternative}} fuel for diesel engines consisting of the alkyl monoesters of <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> from vegetable oils or animal fats. Most of the biodiesel that is currently made uses soybean oil, methanol, and an alkaline catalyst. The high value of soybean oil as a food product makes production of a cost–effective fuel very challenging. However, there are large amounts of low–cost oils and fats such as restaurant waste and animal fats that could be converted to biodiesel. The problem with processing these low cost oils and fats is that they often contain large amounts of <b>free</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> (FFA) that cannot be converted to biodiesel using an alkaline catalyst. In this study, a technique is described to reduce the <b>free</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> content of these feedstocks using an acid–catalyzed pretreatment to esterify the <b>free</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> before transesterifying the triglycerides with an alkaline catalyst to complete the reaction. Initial process development was performed with synthetic mixtures containing 20 % and 40 % <b>free</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids,</b> prepared using palmitic acid. Process parameters such as the molar ratio of alcohol, type of alcohol, acid catalyst amount, reaction time, and <b>free</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> level were investigated {{to determine the best}} strategy for converting the <b>free</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> to usable esters. The work showed that the acid level of the high <b>free</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> feedstocks could be reduced to less than 1 % with a 2 –step pretreatment reaction. The reaction mixture was allowed to settle between steps so that the water–containing alcohol phase could be removed. The 2 –step pretreatment reaction was demonstrated with actual feedstocks, including yellow grease with 12 % <b>free</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> and brown grease with 33 % <b>free</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids.</b> After reducing the acid levels of these feedstocks to less than 1 %, the transesterification reaction was completed with an alkaline catalyst to produce fuel–grade biodiesel...|$|R

40|$|Transport of <b>free</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> {{from the}} blood into the splanchnic region and their {{conversion}} to triglycerides of very low density lipoproteins, together with estimates of splanchnic oxidation of <b>free</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> to ketones and to carbon dioxide and water, {{have been made in}} the postabsorptive state in seven normolipemic subjects, six with primary endogenous hyperlipemia and one each with primary dysbetalipoproteinemia and mixed hyperlipemia. Net systemic transport of <b>free</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> into the blood was the same in normolipemic and hyperlipemic groups, but a greater fraction was taken up in the splanchnic region in the latter. Transport into the blood in very low density lipoproteins of triglyceride <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> derived from <b>free</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> was proportional and bore the same relationship to splanchnic uptake of <b>free</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> in the two groups. In normolipemic subjects, near equilibration of specific activities after 4 hr infusion of palmitate- 1 - 14 C showed that almost all triglyceride <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> of very low density lipoproteins and acetoacetate were derived from <b>free</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> taken up in the splanchnic region. In the hyperlipemic subjects, equilibration of <b>free</b> <b>fatty</b> acidcarbon with acetoacetate was almost complete, but not with triglyceride <b>fatty</b> <b>acids,</b> owing at least in part to increased pool size. Comparison of the rate of equilibration of triglyceride fatty acids- 14 C with rate of inflow transport from the splanchnic region, together with other data, indicated that most of the circulating triglyceride <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> of very low density lipoproteins in hyperlipemic subjects were also derived from <b>free</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids.</b> Although mean inflow transport of triglyceride <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> was greater in the hyperlipemic subjects, it correlated poorly with their concentration and it appeared that efficiency of mechanisms for extrahepatic removal must be a major determinant of the concentration of triglycerides in blood plasma of the normolipemic as well as the hyperlipemic subjects. Estimates of splanchnic respiratory quotient supported the concept that oxidation of <b>free</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> accounts for almost all of splanchnic oxygen consumption in the postabsorptive state. Splanchnic oxygen consumption was greater in the hyperlipemics, but fractional oxidation of <b>free</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> to ketones was higher in normolipemic subjects. Calculations of splanchnic balance indicate that a larger fraction of <b>free</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> was stored in lipids of splanchnic tissues in the hyperlipemics.
