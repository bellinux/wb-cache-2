Therefore, when the construction of seadikes is planned, the effective heightof seadikes and the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>scouring</b> have to be determined under careful considera-tion. This paper presents the experimental result of scour due to waves. In this paper, first, it is cleared that the wave action of scouring at the toe ofseadikes {{is divided into two}} parts: occurrence of bed roller and sand movement alongthe bed, and four types of scour behaviours by the location of seadikes are revealed. Furthermore, it is found that the maximum depth of scour is approximately equal tothe wave height in deep water and the location of seadikes where the maximum scouroccurs is related to the depth of breaking of incident waves. In addition, the scours at the toe of seadikes along Mie Coast due to Typhoon No. 13 and Isewan Typhoon are discussed based on this experimental result...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Sedimentation in {{reservoirs}} and {{the corresponding}} loss of storage capacity {{is one of the}} most serious problems in dam engineering. Pressurized flushing, a way to remove sediments from the reservoir, is flushing under a pressurized flow condition and nearly constant water level. Pressurized flushing has only local effects around the outlet. Sediment in the vicinity of the outlet openings is scoured and a funnel shaped crater is created. In this study, the temporal development of flushing cone under various hydraulic conditions was studied experimentally. Time variations of parameters such as maximum length and width of flushing and also <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>scouring</b> cone was measured. Results indicated that an increase in flow velocity (and consequently in Froude number) established new hydraulically conditions for flushing mechanism and so a sudden growth was observed in the amount of sediment released and also scouring dimenssions. In addition, a set of nondimensional relationships were identified for temporal variations of flushing scour dimenssions, which can eventuallt be used to estimate the development of flushing cone.

40|$|The flood {{damage of}} {{engineering}} structures in rivers because <b>of</b> <b>scour</b> near pumping stations, bridge structures – abutments, guide banks, dams, etc. leads to considerable environmental and economical losses. The reason <b>of</b> <b>scour</b> is multiple floods and therefore scour hole parameters near structures under clear-water conditions are summed up and increase from flood to flood. When <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>scour</b> hole reaches critical value for foundations, structure usually is destroyed. To estimate the engineering structures safety and stability the flood damage risk assessment {{should be performed}} and in necessary cases protection measures {{should be used to}} prevent engineering structures from failure.

40|$|The {{failure of}} guide banks because <b>of</b> <b>scour</b> at {{stratified}} bed conditions {{leads to the}} flow redistribution and an unpredicted scour at the alignment of the bridge crossing; as a result, this can be the reason for failure of piers and/or abutments.

Based on the condition that at an equilibrium stage <b>of</b> <b>scour</b> is when the local velocity becomes equal to the critical one, formulas for calculating the equilibrium <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>scour</b> at the head of elliptical guide banks at uniform sand and stratified bed is elaborated. The most critical conditions for structures is when fine-sand layer is under coarse-sand layer.

In this case, the dominant grain size for calculating the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>scour</b> under stratified bed conditions is the mean diameter of the second layer or of the next one, where the scour stops.

40|$|Abstract: A {{series of}} {{experiments}} were conducted on scour depth around a L-shape spur dike with model L-shape spur dike was measured in a laboratory flume with 180 degree bend under clear-water. L-shape spur dike models were angled for different locations and lengths of L-shape spur dikes at the bend with various Froude number. The main goals of the experiments were to evaluate {{the effect of the}} four lengths on the depth of scour and potential aquatic habitat and on minimizing erosion adjacent to the stream banks. The experiments showed that of the four lengths tested, the least local scour the near bank region was associated with the L-shape spur dikes with 30 degree angles, while the greatest depth of the scour hole was associated with the 75 degree spur dike. By increasing the length of the spur dike, the maximum depth of scour increases. With increasing Froude number the maximum scour depth increases.

The study was conducted using in a 180 degree laboratory flume bend. Experiments were conducted for different wing shapes of T-shape spur dikes at the bend with various Froude number. In this study, the time development of the local scour around the T-shape spur dike plates was studied. The time development of the scour hole around the model T-shape spur dike installed was compared with similar studies on spur dikes. The results of the model study indicated that the maximum depth of scour is highly dependent on the experimental duration. It was observed that, as Froude number increases, the scour increases.

40|$|International audienceThis study {{focuses on}} 2 D Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) {{numerical}} modelling of {{the erosion of}} a cohesive soil by a circular impinging turbulent jet. Initially, the model is validated {{in the case of}} a non erodible flat plate. Several turbulence models are compared to experimental results and to simplified formulas available in the literature. The results obtained show that the Reynolds Stress Model (RSM) is in good agreement with the semi-empirical results in the literature. Nonetheless, the RSM cannot be used with successive remeshings, due to its convergence issues. The shear stress at the wall is well-described by the k-ε model while the pressure is better-described by the k-ω model. The numerical model of erosion is based on adaptive remeshing of the water/soil interface to ensure the good precision of the mechanical values at the wall. The two erosion parameters are the critical shear stress and the erosion coefficient. The results obtained are compared with the semi-empirical model interpreting the Jet Erosion Test. The k-ε model underestimates the shear stress and does not allow simulation of the entire erosion process, whereas the results obtained with the k-ω model agree well with the semi-empirical model and experimental data. A study of the influence of erosion parameters on erosion kinetics and scouring depth shows that the shape and <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>scouring</b> are influenced solely by the critical shear stress while the duration of scouring depends on both erosion parameters. Further research is nonetheless required to better understand the erosion mechanisms in the stagnation zone...|$|E
40|$|Described {{are three}} methods for {{determining}} the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>scour</b> at bridge piers and abutments. Two methods also determine the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> foundation. Each method has its own unique advantage depending on the river environment. The Parallel Seismic Survey (PSS) is most useful {{for determining the}} <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>scour</b> during non-flood stages of a river when the scour annulus may be filled in by silt or loose sand as the flood stage subsides. In addition, the PSS technique also provides information about the depth {{to the bottom of}} the foundation, and also can be used for just that purpose.

For the case when the bridge piers located in river bend, little information is available. In this study, a series of experimental tests have been conducted in a 180 degree laboratory flume bend with a relative curvature of bend of 4. 67. One oblong model pier of width 60 mm and length 180 mm was used for the study in seven different positions of 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150 and 180 degree under three different flow conditions were tested. Natural sand with uniform graining of d 50 = 2 mm and uniformity factor of 1. 7 were used as bed materials.

During multiple floods the scour hole parameters, under clear-water conditions, are summed up {{and increases in}} time. The differential equation of equilibrium of the bed sediment movement in clear water was used, and a method for calculating the scour development with time at the intakes (abutments, guide banks) during the multiple floods was elaborated and confirmed with experimental data (Gjunsburgs et al., 2001, 2004). Method for computing equilibrium <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>scour</b> and it’s analysis is presented in this paper. The method based on the conditions that at equilibrium stage <b>of</b> <b>scour</b> the local velocity Vlt becomes equal to critical one kβV 0 t. According to theoretical analysis, the relative equilibrium <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>scour</b> is depending on flow contraction rate; kinetic parameter of the flow; ratio of the Froude number to the river slope; relative flow depth; dimensionless grain size; stratified riverbed conditions; ratio of the local and critical velocities; side-wall slope, and angle of flow crossing.

Damages or failure of engineering structures in flow because scour at the foundations under stratified bed conditions is an important problem, which is not studied well. The differential equation of equilibrium for the bed sediment movement for clear-water conditions is used and a method for computing the scour development with time at the elliptical guide banks is elaborated. The method is confirmed by experimental data. This method allows one to calculate the scour depth development under stratified bed conditions with different thickness and sequence of the layers. The most critical conditions for structures occur when a fine-sand layer is under a coarse-sand layer. According to the results obtained in tests and by the method presented, the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>scour</b> is always greater when a fine-sand layer is under a coarse-sand layer(s). Using the mean grain size {{on the top of}} the river bed for calculation the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>scour,</b> neglecting stratification, can lead to the wrong results and possible damages and losses...|$|R
40|$|Four {{classes of}} {{variables}} are {{apparent in the}} problem <b>of</b> <b>scour</b> around bridge piers and abutments [...] geometry of piers and abutments, stream-flow characteristics, sediment characteristics, and geometry of site. The laboratory investigation, from its inception, has been divided into four phases based on these classes. In each phase the variables {{in three of the}} classes are held constant and those in the pertinent class are varied. To date, the first three phases have been studied. Typical scour bole patterns related to the geometry of the pier or abutment have been found. For equilibrium conditions <b>of</b> <b>scour</b> with uniform sand, the velocity of flow and the sand size do not appear to have any measurable effects on the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>scour.</b> This result is especially encouraging in the search for correlation between model and prototype since it would indicate that, primarily, only the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> flow might be involved in the scale effect. The technique of model testing has been simplified, therefore, because rate of sediment transportation {{does not need to be}} scaled. Prior to the establishment of equilibrium conditions, however, <b>depths</b> <b>of</b> <b>scour</b> in excess <b>of</b> those for equilibrium conditions have been found. A concept <b>of</b> active <b>scour</b> as an imbalance between sediment transport capacity and rate of sediment supply has been used to explain the laboratory observations...|$|R

Current {{research shows that the}} <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> the <b>scour</b> hole is decreased by using rectangular collars around circular piers. This study determined the approximate optimum dimensions for rectangular collars to minimize the temporal trend <b>of</b> <b>scouring</b> around a pier model. Effects of different sizes of rectangular collars on a model pier were investigated both at the upstream and downstream of the flume. It was observed that irrespective of the rectangular collar dimensions the upstream and the downstream were estimated to be 0. 86 and 1. 42, respectively. The optimum collar width was estimated to be 2. 8 times the diameter of the pier. By using this optimized collar dimension, the non-dimensional <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>scour</b> reached a min value of 0. 034 at 72 h.

Experiments were conducted {{in a wide range}} of Froude numbers, grain sizes, tailwater depths, and stilling basin slopes. The results showed that the scour profiles at any bed slope follow shape similarity. However, the longitude evolution <b>of</b> <b>scour</b> profiles and the volume of eroded materials were increasing in accordance with slope of basin. A polynomial equation was derived to define the non-dimensional profiles under different slopes. The time evolution <b>of</b> <b>scour</b> hole dimensions and the equilibrium state were defined. It was found that under a specific condition of sediment grain size, approaching Froude number, the length and slope of adverse basin, the scour depth at the downstream of adverse basin, initially increases with tailwater depth, and after reaching its maximum value decreases to a constant value. It was also observed that the maximum <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>scour</b> hole was decreased as the length and slope of stilling basin increased, whereas the longitudinal dimensions of the hole were increased. It was found that the maximum <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>scour</b> hole occurs at the vicinity of side walls with slight decrease in the centerline. Finally, a power equation was expressed to fully define the dimensions <b>of</b> <b>scour</b> hole, time scale and geometry of sluice gate...|$|R

Accurate {{estimation}} of the maximum possible <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>scour</b> at bridge abutments is important in decision-making for the safe <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> burial of footings. Besides, investigation of the geometric features <b>of</b> <b>scour</b> holes around abutments provides useful information for the degree <b>of</b> <b>scour</b> counter-measure to be imple-mented against excessive scouring. Experiments have been performed to investi-gate time-dependent characteristics <b>of</b> <b>scour</b> holes around vertical wall abutments under clear water conditions with uniform bed materials. Temporal variations <b>of</b> <b>scour</b> <b>depth</b> and scour contours were measured. Using this information, an empir-ical relation was developed for temporal variation <b>of</b> <b>scour</b> <b>depth.</b> Additional rela-tions were also derived for time-dependent volume and surface area <b>of</b> the <b>scour</b> holes around abutments.
