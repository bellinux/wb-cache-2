More specifically, her recent interests have focused on the coordination behavior of lanthanides and actinides. Her group is especially active in developing therapeutics to treat people who have been exposed to radionuclides or atoms that contain excess nuclear charge. These radionuclides can include plutonium, americium, curium, uranium, plutonium, and neptunium. Recent work by the BioActinide Research group has involved synthesis of different actinide chelating agents {{that could be used to}} selectively bind radionuclides in the human body in order to safely remove them.Currently, the only drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat radionuclide contamination is <b>diethylenetriaminepentaacetic</b> <b>acid</b> (DTPA) (Figure 1). DTPA has shown some promise is treating plutonium poisoning, but this treatment is specific only to plutonium. Furthermore, DTPA must be administered intravenously, which is an issue due to the extremely time-sensitive nature of radiation poisoning. In the quest of finding a more versatile and easily administered treatment for radiation poisoning, Abergel sees potential in developing new classes of therapeutics.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Vascular parameters, such as {{vascular}} volume, flow, and permeability, {{are important}} disease biomarkers for both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Therefore, {{it is essential}} to develop approaches to monitor the changes in pancreatic microvasculature non-invasively. METHODS: Here, we describe the application of the long-circulating, paramagnetic T 1 contrast agent, protected Graft Copolymer bearing covalently linked gadolinium <b>diethylenetriaminepentaacetic</b> <b>acid</b> residues and labelled with fluorescein (PGC-GdDTPA-F) for the non-invasive semi-quantitative evaluation of vascular changes in diabetic models using magnetic resonance imaging. RESULTS: We observed a significantly higher accumulation of protected graft copolymer bearing covalently linked gadolinium <b>diethylenetriaminepentaacetic</b> <b>acid</b> residues and labelled with fluorescein in the pancreata of BBDR rats induced to develop diabetes, as compared to non-diabetic controls at 1 h post-injection. No differences were seen in the blood pool, kidney, or muscle, indicating that the effect is specific to the diabetic pancreas. Fluorescence microscopy revealed a marked increase in contrast agent availability in the pancreas with the development of the pathology. Similar changes were noted in the homozygous Leprdb mouse model of type 2 diabetes. This effect appeared to result both from the increase of vascular volume and permeability. CONCLUSIONS: High-molecular weight paramagnetic blood volume contrast agents are valuable for the in vivo definition of pancreatic microvasculature dynamics by magnetic resonance imaging. The increase in vascular volume and permeability, associated with diabetic inflammation, can be monitored non-invasively and semi-quantitatively by magnetic resonance imaging in diabetic BBDR rats.
