40|$|An {{algorithm}} {{has been}} devised to reduce ground clutter {{in the data}} products of the CloudSat Cloud Profiling Radar (CPR), which is a nadir-looking radar instrument, in orbit around the Earth, that measures power backscattered by clouds {{as a function of}} distance from the instrument. Ground clutter contaminates the CPR data in the lowest 1 km of the atmospheric profile, heretofore making it impossible to use CPR data to satisfy the scientific interest in studying clouds and light rainfall at low altitude. The algorithm is based partly {{on the fact that the}} CloudSat orbit is such that the <b>geodetic</b> <b>altitude</b> of the CPR varies continuously over a range of approximately 25 km. As the <b>geodetic</b> <b>altitude</b> changes, the radar timing parameters are changed at intervals defined by flight software in order to keep the troposphere inside a data-collection time window. However, within each interval, the surface of the Earth continuously "scans through" (that is, it moves across) a few range bins of the data time window. For each radar profile, only few samples [one for every range-bin increment ((Delta) r = 240 m) ] of the surface-clutter signature are available around the range bin in which the peak of surface return is observed, but samples in consecutive radar profiles are offset slightly (by amounts much less than (Delta) r) with respect to each other according to the relative change in <b>geodetic</b> <b>altitude.</b> As a consequence, in a case in which the surface area under examination is homogenous (e. g., an ocean surface), a sequence of consecutive radar profiles of the surface in that area contains samples of the surface response with range resolution (Delta) p much finer than the range-bin increment ((Delta) p 10 dB and a reduction of the contaminated altitude over ocean from about 1 km to about 0. 5 km (over the ocean). The algorithm has been embedded in CloudSat L 1 B processing as of Release 04 (July 2007), and the estimated flat surface clutter is removed in L 2 B-GEOPROF product from the observed profile of reflectivity (see CloudSat product documentation for details and performance at [URL] dataSpecs. php?prodid= 1) ...|$|E

40|$|The {{advent of}} remote sensors with high spatial {{resolution}} such as Ikonos II and Quickbird has facilitated {{the natural resources}} assessment around the world. Images obtained from these sensors usually are found in raw format, which contain geometric errors caused by panoramic distortation, plataform velocity, earth rotation, perspective, topographic relief displacement, among others. In order to get precise measurements from these images, {{it is necessary that}} they be orthorectified. Thus, the objective of this work was to compare, visually, a digital map obtained from topographic survey using a Total Station, assumed to be the ground truth, overlayed on raw, rectified (using affine transformation) and orthorectified (using polynomial ratio model with different geodetic systems) images obtained in rugged terrain conditions, located in Zona da Mata region, State of Minas Gerais - Brazil. The best overlay results occurred when the orthorectified image were generated using MDE and Ground Control Points in the same geodetic system and both using ortometric or <b>geodetic</b> <b>altitudes.</b> On the other hand, the worst overlay result occurred when the raw image was used. In conclusion, this article shows the importance of using the correct geodetic parameters during the image orthorectification procedures. Pages: 1787 - 179...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Basic {{geodetic}} {{theory is}} applied to determine the geodetic azimuth and <b>geodetic</b> <b>altitude</b> required to point dish antennas to geostationary communi-cation satellites. The mathematical treatment presented here takes into consider-ation the ellipticity of the earth. This generalization contrasts with standard formulas published intechnical books in satellite communication e gineering where a spher-ical approximation is implemented. Comparisons between the spherical nd more rigorous ellipsoidal methods are discussed. Although {{the differences between the}} two approaches are not significant, hey should be taken into consideration when very precise pointing to geostationary communication satellites or other space ob-jects is dictated. The suggested method is simple to understand and straightforward to implement, and due to its advantages should replace any spherical alternative currently in use...|$|E

40|$|A postflight FORTRAN {{program called}} 'radar' reads and {{analyzes}} ground-based radar data. The output includes position, velocity, and acceleration parameters. Air data parameters are also provided if atmospheric characteristics are input. This program can read data from any radar in three formats. Geocentric Cartesian position {{can also be}} used as input, which may be from an inertial navigation or Global Positioning System. Options include spike removal, data filtering, and atmospheric refraction corrections. Atmospheric refraction can be corrected using the quick White Sands method or the gradient refraction method, which allows accurate analysis of very low elevation angle and long-range data. Refraction properties are extrapolated from surface conditions, or a measured profile may be input. Velocity is determined by differentiating position. Accelerations are determined by differentiating velocity. This paper describes the algorithms used, gives the operational details, and discusses the limitations and errors of the program. Appendices A through E contain the derivations for these algorithms. These derivations include an improvement in speed to the exact solution for <b>geodetic</b> <b>altitude,</b> an improved algorithm over earlier versions for determining scale height, a truncation algorithm for speeding up the gradient refraction method, and a refinement of the coefficients used in the White Sands method for Edwards AFB, California.

40|$|Site Test Interferometers (STIs) {{have been}} {{deployed}} at two different locations at the NASA Deep Space Network (DSN) tracking complex in Goldstone, California. An STI measures the difference in path length between a geostationary satellite and two antennas on the Earth, producing a measure of atmospheric phase fluctuations over spatial distances comparable to those between elements of possible microwave phased arrays. The purposes of the Goldstone STIs are to assess the suitability of Goldstone as an array site and to statistically characterize atmospheric induced delay fluctuations for application to future array scenarios. The two STI's are separated by 13 km across the Goldstone complex. Each instrument is composed of two small-diameter antennas and associated electronics separated by approx. 200 meters in a principally east-west configuration. The antennas continuously observe signals emitted by geo-stationary satellites and produce data that contain information on the phase difference between signals received by both antennas. The fluctuation in delay (or path length difference) statistics derived from these data sets {{can be used to}} infer power loss for particular array configurations. We report on a comparison of the root mean square (RMS) phase delay statistics estimated over 10 -minute intervals between the two Goldstone STIs. We have achieved good statistical agreement between the data acquired from the two STIs, given that each instrument is observing different satellites, at different frequencies, over different baseline lengths, with very different implementations, and are located 13 km apart in widely separated terrain at different <b>geodetic</b> <b>altitudes...</b>|$|R
