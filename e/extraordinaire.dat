5|$|As {{dissatisfaction with}} the secession grew, Ngalula and other South Kasaian émigrés in Léopoldville plotted to {{overthrow}} the regime in Bakwanga.

50|$|Although many {{contemporary}} write-ups {{about the film}} suggested a connection with Jules Verne's works (see the Release and reception section below), the film is not an adaptation of any of his famous Voyages <b>Extraordinaires</b> novels; rather, it is a parodic, satiric homage to the entire Voyages <b>Extraordinaires</b> series, in something of the same style as Albert Robida's Verne-spoofing comic novel Voyages très <b>extraordinaires</b> de Saturnin Farandoul (1879-1880). If anything, the film {{may be said to}} be inspired very loosely by Verne's The Adventures of Captain Hatteras or his The Sphinx of the Ice Fields.|$|R

25|$|The {{following}} year, Liszt took up {{a long-standing}} invitation of Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna of Russia to settle at Weimar, {{where he had been}} appointed Kapellmeister <b>Extraordinaire</b> in 1842, remaining there until 1861. During this period he acted as conductor at court concerts and on special occasions at the theatre. He gave lessons to a number of pianists, including the great virtuoso Hans von Bülow, who married Liszt's daughter Cosima in 1857 (years later, she would marry Richard Wagner). He also wrote articles championing Berlioz and Wagner. Finally, Liszt had ample time to compose and during the next 12 years revised or produced those orchestral and choral pieces upon which his reputation as a composer mainly rested.|$|E

500|$|Under Blackstone's {{direction}} the Club {{was invited to}} perform at several conventions of the American Choral Directors Association, including the 1997 National Convention in San Diego. The Club also released six compact discs during this time and was featured on Mannheim Steamroller's 2001 album Christmas <b>Extraordinaire,</b> with Blackstone co-credited as choir director.

500|$|As a {{condition}} of his release at Leipzig, he agreed {{not to participate in}} combat against France. [...] Subsequent to his release, Merveldt was appointed commanding general of Moravia, and lived in Brno, where he received in January 1814 the instructions to proceed to London as an envoy <b>extraordinaire</b> to the Court of St. James's, replacing Baron Wessembourg. He arrived in London in early March, and met the Prince Regent at Carlton House on 7March 1814, where he ceremoniously presented his ambassadorial credentials. He was well-received in Britain, and became a notable personage, invited to many social events; he told good stories about the wars and the various people he had encountered, which made him popular in social circles. [...] His comings and goings were widely reported in the society columns: For example, on 4July 1814, he attended a lecture by the Abbé Secard, and was listed among the distinguished persons present. When he died in 1815, the British government proposed to bury him at Westminster Abbey. However, his widow took into account his last wishes and had the remains sent to Germany. He was buried in the crypt of the Michaelis chappel in Lembeck Castle where his grave still exists.|$|E
