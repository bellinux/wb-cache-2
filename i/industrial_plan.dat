The population growth rate surged as {{the mortality rate}} dropped more rapidly than the birth rate. China's massive population {{has always been a}} major difficulty for the government as it has struggled to provide for it. In the 1950s, food supply was inadequate and the standard of living was generally low. This spurred the authorities to initiate a major birth control program. The Great Leap Forward <b>industrial</b> <b>plan</b> in 1958–60 was partially responsible for a huge famine that caused the death rate to surpass the birth rate, and by 1960, the overall population was declining. A second population control drive began in 1962 with major efforts focused on promoting late marriages and the use of contraceptives. By 1963 the country was in the beginning of recovery from the famine and the birth rate soared to its highest since 1949 with an annual population growth rate of 3%. In 1966, the Cultural Revolution suspended this second family planning program, but resumed four years later with the third attempt by making later marriage and family size limitation an obligation. Since 1970, the efforts have been much more effective. The third family planning program continued until 1979 when the one child per family policy was implemented. By the early 1980s, China's population reached around 1billion and by the early 2000s, surpassed 1.3billion. In the 1980s, the average overall population growth was around 1.5%. In the 1990s, this fell to about 1%. Today it is about 0.6%. China's population growth rate is now among the lowest for a developing country, although, due to its large population, annual net population growth is still considerable. One demographic consequence of the one-child policy is that China {{is now one of the}} most rapidly ageing countries in the world.|$|E

SWF allocations are balanced across risky asset classes, very home-region biased, and very biased toward certain industries, in particular, toward finance (owning 4. 8 % of world equity) and transportation, energy and telecommunication. SWFs invest actively (with control rights) in {{both public and}} private sectors, but mainly in these industries in their home regions. We use these allocations to understand better the objectives that drive SWF investment decisions. We find evidence for financial portfolio investor benchmarking and for hedging of income covariance risk.

50|$|This Gallery {{was opened}} in 1967 {{pursuant}} {{to the efforts of}} Zoltán Xantus. According to the intentions of the official cultural policy of this era, the Gallery assumed a sort of vent function in the cultural life of Budapest. As a substitute for the blacklisted <b>Industrial</b> <b>Plan</b> exhibitions, this is where the upcoming generation of young artists had the opportunity to organise their exhibitions dubbed avant-garde. Exhibitions are organised at this Gallery to this day, which assumes the task of presenting every relevant school of contemporary fine and applied art. Its other key role involves introducing young professional artists making their debut to the audience and the general public. The past 17 years has demonstrated that the concept was indeed a good one, as a result of which the Gallery evolved into a popular and prestigious exhibition hall.|$|E
50|$|Major {{oxidative}} {{degradation products}} of MDEA include monoethanol amine (MEA), methyl-aminoethanol (MAE), diethanolamine (DEA), amino acids bicine, glycine and hydroxyethyl sarcosine (HES), formyl amides of MAE and DEA, ammonia, and stable salts formate, glycolate, acetate, and oxalate. In an <b>industrial</b> <b>plan</b> that utilizes MDEA, oxidative degradation {{is most likely}} to shift to the cross exchanger where temperatures are greater than 70 °C. Higher temperatures and higher CO2 loading accelerate the rate of degradation, resulting in an increase of alkalinity loss as well as total formate production. While MDEA is more resistant to degradation as a standalone compared to MEA, MDEA is preferentially degraded when in an MDEA/MEA blend. Because of the formation of DEA and MAE, which could form nitroso-compounds or diethylnitrosamine and diethylnitraine, the blend could potentially have an adverse impact in terms of atmospheric admissions. In the Boundary Dam plant, emissions increased when CO2 loading of lean amine increased for the blend and MEA. However, decreasing the lean loading increases the reboiler heat duty, which results in an obvious tradeoff between emissions and heat duty or energy costs.|$|E

The Allies' immediate post-war [...] "industrial disarmament" [...] plan for Germany had been to destroy Germany's capability to wage war by complete or partial de-industrialization. The first <b>industrial</b> <b>plan</b> for Germany, signed in 1946, required the destruction of 1,500 manufacturing plants to lower German heavy industry output to roughly 50% of its 1938 level. Dismantling of West German industry ended in 1951. By 1950, equipment had been removed from 706 manufacturing plants, and steel production capacity had been reduced by 6.7 million tons. After lobbying by the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Generals Lucius D. Clay and George Marshall, the Truman administration accepted that economic recovery in Europe could not go forward without the reconstruction of the German industrial base on which it had previously been dependent. In July 1947, President Truman rescinded on [...] "national security grounds" [...] the directive that had ordered the US occupation forces to [...] "take no steps looking toward the economic rehabilitation of Germany." [...] A new directive recognised that [...] "an orderly, prosperous Europe requires the economic contributions of a stable and productive Germany."
