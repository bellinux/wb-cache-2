50|$|<b>Free</b> <b>machining</b> {{steel is}} steel that forms small chips when machined. This {{increases}} the machinability {{of the material}} by breaking the chips into small pieces, thus avoiding entanglement in the machinery.

50|$|<b>Free</b> <b>machining</b> steels are {{carbon steels}} that have sulfur, lead, bismuth, selenium, tellurium, or {{phosphorus}} added. Sulfur forms the compound manganese sulfide, which {{is soft and}} acts as a chip-breaking discontinuity. It also acts as a dry lubricant to prevent a built up edge on the cutting tool. Lead works {{in a similar way}} to sulfur. Bismuth achieves a <b>free</b> <b>machining</b> steel by melting into a thin film of liquid for a fraction of a microsecond to lubricate the cut. Other advantages to bismuth include: more uniformly distributed because of its similar density to iron; more environmentally friendly, as compared to lead; still weldable.|$|E

40|$|<b>Free</b> {{abrasive}} <b>machining</b> {{processes such as}} lapping, polishing, and wiresaw slicing {{are widely}} used in industry {{for the purposes of}} material removal. A lot of research efforts [1 - 8] have been carried out to understand the effect of different process parameters such as slurry concentration, abrasive size distribution, applied loads on material removal rate, surface roughness of the workpiece, material removal mechanism etc. Effects of mixed abrasive slurries on material removal rate and surface roughness have hardly been studied in previous research. Material removal mechanisms: The material removal mechanisms involved in <b>free</b> abrasive <b>machining</b> processes can be classified into essentially three categories as illustrated in Figure 1. <b>Free</b> abrasive <b>machining</b> primarily remove material using either rolling indenting or rolling scratching mechanisms while fixed abrasive machining processes primarily involve pure scratching. The mechanisms involved in various <b>free</b> abrasive <b>machining</b> processes have been illustrated graphically in Figure 2. In rolling-scratching process abrasives often get trapped between the plate and the workpiece. Thus, the abrasives are not as uniformly distributed as in rolling-indenting, in which the abrasives are free to move.

50|$|Exors of James Mills were {{manufacturers}} of steel products for over 100 years, the company growing {{from a small}} building employing two men to the large Bredbury Steelworks on Lower Bents Lane, which at its height employed over 2,000 people. In {{the early part of}} the 20th century, the company began to roll steel and to produce bright steel, at one point becoming the largest producer of bright steel outside the United States. Other products were added from time to time, including cotters for locomotives and rolling stock, engineer's keys, taper pins, grooved fastenings for securing all kinds of assemblies, railway permanent way fastenings, rail lubricators and hot pressings of various types. In 1938 the company introduced lead-bearing steels to the United Kingdom, and in the 1960s developed <b>free</b> <b>machining</b> steels containing tellurium and an alloy replacement steel. The company was later acquired by GKN and closed down in 1985. The site has since been redeveloped for housing.|$|E

50|$|Monel R-405 is the <b>free</b> <b>machining</b> {{version of}} Monel 400. It is a nickel-copper alloy with a {{controlled}} amount of sulfur added to provide sulfide inclusions {{that act as}} chip breakers during machining. Like Monel 400, alloy R-405 is resistant to sea water and steam at high temperatures {{as well as to}} salt and caustic solutions. Monel R-405 is a solid solution alloy that can only be hardened by cold working. This nickel alloy exhibits characteristics like good corrosion-resistance, good weldability and high strength. A low corrosion rate in rapidly flowing brackish or seawater combined with excellent resistance to stress corrosion cracking in most freshwaters combined to its resistance to a variety of corrosive conditions justifies its wide use in marine applications and other non-oxidizing chloride solutions. This nickel steel alloy is particularly resistant to hydrochloric and hydrofluoric acids when they are de-aerated. As would be expected from its high copper content, alloy R-405 is rapidly attacked by nitric acid and ammonia systems.|$|E
