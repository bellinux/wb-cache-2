50|$|The South Asian river dolphin (Platanista gangetica) is a {{freshwater}} or river dolphin {{found in}} India, Bangladesh, Nepal and Pakistan which is {{split into two}} subspecies, the <b>Ganges</b> river <b>dolphin</b> (P. g. gangetica) and the Indus river dolphin (P. g. minor). The <b>Ganges</b> river <b>dolphin</b> is primarily found in the Ganges and Brahmaputra Rivers and their tributaries in Bangladesh, India and Nepal, while the Indus river dolphin {{is found in the}} Indus River in Pakistan and its Beas and Sutlej tributaries. From the 1970s until 1998, they were regarded as separate species; however, in 1998, their classification was changed from two separate species to subspecies of a single species (see taxonomy below). The <b>Ganges</b> river <b>dolphin</b> has been recognized by the government of India as its National Aquatic Animal. The Indus river dolphin has been named as the National Mammal of Pakistan. Further, the <b>Ganges</b> river <b>dolphin</b> is the official animal of the Indian city of Guwahati.|$|R

40|$|Despite their {{endangered}} status, the taxonomic {{relationship between}} the two geographically isolated South Asian river dolphin populations has never been comprehensively assessed and remains contentious. Here we present the first dedicated evaluation of the molecular phylogenetic {{relationship between the}} Indus (Platanista gangetica minor) and Ganges (Platanista gangetica gangetica) River dolphins using mitochondrial DNA from the control region and cytochrome b, extracted from museum specimens. The 458 bp partial control region sequences from 26 Indus River dolphin samples exhibited no variation. Only six haplotypes were identified in the 31 (18 Indus; 13 Ganges) complete (856 bp) control region sequences obtained, none were shared between subspecies, and there were five fixed differences between them. Similarly low genetic diversity was found in a 541 bp section of the cytochrome b gene (n = 29). The lack of shared haplotypes and fixed differences resulted in ΦST for the partial control region sequences of 0. 932 (p < 0. 0001) and FST of 0. 843 (p < 0. 0001), indicating the long-term absence of gene flow and clear genetic differentiation between the two geographically isolated populations. An externally calibrated molecular clock estimated that Indus and <b>Ganges</b> <b>dolphins</b> diverged around 550, 000 years ago (95 % posterior probability 0. 13 - 1. 05 million years ago), possibly when dolphins from the Ganges dispersed into the Indus during drainage capture. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York...|$|E

40|$|Recording of the {{underwater}} call and {{observation of the}} relative behaviour of the river dolphin (Platanista gangetica) living in the Indus River were carried out. All of {{the underwater}} calls emitted by this dolphin were clicks which were continuously emitted. This call was mainly used for echolocation and, when small fishes were thrown into the pond, {{it was observed that}} the repetition rate of clicks emitted by the dolphin searching for bait rapidly became higher. The repetition rate was 30 - 200 /sec. (usually 40 - 100 /sec.) The analyzed patterns were monotonous and the particularly strong frequency band was not constant. The clicks emitted by the Indus River Dolphin were very similar to the call of the dolphin living in the Ganges River, but the stratiformed sound, burst, twitter and whistle which the <b>Ganges</b> River <b>Dolphin</b> emitted were not observed with the Indus River Dolphin. !? 1. The underwater calls of the Indus River Dolphin were recorded in Pakistan were compared with that of the <b>Ganges</b> River <b>Dolphin</b> of the same species. 2.
