40|$|This diploma {{thesis is}} aimed at the {{evaluation}} of water treatment technology in Písty waterworks which treats raw water with high concentration of iron and manganese. The most common method of iron and manganese removal from raw water is based on oxidation to insoluble hydrated oxides followed by separation of formed aggregates. The plant technology consists of aeration, oxidation agent KMnO 4 dosing and mixing, sedimentation, filtration and hygienic protection. Chemical analysis of treated water, evaluation of the aeration efficiency of iron and manganese oxidation, evaluation of the separation efficiency of the sedimentation tank and filters, assessment of distribution of iron and manganese in the filter, assessment of <b>dirt</b> <b>holding</b> <b>capacity</b> and optimization of KMnO 4 dose were determined. Raw water pH fluctuated around 7, 3 during measurements, whereas iron and manganese concentrations in raw water were 6, 00 and 0, 82 mg. l- 1, respectively. Oxidation of 97, 2 % of dissolved iron and of 14, 3 % of dissolved manganese was achieved after the aeration. The separation efficiency of the sedimentation tank was 82, 9 % for iron and 46, 5 % for manganese, however the separation efficiency {{of the second half}} of the sedimentation tank was low. Thus, the perforated baffles in {{the second half of the}} sedimentation [...] ...|$|E

The objective {{of this research was}} to assess the contribution of soils information to the prediction accuracy of a large area crop yield prediction model. The available water <b>holding</b> <b>capacity,</b> defined as the soil water held between 0. 3 and 15 bars tension, was used as the major component to study the interaction of soil water <b>holding</b> <b>capacity</b> and weather variability. ^ The available soil water <b>holding</b> <b>capacity</b> was estimated from soil texture for 902 soil profiles representative of Indiana soils. A multivariate cluster analysis of the available soil water <b>holding</b> <b>capacity</b> in ten 15 -cm layers was used to classify the soil profiles in 4, 8, and 12 cluster classes. These cluster classes, which represent three levels of aggregation of available soil water <b>holding</b> <b>capacity,</b> were compared to each other in terms of available water <b>holding</b> <b>capacity,</b> areal extent in the nine Indiana crop reporting districts, and their contributions to improving the accuracy of a large area soybean yield prediction model. ^ These analyses indicate: (1) distinctly different available soil water <b>holding</b> <b>capacity</b> groups can be distinguished in a population of soils with a wide range, (2) most of the soybean area in a crop reporting district can be represented by five soil water <b>holding</b> <b>capacity</b> groups, although these groups vary from one district to another, (3) the soybean yield prediction model weather indices are not sensitive to the water <b>holding</b> <b>capacity</b> differences between all of the soil water <b>holding</b> <b>capacity</b> groups at all levels of aggregation, but important differences between poorly and well and high and low water <b>holding</b> <b>capacity</b> soils do exist. ...|$|R
30|$|While many {{articles}} {{report on}} carbon sequestration potential and nutrient trapping, {{there have been}} only a few studies on the effect of biochar on water <b>holding</b> <b>capacity.</b> Novak et al. [14] reported an increase in the water <b>holding</b> <b>capacity</b> of a loamy sand soil with 2 % mixtures of biochar made from various switchgrass feedstocks. They were interested in understanding the different effects of temperature and feedstock on the water <b>holding</b> <b>capacity</b> of biochar but all values were calculated at a 2 % mixture rate only. By varying retort temperature from 250 °C to 750 °C, increases in water <b>holding</b> <b>capacity</b> ranging from 7 % to 16 % were observed. Another finding was an 11 % increase in water <b>holding</b> <b>capacity</b> reported as an additional observation and was not validated through the use of control techniques [15]. The ability of biochar to increase water <b>holding</b> <b>capacity</b> could have profound effects on areas prone to drought [15]. Sohi et al. [12] summarized the current state of biochar knowledge and concluded that soil water <b>holding</b> <b>capacity</b> was an area of significance that was lacking in research.|$|R
30|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to study how different biochar mixture rates affect the water <b>holding</b> <b>capacity</b> of biochar-amended loamy sand soil.

30|$|While {{previous}} {{research suggests that}} biochar is well suited for increasing the water <b>holding</b> <b>capacity</b> of soils, {{there have been few}} quantitative studies on the effect of biochar on water <b>holding</b> <b>capacity.</b> This research found that the biochar used in this study increases water <b>holding</b> <b>capacity</b> of a loamy sand soil by around 1.7 % by mass for each 1 % of added biochar over the agriculturally relevant range up to 10 % biochar concentrations. These lower end mixture values are representative of the allowable amounts of biochar that can be added without causing damage to plants. Water <b>holding</b> <b>capacity</b> of unamended sandy loam soil, 16 %, is doubled by the addition of 9 % by mass of biochar. This finding is important because it establishes biochar as an effective medium for increasing irrigation effectiveness, runoff mitigation, and reducing non-point source agricultural pollution.|$|R

30|$|With {{the rise}} in global {{population}} and increased agricultural requirements comes an increasing need for freshwater. Currently, {{it is estimated that}} approximately 75 % of fresh water consumption is for the growth of agricultural crops, and only 10 % to 30 % of this water is actually made available to plants. It is widely accepted that farming practices which rely heavily on chemical fertilizers and unsustainable land management practices have led in many regions to infertile sandy soils with reduced water <b>holding</b> <b>capacity</b> and insufficient amounts of organic matter. Combined with increasing global population, the need to better manage fresh water use, particularly agricultural usage, is paramount. The use of biochar as a soil amendment has been suggested as a way to increase water <b>holding</b> <b>capacity,</b> but only limited quantitative studies exist in terms of the effectiveness of biochar in increasing a soil's water <b>holding</b> <b>capacity.</b> The main {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the effect of woody biochar amendment (yellow pine from pyrolysis at 400 °C) on the water <b>holding</b> <b>capacity</b> of loamy sand soil with different mixture rates. Results show a doubling in water <b>holding</b> <b>capacity</b> by mass using a 9 % mixture of biochar (equivalent to 195 metric ton/ha), which is an agriculturally relevant concentration. High percentage mixtures of biochar increase water <b>holding</b> <b>capacity</b> dramatically. These results suggest the use of biochar has potential to mitigate drought and increase crop yields in loamy sand soil.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In arid and {{semi-arid}} regions, efficient {{utilization of}} available water necessitates {{the adaptation of}} appropriate water management practices. One such approach is through soil conditioners. Soil conditioners {{have been reported to}} be effective tools in increasing water <b>holding</b> <b>capacity,</b> reducing infiltration rate and cumulative evaporation and improving water conservation of sandy soils. In view of the characteristics of the hydro gel polymers and peculiar problems of rainfed areas, laboratory studies were carried out to observe the absorption of water by six polymers (P 1, P 2, P 3, P 4, P 5 and P 6) to investigate the effect of its application on water absorption rate and soil moisture <b>holding</b> <b>capacity</b> of loamy sand soil. Maximum rate of water absorption of polymers (P 1, P 2, P 3, P 4, P 5 and P 6) were (169. 3, 114, 181. 1, 154. 2, 311. 5 and 155. 8 times their weight respectively).

40|$|Extreme {{hurricane}} {{events of}} the past decade are responsible for several drag embedment anchor (DEA) mooring failures of mobile offshore drilling platforms stationed within the Gulf of Mexico. A proposed failure mechanism is caused by out-of-plane loading. The current status of DEA <b>holding</b> <b>capacity</b> is based on empirical design charts and does not include the effects of out-of-plane loading. Experimental modeling using a 1 : 10 scale generic DEA was performed at the Haynes Coastal Engineering Laboratory at Texas A & M University {{to examine the effects of}} out-of-plane load conditions. Instrumentation and specialized devices were constructed to measure the anchor's trajectory through a representative sample of Gulf of Mexico clay with average un-drained shear strength of 0. 764 kPa (16 psf). The sediment basin allowed for drag distances of 4. 87 m (16 ft) and an embedment depth of 1. 37 m (4. 5 ft). The measurements included pitch and roll of the anchor and line tension measured at the shank pad-eye. The variables modeled were fluke angle settings of 22 ?, 36 ? and 50 ?. The initial towline angle was varied from a minimum of 5 ? to upwards of 20 ?. Surface out-of-plane angles of 45 ? and 90 ? and embedment loading of 15 ?, 30 ? and 45 ? were examined. Curves of the ultimate <b>holding</b> <b>capacity</b> with respect to the out-of-plane towline angle and ultimate embedment depth were developed as functions of out-of-plane loading angles. Analysis of the rate effect indicates that a 46 percent increase in towing velocity causes an average 3 percent increase of <b>holding</b> <b>capacity.</b> The 50 ? fluke angle embeds an average of 0. 7 fluke lengths deeper and has a <b>holding</b> <b>capacity</b> of 0. 73 units greater than the 36 ? setting.
