5|$|The {{stability}} of the IPK is crucial because the kilogram underpins much of the SI system of measurement as it is currently defined and structured. For instance, the newton <b>is</b> <b>defined</b> as the force necessary to accelerate one kilogram at one metre per second squared. If {{the mass of the}} IPK were to change slightly, so too must the newton by a proportional degree. In turn, the pascal, the SI unit of pressure, <b>is</b> <b>defined</b> in terms of the newton. This chain of dependency follows to many other SI units of measure. For instance, the joule, the SI unit of energy, <b>is</b> <b>defined</b> as that expended when a force of one newton acts through one metre. Next to be affected is the SI unit of power, the watt, which is one joule per second. The ampere too <b>is</b> <b>defined</b> relative to the newton, and ultimately, the kilogram.|$|E
5|$|A same-document {{reference}} is a URI {{reference to a}} document containing the URI reference itself. A URI reference <b>is</b> <b>defined</b> as a same-document reference if, when resolved to absolute form, it equates exactly to the base URI in effect for the reference. When encountering a same-document reference, document processing software, for example a web browser, to efficiently use its current representation of a document to satisfy the resolution of a reference to that document without fetching a new representation. URI equivalence <b>is</b> <b>defined</b> as when a URI reference, while not identical to the base URI, still represents the same resource.|$|E

5|$|An {{electric}} field generally varies in space, and its strength {{at any one}} point <b>is</b> <b>defined</b> as the force (per unit charge) that would be felt by a stationary, negligible charge if placed at that point. The conceptual charge, termed a 'test charge', must be vanishingly small to prevent its own {{electric field}} disturbing the main field and must also be stationary to prevent the effect of magnetic fields. As the electric field <b>is</b> <b>defined</b> in terms of force, and force is a vector, so it follows that an electric field is also a vector, having both magnitude and direction. Specifically, it is a vector field.|$|E
