5|$|The {{story begins}} {{on a cold}} and bleak Christmas Eve in London, seven years {{after the death of}} Ebenezer Scrooge's {{business}} partner, Jacob Marley. Scrooge, an old miser, hates Christmas and refuses an invitation to Christmas dinner from his nephew Fred. <b>He</b> <b>turns</b> <b>away</b> two men who seek a donation from him in order to provide food and heating for the poor, and only grudgingly allows his overworked, underpaid clerk, Bob Cratchit, Christmas Day off with pay to conform to the social custom.|$|E
500|$|Miyamoto's guiding design {{philosophy}} was {{to include more}} details than earlier games, now utilizing the Nintendo 64's power to feature [...] "all the emotions of the characters". He likened the game's style to a 3D interactive cartoon. Some details were inspired by the developers' personal lives; for example, the Boos are based on assistant director Takashi Tezuka's wife, who, as Miyamoto explained, [...] "is very quiet normally, but one day she exploded, maddened by all the time Tezuka spent at work." [...] In the game, the Boos shrink when Mario looks at them, but when <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> <b>away,</b> they grow large and menacing.|$|E
500|$|... "Indian Camp" [...] is an {{initiation}} story. Nick's father (Dr. Adams) exposes {{his young}} son to [...] childbirth and, unintentionally, to violent death—an experience that causes Nick to equate childbirth with death. Hemingway critic Wendolyn Tetlow maintains that in [...] "Indian Camp", sexuality culminates in [...] "butchery-style" [...] birth and bloody death, and that Nick's anxiety is obvious when <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> <b>away</b> from the butchery. The story reaches a climax when Nick's [...] "heightened awareness" [...] of evil causes him {{to turn away from}} the experience. Although Nick may not want to watch the caesarian, his father insists he watch - he does not want his son to be initiated into an adult world without toughness, writes Thomas Strychacz.|$|E

500|$|A {{few months}} after {{completing}} his Memoirs, on New Year's Eve in 1851, Makriyannis started to write another [...] "history", as he called it, which he interrupted rather abruptly in late March 1852, when he was under house arrest. This text was acquired in 1936 or 1937 by Vlahogiannis, and was finally published in 1983 by Angelos Papakostas, aptly titled Visions and Wonders. It has, according to Papakostas, far less historical significance than the Memoirs. The events described therein are given briefly, and are used only {{as an excuse for}} his meditations and the interpretation of his Visions, on which he particularly insists. Vlahogiannis, according to Sphyroeras, considered the manuscript to be an overzealous work of a deranged mind, and that is the reason he did not publish it. The work, however, is also the product of a physically and mentally tormented soul, who, being isolated at the age of 54, instead converses with God, the Panagia, and the saints. It also shows Makriyannis's deep religious feeling; <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> <b>away</b> from guns, instead seeking the nation's salvation through divine intervention. Furthermore, as Sphyroeras points out, the work is unique in Modern Greek literature in its subject matter, and is, as the Memoirs, a significant source of linguistic and cultural information.|$|E
60|$|CHARTERIS (recoiling). Who {{told you}} that? (She {{shakes her head}} mysteriously, and <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> <b>away</b> from her moodily and adds) You had much better not have asked.|$|E
6000|$|CAESAR. You teach men {{how to be}} kings, Theodotus. That is {{very clever}} of you. (Looking at the gods on the walls as <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> <b>away</b> from Theodotus and goes up again to Pothinus.) And this place? ...|$|E
60|$|Prince Shan's gesture as <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>away</b> was one {{of supreme}} contempt.|$|R
60|$|Several people {{approached}} Trent, but <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>away</b> {{at once to}} Ernestine.|$|R
60|$|Affecting {{an air of}} unconcern <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>away</b> and bade {{his comrades}} follow.|$|R
6000|$|PARAMORE (gravely). Excuse me; but my self-respect is dearer to me {{even than}} Miss Craven. I cannot trifle with {{scientific}} {{questions for the}} sake of a personal advantage. (<b>He</b> <b>turns</b> <b>away</b> coldly and goes toward the table.) ...|$|E
6000|$|MAN (with a comic {{gesture of}} despair). It's no use, dear lady: I can't make {{you see it}} from the {{professional}} point of view. (As <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> <b>away</b> {{to get back to}} the ottoman, the firing begins again in the distance.) ...|$|E
60|$|SOLDIER. It's no use, mate. I can't do it. I said I'd laugh to-day, {{and laugh}} I will. I've come through that, an' all {{the stink of}} it; I've come through sorrer. Never again! Cheerio, mate! The sun's a-shinin'! <b>He</b> <b>turns</b> <b>away.</b>|$|E

6000|$|... "Afore {{he could}} think o" [...] {{anything}} else to say, Joe ups with his fist an’ gives ’im one in the ribs as nearly broke ’em. Then <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> <b>away</b> ’is ’ead an’ shivers again, an’ the old dazed look come back.|$|E
6000|$|CRAVEN. Then I'm {{sorry for}} your manners, Charteris: that's all. (<b>He</b> <b>turns</b> <b>away</b> sulkily; then {{suddenly}} fires up {{and turns on}} Charteris.) How dare you tell me my daughter wants to marry you. Who are you, pray, {{that she should have}} any such ambition? ...|$|E
6000|$|PATTY. I {{think she}} was feared you would offer to her out of pity. She said {{something}} to Miss Susan about keeping a flag flying. What she meant I know not. (But he knows, and <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> <b>away</b> his face.) Are you laughing, sir? ...|$|E

60|$|<b>He</b> <b>turns</b> <b>away</b> {{and stands}} for a while {{looking out at the}} covered passage. When he comes back, he has {{recovered}} his composure, except that he contends against an avoidance of the boy, which is so very remarkable that it absorbs the woman's attention.|$|E
6000|$|Caesar (patting Ptolemy kindly on the shoulder). So {{you are the}} King. Dull work at your age, eh? (To Pothinus) your servant, Pothinus. (<b>He</b> <b>turns</b> <b>away</b> unconcernedly {{and comes}} slowly along {{the middle of the}} hall, looking from side to side at the courtiers until he reaches Achillas.) And this gentleman? ...|$|E
60|$|The good stage lawyer also wipes away a tear when sad things happen; and <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> <b>away</b> to do {{this and}} blows his nose, and says he thinks he has a fly in his eye. This {{touching}} trait in his character is always held in great esteem by the audience and is much applauded.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>turned</b> <b>away,</b> {{and tried}} the Lock-house door. It was {{fastened}} on the inside.|$|R

6000|$|LADY K.--He won't listen! <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> <b>away</b> {{and kisses}} her horrible hand. This will never do: help me up, Clarence, I must go and fetch his mother.

I'll see if the man is still there with the carriage. (He walks to the door on left and goes out.) ...|$|E
