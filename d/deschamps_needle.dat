40|$|OBJECTIVE: Trocar-site incisional hernias {{and their}} {{complications}} {{are reported in}} 1 % to 6 % of patients. Such hernias are attributed {{to the difficulty of}} applying standard suturing techniques to wound closure. We report our experience with a simple device, the Deschamps ligature needle. METHODS: The <b>Deschamps</b> <b>needle</b> has a handle and a tip (sharp or blunt), with an opening to pass suture. The blunt tip is very effective for closing trocar sites. Disposable needles are obviously sharp, but can bend on the needle holder and break in a deep small incision. The <b>Deschamps</b> <b>needle</b> is a rigid, noncutting instrument that can be forced through fascia and peritoneum (around the surgeon's fingertip) avoiding loss of pneumoperitoneum. A full-thickness closure is accomplished. We perform closure under direct vision through the scope. Tactile sense is provided by the surgeon's finger. The last trocar site is closed in the same manner without the scope. RESULTS: We have used the <b>Deschamps</b> <b>needle</b> since 1992 in all (1400) laparoscopic procedures. We close 10 -mm and 5 -mm trocar sites and have not observed wound dehiscence or hernias at these sites. CONCLUSION: The <b>Deschamps</b> <b>needle</b> is effective in preventing incisional hernias and wound dehiscence. It is cost-effective. Disposable, single-use devices vary in price from $ 30 to $ 75 each. The <b>Deschamps</b> <b>needle</b> is sold in Italy at approximately $ 35 each. Considering that it may have been in the trays of most operating rooms for years (as in our case), and the number of procedures performed, we conclude that the real cost of this instrument is almost negligible...|$|E
40|$|Laparoscopic transabdominal cervicoisthmic {{cerclage}} (LTCC) is an alternative, less-morbid {{option to}} the traditional transabdominal cerclage, indicated for patients with cervical incompetence. Experience with the technique is based on case reports and a few case series. Considering LTCC for twin gestations, reports are very scarce and are derived from LTCC performed during pregnancy. We report {{the case of a}} 36 -year-old patient, gravida 1, para 0, aborta 1, who underwent interval LTCC after a previous failed transvaginal emergency cerclage performed in the second trimester. Hysteroscopic metroplasty was concomitantly performed for an incomplete septate uterus. the procedure lasted 100 minutes, with an estimated blood loss of 50 mL. the patient was discharged home on the second postoperative day. the patient became pregnant with twins 3 months after the procedure after undergoing in vitro fertilization. the gestational course was uneventful, and the patient delivered 2 healthy neonates at 38 weeks gestation by elective cesarean section. the cerclage tape was left in situ. Minor modifications of the previously reported techniques included use of a laparoscopic <b>Deschamps</b> <b>needle</b> for placing the cotton cardiac tape used as suture material. Vessels in the cervical transverse cervical ligament were exposed before cerclage tape application. To our knowledge, this is the first report of interval LTCC preceding a twin gestation.
