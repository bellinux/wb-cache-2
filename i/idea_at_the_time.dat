5|$|Throughout the 1790s Dennie {{contributed to}} various journals, {{including}} the Federal Orrery and the Massachusetts Magazine, often using pen {{names such as}} Academicus and Socialis. In 1795, his writing being enthusiastically received, Dennie was persuaded to begin a literary journal, The Tablet. William Spotswood, a Boston printer and bookseller, agreed to oversee the entire enterprise, splitting the profits evenly with Dennie. Such a literary journal was a novel <b>idea</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> and it was well received among the city's elite. Despite the initial excitement surrounding the project and content from noted writers such as John Sylvester John Gardiner, The Tablet lasted {{only a few months}} before folding, having published thirteen issues.|$|E
5|$|Australia having {{declared}} war on 3September 1939, the RAAF Air Board met in November to discuss Mary Bell's letter, but postponed taking any further action. Bell continued to lobby, as did various women's groups seeking to support the war effort and free male staff for overseas postings. In July 1940, the new Chief of the Air Staff, Air Chief Marshal Sir Charles Burnett, invited her to produce {{a proposal for a}} women's auxiliary, supervised by her husband John, who had rejoined the Air Force at the war's outbreak and was now a wing commander in the Directorate of Organisation at RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne. Mary recommended forming the new service under the Air Force Act to permit women to enlist {{for the duration of the}} war under conditions similar to RAAF members, rather than enrolling on a short-term contractual basis, a radical <b>idea</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> which would not be put in place until 1943. She also suggested a volunteer reserve or 'citizen' force to augment the enlisted women, effectively the existing WATC, though this was seen as placing too much emphasis on her personal command. Various senior Air Force officers, including the recently promoted Air Marshal Williams, and the Director of Personnel Services, Group Captain Joe Hewitt, opposed a women's service. Burnett, an RAF member who appreciated how the WAAF proved its worth during the Battle of Britain, championed its establishment as the Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force (WAAAF).|$|E
5|$|Louis Pasteur {{was unable}} to find a causative agent for rabies and speculated about a {{pathogen}} too small to be detected using a microscope. In 1884, the French microbiologist Charles Chamberland invented a filter (known today as the Chamberland filter or the Pasteur-Chamberland filter) with pores smaller than bacteria. Thus, he could pass a solution containing bacteria through the filter and completely remove them from the solution. In 1892, the Russian biologist Dmitri Ivanovsky used this filter to study what is now known as the tobacco mosaic virus. His experiments showed that crushed leaf extracts from infected tobacco plants remain infectious after filtration. Ivanovsky suggested the infection might be caused by a toxin produced by bacteria, but did not pursue the <b>idea.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> it was thought that all infectious agents could be retained by filters and grown on a nutrient medium– this was part of the germ theory of disease. In 1898, the Dutch microbiologist Martinus Beijerinck repeated the experiments and became convinced that the filtered solution contained a new form of infectious agent. He observed that the agent multiplied only in cells that were dividing, but as his experiments did not show that it was made of particles, he called it a contagium vivum fluidum (soluble living germ) and re-introduced the word virus. Beijerinck maintained that viruses were liquid in nature, a theory later discredited by Wendell Stanley, who proved they were particulate. In the same year Friedrich Loeffler and Paul Frosch passed the first animal virus– agent of foot-and-mouth disease (aphthovirus)– through a similar filter.|$|E

25|$|Tartikoff {{felt there}} had been strong {{elements}} to Good Morning, Miss Bliss and wanted to try the show again with a different time slot and a different approach. The elements featuring the kids had been well-received, so Tartikoff wanted to drop Miss Bliss from the show altogether and focus entirely on the teens.

Though the reformers were concerned with ecclesiology (the doctrine of how {{the church as a}} body works), they had a different understanding of the process in which truths in scripture were applied to life of believers, compared to the Catholics' idea that certain people within the church, or ideas that were old enough, had a special status in giving understanding of the text.|$|E

25|$|During McQueen's {{first three}} years at P.L.C, he made only minor changes to {{existing}} policies and routines, preferring to do as Marden had before him. It is said {{that at this time}} he may have even been more conservative than Marden, for example, in 1921, he recommended to College Council that no Roman Catholic should be appointed to the staff, whereas Marden had appointed Roman Catholics. McQueen did however campaign for playing fields and a swimming pool at the school, believing that sport should {{play an important role in}} the education of young ladies, a somewhat unorthodox <b>idea</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> His other change in these early years was to allow the pupils a greater say in the election of the School Captain and Prefects.|$|E
25|$|As governor, Gayoso de Lemos {{consolidated}} {{the military}} power of Spain in New Orleans, still fearing a possible thrust south by Britain and desiring to keep Spanish Louisiana a buffer between the U.S. (with its territory now extending to Natchez) and Spanish Texas. He was pragmatic and continued the unofficial policy of allowing Americans {{to bring their}} slaves with them from the north, although the importation of new slaves had been prohibited since 1792. However, he was dogmatic {{in other areas of}} government; in 1798, he issued a comprehensive edict concerning Catholicism as the state faith of the colony. In addition to increasing formal church membership, it attempted to coerce people to give up unnecessarily working on Sundays and holy days. In the edict Gayoso de Lemos condemned anyone who challenged the theology or social centrality of the Church. In 1798 he also instituted state-run garbage collection (a novel <b>idea</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time),</b> {{to prevent the spread of}} diseases and bad smells in the city.|$|E
25|$|New Regent Street is a {{pedestrian}} mall in Christchurch. Built {{as a private}} development in the early 1930s with 40 shops in Spanish Mission architectural style, {{it is one of}} the city's major tourist attractions. Providing a number of small shops as a comprehensive development was an advanced <b>idea</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> and New Regent Street is regarded as a forerunner to modern shopping malls. Due to its coherent architectural character, the buildings in the streets are listed as Category I heritage items by Heritage New Zealand, and in addition, the entire street has a historic area listing. The street was pedestrianised in 1994 in preparation for the introduction of the , which began operation in February 1995. Damaged in the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake, the street and buildings reopened in April 2013, and the tram returned from November of that year. Following the 2016 Valentine's Day earthquake, five of the buildings that had not been repaired after the previous earthquakes have been cordoned off, which stopped the tram from operating on its original heritage loop until May.|$|E

2500|$|On such grounds, Ralea {{concluded}} that Romanian writers [...] "have had no deep spiritual experience", lacking [...] "a comprehension of humanity, {{of life and}} death." [...] In a notorious socio-critical essay, first published in Perspective, Ralea asked: [...] "Why Did We Not Produce a Novel?". He contended that the grand epic genre, unlike the short story, did not yet suit the Romanian psyche, since it required discipline, anonymity, and a [...] "great moral significance". He also postulated a deterministic relationship between the staples of ancestral Romanian folklore and modern literary choices: {{in the absence of}} any ambitious poetic cycles (as found in Western literature), Romanian ballads and doine had naturally mutated into novellas. In order to mend such a historical disadvantage, he set himself the goal of writing his own novel, but eventually gave up on the <b>idea.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> of its writing, the essay claimed to count only a few living novelists; by 1935, however, there was already talk of an [...] "inflation of novels".|$|E

[...] This was a radical <b>idea</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> because experts believed the impulsive spark was necessary to produce radio frequency waves, and Fessenden was ridiculed. [...] He invented and helped develop one of the first continuous wave transmitters - the Alexanderson alternator, with which he made what is considered the first AM public entertainment broadcast on Christmas Eve, 1906. [...] He also discovered the principle on which AM is based, heterodyning, and invented one of the first detectors able to rectify and receive AM, the electrolytic detector or [...] "liquid baretter", in 1902. [...] Other radio detectors invented for wireless telegraphy, such as the Fleming valve (1904) and the crystal detector (1906) also proved able to rectify AM signals, so the technological hurdle was generating AM waves; receiving them was not a problem.|$|E
2500|$|Goodall is {{best known}} for her study of {{chimpanzee}} social and family life. She began studying the Kasakela chimpanzee community in Gombe Stream National Park, Tanzania, in 1960. Without collegiate training directing her research, Goodall observed things that strict scientific doctrines may have overlooked. Instead of numbering the chimpanzees she observed, she gave them names such as Fifi and David Greybeard, and observed them to have unique and individual personalities, an unconventional <b>idea</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> She found that, [...] "it isn't only human beings who have personality, who are capable of rational thought [...] emotions like joy and sorrow." [...] She also observed behaviours such as hugs, kisses, pats on the back, and even tickling, what we consider [...] "human" [...] actions. Goodall insists that these gestures are evidence of [...] "the close, supportive, affectionate bonds that develop between family members and other individuals within a community, which can persist throughout a life span of more than 50 years." [...] These findings suggest that similarities between humans and chimpanzees exist in more than genes alone, but can be seen in emotion, intelligence, and family and social relationships.|$|E
