40|$|Abstract Background Meat quality {{traits are}} {{important}} in pig breeding programs, but they are difficult to include in a traditional selection program. Marker assisted selection (MAS) of meat quality traits is therefore of interest in breeding programs and a Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) analysis {{is the key to}} identifying markers {{that can be used in}} MAS. In this study, Landrace and Hampshire intercross and backcross families were used to investigate meat quality traits. <b>Hampshire</b> <b>pigs</b> are commonly used as the sire line in commercial pig breeding. This is the first time a pedigree including <b>Hampshire</b> <b>pigs</b> has been used for a QTL analysis of meat quality traits. Results In total, we analyzed 39 meat quality traits and identified eight genome-wide significant QTL peaks in four regions: one on chromosome 3, two on chromosome 6 and one on chromosome 16. At least two of the QTLs do not appear to have been detected in previous studies. On chromosome 6 we identified QTLs for water content in M. longissimus dorsi (LD), drip loss in LD and post mortem pH decline in LD. On chromosomes 3 and 16 we identified previously undetected QTLs for protein content in LD and for freezing and cooking loss respectively. Conclusion We identified at least two new meat quality trait QTLs at the genome-wide significance level. We detected two QTLs on chromosome 6 that possibly coincide with QTLs detected in other studies. We were also able to exclude the C 1843 T mutation in the ryanodine receptor (RYR 1) as a causative mutation for one of the chromosome 6 QTLs in this cross. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} feeding diets {{containing}} no fat, 3 % hydrogenated coconut oil (HCO) or graded levels (0. 1, 0. 5, 1. 0 or 3 %) of safflower oil (SO) on serum cholesterol, lipids and protein level; on total heart and liver cholesterol and lipid level and on growth rate and skin condition were studied in weanling Yorkshire and Yorkshire x <b>Hampshire</b> <b>pigs.</b> Pigs fed the fat-free diet for 21 weeks developed severe skin lesions not observed in pigs fed HCO diets. Highly significant elevation of serum, liver and heart lipid and liver cholesterol, {{and a highly}} significant depression of total serum protein were observed with the feeding of HCO or fat-free diets. Serum cholestrol was significantly increased by HCO {{as compared with the}} fat-free diet or diets containing SO during the repletion period. Total heart cholesterol, growth rate and erythrocyte fragility were unaffected by diets. It is concluded that growth rate is not adversely affected in the pig by fat-free diets and that HCO does not produce skin lesions in the pig characteristic of fatty acid deficiency. Of all the correlation coefficients analyzed, only the serum cholesterol and total serum lipids were consistently highly significantly correlated, while serum protein was significantly inversely related to the total liver lipid...|$|R
40|$|A {{new type}} of soyabean, AC Proteus, {{containing}} higher protein than conventional cultivars was evaluated using Landrace x <b>Hampshire</b> <b>pigs,</b> weighing about 10 kg. In the first trial, AC Proteus was included at 0, 4, 8, 12, 16 or 20 % of the isonitrogenous and isoenergetic soyabean meal-based diets and fed to 96 pigs until their average liveweight exceeded 21 kg. In the second trial with 108 pigs, AC Proteus was included at 0, 3. 5, 7, 10. 5 or 14 % of the diet, and a conventional soyabean, Baron, was included at 0, 4. 4, 8. 8, 13. 3 or 17. 7 % of the diet on an isoenergetic and isonitrogenous basis until they reached 25 kg. Amino acid concentrations in AC Proteus on an air-dry basis were higher {{than those in the}} Baron soyabean. In the first trial, inclusion of AC Proteus at higher levels appeared to decrease feed intake and rate of gain, although this appeared to be due to lower levels of amino acids in the diets and overheating of the roasted soyabean. In the second trial, inclusion of either type of soyabean had no effect on feed intake, rate of gain or feed conversion efficiency. At higher levels of inclusion of AC Proteus, feed intake was reduced slightly. AC Proteus appears to be an excellent source of protein and energy in starter pig diets and gives equivalent growth responses compared with soyabean meal or conventional soyabean. ...|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveMany {{surgeons}} {{consider the}} tricuspid valve to be a second-class structure. Our {{objective was to}} determine the normal anatomy and dynamic characteristics of the tricuspid valve apparatus in vivo and to discern whether this would aid the design of a tricuspid valve annuloplasty ring model. MethodsSixteen sonomicrometry crystals were placed around the tricuspid annulus, at the bases and tips of the papillary muscles, the free edges of the leaflets, and the right ventricular apex during cardiopulmonary bypass in 5 anesthetized York <b>Hampshire</b> <b>pigs.</b> Animals were studied after weaning of cardiopulmonary bypass on 10 cardiac cycles of normal hemodynamics. ResultsSonomicrometry array localizations demonstrate the multiplanar shape of the tricuspid annulus. The tricuspid annulus reaches its maximum area (97. 9  ± 25. 4 mm 2) at the end of diastole and its minimum area (77. 3  ± 22. 5 mm 2) at the end of systole, and increases again in early diastole. Papillary muscles shorten by 0. 8 to 1. 5 mm (11. 2 %) in systole, and chordae tendineae straighten by 0. 8 to 1. 7 mm (11. 4 %) in systole. ConclusionsThe shape of the tricuspid annulus is a multiplanar 3 -dimensional one with its highest point at the anteroseptal commissure and its lowest point at the posteroseptal commissure, and the anteroposterior commissure is in a middle plane in between. The tricuspid annulus area reaches its maximum during diastole and its minimum during systole. The papillary muscles contract by the same amount of chordal straightening. The optimal tricuspid annuloplasty ring may be a multiplanar 3 -dimensional one that mimics the normal tricuspid annulus...|$|R
40|$|Domestic pigs {{have become}} very {{different}} form the wild ancestors they originate from. Selection for muscle growth and meat quality has made the pig a good model for genetic studies of muscle development. The {{first part of this}} thesis presents a genome-wide scan for quantitative trait loci (QTL) in a cross between Landrace and <b>Hampshire</b> <b>pigs.</b> Traits such as body composition, fat deposition, body length, meat quality and weight measurements of individual muscles were investigated. In total we identified 15 different QTLs that reached genome-wide significance. The three most significant QTLs were for carcass length on chromosome 17 and two overlapping QTLs on chromosome 1 for body composition and weight of M. biceps femoris, respectively. A strong candidate gene for the body composition QTL is melanocortin 4 receptor (MC 4 R). We also identified several QTLs for sizes of different muscles, fat deposition and meat quality traits. In a previous study using a cross between the domestic Large White and wild boar, the mutation underlying a major QTL for muscle growth and fat deposition was identified as a single nucleotide substitution (QTN) in intron 3 of the IGF 2 gene. The QTN disrupts the binding of a repressor affecting IGF 2 mRNA expression. In the second part of this thesis, the identification of the repressor is presented. The repressor, named ZBED 6, is a previously unknown mammalian member of the BED-domain protein family. We could show that Zbed 6 specifically binds the wild-type but not the mutated sequence surrounding the QTN. Further studies of silenced Zbed 6 in the mouse myoblast cell line C 2 C 12 showed that it represses transcription in a luciferase reporter assay and affects Igf 2 mRNA transcription and proliferation. ZBED 6 shows very high sequence conservation and has a broad tissue distribution of expression suggesting that ZBED 6 also has important biological function outside the muscle cell...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the present thesis was to obtain more fundamental understanding of the mechanisms for variations in colour and colour stability of fresh pork. The effects of breed and genotype, including Duroc, Hampshire (three RN alleles), Landrace and Yorkshire pigs, were studied. Furthermore, effects of strategic feeding with creatine, pre-slaughter treatment, slaughter procedure and carcass cooling on muscle metabolism and ultimate colour and colour stability were studied. It was concluded that the early progress in post mortem temperature and pH decline affect the colour of pork independent of whether this is triggered by variations in genotype, feed-induced changes, pre-slaughter stress or cooling rate. The level of oxymyoglobin was shown {{to be more important}} for the colour of pork during retail display, than the level of metmyoglobin. A high level of oxymyoglobin preserves high redness despite of oxidation to metmyoglobin. Ageing of pork for a week increased the ability of pork to stimulate oxygenation of deoxymyoglobin to oxymyoglobin, i. e. blooming, without compromising the colour stability during four days of subsequent retail display. Hence, ageing results in lighter, redder and more yellow pork colour. It was further concluded that genetics giving rise to variation in the colour of pork is related to differences in pigment content and in muscle metabolism. The latter influences the redox status of the muscle and the activity of oxygen-consuming and metmyoglobin-reducing enzymes and accordingly the relative proportion of the myoglobin species. The colour of pork from Landrace pigs was generally lighter, redder and more yellow than pork from Duroc pigs due to higher level of oxymyoglobin at the meat surface, i. e. more intense blooming. The colour of pork from <b>Hampshire</b> <b>pigs</b> was highly related to the RN genotype. Pork from carriers of the RN- allele was generally lighter, redder and more yellow than that from non-carriers of the RN- allele, and the rn* (V 199 I) allele tended to decrease redness and yellowness...|$|R

40|$|Background Free-range housing, {{in which}} pigs {{have access to}} both indoor and outdoor areas, is {{mandatory}} in organic pig production in Europe, but {{little is known about}} the effects of this housing on joint health in pigs. A high level of joint condemnations at slaughter has been reported in organic free-range pigs in Sweden, compared with pigs raised in conventional confined housing. We hypothesised that biomechanical forces imposed on the joints of pigs that range freely promote the development of osteochondrosis and lead to joint condemnation.

40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted with}} a total of 110 Yorkshire x <b>Hampshire</b> crossbred <b>pigs</b> to determine the effect of dietary levels and ratios of calcium and phosphorus on gain, feed intake, feed conversion, bone breaking strength (BKS), bone weight, percent bone ash and incidence of atrophic rhinitis (AR) in growing-finishing swine. In the first experiment, 50 pigs averaging 27. 4 kg of body weight were fed diets varying in calcium levels from 0. 35 % to 0. 65 % and in phosphorus from 0. 65 % to 1. 40 % of the diet. Sixty crossbred pigs were used in a second experiment to study performance of pigs fed diets varying in levels of phosphorus and amounts of inorganic phosphorus. Calcium was held constant at 0. 35 % in all diets. Phosphorus levels were increased in equal increments (0. 10 %) with inorganic phosphorus. The results of these experiments show that calcium and phosphorus levels and ratios can vary considerably without significantly affecting daily gain and feed conversion of pigs. Levels and ratios of the two elements do affect bone formation as shown by BKS and bone weight data. In these experiments bone weight seemed to be nearly as good a measurement of bone formation as BKS strength. Increasing inorganic phosphorus levels in low calcium diets had a favorable effect on daily gain, feed intake, BKS and bone weight. Within the levels and ratios of calcium and phosphorus studied, there was no relationship between dietary calcium and phosphorus and atrophic rhinitis in growing-finishing swine. Advisor: E. R.

40|$|The main {{driving force}} for gene mapping in farm animals is to {{understand}} the underlying genetics of traits, such as growth, reproduction, disease resistance and production. This study {{has been focused on}} physical mapping of important trait loci in the pig. The different physical mapping techniques are powerful to construct restriction maps, reveal syntenic groups of genes and to determine the chromosomal location of genes and markers. The aim has also been to expand the number of genes mapped in the pig and to compare the results with available human data. The major histocompability complex (Mhc), has {{a key role in the}} immune system. A fibre-FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization) analysis was performed using clones from the Mhc class I 11 region in pig. The objective was to fine map the region and to estimate the size of a region using three different approaches, and compare the results with available pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) data. The results showed that all three methods can be useful and they were in fairly good agreement with the PFGE data. The RN gene has a major effect on muscle glycogen content. The mutant RN allele is dominant and result in a lower technological yield of cooked ham and reduced meat quality. A FISH analysis of six YAC clones containing five microsatellites from the RN region were ordered and assigned to the distal half of band q 25 on pig chromosome 15. The results provided a more precise localization of the RN gene which facilitated the subsequent positional cloning of this gene. Chromosome 13 (SSC 13) harbours the K 88 acHabR locus, which encodes a receptor that allows the adherence of enterotoxic E. coli bacteria. This makes newborn piglets more susceptible to lethal diharrea. SSC 13 also contain QTLs (quantitative trait locus) affecting carcass quality and early growth. In order to expand the comparative map between pig and human, eight genes residing on the human homologue (chromosome 3) were chosen and FISH mapped. The results revealed conservation of gene content but also a number of intra chromosomal rearrangements between pig and human. In a FISH analysis the IGF 2 gene was assigned to the distal tip of chromosome 2 p. QTL analysis using markers from the IGF 2 region revealed a paternally expressed locus with large effect on muscle development. IGF 2, which also is paternally imprinted became a strong candidate gene. The results further confirms the conserved terminal location of this gene through evolution. The QTL can have practical use, since males having the favourable IGF 2 allele can be selected for breeding. The Dominant White locus in pig is one of the major coat colour loci. Four alleles have hitherto been described, one of them was found in this study. The dominant Belt gene causes a white belt across the shoulders and front legs in <b>Hampshire</b> <b>pigs.</b> A genome scan assigned Belt to the centromeric region of chromosome 8 (SSCS). EDNRA, which was an alternative candidate gene, was FISH mapped to the q-arm of SSC 8 and thus excluded. Complete cosegregation in 105 informative meiosis and its phenotypic effect strongly suggested that Belt is a fourth allele at the KIT locus. A quantitative PCR analysis showed that Belt is not associated with a duplication. PFGE analysis was carried out and a BAC contig was constructed to characterize the duplication of KIT in white pigs. The size of the duplication was estimated at about 450 kb. The results showed that the entire coding sequence of KIT was duplicated but not the flanking genes PDGFRA and KDR...|$|R
40|$|We {{report the}} {{identification}} of quantitative trait loci (QTL) affecting carcass composition, carcass length, fat deposition and lean meat content using a genome scan across 462 animals from a combined intercross and backcross between <b>Hampshire</b> and Landrace <b>pigs.</b> Data were analysed using multiple linear regression fitting additive and dominance effects. This model was compared with a model including a parent-of-origin effect to spot evidence of imprinting. Several precisely defined muscle phenotypes were measured in order to dissect body composition in more detail. Three significant QTL were detected in the study at the 1 % genome-wide level, and twelve significant QTL were detected at the 5 % genome-wide level. These QTL comprise loci affecting fat deposition and lean meat content on SSC 1, 4, 9, 10, 13 and 16, a locus on SSC 2 affecting the ratio between weight of meat and bone in back and weight of meat and bone in ham and two loci affecting carcass length on SSC 12 and 17.

40|$|Activity {{behaviour}} {{and social}} interactions of pigs in {{indoor and outdoor}} systems fed different levels of amino acids were studied on 96 crossbred <b>pigs</b> (<b>Hampshire</b> × Swedish Landrace × Swedish Yorkshire). The pigs were born outdoors and raised indoors in conventional pens or outdoors on pastures and given recommended (R), 7 % lower (R- 7) or 14 % lower (R- 14) levels of amino acids, in a phase feeding system with a low-energy diet provided ad libitum. Pigs in the outdoor system walked significantly more (p= 0. 012) and tended to be rooting more (p= 0. 098) than indoor pigs. Amino acid level {{did not affect the}} activity behaviour and social interactions of the pigs. Indoor pigs given diets R- 7 and R- 14 were drinking significantly more often than indoor pigs receiving the R diet, but had less contact with other pigs (p= 0. 020 and p= 0. 002, respectively). For outdoor pigs no such effect of amino acid level was found. Queuing for feed decreased with increasing age of the pigs, both indoors and outdoors (p= 0. 009). Rooting decreased and sleeping increased with the age of indoor pigs (p= 0. 014 and p= 0. 001, respectively), whereas no consistent trend for outdoor pigs was found. Sniffing, nibbling, pushing (p= 0. 001 for all) and tail manipulation (p= 0. 002) occurred more often indoors than outdoors. The results show that pigs in an outdoor system are more active and perform more natural behaviours, such as foraging and rooting, than pigs in an indoor system. Furthermore, roughages, such as pasture, and large areas may {{play an important role in}} occupying pigs and therefore contribute to less aggressive behaviours...|$|R
