50|$|Melilotus albus (Bokhara clover, <b>honey</b> <b>clover,</b> tree clover, sweet clover, white-flowered sweet clover, white sweet clover, white melilot), is a legume {{sometimes}} {{grown for}} forage. White sweet clover {{is a major}} source of nectar for an apiary. Its characteristic sweet odour, intensified by drying, is derived from coumarin.|$|E
50|$|Flowers provide less {{food than}} other major plants parts (seeds, fruits, roots, stems and leaves) but they provide several {{important}} foods and spices. Flower vegetables include broccoli, cauliflower and artichoke. The most expensive spice, saffron, consists of dried stigmas of a crocus. Other flower spices are cloves and capers. Hops flowers {{are used to}} flavor beer. Marigold flowers are fed to chickens to give their egg yolks a golden yellow color, which consumers find more desirable; dried and ground marigold flowers are also used as a spice and colouring agent in Georgian cuisine. Flowers of the dandelion and elder are often made into wine. Bee pollen, pollen collected from bees, is considered a health food by some people. Honey consists of bee-processed flower nectar and is often named {{for the type of}} flower, e.g. orange blossom <b>honey,</b> <b>clover</b> honey and tupelo honey.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} high {{pressure}} processing (HPP) on {{the conversion of}} dihydroxyacetone (DHA) to methylglyoxal (MGO) was examined in New Zealand mānuka honey and models thereof. The objective was to confirm that previously reported increases of MGO with HPP treatment originated from conversion of DHA. RP-HPLC was used to quantify DHA, MGO and hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) after derivatisation with O-(2, 3, 4, 5, 6 -pentafluorobenzyl) hydroxylamine hydrochloride (PFBHA) or (in the case of MGO) separately with o-phenylenediamine (OPD). Fresh and stored mānuka <b>honey,</b> <b>clover</b> honey with DHA added and artificial 26 honey with DHA added were subjected to nine different pressures and holding times and compared to untreated samples. There was no consistent trend of decrease in DHA or increase in MGO {{for any of the}} samples with any treatment. Samples showed random change generally within 5 – 10 % of an untreated sample for MGO, DHA and HMF. HPP does not accelerate the conversion of DHA to MGO in honey...|$|E

40|$|Sensory {{analysis}} of bee honey {{is an important}} tool for determining its floral origin, for subsequent quality control practices and which ultimately will determine consumer preferences towards this product. A procedure for the selection, training and monitoring of assessors was applied. Unifloraleucalyptus and <b>clover</b> <b>honeys</b> produced in Argentine were assessed using descriptive quantitative analysis. The sensory profiles differentiated <b>clover</b> <b>honey</b> (light, fruity and floral flavor with low intensity) from eucalyptus honey (more intense flavors, vegetable notes, aromatic, warm, small crystals with a high tendency to quick crystallization in mass). The analysis by principal components showed higher intensities of sweetness and smell for eucalyptus honeys and graininess for <b>clover</b> <b>honeys.</b> These appropriate indicators of quality provide a differentiating tool to increase the added value of these honeys...|$|R
