50|$|Production of {{galvannealed}} {{sheet steel}} begins with <b>hot</b> <b>dip</b> <b>galvanization</b> of sheet steel. After {{passing through the}} galvanizing zinc bath the sheet steel passes through air knives to remove excess zinc, and is then heated in an annealing furnace for several seconds causing iron and zinc layers to diffuse into one another causing the formation of zinc-iron alloy layers at the surface. The annealing step is performed with the strip still hot after the galvanizing step, with the zinc still liquid. The galvanising bath contains slightly over 0.1% aluminium, added to form a layer bonding between the iron and coated zinc. Annealing temperatures are around 500 to 565 °C. Pre-1990 annealing lines used gas-fired heating; post-1990s the use of induction furnaces became common.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{part of a}} study {{aimed at}} ﬁnding a suitable, yet cost-effective, surface ﬁnish for a steel structure subject to the car washing environment and corrosive chemicals. The initial, life cycle and average equivalent annual (AEAC) costs for surface ﬁnishing methods were calculated for a steel structure using the LCCC algorithm developed by American Galvanizers Association (AGA). The cost study consisted of 45 common surface ﬁnish systems including: hot-dip galvanization (HDG), metallization, acrylic, alkyd and epoxy as well as duplex coatings such as epoxy zinc and inorganic zinc (IOZ). The results show that initial, life cycle and AEAC costs for <b>hot</b> <b>dip</b> <b>galvanization</b> are the lowest among all the other methods, followed by coal tar epoxy painting. The annual average cost of HDG for this structure was estimated about € 0. 22 /m 2, while the other cost-effective alternatives were: IOZ, polyurea, epoxy waterborne and IOZ/epoxy duplex coating.

40|$|Zinc has {{traditionally}} been the metallic material most widely used to protect steel against atmospheric corrosion due to its ability to afford cathodic protection to steel in all types of natural atmospheres. In recent decades, aluminium and zinc/aluminium alloy coatings have been used instead of zinc in certain atmospheric applications. Although these coatings present some advantages over zinc, they {{are not able to}} cathodically protect steel substrates in all types of natural atmospheres. The present paper assesses the cathodic protection afforded by Al (flame spraying), Al/ 13 Si (<b>hot</b> <b>dipping),</b> 55 Al/Zn (<b>hot</b> <b>dipping),</b> Zn/ 15 Al (flame spraying), Zn/ 5 Al (<b>hot</b> <b>dipping),</b> Zn (<b>hot</b> <b>dipping),</b> Zn (discontinuous <b>hot</b> <b>dipping)</b> and Zn (electroplating).

50|$|Aluminized steel can be {{made using}} a variety of processes, cladding, <b>hot</b> <b>dipping,</b> {{galvanic}} coating, metallizing, and calorizing, but the most effective process is <b>hot</b> <b>dipping.</b> The process of <b>hot</b> <b>dipping</b> starts by cleaning the steel, then placing the steel in a bath of Al-11%Si at a temperature of 988K and shaken, then pulled out and air dried. The aluminium diffuses into the steel, creating an intermetallic layer above the steel base layer, but below the outside aluminum coating. The aluminium coating is oxidized to help protect the inner steel from corrosion and further aluminium diffusion. The silicon is added to the aluminium bath to create a thinner layer of aluminium on the steel. The <b>hot</b> <b>dipping</b> process is cheaper and more effective to produce aluminized steel than any other process.|$|R

40|$|The {{physical}} metallurgy and related process and product performance concepts for the zinc and zinc alloy <b>hot</b> <b>dip</b> coating of steel wire are briefly reviewed, and are illustrated with a detailed model of aluminum behavior in Galfan ® process technology. Applications to <b>hot</b> <b>dip</b> bath management practices are set forth. Background The coating {{of iron and}} steel with zinc to improve corrosion resistance has been practiced in various forms for 260 years, and a thorough description of the numerous wire-related technologies has been compiled in the handbook Ferrous Wire. 1 In general, the basic unalloyed zinc technologies may be grouped under the headings “hot dip galvanizing ” and “electrogalvanizing”. <b>Hot</b> <b>dip</b> practice involves the passage of wire through a molten zinc bath, whereas electrogalvanizing involves electroplating. The galvanized steel coating may involve no further processing. Alternatively, it may be redrawn, or otherwise reworked, chromated or oiled. It {{is important to note}} that the success of these technologies and the serviceability of the final product depend substantially on prior conditioning of the wire. Critical annealing, cleaning and fluxing (in the case of <b>hot</b> <b>dip)</b> processes precede the coating step. Moreover, <b>hot</b> <b>dip</b> coatings are optimized by the maintenance of small additions of aluminum in the zinc bath and by “wiping ” and quenching practices upon emergence from the bath. Modern, in depth presentations on zinc-based steel coating systems may be found in Zinc-Based Steel Coating Systems: Production and Performance. 2 The physical metallurgical basis of zinc-coated steel has been recently reviewed in detail by Marder. 3 It is practical and economical to apply a zinc alloy coating. Although traditional galvanized coatings with small (0. 1 %) aluminum compositions are the most popular, the most rapidly growing <b>hot</b> <b>dip</b> coating is made with the Galfan ® process, wherein a Zn- 5 % Al coating is applied by <b>hot</b> <b>dipping</b> (all composition data in this paper are in % by weight).

This paper discusses emerging ‘next generation’ technology within the field of corrosion protection, providing new solutions for specific application areas of ground support product design. Traditionally, anti-corrosion strategies have predominantly focussed upon <b>Hot</b> <b>Dip</b> Galvanising as a common industry solution. However, now complimenting this traditional solution, the more recent technology of Thermal Diffusion Galvanising is gaining interest within the Australian market, providing commercially viable solutions for a number of specific application areas that <b>Hot</b> <b>Dip</b> Galvanising cannot address. Thermal Diffusion Galvanising is an alternative zinc based technology, which offers equivalent cathodic protection to that of <b>Hot</b> <b>Dip</b> Galvanising. Thermal Diffusion Galvanising has a comparatively deeper metallurgical bond to the steel substrate through various zinc-iron alloy layers, offering both increased adhesion and greater surface hardness. Beyond the capabilities of <b>Hot</b> <b>Dip</b> Galvanising, Thermal Diffusion Galvanising has specific applications of interest in high tensile steel grades, coating thickness consistency for threadforms, excellent torque / tension performance and greater flexibility with deformation. Thermal Diffusion Galvanising also continues to provide spark reduction properties on friction contact.
