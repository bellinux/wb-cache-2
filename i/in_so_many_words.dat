In April 1943, the League captured the governments of Bengal and, a month later, that of the North West Frontier Province. In none of these provinces had the League previously had a majority – only the arrest of Congress members made it possible. With all the Muslim dominated provinces except the Punjab under Jinnah's control, the artificial concept of a separate Muslim State was turning into a reality. However, by 1944, Jinnah's power and prestige were on the wane. A general sympathy towards the jailed Congress leaders was developing among Muslims, {{and much of the}} blame for the disastrous Bengal famine of 1943–44 during which two million died, had been laid on the shoulders of the province's Muslim League government. The numbers at Jinnah's meetings, once counted in thousands soon numbered only a few hundreds. In despair, Jinnah left the political scene for a stay in Kashmir. His prestige was restored unwittingly by Gandhi, who had been released from prison on medical grounds in May 1944 and had met Jinnah in Bombay in September. There he offered the Muslim leader a plebiscite in the Muslim areas after the war to see whether they wanted to separate from the rest of India. Essentially, it was an acceptance of the principle of Pakistan – but not <b>in</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>words.</b> Jinnah demanded that the exact words be said; Gandhi refused and the talks broke down. Jinnah, however, had greatly strengthened his own position and that of the League. The most influential member of Congress had been seen to negotiate with him on equal terms. Other Muslim League leaders, opposed both to Jinnah and to the partition of India, lost strength.|$|E
500|$|An {{important}} {{deviation of}} the film's plot from history {{is that there}} is scant evidence in real life Austen and Lefroy's relationship went beyond acquaintance. Rather, all that is known of them together is that they danced at three Christmas balls before Tom returned to school and that Jane was [...] "too proud" [...] to ask his aunt about him two years later. In the latter years of Tom Lefroy's life, he was questioned about his relationship with Jane Austen by his nephew, and admitted to having loved Jane Austen, but stated that it was a [...] "boyish love". As is written in a letter sent from T.E.P. Lefroy to James Edward Austen Leigh in 1870,My late venerable uncle ... said <b>in</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>words</b> that {{he was in love with}} her, although he qualified his confession by saying it was a boyish love. As this occurred in a friendly & private conversation, I feel some doubt whether I ought to make it public.Lori Smith, author of The Jane Austen Guide to Life, opined that:No doubt this relationship and her [...] repartee with Tom fueled her writing. Whether it was [...] "her greatest inspiration" [...] as the trailers for Becoming Jane claim, well, that's debatable. But I'm sure it provided as spark.However, contrary to the film's story line, Jane had attempted her first full-length novel before she met Tom and had already read The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling before meeting him. In a cut scene from the movie, it is clear that she is reading the novel for the second time, but in the theatrical release without that scene, it appears he introduces her to it.|$|E

2500|$|A third trailer was {{released}} in October 2012, entitled [...] "Beast of America". It initially shares similarities {{with the opening of}} BioShock, with Booker being taken to a lighthouse with instruction. From there, the trailer's first half shows in-game scenes of settings around Columbia representative of American Exceptionalism such as an amusement park, a public beach, and an ice-cream parlor, prior to demonstration many of the gameplay elements including the Skyhook and the Heavy Hitters. The trailer is set to Nico Vega's [...] "Beast", which, as stated by Times Matt Peckham notes, [...] "excoriates American apathy, <b>in</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>words,</b> ' seeds for the Beast of America'". A fourth trailer, [...] "City in the Sky", {{was released}}, showcasing many of the game's elements, including Columbia, Booker, Elizabeth, Songbird, and Comstock. The fifth trailer [...] "The Lamb of Columbia", focuses more on Elizabeth, showing her importance to the war aboard Columbia, her potency of her powers, and how Booker comes to fear her.|$|E

Lieutenant Wands was also instructed to repeat them.

'The health of Mrs Grummond was such that Lieutenant Wands and other friends urged him, for his family's sake, to be prudent, and avoid all rash movements and any pursuit that would draw them over Lodge Trail Ridge, and to report to Brevet Lieutenant-Colonel Fetterman the orders he had received.

As David Hawkes puts it, [...] "he Chu Ci poems, however popular, belonged to no canon, dealt in matters that were outlandish and unorthodox, and originated outside of the area of sanctified Western Zhou tradition." [...] However, part of the Chu Ci tradition includes a Confucian outlook, glorifying the loyal minister who prefers death over compromising his integrity. Following its Han Dynasty publication, the Chu Ci was subject to various editorial treatment, including various commentaries and editions. The order in which the sections of the Chu Ci are currently generally arranged was established through editorial re-arrangement during or following the tenth or eleventh century. This is not true, however, of the Li Sao; which, in the Wang Yi edition, is titled [...] "Li sao jing", saying, <b>in</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>words,</b> that this was [...] "classic": the other works (juan) of the Chu Ci anthology generally fall in the category of zhuan, or exegesis or amplification upon the original [...] "classic" [...] text.|$|E

50|$|On {{a proper}} {{interpretation}} of the Constitution, the power to determine and control the National Assembly's internal arrangements did not embrace the power to suspend a Member as punishment for contempt. The powers under section 57(1)(a) of the Constitution were meant to facilitate the proper exercise of powers and functions of the Assembly which the Constitution intended. Had Parliament intended otherwise, the Constitution would say <b>so</b> <b>in</b> as <b>many</b> <b>words,</b> particularly, the court held, because the principles of representative democracy lay {{at the heart of}} the Constitution. The suspension of a Member of the Assembly from Parliament for contempt was not consistent with the requirements of representative democracy. It would be a punishment calculated to have penalised not only the Member for contempt, but also his or her party and those of the electorate who voted for that party and who are entitled to be represented in the Assembly by their proportional number of representatives.|$|R

40|$|MM - P&DMSouth Africa is {{experiencing}} a high HIV/AIDS prevalence rate. This has {{a negative impact on}} the development of the country more especially on the socioeconomic improvement of the lives of its citizens. The Gauteng HIV/AIDS strategy and a Multisectoral response to HIV/AIDS are considered as a positive step to responding to the high prevalence rate that is evident across all age groups. The HIV/AIDS workplace programme is seen as a way of preventing or lessening the loss of skilled personnel due to ailments and deaths related to HIV/AIDS. However, there is inadequate information on the effectiveness of the implementation of the HIV/AIDS at workplace programme, in terms of codes of good practice. The aim and purpose of the research study was to explore leadership challenges facing programme coordinators in implementing the workplace programme during the 2006 / 7 financial year and to find out what solutions or alternatives can be implemented in achieving the expected service delivery outputs/targets. There were three main research questions that the study seeks to answer, that is, has leadership, with commitment and focus, been a contributing factor to effective responses in the implementation of HIV/AIDS workplace programme in GPG departments; what are the common problems or challenges that are experienced by programme coordinators in implementing the programme and what creative ways can be administered to improve the present situation? Both quantitative and qualitative research was undertaken and a self-administered questionnaire was developed and administered by the researcher for data collection. The study finds that, though there is general agreement on leadership commitment by the ten departments that participated in the study, there are some departments that require support and dedicated leaders for the effectiveness of the HIV/AIDS workplace programme. Recommendations are made in the last chapter. This study, <b>in</b> not <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>words,</b> calls for a policy review of the HIV/AIDS workplace programme in the Gauteng Province...|$|R
60|$|Lemuel {{had found}} out about the art-students from Berry. He said they were no {{relation}} to each other, and had not even been acquainted before they met at the art-school; he had first met them at the St. Albans. Miss Swan was from {{the western part of the}} State, and Miss Carver from down Plymouth way. The latter took pupils, and sometimes gave lessons at their houses; she was, to Berry's thinking, not half the genius and not half the duck that Miss Swan was, though she was a duck in her way too. Miss Swan, as nearly as he could explain, was studying art for the fun of it, or the excitement, for she was well enough off; her father was a lawyer out there, and Berry believed that a rising son-in-law in his own profession would be just the thing for the old man's declining years. He said he should not be very particular about settling down to practice at once; if his wife wanted to go to Europe a while, and kind of tender foot it round for a year or two in the art-centres over there, he would let the old man run the business a little longer; sometimes it did an old man good. There was no hurry; Berry's own father was not excited about his going to work right away; he had the money to run Berry and a wife too, if it came to that; Miss Swan understood that. He had not told her <b>so</b> <b>in</b> just <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>words,</b> but he had let her know that Alonzo W. Berry, senior, was not borrowing money at two per cent. a month any more. He said he did not care to make much of a blow about that part of it till he was ready to act, and he was not going to act till he had a dead-sure thing of it; he was having a very good time as it went along, and he guessed Miss Swan was too; no use to hurry a girl, when she was on the right track.|$|R
