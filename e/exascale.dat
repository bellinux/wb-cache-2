5|$|Plans {{to create}} a {{supercomputer}} capable of 20 petaFLOPS at the Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility (OLCF) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) originated {{as far back as}} 2005, when Jaguar was built. Titan will itself be replaced by an approximately 200 petaFLOPS system in 2016 as part of ORNL's plan to operate an <b>exascale</b> (1000 petaFLOPS to 1 exaFLOPS) machine by 2020. The initial plan to build a new 15,000 square meter (160,000 ft2) building for Titan, was discarded in favor of using Jaguar's existing infrastructure. The precise system architecture was not finalized until 2010, although a deal with Nvidia to supply the GPUs was signed in 2009. Titan was first announced at the private ACM/IEEE Supercomputing Conference (SC10) on November 16, 2010, and was publicly announced on October 11, 2011, as {{the first phase of the}} Titan upgrade began.|$|E
25|$|Fujitsu (a {{supercomputer}} {{maker of}} June 2011 world's fastest K computer according to TOP500) {{announced at the}} International Supercomputing Conference in June 2016 that its future <b>exascale</b> supercomputer will feature processors of its own design that implement the Armv8 architecture, rather than the SPARC processors used in earlier supercomputers. These processors will also implement extensions to the Armv8 architecture equivalent to HPC-ACE2 that Fujitsu is developing with Arm Holdings.|$|E
25|$|Supercomputing in China has {{expanded}} rapidly. Supercomputing affects {{the possibility to}} do cutting edge research in many areas such as design of pharmaceuticals, cryptanalysis, natural resource exploration, climate models, and military technology. As of 2016, China had 167 of the 500 greatest supercomputers in the world, {{more than any other}} country (including the US which has 165) in addition to possessing the top 2 most powerful supercomputers. China is developing the capacity to manufacture the components domestically and plans {{to be the first to}} build an <b>exascale</b> supercomputer. China may also be planning to create much more powerful large-scale distributed supercomputing by connecting its supercomputer centers together. Tianhe-1 was for a period in 2010-2011 the world's fastest supercomputer. In June 2013, Tianhe-2, the successor to Tianhe-1, took the crown from its predecessor. In 2016, China's new supercomputer, Sunway TaihuLight became the world's most powerful supercomputer, significantly surpassing Tianhe-2's capabilities by three folds, while using Chinese-made chips. This signals China's success not only in the supercomputing industry, but also its domestic chip-making technology.|$|E
