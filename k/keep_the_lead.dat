25|$|Shooting {{the moon}} can rapidly change the {{direction}} of a game in a player's favor; however, it is also very risky. A good hand for shooting the moon should contain significant high cards, in addition to a long run of a single suit {{that can be used to}} <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> once the other players have run out of that suit.|$|E
25|$|Gino Bartali, {{captain of}} the Italian team, {{threatened}} and assaulted by some French supporters accusing him to have caused Jean Robic's fall on the Col d'Aspin, retired after winning the 12th stage from Pau to Saint-Gaudens and left the race together {{with all the other}} Italian riders (including Fiorenzo Magni, who was wearing the yellow jersey). The lead transferred to Swiss cyclist Ferdinand Kübler, who was able to <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> {{until the end of the}} race. Kübler became the first Swiss winner of the Tour de France.|$|E
25|$|Bartali {{came to the}} 1940 Giro d'Italia with {{a strong}} Legnano team and high ambitions to win the overall crown; however his hopes were derailed when he crashed in the race's second stage and lost time. Fausto Coppi was {{promoted}} to the new team leader after Bartali's misfortunes. Coppi donned the general classificationleader's pink jersey after attacking on the Abetone in the race's eleventh stage and managed to <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> {{all the way to}} the event's finish in Milan. Coppi became the youngest rider to ever win the Giro at 20 years, 8 months and 25 days old, breaking the record that was held by Luigi Marchisio. World War II brought the Giro's annual running to a halt after the 1940 edition.|$|E

50|$|To recover {{lead from}} a battery, the battery is broken and the {{components}} are classified. <b>The</b> <b>lead</b> containing components are processed in blast furnaces for hard lead or rotary reverberatory furnaces for fine particles. The blast furnace {{is similar in}} structure to a cupola furnace used in iron foundries. The furnace is charged with slag, scrap iron, limestone, coke, oxides, dross, and reverberatory slag. The coke is used to melt and reduce <b>the</b> <b>lead.</b> Limestone reacts with impurities and floats to the top. This process also <b>keeps</b> <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> from oxidizing. <b>The</b> molten <b>lead</b> flows from <b>the</b> blast furnace into holding pots. Lead may be mixed with alloys, including antimony, tin, arsenic, copper and nickel. It is then cast into ingots.|$|R
25|$|The Rookies won {{the game}} 140–128, ending the Sophomores' seven games win streak and winning the Rookie Challenge {{for the first time}} since 2002. Rookie's Tyreke Evans was named MVP; he had 26 points, 6 rebounds and 5 assists. DeJuan Blair scored 22 points and notched a record 23 rebounds, {{becoming}} the first player to have a 20–20 game in the Rookie Challenge. Sophomore's Russell Westbrook had a game-high 40 points in a losing effort. It was the second time a player has reached the 40-point mark, since Kevin Durant had 46 points last year. The Rookies were up by 12 at halftime, the largest lead of the game. Westbrook, who had 11 points at halftime, took over and scored 29 points in the second half. But strong plays enabled the Rookies to <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> for the rest of the game.|$|E
25|$|After {{a humiliating}} shutout loss the past week, Cody Pickett {{was given the}} job of {{starting}} quarterback. The game started off with Zeke Moreno intercepting a pass from BC Lions quarterback Buck Pierce. Toronto was leading 9–0, but after Buck Pierce {{was taken out of}} the game as a result of concussion-like symptoms, BC's second-string quarterback Jarious Jackson came in and led the Lions to their first touchdown of the game. The Argos responded by delivering a touchdown pass to Reggie McNeal. Although the Argos had a lot of trouble finding the endzone throughout the game, kicker Justin Medlock helped them <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> by kicking field goals. Medlock would score seven field goals, tying Lance Chomyc's Argonauts team record and just short of the league record of eight shared by Dave Ridgway, Mark McLoughlin, and Paul Osbaldiston.|$|E
25|$|Buemi won {{the pole}} {{position}} by recording the fastest time in qualifying and held off {{an attack by}} second-placed starter Jean-Éric Vergne to <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> {{at the beginning of}} the race. Buemi pulled away from Vergne but his advantage was reduced to nothing when a crash between championship rival Lucas di Grassi and António Félix da Costa on the 16th lap neutralised the event. All drivers, including Buemi, made their mandatory pit stops to switch into their second car. Buemi regained the lead three laps after the restart from Mike Conway when the latter made his own stop. Vergne crashed on lap 34 which caused the deployment of the safety car and Buemi fended off an attack by López at the restart four laps later. He held the lead for the remainder of the race to secure the victory. There were three lead changes among three different drivers during the course of the race.|$|E
5000|$|Ratchet-based pencils are {{a variant}} of the clutch pencil, in which <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> is held in place by two or three small jaws inside a ring at the tip. The jaws are {{controlled}} by a button on the end or the side of the pencil. When the button is pushed, the jaws move forward and separate, allowing <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> to advance. When the button is released and the jaws retract, the [...] "lead retainer" [...] (a small rubber device inside <b>the</b> tip) <b>keeps</b> <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> in place, preventing <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> from either falling freely outward or riding back up into the barrel until the jaws recover their grip. Other designs use a precisely-fitted metal sleeve to guide and support <b>the</b> <b>lead,</b> and do not need a rubber retainer.|$|R
50|$|However, {{despite the}} villagers' {{being allowed to}} <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> church, <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> was {{stripped}} from the nave, and until 1618 when George Preston, a landowner at nearby Holker Hall, provided considerable finances to allow the roof to be reinstated, the villagers actually worshipped in the choir, rather than the nave of the church. In 1643 some Roundhead troops stayed in the village, stabling their horses in the church. Bullet holes from this time are still visible in the southwest door of the nave.|$|R
50|$|An {{advanced}} ratchet type has {{a mechanism}} that rotates <b>the</b> pencil <b>lead</b> 9° counter-clockwise every time <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> is pressed {{on to the}} paper (which counts as one stroke), to distribute wear evenly. This auto-rotation mechanism <b>keeps</b> <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> 50% narrower than in the common propelling mechanical pencils, resulting in uniform thickness of the lines written onto the paper. The design was first developed by Mitsubishi Pencil Company, and named Kuru Toga under the Uni brand. This type of pencil is most suited for Asian languages that have multiple strokes per letter or word, where the pencil is frequently lifted off the paper. The mechanism is not suitable for cursive writing used in western scripts. Another recent auto-rotation movement by Uni rotates <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> 18 degrees per stroke (or 20 strokes per complete revolution), which is better suited for western scripts.|$|R
25|$|Game4 {{was pushed}} back a day because of rain, {{the first time}} a rainout had {{occurred}} in the World Series since Game1 in 1996. The fans from the game were to attend Game5. (Thus, fans who had tickets for Game5 went to Game4 instead.) The Cardinals won, taking a 3–1 series lead. The Tigers took a 3–0 lead into the top of the third, after Sean Casey had two RBIs, including a home run. The other RBI came from Detroit's Iván Rodríguez, who singled in Carlos Guillén. Rodriguez, who had been hitless in the previous three games, also went 3-for-4. In the bottom of the third, the Cardinals struck back with a run-scoring double by David Eckstein, scoring Aaron Miles who had the first stolen base of the series by either team. Yadier Molina doubled in Scott Rolen in the fourth to cut the Tiger lead to 3–2. The score remained that way, until the bottom of the seventh, when Eckstein led off with a double over the head of Curtis Granderson, who had slipped on the wet Busch Stadium outfield. Eckstein then scored on a sacrifice bunt by So Taguchi that was thrown over the head of Plácido Polanco covering first by Fernando Rodney, and that tied the score at three. Later that same inning, Preston Wilson hit a single to left with two outs that scored Taguchi from third. The Tigers tied the game {{in the top of the}} eighth on a Brandon Inge double that scored Iván Rodríguez. In the bottom of the eighth inning, the Cardinals would regain and <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> when Miles scored on a double by Eckstein just off the glove of outfielder Craig Monroe, who had been playing shallow and dove for a ball just out of his reach.|$|E
500|$|Soon {{after the}} Oxford boat {{overlapped}} their opponents yet Cambridge pushed away again before Chiswick Eyot where the Dark Blues once began to overlap the Light Blues' stern. [...] Cambridge's stroke Lawes reacted and pushed to <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> <b>lead,</b> but by Chiswick Church the crews were level. [...] Oxford's better {{line in the}} river saw them draw away rapidly from Cambridge, whereupon the Light Blues were regarded as [...] "falling to pieces". [...] Oxford's lead at Barnes Bridge was around three lengths, {{and by the time}} they passed the finishing line they had won by four lengths in a time of 21 minutes 24 seconds, securing the Dark Blue's fifth consecutive win and taking the overall record to 1210 in their favour. [...] Drinkwater suggested that, of the 22 races conducted thus far, it was [...] "one of the most sensational races in this history", while Burnell described it as a [...] "splendid race".|$|E
500|$|Benfica {{opened the}} new year at home, once more against Marítimo; the game ended 1–1 as the eighth draw of the season, sliding Benfica down to fifth place in the league. On the 8th, Benfica added Edgaras Jankauskas on loan from Real Sociedad to their roster, {{strengthening}} a sector that only had Mantorras as reliable option. In {{the second week of}} January, Benfica played Varzim at home. After trailing at halftime 2–0, Benfica scored three in less than fifteen minutes for a final score of 3–2, the first win since 2 December. Three days later, Benfica improved its squad again, signing Tiago Mendes from Braga, with Armando Sá also moving to Lisbon. On 19 January, with Tiago already in the lineup, Benfica played Salgueiros at Estádio Engenheiro Vidal Pinheiro. The game ended in a 4–1 win for Benfica, defined by Record as the team's [...] "first comfortable win in the league, and the first improvements after the comatose state that led to managerial change". On the final Sunday of the month, Benfica visited Bonfim to face Vitória de Setúbal. Benfica scored first with a goal from Carlitos in the 20th minute, but couldn't <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> <b>lead,</b> resulting in yet another draw.|$|E

500|$|Shortly {{after the}} French order to set sail was abandoned, the British fleet began rapidly {{approaching}} once more. Brueys, now expecting {{to come under}} attack that night, ordered each of his ships to place springs on their anchor cables and prepare for action. He sent the Alerte ahead, which passed close to the leading British ships and then steered sharply to the west over the shoal, {{in the hope that}} the ships of the line might follow and become grounded. None of Nelson's captains fell for the ruse and the British fleet continued undeterred. At 17:30, Nelson hailed one of his two leading ships, HMS Zealous under Captain Samuel Hood, which had been racing Goliath to be the first to fire on the French. The admiral ordered Hood to establish the safest course into the harbour. The British had no charts of the depth or shape of the bay, except a rough sketch map Swiftsure had obtained from a merchant captain, an inaccurate British atlas on Zealous, and a 35-year-old French map aboard Goliath. Hood replied that he would take careful soundings as he advanced to test the depth of the water, and that, [...] "If you will allow the honour of leading you into battle, I will <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> going." [...] Shortly afterwards, Nelson paused to speak with the brig HMS Mutine, whose commander, Lieutenant Thomas Hardy, had seized some maritime pilots from a small Alexandrine vessel. As Vanguard came to a stop, the following ships slowed. This caused a gap to open up between Zealous and Goliath and the rest of the fleet. To counter this effect, Nelson ordered HMS Theseus under Captain Ralph Miller to pass his flagship and join Zealous and Goliath in the vanguard. By 18:00, the British fleet was again under full sail, Vanguard sixth in the line of ten ships as Culloden trailed behind to the north and [...] Alexander and Swiftsure hastened to catch up to the west. Following the rapid change from a loose formation to a rigid line of battle both fleets raised their colours; each British ship added additional Union Flags in its rigging in case its main flag was shot away. At 18:20, as Goliath and Zealous rapidly bore down on them, the leading French ships Guerrier and Conquérant opened fire.|$|E

She was happy with her second ever marathon win, saying: [...] "I have promised myself to challenge for a victory many times before but I was unable to attain my goal previously...this time I was determined to win". A victory at the Sapporo Half Marathon in July came after as she held off a challenge from Azausa Nojiri to <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> in the final stages.|$|E
2500|$|The second race {{began at}} 10:50 local time. Weather {{conditions}} {{at the start of}} the event were dry and sunny with an air temperature of [...] and an track temperature at [...] On the grid, pole position starter Dillmann made a clean getaway and held off Quaife-Hobbs to <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> heading towards the first corner. Quaife-Hobbs attempted to steer onto the inside line but ran wide which contributed to some contact within the field. Coletti made a fast start and moved from seventh to third by driving on the outside line at turn one. Bird initially got away from his starting position slowly but Quaife-Hobbs's blocking of Coletti allowed him into second place on the inside. Rossi was clipped by Nasr going into the first corner and the latter broke Rossi's front wing. Leimer was on the inside line driving into turn one and Rossi's nose cone made contact with the sidepod and the turning vane of Leimer's car. This affected Leimer for the rest of the event as debris was lodged in his car's sidepod. Haryanto and Ericsson both sustained damage after they hit each other and went to the pit lane before resuming.|$|E

James Hinchcliffe finished fifth, high enough to <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> points <b>lead</b> with 139 points. Markus Niemelä trails Hinchcliffe by 7 and Bomarito is only 9 points back. Atlantic and Champ Car veteran Tõnis Kasemets made his first appearance since last year's Atlantic round at Road America and finished on the podium in third.|$|R

2500|$|The {{top three}} drivers of both races {{appeared}} on the podium to collect their trophies and to participate later in a press conference. After the feature race, Vandoorne said he probably could have run longer with the soft-compound tyres but chose to enter the pit lane to ensure he would remain in the lead and felt his team made the correct decision, [...] "We {{just wanted to be}} safe and <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> because we already had made two more laps than the others on the soft tyres." [...] Leal was delighted to secure a second-place finish and did not believe he could have finished in the position because of where he started but his team noted his pace was strong throughout pre-season testing, [...] "It’s great {{that we were able to}} replicate that and get here today.” He revealed his engineer told him to push hard for two laps enabling him to gain positions and was not attempting to attack Palmer but passed him as a result of conserving tyre life in the event's closing stages. Third-place finisher Palmer spoke of his disappointment because he felt his team could challenge for the victory but praised the strategy that enabled him to move back up the field. He admitted that work needed done on his starts but did not change his strategy after his slow getaway.|$|E
2500|$|Older {{machines}} typically had a 1/3hp 850 or 1140 revolution {{per minute}} motor geared to the main clutch wheel, the inner shaft engaging this wheel while the casting cycle was in operation. [...] An external leather belt on this wheel ran a second jack-shaft, which powered the distributor and keyboard matrix conveyor and escapements through additional belting off this shaft. [...] Gas fired pots, {{such as in the}} illustration below, were most common in the earlier years, with the pot being thermostatically controlled (high flame when under temperature and low flame when up to temperature), and then a second smaller burner for the mouth and throat heating, or else, with the more modern installations running on 1500 watt electric pots with an initially rheostat controlled mouth and throat heaters (several hundred watts on the electric models)(to <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> and tin type metal liquified just prior to being cast) to precisely adjust temperature. [...] Newer machines, and the larger machines above 36 EM Matrix size typically used the more standardized 1/2 horsepower motor after v-belts came into common use in the 1930s. [...] The large machines also had the so-called 'double pot', with either larger gas burners, or else 2250 watt pot heaters and larger mouth and throat heaters. [...] The most modern Linotypes had the mouth and throat heaters thermostatically controlled, an improvement over the manual rheostat adjustment, or gas flame adjustment.|$|E

60|$|It {{was not a}} very {{exciting}} bout. Allen took things very easily. He knew his training was by no means all it should have been, and it was not his game to take it out of himself with any firework business in the trial heats. He would reserve that for the final. So he sparred three gentle rounds with the Harrow sportsman, just doing sufficient to <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> and obtain the verdict after the last round. He finished without having turned a hair. He had only received one really hard blow, and that had done no damage. After this came a long series of fights.

The {{greatest}} care is to <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lead</b> upon the Trencher in the right degree of heat; if it be too cool, it will not run through the Trencher, though it stand melted upon it; and this is to be helped by blowing the Coals a little, or pouring on new Lead that is hotter: but the cooler the Lead, the larger the Shot; and the hotter, the smaller; when it it too hot, the drops will crack and fly; then you must stop pouring on new Lead, and let it cool; and so long as you observe the right temper of the heat, the Lead will constantly drop into very round Shot, without so much as one with a tail in many pounds.|$|E
60|$|When {{he drove}} into the high road again, however, an {{overlooked}} possibility threatened {{for a moment to}} indefinitely postpone his amiable intentions regarding Low. The hotel was at the further end of the settlement towards the Carquinez Woods, and as Wynn had nearly reached it he was recalled to himself by the sounds of hoofs and wheels rapidly approaching {{from the direction of the}} Excelsior turnpike. Wynn made no doubt it was the sheriff and Brace. To avoid recognition at that moment, he whipped up his horse, intending to <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> until he could turn into the first cross-road. But the coming travelers had the fleetest horse, and finding it impossible to distance them he drove close to the ditch, pulling up suddenly as the strange vehicle was abreast of him, and forcing them to pass him at full speed, with the result already chronicled. When they had vanished in the darkness, Mr. Wynn, with a heart overflowing with Christian thankfulness and universal benevolence, wheeled round, and drove back to the hotel he had already passed. To pull up at the veranda with a stentorian shout, to thump loudly at the deserted bar, to hilariously beat the panels of the landlord's door, and commit a jocose assault and battery upon that half-dresssed and half-awakened man, was eminently characteristic of Wynn, and part of his amiable plans that morning.|$|E
