S. marking the final rapids on rivers before the ocean. Historically, waterborne transport of goods required portage around the falls at these points, while some falls provided water power during early industrialization. These factors attracted commerce and manufacturing. Although these original advantages have long since been made obsolete, we document the continuing—and even increasing—importance of these portage sites over time. We interpret this finding in a model with path dependence arising from local increasing returns to scale. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{statistical}} analysis of stream orientations is an helpful tool in the active tectonic studies because the rivers network is an important <b>geomorphologic</b> <b>feature</b> useful to derive the deformation due to active faults. The drainage network automatically derived from DTM’s is not generally usable {{for this type of}} analysis because the automatic routines generate the stream network following the four direction orthogonal to the cell. In this paper we present a semiautomatic methodology to extract the drainage network from high resolution DTM data (5 x 5 pixel m) the most possible consistent with the real water-drainage pattern, in order to make accurate statistic azimuthal analyses of stream orientations. The methodology have been tested on the active tectonic area of the Tammaro basin (Campania and Molise Regions), epicentral zone of the 1688 strong earthquake (MW= 6. 7). The results obtained by the application of the proposed methodology show a good agreement with the drainage pattern map derived from photo-interpretation (Regional Technical Cartography) ...|$|E
40|$|Large {{parts of}} the Danube Delta coast {{suffered}} severe erosion during last decades due to both natural trends and human interventions. To investigate and quantify the processes controlling the Danube Delta coast evolution a systematic approach was employed. First, a hindcast of the wave climate was simulated using the numerical model SWAN and wind data recorded locally during 11 consecutive years. Second, the sediment transport was calculated using the simulated wave climate, field data and an one line numerical model (UNIBEST CL+). A sediment budget and predictions for the future evolution of the study zone were derived further on. Third, the process based numerical model Delft- 3 D was used to investigate the episodic water level changes which produce locally large shoreline retreats. Fourth, an ideal spit was design and modelled with Delft- 3 D to {{understand the relationship between}} the two sediment transport components: cross and along shore. The results, along with historical data, were used to study the dynamics of the Sahalin spit, a particular <b>geomorphologic</b> <b>feature</b> formed at southernmost distributary mouth. Based on this particular case a conceptual model for formation and evolution of a spit at a river mouth was proposed. The thesis concludes with recommendations to mitigate the coastal erosion in a sustainable way by artificially supplying the retreating beach sectors.

40|$|Ice-rich {{permafrost}} {{that formed}} in glacial periods of the Quaternary is highly vulnerable to thaw under ongoing {{climate change and}} anthropogenic disturbance. Permafrost degradation processes such as thermokarst, thermo-denudation and thermo-erosion are actively shaping modern periglacial landscapes. Retrogressive thaw slumps – {{also referred to as}} thermo-cirques – represent a highly dynamic <b>geomorphologic</b> <b>feature</b> in ice-rich permafrost regions. These rapidly forming landforms consist of a steep headwall surrounding a gently inclined slump floor where sediment erosion and accumulation takes place simulatenously and develop as a result of rapid permafrost thaw over several decades. Thaw slumps are commonly found in permafrost areas with near-surface, thick ground-ice layers that are susceptible to thermo-denudation and subsequent mass displacement through cryogenic landslides (Leibman et al., 2008). Thaw slumps are particularly frequent along riverbanks and coastlines in the Northwest American and West Siberian Arctic, where they are typically initiated by lateral erosion of the bluff toe. In these regions, buried glacier ice (massive ground ice) bodies or ice-rich glacial till have been mapped. Given their exceptional size of up to 40 ha in area and 25 m high headwalls, so-called mega slumps in northwestern Canada represent primary terrain destabilization features with different environmental settings than surrounding areas (Lantuit et al., 2012), but are a significant source for sediment and solute delivery to adjacent lakes and streams (Kokelj et al., 2013). However, in East Siberia, retrogressive thaw slumps have been described in the syngenetic Late Pleistocene Ice Complex (Yedoma) permafrost deposits, where massive ice wedges and segregated intrasedimentary ice results in total volumetric ice contents of up to 80 - 90...|$|E
40|$|SubmittedThe Towada Caldera Volcano {{is located}} in Aomori Prefecture - Northern Honshu Island, Japan. The caldera, today filled by a lake, has {{produced}} 15, 000 years ago a complex eruption emplacing an Ignimbrite deposit topped by the lake outburst flood deposit, through which the present Oirase River cuts. This deposit has shaped the <b>geomorphologic</b> <b>feature</b> named Sambongi fan, on which Towada City extends. Based on outcrops, a few coring and radiocarbon dating, Kataoka (2011) has developed a theory tying the eruption history {{and the formation of}} the Sambongi fan. Because of the lack of extended outcrops - typical of the Japanese environment -, the authors have put the theory to the test using GPR (Ground Penetrating Radar) radargram extending along a 640 m length. The GPR used for the survey was a Pulseko-Pro with 50 MHz antennas. The software Reflex was used to process the data. The radargrams have displayed a sole unit, which the GPR could not penetrate and that the authors have interpreted as being the ignimbrite deposit. On top of this deposit a series of subhorizontal layers, with the alternation between a backset and a foreset extend between 5 m and 3 m depth. Above 3 m, the units are regular and subhorizontal. The deposit is also characterized by the extensive presence of blocks, which are located along three bands: (1) on top of the ignimbrite deposit; (2) in the units deposited by the outburst flood, between 3 and 5 m depth; (3) and in the units close to the surface, although part of these punctual elements are most certainly anthropogenic. Compared with the outcrops, the present research confirms that the material located above the ignimbrite material have been deposited by the outburst flood, creating large-sheet patterns, which have transported blocks. These sheets display backsets and foresets patterns, depending on the position of the deposit to the 'high-energy-flow tongues', which may have slightly looked like the ones observed during the 3. 11 tsunami in the Sendai Plain (Miyagi Prefecture) ...|$|E

The hilly area is the Natural Reserve of Salse di Nirano located in the Modena Apennines margin. The “Salse” are small mud volcanoes. The third study area is the Natural Oasis of Mirandola Valleys which is characterised by fluvial <b>geomorphologic</b> <b>features</b> and humid environment. Geomorphologic maps and Digital Terrain Models (DTM) have been realized.

40|$|AbstractIn the Southern Eastern Desert of Egypt, A NW–SE {{oriented}} structural graben {{extends from}} the North of Aswan to the Red Sea coast with a length of about 400 km and an average width of 30 km. The area has significant potential for development {{as it may be}} provided with water from surface and subsurface sources and is the site of prospection for petroleum. The present paper is an attempt to understand the structural evolution and genetic development of the <b>geomorphologic</b> <b>features</b> of the area and constructing presently a new geomorphological map at a scale of 1 : 250, 000 using Landsat ETM images and field checks. Available geological maps and the produced geomorphological map are digitized by using the ARC-GIS software. The same program is also used to produce a 3 D DEM for surface and subsurface features. Based on new interpretations of aeromagnetic and radiometric data, the subsurface features of the basement cover were illustrated on a 3 D map. Geological–geomorphological profiles have been constructed in different directions in the area to identify present and ancient <b>geomorphologic</b> <b>features.</b> The place and shape of subsurface deep seated NW–SE trending faults have been determined. The faults, which generated the graben have downthrows in the order of 900 – 5800 m. The surface and subsurface observations delineate the dominant downthrow of about 3750 m.

40|$|Species invasions {{are known}} to change biotic and abiotic {{ecosystem}} characteristics such as community structure, cycling of materials and dynamics of rivers. However, their ability to alter interactions between biotic and abiotic ecosystem components, in particular bio-geomorphic feedbacks and the resulting landscape configuration in tidal wetlands, such as tidal channels {{have not yet been}} demonstrated. We studied the impact of altered bio-geomorphic feedbacks on <b>geomorphologic</b> <b>features</b> (i. e. tidal wetland channels), by comparing proxies for channel network geometry (unchanneled flow lengths, fractal dimension) over time between non-invaded and invaded salt marsh habitats. The non-invaded habitats (the south of eastern Chongming Island, Yangtze estuary, China) show little change in network geometry over time with a tendency for an increased drainage density. The invaded site (salt marshes in the north of eastern Chongming Island invaded by the exotic plant species Spartina alterniflora) showed a decreasing tendency in channel drainage density throughout and after the species invasion. This suggests that species invasions might not only affect biotic ecosystem characteristics, but also their ability to change bio-geomorphic feedback loops, potentially leading to changes in existing <b>geomorphologic</b> <b>features</b> and therefore landscape configuration. Our results further suggest that the species invasion also altered sediment composition. Based on observations we propose a mechanism explaining the change in channel drainage density by an alteration in plant properties. The physical and physiological characteristics of the invading species Spartina alterniflora clearly differ from the native species Scirpus mariqueter, inducing different bio-geomorphic feedback loops leading to the observed change in salt marsh channel configuration. </p...|$|R
