5|$|Before the {{formation}} of the United States Numbered Highways, the U.S. relied on an informal network of roads, organized by various competing interests, collectively called the auto trail system. The surveyors of most trails chose either South Pass <b>in</b> <b>Wyoming</b> or a southern route through New Mexico to traverse the Rocky Mountains. Both options were less formidable than the higher mountain passes in Colorado, but left the state without a transcontinental artery. When the planners of the Lincoln Highway also decided to cross the Rockies <b>in</b> <b>Wyoming,</b> officials pressed for a loop to branch from the main route in Nebraska, enter Colorado, and return to the main route <b>in</b> <b>Wyoming.</b> While the Lincoln Highway was briefly routed this way, the loop proved impractical and was soon removed.|$|E

5|$|In March 1892, the cattlemen sent {{agents to}} Texas from Cheyenne and Idaho to recruit gunmen and finally {{carry out their}} plans for exterminating the homesteaders. The cattle barons have always used hired guns from Texas to take out {{suspected}} rustlers and scare away the nesters <b>in</b> <b>Wyoming.</b> One particular act of violence perpetrated by the Texans was recounted by cowboy John J. Baker, where the Texans ambushed and killed nine trappers whom they mistook for rustlers in Big Dry Creek, Wyoming. They received a $450 bonus for the slaughter.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the large}} {{ranching}} outfits <b>in</b> <b>Wyoming</b> were organized as the Wyoming Stock Growers Association (the WSGA) and gathered socially as the Cheyenne Club in Cheyenne, Wyoming.

5|$|The WSGA, led by Frank Wolcott (WSGA Member {{and large}} North Platte rancher), hired gunmen with the {{intention}} of eliminating alleged rustlers in Johnson County and breaking up the NWFSGA. By that time, prominent names <b>in</b> <b>Wyoming</b> started taking sides. Acting Governor Amos W. Barber supported the cattlemen, who blamed the small ranchers and homesteaders for the criminal activity in the state, while former cowboy and sheriff of Buffalo (the county seat of Johnson County), Red Angus, supported the homesteaders, who believed that the cattle barons were stealing their land.|$|E
5|$|The {{end of the}} Johnson County War also {{marked the}} end of the open range <b>in</b> <b>Wyoming.</b> By 1893, the WSGA was opened to the other small ranchers and farmers, finally ending their {{monopoly}} and control over Wyoming business interests. Previous practices of the WSGA, such as vigilantism and confiscation of cattle were finally stopped. Many prominent leaders of the Association such as Frank Wolcott, Frank M. Canton and Tom Smith later left the area.|$|E
