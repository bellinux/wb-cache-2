The drug cures their Alzheimer's, but also allows them to see the spirits {{of people who have}} died in the nursing home and channel them into existence. In this state, the spirits assault and murder the orderlies that have looked <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>them</b> and treated them poorly while they were patients. When a patient overdoses on the drug, the spirits once again attack Charters, trapping her and Mulder in the bathroom, which begins flooding.|$|E
5|$|For {{short-range}} missile (throwing) weapons, a Roman infantryman {{would probably}} had either a long throwing-spear {{or two or}} three short javelins (lanceae) and half a dozen plumbatae (weighted darts) with an effective range of about 30m. Ammianus talks of a variety of missiles being thrown by the Alamanni in the battle: spicula (a kind of long pilum-type javelin, also known as an angon), verruta missilia (short throwing-spears) and ferratae arundines (probably darts and franciscas: throwing-axes). Overall, there appears little difference in the throwing-missile capability of the contenders. Ammianus indicates that the Roman infantry ranks were obliged to hold their shields above their heads for much of the time due to the volume of missiles raining <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E

25|$|Forest's tactic {{was simply}} to run Fort Diamond into the {{privateer}} {{at a rate of}} about nine knots. As Fort Diamond bore <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>them,</b> the schooner's crew fired a broadside and discharged some small arms before all 50 or 60 crewmen jumped overboard and swam ashore. (The shore battery, not entirely distracted, also fired on Fort Diamond.) The impact of Fort Diamond hitting the privateer broke the chain that anchored the privateer to shore; the boarding party then cut two cables to free her. Fort Diamonds casualties amounted to two men wounded. The privateer turned out to be the Mosambique, armed with ten 18-pounder carronades, though she was pierced for 14 cannon. She was from Guadeloupe, provisioned for a three-month cruise and was under the command of Citizen Vallentes.|$|E

25|$|An {{economic}} transition {{occurred during}} this period, {{due to the}} diversity of the service sector being far greater than any other previous or contemporary society, and the high degree of economic integration between the labour force and the economy. Islamic society also experienced a change in attitude towards manual labour. In previous civilizations such as ancient Greece and in contemporary civilizations such as early medieval Europe, intellectuals saw manual labour in a negative light and looked <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>them</b> with contempt. This resulted in technological stagnation as they did not see the need for machinery to replace manual labour. In the Islamic world, however, manual labour was seen in a far more positive light, as intellectuals such as the Brethren of Purity likened them to a participant in the act of creation, while Ibn Khaldun alluded to the benefits of manual labour to the progress of society.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Willich wheeled to {{the north}} and began {{crushing}} the flank of Anderson's division. Willich's success assisted Beatty's brigade to get to the top. The two brigades first drove off Brig. Gen. Arthur M. Manigault's men and continued rolling north. As they came up the ridge, the Union brigades of Turchin, Van Derveer, and Phelps (who was killed near the crest) added their weight to the assault against the Confederate brigades of Brig. Gens. Zachariah C. Deas, Alfred J. Vaughan, and John K. Jackson. Some Confederate soldiers resisted stubbornly, but many panicked and ran when they realized that Union troops were bearing <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>them</b> from the flank. Often, the Southern infantry fled before the supporting artillerists could escape with their cannons. In this manner, Anderson's entire division and Cheatham's left flank brigades of Brig. Gens. Jackson and Moore were routed. The northward Federal advance was only stopped by the stout fighting of Walthall's brigade and nightfall. Cheatham, Gist, Stevenson, and Cleburne were able to get their divisions away more or less intact, although the Confederate soldiers were demoralized and chagrined by their defeat.|$|E
25|$|Owain {{also scored}} {{his first major}} victory {{in the field in}} May or June, at Mynydd Hyddgen near Pumlumon. Owain and his army of a few hundred were camped {{at the bottom of the}} Hyddgen Valley when about fifteen hundred English and Flemish {{settlers}} from Pembrokeshire ('little England beyond Wales'), charged <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>them.</b> Owain rallied his army and fought back, killing 200. The situation was sufficiently serious for the King to assemble another punitive expedition. This time he attacked in October through central Wales. From Shrewsbury and Hereford Castle, Henry IV's forces drove through Powys toward the Strata Florida Abbey. The Cistercian house was known to be sympathetic towards Owain and Henry intended to remind them of their loyalties and prevent the revolt from spreading any further south. After much harassment by Owain's forces he reached Strata Florida. Henry was in no mood to be merciful. His army partially destroyed the abbey and executed a monk suspected of bearing arms against him. However, he failed to engage Owain's forces in any large numbers. Owain's forces harassed him and engaged in hit-and-run tactics on his supply chain but refused to fight in the open. Henry's army was forced to retreat. They arrived at Worcester on 28 October 1401 with little to claim for their efforts. The year came to end with the Battle of Tuthill, an inconclusive battle fought during Owain's siege of Caernarfon Castle on 2 November 1401.|$|E

500|$|Although he was {{the subject}} of severe {{criticism}} by Bonaparte, historian William Laird Clowes, writing in 1900, considered that Ganteaume had done well to prevent his squadron being overwhelmed by the British, particularly during the attempt to land at Benghazi when he almost suffered a repeat of the situation at the Nile in 1798, with his ships anchored close inshore as a British fleet bore <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>them.</b> This precarious position, described by Clowes as a [...] "mad idea", was not one of Ganteaume's choosing: it had been dictated by Bonaparte before he departed Toulon for the second time. Clowes considered that Ganteaume's [...] "caution was, after all, less dangerous to his country than the rash and infatuated naval strategy of his master". Ganteaume did not hold another sea command, but was made commander of the Mediterranean and governor of Toulon following the Peace of Amiens in March 1802.|$|E
500|$|Avatar: The Last Airbender was co-created and {{produced}} by Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko at Nickelodeon Animation Studios in Burbank, California. Its animation was primarily done by three South Korean studios: JM Animation, DR Movie, and MOI Animation. According to Konietzko, {{the series was}} conceived {{in the spring of}} 2001 when he took an old sketch of a balding, middle-aged man and imagined the character as a child. He drew the character herding bison in the sky, and showed the sketch to DiMartino. At the time, DiMartino was watching a documentary about explorers trapped at the South Pole. Konietzko described their early development of the concept: [...] "There's an air guy along with these water people trapped in a snowy wasteland ... and maybe some fire people are pressing <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>them</b> ..." [...] The co-creators successfully pitched the idea to Nickelodeon vice president and executive producer Eric Coleman two weeks later. The series was introduced to the public in a teaser reel at Comic-Con 2004, and premiered on February 21, 2005.|$|E
500|$|The {{circulatory system}} of the giraffe has several adaptations for its great height. Its heart, which can weigh more than [...] and {{measures}} about [...] long, must generate approximately double the blood pressure required for a human to maintain {{blood flow to the}} brain. As such, the wall of the heart can be as thick as [...] Giraffes have unusually high heart rates for their size, at 150 beats per minute. When the animal lowers its head the blood rushes down fairly unopposed and a rete mirabile in the upper neck, with its large cross sectional area, prevents excess blood flow to the brain. When it raises again, the blood vessels constrict and direct blood into the brain so the animal does not faint. The jugular veins contain several (most commonly seven) valves to prevent blood flowing back into the head from the inferior vena cava and right atrium while the head is lowered. Conversely, the blood vessels in the lower legs are under great pressure because of the weight of fluid pressing <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>them.</b> To solve this problem, the skin of the lower legs is thick and tight; preventing too much blood from pouring into them.|$|E

500|$|The Browns {{improved}} under Davis, and contended {{for a spot}} in the 2001 playoffs until a loss in the 15th {{week against}} Jacksonville that featured {{one of the most controversial}} calls in team history. As time expired in the fourth quarter with the Jaguars ahead 15–10, Couch led a drive into Jacksonville territory. On a fourth-down play that the team needed to convert to stay in the game, Couch threw to receiver Quincy Morgan over the middle. Morgan appeared to bobble the ball before grasping it firmly as he hit the ground. After the pass was ruled complete and Couch spiked the ball to stop the clock, officials reversed Morgan's catch on a Jacksonville challenge. As Davis pleaded his case that the play could not be reviewed because another play had been run, frustrated fans began throwing plastic beer bottles onto the field. Amid the bedlam, later named [...] "bottlegate", officials ended the game with 48 seconds on the clock and left the field as objects rained <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>them</b> from the stands. After most of the fans had left, NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue called and ordered the game to be completed. Jacksonville ran down the clock for the win, and the Browns finished the season at 7–9.|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{after the}} French order to set sail was abandoned, the British fleet began rapidly {{approaching}} once more. Brueys, now expecting {{to come under}} attack that night, ordered each of his ships to place springs on their anchor cables and prepare for action. He sent the Alerte ahead, which passed close to the leading British ships and then steered sharply to the west over the shoal, {{in the hope that}} the ships of the line might follow and become grounded. None of Nelson's captains fell for the ruse and the British fleet continued undeterred. At 17:30, Nelson hailed one of his two leading ships, HMS Zealous under Captain Samuel Hood, which had been racing Goliath to be the first to fire on the French. The admiral ordered Hood to establish the safest course into the harbour. The British had no charts of the depth or shape of the bay, except a rough sketch map Swiftsure had obtained from a merchant captain, an inaccurate British atlas on Zealous, and a 35-year-old French map aboard Goliath. Hood replied that he would take careful soundings as he advanced to test the depth of the water, and that, [...] "If you will allow the honour of leading you into battle, I will keep the lead going." [...] Shortly afterwards, Nelson paused to speak with the brig HMS Mutine, whose commander, Lieutenant Thomas Hardy, had seized some maritime pilots from a small Alexandrine vessel. As Vanguard came to a stop, the following ships slowed. This caused a gap to open up between Zealous and Goliath and the rest of the fleet. To counter this effect, Nelson ordered HMS Theseus under Captain Ralph Miller to pass his flagship and join Zealous and Goliath in the vanguard. By 18:00, the British fleet was again under full sail, Vanguard sixth in the line of ten ships as Culloden trailed behind to the north and [...] Alexander and Swiftsure hastened to catch up to the west. Following the rapid change from a loose formation to a rigid line of battle both fleets raised their colours; each British ship added additional Union Flags in its rigging in case its main flag was shot away. At 18:20, as Goliath and Zealous rapidly bore <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>them,</b> the leading French ships Guerrier and Conquérant opened fire.|$|E
500|$|A promotional video, {{directed}} by Dawn of the New Assembly/H5, was produced {{to accompany the}} release of [...] "Juxtapozed with U" [...] as a single. According to Gruff Rhys the band made separate videos for Rings Around the Worlds three singles as they saw the videos included on the DVD release of the album as [...] "pure art" [...] whereas they needed promotional music videos that were more like adverts for the songs. The video is computer generated and begins with stylised shots of traffic moving across the Brooklyn Bridge, New York. The camera zooms in to show a man and women, who appear as thermal images, driving one of the cars. The man checks his watch and puts a CD in the car's stereo before the video switches to an outside shot of the vehicle driving through a tunnel and a busy street. Another street is shown with many neon signs, including one which says [...] "Broadway" [...] and another with features the legend [...] "Juxtapozed with U, Super Furry Animals". The couple continue driving until they reach the Guggenheim Art Museum where they park beside a valet who opens the car's passenger door. The next shot shows the museum's interior exhibit which consists of a black and neon blue grids with various mathematical symbols and currency signs on the walls. The couple talk {{to one of the}} crowd in the club before leaving the building and walking past the valet to a lift which takes them to a party on the roof of a skyscraper. Shots of a swimming pool on the skyscraper's roof and the couple kissing are intercut with images of fire engines driving through the streets past the Chrysler Building. These fire engines arrive below the skyscraper where the party is taking place and several people, including the couple, look <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>them</b> from above. Firemen are shown fighting a blaze on several floors of the skyscraper and a helicopter is seen flying to rescue the partygoers. In the last few seconds of the video the skyscraper explodes and the helicopter crashes into the roof of the building.
