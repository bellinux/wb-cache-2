5|$|On {{the morning}} of 14 December 1955, during the stations' construction, {{switchgear}} exploded in the South station's substation, closing down the generators. Dunston power station could not take the <b>extra</b> <b>load</b> and it also shut down, creating a total blackout on Tyneside. Around 400,000 people were affected by the fault, including 20,000 miners trapped in over a hundred collieries. Power was fully reconnected by that evening. but the failure caused an interruption of work and services worth more than £1,000,000, {{as well as the}} loss of 300 megawatts of electricity.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{plans for}} the I-94 overlap in downtown Saint Paul {{did not include the}} right-side ramps that eliminate weaving. The ramp from I-35E northbound to I-94 eastbound was added when I-35E was finally completed in 1990, and a five-year construction project that was completed in 1992 added the ramp from I-35E southbound to I-94 westbound, as well as a direct ramp from I-35E southbound to the Lafayette Freeway (US52) to avoid weaving across I-94 east. This project was done because the old Spaghetti Junction at the east split of I-35E and I-94 {{would not be able to}} handle the <b>extra</b> <b>load</b> from the completed I-35E parkway.|$|E
25|$|F-INSAS is the Indian Army's {{principal}} infantry modernisation programme, {{which aims}} to modernise the army's 465 infantry and paramilitary battalions by 2020. The programme aims to upgrade the infantry with a multi-calibre rifle with an under-barrel grenade launcher and bulletproof jackets and helmets. The helmet would include a visor, flashlight, thermal sensors, night vision devices and a miniature computer with audio headsets. It will also include a new lightweight and waterproof uniform, which would help the soldier in carrying <b>extra</b> <b>load</b> and fighting in an NBC environment.|$|E

50|$|In {{chemical}} pulp mills, the bark introduces unwanted contaminants such as calcium, silica and aluminium that cause scaling and give an <b>extra</b> <b>loading</b> for the chemical recovery system. Birch bark contains betulin, a terpenoid that easily creates deposits in a pulp mill.|$|R
25|$|By 1939 the TPV {{was deemed}} ready, after 47 {{technically}} different and incrementally improved experimental prototypes {{had been built}} and tested. These prototypes used aluminium and magnesium parts and had water-cooled flat twin engines with front-wheel drive. The seats were hammocks hung from the roof by wires. The suspension system, designed by Alphonse Forceau, used front leading arms and rear trailing arms, connected to eight torsion bars beneath the rear seat: a bar for the front axle, one for the rear axle, an intermediate bar for each side, and an overload bar for each side. The front axle was connected to its torsion bars by cable. The overload bar came into play when the car had three people on board, two {{in the front and}} one in the rear, to support the <b>extra</b> <b>load</b> of a fourth passenger and fifty kilograms of luggage.|$|E
25|$|The diesel {{alternator}} {{sets for}} the carriages provided 3-phase 415-volt alternating current power. Only 1 phase {{was required for}} operation, so the other two phases were available for backup or for load-sharing across other carriages - useful because the ACN and BN cars required 28kW to operate and the BRN, with its additional functions, 40kW. To accommodate the <b>extra</b> <b>load,</b> the ACN and BN were upgraded midway through construction to a 35kVA supply, and the programming reworked so that the BRN would not power adjacent cars. If all alternators were off, then the cars {{was able to take}} power from an external 240vAC power supply. Around the same time as these modifications were made, the alternator set supports were modified to reduce vibration, and the radiator fan motors' thermal overload switches were moved to reduce unnecessary tripping. At the end of the modifications, the system was organised so that in event of a power failure, the batteries mounted under the carriages would automatically reroute all power to the lights at the ends of the train to protect from oncoming traffic. Those lights could function for over ten hours, at the expense of air-conditioning and other functions. The first six cars had plastic fuel pipes near the alternator units, but that was changed from car 7 onwards.|$|E
500|$|When braking is {{increasing}} {{the center of}} mass m may move forward relative to the front wheel, as the rider moves forward relative to the bike, and, if the bike has suspension on the front wheel, the front forks compress under load, changing the bike geometry.

500|$|Revisions {{were made}} to the {{suspension}} over the sedan's setup. These included stiffer springs, anti-roll bar changes and an additional ball-joint in the rear suspension to handle the <b>extra</b> <b>load.</b> Weight increases by [...] over the sedan.

2500|$|Whatever its {{ultimate}} source, the initial {{version of the}} Fokker synchronization gear (see illustration) very closely followed, not Schneider's patent, as claimed by many (including Schneider himself) but Saulnier's. Like the Saulnier patent, Fokker's gear was designed to actively fire the gun rather than interrupt it, and (like the later Vickers-Challenger gear developed for the RFC) it followed Saulnier in taking its primary mechanical drive from the oil pump of a rotary engine. [...] The [...] "transmission" [...] between the motor and the gun was by a version of Saulnier's reciprocating push-rod. The main difference was that instead of the push rod passing directly from the engine to the gun, which would have required a tunnel through the firewall and fuel tank (as shown in the Saulnier patent drawings), it was driven by a shaft joining the oil pump to a small cam {{at the top of}} the fuselage. This eventually proved unsatisfactory, as the oil pump's mechanical drive spindle was insufficiently robust to take the <b>extra</b> <b>load.</b>|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to limits, test procedure has certain finer points too. For instance, the mass emission test measurements done in g/km on a chassis dynamometer requires a loading of 100 kg weight in {{addition to}} unloaded car weight in Europe. In India, BS-III norms require an <b>extra</b> <b>loading</b> of 150 kg weight to achieve the desired inertia weight mainly due to road conditions here.|$|R
40|$|Leg {{extensor}} muscle characteristics, {{running speed}} and serum testosterone were studied in sixteen males and twelve female sprinters. The rise of {{center of gravity}} was measured during squat jumps executed without (SJ) and with <b>extra</b> <b>loads</b> (SJbm), counter movement jump (CMJ) and continuous jumping (CJ) for 5 s. Nine females and nine males performed also half-squat exercises with <b>extra</b> <b>loads</b> ranging from 50 % to 200 % of the subject's body mass (bm). Average mechanical power (P), force (F) and velocity (v) were calculated and measured during half-squat exercises using the ErgopowerÂ®. Total serum testosterone (TT) was determined in venous blood. In women, 60 m dash, SJ, CMJ and CJ performances were significantly lower (P< 0. 001) than men. Gender differences were not found in F during half-squat exercises and in SJbm. Women demonstrated significantly higher ratios CMJ:SJ and CJ:SJ than men. With loads 50 - 100 % of bm men demonstrated greater v and P than women. It was suggested that high testosterone level in men might be a factor ensured superiority in explosive power and speed, but not in muscle strength adjusted to body mass...|$|R
2500|$|By 1904 {{the canal}} company {{had decided to}} abandon the arm as a navigation. The top [...] were again repuddled, the water level was lowered, {{and all of the}} water flowing along it was fed into Wilstone {{reservoir}}. This put an <b>extra</b> <b>load</b> on the pumps at Tringford, as the Wilstone reservoir is at a lower level than the Tringford one. A pipeline was therefore laid from a sump at Drayton Beauchamp to the Tring pumping station, along the bed of the disused canal, so that water arrived at the pumps at a higher level. The new system was still not satisfactory, due to the large variations in flow along the feeder, and it was redesigned in 1912. After reconstruction, the water was pumped directly into the main line, with surplus water flowing into Tringford reservoir. The section of canal between Wendover and Drayton Beauchamp remained in water, resembling a chalk stream. In 1917, German prisoners of war built a railway bridge over it near Wendover. The standard gauge railway line was used to remove timber from Wendover Woods, and also supplied Halton Camp, a base for the Royal Flying Corps, which subsequently became RAF Halton. The line was in use until 1963, and the bridge was demolished as a training exercise by sappers in 1965. A footbridge was subsequently erected in the same location.|$|E
