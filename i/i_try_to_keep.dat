500|$|News of Barrymore's {{success in}} Hamlet piqued the {{interest}} of Warner Bros., which signed him as {{the lead in the}} 1924 film Beau Brummel. Unhappy in his marriage, Barrymore– aged 40 at the time– sought solace elsewhere and had an affair with his 17-year-old co-star Mary Astor during filming. Although the film was not an unqualified success, the cast, including Barrymore, was generally praised. Around this time, Barrymore acquired the nickname [...] "the Great Profile", as posters and photographs of him tended to favor the left-hand side. He later said: [...] "The right side of my face looks like a fried egg. The left side has features that {{are to be found in}} almost any normal anthropological specimen, and those are the apples <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> on top of the barrel." ...|$|E
500|$|Richie Egan is the {{principal}} songwriter but refers to the overall band as Jape. This came about following his first few solo performances when he realised he did not wish people to consider him a singer-songwriter {{but as part of}} a band. Egan has been part of many bands from a young age, and spent his youth experimenting with four-track tape recorders and sounds. He was previously a member of the bands Black Belt Jones and Sir Killalot. After leaving Black Belt Jones he {{went on to become the}} bassist in the instrumental rock band The Redneck Manifesto of which he is still a member. He has occasionally toured as part of David Kitt’s live band, as well as in Conor J. O'Brien's band Villagers as a bass player and with his bandmates in The Redneck Manifesto. By 2003 Egan had developed Jape after spending a week at the family home of fellow Redneck, Niall Byrne, in Avoca, County Wicklow. [...] "I’ve been playing in bands since I was really young but I’ve always been messing around on the side with four-track tape recorders, experimenting with sounds". [...] "The chance to turn this “messing around” into something concrete came about when he was given the opportunity to decamp to Avoca, where fellow Redneck, Niall’s family own a house. Richie used it as a studio for a week." [...] "I listen to a lot of different styles of music, so <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> my finger in as many pies as possible. It keeps me interested," [...] he laughs." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{series is}} written by Fintan Ryan, {{produced}} by Helen Gregory {{and directed by}} Martin Dennis. The series itself is made by production company World Productions. Mangan and Ashfield had previously worked together early in their careers, providing voices for an animated series of Watership Down. Ashfield claimed that on set, she [...] "struggled to keep a straight face most of the time." [...] She also said that her part made her more aware of her health. She {{said in an interview}} with The Times that she hoped the show would make, [...] "people think twice about binge drinking." [...] When asked if the role made her more , she said, [...] "I watch what I drink and <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> myself healthy." ...|$|E

6000|$|Soon the dragon's {{horse was}} heard panting behind, and he cried out, 'Oh, my brother, {{do not go}} so fast! I shall sink to the earth if <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> up with you.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I know he is, and <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> him decent, but I forget, and {{he hates}} to be fixed, and Miss Bat doesn't care, and father laughs when I talk about it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I didn't do it; upon my soul I didn't do it; and <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> HIM {{from doing}} it; I did, as God is my witness. He did it alone.' ...|$|R

60|$|It is very comic the {{way people}} have of being so {{particular}} about the second and fourth commandments, and breaking all the rest with the greatest comfort. For me, <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> all the rest rather carefully, and let the second and fourth take care of themselves.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{know whether}} {{you wanted me to}} go," [...] she said to Dartrey, [...] "but I cannot sit and listen to that man talk. <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> myself free from prejudices, but there are exceptions. Miller is my pet one. Tell me exactly what he came about? Something disagreeable, I am sure?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are right. Mr. Edward's note {{should be}} kept sacred, for in it the poor boy has laid bare his heart to me.

6000|$|... "They {{have killed}} two cows which <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> here, and one young horse--a foal you call him, I think; and now I have no cattle remaining, {{they are so}} bad." ...|$|R
60|$|It was now growing dark, and {{the streets}} were filled with people hurrying homeward. <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> as close <b>to</b> Mr. Harrison as possible, but {{something}} in a window attracted my attention, and when I looked around he was gone.|$|R
6000|$|Lucy {{chatted with}} me freely, and seemed quite {{unconscious}} that anything had happened. <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> her amused and interested. When her mother {{came up to}} see her, she {{did not seem to}} notice any change whatever, but said to me gratefully, ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Lesher {{is not the}} man I {{thought he}} would, be," [...] said Captain Blossom. [...] "If he insists on getting drunk he will surely cause us {{a good deal of}} trouble, and if <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the liquor from him he will get ugly.

6000|$|I had {{not been}} a minute by myself, before my anger cooled. <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> it hot; <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> {{remember}} that he had aspersed my nation in calling me a [...] "heartless Frenchwoman." [...] No! {{it was not to be}} done. In spite of myself, I repented what I had said to him.|$|R
60|$|PHOEBE (more firmly). A woman {{must never}} tell. You {{went away to}} the great battles. I was left to fight in a little one. Women have a flag to fly, Mr. Brown, as well as men, and old maids have a flag as well as women. <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> mine flying.|$|R
60|$|When {{you give}} your lectures at the Working Men's College, is it your habit to refer to special {{pictures}} in the National Gallery, or to special works {{of art in the}} British Museum?--Never; <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> whatever instruction I give bearing upon what is easily accessible to the workman, or what he can see at the moment. I do not count upon his having time to go to these institutions; I like to put the thing in his hand, and have it about.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, child, it is VERY bad, {{and you may}} thank your {{stars that}} <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> you from it by feeding you on plain food. At my age, and {{suffering}} as I do, the best of everything is needed to keep up my strength," [...] said Miss Henny, tartly. But the largest plate of pudding, with [...] "heaps of sauce," [...] went to the child this day, and when the fruit was served, an unusually small portion was put away for the invalid, who was obliged to sustain nature with frequent lunches through the day and evening.|$|E
6000|$|She still drops {{a foreign}} word into her talk now and then, {{and there is}} still a subtle foreign flavor or {{fragrance}} about even her exactest English--and long may this abide! for it has for me a charm that is very pleasant. Sometimes her English is daintily prim and bookish and captivating. She has a child's sweet tooth, but for her health's sake <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> its inspirations under cheek. She is obedient--as is proper for a titled and recognized military personage, which she is--but the chain presses sometimes. For instance, we were out for a walk, and passed by some bushes that were freighted with wild goose-berries. Her face brightened and she put her hands together and delivered herself of this speech, most feelingly: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very little, as a rule; {{and what}} <b>I</b> had <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep.</b> It was <b>to</b> {{give me a}} start in life.

5000|$|... "We put Burt Bacharach horns {{on because}} he was the master of {{break-up}} songs. I did all the string arrangements. <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> them as simple as possible. I like the way Marc Bolan used them on Children of the Revolution. People do remember string parts as separate hooklines, you know. You just don't want to use them slushily." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You know, Eb, <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> Lane in the {{settlement}} for Mabel's sake. But he wanted to work that farm.

I say, alone, for I don't count Mrs General; I don't care for her; she {{has nothing to do}} with me. But I know Fanny was {{impatient}} of me. And I don't wonder at it, or complain of it, for I am sensible that I must be in the way, though <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> out of it as well as I can. I know I am not fit company for our company. My brother William,' said the old man admiringly, 'is fit company for monarchs; but not so your uncle, my dear.

I am terrified, Amuba. Hitherto when your father has gone out to battle I have never doubted as to the result. The Persians were not foes whom brave men need dread; nor was it difficult to force the hordes passing us from the eastward toward the setting sun to respect our country, for we had the advantage in arms and discipline. But the Egyptians are terrible foes, and the arms of their king have been everywhere victorious. My heart is filled with dread at the thought of the approaching conflict, though <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> up a brave face when your father is with me, for I would not that he should deem me cowardly." ...|$|E
6000|$|It {{is no good}} pretending about it. The war {{has ended}} all that. Boon died with his age. After the war {{there will be a}} new sort of book-trade and a crop of new writers and a fresh tone, and {{everything}} will be different. This is an obituary, of more than George Boon.... I regard the outlook with profound dismay. <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> my mind off it by drilling with the Shrewsbury last line of volunteers and training down the excrescences of my physical style. When the war is over will be time enough to consider the prospects of a superannuated man of letters. We National Volunteers are now no mere soldiers on paper; we have fairly washable badges by way of uniform; we have bought ourselves dummy rifles; we have persuaded the War Office to give us a reluctant recognition on the distinct understanding that we have neither officers nor authority. In the event of an invasion, I understand, we are to mobilize and ... do quite a number of useful things. But until there is an invasion in actual progress, nothing is to be decided more precisely than what this whiff of printer's shrapnel, these four full stops, conveys....|$|E
60|$|I {{was afraid}} to think either of sex or (what I have always found inseparable from a kind of sexual emotion) beauty.

60|$|Without an instant's notice he made {{straight}} at me. He had a dinner {{knife in his}} hand, and as I saw he was dangerous, <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the table between us.
