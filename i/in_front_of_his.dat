5|$|Burnside {{was noted}} for his unusual facial hair, joining strips of hair <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> ears to his {{mustache}} {{but with the}} chin clean-shaven; the word burnsides was coined to describe this style. The syllables were later reversed to give sideburns.|$|E
5|$|A point-per-game pace in 1984–85 (66points in 67games) earned MacInnis {{his first}} All-Star Game appearance, playing <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{hometown}} fans at the 1985 game in Calgary.

He was {{a finalist for}} the James Norris Memorial Trophy as top defenceman in the league in three consecutive seasons, 1989, 1990 and 1991, but failed to win the award each time.|$|E

5|$|After {{a lengthy}} time, {{it seems as}} if the dog is cured, in that he is now {{friendly}} towards Keys. Julie confronts the dog's original owner, who has come to claim him, and who presumably trained him to attack black people. She angrily tells him <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> grandchildren, who only know the dog as a loving family pet, that the dog has been cured by a black man.|$|E
5|$|During the {{construction}} of the Northwestern Turnpike through Romney, the state superintendent for the project, Angus William McDonald, proposed building the thoroughfare through White's garden <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> residence. White won an appeal in court which caused the turnpike to be rerouted, thus creating the present curve on East Main Street in front of White's former residence.|$|E
5|$|Gilchrist {{made his}} Test match {{debut in the}} First Test against Pakistan at the Gabba in Brisbane in November 1999 {{becoming}} the 381st Australian Test cricketer. He replaced Healy, who was dropped after a run of poor form, despite the incumbent's entreaties to the selectors to allow him a farewell game <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> home crowd. Gilchrist's entry into the Test arena coincided with a dramatic rise in Australia's fortunes. Up to this point, they had played eight Tests in 1999, winning and losing three.|$|E

5|$|Ney now had two problems: he {{expected}} support columns from Soult's division on both flanks to arrive momentarily {{and he did}} not know that the Austrians had arrived in force, directly <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> center. Although Roget's brigade was strong enough to prevent the Austrians from flanking the position, Gazan's brigade was too weak to resist the superior Austrian force, which was growing visibly stronger as Hotze's troops continued to arrive at the forward line and throw themselves into the fray.|$|E
5|$|On December 30, 1905, Frank Steunenberg {{was killed}} by an {{explosion}} <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> Caldwell, Idaho home. A former governor of Idaho, Steunenberg had clashed with the WFM in previous strikes. Harry Orchard, a former WFM member who had once acted as WFM President Charles Moyer's bodyguard was arrested for the crime, and evidence was found in his hotel room. Famed Pinkerton detective James McParland, who had infiltrated and helped to destroy the Molly Maguires, was placed {{in charge of the}} investigation.|$|E
5|$|Out <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> army, Cornwallis {{placed a}} {{skirmish}} line of Hessian jägers and British light infantry.

As the British approached, Fermoy returned to Trenton, drunk. Colonel Edward Hand took over his command.|$|E

5|$|The result meant Lotterer, Tréluyer and Fässler {{remained}} {{the leaders of}} the Drivers' Championship on 80 points, 20 ahead of Tandy, and a further two <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> co-drivers Bamber and Hülkenberg.

5|$|The teams {{returned}} to Melbourne {{for the fifth}} Test, where Woodfull scored 102 and 35 <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> home crowd as Australia won by five wickets. It {{was the first time}} that Woodfull had played in a winning Test, after ten matches. He hit three centuries in the series, with 491 runs at 54.56 despite which Australia lost the Ashes 4–1. Woodfull ended the entire season with 854 runs at 85.40.|$|E
5|$|After the drawn Second Test, Simpson {{contracted}} chickenpox, so Booth {{was again}} captain for the Third Test <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> home {{crowd at the}} SCG. It was an extra burden, as Booth had made only 49 runs {{in the first two}} Tests; his teammates felt that their captain had been too anxious following his struggles against Griffith in the Caribbean. However, there was to be no fairytale for Booth, who later admitted to being in psychological disarray; he was unaware if the rolling done on the pitch after the toss was legal, and Philpott arrived late and ran onto the field just as play was starting.|$|E

5|$|At 22:30 the fog {{lifted and}} Kouma {{saw that a}} North Korean pontoon bridge was being laid across the river {{directly}} <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> position. Kouma's four vehicles attacked this structure, and after about a minute of heavy fire the bridge collapsed, and the ponton boats used to hold the bridge in place were sunk. At 23:00 a small arms fight flared around {{the left side of}} A Company north of the tanks. This gunfire had lasted only two or three minutes when the A Company roadblock squads near the tanks received word by field telephone that the company was withdrawing to the original ridge positions and that they should do likewise.|$|E
5|$|Despite several {{problems}} {{during the third}} session on Saturday morning, Lewis Hamilton was fastest, setting a time of 1:12.070, just over {{a tenth of a}} second <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> teammate. Earlier in the session, he needed to return to pit lane due to a gear-selection problem which had caused him to temporarily stop on track and later spun at turn eleven. Vettel was again third fastest, more than six-tenths of a second behind Hamilton. He was followed by teammate Räikkönen, Valtteri Bottas and Nico Hülkenberg in the Force India, all more than a second slower than Hamilton.|$|E
5|$|Further unrest was {{triggered}} when an Imperial slave named Stephanus was robbed while travelling near Beth-horon. Troops sent by Cumanus {{to arrest the}} leading men of the nearby villages began plundering the area. One of them, finding {{a copy of the}} Torah, destroyed it in view of the villagers while shouting blasphemies. Angered by this insult to God and to the Jewish religion, a crowd of Jews confronted Cumanus at Caesarea Maritima, demanding that the guilty party should be punished. This time the governor acted decisively and ordered that the soldier responsible should be beheaded <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> accusers, temporarily restoring the calm.|$|E
