5000|$|The exam {{is divided}} into written and oral sections. The written section {{consists}} of three tests. The first one is Italian and is identical nationwide: {{students are required to}} write an essay, an article on a given topic, but they can also choose to analyse and comment on a text (usually a poem). The second test changes according to the type of school the student attended, so it can be {{on a wide variety of}} different subjects, such as Pedagogy and Psychology, Mathematics, Foreign Language, Latin, and Ancient Greek. It is identical nationwide for schools of the same type. The subject is decided by the Ministry a few months before the exam: it is almost always the same for some types of school (for example Mathematics for liceo scientifico) and it is chosen among the [...] "written" [...] subjects for other schools (for example, it is chosen between Latin and Ancient Greek for liceo classico). Finally, the third test is about four selected subjects of the last year, and it is written by every single examining commission. The student doesn't know before which subjects are in the text. The interview section is to assess that the student has really reached a personal and intellectual maturity concerning the various subjects of his or her last school year; the examining commission is supposed to ask about every subject, but has <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> the candidate is also able to discuss about a variety of themes explaining and justifying his or her opinion; also, in recent years has become customary for each student to prepare a short essay (tesina) on a free topic, intended to showcase the ability to cover different sides of the topic using extensively the notions and methods learnt in school.|$|E

He bowled well but {{when it came time to}} pick the team for the fourth test, Matthews was overlooked in favour of May.

5000|$|On 4 July 2015, Green {{signed a}} two-year {{contract}} with League Two club Luton Town, linking back up with manager John Still who had first signed him at Dagenham & Redbridge in 2009. He made his debut in a 1-1 draw away to Accrington Stanley {{on the opening}} day of 2015-16. Green scored his first goals for Luton in consecutive matches when he opened the scoring in a 2-1 win at home to Leyton Orient in the Football League Trophy on 1 September, before netting the final goal in a 3-1 win away to Cambridge United four days later. However, he fell out of favour after Still felt he lacked [...] "urgency" [...] and [...] "passion". In his first league appearance for almost two months, Green opened the scoring in a 2-0 win over Barnet at Kenilworth Road on 14 November. He scored his fourth goal of the season 10 days later in a 4-3 defeat at home to Carlisle United. Green netted a penalty kick after a foul on Craig Mackail-Smith in another 4-3 defeat, on this occasion at home to Northampton Town on 12 December. Green scored his fifth goal in 10 league starts for Luton in a 3-2 win away to Exeter City a week later. On 30 April 2016, Green suffered a double leg break during a 2-0 defeat away to Northampton Town. He finished 2015-16 with 30 appearances and six goals. Green missed the entire 2016-17 season {{as a result of the}} injury, and was released when his contract expired at the end of the season.

5000|$|One of the NESS team's more {{extensive}} investigations was of Ed and Lorraine Warren who also live in Connecticut. According to Steven Novella, [...] "the Warrens was interesting because for us, {{they were the}} big fish, right? They were the most famous paranormal proponents in our region. They were a little intimidating to us. We really thought, “Oh, we’ve really <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> we’re prepared and really get some experience and know what we talking about before we take them on.... We totally over-estimated them.... They’re presented as serious researchers who actually know what they’re doing. Then you meet them and, '“Oh, my god.”' ...The guy {{had no idea what}} he was doing, didn't know the first thing about anything relevant to paranormal investigation or ghost phenomenon." [...] Novella and DeAngelis asked and were promised that they would be allowed to follow along on one of the Warren's investigations, but were repeatably turned down with different excuses. The Warrens have a [...] "museum" [...] in their basement that they claim are possessed, they were warned not to touch the Raggedy Ann doll as they might become possessed themselves. Steven Novella states that it was [...] "full of off-the-shelf Halloween junk, dolls and toys". They reported that the Warren's refused to allow NESS to examine their best evidence for the ghosts and demons that they claim to find at their [...] "investigations". In their opinion, NESS believes that the Warren's were more interested in protecting their reputation and not scientific advancement. When confronted about their lack of scientific rigor, the Warrens typically balked, Ed Warren stated '“you can’t have scientific evidence for a spiritual phenomenon.”' [...] At the conclusion of the NESS investigation of the Warrens, Steven Novella writes, [...] "What they are really hunting for are anomalies - anything even slightly strange. In the ghost-hunting world, anomaly = ghost. Scientific investigation does not enter into the equation." ...|$|R

30|$|Instructors {{with the}} {{greatest}} normalized gains between pre- and post-development interviews display the most significant changes in their responses to interview questions. Amy, Karen, Hilary, Mark, and Lauren all show a 40  % or greater normalized gain between their pre- and post-development TBI interviews (Fig.  2). We can gain some insight into individual instructors changing beliefs by examining Amy and Hilary’s responses to TBI questions. These two instructors exhibited the broadest change between the pre- and post-development interviews. For this study, a pedagogically significant change {{is one in which}} the participants overall code for a response shifts among the three broad categories of pedagogical beliefs (instructor-centered, transitional, and student-centered) defined in Luft and Roehrig (2007). An example of a significant shift would be if an instructor initially responded to a question in a manner that received a traditional code, while their post-interview response was transitional. Amy showed significant shifts toward more student-centered beliefs in her responses to several questions. Amy described her role as a teacher in the pre-development interview stating “I’ve <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> I tell them that I struggled with certain things when I was a student” and “I try to share things with them so they realize that they are at a normal place”. Her words illustrate transitional pedagogical beliefs by focusing on establishing a welcoming and positive classroom environment. Her response shifted from transitional to student-centered in the post-development interview where she described her role as “fostering questions, having them ask questions and be really curious about the world” and she elaborates on this point stating, “I want them to be curious and I want to foster that curiosity”. Amy had instructor-centered ideas about how to decide when to move on in class during the pre-development interview. Initially she stated “I focus mostly on time constraints” and “I assign a schedule, it’s not incredibly rigid, but it is structured”. This instructor-centered focus became more student-centered in post-development because Amy incorporated feedback from students with the possibility of revisiting topics. For example, she stated “when they tell me they are still not understanding then I will build something into the future classes” and “If they [students] need an extra day to review or synthesize everything then I am okay with adding an extra day to do that”. This student-centered theme also carried over in her response to assessing learning in the classroom. In the pre-development interview, she described the process of assessing learning very transitionally “I try to arrange the course material so that things sort of repeat themselves” and she does not continually assess students, “I don’t necessarily assess students along the way…” During the post-development interview, Amy describes more student-centered practices stating “I listen to how they are communicating with their group mates” and she elaborates on this theme stating that she knew they were learning when “they were questioning each other and working through it”.|$|R
