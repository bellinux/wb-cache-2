The study analyses farmers’ varietal preference of drought tolerant maize in Southern Guinea Savannah region of Nigeria. It specifically determined the socioeconomic characteristics of farmers, identified their gender based preference for Drought Tolerant maize variety and elucidated the reasons for preference. Three-stage stratified sampling technique was used. Well-structured questionnaire was used to collect information from a total of 48 farmers. Descriptive, Ranking and LSD were used to analyse the data collected. The result of the analysis showed that majority of the male and female farmers have primary education and are youths. The result of varietal preference differs between genders in some locations Male farmers identified big cobs with <b>full</b> <b>grains,</b> big seed, and multiple cobs as the main reasons for their preference while female farmers identified yellow colour of seed, nutrient fortified seed and big cobs with <b>full</b> <b>grains</b> as the main reasons for their preference.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{cultivation}} of upland rice (Oryza sativa) in Brazil occurs {{mainly in the}} Cerrado, a region with adverse weather conditions. The use of silicon in its cultivation becomes important, since this nutrient provides higher rigidity, lower transpiration and higher resistance to dry spells in rice plants. The objective {{of the present study}} was to evaluate the effect of silicon fertilization and soil water tensions on upland rice development and yield in a Cerrado Oxisol. A 5 x 5 fractionated factorial with five soil water tensions (0, 15, 30, 45 and 60 kPa) and five silicon doses (0, 120, 240, 480 and 960 mg dm- 3) was used, which were distributed in a randomized block design, with four replicates. Plant height, number of tillers, number of panicles, number of grains per panicle, numbers of <b>full</b> and empty <b>grains</b> and percentage of empty grains were evaluated. Silicon fertilization promotes increased tillering in rice plants at the dose of 960 mg dm- 3. The numbers of tillers and panicles decreased with the application of silicon up to the doses of 460 and 490 mg dm- 3, respectively. The increase in soil water tensions reduced plant height and the number of <b>full</b> <b>grains,</b> and increased the percentage of empty grains of upland rice...|$|R

5000|$|The only type {{of leather}} {{suitable}} for carving is vegetable tanned, <b>full</b> <b>grain</b> leather. This {{is because the}} vegetable tanning process allows the leather to absorb water, {{which is used to}} soften the leather before the carving process, and the grain of the leather is necessary to allow the leather to hold the shape after the carving process is complete. Other leathers lack these two essential qualities.While the process of cutting into the leather and pushing the edges of the cuts in is relatively modern, marking wet leather has been around since the Roman period. There are some beautiful examples of Roman leather at Vindolanda near Hadrian's wall and the book [...] "Purses in Pieces" [...] is very informative with some lovely examples of medieval carved leather work. Historically, tools for stamping leather would probably have been made out of bone, but would not have been too different from what we use today.|$|E

The sewing plays {{a very important role}} in shoe making, having an impact both in terms of functionality and outlook. One of the most important indicators of the sewed products quality is seam strength, which is influenced by a series of technological parameters such as: the shape of the needle’s top, the needle’s diameter, the seam thickness, the number of seams, the gauge of the thread, the type of seam and the material type. This paper studies the stitching strength of the <b>full</b> <b>grain</b> leather and <b>full</b> <b>grain</b> leather shiny surface used for footwear uppers, in order to improve productivity and seam quality. The experimental researches obtained for the stitching strength allow calculating the weakening coefficient of the material in the process of sewing (a= 0. 33 - 0. 48). The “a” coefficient is dependent on the stitch density, the shape of the needle’s top and the joined materials. In terms of stitching strength, the results indicate that the <b>full</b> <b>grain</b> leather obtains higher values than the <b>full</b> <b>grain</b> leather shiny surface. ...|$|E

40|$|Grain size {{refinement}} can {{be achieved}} by recrystallisation during hot deformation, with multiple deformation steps during rolling or forging being used to generate fine grain sizes.

It has been found that D’ is a function of strain at high strain values (above 0. 3) and the relative position of the grain size in the grain size range (D*). Results for recrystallised grain size distributions for a range of steel grades (including model Fe - Ni steels, commercial Nb-microalloyed plate and high alloy (9 Cr) forging steel) with different initial grain sizes and following deformation to different deformation strains, show that the predictions give good agreement with the experimental data except for samples with larger mode grain sizes deformed to a strain of 0. 15...|$|E
