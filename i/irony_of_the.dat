Pioneer surf guitarist Dick Dale, {{who claimed to have}} met Hendrix in Los Angeles in 1964, believed the mention was Hendrix's way of encouraging his recuperation when Dale was seriously ill.|$|E

25|$|Boris Borisovich Simeonov-Pishchik – a {{landowner}} {{and another}} old aristocrat whose estate has hit hard times. He is constantly discussing new business ventures that may save him and badgering Ranyevskaya for a loan.

25|$|The <b>irony</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{situation}} {{was that the}} primary reason {{this section of the}} creek was in so natural a state was that it had been protected from other development through the land having been reserved for the section of the proposed F35 Scoresby Freeway (Renamed Eastlink) to join the end of the Eastern Freeway under the 1969 Melbourne Transportation Plan.|$|E

50|$|Drôle de jeu is a prize winning 1945 French {{novel by}} Roger Vailland first {{published}} by Éditions Corrêa.

Although Vailland later tried to play down the autobiographical elements in the novel, these have been documented by his biographers.|$|R

25|$|Paley was {{a notorious}} ladies man his entire life. Indeed, his first {{marriage}} to Dorothy ended when a newspaper published a suicide note written to Paley by a former girlfriend. As a result of another relationship, he provided a stipend to a former lover, actress Louise Brooks, {{for the rest of}} her life. In his later years, he enjoyed keeping company with several women. Paley was included in a list of the ten most eligible bachelors compiled by Cosmopolitan magazine in 1985; the <b>irony</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> octogenarian Paley being on the list was an inspiration for Late Night with David Letterman's nightly Top Ten lists.|$|E
25|$|Inheritance was by descent, {{but could}} be further {{restricted}} by entailment, which would restrict inheritance to male heirs only. In {{the case of the}} Bennet family, Mr. Collins was to inherit the family estate upon Mr. Bennet's death and his proposal to Elizabeth would have ensured her future security. Nevertheless, she refuses his offer. Inheritance laws benefited males because most women did not have independent legal rights until {{the second half of the}} 19th century. As a consequence, women's financial security at that time depended on men. For the upper-middle and aristocratic classes, marriage to a man with a reliable income was almost the only route to security for the woman and her future children. The <b>irony</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> novel's opening line, therefore, is that generally within this society it would be a woman who would be looking for a wealthy husband in order to have prosperous life.|$|E
25|$|The oral {{tradition}} {{of that time}} depicted the <b>irony</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rivalries and adversities attracted to the Ado Township and the Ewi when describing her quest for expansion in Ekiti as popularly recounted thus: ‘Ogun yeye, b’Ewi ja, Ajase I loo Ewi’ Meaning ‘Many are the adversity of the King of Ado-Ekiti (Ewi), but the power of triumph lies in his hands.’ The continuous opposition to Ewi’s paramountcy by {{a large number of}} Ekiti royalties across the country is a pointer to the fear inherent in Ewi’s notable imperial ambitions from 17th to 19th century, which became threats on the status and economy of other notable towns, who were also aiming at prominence and equality within the regional power sharing structure of Ekiti country. No doubt, the characteristics of town formation in Ado-Ekiti area distinguish the mother town (the metropolis) where the most important chiefs reside from the subordinate towns where other rulers existed.|$|E

González Echevarría further argues that Juan Facundo Quiroga also continues to exist, since he represents [...] "our unresolved struggle {{between good and evil}} and our lives' inexorable drive toward death". [...] According to translator Kathleen Ross, [...] "Facundo continues to inspire controversy and debate because it contributes to national myths of modernization, anti-populism, and racist ideology".|$|E

[...] Local philosophy students soon began a tradition of rubbing the statue's toe to absorb some of his knowledge.

The station lies on the East Coast Main Line between London King's Cross railway station and Edinburgh Waverley railway station, and has direct services from Liverpool, Manchester, Birmingham and the South West. Many of the roads near the ground are for residential permit holders only, meaning car parking at the ground is notoriously difficult.

40|$|In {{this paper}} I {{have tried to}} explain how <b>the</b> {{discourse}} structure <b>of</b> <b>irony</b> - <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most complex, vocal and meaningful linguistic and literary devices – can best be revealed in the prose fiction which can an Essay, a short story or a Novel. To me, it appears that <b>the</b> meaningful use <b>of</b> <b>irony</b> for <b>the</b> purposes <b>of</b> communication can best be taught with <b>the</b> help <b>of</b> a novel. Both irony and the novel use the same discourse structure and, hence, they help each other in communicating <b>the</b> several layers <b>of</b> meanings which hide, in themselves, the linguistic and literary beauty <b>of</b> <b>irony</b> and <b>the</b> novel. Irony can best be communicated through the events and conditions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fictional world and construed from the description itself.

40|$|I {{study the}} poem for its {{intrinsic}} qualities {{and its relation}} with MacDonogh’s poetic arts and practices. It is a poem of discretion: repetition of this motif being aided by <b>the</b> arrangement <b>of</b> sounds and silences. A man facing a landscape is a frequently recurring theme in MacDonogh’s poems. Some aspects of this relationship are: an innocent vision; descriptive poetry, without elaborate symbolism; “wonder and delight”; a vision <b>of</b> experience; <b>the</b> <b>ironies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world; poetry <b>of</b> <b>the</b> open air, not of “the curtained room”: {{the time and place}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> experience and <b>of</b> <b>the</b> enunciation tend to coincide, the mind relaxes and finds itself, silence turns into words, “sweet discipline” has given rise to the poem; towards metamorphosis: identification with surroundings, and anthropomorphic points of view, osmosis.

500|$|A travelogue {{issued in}} Yugoslavia in the 1920s {{described}} the triptych as showing the [...] "solidarity of several nations", {{an example of}} the Banat's diversity and cosmopolitanism. [...] "Great artists are never narrow-minded or chauvinists", it continued, [...] "and Jovanović's paintings are a nice example of this". The triptych endures in popularity because it shows Vojvodina's past diversity and cosmopolitanism, which declined significantly during and after World War II, and the subsequent expulsion of the region's ethnic German population. This led one observer to remark on the <b>irony</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> triptych celebrating diversity and coexistence in Vršac though descendants of the Germans depicted in the painting are unlikely to be living there today. Nevertheless, the town still has a sizable population of Romanians and Hungarians, according to the 2011 Serbian census. In 1896, the triptych was gifted to the Vršac City Museum by the artist, where it remains on display. It is catalogued under inventory number 168.|$|E
500|$|Also in 2014, Michael Stevens of the YouTube channel Vsauce devoted {{time to the}} {{discussion}} of irony in the episode [...] "Dord". In this video, Stevens considers {{the difference between the}} typically cited [...] "situational" [...] irony, versus [...] "dramatic" [...] irony. According to him, the <b>irony</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> song may not necessarily be in the situations themselves, but rather in the dramatic irony – when someone is unaware of the significance of the event while others are. The situations aren't ironic themselves, but life itself is ironic. It is a song about [...] "the difference between what life knows we need, and what life thinks we need. What's ironic is not 10,000 spoons when {{all you need is a}} knife, it's the fact that, as Alanis believes, you have all of those spoons because, unbeknownst to you, but known by life, what you really need right now is only spoons... or the last thing you need right now is a knife." ...|$|E

Hence comes ... a heightened and elaborate air." [...] A bit later, journalist and apologist Gilbert Keith Chesterton saw Ulysses as a [...] "tribute to Christianity" [...] as getting {{to the heart of the}} remarkable difference between the outlook of Antiquity and the Christian-shaped modern one, remarking: [...] "The poet reads into the story of Ulysses the conception of an incurable desire to wander.
