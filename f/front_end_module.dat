Since the <b>front</b> <b>end</b> <b>module</b> has {{a direct impact on}} vehicle drag and vehicle cooling performance, it {{plays an important role in}} vehicle design. The current study investigates the effects of grill area, horn blockage, condenser, and fan capacity on engine cooling performance. A 1 -dimensional CFD modeling methodology is used with different sub-systems such as coolant, engine oil circuit, intercooler, condenser and other components such as thermostats, radiators, fans and pump etc. using GT-SUITE. A pre-processing tool called COOL 3 D which is part of GT-SUITE is used to build the 3 D underhood of vehicles using a component-by-component build approach, and therefore allowing inclusion of much more details than a usual 1 D simulation model. GT-SUITE object-based code helps us to build reliable cooling systems and optimize the <b>front</b> <b>end</b> <b>module</b> for various operating conditions and reduces our effort on real time testing.

The scientific requirements of the mission determine the performance parameters to be met by the FEMs, including their linear polarization characteristics. The FEM design is that of a differential pseudo-correlation radiometer in which the signal from the sky is compared with a 4 -K blackbody load. The Low Noise Amplifier (LNA) {{at the heart of the}} FEM is based on indium phosphide High Electron Mobility Transistors (HEMTs). The radiometer incorporates a novel phase-switch design which gives excellent amplitude and phase match across the band. The noise temperature requirements are met within the measurement errors at the two frequencies. For the most sensitive LNAs, the noise temperature at the band centre is 3 and 5 times the quantum limit at 30 and 44 GHz respectively. For some of the FEMs, the noise temperature is still falling as the ambient temperature is reduced to 20 K. Stability tests of the FEMs, including a measurement of the 1 /f knee frequency, also meet mission requirements.

This thesis deals with the physics of silicon sensors and the preparation of the large-scale production of <b>front</b> <b>end</b> hybrids and <b>modules</b> which will span over one year. During this period it is essential to assure efficient and reproducible manufacturing as well as diagnostic procedures among all centres. This demands a test environment capable of supervising the complete production phase while providing a reliable quality assurance of <b>front</b> <b>end</b> hybrids and <b>modules.</b> To meet these requirements, the test setup ARC (APV Readout Controller) was developed in Aachen and distributed among all collaborating institutes. In this thesis, the ARC system is introduced and, in particular, the development of test procedures implemented in the corresponding readout and analysis software (ARCS) are described. Based on the characterization of a pre-series of 21 silicon modules, called express-line, built in the year 2002 by the tracker end cap collaboration, the functionality and suitability of the ARC system could be demonstrated. The measurements of these modules, performed at ambient and at low temperatures, allowed the improvement of existing test procedures as well as the development of new tests incorporated in the ARCS environment to guarantee a comprehensive and redundant failure determination. Three types of faults showed up during the different test procedures: open bonds, shorts, and pinholes.

40|$|Multi-band and {{multi-mode}} radios {{are becoming}} prevalent and {{necessary in order}} to provide optimal data rates across a network with a diverse and spotty landscape of coverage areas (3 G, HSPA, LTE, etc.). As the number of required bands and modes increases, the aggregate cost of discrete RF signal chains justi es the adoption of tunable solutions. Tunable fi lters are one of the pieces crucial to signal chain amalgamation. The main requirements for a tunable fi lter are high unloaded quality factor, wide tuning range, high tuning speed, high linearity, and small size. MEMS technology is the most promising in terms of tuning range, quality factor, linearity and size. In addition, a fi lter that maintains a constant passband bandwidth as the center frequency is tuned is preferred since the analog baseband processing circuitry tends to be tailored for a particular signal bandwidth. In this work, a novel design technique for tunable fi lters with controlled and predictable bandwidth variation is presented. The design technique is presented alongside an analysis and modeling method for predicting the final filter response during design optimization. The method is based on the well known coupling matrix model. In order to demonstrate the design and modeling technique, a novel coupling structure for stripline fi lters is presented that results in substantial improvements in coupling bandwidth variation over an octave tuning range when compared to combline and interdigitated coupled line fi lters. In order for a coupled resonator filter to produce an equal ripple Chebyshev response, each resonator of the fi lter must be tuned to precisely the same resonant frequency. Production tuned fi lters are routinely tuned in the lab and production environments by skilled technicians in order to compensate for manufacturing tolerances. However, integrated tunable filters cannot be tuned by traditional means since they are integrated into systems on circuit boards or inside <b>front</b> <b>end</b> <b>modules.</b> A fixed tuning table for all manufactured modules is inadequate since the required tuning accuracy exceeds the tolerance of the tuning elements. In this work, we develop tuning techniques for the automatic in-circuit tuning of tunable filters using scalar transmission measurement. The scalar transmission based techniques obviate the use of directional couplers. Techniques based on both swept and single frequency scalar transmission measurement are developed. The swept frequency technique, based on the Hilbert transform derived relative groupdelay, tunes both couplings and resonant frequencies while the single frequency technique only tunes the center frequency. High performance filters necessitate high resonator quality factors. Although fi lters are traditionally treated as passive devices, tunable fi lters need to be treated as active devices. Tuning elements invariably introduce non-linearities that limit the useful power handling of the tunable fi lter. RF MEMS devices have been a topic of intense research for many years for their promising characteristics of high quality factor and high power handling. Control and reliability issues have resulted in a shift from continuously tunable devices to discretely switched devices. However, fi lter tuning applications require fine resolution and therefore many bits for digital capacitor banks. An analog/digital hybrid tuning approach would enable the tuning range of a switched capacitor bank to be combined with the tuning resolution of an analog tunable capacitor. In this work, a device-level position control mechanism is proposed for piezoresistive feedback of device capacitance over the device's tuning range. It is shown that piezoresistve position control is ef ective at improving capacitance uncertainty in a CMOS integrated RF MEMS variable capacitor...|$|R

MIMO-OFDM can very effectively {{be used to}} achieve higher data rate’s and higher reliability {{and this is going}} to be the Key for 4 G Technology. MIMO -OFDM designed in this work consists of Input/Output Memory, 16 QAM Modulator, MIMO Encoder (Space Time Encoder, Wireless Channel Model, MIMO Decoder Space Time Decoder) and 16 QAM Demodulator. This paper has resulted in the development of a hardware prototype of a MIMO Transmitter, Receiver and channel, which is implemented on a Spartan- 3 FPGA board. As the number format adopted is floating point,there was a need to develop a separate function which will show the equivalent real numbers for the corresponding floating point number. This made the task of debugging a lot easier. Test benches for individual model were developed and tested it for its correct functionality. The functional simulation was carried out for the entire design. The entire design was mapped on to FPGA. The results were compared with the MATLAB results and were found to be the same...|$|E

According to market research reports, almost all new WiFi products have integrated 11 n technology, and the forecast for shipments of 11 n equipment in 2012 is one billion units. In {{order to improve}} the mobile data traffic, 11 n {{will be one of}} the standard features in mobile phones to address the high data throughput service, such as streaming video and gaming. In this article, we examine 802. 11 g vs. 802. 11 n, focusing on the requirements for the power amplifier (PA) or integrated PA <b>front</b> <b>end</b> <b>module</b> (FEM) in 11 n designs. IEEE 802. 11 n vs. 802. 11 g/a In 11 n, multiple input multiple output (MIMO) is an addition to the physical layer (PHY). MIMO is the use of more than one transmitter and more than one receiver on the same wireless device to increase data throughput. The IEEE 802. 11 n standard can support much faster data rates, up to 600 Mbps, compared to 802. 11 a/g which has a peak data rate of 54 Mbps. The 11 n PHY supports a wide array of different data rates, called modulation coding scheme (MCS) rates...|$|E

Based on the layered design {{theory of the}} MVC design pattern, our implementation is separated in the Model, View and Controller components. Four major functions in our system are the workflow creation, collaboration, automatic document delivery and work flow search. The system consists of a <b>front</b> <b>end</b> and a back <b>end.</b> The <b>front</b> <b>end</b> is developed as a View layer; while the back end is comprised of a Model layer and a Controller layer. SQL Server 2005 is selected as the backend database management system. The database connections and operations are established and performed by the back <b>end.</b> Every <b>module</b> in our system accesses data by using dedicated interfaces, which create data channels from databases to the <b>front</b> and back <b>ends</b> and keep data consistency in the system...|$|R
25|$|The {{meaning of}} a tree was {{somewhat}} different for different language <b>front</b> <b>ends,</b> and <b>front</b> <b>ends</b> could provide their own tree codes. This was simplified {{with the introduction of}} GENERIC and GIMPLE, two new forms of language-independent trees that were introduced with the advent of GCC 4.0. GENERIC is more complex, based on the GCC 3.x Java <b>front</b> <b>end's</b> intermediate representation. GIMPLE is a simplified GENERIC, in which various constructs are lowered to multiple GIMPLE instructions. The C, C++ and Java <b>front</b> <b>ends</b> produce GENERIC directly in the <b>front</b> <b>end.</b> Other <b>front</b> <b>ends</b> instead have different intermediate representations after parsing and convert these to GENERIC.|$|R
