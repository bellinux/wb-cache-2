5|$|The {{ship that}} was to become Edward M. Cotter was built in 1900 by the Crescent Shipyard of Elizabeth Port, New Jersey. She was {{originally}} named William S.

5|$|As {{the fire}} was going into its sixth hour it had spread up to the 26th floor. With {{inadequate}} water pressure coming from the standpipes, firefighters stretched hoses up the building's stairwells to help fight the fire. While hoses were being taken up to the fire a sprinkler technician arrived to fix the water pressure. This improved the hose streams, but the fire had engulfed several floors {{and could not be}} contained with just hoses. By 7:00 AM, almost eleven hours into the fire, firefighters were able to get control of the fire on the 22nd through 24th floors, but {{the fire was}} still out of control on the 25th and 26th floors and was spreading upwards. Structural damage observed inside the building by firefighters and consultations with a structural engineer led to fears that the damaged floors might collapse. At 7:00 AM an order to evacuate the building was issued by <b>Fire</b> <b>Commissioner</b> Roger Ulshafer, and the building was completely evacuated by 7:30 AM. After the evacuation, the only fire suppression efforts left were water streams being directed to the building from the neighboring Girard Trust Building and One Centre Square.|$|E

The current <b>Fire</b> <b>Commissioner</b> is Daniel A. Nigro, who recently took over the position from Salvatore J. Cassano in June 2014.

25|$|A new clubhouse {{was built}} on Belle Isle in 1891, but was burned in 1893. Another {{boathouse}} lasted until 1901 when it also burned. In an attempt to save the structure, club member and <b>fire</b> <b>commissioner</b> Fred Moran ordered all available firefighting apparatus to the scene. Horses thundered over the old wooden bridge, dragging heavy engines and trucks behind them. The fire tug James Battle became grounded in the shallow water and remained stuck fast until the following noon. Fire equipment failed to {{get close enough to}} the burning building due to mud and the distance of the old clubhouse from the shore. Helpless, they stood and watched it burn. The next morning, club members vowed once again to rebuild their clubhouse.|$|E

The volunteer fire department is run by an elected board of three <b>fire</b> <b>commissioners,</b> which appoints the fire marshal, the chief, and all officers.

500|$|An {{investigation}} by the New York Press asked a number of independent doctors about the evidence for the Purification Rundown. None of them endorsed the program's effectiveness and some explicitly described it as dangerous. Several said that no peer-reviewed research on the rundown had been published in any medical journal. Some apparently supportive studies have been published, but these lack control groups and have other scientific failings. According to Deputy <b>Fire</b> <b>Commissioner</b> Frank Gribbon, doctors investigating the program {{on behalf of the}} Fire Department concluded that it was not detoxifying. University of Georgia bioterrorism expert Cham Dallas also denied that the procedure could detoxify, saying [...] "It sounds great and they mean well, but it just doesn't work." ...|$|E

Deputy <b>Fire</b> <b>Commissioner</b> Frank Gribbon of the FDNY told The New York Times, [...] "while we are aware some members of the department have availed themselves of the program, we in no way endorse it." [...] Officials at the department raised concerns that firefighters were giving up existing medications in order to take part. The department's deputy chief medical officer Dr. David Prezant said, [...] "It's not our job to say you can't go. All we can do is say there's no proven evidence it works." ...|$|E
