25|$|Floodgates, {{also called}} stop gates, are {{adjustable}} gates {{used to control}} water flow in flood barriers, reservoir, river, stream, or levee systems. They may be designed to set spillway crest heights in dams, to adjust flow rates in sluices and canals, {{or they may be}} designed to stop water flow entirely as part of a levee or storm surge system. Since most of these devices operate by controlling the water surface elevation being stored or routed, they are also known as crest gates. In the case of <b>flood</b> <b>bypass</b> systems, floodgates sometimes are also used to lower the water levels in a main river or canal channels by allowing more water to flow into a <b>flood</b> <b>bypass</b> or detention basin when the main river or canal is approaching a flood stage.|$|E
50|$|Flood {{bypasses}} {{are typically}} used only during major floods {{and act in}} a similar nature to a detention basin. Since the area of a <b>flood</b> <b>bypass</b> is significantly larger than the cross-sectional area of the original river or stream channel from which water is diverted, the velocity of water in a <b>flood</b> <b>bypass</b> will be {{significantly lower than the}} velocity of the flood water in the original system. These low velocities often cause increased sediment deposition in the <b>flood</b> <b>bypass,</b> thus it is important to incorporate a mantaince program for the entire <b>flood</b> <b>bypass</b> system when it is not being actively used during a flood operation.|$|E

50|$|A <b>flood</b> <b>bypass</b> is {{a region}} of land or a large {{man-made}} structure {{that is designed to}} convey excess flood waters from a river or stream {{in order to reduce the}} risk of flooding on the natural river or stream near a key point of interest, such as a city. Flood bypasses, sometimes called floodways, often have man-made diversion works, such as diversion weirs and spillways, at their head or point of origin. The main body of a <b>flood</b> <b>bypass</b> is often a natural flood plain. Many flood bypasses are designed to carry enough water such that combined flows down the original river or stream and <b>flood</b> <b>bypass</b> will not exceed the expected maximum flood flow of the river or stream.|$|E

5000|$|Measures in {{the plan}} include: placing and moving dykes, depoldering, {{creating}} and increasing the depth of flood channels, reducing {{the height of the}} groynes, removing obstacles, and the construction of a [...] "Green River" [...] which would serve as a <b>flood</b> <b>bypass.</b> This will result in lower flood levels. By 2015 the Rhine branches will safely cope with an outlet capacity of 16,000 cubic metres of water per second; the measures implemented to achieve this will also improve the quality of the environment of the river basin.|$|E
40|$|Engineered <b>flood</b> <b>bypasses,</b> or {{simplified}} conveyance floodplains, {{are natural}} laboratories {{in which to}} observe floodplain development and therefore present an opportunity to assess delivery to and sedimentation within a specific class of floodplain. The effects of floods in the Sacramento River basin were investigated by analyzing hydrograph characteristics, estimating event-based sediment discharges and reach erosion/deposition through its bypass system and observing sedimentation patterns with field data. Sediment routing for a large, iconic flood suggests high rates of sedimentation in major bypasses, which is corroborated by data for one bypass area from sedimentation pads, floodplain cores and sediment removal reporting from a government agency. These indicate a consistent spatial pattern of high sediment accumulation both upstream and downstream of lateral flow diversions and negligible sedimentation in a ‘hydraulic shadow’ directly downstream of a diversion weir. The pads located downstream of the shadow recorded several centimeters of deposition during a moderate flood in 2006, increasing downstream to a peak of ∼ 10 cm thick and thinning rapidly thereafter. Flood deposits in the sediment cores agree with this spatial pattern, containing discrete sedimentation layers (from preceding floods) that increase in thickness with distance downstream of the bypass entrance to several decimeters thick at the peak and then thin downstream. These patterns suggest that a quasi-natural physical process of levee construction by advective overbank transport and deposition of sediment is operating. The results improve understanding {{of the evolution of}} <b>bypass</b> <b>flood</b> control structures, the transport and deposition of sediment within these environments and the evolution of one class of natural levee systems...|$|R
50|$|Most of the Sacramento Valley {{is below}} 300 ft in elevation; in its lower course, the Sacramento River drops only about 1 ft per mile. Between the bajadas or {{alluvial}} slopes {{extending from the}} foothills of the Sierra Nevada and Coast Ranges, are the low floodplains of the Sacramento River. The river flows at an elevation somewhat higher than the surrounding terrain due to deposits of sediment over millennia that created raised banks (essentially natural levees). The banks separate the river from the lowlands to the east and west that once served as vast overflow basins during winter storms, creating large areas of seasonal wetlands. Since the 19th century, artificial levee systems have been constructed to enable farming in the fertile flood plain. Today there are 2000000 acre of irrigated farmland in the Sacramento Valley. Due to the reduction of the floodplain area, the speed of flood flow in the Sacramento River has increased, creating a significant hazard for the farms and towns along its course. By the early 20th century engineers had realized not all the floodplains could be safely reclaimed, leading to the intentional creation of <b>flood</b> <b>bypasses</b> where development is limited to annual crops and recreational uses.|$|R
50|$|In 2001 the Government sought {{proposals}} {{for a solution}} that would allow a typical flood of three to six hours’ duration to occur without flooding the city centre. A tunnel that would allow <b>floods</b> to <b>bypass</b> the centre was one way of achieving this, providing it was coupled with temporary storage facilities to keep flows downstream of Kuala Lumpur within {{the capacity of the}} river channel. A group led by Gamuda engaged SSP, a large Malaysian consultant engineering firm, and Mott MacDonald UK to develop {{proposals for}} a tunnel with holding ponds at upstream and downstream ends of the tunnel.|$|R
50|$|When {{not being}} used to convey water, flood {{bypasses}} are sometimes used for agricultural or environmental purposes. The land is often owned by a public authority and then rented to farmers or ranchers, who in turn plant crops or herd livestock that feed off the flood plain. Since the <b>flood</b> <b>bypass</b> is subjected to sedimentation during flood events, the land is often very productive and even a loss of crops due to flooding can sometimes be recovered due to the high yield of the land during the non-flood periods.|$|E
50|$|The Tampa Bypass Canal and Palm River are a 14 mi <b>flood</b> <b>bypass</b> {{operated}} by the Southwest Florida Water Management District. The canal includes several concrete flood control structures and was constructed during the 1960s and 1970s. Its purpose is to redirect flood waters from large amounts of rainfall from the Hillsborough River to Tampa Bay to prevent floodwaters reaching homes and businesses. Despite its original purpose it is now used as a drinking water source for the City of Tampa. During construction of the canal the Floridan aquifer was accidentally breached.|$|E

One condition of the license {{is the creation of}} a recreation area to provide the public with access to the plant and interpret its part in the evolution of St. Anthony Falls. A walkway now crosses in front of the building, leading to a bridge across the spillway separating the plant from Hennepin Island. A portion of the island overlooking the falls has been made into Water Power Park, allowing the closest possible approaches to the falls.

This portion {{of the project was}} {{undertaken}} to control potential flooding in an area along Napa Creek between Jefferson Street and the Napa River in downtown Napa. This area is even more prone to flooding than the river itself. Work in this portion of the project included removal and replacement of existing vehicle bridges, installation of new culvert and reshaping of the creek's bank. Much of this portion of the project was completed in 2013.The project has also funded other river related projects up valley from the work being done in the City of Napa.The remaining work on the project included construction of a <b>flood</b> <b>bypass</b> channel which was finished in 2015.|$|E

40|$|The Yolo Bypass {{is one of}} two <b>flood</b> <b>bypasses</b> in the Sacramento Valley of California. The Yolo Bypass protects Sacramento {{and other}} {{riverside}} communities from flooding through a system of overflow weirs. These weirs connect the bypass to the Sacramento River as well as to various local creeks where the water is eventually drained into the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta. Although the Yolo Bypass floodplain has been demonstrated to benefit a suite of native fishes, particularly in flood years, {{little is known about the}} movement patterns and residence time of migratory fish such as white sturgeon in the Yolo Bypass. In cooperation with the California Department of Water Resources (DWR), the Biotelemetry Lab at UC Davis implanted 68 white sturgeon with VEMCO V 16 coded acoustic telemetry tags. Using an array of VEMCOVR 2 W 69 kHz receivers, including those maintained by the California Fish Tracking Consortium, the sturgeon 2 ̆ 7 s movement patterns were monitored throughout the Yolo Bypass (a total reach of 38. 5 river kilometers) and into the San Francisco Bay. These fish face numerous barriers to migration through the Yolo Bypass under varying river flow conditions, the most significant of which being the Fremont Weir, which blocks sturgeon passage in all but completely inundated conditions. This presentation will address the migratory behavior of sturgeon in the Yolo Bypass and will specifically focus on the analysis of residence time, reach-specific behavior, pulse-flow dynamics relative to sturgeon movement, and sturgeon behavior at the various migratory barriers...|$|R

The bypass channel was said to be able to alleviate the flooding on the major road stretch...|$|E
40|$|The Permian Cedar Mesa Sandstone {{of southeastern}} Utah {{represents}} an eolian succession that exhibits complex spatial variation in dune architecture and diagenetic history. The Cedar Mesa Sandstone was deposited as a dune sea with a fluvial environment to the northeast, a marine environment {{to the west}} and playa environment to the southeast. ^ Paleowind measurements, surface elevations and permeability characterized the dune architecture of a twenty-meter eolian succession. Results confirm that <b>flood</b> (<b>bypass)</b> surfaces and supersurfaces extend from the northeast into the Cedar Mesa erg margin. Supersurfaces bound the studied interval and represent an apparent transgression of the erg. Flood surfaces bound eolian packages that have complex internal geometries. Flood and supersurfaces have 4 to 8 m of relief, some of which results from soft sediment deformation during deposition of the unit. Complex dune geometries could not be traced in the lower and thinner flood surface bounded intervals because the units were thinner than the migrating bedforms. ^ In the thicker middle unit, a large paleotopographic high or draa was delineated by climbing and descending trough cross beds. The trough cross beds are inferred to be deposits of migrating out of phase barchan dunes. These were migrating to the southeast, obliquely up and down the flanks of the north-northeast trending draa. Down climbing dunes reflect the eastward migration of the draa. ^ Petrographic results illustrate complex diagenesis during burial and after compaction. Research identifies five diagenetic facies. Facies represent eight stages of the diagenetic history of the studied interval. Fossil fragments found below supersurfaces represent an apparent transgression of the erg. The red coloration originated in the desert environment at the time of deposition. The white units, bleached by acidic reducing fluids after Laramide uplift of the plateau presumably represent exhumed hydrocarbon reservoirs or migration paths that created late secondary porosity. ^ This thesis for the first time documents widespread presence of fossil fragments along the supersurfaces. These surfaces are inferred to be maximum flooding surfaces in the transgressive part of a high-frequency stratigraphic sequence. This {{is the first time that}} the Permian non-marine facies have been linked to a sequence stratigraphic framework. ^ Earlier depositional models for the studied 20 -m thick interval did not reflect <b>flood</b> (<b>bypass)</b> surfaces. The dunes and associated wet interdunes were assumed to climb, reflecting a relatively continuous and contemporaneous aggradation and rising water table. This study suggests that the water table did not keep up with eolian aggradation and was not important in preserving the upper parts of the unit. ^ The complex geometries exposed in the study area also imply a much more complex preserved stratigraphy, with large undulations, oblique to the main dune migration. This type of feature can be imaged seismically and can help enhance oil exploration and recovery. ...|$|E

50|$|There {{have been}} tide mills at Three Mills {{since at least}} the time of the Domesday Book.

The mills were supplied by the Three Mills Wall River, and prior to the reconstruction of the rivers as part of a flood defence project in the 1930s, by Three Mills Back River. There was also a weir from Bow River, the section of the Lee Navigation between Bow Locks and Old Ford Lock. As part of the 1930s scheme, Three Mills Back River was filled in, and a flood relief channel called Prescott Channel was built which enabled <b>flood</b> flows to <b>bypass</b> the mills when required.

5000|$|Some {{hydropower}} {{systems such}} as water wheels can draw power from the flow of {{a body of water}} without necessarily changing its height. In this case, the available power is the kinetic energy of the flowing water. Over-shot water wheels can efficiently capture both types of energy.The water flow in a stream can vary widely from season to season. Development of a hydropower site requires analysis of flow records, sometimes spanning decades, to assess the reliable annual energy supply. Dams and reservoirs provide a more dependable source of power by smoothing seasonal changes in water flow. However reservoirs have significant environmental impact, as does alteration of naturally occurring stream flow. The design of dams must also account for the worst-case, [...] "probable maximum flood" [...] that can be expected at the site; a spillway is often included to <b>bypass</b> <b>flood</b> flows around the dam.
