40|$|The authors {{examine whether}} {{monetary}} policy should and {{could do more}} to lean against <b>financial</b> <b>imbalances</b> (such as those associated with asset-price bubbles or unsustainable credit expansion) as they are building up, or whether its role {{should be limited to}} cleaning up the economic consequences as the imbalances unwind. Effective supervision and regulation are the first line of defence against <b>financial</b> <b>imbalances.</b> An important question is whether they should be the only one. The authors argue that the case for monetary policy to lean against <b>financial</b> <b>imbalances</b> depends on the sources of the shock or market failure and {{on the nature of the}} other regulatory instruments available. To the extent that <b>financial</b> <b>imbalances</b> are specific to a sector or market and that a well-targeted prudential tool is available, monetary policy might play a minor role in leaning against the imbalances. However, if the imbalances in a specific market can spill over to the entire economy and/or if the prudential tool is broad based, monetary policy is more likely to have a role to play. In such a case, there may be a need to coordinate the use of the two policy instruments. ...|$|R
40|$|Some {{commentators}} {{have argued that}} an exclusive focus of monetary policy on achieving price stability is inappropriate {{in a world where}} asset-price misalignments and <b>financial</b> <b>imbalances</b> are increasingly prevalent. This paper reviews the argument that monetary policy should react to asset-price movements and/or <b>financial</b> <b>imbalances</b> over and above their impact on the inflation outlook. I conclude that, while monetary policy-makers should take note of such developments, the macroeconomic implications can be adequately embraced within an appropriately flexible and forward-looking concept of inflation targets. In a simple New Keynesian model, modified to allow for capital and debt accumulation, I then show that the possibility of credit crunches may affect the design of the optimal policy in subtle and unexpected ways. I also consider a variety of other ways that incipient <b>financial</b> <b>imbalances</b> could impinge on the conduct of an optimal monetary policy. Finally I discuss recent developments in the UK household sector as a practical example of the problem of assessing whether an asset price is misaligned and whether balance sheet developments pose a threat to the outlook. 1...|$|R

40|$|One {{fundamental}} {{lesson of}} the financial crisis is that the evolution of <b>financial</b> <b>imbalances</b> may suggest overheating in the economy, which does not necessarily entail a rise in inflation. The bursting of these bubbles may result in an abrupt overshooting of the positive output gap in the opposite direction, in other words, it can lead to a severe recession. Thus, in addition to inflation and growth forecasts, central banks endeavouring to stabilise income fluctuations need to develop new indicators which are suitable for grasping the output gaps which evolve during the development of <b>financial</b> <b>imbalances.</b> This would require models that capture shocks in the banking systems and financial frictions in an endogenous way, but such models are still in their infancy. Over the short run, the only feasible opportunity is to derive indicators with good forecasting qualities directly from the indicators that characterise the imbalance, which are then considered by the Monetary Council in the form of expert information during the decision-making process. There is no need to change the framework of inflation targeting. However, in the future greater emphasis should be laid on the fact that anchoring inflationary expectations is a necessary, but not sufficient prerequisite to creating macro-economic stability, and that measures taken to avoid <b>financial</b> <b>imbalances</b> help to dampen income fluctuations. As the usual instruments are highly inefficient for stabilising the output gap caused by <b>financial</b> <b>imbalances,</b> the occasional application of macro-prudential instruments needs to be considered. monetary strategy, boom bust, asset prices, regulation, central banking. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper investigates empirically {{the drivers}} of <b>{{financial}}</b> <b>imbalances</b> {{ahead of the}} global financial crisis. Three factors {{may have contributed to}} the build-up of financial imbalances: (i) rising global imbalances (capital flows), (ii) monetary policy that might have been too loose, (iii) inadequate supervision and regulation. Panel data regressions are performed for OECD countries from 1999 to 2007, so as to shed light on the relative importance of these factors, as well as the extent to which these factors might have interacted in fuelling the build-up. We find that the build-up of <b>financial</b> <b>imbalances</b> was driven by capital inflows and an associated compression of the spread between long and short rates. The effect of capital inflows on the build-up is amplified where the supervisory and regulatory environment was relatively weak. We find that, by contrast, differences in monetary policy cannot account for differences across countries in the build-up of <b>financial</b> <b>imbalances</b> ahead of the crisis.

While most of these crises have had little or no effect on the United States, the recent financial crisis caused the worst U.

This paper studies whether credit is a pertinent indicator of future equity price booms, and thus provides a signal for potential financial instability.

To this end, greater co-operation between monetary and prudential authorities is important, not just in managing crises, but also in preventing their emergence. financial stability; monetary stability; equity price booms and busts; excess credit...|$|R

Accordingly, in some situations, a monetary response to credit and asset markets may be appropriate to preserve both financial and monetary stability. ...|$|R

40|$|To analyze {{whether the}} changes {{observed}} in the level and distribution of resources for maternal health and family planning (MHFP) programs from 2003 to 2012 {{were consistent with the}} financial goals of the related policies. A longitudinal descriptive analysis of the Mexican Reproductive Health Subaccounts 2003 - 2012 was performed by financing scheme and health function. Financing schemes included social security, government schemes, household out-of-pocket (OOP) payments, and private insurance plans. Functions were preventive care, including family planning, antenatal and puerperium health services, normal and cesarean deliveries, and treatment of complications. Changes in the <b>financial</b> <b>imbalance</b> indicators covered by MHFP policy were tracked: (a) public and OOP expenditures as percentages of total MHFP spending; (b) public expenditure per woman of reproductive age (WoRA, 15 - 49 years) by financing scheme; (c) public expenditure on treating complications as a percentage of preventive care; and (d) public expenditure on WoRA at state level. Statistical analyses of trends and distributions were performed. Public expenditure on government schemes grew by approximately 300 %, and the <b>financial</b> <b>imbalance</b> between populations covered by social security and government schemes decreased. The financial burden on households declined, particularly among households without social security. Expenditure on preventive care grew by 16 %, narrowing the financing gap between treatment of complications and preventive care. Finally, public expenditure per WoRA for government schemes nearly doubled at the state level, although considerable disparities persist. Changes in the level and distribution of MHFP funding from 2003 to 2012 were consistent with the relevant policy goals. However, improving efficiency requires further analysis to ascertain the impact of investments on health outcomes. This, in turn, will require better financial data systems as a precondition for improving the monitoring and accountability functions in Mexico...|$|E
