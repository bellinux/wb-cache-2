5|$|Several {{times in}} 1912, amidst an {{outbreak}} of bubonic plague in the Caribbean, <b>Havana</b> operated in violation of Cuban and U.S. quarantine rules. In July 1912, the liner prepared to depart Cuba without an inspection and fumigation, but faced the prospect of seven days quarantine in <b>Havana</b> before the ship {{would be allowed to}} depart. However, a compromise was worked out by the United States Marine Hospital Service which allowed <b>Havana</b> to depart after a one-day delay. In September of the same year, another inspection gaffe resulted in government prosecution of the Ward Line.|$|E

40|$|A single bus {{route in}} <b>Havana’s</b> bus system is {{modelled}} {{from the current}} position to a modernised bus rapid transit (BRT). The system {{is based on an}} expert-led visioning process and Cuba’s official planning documents, which define the high-level design criteria and their objectives. Building on the experiences of BRT systems that operate in other Latin American cities, a conceptual design for <b>Havana’s</b> BRT system is defined in terms of the key institutional, technical and financial frameworks, and physical criteria that need to be considered. Based on the application of the conceptual design for <b>Havana’s</b> BRT, a model for a single BRT route was constructed and modelled for emissions and capacity. The current situation and a future BRT scenario are modelled using a single bus route. The scenarios demonstrate that the current bus route with a BRT system can lead to lower overall emissions. The model suggests that if properly designed, <b>Havana’s</b> BRT system has a realistic potential for providing, in a cost-efficient manner, the improvements in accessibility, employment generation, fuel efficiency and air quality required for achieving <b>Havana’s</b> sustainable transport vision.

5|$|The former {{hospital}} ship was repurchased by the Ward Line in 1927, who refitted her and placed {{her back in}} service on the <b>Havana</b> route under her original name of <b>Havana.</b> In January 1935, <b>Havana</b> grounded on a reef north of The Bahamas and remained there for three months. After being refloated and repaired, she was placed back in service as SS Yucatán in June. In 1940 the ship was removed from passenger service to be converted into a freighter. After capsizing in port in 1941, the ship was again refloated and renamed SS Agwileon.|$|E

The city of <b>Havana</b> reported 4.8inches (122mm), while many other locations reported more than 7inches (178mm).

5|$|A {{report in}} the American Chess Bulletin (July–August 1920 issue) said that Lasker had {{resigned}} the world title in favor of Capablanca because {{the conditions of the}} match were unpopular in the chess world. The American Chess Bulletin speculated that the conditions were not sufficiently unpopular to warrant resignation of the title, and that Lasker's real concern was that there was not enough financial backing to justify his devoting nine months to the match. When Lasker resigned the title in favor of Capablanca he was unaware that enthusiasts in <b>Havana</b> had just raised $20,000 to fund the match provided it was played there. When Capablanca learned of Lasker's resignation he went to the Netherlands, where Lasker was living at the time, to inform him that <b>Havana</b> would finance the match. In August 1920 Lasker agreed to play in <b>Havana,</b> but insisted that he was the challenger as Capablanca was now the champion. Capablanca signed an agreement that accepted this point, and soon afterwards published a letter confirming this. Lasker also stated that, if he beat Capablanca, he would resign the title so that younger masters could compete for it.|$|E

Initial efforts to re-float her were unsuccessful, but by late October, Siboney had been {{repaired}} {{enough to make it}} to Shields. Despite considerable damage, Siboney was refitted and placed in service again and, by March 1921, the Ward Line was advertising passage to Spain via <b>Havana</b> aboard her.

5|$|Alma caused {{significant}} {{crop damage}} in western Cuba; it destroyed 13,400acres (5,400hectares) of bananas and 18,090acres (7,320hectares) of corn fields. There were also heavy losses to fruit trees {{and to the}} sugar industry, after the storm destroyed sugar mills and the rail lines that carried the cane to the mills. The storm destroyed over 100tobacco drying barns, including their contents. The destruction of the tobacco represented a $30million loss for the country. High winds also destroyed 96tobacco storage facilities, although the tobacco was removed beforehand. In Güines near <b>Havana,</b> Alma destroyed food crops, which further exacerbated Cuba's existing food shortages. Alma's passage also resulted in water shortages, prompting the government to urge residents to use less water. There was heavy structural damage across western Cuba, including in <b>Havana,</b> Matanzas, Camagüey, Pinar del Río, and Las Villas. The hurricane destroyed 1,083houses, and overall damage was estimated at $200million. Alma killed 12people {{in the country and}} injured 78others. In the storm's aftermath, Cuban officials sent about 100,000people from <b>Havana</b> to the cities around the capital to repair storm damage. Such forced labor was a complaint about the rule of Fidel Castro, after the food and supply shortages.|$|E
