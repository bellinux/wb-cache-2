This particular sentence stimulated the thinking behind this survey: "PROFITS ARE OFTEN DETERMINED BY CONDITIONS BEYOND THE CONTROL OF MANAGEMENT. " <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoe</b> industry, much of the profit can be eaten away by unwise factory procedures. The individual who is most responsible for this is the foreman. On his shoulders rests the final decision as to the time, material, and other factors that determine the cost of a pair of <b>shoes.</b> If <b>the</b> factory has committed itself to the certain price range, and the foreman cannot meet this, then <b>in</b> short order, <b>the</b> factory is out of business.

25|$|Mediator sailed for Barbados {{towards the}} end of the 1785 {{hurricane}} season, but was becalmed off La Désirade for a night. The following day she was struck by a sudden squall that laid her on her beam ends. Further damage occurred when A terrible crash took part in the fore part of the ship, accompanied by a tremendous explosion and stench of sulphur, deep groans followed, - sixteen men upon the main deck were knocked down, some were apparently dead and others groaning; relief was instantly afforded, and in about four hours after all were apparently well again. A lightning ball had struck the fore topmast, passed into the pigsty, and through the galley into the waist, where it burst and overthrew seventeen men; eleven pigs in the sty before the mast were killed, belonging to the Captain; the silver buckles <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoes</b> of the gunner were melted into wire, and himself was knocked out of the roundhouse forward. Despite the dramatic nature of the lightning strike, no one was killed, except for the pigs, which Collingwood gave to the crew as a reward for their work in repairing the foremast. Collingwood took Mediator back to English Harbour to be careened in early 1786, and then returned to England to be paid off in August 1786.|$|E

This is done first by proving that the infringement falls within one of the three categories, which are liberally interpreted by the courts. The courts will not, however, give any consideration to what the infringer thought his work was for, or rely on a subjective test in any way; as in Hyde Park Residence v Yelland, it is not seen as necessary [...] "for the court to put itself <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoes</b> of the infringer of the copyright". Instead, a more objective test is used, to avoid providing [...] "any encouragement to the notion that all that is required is for the user to have a sincere belief, however misguided, {{that he or she is}} criticising a work or reporting current affairs".|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Previous {{reports have}} {{indicated}} {{an excess of}} leukaemia in Broome County, New York, particularly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Town of Union. Surveillance of cancer incidence data indicates that {{a large proportion of}} these cases occurred among males ages 65 and older. Shoe and boot manufacturing has been the largest single industry in this area throughout much of the past century. Occupational studies from Europe suggest a link between leukaemia and employment <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoe</b> and boot manufacturing industry. However, researchers have not found a positive association between leukaemia and employment <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoe</b> industry among workers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States. Methods A matched case-control study was conducted to investigate the association between leukaemia incidence among males 65 and older and employment <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoe</b> and boot manufacturing industry. Thirty-six cases of leukaemia occurring between 1981 – 1990; among males age 65 and older; residing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> town of Union met the study case criteria. Death certificates were obtained for each of the cases. These were matched to death certificates of 144 controls on date of death and date of birth +/- 1 year. Death certificates were then examined to determine the employer and occupation of each study subject. Conditional logistic regression was used to determine the risk of leukaemia among those working <b>in</b> <b>the</b> industry. Results The risk of both leukaemia (OR = 1. 47; 95 % CI 0. 70, 3. 09) and acute myeloid leukaemia (OR = 1. 19; 95 % CI 0. 33, 4. 28) were elevated among those employed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoe</b> and boot manufacturing industry, however neither was statistically significant. Conclusion The results, though suggestive of an association between leukaemia and employment <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoe</b> and boot manufacturing industry, were not statistically conclusive due mainly to limited study power. Several additional limitations may also have prevented the observance of more conclusive findings. Better exposure assessment, information on length of exposure and types of job held, control of confounding factors and information on chemicals used by this company would strengthen any future investigation. </p...|$|R

500|$|In her review, Petit of GameSpot {{felt there}} were misogynistic {{undertones}} {{in the treatment}} of women as [...] "strippers, prostitutes, long-suffering wives, humourless girlfriends and goofy, new-age feminists", and that the satirical representation of misogyny legitimises it. Her review was met with backlash as users responded with 20,000 largely negative comments on the webpage and a Change.org petition for her firing. Petit's comments and the backlash against them prompted a wider discussion about {{the role of women in}} Grand Theft Auto V and the gaming community's defensiveness towards criticism. Helen Lewis of The Guardian felt Petit's observations were valid, but were stigmatised by gamers who have become [...] "hyper-sensitive to criticism". Tom Hoggins of The Telegraph felt that the backlash against Petit was predicated on an audience that has become accustomed to women being [...] "shallow and sidelined" [...] in the game. Rob Fahey of GamesIndustry.biz felt that debate about games' thematic concerns could become stigmatised if gamers opposed criticism, writing, [...] "This isn't just about women—it's robbing every single one of us of the opportunity to have intelligent, interesting discussions about how our medium deals with..... complex topics..... It's frustrating, it's stupid, and it's downright boring—and it risks making our games stupid and boring too". Journalist Tom Bissell agreed with Petit's [...] "defensible position", and wrote that gamers respond to game criticism more aggressively than fans of other entertainment mediums. Over a year after publication of her review, Petit stated in her personal blog that the [...] "average straight male player" [...] opposes sociopolitical criticism of video games because Grand Theft Auto Vs satire reinforces their own worldview and [...] "political agenda". She stated that the prominence of [...] "straight white men" [...] in online forums marginalises women, different ethnic groups and the LGBT community, and that those who attack video game criticism should [...] "put themselves <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoes</b> of people different from themselves".|$|E

2500|$|Most {{positive}} reviews {{came from}} British film critics, and later retrospective analysis. Mark Kermode noted that many {{have come to}} consider the film a [...] "masterpiece". Among the positive reviews, Kim Newman from the British magazine Sight & Sound stated: [...] "The film's many moments of horror [...] demonstrate just how tidy, conventional and domesticated the generic horror movie of the 1980s and 1990s has become". Ed Gonzalez of Slant Magazine gave the film a four out of four stars, and the magazine later listed it in their '100 Essential Films' list. Appearing on the podcast The Cinephiliacs, filmmaker James Gray called it [...] "an incredible film," [...] "a masterpiece," [...] and [...] "a classic {{example of how the}} critics get it wrong." [...] Further speaking of Fire Walk with Me, he said, [...] "I've never seen a movie that's been made in the last 30 years... haven't seen a movie in the last thirty years, in America, which so asks us to understand and be <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoes</b> of a person suffering so profoundly.

2500|$|In {{practice}} {{very few}} derivative claims were successfully brought, given {{the complexity and}} narrowness in the exceptions to the rule in Foss v Harbottle. This was witnessed {{by the fact that}} successful cases on directors' duties before the Companies Act 2006 seldom involved minority shareholders, rather than a new board, or a liquidator <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoes</b> of an insolvent company, suing former directors. The new requirements to bring a [...] "derivative claim" [...] are now codified in the Companies Act 2006 sections 261-264. Section 260 stipulates that such actions are concerned with suing directors for breach of a duty owed to the company. Under section 261 a shareholder must, first, show the court there is a good prima facie case to be made. This preliminary legal question is followed by the substantive questions in section 263. The court must refuse permission for the claim if the alleged breach has already been validly authorised or ratified by disinterested shareholders, or if it appears that allowing litigation would undermine the company's success by the criteria laid out in section 172. If none of these [...] "negative" [...] criteria are fulfilled, the court then weighs up seven [...] "positive" [...] criteria. Again it asks whether, under the guidelines in section 172, allowing the action to continue would promote the company's success. It also asks whether the claimant is acting in good faith, whether the claimant could start an action in her own name, whether authorisation or ratification has happened or is likely to, and pays particular regard to the views of the independent and disinterested shareholders. This represented a shift from, and a replacement of, the complex pre-2006 position, by giving courts more discretion to allow meritorious claims. Still, the first cases showed the courts remaining conservative. In other respects the law remains the same. According to Wallersteiner v Moir (No 2), minority shareholders will be indemnified for the costs of a derivative claim by the company, even if it ultimately fails.|$|E
