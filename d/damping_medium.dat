An inclinometer contains a ball sealed inside a curved glass tube, which also contains a liquid {{to act as a}} <b>damping</b> <b>medium.</b> The original form of the indicator is in effect a spirit level with the tube curved in the opposite direction and a bubble replacing the ball. In some early aircraft the indicator was merely a pendulum with a dashpot for damping.The ball gives an indication of whether the aircraft is slipping, skidding or in coordinated flight. The ball's movement is caused by the force of gravity and the aircraft's centripetal acceleration. When the ball is centered {{in the middle of the}} tube, the aircraft is said to be in coordinated flight. If the ball is on the inside (wing down side) of a turn, the aircraft is slipping. And finally, when the ball is on the outside (wing up side) of the turn, the aircraft is skidding.|$|E

50|$|Mechanical {{detection}} in bio-MEMS {{is achieved}} through micro- and nano-scale cantilevers for stress sensing and mass sensing, or micro- and nano-scale plates or membranes. In stress sensing, the biochemical reaction is performed selectively {{on one side}} of the cantilever to cause a change in surface free energy. This results in bending of the cantilever that is measurable either optically (laser reflection into a quadposition detector) or electrically (piezo-resistor at the fixed edge of the cantilever) due to a change in surface stress. In mass sensing, the cantilever vibrates at its resonant frequency as measured electrically or optically. When a biochemical reaction takes place and is captured on the cantilever, the mass of the cantilever changes, as does the resonant frequency. Mass sensing is not as effective in fluids because the minimum detectable mass is much higher in <b>damped</b> <b>mediums,</b> something that is overcome with plates or membranes. The advantage of using cantilever sensors is that there is no need for an optically detectable label on the analyte or bioreceptors.|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn this article, {{the effect}} of {{dissipation}} on local and global stability of fluid conveying pipes is analyzed. The local approach refers to an infinite medium and uses wave propagation analyses without taking boundary conditions into account. The global approach refers to the same medium, but with finite length and associated with a given set of boundary conditions. The finite length system is generally studied by calculating its eigenmodes and eigenfrequencies. Criteria for local instability are derived {{in the first part}} of this paper, and dissipation is found to significantly affect local stability. Moreover, dissipation is found to have a stabilizing or destabilizing effect, depending on the other parameters. Next, numerical computations are presented for finite-length systems and results are analyzed and compared with local stability properties of the corresponding media. When the system is sufficiently long, it is found that critical velocity for global instability tends to a local criterion which can be that of local stability of the <b>damped</b> <b>medium</b> or a local transition criterion of the undamped medium, which is not necessarily the local instability criterion. Finally, a reasoning based on lengthscale ratios is developed. It allows to know which criterion is able to predict the global stability for long systems. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Although the loss modulus decreases as function of frequency in case of viscoelastic behavior, which {{can be interpreted as}} a decrease of damping, the viscoelastic behavior still leads to an increased modal damping for mechanical structures. This advantage holds for inertial-mass-type dampers that are tuned for broad-banded resonance damping.

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{attaching}} {{dynamic vibration absorber}} (DVA) to a discrete multi-degree-of-freedom or continuous structure has been outlined in many papers and monographs. An impact damping system can overcome some limitations by impact as the <b>damping</b> <b>medium</b> and impact mass interaction as the damping mechanism. The paper contemplates the provision of DVA with the several of the impact masses. Such originally designed absorbers reduce vibration selectively in maximum vibration mode without introducing vibration in other modes. An impact damper is a passive control device which {{takes the form of}} a freely moving mass, constrained by stops attached to the structure under control, i. e. the primary structure. The damping results from the exchange of momentum during impacts between the mass and the stops as the structure vibrates. The paper contemplates the provision of the impact multi-mass DVA’s with masses collisions for additional damping. For some cases of DVA optimization such a design seems more effective than conventional multi-mass DVA with independent mass moving.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{vibration}} transmissibility {{characteristics of}} a cantilevered brass tube are controlled {{by means of an}} electro-rheological (ER) fluid which is employed as a constrained layer <b>damping</b> <b>medium.</b> The ER fluid, which is a 50 wt. % mixture of silicone oil and starch, was contained in the annular space formed between the outer surface of the tube and the inner surface of a bigger brass tube. It is shown that the modal characteristics of the tube depend on the electric field strength and on the height of the ER fluid. The modal frequencies of the tube increase as the electric field strength is increased and as the height of the ER fluid is increased. Also, the loss factors generally increase as the electric field is increased, but decrease as the height of ER fluid in the annular space is increased. When the annular space is 100 % filled with ER fluid, the fluid effectively couples the inner and outer tubes into one vibrating system. Overall, the modal transmissibility of the tube is least when the annular space is filled with the ER fluid to a level of 12. 5 % of the maximum and an electric field strength of 1 kV/mm is applied.

40|$|The paper {{outlines}} {{two approaches}} to the modelling of a biosensor which serves for the detection and quantitative measurement of microscopic amounts of biological sub-stances. The operation principle of this device {{is based on the}} excitation, propagation, and detection of acoustic sur-face shear waves in a multilayered structure that contacts a fluid containing a protein to be detected. The mathemat-ical model of such a structure involves large systems of coupled partial differential equations that describe piezo-electric, elastic, and hydrodynamic properties of the struc-ture. Because of the short wavelength, the implementation of such a model with finite elements in three dimensions re-quires a very fine mesh and, therefore, forces to use parallel computing. Thus, {{it would be useful to}} have a simple tool for a fast preliminary analysis which would provide infor-mation about the structure of solutions. The paper presents such a tool developed using harmonic analysis techniques that are based on the construction of travelling wave solu-tions in the multilayered structure of the biosensor under assumption that the structure is unbounded in horizontal and downward directions. These assumptions are reason-able because the real biosensor chip is embedded up to the surface into a very viscose <b>damping</b> <b>medium</b> to exclude the reflection of waves on side and bottom faces, which imi-tates the above mentioned unboundedness.

30|$|Methods for {{controlling}} train-induced vibration {{can also be}} designed based on the three stages, generation, propagation, and receiving. Damping attenuation at the source is the basic measure and the elastic support in railway substructures absorbs the energy transferred due to ground vibration propagation. Also vibration attenuation measured at the receiving end {{could be used for}} improving or revising the structural design, such as setting elastic pads for sensitive devices. The friction damping caused by irregularity of wheel–rail contact area is one of the basic requirements for train operation, so that the train-induced vibration cannot be eliminated but only be reduced. Moreover, the noise attenuation equipment for the receiving end is usually too expensive to be extensively applied in railways. Therefore, researchers focus on the propagation stage to found reasonable control methods like medium-based isolation. Asphalt concrete (AC) with high strength and flexibility has been used in the railway substructure as the <b>damping</b> <b>medium</b> for vibration attenuation. In particular, rubber-modified asphalt concrete (RMC) as a material for high-speed train foundation has benefited in train-induced vibration reduction [9]. In addition, asphalt sub-track layer, also known as asphalt underlayment, is quite commonly used in Japan and western European countries for high-speed railway construction and in the United States for track rehabilitation and maintenance [10]. However, the effect and performance of an AC sub-track layer as a mean for vibration attenuation needs to be evaluated using quantitative indicators [11].|$|E
40|$|Vibration {{problems}} {{are still the}} major constraint in modern machining processes that seek higher material removal rate, shorter process time, longer tool life and better product quality. Depending on the process, the weaker structure element can be the tool/tool holder, workpiece/fixture or both. When the tool/tool holder is {{the main source of}} vibration, the stability limit is determined in most cases by the ratio of length-to-diameter. Regenerative chatter is the most significant dynamic phenomenon generated through the interaction between machine tool and machining process. As a rule of thumb, the ratio between the tool’s overhang length and the tool’s diameter shouldn’t exceed 4 to maintain a stable machining process while using a conventional machining tool. While a longer tool overhang is needed for specific machining operations, vibration damping solutions are required to ensure a stable machining process. Vibration damping solutions include both active and passive damping solutions. In the passive damping solutions, <b>damping</b> <b>medium</b> such as viscoelastic material is used to transform the vibration strain energy into heat and thereby reduce vibration amplitude. For a typical cantilever tool, the highest oscillation displacement is near the anti-node regions of a vibration mode and the highest oscillation strain energy is concentrated at the node of a vibration mode. Viscoelastic materials have been successfully applied in these regions to exhibit their damping property. The node region of the 1 st bending mode is at the joint interfaces where the cantilever tools are clamped. In this thesis, the general method {{that can be used to}} measure and characterize the joint interface stiffness and damping properties is developed and improved, joint interfaces’ importance at optimizing the dynamic stiffness of the joint interface is studied, and a novel advancing material that is designed to possess both high young’s modulus and high damping property is introduced. In the joint interface characterization model, a method that can measure the joint interface’s stiffness and damping over the full frequency range with only the assembled structure is presented. With the influence of a joint interface’s normal pressure on its stiffness and damping, an optimized joint interface normal pressure is selected for delivering a stable machining process against chatter with a boring bar setting at 6. 5 times overhang length to diameter ratio in an internal turning process. The novel advancing material utilizes the carbon nano particles mixed in a metal matrix, and it can deliver both high damping property and high elastic stiffness to the mechanical structure.

Three adaptive computation algorithms including Kalman filtering, Adaline, and recursive least squares have been compared to estimate the synchronizing and damping torque coefficients. The steady-state performance of the three adaptive techniques is compared with the conventional static least squares technique by conducting computer simulations at different loading conditions.

Whether or not the liver is capable of sustaining rhythms independent of a central pacemaker is controversial. Whether and how circadian information may be shared among cells in the liver in order to sustain oscillations is currently unknown. RESULTS: In this study we isolated primary hepatocytes from transgenic Per 2 (Luc) mice and used bioluminescence as a read-out {{of the state of the}} circadian clock. Hepatocytes cultured in a collagen gel sandwich configuration exhibited persistent circadian rhythms for several weeks. The amplitude of the rhythms <b>damped,</b> but <b>medium</b> changes consistently reset the phase and amplitude of the cultures. Cry 2 (-/-) Per 2 (Luc) cells oscillated robustly and expressed a longer period. Co-culturing with wildtype cells did not significantly shorten the period, indicating that coupling among hepatocytes is insufficient to synchronize cells with significantly differing periods. However, spatial patterns revealed by cellular imaging of wildtype cultures provided evidence of weak local coupling among the hepatocytes. CONCLUSIONS: Our results with primary hepatocyte cultures demonstrate that cultured hepatocytes are weakly coupled. While this coupling is not sufficient to sustain global synchrony, it does increase local synchrony, which may stabilize the circadian rhythms of peripheral oscillators, such as the liver, against noise in the entraining signals...|$|R

40|$|Long range wakefields are {{a serious}} concern for a fu-ture linear {{collider}} based on room temperature accelerat-ing structures. They can be suppressed either by detuning and or local damping or with {{some combination of}} both strategies. Detuning relies on precisely phasing the con-tributions of the dipole modes excited by {{the passage of a}} single bunch. This is accomplished by controlling individ-ual mode frequencies, a process which dictates individual cell dimensional tolerances. Each mode must be excited with the correct strength; this in turn, determines cell-to-cell alignment tolerances. In contrast, in a locally damped structure, the modes are attenuated at the cell level. Clearly, mode frequencies and relative excitation become less crit-ical in that context; mechanical fabrication tolerances can be relaxed. While local damping is ideal from the stand-point of long range wakefield suppression, this comes at the cost of reducing the shunt impedance and possibly unac-ceptable localized heating.
