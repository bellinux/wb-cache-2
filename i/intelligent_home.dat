40|$|Ambient Intelligence (AmI) {{research}} is {{giving birth to}} a multitude of futuristic home scenarios and applications; however a clear discrepancy between current installations and research-level designs can be easily noticed. Whether this gap {{is due to the}} natural distance between research and engineered applications or to mismatching of needs and solutions remains to be understood. This paper discusses the results of a survey about user expectations with respect to <b>intelligent</b> <b>homes.</b> Starting from a very simple and open question about what users would ask to their <b>intelligent</b> <b>homes,</b> we derived user perceptions about what <b>intelligent</b> <b>homes</b> can do, and we analyzed to what extent current research solutions, as well as commercially available systems, address these emerging needs. Interestingly, most user concerns about smart homes involve comfort and household tasks and most of them can be currently addressed by existing commercial systems, or by suitable combinations of them. A clear trend emerges from the poll findings: the technical gap between user expectations and current solutions is actually narrower and easier to bridge than it may appear, but users perceive this gap as wide and limiting, thus requiring the AmI community to establish a more effective communication with final users, with an increased attention to real-world deploymen...|$|R

40|$|The {{near future}} will see an {{increasing}} demand of elder care and {{a shortage of}} professional and infor- mal caregivers. In this context, ageing societies would benefit from the design of <b>intelligent</b> <b>homes</b> that provide assistance. The choice of interfaces between the assistive environment and the user is of great importance and determines the degree of user acceptance of this technology. Socially assistive robots {{are one of the}} most promising interfaces. Their embodiment and multimodal communication channels could potentially provide a large number of services that otherwise would have to be carried out by a variety of dedicated systems. Furthermore, evidence suggests that people perceive robots more as companions and social actors than tools and this is likely to steer user acceptance positively. This paper presents the authors’ work related to the EU-FP 7 project KSERA, a project that aims at introducing a socially assistive robot that acts as a proactive communication interface in smart home environments. In particular, it gives an overview of (1) human–robot interaction studies conducted in Eindhoven (The Netherlands) whose general aim was to preliminary assess the added value of socially assistive robots in <b>intelligent</b> <b>homes</b> and (2) the KSERA project field trials in Schwechat (Vienna) and Tel Aviv (Israel) that tested an integrated smart-home/robot system with real end users (N= 16) in three real-world scenarios.

Customer participation in power markets can then be achieved using demand side management and distributed generation, which can optimize service quality, meet the diverse needs of customers, and improve power efficiency. With the acquisition of energy consumption information at the appliance level and two-way communication between users and the grid, demand response can be effectively applied in SEU.|$|R

50|$|Designed as an <b>intelligent</b> <b>home</b> appliance, {{the robotic}} flower has {{a variety of}} {{different}} functions. Primarily, the flower robot is used as a background sensing device, as it contains sensors for temperature, pressure, voice and light intensity.

In addition, the flower robot is capable of small movements using its servos, which can be used to mimic the blooming flower and the stirring of leaves in the wind, creating an aesthetically pleasing environment. Other functions of the flower robot include vision or voice recording, illumination and the use of a scent emitter and a humidifier.|$|E

40|$|Purpose - This paper aims {{to review}} the extant <b>intelligent</b> <b>home</b> {{specifications}} and put forward a new dimension for the specifications of <b>intelligent</b> <b>home</b> (IHS). Design/methodology/approach - This study adopts a learning (bottom-up) algorithm which {{emphasizes the importance of}} learning and adaptability to the dynamic environmental changes in the IHS. Findings - The study finds that the <b>intelligent</b> <b>home</b> has been characterized by automation, integration of facilities and communication. However, it is contended here that an <b>intelligent</b> <b>home</b> specification in such a hard-wired (top-down) approach cannot be sustained {{in the light of the}} continuous changes of user requirements. Hence, adaptation to users' needs must be encompassed in a system of home intelligence.
