40|$|Given a large {{network and}} a query node, finding its top-k similar nodes is a {{primitive}} operation in many graph-based applications. Recently enhancing search results with diversification have received much attention. In this paper, we explore an novel problem {{of searching for}} top-k diversified similar nodes in attributed networks, with the motivation that modeling diversification in an attributed network should consider both the emergence of network links and the attribute features of nodes such as user profile information. We formulate this practical problem as two optimization problems: the Attributed Coverage Diversification (ACD) problem and the r-Dissimilar Attributed Coverage Diversification (r-DACD) problem. Based on the submodularity and the monotonicity of ACD, we propose an efficient greedy algorithm achieving a tight approximation guarantee of 1 - 1 /e. Unlike the <b>expension</b> based methods only considering nodes' neighborhood, ACD generalize the definition of diversification to nodes' own features. To capture diversification in topological structure of networks, the r-DACD problem introduce a dissimilarity constraint. We refer to this problem as the Dissimilarity Constrained Non-monotone Submodular Maximization (DCNSM) problem. We prove {{that there is no}} constant-factor approximation for DCNSM, and also present an efficient greedy algorithms achieving 1 /ρ approximation, where ρ<Δ, Δ is the maximum degree of its dissimilarity based graph. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first approximation algorithm for the Submodular Maximization problem with a distance constraint. The experimental results on real-world attributed network datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods, and confirm that adding dissimilarity constraint can significantly enhance the performance of diversification.

The work reported in this thesis has studied the nature of the microfluctuations of the wavefront aberrations of the eye and has investigated factors that influence the microfluctuations. The fluctuations in the ocular surface of the eye were investigated using high speed videokeratoscopy which measures the dynamics of the ocular surface topography. Ocular surface height difference maps were computed to illustrate the changes in the tear film in the inter-blink interval. The videokeratoscopy data was used to derive the ocular surface wavefront aberrations up to the 4 th radial order of the Zernike polynomial <b>expension.</b> We examined the ocular surface dynamics and temporal changes in the ocular surface wavefront aberrations in the inter-blink interval. During the first 0. 5 sec following a blink, the tear thickness at the upper edge of the topography map appeared to thicken by about 2 microns. The influence of pulse and instantaneous pulse rate on the microfluctuations in the corneal wavefront aberrations was also investigated. The fluctuations in ocular surface wavefront aberrations were found to be uncorrelated with the pulse and instantaneous heart rates. In the clinical measurement of the ocular surface topography using videokeratoscopy, capturing images 2 to 3 seconds after a blink will result in more consistent results. To investigate fluctuations in the wavefront aberrations of the eye and their relation to pulse and respiration frequencies we used a wavefront sensor to measure the dynamics of the aberrations up to the Zernike polynomial 4 th radial order. Simultaneously, the subject's pulse rate was measured, from which the instantaneous heart rate was derived. An auto-regressive process was used to derive the power spectra of the Zernike aberration signals, as well as pulse and instantaneous heart rate signals. Linear regression analysis was performed between the frequency components of Zernike aberrations and the pulse and instantaneous heart rate frequencies. Cross spectrum density and coherence analyses were also applied to investigate the relation between fluctuations of wavefront aberrations and pulse and instantaneous heart rate. The correlations between fluctuations of individual Zernike aberrations were also determined. A frequency component of all Zernike aberrations up to the 4 th radial order was found to be significantly correlated with the pulse frequency (all > 2 R 0. 51, p 2 R 0. 46, p< 0. 05). The major correlations among Zernike aberrations occurred between second order and fourth order aberrations with the same angular frequencies. Higher order aberrations appear to be related to the cardiopulmonary system in a similar way to that reported for the accommodation signal and pupil fluctuations. A wavefront sensor and high speed videokeratoscopy were used to investigate the contribution of the ocular surface, the effect of stimulus vergence, and refractive error on the microfluctuations of the wavefront aberrations of the eye. The fluctuations of the Zernike wavefront aberrations were quantified by their variations around the mean and using power spectrum analysis. Integrated power was determined in two regions: 0. 1 Hz ─ 0. 7 Hz (low frequencies) and 0. 8 Hz ─ 1. 8 Hz (high frequencies). Changes in the ocular surface topography were measured using high speed videokeratoscopy and variations in the ocular wavefront aberrations were calculated. The microfluctuations of wavefront aberrations in the ocular surface were found to be small compared with the microfluctuations of the wavefront aberrations in the total eye. The variations in defocus while viewing a closer target at 2 D and 4 D stimulus vergence were found to be significantly greater than variations in defocus when viewing a far target. This increase in defocus fluctuations occurred in both the low and high frequency regions (all p< 0. 001) of the power spectra. The microfluctuations in astigmatism and most of the 3 rd order and 4 th order Zernike wavefront aberrations of the total eye were found to significantly increase with the magnitude of myopia. The experiments reported in this thesis have demonstrated the characteristics of the microfluctuations of the wavefront aberrations of the eye and have shown some of the factors that can influence the fluctuations. Major fluctuation frequencies of the eye's wavefront aberrations were shown to be significantly correlated with the pulse and instantaneous heart rate frequencies. Fluctuations in the ocular surface wavefront aberrations made a small contribution to those of the total eye. Changing stimulus vergence primarily affected the fluctuations of defocus in both low and high frequency components. Variations in astigmatism and most 3 rd and 4 th order aberrations were associated with refractive error magnitude. These findings will aid our fundamental understanding of the complex visual optics of the human eye and may allow the opportunity for better dynamic correction of the aberrations with adaptive optics...|$|E
