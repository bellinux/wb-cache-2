5000|$|Delta Omega {{values the}} {{advancement}} of public health education, practice and research and has therefore taken on an initiative to preserve Public Health Classics. For the past decade, the society has sought to preserve and promote public health history by identifying and reprinting classic works in public health. Classics may be books, scientific journal articles, technical reports, legislation or other written publications or multi-media productions. The classics are selected for their historical value and {{significant contribution to the}} profession and science of public health. These <b>documents</b> are usually <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>print</b> or not widely available in libraries. Delta Omega places the classics on its Web site to make them freely available to all members.|$|R

50|$|Since the {{original}} prints were made before Slightly Stoopid were well known, they are rare {{and hard to}} come by. Original prints used to sell on eBay consistently at around $300 because <b>of</b> its <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>print</b> status {{and the demand for}} the hidden track with Bradley Nowell. It was <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>print</b> for 10 years and in 2006 was re-released together with their second album Longest Barrel Ride as a double album.

40|$|This note {{argues that}} the Copyright Act should be changed to permit {{compensated}} importation where the underlying work is <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>print</b> in the United States. Part I discusses the relevant sections of the Copyright Act and their interpretation by the courts. Part II demonstrates that compensated importation should be allowed when a work is <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>print</b> in the United States. Part III proposes a solution into eh form of a compulsory license for out-of-print imports where the work has been <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>print</b> in the United States for a certain length of time. This note concludes that {{the interests of the}} creators and of the public would be better served by allowing importation of works that are <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>print</b> in the United states...|$|R
5000|$|Publishers {{may choose}} to list a book as [...] "out of stock indefinitely", instead <b>of</b> declaring it <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>print,</b> as the {{publisher}} may {{have to give up}} copyright when declaring it <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>print.</b> Publishers will often let a book go <b>out</b> <b>of</b> stock for long periods, then reprint the book, usually with a new cover and formatting, to catch the presumably built up demand for the book. The author or their estate may have copyright reverted to them once the publisher has declared it <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>print.</b>|$|R
