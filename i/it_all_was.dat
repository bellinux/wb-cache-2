25|$|The first National Day Parade {{started in}} the morning at 9:00a.m. that day. People came as early as 7:00a.m. in order to get good vantage points. Singapore's first President, Mr Yusof bin Ishak and Singapore's first Prime Minister, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, were seated with members of the {{government}} at the grandstand on the steps of City Hall. When the parade began, 6 military contingents (including the Singapore Infantry Regiment, SPDF and the then Republic of Singapore Police), a mobile column from the SIR, and various schools and civil contingents marched past City Hall and then into the city streets. Three military bands accompanied the parade inspection and later the march past with military music. The Singapore Fire Brigade also took part in this first parade with its firetrucks included in the mobile column. Rounding <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>was</b> a massed lion and dragon dance performance from drum and dragon troupes nationwide.|$|E

Evidence was analysed by scientists from the Forensic Science Service (FSS) in Birmingham. Martin Whittaker, the scientist who headed the FSS team, spoke of the huge volume of evidence: [...] "The team pulled together every strand of forensic evidence to create a kind of 'spider's web' and in the centre of <b>it</b> <b>all...</b> <b>was</b> Philip Smith. In 20 years of working for the FSS, I have never had to deal with so much evidence in relation to one suspect. It was quite overwhelming." ...|$|E

500|$|IGN's Matt Risley {{rated the}} episode an 8 out of 10, calling it more [...] "classically, indulgently, infectiously Christmassy" [...] than the {{previous}} Christmas specials. He praised the production design and special effects teams for [...] "creating some dazzlingly memorable special effects, and a winter wonderland that was both recognisably, fuzzily Christmas incarnate and unerringly, tensely alien" [...] but thought the supporting cast [...] "triumphed above and beyond" [...] the plot devices. Like Hogan, Risley commented that the comedian cast of Bailey and Weir as well as Armstrong [...] "felt lacking". However, the next year, Risley wrote that he [...] "got a little carried away with the festive funtimes ... On reflection, the overwhelming Christmassyness of <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>was</b> overcompensating for a pretty flimsy, frivolous plot." [...] Nick Setchfield of SFX gave the special {{four out of five}} stars, praising Smith's acting and Blackburn's Doctor Who directing debut as well as the special effects. However, he thought that the lack of a villain was an [...] "interesting experiment, but maybe not ideal for Christmas Day" [...] and Bailey and Weir's forest rangers [...] "felt like bolt-on comic relief".|$|E
500|$|For {{her work}} as Sue Ellen, Gray was {{nominated}} for a Primetime Emmy Award in the category [...] "Best Actress in a Drama Series" [...] in 1981 (Barbara Bel Geddes who played Miss Ellie Ewing was also nominated in that category for Dallas that year). Gray was also nominated for a Golden Globe Award in both 1980 and 1981 in the category of [...] "Best Performance by an Actress in a Television Series - Drama" [...] respectively. The character of Sue Ellen was well received by television critics. The Biography Channel said, [...] "Who could ever forget Dallas with the gin-swilling Sue Ellen Ewing, replete with shoulder pads long before Dynasty, staggering around Southfork Ranch with a permanently tearful expression as she suffered the brunt of J.R. Ewing's evil ways?" [...] The Boulevard Magazine said, It may be 2009 and seventeen years since the primetime drama Dallas went off the air, but memories of the Ewing family still linger. Corruption and betrayal, lies, greed, affairs and scandal – all were just part of another day at the Southfork Ranch. At the center of <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>was</b> one of our favorite Ewings, the person we couldn't help but root for each week as she drank and slept her way through one ordeal after another. This, of course, was the tortured and (sometimes) villainous Sue Ellen Shepard Ewing, former Texas beauty queen and trophy wife of the womanizing rogue J.R. Ewing, played to perfection by actress Linda Gray.|$|E

In tribute to his legacy and boxing career, a PBS documentary summarized [...] "Dempsey's boxing style consisted of constantly bobbing and weaving. His attacks were furious and sustained. Behind <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>was</b> rage. His aggressive behavior prompted a rule that boxers had to retreat to a neutral corner and give opponents who had been knocked down {{a chance to get}} up."

Fight for the crown!' and people chanting 'Don't give it up! Don't secede!'

[...] Helen was also upset that [...] "the pageant {{did not come to}} my support, they felt I needed to resign." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although {{the initial}} concept was to [...] "net" [...] ASDIC data, in 1947 {{attention}} {{turned to the}} aircraft plotting problem.

The 984 would so increase the amount of data available that plotting <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>was</b> seen as a serious concern. The first complete system was demonstrated at Elliott's Borehamwood research center in June 1950. This eventually led to a contract for two prototype versions; the original prototype was delivered as [...] "X1" [...] to the Admiralty Research Establishment in Witley in 1951, and a second newly built model, [...] "X2", which was paid for by the US Navy's Bureau of Ships but officially on permanent loan to the US Naval Research Laboratory.|$|E

2500|$|The {{existence}} of the conflict in Laos was sometimes reported in the U.S., and described in press reports as the CIA's [...] "Secret War in Laos" [...] because details were largely unavailable due to official government denials that the war existed. The denials were seen as necessary considering that the North Vietnamese government and the U.S. had both signed agreements specifying the neutrality of Laos. U.S. involvement was considered necessary because the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (DRV) had effectively conquered {{a large part of}} the country and was equally obfuscating its role in Laos. [...] Despite these denials, however, the Civil War was actually the largest U.S. covert operation prior to the Soviet–Afghan War, with areas of Laos controlled by North Vietnam subjected to years of intense US aerial bombardment, representing the heaviest bombing campaign in history. [...] Overshadowing <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>was</b> the struggle of the Cold War, with the United States' policy of the containment of communism and the policies of the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union of spreading communism via subversion and insurgency.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the success}} of The Ostrobothnians, Madetoja {{departed}} for France, staying for six months in Houilles, a small town just outside of Paris. Here, in the quiet of the Parisian suburbs, Madetoja began to compose his Third Symphony, Op. 55, and upon returning to Finland in October (due to financial worries), {{his work on the}} project continued. The new symphony received its premiere in Helsinki on 8 April 1926, and although Madetoja received the usual praise, the audience and critics found the new work somewhat perplexing: with the monumental, elegiac Second Symphony having set expectations, the optimism and restraint of the Third came as a surprise, its (subsequent) significance eluding nearly everyone. Some years later, the French music writer, Henri-Claude Fantapié, described the cheerful, pastorale Third Symphony as a [...] "sinfonia Gallica" [...] in spirit and explained the premiere as thus: [...] "The listeners expected the opera [...] to be followed by a nationalistic anthem and were disappointed to hear something that seemed to them to be hermetic and that, to crown <b>it</b> <b>all,</b> <b>was</b> lacking in pomposity and solemnity … the properties the majority of Finnish music-lovers always expect in a new work." [...] Nevertheless, today the Third Symphony is widely regarded as Madetoja's [...] "masterpiece", the rare Finnish symphony equal in stature to Sibelius's seven essays in the form.|$|E

2500|$|Though their 1989 {{debut album}} Blood, Sweat and No Tears was a {{moderate}} success, Sick of It All did not achieve commercial success until later albums. After {{the release of}} their second album Just Look Around in 1992, East West Records saw the band's potential and signed them in 1993. Sick of It All's third and major label debut album, Scratch the Surface, was released in 1994 to critical acclaim, and included the singles [...] "Scratch the Surface" [...] and [...] "Step Down" [...] (the video for the latter single would also be featured in the 1995 Beavis and Butt-head episode [...] "Premature Evacuation"). Their 1997 follow-up Built to Last was also highly acclaimed. Despite the success of Built to Last, Sick of <b>It</b> <b>All</b> <b>was</b> dropped from East West and signed to Fat Wreck Chords in 1998, who released the band's next three albums before being dropped from the label in 2005, when they signed to Abacus Records, a subsidiary of Century Media. This label released their eighth studio album Death to Tyrants in 2006 to positive reviews (Abacus eventually went out of business, though Sick of It All would remain on Century Media, which released the band's next three albums).

2500|$|Papen {{published}} {{a number of}} books and memoirs, in which he defended his policies and dealt with the years 1930 to 1933 as well as early western Cold War politics. Papen praised the Schuman Plan as [...] "wise and statesmanlike" [...] and believed in the economic and military unification and integration of Western Europe. In 1952 and 1953, Papen published his memoirs in two volumes in Switzerland, in which he used much ink complaining about how unfair <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>was</b> that people blamed him for bringing Hitler to power, thus making him at least partly responsible for everything that happened in Germany between 1933 and 1945. Papen made the incredible claim in his memoirs that he did not bring Hitler to power as he was only negotiating with Hitler to save the Schleicher government, which somehow ended with Hitler becoming Chancellor and Papen Vice-Chancellor in the same cabinet through no fault of his own. Weinberg called Papen's 1952 memoir Der Wahrheit eine Gasse [...] "mostly fiction" [...] as Papen recounted in much detail his courageous career as an anti-Nazi resistance fighter who sabotaged Hitler's policies. Right up until his death in 1969, Papen often gave speeches and wrote articles in the newspapers defending himself against the charge that he had {{played a crucial role in}} having Hitler appointed Chancellor and that he had served a criminal regime, which led to vitriolic exchanges with West German historians, journalists and political scientists. Rolfs wrote that Papen was [...] "no match" [...] for his [...] "scholarly" [...] critics and [...] "...his [...] "amateurish and often erroneous rebuttals failed to alter his image". Rolfs wrote: [...] "Papen's last years are a tragic record of a man who professed to follow his own conscience, but refused to acknowledge his contribution to Hitler's totalitarian system. Although he completely rejected the Nazi ideology, his willingness to continue to serve Hitler weakened all of his protestations and criticisms of National Socialism". Franz von Papen died in Obersasbach, West Germany, on 2 May 1969 at the age of 89.|$|E
2500|$|By this time, however, he {{had decided}} to further his {{education}} at a first-rate university. His first choice was Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee. But he soon realized that he probably would not pass Vanderbilt's tough entrance examinations. So, in 1895, at the age of 28, Lomax matriculated at the University of Texas at Austin, majoring in English literature, and undertaking almost a double course load (including Greek, Latin, and Anglo Saxon) and was graduated in two years. With a touch of Texas hyperbole, he later wrote:Never was there such a hopeless hodge-podge, There was I, a Chautauqua-educated country boy who couldn't conjugate an English verb or decline a pronoun, attempting to master three other languages at the same time. ... But I plunged on through the year, for since I was older than the average freshman, I must hurry, hurry, hurry. I don't think I ever stopped to think how foolish <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>was.</b> In his memoir, Adventures of a Ballad Hunter, Lomax recounts how he had arrived at the University of Texas with a roll of cowboy songs he had written down in childhood. He showed them to an English professor, Morgan Callaway, only to have them discounted as [...] "cheap and unworthy," [...] prompting Lomax to take the bundle behind the men's dormitory and burn it. His interest in folksongs thus rebuffed, Lomax focused his attentions on more acceptable academic pursuits. He joined the fraternity Phi Delta Theta and the Rusk Literary Society, as well as becoming an editor and later the editor-in-chief of the University of Texas Magazine. During the summer of 1896, he attended a summer school program in Chicago studying languages. In 1897, he became an associate editor of the Alcalde, a student newspaper. After graduation in June 1897, he worked at the University of Texas as registrar for the next six years until the spring of 1903. He also had other duties such as being personal secretary to the President of the University, manager of Brackenridge Hall (the men's dormitory on campus), and serving on the Alumni Scholarship Committee. Lomax joined a campus fraternity known as The Great and Honorable Order of Gooroos receiving the title [...] "Sybillene Priest".|$|E
