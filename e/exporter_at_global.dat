40|$|Employing the {{appropriate}} strategy was critical in building successful software industry {{in many developing}} countries. Through innovative strategies, a number of developing nations were able to create unique software industry models that emerged as strong software <b>exporters</b> <b>at</b> the <b>global</b> level. The main similarity among these strategies was the market orientation; almost all of these strategies were export oriented, software products were produced in the developing countries to satisfy external market demands in the developed world. The need for newer innovative strategies remains a critical success factor for new entrants to the software industry. One of the suggested strategies by the literature was the inward strategy or {{the focus on the}} domestic market needs. This paper employs a quantitative approach to identify a possible strategy that Arab countries may adopt to build their own software industry when industry success factors exist in these countries. An analysis of data from published reports and from public databases was used to examine the situation in Saudi Arabia. The goals of this study were, first to pin point the possible strategy that Saudi Arabia may adopt to build its own software industry, second to examine the existence of the software industry success factors in Saudi Arabia. The most significant finding from this study suggested that Saudi Arabia can adopt the inward strategy to build a new software industry model to serve the country’s oil and gas industry needs of software. Additionally, this study revealed that Saudi Arabia acquire a number of the software industry success factors like the software demand, the financial resources, and the IT infrastructure while other factors like the quantity of science and technology graduates and the intellectual property and copy right laws are weak and need improvements...|$|R

50|$|Prior to 1970, {{there were}} ten {{countries}} that nationalized oil production: the Soviet Union in 1918, Bolivia in 1937 and 1969, Mexico in 1938, Iran in 1951, Iraq in 1961, Burma and Egypt in 1962, Argentina in 1963, Indonesia in 1963, and Peru in 1968. Although these countries were nationalized by 1971, {{all of the}} “important” industries that existed in developing countries were still held by foreign firms.

40|$|The {{integration}} of the European Community countries into one single market has created much anticipation concerning how to conduct business in the post- 1992 European market.

The survey identifies three categories of <b>exporters</b> that are <b>at</b> different readiness levels [...] Ready, Preparing and Maintaining Exporters. Responses of smaller Indiana exporters in manufacturing industries to future market attractiveness in Europe, based on factors such as market characteristics, entry barriers, competitiveness, and U.

40|$|In {{the late}} nineteenth century, the United States imposed high tariffs to protect {{domestic}} manufacturers from foreign competition. This article examines the magnitude of protection given to import-competing producers and the costs imposed on export-oriented producers by focusing on changes in the domestic prices of traded goods relative to nontraded goods. The {{results suggest that the}} 30 percent average import tariff gave about a 17 percent implicit subsidy to import-competing producers and effectively taxed <b>exporters</b> <b>at</b> about 10 percent. Tariffs redistributed large amounts of income (about 8 percent of GDP), but the effect on consumers was roughly neutral. ...|$|R

TOE were fighting a constant battle with their USSR-suppliers in this direction, having to fill the gap left by the excellent but not-for-export Soviet lenses which would have been a major selling-point, by a hodge-podge selection of second-rate mass-market optics from Japan, albeit under the [...] "Helios" [...] label.|$|R

Employment, shipments, wages, productivity and capital intensity are all higher <b>at</b> <b>exporters</b> <b>at</b> any given moment. This paper asks whether good firms become exporters or whether exporting improves firm performance. The evidence is quite clear on one point: good firms become exporters, both growth rates and levels of success measures are higher ex-ante for exporters. The benefits of exporting for the firm are less clear. Employment growth and the probability of survival are both higher for exporters; however, productivity and wage growth is not superior...|$|R
