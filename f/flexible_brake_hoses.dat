It is found that large normal stresses σ_n, which may be helpful for the sealing performance, appear at the crimped portion between the nipple and inner rubber. The results suggest that several grooves putting at the surface of nipple are effective for causing large σ_n, which may improve the sealing performance and hose life. The effect of compression set of the rubber on the sealing performance is investigated, and the life of hydraulic <b>brake</b> <b>hose</b> is estimated form the maximum stress appearing near the groove on the nipple...|$|R

50|$|The ER5 has a {{twin piston}} front disk brake and a rear drum brake. Unlike many modern motorcycles, with fixed caliper and {{floating}} disk, the ER5 has a fixed disk and floating caliper. 'A' models have a trailing piston which {{is smaller than}} the leading piston but the later 'C' models have identical leading and trailing pistons, dramatically improving front braking. 'A' model owners often fit caliper units from 'C' models. As for most motorcycles, another common braking upgrade is to reduce sponginess by replacing the OEM <b>brake</b> <b>hose</b> with a braided <b>brake</b> <b>hose.</b>|$|R
50|$|Honda made a {{very focused}} effort to reduce and {{centralize}} overall weight. A lighter, narrower die-cast frame was formed using a new technique which Honda claimed allowed for very thin wall construction and only four castings to be welded together. Almost {{every part of the}} new bike was reengineered to reduce weight, including the sidestand, front <b>brake</b> <b>hoses,</b> <b>brake</b> rotors, battery, and wheels.|$|R
50|$|These {{systems are}} {{different}} to dragging equipment detectors, which {{are looking for}} anything dragging from the train connecting with the sleepers.Low Hose detectors are looking specifically between two wagons, to measure the droop of the <b>brake</b> <b>hoses.</b> The <b>brake</b> <b>hoses</b> need a bit of droop, but too much and they can hit or dislodge.Typically, these systems employ a vertical bar installed {{on one side of}} the track, with infrared sensors pointed across the track at a mate bar with receivers installed pointed back at the infrared beams. When a train goes past, the infrared sensors are looking in the coupling area specifically, and will alert if anything is detected in the area that is lower than acceptable.|$|R
40|$|Testing {{facilities}} {{such as the}} TU Delft Vehicle Test Lab (VTL) {{are needed}} to provide necessary experimental data to validate and to compare the performance of several ABS controllers like the Feed-Forward Braking controller. Before testing ABS controllers with the VTL measurement system, {{it needs to be}} improved first. Earlier measurements reported in [11] showed a lack of developed braking torque due to decreased bandwidth of the measurement setup. This problem could be within the hydraulic brake line of the VTL measurement setup. Pressure dynamics results of the original situation show a significant decrease when increasing the actuating frequency. Differences in pressure dynamics are examined by replacing the original <b>brake</b> <b>hose</b> with a stainless steel braided <b>brake</b> <b>hose.</b> Sinus wave excitation measurements show a relative small increase of the maximal reaching brake pressure with the design improvements situation. Random noise excitation measurements show increased bandwidth, compared to the frequency results reported in [4] and [11]. Improvements in brake pressure dynamics are realized by using a stainless steel braided <b>brake</b> <b>hose</b> in addition with relative low varying amplitudes.

50|$|In later years, Thomas' rear {{buffer beam}} has {{returned}} to the original higher position, although it is deeper to allow the buffers, coupling hook, and vacuum <b>brake</b> <b>hoses</b> to be in the correct position. Thomas also carries an electric light on the right-hand side of his front buffer beam and a red tail light mounted on the centre of his bunker, whereas the originals had removable kerosene lamps mounted on lamp irons, which Thomas incidentally has, although they are not used but instead included for continuity with the other engines.|$|R
50|$|The yard has eleven arrival tracks, two hump {{tracks and}} 40 {{classification}} tracks up to 920 m long. The freight wagons or sets of wagons are run {{over the hump}} and then retarded {{by a series of}} automatic retarders and finally pushed together for coupling. The wagons are then coupled together with their <b>brake</b> <b>hoses</b> and the <b>brakes</b> are tested by a remote-controlled brake test system. The entire marshalling operation is automatically controlled by a central electronic interlocking. Intervention by the signallers is only required if there is a fault.|$|R
50|$|The {{automatic}} center buffer coupler of AAR tight {{lock type}} at the coach end has a support frame which provides an anti-climbing protection. The coupler can be opened {{from the side}} by a lever. The design allows the use of screw coupler instead of center buffer coupler. Therefore a fixing plate for buffers is also provided. The inter-vehicle coupler for the supply of the 750 V from the generator car is located below the under-frame. Due to the moving situation 4 <b>brake</b> <b>hoses</b> are to be used at the coach end which are brought to two hoses behind the coupler.|$|R
2500|$|The {{compressor}} on {{the locomotive}} charges the main reservoir with air at [...] The train brakes are released by admitting {{air to the}} train pipe through the engineer's brake valve. A fully charged brake pipe is typically [...] for freight trains and [...] for passenger trains. The brakes are applied when the engineer moves the brake handle to the [...] "service" [...] position, which causes a reduction in pressure in the train pipe. In normal braking, the pressure in the train pipe does not reduce to zero. If it does fall to zero, (e.g., because of a broken <b>brake</b> <b>hose)</b> an emergency <b>brake</b> application will be made.|$|R
50|$|The {{chain brake}} was soon {{superseded}} by air operated or vacuum operated brakes. These <b>brakes</b> used <b>hoses</b> connecting all the wagons of a train, so the driver could apply or release the brakes {{with a single}} valve in the locomotive.|$|R
50|$|From the {{pressure}} differential valve, brake tubing carries {{the pressure}} to the brake units at the wheels. Since the wheels do not maintain a fixed relation to the automobile, {{it is necessary to}} use hydraulic <b>brake</b> <b>hose</b> {{from the end of the}} steel line at the vehicle frame to the caliper at the wheel. Allowing steel brake tubing to flex invites metal fatigue and, ultimately, brake failure. A common upgrade is to replace the standard rubber hoses with a set which are externally reinforced with braided stainless-steel wires; these have negligible expansion under pressure and can give a firmer feel to the brake pedal with less pedal travel for a given braking effort.|$|R
50|$|Railroads have strict government-approved {{air brake}} testing {{procedures}} for various circumstances when assembling trains or switching out cars en route.

In most cases, the engineer is able to use information from the ETD to verify that the air pressure reduces and increases {{at the rear of the}} train accordingly, indicating that proper brake pipe continuity. This device is said to constitute a fail-safe condition.|$|R
