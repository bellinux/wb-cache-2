40|$|During {{the last}} half century, {{identification}} of an ideal (predominantly entropic) protein elastomer was generally thought to require that the ideal protein elastomer be a random chain network. Here, we report two new sets of data and review previous data. The first set of new data utilizes atomic force microscopy to report single-chain force-extension curves for (GVGVP) (251) and (GVGIP) (260), and provides evidence for single-chain <b>ideal</b> <b>elasticity.</b> The second class of new data provides a direct contrast between low-frequency sound absorption (0. 1 - 10 kHz) exhibited by random-chain network elastomers and by elastin protein-based polymers. Earlier composition, dielectric relaxation (1 - 1000 MHz), thermoelasticity, molecular mechanics and dynamics calculations and thermodynamic and statistical mechanical analyses are presented, that combine with the new data to contrast with random-chain network rubbers and to detail the presence of regular non-random structural elements of the elastin-based systems that lose entropic elastomeric force upon thermal denaturation. The data and analyses affirm an earlier contrary argument that components of elastin, the elastic protein of the mammalian elastic fibre, and purified elastin fibre itself contain dynamic, non-random, regularly repeating structures that exhibit dominantly entropic elasticity {{by means of a}} damping of internal chain dynamics on extension...|$|E
40|$|Elastin-like {{polymers}} (ELPs) are {{a surprising}} kind of elastic biopolymers [1]. The best known model ELP is the polymer (VPGVG) n where V stands for L-Valine, G for Glycine, and P for L-Proline. This polymer exhibit some interesting features {{that make it}} an excellent candidate for some top nano(bio) tecnological applications. Among their main features are: their mechanical properties showing an almost <b>ideal</b> <b>elasticity,</b> {{although there are some}} derivatives can show a more thermoplastic behaviour; their extreme biocompatibility showing excellent results in all the tests made on these polymers; and an acute self-assembly and smart nature. This last feature is produced in a mechanism called the Inverse Temperature Transition (ITT), by which, in aqueous medium, there is a reversible phase transition when the temperature goes above a certain temperature (Tt). In this transition, the polymer changes from a soluble state to a segregated state with an acute increase in the solvent-polymer interaction parameter. Together with this phase transition there is dehydration and an increase in the conformational order adopting a regular non-random structure called β-spiral. With that conformational change there is a self-assemble of filaments of three β-spirals that finally gather to form nano- and micro-particles. The Tt depends on the polarity of the polymer chai...|$|E
40|$|Functional and {{singular}} integral equations with shift {{have been}} investigated in the paper. As a result criteria of the unilateral reversibility of functional operators with shift have been obtained {{for the first time}} in the Orlich's space with various assumptions about shift.

40|$|A {{conceptual}} {{difficulty in}} the Hooke's-law description of <b>ideal</b> Gaussian polymer-chain <b>elasticity</b> is sometimes apparent in analyses of experimental data or in physical models designed {{to simulate the}} behavior of biopolymers. The problem, the tendency of a chain to collapse {{in the absence of}} external forces, is examined in the following examples: DNA-stretching experiments, gel electrophoresis, and protein folding. We demonstrate that the application of a statisticalmechanically derived repulsive force, acting between the chain ends, whose magnitude is proportional to the absolute temperature and inversely proportional to the scalar end separation removes this difficulty...|$|R
40|$|The {{function}} of the resource allocation submodel within the IIASA Health Care System model is to simulate how the HCS allocates limited supplies of resources between competing demands. The principal outputs of the submodel are the numbers of patients treated, in different categories, and the modes and quotas of treatment they receive. This paper reviews the data which are available for estimating {{the parameters of the}} model, and develops methods which made direct use of historical allocation data. Separate procedures are developed for estimating <b>elasticities,</b> <b>ideal</b> levels of care, and resource costs. These procedures have been realized as computer programs, and their use is illustrated by three examples using hospital data...|$|R
30|$|Acting as {{a bridge}} between ECM and the cytoskeleton, {{integrin}} not only transmits signals between the cell and the ECM but also regulates cytoskeletal arrangement and therefore cell rigidity[28, 29]. We then wanted to test if the change of integrin β 1 is accompanied with the change of cell rigidity, and we did so using AFM to measure cell Young’s modulus of each differentiation stage. We found that Young’s modulus increased gradually throughout the differentiation process. It came to the maximum at 21 DD and was higher than NC in 15 DD, 18 DD, and 21 DD. Young’s modulus of 12 DD {{was similar to that}} of NC, having no statistically significant difference. Our data imply that 12 DD had the most <b>ideal</b> stiffness and <b>elasticity</b> for chondrocytes.|$|R
40|$|We use {{gradient}} Young measures {{generated by}} Lipschitz maps to define relaxation of integral functionals which {{are allowed to}} attain the value ∞ and can model <b>ideal</b> locking in <b>elasticity</b> as defined by Prager in 1957. We then show {{the existence of a}} minimizer for variational problems for elastic materials with energy densities that can be expressed in terms of a function being continuous in the deformation gradient and convex in the gradients of nonlinear minors of the corresponding deformation gradient. This newly introduced notion, called gradient polyconvexity, also allows for an implicit uniform positive lower bound on the determinant of the deformation gradient on the closure of the domain representing the elastic body although the second-order gradient of the deformation is not included in our model. Consequently, the material does not allow for extreme local compression...|$|R
40|$|This paper takes a microeconomic- and aggregation-theoretic {{approach}} to the empirical analysis {{of the relationship between}} private and government consumption. It provides estimates of the Morishima elasticities of substitution based on an empirical comparison and evaluation of the effectiveness of a number of well-known flexible functional forms - the locally flexible generalized Leontief (see Diewert (1971)), translog (see Christensen et al. (1975)), and Almost Ideal Demand System (AIDS) (see Deaton and Muellbauer (1980)), and the semi-nonparametric globally flexible Fourier (see Gallant (1981)) and Asymptotically Ideal Model (AIM) (see Barnett et al. (1991)). In doing so, we pay explicit attention to the theoretical regularity conditions of positivity, monotonicity, and curvature, using recent advances in microeconometrics. Our results indicate that substitutability describes the relationship between government and private consumption, and hence concur with the consensus opinion that government purchases are substitutes for private consumption.
