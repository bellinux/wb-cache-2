40|$|This {{paper is}} {{a review of}} the {{lightning}} protection of wind turbine blades in terms of on the layout and location of the down conductor system. Generally, the down conductors of a lightning protection system for wind turbine blades may be installed inside the blade or outside the blade. However, the <b>internal</b> <b>down</b> conductor approach has become a common practice for blade manufacturers. This is presumably due to the preference for the aerodynamic properties of the blades to be maintained. However, by having an <b>internal</b> <b>down</b> conductor, other problems occur (e. g. blade disintegration, burn due to the impact of lightning strikes). This paper discusses the possibility that an external down conductor might be more advantageous and concludes with some recommendations...|$|R

When a thermal power unit starts up, it generally requires a prescribed <b>down</b> <b>time</b> (minimum <b>down</b> <b>time).</b> Therefore, in this paper, {{we report on the}} unit commitment scheduling method which keeps the minimum <b>down</b> <b>time</b> and fits the total nitrogen oxides emissions to the constrained value. When the startup of the unit is impossible because of minimum <b>down</b> <b>time,</b> by recursive calculation, our method reviews the optimum operative pattern which keeps the minimum <b>down</b> <b>time.</b> Applying our method to a model system, we show the appropriateness of this method...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. [Purpose] The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the effects of resistance exercise strengthening the hip flexor and extensor muscles on functional gait of stroke patients. [Subjects and Methods] Twenty patients were randomized into two groups. Both groups performed conventional physical therapy for six weeks. The experi-mental group also performed isokinetic eccentric resistance exercises for the hip flexor and extensor muscles. The hip muscle strength, stair up and <b>down</b> <b>time,</b> TUG time(timed up and go test), and 10 m gait velocity were mea-sured at the baseline, and after 3 weeks, and 6 weeks of treatment. [Results] The experimental showed significant improvements compared to the baseline in hip muscle strength, stair up and <b>down</b> <b>time,</b> TUG time and 10 m gait velocity after 3 and 6 weeks of treatment. After 3 and 6 weeks of treatment, there were gains in hip muscle strength and 10 m gait velocity. The control group showed no significant increase in hip muscle strength, stair up and <b>down</b> <b>time,</b> TUG time or 10 m gait velocity. [Conclusion] We consider that conventional physical therapy contributes to the improvement of functional gait of stroke patients. However, it is more desirable to perform isokinetic eccentric resistance exercises for hip flexor and extensor muscles combined with conventional physical therapy for the im-provement of hip muscle strength, stair up and <b>down</b> <b>time,</b> TUG time and 10 m gait velocity...|$|R
