25|$|For Hegel, {{the inner}} {{movement}} of reality {{is the process}} of God thinking, as manifested {{in the evolution of the}} universe of nature and thought; that is, Hegel argued that, when fully and properly understood, reality is being thought by God as manifested in a person's comprehension of this process <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>through</b> philosophy. Since human thought is the image and fulfillment of God's thought, God is not ineffable (so incomprehensible as to be unutterable) but can be understood by an analysis of thought and reality. Just as humans continually correct their concepts of reality through a dialectical process, so God himself becomes more fully manifested through the dialectical process of becoming.|$|E
25|$|Like their predecessors, the Wolfstür (Wolf's door) of the Aachen Cathedral and the Marktportal (Market Portal) of the Mainz Cathedral, the Bernward Doors were {{manufactured}} {{using the}} Lost-wax process, which puts exceptional {{demands on the}} workers of the casting workshop, since the mold can only be used once. The individual scenes of the doors were carved from massive wax or tallow tablets by modellers and then combined, supported by an iron frame, which is probably how the slight irregularities in the bands which divide the individual scenes came about. Even the doorknockers {{in the form of}} grotesque lion's heads with rings of grace in their mouths were included in the original mold rather than being soldered on later. Technical analysis has shown that the mold was stood on the long side and filled with bronze, so that the molten metal would spread evenly; investigation has found cooling cracks in the metal. The result of this process was probably still rather rough, covered in metal bumps from the pipes in the mold through which the metal was poured <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>through</b> which air escaped and it would have had to have been worked over and polished up in great detail.|$|E

25|$|Määttä's solid {{performance}} during the Pittsburgh Penguins' training camp, buoyed by {{an injury to}} defenceman Kris Letang, earned him {{a spot on the}} team's NHL roster to begin the 2013–14 season. He scored the first points of his NHL career on 8 October 2013, assisting on two goals by Jussi Jokinen in the Penguins' 5–2 win over the Carolina Hurricanes. On 19 October, Määttä then scored his first career NHL goal against Vancouver Canucks goaltender Roberto Luongo. Through the Christmas holiday, Määttä had appeared in every game the Penguins had played <b>in</b> <b>and,</b> <b>through</b> the first two months of the season, was playing typical minutes for a third-pair defencemen (usually under 20 minutes per game). However, due to a rash of injuries suffered by other Penguins' blueliners (notably the broken legs by Rob Scuderi and Paul Martin), Määttä saw an uptick in his ice time, going from an average of just over 16 minutes in October and November to 21-and-a-half minutes a game through four weeks in December. This increased time was not wasted, as Määttä increased his point production from five points in 28 games in the first two months to seven points in 12 games in December. As a member of the top defensive pair for Pittsburgh (alongside either Kris Letang or Matt Niskanen), Määttä {{played a key role in}} the Penguins' 10–2 run in the absence of much of their defensive corps, allowing more than three goals only once in that 12-game span.|$|E

500|$|Along the California coast, {{the cooler}} water {{sets up a}} surface marine layer that is much cooler than inland areas during the summer. [...] At the same time, the intense heating inland creates a {{pronounced}} thermal trough aligned with the Great Central Valley and typically linked to the broader thermal low across the North American deserts. [...] As a consequence, a strong pressure gradient is created which draws cool marine air landward. [...] As temperatures plummet, fog and stratus stream <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>through</b> the gaps of the Coast Ranges, and especially through the Golden Gate at San Francisco (see San Francisco fog). [...] The same thermal trough is sometimes pushed toward the coast, especially in late Fall as higher pressure develops to the east due to cooling further east.

2500|$|Discussing sexual perversion, Scruton {{argues that}} its [...] "major {{structural}} feature" [...] is the [...] "complete or partial failure to recognise, <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>through</b> desire, the personal {{existence of the}} other", {{which in turn is}} [...] "an affront, both to him and oneself." [...] Scruton calls perversion, [...] "narcissistic, often solipsistic". In his chapter on perversion, Scruton considers masturbation, bestiality, necrophilia, pedophilia, sado-masochism, homosexuality, incest, and fetishism. Scruton argues that there are two forms of masturbation, and only one is perverted. Scruton argues that homosexuality is significantly different from heterosexuality, and that this helps to explain the traditional judgment that homosexuality is a perversion. Heterosexuality involves dealing with the different and complementary nature of the opposite sex, whereas homosexuality does not: [...] "Desire directed towards the other gender elicits not its simulacrum but its complement." [...] Scruton writes that, [...] "In the heterosexual act, it might be said, I move out from my body towards the other, whose flesh is unknown to me; while in the homosexual act I remain locked within my body narcissistically contemplating in the other an excitement that is the mirror of my own." [...] Scruton dismisses the classical scholar Kenneth Dover's Greek Homosexuality (1978) as [...] "trivialising" [...] and faults Michael Levin's arguments for the abnormality of homosexuality, calling them absurd. In Scruton's view, normal sexuality involves not only giving recognition to the other's person <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>through</b> desire for him or her, but also according them accountability and care in the process. Scruton argues that sex is morally permissible only if it involves love and intimacy.|$|E

Idolatry {{is one of three}} sins (along with {{adultery}} and murder) the Mishnah says must be resisted to the point of death. By the time the Talmud was written, the acceptance or rejection of idolatry was a litmus test for Jewish identity: [...] "Whosoever denies idols is called a Jew". [...] "Whosoever recognizes idols has denied the entire Torah; and whosoever denies idols has recognized the entire Torah." [...] The Talmud discusses the subject of idolatry in many passages.

2500|$|Dorsey Pender's {{promising}} career {{ended at}} the Battle of Gettysburg. On July 1, 1863, his division moved {{in support of}} Maj. Gen.

Uncharacteristically for the normally aggressive Pender, he did not immediately charge in to assist Heth, but took up positions on Herr Ridge and awaited developments. In Heth's second assault of the day, Hill ordered Pender to support Heth, but Heth declined the assistance and Pender once again kept his division in the rear. For {{the second time in}} the day, Heth got more than he bargained for in his assault on McPherson's Ridge.

2500|$|The {{observatory}} {{was built}} between mid-1960 and November 1963 and designed by William E. Gordon of Cornell University, who {{intended to use}} it to study Earth's ionosphere. He was attracted to the sinkholes in the karst regions of Puerto Rico that offered perfect cavities for a very large dish. Originally, a fixed parabolic reflector was envisioned, pointing in a fixed direction with a [...] tower to hold equipment at the focus. This design would have limited its use in other research areas, such as radar astronomy, radio astronomy and atmospheric science, which require the ability to point at different positions in the sky and track those positions for an extended time as Earth rotates. Ward Low of the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) pointed out this flaw and put Gordon in touch with the Air Force Cambridge Research Laboratory (AFCRL) in Boston, Massachusetts, where one group headed by Phil Blacksmith was working on spherical reflectors and another group was studying the propagation of radio waves <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>through</b> the upper atmosphere. Cornell University proposed the project to ARPA in mid-1958 and a contract was signed between the AFCRL and the University in November 1959. Cornell University and Zachary Sears published a request for proposals (RFP) asking for a design to support a feed moving along a spherical surface [...] above the stationary reflector. The RFP suggested a tripod or a tower in the center to support the feed. On the day the project for the design and construction of the antenna was announced at Cornell University, Gordon had also envisioned a [...] tower centered in the [...] reflector to support the feed.|$|E
