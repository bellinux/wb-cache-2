50|$|A major {{drawback}} of HVDC systems using line-commutated converters is {{that the}} converters inherently consume reactive power.

50|$|Bird's eye maple, or bird's eye extinction, is a {{specific}} type of extinction exhibited by minerals of the mica group under cross polarized light of the petrographic microscope. It gives the mineral a pebbly appearance as it passes into extinction. This is caused when the grinding tools used to create petrographic thin sections of precise thickness alter the alignment of the previously perfect basal cleavage planes which split micas up into its characteristic thin sheets. The resulting, slightly roughened surface alters the <b>extinction</b> <b>angle</b> of various parts of the crystal lattice, leading to this type of extinction. Since it is not a natural feature of the mineral, bird's eye maple is not observed in all mica crystals, nor from all angles, but it is quite common, and is used as a diagnostic feature for micas.|$|E
50|$|Line-commutated {{converters}} {{have some}} limitations {{in their use}} for HVDC systems. This results from requiring the AC circuit {{to turn off the}} thyristor current and the need {{for a short period of}} 'reverse' voltage to effect the turn-off (turn-off time). An attempt to address these limitations is the Capacitor-Commutated Converter (CCC) which has been used in a small number of HVDC systems. The CCC differs from a conventional HVDC system in that it has series capacitors inserted into the AC line connections, either on the primary or secondary side of the converter transformer. The series capacitors partially offset the commutating inductance of the converter and help to reduce fault currents. This also allows a smaller <b>extinction</b> <b>angle</b> to be used with a converter/inverter, reducing the need for reactive power support.However, CCC has remained only a niche application because of the advent of voltage-source converters (VSC) which completely eliminate the need for an extinction (turn-off) time.|$|E
