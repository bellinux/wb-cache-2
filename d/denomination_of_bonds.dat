50|$|The World Currency Unit (WCU) is an indexed {{unit of account}} (unit of account) {{that stands}} for a unit of real global {{purchasing}} power. Proposed by Lok Sang Ho of Lingnan University, Hong Kong, it was first intended to {{be the basis for}} denominating global bonds, a debt instrument that is issued globally and subscribable by people and institutions around the world. Since each unit by design represents a stable unit of purchasing power, the stipulated interest rate on WCU-denominated bonds represents a real interest rate.

50|$|Table 2 shows series <b>of</b> <b>bonds</b> and CDs with {{staggered}} maturities whose coupon {{and principal}} payments will match {{the stream of}} income shown in the Target Cash Flows column in Table 1 (rates are fictitious for this example). The cash flow generated by the portfolio {{for the first year}} would be $100,380. This consists of the principal <b>of</b> the <b>bond</b> maturing on February 15 next year plus the coupon interest payments flowing from all the other bonds. The same would be true for the following year and every year thereafter. The total cash flows generated over the eight years sum to $889,350, compared to the target cash flow sum of $889,234, a difference of only $116. As with the first year, the cash flows are very close to the target cash flows needed for each year. The match cannot be perfect because bonds must usually be purchased in <b>denominations</b> <b>of</b> $1,000 (municipal <b>bonds</b> in <b>denominations</b> <b>of</b> $5,000). However, with the use of fairly sophisticated mathematical optimization techniques, correlations of 99 percent or better can usually be obtained. These techniques also determine which bonds to buy so as to minimize the cost of meeting the cash flows, which in this example is $747,325. Note that in this example, the bonds all mature on February 15, the middle of the first quarter. Other dates may be used, of course, such as the anniversary date of the portfolio’s implementation.|$|R

40|$|We {{make use}} of micro-level data for over 45, 000 private bonds issued by over 5000 firms from 22 {{countries}} in 1990 - 2006 to analyze the impact that {{the launch of the}} EMU had on the currency <b>denomination</b> <b>of</b> the <b>bond</b> issues. To our knowledge, ours is the first systematic analysis of issue at the micro level. The use of the micro data allows us to distinguish between the response to the advent of the euro by new and seasoned bond issuers, and to condition on other issue characteristics. We find that the impact on new issuers is larger than on seasoned issuers and that most of the increase in the euro-denominated bond issuance was along the "extensive" margin. Insofar as new entrants to the bond market will define the overall currency composition in the long run, these results imply that aggregate studies might be underestimating the euro effect. We also find that to a large extent the increase in euro issuance was "at the expense" of U. S. dollar issuance, suggesting that the euro competes with the U. S. dollar as a currency of choice for international financial transactions. Bond market; Euro...|$|R
50|$|The Act {{replaced}} the service certificates awarded to veterans under the World War Adjusted Compensation Act <b>of</b> 1924 with <b>bonds</b> {{issued by the}} Treasury Department in <b>denominations</b> <b>of</b> $50.

The bonds could not be sold, but the Treasury would redeem them for cash at any time after June 15, 1936. Most veterans redeemed their bonds promptly. The Treasury issued bonds worth $1.745 billion initially. Between June 1935 and June 1936, 80% <b>of</b> the <b>bonds</b> issued had been redeemed. The Treasury paid more than $800 million in cash in the last 2 weeks of 1936 and almost $700 million more in the next year. The cash payments constituted an efficient economic stimulus, since the program required little government administration, the monies were likely to be spent without delay, and the entire process did not require the long lead time of a public works program.|$|R
