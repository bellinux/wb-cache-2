5|$|A {{fighter pilot}} based at Andrews Air Force Base, Billy Hutchison, claims that {{while in the}} air he spotted Flight 93 on his scope and planned to first fire his {{training}} rounds into the engine and cockpit, and then ram the airplane with his own jet. His account was published in Lynn Spencer's book Touching History. John Farmer, Senior Counsel to the 9/11 commission, pointed out that this account would have been impossible, as Hutchison's Air Andrews Squadron {{was not in the}} air until 10:38, almost 30 minutes after Flight 93 had crashed. When the 9/11 commission asked Hutchison why he gave this <b>false</b> <b>claim</b> he stormed {{out of the room and}} refused to give an answer.|$|E
5|$|The English claimed {{sovereignty}} {{based on}} the <b>false</b> <b>claim</b> that Svalbard was discovered by Hugh Willoughby in 1553, that James I had annexed it in 1614 {{and that it was}} the English who had started whaling. The Netherlands stated that whaling could not be the basis for claiming sovereignty. The issue ended in a political deadlock, with Denmark–Norway and England both claiming sovereignty and France, the Netherlands and Spain claiming the archipelago a free zone under mare liberum. Although Denmark–Norway never formally gave up its claim to Svalbard, the archipelago continued to be a terra nullius—a land without a government.|$|E
5|$|In February 2003, Love {{was banned}} from Virgin Airlines by founder Richard Branson after being arrested at Heathrow Airport for disrupting a flight. In October of that year, {{in the midst}} of what Love would later admit was a serious cocaine and {{prescription}} drug addiction, she was arrested in Los Angeles after breaking several windows of her producer and then-boyfriend James Barber's home, and was charged with being under the influence of a controlled substance; the ordeal resulted in her losing custody of her daughter. On March 18, 2004, Love was arrested in New York City for allegedly striking a 24-year-old male fan with a microphone stand at a concert at the Bowery Ballroom. Four days later, on March 22, Love called in multiple times to The Howard Stern Show, making various claims and speaking erratically; in broadcast conversations with Stern, she claimed that the incident with the fan had not occurred, and that actress Natasha Lyonne, who was at the concert, was told by the alleged victim that he had been paid $10,000 to file a <b>false</b> <b>claim</b> leading to Love's arrest. She pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct in October 2004.|$|E

50|$|In July 2005, Judge T. S.

The Judge also ruled that money paid for by the Development Funds for Iraq (DFI) could not be prosecuted under the <b>False</b> <b>Claims</b> Act, as the US government was not involved in administering these funds. In March 2006, a jury found Custer Battles liable for the submission of 5 <b>false</b> <b>claims,</b> each one of which is subject to a US$5,000 -11,000 civil fine, as well as 26 false statements supporting the 5 <b>false</b> <b>claims.</b> However, in August 2006, Judge Ellis overturned the verdict as a matter of law.|$|R

In 2005 London secured the bid for the 2012 Summer Games with a cost estimate that two years later proved inadequate and was revised upwards with around 100 percent.

During the latter, which saw Codreanu's conviction for treason, Antonescu vouched for his friend's honesty while shaking his {{hand in front of}} the jury. Upon the end of procedures, the king ordered his former minister interned at Predeal, before assigning him to command the Third Army in the remote eastern region of Bessarabia (and later removing him after Antonescu expressed sympathy for Guardists imprisoned in Chișinău). Attempting to discredit his rival, Carol also ordered Antonescu's wife to be tried for bigamy, based on a <b>false</b> <b>claim</b> that her divorce had not been finalized. Defended by Mihai Antonescu, the officer was able to prove his detractors wrong. Codreanu himself was taken into custody and discreetly killed by the Gendarmes acting on Carol's orders (November 1938).|$|E
40|$|Competition law in many {{countries}} prohibits firms from making <b>false</b> <b>claims</b> about product quality or performance to potential buyers and also requires that the truth of specific claims be supported by adequate prior testing. This paper explores the differences between these two policies and asks, among other questions, whether a policy of mandatory prior substantiation has any incremental effect if a ban on <b>false</b> <b>claims</b> is in place. This paper develops a model in which firms have private information about their probability of having a high quality product {{and are able to}} determine product quality with certainty through costly learning. Penalties for <b>false</b> <b>claims</b> and for unsubstantiated claims create an opportunity for firms to credibly reveal their information and for signaling to emerge in equilibrium. I show that the two kinds of penalties affect the possibility of signaling in different ways, and that the mandatory substantiation requirement in many circumstances improves buyer information and social welfare beyond what is achieved by a ban on <b>false</b> <b>claims</b> alone. It is therefore not redundant to a <b>false</b> <b>claims</b> ban, but is a useful additional policy tool in markets characterized by asymmetric information...|$|R

Adi persuaded the latter to return to Islam, which they agreed to. However, they refused to abandon their tribesmen in Buzakha, fearing Tulayha would hold them hostage if he discovered they joined the Muslims. Thus, Adi and the Muslim Tayyids devised a strategy to lure the Tayy in Tulayha's camp to return to Jabal Tayy by issuing a <b>false</b> <b>claim</b> that the Muslims were attacking them. When the apostate Tayyids reached their tribesmen in Jabal Tayy, far from Tulayha's reach, they discovered the false alarm and were persuaded to rejoin Islam. With this, the entirety of the Al al-Ghawth had returned to the Muslim side. However, the Al Jadila remained in revolt and the Muslim commander Khalid ibn al-Walid was set to move against them. He was stopped by the intercession of Adi, who was able secure the Al Jadila's allegiance through diplomacy.|$|E
