40|$|Objectives A {{cross-sectional}} {{investigation was}} designed to assess the quality of local government plans for public health emergencies and to determine whether relevant regulations for <b>emergency</b> <b>plans</b> are in place. Methods Sixty-six municipalities were selected randomly using stratified sampling, and a questionnaire investigation on <b>emergency</b> <b>plans</b> was conducted in these municipalities. Results The findings show that approximately 50 % of <b>emergency</b> <b>plans</b> omitted important content; less than 50 % of municipalities had established three regulations for <b>emergency</b> <b>plans.</b> Conclusions Based on the analysis, the quality of existing public health <b>emergency</b> <b>plans</b> is not sufficient. More than 50 % of municipalities lack regulations for <b>emergency</b> <b>plans.</b> Suggestions regarding the responsibility of government at different levels are made. First, central government should draw up a set of standard development procedures and a standard template for <b>emergency</b> <b>plans.</b> Secondly, local governments should revise their plans. Thirdly, local govern-ments should establish regulations for <b>emergency</b> <b>plans</b> as soon as possible...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} {{a model of}} performance indicators applied to nuclear emergency exercises {{for the assessment of}} a nuclear energy plan. The model was designed from the relationship between the actions forecasted in a nuclear <b>emergency</b> <b>plan</b> and the objectives challenged in emergency exercises. The nuclear <b>emergency</b> <b>plan</b> comprises a protocol that addresses structures, actions and procedures aimed at controlling and minimizing the effects of a nuclear <b>emergency.</b> The <b>emergency</b> <b>plan</b> is the last level of defense in depth used to ensure nuclear safety. Thus, the <b>emergency</b> <b>plan</b> must be efficient in preparing and organizing current means in order to ensure and assure an adequate protection of the population in the case of accidents in nuclear power plants. The model of performance indicators developed is based on the functional dependence observed in several different nuclear <b>emergency</b> <b>plans,</b> which facilitates the analysis of the state of preparedness of nuclear emergency response organizations. The model allows comparing different stages of preparedness of a nuclear <b>emergency</b> <b>plan</b> as well as nuclear <b>emergency</b> <b>plans</b> for different facilities...|$|R
40|$|<b>Emergency</b> <b>plans</b> play {{a central}} role in {{emergency}} management processes. However, the technical problems associated to <b>emergency</b> <b>plan</b> development have received very little attention. As a matter of fact, most <b>emergency</b> <b>plans</b> are printed documents prepared with the sole support of a word processing system. As a consequence, new media are the exception in current plans. Moreover, the plans are developed without any methodological support that guides planners through the plan development process. In this paper we introduce DPL(EP), a method for the development of <b>emergency</b> <b>plans.</b> Based on the Document Product Lines process for the development of variable content document families, its main goal is to provide methodological guidance and tool support for the development of <b>emergency</b> <b>plans.</b> The distinguishing characteristics of the method are: first, the use of feature models to describe variability in <b>emergency</b> <b>plan</b> content and in the representation of the plan components; second, the “one organization-one plan ” philosophy of the development process that produces customized plan editors; and third, its product line nature that enforces reuse of information elements, making plan development more convenient...|$|R
5|$|Elemental bromine is toxic {{and causes}} {{chemical}} burns on human flesh. Inhaling bromine gas results in similar irritation of the respiratory tract, causing coughing, choking, and shortness of breath, and death if inhaled in large enough amounts. Chronic exposure {{may lead to}} frequent bronchial infections and a general deterioration of health. As a strong oxidising agent, bromine is incompatible with most organic and inorganic compounds. Caution is required when transporting bromine; it is commonly carried in steel tanks lined with lead, supported by strong metal frames. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) of the United States has set a permissible exposure limit (PEL) for bromine at a time-weighted average (TWA) of 0.1ppm. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a recommended exposure limit (REL) of TWA 0.1ppm and a short-term limit of 0.3ppm. The exposure to bromine immediately dangerous to life and health (IDLH) is 3ppm. Bromine is classified as an extremely hazardous substance in the United States as defined in Section 302 of the U.S. <b>Emergency</b> <b>Planning</b> and Community Right-to-Know Act (42 U.S.C. 11002), and is subject to strict reporting requirements by facilities which produce, store, or use it in significant quantities.|$|E

40|$|In {{the event}} of a {{disaster}} in Germany a so-called executive staff is set up. In support of their work they refer to <b>emergency</b> <b>plans,</b> which describe the chronological order of a set of suitable measures for a dedicated event e. g. an evacuation.

In this paper we present a model for a workflow management system (WfMS) for supporting the modeling, execution and management of <b>emergency</b> <b>plans</b> before and during a disaster. It is {{based on the idea that}} <b>emergency</b> <b>plans</b> are similar to business processes and can therefore be modeled as workflows. In contrast to most traditional WfMS, the introduced approach supports unstructured activities and their delegation as well as the management of resources. Furthermore, we analyze drawbacks of the current process for disaster management using <b>emergency</b> <b>plans...</b>|$|R
