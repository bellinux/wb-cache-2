5|$|Domitian's {{tendency}} towards micromanagement {{was nowhere}} more <b>evident</b> <b>than</b> in his financial policy. The {{question of whether}} Domitian left the Roman Empire in debt or with a surplus {{at the time of}} his death has been fiercely debated. The evidence points to a balanced economy for the greater part of Domitian's reign. Upon his accession he revalued the Roman currency dramatically. He increased the silver purity of the denarius from 90% to 98% — the actual silver weight increasing from 2.87grams to 3.26grams. A financial crisis in 85 forced a devaluation of the silver purity and weight to 93.5% and 3.04grams respectively.|$|E
5|$|While {{the designs}} for the corps de logis were {{confined}} by the foundations of Harrison's earlier plan, the secondary wings and precincts were not. Abandoning completely Harrisons concept of bedrooms set in terraces beneath the corp de logis, Blore's assistant architect, Hunt, opted for the typical vast sprawling wings and servants' quarters of the 19th century English country house. These took {{full advantage of the}} gradients and topography of the site, and with their courtyards came to resemble a small medieval, fortified town of towers and high castellated walls. Nowhere is this more <b>evident</b> <b>than</b> the Shuvalov Passage, an enclosed carriage drive squeezed between the high walls of two wings, leading from the castellated Western Gatehouse to the forecourt before the northern facade. The passage, which twists and turn beneath high wall and towers and even passes under a bridge, resembles the street of a medieval town, rather than the approach to a country house.|$|E

Nowhere is this more <b>evident</b> <b>than</b> at Castle Coole in Northern Ireland. The entire servant's quarters were put underground into cellars, lit only by windows at the bottom of grated pits. The only means of approach was through a single underground tunnel, the entrance of which was concealed by the brow of a landscaped hill some distance from the house.|$|E

25|$|Not {{much was}} {{expected}} of the Drillers, nowhere more <b>evident</b> <b>than</b> in the pre-season coaches poll that had them pegged to finish 4–36. Such opinions were hardly unexpected though, as the Power were a dismal 6–34 the year prior. Even then {{most of the players}} inherited were good for little more than trade bait as the NPSL required that teams could field no more than four imports. Experienced players were very hard to come by, as not only had there not been any Canadian teams prior to provide a talent base, but there was another Canadian team entering the league that year, the Toronto Shooting Stars, and they had a head start on finding players.|$|E
25|$|The United States, meanwhile, saw league bowling soar in the 1960s {{and early}} 1970s—partially {{influenced}} by popular professional bowlers Don Carter, Dick Weber, Carmen Salvino and Earl Anthony. The number of sanctioned bowling alleys in the U.S. peaked at about 12,000 in the mid-1960s, while {{membership in the}} American Bowling Congress also peaked at just under 4.6million male bowlers. The popularity of the sport in America was perhaps no more <b>evident</b> <b>than</b> when Don Carter became the first athlete of any kind to sign a US$1million endorsement contract, inking a multi-year deal with Ebonite International in 1964. By comparison, Arnold Palmer earned just $5,000 in 1961 endorsing Wilson golf equipment, and NFL quarterback Joe Namath made just $10,000 in 1968 to famously shave off his moustache with a Schick razor.|$|E
500|$|As Cutt argues, [...] "the great {{overriding}} {{metaphor of}} all [...] {{work is the}} representation of divine order by the harmonious family relationship (inevitably set in its own pastoral Eden)[...] [...] No writer made it clearer to her readers that the child who is dutiful within his family is blessed {{in the sight of}} God; or stressed more firmly that family bonds are but the earthly and visible end of a spiritual bond running up to the very throne of God." [...] Demers has referred to this [...] "consciously double vision" [...] as the quintessentially Romantic element of Sherwood's writing.

500|$|Façades {{of churches}} often came to {{resemble}} wedding cakes rather than {{places of worship}} as the architects grew in confidence, competence, and stature. Church interiors, which until this date had been slightly pedestrian, came especially in Palermo to be decorated in a riot of inlaid marbles {{of a wide variety}} of colours. Anthony Blunt has described this decoration as [...] "either fascinating or repulsive, but however the individual spectator may react to it, this style is a characteristic manifestation of Sicilian exuberance, and must be classed amongst the most important and original creations of Baroque art on the island". This is the key to Sicilian Baroque; it was ideally matched to the Sicilian personality, and this was the reason it evolved so dramatically on the island. Nowhere in Sicily is the development of the new Baroque style more <b>evident</b> <b>than</b> in Ragusa and Catania.|$|E
500|$|While Hemingway {{painstakingly}} describes seemingly extraneous minutiae from Nick's fishing trip, he avoids or barely {{hints at}} {{the driving force of}} the work: the emotional turmoil wrought on Nick by his return home from a catastrophic war. Hemingway has said he believes this avoidance made the heart and thrust of the story all the more acute, writing [...] "'Big Two-Hearted River' is about a boy beat to the wide coming home from the war.... beat to the wide was an earlier and possibly more severe form of beat, since those who had been were unable to comment on this condition and could not suffer that it be mentioned in their presence.

2500|$|Since {{the end of}} the Cultural Revolution (1966–76), the {{education}} system in China has been geared toward economic modernization. In 1985, the national government ceded responsibility for basic education to local governments through the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party's [...] "Decision on the Reform of the Educational Structure." [...] In unveiling {{the education}} reform plan in May 1985, the authorities called for nine years of compulsory education and the establishment of the State Education Commission (created the following month). Official commitment to improved education was nowhere more <b>evident</b> <b>than</b> in the substantial increase in funds for education in the Seventh Five-Year Plan (1986–90), which amounted to 72 percent more than funds allotted to education in the previous plan period (1981–85). In 1986 some 16.8 percent of the state budget was earmarked for education, compared with 10.4 percent in 1984. Since 1949, education has been a focus of controversy in China. As a result of continual intraparty realignments, official policy alternated between ideological imperatives and practical efforts to further national development. But ideology and pragmatism often have been incompatible. The Great Leap Forward (1958–60) and the Socialist Education Movement (1962–65) sought to end deeply rooted academic elitism, to narrow social and cultural gaps between workers and peasants and between urban and rural populations, and to eliminate the tendency of scholars and intellectuals to disdain manual labor. During the Cultural Revolution, universal fostering of social equality was an overriding priority.|$|E

By contrast, concentrations of poverty remained in certain rural areas, particularly the northwest, north-central coast, and central highlands.|$|R
