5|$|The pelagic {{stingray}} is not aggressive and rarely encountered {{because of its}} habitat preferences, but its very long tail spine demands extreme caution be exercised in <b>handling</b> <b>it.</b> It {{has been responsible for}} two known fatalities: a worker on a tuna longliner who was impaled by a captured ray, and another fishery worker who succumbed to tetanus days after being stung. This species has been kept in public aquariums for almost a century.|$|E
5|$|Kate Kane {{operates}} in Gotham City as the hero, Batwoman, while also being the mysterious #52 of the Gotham Knights baseball team. She gets {{to save the}} Wayne family from a mugger, making her a true hero to {{the eyes of a}} young Bruce Wayne. Kate has had some military experience (she served as an American volunteer in the Spanish Civil War, where she was the lover of the Republican soldier Renee Montoya) and currently runs her father’s company, <b>handling</b> <b>it</b> through the Great Depression. She is also in a relationship with Detective Maggie Sawyer. She is later enlisted by Amanda Waller to fight in the war along with several other heroines. Before she leaves Gotham, Kate makes her cousin Bette, another baseball player from the rival Gotham Griffins team, the new protector of the city.|$|E
5|$|Shilts {{praised the}} Public Health Department of San Francisco's {{handling}} of the new communicable disease as they tracked down people who were sick and linked them to other people who had symptoms, although {{some of them were}} living {{in different parts of the}} country. He criticized the New York City Public Health Department for doing very little, specifically when Public Health Director David Sencer refused to call AIDS an emergency and stated that the Public Health Department need not do anything because the gay community was <b>handling</b> <b>it</b> sufficiently.|$|E

5|$|The King Charles is a {{friendly}} breed, {{to the extent}} that it is not typically as suitable as a watchdog as some breeds, though it may still bark to warn its owners of an approaching visitor. It is not a high energy breed, and enjoys the company of family members, being primarily a lapdog. Although able to bond well with children and tolerant of them, it will not accept rough <b>handling.</b> <b>It</b> prefers not to be left alone for long periods. Known as one of the quietest toy breeds, it is suitable for apartment living.|$|E
5|$|The arms contain tension sensors so the octopus {{knows whether}} its arms are {{stretched}} out, {{but this is}} not sufficient for the brain to determine the position of the octopus's body or arms. As a result, the octopus does not possess stereognosis; that is, it does not form a mental image of the overall shape of the object it is <b>handling.</b> <b>It</b> can detect local texture variations, but cannot integrate the information into a larger picture. The neurological autonomy of the arms means the octopus has great difficulty learning about the detailed effects of its motions. It has a poor proprioceptive sense, and it only knows what exact motions were made by observing the arms visually.|$|E
5|$|There {{are eight}} {{distinct}} call types made by Sunda slow loris adults, {{which can be}} divided into two categories: contact and contact-seeking calls such as whistles and short keckers (a social play and attention-seeking call), and aggressive and defensive calls such as long keckers, screams, snarls and grunts. Because they rely on crypsis to avoid predators, they do not make alarm calls. Infants emits clicks and squeaks when disturbed. During estrus, females make whistle calls when in visual contact with a male. When exploring new environments and during <b>handling,</b> <b>it</b> makes ultrasonic vocalisations out of the human hearing range.|$|E

25|$|The Winchester Model 1907 is a blowback-operated, {{semi-automatic}} rifle {{produced by the}} Winchester Repeating Arms Company beginning in 1906 with production ending in 1958. It fired a cartridge of intermediate power (roughly equivalent in energy to the 7.62x39), cycled through a semi-automatic operating mechanism, fed by a detachable magazine. It was fed from a 5, 10, or 15 round detachable box magazine located immediately forward of the trigger guard. In size and <b>handling,</b> <b>it</b> is much like an M1 carbine, though the 1907 is heavier and fires a much harder hitting round.|$|E

The 205 was regularly the bestselling car in France, {{and was also}} very popular {{in other parts of}} Europe, including Britain, where sales regularly topped 50,000 a year by the late 1980s.

25|$|Only one {{aircraft}} was built, with the serial J8622. It was first flown on 24 February 1928, {{powered by a}} Gnome-Rhône Jupiter as the planned Jupiter VIII was unavailable. Testing showed that the aircraft had poor handling and was prone to vibration, and it was modified with a 2ft (0.61m) longer fuselage and a revised tail, which improved <b>handling.</b> <b>It</b> was decided to modify the aircraft {{so that it could}} meet the requirements of Specification 24/25 to replace the Horsely in its other role as a shore-based torpedo bomber.|$|E
25|$|The covered bowl is {{a vessel}} of {{particular}} interest. It is the earliest {{object in the}} hoard, {{and the only one}} whose general area of manufacture within the Roman Empire is known for certain. It belongs to a type that is known to have been manufactured in Gaul in the 3rd century AD. It has a narrow horizontal flange set below the upright rim and decorated with scroll patterns inlaid in niello, and a small nielloed rosette within the centre base. It has a high, domed lid that fits neatly over the vertical rim and has been decorated in a very different style, with two friezes of low-relief decoration. The upper zone consists of conventional foliate ornament, while the lower is a scene of centaurs attacking various wild animals, separated by Bacchic masks. The small raised rim {{at the top of the}} lid would have sufficed for <b>handling</b> <b>it,</b> but set within it is a 'knob' in the form of a silver-gilt statuette of a young, seated triton blowing a conch shell. This figure may well be a secondary addition to the lid; and the lid, in 4th century style, is certainly a secondary addition to the bowl.|$|E
