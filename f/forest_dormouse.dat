50|$|The Balochistan <b>forest</b> <b>dormouse</b> (Dryomys niethammeri) is {{a species}} of rodent in the family Gliridae.It is endemic to Pakistan.It is an {{endangered}} animal.|$|E
5000|$|Dryomys is a genus of dormouse. [...] Collectively {{the members}} of the genus are {{referred}} to as forest dormice, although the type species also goes by the common name <b>forest</b> <b>dormouse.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{range of}} the <b>forest</b> <b>dormouse</b> is from Switzerland in the west, through central, eastern and {{southern}} Europe, the Balkan Peninsula, northward to the Baltic Sea and eastward to the Volga River and the Ural Mountains in Russia. Isolated populations occur outside this range, including in Israel, central Iran, Afghanistan, the Tien Shan mountains and Sinkiang in China. The <b>forest</b> <b>dormouse</b> lives {{in a wide range}} of habitats, including broad-leaved, mixed and coniferous woodlands. It is also found in rocky areas, dwarf montane woodland, evergreen shrubland and wood-steppe. It is reported to be found at altitudes up to 3,500 m.|$|E
50|$|<b>Forest</b> <b>dormice</b> {{produce a}} variety of noises for {{a variety of}} reasons. The most {{significant}} is the sound for an alarm call which is a melodious squeak. They also have the ability to produce ultrasounds which are used for communication. The different communication methods that <b>forest</b> <b>dormice</b> use are visual, tactile, acoustic, and chemical. It is not known exactly how these forms of communication are used specifically for this species. However, it is known that most mammals use tactile communication during mating, conflict, and raising young. Chemical communication can {{play a significant role in}} being able to identify a specific individual. Visual cues are given off by body posture as a way to designate whether it is a hostile or friendly environment. The different perception methods that <b>forest</b> <b>dormice</b> use are visual, tactile, ultrasound, and chemical.|$|R
50|$|<b>Forest</b> <b>dormice</b> {{are very}} aggressive. Not even in captivity are they tame. It {{has been noted}} that they may allow humans to pet them. However, when efforts are made to hold them, they bite with their sharp teeth. If {{agitated}} while resting they may wake up suddenly, leap high, spit, and hiss. <b>Forest</b> <b>dormice</b> may {{have a negative impact}} for humans due to raiding fruit orchards and chewing on the bark of coniferous trees. They have also been known to be vectors for such diseases as tick-borne encephalitis, leptospirosis, and possibly the Black Death. They may have a positive impact by controlling arthropod populations and scattering seeds.|$|R
50|$|Depending {{on where}} this species is {{geographical}} located determines {{whether or not}} it hibernates and for how long. In Israel, <b>forest</b> <b>dormice</b> stay active throughout the year. However, during the winter they do go through a period of torpor for {{a certain amount of time}} each day. <b>Forest</b> <b>dormice</b> located in the north tend to hibernate from October until April. During this period of hibernation, northern dormice will sit on their back legs and curl up into a ball. Its tail will wrap around its body and its hands may touch its cheeks. In all hibernating species, body temperature decreases from the range of 35-37 °C to about 5 °C.|$|R
50|$|There are 102 mammal {{species in}} Italy. Some {{of the species}} are Alpine Marmot, <b>forest</b> <b>dormouse,</b> Etruscan shrew (the {{smallest}} mammal in the world), European snow vole, and Schreiber's long-fingered bat. Notable large mammals are the Eurasian lynx, Italian wolf, Marsican brown bear, Pyrenean chamois, Alpine ibex, common genet, axis deer, mouflon, rough-toothed dolphin, crested porcupine and Mediterranean monk seal.|$|E
50|$|Adversely {{affecting}} 12 nationally listed threatened mammal species including the; {{wild goat}} (Capra aegagrus), chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra), Persian squirrel (Sciurus anomalus), <b>forest</b> <b>dormouse</b> (Dryomys nitedula), brown bear (Ursus arctos), Eurasian badger (Meles meles), gray wolf (Canis lupus), Mediterranean horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus euryale), lesser horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus hipposideros), greater mouse-eared bat (Myotis myotis), Schreibers’ bat (Miniopterus schreibersii) and pipistrelle bat (Pipistrellus pipistrellus). Of these species the Mediterranean bat and wild goat are internationally listed on IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.|$|E
5000|$|Natural tree hollows and artificially {{hollowed}} {{tree trunks}} were {{widely used in}} the past by beekeepers in Central Europe. For example, in Poland such a beehive was called a [...] "barć" [...] and was protected in various ways from unfavorable weather conditions (rain, frost) and predators (woodpeckers, bears, pine marten, <b>forest</b> <b>dormouse).</b> Harvest of honey from these did not destroy the colony, as only a protective piece of wood was removed from the opening and smoke was used to deter the bees for a short time.|$|E
50|$|This {{species is}} most likely to be found in dense <b>forests.</b> <b>Forest</b> <b>dormice</b> tend to create their natal nests on top of lower tree {{branches}} or in the midst of thick shrubbery. These nests are usually one to seven meters above ground level. They are spherically shaped with a diameter between 150mm to 250mm. Typically these nests only have one entrance and it faces the tree trunk. The outside of the nest is made from leaves and twigs. The inside of the nest has a lining that is created from bark and moss pieces. <b>Forest</b> <b>dormice</b> tend to pay great attention to detail when they create these natal nests. They want to make sure their young are protected.|$|R
50|$|<b>Forest</b> <b>dormice</b> spend a {{great amount}} of time in trees. They are capable of {{climbing}} with excellent agility as well as leap to and from branches as great as 2 meters apart from one another. This species has a natural tendency to create temporary nests which are fragile. This species does not spend much time in these temporary nests because much more energy is placed in making the natal nests.|$|R
50|$|This {{species is}} {{considered}} endangered in the Czech Republic and as rare in {{a majority of}} the other European countries. The population is mostly threatened by the destruction of forests which is their habitat. There are many programs in place to help maintain and increase the <b>forest</b> <b>dormice</b> population. There is an international law to protect this species and it is under the EU Habitats and Species Directive (Annex IV) and the Berne Convention (Appendix III). All countries must abide by this law. In addition, a country may choose to create a national law or program in order to further provide methods to make sure this species is protected. For example, the English government rewards farmers who replant hedges. Hopefully, this will increase available shrubbery for dormice to occupy. Another program is administered by English Nature. This is a reintroduction program whose purpose is to place captive-bred dormice in locations where the population has been dwindling. In addition to these programs, the UK has created a National Dormouse Monitoring Programme. Its main purpose is to observe hazel dormice. However, the program components are used to observe and track all species of dormice.|$|R
50|$|Its {{appearance}} is squirrel-like. On average, the <b>forest</b> <b>dormouse</b> is 110 mm long with a fluffy grey tail nearly {{as long as}} its body. The head and body length can range from 80 mm to 130 mm, while {{the length of the}} tail can range from 60 mm to 113 mm. The range of its body mass is between 18 grams and 34 grams. The fur on the upper parts of the body is grayish-brown while the underparts are yellowish-white. A black stripe surrounds the eye and extends to the small ear. The whiskers form a bushy tuft about 10mm long. There are six pads on each paw. It has bilateral symmetry and is endothermic.|$|E
50|$|Wildlife include almost 50 mammal species, with {{wolf and}} lynx at the top; less {{frequent}} brown bear, and lutra (rare European otter), {{as well as}} marten and badger often found digging under pasture fields. The Hazel and the <b>Forest</b> <b>dormouse</b> along with the Edible dormouse are all strictly protected. There are over 200 Red deer counted in the park area, as well as Roe deer and Wild boar, fox, wildcat, hare, skunk, and stoat (the ermine). Reptiles and amphibians include the fire salamander (Salamandra salamandra, the only amphibian (one of two Salamandridae) that give birth to fully formed offspring at high elevations; {{the symbol of the}} Park), as well as over ninety species of breeding birds including owl, eagle, hawk, grouse, black stork and others.|$|E
5000|$|In Vrachanski Balkan Nature Park {{there are}} around 1231 {{different}} invertebrates. It {{is an important}} region for butterflies in Bulgaria. The amphibians in the Nature Park are 11, and the 15 reptiles. Among them 20 are protected by law, all {{are included in the}} Bern Convention. From the over 180 birds species in the Nature Park, 157 are protected by law, and 38 are included in the [...] "Red book of Republic Bulgaria". There are 36 mammals species in the Nature Park, among which 9 are protected on national level, 20 - on European level and 9 on international level. Some of them are <b>forest</b> <b>dormouse,</b> southern white-breasted hedgehog, European badger, European otter, European polecat, wildcat, and roe deer. In the Nature Park live 22 of the 33 bat species, which live in Bulgaria.|$|E
50|$|Most {{vertebrates}} of {{the park}} are the typical representatives of the broadleaf and mixed forests in Europe (white stork, lesser spotted eagle, edible, <b>forest</b> and hazel <b>dormice,</b> wildcat). The proportion of species of Mediterranean origin is insignificant, common representatives are: fire salamander, European tree frog, Aesculapian snake, etc. There is also {{a small amount of}} typical mountain species (yellow-bellied toad, rock pipit, grey wagtail, etc.) and boreal species (western capercaillie, boreal owl, Ural owl, lynx, brown bear, etc.).|$|R
40|$|To {{describe}} {{the contribution of}} garden dormice to the epizootiology of Lyme disease, we compared their reservoir capacity for these pathogens {{to that of other}} sympatric hosts. Garden dormice are trapped most abundantly during early spring and again during midsummer, when their offspring forage. They are closely associated with moist <b>forests.</b> Garden <b>dormice</b> serve as hosts to nymphal ticks far more frequently than do other small mammals. Spirochetal infection is most prevalent in dormice, and many more larval ticks acquire infection in the course of feeding on these than on other rodents in the study site. Mature dormice appear to contribute more infections to the vector population than juveniles do. Replete larval ticks generally detach while their dormouse hosts remain within their nests. The population of garden dormice contributes five- to sevenfold more infections to the vector population than the mouse population does. Their competence, nymphal feeding density, and preference for a tick-permissive habitat combine to favor garden dormice over other putative reservoir hosts of Lyme disease spirochetes...|$|R
40|$|Etnolozi i istraživači europske prehrane najčešće izvode porijeklo jela iz antičko - rimskog nasljeđa. Puh je istarski specijalitet. Položaj Istre upućuje na dosljedan povijesni kontinuitet. Konzumirali su ga u rimsko vrijeme, postoji i patricijski recept u Apicijevoj kuharici iz I. stoljeća, no nemamo dokaza kontinuitetu lova ili konzumacije puha po dolasku Slavena u Istru. U prilog činjenici da je puh prirodna hrana poput mnogih sitnih sisavaca govori i to da je omiljen upravo najjednostavnije pripremljen - na ražnju. Starije generacije istarskih seljaka spašavao je od gladi. Nestankom bogatih šuma broj lovaca se smanjuje, prehrana postaje raznolikija a konzumacija puha dobiva regionalni, elitistički karakter. U suvremenom turističkom kontekstu, puh je sve sličniji rafiniranom rimskom predjelu. O mjestu puha u suvremenoj svakodnevici autorica doznaje analizirajući stav lovaca iz Kastva, kraj Rijeke. The author {{deals with}} the {{identification}} of the dormouse (myoxis glis) within the ethnographic picture of Istria (of the part of Kastav near Rijeka). In the Apici 2 ̆ 7 s cookbook from the first century a dormouse is stated as one of the Romans horse-d 2 ̆ 7 oeuvres (stuffed dormouse) but there is little evidence on the continuity of enjoyment in the meat of the dormouse in Croatian historical literature. Identification of mutual cultural borrowings is a demanding task, not very likely to succeed. However, considering that the Roman cuisine with its crockery, cutlery, hearth and refined taste had reached the peak which was later imitated and gained upon by the generations of cooks throughout Europe, we can assume that the consumption of dormouse survived in certain simpler variety whose links with the Romans can be neither confirmed nor denied. Still, scanty data indicate much broader area of enjoyment of dormouse meat in the past, while today we begin to consider it a regional or local specialty. If we look for legitimacy of the Roman dormouse in Istrian peasant menu, we 2 ̆ 7 ll find a strong hunting tradition and its patterns which weren 2 ̆ 7 t embodiments of antic lifestyle. Istrian dormouse is a male hunting speciality, like the other natural food from the nearby <b>forests</b> whereas the <b>dormouse</b> Roman way, according to Pierre Ricci 2 ̆ 7 s evaluation would have to be female food. In Istrian cuisine it is a popular, not a patrician meal. The stories of the hunters that the author values {{as the basis for the}} notion of dormouse as a meal, reiterate the fact that salted dormouse used to save people from hunger during winter times. That highly developed social enjoyment from the past (of catching, roasting and eating of dormouse) is nowadays maintained by some ten families in Kastav. Out of several hunting techniques, these days dormice are mostly caught by traps or air-gun and torch. Present day dormouse hunters (dormouse hunting being a special branch of hunting) take care of environment within the framework of the hunting club, they are interested in the advancement of hunting, go on joint excursions to neighbouring Slovenia where dormouse hunting is more advanced, and which is also embedded into present symbol of Notranjska region. It is to be expected that under Slovenian influence tourist dimension of this social fact would reinforce, and the dormouse would become a part of gastronomic offer of Kastav not only on Beta nedilja (first Sunday in October) when it is usually served in goulash for visitors of traditional Kastav fair. That breakthrough of limited regional taste will certainly remain exclusive because of the Croatian law on the protection of dormouse. The author also {{deals with the}} standard of taste in Kastav. Using the example of dormouse she wants to show that the idea of tastefulness varies not only in different cultures, but within the same cultural surrounding in common region. Besides, nutritional standards change. Consumption of ancient meals is a part of new movement towards strengthening of local identity, especially in communities that were spread out throughout the world. The motive for consumption of dormouse has essentially changed: it is no longer a roast meat for the poor or stock of proteins in meagre food provisions for winter...|$|R
50|$|The <b>forest</b> <b>dormouse</b> (Dryomys nitedula) is {{a species}} of rodent in the family Gliridae found in eastern Europe, the Balkans and parts of western Central Asia. It is {{categorized}} as being of least concern in the IUCN List of Threatened Species due to its wide range and stable population trend. Forest dormice have a diploid count (2n) of 48 chromosomes. Even though this species lives {{in a variety of}} geographic locations, its greatest population density is in the forests of central Moldova, in Transcaucasia, in the mountains of Central Asia. In most other locations, population density of this species is rather low. Population density is dependent on many factors. But the main features that this species depends on for choosing a location are the presence of the appropriate food sources as well as good foliage {{that can be used for}} a habitat. The reason why the forests in central Moldova have the highest population density is they provide the largest diversity of food sources which are available throughout the year. This location also provides the best type of foliage for the forest dormice to build their nests as well as swing from branches. The combination of both of these aspects allows for this species to have its highest needs met. Therefore, during mating season they produce offspring who also stay in the same general area when they mature. It makes sense not to move from an area if it is providing for your most basic needs.|$|E
30|$|In {{a similar}} manner to M. avellanarius, a {{well-developed}} and diverse understory was the main habitat component which determined nest site preference of the <b>forest</b> <b>dormouse</b> Dryomys nitedula (Juškaitis et al.|$|E
40|$|Variability of non-metric traits was studied on skulls of 75 {{individuals}} of the <b>Forest</b> <b>dormouse</b> (Dryomys nitedula PALLAS, 1779) from three populations {{located in the}} Mountain systems: Stara planina – Central Balkans, Vitosha Mountain and mountain territories in Southeastern Bulgaria and populations originating from hill forests in northeastern Bulgaria. The analysis of epigenetic variability of the four groups of D. nitedula, based on 12 epigenetic characters, revealed that it is similar in all the populations studied from the mountain systems varying from Vi = 0. 087 to Vi = 0. 06208. The epigenetic variability {{of the population of}} Forest dor-mouse from hill forests in Northeastern Bulgaria scores relatively higher than the average for the mountain populations of this species (Vi = 0. 10807). The occurrence frequency of the non-metric characters studied was used to determine the mean measure of inter-population divergence. The cranial epigenetic polymorphism found in the <b>Forest</b> <b>dormouse</b> of Bulgaria and its population differentiation reveal the lack of clearly distinct epigenetic population differentiation excepting the population inhabiting the moun-tain territories in Southeast Bulgaria, where the population expresses the micro-geographic epigenetic fragmentation of the <b>Forest</b> <b>dormouse</b> in Bulgaria...|$|E
40|$|The {{heavy metals}} load in the <b>forest</b> <b>dormouse</b> (Dryomys nitedula), inhabiting in forest shelter belts in the {{agricultural}} region was assessed. The concentrations of Cd, Co, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn (expressed in mg/kg of dry tissue) were established in the liver, using an atomic-absorption analysis. The fact that the highly toxic metals (Cd and Pb) were found in considerable concentrations together with other metals with concentration dependent toxic effect (Cu, Ni, Zn and Co) in the liver of forest dormice, {{suggests that it is}} necessary to carry out regular assessment and forecasting of accumulation of these metals in species, which are not direct targets of cultivation and control activities in agricultural ecosystems. The obtained values were used to create a baseline for estimation of heavy metal accumulation in the internal organs of the <b>forest</b> <b>dormouse,</b> both in anthropogenically transformed habitats and natural biotopes, as well as for using this species as a monitor of environmental status...|$|E

40|$|An {{overlap in}} {{attributes}} of nest cavities used by Great Tit Parus major across Eurasia suggests similar nest site preferences within the geographical range, although the drivers of these preferences are unclear. To determine whether preferred cavities provide conditions enhancing successful reproduction, we investigated the breeding performance of Great Tits {{in relation to}} tree cavity characteristics using data collected during 2008 – 2011 in primeval conditions (Białowieża National Park, Poland). Here, tree cavities are diverse and superabundant but nesting birds are at risk {{from a variety of}} predators. According to expectations, nest losses were high (60 % of Great Tit nests failed), mostly due to predation (69 % of nest failures). The risk of nest failure varied with nest cavity attributes. Compared to successful nests, failures were situated higher above the ground and placed closer to the cavity entrance. Very deep cavities with narrow entrances and strong livings walls provided effective protection against larger predators (e. g., martens, woodpeckers), unable to enter the cavity or pull out the contents. Yet, such holes were no barrier for the smallest predators (e. g., <b>Forest</b> <b>Dormouse</b> Dryomys nitedula), which were able to enter any Great Tit nest cavity and destroyed most of the nests. Avoiding small predators would give a selective advantage to the birds, but this seems hardly possible to achieve. We conclude that tree cavities preferred by the tits show a combination of properties which are a compromise for avoiding predation (the strongest selective pressure) and providing the minimum requirements (sufficient nest illumination, microclimate, protection against nest soaking) for development and growth of young...|$|E
