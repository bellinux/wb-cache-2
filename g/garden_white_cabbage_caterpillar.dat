50|$|Traditionally {{known in}} the United States as the {{imported}} cabbage worm, now more commonly the <b>cabbage</b> <b>white,</b> the <b>caterpillars</b> are bluish-green, with tiny black pints, a black ring around the spiracles, and a lateral row of yellow dashes, and a yellow middorsal line. Caterpillars rest on the undersides of the leaves, making them less visible to predators. Although the larval instars have not been fully studied, different instars are easily differentiated simply by comparing sizes, especially the head alone. During {{the first and second}} instar the head is entirely black; third instar has the clypeus yellow {{but the rest of the}} head black. In the fourth and fifth instar, there is a dark greenish-yellow dot behind each eye but with rest of the head black. However, the color of the caterpillar head does not necessarily indicate specific instar, as the time of color change is not fixed. In the larval stage, the small white can be a pest on cultivated cabbages, kale, radish, broccoli, and horseradish. The larva is considered a serious pest for commercial growth of cabbage and other Brassicaceae.|$|R
40|$|A six year {{field study}} was {{conducted}} from 2001 2002 to 2006 2007 at Punjab Agricultural University, Ludhiana, India to study the losses in seed yield of different Brassica species (B. juncea, B. napus, B. carinata, B. rapa and Eruca sativa) by the infestation of insect pests. The experiment was conducted in two different sets viz. protected/sprayed and unprotected, in a randomized block design, with three replications. Data on the infestation of insect pests, and seed yield were recorded at weekly intervals and at harvest, respectively. The loss in seed yield, due to mustard aphid and <b>cabbage</b> <b>caterpillar,</b> varied from 6. 5 to 26. 4 per cent. E. sativa suffered the least loss in seed yield and harboured the minimum population of mustard aphid (2. 1 aphids/plant) and <b>cabbage</b> <b>caterpillar</b> (2. 4 larvae/plant).

40|$|Insect herbivores by {{necessity}} {{have to deal}} with a large arsenal of plant defence metabolites. The levels of defence compounds may be increased by insect damage. These induced plant responses may also affect the metabolism and performance of successive insect herbivores. As the chemical nature of induced responses is largely unknown, global metabolomic analyses are a valuable tool to gain more insight into the metabolites possibly involved in such interactions. This study analyzed the interaction between feral cabbage (Brassica oleracea) and small <b>cabbage</b> <b>white</b> <b>caterpillars</b> (Pieris rapae) and how previous attacks to the plant affect the caterpillar metabolism. Because plants may be induced by shoot and root herbivory, we compared shoot and root induction by treating the plants on either plant part with jasmonic acid. Extracts of the plants and the caterpillars were chemically analysed using Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography/Time of Flight Mass Spectrometry (UPLCT/MS). The study revealed that the levels of three structurally related coumaroylquinic acids were elevated in plants treated on the shoot. The levels of these compounds in plants and caterpillars were highly correlated: these compounds were defined as the ‘metabolic interface’. The role of these metabolites could only be discovered using simultaneous analysis of the plant and caterpillar metabolomes. We conclude that a metabolomics approach is useful in discovering unexpected bioactive compounds involved in ecological interactions between plants and their herbivores and higher trophic level...|$|R

Additionally, the extent of antixenotic resistance during head formation and the level of thrips damage at harvest were also assessed and compared between varieties. A higher density of onion thrips was observed on susceptible than on resistant varieties. The results indicate that the epidermis is of the same thickness in susceptible <b>white</b> <b>cabbage</b> varieties as in resistant ones; therefore, we conclude that the thicknesses of either the adaxial or the abaxial part of the epidermis of head-forming leaves is not responsible for cabbage resistance to thrips.

(Lepidoptera: Pieridae), and the parasitoid wasp, Cotesia glomerata (L.) (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), the influence of plant damage type, and damage duration were assessed on plant volatile emission and subsequent recruitment of natural antagonists of the herbivore. Plants were damaged by three methods {{for a period of}} either 3 or 8 h: herbivore damage (HD), progressive mechanical damage, and final mechanical damage inflicted in a single event. Wind-tunnel bioassays evaluated whether the mode of damage affected female parasitoid oriented flight. After both periods of damage, all treatments were highly significantly preferred by naïve C. glomerata to undamaged control plants. After 3 h, herbivore-damaged plants were significantly preferred to plants with final damage (FD). Most remarkably, following 8 -h damage, the parasitoid preferred both herbivore-damaged and progressively damaged plants to plants with FD and did not significantly discriminate between herbivore and progressively damaged plants, thus indicating a similarity in plant response to herbivore and progressive mechanical damage. In addition to wind-tunnel bioassays, emitted plant volatiles were collected and analysed by thermal desorption gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, following 3 and 8 h of damage in order to correlate volatiles released from different damage types with the attraction of the parasitoid. Differences in volatile profiles from all damage types were similar following both 3 and 8 h of damage, with only (Z) - 3 -hexenyl acetate found to be emitted in significantly higher quantities by final mechanical damage compared with HD after 3 h. In conclusion, the plant's response to progressive mechanical damage was more similar to HD than final mechanical damage deployed at a single point in time, irrespective of damage duration, and C. glomerata did not significantly discriminate between progressive damage and HD...|$|R

Pollution from automobile exhaust, industrial and commercialactivities may affect humans, crops, soil, and water in and around urban agriculture areas. The research aimed to investigate the level and distribution of lead (Pb) and cadmium (Cd) in <b>white</b> <b>cabbage</b> (Brassica rapa L.), soil, and irrigation water taken from urban sites. The research was conducted in Las Piñas and Parañaque, Metro Manila, Philippines. The field area was divided into three sections based on its distance from the main road (0, 25, and 50 m). Irrigation water was taken from canal (Las Piñas) and river (Parañaque). Pb and Cd contents of the extract were measured by Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry. Combined analysis over locations was used. The relationship between distance from the main road and metal contents was measured by Pearson 2 ̆ 7 s correlation. Based on combined analyses, highly significant difference over locations was only showed on Cd content in <b>white</b> <b>cabbage.</b> Cd content in <b>white</b> <b>cabbage</b> grown in Parañaque was higher than that cultivated in Las Piñas, while Cd content in the soil between both sites was comparable. The average Pb content (1. 09 µg g- 1 dry weight) was highest in the <b>white</b> <b>cabbage</b> grown right beside the main road. A similar trend was also observed in the soil, with the highest concentration being recorded at 26 µg g- 1 dry weight.

Understanding how such interactions shape density distributions of herbivores requires knowledge on how variation in plant traits (e. g. nutritional quality) affects herbivore abundance through, for example, affecting movement rates and aggregation behaviour. We studied {{the effects of}} plant patch size and herbivore-induced differences in plant nutritional quality on local densities of insect herbivores for two Brassica oleracea cultivars, i. e. <b>white</b> <b>cabbage</b> and Brussels sprouts. Early season herbivory as a treatment resulted in measurable differences in glucosinolate concentrations in both cultivars throughout the season. Herbivore induction and patch size both influenced community composition of herbivores in both cultivars, but the effects differed between species. Flea beetles (Phyllotreta spp.) were more abundant in large than in small patches, and this patch response was more pronounced on <b>white</b> <b>cabbage</b> than on Brussels sprouts. Herbivore-induction increased densities in all patches. Thrips tabaci was also more abundant in large patches and densities of this species were higher on Brussels sprouts than on <b>white</b> <b>cabbage.</b> Thrips densities were lower on induced than on control plants of both cultivars and this negative effect of induction {{tended to be more}} pronounced in large than in small patches. Densities of the cabbage moth (Mamestra brassicae) were lower on Brussels sprouts than on <b>white</b> <b>cabbage</b> and lower on herbivore-induced than on uninduced plants, with no effect of patch size. No clear effects of patch size and induction were found for aphids.
