5|$|The May Revolution {{began the}} Argentine War of Independence, {{although}} no <b>formal</b> <b>declaration</b> of independence was issued {{at the time}} and the Primera Junta continued to govern {{in the name of the}} deposed king, FerdinandVII. As similar events occurred in many other cities of the continent, the May Revolution is also considered one of the early events of the Spanish American wars of independence. Historians today debate whether the revolutionaries were truly loyal to the Spanish crown or whether the declaration of fidelity to the king was a necessary ruse to conceal the true objective—to achieve independence—from a population that was not yet ready to accept such a radical change. A <b>formal</b> <b>declaration</b> of independence was finally issued at the Congress of Tucumán on July9, 1816.|$|E
5|$|The Ottoman press {{reported}} {{the action on}} 31 October, claiming that the Russians had planned on mining the Bosphorus and destroying their fleet without a <b>formal</b> <b>declaration</b> of war, compelling the Ottoman navy to retaliate after an engagement at sea by bombarding the Russian coast.|$|E

5|$|In 1054, {{relations}} between the Eastern and Western traditions within the Christian Church reached a terminal crisis, known as the East–West Schism. Although there was a <b>formal</b> <b>declaration</b> of institutional separation, on July 16, when three papal legates entered the Hagia Sophia during Divine Liturgy on a Saturday afternoon and placed a bull of excommunication on the altar, the so-called Great Schism was actually the culmination of centuries of gradual separation. Unfortunately the legates {{did not know that}} the Pope had died, an event that made the excommunication void and the excommunication only applied to the Patriarch who responded by excommunicating the legates.|$|E
5|$|On 10 May 1940, German forces invaded neutral Belgium {{without a}} <b>formal</b> <b>declaration</b> of war. Leopold headed {{immediately}} to Fort Breendonk, {{the headquarters of}} the Belgian army near Mechelen, {{to take control of the}} army. He refused to address the Belgian parliament beforehand, as Albert I had famously done at the outbreak of World War I. The speed of the German advance, using the new Blitzkrieg approach, soon pushed the Belgian army westwards despite British and French support. On 16 May, the Belgian government left Brussels.|$|E
5|$|On 12 April 1779 Spain {{signed the}} Treaty of Aranjuez with France, setting terms for a joint {{military}} alliance against Britain. Despite the Treaty Spain delayed the <b>formal</b> <b>declaration</b> of war until June, to give time for better co-ordination of its battle fleet. In the interim Levant engaged and defeated a Spanish privateer whose crew {{were caught in}} the act of boarding a British merchant ship. A brief exchange of cannon fire holed the Spanish vessel below the waterline, sinking her; Levant rescued the majority of her crew and transported them to prison in Gibraltar.|$|E

5|$|On 3 November 1914, Churchill {{ordered the}} first British {{attack on the}} Dardanelles {{following}} the opening of hostilities between Turkey and Russia. The attack {{was carried out by}} Indomitable and Indefatigable, as well as the French pre-dreadnought battleships Suffren and Vérité. The intention of the attack was to test the fortifications and measure the Turkish response. The results were deceptively encouraging. In a twenty-minute bombardment, a single shell struck the magazine of the fort at Sedd el Bahr {{at the tip of the}} Gallipoli peninsula, displacing (but not destroying) 10 guns and killing 86 Turkish soldiers. The most significant consequence was that the attention of the Turks was drawn to strengthening their defences, and they set about expanding the mine field. This attack actually took place before a <b>formal</b> <b>declaration</b> of war had been made by Britain against the Ottoman Empire which didn't happen until the 5th. Indomitable was ordered to return to England in December where she joined the 2nd BCS.|$|E
5|$|The Song court {{returned}} to Hangzhou in 1133, {{and the city}} was renamed Lin'an. The imperial ancestral temple was built in Hangzhou later that same year, {{a sign that the}} court had in practice established Hangzhou as the Song capital without a <b>formal</b> <b>declaration.</b> It was treated as a temporary capital. Between 1130 and 1137, the court would sporadically move to Jiankang, and back to Hangzhou. There were proposals to make Jiankang the new capital, but Hangzhou won out because the court considered it a more secure city. The natural barriers that surrounded Hangzhou, including lakes and rice paddies, made it more difficult for the Jurchen cavalry to breach its fortifications. Access to the sea made it easier to retreat from the city. In 1138, Gaozong officially declared Hangzhou the capital of the dynasty, but the label of temporary capital would still be in place. Hangzhou would remain the capital of the Southern Song for the next 150 years, growing into a major commercial and cultural center.|$|E
5|$|In early November 1975, the South African {{government}} warned Savimbi and Roberto {{that the}} South African Defence Force (SADF) would soon end operations in Angola despite {{the failure of}} the coalition to capture Luanda and therefore secure international recognition for their government. Savimbi, desperate to avoid the withdrawal of South Africa, asked General Constand Viljoen to arrange a meeting for him with Prime Minister of South Africa John Vorster, who had been Savimbi's ally since October 1974. On the night of 10 November, the day before the <b>formal</b> <b>declaration</b> of independence, Savimbi secretly flew to Pretoria to meet Vorster. In a reversal of policy, Vorster not only agreed to keep his troops in Angola through November, but also promised to withdraw the SADF only after the OAU meeting on 9 December. The Soviets, well aware of South African activity in southern Angola, flew Cuban soldiers into Luanda the week before independence. While Cuban officers led the mission and provided the bulk of the troop force, 60 Soviet officers in the Congo joined the Cubans on 12 November. The Soviet leadership expressly forbade the Cubans from intervening in Angola's civil war, focusing the mission on containing South Africa.|$|E

The British harassed French shipping throughout 1755, seizing ships and capturing seamen. These actions {{contributed to the}} eventual <b>formal</b> <b>declarations</b> of war in spring 1756.|$|R

Still, they would be quite helpful when courts assess earlier actions when determining imprecise childcare parentage issues...|$|R
25|$|In 1939, 17 {{days after}} the German invasion, the Soviet Union also invaded Poland. There was no <b>formal</b> <b>declaration</b> of war by either side.

25|$|When {{they saw}} the British waving a white flag, the Kentucky riflemen thought it meant a call for a truce.

5000|$|Since World War II, <b>formal</b> <b>declarations</b> of {{war have}} been rare, {{especially}} actions conducted by developed nations {{in connection with}} the Cold War.

50|$|While {{traditional}} safeguards easily verified the correctness of <b>formal</b> <b>declarations</b> by suspect states, in the 1990s attention {{turned to}} what {{might not have been}} declared. While accepting safeguards at declared facilities, Iraq had set up elaborate equipment elsewhere in an attempt to enrich uranium to weapons grade. North Korea attempted to use research reactors (not commercial electricity-generating reactors) and a reprocessing plant to produce some weapons-grade plutonium.|$|R

25|$|For {{committing}} this crime, the Nuremberg Tribunal sentenced {{a number}} of persons responsible for starting World War II. One consequence {{of this is that}} nations who are starting an armed conflict must now argue that they are either exercising the right of self-defense, the right of collective defense, or - it seems - the enforcement of the criminal law of jus cogens. It has made <b>formal</b> <b>declaration</b> of war uncommon after 1945.|$|E
