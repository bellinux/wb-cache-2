The bout saw <b>Fitch</b> continually taking down Gono and landing with ground-and-pound punches on the downed opponent. <b>Fitch</b> came close to submitting Gono {{in the first and}} second rounds when he went for a rear naked choke and an armbar respectively, but he was unable to finish the Japanese fighter. All three judges scored the bout in favor of <b>Fitch,</b> two scoring it 30–27 with one judge seeing it 30–26 giving <b>Fitch</b> the unanimous decision victory.|$|E
5|$|Haynes asked <b>Fitch</b> {{to observe}} the ailerons through the {{passenger}} cabin windows to see if control inputs were having any effect. <b>Fitch</b> reported back that the ailerons were not moving at all. Nonetheless, the crew continued to manipulate their control columns {{for the remainder of}} the flight, hoping for at least some effect. Haynes then asked <b>Fitch</b> to take over control of the throttles so that Haynes could concentrate on his control column. With one throttle in each hand, <b>Fitch</b> was able to mitigate the phugoid cycle and make rough steering adjustments.|$|E

5|$|<b>Fitch</b> {{attended}} Chadron State College {{for three}} years, {{then transferred to}} Northwestern University; but this was during World War II, and his studies were interrupted by being drafted into the U.S. Army in 1943. After he had completed basic training, the Army sent him to Carnegie Institute of Technology for training under the Army Specialized Training Program. Under this program, some 200,000 soldiers attended colleges for intensive courses. <b>Fitch</b> was in the program {{for less than a}} year before the manpower requirements of the war became too great, and the Army terminated the program. Most of the soldiers in the ASTP were posted to combat units, but <b>Fitch</b> was one of a hundred or so ASTP soldiers who joined the Special Engineer Detachment (SED), which provided much-needed technicians to the Manhattan Project.|$|E

5|$|His wartime {{experiences}} led <b>Fitch</b> {{to decide}} to become a physicist. Robert Bacher, {{the head of the}} physics division at Los Alamos, offered him a graduate assistantship at Cornell University, but first he needed to complete his undergraduate degree. Rather than return to Northwestern or Carnegie Mellon, he elected to enter McGill University, which Titterton had recommended. <b>Fitch</b> graduated from McGill with a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering in 1948. On the advice of Jerry Kellogg, who had been a student of Rabi's at Columbia University, and was a division head at the Los Alamos, <b>Fitch</b> decided to pursue his doctoral studies at Columbia. Kellogg wrote him a letter of introduction to Rabi. James Rainwater became his academic supervisor. Rainwater gave him a paper by John Wheeler concerning mu-mesic atoms, atoms in which an electron is replaced by a muon. These had never been observed; they were completely theoretical and {{there was no evidence that}} they existed, but it made a good thesis topic.|$|E
