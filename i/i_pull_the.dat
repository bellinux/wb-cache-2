"You and I {{should not}} now {{pull on the}} ends of the rope in which you have tied a knot of war, because the harder you and <b>I</b> <b>pull,</b> <b>the</b> tighter the knot will become. And a time may come when this knot is tied so tight that the person who tied it is no longer capable of untying it, and then the knot will have to be cut. What that would mean I need not explain to you, because you {{yourself}} understand perfectly what dreaded forces our two countries possess." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1970 she {{proposed}} a similar idea {{to the same}} gallery that was also refused. The piece was untitled. Abramović would {{stand in front of}} the public dressed in her regular clothing. Present on the side of the stage was a clothes rack adorned with clothing that her mother wanted her to wear. She would take the clothing one by one and change into them, then stand to face the public for a while. [...] "From the right pocket of my skirt I take a gun. From the left pocket of my skirt I take a bullet. I put the bullet into the chamber and turn it. I place the gun to my temple. <b>I</b> <b>pull</b> <b>the</b> trigger." [...] The performance had two possible outcomes.|$|E
60|$|Philip Beaufoy I was thinking. Playgoers' Club. Matcham often {{thinks of}} the masterstroke. Did <b>I</b> <b>pull</b> <b>the</b> chain? Yes. The last act.|$|E

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>pull</b> <b>the</b> wheezy bell {{of their}} {{shuttered}} cottage: and wait. They {{take me for}} a dun, peer out from a coign of vantage.|$|E
6000|$|... "Keep off," [...] she cried, [...] "you can't lead them! They don't want {{to cross}} the track, but they've got to if <b>I</b> <b>pull</b> <b>the</b> jaws off them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Upon my honour, 't was no {{more than}} that. <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> cloth from the table whilst he ate. He was a quick-tempered gentleman, and my playfulness {{offended}} him. That is all." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "It {{came down}} to, I shoot him {{or he was}} going to shoot me — so <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> trigger," [...] Valdez said in the book. [...] "Lucky for both of us, he didn't die." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{lifted my}} rifle; I {{scrutinized}} its every portion; {{it was in}} order. Then I leaned {{over the edge of}} the car and pointed it downward. I aimed it between his great, earnest eyes, into the very middle of his thoughtful and observant countenance. <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> trigger; the explosion shook the car.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Desire!' said Gudrun, coldly, {{stiffening}} a little. 'I can't {{see that}} they were even playing at killing. I suppose one boy said to the other, [...] "You look down the barrel while <b>I</b> <b>pull</b> <b>the</b> trigger, and see what happens." [...] It seems to me the purest form of accident.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... “It’s {{likely you}} know {{the laws of the}} woods better than I do, Billy Kirby,” {{returned}} Natty. “You come in with the settlers, with an ox- goad in your hand, and I come in with moccasins on my feet, and with a good rifle on my shoulders, so long back as afore the old war. Which is likely to know the best? I say no man need tell me that snapping is as good as firing when <b>I</b> <b>pull</b> <b>the</b> trigger.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "To me it {{does not}} seem that I am a {{creature}} so terrific, that thou need'st dread my presence," [...] continued the gay mariner, with a smile that expressed as much of secret irony, as of that pensive character which had again taken possession of his countenance; [...] "but ring, and bring your attendants to relieve fears that are natural to thy sex, and therefore seducing to mine. Shall <b>I</b> <b>pull</b> <b>the</b> cord?--for this pretty hand trembles too much, to do its office." ...|$|E
60|$|To wait, {{listening}} again, in {{the darkness}} of that unknown region, was more than I had courage for. The moment I was down on <b>the</b> floor, <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> lantern out of my pocket and raised the shade.|$|R
60|$|With a gasp <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> {{handkerchief}} {{aside and}} sat up. Beside me sat Mr. Allen Price with my handbag on his lap. He {{had a number}} of keys in his hand and was trying to unlock the bag.|$|R
6000|$|... "I shot twice," [...] said Jimmy, {{in a quiet}} voice. [...] "I don't think Bob used a gun. All <b>the</b> same, when <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> trigger <b>I</b> {{imagined}} I {{heard another}} report; but perhaps it was my rifle. I really don't know." ...|$|R
6000|$|Another time in {{warm weather}} out in a boat, to lift the lobster-pots [...] where they are sunk with heavy stones, (I know the buoys,) [...] O the {{sweetness}} of the Fifth-month morning upon the water as I row [...] just before sunrise toward the buoys, [...] <b>I</b> <b>pull</b> <b>the</b> wicker pots up slantingly, the dark green lobsters are [...] desperate with their claws as I take them out, I insert [...] wooden pegs in the 'oints of their pincers, ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then," [...] {{answered}} the Abbot, dropping his fist upon the table, [...] "then death {{for both of}} you--the witch's death, for I dare not let you go to work my ruin. Remember, I am master here, you are my prisoners. Few know that you live in this place, except a handful of weak-brained women who will fear to speak--puppets that must dance when <b>I</b> <b>pull</b> <b>the</b> string--and I'll see that no soul shall come near these walls. Choose, then, between death and all its terrors or life and all its hopes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You {{are great}} useless creatures,' said he, 'who couldn't even outwit that little dwarf. When we have {{finished}} supper I {{will show you}} what I have done with him!' But {{when they reached the}} place where Paul had left the dwarf, neither he nor the tree was to be seen, for the little fellow had pulled it up by the roots and run away, dragging it after him. The four friends followed the track of the tree and found that it ended in a deep hole. 'He must have gone down here,' said Paul, 'and I will go after him. See! there is a basket that will do for me to sit in, and a cord to lower me with. But when <b>I</b> <b>pull</b> <b>the</b> cord again, lose no time in drawing the basket up.' ...|$|E
60|$|Without a {{word the}} lantern was raised until the light glittered on the barrels. Then I saw nothing {{whatever}} except the gun! In sheer desperation <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> trigger. The tremendous {{appearance in the}} dark of the sheet of flame that belched forth, and the crash of the report in the silent night, gave me quite new ideas as to firearms.|$|R
5000|$|Morgan {{joked that}} his most {{frightening}} moment came [...] "when <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> next-to-last {{bottle of beer}} from the bilge." [...] But his journey brought real dangers, including a tropical storm in the South Pacific that battered the boat with 70-mile-per-hour winds for three days.|$|R
60|$|I {{went into}} my room and drew the curtains, {{but there was little}} to notice. My window opened into the courtyard, all I could see was the warm grey of {{quickening}} sky. So <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> curtains again, and have written of this day.|$|R
6000|$|He.--No doubt, {{gold and}} gold; gold is everything, {{and all the}} [...] rest without gold is nothing. So instead of cramming his head with [...] fine maxims which {{he would have to}} forget, on pain of {{remaining}} a [...] beggar all the days of his life, what I do is this: when I have a [...] louis, which does not happen to me often, I plant myself in front [...] of him, <b>I</b> <b>pull</b> <b>the</b> louis out of my pocket, I show it to him with [...] signs of admiration, I raise my eyes to heaven, I kiss the louis [...] before him, and to make him understand still better the importance [...] of the sacred coin, I point to him with my finger all that he can [...] get with it, a fine frock, a pretty cap, a rich cake; then I thrust [...] the louis into my pocket, I walk proudly up and down, I raise the [...] lappet of my waistcoat, I strike my fob; and in that way I make him [...] see that it is the louis in it that gives me all this assurance.|$|E
6000|$|... "Charles the Simple--Charles the Simple!--what will posterity {{call the}} Eleventh Louis, whose blood will {{probably}} soon refresh the stains of thine! Louis the Fool--Louis the Driveller--Louis the Infatuated--are all terms too slight {{to mark the}} extremity of my idiocy! To think these hot headed Liegeois, to whom rebellion is as natural as their food, would remain quiet--to dream that the Wild Beast of Ardennes would for a moment be interrupted in his career of force and bloodthirsty brutality--to suppose that I could use reason and arguments to any good purpose with Charles of Burgundy, until I had tried the force of such exhortations with success upon a wild bull. Fool, and double idiot that I was! But the villain Martius shall not escape.--He {{has been at the}} bottom of this, he and the vile priest, the detestable Balue. If I ever get out of this danger, I will tear from his head the Cardinal's cap, though <b>I</b> <b>pull</b> <b>the</b> scalp along with it! But the other traitor is in my hands--I am yet King enough--have yet an empire roomy enough--for the punishment of the quack salving, word mongering, star gazing, lie coining impostor, who has at once made a prisoner and a dupe of me!--The conjunction of the constellations--ay, the conjunction.--He must talk nonsense which would scarce gull a thrice sodden sheep's head, and I must be idiot enough to think I understand him! But we shall see presently what the conjunction hath really boded. But first let me to my devotions." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Say, {{ladies and}} gentlemen," [...] he proceeded, [...] "that my patient {{has just come}} in. His mind is one mass of nervous fancies and caprices, which his friends (with the best {{possible}} intentions) have been ignorantly irritating at home. They have been afraid of him, for instance, at night. They have forced him to have somebody {{to sleep in the}} room with him, or they have forbidden him, in case of accidents, to lock his door. He comes to me the first night, and says: 'Mind, I won't have anybody in my room!'--'Certainly not!'--'I insist on locking my door.'--'By all means!' In he goes, and locks his door; and there he is, soothed and quieted, predisposed to confidence, predisposed to sleep, by having his own way. 'This is all very well,' you may say; 'but suppose something happens, suppose he has a fit in the night, what then?' You shall see! Hallo, my young friend!" [...] cried the doctor, suddenly addressing the sleepy little boy. [...] "Let's have a game. You shall be the poor sick man, and I'll be the good doctor. Go into that room and lock the door. There's a brave boy! Have you locked it? Very good! Do you think I can't get at you if I like? I wait till you're asleep--I press this little white button, hidden here in the stencilled pattern of the outer wall--the mortise of the lock inside falls back silently against the door-post--and I walk into the room whenever I like. The same plan is pursued with the window. My capricious patient won't open it at night, when he ought. I humor him again. 'Shut it, dear sir, by all means!' As soon as he is asleep, <b>I</b> <b>pull</b> <b>the</b> black handle hidden here, {{in the corner of the}} wall. The window of the room inside noiselessly opens, as you see. Say the patient's caprice is the other way--he persists in opening the window when he ought to shut it. Let him! by all means, let him! I pull a second handle when he is snug in his bed, and the window noiselessly closes in a moment. Nothing to irritate him, ladies and gentlemen--absolutely nothing to irritate him! But I haven't done with him yet. Epidemic disease, in spite of all my precautions, may enter this Sanitarium, and may render the purifying of the sick-room necessary. Or the patient's case may be complicated by other than nervous malady--say, for instance, asthmatic difficulty of breathing. In the one case, fumigation is necessary; in the other, additional oxygen in the air will give relief. The epidemic nervous patient says, 'I won't be smoked under my own nose!' The asthmatic nervous patient gasps with terror at the idea of a chemical explosion in his room. I noiselessly fumigate one of them; I noiselessly oxygenize the other, by means of a simple Apparatus fixed outside in the corner here. It is protected by this wooden casing; it is locked with my own key; and it communicates by means of a tube with the interior of the room. Look at it!" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Next {{morning after}} breakfast--and {{it was a}} breakfast--I strolled out to the barn and, the carriage-shed door being open, <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> old buggy out--'peared {{like it was the}} very same one, and I was a-dustin' the {{cushions}} and fussin' around when the old man came up.|$|R
5000|$|... "Beneath {{a mask of}} selfish tranquility nothing exists except {{bitterness}} and boredom.
