5|$|The {{child in}} the man's arms was wearing light-coloured pink pyjamas with a floral pattern and cuffs on the legs, similar to Madeleine's. Tanner {{described}} the man as white, dark-haired, 5ft 7 in (1.70 m) tall, of southern European or Mediterranean appearance, 35–40 years old, wearing gold or beige trousers and a dark jacket, and said he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> a tourist. Tanner told the Portuguese police, {{but they did not}} pass the description to the media until 25 May. Madeleine's Fund hired a forensic artist to create an image of the man (left), which was released in October 2007.|$|E
5|$|The Smiths {{saw the man}} {{at around}} 22:00 on Rua da Escola Primária, 500 yards (457 m) from the McCanns' apartment, {{walking away from the}} Ocean Club and toward Rua 25 de Abril and the beach. He was {{carrying}} a girl aged 3–4 years. She had blonde hair and pale skin, was wearing light-coloured pyjamas, and had bare feet. The man was mid-30s, 5ft 7in–5ft 9in (1.75–1.80 m), slim-to-normal build, with short brown hair, wearing cream or beige trousers. He <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> a tourist, according to the Smiths, and had seemed uncomfortable carrying the child. E-fits based on the Smiths testimony were first created in 2008 by Oakley International, private investigators hired by the McCanns, and were publicized in 2013 by Scotland Yard on Crimewatch.|$|E
5|$|Writer Howard Gordon was {{inspired}} to write the episode after reading two articles involving suicides of servicemen in Haiti. The refugee plot was used due to the producers being unable to film in Haiti. Colonel Wharton was portrayed by Daniel Benzali, who later went on to star in the ABC series Murder One. While the producers agreed that he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> a military man, they felt he had the quality {{they were looking for}} in the role. For the sequence where a man emerges from Scully's hand and strangles her, a male actor pushed his gelatine covered fingers through a mechanical hand. The episode started production in late December 1994, and after a Christmas break was completed in January 1995. The Haitian refugee camp was shot in a derelict building in a North Vancouver shipyard. Sump pumps had to be used on the graveyard of the episode's ending as it was shot during a particularly rainy January.|$|E

25|$|Round 5 was the Spanish Grand Prix and Montoya {{needed a}} good result but <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> getting it, so, after another poor qualifying, Montoya found himself down in 12th place. He {{made up for}} it by making a quick start by gaining five places and was up to sixth in the first corner (David Coulthard was {{starting}} {{from the back of}} the grid after stalling on the formation lap). He got ahead of Jacques Villeneuve in the second round of pit stops. He stayed on the track and climbed up to second due to a high attrition rate.|$|E
25|$|The two McLaren {{drivers were}} the first two drivers out on the track for the initial fuel burning phase, and initially, Alonso was the fastest on the track. After {{the first set of}} pit stops it looked like Alonso was going to take the pole. On the last set of laps, Alonso was on a faster time than he was before, but Räikkönen was on a faster. Both of them {{completed}} their laps and Räikkönen came out on top, despite an error coming out of the final corner. Hamilton who had been sitting in fourth <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> he was very competitive during qualifying. In the last few seconds of the session he set the fastest lap and put himself on pole position, and {{he was the only one}} to break into the 1 minute 19 second margin.|$|E

25|$|Sullivan {{recalled}} {{that he had}} always been fascinated by the unlicensed traders who sold goods from suitcases in markets, and he based Del Boy on them. David Jason added other elements to the part, including Del's cheap gold jewellery and his camel-hair coat. The inspiration was taken from a similar man he had known when working as an electrician. Jason was a relatively late candidate for the part: Jim Broadbent (who would later appear in a minor recurring role as DCI Roy Slater) and Enn Reitel were earlier preferences. Broadbent turned down the role, due to the play he was acting in had moved. It was only when producer Ray Butt saw a repeat of Open All Hours that Jason was considered and, despite concerns that Jason had not previously had a leading television role, and that he and Lyndhurst <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> brothers, he was cast.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, Dr Xun Zhou, a {{research}} fellow at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London, published doubts regarding the authenticity of the Kaifeng community. Zhou asserts that the apparent presence of the Jews was largely a Western cultural construct, which grew following the publication by James Finn of The Jews in China (1840) and The Orphan Colony of Jews in China (1874) whose initial research was based upon the accounts of the 17th century Jesuit missionaries. She maintains that the community had no Torah scrolls until 1851, when they suddenly appeared to be sold to eager Western collectors. She also states that drawings of the synagogue were doctored in the West because the original <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> one, and that the Kaifeng community claimed to have kept some Jewish practices since before they are known to have begun. Xun Zhou's conclusion is that the Kaifeng community was not Jewish in any meaningful sense.|$|E
500|$|The scenes {{featuring}} boar {{were originally}} {{planned to use}} actual, domesticated animals. Since bringing domesticated boar from continental United States was expensive, and the animals available in Hawaii <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> wild boar and rarely moved (the script required them to run in most scenes), the producers decided to use computer-generated boar instead, along with reaction shots from the actors and first-person sequences from the animals' point of view.|$|E

500|$|Bowie {{stated that}} he was looking for dancers who <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> typical MTV dancers and who knew both American street-dancing and European {{performance}} art. Originally Bowie had hoped to have Édouard Lock of La La La Human Steps be involved in the show, but the group was booked with other commitments. Bowie later lamented that the Tour may have been viewed differently if La La La Human Steps had been involved: [...] "It would have been a different ballgame." [...] La La La Human Steps would provide the choreography for Bowie's next tour, the Sound+Vision Tour of 1990.|$|E
500|$|Alcibiades has {{not been}} spared by ancient comedy and stories attest to an epic {{confrontation}} between Alcibiades and Eupolis resembling that between Aristophanes and Cleon. He also appears as a character in several Socratic dialogues (Symposium, Protagoras, Alcibiades I and II, {{as well as the}} eponymous dialogues by Aeschines Socraticus and Antisthenes). Purportedly based on his own personal experience, Antisthenes described Alcibiades's extraordinary physical strength, courage, and beauty, saying, [...] "If Achilles <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> this, he was not really handsome." [...] In his trial, Socrates must rebut the attempt to hold him guilty for the crimes of his former students, including Alcibiades. Hence, he declares in Apology: [...] "I have never been anyone's teacher".|$|E
500|$|Waters {{accepted}} his invitation to be a guest star instantly, stating {{that if it}} was good enough for the actress Elizabeth Taylor, who appeared in the season four episodes [...] "Lisa's First Word" [...] and [...] "Krusty Gets Kancelled", it was good enough for him. He joked, however, about a negative reaction if his character would be made to look like fitness personality Richard Simmons. John's design was based largely on Waters' own appearance; for animation reasons, Waters moustache was changed from straight to curvy, so that it <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> a mistake. As thanks for his performance, the show's staff sent Waters an animation cel from the episode, which he now has hanging in his office.|$|E

500|$|The {{video was}} shot over four days, {{with an extra}} day allotted for re-shooting some of the scenes. Originally Lambert had casts taken of Robinson's face, hand and feet to create the statue of the saint which would {{be used as a}} decoration. The actor only enacted the live scenes. However during post-production, Lambert found that the statue <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> Robinson, who was asked to re-shoot the {{respective}} scenes. He had to act as the statue and required special make-up for the retakes. The actor recalled that standing like a statue was difficult since [...] "first of all, I didn't realize how hard it is on the back to stand absolutely tall and straight and not move. Secondly, as a performer you have this nervous energy—and my requirements here were total antithesis of that." ...|$|E
500|$|On 28 January 1943 Purchase {{contacted}} Montagu {{with the}} news he had located a suitable body, probably that of Glyndwr Michael, a tramp who died from eating rat poison that contained phosphorus. Purchase informed Montagu and Cholmondeley that {{the small amount of}} poison in the system would not be identified in a body that {{was supposed to have been}} floating in the sea for several days. When Montagu commented that the under-nourished corpse <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> a fit field officer, Purchase informed him that [...] "he does not have to look like an officer – only a staff officer", more used to office work. Purchase agreed to keep the body in the mortuary refrigerator at a temperature of [...] – any colder and the flesh would freeze, which would be obvious after the body defrosted. He warned Montagu and Cholmondeley that the body had to be used within the following three months, after which it would have decomposed past the point of usefulness.|$|E
500|$|In 1995, a {{research}} {{team led by}} David Burney and Ramilisonina performed interviews in and around Belo sur Mer, including Ambararata and Antsira, to find subfossil megafaunal sites used early in the century by other paleontologists. [...] During carefully controlled interviews, the team recorded stories of recent sightings of dwarf hippos (called kilopilopitsofy) and of a large lemur-like creature known as kidoky; {{a report of the}} interviews was published in 1998 with encouragement from primatologist Alison Jolly and anthropologist Laurie Godfrey. [...] In one interview, an 85-year-old man named Jean Noelson Pascou recounted seeing the rare kidoky up close in 1952. [...] Pascou said that the animal looks similar to a sifaka, but had a human-like face, and was [...] "the size of a seven-year-old girl". It had dark fur and a discernible white spot both on the forehead and below the mouth. [...] According to Pascou, it was a shy animal that fled on the ground instead of in the trees. [...] Burney interpreted the old man as saying that it moved in [...] "a series of leaps", but Godfrey later claimed that [...] "a series of bounds" [...] was a better translation — a description that would closely match the foot anatomy of monkey lemurs, such as Hadropithecus and Archaeolemur. [...] Pascou could also imitate its call, a long single [...] "whoop", and said that kidoky would come closer and continue calling if he imitated the call correctly. [...] The call Pascou imitated was comparable to that of a short call for an indri, which lives {{on the other side of}} Madagascar. [...] When shown a picture of an indri, Pascou said kidoky <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> that, and that it had a rounder face, more similar to a sifaka. [...] Pascou also speculated that kidoky could stand on two legs and that it was a solitary animal.|$|E
