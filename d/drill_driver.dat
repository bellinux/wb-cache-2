40|$|To {{facilitate}} collaborative {{design in}} vocational education institutions, {{we have conducted}} a project to establish a nationwide PDM platform for four different schools spread all over the country. The particular aim of a follow up project introduced in {{this paper is to}} sensitize the participating students to sustainable design and lifecycle assessment (LCA) and provide them with hands-on tools through the PDM platform to accomplish these tasks. As a collaborative case study project, a cordless <b>drill</b> <b>driver</b> was chosen to be re-designed with respect to Ecodesign aspects. Since LCA is truly a holistic task, we focused on the ecological aspects of material and production stage. Distribution, usage and end-of-life stages were left out as well as economic and social aspects. The <b>drill</b> <b>driver</b> was divided into housing, drill chuck, gear and power unit. Each component was assigned to one of the schools and had to be designed with respect to reduced environmental impacts. Since different CAD systems are used the decision to provide the needed tools and environmental information within the PDM platform rather than CAD environment was easy. Some of the PDM systems on the market do also provide lifecycle analysis modules but it is rather a black box approach than a transparent data and reporting source. Because LCA heavily relies on the method itself and the way analysis is conducted we decided to develop our own tools. Therefore, a new, adapted interface was developed using open source business intelligence software called Pentaho to facilitate on the fly reporting and analytics of the work in progress by the users. Furthermore, the Ecoinvent database was connected to the PDM system to provide required information on carbon footprint and cumulated energy demand. The paper discusses strength and weaknesses of tools and methods with respect to the introduced case study and gives an outlook on ontology representation for the data model for better analysis capabilities...|$|E
50|$|Throughout his career, a Marine can specialise in {{a number}} of {{different}} roles upon completion of their respective courses after spending 1-2 years as a general duties (GD) Marine. Examples of some specialisations and different courses includes the mountain leader (ML), physical training instructor (PTI), Assault Engineer (AE), military police (MP), sniper course, medical assistant, pilot, reconnaissance operator (RO), <b>drill</b> instructor, <b>driver,</b> clerk, chef, signaller, combat intelligence, armourer, and heavy weapons training. Royal Marines can also apply for swimmer canoeist/Special Boat Service selection (SBS) or any other branch of the UKSF. All Royal Marines will also conduct training exercises on differing military skills on a regular basis including development in mountain, arctic, jungle, amphibious and desert warfare. They can also be involved in exchange training programs with other countries forces - particularly the United States Marine Corps and the Netherlands Marine Corps/Korps Mariniers.|$|R
50|$|A drill {{is a tool}} {{fitted with}} a cutting tool {{attachment}} or driving tool attachment, usually a <b>drill</b> bit or <b>driver</b> bit, used for boring holes in various materials or fastening various materials together. The attachment is gripped by a chuck {{at one end of}} the drill and rotated while pressed against the target material. The tip, and sometimes edges, of the cutting tool does the work of cutting into the target material. This may be slicing off thin shavings (twist drills or auger bits), grinding off small particles (oil drilling), crushing and removing pieces of the workpiece (SDS masonry drill), countersinking, counterboring, or other operations.|$|R
40|$|Head {{injuries}} are {{very common in}} children. All over the world, the most common mechanism is fall. These {{injuries are}} more prevalent in developing countries {{due to lack of}} education, poverty, lack of standard and scientific ways to child upbringing. Penetrating injuries in pediatric patients is extremely uncommon and usually occur due to sharp objects like knife, screw <b>driver,</b> <b>drills,</b> nails. We are reporting a rare case of a child with penetrating head injury due to tea cup, very commonly used crockery in every house hold. To the best of our knowledge, no similar case has ever been reported in world literature. Our case also emphasized the need for educating people about child care...|$|R
50|$|In 1941 WAAAF's {{were posted}} to Bankstown. The women were trained as clerks, {{wireless}} telegraphists, mess orderlies, <b>drill</b> instructors and <b>drivers,</b> {{a portion of}} these women were assigned {{to work in the}} command centre (Bankstown Bunker) located on Black Charlies Hill. In 1942, Belmore House, the current sight of today's Roselands Shopping Centre was used by the Australian Army for the training of troops. Tents on the property were used to house an infantry battalion and an ambulance corps. The site was vacated after a year. Units of the US Air Force were based in Bankstown after 1942, earning the suburb the nickname 'Yankstown'. Also in 1942 a military hospital was established for the U.S. Army at Herne Bay, now known as Riverwood. It was the largest military hospital in Australia during World War II. Known as the 118 General Hospital it consisted of 490 timber barracks-type buildings, which could house a total of 4,250 beds and accommodate up to 1,250 patients and 3,500 staff.Within the same year 16 US fighter planes that were based at Bankstown airport flew over Canterbury racecourse at low altitude during a race meet. This was to let the Australian public, especially those of the district to know that they, their allies were there for their protection. Regardless of these events, punters were annoyed at the disruption caused.|$|R
40|$|So far jack-ups have {{successfully}} operated in depths of 80 to 100 m {{and some are}} capable of operating in water depths of up to 150 m. In order to circumvent the depth limitation, it was suggested by Heerema Marine Contractors (HMC) that a base could be designed {{with the ability to}} support a jack-up rig, thereby increasing its operational depth capability. Such a support structure for jack-ups (named SSfJ) that can possibly be mobilized and demobilized by an HMC vessel would allow HMC to offer its services {{to another part of the}} Oil and Gas industry, the Drilling and Workover sector. A first investigation into the feasibility of this idea is carried out in this thesis. The focus of the thesis is placed on determining whether a 3 -legged North Sea drilling jack-up can potentially survive on a SSfJ and on the calculation of the structural characteristics of the SSfJ that are required for enabling a jack-up to do so. The first step in this research was to verify if there is a commercial driver for the SSfJ. Therefore a market research took place which focused on the North Sea offshore drilling industry and showed that there is a need for high spec and deep water jack-ups and a great need for reduction in <b>drilling</b> costs. The <b>driver</b> was therefore clear, namely that there is a need to design a SSfJ that will enable jack-ups to operate in deeper water without much increase in costs. Then, based on market information it was decided to consider a SSfJ that would add 30 m of water depth capability to the GustoMSC CJ 70 jack-up type. The main (technical) part of the thesis focused on identifying how the jack-up integrity will be influenced when it is placed on the SSfJ and what structural characteristics the SSfJ should have in order to enable a jack-up to survive on it through the harshest North Sea environmental conditions. The influence of the use of the SSfJ was assessed via reasonable assumptions that were then verified with analysis in the software SACS. The required structural characteristics of the SSfJ were identified as the SSfJ stiffness and rotational fixity at the SSfJ – jack-up interface. Recommended values for these characteristics were identified via an iterative procedure that includes a simplified dynamic analysis method that uses a Dynamic Amplification Factor. The results were then verified with a more accurate method that employs the time domain simulations in SACS. The outcome of the research is that the jack-up integrity is not influenced negatively by the use of SSfJ and that if the SSfJ has the recommended structural characteristics then the jack-up can survive the harshest environmental conditions in the North Sea.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{identify}} {{whether there}} is evidence of pneumoconiosis and other respiratory health effects associated with exposure to respirable mixed dust and quartz in United Kingdom opencast coalmines. METHODS: A cross sectional study of current workers (1224 men, 25 women) was carried out at nine large and medium sized opencast sites in England, Scotland, and Wales. To characterise a range of occupational groups within the industry, full shift measurements of personal exposures to respirable dust and quartz were taken. Up to three surveys were carried out at each site, covering all four seasons. For the purposes of comparisons with health indices these groups were further condensed into five broad combined occupational groups. Full sized chest radiographs, respiratory symptoms, occupational history questionnaires, and simple spirometry were used to characterise the respiratory health of the workforce. Logistic or multiple regression techniques were used to examine relations between indices of exposure and respiratory health. RESULTS: None of the group geometric mean dust concentrations, based on 626 valid dust samples, exceeded 1 mg. m- 3, and 99 % of all quartz concentrations were below 0. 4 mg. m- 3, the current maximum exposure limit. The highest quartz concentrations were experienced by the rock <b>drilling</b> team and <b>drivers</b> of bulldozers (used to move earth and stone from layers of coal). There were clear differences in mean respirable dust and quartz concentrations between occupational groups. These were consistent across the different sites, but depended in part on the day of measurement. The variations between sites were not much greater than between days, suggesting that differences between sites were at least partly explained by differences in conditions {{at the time of the}} measurements. The prevalence of radiographic small opacities profusion category > or = 1 / 0, based on the median of three readings, was 4. 4 %. Five men had category 2 pneumoconiosis and two men (including one of these five) had progressive massive fibrosis category A. From regression analyses, the relative risk of attaining a profusion of category > or = 0 / 1 was estimated to be doubled for every 10 years worked in the dustiest, preproduction opencast jobs, after allowing for age, smoking, and site effects. Risk was not associated with time worked in any other occupation within the industry, nor with previous employment in underground mining or other dusty jobs. Symptoms of chronic bronchitis were present in 13 % of the men. Frequency of chronic bronchitis was influenced by years worked in dusty jobs outside opencast mining, but not by time spent in occupations within the industry. Asthmatic symptoms were reported by 5 % of the workforce, close to the mean frequency found in adult men. No positive associations were found between asthma and occupational exposures. Lung function on average was close to predicted value and showed no relation to time worked in opencast occupations. CONCLUSIONS: Frequency of (mostly mild) chest radiographic abnormalities is associated with working in the dustier, preproduction jobs in the industry. Although some of these mild abnormalities may be non-occupational (due to aging or smoking), the association with exposure indicates a small risk of pneumoconiosis in these men, and the need to monitor and control exposures, particularly in the high risk occupations...|$|R
40|$|Since the 1960 s {{hydrocarbons}} like {{crude oil}} and natural gas have been the most important energy source to fuel the world economy. Despite high recent growth rates for renewable energies, hydro- carbons are expected to be a dominant source of energy for several decades to come. In the last 20 years not only fundamental trends, but also singular events such as the financial crisis have shaped the development of crude {{oil and natural}} gas markets as well as the corresponding academic debate. On a historic scale these last two decades have seen changes in oil and gas markets that - in terms of price and regional production changes - are only matched by the turmoils of the oil crisis of the 1970 s. Hence, the objective of this thesis is to improve the understanding of some of the dynamics and trends underlying these developments. Around the turn of the millenium the growth of wealth and resource consumption in emerging economies and the fear of shrinking oil and gas production in industrialized countries refueled the time-honored debate about the point of time when the supply of fossil energy resources will reach its historic all time high. Labeled as the “peak oil hypothesis” the discussion gained most momentum for the case of crude oil, but similar worries were also expressed for natural gas. These solicitudes were also reflected and amplified by prolonged and steep increases in global oil and gas prices which in turn raises the question of how strong hydrocarbon supply will react to these price shocks. Accordingly, Chapter 2 of this thesis addresses oil and gas supply response to oil and gas price changes in the US. More specifically, because oil and gas supply can only be kept constant or increased by drilling additional wells, the essay focuses on the response of oil and gas drilling activity to changes in oil and gas prices as well as drilling costs. In the late year 2008 the oil and gas price boom came to a sudden end in a stark collapse during the turbulences of the financial crisis and its macroeconomic aftermath. Both oil and gas prices stopped plummeting only in spring 2009. Whereas global oil prices quickly recovered to pre-crisis levels, the US price of natural gas stayed at low levels and even started to trend slightly downward. Given the growing gas prices in Europe this led several market stakeholders to announce a disintegration of the Atlantic gas market into an US market and an European market. However, given quickly expanding transport capacities and trade volumes for liquified natural gas (LNG) other industry participants hesitate to consent with the market decoupling hypothesis. Accordingly, Chapter 3 empirically investigates the integration of Atlantic gas markets before and after the financial crisis. Price spikes are a frequent phenomenon in natural gas and other commodity markets. This can result in a low power of empirical market integration tests that are based on threshold autoregressive models. Similarly, threshold autoregressive (TAR) model based estimates of the transaction costs of arbitrage can be subject to large small sample biases when extreme price movements are present. To address this Chapter 4 investigates the small sample properties of TAR estimators and TAR based market (co-) integration tests. To remedy the poor small sample properties of the usual OLS based TAR estimation we propose two robust estimators. Accordingly, Chapter 4 methodologically advances the econometric approaches used in Chapter 3. In North America, the major driver underlying this putative gas market decoupling was the so called shale revolution - a term that describes a steep and unforeseen increase in hydrocarbon supply from unconventional shale formations in the US. The shale revolution started off in gas markets where the novel combination of hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling in formerly unfamiliar shale geology enabled sweeping production gains. However, oil drilling also quickly adopted the new approach. By tapping shale oil resources with cost-efficient technologies and pulled by high oil prices US crude oil production is now close to surpassing its historic all time high of November 1970. Hence, for the moment the advent of the US shale revolution has refuted most arguments for an impending now and forever peak in US oil or gas production. As shale resources are available in many countries around the globe, the success of the US shale revolution stimulates the desire to replicate the shale revolution in other countries. A large part of the technical side of the replication debate is about updating the technology of rig fleets such that they are capable of performing hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling. However, in the US industry participants also highlight the importance of accumulated experience in using these technologies in a given region. Against this background, Chapter 5 investigates the role of drilling technology and local <b>drilling</b> experience as <b>drivers</b> of the oil and gas production growth during the US shale revolution. When the accumulation of local experience plays a crucial role for shale oil and gas production, it might be difficult to replicate the shale revolution in other countries by merely updating the technology level of the old rig fleet...|$|R
