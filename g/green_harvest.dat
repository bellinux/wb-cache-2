2500|$|While true {{for most}} wine grape varieties, {{the quality of}} Chenin blanc wine is intimately {{connected}} to the care taken in the vineyard. If the grapes are harvested too soon, before they ripen, the high acidity of the resulting wine will be (according to wine expert Oz Clarke) [...] "one of the nastiest wines possible". If the grapes are harvested at too high of a yield, the grapes will not retain any of Chenin blanc's distinctive character notes. In the Loire, French regulations mandate that yields be kept low (40-50 hl/ha). At these levels, more of Chenin blanc's varietal characteristics of floral, honeyed aromas are exhibited. When the grape is harvested at high yields, such as the California Central Valley average of 10 tons per acre (175 hl/ha), Chenin's flavors become more bland and neutral. The vine is naturally vigorous and prone to overcropping if not kept in check. In fertile soils, as in parts of South Africa, Chenin blanc can easily produce yields of 240 hl/ha. To keep yields in check, vineyard managers may choose to graft Chenin vines with less vigorous rootstock from Vitis riparia or Vitis rupestris vines. During the growing season, they may also elect to do a <b>green</b> <b>harvest</b> where excess grape clusters are removed.|$|E

5000|$|When {{results from}} {{empirical}} research put the sugarcane industry, and {{companies such as}} HC&S, in an undesirable light, the counter argument most often presented is that pre-harvest burning is the most cost effective method of harvesting stalks. HC&S administrators insist that the burnt harvest method is “critical to the company’s bottom line” {{and it would be}} economically inefficient to do otherwise. However, harvesting sugarcane without burning the stalks, or <b>green</b> <b>harvesting,</b> {{has been found to be}} just as economically efficient as burnt cane harvesting in a multi-regional study performed by agricultural researchers at the University of Florida. Sugarcane plantations in Texas, Louisiana, and Puerto Rico have proven that <b>green</b> <b>harvesting</b> can be done without jeopardizing the company’s profits, making it a win-win situation for both the company and the surrounding community. <b>Green</b> <b>harvesting</b> on Maui would require HC&S to upgrade their plowing machinery and harvesting equipment, but after this initial expense, profits would not necessarily be negatively affected.|$|R

50|$|A <b>green</b> <b>harvest</b> is {{the removal}} of {{immature}} grape bunches, typically {{for the purpose of}} decreasing yield. The removal of the bunches while they are still green induces the vine to put all its energy into developing the remaining grapes. In theory this results in better ripening and the development of more numerous and mature flavour compounds. In the absence of a <b>green</b> <b>harvest,</b> a healthy, vigorous vine can produce dilute, unripe grapes.|$|E

40|$|In Sicily in the 2010 - 2012 period <b>green</b> <b>harvesting</b> is {{the most}} {{successful}} of the 9 measures provided by the Italian National Support Programme (NSP) for wine. Its main goal is to contribute to restoring the balance between supply and demand by destructing or removing grape bunches in their immature stage {{in order to prevent}} market crises. The paper firstly presents the main results of a "three-year" application of <b>Green</b> <b>Harvesting</b> measure to the Sicilian wine sector. Firstly the implementation of <b>Green</b> <b>Harvesting</b> Measure was examined at EU, national and regional level through the analysis of the available statistical data; at a later stage its effects on the Sicilian wine sector were investigated. The trend of vineyard area and wine production was studied by comparing them before and throughout the application of <b>Green</b> <b>Harvesting.</b> Another stage of the research consisted of a survey carried out through direct interviews to 30 Sicilian wine cooperatives, the aim of which was to collect and analyse the trend of grape quantities delivered to the cooperatives, as well as the correspondent prices concerning the last 6 grape harvests (2007 - 2012). Another aim of the research was to collect the most common viewpoints and impressions of people working in the wine sector cooperatives with regards to the above-mentioned measure. The study has pointed out that "Green Harvesting" has been contributing - together with other elements - to reduce the supply of wine grape in Sicily and partially to raise the prices of the wines involved in this region. This measure has been however object of criticisms in relation to its impact in economic, social and ethical terms...|$|R
50|$|In Europe, many appellations {{restrict}} the yield permitted from a given area, {{so there is}} even more incentive to perform <b>green</b> <b>harvesting</b> when presented with excess crop.

50|$|Bordeaux {{has seen}} {{a rise in the}} use of green harvesting, where unripe bunches are cut off in the summer in order to channel more of the plant's {{strength}} to the remaining bunches. While it is a popular process, it also has its opponents, such as Jean Gautreau of Château Sociando-Mallet, Gonzague Lurton of Château Durfort-Vivens and Olivier Bernard of Domaine de Chevalier, who claim that the remaining berries simply grow bigger, not better. Green harvesting requires cheap labor, often ignorant of properly cutting vines. Opponents point to vintages 1929 and 1947, which were high-yield and of great quality—and made entirely without <b>green</b> <b>harvest</b> techniques.|$|E

50|$|Following several {{trips to}} France and {{disputes}} with his father, Angelo Gaja introduced several practices {{to the region}} over the following years, revolutionary to the vinification of Nebbiolo. From 1961 began the first experiments with <b>green</b> <b>harvest</b> or diradamento, and single vineyard production was started with Sorí San Lorenzo in 1967, Sorí Tildin in 1970 and Costa Russi in 1978. Since 1970 Gaja has employed the eminent oenologist Guido Rivella. Gaja is also credited with introducing to Piemonte malolactic fermentation, from the 1975-1976 vintage implementing French barriques ten years after initial experiments, bringing in thermo-controllable fermentation equipment and French grape varieties, and eventually grand cru prices. Giovanni Gaja opposed his son's use of new barriques and the decision to plant French grape varieties.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{sugarcane}} <b>green</b> <b>harvest</b> system, {{characterized by}} mechanized harvesting {{and the absence}} of crop burning, affects soil quality by increasing crop residue on the soil surface after harvest; thus, it contributes to improving the physical, chemical, and microbiological properties and influences the soil carbon content and CO 2 flux (FCO 2). This study aimed to evaluate the spatial and temporal variability of soil FCO 2 in sugarcane <b>green</b> <b>harvest</b> systems. The experiment was conducted in two areas of sugarcane in São Paulo, Brazil: the first had a 5 -year history of sugarcane <b>green</b> <b>harvest</b> (SG- 5) and the second had a longer history of 10 years (SG- 10). The temporal FCO 2 were evaluated in the dry and rainy periods, and spatial variability in the dry period, and related to soil chemical and physical properties, including organic C porosity, bulk density, soil penetration resistance, mean weight diameter of soil aggregates, clay, P, S, Ca, Mg and Fe. The temporal variability indicated no differences between the dry and rainy periods in SG- 10, while in SG- 5 soil moisture was increased by 33 % in the rainy period. The spatial variability indicated a different pattern from the temporal one, where FCO 2 in SG- 10 was correlated with soil temperature, air-filled pore space, total porosity, soil moisture, and the Ca and Mg contents; in the SG- 5 area, FCO 2 was correlated with soil mean weight diameter of soil aggregates and the sulfur content...|$|E

Whilst the conditions at heavy metal contaminated sites are challenging, successful phytoremediation would bring significant economic and social benefits. Seed-based Miscanthus hybrids were tested alongside the commercial clone Miscanthus × giganteus on arable land, contaminated with Pb, Cd and Zn near Katowice. Before the randomized experimental plots were established (25 m 2 plots with plant density 2 /m 2) ‘time-zero’ soil samples were taken to determine initial levels of total (aqua regia) and bioavailable (CaCl 2 extraction) concentration of Pb, Cd and Zn. After the growing season plant material was sampled during autumn (October, <b>green</b> <b>harvest)</b> and winter (March, brown harvest) to determine differences in heavy metal uptake. Results after the first growing season are presented, including the plot establishment success, biomass yield and heavy metal uptake...|$|E
