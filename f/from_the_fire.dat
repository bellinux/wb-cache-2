5|$|As {{a result}} of the duel between the two ironclads, Monitor had been struck twenty-two times, {{including}} nine hits to the turret and two hits to the pilothouse. She had managed to fire forty-one shots from her pair of Dahlgren guns. Virginia had sustained ninety-seven indentations to her armor <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> of Monitor and other ships. Neither ship had sustained any significant damage. In the opinion of Virginias commander Jones and her other officers, Monitor could have sunk their ship had she hit the vessel at the waterline.|$|E

5|$|Causes {{of death}} of adult ibis {{are not well}} known. Alligators could feasibly prey on nesting ibises {{but there has been}} little {{research}} in the area. A flock of fifty adult American white ibis were killed in a fire in the Everglades. The corpses were found in a dense swathe of cattail (Typha angustifolia), which suggested they had taken shelter there. It is unclear why they {{had not been able to}} fly away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire,</b> but one hypothesis was that they had been foraging for insects disturbed by the fire.|$|E
5|$|Filmed in full scale, {{the school}} {{explosion}} used drywall around {{the interior of}} the set to protect it <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire.</b> Physical effects supervisor Gary Monak oversaw the explosion. The destruction surprised the cast as they were more used to optical effects in the series. Costume designer Robert Blackman created the Vedek costumes. Crew-members suggested that Blackman based his Vedek hats on the form of the Sydney Opera House, but Blackman denied the design was deliberate.|$|E
5|$|Firefighters <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fire</b> Department of the City of New York (FDNY), at {{that time}} a {{volunteer}} organization, arrived {{under the command of}} Chief Engineer Cornelius Anderson. As the fire grew, the FDNY personnel were joined by retired fire chiefs from the city and firefighting crews from Brooklyn, Newark, and Williamsburg. Firemen battling the blaze were aided by water flowing from the Croton Aqueduct, which had been completed in 1842. The fire either weakened in intensity or had been subdued by firefighters by 1:00 p.m. that day.|$|E

5|$|Ironically, in {{the next}} year, the Great Fire of London (1666) was to be of benefit to him, when he {{received}} one of the City of London's first new artistic commissions to paint twenty-two full length portraits of the so-called 'Fire Judges' (those appointed to assess the property disputes arising <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire).</b> These paintings, completed in 1670, hung in London's Guildhall until it was bombed during World War II; today only two (those of Sir Matthew Hale and Sir Hugh Wyndham) remain in the Guildhall Art Gallery the remainder having been destroyed or dispersed.|$|E
5|$|The White House, {{originally}} {{dating back}} to 1750, is timber framed and was extended in 1830 {{and again in the}} 1960s. The exterior is covered in hung slates, which caused extensive damage to the original frame which required extensive repairs in 1994. The 1797 chimneys are pointed in shape, to stop birds nesting and draw smoke up <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire.</b> The lawn {{in front of the building}} was the house's original turning circle, with the road once being a thoroughfare from Chingford to Waltham Abbey.|$|E
5|$|The {{house was}} insured in 1857 for £10,000 (£ today); the {{contents}} {{at that time}} included books and wines (insured for £2,250), mathematical and musical instruments (£250), and pictures (£1,000). The art collection included several family portraits and other works by Sir Joshua Reynolds, which were saved <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> that gutted the building early in January 1866. Extensive restoration work for Hungerford Crewe was completed in 1870.|$|E

5|$|The most {{prominent}} building in Lookout Point {{is the local}} fire station, which also serves both Caversham and Green Island. This 1956 structure is located immediately {{to the north of}} the saddle and is a prominent landmark upon entering or leaving Dunedin. Not far <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> station to the north-east is Dunedin's tallest tree, a eucalyptus measuring an estimated 100 metres. The Dunedin Southern Motorway officially begins at the Lookout Point saddle, between Calton Hill and Maryhill, and sweeps down over broken hill country past Green Island to Mosgiel and the Taieri Plains.|$|E
5|$|According to the Accident Investigation Board Norway, {{the rescue}} work was {{hampered}} by, among other things: lack of fire crew at Voss {{to drive the}} fire engine, a defective helicopter bucket, and a three-hour delay <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> to a rail carriage with water was sent from Ål. Also, the fire carriage from Voss arrived six hours after the accident was reported. Concerns were raised regarding the fire hazards of wooden snow tunnels, and the National Rail Administration admitted {{that they should be}} made of a more fire-proof material, such as concrete or steel. Following the accident, the National Rail Administration decided that all welding would have to be monitored for several hours after completion of the work.|$|E
5|$|After Pipe's speech, Crawford was {{stripped}} naked and beaten. His hands were tied behind his back, and a rope was tied {{from his hands}} to a post in the ground. A large fire was lit {{about six or seven}} yards (6 m) from the pole. Indian men shot charges of gunpowder into Crawford's body, then cut off his ears. Crawford was poked with burning pieces of wood <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire,</b> and hot coals were thrown at him, which he was compelled to walk on. Crawford begged Girty to shoot him, but Girty was unwilling or afraid to intervene. After about two hours of torture, Crawford fell down unconscious. He was scalped, and a woman poured hot coals over his head, which revived him. He began to walk about insensibly as the torture continued. After he finally died, his body was burned.|$|E

5|$|During the Second World War, Hurst was re-armed in 1940 {{with two}} 12-pounder (5.4kg) guns and {{a unit of}} the Isle of Wight Rifles was {{stationed}} there, controlled <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fire</b> Control Needles. Searchlights and two more 6-pounder (5.4kg) guns followed the next year, when the 37-strong detachment was retitled the 129 Coastal Battery Royal Artillery, followed by the installation of Bofors anti-aircraft guns. A tower, called the Director Tower, was built along the west wing. As the war progressed, the weapons were stood down and the battery finally closed in July 1945, with most of the weapons being removed after the war.|$|E
5|$|Firefighters were {{confident}} that the remaining fires could be extinguished during the dayTuesday 13 December. The smoke plume had been considerably reduced and was more grey, indicating the amount of vapourised water now combining with the smoke. It was reported at 16:45 that all tank fires had been extinguished, although some smaller fires persisted. 75% of firefighters for Hertfordshire were involved in fighting the fire, supported by 16other brigades. The entire gold command operation, involving many agencies {{as well as all}} the emergency services, was run from Hertfordshire Constabulary's headquarters in Welwyn Garden City, some distance <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire.</b>|$|E
5|$|Intense Confederate and {{especially}} Union artillery fire continued {{for at least}} an hour, slackening at about 2:30pm. At about 3:30pm, Lewis Armistead noticed Union skirmishers creeping towards his men where the grand battery on the Confederate right flank was, nearly within rifle range of them. Armistead sent three regiments (about half of his brigade) from his command to push back the skirmishers, thus beginning the infantry part of the battle. The skirmishers were repelled quickly, but Armistead's men found themselves {{in the midst of an}} intense Union barrage. The Confederates decided to nestle themselves in a ravine along the hill's slant. This position protected them <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire,</b> but pinned them down on the slopes of Malvern Hill, unsupported by either infantry or artillery. They did not have enough men to advance any further and retreating would have put them back into the crossfire.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> {{recovery}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>fires</b> began almost immediately, {{with plants}} such as fireweed appearing {{in a matter of}} days after a fire had passed. While surrounding national forests did some replanting and even dispersed grass seed by airplane, the regeneration in Yellowstone was generally so complete that no replanting was even attempted. Though some small plants did not immediately reassume their pre-fire habitats, most did, and the vast majority of plants regrew from existing sprouts which survived <b>the</b> heat <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>fires.</b> There was a profusion of wildflowers in burned areas, especially between two and fiveyears after <b>the</b> <b>fires.</b>|$|R

5|$|Investigators {{believed}} the aircraft captain survived {{for a short}} time after the crash. His body was a short distance away from his seat and both were a few metres ahead of the wreckage where they had been thrown after the nose of the aircraft was split open in the impact with a large tree. The seat belt had not broken, but it had been undone. The captain's tunic was pulled up over his head as though to protect his face from the heat of the nearby inferno. Investigators believed he survived the crash and undid his seat belt to drag himself away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire.</b> His body was not burnt, but autopsy showed both his legs were broken and he died from a fractured skull.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of , a fire {{broke out in the}} Old Building. It caused {{widespread}} damage to {{a large part of the}} structure, including the two oldest rooms in the school, School Room and Big School. The main concern was to prevent the books contained within the chained library from being damaged, either by fire or water <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> brigade's hoses. The damage to the building was so great that rebuilding took over 2 years, with the unusually cold winter of 1962–1963 delaying the restoration. Lessons, however, continued throughout on the Allen House side of the high street.|$|E
5|$|Property losses <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> can be {{accounted}} for with relative certainty as detailed surveys were made immediately afterwards. City surveyor Søren Balle submitted the first survey on 1 November 1728 and on 13 April 1729 the Magistrate of Copenhagen finished a second, made according to a royal request of 12 December 1728. The {{differences between the two}} surveys are limited to the extent of the damages on 43lots, so it is fairly certain that 1,227lots containing about 1,600buildings were lost in flames. All of Copenhagen consisted of about 4,500lots (per the cadastre of 1699), so about 28% of the lots were lost. For the medieval part of town the ratio is 47%.|$|E
