5|$|Kepler-40b <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>Hot</b> Jupiter that is {{estimated}} to be 2.2 times the mass of Jupiter (over 700 times the mass of Earth), but 1.17 times Jupiter's radius (13.12 times the radius of Earth). Thus, the planet has a density of 1.68grams per cubic centimeter, similar to that of Neptune (1.638 g/cm3). The planet's equilibrium temperature {{is estimated}} to be 1620 K, thirteen times hotter than Jupiter's equilibrium temperature.|$|E
5|$|Kepler-5b <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>Hot</b> Jupiter with a {{mass that}} is 2.114 times that of Jupiter and a radius of 1.431 times Jupiter's radius. This also means that Kepler-5b is not very dense. The planet's {{measured}} density is 0.894grams/cm3, {{less than that of}} pure water and comparable only to the density of Saturn, which is approximately 0.69grams/cm3. The planet has an equilibrium temperature of 1868 K, making it fifteen times hotter than Jupiter.|$|E

5|$|The {{brightest}} {{star in the}} constellation is Alpha Telescopii, a blue-white subgiant with an apparent magnitude of 3.5, followed by the orange giant star Zeta Telescopii at magnitude 4.1. Eta and PZ Telescopii are two young star systems with debris disks and brown dwarf companions. Telescopium hosts two unusual stars with very little hydrogen {{that are likely to}} be the result of two merged white dwarfs: PV Telescopii, also known as HD 168476, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>hot</b> blue extreme helium star, while RS Telescopii is an R Coronae Borealis variable. RR Telescopii is a cataclysmic variable that brightened as a nova to magnitude 6 in 1948.|$|E
5|$|There is one known {{planet in}} the orbit of WASP-44: WASP-44b. The planet <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>Hot</b> Jupiter with a mass of 0.889 Jupiters. Its radius is 1.14 times that of Jupiter. WASP-44b orbits its host star every 2.4238039 days at a {{distance}} 0.03473 AU, approximately 3.47% the mean distance between the Earth and Sun. With an orbital inclination of 86.02º, WASP-44b has an orbit that exists almost edge-on to its host star with respect to Earth. WASPA-44b's orbital eccentricity is fit to 0.036, indicating a mostly circular orbit.|$|E
5|$|WASP-15 is a {{magnitude}} 11 star located about 1000 light-years {{away in the}} constellation Hydra. The star, which is more massive, larger, hotter, and more luminous than the Sun, is also less metal-rich than the Sun. WASP-15 has one known planet in its orbit, WASP-15b; the planet <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>Hot</b> Jupiter with an anomalously high radius, a phenomenon which {{may be explained by}} the presence of an internal heat source. The star was first observed by the SuperWASP program in 2006; future measurements in 2007 and 2008, as well as follow-up observations and analysis, eventually led to the discovery of WASP-15b using the transit method and Doppler spectroscopy.|$|E

5|$|WASP-15 is host to {{the planet}} WASP-15b. The planet, which <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>Hot</b> Jupiter, orbits its host star at a {{distance}} of 0.0499 AU every 3.7520656 days. WASP-15b was noted by its discoverers because of its anomalously high radius, which is 1.428 times that of Jupiter, compared to its mass, which is 0.542 times the size of Jupiter. WASP-15b's large radius cannot be explained solely by its proximity to its star, suggesting that some form of tidal heating or other internal heating mechanism is also involved.|$|E
5|$|WASP-43b is a transiting {{planet in}} orbit around the young, active, and low-mass star WASP-43 in the {{constellation}} Sextans. The planet <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>Hot</b> Jupiter with a mass twice that of Jupiter, but with a roughly equal radius. WASP-43b was flagged as a candidate by the SuperWASP program before they conducted follow-ups using instruments at La Silla Observatory in Chile, which confirmed its existence and provided orbital and physical characteristics. The planet's discovery was published on April 14, 2011.|$|E
5|$|Kepler-40b, {{formerly}} known as KOI-428b, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>hot</b> Jupiter discovered in orbit around the star Kepler-40, which {{is about to become}} a red giant. The planet was first noted as a transit event by NASA's Kepler spacecraft. The Kepler team made data collected by its satellite publicly available, including data on Kepler-40; French and Swiss astronomers used the equivalent to one night of measurements on the SOPHIE échelle spectrograph to collect all the data needed to show that a planet was producing the periodic dimming of Kepler-40. The planet, Kepler-40b, is twice the mass of Jupiter and slightly larger than it in size, making it as dense as Neptune. The planet is also nearly thirteen times hotter than Jupiter and orbits five times closer to its star than Mercury is from the Sun.|$|E

5|$|Kepler-5b {{is one of}} {{the first}} five planets {{discovered}} by NASA's Kepler spacecraft. It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>Hot</b> Jupiter that orbits a subgiant star that is more massive, larger, and more diffuse than the Sun is. Kepler-5 was first flagged as the location of a possibly transiting planet, and was reclassified as a Kepler Object of Interest until follow-up observations confirmed the planet's existence and many of its characteristics. The planet's discovery was announced at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society on January 4, 2010. The planet has approximately twice the mass of Jupiter, and is about 1.5 times larger. It is also fifteen times hotter than Jupiter. Kepler-5b orbits Kepler-5 every 3.5 days at a distance of approximately 0.051 AU (7.6 Gm).|$|E
5|$|Kepler-6b <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>hot</b> Jupiter, {{having a}} mass 0.669 {{times that of}} Jupiter, but an average {{distance}} of only 0.046 AU from its star and, thus, an orbital period of 3.23 days. It is almost 10 times closer to its star than Mercury is from our Sun. As a result, Kepler-6b is strongly irradiated by its star, heating its atmosphere to a temperature of 1660 K and puffing {{it up to a}} size 1.3 times that of Jupiter. It may also be the case that Kepler-6b has a thermal inversion of its atmosphere, where temperature increases with increasing distance {{from the center of the}} planet. However, additional observations are required to confirm or refute this possibility.|$|E
5|$|The mantle is {{equivalent}} to 10 to 15 Earth masses and is rich in water, ammonia and methane. As is customary in planetary science, this mixture {{is referred to as}} icy even though it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>hot,</b> dense fluid. This fluid, which has a high electrical conductivity, is sometimes called a water–ammonia ocean. The mantle may consist of a layer of ionic water in which the water molecules break down into a soup of hydrogen and oxygen ions, and deeper down superionic water in which the oxygen crystallises but the hydrogen ions float around freely within the oxygen lattice. At a depth of 7,000km, the conditions may be such that methane decomposes into diamond crystals that rain downwards like hailstones. Very-high-pressure experiments at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory suggest that the base of the mantle may be an ocean of liquid carbon with floating solid 'diamonds'.|$|E

Another popular Tibetan food is 'Thukpa', which <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>hot</b> noodle soup with meat, eggs and vegetables. Kinema, Chhurpi, Shaphalay,(Tibetan bread stuffed with meat). Fermented foods and beverages are consumed by {{a large percentage of}} the population. Fermented foods include preparations of soybean, bamboo shoots, milk and Sel roti, which is made from rice. Tea (esp. the butter tea) is the most popular delicacy, Alcoholic beverages include Tongba, Jnaard and Chhaang, variations of a local beer made from fermenting finger millet.|$|E
5|$|Zeta Persei is the third-brightest {{star in the}} {{constellation}} at magnitude 2.86. Around 750 light-years from Earth, it is a blue-white supergiant 26–27 times the radius of the Sun and 47,000 times its luminosity. It is the brightest star (as seen from Earth) of a moving group of bright blue-white giant and supergiant stars, the Perseus OB2 Association or Zeta Persei Association. Zeta is a triple star system, with a companion blue-white main sequence star of spectral type B8 and apparent magnitude 9.16 around 3900 AU distant from the primary, and a white main sequence star of magnitude 9.90 and spectral type A2, some 50,000 AU away, {{that may or may}} not be gravitationally bound to the other two. X Persei is a double system in this association; one component <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>hot,</b> bright star and the other is a neutron star. With an apparent magnitude of 6.72, it is too dim to be seen with the naked eye even in perfectly dark conditions. The system is an X-ray source and the primary star appears to be undergoing substantial mass loss. Once thought to be a member of the Perseus OB2 Association, Omicron Persei is a multiple star system with a combined visual magnitude of 3.85. It is composed of two blue-white starsa giant of spectral class B1.5 and main sequence star of B3which orbit each other every 4.5 days and are distorted into ovoids due to their small separation. The system has a third star about which little is known. At an estimated distance of 1475 light-years from Earth, the system is now thought to lie too far from the center of the Zeta Persei group to belong to it.|$|E
