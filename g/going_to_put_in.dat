5|$|While {{portraying the}} bonds between {{the members of}} Class Zero, and between them and their summoned monsters, along with the game's themes of death and war, Naora drew {{inspiration}} from {{when he saw a}} cat killed by a car surrounded by other cats. Nomura was in charge of choosing the voice cast, which featured several well-known voice actors. When listening to the samples and picking the actors, Nomura focused on whether they could successfully project the characters' personalities. The actors and actresses helped define the characters, adding individual touches during voice recording sessions. Sayoko Hoshino acted as the game's character texture artist. Originally, she was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> black voids where a female character's panties would have been due to hardware limitations. However the staff realized that the players would be looking at the backs of characters a lot, so Hoshino designed panties for each female character and worked with the staff to incorporate them into the character models.|$|E
5|$|Because if we'd gone to Baghdad {{we would}} have been all alone. There wouldn't have been anybody else with us. There would have been a U.S. {{occupation}} of Iraq. None of the Arab forces that were willing to fight with us in Kuwait were willing to invade Iraq. Once you got to Iraq and took it over, took down Saddam Hussein's government, then what are you <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> its place? That's a very volatile part of the world, and if you take down the central government of Iraq, you could very easily end up seeing pieces of Iraq fly off: part of it, the Syrians would like to have to the west, part of it—eastern Iraq—the Iranians would like to claim, they fought over it for eight years. In the north you've got the Kurds, and if the Kurds spin loose and join with the Kurds in Turkey, then you threaten the territorial integrity of Turkey. It's a quagmire if you go that far and try to take over Iraq. The other thing was casualties. Everyone was impressed with the fact {{we were able to do}} our job with as few casualties as we had. But for the 146 Americans killed in action, and for their families—it wasn't a cheap war. And the question for the president, in terms of whether or not we went on to Baghdad, took additional casualties in an effort to get Saddam Hussein, was how many additional dead Americans is Saddam worth? Our judgment was, not very many, and I think we got it right.|$|E
500|$|Film analyst Lina Badley {{has written}} that the Alien's design, with strong Freudian sexual undertones, {{multiple}} phallic symbols, and overall feminine figure, provides an androgynous image conforming to archetypal mappings and imageries in horror films that often redraw gender lines. O'Bannon himself later described the sexual imagery in Alien as overt and intentional: [...] "One thing that people are all disturbed about is sex... I said 'That's how I'm going to attack the audience; I'm going to attack them sexually. And I'm {{not going to go}} after the women in the audience, I'm going to attack the men. I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> every image I can think of to make the men in the audience cross their legs. Homosexual oral rape, birth. The thing lays its eggs down your throat, the whole number.|$|E

2500|$|Despite {{the lack}} of {{financial}} backing and grants, Mower {{and his team of}} physicians developed a working AICD by 1980. Dr. Levi Watkins, Jr. implanted the first AICD in a human patient in February 1980. At the time of the implantation, Mirowski and Mower had demonstrated that the device was effective in canines. The operating room at Johns Hopkins Hospital in which the first operation took place was crowded with onlookers. Mower recalled, “It was the talk of the whole hospital that these crazy guys are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> an automatic defibrillator. If something had gone awry, we would have never lived it down.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Yes, and we {{are going}} to journey from winter into summer,” added Phil. “It’s good we remembered that when we packed our suit-cases. At first I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> nothing but heavy clothing.” ...|$|E
60|$|When Katherine {{had been}} at Harbour Hill for a week she {{wondered}} how upon earth she was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> the remaining seven. Harbour Hill was noted for its beauty, but not every woman can live by scenery alone.|$|E

60|$|The {{scene was}} very {{peaceful}} and pastoral--almost too much so, {{the young man}} thought, with a shrug of his shoulders, as {{he stood in the}} worn steps and gazed about him.

6000|$|... "It {{was all in}} the paper, and Miss Pym, {{the teacher}} who boards at our house, told Ma about it.

6000|$|... "YOU {{must stay}} and keep us cheered up," [...] implored Felicity. [...] "I just don't know how I'm ever <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> the afternoon. I promised Kitty Marr that I'd {{go down and}} spend it with her, but I can't now. And I can't knit any at my lace. I'd just keep thinking, 'What is the use?

6000|$|... "Or we can {{say that}} we got left ashore by accident, when our craft sailed from Brest, and are going to rejoin her at Saint Malo, where she was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>in.</b> I think, perhaps, that that would be a better story than that we had run away. I don't know that the {{authorities}} interest themselves in runaway seamen from privateers but, at any rate, it is a likely tale. Drunken seamen, no doubt, often do get left ashore." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do believe," [...] said Tom, {{bursting}} into a shout of laughter, [...] "that they are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> us <b>in</b> the bows of their canoes, {{in place of}} their old gods." ...|$|R

We expected to have gotten our shells all made in town; but they are looking out so sharp for us just now that it was entirely too much of a risk to bring them out here." ...|$|E
60|$|So Jonas {{brought down}} the box trap that night. It was a long box, about {{as big as a}} cricket, with a tall, pointed back, which looked like a steeple; so Rollo called it the steeple trap. It was so made that if the {{squirrel}} should go in, and begin to nibble some corn, which they were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> there, it would make the cover come down and shut him in. They fixed the trap {{on the end of the}} log, and Jonas observed, as he sat on the log, that he could see the barn chamber window through a little opening among the trees. Of course he knew that from the barn chamber window he could see the trap, though it would be too far off to see it plain.|$|E

One Monday Cloete comes to the office a little late—hears a woman’s voice in George’s room and looks in. Newspapers on the desk, on the floor; Captain Harry’s wife sitting with red eyes and a bag on the chair near her. [...] . Look at this, says George, in great excitement, showing him a paper. Cloete’s heart gives a jump. Ha! Wreck in Westport Bay. The Sagamore gone ashore early hours of Sunday, and so the {{newspaper}} men had time to put in some of their work. Columns of it. Lifeboat out twice. Captain and crew remain by the ship. Tugs summoned to assist. If the weather improves, this well-known fine ship may yet be saved. [...] . You know the way these chaps put it. [...] . Mrs. Harry there on her way to catch a train from Cannon Street. Got an hour to wait.|$|E

5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Alexa Ainsworth from Universal Sports, Mitchell said of her preparations for the 2012 Olympics that Australian head coach, Peggy Liddick [...] "doesn't like us making too many changes {{the year of the}} Olympics, so most of the changes will be this year and if it's not stable than we won't do it. If we're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> upgrades it will be this year".|$|E
50|$|If we strip out {{vocabulary}} of these significant {{terms of the}} comparative period, what are we <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> their place, not only as labels for pigeon-holes, but also as expressions indicating the direction of our interest?

6000|$|... "I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> you <b>in</b> the Rose Room, Sister Bella," [...] Martha Scandwell planned aloud. [...] "But it will {{be better}} for her and the {{children}} and the nurses and everything there, so you shall have Queen Emma's Room." ...|$|R
