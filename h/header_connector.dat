40|$|The {{monolithic}} structural {{action of}} various types of walls of flanged cross section and walls with engaged stiffeners or returns (nonrectangular sections) is critically dependent on the shear capacity of the interface between the components making up the section. An assessment of the shear capacity of the interface may also be required {{as part of the}} elastic or inelastic analysis of structural elements. Observation of past earthquake events has confirmed that effectively connected flanges also directly influence the seismic performance of nonrectangular sections by providing a more robust and seismically resistant structural element. To analyze the significance of the parameters that influence the vertical shear resistance of interfaces of flanged sections of masonry obtained using different types of bonding and bonding patterns (<b>header</b> units, shear <b>connectors,</b> and wire ties), a series of specimens with “H-shaped” cross sections was tested. The vertical shear capacity of the interface at the flange-web intersection was assessed in each case and compared to predicted code capacities. Considerable strength reserves and shear ductility were observed in almost all cases. Following the experimental study, a numerical investigation was carried out using a simplified micromodeling finite element approach. It showed that both the size of the specimen as well as the boundary and applied loading conditions on the flanges can significantly influence the observed vertical shear resistance of the interfaces of specimens with the same bonding pattern. Using the results of the numerical investigation, the critical parameters for a test to determine the vertical shear capacity of brick masonry nonrectangular cross sections are assessed and the governing parameters for a suitable shear test suggested...|$|R

5000|$|Since most devices {{do not use}} all of the 20 {{signals that}} are defined by the standard, smaller {{connectors}} are often used. For example, the 9-pin DE-9 connector is used by most IBM-compatible PCs since the IBM PC AT, and has been standardized as TIA-574. More recently, modular connectors have been used. Most common are 8P8C connectors, for which the EIA/TIA-561 standard defines a pinout, while the [...] "Yost Serial Device Wiring Standard" [...] invented by Dave Yost (and popularized by the Unix System Administration Handbook) is common on Unix computers and newer devices from Cisco Systems. 10P10C connectors {{can be found on}} some devices as well. Digital Equipment Corporation defined their own DECconnect connection system which is based on the Modified Modular Jack (MMJ) connector. This is a 6-pin modular jack where the key is offset from the center position. As with the Yost standard, DECconnect uses a symmetrical pin layout which enables the direct connection between two DTEs. Another common connector is the DH10 <b>header</b> <b>connector</b> common on motherboards and add-in cards which is usually converted via a cable to the more standard 9-pin DE-9 connector (and frequently mounted on a free slot plate or other part of the housing).|$|E
40|$|AbstractIntroductionBefore IS- 1 (3. 2 mm) {{standardization}} of pacemaker leads and connectors, 5 / 6 mm connector ports accomodated 5 mm or 6 mm diameter lead connector pins. Case reportA patient with sick sinus syndrome underwent implantation of a 5 mm unipolar atrial lead, mated to a 5 / 6 mm connector port Medtronic Spectrax Sx 5985 pacemaker. Pulse generator reached ERI in 2006, with change {{out to a}} Medtronic Sigma SSR 306 (5 / 6 mm connector port) and preservation of the 5 mm lead. She was admitted in 2010 for atrial lead non capture from blood leak and corrosion of the header-connector pin apparatus. Discussion 5 / 6 mm pacemaker header ports have a 5 mm flexible sealing ring at the port entrance to seal 5 mm or 6 mm lead connector pins. The inner barrel diameter of the connector port is 6 mm and insertion of a 5 mm lead results in a 0. 5 mm tolerance circumferentially. Should the seal be compromised, blood can corrode the apparatus. To minimize this, we can employ (a) a cinching tie to further seal the silicone ring (b) universal adaptor sleeves (c) splice kits (d) lead adaptor kits. Aging leads, adaptor kits or sleeves themselves can result in lead failure. It may be safer to re-implant the entire system. ConclusionA 5 / 6 mm configuration pacemaker <b>header</b> <b>connector</b> port allows for significant tolerances when a 5 mm lead is used. Consideration {{must be made to}} prevent leaks...|$|E
