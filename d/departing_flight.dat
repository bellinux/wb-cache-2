5000|$|Controversy {{surrounded}} the final {{leg of the}} race: when Rob & Amber and Uchenna & Joyce arrived {{at the airport in}} San Juan, they were both sold tickets for a flight leaving later than one whose gate was about to close. While Rob & Amber managed to get on this earlier <b>departing</b> <b>flight,</b> Uchenna & Joyce were shown through the gate as the boarding corridor between the gate exitway and airplane began to shut. After a commercial break, the boarding corridor reopened to the gate to pick up Uchenna and Joyce. No explanation was given as to why the gate reopened, which has led to widespread speculation about intervention by the production staff. In the [...] "Revisiting the Race" [...] special feature on the Season 7 DVD, Uchenna, Rob, and Host Phil Keoghan deny the accusations of intervention by the production crew. Uchenna describes his experience with finding the same airline agent at the gate who had previously informed him that there was no earlier available flight. Rob describes Uchenna running around frantically trying to get onto the flight, which the final edited version of the show does not portray. Phil cites the fact that the decision to reopen the door rested solely with the pilot, and that intervention by the production crew would have resulted in someone leaking such information out.|$|E

5000|$|San Francisco and Oakland Helicopter Airlines {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{helicopter}} airlines to operate without a federal subsidy and it was also the first to operate with only turbine engine helicopters. Since helicopter landing sites were scarce at that time, the port of Oakland's board committee supported the service. Passenger flights started with two leased 10-passenger Sikorsky S-62 turbine helicopters. In late summer of 1961, the SFO Helicopter Airlines system timetable stated that 68 flights a day were operated, with the airline claiming that its helicopters made less noise than neighborhood trucks. In 1962, the U.S. Post Office Department granted San Francisco and Oakland Helicopter Airlines airmail contract number AM-103, allowing it to transport U.S. Mail until 1976. In 1965, the airline tried operating a 15-seat Westland-Bell SK-5 hovercraft between San Francisco International Airport (SFO), Oakland International Airport (OAK), and San Francisco. In 1969, it carried 320,000 passengers on more than 100 flights a day. According to the April 27, 1969 SFO Helicopter Airlines timetable, each arriving and <b>departing</b> <b>flight</b> at SFO served not one but two gates: American Airlines gate 45 and TWA gate 53 with staggered arrival and departure times for each flight at each gate being reflected in the timetable. [...] In May 1968, after continuous growth, the company's schedule reached 14 weekday departures from the San Francisco Ferry Building, 11 from Marin, 13 from Berkeley, three from a parking garage in Oakland, and 9 from Lafayette. For interline passengers connecting at SFO and then heading east beyond Colorado, the ticket to SFO cost $4.75 from Marin or Lafayette and only $4.50 from Berkeley.|$|E
50|$|The Singapore Changi Airport has a {{development}} policy of always building {{years ahead of}} demand to help to avoid congestion problems common in major airports and maintain high service standards. While the original master plan details plans for two passenger terminals, there have been provisions to provide for long-term expansion initiatives, including the allocation of space for a third terminal planned to have a physical configuration mirroring that of Terminal 2. Plans for Terminal 3 were however subsequently reviewed, resulting in a new design concept which departs from the largely utilitarian architecture {{in the first two}} terminals. Topped by a unique roof feature designed by Skidmore, Owings and Merrill, the terminal is equipped with a full-service nine-story Crowne Plaza Hotel on its premises. Officials commenced construction in 1999 after receiving the green light in December 1996. Originally planned for completion in 2006, the date was postponed by two years after global terrorism concerns delayed growth of air traffic in the airport. When completed in 2008, the expansion will increase the airport's total capacity to 64 million passengers. Construction of the Terminal 3 began in 1999, at an estimated cost of about S$1.75 billion. Originally planned for completion in 2006, the date was postponed by two years after global economic downturn delayed growth of air traffic in the airport. On 30 May 2006, a topping out ceremony for the terminal was conducted, and an open house was held from 12 November 2007 to 9 December 2007. Test flights were held from 12 November until 3 January where the baggage handling, check-in and ground handling systems were tested. The terminal became operational on 1 January 2007 with Singapore Airlines (SQ1) from San Francisco via Hong Kong being the first flight to arrive at the new terminal at 1156 local time (0356 UTC) and SQ318 at 1315 local time (0515 UTC) being the first <b>departing</b> <b>flight.</b> The terminal increases the airport's maximum passenger capacity annually by 22 million, bringing the total annual capacity up to 70 million passengers. Also, there is a full-service nine-storey Crowne Plaza Hotel immediately adjacent to Terminal 3.|$|E
