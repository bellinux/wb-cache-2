Did I not give a sufficient proof of my affection for you, in bestowing {{one of the first}} fortunes in England upon you? Have I repined or rebuked you for the way you have wasted it? No, I loved you too much and too fondly; I have always loved you. From the first moment I saw you, I felt irresistibly attracted towards you. I saw your bad qualities, and trembled at your violence; but I could not help loving you. I married you, though I knew I was sealing my own fate in doing so; and in spite of reason and duty.

5000|$|On October 27, 2008, {{during the}} afternoon, several militants transported Duhulow {{to a public}} stadium in Kismayo {{containing}} around 1,000 people. She reportedly struggled with the insurgents {{and at one point}} screamed, [...] "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>from</b> <b>me...</b> I'm not going, I'm not going. Don't kill me." [...] Four militants subsequently forced Duhulow into a dug out hole, burying her up to the neck. Around 50 militants participated in the ensuing execution, throwing rocks at her head. According to witnesses, nurses were then instructed to verify whether Duhulow was still alive. After ten minutes, she was dug out of the hole and two nurses confirmed that she was still alive, after which point Duhulow was put back in the hole and the stoning resumed. Although many witnesses to the event were too afraid of the armed militants to intervene, several bystanders attempted to save her. The insurgents responded by opening fire on them, in the process killing an eight-year-old boy. An Al-Shabaab spokesman later apologized for the child's death, and pledged that the shooter would be punished.|$|E
5000|$|According to one account, the {{incident}} occurred as follows: It {{was a cool}} day and Schnaebelé was wearing a coat and top hat. He walked briskly on the road leading from Nancy (France) to Metz (then in Lothringen, German Empire). The road is deserted. To his left are two French brothers working in a vineyard. To his right {{are a number of}} German railroad workers out of sight, but within earshot. Gautsch, his German colleague of Ars-sur-Moselle who he is supposed to meet, is not in sight. Schnaebelé wonders if Gautsch has reneged on the meeting. Schnaebelé is waiting impatiently, a few steps from the German side. Suddenly, a man in a gray blouse appears from the German side, hails Schnaebelé, then rushes at him, trying to lead him into Germany. Schnaebelé successfully resists but then a second man in a gray blouse appears. Returning a few steps into French territory, Schnaebelé exclaims (in German): [...] "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>from</b> <b>me?</b> I'm Guillaume Schnaebele Commissioner Special Pagny. I am here at home! This is the border." [...] His two attackers do not listen and continue to grapple him across the border. The two French farmers do not intervene, but the six German rail workers on hearing the cries for help come into view. But what they see deters action: the two assailants remove their blouses and are shown to be wearing uniforms of the German police. Everything is then perfectly clear. They handcuff Schnaebelé by the wrist and lead him on foot to the village of Novéant and then by train to Metz. There he is thrown into prison and held incommunicado.|$|E
