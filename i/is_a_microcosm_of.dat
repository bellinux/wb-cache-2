5|$|Jim Martin, {{positioned}} {{in the lower}} right, gives a coy and perhaps mischievous glance back at the viewer. He <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>microcosm</b> <b>of</b> the entire scene in which no one appears to be giving thanks in a traditional manner of a Thanksgiving dinner. Solomon finds it a departure from previous depictions of Thanksgiving in that the participants do not lower their heads or raise their hands in the traditional poses of prayer. She sees it {{as an example of}} treating American traditions in both sanctified and casual ways. Theologian David Brown sees gratitude as implicit in the painting, while Kenneth Bendiner writes that Rockwell was mindful of the Last Supper and that the painting's perspective echoes its rendition by Tintoretto.|$|E
5|$|There {{was much}} consternation {{when it was}} {{demolished}} in 1989, after Mayor Richard M. Daley approved its demolition to erect a multi-use skyscraper with retail, hotel, office, and residential spaces. The McCarthy Building, a Chicago Landmark, was even stripped of landmark status over the objection of preservationists and public interest groups {{in order for the}} block to be cleared. Due to Block 37's central location in the Loop, between the State Street retail district, the city/county government complex, and the Randolph Street theater district, its history <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>microcosm</b> <b>of</b> the city's history. Block 37 was a nearly vacant city block from 1989 until 2005 after several attempts at redevelopment failed due to Chicago politics and insufficient funding of several past developers. The single remaining building from the pre-1989 Block 37 architecture is an active Commonwealth Edison transformer building that distributes power to a great portion of the Loop.|$|E
25|$|The city of Kollam <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>microcosm</b> <b>of</b> Kerala {{state and}} its {{residents}} belong to varied religious, ethnic and linguistic groups. There are so many ancient temples, centuries-old churches and mosques {{in the city and}} it's suburbs.|$|E
50|$|His losing 19-strikeout effort {{against the}} Mets <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>microcosm</b> <b>of</b> his career against them. While he posted 30 wins against them during his career, they bested him 36 times.|$|R
50|$|The {{brothers}} encounter numerous difficulties {{on their}} journey that strain their relationship even further, but the difficulties they encounter {{force them to}} find common ground in the interests of getting themselves to the border on time. The obstacles they encounter <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>microcosm</b> <b>of</b> some of the contemporaneous social and economic problems that face Bolivians.|$|R
50|$|Commanded by John Stewart, {{a rancher}} turned militia officer from the Fort Macleod area, the Rocky Mountain Rangers <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>microcosm</b> <b>of</b> local citizens, stockmen, trappers, {{politicians}} and discharged Mounties hammered into an irregular cavalry unit.|$|R
25|$|The Olmstead Street Historic District {{is located}} along two blocks of that street in Cohoes, New York, United States. It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>microcosm</b> <b>of</b> the city's economy {{at its peak}} in the mid- to late 19th century, {{consisting}} of a former textile mill complex, a filled-in section of the original Erie Canal, and three long blocks of row houses built for the millworkers.|$|E
25|$|In the film, Max {{periodically}} plays Go {{with his}} mentor, Sol. This game has historically stimulated {{the study of}} mathematics and features a simple set of rules that results in a complex game strategy. The two characters each use the game {{as a model for}} their view of the universe; Sol says that the game <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>microcosm</b> <b>of</b> an extremely complex and chaotic world, while Max asserts its complexity gradually converges toward patterns that can be found.|$|E
25|$|In October 2010, The Forward {{reported}} on {{the current state of}} Jews and the level of antisemitism in Sweden. Henrik Bachner, a writer and {{professor of history at the}} University of Lund, stated that members of the Swedish Riksdag have attended anti-Israel rallies where the Israeli flag was burned while the flags of Hamas and Hezbollah were waved, and the rhetoric was often antisemitic—not just anti-Israel. Charles Small, former director of the Yale University Initiative for the Study of Anti-Semitism, stated that “Sweden <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>microcosm</b> <b>of</b> contemporary anti-Semitism. It’s a form of acquiescence to radical Islam, which is diametrically opposed to everything Sweden stands for.” Per Gudmundson, chief editorial writer for Svenska Dagbladet and well known for his pro-Israeli stance for decades, has sharply criticised politicians who he says offer “weak excuses” for Muslims accused of antisemitic crimes. “Politicians say these kids are poor and oppressed, and we have made them hate. They are, in effect, saying that the behaviour of these kids is in some way our fault.” Much of the anti-semitism in the country has been attributed to the growing Muslim immigrant population.|$|E
5000|$|Heterotopia can <b>be</b> <b>a</b> single real {{place that}} juxtaposes several spaces. <b>A</b> garden can <b>be</b> <b>a</b> heterotopia, if it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> real space meant to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>microcosm</b> <b>of</b> {{different}} environments, with plants {{from around the}} world.|$|R

50|$|The Removalists <b>is</b> <b>a</b> play {{written by}} Australian playwright David Williamson in 1971. The main issues the play {{addresses}} are violence, specifically domestic violence, and {{the abuse of}} power and authority. The story is supposed to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>microcosm</b> <b>of</b> 1970s Australian society.|$|R
500|$|Dhaka ( [...] , [...] or [...] ) is {{the capital}} and largest city of Bangladesh. The name {{of the city was}} spelled as Dacca, which was an anglicisation name until the current {{spelling}} was adopted in 1983 to match with Bengali pronunciation. Located in an eponymous district and division, it lies along the east bank of the Buriganga River {{in the heart of the}} Bengal delta. The city <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>microcosm</b> <b>of</b> the entire country, with diverse religious and ethnic communities. Dhaka is the economic, cultural and political center of Bangladesh. [...] It is a major financial center of South Asia. It is one of the world's most populated cities and within OIC countries, with a population of 18.89 million people in the Greater Dhaka Area., It is also the 4th most densely populated city in the world.|$|E
500|$|Despite his influence, Patiño is {{frequently}} {{the victim of}} the Supreme's abuse, even having his own death sentence dictated to him, although in the end he outlives his master. González Echevarría questions whether Patiño [...] " [...] the last laugh? Did he achieve some sort of posthumous power?" [...] This is suggested both because he outlived Dr. Francia, and also because the pen ostensibly used to write the book was given to the author by Patiño's descendant. Therefore, [...] "the editor, who arranges the various texts and annotates them, who thereby exercises final authority over Dr. Francia's versions of himself, is the heir of Policarpo Patiño." [...] The power relationship between the Supreme and his secretary <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>microcosm</b> <b>of</b> the book as a whole, with Dr. Francia dominating Patiño completely, even though the latter is intimately associated with the dictator having power at all, given the power he derives from writing.|$|E
500|$|Presley was {{a central}} figure in the {{development}} of rockabilly, according to music historians. Katherine Charlton even calls him [...] "rockabilly's originator", though Carl Perkins has explicitly stated that [...] " [...] Phillips, Elvis, and I didn't create rockabilly." [...] and, according to Michael Campbell, [...] "Bill Haley recorded the first big rockabilly hit." [...] "It had been there for quite a while", says Scotty Moore. [...] "Carl Perkins was doing basically the same sort of thing up around Jackson, and I know for a fact Jerry Lee Lewis had been playing that kind of music ever since he was ten years old." [...] However, [...] "Rockabilly crystallized into a recognizable style in 1954 with Elvis Presley's first release, on the Sun label", writes Craig Morrison. Paul Friedlander describes the defining elements of rockabilly, which he similarly characterizes as [...] "essentially... an Elvis Presley construction": [...] "the raw, emotive, and slurred vocal style and emphasis on rhythmic feeling [...] the blues with the string band and strummed rhythm guitar [...] country". In [...] "That's All Right", the Presley trio's first record, Scotty Moore's guitar solo, [...] "a combination of Merle Travis–style country finger-picking, double-stop slides from acoustic boogie, and blues-based bent-note, single-string work, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>microcosm</b> <b>of</b> this fusion." ...|$|E
50|$|Birdwatching {{and fishing}} are both popular {{recreational}} {{uses of the}} park. SLSP has four distinct habitats: bottomland woods; restored coastal prairie; open water and marsh of the lake; and cypress swamp.

50|$|Sagaing, {{like its}} bigger cousin Pinya, <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>microcosm</b> <b>of</b> the fractious small kingdoms period (1287-1555). The small kingdom is remembered in Burmese {{history as the}} polity {{that gave birth to}} Ava, the {{dominant}} power of Upper Myanmar from the 14th to 16th centuries.|$|R
50|$|In an {{editorial}} {{published in the}} London Daily News, Hugh Martin argued that Tralee <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>microcosm</b> <b>of</b> what <b>was</b> happening in Ireland as a whole; the IRA struck, Crown security forces violently retaliated against the entire local population, {{and support for the}} IRA was even more firmly cemented throughout the surrounding district.|$|R
2500|$|Authentic (also closed, {{standard}} or perfect) cadence: V to I (or V–I). A seventh {{above the}} root is often added to create V7. [...] The Harvard Concise Dictionary of Music and Musicians says, [...] "This cadence <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>microcosm</b> <b>of</b> the tonal system, {{and is the}} most direct means of establishing a pitch as tonic. It is virtually obligatory as the final structural cadence of a tonal work". The phrase perfect cadence is sometimes used as a synonym for authentic cadence, but can also have a more precise meaning depending on the chord voicing: ...|$|E

2500|$|Monterey Park <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>microcosm</b> <b>of</b> {{changing}} demographics, highlighting Asian American {{history and}} {{evolution in the}} San Gabriel Valley. [...] Rosemead has a smaller group of Vietnamese and Chinese business districts. [...] There are also small pockets of Chinese American businesses that are scattered throughout San Gabriel Valley cities. [...] In Rowland Heights, a handful of Korean American strip malls co-exist with Chinese American businesses. [...] Another ethnic enclave is the Filipino American business district of Little Manila, in West Covina along with an Asian indoor and outdoor shopping center. [...] Small Chinatowns {{have sprung up in}} many cities throughout the valley.|$|E

50|$|Texas {{had about}} 20,000 German Americans in the 1850s. They did not form a uniform bloc, but were highly diverse and drew from {{geographic}} areas and {{all sectors of}} European society, except that very few aristocrats or upper middle class businessmen arrived. In this regard, Texas Germania <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>microcosm</b> <b>of</b> the Germania nationwide.|$|R
50|$|The Figueroa Hotel {{was built}} {{directly}} {{across the street from the}} Friday Morning Club in 1925. It was also financed and run by women, to meet the needs of business, professional, and traveling women in Los Angeles.

2500|$|The {{culture of}} Belfast, {{much like the}} city, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>microcosm</b> <b>of</b> the culture of Northern Ireland. Hilary McGrady, chief {{executive}} of Imagine Belfast, claimed that [...] "Belfast has begun a social, economic and cultural transformation {{that has the potential}} to reverberate across Europe." [...] Belfast is split between two distinct vibrant cultural communities simply described as Catholic and Protestant both of which have made their own contributions to the city's culture. Throughout the troubles, Belfast continued to express itself through art and music. Today, it has a growing international cultural reputation as both communities move into the future and prove the relevance of art in education and healthcare environments as well as using it to heal the divisions of the past and promote social growth for the future.|$|E
2500|$|... "Morrowland", {{where the}} story begins, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>microcosm</b> <b>of</b> early modern society, with a king, a burgher, a merchant, and a worker. The novel and its sequel take place roughly in the 20th century, but have anachronistic elements. China {{is still an}} empire, Native American Indians and Eskimos still live in {{traditional}} ways, yet there are ocean liners, telephones, a postal service, chewing gum and other modern conveniences. There are many fictional locations, like the [...] "Crown of the World", a vast mountain range coloured in red and white stripes, and the [...] "Magnetic Cliffs". Some locations are based on real places, such as the Himalayas, and legendary ones, such as the magnetic cliffs in the Voyages of Sinbad the Sailor and a beautiful abandoned city under the sea, patterned after Atlantis. China is depicted in a phantasmic way; in later German editions, the country name was changed to Mandala.|$|E

[...] Judith Popinski, and 86-year-old Holocaust survivor, stated that she is no longer invited to schools that have a large Muslim presence to tell her story of surviving the Holocaust. Popinski, who found refuge in Malmö in 1945, stated that, until recently, she told her story in Malmö schools as part of their Holocaust studies program, but that now, many schools no longer ask Holocaust survivors to tell their stories, because Muslim students treat them with such disrespect, either ignoring the speakers or walking out of the class. She further stated, [...] "Malmö reminds me of the anti-Semitism I felt as a child in Poland before the war. [...] "I am not safe as a Jew in Sweden anymore." ...|$|E

50|$|Pinya <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>microcosm</b> <b>of</b> {{the small}} kingdoms period (1287-1555) of Burmese history. Weakened by {{internal}} divisions, Pinya despite controlling {{two of the}} three main granaries never reached its potential. Although its successor Ava would prove more successful in reassembling major parts of the erstwhile empire, it too would be hampered by fierce regional rivalries, and Myanmar would remain divided into the mid-16th century.|$|R
60|$|It {{is because}} I {{have come in}} touch with a {{prolonged}} though perfectly finite existence of the sort, that I try to pass on the reflections which the fact of it awoke in me. There are other reflections connected with Yva and the marvel of her love and its various manifestations which arise also. But these I keep to myself. They concern the wonder of woman's heart, which <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>microcosm</b> <b>of</b> the hopes and fears and desires and despairs of this humanity of ours whereof from age to age she is the mother.|$|E
