5|$|After {{the ride}} was renovated in 1990, a new space theme was given. The {{story of the}} ride was the {{passengers}} had been to deliver cargo from a suborbital factory to a station in Alaska. Large screen projections, simulated lasers, mist, and recordings {{were added to the}} ride. In the queue, guests would go through three rooms including Rocket Recovery, Mission Control and Repair Bay. The original <b>entrance</b> to the ride was located next to Troika. During HalloWeekends, the park would change the <b>entrance</b> of Disaster Transport to under the lift hill, leaving the one next to Troika to be used for the Halloween Haunt. For the 2009 season, the <b>entrance</b> was permanently changed to under the lift hill. When the <b>entrance</b> was changed, the Rocket Recovery and Mission Control rooms were closed, leaving the Repair Bay the only room guests walked through.|$|E
50|$|The {{station has}} {{a total of}} 16 staircase/escalator <b>entrances</b> and 2 {{elevator}} <b>entrances.</b> Full-time <b>entrances</b> are indicated in green, and part-time <b>entrances</b> are indicated in red.|$|R
50|$|<b>Entrances</b> in bold are classed as {{distinct}} caves {{in their own}} right and <b>entrances</b> not in bold are alternative <b>entrances</b> into those caves.|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} into the association between covered burrow <b>entrances</b> and the breeding status of occupants of burrows was prompted when Wedge-tailed Shearwaters were seen covering the <b>entrances</b> to their burrows. The results showed that neither covered nor cleared <b>entrances</b> should {{be used as indicators}} for occupied breeding burrows. Burrows with covered <b>entrances</b> may contain incubating birds, and those with cleared <b>entrances</b> may only be used at night by immature birds. The incidence of burrows with covered <b>entrances</b> was related to habitat type which influenced the availability of litter and debris...|$|R
5|$|Although {{the fishing}} {{industry}} thrived in Christchurch, {{the importance of the}} harbour declined as it became inaccessible to vessels of a large draught. The harbour <b>entrance</b> was particularly troublesome with constantly shifting sandbars. In 1665 Edward Hyde, Earl of Clarendon, bought the Lordship of the Manor of Christchurch. As part of his plans to improve trade in the town, he attempted to resolve the problems with the harbour <b>entrance</b> by cutting a new one through the sandspit at the foot of Hengistbury Head. However, upon completion the new <b>entrance</b> repeatedly silted up and in 1703 a large storm damaged a groyne which blocked the <b>entrance</b> entirely. Over the following 150 years alternative schemes were proposed but none were ever taken up.|$|E
5|$|Before the <b>entrance</b> of the sovereign, {{the litany}} of the saints is sung during the {{procession}} of the clergy and other dignitaries. For the <b>entrance</b> of the monarch, Psalm 122, I was glad, is sung.|$|E
5|$|By 1853 {{a service}} range {{had been added}} to the south wing of the house. In 1868 the {{external}} flight of stairs was removed from the west front and a new porch <b>entrance</b> was added to its ground floor. The <b>entrance</b> featured a Norman doorway that had been moved from elsewhere in the monastery; Greene believes that it probably formed the <b>entrance</b> from the west cloister walk into the nave of the church. An exact replica of this doorway was built and placed {{to the north of the}} Norman doorway, making a double <b>entrance.</b> The whole of the undercroft was radically restored, giving it a Gothic theme, adding stained glass windows and a medieval-style fireplace. The ground to the south of the house was levelled and formal gardens were established.|$|E
50|$|Spring Street {{has four}} <b>entrances,</b> two to each platform. The {{northbound}} <b>entrances</b> are at either western corner of Lafayette and Spring Streets, while the southbound <b>entrances</b> are at either eastern {{corner of the}} same intersection.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Entrances</b> {{and exits}} {{must be made}} either through the audience, making {{surprise}} <b>entrances</b> very difficult, or via closed-off walkways, which must be inconspicuous. As a result, stage <b>entrances</b> are normally {{in the corners of}} the theatre.|$|R
50|$|As {{explained}} before, it {{is possible}} to warp to other zones through the <b>entrances</b> located within each field. Open <b>entrances</b> can be entered directly, but closed <b>entrances</b> need to be opened first by exploding a stick of dynamite before they can be entered.|$|R
5|$|By the mid-1890s {{the station}} <b>entrance</b> had been {{incorporated}} into a larger building. In 1922, a new <b>entrance</b> and canopy was designed for the Bridge Street <b>entrance</b> by Charles Holden and, in 1924, he designed a plainly rendered replacement elevation for the eastern <b>entrance</b> on to the Embankment. These were {{the first of many}} projects by the architect for the London Electric Railway (the main forerunner of London Transport and Transport for London). The station platforms were also refurbished with new wall tiling in the green, blue, black and white tiling scheme used later by Holden on many stations of the period and still visible at neighbouring St James's Park station. In 1949, the Metropolitan line-operated Inner Circle route was given its own identity on the tube map as the Circle line.|$|E
5|$|Each of {{the main}} façade's first- and second-story windows and the <b>entrance</b> are adorned with white wooden label moldings. The main <b>entrance</b> is {{composed}} of a tall double wooden <b>entrance</b> door, with its original handle and locks. Each door consists of four vertical wooden panels. A rectangular transom light of four vertical glass panels tops the main entryway's double wooden doors. Outside the entryway is a spacious brick stoop that is accessed by a cement walkway from West Main Street. Its brick steps {{leading up to the}} stoop were last restored in the late 1970s.|$|E
5|$|<b>Entrance</b> to Lundy is {{free for}} anyone {{arriving}} by scheduled transport.

50|$|The {{ground level}} has five <b>entrances,</b> {{of which the}} centre one was always {{reserved}} for the monarch's use only. The two, slightly smaller, side <b>entrances</b> were reserved for mandarins, soldiers and horses. The two small arched <b>entrances</b> on the side were for the rest and commoners.|$|R
50|$|There {{would also}} be work on roadways to improve traffic in the area. There will be 11 <b>entrances</b> onto the property, 4 <b>entrances</b> from Kanes Lane, 4 <b>entrances</b> from Kings Highway East, and 3 <b>entrances</b> from Highway 35. The plan is to include an {{additional}} lane on the northern side of Highway 35 and provide a double left turn lanes and jug handles to carry traffic across Route 35 at Tindall Road.|$|R
5|$|Hyde Park is a Grade I-registered major park in Central London. It is {{the largest}} of four Royal Parks that form a chain from the <b>entrance</b> of Kensington Palace through Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park, via Hyde Park Corner and Green Park past the main <b>entrance</b> to Buckingham Palace. The park is divided by the Serpentine and the Long Water.|$|E
5|$|In 1825, Brisbane was {{established}} as a penal settlement. In spite of the hazards, the preferred access to Moreton Bay and Brisbane was through the southern <b>entrance,</b> between Moreton Island and North Stradbroke Island, mainly due to shorter shipping route and better shipping conditions. The southern <b>entrance</b> was therefore marked in 1825 and a pilot station {{was established}} at Amity Point on North Stradbroke Island in 1827. Although the northern <b>entrance</b> was considered in the 1830s, it was only with the increased shipping activity due to proclamation of Moreton Bay as a free settlement in 1842 that vessels began to use the northern <b>entrance.</b> Buoys marking the <b>entrance</b> were laid in 1846–1847, and in 1848 the Pilot Station was moved to Bulwer on Moreton island. By then the northern entry was regarded as the main entry.|$|E

5|$|In 1994, the Seattle Symphony {{selected}} a city block adjacent to University Street station, used during tunnel construction for equipment staging and storage, {{as the site}} of their new concert hall. The building, later named Benaroya Hall, required the closure of the station's 2nd Avenue <b>entrance.</b> The <b>entrance</b> was re-opened in 1998, {{at the same time the}} new hall was inaugurated.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, some area {{residents}} {{filed a lawsuit}} in opposition to a proposed <b>entrance</b> at 72nd Street between First and Second Avenues, in front of residential buildings at 320 and 340 East 72nd Street, citing that the <b>entrance</b> would take up space on the sidewalk. Due to vocal community opposition, the MTA non-publicly revised plans for the subway <b>entrance</b> in fall 2007, relocating the planned <b>entrance</b> to {{the southeast corner of}} Second Avenue and 72nd Street.|$|E
5|$|In 2011 PRSA publicized {{accusations that}} O'Dwyer had been {{eavesdropping}} on PRSA's conference calls. Later that year PRSA started refusing O'Dwyer <b>entrance</b> to their events {{and sent a}} 23-page letter to O'Dwyer describing his behavior as disruptive and unethical.

5|$|In April2006, the Navy {{commenced}} {{construction on}} an <b>entrance</b> to the Naval Air Station from {{the intersection of}} Third Street and Alameda Boulevard. The new <b>entrance</b> was completed in July2007, and the existing <b>entrance</b> and exit on Fourth Street was made an exit-only station. Before then, traffic entering the base had to continue southwest on Alameda Boulevard, making a left on Fourth Street. This change was expected to reduce congestion in downtown Coronado.|$|E
5|$|In May 2017, {{all three}} {{escalators}} in <b>Entrance</b> 1 were damaged by sprinklers activated by faulty sensors, causing the entire <b>entrance</b> to be shuttered indefinitely.|$|E

40|$|This thesis aims {{to discuss}} the role of {{different}} <b>entrances</b> leading to the Palatine hill {{during the reign of}} emperor Septimius Severus and the Severan Period. As the palace itself occupied most of the Palatine, the <b>entrances</b> that lead up the Palatine hill {{can be seen as the}} <b>entrances</b> into the palace itself. This thesis will give a short and general outline on the Palatine hill and the Imperial palace, will look at the life of emperor Septimius Severus, his rise to power and the following building plan for the city of Rome, including the construction of one of the <b>entrances,</b> the Septizodium. The two other <b>entrances</b> that are discussed are the Domus Gai, a palace build by emperor Caligula and the Clivus Palatinus, an ascending street leading up the Palatine Hill. The role of the <b>entrances</b> towards the Imperial palace will be analyzed with the help of Space Syntax and by examining the various parts of the surrounding areas of the Palatine hill, where these <b>entrances</b> lead, which are the Forum Romanum, the Via Sacra area and the cross point of various roads that lead into the city of Rome and the connection with the different roles these areas have with the <b>entrances</b> will be investigated. The gathered information is used to answer the question what the role of the three <b>entrances</b> were that lead to the Imperial palace on the Palatine during the reign of emperor Septimius Severus in the Severan Period...|$|R
