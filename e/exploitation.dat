40|$|After the {{integration}} of our country within the EU have occurred major changes {{in many areas of}} activity and including in the goat breeding sector. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to investigate the evolution and situation of goat breeding sector in Romania in relation with the goat livestock, the number and size of goat <b>exploitations</b> and goat productions. To achieve these objectives we have studied the official statistical data, we calculated the percentage difference between the reference years and we interpreted data obtained. The results showed that the goat livestock has increasing with 135. 6 % in 2010 compared with 2002 and with 80. 1 % compared with 2006. In terms of number and size of goat <b>exploitations,</b> the results showed that in the year 2010 there were 176, 353 <b>exploitations</b> of goat of which 88. 6 % are individual <b>exploitations</b> that have an average number of 2. 4 heads goats per unit and which hold these animals exclusively for self-consumption of family and only 3 % of total <b>exploitations</b> have more than 100 heads, as average size of goat farms existing in the western countries of EU. However, compared with the existing situation in 2002, the number of <b>exploitations</b> in the year 2010 decreased with about 25 %, especially based by reducing of small <b>exploitations,</b> respectively those which are framed in class less than 10 heads...|$|R
40|$|The {{livestock}} determine in {{the population}} consumption of highest nutritive value compared with the crops. The economic opportunity of livestock is determined by their ability to produce lots of meat, while short time. With the increasing requirements for pig meat are also increased demands from production quality. Thus, lean meat (most requested) must come from young animals, fattened. In the Romanian agriculture, growth of pigs is done the traditional production system (individual <b>exploitations</b> that are mostly subsistence), but also in technological systems based on scientific principles (<b>exploitations</b> connected to economic flux), under extension, based on private initiative event. In these latter <b>exploitations,</b> is applied method offered by science management. Breeds of pigs, becoming more efficient, requires specific conditions that may be generated {{by the use of}} technologic management. The specialization of <b>exploitations</b> could contribute to the rationalization of costs; they are to target a specific category of swine. In addition, pig breeders could use the methods of cooperation to form a continuous flux of activities to increase. Deficit current reduction of pig meat can be achieved by creating commercial <b>exploitations,</b> obtain favorable in terms competitiveness and efficiency.

5|$|Since the 17th century, peat {{has been}} cut for fuel for {{domestic}} heating and cooking and it is called turf when so used. The process accelerated as commercial <b>exploitation</b> of bogs grew. In the 1940s, machines for cutting turf were introduced and larger-scale <b>exploitation</b> became possible. In the Republic, this became the responsibility of a semi-state company called Bord na Móna. In addition to domestic uses, commercially extracted turf is used {{in a number of}} industries, especially electricity generation though peat is being combined with biomass for dual-firing electricity generation.|$|E

5|$|Aggressive mimicry {{is a form}} of mimicry {{in which}} predators, parasites or parasitoids share similar signals, using a {{harmless}} model, allowing them to avoid being correctly identified by their prey or host. In its broadest sense, it could include various types of <b>exploitation,</b> as when an orchid exploits a male insect by mimicking a sexually receptive female (see pseudocopulation), but will here be restricted to forms of <b>exploitation</b> involving feeding. An alternative term Peckhamian mimicry (after George and Elizabeth Peckham) has been suggested, but is seldom used. The metaphor of a wolf in sheep's clothing can be used as an analogy, but with the caveat that mimics are not intentionally deceiving their prey. For example, indigenous Australians who dress up as and imitate kangaroos when hunting would not be considered aggressive mimics, nor would a human angler. Treated separately is molecular mimicry, which also shares some similarity; for instance a virus may mimic the molecular properties of its host, allowing it access to its cells.|$|E

5|$|Arctic terns are {{considered}} threatened or {{a species of}} concern in certain states. They are also among the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds applies.

5|$|Arctic terns are {{long-lived}} birds, {{with many}} reaching fifteen to {{thirty years of}} age. They eat mainly fish and small marine invertebrates.

5|$|As {{fish stocks}} dwindle {{in the upper}} ocean, deep-sea {{fisheries}} are increasingly being targeted for <b>exploitation.</b> Because deep sea fish are long-lived and slow growing, these deep-sea fisheries are not thought to be sustainable {{in the long term}} given current management practices. Changes in primary production in the photic zone are expected to alter the standing stocks in the food-limited aphotic zone.|$|E
