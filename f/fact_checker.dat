2500|$|During {{the summer}} of 2012, Reid said during an {{interview}} with The Huffington Post that he had received information from an unidentified investor in Bain Capital that presumptive Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney did not pay any taxes for 10 years. The accusation was repeated on the Senate floor by Reid on August 2, 2012.

[...] PolitiFact.com's Truth-O-Meter rated the accusation as [...] "Pants on Fire!" [...] The Washington Post's <b>Fact</b> <b>Checker</b> gave it [...] "Four Pinnocchios".

2500|$|At {{around that}} time, Fondane {{began work on}} the poetry cycle Priveliști ("Sights" [...] or [...] "Panoramas", {{finished}} in 1923). In 1918, {{he became one of}} the contributors to the magazine Chemarea, published in Iași by the leftist journalist N. D. Cocea, with help from Symbolist writer Ion Vinea. In the political climate marked by the Peace of Bucharest and Romania's remilitarization, Fondane used Cocea's publication to protest against the arrest of Arghezi, who had been accused of collaborationism with the Central Powers. In this context, Fondane spoke of Arghezi as being [...] "Romania's greatest contemporary poet" [...] (a verdict which was later to be approved of by mainstream critics). According to one account, Fondane also worked briefly as a <b>fact</b> <b>checker</b> for Arena, a periodical managed by Vinea and N. Porsenna. His time with Chemarea also resulted in the publication of his Biblical-themed short story Tăgăduința lui Petru ("Peter's Denial").

2500|$|Romney's {{energy plan}} that was {{unveiled}} in August 2012 would maintain subsidies for oil companies, which Romney's rival for the presidency, Obama, would eliminate. During the 2008 presidential campaign, in November 2007 {{when all of}} the Democratic presidential candidates were calling for eliminating billions of dollars of tax breaks for oil companies, Romney told the New York Times, [...] "Now is not the right time to raise taxes on our oil companies." [...] Throughout most of the 2012 presidential campaign, Romney himself made almost no public statements directly commenting on tax breaks for oil and gas companies; and the Romney campaign declined to respond to repeated requests from the Tampa Bay Times Politifact and The Washington Post's <b>Fact</b> <b>Checker</b> to clarify his position. However, he did tell a town hall gathering in April 2012 that, in contrast to Obama, {{he did not want to}} raise taxes on oil companies. Romney's chief energy advisor also testified before Congress twice during the campaign on behalf of the oil and gas industry that Congress should maintain tax benefits for oil and gas producers. During the first presidential debate between Romney and Obama, in October 2012, Romney hinted for the first time that as president he might consider eliminating $2.8 billion in tax breaks for oil and gas producers if Congress would agree to cut the tax rate for all corporations by 30%.|$|E
