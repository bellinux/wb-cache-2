A triple arthrode-sis in combination with a lateral displacement calcaneal osteotomy produced deltoid ligament <b>forces</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> 76 % greater than those seen with the intact tibialis pos-terior tendon (f <. 05).

25|$|The main {{mechanism}} for sorting is {{the arrangement of}} the optical lattice points. As the cell flow through the optical lattice, there are forces due to the particles drag <b>force</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> competing directly with the optical gradient force (See Physics of optical tweezers) from the optical lattice point. By shifting {{the arrangement of the}} optical lattice point, there is a preferred optical path where the optical forces are dominant and biased. With the aid of the flow of the cells, there is a resultant <b>force</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> directed along that preferred optical path. Hence, there is a relationship of the flow rate with the optical gradient force. By adjusting the two forces, one will be able to obtain a good optical sorting efficiency.|$|E

25|$|Newton's law of {{universal}} gravitation states that a particle attracts every other particle {{in the universe}} using a <b>force</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to {{the square of the}} distance between their centers. This is a general physical law derived from empirical observations by what Isaac Newton called inductive reasoning. It is a part of classical mechanics and was formulated in Newton's work Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica ("the Principia"), first published on 5 July 1687. When Newton's book was presented in 1686 to the Royal Society, Robert Hooke made a claim that Newton had obtained the inverse square law from him.|$|E
25|$|The wasps {{within the}} Vespidae family exhibit {{a wide range}} of body sizes, and S. septentrionalis is one of the larger wasps within the family. As a result, they are able to {{generate}} a lift <b>force</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> able to maintain flight in the presence of their large muscle mass. In order for this to occur in the most efficient manner possible, these wasps have enlarged wings and veins that are distally extended. The elongated wings will allow for flying that is more energetically efficient, in order to compensate for their large body size and muscle mass, while the distally-organized veins will prevent bending of the wings, which would result in a loss of energy.|$|E

The Kenyan police outlines the objectives of the GSU as follows: to deal with situations affecting internal security throughout the Republic, to be an operational <b>force</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> not intended for use on duties of a permanent static nature, and primarily, to be a reserve force to deal with special operations and civil disorders.|$|E
25|$|From 1991 to 1995, the Croatian {{police were}} a militarised force, {{charged with the}} role of {{defending}} the country during the secession from Yugoslavia, in addition to their regular police tasks. Military training taught police officers to use firearms before exhausting other procedures, which has affected the philosophy and behaviour of police officers in using excessive force. Significant developments have been made to achieve democratic policing in a modern, professional <b>force</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> also accountable to the public. However, citizen complaints of violent police behaviour suggest that the militarisation of the police force in the early 1990s continues to influence the level of force accepted as legitimate and reasonable by Croatian police officers.|$|E
25|$|During a {{free-fall}} with no aerodynamic forces, {{the object}} accelerates due to gravity, resulting in increasing velocity {{as the object}} descends. During parachuting, animals use the aerodynamic forces on their body to counteract the force or gravity. Any object moving through air experiences a drag <b>force</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> proportion to surface area and to velocity squared, and this force will partially counter the force of gravity, slowing the animal's descent to a safer speed. If this drag is oriented {{at an angle to}} the vertical, the animal's trajectory will gradually become more horizontal, and it will cover horizontal as well as vertical distance. Smaller adjustments can allow turning or other maneuvers. This can allow a parachuting animal to move from a high location on one tree to a lower location on another tree nearby.|$|E

25|$|Between 2009 and 2010, the {{government}} of the autonomous Puntland region in northeastern Somalia enacted a number of reforms and pre-emptive measures as a part of its officially declared anti-piracy campaign. In May 2010, construction also began on a new naval base in the town of Bandar Siyada, located 25km west of Bosaso, the commercial capital of Puntland. These numerous security measures appear to have borne fruit, as many pirates were apprehended in 2010, including a prominent leader. Puntland's security forces also reportedly managed to force out the pirate gangs from their traditional safe havens such as Eyl and Gar'ad, with the pirates now primarily operating from Hobyo, El Danaan and Harardhere in the neighboring Galmudug region. The Puntland Maritime Police Force is a locally recruited, professional maritime security <b>force</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> primarily aimed at fighting piracy off the coast of Somalia.|$|E
