5|$|According to Israeli {{historian}} Shai Lachman, between 1921 and 1935 al-Qassam often {{cooperated with}} Hajj Amin al-Husseini, the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem. They were initially on good terms, and al-Qassam's various official appointments required the mufti's prior consent. <b>He</b> <b>suggests</b> their cooperation increased after the 1929 riots, {{in which one}} source claims al-Qassam's men were active. The two fell out in the mid-1930s, perhaps due to al-Qassam's independent line of activism. In 1933, al-Qassam sent an emissary to al-Husseini, requesting the latter's participation in a revolt against the British. At the time, al-Husseini refused, preferring a political solution.|$|E

5|$|Despite this, the {{defensive}} qualities of Castle Rising {{have since been}} extensively debated. The historian Robert Liddiard argues that the large windows at Castle Rising {{would have been a}} significant weakness, as {{it would have been easy}} to fire arrows through them from the bailey, and George Garnett has questioned the utility of {{the defensive}} arrow slits, which <b>he</b> <b>suggests</b> were not well positioned or designed. The whole site was also overlooked by higher ground, which Liddiard considers would have been a key defensive weakness.|$|E
5|$|Judging by the {{organization}} of other paramount chiefdoms like Coosa and Cofitachequi, Hudson argues that Ocute's power may have extended beyond the core Oconee province. <b>He</b> <b>suggests</b> Ocute's sphere included Ichisi, {{as well as the}} Guale and the unknown chiefdom at the Savannah River headwaters. Ocute and Ichisi were both located on tributaries of the Altamaha River, home to the Guale, and alliances to the north and south would have given Ocute relative parity with their enemies, Cofitachequi. Hudson also entertains the possibility that Toa, perhaps on the Flint River, was included.|$|E
5|$|News {{anchor and}} {{political}} commentator Chris Matthews' show entitled Hardball with Chris Matthews is referenced by Stewie when <b>he</b> <b>suggests</b> Brian {{is getting a}} big head, with the guest, United States Senator Harry Reid, then appearing on Matthews' forehead, suggesting Matthews is self-centered. After Reid continues to interrupt him, however, Matthews cuts to actor Kurtwood Smith, in which Matthews appears on Smith's forehead instead.|$|E

5|$|Ochre is {{reported}} from some early MSA sites, for example at Kapthurin and Twin Rivers, and is common after c. 100 ka. Barham argues {{that even if}} some of this ochre was used in a symbolic, color-related role then this abstraction could not have worked without language. Ochre, <b>he</b> <b>suggests,</b> could be one proxy for {{trying to find the}} emergence of language.|$|E
5|$|Revanta was worshipped as {{guardian}} deity {{of warriors}} and horses, protector from {{the dangers of}} forests and the patron god of hunting. The worship of Revanta is closely associated with Saura, cult of Surya. Often, scriptures like Vishnudharmottara Purana and Kalika Purana recommend worship of Revanta alongside Surya or according to the rituals of Sun worship. Shabha-kalpa-druma records Revanta's worship after Surya's, in the Hindu month of Ashvin by warriors. Nakula, the fourth Pandava, {{is believed to have}} written Ashavashastram on horses. <b>He</b> <b>suggests</b> worship of Raivata to protect horses from ghosts.|$|E
5|$|Roger Sale {{believes}} Andersen {{expressed his}} feelings {{of social and}} sexual inferiority by creating characters that are inferior to their beloveds. The Little Mermaid, for example, has no soul while her human beloved has a soul as his birthright. In “Thumbelina”, Andersen suggests the toad, the beetle, and the mole are Thumbelina’s inferiors and should remain in their places rather than wanting their superior. Sale indicates they are not inferior to Thumbelina but simply different. <b>He</b> <b>suggests</b> that Andersen may have done some damage to the animal world when he colored his animal characters with his own feelings of inferiority.|$|E

50|$|In 1801, James Anderson {{criticized the}} French for basing the Metric system on decimal arithmetic. <b>He</b> <b>suggested</b> base 8, {{for which he}} coined the term octal. His work was {{intended}} as recreational mathematics, but <b>he</b> <b>suggested</b> a purely octal system of weights and measures and observed that the existing system of English units was already, to a remarkable extent, an octal system.|$|R
50|$|In 1967 Scottish {{engineer}} Alexander Thom suggested {{borderline case}} alignments at the Hurlers. <b>He</b> <b>suggested</b> two solar alignments of four stones with far uprights. <b>He</b> <b>suggested</b> two stone-to-site alignments with Vega and Arcturus {{and two other}} site-to-site alignments with Arcturus. Each stellar alignment was given with tabulated declinations at a date some time in between the range of 2100 to 1500 BC.|$|R
5|$|The best decade for January movies, Burr writes, {{may well}} have been the 1940s. It began with what <b>he</b> <b>suggests</b> was best January in cinema history. The Grapes of Wrath, His Girl Friday and The Shop Around the Corner, all {{considered}} classics, were released in January 1940. Later in the decade, other classic films would first reach screens during January, such as Sullivan's Travels, Shadow of a Doubt and The Treasure of the Sierra Madre.|$|E
5|$|The {{reasons for}} the {{disguise}} are unknown. Hingley notes that many contemporary publications attempted to suggest women had {{played a role in}} their creation, perhaps to make them sound less threatening. <b>He</b> <b>suggests</b> that anonymity might have been necessary to protect Bloxam's position at Rugby, but notes Rugby was quite progressive, which makes this unlikely; and, finally, suggests modesty as a possibility. Ian Ridpath, noting the plagiarism of the art from A Celestial Atlas, suggests that this alone might be sufficient to cause the author to wish to remain anonymous.|$|E
5|$|A {{series of}} {{innovations}} {{have been documented}} by 170–160,000 {{years ago at the}} site of Pinnacle Point 13B on the southern Cape coast of South Africa. This includes the oldest confirmed evidence for the utilization of ochre and marine resources in the form of shellfish exploitation for food. Based on his analysis of the MSA bovid assemblage at Klasies, Milo reports MSA people were formidable hunters and that their social behavior patterns approached those of modern humans. Deacon maintains that the management of plant food resources through deliberate burning of the veld to encourage the growth of plants with corms or tubers in the southern Cape during the Howiesons Poort (c. 70–55 ka) is indicative of modern human behavior. A family basis to foraging groups, color symbolism and the reciprocal exchange of artifacts and the formal organization of living space are, <b>he</b> <b>suggests,</b> further evidence for modernity in the MSA.|$|E
5000|$|In 1953, <b>he</b> <b>suggested</b> that if Winston Churchill doublecrossed the United States, {{the atom}} bomb {{should be used to}} divert the Gulf Stream in order to freeze England. [...] <b>He</b> <b>suggested</b> the same thing two years later in Upper Purgatory, {{claiming}} to have received a letter from William E. Bergin, Adjutant General of the United States, treating the idea seriously (pages 17-18). <b>He</b> also <b>suggested</b> the death of Franklin Delano Roosevelt was due to psychic intervention to prevent America's government from being overrun by Communists.|$|R

5|$|According to Hardorff, {{the theory}} is {{discounted}} by most academics. <b>He</b> <b>suggests</b> that Marquis may have made errors due {{to the use of}} sign language, which, he claims, cannot convey the nuances of language. In his book, Wooden Leg unambiguously relates a tale of mass suicide. He discusses possible causes of the suicides at length. It puzzled him because the idea of suicide to avoid capture was unknown to the Indians. Attributing the soldier's suicides to the effects of whisky was a common theory among the Indians, although Wooden Leg believed the prayers of medicine men to have been the cause. Wooden Leg's only taste of whisky up to the time of the battle had been a mouthful– which he immediately spat out– that he took from a captured bottle. In later life, Wooden Leg changed his mind and subscribed to the whisky theory after experiencing the effects of alcohol first-hand.|$|E
5|$|At this point, Cochrane has {{completed}} {{the first two}} steps introducing his interest-based rights approach; the third is outlining the approach itself as the appropriate means of understanding obligations to animals in political communities. Utilitarianism, as advocated by Peter Singer, is rejected because of its failure to take individuals seriously enough; Cochrane desires an account which takes well-being seriously but is not purely aggregative. This, <b>he</b> <b>suggests,</b> is one based on interest rights. After explicating {{the details of his}} interest-based rights approach, Cochrane defends it against the charge that it would result in an unworkably large number of rights, and that rights approaches are too rationalistic.|$|E
5|$|By 1440 he {{was firmly}} in the king's favour, being made in {{succession}} the first ever English viscount as Viscount Beaumont (1440), possibly because by then Boulogne was effectively lost to him and then granted royal lands in East Anglia, further official positions in royal castles, Lord Great Chamberlain, elected to the Garter and the feudal Viscountcy of Beaumont in France. In 1445 he was made premier viscount, and granted precedence over any other- as-yet unmade- viscounts. These consistent promotions and favouritism {{have been the subject}} of some speculation by historians; John Watts has questioned why he 'attracted such an extraordinary heap of honours and perquisites from the crown in these years.' <b>He</b> <b>suggests</b> that as a major noble in East Anglia- with all the territorial and regional significance that meant- was enough to make him worthy of promotion. Beaumont commissioned a contemporary manuscript on chivalry, Knyghthode and Bataile, an adaption of Vegetius for presentation to the king, and was also a major benefactor of Queens' College, Cambridge which the king had granted by charter to his wife Margaret in 1448.|$|E

5|$|Clement {{argues for}} the {{equality}} of sexes, {{on the grounds that}} salvation is extended to all of mankind equally. Unusually, <b>he</b> <b>suggests</b> that Christ is neither male or female, and that God the Father has both male and female aspects: the eucharist is described as milk from the breast (Christ) of the Father. He is supportive of women playing {{an active role in the}} leadership of the church, and provides a list of women he considers inspirational, which includes both Biblical and Classical Greek figures. It has been suggested that Clement's progressive views on gender as set out in the Paedagogus were influenced by Gnosticism. However, later in the work, he argues against the Gnostics that faith, not esoteric knowledge , is required for salvation. According to Clement, it is through faith in Christ that we are enlightened and come to know God.|$|E
5|$|Clement criticizes Greek paganism in the Protrepticus on {{the basis}} that its deities are both false and poor moral examples, and he attacks the mystery {{religions}} for their obscurantism and trivial rituals. In particular, the worshippers of Dionysus are ridiculed for their ritual use of children's toys. <b>He</b> <b>suggests</b> at some points that the pagan deities are based on humans, but at others that they are misanthropic demons, and he cites several classical sources in support of this second hypothesis. Clement, like many pre-Nicene fathers, writes favourably about Euhemerus and other rationalist philosophers, {{on the grounds that they}} at least saw the flaws in paganism. However, his greatest praise is reserved for Plato, whose apophatic views of God prefigure Christianity.|$|E
5|$|Hadley {{is known}} for his account of animal {{property}} rights theory. He proposes that wild animals be offered property rights over their territories, and that guardians be appointed to represent their interests in decision-making procedures. <b>He</b> <b>suggests</b> that this account could be justified directly, {{on the basis of the}} interests of the animals concerned, or indirectly, so that natural environments are protected. The theory has received discussion in popular and academic contexts, with critical responses from farming groups and mixed responses from moral and political theorists. Hadley has also conducted research on normative issues related to animal rights extremism, the aiding of others and utilitarianism.|$|E
