5|$|Shay {{was found}} dead in a Kansas City hotel room on December 1, 1927. He was found with a gunshot wound to the head. Police {{officials}} initially said that the manner of death could have been either suicide or murder. Shay stayed in his room on the day that he died. A porter went to check on him that evening and found <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> with a pistol a few inches from his right hand. When physicians examined Shay's body, they found that a bullet had entered the right ear and exited the back of the head. Shay had lost the use of his right arm and hand after a stroke. Police said that if Shay were holding the gun in his left hand, {{it would not have been}} easy for him to shoot himself in the right side of the head.|$|E
5|$|Next {{came the}} match between Irwin R. Schyster and Razor Ramon for the Intercontinental Championship, for which Jim Ross and Gorilla Monsoon {{took over the}} {{commentary}} roles. The match began with a brawl between the two, and Ramon got the early advantage. Schyster eventually threw Ramon over the top rope and attacked <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor.</b> I.R.S. kept control of the match for quite a while, applying a reverse chinlock while using the ring ropes for additional leverage. After Ramon escaped the hold, {{he was able to}} perform a fallaway slam on Schyster. He then used an Irish Whip to throw Schyster into the corner, but the match turned around with a ref bump when referee Joey Marella was in the way and was kayfabe knocked unconscious. Shawn Michaels ran to the ring with his fake Intercontinental belt and hit Ramon with it, and Schyster helped revive Marella to count the pinfall. I.R.S. appeared to win the title, but referee Earl Hebner came to the ring and explained the situation to Marella. When Michaels' belt was discovered in the ring, the match was restarted. Ramon simply grabbed Schyster, who was standing on the second turnbuckle celebrating, and performed the Razor's Edge for the victory.|$|E
5|$|The Brindle Tails {{desperately wanted}} Clayton {{out of the}} governor's office. Conveniently, Lieutenant Governor James M. Johnson was a Brindle Tail, so the natural course of action {{was to try to}} get rid of Clayton and let Johnson succeed him. Clayton was well aware of their plans, and when he left the state briefly for New York on {{business}} concerning the Holford Bonds, he informed no one. When Johnson, who was at home some distance from the capital, found out he tried to head to the capital to take control and have Clayton arrested and impeached. He arrived too late. Subsequently, after Johnson made a speech demanding changes in the administration, the Minstrels started to target Johnson. On January 30, 1871, they introduced articles of impeachment in the General Assembly against him. The chief charge was that Johnson, acting as the President of the Senate, had administered the oath of office to Joseph Brooks, who had recently been elected as state senator, and then recognized <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor.</b> Although this was legitimately within his powers as the lieutenant governor to do, he escaped impeachment by only two votes. The scrutiny of the proceedings seriously damaged his reputation, even though he had done nothing wrong, and his political career never recovered.|$|E

5|$|The final Gallup poll {{before the}} {{election}} showed the Liberals ahead, 48% to 34%. Just {{before the election}}, Maclean's magazine printed its regular weekly issue, to go on sale {{the morning after the}} vote, editorializing that democracy in Canada was still strong despite a sixth consecutive Liberal victory. On election night, the Progressive Conservative advance started early, with the gain of two seats in reliably Liberal Newfoundland. The party picked up nine seats in Nova Scotia, five in Quebec, 28 in Ontario, and at least one seat in every other province. The Progressive Conservatives took 112 seats to the Liberals' 105: a plurality, but not a majority. While the Liberals finished some 200,000 votes ahead of the Tories nationally, that margin was mostly wasted in overwhelming victories in safe Quebec seats. St. Laurent could have legally stayed in office until Diefenbaker could defeat <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> of the Commons. However, with the minor parties pledging to cooperate with a Tory government, St. Laurent chose not to do so, making Diefenbaker Prime Minister-designate of Canada.|$|E
5|$|The third {{match on}} the card was a Straight Edge Society pledge vs. hair match, between CM Punk and Rey Mysterio. For this match, the other Straight Edge Society members (Serena and Luke Gallows) were banned from ringside. Early on in the match, Punk threw Mysterio headfirst {{out of the ring}} into the barber chair at ringside. Punk had {{suffered}} a cut to the head prior to the exchange, and while Mysterio was on the floor, the match was halted so that the blood could be cleaned up. While Punk's wound was being attended, he dropkicked Mysterio, who was on the ring apron, and began attacking <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> to restart the match. After Mysterio missed a splash from the top rope, Punk went to pin him, but Mysterio was able to perform a crucifix cradle on Punk for the victory. The other Straight Edge Society members attacked Mysterio after the match, but he was saved by Kane, which allowed Mysterio to handcuff Punk to the ring ropes and shave his head.|$|E
25|$|Nutt {{knew that}} Thumb {{was in love}} with Lavinia. He was jealous. He had a fight with Thumb in a {{dressing}} room at the Museum. He threw <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor,</b> and beat him up. Nutt invited himself along when Lavinia was asked to Barnum's home for a weekend visit. Little did he know that Thumb and his mother would be there, too.|$|E
50|$|Bates' mother, who {{had been}} in the living area at the back of the shop, heard a large bang and found <b>him</b> {{collapsed}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor.</b> Finding <b>him</b> collapsed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor,</b> alone in <b>the</b> shop, she initially believed he had suffered a heart attack or stroke. He was reportedly dead before he reached the city's General Hospital, but it was not until he reached there that it was realised that he had been shot. The bullet had passed through his heart, lungs and liver.|$|R

25|$|On March 20, 2006, Roger Friedman of Fox News {{reported}} that Hayes {{had suffered a}} minor stroke in January. Hayes's spokeswoman, Amy Harnell, denied this, but on October 26, 2006, Hayes himself confirmed that he had suffered a stroke. Hayes was found unresponsive in his home located just east of Memphis on August 10, 2008, ten days before his 66th birthday, {{as reported by the}} Shelby County, Tennessee Sheriff's Department. A Shelby County Sheriff's deputy and an ambulance from Rural Metro responded to his home after three family members found <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> next to a still-operating treadmill. Hayes was taken to Baptist Memorial Hospital in Memphis, where he was pronounced dead at 2:08p.m. The cause of death was not immediately clear, though the area medical examiners later listed a recurrence of stroke as the cause of death. He was buried at Memorial Park Cemetery.|$|E
25|$|At a camp, a British captain asks Mizushima to {{talk down}} {{a group of}} {{soldiers}} who are still fighting on a mountain. He agrees {{to do so and}} is told by the captain that he has 30 minutes to convince them to surrender. At the mountain, he is almost shot by the hold-out soldiers before they realize he is Japanese. He climbs up to the cave and informs their commander that the war has ended and they should surrender. The commander confers with the other soldiers, and they unanimously decide to fight to the end. Mizushima begs for them to surrender but they do nothing. He decides to ask for more time from the British, but when he creates a surrender flag, the others take it the wrong way and believe he is surrendering for them. They beat him unconscious and leave <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor.</b> The cave is bombarded and Mizushima is the only survivor.|$|E
25|$|Two {{months after}} the murder of Steven Tuomi, Dahmer {{encountered}} a 14-year-old Native American male prostitute named James Doxtator; Dahmer lured the youth to his home with an offer of $50 to pose for nude pictures. At Dahmer's West Allis residence, the pair engaged in sexual activity before Dahmer drugged Doxtator and strangled <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> of the cellar. Dahmer left {{the body in the}} cellar for one week before dismembering it in much the same manner as he had with Tuomi. He placed all of Doxtator's remains (excluding the skull) in the trash. He boiled the skull, and initially retained it before pulverizing it. On March 24, 1988, Dahmer met a 22-year-old bisexual man named Richard Guerrero outside a gay bar called The Phoenix. Dahmer lured Guerrero to his grandmother's residence, although the incentive on this occasion was $50 to simply spend the remainder of the night with him; he then drugged Guerrero with sleeping pills and strangled him with a leather strap, with Dahmer then performing oral sex upon the corpse. Guerrero's body was dismembered within 24hours of his murder, with the remains again disposed of in the trash and the skull again retained before being pulverized several months later.|$|E

500|$|Johnson finally {{returned}} to elected office in 1850, {{when he was}} elected to the Kentucky House of Representatives. By this time, however, his physical and mental health was already failing. On November 9, the Louisville Daily Journal reported that [...] "Col. R. M. Johnson is laboring under an attack of dementia, which renders him totally unfit for business. It is painful to see <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> attempting to discharge the duties of a member. He is incapable of properly exercising his physical or mental powers." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the same}} time, DeVeber's {{colleague}} Napoléon Belcourt was championing a similar measure in the Senate (as an Ottawa resident, Belcourt was {{disturbed by the}} effect on the city's water supply by the dumping of waste upstream, in Aylmer, Quebec), and while doing so he quoted extensively from the report of DeVeber's committee. [...] When Belcourt's bill came up for debate, DeVeber scolded <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> of the Senate for misrepresenting the committee's report as being much more supportive of the bill than it actually was; in the estimation of University of Ottawa law professor Jamie Benidickson, DeVeber's comments assured the bill's defeat.|$|E
500|$|The team {{captured}} Eichmann {{near his}} home on Garibaldi Street in San Fernando, Buenos Aires, an industrial community [...] north of the centre of Buenos Aires on 11 May 1960. The agents had arrived in Buenos Aires in April 1960 after Eichmann's identity was confirmed. After observing the suspect's routine for many days, they determined that he arrived home by bus from work at {{around the same time}} every evening. They planned to seize him when he was walking beside an open field from the bus stop to his house. The plan was almost abandoned on the designated day when Eichmann was not present on the bus he usually took home. Finally, almost half an hour late, Eichmann got off a bus. Mossad agent Peter Malkin engaged him, asking him in Spanish if he had a moment. Frightened, Eichmann attempted to leave, but two more Mossad men came to Malkin's aid; the three wrestled Eichmann to the ground and, after a struggle, conducted him to a car where they hid <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> under a blanket.|$|E

500|$|Shortly {{after missing}} out on the program, Rhys finds himself {{performing}} surgery on Chris Pappas (James Mason). Rhys initially treats Chris at the hospital after he is attacked at work by an unknown assailant. Chris refuses to stay for any further medical treatment and later collapses with a punctured lung. Barber said {{that as soon as}} Rhys sees Chris's X-rays, he [...] "goes beyond the call of duty" [...] to find him. The actor explained [...] "When he finds <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor,</b> he knows exactly what's happened, but he isn't sure how long he's been unconscious for. For all he knows, Chris could be dead within the minute— so he goes straight into emergency mode." [...] In a bid to save Chris's life, Rhys performs an emergency procedure to get him breathing again using a screwdriver and a piece of piping. Rhys should not be conducting any type of surgery as he is not a qualified surgeon, but he does not think of the consequences. All About Soap's Laura Morgan said Rhys' [...] "quick thinking" [...] pays off and Chris starts breathing again, but at the hospital Karl warns him he will be held accountable if Chris does not pull through.|$|E

2500|$|The {{family members}} all played music. [...] Mr. Scruggs had played an open back banjo using the frailing technique, though {{as an adult}} Earl had no {{recollection}} of his father's playing. Mrs. Scruggs played the pump organ. Earl's siblings, older brothers Junie and Horace, and older sisters Eula Mae and Ruby, all played banjo and guitar. Scruggs recalls a visit to his uncle's home at age six to hear a blind banjo player named Mack Woolbright, who played a finger picking style and had recorded for Columbia Records. This made an impression on Scruggs, who said, [...] "He'd sit in the rocking chair, and he'd pick some {{and it was just}} amazing. I couldn't imagine — he was the first, what I call a good banjo player." [...] Scruggs then took up the instrument — he was too small to hold it at first and improvised by setting his brother Junie's banjo beside <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor.</b> He moved it around depending on what part of the neck he was playing. [...] After his father's death, Scruggs seemed to take solace in playing music, and when not in school or doing farm chores, spent nearly every spare moment he had practicing. His first radio performance was at age 11 on a talent scout show.|$|E

2500|$|On January 29, 2010, as Original Productions' crews shot footage for season 6 of the Cornelia Marie {{offloading}} C. opilio crab at St. Paul Island, Captain Phil Harris, who {{had earlier}} complained of being excessively tired, {{went to his}} stateroom to retrieve pain medicines and collapsed. Second-year Engineer Steve Ward discovered <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> of his stateroom, conscious but unable to move his left leg or his left hand. Ward immediately got Phil's sons Josh and Jake {{to come to his}} stateroom while he called for paramedics. According to Thom Beers, producer and creator of Deadliest Catch, Harris insisted that the camera crews continue to film him. [...] "We want to remember Phil as who he was," [...] Beers told Zap2it.com writer Kate O'Hare. [...] "We want to remember all the dynamics, {{but at the same time}} the guy was insistent when we were doing this, saying, 'Dude, you've got to. We've got to have an end to the story [...] You want to film this, film this.'" [...] Beers said he honored Harris' wishes and continued to shoot as Harris was airlifted to Anchorage, Alaska, where doctors performed emergency brain surgery to relieve the pressure building up in the cranial vault and avoid further brain damage. Harris spent eleven days in ICU before succumbing to complications from his stroke on February 9, 2010.|$|E
2500|$|McCreight {{became friends}} with many Native Americans and Chief Wa-na-ta (Waanatan II) visited McCreight’s office {{regularly}} to smoke tobacco. [...] McCreight {{was impressed with the}} old chief’s dignity and bearing. “One day he signed that he wished a private interview, when he drew from his blanket a package which he exhibited as something he held more precious than any other treasure. [...] It was carefully wrapped in old newspaper, and after it had been divested of the strings and unrolled to be read, it proved to be the parchment or treaty with Government officials, his own name inscribed as head or Grand Chief. [...] Having thus established his old-day tribal office, he carefully refolded the document, wrapped it in the faded news sheet and returned it to the inner folds of his blanket, then nimbly squatted on the office floor, filled his pipe and enjoyed his usual half-hour smoke.” Chief Wa-na-ta’s smoking pipe was his most precious possession. “A titled English ranch-owner who knew of his importance in history offered any price that the old chief would name for the pipe and pouch, but the chief disdained to listen to any offer of money. [...] But when I squatted beside <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor,</b> where he was puffing meditatively on his long red-stone pipe, to tell him of leaving next week for a trip west, he arose instantly, untied his belt, laid both pouch and pipe across his left hand and extended it to me as a present and token to be preserved after he had passed to the long sleep.” [...] McCreight forever remembered the kindness and generosity of Chief Wa-na-ta.|$|E

[...] It was revealed Kat would reveal the identity of her lover during an episode in which Kat and Alfie argue, Alfie attacks {{one of the suspects}} and Kat shouts that he has the wrong brother. An EastEnders source told the Daily Star: [...] "It's the question that has been on everyone's lips for months—who is Kat's secret lover? The big revelation was always {{going to be in the}} Queen Vic in front of everyone and it will not disappoint. Jessie [...] and Shane [...] are both brilliant and this is one episode viewers will not want to miss. Alfie goes for one of the Branning brothers as he is convinced it's him who's been sleeping with his wife. Kat storms through the pub as he's got <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> and reveals the truth.

[...] The source added, [...] "Sadly it doesn't look like [...] be able to get over this one." [...] EastEnders confirmed that viewers would discover the identity of Kat's lover in the episode broadcast on 20 December 2012. Daniel Kilkelly from Digital Spy said it would be a [...] "dramatic climax" [...] to the storyline. On being told who Kat's lover is, Richie said he understood and found it clever, though he had previously thought it would be Michael or Ray. Richie told Radio Times that Alfie is still in denial about the affair but becomes Kat's [...] "stalker", following her to the bedsit.
