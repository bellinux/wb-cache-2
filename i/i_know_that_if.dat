25|$|Khalil Gibran's The Prophet is a {{book that}} has touched many people very deeply since its {{publishing}} in 1923. It has been translated into more than twenty languages, and the American edition alone {{has sold more than}} four million copies. It is considered both by Gibran himself, and by the general public to be his literary masterpiece. The Prophet is about a man who is leaving a small town called Orphalese where he has made his home for the past twelve years. He has, for that time period, been waiting for a boat to take him back to the land of his youth. We are not told where that land is, only that he has been waiting to return there for twelve years. The entire book occurs on the date of his departure. As he is about to leave, the townsfolk stop him in the town and request that he tell them about certain things. He talks to them about life's lessons and imparts his wisdom to them. He is asked about giving, and he tells the people to give without recognition, because their reward is their own joy. He also talks about things like marriage, work, friendship and also love. He speaks about each, and more, describing the way that people should deal with each issue. This book is an interesting book. It is ninety-three pages of life's lessons set down in writing. These are words to live by, and tell others to live by. This book is certainly a book that everyone should read. Even if people don't agree with some of the beliefs, they should still read the book, if only to get their mind thinking about life, and its many quandaries from a different perspective. This book is not unlike the musings of an aging man imparting his life's lessons to an audience of just about anyone whom he can gather to listen to him. I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Its lessons and stories are wise beyond the ages, and still hold up to be as true today as they were when Gibran wrote them in 1923. The lessons enumerated within this pages are lessons that one would hope were followed by the general population, and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> more people read this book, then {{the world as a whole}} might become a more easily survivable place.|$|E

In September 2009, Rabbi Shmuley Boteach released a book based on taped conversations he had with Jackson in 2001. It included Jackson's thoughts on personal relationships in general and specific ones. His romantic feelings for two famous friends were widely cited in the media; {{when asked if he}} got jealous when his long-time friend Elizabeth Taylor dated other men, he replied, [...] "Yes and no. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> we ever did anything romantically the press would be so mean and nasty and call us the Odd Couple. It would turn into a circus and that's the pain of it all." ...|$|E
500|$|Holly's {{pregnant}} wife, María Elena, {{learned of}} his death from the reports on television. A widow after only six months of marriage, she suffered a miscarriage shortly after, reportedly due to [...] "psychological trauma". Holly's mother, on hearing the news on the radio at home in Lubbock, Texas, screamed and collapsed. María Elena Holly {{did not attend the}} funeral and has never visited the gravesite. She later said in an interview: [...] "In a way, I blame myself. I was not feeling well when he left. I was two weeks pregnant, and I wanted Buddy to stay with me, but he had scheduled that tour. It was the only time I wasn't with him. And I blame myself because <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> only I had gone along, Buddy never would have gotten into that airplane." ...|$|E

500|$|One of the {{consequences}} of all the uncertainty behind the scenes was Chrissie's final fate, which was left largely unresolved. Oberman revealed in July 2009 that originally there were plans for a trial, but that poor timing ultimately shelved the storyline. She recalled how the storyline [...] "was put on hold {{and then there was a}} whole different team involved after that. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> they couldn't get me, Michelle and Kim together, [...] And I'd moved straight on to Doctor Who, too. Nobody was available until the following year, by which point Michelle was in Bionic Woman, I was pregnant and Kim was in Cabaret." [...] Because of this [...] "I never felt it was finished off and I would have loved to have wrapped it up." [...] She went on to declare her desire to return for a proper resolution. [...] "I'd love to finish off Chrissie's storyline because I love the character and I do feel that she was left in limbo. To know what happened to her would be great. Even if she went back to say goodbye or wanted to make peace with Sam. Or maybe we could see her in prison?" ...|$|E
500|$|David Renwick found {{writing the}} fifth series and the 1997 Christmas special [...] "Endgame" [...] difficult, {{and he was}} {{becoming}} increasingly busy with his detective series Jonathan Creek. In early 1998, his concerns appeared in the national press. The Evening Standard quoted him: [...] "I have no new ideas for Victor Meldrew ... <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> I tried to write another series it would be even harder than the Christmas one. I don't want the standard to drop [...] {{there would be no}} point in doing something I didn't believe in." [...] A year later, Renwick agreed to write a final series of One Foot, having found the four-year break after writing the fifth series fruitful. Renwick decided that Victor should die in the final episode because {{he did not want to}} be persuaded to write another series. He cites the final episode of the Only Fools and Horses 1996 Christmas specials [...] "where the fantastic closing scenes of the Trilogy saw the Trotters walking up the Yellow Brick Road, only for them to return a couple of years later". He did not want to be constantly asked by journalists and fans when Victor was coming back to their screens.|$|E
2500|$|President Lincoln {{had a habit}} {{on the eve of}} {{a battle}} of asking how many Ohio men would participate. When someone inquired why, Lincoln remarked, [...] "Because <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> there are many Ohio {{soldiers}} to be engaged, it is probable we will win the battle, for they can be relied upon in such an emergency." ...|$|E

6000|$|I was staggered, but <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> {{he wished}} to delay {{he had a good}} reason for it. So I said, as quietly as I could, [...] "Don't wait more than need be. You <b>know,</b> <b>I</b> am sure, what torture I am in." ...|$|R
2500|$|Allen is {{a strong}} proponent of music education, and since winning Idol, he has become heavily {{involved}} with several charitable organizations that promote music education, including the Music Empowers Foundation and Little Kids Rock. He has stated, [...] "To me, music education is vital to every kid's development, and it can change their lives. [...] <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> I hadn't had access to music programs in school that I wouldn't be where I am today." [...] For his support of music education in schools, Allen was honored by Little Kids Rock in October 2010. In November 2011, Allen {{announced that he would}} be growing a mustache for four weeks to give his fans an incentive to support DonorsChoose and Music Empowers in their efforts to promote music education in public schools. This campaign {{played a major role in}} the raising of $80,000 by Music Empowers for music education programs as more than 50% of the donations came from Allen's fans.|$|E
2500|$|However, as Powell explained, Tricia's secret did {{not stay}} hidden for long. [...] "It's truly awful. It comes out because Mark is sorting out Frank's life {{insurance}} {{and the insurance}} company wants {{to see all of}} his medical notes. Tricia is nervous that Mark will find Frank had a paternity test, so she gets all his records and gives them to Mark in a sealed envelope. But Mark says he needs to add a cover letter and opens the envelope anyway. Of course he sees Frank took the test and demands to know what's going on. Mark's furious. Tricia runs away and Mark's left to deal with the hideous realisation that Chrissie's not his daughter and that his dad was a rapist. Then to make matters worse, he has to work with Chrissie, pretending everything's normal. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> I were in his shoes, I certainly wouldn't tell her. It doesn't take much imagination to realise how devastating that kind of news would be for Chrissie. Mark loves her and, {{at the end of the}} day, that's all that counts." ...|$|E
