25|$|The runway is {{presently}} being shared between {{the airport and}} the Edwin Andrews Air Base (EAAB). Military jets and aircraft land and depart on this runway. At the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>Runway</b> 09 is the street to Barangay Sta. Maria, and a park. This can be a perfect spot to take pictures for departing and landing aircraft. At {{the end of the}} Runway 27 is San Roque St., which hosts a large public cemetery. It is also a good spot for plane spotting. Each end of the runway has aprons capable of supporting two Boeing 737s. One of the aprons in the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>Runway</b> 9 is being used by the Philippine Air Force. OV-10s, C-130s, and other Air Force and military aircraft are parked there. While the apron at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>Runway</b> 27 is available, but need repairs.|$|E

25|$|August 2, 1985: Delta Air Lines Flight 191, a Lockheed L-1011 on a Fort Lauderdale–Dallas/Fort Worth–Los Angeles route, crashed {{near the}} north <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>runway</b> 17R (now 17C) after encountering a severe {{microburst}} on final approach; the crash killed 8 of 11 crew members, 128 of 152 {{passengers on board}} and one person on the ground.|$|E
50|$|Subsequently, the {{aircraft}} hit a strobe {{light at the}} <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the <b>runway</b> and continued to climb with difficulties. At 350 m beyond the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the <b>runway,</b> the landing gear hit and damaged the 1.8 m high localiser antenna array operated by Airservices Australia.

It was also reported that after clearing the airport perimeter, the aircraft cleared a small brick building by only 50 cm.|$|R
50|$|Arriving and departing {{aircraft}} must use a single runway. There is low {{prospect of a}} successful go-around on short final due to the terrain.

25|$|On February 17, 2008, a WestJet Boeing 737 from Calgary International Airport {{went off}} the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>runway</b> 07 shortly after landing. None of the 86 {{passengers}} and 6 crew members on board were injured. A slippery runway {{and the lack of}} use of the speed brakes on the aircraft contributed to the accident.|$|E
25|$|May 15, 1953: A Braniff International Airways Douglas DC-4 {{carrying}} 48 {{passengers and}} five crew {{slid off the}} <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>Runway</b> 36, crossed Lemmon Avenue, and plowed into an embankment. Despite reportedly heavy automobile traffic on the busy street, no vehicles were struck, and nobody aboard the airliner was seriously injured. The crash was attributed to poor braking action on the rain-slicked runway.|$|E
25|$|The {{airport is}} also the home of Coast Guard Air Station Clearwater, the largest and busiest U.S. Coast Guard Air Station in the United States, {{operating}} HC-130 Hercules and MH-60T Jayhawk aircraft.

25|$|On Sunday, January 6, 1946, a Pennsylvania Central Airlines Douglas DC-3 (registration NC21786), flying as Flight 105 {{originating}} in New York City with stops in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and Knoxville, Tennessee, crashed {{while attempting to}} make an instrument approach to Runway 18 at Birmingham Municipal Airport (now Birmingham-Shuttlesworth International Airport) in Birmingham, Alabama. The plane crashed into Village Creek at the south <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>runway</b> 18-36. The captain, first officer, and a check airman who occupied the cockpit jump seat perished in the crash; several passengers were injured, none fatally.|$|E
25|$|Flight 426, {{bound for}} Wichita, Kansas, crashed near the {{departure}} <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>runway</b> shortly after takeoff. The aircraft encountered severe windshear {{at an altitude}} and airspeed which precluded recovery to level flight. The aircraft descended at a rate {{which could not be}} overcome even though the aircraft was flown at or near its maximum lift capability throughout the encounter. The windshear was generated by the outflow from a thunderstorm which was over the aircraft's departure path. All passengers and crew were safely evacuated. The aircraft was a total loss.|$|E
25|$|On 19 March 2016, at 3:42 AM local time, Flydubai Flight 981, a Boeing 737-800 on a {{passenger}} flight from Dubai, while executing a go-around, crashed {{at a high}} angle and speed by the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>Runway</b> 22. All 62 people aboard died in the crash. The crash damaged 350 sq.meters of the airport's only runway and destroyed ten runway lights. The airport was closed down for several days for the air crash investigation's field survey and the runway repairment. The circumstances and reasons of the crash are still {{to be determined by}} the Russian Interstate Aviation Committee, with the participation of the airline's specialists and foreign experts, who continue the investigative actions in the airport.|$|E

50|$|The Main Terminal Building was {{operated}} by the Chicago Department of Aviation and contained waiting areas as well as office and counter space. The runway at Meigs Field was nearly 3900 by 150 ft. In addition, there were four public helicopter pads at the south <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the <b>runway,</b> near McCormick Place. The north <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the <b>runway</b> was near the Adler Planetarium.|$|R
25|$|On April 28, 2016, Massport {{approved}} {{funding for}} the installation of a Category IIIb instrument landing system at ORH. The geographic location of the airport, {{on top of the}} tallest hill in the city reaching approximately 1,000 feet above sea level, leaves Worcester on average with 40 more days of fog a year than nearby Boston. The installation of the Category IIIb landing system will allow aircraft to land and depart in virtually all weather conditions. There are no Category IIIc airports in the United States; it is simply not allowed for safety reasons. The installation of the landing system also will include a jug-handle taxiway at the approach <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>Runway</b> 11. Construction has begun and the ILS is expected to be operational sometime in late 2017. Once it is completed, new service with JetBlue Airways will begin to John F. Kennedy International Airport.|$|E
25|$|On July 30, 1971, Pan Am Flight 845, a Boeing 747 (registration: N747PA, name: Clipper America), struck {{navigational aids}} at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>runway</b> 1R on takeoff for Tokyo. The aircraft's landing gear and other systems were damaged. Two {{passengers}} were seriously injured by metal {{components of the}} runway approach light pier entering the cabin. The flight proceeded out over the Pacific Ocean to dump fuel to reduce weight for an emergency landing. Emergency services deployed at the airport, and the plane returned and landed on runway 28R. During landing the aircraft veered off the runway. There was no fire. After coming to a stop, the aircraft slowly tilted aft, coming to rest on its tail in a nose-high attitude. The forward evacuation slides were therefore in a nearly vertical position. Evacuation using these slides caused all of the additional injuries, some severe. There were no fatalities among the 218 passengers and crew members aboard. An investigation determined {{that the cause of}} the accident was erroneous information from the flight dispatcher to the crew members regarding weight and runway length.|$|E
25|$|Twelve {{seconds before}} the plane hit the mountain, named El Diluvio (The Deluge), the Ground Proximity Warning System activated, announcing an {{imminent}} terrain collision and sounding an alarm. Within a second of this warning the first officer disengaged the autopilot, and the captain attempted to climb clear of the mountain; however, neither pilot had remembered to disengage the previously deployed speed brakes, which reduced the rate of climb. At 9:41:28 pm Eastern Standard Time it struck trees at about 8,900 feet MSL {{on the east side}} of the mountain. The crash was six miles south of Tuluá VOR and 28 miles north of the approach <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>runway</b> 19 at Alfonso Bonilla Aragon International Airport. During the investigations, it was found that neither the Boeing fixed-base simulator nor the CDU/FMS simulator could be backdriven with the data obtained directly from the accident airplane's flight data recorder. Because the B-757 flight simulators could not be backdriven during the tests, it could not be determined with precision whether the airplane would have missed the mountain/tree tops if the speedbrakes had been retracted during the escape attempt. However, the final report stated that if the flightcrew had retracted the speedbrakes one second after initiating the escape maneuver, the airplane could have been climbing through a position that was 150 feet above the initial impact point. Because the airplane would have continued to climb and had the potential to increase its rate of climb, it might well have cleared the trees at the top of the mountain.|$|E
