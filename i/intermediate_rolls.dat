50|$|The {{evolution}} to {{the current}} 20-High Cluster Sendzimir Mill from the early 12-High configuration was pioneered by Tadeusz Sendzimir in the early 1930s. The designs for the Sendzimir Mill were perfected and patented by Tadeusz's company T. Sendzimir, Inc. Significant design improvements were made by T. Sendzimir, Inc. including the flexible shaft backing assemblies and segmented idler rolls, as well as tapered edge <b>intermediate</b> <b>rolls</b> with lateral adjust for superior shape control. With advent of Finite Element Analysis technology T. Sendzimir, Inc. iterated the mono-block housing design to create the Zero Crown Housing solution. This reduced the amount of material required for the housing, while creating uniform elastic deformation across the housing during rolling {{in order to maintain}} a better shape profile of the strip.|$|E
50|$|Sendzimir mills {{are known}} for their ability to roll {{extremely}} hard materials to very thin gauges with few, if any, intermediate anneals. They consistently maintain quality aspects that are difficult, if not impossible, to duplicate on other mills. They are capable of consistently holding extremely close gauge tolerances on very wide strip as well as on metals ranging from soft aluminum alloys to stellite and molybdenum. The bearing-saddle-bearing configuration of the back-up rolls transmits the roll separating force {{along the length of the}} work rolls, through the <b>intermediate</b> <b>rolls,</b> to the back-up assemblies, and finally to the rigid mono-block housing. Since the work rolls are supported throughout their length, any mechanical deflection is minimal, and extremely close gauge tolerances can be maintained across the full width of the material being rolled.|$|E

40|$|Shape (or flatness) {{control for}} rolled steel strip is {{becoming}} increasingly important as customer requirements become more stringent. Automatic shape control is now more or less mandatory on all new four-high cold mills, but no comprehensive scheme yet exists on a Sendzimir mill. This {{is due to the}} complexity of the control system design on such a mill, where many more degrees of freedom for control exist than is the case with the four-high mills. The objective of the current work is to develop, from first principles, such a system; including automatic control of the As-U-Roll and first <b>intermediate</b> <b>roll</b> actuators in response to the measured strip shape. This thesis concerns itself primarily with the As-U-Roll control system. The material presented is extremely wide-ranging. Areas covered include the development of original static and dynamic mathematical models of the mill systems, and testing of the plant by data-logging to tune these models. A basic control system philosophy proposed by other workers is modified and developed to suit the practical system requirements and the data provided by the models. The control strategy is tested by comprehensive multivariable simulation studies. Finally, details are given of the practical problems faced when installing the system on the plant. These include problems of manual control inter-action bumpless transfer and integral desaturation. At the time of presentation of the thesis, system commissioning is still in progress and production results are therefore not yet available.

The project consisted of a theoretical calculation of the roll shape that can give the desired change of the strips flatness and practical development and testing of these rolls in the mill.

A matrix for analyzing the rolling process of a Sendzimir mill has been established as well as a software SM 4 SM (Setup Models for Sendzimir Mill) by which the strip edge drop during rolling has been studied using the CEM.

40|$|The {{effect of}} various {{sintering}} {{conditions on the}} phase transformation and critical current density of multifilament Bi- 2223 PIT tapes with AgMg sheaths has been investigated. A two stage sintering process was used comprising a first (HT 1) and second (HT 2) heat treatment with an <b>intermediate</b> <b>roll</b> pass between each stage. The sintering atmosphere during each stage {{was a mixture of}} nitrogen and oxygen with a N/O percentage ratio of either 80 / 20 % (in N 80 / 020 %) or 92. 5 / 7. 5 % (in N 92. 5 / 07. 5 %). It was found that the conversion of 2212 precursor phase to 2223 was significantly influenced by the sintering atmosphere of HT 1. Sintering in N 80 / 020 % tended to produce larger 2223 grains and a higher degree of texturing compared to sintering in N 97. 5 / 07. 5 %. The lower partial pressure of 0 promoted faster and more complete conversion of 2212 and smaller 2223 grain size, however, retained much more 2201 phase. It was observed that conditions of HT 2 had less of an impact on the conversion of 2212 phase but influenced the proportion and size of secondary phases, specially influenced that of the lead-rich secondary phase. A possible explanation for the differences in phase transformation and the effect on the critical current was discussed. Crown Copyright (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Roll {{compaction}} is {{a continuous}} process {{commonly used in}} the pharmaceutical industry for dry granulation of moisture and heat sensitive powder blends. It is intended to increase bulk density and improve flowability. Roll compaction is a complex process that depends on many factors, such as feed powder properties, processing conditions and system layout. Some of the variability in the process remains unexplained. Accordingly, modeling tools are needed to understand the properties and the interrelations between raw materials, process parameters {{and the quality of}} the product. It is important to look at the whole manufacturing chain from raw materials to tablet properties. The main objective of this thesis was to investigate the impact of raw materials, process parameters and system design variations on the quality of <b>intermediate</b> and final <b>roll</b> compaction products, as well as their interrelations. In order to do so, we have conducted a series of systematic experimental studies and utilized chemometric tools, such as design of experiments, latent variable models (i. e. PCA, OPLS and O 2 PLS) as well as mechanistic models based on the rolling theory of granular solids developed by Johanson (1965). More specifically, we have developed a modeling approach to elucidate the influence of different brittle filler qualities of mannitol and dicalcium phosphate and their physical properties (i. e. flowability, particle size and compactability) on intermediate and final product quality. This approach allows the possibility of introducing new fillers without additional experiments, provided that they are within the previously mapped design space. Additionally, this approach is generic and could be extended beyond fillers. Furthermore, in contrast to many other materials, the results revealed that some qualities of the investigated fillers demonstrated improved compactability following roll compaction. In one study, we identified the design space for a roll compaction process using a risk-based approach. The influence of process parameters (i. e. roll force, roll speed, roll gap and milling screen size) on different ribbon, granule and tablet properties was evaluated. In another study, we demonstrated the significant added value of the combination of near-infrared chemical imaging, texture analysis and multivariate methods in the quality assessment of the <b>intermediate</b> and final <b>roll</b> compaction products. Finally, we have also studied the roll compaction of an intermediate drug load formulation at different scales and using roll compactors with different feed screw mechanisms (i. e. horizontal and vertical). The horizontal feed screw roll compactor was also equipped with an instrumented roll technology allowing the measurement of normal stress on ribbon. Ribbon porosity was primarily found to be a function of normal stress, exhibiting a quadratic relationship. A similar quadratic relationship was also observed between roll force and ribbon porosity of the vertically fed roll compactor. A combination of design of experiments, latent variable and mechanistic models led to a better understanding of the critical process parameters and showed that scale up/transfer between equipment is feasible...|$|R
