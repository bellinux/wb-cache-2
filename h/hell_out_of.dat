5|$|When {{you throw}} a {{cat in the}} oven, it's easy to have someone in the {{orchestra}} slam a hammer down on an anvil, scaring the <b>hell</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> everyone. The hard part is manipulating the story and accenting the characters. In the beginning, when Todd is laying down the rules, there's a certain repetitive thematic idea you hear. You hear the same music when Dussander is turning the tables on Todd, which makes you remember the first scene... You hope people are subliminally making the connection that the tables are turning back and forth.|$|E
500|$|The 1917 season {{featured}} Vanderbilt's worst-ever loss, 83–0 to Georgia Tech. McGugin {{never stopped}} keeping his men [...] "up." [...] Before the Alabama game the following week, he shouted to reserve fullback Top Richardson to [...] "hit hard on every play." [...] "Yes, sir!" [...] Richardson replied, [...] "I'll knock <b>hell</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> anyone who comes near this bench!" ...|$|E
500|$|During the 1940s, {{the school}} paper {{described}} Bonfire as [...] "the greatest {{event of the}} football season". The 1947 Corps handbook stated that [...] "bonfire symbolizes two things: a burning desire to beat the team from the University of Texas, and the undying flame of love that every loyal Aggie carries in his heart for the school"; this was often shortened to [...] "the burning desire to beat the <b>hell</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> t.u." ...|$|E

Almost 40 years after its release, it still sells an {{estimated}} 200,000 copies annually, and stayed on the charts for over nine years, {{making it one of the}} best selling albums in history. He is also known for his powerful wide-ranging operatic voice and theatrical live performances.|$|R
500|$|The pessimism {{expressed}} by Phillips and Mecklin surprised Frederick Nolting, who preceded Lodge as the US ambassador in Saigon. Nolting said that Phillips' account [...] "surprised the <b>hell</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> me. I couldn't believe my ears." [...] Nolting asserted that Mecklin was psychologically vulnerable to being brainwashed {{because he had}} recently split with his wife. At the time, Mecklin was living with journalists David Halberstam and Neil Sheehan of The New York Times and UPI respectively. Halberstam and Sheehan both won Pulitzer Prizes and were strident critics of Diệm.|$|E
500|$|Another {{scene in}} which Ottman meshed his editing and {{composing}} duties was when Dussander wakes {{up in the hospital}} with the television show The Jeffersons playing in the background. Ottman explained his intent for the scene, [...] "I used The Jeffersons as this innocuous thing—going between him and the television—so that when he does open his eyes, it scares the <b>hell</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> you... I added this deafening Bartok pizz, which is when all the violins pluck their strings really loud and they create this gnarly, unsettling sound." [...] Ottman recorded the film's score with the Seattle Symphony.|$|E
500|$|I had {{no doubt}} that Barbra would sing the <b>hell</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> 'We're Not Making Love Anymore' – and not just because {{she is one of the}} world's {{greatest}} singers. I began writing the song from the heart during my divorce, and Barbra sang it from heart in the studio. I was not at all shocked when her single immediately hit the Top 10 of the Adult Contemporary charts in 1989 [...] As much as that song means to me – I'm proud and thankful to have co-written it – I'll never be able to hear it without associating it with a sad time in my life.|$|E

500|$|At Sutter's July 2006 {{induction}} to the Hall, Smith {{talked with}} reporters about his chances for election. Like many others, he commented {{that he was}} puzzled {{that he had not}} yet been selected. [...] "This confuses the <b>hell</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> me. But I've always been baffled by it", he said. Smith's candidacy may have been hampered by the number of outstanding relievers on the ballot; Sutter had earned increasing vote totals for nine years before Smith appeared on the ballot, and Gossage—who first appeared on the ballot three years before Smith—has received greater support in each year from 2004 until his induction in 2008.|$|E
500|$|The Return of the King {{was criticized}} for its poor camera placement. [...] "What's {{the use of a}} new {{graphics}} engine and character models when the view is from so far away?" [...] asked Kato. Reed complained about [...] "camera switches which reverse the controls, or worse, completely obscure your viewpoint. On just about every mission the camera switching confuses the <b>hell</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> you." [...] The game's save function was also criticized. Ellis commented that [...] "You can only save after completing a level [...] which is not so good when you're forced to slog through the same sequences over and over again." [...] Critics also complained about the unskippable cut scenes, occasionally unclear objectives and relatively short length.|$|E
500|$|Carter said of {{the casting}} of Nick Chinlund as Pfaster, [...] "I {{thought it was a}} wonderfully creepy villain. The casting of that show was very difficult. We saw many actors, but there was a quality I was looking for and I couldn't put a name on that quality. I finally figured out what it was when Nick came in and he had a kind of {{androgynous}} quality that worked. I thought he looked like Joe College, but he could scare the <b>hell</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> you." [...] Producer Glen Morgan said Chinlund's performance was outstanding. Nutter stated [...] "Nick Chinlund was wonderful to work with. The guy was like putty in my hands. He was great. If you're looking for someone to underline the weirdness and strangeness of the character, he did that." ...|$|E
5000|$|Keith Bergman of Blabbermouth.net awarded Chapter Two {{a rating}} <b>of</b> 7.5 <b>out</b> <b>of</b> 10, a higher score than he awarded to Born in <b>Hell</b> (6.5 <b>out</b> <b>of</b> 10). Bergman praised several guitar riffs {{on the album}} (including [...] "Blackened Sunrise" [...] and [...] "The Hidden Flame") as [...] "flat-out fucking righteous" [...] and claimed that Chapter Two was [...] "a quantum leap over the band's debut, and ... a whole {{different}} beast". However, he did suggest that the album was [...] "an odd mix of styles", and also called it [...] "pretty basic and short".|$|R
60|$|Yes, and {{the time}} came when Warden Atherton grew afraid, {{although}} he still persisted in trying to wring from me the hiding-place of the non- existent dynamite. Toward the last he was badly shaken by Jake Oppenheimer. Oppenheimer was fearless and outspoken. He had passed unbroken through all their prison <b>hells,</b> and <b>out</b> <b>of</b> superior will could beard them to their teeth. Morrell rapped me a full account of the incident. I was unconscious in the jacket at the time.|$|R
5000|$|Jason Birchmeier of Allmusic gave 12 Hits from <b>Hell</b> {{three stars}} <b>out</b> <b>of</b> five, saying [...] "This isn't an {{essential}} item {{and will probably}} appeal mostly to the legions of Misfits fanatics, who will no doubt savor these long-unreleased recordings.

500|$|Of the end result, Spotnitz said [...] "I {{was very}} pleased with the way it was executed, and I {{think it was a good}} mystery. He later wrote that he [...] "liked [...] more as time has gone on." [...] Director Rob Bowman {{admitted}} to being tired and not inspired by the time this episode—the second to last of the season—was produced. This lack of interest later resulted in the episode taking extra time to finish. Bowman later recalled that the most difficult aspect of the episode was filming the climactic human sacrifice scene, if only because of the ceremonial mask featured. He explained, [...] "the mask scared the <b>hell</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> me only because I thought, 'Boy, if I don't shoot this right, it's going to be silly." ...|$|E
500|$|On January 7, 1930, salary {{negotiations}} between the Yankees and Ruth quickly broke down. Having just concluded a three-year contract at an annual salary of $70,000, Ruth promptly rejected both the Yankees' initial proposal of $70,000 for one year and their 'final' offer of two years at seventy-five—the latter figure equalling the annual salary of then US President Herbert Hoover; instead, Ruth demanded at least $85,000 and three years. When asked why {{he thought he was}} [...] "worth more than the President of the United States," [...] Ruth responded: [...] "Say, if I hadn't been sick last summer, I'd have broken <b>hell</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> that home run record! Besides, the President gets a four-year contract. I'm only asking for three." [...] Exactly two months later, a compromise was reached, with Ruth settling for two years at an unprecedented $80,000 per year.|$|E
500|$|Described by her biographer Wes Gehring as [...] "a free-spirited tomboy", {{the young}} Lombard was passionately {{involved}} {{in sports and}} enjoyed watching movies. At Virgil Junior High School, she participated in tennis, volleyball, and swimming, and won trophies for her achievements in athletics. At the age of 12, this hobby unexpectedly landed Lombard her first screen role. While playing baseball with friends, she {{caught the attention of}} the film director Allan Dwan, who later recalled seeing [...] "a cute-looking little tomboy... out there knocking the <b>hell</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the other kids, playing better baseball than they were. And I needed someone of her type for this picture." [...] With the encouragement of her mother, Lombard happily took a small role in the melodrama A Perfect Crime (1921). She was on set for two days, playing the sister of Monte Blue. Dwan later commented, [...] "She ate it up".|$|E
50|$|A {{few months}} later, the yearly supply ship comes ahead of schedule, and looks strange and unusually big on the radar. The lax radar {{operators}} decide {{that there is}} nothing to worry about. The personnel of the base go out to behold the terrible truth: it is a spaceship from <b>Hell,</b> built <b>out</b> <b>of</b> steel, stone, flesh, bone and corruption. The ship's enormous gates open to unleash a rain of demons on the base. Quickly, the entire facility is overrun, and everyone is slain or zombified.|$|R
50|$|Bat <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> <b>Hell</b> is a {{rock musical}} written by Jim Steinman. Steinman wrote {{all of the}} songs, {{many of which were}} {{previously}} recorded by Meat Loaf on the albums Bat <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> <b>Hell</b> and Bat <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> <b>Hell</b> II: Back into Hell. The musical follows Strat, the forever young leader of The Lost who has fallen for Raven, daughter of Falco, the tyrannical ruler of Obsidian.|$|R

500|$|Idlewild South was the band's first {{effort with}} Tom Dowd, {{known for his}} work with Cream and John Coltrane. Dowd first heard the band rehearsing while visiting Capricorn Sound Studios in Macon, asking their name and {{remarking}} to Walden, [...] "Get them the <b>hell</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> there and give them {{to me in the}} studio. They don't need to rehearse; they're ready to record". Dowd was initially scheduled to work with the band on their debut album but was called away at the last minute. Initially, the band had asked friend and colleague Johnny Sandlin to produce their second album, but as recording inched closer, it became obvious they wanted him to co-produce with Dowd. In one of their first sessions, Sandlin was giving suggestions and acting as a co-producer, though no one had informed Dowd; Sandlin was embarrassed and did not return to the studio.|$|E
500|$|... "Never Too Far" [...] {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics. Billboard's Chuck Taylor gave a positive review for the song, {{calling it a}} [...] "shimmering ballad" [...] that showcases the singer [...] excelling at what made her a famous: [...] "singing the <b>hell</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> a straight ahead love song free of gimmicks, gymnastics and self-conscious attempts at targeting any particular demographic"; {{he also said that}} [...] "Never Too Far" [...] would relieve fans that think Carey had been [...] "relying more upon samples and guest vocalists lately than melody and artful performing". Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine called the song another [...] "syrupy-sweet" [...] ballad on the album and that it [...] "harbors over-the-top performances worthy of [...] "Star Search" [...] (more than fitting considering the film's '80s-era rags-to-riches storyline)". Harry Guerin from Raidió Teilifís Éireann wrote that [...] "Never Too Far" [...] showcased [...] "her four octave range but sound roughly like everything else she's committed to tape during her career".|$|E
500|$|She also {{performed}} {{it at the}} 2009 Super Bowl, which {{was held at the}} Pepsi Center in Denver, Colorado. According to Gil Kaufman from MTV, the performance featured [...] "a chair dance, lots of funky wah-wah and screaming guitar solos, and graphics of spinning rims and neon speed gauges on the mega screens". Rihanna performed [...] "Shut Up and Drive" [...] on her three major tours: Good Girl Gone Bad (2007–09), Last Girl on Earth (2010–11) and the Loud Tour (2011). The performances of the song on the Last Girl on Earth and the Loud Tour shows, featured a car present on the stage. In a review of one of the shows from the Loud Tour, Jonathan McCambridge from Belfast Telegraph commented about the performance, [...] "'During Shut Up And Drive', a car appeared from underneath the stage and a number of dancers then proceeded to pretend to batter the <b>hell</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> it for no obvious reason." ...|$|E
5|$|Fleming {{considered}} {{a number of}} titles for the story; his first choice had been The Moonraker, until Noël Coward {{reminded him of a}} novel of the same name by F. Tennyson Jesse. Fleming then considered The Moonraker Secret, The Moonraker Plot, The Inhuman Element, Wide of the Mark, The Infernal Machine, Mondays are <b>Hell</b> and <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> the Clear Sky. George Wren Howard of Jonathan Cape suggested Bond & the Moonraker, The Moonraker Scare and The Moonraker Plan, while his friend, the writer William Plomer, suggested Hell is Here; the final choice of Moonraker was a suggestion by Wren Howard.|$|R

It takes them around 6 hours to get to Iraq. On {{the first day of}} the bombing it worked precisely. Yesterday we were a bit surprised that after 6 hours bombs didn’t start falling. The attacks on Baghdad were much less than two days ago. We found out today in the news that the city of Tikrit got the <b>hell</b> bombed <b>out</b> <b>of</b> it. Today the B52s took off at 3pm, in half an hour we will know whether it is Baghdad tonight or another city." ...|$|R

500|$|... "Ice" [...] {{was also}} {{considered}} one of the best episodes of the first season by the production crew. According to Carter, Morgan and Wong [...] "just outdid themselves on this show, as did director David Nutter, who really works so hard for us. I think they wrote a great script and he did a great job directing it, and we had a great supporting cast". Nutter said: [...] "The real great thing about 'Ice' is {{that we were able to}} convey a strong sense of paranoia. It was also a great ensemble piece. We're dealing with the most basic emotions of each character, ranging from their anger to their ignorance and fear. It established the emotional ties these two characters have with each other, which is very important. Scaring the <b>hell</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the audience was definitely the key to the episode". Anderson said that [...] "it was very intense. There was a lot of fear and paranoia going on. We had some great actors to work with".|$|E
500|$|Affleck {{soon began}} work on his next directorial project, Argo (2012), for Warner Bros. Written by Chris Terrio and {{starring}} Affleck as a CIA operative, the film {{tells the story of}} the CIA plan to save six U.S. diplomats during the 1979 Iran hostage crisis by faking a production for a large-scale science fiction film. Anthony Lane of The New Yorker said the film offered [...] "further proof that we were wrong about Ben Affleck". Peter Travers of Rolling Stone remarked: [...] "Affleck takes the next step in what looks like a major directing career ... He directs the <b>hell</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> it, nailing the quickening pace, the wayward humor, the nerve-frying suspense." [...] A major critical and commercial success, Argo won the Academy Award, Golden Globe Award, and BAFTA Award for Best Picture. The cast won the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast. Affleck himself won the Golden Globe Award, Directors Guild of America Award, and BAFTA Award for Best Director, becoming the first director to win these awards without a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Director.|$|E
500|$|The {{love story}} {{involving}} Kurt and Blaine {{was met with}} critical acclaim, especially {{the events in the}} [...] "Original Song" [...] episode where the characters first kissed. Katie Morgan of Billboard stated, [...] "It sure took them long enough, but we're so glad to finally see Kurt happy." [...] The Boston Herald Mark Perigard wrote, [...] "It was utterly, sweetly romantic, and Criss sold the <b>hell</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the moment. It’s long overdue and it will silence the growing legion of critics out there who were unhappy with the pace of this story and why Kurt always seemed to be stuck in pure misery." [...] Kevin Fallon of The Atlantic thought the kiss was [...] "sweet" [...] and said that he was pleased that it attracted no controversy whatsoever. Semigran praised the interaction between Kurt and Blaine, and characterized the kiss scene as a [...] "sweet, real and, shockingly, un-hyped moment". She went on to commend the acting in the scene, and wrote that both actors [...] "handled it with dignity and honesty".|$|E
5000|$|Spruance {{considered}} for an hour, then refused Mitscher's request. Mitscher's staff was disappointed with Spruance's decision. On the situation, Captain Burke later commented: [...] "We {{knew we were}} going to have <b>hell</b> slugged <b>out</b> <b>of</b> us in the morning. We knew we couldn't reach them. We knew they could reach us." [...] Spruance said [...] "if we were doing something so important that we were attracting the enemy to us, we could afford to let him come—and take care of him when he arrived." [...] This was in stark contrast to the Battle of Midway in 1942, where Spruance advocated immediately attacking even when his own strike force wasn't fully assembled, as neutralizing enemy carriers before they could launch their planes was the key to the survival of his carriers.|$|R

50|$|The {{geologic}} {{history of}} the rocks of Hells Canyon began 300 million years ago with an arc of volcanoes {{that emerged from the}} waters of the Pacific Ocean. Over millions of years, the volcanoes subsided and limestone built up on the underwater platforms. The basins between them were filled with sedimentary rock. Between 130 and 17 million years ago, the ocean plate carrying the volcanoes collided with and became part of the North American continent. A period of volcanic activity followed, and much of the area was covered with floods of basalt lava, which smoothed the topography into a high plateau. The Snake River began carving <b>Hells</b> Canyon <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the plateau about 6 million years ago. Significant canyon-shaping events occurred as recently as 15,000 years ago during a massive outburst flood from Glacial Lake Bonneville in Utah.|$|R
