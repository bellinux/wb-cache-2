25|$|The {{building}} has two mechanical floors between the 8th and 9th floor and two mechanical floors between 51 and the roof level. They {{are known as}} 8A, 8B and 51A, 51B. They are not accessible {{from any of the}} building's passenger elevators and contain <b>HVAC</b> <b>equipment.</b> As a result, the 9thfloor is really the 11thfloor and the 51stfloor is really 53rd. This can be elucidated from the outside of the building or by walking down the stairwell from the 9thfloor or higher. There is also a floor 2A which is inaccessible except from the freight elevators. There are also three floors beneath the IDS called P1, P2, and P3. These are storage levels for tenants and also are connected to the parking ramp below the IDS. Neither 2A, or P's 1, 2, and 3 are counted as actual floors. Half of the space of the complex (floors 9 to 57 of the Tower) is located above the 8th floor and half (including the retail, hotel, and floors 1 to 8 of the Tower and annex building) is located below the 8th floor.|$|E
2500|$|In the United States, heating, ventilation, and air {{conditioning}} (HVAC) systems account for over 25% (4.75 EJ) of the energy used in commercial buildings (50% in northern cities) [...] and nearly half (10.1 EJ) of the energy used in residential buildings. Solar heating, cooling, and ventilation technologies {{can be used to}} offset a portion of this energy. The most popular solar heating technology for heating buildings is the building integrated transpired solar air collection system which connects to the building's <b>HVAC</b> <b>equipment.</b> According to Solar Energy Industries Association over 500,000 m2 (5,000,000 square feet) of these panels are in operation in North America as of 2015.|$|E

40|$|In {{the design}} {{phase of a}} building, many HVAC systems options are {{available}} to satisfy the basic requirements related to its use. The design engineer is responsible for considering various systems and recommending a system that will meet the project goals and perform as desired. In addition, high efficiency requirements are imposed to the <b>HVAC</b> <b>equipments</b> through strong regional regulation such as the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive which requires minimum efficiency of <b>HVAC</b> <b>equipments</b> in the market. In reaction, major improvements {{have been made by}} manufacturers to improve the performance of their systems and meet all these criteria. With the nearly zero energy goal for all newly constructed buildings in Europe after 2020, it seems very likely that the design of the future building should rely on today’s technology to meet these targets. The integration of High Temperature Cooling in buildings can bring a fresh perspective in this context. The study presents the sensitivity analysis of a primary system to chilled water supply temperature for a water cooled chiller with a cooling tower and a free-chilling heat exchanger. It allows a proper assessment {{of the impact of the}} chilled water temperature on the primary system performance. Peer reviewe...|$|R

To {{reduce the cost}} of the {{indoor environment}} of axes metrology is focused on the relation between investment cost for <b>HVAC</b> <b>equipments</b> as well as decreased energy consumption and improved performance of occupants in office building. For this, EP-OP method is applied to collect the data and then TOPSIS method is applied on the collected data which is the technique for order preference by similarities to ideal solution.

TOPSIS analysis is a practical application to verify the collected data. First the initial data is collected with the help of EP-OP method, and then the data collected is analyzed by TOPSIS analysis. After completion of successful TOPSIS analysis, data processing is being done. By using TOPSIS method, energy consumption cost will be decreased up¬-to Rs. 16000 per year of the present investment on the improvement of the indoor air quality and light illumination without any retrofitting and financial investment...|$|R
