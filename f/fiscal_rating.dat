40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} nature of fiscal {{discipline}} under alternative exchange rate regimes. First, it shows in a simple theoretical framework that fiscal agencies under a currency union with a fixed exchange rate can have the largest incentive to overspend or "free-ride" (compared to those under other exchange rate regimes) owing {{to their ability to}} spread the costs of overspending in terms of the inflation tax across both time-given the fixed exchange rate-and space-given the currency union. In contrast, such free-riding behavior does not arise under flexible regimes owing to the immediate inflationary impact of spending. Next, empirically, it shows that fiscal stances in countries with fixed pegs and currency unions regime demonstrate greater free-riding behavior than countries with more flexible regimes in 15 Caribbean countries during 1983 - 2004. <b>Fiscal</b> policy;Exchange rates;Exchange <b>rate</b> regimes;Flexible exchange rates;Currency pegs;exchange <b>rate,</b> <b>fiscal</b> stances, fixed exchange <b>rate,</b> <b>fiscal</b> policies, fiscal discipline, fiscal stance, government spending, fixed exchange rates, exchange rate regime, alternative exchange rate, alternative exchange <b>rate</b> regimes, <b>fiscal</b> incentives, currency unions, budget constraint, fiscal authorities, flexible exchange <b>rate,</b> <b>fiscal</b> performance, fiscal deficits, primary expenditure, fiscal expansion, fiscal agencies, public debt, fixed exchange rate regimes, fixed exchange <b>rate</b> regime, <b>fiscal</b> balances, fiscal revenue, government budget, flexible exchange rate regime, exchange <b>rate</b> arrangements, <b>fiscal</b> behavior, fiscal spending, fiscal revenues, government budget constraint, fiscal profligacy, budget constraints, fiscal outcomes, fiscal balance, flexible exchange <b>rate</b> regimes, <b>fiscal</b> solvency, exchange restrictions, fiscal effort, exchange arrangements, fiscal indiscipline, fixed ? exchange rate, flexible ? exchange rates, floating exchange rate regime, social expenditure, government budget constraints, fiscal imbalances, expansionary fiscal policy, nominal exchange <b>rate,</b> <b>fiscal</b> constraint, fiscal expenditure, intergovernmental fiscal relations, primary fiscal balance, fiscal rules, fiscal efforts, public deficits, fiscal expansions, <b>fiscal</b> sustainability, exchange <b>rate</b> policies, <b>fiscal</b> reforms, expansionary fiscal, budget deficits, intergovernmental fiscal, classification of exchange <b>rate,</b> <b>fiscal</b> transparency, government expenditures, current exchange rate, expenditure growth, de facto exchange rate regime, exchange rate system, prevailing exchange <b>rate,</b> <b>fiscal</b> agents, primary deficit, budget process, <b>fiscal</b> relations, exchange <b>rate</b> stability, floating exchange <b>rate,</b> <b>fiscal</b> constraints...|$|R

40|$|Across {{a sample}} of thirty four {{emerging}} countries, the evidence shows the frequent existence of a pro-cyclical fiscal impulse. However, the scope for countercyclical policy increases with the availability of international reserves as it enhances credibility and mitigates concerns {{about the effect of}} expansionary fiscal policy on the cost of borrowing and debt service. The paper also examines the effectiveness of the fiscal policy in emerging countries in the short- and long-run and its underlying conditions, which {{does not appear to be}} uniform. In some cases, contractionary fiscal policy could stimulate growth in the short-run, if fiscal tightness lowers the cost of borrowing and debt service, and mitigates concerns about debt sustainability. However, an increase in international reserves is evident to mitigate these concerns. On the other hand, high inflation increases concerns about the impact of fiscal spending on inflationary expectations and the cost of borrowing, countering the effectiveness of the fiscal stimulus on output growth in the short-run. Where the debt burden is high, fiscal expansion has a longlasting negative effect on real growth.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{contribute}} further on the twin deficits debate in a developing economy. Design/methodology/approach – The data for Thailand over three decades are used as a case study. Findings – The major findings are: first, a stable, long-run equilibrium relationship between <b>fiscal</b> deficit, interest <b>rate,</b> exchange rate, and current account was found. Second, the causal relationship between the two deficits runs from fiscal deficit to current account deficit. This evidence is supportive of the twin deficits hypothesis. Further econometric analysis reveals that the two financial variables (interest rate and exchange rate) act as intermediating variables – that is an increased fiscal deficit causes interest rate to rise, and this in turn puts pressure on the exchange rate. The appreciation of the domestic currency causes a current account deficit. Originality/value – The paper is of value by showing both direct and indirect channels to uncover the twin deficits phenomena. Based on a persistent profile response, it was found that the adjustment process may take as long as a year to complete.
