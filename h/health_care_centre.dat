It is a service which is provided free of charge by the South African government and as part of the millennium health goals, it is intended that the service should be accessible to the populace and be effectively utilized. OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to investigate the accessibility and utilization of the primary <b>health</b> <b>care</b> services in three community <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>centres</b> in the Tshwane of the Gauteng Province, South Africa. METHODOLOGY: Data were obtained from participants attending three Community <b>Health</b> <b>Care</b> <b>Centres</b> in the Tshwane Region using self-administered structured questionnaires. A document review of the Community <b>Health</b> <b>Care</b> <b>Centres</b> records was conducted to investigate the utilization trends of the services provided and descriptive statistics were used to analyze the data obtained. RESULTS: The results showed that the Community <b>Health</b> <b>Care</b> <b>Centres</b> in the Tshwane Region are accessible to most participants who lived within 5 km of such centres and who traveled 30 minutes or less to the clinic. Using a taxi or walking were found to be the most common means of transport used to gain access to such a clinic. The findings showed that generally, participants were satisfied with the services provided. CONCLUSION: Participants of this study have access to the community <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>centres</b> in the Tshwane Region and there seems to be effective utilization by patients attending them...|$|R
