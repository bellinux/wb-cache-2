The article essentially accused certain members of the French left of <b>being</b> <b>hypocrites</b> (for allegedly tolerating the same kind of racist behavior that they were protesting against), and, as such, it came as a major shock and sparked much controversy.|$|R

A being has life-force, which is consciousness. And that which is conscious, has life-force.|$|R

50|$|Professor György Márkus systematized Marx's {{ideas about}} needs as follows: humans are {{different}} from other animals because their vital activity, work, is mediated {{to the satisfaction of}} needs (an animal who manufactures tools to produce other tools or his/her satisfactors), which makes a <b>human</b> <b>being</b> a universal natural being capable to turn the whole nature into the subject of his/her needs and his/her activity, and develops his/her needs and abilities (essential human forces) and develops himself/herself, a historical-universal being. Work generates the breach of the animal subject-object fusion, thus generating the possibility of human conscience and self-conscience, which tend to universality (the universal conscious <b>being).</b> A <b>human</b> <b>being's</b> conditions as a social being are given by work, but not only by work as {{it is not possible to}} live like a <b>human</b> <b>being</b> without a relationship with others: work is social because <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> work for each other with means and abilities produced by prior generations. <b>Human</b> <b>beings</b> are also free entities able to accomplish, during their lifetime, the objective possibilities generated by social evolution, on the basis of their conscious decisions. Freedom should be understood both in a negative (freedom to decide and to establish relationships) and a positive sense (dominion over natural forces and development of human creativity) of the essential human forces. To sum up, the essential interrelated traits of <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> are: a) work is their vital activity; b) <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> are conscious beings; c) <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> are social beings; d) <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> tend to universality, which manifests in the three previous traits and make <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> natural-historical-universal, social-universal and universal conscious entities, and e) <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> are free.|$|R
