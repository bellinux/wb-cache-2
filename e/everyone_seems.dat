5|$|The video {{starts with}} Jason Wade in the driver's {{seat of a}} car, with {{the other members of}} Lifehouse in the car with him. The traffic is at a stand still in a tunnel, as a swarm of people have {{abandoned}} their vehicles and are walking through. Wade and the band members get out of the car, and begin walking in the opposite direction of the crowd {{to the other side of}} the tunnel. Wade pushes through the people, who are in a rush to get to the entrance of the tunnel and is constantly focused on his destination to get to the end. When he reaches the tunnel's end, he sees the wreckage of a car crash with firefighters and paramedics cleaning up the mess. Wade then sees a girl observing what appears to be herself, dead inside one of the crashed car. He then looks to the left, and sees an old man observing himself, dead on the ground. As Wade looks into the other car, he sees himself, also seemingly dead. Upon this, Wade frantically runs back into the tunnel towards his car. Then he sees himself in the car with the band members, however <b>everyone</b> <b>seems</b> to be frozen as he bangs on the windows. Suddenly Wade is inside the car again, and a police officer comes to the window, motioning him to continue driving, since he is stopped in the middle of the tunnel for no apparent reason.|$|E
25|$|According to Simmel, {{in small}} groups, secrets are less needed because <b>everyone</b> <b>seems</b> {{to be more}} similar. In larger groups secrets are needed {{as a result of}} their heterogeneity. In secret societies, groups are held {{together}} by the need to maintain the secret, a condition that also causes tension because the society relies on its sense of secrecy and exclusion.|$|E
25|$|Finding himself {{seated on}} a couch with Socrates and Agathon, Alcibiades exclaims that Socrates, again, has managed {{to sit next to}} the handsomest man in the room, Agathon, and that he is always doing such things (213c). Socrates asks Agathon to protect him from the jealous rage of Alcibiades, asking Alcibiades to forgive him (213d). Alcibiades says he will never do such a thing (213e). Wondering why <b>everyone</b> <b>seems</b> sober, Alcibiades is {{informed}} of the night's agreement (213e, c); after saying his drunken ramblings should not be placed next to the sober orations of the rest, and that he hopes no one believed a word Socrates said, Alcibiades proposes to offer an encomium to Socrates (214c-e).|$|E

25|$|Leigh Fermor {{translated}} the manuscript The Cretan Runner written by George Psychoundakis, a dispatch runner on Crete during the war, and helped Psychoundakis get his work published. Fermor also wrote a novel, The Violins of Saint-Jacques, which was adapted as an opera by Malcolm Williamson. His friend Lawrence Durrell, in Bitter Lemons (1957), recounts how, during the Cypriot insurgency against continued British rule in 1955, Leigh Fermor visited Durrell's villa in Bellapais, Cyprus: After a splendid dinner {{by the fire}} he starts singing, songs of Crete, Athens, Macedonia. When I go out to refill the ouzo bottle...I find the street completely filled with people listening in utter silence and darkness. <b>Everyone</b> <b>seems</b> struck dumb. 'What is it?' I say, catching sight of Frangos. 'Never have I heard of Englishmen singing Greek songs like this!' Their reverent amazement is touching; {{it is as if}} they want to embrace Paddy wherever he goes.|$|E
500|$|Although {{the later}} singles [...] "Lovesong" [...] and [...] "Friday I'm in Love" [...] reached higher chart positions, [...] "Just Like Heaven" [...] was the band's American breakthrough, {{and has been}} {{described}} as [...] "in American terms, at least, the one Cure song <b>everyone</b> <b>seems</b> to know." [...] The song inspired the name of, and was used in the 2005 film Just Like Heaven. In 2004 Rolling Stone magazine ranked it number 483 on their list of the [...] "500 Greatest Songs of All Time". In 2005 Entertainment Weekly ranked [...] "Just Like Heaven" [...] 25th on its list of [...] "The 50 Greatest Love Songs", saying, [...] "Turns out guys who wear black eyeliner can be happy." [...] The following year the song placed at number 22 on VH1's poll [...] "100 Greatest Songs of the 80s".|$|E

After being released, Homer hosts a poker game and finds Herman running a jean-counterfeiting operation in the Simpsons' garage. As Herman and his henchmen are about to beat him up, Marge bursts in. As she is cuffing {{the rest of the}} minions, Herman takes Homer hostage and runs to Bart's treehouse, with Marge in pursuit. Herman tries to escape using a pair of counterfeit jeans as a rope, but they rip and he falls to the ground. Wiggum informs Marge that they cannot hold Herman due to the evidence [...] "mysteriously disappearing", with him and the other cops openly stealing the jeans for themselves. Upset at the corruption on the force, Marge resigns.|$|E

Everyone was cooler, <b>everyone</b> <b>seemed</b> more likely to succeed, <b>everyone</b> <b>seemed</b> more natural at it and in retrospect I think that is good.

500|$|On Behind the Bin, a making-of {{documentary}} about Dustbin Baby, Wilson said that [...] "lots {{and lots of}} people will identify with" [...] the central theme of adoption, as at fourteen [...] "you start to look at your mum and dad and think 'I'm nothing like them', and <b>everyone</b> <b>seems</b> to have fantasies about that they were adopted or something, and so I think that it's a typical teenage thing that you question who you are". Richards says that she likes the idea that April [...] "went on a journey to try and find herself" [...] as [...] "a lot of people [...] try and do that {{because a lot of people}} get to the point where they're not really sure who they are any more". Richards also discusses the motif of April's paper dolls, saying that April can relate to them as in different places, she is [...] "still the same person", but that she is [...] "coloured in differently by different people and different surroundings". Alexandra Hewett, who played the Young April, described the dolls as April's [...] "only real friends".|$|E
2500|$|Filipa Jodelka from The Guardian said, [...] "Carl is an EastEnders speciality, a new {{character}} shoehorned {{in with a}} backstory that's not so much shadowy {{as completely}} obscured. <b>Everyone</b> <b>seems</b> to be scared of him, though, because apparently wandering around the Square silently pulling faces counts as menacing these days." [...] Victoria Garo-Falides from the Daily Mirror said Carl is [...] "on track to be the shortest, scariest man ever to walk the Square".|$|E
2500|$|Wee Bull – A bull, also Weebl's arch-nemesis, and, {{revealed}} in [...] "Bull", his father. His {{name is a}} play on the word Weebl. Always seems to win every battle – apart from a Christmas short – against Weebl, who states [...] "damn you wee bull. you win this time." [...] Popular with the ladies. Possibly descended from Wee Mammoth, he always talks by snorting. No words are formed, but <b>everyone</b> <b>seems</b> to understand him, much like Weebl's and Bob's slurred speech. He still loves Weebl however, and wants to talk, according to the subject line of an E-Mail he sends in the recent episode 'Email' ("Son, We Need To Talk. Love Wee Bull").|$|E

2500|$|One day, {{while playing}} with his grandson, Kamin is summoned by his adult {{children}} to watch the launch of a rocket, which <b>everyone</b> <b>seems</b> to know about except him. As he walks outside into the glaring sunlight, Kamin sees Eline and Batai, as young as {{when he first saw}} them. They explain that he has already seen the rocket, just before he came there. Knowing that the planet was doomed, the planet's leaders placed the memories of their culture into a probe and launched it into space, in the hope that it would find someone who could tell others about their species. Picard then realizes the entire context: [...] "Oh, it's me, isn't it?", he says, [...] "I'm the someone...I'm the one it finds." ...|$|E
2500|$|Asked by Samuel French, Inc. if {{he could}} name the playwright who had most {{influenced}} him, Heinze said, [...] "If I were darker, it would be Orton. If I were more laconic, it would be Pinter. If I were more lyrically erudite, it would be Stoppard. If I had ten additional brains, it would be Shakespeare. Hm. <b>Everyone</b> <b>seems</b> to be English. [...] If I were more Irish, it would be Beckett. (And if I had more savoir faire, it would be Molière.)" [...] He added, [...] "I think all my sources of inspiration are unconventional. It's the feeling of something unconventional that {{makes me want to}} write the play. At least for a full-length play that’s true. I think I wouldn't want to invest the time if I didn’t have that feeling." ...|$|E
2500|$|Biographers {{have looked}} for {{consistency}} from musicians who knew Johnson in different contexts: Shines, who traveled extensively with him; Lockwood, {{who knew him}} as his mother's partner; David [...] "Honeyboy" [...] Edwards, whose cousin Willie Mae Powell {{had a relationship with}} Johnson. From a mass of partial, conflicting, and inconsistent eyewitness accounts, biographers have attempted to summarize Johnson's character. [...] "He was well mannered, he was soft spoken, he was indecipherable". [...] "As for his character, <b>everyone</b> <b>seems</b> to agree that, while he was pleasant and outgoing in public, in private he was reserved and liked to go his own way". [...] "Musicians who knew Johnson testified that he was a nice guy and fairly average—except, of course, for his musical talent, his weakness for whiskey and women, and his commitment to the road." ...|$|E

2500|$|On a {{beautiful}} morning, Porgy is released from jail, {{where he has}} been arrested for contempt of court after refusing to look at Crown's body. He returns to Catfish Row much richer after playing craps with his cellmates. He gives gifts to the residents, and pulls out {{a beautiful}} red dress for Bess. He does not understand why <b>everyone</b> <b>seems</b> so uneasy at his return. He sees Clara's baby is now with Serena and realizes something is wrong. He asks where Bess is. Maria and Serena tell him that Bess has run off with Sportin' Life to New York ("Oh Bess, Oh Where's my Bess?"). Porgy calls for his goat cart, and resolves to leave Catfish Row to find her.

2500|$|According to comics {{historian}} Les Daniels, [...] "nearly <b>everyone</b> <b>seems</b> {{to agree}} that Two-Face was Kane's brainchild exclusively". [...] Catwoman, originally introduced by Kane with no costume as [...] "the Cat", was partially inspired by his cousin, Ruth Steel. Kane, a frequent movie goer, mentioned that Jean Harlow was {{a model for the}} design and added that [...] "I always felt that women were feline". [...] Kane created the Scarecrow and drew his first appearance, which was scripted by Finger. [...] Kane also created the original incarnation of Clayface. [...] According to Kane, he drew the Penguin after being inspired by the then advertising mascot of Kool cigarettes — a penguin with a top hat and cane. Finger, however, claimed that he created the villain as a caricature of the aristocratic type, because [...] "stuffy English gentlemen" [...] reminded him of emperor penguins.|$|E
2500|$|Asturias {{received}} much criticism for his earlier essay [...] "El problema social del indio" [...] (1923), which saw no future for a Guatemalan identity {{based on its}} Mayan heritage, and encouraged a progressive ideology to take over. The criticism comes from the complete change of attitude which Leyendas de Guatemala seems to convey. Martin Lienhard argues that this former essay has become a dark spot in Asturias' past, which <b>everyone</b> <b>seems</b> to have forgotten once the author received the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1967. He goes on {{to argue that the}} young Asturias made undeniably racist claims in this essay, which cannot be deleted, and Leyendas de Guatemala does not entirely break from such an attitude either. Lienhard compares the way in which Asturias re-wrote the creation myths of Guatemala to that of Soviet educational propaganda, claiming that he progressively manipulated the culture and the collective memory of a people to serve the interest of a State.|$|E

Where is that ever untrustworthy fickleness?"). [...] was used often to describe the Franks. Contemporary definitions of Frankish ethnicity vary both by period and point of view. A formulary written by Marculf about 700 AD described a continuation of national identities within a mixed population when it stated that [...] "all the peoples who dwell , Franks, Romans, Burgundians and those of other nations, live... according to their law and their custom." [...] Writing in 2009, Professor Christopher Wickham pointed out that [...] "the word 'Frankish' quickly ceased to have an exclusive ethnic connotation. North of the River Loire <b>everyone</b> <b>seems</b> to have been considered a Frank by the mid-7th century at the latest; Romani were essentially the inhabitants of Aquitaine after that".|$|E
2500|$|Abé Mark Nornes, in {{an essay}} {{entitled}} [...] "The Riddle of the Vase: Ozu Yasujirō's Late Spring (1949)," [...] observes: [...] "Nothing in all of Ozu's films has sparked such conflicting explanations; <b>everyone</b> <b>seems</b> compelled {{to weigh in on}} this scene, invoking it as a key example in their arguments." [...] Nornes speculates that {{the reason for this is}} the scene's [...] "emotional power and its unusual construction. The vase is clearly essential to the scene. The director not only shows it twice, but he lets both shots run for what would be an inordinate amount of time by the measure of most filmmakers." [...] To one commentator, the vase represents [...] "stasis," [...] and is thus [...] "an expression of something unified, permanent, transcendent." [...] Another critic describes the vase and other Ozu [...] "still lifes" [...] as [...] "containers for our emotions." [...] Yet another specifically disputes this interpretation, identifying the vase as [...] "a non-narrative element wedged into the action." [...] A fourth scholar sees it as an instance of the filmmaker's deliberate use of [...] "false POV" [...] (point of view), since Noriko is never shown actually looking at the vase the audience sees. A fifth asserts that the vase is [...] "a classic feminine symbol." [...] And yet another suggests several alternative interpretations, including the vase as [...] "a symbol of traditional Japanese culture," [...] and as an indicator of Noriko's [...] "sense that... relationship with her father has been changed." ...|$|E
