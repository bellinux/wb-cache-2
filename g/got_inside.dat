25|$|Milner and Haig {{met again}} at GHQ in France (21 September) - Milner warned Haig that {{manpower}} {{would not be}} available for 1919 if squandered now and told Wilson (23 September) that Haig was being “ridiculously optimistic”, might “embark on another Paschendal (sic)” and that he “had grave doubts whether he had <b>got</b> <b>inside</b> of DH’s head”; Wilson thought the War Cabinet would have to “watch this tendency & stupidity of DH”. He complained that Haig, Foch and du Cane {{did not understand the}} shortage of manpower – in fact Haig understood it perfectly well but hoped to win the war before British manpower ran out. Lloyd George still hoped to shift British efforts to other fronts, leaving the Americans to take over more of the burden on the Western Front going forward.|$|E
25|$|In May 1408, Minkhaung himself led two armies (26,000 men, 2200 horses, 100 elephants), and {{invaded the}} {{southern}} country. What ensued {{was a complete}} disaster. Predictably, Ava forces got bogged down in the swamps of Lower Burma. Three months into the invasion, Ava's troops were running out of supplies due to bad weather as well as Hanthawaddy ambushes on supply lines. For his part, Razadarit could not match Ava's manpower, and ordered two attempts on Minkhaung's life. The first attempt by Hanthawaddy special forces to ambush Minkhaung's small contingent was broken up on the warning by Theiddat who was with the Peguan forces. It turned out that Theiddat could not betray his elder brother. Razadarit had Theiddat executed for the warning. The second attempt nearly succeeded. Razadarit sent a team of commandos led by his top general Lagun Ein to infiltrate the enemy camp. Lagun Ein <b>got</b> <b>inside</b> Minkhaung's tent but refused to kill a sleeping Minkhaung.|$|E
25|$|A {{demolition}} team {{is about}} to bring down a building when one worker is drawn to an area not marked on the blueprints. Inside the area they find a path to the building's foundation, and in the darkness, a boy (Spencer List). The boy is taken to a children's hospital and the Fringe division is contacted. The construction workers examined where the boy was found and determined it had been sealed off for seventy years and could not determine how the boy <b>got</b> <b>inside.</b> The boy does not speak, and Walter Bishop (John Noble) explains some of his medical conditions {{as a result of}} living underground for several years. Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv) seems to be the only person that the boy reacts to, and she helps to coax him to help in his treatment. At one point, she encourages him to eat by sharing candy with him, but he only places the yellow pieces {{in the form of an}} arrow for her.|$|E

500|$|She [...] is not alone. Ask any middle-aged {{socially}} conscious intellectual {{to list the}} books that influenced his or her youthful thinking, {{and he or she}} will most likely mention The Autobiography of MalcolmX.

Some will say that ... they picked it up—by accident, or maybe by assignment, or because a friend pressed it on them—and that they approached the reading of it without great expectations, but somehow that book ... took hold of them. <b>Got</b> <b>inside</b> them.

500|$|Castro {{gathered}} 165 revolutionaries for the mission; 138 {{stationed in}} Santiago, the other 27 in Bayamo. Mostly {{young men from}} Havana and Pinar del Río, Castro insured that [...] {{with the exception of}} himself [...] none had children, and ordered his troops not to cause bloodshed unless they met armed resistance. The attack took place on July 26, 1953, but ran into trouble; 3 of the 16 cars that had set out from Santiago failed to get there. Reaching the barracks, the alarm was raised, with most of the rebels pinned down outside the base by machine gun fire. Those that <b>got</b> <b>inside</b> faced heavy resistance, and 4 were killed before Castro ordered a retreat. The rebels had suffered 6 fatalities and 15 other casualties, whilst the army suffered 19 dead and 27 wounded.|$|E
500|$|With a game engine already assembled, {{the team}} began honing the concept. Bungie was {{interested}} in bringing changes to the classical Halo format which had remained essentially unchanged over three games. The developers spent weeks considering which characters they wanted to focus on. Having players control previous protagonists such as the Master Chief or Arbiter would have brought with it story baggage and expectations. At one point, they considered making the game a Covenant-themed story about an elite strike force. Instead, the developers looked at human characters; while they considered Avery Johnson, they settled on the ODSTs. [...] "The ODSTs have always been fan favorites," [...] Bungie community director Brian Jarrard explained. [...] "We never really <b>got</b> <b>inside</b> ," [...] story director Joseph Staten said, and he saw that game {{as an opportunity to}} flesh out the black-armored soldiers.|$|E

500|$|Production of {{the album}} began in summer of 2004 with Destiny's Child taking help from {{frequent}} collaborators including Rockwilder, Swizz Beatz and Rodney Jerkins. The group worked on the album within {{a period of three}} weeks. Jerkins, who had worked with Beyoncé for her solo album Dangerously in Love, concerned how he would manage the production, saying, [...] "How is this going to work?' Cause Beyoncé, she blew up solo, so how's it going to work in a group together?". He stated that once he <b>got</b> <b>inside</b> the studio, however, his skepticism vanished as he saw the group's [...] "excitement being back in the studio together", calling the process [...] "natural". The members of the group stated that the first week of recording was spent solely on conversations about the happenings in their lives while being apart from each other as they hadn't spent quaility time for a long period. This further inspired them to record the conversations and use it as the main theme of the record.|$|E

[...] Following a trip to Red Cloud in 1916 to visit her family, Cather decided to write a novel based on the events in the life of her childhood friend Annie Sadilek Pavelka, a Bohemian girl who became the model for the title character in My Ántonia. Cather was likewise fascinated by the French-Canadian pioneers from Quebec who had settled in the Red Cloud area while she was a girl.|$|E

2500|$|Haig {{believed}} that the aim should be {{to win the war}} that year, and by spring 1919 at the latest, not July 1919 as the politicians had in mind, and urged that all available able-bodied men and transportation in the UK be sent, as well as men earmarked for the Royal Navy and for munitions production, even at the cost of reducing future munitions output. Milner warned Haig that manpower would not be available for 1919 if squandered now. Although Wilson agreed with Haig that “there was ample evidence of the deterioration of the Boch” (Wilson diary 9 September) [...] Milner told Wilson that Haig was being “ridiculously optimistic”, might “embark on another Paschendal (sic)” and that he “had grave doubts whether he had <b>got</b> <b>inside</b> of DH’s head” (Wilson diary 23 September); Wilson thought the War Cabinet would have to “watch this tendency & stupidity of DH”.|$|E
2500|$|After the 1958 season, the Giants' {{offensive}} coordinator Vince Lombardi left New York to become {{head coach and}} general manager of the Green Bay Packers. In June 1959, the Packers, in one of their first major personnel moves under Lombardi, purchased Tunnell from the Giants. In three years with the Packers, Tunnell saw reduced playing time, but helped to bolster the defense with his experience, worked to develop the team's young players, and became known as [...] "an unofficial pastor" [...] for the team. He appeared in 13 games for the 1961 Packers team that won the NFL championship. He saw playing time in red zone defensive situations. Defensive backs coach Norb Hecker said of Tunnell: [...] "He was still a vicious tackler. When the opposition <b>got</b> <b>inside</b> our 15, we put him in and he responded with the fury of a linebacker. He could fall back on experience and by watching an offensive player's move was seldom beat." ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{fought to}} a {{controversial}} majority draw with Chidi Njokuani on the Push Kick Promotions: Muay Thai World Stand Off 5 card in Las Vegas on 29 September 2013. Njokuani started the fight well, using footwork {{to control the}} ring, but Marcus soon <b>got</b> <b>inside</b> and began landing knees and elbows from the clinch. In round two, Njokuani was twice given time to recover from illegal strikes, an elbow {{to the back of}} the head and a low blow. Each time the fight continued, Marcus would begin to again work in the clinch and Njokuani repeatedly turned his back, so the referee decided to break the fighters continually. Marcus was docked a point by referee Tony Weeks for landing a second low blow in round three and the fight turned into a brawl towards the end. When it went to the judges, the bout was declared a majority draw with two judges scoring the bout a draw and one scoring the bout for Njokuani. Simon Marcus then took to the microphone, calling Chidi Njokuani a [...] "bitch" [...] for his unwillingness to fight in the clinch and questioning the judges knowledge of the Muay Thai scoring system. These post-fight comments led to a heated confrontation between Marcus and Chidi's brother Anthony as they scuffled back stage.|$|E

2500|$|The Germans in Triangle Farm {{held their}} ground until the 1/8th Warwick, {{covered by a}} tank (possibly G. 31), <b>got</b> <b>inside</b> and fought the {{garrison}} hand-to-hand. Tank G. 34 (Second-Lieutenant Coutts) headed for the Cockcroft, the most distant objective, [...] from St Julien, up the Zonnebeke–Langemarck road. It took until [...] to reach the fortification, the crew and the garrison exchanging machine-gun fire for about [...] when about fifty Germans emerged from the Cockcroft and dugouts nearby, only to be shot down by machine-gun fire from the tank. G. 34 ditched south of the Cockcroft soon after and the crew set up the Lewis guns in shell-holes nearby. As the 1/8th Warwick {{were nowhere to be}} seen, Coutts sent a messenger pigeon back with the news and two of the crew to find the troops. The 1/8th Warwick refused to advance until Coutts came back and found an officer to order sixty men forward, to dig in along the Lewis gun cordon. The crew remained until [...] then retired after putting a guard of three rifle-bombers in the tank and camouflaging it. At the other fortified farms and strongpoints, merely the arrival of tanks induced the garrisons to run and the British were able to establish their own line of outposts up {{the west side of the}} St Julien–Poelcappelle road, five of the seven tanks engaged surviving to reach the rally-point. The 1/8th Warwick suffered only 15 wounded and the tank crews, two men killed and 11 wounded, inflicting about 100 casualties on the Germans and taking 30 prisoners.|$|E
