5|$|By 1916, the Princess {{had stopped}} booking live acts and was {{focusing}} <b>exclusively</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> more profitable cinema {{side of the}} business. Revenues from the rental spaces {{in the basement and}} upper floors had also begun to flow in. Notably, Hugh Morrow, a beat cop, had leased apartment 205. His granddaughter Susan Morrow would manage the Princess from 1981 to 1994.|$|E
5|$|In Washington, sea otters {{are found}} almost <b>exclusively</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> outer coasts. They can swim {{as close as}} six feet off shore along the Olympic coast. Reported {{sightings}} of sea otters in the San Juan Islands and Puget Sound almost always {{turn out to be}} North American river otters, which are commonly seen along the seashore. However, biologists have confirmed isolated sightings of sea otters in these areas since the mid-1990s.|$|E

5|$|Credit Suisse {{developed}} the CreditRisk+ model of risk assessment in loans, which is focused <b>exclusively</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> chance of default {{based on the}} exogenous Poisson method. As of 2002 about 20 percent of Credit Suisse's revenue was from its insurance business it gained through the 1997 acquisition of Winterthur. The investment bank's insurance products are primarily popular in the domestic market and include auto, fire, property, life, disability, pension and retirement products among others. Historically 20–40 percent of the bank's revenue has been from private banking services, one of its higher profit-margin divisions.|$|E
5|$|Geothermal {{electric}} {{plants were}} traditionally built <b>exclusively</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> edges of tectonic plates where high temperature geothermal resources are available near the surface. The development of binary cycle {{power plants and}} improvements in drilling and extraction technology enable enhanced geothermal systems over a much greater geographical range. Demonstration projects are operational in Landau-Pfalz, Germany, and Soultz-sous-Forêts, France, while an earlier effort in Basel, Switzerland was shut down after it triggered earthquakes. Other demonstration projects are under construction in Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America.|$|E

5|$|Hasbro {{owns the}} rights of both Blythe and Littlest Pet Shop, toy lines {{respectively}} introduced in 1972 and 1992. Manufactured through their Kenner Products division, Hasbro acquired the Cincinnati-based company, then owned by Tonka, in 1991. Hasbro sold these toys {{under the name of}} this division until they closed down Kenner's original Cincinnati headquarters in 2000. Claster Television had produced an earlier animated show based on Littlest Pet Shop in 1995 for Hasbro, but the 2012 Littlest Pet Shop series marked the first adaptation of the Blythe doll to a character on television. A prior incarnation of such a character is the protagonist of Littlest Pet Shop Presents, an unrelated animated miniseries produced by Cosmic Toast Studios. This series was released by Hasbro <b>exclusively</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Internet.|$|E
5|$|Having found {{success in}} both {{domestic}} and European cup competitions, Revie took the decision to focus <b>exclusively</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> league for the 1968–69 campaign. They went {{the rest of the}} season unbeaten in the league following a 5–1 defeat to Burnley at Turf Moor on 19 October, and secured the title with a 0–0 draw with challengers Liverpool at Anfield; after the game Revie led his team back out onto the pitch to applaud the Liverpool supporters, who in turn applauded the Leeds team. His team set a number of records: most points (67), most wins (27), fewest defeats (2), and most home points (39); a still-unbroken club record is their 34 match unbeaten run that extended into the following season.|$|E
5|$|In {{different}} eras, various gods {{were said}} to hold the highest position in divine society, including the solar deity Ra, the mysterious god Amun, and the mother goddess Isis. The highest deity was usually credited {{with the creation of}} the world and often connected with the life-giving power of the sun. Some scholars have argued, based in part on Egyptian writings, that the Egyptians came to recognize a single divine power that lay behind all things and was present in all the other deities. Yet they never abandoned their original polytheistic view of the world, except possibly during the era of Atenism in the 14th century BC, when official religion focused <b>exclusively</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> impersonal sun god Aten.|$|E

Soon afterward, Microsoft created the CodePlex collaborative development site for hosting open source projects. Activity grew quickly as developers from around the world began to participate, and by early 2007 commercial open source companies, such as Aras Corp,. began to offer enterprise open source software <b>exclusively</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Microsoft platform.|$|E
5|$|M-59 {{was first}} {{designated}} by July 1, 1919 between M-10 (now Bus. US24) in Pontiac and M-19 (later US25 and now M-3) in Mt. Clemens. It would {{be moved to}} follow Hall Road <b>exclusively</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> east end in 1932. The west end was extended in 1936 to end at the Livingston–Oakland county line. The extension to US 23 in Hartland was finished by 1938. The east end was extended again in 1939 along US25 and over to M-29 in New Baltimore. The east end was rerouted again between Mt. Clemens and New Baltimore over another former alignment of M-29 in late 1947 or early 1948. The eastern terminus was truncated to M-29 east of US25/Gratiot Avenue in 1961.|$|E
5|$|NSB El 9 is {{a retired}} class of three {{electric}} locomotives built by Thune for the Norwegian State Railways (NSB), with electrical equipment from Norsk Elektrisk & Brown Boveri (NEBB) and Per Kure. The locomotives were delivered in 1947 after a three-year delay caused by wartime sabotage {{in response to the}} German occupation of Norway. They were used nearly <b>exclusively</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Flåm Line and Hardanger Line, two steep branch lines. The units were used on the Flåm Line until 1983, when they were replaced by El 11. They were then used as shunters until being retired in 1988. Two of the locomotives have been preserved.|$|E

5|$|Preceding the Vietnam War {{the high}} speeds {{aircraft}} were attaining {{led to a}} move to remove the cannon due to the mistaken belief {{that they would be}} useless in a dogfight, but combat experience during the Vietnam War showed conclusively that despite advances in missiles, there was still a need for them. Nearly all modern fighter aircraft are armed with an autocannon and they are also commonly found on ground-attack aircraft. One of the most powerful examples is the 30mm GAU-8/A Avenger Gatling-type rotary cannon, mounted <b>exclusively</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II. The Lockheed AC-130 gunship (a converted transport) can carry a 105mm howitzer as well as a variety of autocannons ranging up to 40mm. Both are used in the close air support role.|$|E
5|$|The bobcat is an {{adaptable}} animal. It prefers woodlands—deciduous, coniferous, or mixed—but {{unlike the}} other Lynx species, it does not depend <b>exclusively</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> deep forest. It ranges from the humid swamps of Florida to desert lands of Texas or rugged mountain areas. It makes its home near agricultural areas, if rocky ledges, swamps, or forested tracts are present; its spotted coat serves as camouflage. The population of the bobcat depends primarily on the population of its prey; other principal factors {{in the selection of}} habitat type include protection from severe weather, availability of resting and den sites, dense cover for hunting and escape, and freedom from disturbance.|$|E
5|$|The {{same year}} Gaudí was {{consulted}} about {{the construction of}} a monumental train station for Barcelona (the future Estació de França). Gaudí suggested an iron structure {{in the form of a}} large suspended awning, a solution quite ahead of its time; perhaps for this reason, it put the head engineers off, and they declined Gaudí's offer. The last known projects by the architect are the chapel for the Colónia Calvet in Torelló, of 1923, and a pulpit for Valencia (the exact location is unknown), of 1924. From then on, Gaudí worked <b>exclusively</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Sagrada Família until his death.|$|E

5|$|Fodor {{revived the}} idea of modularity, without the notion of precise {{physical}} localizability, in the 1980s, {{and became one of}} the most vocal proponents of it with the 1983 publication of his monograph Modularity of Mind. Two properties of modularity in particular, informational encapsulation and domain specificity, make it possible to tie together questions of functional architecture with those of mental content. The ability to elaborate information independently from the background beliefs of individuals that these two properties allow Fodor to give an atomistic and causal account of the notion of mental content. The main idea, in other words, is that the properties of the contents of mental states can depend, rather than <b>exclusively</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> internal relations of the system of which they are a part, also on their causal relations with the external world.|$|E
5|$|For Invasion of the Vorticons, John Carmack and Romero focused <b>exclusively</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> programming, while Adrian Carmack joined late in {{development}} {{and had a}} personal art style that did not match with the game. As a result, the game was largely shaped by designer Tom Hall's personal experiences and interests. Keen's red sneakers and Green Bay Packers football helmet were items Hall wore as a child, dead enemies left behind corpses due to his belief that child players should be taught that death had permanent consequences, and enemies were based loosely on his reading of Sigmund Freud's psychological theories, {{such as that of}} the id. The team reprised their roles for both Keen Dreams and Goodbye, Galaxy, with the addition of programmer Jason Blochowiak for Goodbye, Galaxy, and changed the game engine and design for the next Keen games: an increase in graphical quality with parallax scrolling to make the background move at a different speed than the foreground, a pseudo-3D view rather than a side-on view, ramps rather than solely flat surfaces, support for sound cards, and changes to the design based on player feedback.|$|E
