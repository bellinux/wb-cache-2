50|$|Three {{types of}} {{structures}} are available: small ships, large <b>ships,</b> and <b>stations.</b> The size, resource requirements, {{and availability of}} blocks depends {{on the type of}} structure they are attached to. Small ships do not allow assemblers or refineries, whereas large ships cannot use gatling guns, instead using the AI-controlled gatling or missile turret variations. Blocks attached to a small ship are considerably smaller and require fewer resources than those attached to large <b>ships</b> or <b>stations</b> (for example, light armor requires 25 steel plates on a station, but only one on a small <b>ship).</b> <b>Stations</b> use the same blocks as large ships and can be converted into large ships using a control terminal; however, they are immobile and can instead be physically anchored to terrain voxels.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the opinion}} of the Marconi companies, they were the only {{legitimate}} radio communication providers, as they asserted that all their competitors provided inferior offerings that infringed on the Marconi patents. Following standard Marconi policy, prior to 1912 American Marconi would not sell equipment, instead leasing it, while supplying operators who were loyal company employees. The most controversial early company policy was the standing order that, except in the case of emergencies, Marconi shore and <b>ship</b> <b>stations</b> would refuse to communicate with vessels employing radio equipment manufactured by other companies. This unwillingness to communicate with other systems would eventually be prohibited by international treaties, beginning with the first International Radiotelegraphic Convention held in Berlin in 1903. In the United States, the Wireless Ship Act of 1910, which required that most passenger vessels plying U.S. ports carry radio equipment, also specified that they had to be willing to communicate [...] "with shore or <b>ship</b> <b>stations</b> using other systems of radio-communication". The Radio Act of 1912 instituted radio station licensing, and further required that shore stations open to general public service [...] "shall be bound to exchange radiograms with any similar shore station and with any <b>ship</b> <b>station</b> without distinction of the radio system adopted by such stations".|$|R
