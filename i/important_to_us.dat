Paul wasn't. And neither, probably, was Topper Headon, who didn't wind up even coming in the end. It didn't look like a performance {{was going to happen}} anyway. I mean, you usually play at that ceremony when you get in. Joe had passed by that point, so we didn't. We were never in agreement. It was never at a point where all of us wanted to do it at the same time.

50|$|From {{the point}} of view of {{officials}} at Ecopetrol, developing petroleum reserves in Arauca seemed a great opportunity, especially with multinational petroleum companies willing to accept all or most of the apparent financial risks. Oil for export to the United States of America from South America was strategically <b>important</b> <b>to</b> the <b>US</b> in 1985-86 because of a general interest in decreasing dependency upon middle-eastern oil. Anti-Communist efforts by the US under President Ronald Reagan in Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Grenada suggest that it was <b>important</b> <b>to</b> the <b>US</b> <b>to</b> decrease Communist influences in Central and South America. The Colombian Government was, at that time, fighting a civil war on multiple fronts with Communist Guerrilla groups. From a private enterprise point of view, middle eastern crises propping up the price of oil made petroleum development in Colombia an attractive opportunity.|$|R

500|$|Musically, 21st Century Breakdown {{is similar}} to the punk rock style of American Idiot, but many critics have claimed that Green Day's {{traditional}} sound has evolved in the five years since their last release to incorporate new influences such as heavier, louder pop rock and stadium rock on an epic scale. Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone indicated that the album sports ballads that are Green Day's most polished; he claimed that the band [...] "combine punk thrash with their newfound love of classic-rock grandiosity". MTV compared the material to that of classic rockers like The Who, while Spin called the title track [...] "Green Day's most epic song yet". Cool has remarked: [...] "It's <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> that we're still looked at as a punk band. It was our religion, our higher education".

[...] Bell also talked about the cliffhanger involving Simmons being absorbed by a Kree monolith: [...] "When we first started talking about the Monolith, we knew that it needed to present a threat and we needed to demonstrate some of that threat and the promise of more story... It's easy to kill a character for shock value or whatever, and we did have a number of deaths this season, but ... we prefer to leave you with something to talk about, to walk away with.

Really, only two humans had powers, Captain America and the Hulk. We had to be very responsible—we didn't want to dive into this show and have a new one every week, and have it feel like we disregarded everything that they spent so much money and time building in the films. Along those same lines, the origin of a power is always a complex thing—Marvel cares about it feeling grounded, it feeling scientific at some level. Even on Thor, he says, [...] "In our world, magic and science are the same thing." [...] So this is a way for us to sort of open up our world. It's a way to introduce, into the MCU, the idea that people can be born with a power. They don't have to be engineered in a lab, they don't need to have some freak accident with a vat of acid. They can be born with this. That's sort of a gamechanger, not just on our show, but in the cinematic universe".|$|E
