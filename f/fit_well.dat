5|$|The show's co-creators, Fawcett and Graeme Manson, {{along with}} Maslany {{and her hair}} and makeup artists, {{developed}} the character of Tony {{over a period of}} six months after deciding that the inclusion of a transgender character would <b>fit</b> <b>well</b> with the show's themes of identity, gender and sexuality. Overall, the episode received mixed reviews: critics praised Maslany's performance but found Tony's character underdeveloped and gimmicky and found the plot disorganised.|$|E

Everton's James Dunn received treatment on a thigh injury in the ten days preceding the game, but was anticipated to be fit enough to play. Manchester City's main injury worry was Fred Tilson, who was troubled by a leg injury. Dunn was passed <b>fit</b> <b>well</b> before the game, allowing Everton to field the same line-up that played in four of their five previous cup ties.|$|E

A month later he won again in Addis Ababa {{with a time of}} 2:21:23, which was faster than the existing Olympic record held by Emil Zátopek. Niskanen entered Abebe Bikila and Abebe Wakgira in the marathon at the 1960 Rome Olympics, which would be run on September 10. In Rome, Abebe Bikila purchased new running shoes, but they did not <b>fit</b> <b>well</b> and gave him blisters. He consequently decided to run barefoot instead.|$|E

5|$|Redhead and Smith {{placed the}} genus in the Strophariaceae, as {{the biology of}} the fruit bodies and spore print color fit the broad concept of that family envisaged by Robert Kühner in 1984. They noted, however, that the genus did not <b>fit</b> <b>well</b> in a more {{restricted}} concept of the family due to its lack of a germ pore and roughened spore walls. More recently, taxonomic authorities have placed the genus in the family Psathyrellaceae; molecular analysis shows it to be most closely allied to this group.

5|$|In a later review, McNulty praised scenes {{like the}} one in which Sasuke admits his crimes and agrees to go to prison, as it showed {{acceptance}} of responsibility for his misdeeds. McNulty also praised Sasuke's later journey of self-redemption, as well as his decision to respond to Sakura's feelings for him before leaving. IGN's Ramsey Isler considered Sasuke's change of heart drastic, but felt it was a fitting conclusion for the character after the series' events, and <b>fit</b> <b>well</b> with him once again leaving the village, this time on good terms with his friends and the village. Manga author Hiroaki Samura was pleased with Sasuke's character arc in the series, especially his influence on Naruto and {{the fact that in the}} end he returns to Konohagakure because of Naruto. While finding Sasuke's fate in the manga's ending predictable, McNulty felt that the character's monologue after his final fight with Naruto helped to show a deeper side to him.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} Walter Skinner {{was played}} by actor Mitch Pileggi, who had unsuccessfully auditioned for {{the roles of}} two or three other characters on The X-Files before getting the part. At first, {{the fact that he was}} asked back to audition for the recurring role slightly puzzled him, until he discovered the reason he had not previously been cast in those roles—Carter had been unable to envision Pileggi as any of those characters, because the actor had been shaving his head. When Pileggi auditioned for Walter Skinner, he had been in a grumpy mood and had allowed his small amount of hair to grow. His attitude <b>fit</b> <b>well</b> with Skinner's character, causing Carter to assume that the actor was only pretending to be grumpy. Pileggi later realized he had been lucky that he had not been cast in one of the earlier roles, as he believed he would have appeared in only a single episode and would have missed the opportunity to play the recurring role.|$|E

Even when the HOV formula <b>fits</b> <b>well,</b> {{it does not mean}} that Heckscher–Ohlin theory is valid. Indeed, Heckscher–Ohlin theory claims that the state of factor endowments of each country (or each region) determines the production of each country (respectively of each region) but Bernstein and Weinstein found that the factor endowments have little predictive power. The factor-endowments-driven model (FED model) has errors much greater than the HOV model.|$|R

25|$|Dentures that <b>fit</b> <b>well</b> {{during the}} first few years after {{creation}} will not necessarily <b>fit</b> <b>well</b> {{for the rest of the}} wearer's lifetime. This is because the bone and mucosa of the mouth are living tissues, which are dynamic over decades. Bone remodeling never stops in living bone. Edentulous jaw ridges tend to resorb progressively over the years, especially the alveolar ridge of the lower jaw. Mucosa reacts to being chronically rubbed by the dentures. Poorly fitting dentures hasten both of those processes compared to the rates with well-fitting dentures. Poor fitting dentures may also lead to the development of conditions such as epulis fissuratum.|$|E
