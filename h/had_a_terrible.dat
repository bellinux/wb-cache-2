25|$|Kent {{took him}} on in 1998, but here again he was {{frustrated}} in his ambitions: he played only twice, {{and his three}} wickets cost more than 51 runs apiece. In June and July he <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> run, going seven first and second-team games without a wicket, although he followed that up with a fine run in the seconds, taking 30 wickets in six successive innings; this, however, {{was not enough to}} win him back his place in the first eleven.|$|E
25|$|Casey {{was also}} a violinist and he loved to play Irish songs for his fellow friars during {{recreation}} time, but he <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> singing voice, attributed to his childhood speech impediment. Other friars could not refrain from rolling their eyes or coughing, so he would excuse himself politely and sneak down to the chapel to entertain an invisible audience at the tabernacle. The friar often fasted, but ate enough. Until his late seventies, {{he was able to}} join the younger religious in games of tennis and volleyball, and even went jogging on occasion.|$|E
25|$|Partizan <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> {{start in}} 2016–17 season. They are {{eliminated}} in second qualifying round for the UEFA Europa League by Zagłębie Lubin. Partizan {{also had the}} same start in Serbian SuperLiga. In August, young head coach Marko Nikolić returned to Partizan. Nikolić ran a streak of 37 consecutive games without a loss in both the league and cup (33 wins), three wins and one draw against their arch rivals Red Star, and won the sixth double in club history. Brazilian midfielder Leonardo and captain of Serbian U-21 side Uroš Đurđević scored 24 goals each, during Partizan's sensational league campaign.|$|E

25|$|English {{achieved}} {{slightly above}} average score, {{but it was}} expected Australia should chase it down. However, rain interrupted Australia's innings several times, and the interruptions, the lost wickets, the adjusted target and slow outfield made the required run rate difficult. England ensured victory with further wickets as Australia tried to progress the score. It was a huge victory for England, who had otherwise <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> tour and who {{at the start of}} the series were playing poor cricket. The defeat of Australia was a significant blow to the reigning world champions, they also lost their next three matches in New Zealand.|$|E
25|$|In the U.S. the {{traditional}} single-action revolver still reigned supreme {{until the late}} 19th century. In Europe, however, arms makers were quick to adopt the double-action trigger. While the US was producing weapons like the Model 1873, the Europeans were building double-action models like the French MAS Modèle 1873 and the somewhat later British Enfield Mk I and II revolvers (Britain relied on cartridge conversions of the earlier Beaumont–Adams double-action prior to this). Colt's first attempt at a double action revolver {{to compete with the}} European manufacturers was the Colt Model 1877, which earned lasting notoriety for its overly complex, expensive and fragile trigger mechanism, which in addition to failing frequently, also <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> trigger pull unless given the attentions of a competent gunsmith.|$|E
25|$|Árbenz {{served as}} defense {{minister}} under President Arévalo. He {{was the first}} minister of this portfolio, since it was previously called the Ministry of War. In 1947 Dr. Arévalo, in company with a friend and two Russian dancers who were visiting Guatemala, <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> car accident {{on the road to}} Panajachel: fell into a ravine and was seriously injured, while all his companions were killed. The official party leaders signed a pact with Lieutenant Colonel Arana, in which he pledged not to attempt any coup against the ailing president, in exchange for the revolutionary parties as the official candidate in the next election. However, the recovery of the sturdy president was almost miraculous and soon he was able to take over the government. Lieutenant Colonel Francisco Javier Arana had accepted this pact because he wanted to be known as a Democratic hero of the uprising against Ponce and believed that the Barranco Pact ensured his position when the time of the presidential elections came.|$|E

25|$|After {{promising}} {{seasons in}} 2005 and 2006, {{it was expected}} that the Tigers would take the next step in 2007, and play finals football. After massive hype in the off-season, the Tigers <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> start to the 2007 season, losing their first 9 matches (this included suffering their biggest ever defeat, at the hands of eventual premiers Geelong, by a whopping 157 points). Their first premiership points came in a draw against the Brisbane Lions in Round 10, and their first win of the season didn't come until Round 12 against fellow straggler Melbourne. After Round 18 of the season, the Tigers had registered a mere 1 win, 1 draw, and 16 losses, and were looking like recording their worst ever recorded season. However, late-season victories over old rivals Collingwood in Round 19, and Essendon in Round 21, saved them from this fate. They would eventually finish the year as wooden-spooners, with 3 wins, 1 draw, and 18 losses.|$|E
25|$|Namath {{finished}} the game having completed 17 of his 28 passes. He {{is the only}} quarterback to win Super Bowl MVP without throwing a touchdown pass. Snell rushed for 121 yards on 30 carries with a touchdown, and caught 4 passes for 40 yards. Sauer caught eight passes for 133 yards. Beverly became the first player in Super Bowl history to record twp interceptions. Morrall <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> game—just 6 of 17 completions for 71 yards, with 3 interceptions. Through 51 games, he had the third worst passer rating in Super Bowl history, with a 9.3, one of only 3 ratings below 10. Despite not being put into the game {{until late in the}} third quarter, Unitas finished with more pass completions (11) and passing yards (110) than Morrall, but he also threw one interception. Matte was the Colts' top rusher with 116 yards on just 11 carries, an average of 10.5 yards per run, and caught 2 passes for 30 yards. The Colts were minus-4 in turnovers throwing four interceptions, all of which were deep in Jet territory.|$|E
25|$|Pocock played rugby {{while still}} a schoolboy, {{and in his}} final year he {{represented}} Clifton College. In 1873 he played his first game for local team Clifton Rugby Football Club, but on his posting to Edinburgh, during the 1876/77 rugby season, he turned out for Edinburgh Wanderers. In 1877, while playing for Wanderers, Pocock was approached by the Scottish Rugby Union to represent Scotland in the 1877 Test match against Ireland. The Scottish Rugby Union needed to gain permission from the Rugby Football Union to play Pocock due to his nationality. Although Pocock was a quick player and scored many tries at club level, he {{was supported by a}} very strong Wanderers pack; at international level he was far more exposed. Pocock had a very good game for Scotland against Ireland, scoring a try on this debut match which Scotland won 6–0. Pocock was reselected for the very next game, played in Edinburgh against England just a month later. Despite a win for Scotland from a solitary dropped goal from Malcolm Cross, Pocock <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> match, and at one point was moved out of his three-quarter position and into the forwards. Pocock, never a favourite with the Scottish spectators due to being English, was never selected for Scotland again.|$|E

25|$|In an {{extremely}} high quality first round match at the Masters, Judd Trump made two centuries and Fu three, with there being nine further breaks above 50 as Fu edged through 6–5. He beat Mark Allen 6–2 and then lost 6–4 to O'Sullivan in the semi-finals. Fu also {{played in the}} semi-finals of the World Grand Prix and was 4–3 up on Ryan Day, who needed four snookers in the eighth frame. He went on {{to get them to}} square the match and then overcame Fu 6–4. At the Players Championship, Fu defeated Anthony McGill 5–1 and Mark Selby 5–2, before coming back from 5–3 down against Ding Junhui to win 6–5 and reach the final. From 5–2 up on Trump, Fu lost six frames in a row and would be beaten 10–8. Fu <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> start to his first round match at the World Championship as he was 7–1 down to Luca Brecel, though he did make a century to be 7–2 behind overnight. He won the first two frames upon the resumption of play and eventually levelled at 8–8, before completing the comeback with a 10–9 victory. The second round saw Fu play Neil Robertson and the match was evenly poised throughout with the first session finishing 4–4, the second 8–8 and Robertson moving to 11–10 up in the last session. The first to 13 would qualify for the quarter-finals to meet Mark Selby and despite a kick when 59–0 ahead at 12–11 that almost let Robertson level, Fu proceeded to win 13–11. Fu was then defeated 13–3 by defending and eventual champion Selby, losing with a session to spare. However, he was ranked sixth after the event, the highest Fu has ever finished a season in his career.|$|E

500|$|Lydford Castle was {{involved}} in the English Civil War that broke out in 1642 between the Royalist supporters of Charles I and Parliament. The castle was used by the Royalist commander Sir Richard Grenville as his main military prison in the region. It <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> reputation amongst Parliamentarians, who complained that it was used to summarily execute military prisoners and to extort money from innocent civilians, on fear of imprisonment. At {{the end of the civil}} war, the Lydford estate appears to have been sold off by Parliament [...] The castle was assessed by their surveyors to be [...] "almost totally ruined" [...] in 1650: the roof of the tower was still mostly intact, but the floors and their beams were collapsing, and the whole site, including the bailey, was only worth around £80.|$|E

500|$|Plans {{called for}} a first {{appearance}} at a rehearsal of Under Milk Wood at the Poetry Centre. Brinnin, who {{was director of the}} Poetry Centre, did not travel to New York but remained in Boston to write. He handed responsibility to his assistant, Liz Reitell, who was keen to see Thomas {{for the first time since}} their three-week romance early in the year. She met Thomas at Idlewild Airport and was shocked at his appearance, as he [...] "looked pale, delicate and shaky, not his usual robust self". Thomas told her he had <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> week, had missed her terribly and wanted to go to bed with her. Despite Reitell's previous misgivings about their relationship, they spent the rest of the day and night together. After being taken by Reitell to check in at the Chelsea Hotel, Thomas took the first rehearsal of Under Milk Wood. They then went to the White Horse Tavern in Greenwich Village, before returning to the Chelsea Hotel.|$|E
500|$|The Grizzlies {{were created}} as an {{expansion}} {{team for the}} 1995–96 season which, along {{with the creation of}} the Toronto Raptors, saw the NBA expand into Canada. The Grizzlies were owned by Vancouver Canucks owner Arthur Griffiths. His company {{was in the process of}} building General Motors Place (GM Place) for the Canucks, and saw the Grizzlies as an additional tenant. Both Canadian teams (the Vancouver Grizzlies and the Toronto Raptors) were hampered by the NBA's decision to deny them one of the top five picks in the first draft, and the teams would not be allowed a top draft pick in the following three seasons, even if they should win the lottery. The teams were also hindered from using their full salary cap the first two seasons. For all six seasons in Vancouver, the Grizzlies <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> record. They finished seventh of seven in five seasons, and claimed one sixth place in the Midwest Division, never close to reaching the playoffs. The team won 101games and lost 359, giving a winning percentage of [...]220.|$|E
