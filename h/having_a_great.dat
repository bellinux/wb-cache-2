5|$|The early texts do {{not contain}} just-war {{ideology}} as such. Some argue that a sutta in the Gamani Samyuttam rules out all military service. In this passage, a soldier asks the Buddha {{if it is true}} that, as he has been told, soldiers slain in battle are reborn in a heavenly realm. The Buddha reluctantly replies that if he is killed in battle while his mind is seized with the intention to kill, he will undergo an unpleasant rebirth. In the early texts, a person's mental state at the time of death is generally viewed as <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> impact on the next birth.|$|E

5|$|Peasant {{society is}} much less {{documented}} than the nobility. Most of the surviving information available to historians comes from archaeology; few detailed written records documenting peasant life remain from before the 9th century. Most of the descriptions of the lower classes come from either law codes or writers from the upper classes. Landholding patterns in the West were not uniform; some areas had greatly fragmented landholding patterns, but in other areas large contiguous blocks of land were the norm. These differences allowed {{for a wide variety}} of peasant societies, some dominated by aristocratic landholders and others <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> deal of autonomy. Land settlement also varied greatly. Some peasants lived in large settlements that numbered as many as 700 inhabitants. Others lived in small groups of a few families and still others lived on isolated farms spread over the countryside. There were also areas where the pattern was a mix of two or more of those systems. Unlike in the late Roman period, there was no sharp break between the legal status of the free peasant and the aristocrat, and it was possible for a free peasant's family to rise into the aristocracy over several generations through military service to a powerful lord.|$|E

5|$|Æthelric was deposed by the Council of Windsor on 24 May 1070 {{and imprisoned}} at Marlborough, being {{replaced}} by Stigand (not {{the same as the}} archbishop), who later moved the seat of the diocese to Chichester. It is possible, that his deposition was tied to the fact that about that time, King Harold of England's mother and sister took refuge with the count of Flanders. If Æthelric was related to the Godwin's, King William I of England may have feared that the bishop would use his diocese to launch a rebellion. Other reasons put forward include the fact that Æthelric had been consecrated by Stigand, but the other bishop that Stigand had consecrated, Siward the Bishop of Rochester was not deposed. Æthelric was a monk, and while not <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> reputation for sanctity, he was not held to be immoral either. The pope did not feel that his deposition had been handled correctly, so his deposition was confirmed at the Council of Winchester on 1 April 1076. It continued to be considered uncanonical, but Æthelric was never restored to his bishopric.|$|E

25|$|Evolutionary {{psychology}} (or {{more specifically}} evolutionary psychopathology or psychiatry) {{has also been}} proposed as an overall theory, positing that many mental disorders involve the dysfunctional operation of mental modules adapted to ancestral physical or social environments but not necessarily to modern ones.

Some related behavioral abnormalities {{have been found in}} non-human great apes. Evolutionary psychology applies Darwinian principles to human behavior by saying that human minds are products of natural selection and have specific functions. Humans strive to carry on their genetic legacy through their offspring. This theory identifies the environment as <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> effect on a person's mental development.|$|E

25|$|The {{inclusion}} of Tate in the England side {{appears to have}} been a result of friction between MacLaren and the selectors (and in particular their Chairman, Lord Hawke) that had developed during the course of the series. According to Fry, the selectors included Tate in the twelve (he was a late addition to the eleven originally selected) because they thought that MacLaren could not possibly pick him and would therefore have to play their preferred eleven. However, MacLaren was supposedly annoyed that Haigh was not included, and therefore on the morning of the match chose Tate for the final eleven in preference to Hirst. However, Tate had been <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> season, eventually finishing second in the first-class wicket tallies behind Rhodes, and an argument could be made for his inclusion.|$|E

The University of Naples Federico II, the first {{university}} in Europe dedicated to training secular administrators, was founded by Frederick II, making Naples the intellectual centre of the kingdom. Conflict between the Hohenstaufens and the Papacy led in 1266 to Pope Innocent IV crowning the Angevin duke Charles I King of Sicily: Charles officially moved the capital from Palermo to Naples, where he resided at the Castel Nuovo. <b>Having</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> interest in architecture, Charles I imported French architects and workmen and was personally involved in several building projects in the city.
