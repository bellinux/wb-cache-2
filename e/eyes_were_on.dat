5|$|After Sebastian Vettel's {{surprise}} victory {{two weeks}} prior in Malaysia, <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> <b>on</b> Ferrari {{whether they would}} be able to continue their good race pace in China and challenge the Mercedes for the win. As lower track temperatures were expected for the race, a serious competitiveness of Ferrari was cast into doubt, as they had benefited from lower tyre degradation in the heat of Malaysia. All ten teams taking part in the championship participated in the race, with Marussia hoping to finally be able to run both cars continually, after Will Stevens had failed to start in Malaysia.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the race, all <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> <b>on</b> {{the battle}} for third place, as Häkkinen's pace was so slow that Karl Wendlinger was {{catching}} him in the Sauber, aiming to give Sauber their first podium finish. However, Häkkinen was able to resist Wendlinger's challenge and finish in third place, with Wendlinger fourth. Ukyo Katayama finished fifth for Tyrrell and Hill was able to battle back to finish sixth, the last of the points-scorers.|$|E
25|$|England’s innings {{proceeded}} well {{through the}} morning of day 2, with Ian Bell posting a fluent 83 before chipping a shot to midwicket. However, England then suffered a mini collapse, triggered by Muttiah Muralitharan, and slipped to 185/6 before rain curtailed the day’s play. By this point, all <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> <b>on</b> Muralitharan {{who was on the}} verge of overtaking Shane Warne’s career haul of 708 test wickets.|$|E

25|$|All <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> <b>on</b> Jack Martin for the Round 1 clash against Richmond but a {{shoulder}} injury in the fifth minute of the game ruled the talented teenage out {{for a minimum of}} two months. Despite the injury, the Gold Coast came out victorious against the Tigers by three goals. Mixed results followed as the Gold Coast entered Round 5 with a 2-2 record. The team would then make club history by recording five consecutive victories against Melbourne, Greater Western Sydney, North Melbourne, St Kilda and the Western Bulldogs.|$|E
25|$|Before the {{beginning}} of the 2005 English cricket season began, a resurgent English cricket team had won four Test series in a row, going unbeaten through the 2004 calendar year. The start of the international season saw England defeat Bangladesh 2–0 in their two-match series, winning both Tests by an innings. This was followed by a tri-nations one-day tournament that also featured Australia. However, all <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> <b>on</b> the Ashes. Australia still started as favourites, but England, {{for the first time in}} years, were expected to put up a real challenge to Aussie supremacy.|$|E
25|$|Two months later, Woods was {{the only}} player under par at the U.S. Open, and resurrected buzz about the {{calendar}} Grand Slam, which had eluded him in 2000. All <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> <b>on</b> Woods at the Open Championship, but his third round score of 81 in dreadful weather at Muirfield ended his Grand Slam hopes. At the PGA Championship, he nearly repeated his 2000 feat of winning three majors in one year, but bogeys at the 13th and 14th holes {{in the final round}} cost him the championship by one stroke. Nonetheless, he took home the money title, Vardon Trophy, and Player of the Year honors for the fourth year in a row.|$|E
