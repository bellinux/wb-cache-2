2500|$|Nutrition {{scientists}} {{began to}} refine this hypothesis {{in the early}} 20th century, emphasizing the role of negatively charged particles (anions) and positively charged particles (cations) in food.

5000|$|<b>Hippuric</b> <b>acid</b> (Gr. hippos, horse, ouron, urine) is a {{carboxylic}} acid {{found in the}} urine of horses and other herbivores. <b>Hippuric</b> <b>acid</b> crystallizes in rhombic prisms which are readily soluble in hot water, melt at 187 °C, and decompose at about 240 °C.

40|$|For over 50 years, hippuric/quinic acids were {{believed}} to have no biological efficacy. Here data are presented to {{support the hypothesis that}} quinic acid is not responsible for any efficacy, but rather that quinic acid nutritionally supports the synthesis of tryptophan and nicotinamide in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and that this in turn leads to DNA repair enhancement and NF-kB inhibition via increased nicotinamide and tryptophan production. Moreover, it is shown that quinic acid is a normal constituent of our diet, capable of conversion to tryptophan and nicotinamide via the GI tract microflora, thus providing an in situ physiological source of these essential metabolic ingredients to humans. The concentrations of quinic and <b>hippuric</b> <b>acids</b> in the diet were dependent on each other when analysed in urine, as was evidenced by a significant linear regression analysis that included unsupplemented control subjects (n = 45, p < 0. 001). Thus, these ingredients were identified as major dietary components, and not simply originating from environmental pollution as previously had been thought.

40|$|With {{the final}} aim of ascertaining {{consistent}} {{data about the}} changes of phenolic metabolites in faeces after a regular wine consumption, the present paper compiles the data from two previous human intervention studies: a) a pilot study (n = 8), that compared the ingestion of de-alcoholised red wine (272 mL/day), red wine (272 mL/day), or gin (100 mL/day) during 20 days, and b) a large trial study (n = 41, 33 cases and 8 controls), that assessed variability among individuals after the intake of red wine (250 mL/day, 28 days). Great coincidence was observed in the main phenolic metabolites identified in the faecal samples from both studies that included benzoic <b>acids,</b> phenols, <b>hippuric</b> <b>acids,</b> phenylacetic acids, phenylpropionic acids, valeric acids, valerolactones and cinnamic acids. However, significant differences (P < 0. 05) in the total phenolic content between faecal samples {{before and after the}} wine intervention was only observed for the large trial study (358 ± 270 and 625 ± 380 μg/g faeces, corresponding to the mean values before and after the intervention, respectively), emphasizing the large variability in the phenolic-metabolizing gut-microbial capacity among individuals. The overall results confirm that consumption of wine enhances phenolic metabolism, which might have physiological relevancy at the gut level.

40|$|International audienceThe {{composition}} of the dairy matrix used in yogurt manufacture could influence the metabolic activity of yogurt starter and the compounds produced during fermentation. In this way, the lactose hydrolysis with a β-galactosidase enzyme and the supplementation with dairy powders to obtain different types of delactosed yogurts for lactose-intolerant people modifies the milk base composition. In this work, we studied {{the influence of the}} addition of different doses of β-galactosidase and levels of dairy powders on organic acids profile during the manufacture and storage of two varieties of yogurt (natural and sweetened). Lactose, glucose, galactose, titratable acidity, fermentation time, and microbiological counts were also evaluated. The mean proportions of lactose/glucose/galactose in relation to the total sugars were 18 : 36 : 46 in hydrolyzed yogurts, while they were 81 : 4 : 15 in unhydrolyzed ones. In supplemented yogurts, the content of lactose, citric, orotic, and <b>hippuric</b> <b>acids</b> were significantly increased. The starter population was similar in all yogurts, but some changes in their activity were evidenced due to both factors studied. The fermentation time was slightly increased, and the lactic acid content and the titratable acidity were significantly increased due to fortification while they were decreased by enzyme addition. These results are probably due to the increase in the buffer properties of the milk base by the dairy powder addition and due to an inhibition of the starter activity caused by changes in the carbohydrate profile.

Recent studies have investigated the absorption, metabolism and excretion of cranberry (poly) phenols; however, little is known about whether they follow a dose response in vivo at different levels of intake. An acute double-blind randomized controlled trial in 10 healthy men with cranberry juices containing 409, 787, 1238, 1534 and 1910 mg total (poly) phenols was performed.

Total plasma, but not excreted urinary (poly) phenol metabolites, exhibited a linear dose response (r 2 = 0. 74, p < 0. 05), driven by caffeic acid 4 -O-ß-d-glucuronide, quercetin- 3 -O-ß-d-glucuronide, ferulic acid 4 -O-ß-d-glucuronide, 2, 5 -dihydroxybenzoic acid, 2, 4 -dihydroxybenzoic acid, ferulic acid, caffeic acid 3 -O-ß-d-glucuronide, sinapic acid, ferulic acid 4 -O-sulfate, 3 -hydroxybenzoic acid, syringic acid, vanillic acid- 4 -O-sulfate, (4 R) - 5 -(3 ′-hydroxyphenyl) -γ-valerolactone- 4 ′-O-sulfate, 4 -methylgallic acid- 3 -O-sulfate, and isoferulic acid 3 -O-sulfate (all r 2 ≥ 0. 89, p < 0. 05). Inter-individual variability of the plasma metabolite concentration was broad and dependent on the metabolite. Herein, we show that specific plasma (poly) phenol metabolites are linearly related to the amount of (poly) phenols consumed in cranberry juice. The large inter-individual variation in metabolite profile may be due to variations in the gut microbiome...|$|R

SPECIFICITY 111 a qualitative test for glycine based on the color devel-oped with pyridine and alkyl chloroformate was recently reported by Sublett and Jewell (13).

40|$|Epidemiological {{studies suggest}} a {{protective}} role of dietary anthocyanins, micronutrients present mainly in berries, against cardiovascular diseases.

However, the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms still remain unknown. The {{aim of the}} present study was to investigate the effect of anthocyanins and their gut metabolites identified in plasma on monocyte adhesion to TNFα-stimulated endothelial cells, the initial step of atherosclerosis development. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were exposed to cyanidin- 3 -O-glucoside, cyanidin- 3 -O-galactoside, cyanidin- 3 -O-arabinoside, delphinidin- 3 -O-glucoside, peonidin- 3 -O-glucoside and 4 -hydroxybenzaldehyde for 3 hours and to protocatechuic, ferulic, <b>hippuric</b> and vanillic <b>acid</b> for 18 h at physiologically-relevant concentrations, all at 0. 1 μM, 0. 2 μM, 0. 5 μM, 1 μM and 2 μM. Subsequently, HUVECs were stimulated with TNFα (1 ng/ml) for 4 hours followed by 15 minutes incubation with monocytes. Monocytes adhesion to HUVECs was determined using the flow cytometry. This study showed that exposure of HUVECs to cyanidin- 3 -O-galactoside, cyanidin- 3 -O-arabinoside, delphinidin- 3 -O-glucoside and peonidin- 3 -O-glucoside significantly attenuated monocyte adhesion at 0. 1 μM by 27. 4 % in average. Ferulic acid decreased adhesion at 1 μM and 2 μM by 28. 5 %, hippuric at 2 μM by 18. 1 % and protocatechuic by 36. 5 % at all concentrations. Exposure of HUVECs to mixture of compounds used in 3 -hour exposure period, resulted in adhesion decrease by 28. 3 %. A significant decrease in monocyte transendothelial migration when HUVECs were pre-exposed to the mixture of these compounds has also been observed. In order to identify molecular mechanisms underlying the observed effects, impact of these metabolites on genes expression and miRNA have been performed using TLDA and microarrays approche respectively, as well as the impact on cell signalling pathways involved in the observed nutrigenomic effects. In conclusion, this study showed the biological potency of plasma anthocyanins and their gut metabolites to modulate the adhesion of monocyte to endothelial cells at physiologically-relevant concentrations.
