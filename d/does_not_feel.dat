5|$|Back in the warehouse, Gabe Lewis (Zach Woods) unsuccessfully {{tries to}} {{strike up a}} {{relationship}} with a new warehouse worker, Val (Ameenah Kaplan). Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson), observing Gabe's pitiful attempts, tries to imply that Val <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> the same way, but to no avail. When Gabe does ask Val out, she politely declines and says she does not date co-workers. Darryl hears all of this and decides he will not pursue Val either.|$|E
5|$|Love's {{design process}} {{has become more}} refined as time goes on. For Digital, she did not plan {{anything}} in advance; while for Analogue, she worked out the entire design and pacing game in flowcharts before starting. For all of her games, however, she {{does a lot of}} research into the time periods and issues involved. Love <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> that text is necessarily the best way to tell a story in a game, but finds it easier to communicate with it as a writer.|$|E
5|$|Four {{different}} attachment classifications {{have been}} identified in children: secure attachment, anxious-ambivalent attachment, anxious-avoidant attachment, and disorganized attachment. Secure attachment is when children feel they can rely on their caregivers to attend to their needs of proximity, emotional support and protection. It is considered to be the best attachment style. Anxious-ambivalent attachment is when the infant feels separation anxiety when separated from the caregiver and <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> reassured when the caregiver returns to the infant. Anxious-avoidant attachment is when the infant avoids their parents. Disorganized attachment is when {{there is a lack of}} attachment behavior.|$|E
30|$|The subjects’ {{state of}} {{psychological}} stress {{was assessed using}} a questionnaire. The questionnaire consisted of 5 responses, namely, 1, feel very cold; 2, feel somewhat cold; 3, <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> anything; 4, almost <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> cold; 5, <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> cold at all, for questions regarding cold feelings in the hand/foot, hip, and back. The subjects selected {{their perception of the}} current state of their hand, foot, hip, and back from the 5 sections. Similarly, a questionnaire was used to examine the degree of shoulder stiffness.|$|R

5|$|The {{story was}} {{conceived}} around a protagonist whose abilities {{can not be}} measured through standardized evaluation; as such, he is mistakenly categorized as a poor performing student or an irregular. This premise served as a basis for the character, Tatsuya Shiba. Satō has two processes for scripting the story arcs: the first is to create scenarios to have characters behave and interact in certain ways; the second is to plan a scene, then script the story so it leads to that scene. Satō professed that he <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> his characters are alive or have a will of their own when scripting them.|$|E
5|$|Angie (Drea de Matteo) {{takes an}} instant dislike {{to her son}} Danny's (Beau Mirchoff) new girlfriend, Ana (Maiara Walsh), who she fears is too fun-loving and not serious enough. However, Danny feels {{comfortable}} talking to Ana, who seems to understand what he has been through. Ana assures Angie she is not going anywhere. Meanwhile, Katherine (Dana Delany) speaks to her psychiatrist at a mental clinic. She says the medicine is working, but she now realizes the person she has become and how much she has hurt her neighbors and friends. Karen (Kathryn Joosten) visits her and asks {{her to come back}} to Wisteria Lane, but Katherine says she will not come back because she <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> she will be forgiven. Later, Karen returns with Bree, Lynette, Gabrielle and Susan, who comfort Katherine and say they will try to forgive her.|$|E
5|$|As {{the film}} opens a black Ferrari circles on a race {{track in the}} desert, its engine roaring {{in and out of}} the shot. When it {{eventually}} stops, Johnny Marco (Stephen Dorff) steps out. Marco is a Hollywood actor who, despite his recent rise to fame, <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> much meaning in his daily life. He resides at the Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles from where he completes various publicity obligations for his new film: he is photographed with his co-star (Michelle Monaghan), gives interviews to the press, and attends an award ceremony in Italy. Despite drinking and socializing occasionally with Sammy (Chris Pontius), a fellow actor and childhood friend, Marco spends much time alone, driving his Ferrari motorcar, drinking beer, taking pills, and having casual sex with various women. Twice he has pole-dancing twins (Kristina and Karissa Shannon) set up their equipment and perform in his room, the first time he falls asleep and the second routine is more calisthenic than erotic.|$|E

Dot purchases the heroin but Fatboy catches her and urges her to cut ties with Nick. Dot urges Nick to confess to the police, but when he tells her he <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> remorse for Ronnie's injuries, she gives him the drugs and storms out. Dot later finds Nick unconscious, having had a bad reaction to the drugs. When it is clear Nick is dying, Nick confesses various past misdemeanours, including the murder of Reg Cox (Johnnie Clayton). Nick seeks his mother's forgiveness and she cradles him as he dies, ultimately deciding not to call an ambulance to attempt to save his life. Dot, seeking punishment for this, decides to confess {{to the police and}} is arrested and imprisoned. Dot initially decides to plead guilty, believing she should atone for her sins in prison, but when Jim dies, she attends his funeral and realises how much her family needs her. She changes her plea and is cleared of murder at the court hearing; however, she is found guilty of manslaughter and sentenced to prison for 14 months.|$|E

25|$|As a consequence, any {{perception}} of the exterior reality becomes nondual. It becomes possible to live submerged in a continuous state of union with Shiva even while performing regular day-to-day activities. This form of extroverted, all inclusive samādhi is the pinnacle of spiritual evolution, bhairavi mudra, jagadananda or bhava samadhi. The yogi experiences everything as pure light and ecstasy (cit-ananda) and <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> any difference between interior and exterior any more.|$|E
25|$|In 1988 Kuroki visited Italy {{where she}} met Cicciolina, whom she regards as sensei. She was pleased to find that many of their {{opinions}} coincided, but was surprised by Cicciolina's discomfort with Kuroki's masochistic tendencies and preference for the S genre. Kuroki attributes this to cultural and personal differences, and <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> that S equates to submissiveness. Indeed, Fornander points out that Kuroki made AVs in general, and S in particular a feminist issue in Japan.|$|E

If the group size is large, members can feel that their contribution will not be worth much to the overall cause because so many other contributions can or should occur. This leads people to not contribute as much or at all in large groups as they might have in smaller groups.|$|E

Although Allen was {{considered}} to be a better singer than anyone else who had tried out for the role up to that point, he had never auditioned for a film before and has said that he did not feel confident in his acting abilities. In an interview with OK Magazine, Allen said he <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> that {{he would have been a}} good fit for role and currently does not have any further plans to pursue acting.|$|E
25|$|Dana's and Kevin's happy reunion is short-lived, as Kevin has a {{hard time}} {{adjusting}} to the present after living in the past for five years. He shares a few details of his life in the past with Dana: he witnessed stomach-churning atrocities against slaves, traveled farther and farther up north, worked as a teacher, helped slaves escape and had to grow up a beard to disguise himself from a lynch mob. Disconcerted that he <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> happy to be back home, he grows angry and cold. Deciding to let him work his feelings out for himself, Dana packs a bag in case she time travels again.|$|E

25|$|The {{topic of}} animal {{consciousness}} is beset {{with a number}} of difficulties. It poses the problem of other minds in an especially severe form because animals, lacking the ability to use human language, cannot tell us about their experiences. Also, it is difficult to reason objectively about the question, because a denial that an animal is conscious is often taken to imply that it <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel,</b> its life has no value, and that harming it is not morally wrong. The 17th-century French philosopher René Descartes, for example, has sometimes been blamed for mistreatment of animals because he argued that only humans are conscious.|$|E
25|$|Dīkṣā (Sanskrit: दीक्षा). Reṇukā <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> any weight, nor is {{troubled by}} the pregnancy. Jamadagni {{performs}} the Puṃsavana ceremony of Reṇukā, traditionally performed in the eighth month of pregnancy. All good omens happen for Reṇukā. The seven seers (Saptarṣi) bless her and the nine planets become favourable. Reṇukā gives birth to a child {{on the third day}} of the bright half of Vaiśākha month, known as Akṣayatṛtīyā. The deities, seers, and devotees rejoice. On the instruction of Bhṛgu, the child is named as Rāma by Jamadagni. Rāma is very fond of a toy-axe, and so he is also called Paraśurāma. The child tames and plays with wild animals like lions and tigers. Five years pass by, and ten Saṃskāras ("rites of passage") of the child are completed. Then the Upanayana ("sacred thread ceremony") ceremony of Paraśurāma is performed. Brahmā is the giver of the sacred thread, Śiva initiates the child in the Gayatrī Mantra, and Paraśurāma begs Reṇukā for alms. The canto ends with Paraśurāma going to the Kailāsa mountain to learn from his guru Śiva.|$|E
25|$|In {{situations}} where multiple referees disagree substantially {{about the quality}} of a work, {{there are a number of}} strategies for reaching a decision. When a publisher receives very positive and very negative reviews for the same manuscript, the publisher will often solicit one or more additional reviews as a tie-breaker. As another strategy in the case of ties, the publisher may invite authors to reply to a referee's criticisms and permit a compelling rebuttal to break the tie. If a publisher <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> confident to weigh the persuasiveness of a rebuttal, the publisher may solicit a response from the referee who made the original criticism. A publisher may convey communications back and forth between authors and a referee, in effect allowing them to debate a point. Even in these cases, however, publishers do not allow multiple referees to confer with each other, though each reviewer may often see earlier comments submitted by other reviewers. The goal of the process is explicitly not to reach consensus or to persuade anyone to change their opinions, but instead to provide material for an informed editorial decision. Some medical journals, usually following the open access model, have begun posting on the Internet the pre-publication history of each individual article, from the original submission to reviewers' reports, authors' comments, and revised manuscripts.|$|E
