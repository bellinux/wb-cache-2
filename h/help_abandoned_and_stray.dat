From 2012 the cats could be displayed until 8 pm, but in 2016 the guidelines of the environment ministry state that they may visit and play with customers until 10 pm.|$|R

2500|$|In 1997, {{the entire}} Boot Camp came {{together}} {{for the release of}} their first group album, For the People. Unlike Nocturnal and Da Storm, which used Da Beatminerz sparingly, on For the People the group completely <b>abandoned</b> them, <b>and</b> <b>strayed</b> away from their grimy, sample-heavy basement sound. Instead, Boogie Brown and Buckshot laced the album with live instrumentation production. The new sound did not go over well with fans or critics, causing the album to receive lukewarm reviews and disappointing sales. Instead of only focusing on the core Camp members, the album showcased a wide number of the group's affiliates like Illa Noyz and the Representativz, and also featured debut appearances from BJ Swan, LS, The BTJ's and F.L.O.W. The album's lead single, [...] "Headz Are Reddee Pt. 2" [...] b/w [...] "Down by Law" [...] failed to reach any Billboard singles chart.|$|R

40|$|Master of Public HealthPublic Health Interdepartmental ProgramMichael B. CatesMichael B. CatesThe {{issue of}} feral, free-roaming, <b>abandoned</b> <b>and</b> <b>stray</b> cats {{can lead to}} {{volatile}} discussions on how to manage their populations that would in turn reduce {{their impact on the}} environment and lessen risks to public health. The domesticated cat began its association with humans as a hunter of the vermin that threatened our food stores, and has evolved into one of the world’s most popular pets. With that popularity has come a host of problems involving cat over populations namely involving free-roaming cats, owned and unowned. Animal-based organizations are at odds with one another on how to handle these cats that form loose colonies. The cats pose issues to the environment by hunting small animals and birds, sometimes to the point of extinction. Their waste is a source of zoonotic parasites and the colonies can become reservoirs of diseases that can affect human health and the health of other cats. There are organizations that promote programs such as Trap-Neuter-and Return (TNR) as a way to control the numbers of cats but this control measure does not help protect the environment or eliminate the risk of disease. These programs are mostly dependent on volunteers and donations and have not always demonstrated that they are an effective way to control community cat populations. Those that oppose TNR would like to see community cats either euthanized or re-homed. Part of the problem may lie in lack of knowledge on the issues surrounding community cats. In order to measure the awareness of community cat issues, a survey was prepared and sent out to veterinarians in the mid-west and to other animal welfare and public health officials located nationwide. The survey results showed that many respondents were not aware of their own organization’s policies or statements pertaining to community cats or that they were overly concerned with the risks associated with community cats. Those individuals involved with animal care, welfare and regulation {{need to be aware of}} all the issues surrounding community cats so that in turn, they can enlighten their clients and the public as to the risks they are exposed to with a community cat colony in their neighborhood and also to risks community cats face everyday living outside of a loving home...|$|R
40|$|It {{seems that}} the dog {{overpopulation}} in Belgrade {{is similar to that}} of many other cities in the world. However, Belgrade does not have problems with inhumane stray dogs' population control methods, nor with their malnutrition, nor with inadequate veterinary care. Moreover, Belgrade has a problem with irresponsible and uneducated dog owners, <b>stray</b> <b>and</b> <b>abandoned</b> dogs on the streets and many unlicensed private animal shelters. The next problem is the existence of only one municipal shelter for <b>abandoned,</b> relinquished pets <b>and</b> <b>stray</b> dogs <b>and</b> cats in Belgrade. The first aim of the study was to estimate the total number and the ratio of dogs that were relinquished to the municipal shelter for adoption and for euthanasia in the period from 1 st January 2004 to 31 st December 2007. The second aim of the study was to estimate the main reasons for relinquishment of owned dogs for adoption and reasons for euthanasia in the municipal shelter in Belgrade. The most owned dogs were relinquished for euthanasia (N= 1005; 86. 563 %). Only 156 dogs (13. 437 %) were relinquished for adoption. Therefore, the number of relinquished dogs for euthanasia was significantly higher than the number of relinquished dogs for adoption (P< 0. 001). Financial problems were the most frequently given reasons for relinquishment of dogs to the municipal shelter for adoption (26. 92 %). The leading cause of relinquishment of dogs to the municipal shelter for euthanasia was incurable illness of aged dogs (25. 77 %) ...|$|R
