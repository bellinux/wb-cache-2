25|$|In {{the example}} above, the four input {{variables}} {{can be combined}} in 16 different ways, so the truth table has 16 rows, and the <b>Karnaugh</b> <b>map</b> has 16 positions. The <b>Karnaugh</b> <b>map</b> is therefore arranged in a 4×4 grid.|$|E
25|$|The {{row and column}} indices (shown {{across the}} top, and down {{the left side of}} the <b>Karnaugh</b> <b>map)</b> are ordered in Gray code rather than binary {{numerical}} order. Gray code ensures that only one variable changes between each pair of adjacent cells. Each cell of the completed <b>Karnaugh</b> <b>map</b> contains a binary digit representing the function's output for that combination of inputs.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Karnaugh</b> <b>map</b> {{reduces the}} need for {{extensive}} calculations {{by taking advantage of}} humans' pattern-recognition capability. It also permits the rapid identification and elimination of potential race conditions.|$|E

25|$|<b>Karnaugh</b> <b>maps</b> {{are used}} to {{facilitate}} the simplification of Boolean algebra functions. For example, consider the Boolean function described by the following truth table.|$|R
50|$|Gray {{codes are}} also used in {{labelling}} the axes of <b>Karnaugh</b> <b>maps</b> {{as well as in}} Händler circle graphs, both graphical methods for logic circuit minimization.|$|R
25|$|Once the <b>Karnaugh</b> <b>map</b> {{has been}} {{constructed}} and the adjacent 1s linked by rectangular and square boxes, the algebraic minterms {{can be found}} by examining which variables stay the same within each box.|$|E
25|$|After the <b>Karnaugh</b> <b>map</b> {{has been}} constructed, {{it is used}} to find one of the {{simplest}} possible forms — a canonical form — for the information in the truth table. Adjacent 1s in the <b>Karnaugh</b> <b>map</b> represent opportunities to simplify the expression. The minterms ('minimal terms') for the final expression are found by encircling groups of 1s in the map. Minterm groups must be rectangular and must have an area that is a power of two (i.e., 1,2,4,8…). Minterm rectangles should be as large as possible without containing any 0s. Groups may overlap in order to make each one larger. The optimal groupings in the example below are marked by the green, red and blue lines, and the red and green groups overlap. The red group is a 2×2 square, the green group is a 4×1 rectangle, and the overlap area is indicated in brown.|$|E
25|$|The DE-9IM {{offers a}} full {{descriptive}} assertion {{about the two}} input geometries. It is a mathematical function that represents {{a complete set of}} all possible relations about two entities, like a Truth table, the Three-way comparison, a <b>Karnaugh</b> <b>map</b> or a Venn diagram. Each output value is like a truth table line, that represent relations of specific inputs.|$|E
50|$|Design {{techniques}} such as <b>Karnaugh</b> <b>maps</b> encourage designers to recognize and eliminate race conditions before they cause problems. Often logic redundancy {{can be added to}} eliminate some kinds of races.|$|R
25|$|<b>Karnaugh</b> <b>maps</b> {{are used}} to simplify {{real-world}} logic requirements {{so that they can}} be implemented using a minimum number of physical logic gates. A sum-of-products expression can always be implemented using AND gates feeding into an OR gate, and a product-of-sums expression leads to OR gates feeding an AND gate. <b>Karnaugh</b> <b>maps</b> can also be used to simplify logic expressions in software design. Boolean conditions, as used for example in conditional statements, can get very complicated, which makes the code difficult to read and to maintain. Once minimised, canonical sum-of-products and product-of-sums expressions can be implemented directly using AND and OR logic operators.|$|R
50|$|The {{roots of}} logic {{synthesis}} {{can be traced}} to the treatment of logic by George Boole (1815 to 1864), in what is now termed Boolean algebra. In 1938, Claude Shannon showed that the two-valued Boolean algebra can describe the operation of switching circuits. In the early days, logic design involved manipulating the truth table representations as <b>Karnaugh</b> <b>maps.</b> The <b>Karnaugh</b> map-based minimization of logic is guided by a set of rules on how entries in the maps can be combined. A human designer can typically only work with <b>Karnaugh</b> <b>maps</b> containing up to four to six variables.|$|R
25|$|The <b>Karnaugh</b> <b>map</b> (KM or K-map) is {{a method}} of {{simplifying}} Boolean algebra expressions. Maurice Karnaugh introduced it in 1953 as a refinement of Edward Veitch's 1952 Veitch chart, which actually was a rediscovery of Allan Marquand's 1881 logical diagram aka Marquand diagram but with a focus now set on its utility for switching circuits. Veitch charts are therefore also known as Marquand–Veitch diagrams, and Karnaugh maps as Karnaugh–Veitch maps (KV maps).|$|E
25|$|Karnaugh {{maps are}} useful for {{detecting}} and eliminating race conditions. Race hazards are very easy to spot using a <b>Karnaugh</b> <b>map,</b> because a race condition may exist when moving between any pair of adjacent, but disjoint, regions circumscribed on the map. However, {{because of the nature}} of Gray coding, adjacent has a special definition explained above - we're in fact moving on a torus, rather than a rectangle, wrapping around the top, bottom, and the sides.|$|E

40|$|For minimisation {{of logical}} functions, {{laws of the}} Boolean algebra and the <b>Karnaugh</b> <b>maps</b> are mostly used. However, use of <b>Karnaugh's</b> <b>maps</b> is based on visual {{recognition}} of adjacent cells for functions {{with no more than}} 6 variables and, therefore, the method is not suitable for automated processing on computers. A direct application of the Boolean algebra laws is not restricted in this way, but there is no general algorithm defining the sequence of their application and thus this approach is not suitable for computer implementation either.
