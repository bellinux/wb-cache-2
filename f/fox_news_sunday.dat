40|$|Too often critics treat <b>Fox</b> <b>News's</b> populist {{brand and}} voice, {{its claim to}} stick up for the little guy as a gimmicky type of charlatanism {{that is used to}} convey simple and {{misleading}} news stories. However, in this dissertation, I demonstrate how <b>Fox</b> <b>News's</b> populist journalistic style is in fact a sophisticated and complex form of political communication, one that requires great performative skill to embody, a deep knowledge of traditional political discourses, and an astute awareness of the key social and cultural cleavages active in a given historical moment. To capture the complexity of <b>Fox</b> <b>News's</b> populist mode of address, in this study, I conduct a critical-textual analysis of <b>Fox</b> <b>News's</b> top three programs during the late- 2000 s Recession : Glenn Beck, Hannity, and The O'Reilly Factor. This involves a close reading of the "imagined community" <b>Fox</b> <b>News's</b> style is designed to address and how its style is crafted to create a political identity for viewers. While partisan identification with the Republican Party and political conservatism defines the broadest parameters of Fox's imagined community, the real power and ideological utility of <b>Fox</b> <b>News's</b> mode of address, I argue, derive from its cultural referents, particularly, how it aligns deep moral values and social archetypes from the American populist rhetorical tradition with the political right, marking populism as conservative. In {{the first half of this}} dissertation, I develop a theoretical model for interpreting <b>Fox</b> <b>News's</b> unique populist address, which includes an analysis of how <b>Fox</b> <b>News's</b> top programs attempt to draw symbolic linkages between political conservatism and the white working- class. In the second half of the dissertation, I demonstrate the power of this rhetorical approach by showing how <b>Fox</b> <b>News's</b> top programs framed news about the late- 2000 s Recession to fashion a conservative economic agend...|$|R

500|$|During {{the first}} year {{following}} the election defeat, Romney generally kept a low profile, with his ordinary daily activities around San Diego being captured via social media glimpses.

He again expressed regret at the [...] "47 percent" [...] remark, saying [...] "There's no question that hurt and did real damage to my campaign."

[...] It's just incredible that anybody could embrace this guy." [...] As for his reputation as a womanizer, Trump said he would not run if he believed it would be an impediment. [...] The next day, Trump formally joined the Reform Party, changing his voter registration from Republican to Independence Party, the New York affiliate of the Reform Party. [...] On the same day, Buchanan announced that he too would leave the Republican Party to join with the Reform Party and attempt to obtain its presidential nomination. Buchanan said he refused to engage in a [...] "name-calling" [...] contest with Trump but made a thinly veiled attack against Trump's wealth, arguing, [...] "I don't believe the Reform Party nomination can be bought, and I don't believe the Presidency can be bought." [...] On Face the Nation, Pat Choate, the Reform Party's 1996 vice presidential nominee, said Trump would [...] "make a good candidate," [...] but argued that Buchanan could challenge Trump [...] "on the merits" [...] and that Trump and the media were misrepresenting Buchanan's views through [...] "hate politics." [...] Other party members expressed reservations about Trump's comments and personal life. [...] Verney wondered [...] "what the compelling reason is for him to seek the presidency." [...] Trump acknowledged himself as [...] "certainly controversial" [...] but labeled himself as [...] "a great businessman," [...] who would [...] "make the greatest treaties that this country's seen in a long time." [...] On <b>Fox</b> <b>News</b> <b>Sunday,</b> he criticized U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky and said that as president he himself would fill the position and negotiate trade deals with other countries.
