Eichberg was also distrusted for his meetings with Muammar al-Gaddafi. Eichberg was said to act as [...] "godfather" [...] for a certain anti-American and <b>anti-capitalist</b> <b>left</b> wing - German Social Democrats (SPD), Socialists and Greens -, who followed a hidden right-wing, nationalist agenda.

50|$|An ideologically {{heterogeneous}} coalition, the FG {{has been}} described as a communist, left-wing, radical <b>left,</b> anti-liberal <b>left,</b> <b>anti-capitalist</b> <b>left</b> or far-left party. Jean-Luc Mélenchon himself has said that he does not consider himself of the far-left, and the far-left label has primarily been used for strategic reasons by the right. Marc Dolez, a former PG deputy who left Mélenchon's party in December 2012 while remaining active in the FG, claimed that Mélenchon and the FG's strategy of attacking the PS has 'cornered' the FG on the far-left. Political journalists and analysts including Vincent Tiberj and Laurent de Boissieu recused the far-left label for the FG, although some far-left parties are part of the alliance. Some political analysts believe that the 'far-left' is used by the right-wing UMP for strategic reasons - for the purposes of attacking the PS and justifying potential rapprochements between the UMP and the FN.|$|R

There was support for the inclusion of the Central Council representative of the Left Front in an advisory capacity. In turn, the Left Front will include in its Executive Committee one representative from the unified organization with an advisory vote. This kind of exchange of ambassadors in the governing bodies of two of the key actors of the Russian left is intended to demonstrate a broad alliance, and the seriousness of the left's intentions of unification.|$|R
40|$|April 2011 The crisis {{laid bare}} the {{historical}} divergences within Europe, {{and led to}} a European crisis and a new stage in the global crisis. The existing policies in Europe has three fundamental flaws: First, they assume that the problem is a lack of fiscal discipline and repeats the old faith in strengthening the surveillance of budget deficits; it does not question the reasons behind the deficits; it ignores all the structural problems regarding divergence in productivity, and imbalances in current accounts due to the “beggar my neighbour ” policies of Germany. Second, they are based on the argument that Europe has a sovereign debt crisis, which ignores the fact that public debt would not have increased at the current rates {{if it were not for}} the financial crisis, which was prevented by unprecedented bank rescue packages; which in turn increased the budget deficits along with loss in tax revenues and increased social spending because of the crisis. Third, they deny the underlying reason behind the current crisis, which was increased inequality in the distribution of income and wealth –a fundamental feature of neoliberal capitalism. Emerging consensus within the <b>anti-capitalist</b> <b>left</b> A consensus among the anti-capitalist forces for a strategy against the crisis is emerging across Europe around four pillars: i) resistance against austerity policies and all cuts, ii) a radically progressive/redistributive tax system and capital controls iii) nationalization/socialization and democratic control of banks, iv) debt audit under democratic control followed by default. These demands find their echo also among a broader left opposition, albeit in a descending order according to support. I find it crucial to start any tactical debate within the <b>anti-capitalist</b> <b>left</b> by emphasizing these four pillars as an extremely positive and important starting point to build a coordinated campaign across Europe. How about the Euro? The controversial issue of the Euro in the peripheral countries of Europe must be contextualized in the background of the above common points. There are two positions within the anti-capitalist left: a position, which promotes the exit from the Eurozone as suggested by e. g. Lapavitsas et al. (2010) or de Santos (2011), and a position, a...|$|R
25|$|A {{peaceful}} protest rally by tens of thousands, protest organizers estimated {{their numbers}} at 50,000, while police {{put it at}} 15,000, originating at Pushkin Square was held in Moscow on 12 June 2012, Russia Day. The rally was preceded by soaking rain; there was a thunderstorm after a few hours. Protest activities fell within {{the conditions of the}} permit which had been issued by the authorities. A call by Sergei Udaltsov to march on the Investigative Committee of Russia which had raided organizers' homes on 11 June was rejected by other protest organizers. The protest rally defied an atmosphere of intimidation and repression fostered by the Putin administration: The previous day, police had raided the homes of various opposition leaders and called them in for interrogation an hour before the protest was due to start on 12 June: Alexei Navalny, Ilya Yashin and Ksenia Sobchak all attended the interrogations. The rally was also the first to follow a new law passed in June 2012 to punish protesters with larger fines. Participation in the protest was diverse, united only by opposition to Putin; in addition to the revolutionary <b>anti-capitalist</b> <b>Left</b> Front led by Sergei Udaltsov, black-clad Russian nationalists and liberals sporting white ribbons participated despite expressing mutual disdain.|$|R

As a result of this analysis of anti-semitism, support for Israel and opposition to Anti-Zionism is a primary unifying factor of the Anti-German movement.

50|$|Podemos {{came from}} the {{aftermath}} of the Indignados movement against inequality and corruption in 2011. Its origin {{can be found in the}} manifesto Mover ficha: convertir la indignación en cambio político (Move a piece: turn indignation into political change), presented over the weekend of 12 to 13 January 2014, which was signed by thirty intellectuals and personalities, such as Juan Carlos Monedero, associate professor of political science at the Complutense University of Madrid (UCM); the actor Alberto San Juan; Jaime Pastor, associate professor of political science at the National University of Distance Education (UNED); the writer and philosopher Santiago Alba Rico; the former leader of the Left Trade Union Current Cándido González Carnero; and Bibiana Medialdea, associate professor of applied economy at the UCM. This manifesto argued that it was necessary to create a party list for the European Parliament elections that year, with the goal of opposing the dominant policies of the EU from the left. Even though he was not one of the signatories of the document, on 14 January it was announced that Pablo Iglesias, a professor of political science at the UCM and a TV presenter, was to head the movement. The movement was organized by the party <b>Anti-Capitalist</b> <b>Left</b> (Izquierda Anticapitalista), the Spanish section of the Trotskyist Fourth International, which had written the Mover ficha manifesto in its internal documentation, designing the stages to launch the new movement. One of the points highlighted by Iglesias was the derogation of the 135th article of the Constitution (which was made in 2011 by the major parties People's Party (PP) and Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE)); full application of the 128th article of the constitution ("All wealth of the country in all its forms and no matter who owns it, is subordinated to the people's interest"); and maintaining abortion rights.
