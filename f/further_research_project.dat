40|$|International audienceMarine storm {{events are}} very {{often the most}} devastating {{meteorological}} hazards. Their impact on coastal areas participates to the global increase of risks linked to the sea. The oriental plain of Corsica is a sandy low lying area particularly exposed to storm events. However, the phenomenon remains poorly understood {{mainly because of the}} quasi-absence of storm-specific datasets. In this context, a two years research program was undertaken to obtain storm-specific information and evaluate the exposition of the coastal plain of Corsica to hazards induced by storm events. A complete database on storm characteristics (simulated hydrodynamics conditions) and storm impacts was established, and a very precise DTM obtained. These datasets are crucial for the knowledge and the anticipation of coastal hazards, and they are available for any <b>further</b> <b>research</b> <b>project</b> or for management purposes.

It has obviously affected <b>further</b> <b>research</b> <b>project</b> for Blended-wing-body (BWB) aircraft configuration characteristics. Searching for a safety improvement is an urgent requirement in the development work of the RPV. Combining with vehicle characteristics, a new systemic method called System-Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA) has been imported to apply on the RPV flight experiment hazard analysis. An uncontrolled system behavior “path sagging phenomenon” is identified by implementing a 3 degree of freedom simulation based on wind tunnel experiment data and establishing landing safety system dynamics archetype, then a derived safety improvement requirement emerges. To obtain higher safety design effectiveness and considering safety design precedence, a new longitudinal control surface “belly-flap” is used to eliminate hazards in landing. Finally, Flight experiments show that the hazardous factor has been correctly identified and the landing safety has been efficiently improved...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the challenges and}} conditions of a sustainability transition of suburban areas in Wallonia (Belgium), articulated around energy efficiency in the building and in the transportation sectors. Three scenarios focused {{on the evolution of}} the existing building stock are modelled and assessed (the insulation of buildings, an increase in the built density and demolition / reconstruction). Our main findings show that, beyond the traditional polarization of the debates on energy efficiency of our built environment between the “compact city” and the “sprawled city”, a new pragmatic paradigm, focused on the transition of suburban areas by “densification”, can make suburban areas evolve towards more sustainability. However, these main results focused on energy efficiency need to be studied in a larger framework to concretely operationalize a suburban sustainability transition.

These defects are mostly detected with handheld ultrasonic testing (UT) or X-ray analysis. Within a research project done at the Fraunhofer Institute for Structural Durability and System Reliability LBF, the fatigue of Dross, shrinkages and chunky graphite in thick-walled cast material GGG- 40 was estimated based on X-ray and fatigue tests on bending specimens.

40|$|Abstract The {{purpose of}} this study was to study the {{vaccination}} status of slaughtered horses in Finland. Database of slaughtered horses from Hippos (The Finnish Trotting and Breeding Association) was analyzed and some statistics were calculated. Slaughtered horses (n = 1863) were divided into groups of vaccinated and unvaccinated and, further, into subgroups of regularly and irregularly vaccinated. Age and sex distribution of each group was defined. Differences between these groups defined by vaccination status, age and sex were calculated by χ- test and t-test. The principal results showed a majority of unvaccinated horses (n = 1030, 55 %), but when vaccinated they were mostly vaccinated according to the recommendations (n = 697, 84 %). Combination of equine influenza and tetanus was mostly favored and all horses were vaccinated against equine influenza. The age of a horse was a critical factor in determining vaccination routines. In conclusion, the nonchalance of some horse owners and the susceptible nature of the horse population in Finland were suspected.

A total of 22 studies were identified. These were mainly questionnaires directed to staff and contributed little to areas of National Priority (other than ‘building research capacity’). Thirteen nurses were identified who were still at the Trust and for whom there was a current contact postal or email address.

40|$|Purpose: To {{research}} the change management processes used to implement ‘world class’ improvements {{in a major}} aerospace company, BAE SYSTEMS, and to propose a model for process improvement in the wider aerospace sector. Design/methodology/approach: The research was undertaken as a longitudinal study {{over a period of}} five years. A variety of research methodologies were used at various stages of the research including action research and observation. Semi-structured and unstructured interviews were used to gather qualitative data along with documentary evidence of the processes being used. Findings: There are three key findings. Firstly, an understanding of the production stages in the aerospace sector: future project; new product; sustain and return to work. Secondly details of a matrix-based approach and the issues regarding its implementation in a large organisation are discussed. Thirdly, a generic set of principles to aid process improvement in the aerospace sector is proposed. Research limitations/implications: Given that the study is based in one company, there are issues regarding the generalisation of the results. A potential <b>further</b> <b>research</b> <b>project</b> would entail the implementation of the proposed generic principles in another aerospace organisation. Practical implications: For BAE SYSTEMS, this research project aided their understanding of the issues involved in rolling out a process improvement program in a large organisation.

40|$|As {{a result}} of our {{research}} realized in the framework of the Erasmus Thematic Network (ERIC) we received serious indications that neither the cultural contexts of technology, let alone intercultural issues are taken seriously in technological/scientific education and training. This is the more surprising since many technological and business failures have provided proof enough that technology does not exist independently of the cultures in which it operates. Cultural issues {{have an impact on the}} attitudes towards technology, a society's willingness to accept technological and scientific development, and even on technological development itself. While a great deal of research has been done on the social and environmental results of technological development the relevance of culture for technology and of technology for culture have been much less explored. This paper presents the outcomes of the ERIC project and starts on a theoretical analysis of the views of the relationship between science/technology and their cultural contexts, the relevance of cultural factors in technological projects and the needs for cultural sensitivity in technology.

The unique attributes of the ID population and a core lack of training for health professionals in the ID field {{has resulted in a}} large number of practitioners feeling under-trained and under-resourced to carry out this role effectively, to the potential detriment of the ID population. The challenges health practitioners experience when diagnosing co-morbid mental health disorders in individuals with ID and how they overcome these challenges was explored in this study. Participants were health practitioners of varying professions, including Psychiatrists, Clinical Psychologists and General Practitioners. Health practitioners completed an online survey and/or partook in a focus group or individual interview. The method used in this research was thematic analysis. The study found that health practitioners use holistic and contextual approaches to carry out assessments of individuals with ID, utilise ID specific tools, and liaise with experienced, specialised health practitioners as ways of dealing with the complexity of diagnosing co-morbid mental health difficulties in individuals with ID. In addition, it is recommended that more training in the ID area is provided for health practitioners, particularly for GPs in light of recent policy changes with emphasis of assessment and treatment occurring at the primary health level and for best practice guidelines to be developed.

40|$|Alternative Energy Sources is {{designed}} to give the reader, {{a clear view of}} the role each form of alternative energy may play in supplying the energy needs of the human society in the near and intermediate future (20 - 50 years).   The two first chapters on energy demand and supply and environmental effects, set the tone as to why the widespread use of alternative energy is essential for the future of human society. The third chapter exposes the reader to the laws of energy conversion processes, as well as the limitations of converting one energy form to another. The sections on exergy give a succinct, quantitative background on the capability/potential of each energy source to produce power on a global scale. The fourth, fifth and sixth chapters are expositions of fission and fusion nuclear energy. The following five chapters (seventh to eleventh) include detailed descriptions of the most common renewable energy sources – wind, solar, geothermal, biomass, hydroelectric – and some of the less common sources, such as tidal and wave energy. The emphasis of these chapters is on the global potential of each source; the engineering/technical systems that are currently used in harnessing the potential of each one of these energy sources; the technological developments that will contribute to wider utilization of the sources; and the environmental effects associated with their current and their wider use. The last three chapters are: energy storage, which is the main limitation of the wider use of solar and wind power and will become an important issue if renewable energy sources are to be used widely; energy conservation, which appears to be everyone’s favorite issue, but by itself is not a solution to our energy challenge; and energy economics, a necessary consideration in market-driven economies.   The fourteen chapters in the book have been chosen so that one may fit a semester University course around this book.
