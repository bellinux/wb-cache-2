40|$|The Echiura, or spoon worms, are a {{group of}} marine worms, most of which live in burrows in soft sediments. This annelid-like animal group was once {{considered}} as a separate phylum because {{of the absence of}} segmentation, although recent molecular analyses have placed it within the annelids. In this study, we elucidate the interfamily relationships of echiuran worms and their evolutionary pattern of feeding mode and sexual dimorphism, by performing molecular phylogenetic analyses using four genes (18 S, 28 S, H 3, and COI) of representatives of all extant echiuran families. Our results suggest that Echiura is monophyletic and comprises two unexpected groups: [Echiuridae+Urechidae+Thalassematidae] and [Bonelliidae+Ikedidae]. This grouping agrees with the presence/absence of marked sexual dimorphism involving dwarf males and the paired/non-paired configuration of the gonoducts (genital sacs). Furthermore, the data supports the sister group relationship of <b>Echiuridae</b> and Urechidae. These two families share the character of having anal chaetae rings around the posterior trunk as a synapomorphy. The analyses also suggest that deposit feeding is a basal feeding mode in echiurans and that filter feeding originated once in the common ancestor of Urechidae. Overall, our results contradict the currently accepted order-level classification, especially in that Echiuroinea is polyphyletic, and provide novel insights into the evolution of echiuran worms...|$|E
40|$|The {{southern}} African echiuran fauna currently comprises two families, four genera and eighteen species. The taxonomic {{positions of}} three other species, one of Ochetostoma {{and two of}} Thalassema, remain to be resolved. Of the recorded species, three are new to science and a further five are new records for the southern African region. This survey reveals that there are ten species of Ochetostoma, four of Thalassema and three of Anelassorhynchus. The family <b>Echiuridae</b> contains a single genus, Echiurus and in southern Africa, E. antarcticus is the only species recorded to date. Full descriptions of the new species and those formerly inadequately described are given. The diagnoses of some others are modified and, where necessary, additional notes added. Keys for the identification of families, genera and species are provided and the taxonomic characters are evaluated and discussed. The zoogeographic distribution of the southern African species is mapped and an attempt {{has been made to}} analyse the recorded species on the basis of faunistic provinces. The phylogenetic position of the Echiura in the system of the animal kingdom is discussed. The lack of any form of segmentation of the mesodermal bands during embryonic developnent seems to justify their status as a separate phylum. The biomechanics of burrowing, locomotion and trunk irrigatory movements of Ochetostoma caudex are described and compared with the activities of some other animals with unsegmented coelomic cavities. Pressure changes within the coelom have been measured with the use of electronic recording techniques and the results interpreted in relation to direct visual observation. The anatomy of the reproductive system and the process of gametogenesis in O. caudex have been investigated with light and electron microscopes. Some observations on aspects of breeding behaviour and spawning are also included...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe first {{description}} of the cleavage program of the palaeonemertean Carinoma tremaphoros (a member of a basal clade of the Nemertea) is illustrated by confocal microscopy and microinjection and compared to development of more derived nemerteans and other eutrochozoans (Annelida, Mollusca, Sipunculida and <b>Echiurida).</b> Lineage tracers were injected into individual blastomeres of C. tremaphoros at the 2 -, 4 -, 8 - and 16 -cell stage. Subsequent development was followed {{to the formation of}} simple (so-called planuliform) planktonic larvae to establish the ultimate fates of the blastomeres. Results of labeling experiments demonstrate that the development of C. tremaphoros bears closer similarity to other Eutrochozoa than development of a previously studied hoplonemertean (Nemertopsis bivittata) and a heteronemertean (Cerebratulus lacteus) in that the first cleavage plane bears an invariant relationship to the plane of bilateral symmetry of the larval body. Additionally, our cell-labeling experiments support the earlier suggestion that the transitory pre-oral belt of cells in the larvae of C. tremaphoros corresponds to the prototroch of other Eutrochozoa. A unique feature of development of C. tremaphoros includes the oblique orientation of the trochal lineages with respect to the anterior–posterior axis of the larva. The significance and application of cleavage characters such as presence of molluscan vs. annelid cross for phylogenetic analyses is reviewed. We argue that molluscan or annelid cross, neither of which are present in nemerteans, are merely two out of much greater variety of patterns created by the differences in the relative size and timing of formation of micromere quartets and none can be considered, by itself, as evidence of close phylogenetic relationship between phyla...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Annelida {{is one of}} {{the major}} protostome phyla, whose deep {{phylogeny}} is very poorly understood. Recent molecular phylogenies show that Annelida may include groups once considered separate phyla (Pogonophora, <b>Echiurida,</b> and Sipunculida) and that Clitellata are derived polychaetes. SThe "total-evidence" analyses combining morphological and molecular characters have been published for a few annelid taxa. No attempt has yet been made to analyse simultaneously morphological and molecular information concerning the Annelida as a whole. Results Phylogenetic relationships within Annelida were analysed on the basis of 93 morphological characters and sequences of six genes (18 S, 28 S, and 16 S rRNA, EF 1 α, H 3, COI), altogether, 87 terminals of all annelid "families" and 3, 903 informative characters, by Bayesian and maximum-parsimony methods. The analysis of the combined dataset yields the following scheme of relationships: Phyllodocida and Eunicida are monophyletic groups, together probably forming monophyletic Aciculata (incl. Orbiniidae and Parergodrilidae that form a sister group of the Eunicida). The traditional "Scolecida" and "Canalipalpata" are both polyphyletic, forming instead two clades: one including Cirratuliformia and the "sabelloid-spionoid clade" (incl. Sternaspis, Sabellidae-Serpulidae, Sabellariidae, Spionida s. str.), the other ("terebelloid-capitelloid clade") including Terebelliformia, Arenicolidae-Maldanidae, and Capitellidae-Echiurida. The Clitellata and "clitellate-like polychaetes" (Aeolosomatidae, Potamodrilidae, Hrabeiella) form a monophyletic group. The position of the remaining annelid groups is uncertain – the most problematic taxa are the Opheliidae-Scalibregmatidae clade, the Amphinomida- Aberranta clade, Apistobranchus, Chaetopteridae, Myzostomida, the Sipunculida-Dinophilidae clade, and the "core Archiannelida" (= Protodrilidae, Nerillidae, Polygordiidae, Saccocirridae). Conclusion The combined ("total-evidence") phylogenetic analysis provides a modified view of annelid evolution, with several higher-level taxa, i. e. Phyllodocida, Eunicida, orbinioid-parergodrilid clade (OPC), Cirratuliformia, sabelloid-spionoid clade (SSC), terebelloid-capitelloid clade (TCC), and "Clitellatomorpha". Two unorthodox clades, the "core Archiannelida" and Sipunculida-Dinophilidae, are proposed. Although the deep-level evolutionary relationships of Annelida remain poorly understood, we propose the monophyly of the Aciculata, sister-group relationships between the Eunicida and OPC, between the Cirratuliformia and SSC, and possibly also between the "Clitellatomorpha" and Oweniidae-Pogonophora clades. </p...|$|R
40|$|During a {{synoptic}} survey {{carried out}} in April-May 1986, 171 localities were sampled in the North Sea as delimited by the Straits of Dover {{in the south and}} approximately by the 100 m isobath in the north. Meiobenthos included Nematoda, Copepoda, Turbellaria, Gastrotricha, Polychaeta, Oligochaeta, Priapulida, Kinorhyncha, Ostracoda, Halacarida, Isopoda, Tanaidacea, Bryozoa, Cnidaria, Sipunculida, <b>Echiurida,</b> Nemertini and Tardigrada. Nematodes were the dominant group in virtually all stations, their densities ranging from 61 to 4167 individuals. 10 cm - 2. Only in the Southern Bight, where nematode numbers were low, did harpacticoids sometimes represent the dominant meiobenthic taxon. There was a tendency for nematode (and total meiobenthos) density to increase towards the north. A total of 278 copepod species belonging to 105 genera and 22 families were identified. Over 40 % of the species were new to science; new taxa were found particularly among the interstitial families which were most important in terms of species diversity. Copepod density decreased rapidly to the north and this trend was followed by diversity. Individual ash-free dry weight (AFDW) was determined for 98 species of copepod. Total biomass reached a peak in the south (low mean individual AFDW, high density) and in the north (high mean individual AFDW, low density), but was low in the Central North Sea where the copepod communities were impoverished both qualitatively and quantitatively. Using the classification technique TWINSPAN (two-way indicator species analysis), it was impossible to define meaningful clusters (TWIN groups) {{on the basis of the}} l 8 major meiobenthic taxa. However, seven distinct communities could be recognized on the basis of the copepod composition: (I) TWIN A largely coincided with the Southern Bight and showed high densities of predominantly interstitial species (Cylindropsyllidae, Paramesochridae, Cyclopinidae) and a few characteristic taxa from coarse sediments; (2) TWIN B was found in the coastal zone of the Netherlands, Germany and Denmark, and in the Dogger Bank, and was dominated by large Ectinosomatidae and Ameiridae, and by interstitial Leptastacidae; (3) TWIN C represented an impoverished community north of the Dogger Bank and consisted of large mud-dwelling species belonging to the Diosaccidae, Laophontidae and Ameiridae; (4) between the Scottish coast and Norwegian Deeps and in the Silver Pits Zosimidae, Cletodidae and Idyanthidae were the most important families (TWIN D); (5) TWIN E grouped the Norwegian Deeps, Devirs Hole and Farne Deep and showed a typical deepwater fauna represented by Ancorabolidae, Cerviniidae, Stenocopiinae and bathyal cletodid genera. Two minor clusters (a, 13) coincided with the Dutch Wadden Sea (1 station) and the river outlets (Thames, Wash, Meuse/Scheldt) whose meiobenthos is subject to pollutants. Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) clearly separated the five major twin groups. TWIN A-C were significantly correlated with sediment and could be arranged along a gradient of decreasing median grain size and increasing silt/clay content. TWIN D was clearly related to latitude whilst TWIN E showed a clear preference for depth...|$|R
