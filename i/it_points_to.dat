25|$|After 1997, when PRI {{lost control}} of the legislature, female activists and victims’ {{relatives}} in Chihuahua convinced the state government to create special law enforcement divisions to address disappearances and deaths of women in Ciudad Juarez. Success in the state legislature led to a similar law at the national level, which also aimed at investigating and prosecution of Dirty War and narco-trafficking disappearances. By 2004 the violence toward women had escalated to the point that María Marcela Lagarde y de los Ríos introduced the term femicide, originally coined in the United States, to Latin American audiences to refer to abductions, death and disappearances of women and girls which is allowed by the state and happens with impunity. In 2006, the Mexican Congress adopted the term accepting that <b>it</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> the State's responsibility and in 2009 the Inter-American Court of Human Rights issued a verdict against Mexico condemning the failure to protect hundreds of murdered women in Ciudad Juarez.|$|E

President Roosevelt and Secretary Morgenthau sent letters of appreciation for her service. The New York Times carried word of her retirement, but no interview, and a week later editorialized that [...] "there is modernity here, too.

500|$|Reviewers {{were more}} {{critical}} concerning the game's sound. Although {{the quality of}} the musical compositions was praised, both RPGFan and RPGamer found that there were too few adequately long tracks, with mediocre ambient sound effects to fill the dead time, and Scary Larry complained of the player character's dog [...] "constantly" [...] barking. Super Play and GamePro both found that the game was not up to the standards held by other Square games. Others argued that Secret of Evermore was a decent first attempt by the American team. Game Players anticipated another game from the same development team, and a critic for Next Generation said that while the game suffered from a number of amateur mistakes, [...] "as a debut title for a new team of designers, <b>it</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> a rosy future".|$|E

500|$|The {{molecular}} phylogeny of the Chiroptera is controversial, as <b>it</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> a microbat paraphyly, which implies that some seemingly unlikely transformations occurred. The {{first is that}} laryngeal echolocation evolved twice in bats, once in Yangochiroptera and once in the rhinolophoids. The second is that laryngeal echolocation had a single origin in Chiroptera, was subsequently lost in the family Pteropodidae (all megabats), and later evolved as a system of tongue-clicking in the genus Rousettus. Analyses of the sequence of the [...] "vocalization" [...] gene, FoxP2, were inconclusive as to whether laryngeal echolocation was secondarily lost in the pteropodids or independently gained in the echolocating lineages. However, analyses of the [...] "hearing" [...] gene, Prestin, seemed to favor the idea that echolocation developed independently at least twice, rather than there being a secondary loss in the pteropodids.|$|E
500|$|Christopher Palmer, of La Trobe University, {{has written}} on the postmodern {{literary}} themes of Dick's early short stories, analyzing stories in which [...] "breakdown and ignorance" [...] {{are the result of}} social upheaval. Palmer proposed that Dick often created post-apocalyptic scenarios of ruined worlds which held high tech gadgets in an attempt to present a view of postmodern materialism. Common to many of Dick's short stories were settings in which the outgrowth of modernity is a world where that which is natural is in ruin, and what is artificial is reshaped through science into a fantastically high tech form. [...] Palmer presented [...] "The Last of the Masters" [...] as an example of this, as well as [...] "The Variable Man" [...] and The Penultimate Truth, two other post-apocalyptic works by Dick. Palmer contended that these shared themes were [...] "...not simply the expression of dystopian malaise, or of Luddism treacherously taking up residence in popular SF... <b>It</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> a coherent interpretation of industrialism and post-industrialism." ...|$|E
500|$|Slant Magazine's Eric Henderson {{wrote that}} [...] "Girl Gone Wild" [...] {{sounds like a}} [...] "Tumblr-meme version" [...] of the singer's 2006 single, [...] "Get Together". He added that the release [...] "may not be the nadir of Madonna's career so far, but I can think of few moments that feel as much a {{betrayal}} of her legacy than the way she deadpans 'It's so erotic' right before chirping 'This feeling can't be beat'." [...] Robert Copsey of Digital Spy felt the production credits for MDNA had fueled [...] "over-inflated expectations" [...] for the single. Copsey found it was not [...] "forward-thinking" [...] like Madonna's past records and cited the lyrics [...] "Girls they just wanna have some fun/ Get fired up like a smoking gun" [...] {{as an example of}} this, although he concluded his review writing [...] "we defy anyone who isn't singing this back to themselves immediately after." [...] The New York Observer journalist Daniel D'Addario compared it to [...] "Music", but added that [...] "Madonna was twelve years younger at that time and thus perhaps a more convincing 'bad girl', so too was our culture... maybe it's time for her to try something totally different?" [...] In another article for The Guardian, Gareth Grundy proclaimed [...] "Girl Gone Wild" [...] to be a [...] "clumsy rave-pop", while Amanda Dobbins from New York panned it as a [...] "paint-by-numbers, 808- and Tanqueray-referencing dance track that falls even flatter when compared to its source material". Malone from NME found no innovation in the track, writing, [...] "combined with earlier single 'Give Me All Your Luvin' <b>it</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> an uneasy mix for album MDNA." [...] Margaret Wappler from Los Angeles Times felt that Madonna would have been better re-releasing [...] "Music" [...] again as a single, instead of [...] "Girl Gone Wild". She added that [...] "There's something very attractive about a song this militaristic and precise, but in Madge's too-capable hands it's also suffocatingly professional." ...|$|E
