500|$|Members of Ferraro's {{family were}} indeed facing legal issues. Her husband John Zaccaro had {{pleaded guilty in}} , to fraudulently obtaining bank {{financing}} in a real estate transaction and had been sentenced to 150hours of community service. Then in , he was indicted on unrelated felony charges regarding an alleged 1981 bribery of Queens Borough President Donald Manes concerning a cable television contract. A full year later, he was acquitted at trial. The case against him was circumstantial, a key prosecution witness proved unreliable, and the defense {{did not have to}} present its own testimony. Ferraro said her husband never would have been charged had she not run for vice president. Meanwhile, in , the couple's son John had been arrested for possession and sale of cocaine. He was convicted, and in , sentenced to four months imprisonment; Ferraro broke down in tears in court relating the stress the episode had placed on her family. Ferraro worked on an unpublished book about the conflicting rights between a free press and being able to have fair trials. Asked in , whether she would have accepted the vice-presidential nomination had she known of all the family problems that would follow, she said, [...] "More than once I have sat down and said to myself, oh, God, I wish I had never gone through with it... I think the candidacy opened a door for women in national politics, and I don't regret that for one minute. I'm proud of that. But <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>wish</b> it could have been done in a different way." ...|$|E
500|$|During the 1988 presidential election, Kennedy {{supported}} the eventual Democratic nominee, Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis, {{from the start}} of the campaign. In the fall, Dukakis lost to George H. W. Bush, but Kennedy won re-election to the Senate over Republican Joseph D. Malone in the easiest race of his career. Kennedy remained a powerful force in the Senate. [...] In 1988 Kennedy co-sponsored an amendment to the Fair Housing Act of 1968, which prohibits discrimination in the rental, sale, marketing, and financing of the nation's housing; the amendment strengthened the ability of the Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity to enforce the Act and expanded the protected classes to include disabled persons and families with children. After prolonged negotiations during 1989 with Bush chief of staff John H. Sununu and Attorney General Richard Thornburgh to secure Bush's approval, he directed passage of the landmark Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. Kennedy had personal interest in the bill due to his sister Rosemary's condition and his son's lost leg, and he considered its enactment one of the most important successes of his career. In the late 1980s Kennedy and Hatch staged a prolonged battle against Senator Jesse Helms to provide funding to combat the AIDS epidemic and provide treatment for low-income people affected; this would culminate in passage of the Ryan White Care Act. In late November 1989, Kennedy traveled to see first-hand the newly fallen Berlin Wall; he spoke at John-F.-Kennedy-Platz, site of the famous [...] "Ich bin ein Berliner" [...] speech in 1963, and said [...] "Emotionally, <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>wish</b> my brother could have seen it." ...|$|E

[...] Manohla Dargis from The New York Times wrote, [...] "Fast, {{periodically}} spit-funny and often grotesquely violent, the film at once embraces and satirizes contemporary action-film clichés with Tarantino-esque self-regard."

[...] However, {{when asked about}} the company by Interview magazine, she clarified the name's origin: [...] "...people think I named it after myself... It was actually an in-joke with my family because at [...] 7 I understood complicated medical terms, such as the difference between type A and type B personalities. But <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>wished</b> I'd named the company Dogfood Films or Fork or something. You carry that baggage all your life."

2500|$|Referred to as a [...] "stoner rap" [...] by Allmusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine, {{the lyrics}} are mostly nonsensical. The song's chorus, in which Beck sings the lines [...] "Soy un perdedor/I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me?", is often {{interpreted}} as a parody of Generation X's [...] "slacker" [...] culture. Beck has denied the validity of this meaning, instead saying that the chorus is simply about his lack of skill as a rapper. Jon Pareles wrote in The New York Times that [...] "The sentiment of 'Loser' [...] reflects the twentysomething trademark, a mixture of self-mockery and sardonic defiance", noting Beck's [...] "offhand vocal tone and free-associative lyrics" [...] and comparing his vocals to [...] "Bob Dylan talk-singing". After its recording, Beck thought that the song was interesting but unimpressive. He later said, [...] "The raps and vocals are all first takes. If I’d known the impact {{it was going to}} make, I would have put something a little more substantial in it." [...] The relationship between Beck and Stephenson soured after the release of [...] "Loser" [...] as a single. Stephenson regretted his involvement in creating the song, in particular the [...] "negative" [...] lyrics, saying [...] "I feel bad about it. It's not Beck the person, it's the words. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>wish</b> I could have been more of a positive influence." ...|$|E

Game Informer awarded it 8.5 out of 10 and said it [...] "delivers a non-stop action ride with something new around every corner." [...] GamesRadar gave it three-and-a-half stars out of five and said [...] "Shattered Dimensions is a good game, but it fell short of an Ultimate Marvel Team-Up." [...] GamePro gave the Xbox 360 version four and a half out of five stars and said, [...] "Thankfully, [...] latest adventure, Shattered Dimensions, is one of his best yet, offering four unique worlds, classic Spidey action, and an engaging story that puts it {{near the top of the}} franchise both in terms of quality and impact." [...] X-Play gave the game four stars out of five and said it [...] "streamlines the usual trappings of the genre to focus on combat and personality. It’s true that the linear gameplay and old-school combat sensibilities don’t put it on par with Arkham Asylum, but the game succeeds regardless. It’s fun, fast-paced, and long enough to make it well worth checking out."

[...] Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter gave the film a positive review as well, stating that [...] "all the requisite elements are served up here in ideal proportion, and the time just flies by, which can rarely be said for films of this nature."

[...] "No {{one seems to}} have told the Lonely Island boys that the stakes are a little higher in features {{than they are in}} music videos and that underlighted shots and sloppy editing are more distracting on the big screen than on television," [...] wrote Marjorie Baumgarten of The Austin Chronicle. Wesley Morris of The Boston Globe characterized the film as [...] "playfully dumb," [...] commenting, [...] "The filmmakers ... have skipped right past the kitsch of tribute and gone straight for jokey delusion ... And in that sense, Hot Rod is post-parody, taking nothing seriously, not even being a movie." [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone wrote, [...] "The film's low-key Wayne's World vibe takes it only so far. I laughed, then I wished it was funnier, then <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>wished</b> it would end. Peter Debruge of Variety called the movie [...] "yet another example of a comedy that refuses to be taken seriously — concept as clothesline for all manner of silliness."
