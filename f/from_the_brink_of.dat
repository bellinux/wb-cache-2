25|$|Apollo {{carried the}} baby to the centaur Chiron who raised Asclepius and {{instructed}} him {{in the art of}} medicine. It is said that in return for some kindness rendered by Asclepius, a snake licked Asclepius's ears clean and taught him secret knowledge (to the Greeks snakes were sacred beings of wisdom, healing, and resurrection). Asclepius bore a rod wreathed with a snake, which became associated with healing. A species of non-venomous pan-Mediterranean serpent, the Aesculapian snake (Zamenis longissimus) is named for the god.Asclepius became so proficient as a healer that he surpassed both Chiron and his father, Apollo.

25|$|Habitats and biota do {{frequently}} change. Therefore, {{it follows}} that the process of adaptation is never finally complete. Over time, it may happen that the environment changes little, and the species comes to fit its surroundings better and better. On the other hand, it may happen that changes in the environment occur relatively rapidly, and then the species becomes less and less well adapted. Seen like this, adaptation is a genetic tracking process, which goes on all the time to some extent, but especially when the population cannot or does not move to another, less hostile area. Given enough genetic change, as well as specific demographic conditions, an adaptation may be enough to bring a population back <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>brink</b> <b>of</b> extinction in a process called evolutionary rescue. It should be noted that adaptation does affect, to some extent, every species in a particular ecosystem.|$|E
40|$|The Ways in Which Russia Adapts, by Kathy Rousselet The Russian {{socioeconomic}} situation, far <b>from</b> {{being on}} <b>the</b> <b>brink</b> <b>of</b> chaos, {{seems to be}} relatively stable. Russians, with low material requirements inherited <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Soviet era, have no further expectations <b>from</b> <b>the</b> State and even distrust it, developing an "ascetic culture". In {{the absence of a}} strong State, society, like firms, is reorganizing and regulating itself on the basis of personal and informal relations. Faced with a society that is increasingly fragmented, Russians prefer the private sphere, especially that of the family and the community, which supports a System of reciprocated mutual aid, conflict resolution and social integration. The informal sphere, the spontaneous response of society to this period of transition, could prove to be temporary, even if it is a fundamental element of Russian sociopolitical culture. Rousselet.

60|$|A hatchet, too, is {{of great}} {{advantage}} in climbing among the immense masses of ice which are found at great elevations, since, by means of such an implement, steps may be cut in the ice which will enable the explorer to climb up an ascent too long to be reached by the ladder and too steep to be ascended without artificial footholds. In ascending Mont Blanc the traveller sometimes comes to a precipice of ice, with a chasm of immense depth, and four or five feet wide, {{at the bottom of}} it. In such a case the foot of the ladder is planted {{on the outside of the}} chasm, and the top of it is made to rest against the face of the precipice, ten or fifteen feet perhaps <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>brink.</b> One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> boldest and most skilful of the guides then ascends the ladder, hatchet in hand, and there, suspended as he is over the yawning gulf below, he begins to cut steps in the face of the precipice, shaping the gaps which he makes in such a manner that he can cling to them with his hands as well as rest upon them with his feet. He thus slowly ascends the barrier, cutting his way as he advances. He carries the end of the rope up with him, tied around his waist; and then by means of it, when he has reached the summit, he aids the rest of the party in coming up to him.|$|R

We had already had our first glimpse of their summits from our own windows, but it was <b>from</b> <b>the</b> terrace outside the reading-room that we felt their grandeur most after we had drunk our coffee: we could scarcely have borne it before. In their presence, we could not realize at once that Ronda itself was a mountain, a mere mighty mass of rock, cleft in twain, with chasmal depths where we saw pygmy men and mules creeping out upon the valley that stretched upward {{to the foot of the}} Sierra. Why there should ever have been a town built there in the prehistoric beginning, except that the rock was so impossible to take, and why it should have therefore been taken by that series of invaders who pervaded all Spain--by the Phoenicians, by the Carthaginians, by the Romans, by the Goths, by the Moors, by the Christians, and after many centuries by the French, and finally by the Spaniards again--it would not be easy to say. Among its many conquerors, the Moors left their impress upon it, though here as often as elsewhere in Spain their impress is sometimes merely a decoration of earlier Roman work. There remains a Roman bridge which the Moors did not make over into the likeness of their architecture, but built a bridge of their own which also remains and may be seen <b>from</b> <b>the</b> magnificent structure with which the Spaniards have arched the abyss where the river rushes writhing and foaming through the gorge three hundred feet below. There on the steps that lead <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>brink,</b> <b>the</b> eye <b>of</b> pity may still see the files of Christian captives bringing water up to their Moslem masters; but as one cannot help them now, even by the wildest throe, it is as well to give a vain regret to the architect of the Spanish bridge, who fell to his death from its parapet, and then push on to the market hard by.|$|R

More importantly, the Liberals emerged with only a five-seat majority in the election, and many pundits suggested that the combined PC and Reform votes would have been enough to unseat the Liberals or at least reduce them to minority status.|$|E
