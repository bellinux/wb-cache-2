50|$|Archery may {{be easier}} to learn and have a faster rate of fire, yet perhaps this system's {{greatest}} advantage over the atlatl is that ammunition is easier to make and transport. Since the dart must store {{almost all of the}} system's elastic energy, more care, planning, and weight of elastic material must be invested in its construction. In archery, the bulk of elastic energy is stored in the throwing device, rather than the projectile; arrow shafts can therefore be much smaller, and have looser tolerances for spring constant and weight distribution than atlatl darts. For example, stone dart points from the same set tend to vary in mass by {{no more than a few}} percent, and computer simulations show that this is necessary for efficient operation. Similar constraints exist for the length, diameter, and materials quality of the shaft.

Whenever a multiplicity of antenna functions such as communications, intelligence, direction finding, and electronic warfare, must operate on a single platform, the need to isolate the antennas and their signals from each other becomes a performance-limiting problem. The only solution available today is to employ frequency-selective surfaces and solids (so-called Photonic Band Gap materials). These are carefully structured periodic arrangements of conducting or dielectric elements that create stopbands in their transmission functions at specific frequencies and angles. However, by definition these require complex manufacturing approaches with <b>exacting</b> <b>tolerances,</b> and they suffer from out-of-band grating lobes. The ideal solution to this packaging problem would be {{the existence of a}} bulk material that is only transparent at a prescribed frequency. Such a material would allow antennas operating at different bands to share "real estate " with a minimum of mutual coupling. It would also allow the construction of frequency selective radomes with no out-of-band grating lobes.

40|$|Abstract. The {{origin of}} {{advanced}} mathematics is always spoken of in Babylonian, Egyptian, Greek or Indian terms. In {{the case of}} Paleolithic mathematics we usually hear that the evidence represents little more than simple tallying or, at most, calendars. However, limited appraisals such as these are based less on rigorous study of the actual evidence than on a core assumption carried over from evolutionary anthropology, the belief that early peoples were incapable of mathematics. In this paper, I offer more evidence {{that by the time}} of Bilzingsleben—a Lower Paleolithic archaeological site 320, 000 – 412, 000 years old—Homo erectus people already had a long history of mathematical thought including in geometry, trigonometry and fractals; and whether by deliberation or intuition, an awareness of mathematical constants. Scientific techniques not usually applied to ancient artifact studies such as the elimination of variables are used to isolate the constants proposed.

In a newly developed preclinical model of liver transplantation, we studied - in a biologically unmodified environment - the <b>exact</b> <b>tolerance</b> of the liver to warm ischemia. Following the evidence that liver transplantation from non-heart-beating donors is feasible and safe, provided that warm and cold ischemia are kept short, a clinical programme of liver transplantation from non-heart-beating donors was successfully initiated in our and other Belgian centers. Recently, we demonstrated that the tolerance of such livers to warm ischemia could be substantially improved {{when some of the}} previously identified mechanisms leading to graft non-function were tackled by a multi-factorial pharmacological strategy. Meanwhile, cold storage has proven to be insufficient to optimally preserve organs from non-heart-beating donors. As an alternative, machine perfusion preservation was found to consistently improve outcome in kidney transplantation from non-heart-beating donors. Similarly, machine perfusion preservation could improve the preservation of livers, allowing to predict viability prior to transplantation and to ameliorate tolerance to warm ischemia.

JIC fittings are dimensionally identical to AN (Army-Navy) fittings, but are produced to less <b>exacting</b> <b>tolerances</b> and are generally less costly. SAE 45-degree flare fittings are similar in appearance, but are not interchangeable, though dash sizes 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10, 14, and 16 share the same thread size. Some couplings may have dual machined seats for both 37-degree and 45-degree flare seats.Komatsu and JIS (Japanese Industrial Standard) fittings have flare ends similar to JIC fittings. Komatsu and JIS both use a 30-degree flare seating surface. The only difference is Komatsu uses milimeter thread sizes while JIS use a BSP (British Standard Pipe) thread. JIC fitting systems have three components that make a tubing assembly: fitting, flare nut, and sleeve. As with other flared connection systems, the seal is achieved through metal-to-metal contact between the finished surface of the fitting nose and the inside diameter of the flared tubing. The sleeve is used to evenly distribute the compressive forces of the flare nut to the flared end of the tube. Materials commonly used to fabricate JIC fittings include forged carbon steel, forged stainless steel, forged brass, machined brass, Monel and nickel-copper alloys.|$|R

Target pistols usually start out as standard models but receive extensive reworking by skilled pistolsmiths resulting in a firearm that is capable of much greater accuracy than the standard versions of the same arm.

40|$|The use of {{regression}} models for prediction purposes {{is one of}} the most common applications of chemometrics. In most cases, only reporting the point predictions is unsatisfactory and intervals are needed to quantify the uncertainty involved. It is common practice to use the 95 % prediction interval for this goal and to interpret such an interval as if 95 % of the future responses will be contained within this interval. However, this is inappropriate, and it can result in a gross underestimation of the real uncertainty of the predicted response, especially in cases where the degrees of freedom is small. To correctly quantify the uncertainty of a prediction, so-called tolerance intervals should be used. Although the theoretical background on tolerance intervals is well documented in the statistical literature, practical guidelines to calculate and use tolerance intervals in real-world applications are lacking. Another less known concept is that of simultaneous versus non-simultaneous intervals. In this tutorial, we explain the origin, interpretation and practical calculation of confidence, prediction, and tolerance intervals, both in their simultaneous and non-simultaneous form.

40|$|Praxair, in {{conjunction}} with the Los Alamos National Laboratory, is developing a new technology, thermoacoustic heat engines and refrigerators, for liquefaction of natural gas. This is the only technology capable of producing refrigeration power at cryogenic temperatures with no moving parts. A prototype, with a projected natural gas liquefaction capacity of 500 gallons/day, has been built and tested. The power source is a natural gas burner. Systems will be developed with liquefaction capacities up to 10, 000 to 20, 000 gallons per day. The technology, the development project, accomplishments and applications are discussed. In February 2001 Praxair, Inc. purchased the acoustic heat engine and refrigeration development program from Chart Industries. Chart (formerly Cryenco, which Chart purchased in 1997) and Los Alamos had been working on the technology development program since 1994. The purchase included assets and intellectual property rights for thermoacoustically driven orifice pulse tube refrigerators (TADOPTR), a new and revolutionary Thermoacoustic Stirling Heat Engine (TASHE) technology, aspects of Orifice Pulse Tube Refrigeration (OPTR) and linear motor compressors as OPTR drivers. Praxair, in cooperation with Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), the licensor of the TADOPTR and TASHE patents, is continuing the development of TASHE-OPTR natural gas powered, natural gas liquefiers. The liquefaction of natural gas, which occurs at - 161 C (- 259 F) at atmospheric pressure, has previously required rather sophisticated refrigeration machinery. The 1990 TADOPTR invention by Drs. Greg Swift (LANL) and Ray Radebaugh (NIST) demonstrated the first technology to produce cryogenic refrigeration with no moving parts. Thermoacoustic engines and refrigerators use acoustic phenomena to produce refrigeration from heat. The basic driver and refrigerator consist of nothing more than helium-filled heat exchangers and pipes, made of common materials, without <b>exacting</b> <b>tolerances.</b> The liquefier development program is divided into two components: Thermoacoustically driven refrigerators and linear motor driven refrigerators (LOPTRs). LOPTR technology will, for the foreseeable future, be limited to natural gas liquefaction capacities on the order of hundreds of gallons per day. TASHE-OPTR technology is expected to achieve liquefaction capacities {{of tens of thousands of}} gallons per day. This paper will focus on the TASHE-OPTR technology because its natural gas liquefaction capacity has greater market opportunity. LOPTR development will be mentioned briefly. The thermoacoustically driven refrigerator development program is now in the process of demonstrating the technology at a capacity of about 500 gallon/day (gpd) i. e., approximately 42, 000 standard cubic feet/day, which requires about 7 kW of refrigeration power. This capacity is big enough to illuminate the issues of large-scale acoustic liquefaction at reasonable cost and to demonstrate the liquefaction of about 70 % of an input gas stream, while burning about 30 %. Subsequent to this demonstration a system with a capacity of approximately 10 {sup 6 } standard cubic feet/day (scfd) = 10, 000 gpd with a projected liquefaction rate of about 85 % of the input gas stream will be developed. When commercialized, the TASHE-OPTRs will be a totally new type of heat-driven cryogenic refrigerator, with projected low manufacturing cost, high reliability, long life, and low maintenance. A TASHE-OPTR will be able to liquefy a broad range of gases, one of the most important being natural gas (NG). Potential NG applications range from distributed liquefaction of pipeline gas as fuel for heavy-duty fleet and long haul vehicles to large-scale liquefaction at on-shore and offshore gas wellheads. An alternative to the thermoacoustic driver, but with many similar technical and market advantages, is the linear motor compressor. Linear motors convert electrical power directly into oscillating linear, or axial, motion. Attachment of a piston to the oscillator results in a direct drive compressor. Such a compressor has two distinct advantages over rotary motor compressors. One, it is a completely dry system. Because there are no gearbox and roller bearings, there is no requirement for lubricants, which eliminates the cleanup issues associated with lubricants in cryogenic refrigerators driven by conventional compressors. Two, the oscillator is suspended by flexure bearings. Flexure bearings have no wearing parts and have essentially infinite lifetime. Linear motors can also be run in reverse as linear generators and can be driven by acoustic engines. Although most natural gas is still carried from well to user as gas in pipelines, the use of liquefied natural gas (LNG) has been increasing. A typical modern, large liquefaction plant costs a billion dollars, liquefies 10 {sup 9 } scfd, uses 10 - 15 % of its throughput to power itself, and has substantial operating and maintenance costs...|$|R

Tolerance to EAU can be induced via a single intra-nasal administration of the retinal autoantigen interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein (hIRBP 1 - 20). Tolerance initiation to EAU {{has been associated with}} an initial elevation of Th 2 -type cytokines in the cervical lymph nodes and spleens of experimental animals. Moreover, tolerance initiation was enhanced in mice with inhibited expression of the myeloid cell-regulatory protein CD 200. Binding of CD 300 /CD 200 R initiates a signalling cascade that ultimately results in the down-regulation of myeloid cell activation. Therefore, enhanced tolerance initiation in the CD 200 -deficient mice was a paradox and the main aim {{of this study was to}} examine the molecular events leading to enhanced tolerance. The first aim of this study was the identification of the <b>exact</b> time-point of <b>tolerance</b> initiation. Because of the association of Th 2 -type cytokines in tolerance induction, Northern Blotting detection for the Stat 6 transcript was performed. Maximal expression of the Stat 6 transcript was observed in the spleens of the CD 200 -deficient mice 8 h post-tolerisation. Having identified 8 h as a potentially relevant point in tolerance initiation, a GenaArray study was performed for the analysis of global gene expression in the cervical lymph nodes of IRBP-tolerised animals in respect to the sham-terrorised controls. Furthermore, the alternative molecular pathways initiated or inhibited in the cervical lymph nodes and spleens of CD 20 -deficient animals in respect to the WT controls were also examined. The results obtained in the microarray study were verified by Western Blotting and qRT-PCR. The results obtained in our study demonstrated that the nasal administration of autoantigen and the shift from a WT to a CD 200 -deficient phenotype had more diverse biological effects than previously thought.

Moreover, an increasing number of patients die while waiting for a suitable transplant liver. An alternative supply of organs is represented by Non-Heart-Beating Donors (NHBD) who are declared dead based on definite cardiac arrest (dead by cardiac death) rather than neurological criteria (dead by braindeath). Contrary to brain dead donors, there is a period without cardiac or respiratory activity, defined as Warm Ischemia (WI), during which organs are subjected to normothermic hypoxia. Unlike in kidney transplantation, the use of NHBD for LTx has remained limited. The most important reasons are the high risk of primary non-function (PNF), a complication that - unlike for the kidney - causes death {{in the absence of a}} rapid re-transplantation and the high incidence of biliary complications. The subject of this research project was to investigate the tolerance of livers exposed to WI in a preclinical model of LTx from NHBD and to elucidate some aspects pertaining to NHBD LTx:(i) the <b>exact</b> <b>tolerance</b> of the liver to WI is not known in a biologically unmodifiedenvironment;(ii) no reproducible techniques are currently available - contrary to the kidney - toevaluate WI damage and to predict liver graft viability ex vivo prior to implantation;(iii) finally, it is unknown whether it is possible to increase the resistance of the liver to WI. The aims of this study were 1. To develop a reproducible and preclinical large animal model of liver transplantationfrom non-heart-beating donors. 2. To study the maximal duration of warm ischemia that a liver graft can tolerate withoutprecluding graft function 3. To study the influence of prolonging cold ischemia after exposure towarm ischemiaon the outcome of LTx from NHBD. 4. To understand some of the mechanisms that lead to failure of non-heart-beating donor livers 5. To develop reliable and objective methods to predict viability of these livers prior orearly after their transplantation. 6. To cautiously apply LTx from NHBD clinically. Summary of the results 1. A reliable and reproducible model of LTx from NHBD could beestablished. Important risk factors for recipient survival such as low-weight animals, preoperative hypothermia, blood loss exceeding 400 ml and pre-existing porcine specific diseases were identified and prevented accordingly. In the final study groups, 6 animals were available for final analysis ineach group. Amongst all groups, duration of the anhepatic phase, total operating time and peri-operative blood loss were comparable. 2. The maximal duration of warm ischemia that a porcine liver graft can tolerate without precluding graft function following LTx. Using incremental WI periods -prior to a short cold ischemic period- exposure of graft to 15 min WI is well tolerated, 30 and 45 min WI induce an unacceptable high rate of Primary graft Non-Function (PNF) (50 %) and 60 min WI induces 100 % PNF. 3. The influence of cold ischemia after exposure to warm ischemia could be defined. Substantially prolonging the period of Cold Ischemia (CI) in groups previously not at risk to develop PNF was poorly tolerated whenever grafts were exposed to (very short) periods of WI. This resulted in an increased incidence of early graft dysfunction of these grafts and a poor recipient survival at day 4. 4. Mechanisms leading to failure of non-heart-beating donor liver grafts are multifactorial in nature. In grafts destined to fail, WI - on its own - causes hepatocellular damage that is immediately present after reperfusion and that is independent of the ischemia/reperfusion injury that ensues. The extent of this damage is well reflected by the peak of transaminases, such as AST and the timing of this peak. In groups with no or minimal WI, AST culminated on post-LTx day 1, whereas in groups exposed to > 30 min WI, AST culminatedvery early after reperfusion. In accordance, liver specimens taken immediately after prolonged WIalready showed substantial hepatocyte necrosisand vacuolization. WI by its own effect activates Kupffer cells, prior to cold storage andreperfusion. In grafts destined to fail, exposure to WI induced an increase in plasma levels of ß-galactosidase (a surrogate serum marker for Kupffer cell activation). This increase is the highest in recipients of grafts exposed to the longest WI and occurs very rapidly (15 min) after reperfusion. ß-galactosidase levels in serum also discriminate between recipients with fatal injury (PNF) from non-fatal liver injury (non-PNF). Unequivocal signs of Kupffer cell activation (cellular enlargement, presence of many large heterogeneous lysosomes, and of fragments of phagocytized red blood cells) were also found on electromicroscopical evaluationof biopsy specimens taken immediately after WI. The presence of large lysosomal granules already prior to reperfusion explains why ß-galactosidase  a lysosomal enzyme - can be released so early after reperfusion. In PNF recipients, the early activation of Kupffer cells was followed (at 3 hrs after reperfusion) by higher TNF-α and IL- 6 levels compared to non-PNF recipients. This late production of pro-inflammatory cytokines may have been initiated earlier during WI as biopsies taken before reperfusion showed higher expression of TNF-α mRNA (by RTPCR) in livers exposed to more prolonged WI. PNF recipients are also characterized bythe release of large quantities of redox-active iron. We also demonstrated an independent role for secretory Phospholipase A 2 (sPLA 2), which degrades cell membrane phospholipids and plays an important role in the synthesis of pro-inflammatory lipid mediators. In PNF recipients, sPLA 2 activity increased and peaked significantly at 1 hour after reperfusion, prior to the peak of the pro-inflammatory cytokines) TNF-α andIL- 6). Together with the activation of Kupffer cells and the generationof reactive oxygen species early during the ischemia/reperfusion injury, some anti-oxidant mechanisms (Reduced Glutathione and α-Tocopherol in particular) fail in PNF recipients. Finally, failing grafts displayprogressive microcirculatory disturbances and establishment of a progressive no flow phenomenon, as documented by a decreased Hyaluronic acidclearance (suggestive of sinusoidal endothelial cell dysfunction) and decreasing blood flow into the failing grafts Better understanding of themechanisms involved in failure of NHBD liver grafts allowed the design of a multifactorial cocktail of drugs to alleviate this injury. Preliminary results of such a study have already shown to improve tolerance toWI. 5. Reliable and objective methods to predict viability of these livers prior or early after their transplantation were developed. To predict viability of liver grafts prior to LTx, liver biopsies taken immediately after exposure to increasing lengths of WI were reviewed retrospectively. After a first retrospective review, hepatocellular vacuolization (a possible sign of hepatocellular suffering, present on biopsies immediately after exposure to WI) seemed to be associated with longer WI and PNF. In a second retrospective assessment, all biopsies were scored blindly using 3 different methods: (i) a semiquantitative scoring manner by an independent pathologist, (ii) by stereological point counting, (iii) and by digital image analysis. Vacuolization was found a risk factor to develop PNF and this risk varies according to the technique used to assess vacuolization: pathologists semi-quantative score (p= 0. 058; Odds ratio= 1. 065), stereological point counting (p= 0. 027; Odds ratio= 1. 528), digital image analysis score (p= 0. 043; Odds ratio= 1. 003). To predict viability as early as possible after LTx, a serum marker of hepatocellular damage: Liver-Fatty Binding Protein was examined. This small protein involved in the intracellular transport of fatty acids, can discriminate - as early as 15 min after graft reperfusion - groups without risk of developing PNF (exposure to 15 min or less WI) from groups with a substantial risk for developing PNF (exposure to 30 and 45 min of WI) and groups witha constant deleterious outcome (exposure to 60 min or more WI). 6. A clinical NHBD LTx program was launched at our Abdominal Transplant Surgery Department and at other Belgian LTx centers following the experimental evidence that NHBD LTx is feasible, provided that WIand CI are kept short. Between January 1, 2003 and December 31, 2005, 15 out of 584 LTx in Belgium were done with NHBD grafts. Mean interval from stop therapy/ventilation to cardiac arrest was 20 min and from cardiac arrest to liver cold perfusion 9. 1 min. The mean cold ischemia time was 7 hrs 22 min, a relatively short period in clinical LTx. As expected by the relatively short WI periods, no PNF requiring re-transplantation was seen. Mean peak AST post- Tx was higher than normally observed (2209 IU/L). Graft/patient survivals were 65 % and 80 % respectively. Major biliary complications required re-LTx in 2 patients. Ongoing research and future plans: A better understanding of the mechanisms involved in failure of NHBD liver grafts allowed designing strategies to alleviate this injury. Two interventions are possible: intervention by pharmacological modulation during the ischemia/reperfusion injury, or an intervention during the preservation of livers by machine perfusion. Biological interventions aimed at improving this injury consist of several strategies, acting at different moments of WI injury (after exposure to WI, prior to and during ischemia/reperfusion injury). Such a multifactorial cocktail strategy focuses on modulating of Kupffer cell activation, inhibiting the generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, optimization of anti-oxidant mechanisms, chelating circulating redox-activeiron, and maintaining adequate flow and viability to the graft. Currently, the effect of such a cocktail on livers exposed to 45 min WI has been investigated in our previously described model. Preliminary results are promising as they revealed excellent graft function in 6 out of 6 livers exposed to 45 min of WI, with the omission of the expected Kupffer cell activation and generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The use of machine perfusion to preserve grafts prior to transplantation represents a second strategy to alleviate the warm ischemic injury in NHBD LTx. Over the last decades, the use of hypothermic machine perfusion instead of cold storage to preserve NHBD kidneys has improved the outcome after transplantation. The advantage of hypothermic machine perfusion may be the continuous, complete perfusion of the liver. Moreover, during hypothermic machine perfusion the graft can be monitored and its viability tested, and different drugs administered. Therefore, this technology will be further developed andapplied to LTx from NHBD in an attempt to ameliorate tolerance of the liver to WI and to design a testing method that could allow discriminating viable and non-viable liver grafts. status: publishe...|$|R
