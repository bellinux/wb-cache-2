500|$|The {{conventional}} telephone {{was invented}} independently by Alexander Bell and Elisha Gray in 1876. Antonio Meucci invented the first device {{that allowed the}} electrical transmission of voice over a line in 1849. However Meucci's device was of little practical value because it relied upon the <b>electrophonic</b> <b>effect</b> and thus required users to place the receiver in their mouth to [...] "hear" [...] what was being said. The first commercial telephone services were set-up in 1878 and 1879 {{on both sides of}} the Atlantic in the cities of New Haven and London.|$|E

In 1962 Allan H Frey carried {{out a series of}} experiments which proved that microwaves can produce the sound even in those who are deaf.http://jap.physiology.org/content/17/4/689.abstract The theory is unable to explain why only the sense of hearing is affected - though there are rare reports of people noting odd smells accompanying an aurora display. See also the discussion of the <b>Electrophonic</b> effect/Microwave auditory <b>effect</b> which covers various mechanisms in detail.|$|R
