5|$|After the British {{invasion}} of 1806, Santiago de Liniers successfully reconquered Buenos Aires. The population <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>allow</b> Rafael de Sobremonte {{to continue as}} Viceroy. He had escaped to Cordoba with the public treasury while the battle was still in progress. A law enacted in 1778 required the treasury to be moved to a safe location {{in the case of}} a foreign attack, but Sobremonte was still seen as a coward by the population. The Royal Audiencia of Buenos Aires <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>allow</b> his return to Buenos Aires and elected Liniers, acclaimed as a popular hero, as an interim Viceroy. This was an unprecedented action, the first time that a Spanish viceroy was deposed by local government institutions, and not by the King of Spain himself; King CharlesIV ratified the appointment at a later time. Liniers armed the entire population of Buenos Aires, including criollos and slaves, and defeated a second British invasion attempt in 1807.|$|E

The lack of multiplayer in the pulled iOS version was lamented though the other facets of the game's humor remained.|$|E
