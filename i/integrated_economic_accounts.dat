The SAM subsequently presents in its detailed structure 132 accounts of goods and services, of which 47 are agricultural products, and 74 accounts of activities. The factor account consists of three categories of agricultural workers and two types of capital, distinguishing between agricultural and non-agricultural capital. The accounts for the institutional units distinguish between four representative categories of households, one Government account, two accounts of financial and non-financial corporations, and one account of non-resident institutions or Rest of the world (ROW).

40|$|The paper {{explains}} that FDI statistics should fulfil user needs {{other than those}} related to BOP and IIP. In that regard, issues mentioned in the Annotated Outline pertaining to the geographical allocation and to UBOs and UBAs should also be addressed {{in the context of}} FDI statistics, not just in the FATS area. In essence, the paper proposed that Direct Investment position and income data be calculated for each country where direct investment enterprises are located, rather than just for the countries where the direct investor has a direct position or with which it has a transaction. This may be contrasted with work in the UBO/UBA area, where data might only be attributed to the ultimate investor or ultimate investee, not necessarily to each of the entities in the chain of ownership. 3.

The paper uses data on some important fish stocks in Icelandic waters to give examples of results from using the proposed methods and indicate the degree of uncertainty involved in the estimations. The values of the fish stocks are estimated by using the prices of share quotas and by using direct estimations of the sum of discounted expected future profits. Estimations of fixed-price value of the fish stocks are also discussed...|$|R

The agency began working on a green accounting system called <b>Integrated</b> Environmental and <b>Economic</b> <b>Accounts.</b> These initial results released in 1994 showed that GDP numbers were overstating the impact of mining companies to the nation's economic wealth. Mining companies didn't like those results, and in 1995 Alan B.

5000|$|This {{method of}} accounting, which makes {{adjustments}} to the existing national account indicators, found traction in the System of <b>Integrated</b> <b>Economic</b> and Environmental <b>Accounts</b> (SEEA), published by the United Nations as an appendix to the 1993 SNA. The report offered five approaches, or versions, to developing environmental accounts. Over the years, the SEEA has been expanded and revised {{in view of the}} increased sophistication of accounting methodologies and technology. This revision will be explored in greater detail in the [...] "Global Initiatives" [...] section. Ultimately, the importance of the SEEA with respect to the green GDP is {{that it is possible to}} create full-sequence accounts from which aggregates such as green GDP can be derived and compared internationally, and many countries have begun this process.|$|R
40|$|Both the System of <b>Integrated</b> Environment and <b>Economic</b> <b>Accounting</b> (SEEA) and the Environmental and Natural Resources Accounting Project (ENRAP) are {{efforts to}} expand {{conventional}} national <b>economic</b> <b>accounts</b> {{in order to}} better reflect interactions between the market economy and the natural environment. In order to maintain a close relationship to the System of National Accounts (SNA) accounting standards, SEEA adopts conventional definitions of productive sectors and attempts to minimize the use of imputations. As a result, SEEA fails to account for many valuable services of the natural environment and encourages the use of techniques that provide misleading and poor estimates of depreciation and damage the environment. This paper develops a theory of environmental accounting drawing on principles from the environmental economic literature. This theoretical framework underlies the ENRAP approach and provides a basis for constrasting ENRAP and SEEA analytically. Using Philippine data, SEEA-type estimates are compared with those of ENRAP.

We emphasise the importance of understanding the conceptual differences between weak and strong sustainability. We then outline what we consider to be current best practice in measurement, all the time flagging the relationship between our discussion and that of the SEEA- 2003. This is an important task in our view, because, despite covering a very wide range of relevant conceptual and empirical issues, the handbook is by design not meant to provide clear guidelines for the purpose of measuring sustainability in either its weak or strong version. ...|$|R

40|$|The 1993 United Nations System for <b>integrated</b> Environmental and <b>Economic</b> <b>Accounting</b> (SEEA) {{aimed at}} {{measuring}} the - environmental - sustainability of economic performance and growth {{in terms of}} produced and natural capital maintenance. To this end it advanced "greened" economic indicators, notably Environmentally-adjusted net Domestic Product (EDP) and Capital Formation (ECF). A revised (draft) version of the 1993 handbook, entitled "Integrated Environmental and <b>Economic</b> <b>Accounting</b> 2003 " (IEEA), is now available {{on the web site}} of the United Nations Statistics Division. Despite its extensive discussion of sustainable development, the IEEA 2003 fails in measuring overall sustainability as it shuns monetary valuation of environmental impacts in a modular framework for physical, hybrid and - selective - monetary accounts. The revision thus missed an opportunity to bridge the persisting dichotomy between ecological and economic sustainability analysis. Future work should explore and test the capability of material flow and environmentally adjusted economic indicators to capture the elusive notions of strong and weak sustainability of <b>economic</b> activity. environmental <b>accounting,</b> sustainability, capital maintenance, dematerialization, green GDP, valuation...|$|R
