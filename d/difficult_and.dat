5|$|Berge Meere und Giganten (Mountains Seas and Giants) is a 1924 {{science fiction}} novel by German author Alfred Döblin. Stylistically and {{structurally}} experimental, the novel follows {{the development of}} human society into the 27th century and depicts global-scale conflicts between future polities, technologies, and natural forces, culminating in the catastrophic harvesting of Iceland's volcanic energy in order to melt Greenland's ice cap. Among critics, Berge Meere und Giganten has {{the reputation of being}} a <b>difficult</b> <b>and</b> polarizing novel, and has not received nearly as much attention as Döblin's following novel, Berlin Alexanderplatz (1929).|$|E

5|$|By the 19th century, the {{graveyard}} was full {{and had become}} a public health concern. It was overrun with rats, and dogs chasing the rats, {{both of which were}} damaging the churchyard.

In 1849, an extra charge was put on burials of people from outside the parish. In 1884, the churchyard was closed to all burials and a cemetery was opened in the town.|$|E

40|$|Background: Inadequate ventilation, esophageal {{intubation}} <b>and</b> <b>difficult</b> intubation are {{the most}} common adverse respiratory outcomes in patient undergoing anesthesia. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare Mallampati test in supine and sitting positions in traditional approach and during phonation for predicting <b>difficult</b> laryngoscopy <b>and</b> intubation. Methods: In this study performed in Imam Khomeini Hospital in Tehran, Iran, Mallampati test was performed on 661 patients who met the inclusion criteria for the study. The test was done in supine and sitting positions with and without phonation by a rater who was blind to Mallampati test. Subsequently, laryngoscopy view <b>and</b> <b>difficult</b> intubation were evaluated in the four aforesaid positions by Mallampati test for predicting <b>difficult</b> laryngoscopy <b>and</b> intubation. For each situations, sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values and accuracy were calculated. Results: Overall, 28 (4. 2 %) patients had <b>difficult</b> laryngoscopy <b>and</b> 9 (1. 4 %) patients had difficult intubation. The highest sensitivity for Mallampati test in predicting <b>difficult</b> laryngoscopy <b>and</b> intubation was in supine and sitting positions without phonation, and the highest specificity was seen in sitting position with phonation. Negative predictive values were more than 95 % in all different positions for Mallampati tests and the highest positive predictive value was seen in supine position with phonation. Conclusion: According to our findings, the highest correlation between Mallampati test and different positions in predicting <b>difficult</b> laryngoscopy <b>and</b> intubation was seen in supine position with phonation. Phonation improved Mallampati score in supine rather than sitting position...|$|R

It uses voluminous statistics to underpin its arguments. Innis maintains that the <b>difficult</b> <b>and</b> expensive construction project was sustained by fears of American annexation of the Canadian West.|$|E
