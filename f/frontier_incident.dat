50|$|Subsequently, the Ottomans resumed warfare {{with the}} Safavids in the Ottoman-Safavid War of 1578-90, conquering Georgia, Azerbaijan, and western Iran. In 1593 a <b>frontier</b> <b>incident</b> {{led to the}} renewal of warfare with Habsburg Austria in the Long War (1593-1606), in which neither side was able to achieve decisive victory. The Ottomans briefly held Győr (Yanık, 1594-8), but lost control of Novigrad (1594), exposing Buda to attacks from the north. By {{the end of the}} war the Ottomans had conquered the {{strategic}} fortresses of Eger (Eğri, 1596) and Nagykanizsa (Kanije, 1600). The Safavids took advantage of Ottoman distraction in the west to reverse all of their recent gains in the east in the Ottoman-Safavid War of 1603-18. After the turmoil of Osman II's regicide, the Safavids also seized Baghdad and much of Iraq in 1623, holding it until 1638, after which the border of the 1555 Treaty of Amasya was re-established. While they were occupied with the Safavid wars, an ongoing revolt of the local Zaydi Shi'ites of Yemen finally forced the Ottomans to abandon that province in 1636. The province of Lahsa in eastern Arabia also suffered from perpetual rebellion and tribal resistance to Ottoman rule, and was abandoned in 1670.|$|E
50|$|Bulgarian {{relations}} with Yugoslavia (before 1929 the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes) remained strained over the Macedonian question. <b>Frontier</b> <b>incidents</b> were frequent, as were Yugoslav charges against Bulgaria for fostering the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (IMRO), a nationalist group that used violence, in Yugoslavia. Macedonian agitation against Serbian rule culminated (1934) in {{the assassination of}} King Alexander of Yugoslavia by a Macedonian nationalist at Marseilles.|$|R
25|$|Hostilities grew steadily, {{eventually}} involving small-scale actions {{between the}} Somali National Army and Imperial Ethiopian Armed Forces along the border. In February 1964, armed conflict erupted on the Somali-Ethiopian frontier, and Ethiopian aircraft raided targets in Somalia. The confrontation ended in April through {{the mediation of}} Sudan, acting {{under the auspices of}} the Organization of African Unity (OAU). Under the terms of the cease-fire, a joint commission was formed to examine the causes of <b>frontier</b> <b>incidents,</b> and a demilitarized zone ten to fifteen kilometers wide was established on either side of the border. At least temporarily, further military confrontations were prevented.|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} Greece {{had been brought}} before the Security Council first time on January 21, 1946 and was {{continued}} almost during whole year. On 3 December 1946, the Greek Government had complained that Greek guerrilla movement was receiving substantial support from Albania, Bulgaria and Yugoslavia. After discussion of this complaint and of additional charges made concerning the disturbed conditions prevailing along the frontiers dividing Greece from her northern neighbors (Albania, Bulgaria and Yugoslavia), on 19 December 1946, the Security Council established a Commission of Investigation Concerning Greek <b>Frontier</b> <b>Incidents.</b> The Commission made field investigations in Albania, Bulgaria, Greece and Yugoslavia and submitted a rapport to the Security Council on 23 May 1947. Presentation of activity of this Commission and her Subsidiary Group is an object of the author's deliberation. The {{article is based on}} documents from Archives Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the latest literature...|$|R
5000|$|Hood's first {{high-level}} posting was on 16 October 1945 when he {{was sent}} to the Hague in the Netherlands to set up a new resident legation as chargé d'affaires. After completing this posting by 1946, Hood acted as political adviser to the Australian Military Mission in Berlin and in 1947 was appointed to succeed Paul Hasluck as the second Permanent Representative of Australia to the United Nations in New York City. As Australia served as a non-permanent member of the first United Nations Security Council, Hood served on the council and as president of that body in December 1947. In January 1947 hood served on the United Nations Commission for Investigation of Greek <b>Frontier</b> <b>Incidents</b> (also first chairman) and later in May 1947 as Australia's representative on the United Nations Special Committee on Palestine. Serving until 1950, Hood was then appointed on 22 April 1950 by Foreign Minister Percy Spender as Australia's first Ambassador to Indonesia. The post was considered an important one, with The Advocate opining that Australia should be offer advice and technical assistance to the Soekarno Government as Indonesia was [...] "suffering the growing pains of nationhood". Hood was recalled to Australia briefly in May 1950 to discuss matters relating to Indonesia's claim to western New Guinea and the death of an Australian pilot, John Doderick, who was fatally shot in Jakarta that month.|$|R

The <b>incident</b> happened after two US military helicopters came under fire from Pakistan army troops. A US military spokesman insisted {{that they had been}} about {{a mile and a half}} inside Afghanistan. Speaking at the United Nations, President Asif Zardari maintained that Pakistan would not tolerate violations of its sovereignty, even by its allies. President Zardari told the United Nations, [...] "Just as we will not let Pakistani's territory to be used by terrorists for attacks against our people and our neighbours, we cannot allow our territory and our sovereignty to be violated by our friends", he said, without specifically citing the United States or the border flareup.|$|R
