5|$|The {{range of}} the dusky shark extends worldwide, albeit discontinuously, in {{tropical}} and warm-temperate waters. In the western Atlantic Ocean, it is found from Massachusetts and the Georges Bank to southern Brazil, including the Bahamas and Cuba. In the eastern Atlantic Ocean, {{it has been reported}} from the western and central Mediterranean Sea, the Canary Islands, Cape Verde, Senegal, Sierra Leone, and possibly elsewhere including Portugal, Spain, Morocco, and Madeira. In the Indian Ocean, it is found off South Africa, Mozambique, and Madagascar, with sporadic records in the Arabian Sea, the Bay of Bengal, and perhaps the Red Sea. In the Pacific Ocean, it occurs off Japan, mainland China and Taiwan, Vietnam, Australia, and New Caledonia in the west, and from southern California to the Gulf of California, around Revillagigedo, and possibly off northern Chile in the east. Records of dusky sharks from the northeastern and <b>eastern</b> <b>central</b> <b>Atlantic,</b> and around tropical islands, may in fact be of Galapagos sharks. Mitochondrial DNA and microsatellite evidence suggest that Indonesian and Australian sharks represent distinct populations.|$|E

40|$|AbstractDynamics of {{abundance}} and migrations of populations of small pelagic clupeoid fish such as anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus), sardine (Sardina pilchardus), sardinella (Sardinella aurita), sprat (Sprattus sprattus) and herring (Clupea harengus) in the <b>eastern</b> North and <b>Central</b> <b>Atlantic</b> between Senegal and Norway vary in synchrony with the {{warm and cool}} phases of the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO). This is shown by compiling retrospective data on fish catches and anecdotal observations, which in some cases {{date back to the}} mid- 19 th century. The AMO is defined as the de-trended mean of North Atlantic (0 – 60 °N) sea surface temperature anomalies. However, it is not primarily the temperature which drives the dynamics of the small pelagic fish populations. Instead, the AMO seems to be a proxy for complex processes in the coupled atmosphere–ocean system of the North Atlantic. This is manifested in large-scale changes in strength and direction of the current system that move water masses around the North Atlantic and likely involves the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), the Mediterranean Overflow Water (MOW) and the subpolar gyre (SPG). The contractions and expansions of the SPG apparently play a key role. This was particularly obvious in the mid- 1990 s, when the SPG abruptly contracted with the result that warm subtropical water masses moved to the north and east. Small pelagic fish populations in the <b>eastern</b> North and <b>Central</b> <b>Atlantic,</b> including those in the Mediterranean responded quickly by changing abundances and migrating northwards. It seems that the complex ocean–atmosphere changes in the mid- 1990 s, which are described in the text in detail, caused a regime shift in the ecosystems of the <b>eastern</b> North and <b>Central</b> <b>Atlantic</b> and the small pelagic clupeoid fish populations are the sentinels of this shift...|$|R

40|$|<b>Eastern</b> North <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Central</b> Water {{formation}} and circulation {{are linked to}} the strength of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) and therefore an important component of our climate system. Today, the North Atlantic Oscillation is one of the controlling modes in climate variability of atmosphere-ocean linkages over the subpolar and subtropical basins and influences central water {{formation and}} circulation. However, the impact of longer-term forcings such as total solar irradiance, sudden or gradual changes in the freshwater budget of the North Atlantic, and the nature of climate signal propagation from high to low latitudes within central water circulation remains poorly understood.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{remoteness}} of the Trindade and Martin Vaz young volcanic archipelago (TMV) {{raises questions}} about the source of its marine benthic fauna and levels of endemism. Addressing these questions requires a comprehensive knowledge of the taxonomic composition of the marine fauna of the islands. A five-year survey in the shallow marine waters (up to 30 m) and a literature review on the data published for TMV have been conducted to document the biodiversity of the benthic fauna. Here we report on ten new records of decapod crustaceans from TMV: Gnathophyllum americanum and Thor amboinensis are circumtropical in distribution, whereas Stenopus hispidus, Gnathophylloides mineri and Parribacus antarcticus are disjunct circumtropical species as their distribution in the Atlantic Ocean is limited eastwardly to TMV or Ascension Island (S. hispidus), therefore, do not extending into the eastern Atlantic. Gnathophyllum circellum and Thor manningi are western Atlantic species, with G. circellum previously known only from the Caribbean Sea. Pontonia manningi, Tuleariocaris neglecta and Enoplometopus antillensis are amphi-Atlantic in distribution. Two of the above species are recorded from the southwestern Atlantic for the first time: Gnathophyllum circellum and Tuleariocaris neglecta. These new records corroborate that the marine benthic invertebrate fauna of the TMV archipelago is actually a mosaic of amphi-Atlantic, <b>eastern</b> <b>Atlantic,</b> <b>central</b> <b>Atlantic</b> (insular), endemic and circumtropical species, with a strong western Atlantic component...|$|R
