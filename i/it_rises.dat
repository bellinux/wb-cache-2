5|$|The Old Red Sandstone is {{a series}} of red sandstones, marls and conglomerates. <b>It</b> <b>rises</b> as an {{anticline}} in the Mendips and appears in the Avon Gorge and at Portishead. Carboniferous Limestone, of marine origin, covers the sandstone and appears in the Avon Gorge and at Weston-super-Mare where it contains volcanic rocks. There are outlying hills at Worlebury, Middle Hope, the Failand Ridge, Broadfields Down, Portishead Down and Wrington Hill.|$|E

5|$|The {{concentration}} of calcium carbonate {{in the waters}} of Buffalo Creek ranges from less than 10 milligrams per liter to 100 milligrams per liter. In the upper half of the creek, the concentration is less than 50 milligrams per liter. Around Mifflinburg, <b>it</b> <b>rises</b> to its peak of 100 milligrams per liter. The concentration declines to 70 milligrams per liter at the confluence with Spruce Run, but rises to about 80 milligrams per liter at the mouth of Buffalo Creek. One tributary of the creek has a {{concentration of}} 250 milligrams per liter. The calcium concentration in the creek ranges from virtually 0 milligrams per liter to over 40 milligrams per liter. The concentration is under 10 milligrams per liter until the point where Hoover Road goes over Buffalo Creek, at which point <b>it</b> <b>rises</b> to about 15 milligrams per liter. At Mifflinburg, the concentration rises to its peak before dropping to around 30 milligrams per liter between Mifflinburg and the Susquehanna River.|$|E

5|$|Because of Copenhagen's {{northern}} latitude, {{the number}} of daylight hours varies considerably between summer and winter. On the summer solstice, the sun rises at 04:26 and sets at 21:58, providing 17 hours 32 minutes of daylight. On the winter solstice, <b>it</b> <b>rises</b> at 08:37 and sets at 15:39 with 7 hours and 1 minute of daylight. There is therefore a difference of 10 hours and 31 minutes in the length of days and nights between the summer and winter solstices.|$|E

5|$|Explosive eruptions {{occur when}} magma decompresses as <b>it</b> <b>rises,</b> {{allowing}} dissolved volatiles (dominantly water and carbon dioxide) to exsolve into gas bubbles. As more bubbles nucleate a foam is produced, which decreases {{the density of}} the magma, accelerating it up the conduit. Fragmentation occurs when bubbles occupy ~70-80 vol% of the erupting mixture. When fragmentation occurs, violently expanding bubbles tear the magma apart into fragments which are ejected into the atmosphere where they solidify into ash particles. Fragmentation is a very efficient process of ash formation and is capable of generating very fine ash even without the addition of water.|$|E
5|$|The Circus {{consists}} of three long, curved terraces designed by the elder John Wood to form a circular space or theatre intended for civic functions and games. The games give {{a clue to the}} design, the inspiration behind which was the Colosseum in Rome. Like the Colosseum, the three façades have a different order of architecture on each floor: Doric on the ground level, then Ionic on the piano nobile, and finishing with Corinthian on the upper floor, the style of the building thus becoming progressively more ornate as <b>it</b> <b>rises.</b> Wood never lived to see his unique example of town planning completed as he died five days after personally laying the foundation stone on 18 May 1754.|$|E
5|$|The River Hull is a {{navigable river}} in the East Riding of Yorkshire in Northern England. <b>It</b> <b>rises</b> {{from a series of}} springs to the west of Driffield, and enters the Humber estuary at Kingston upon Hull. Following a period when the Archbishops of York charged tolls for its use, it became a free navigation. The upper reaches became part of the Driffield Navigation from 1770, after which they were again subject to tolls, and the section within the city of Hull came under the {{jurisdiction}} of the Port of Hull, with the same result.|$|E

5|$|The South West Coast Path is England's longest waymarked long-distance {{footpath}} and a National Trail. It stretches for , {{running from}} Minehead in Somerset, along {{the coasts of}} Devon and Cornwall, to Poole Harbour in Dorset. Since <b>it</b> <b>rises</b> and falls with every river mouth, {{it is also one}} of the more challenging trails. The total height climbed has been calculated to be 114,931ft (35,031m), almost four times the height of Mount Everest. It has been voted 'Britain's Best Walking route' twice in a row by readers of the Ramblers Walk magazine, and regularly features in lists of the world's best walks.|$|E
5|$|The {{source of}} the River Hull is in the Yorkshire Wolds. <b>It</b> <b>rises</b> {{from a series of}} springs to the west of Driffield, near the site of the medieval village of Elmswell. The Elmswell Beck flows eastwards from these, and is joined by the Little Driffield Beck, which flows southwards from Little Driffield. It {{continues}} as the Driffield Beck, flowing around the south-western edge of Driffield, where it is joined by the Driffield Trout Stream. After the junction, it becomes the River Hull or the West Beck and flows to the east, before turning south to reach Corps Landing. For much of the route below Driffield, the Driffield Navigation runs parallel to the river.|$|E
5|$|When submerged, a crocodilian's {{heart rate}} slows {{down to one}} or two beats a minute, and blood flow to the muscles is reduced. When <b>it</b> <b>rises</b> and takes a breath, its heart rate speeds up in seconds, and the muscles receive newly oxygenated blood. Unlike many marine mammals, {{crocodilians}} have little myoglobin to store oxygen in their muscles. During diving, muscles are supplied with oxygen when an increasing concentration of bicarbonate ions causes haemoglobin in the blood to release oxygen.|$|E

5|$|As pH {{rises above}} 0 the above yellow hydrolyzed species form and as <b>it</b> <b>rises</b> above 2–3, reddish-brown hydrous iron(III) oxide {{precipitates}} out of solution. Although Fe3+ has an d5 configuration, its absorption spectrum {{is not like}} that of Mn2+ with its weak, spin-forbidden d–d bands, because Fe3+ has higher positive charge and is more polarizing, lowering the energy of its ligand-to-metal charge transfer absorptions. Thus, all the above complexes are rather strongly colored, with the single exception of the hexaquo ion – and even that has a spectrum dominated by charge transfer in the near ultraviolet region. On the other hand, the pale green iron(II) hexaquo ion 2+ does not undergo appreciable hydrolysis. Carbon dioxide is not evolved when carbonate anions are added, which instead results in white iron(II) carbonate being precipitated out. In excess carbon dioxide this forms the slightly soluble bicarbonate, which occurs commonly in groundwater, but it oxidises quickly in air to form iron(III) oxide that accounts for the brown deposits present in a sizeable number of streams.|$|E
5|$|Bateman was {{referring}} to Longdendale, and the upper valley of the River Etherow. The {{western side of the}} Peak District is drained by the Etherow, Goyt, and Tame which are tributaries of the River Mersey. The north east is drained by tributaries of the River Don. Of the tributaries of the River Trent, that drain the south and east, the River Derwent is the most prominent. <b>It</b> <b>rises</b> on Bleaklow just east of Glossop and flows through the Upper Derwent Valley where it is constrained by the Howden, Derwent and Ladybower Reservoirs. The River Noe and the River Wye are its tributaries. The River Manifold and River Dove, in the south west whose sources are on Axe Edge Moor flow into the Trent, while the River Dane flows into the River Weaver.|$|E
5|$|Brain tissue consumes a {{large amount}} of energy in {{proportion}} to its volume, so large brains place severe metabolic demands on animals. The need to limit body weight in order, for example, to fly, has apparently led to selection for a reduction of brain size in some species, such as bats. Most of the brain's energy consumption goes into sustaining the electric charge (membrane potential) of neurons. Most vertebrate species devote between 2% and 8% of basal metabolism to the brain. In primates, however, the percentage is much higher—in humans <b>it</b> <b>rises</b> to 20–25%. The energy consumption of the brain does not vary greatly over time, but active regions of the cerebral cortex consume somewhat more energy than inactive regions; this forms the basis for the functional brain imaging methods PET, fMRI, and NIRS. The brain typically gets most of its energy from oxygen-dependent metabolism of glucose (i.e., blood sugar), but ketones provide a major alternative source, together with contributions from medium chain fatty acids (caprylic and heptanoic acids), lactate, acetate, and possibly amino acids.|$|E

5|$|Dating from 1074 to 1548, Lincoln Cathedral {{is one of}} {{the largest}} of England’s cathedrals and it has been claimed by John Ruskin that, architecturally, it is worth any two of the others put together. Edward Freeman {{described}} it as “one of the loveliest of human works.” It retains portions of the three massive arches of the Norman west front and much heavily restored sculpture around the central portal. The central tower is the tallest in England and is visible for many miles as <b>it</b> <b>rises</b> in spectacular fashion from a high hill. The decagonal Chapter House with its huge flying buttresses is the first polygonal chapter house in England. Of the interior, the finest part is considered to be the late-13th-century “Angel Choir” with “gorgeous layers of tracery” and enriched with carved angels. The transepts have two rose windows, the “Dean’s Eye” on the north dating from c. 1200 and retaining its original glass, while the Flowing Decorated “Bishop’s Eye” on the south is filled with salvaged medieval fragments.|$|E
5|$|In 1910s, London, Nurse Helen Chester (Jacqueline Pierreux) {{is called}} to a large house to prepare the corpse of an elderly medium for her burial. As she dresses the body, she notices a {{sapphire}} ring on its finger. Chester steals it, accidentally tipping over {{a glass of water}} which drips on the floor; she is then assailed by a fly. Chester takes her ring home to her flat and witnesses strange events. The fly returns and continues to pester her, and the lights in her apartment go out as the sound of the dripping water is heard from various locations. Chester finds the woman's corpse lying in her bed. <b>It</b> <b>rises</b> and floats toward her. Chester begs for forgiveness, but ultimately strangles herself. The next morning, the concierge (Harriet White Medin) discovers Chester's body and calls the police. The pathologist arrives to examine the body and only finds a small bruise on her left finger where her ring once was. As the doctor announces this observation, the concierge appears distressed and hears the dripping of water.|$|E
5|$|Larrys Creek flows {{south from}} the {{dissected}} Allegheny Plateau to the Ridge-and-valley Appalachians. <b>It</b> <b>rises</b> in Cogan House Township and flows south to Green Mountain. There it turns southwest and flows under the Cogan House Covered Bridge, {{which is on}} the National Register of Historic Places and one of only three remaining covered bridges in Lycoming County. At Buckhorn Mountain it turns south through Pennsylvania State Game Lands (SGL) No. 114 and flows through Mifflin and Anthony Townships, passing between Coal Mountain and Harris Point. From Mifflin Township it enters the borough of Salladasburg, where it receives the Second Fork, and just south of the borough the First Fork joins the creek. These two largest tributaries drain parts of Pine, Cogan House, Cummings, and Mifflin Townships (there are named streams in the Larrys Creek watershed in all but Pine Township). Piatt Township is the last municipality the creek flows through and it enters the West Branch Susquehanna River there.|$|E
