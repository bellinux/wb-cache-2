5000|$|Drape must be [...] "pleated" [...] or {{installed}} with folds for {{a finished}} look. Typically 1.5-ft to 2.0 ft of drape {{is used for}} each running foot to be covered. The industry standard fabric for trade show drapery is Banjo. Banjo is a <b>dobby-weave</b> fabric made from a medium-sheen polyester yarn. It is inherently flame resistant and machine washable. Inherent flame resistance means the flame retardant characteristics will not fade with washing. Booths require two different sizes of drape: 8’ long drape which hangs between 8’ high uprights and 3’ long drape which hangs between 3’ uprights and the 3’ slot on 8’ uprights.|$|E
