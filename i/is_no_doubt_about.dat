Its effects are recorded at Rome, Sicily, Spain, and in Africaindeed, Maximian encouraged particularly strict enforcement of the edict in Africa. Africa's political elite were insistent that the persecution be fulfilled, and Africa's Christians, especially in Numidia, were equally insistent on resisting them. For the Numidians, to hand over scriptures was an act of terrible apostasy. Africa had long been home to the Church of the Martyrsin Africa, martyrs held more religious authority than the clergyand harbored a particularly intransigent, fanatical, and legalistic variety of Christianity. It was Africa that gave the West most of its martyrdoms.|$|E

In Augustus' own words: Alpes a regione ea, quae proxima est Hadriatico mari, ad Tuscum pacari feci, nullae genti bello per iniuriam inlato ("I pacified the Alps {{all the way}} from the Adriatic to the Tyrrhenian seas, without waging an unjust war on any tribe").

25|$|The Dacians {{knew about}} writing. Permanent {{contacts}} with the Graeco-Roman world had brought {{the use of the}} Greek and later the Latin alphabet. It is also certainly not the case that writing with Greek and Latin letters and knowledge of Greek and Latin were known in all the settlements scattered throughout Dacia, but there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>about</b> the existence of such knowledge in some circles of Dacian society. However, the most revealing discoveries concerning the use of the writing by the Dacians occurred in the citadels on the Sebes mountains. Some groups of letters from stone blocks at Sarmisegetuza might express personal names; these can not now be read because the wall is ruined, and because it is impossible to restore the original order of the blocks in the wall.|$|E

500|$|The {{match was}} preceded by an All Black haka, to which the crowd responded with the Welsh {{national}} song [...] "Land of my Fathers". Wales had developed tactics to negate the seven-man New Zealand scrum, and removed a man from their scrum to play as a [...] "rover", equivalent to Gallaher's wing-forward position. Gallaher was consistently penalised by the Scottish referee, John Dallas, who held that the New Zealander was feeding {{the ball into the}} scrum incorrectly. This eventually compelled Gallaher to instruct his team not to contest the scrums, and therefore give Wales possession following each scrum. Bob Deans, playing at wing for New Zealand that day, later said that Dallas had gone [...] "out to penalise Gallaherthere <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>about</b> that". Teddy Morgan scored an unconverted try for Wales shortly before half-time to give the home side a 3–0 lead.|$|E

500|$|An {{article on}} the historicity of the Icelandic sagas notes that [...] "Brodir" [...] is not a Norse proper name at all, and is itself derived from the Irish name {{variously}} written as Bruattar, Bruadar or Brodur. According to the article, the name first appears in the Annals of Ulster in the year 853, when a princeling of south-east Ireland named Bruattar mac Aeda {{was involved in the}} murder of a rival before being slain himself. The name only appears in Norse context twice — at the Battle of Clontarf, and in 1160 for the King of Dublin, Brodar mac Torcaill — and had a longer circulation in Irish literature. The same article also suggests that while there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>about</b> the historical truth of the Battle of Clontarf, the name [...] "Ospakr", along with other names in the Njál's saga account of the Clontarf episode, may have been borrowed from the Landnámabók.|$|E

[...] Critic Maria Schurr of PopMatters wrote that [...] "one half of Fay's Life Is People proves worthy of such a long wait...those who Life Is People touches are unlikely to hear a more inspiring album this year." [...] Prefix magazine's Matthew Fiander stated that while it [...] "does have its missteps...Life is People {{may not be the best}} Bill Fay, but hearing this there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>about</b> one thing: it's great to have him back.

500|$|In the Channel 4 drama Boy A, {{released}} in November 2007, he portrayed a notorious killer {{trying to find}} new life after prison. The role garnered him the 2008 British Academy Television Award for Best Actor. Amy Biancolli of the Houston Chronicle wrote that [...] "there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>about</b> the intelligence and sensitivity" [...] of Garfield's portrayal. Minneapolis Star Tribune Christy DeSmith echoed Biancolli's sentiment, citing his [...] "detailed expressions" [...] as an example. Writing in The Seattle Times, John Hartl noted that Garfield demonstrated range in the role, and concluded: [...] "Garfield always manages to capture his passion". Joe Morgenstern, the critic for The Wall Street Journal, dubbed Garfield's performance [...] "phenomenal", assessing that he [...] "makes room for the many and various pieces of Jack's personality". In 2008, he had a minor role in the film The Other Boleyn Girl, and was {{named one of the}} shooting stars at the Berlin International Film Festival. In 2009, Garfield held supporting roles in the Terry Gilliam film The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus and the Red Riding television trilogy. Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times thought that Garfield gave a stand out performance in the latter.|$|E

500|$|As of July 1989 about $500 {{million in}} {{donations}} had been {{delivered to the}} Armenians from 113 countries. Most of those funds went into the initial relief work and medical care plus the beginning portion of the rebuilding phase. Yuri S. Mkhitarian, an Armenian State Building Committee official, gave an updated damage report that included some of the outlying communities away from the population centers stating that 342 villages were damaged and another 58 were destroyed. The negative effect the earthquake had on the economy of Armenia was apparent. Mkhitarian said that 130 factories were destroyed and 170,000 people were out of work. Officials acknowledged that the work to complete the rebuilding may take {{up to five years}} or longer, a supposition that more than doubled Gorbachev's estimate of two years. At that time 20 projects had completed the planning process and some had been approved and construction started. In Leninakan there was a need for 18 new hospitals, 12 of which could be funded {{with the assistance of the}} republics of the Soviet Union, but foreign help would be required to build six additional facilities. Boris Karapetyan, director of earthquake studies at the Yerevan Polytechnical Institute, said of the difficult rebuilding process [...] "Coordination is a major, major problem. This is a massive undertaking, and foreign involvement is both a necessary and a complicating factor. We need foreign assistance—and there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>about</b> that—but our friends do not know the local conditions and propose things that cannot or should not be built in an earthquake-prone region." ...|$|E
500|$|With the 2012 {{continuation}} of Dallas, {{there was talk}} of some Knots Landing characters returning to air. Rumors began surfacing that both Van Ark and Shackelford would reprise their roles as Valene and Gary. Ted Shackelford passed on the small role the producers offered him to reprise his role as Gary Ewing on the new series. [...] Van Ark refuted the claims, saying: [...] "Well, rumor has it… I’m having lunch with Ted tomorrow. They asked him to come down and be part of it. It was several months ago, and he’s deeply into filming The Young and the Restless, the daytime soap for CBS. But if they asked Gary, maybe they’ll ask [...]" [...] She would, however, love to be involved if the producers asked her, especially to torment fellow cast-member Larry Hagman. [...] "There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>about</b> it. This man I loved so much, Larry Hagman… I was just at his birthday party several months ago… I would kill, that if Val came back, if it was trouble for J.R.. Because they were always at odds." [...] However, Gary and Valene's daughter, Lucy Ewing, along with Ray Krebbs have made appearances in the new series. Although both Shackleford and Van Ark appeared in the 1991 series finale of Dallas playing [...] "alternative" [...] versions of Gary and Valene (the episode depicted a fantasy world in which J.R. had never been born), there have been no real crossovers of story or characters from Knots Landing to Dallas or vice versa since the 1985-86 season of each show (which, on Dallas, {{turned out to be a}} dream had by Pamela Ewing).|$|E

2500|$|The {{high level}} of {{awareness}} and organized political lobbying {{has resulted in a}} disproportionate level of funding and resources given to breast cancer research and care. Favoring breast cancer with disproportionate research may have the unintended consequence of costing lives elsewhere. In 2001 UK MP Ian Gibson said, [...] "The treatment has been skewed by the lobbying, there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>about</b> that.

Similarly, Stein commented in 1938 on Benito Mussolini, Adolf Hitler, Franklin D.
