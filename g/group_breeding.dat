The pair bonds of the parrots and cockatoos are strong and a pair remains close during the nonbreeding season, even if they join larger flocks.

Cooperative breeding, where birds other than the breeding pair help raise the young and is common in some bird families, is extremely rare in parrots, and has only unambiguously been demonstrated in the El Oro parakeet and the golden parakeet (which may also exhibit polygamous, or <b>group</b> <b>breeding,</b> behaviour with multiple females contributing to the clutch).|$|E

25|$|It {{was found}} that {{it is easier for}} males to travel alone and move between groups {{as a result of the}} {{solidarity}} they experienced before finding their own <b>breeding</b> <b>group.</b> Before reaching the age of sexual maturity, males leave their natal group and go through a “bachelor stage” that can last several years either in solitary or in a nonbreeding group. However, while both sexes leave their birth group, females are never found alone; they just travel from <b>breeding</b> <b>group</b> to <b>breeding</b> <b>group.</b> It was also found that males like to settle with other male members of their family. Their <b>breeding</b> <b>groups</b> consist of one silverback male, three adult females and their offspring. The male gorilla takes on the role of the protector. Females tend to make bonds with other females in their natal group only, but rather form strong bonds with males. Males also compete aggressively with each other for contact with females.|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} was to quantify impact by the elephants on the woody vegetation by investigating vegetation and habitat use by elephant bachelor and <b>breeding</b> <b>groups.</b> This was determined by comparing resource use between sexes within seasons, and within sexes between seasons. Data were collected at two ecological scales: feeding patch scale and habitat scale. Feeding data were collected from 202 food plots, defined from 161 elephant sightings. In the dry season, when resources are often limited, no difference in feeding patch use was found between bachelor <b>groups</b> and <b>breeding</b> <b>groups.</b> This may suggest a lack of inter-sexual competition and could therefore suggest that the elephant population is currently below carrying capacity. Three habitat types are available to the elephants: plateau, hillslope and valley bottom.

40|$|Background: Why {{individuals}} {{breed in}} groups and why patterns of <b>group</b> <b>breeding</b> are so variable are long-standing questions in evolutionary ecology. Researchers {{have tended to}} study either population-level patterns such as breeding group size or else the decisions that individuals make when joining groups, but have rarely explicitly linked the two, using knowledge of individual decisions to predict larger-scale population patterns.

This approach places <b>group</b> <b>breeding</b> within an evolutionary context by first elucidating the process of group formation, identifying decision rules that individuals use when joining groups, and verifying their fitness consequences, then using these individual-level processes to predict and understand patterns of population-level variation.

40|$|Kin-based {{social groups}} are {{commonly}} studied among cooperatively breeding species {{but have been}} less studied in "nontraditional" <b>group</b> <b>breeding</b> systems. We investigated the presence of kin-based sociality among females in the common eider (Somateria mollisima), a colonial nesting sea duck that exhibits high levels of natal philopatry in females. Previous studies of female sociality in common eiders have been restricted to observations during brood rearing. However, aggregations of female common eiders are also observed during other periods {{of the life cycle}} such as colony arrival and nesting. Here we apply a novel, empirical framework using molecular markers and field sampling to genetically characterize female social groups at several stages of the common eider life cycle. When compared with mean estimates of interindividual relatedness for the entire colony, significantly higher levels of relatedness were found between females within groups arriving to the colony in flight, between females and nearest neighbors at the time of nest site selection, and between groups of females departing the colony with ducklings. Both full-sibling and half-sibling equivalent relationships were also found within these groups. Therefore, throughout each of several stages including in-flight colony arrival, nesting, and brood rearing, we provide the first genetically confirmed evidence of female kin-based social groups in common eiders and anseriformes in general.

A cohort of 842 Kooiker dogs, the offspring of 195 sires and 318 dams, was screened for PL from 1994 to 2011. The cohort was included in a pedigree of 1737 Kooiker dogs comprising nine generations. PL was present in 24 % of screened dogs, with unilateral and bilateral luxation being observed equally frequently. Medial PL was more common (61 %) than lateral PL (32 %) or bidirectional PL (7 %). The frequency of PL was similar in male and female dogs, with a female:male relative risk of 1. 15 (95 % confidence interval, CI, 0. 90 - 1. 48).

40|$|Ecological genetic {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that spatial patterns of mating dispersal, the dispersal of gametes through mating behaviour, can facilitate inbreeding avoidance and strongly influence the structure of populations, particularly in highly philopatric species. Elements of <b>breeding</b> <b>group</b> dynamics, such as strong structuring and sex-biased dispersal among groups, can also minimize inbreeding and positively influence levels of genetic diversity within populations. Rock-wallabies are highly philopatric mid-sized mammals whose strong dependence on rocky terrain has resulted in series of discreet, small colonies in the landscape. Populations show no signs of inbreeding and maintain high levels of genetic diversity despite strong patterns of limited gene flow within and among colonies. We used this species to investigate the importance of mating dispersal and <b>breeding</b> <b>group</b> structure to inbreeding avoidance within a ‘small’ population. We examined the spatial patterns of mating dispersal, the extent of kinship within <b>breeding</b> <b>groups,</b> and the degree of relatedness among brush-tailed rock-wallaby breeding pairs within a colony in southeast Queensland. Parentage data revealed remarkably restricted mating dispersal and strong <b>breeding</b> <b>group</b> structuring for a mid-sized mammal. <b>Breeding</b> <b>groups</b> showed significant levels of female kinship with evidence of male dispersal among groups.
