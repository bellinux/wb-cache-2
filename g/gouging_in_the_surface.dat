50|$|Along {{the eastern}} face the crater has {{apparently}} merged {{with one or}} two other impacts, producing an outward double-bulge. There are several smaller impacts along the eastern rim, and a <b>gouge</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> forms a trough leading away to the northeast for nearly a crater diameter. Much of the interior floor of van't Hoff is relatively level, and is marked by some small craterlets. The most prominent of these is a small, cup-shaped crater <b>in</b> <b>the</b> southern half.|$|R

[...] The iron of the {{smoothing plane}} is generally sharpened straight across or with a slightly arched cutting edge (or at least with rounded corners) to prevent unsightly grooves from being <b>gouged</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wood <b>surface</b> when it is planed.|$|R
50|$|This {{asteroid}} {{was visited}} by the NEAR Shoemaker spacecraft during June 1997, {{on its way}} to asteroid 433 Eros. During the flyby, the spacecraft imaged a hemisphere of the asteroid, revealing many large craters that have <b>gouged</b> out depressions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface.</b> It was <b>the</b> first C-type asteroid to be explored and, until 21 Lutetia was visited in 2010, it was the largest asteroid to be visited by a spacecraft.|$|R
50|$|The rim of Alekhin {{has been}} heavily eroded by {{subsequent}} impacts {{to the point}} where the edge is little more than a curving rise <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface.</b> <b>The</b> outer wall is completely overlain by the crater pair formed by crater Dawson across the northwest rim and Dawson D on the northern rim. The southern rim is somewhat more heavily marked by <b>gouges</b> and irregularities <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface,</b> compared to <b>the</b> northeast rim. On the floor are a number of tiny craterlets.|$|R

This asteroid was visited by the NEARShoemaker spacecraft during June 1997, on its way to asteroid 433Eros. During the flyby, the spacecraft imaged a hemisphere of the asteroid, revealing many large craters that had <b>gouged</b> out depressions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface.</b> It was <b>the</b> first carbonaceous asteroid to be explored and, until 21Lutetia was visited <b>in</b> 2010, was <b>the</b> largest asteroid to be visited by a spacecraft.|$|R
40|$|Aerodynamic tests <b>in</b> {{support of}} <b>the</b> Columbia {{accident}} investigation {{were conducted in}} two hypersonic wind tunnels at the NASA Langley Research Center, the 20 -Inch Mach 6 Air Tunnel and the 20 -Inch CF 4 Tunnel. The primary purpose of these tests was to measure the forces and moments generated {{by a variety of}} outer mold line alterations (damage scenarios) using 0. 0075 -scale models of the Space Shuttle Orbiter. Simultaneously acquired global heat transfer mappings were obtained for a majority of the configurations tested. Test parametrics included angles of attack from 38 to 42 deg, unit Reynolds numbers from 0. 3 x 10 (exp 6) to 3. 0 x 10 (exp 6) per foot, and normal shock density ratios of 5 (Mach 6 air) and 12 (CF 4). The damage scenarios evaluated included asymmetric boundary layer transition, <b>gouges</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> windward <b>surface</b> thermal protection system tiles, wing leading edge damage (partially and fully missing reinforced carbon-carbon (RCC) panels), deformation of <b>the</b> wing windward <b>surface,</b> and main landing gear and/or door deployment. The measured aerodynamic increments for the damage scenarios examined were generally small in magnitude, as were the flight-derived values during most of the entry prior to loss of communication. A progressive damage scenario is presented that qualitatively matches the flight observations for the STS- 107 entry...|$|R

30|$|Experiments have {{demonstrated}} that the friction coefficient of a gouge containing clay minerals mixed with sand becomes lower as the clay content increases (Shimamoto and Logan 1981; Takahashi et al. 2007). Low friction coefficients have also been widely reported in natural faults, including 0.1 – 0.2 for fault <b>gouge</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> San Andreas fault (Carpenter et al. 2015) and 0.3 for fault <b>gouge</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Taiwan Chelungpu fault (Mizoguchi et al. 2008). <b>The</b> low values <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fault <b>gouges</b> of the Atera fault could be ascribed {{to the presence of}} large amounts of clay minerals.|$|R

50|$|The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) {{investigation}} found a <b>gouge</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pipe, probably caused by excavation equipment years earlier; {{in combination with}} brittle pipe material and excessive operating pressures likely led to the rupture.

Also, NTSB found that Texas Eastern failed to adequately monitor excavation activity on its right of way.|$|R

The aim of this work was to compare these approaches. It was hypothesised that the two methods would yield consistent results. The studied faults were located <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Rychleby Mts, part of the Sudetic Marginal Fault Zone. The relative age of the faults was determined <b>in</b> <b>the</b> field {{through the application of}} the intersection law. The fault <b>gouges</b> were sampled <b>in</b> a crystalline limestone quarry near the village of Vápenná. The mineralogical composition of the fault gouges has been established by XRD analysis of powder samples and analysis of preferentially oriented clay minerals. From our result, it is clear that these two approaches yielded consistent results with regard to the relative age of the faults...|$|R
50|$|Wet gate {{printing}} {{eliminates the}} refraction itself by filling <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gouges</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> substrate with a fluid such as perchloroethene that shares {{approximately the same}} refractive index as the substrate.
