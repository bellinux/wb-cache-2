30|$|For {{the control}} reactor (CTRL), {{approximately}} 20 % reduction of glucose was observed. As expected, the glucose reduction should be from adsorption {{process of the}} CA matrix. A previous publication reviewed adsorption ability of entrapment matrices which was commonly found at the early stage of matrix utilization (Siripattanakul and Khan, 2010). In case of the entrapped cell reutilization, no or less adsorption would be observed (Siripattanakul et al. 2008). It {{was clear that the}} <b>entrapped</b> <b>yeast</b> cell systems successfully reduced glucose by matrix adsorption (glucose immobilization) and biodegradation (glucose bioconversion) but the main process was biodegradation. In other words, the <b>entrapped</b> <b>yeast</b> cells potentially produced ethanol.|$|E

The yeast cells (approximately 6  ×  109  cells/mL) were homogenously mixed with sodium alginate solution of 2 % (w/v). The cell-to-matrix ratio of 1 : 5 (volume of wet cells:volume of sodium alginate) was applied followed the optimum <b>entrapped</b> <b>yeast</b> cell preparation described earlier (Siripattanakul et al. 2010 b). The mixtures were manually dropped into a calcium chloride solution of 3.5 % (w/v) using a sterile syringe (bead size of 3 – 5  mm). The droplets remained in the solution for 2  h to form and harden spherical beads.|$|E
40|$|To {{overcome}} {{the problem of}} enzyme extraction and poor permeability of cell membrane to lactose, permeabilization of Kluyveromyces marxianus cells was carried. Permeabilized whole cells can also be advantageous over more pure enzyme preparations due to increased stability maintained by the intracellular environment. In view {{of the advantages of}} immobilized cell system over free cell system, the permeabilized yeast cells were immobilized by entrapment in calcium alginate gel. Different process parameters (alginate concentration, bead size, biomass load, temperature, agitation, incubation time) were optimized to enhance the lactose hydrolysis. Maximum lactose hydrolysis (84. 8 %) was observed with yeast cells immobilized in 2 % (w/v) alginate concentration after 150 min of treatment time. The developed system was highly stable and the alginate <b>entrapped</b> <b>yeast</b> cells can be recycled up to 7 th cycle without any significant decrease in their ability to carry out the lactose hydrolysis...|$|E

40|$|A method {{originally}} developed for <b>entrapping</b> invertase-active <b>yeast</b> cells (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) in gelatin {{has been extended}} to enzymes. Six enzymes belonging to three different classes were immobilised in gelatin made insoluble by formaldehyde. The activity yield of the resulting immobilised enzyme preparations ranged from 9. 6 to 48. 0 %. These values, however, can be roughly doubled by crushing the immobilised enzyme particles into very small fragments, thus indicating that indipendently of enzyme sensitivity to formaldehyde or of enzyme interaction with gelatin, the limiting factor is mass transfer resistance to diffusion of substrate into the insolubilised gelatin matrix...|$|R

Despite being the main treatment, dialysis and other therapeutic approaches are not only associated with numerous long-term adverse complications often leading to morbidity and mortality events, but are also not affordable. Orally administrating Alginate-Poly-L-Lysine-Alginate microcapsules <b>entrapping</b> live <b>yeast</b> cells to treat renal failure uremia {{has not yet been}} investigated. In this thesis, the growth and microencapsulation of yeast were optimized. The efficacy of these microcapsules in removing unwanted electrolytes was tested in vitro in simulated gastro-intestinal media, in vitro in a column bioreactor and in vivo in an uremic rat model. Results showed that these novel microcapsules can not only maintain morphological stability and membrane integrity under gastro-intestinal environments and mechanical stresses, but also, preserve the viability of yeast. These microcapsules were successful in reducing urea concentrations while not harming the human GI tract's microbial flora...|$|R
40|$|In this study, we {{investigated}} {{measurements of the}} intrinsic fluorescence of yeast hexokinase as an assay for glucose and immobilization of the enzyme in a silica sol-get matrix as a potential in vivo glucose sensor for use in patients with diabetes. The intrinsic fluorescence of hexokinase in solution (excitation = 295 nm, emission = 330 nm) decreased by 23 % at a saturating glucose concentration of 1 mM (K-d = 0. 3 mM), but serum abolished the glucose-related fluorescence response. When entrapped in tetramethylorthosilicate-derived sol gel, hexokinase retained activity, with a 25 % maximal glucose-related decrease in intrinsic fluorescence, and the saturation point was increased to 50 mM glucose (K-d = 12. 5 mM). The glucose response range was increased further (to 120 mM, K-d = 57 mM) by a covering membrane of poly(2 -hydroxyethyl) methacrylate. Unlike free enzyme, the fluorescence responses to glucose with sol-gel immobilized hexokinase, with or Without covering membrane, were similar for buffer and serum. We conclude that fluorescence monitoring of sol-gel <b>entrapped</b> <b>yeast</b> hexokinase is a Suitable system for development as an in vivo glucose biosensor. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|Abstract: Azo dyes {{that are}} {{extensively}} used in textile industries are recalcitrant xenobiotic compounds causing a serious {{damage to the}} environment. Degradation of azo dyes being a necessity diverse dye dumped soils were screened for dye degrading yeasts. One efficient yeast isolate capable of decolorizing both mono-azo dyes and di-azo dyes was selected, immobilized by entrapment method and studied for decolorization efficiency. The isolate was morphologically, culturally and biochemically identified as Saccharomyces sp. Sodium alginate <b>entrapped</b> <b>yeast</b> cells were studied for decolorization of commercially available textile dyes having azo groups. The extent of colour removal in the culture medium was assessed through the decrease in dye absorbance of the supernatants. The immobilized yeast’s decolorization abilities were different and varied with inoculum size, incubation time and nutrients like carbon and nitrogen sources. The fermentation conditions like pH, temperature and aeration had no profound effect. The decolorization ranged from 70 - 100 %. Complete decolorization was seen within 12 and 18 hrs depending on inoculum size. The immobilized beads with yeasts could be reused efficiently for three cycles. The dye degrading immobilized Saccharomyces isolate could be commercially significant as it is efficiently degrading both mono-azo and di-azo dyes, different dye waste waters in a semi-continuous manner and so {{could also be used}} for detoxification of industrial effluents...|$|E
40|$|The {{hydrodynamic}} {{study of}} a three-phase airlift (TPAL) bioreactor with an enlarged gas–liquid dual separator was carried out. Different lengths and diameters of the draft tube were tested {{to show how the}} design of the separator zone affects the hydrodynamic performance of the TPAL reactor. Ca-alginate beads with <b>entrapped</b> <b>yeast</b> biomass at different loadings (0, 7, 14 and 21 % v/v) were used in order to mimic the solid phase of conventional high cell density systems, such as those with cells immobilized on carriers or flocculating cells. Important information on multiphase flow and distribution of gas and solid phases in the internal-loop airlift reactor (ALR) with high solids loading was obtained, which can be used for suggesting optimal hydrodynamic conditions in a TPAL bioreactor with high solids loading. It is finally suggested that the ALR with a dual separator and a downcomer to riser cross-sectional area ratio (AD/AR) ranging from 1. 2 to 2. 0 can be successfully applied to batch/continuous high cell density systems, where the uniform distribution of solid phase, its efficient separation of particles from the liquid phase, and an improved residence time of air bubbles inside the reactor are desirable.

40|$|Mead is a {{traditional}} alcoholic beverage obtained by the fermentation of diluted honey performed by yeasts. In this work the potential of application of immobilised yeast cells on single-layer Ca-alginate or double-layer alginateechitosan for mead production was assessed for the first time. The meads produced either with entrapped or free cells were evaluated in terms of quality and aroma profile. The immobilisation procedure had no adverse effect on cell viability, since minor {{differences were found in}} fermentation kinetics among the strains and immobilisation systems. The double-layer alginate-chitosan had no advantage compared with the single-layer Ca-alginate, as the number of free cells in the medium, resulting from cell leakage, was similar. Although meads obtained with <b>entrapped</b> <b>yeast</b> cells presented less ethanol and glycerol and more acetic acid, it exhibited larger amounts of volatile compounds. Immobilised cells produced meads with more compounds with fruity characteristics, such as ethyl octanoate and ethyl hexanoate; however the concentrations of undesirable compounds in such meads were also higher. The effect of immobilisation on the aroma profile was important, but the strain contribution was also of major importance. Thus, the sensory analysis of final product gives an important insight on the overall quality.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{formulate}} {{and evaluate}} acyclovir microcapsules using bakers yeast. MethodsAcyclovir, pretreated yeast and deionised water were taken at a volumetric ratio of 1 : 2 : 4 respectively. This suspension was agitated in a magnetic stirrer at 25 °C, 30 °C, 35 °C, and 40 °C for 4 hours. The suspension was then centrifuged for 10 minutes at 2 000 rpm. The supernatant solution was decanted and {{the cells were}} washed 5 times with deionised water. Then the suspended drug <b>entrapped</b> <b>yeast</b> cells were dried in a lyophillizer for 48 hours. The yield was noted. ResultsThe first four formulations were done with 200 mg of the drug, followed by 400 mg {{for the next four}} formulations and 800 mg the last four formulations. SEM showed that the surface of the microcapsules was intact, with no burst characteristics. FTIR showed no interaction between acyclovir and the cell wall. DSC showed that the peak was within the standard values. The mean particle size for all the samples was 8 μm in diameter. The dissolution studies were done for all the twelve samples and showed a Fickian model of diffusion. ConclusionsFrom the results it is inferred that the samples prepared at 40 °C (FY- 4, FY- 8, FY- 12) show better entrapment and release. So these samples are formulated {{in the form of a}} suspension and compared with marketed acyclovir suspension using HPLC technique. The formulated suspensions with FY- 4, FY- 8 and FY- 12 shows drug content in accordance with the standards of the pharmacopoeial limits...|$|E
40|$|Conventional {{techniques}} of measuring diffusivity (Ddollarlcub ercubdollar) in gel entrapment matrices are not practical {{due to the}} poor mechanical stability of such solids. A novel apparatus was therefore designed to measure Ddollarlcub ercubdollar and partition coefficient (Kdollarlcub prcub) dollar of glucose in alginate gels using radiotracer techniques. In this method, a specially prepared, large, spherical alginate bead was mounted to a stainless-steel rod and the sphere immersed in a liquid phase of limited volume. By rotating the bead at high angular velocities, the rate of Cdollarlcub 14 rcubdollar-glucose uptake or release was measured using a scintillation spectrometer, under conditions of near ideal mixing and negligible film mass transfer resistance. A model equation describing unsteady-state mass transfer in a sphere immersed in a liquid phase of limited volume {{was used to evaluate}} Ddollarlcub ercubdollar.;When the initial glucose concentration in the liquid phase was increased from 3 to 300 kg. mdollarlcub- 3 rcubdollar, an exponential increase in Ddollarlcub ercubdollar values was observed. However, at all concentrations the ratio Ddollarlcub ercubdollar/D was constant at 0. 91 where D is the free-phase diffusivity of glucose in water. The temperature dependence of Ddollarlcub ercubdollar obeyed the Arrhenius relationship and the activation energy for diffusion of glucose in cell-free and cell-occupied (118 kg dry weight/mdollar 3 dollar of gel) Ca-alginate beads was found to be 21. 3 and 20. 1 kJ. moldollarlcub- 1 rcubdollar, respectively.;Increase in the concentration of either Ca-alginate, chelating agent (CaCldollar 2 dollar or BaCldollar 2 dollar), or <b>entrapped</b> <b>yeast</b> cells, all caused significant reductions in the values of Ddollarlcub ercubdollar.;Attempts were made to develop appropriate correlations for predicting Ddollarlcub ercubdollar and suitable literature correlations tested whenever possible. The significance of the data reported in this study was assessed in terms of the stability characteristics of the alginate gel matrix and the reported kinetic properties of entrapped cells...|$|E
40|$|In {{this work}} yeast cells were {{entrapped}} in single or double layer calcium alginate beads coated with chitosan. These beads {{were used for}} the alcoholic fermentation of carbohydrates. In {{the first part of this}} work it was attempted to define the optimal conditions for the construction of the double layer alginate - chitosan beads. Several construction parameters of these beads were studied. These parameters included the composition of the inner and the outer layer, the concentration of chitosan in the coating solution, the period of time that these beads should be left in the coating solution and the initial cell loading in the inner layer of the beads. In addition the procedure for the construction of the beads was taken in consideration. The influence of the above parameters on the behaviour of the beads and the behaviour of the <b>entrapped</b> <b>yeast</b> cells during fermentations was studied. As a result of the coating the calcium alginate beads with chitosan was the increase of their mechanical and chemical stability. The coating of beads with chitosan had no effect on the behaviour of the entrapped cells. The procedure for the construction of the beads followed a certain procedure: Construction of the double layer alginate beads was followed by the coating of beads with chitosan. The presence of the outer layer and the polyelectrolyte complex between the alginate and the chitosan hindered the cell leakage from the beads into the medium in a high level. Both the concentration of the alginate in the outer layer and the coating with chitosan did not have any effect on the kinetics of the fermentations and the composition of the products. Increasing the concentration of the coating solutions up to 10 g chitosan/l resulted in the improvement of the behaviour of the beads. The period of time needed for the coating of the beads in the chitosan solution was approximately the same as the period of time needed for the reaction between most of the alginate of the beads with the chitosan. The staying of the beads in the chitosan solution for a greater period of time didn’t improve the behaviour of the beads, while it had a negative effect on the behaviour of the entrapped cells. The initial cell loading found to be an important parameter for the construction of the beads. Lower cell loading resulted in the increase of cell leakage while higher cell loading increased the fermentation rate but reduced the mechanical stability of the beads. In the second part of this work yeast cells entrapped in the double layer alginate - chitosan beads {{were used for the}} continuous production of wine. Also “free” yeast cells from the same strain and “free” yeast cells from the must were used under similar conditions for the production of wine by the procedure of batch fermentation. The maximum productivity of wine and ethanol achieved during the continuous process was 3 - 4 times higher than the productivity achieved during the batch processes. The wines produced by the immobilized and “free” yeast cells from the same strain were similar in the final composition with the only difference that the concentration of the higher alcohols was lower for the wines produced by the immobilized yeast cells. ...|$|E
