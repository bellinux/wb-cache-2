5|$|Chlorine {{is usually}} used (in {{the form of}} hypochlorous acid) to kill {{bacteria}} and other microbes in drinking water supplies and public swimming pools. In most private swimming pools, chlorine itself is not used, but rather sodium hypochlorite, formed from chlorine and sodium hydroxide, or solid tablets of chlorinated isocyanurates. The drawback of using chlorine in swimming pools is that the chlorine reacts with the proteins in human <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> <b>skin</b> (see Hypochlorous acid), and becomes chemically bonded. Even small water supplies are now routinely chlorinated.|$|E
5|$|Shin Megami Tensei: Nine is a {{role-playing}} {{video game}} primarily {{set in a}} cyberspace version of 1990s Tokyo, with players {{taking control of the}} silent main protagonist to explore various environments within Tokyo's districts, along with switching between different districts with a dedicated fast-travel menu. The player can adjust the protagonist's name, gender, <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> <b>skin</b> color. Navigation through environments is presented through a third-person perspective, with the player character being followed by one assigned demon. While navigating safe areas, players can enter shops to buy new equipment and items such as healing potions, and change their character's clothing and hairstyle.|$|E

5|$|The {{characters}} and objects {{are composed of}} simple geometrical shapes and primary colors. Most child characters are {{the same size and}} shape, and are distinguished by their clothing, <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> <b>skin</b> colors, and headwear. Characters are mostly presented two-dimensionally and from only one angle. Their movements are animated in an intentionally jerky fashion, as they are purposely not offered the same free range of motion associated with hand-drawn characters. Occasionally, some non-fictional characters are depicted with photographic cutouts of their actual head and face in lieu of a face reminiscent of the show's traditional style. Canadians on the show are often portrayed in an even more minimalist fashion; they have simple beady eyes, and the top halves of their heads simply flap up and down when the characters speak.|$|E

25|$|Ocular {{albinism}} type 1 (OA1), {{also called}} Nettleship–Falls syndrome, {{is the most}} common type of ocular albinism, with a prevalence rate of 1:50,000. It is an inheritable classical Mendelian type X-linked recessive disorder wherein the retinal pigment epithelium lacks pigment while <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> <b>skin</b> appear normal. Since it is usually an X-linked disorder, it occurs mostly in males, while females are carriers unless they are homozygous. About 60 missense and nonsense mutations, insertions, and deletions have been identified in Oa1. Mutations in OA1 have been linked to defective glycosylation and thus improper intracellular transportation.|$|E
25|$|DHEA {{and other}} adrenal androgens such as androstenedione, {{although}} relatively weak androgens, {{are responsible for}} the androgenic effects of adrenarche, such as early pubic and axillary hair growth, adult-type body odor, increased oiliness of <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> <b>skin,</b> and mild acne. Women with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS), who have a non-functional androgen receptor (AR) and are immune to the androgenic effects of DHEA and other androgens, have absent or only sparse/scanty pubic and axillary hair and body hair in general, demonstrating the role of DHEA, testosterone, and other androgens in body hair development at both adrenarche and pubarche.|$|E

25|$|The Out-of-Africa model {{proposes that}} modern humans {{originated}} in Africa and migrated north to populate Europe and Asia. These migrants most likely had a functional MC1R variant and, accordingly, dark <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> <b>skin</b> as displayed by indigenous Africans today. As humans migrated north, {{the absence of}} high levels of solar radiation in northern Europe and Asia relaxed the selective pressure on active MC1R, allowing the gene to mutate into dysfunctional variants without reproductive penalty, then propagate by genetic drift. Studies show the MC1R Arg163Gln allele has a high frequency in East Asia and {{may be part of}} the evolution of light skin in East Asian populations. No evidence is known for positive selection of MC1R alleles in Europe and {{there is no evidence of}} an association between MC1R and the evolution of light skin in European populations. The lightening of skin color in Europeans and East Asians is an example of convergent evolution.|$|E
500|$|Sebaceous glands secrete the oily, waxy {{substance}} called sebum (...) {{that is made}} of triglycerides, [...] wax esters, squalene, and metabolites of fat-producing cells. Sebum waterproofs and lubricates {{the skin}} and hair of mammals. Sebaceous secretions in conjunction with apocrine glands also play an important thermoregulatory role. In hot conditions, the secretions emulsify the sweat produced by the eccrine glands and this produces a sheet of sweat that is not readily lost in drops of sweat. This is of importance in delaying dehydration. In colder conditions, the nature of sebum becomes more lipid and in coating the <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> <b>skin,</b> rain is effectively repelled.|$|E

However, the 2007 and 2009 studies of dominant white showed that many dominant white alleles produce a range of white phenotypes that include horses with pigmented spots in <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> <b>skin.</b> Each of the larger families [...] of dominant white studied included pure-white horses, horses described as having [...] "sabino-like" [...] white markings, as well as white horses described as [...] "maximal sabino." ...|$|E

This followed winning the competition to be master developer and having their plan approved by the city. The Mills Corporation has letters of intent from CBS 2 Chicago Broadcast Center, Boggi Milano, Sisley, Andrew’s Ties, Banana Republic, Rosa Mexicano, David Barton Gym and new concepts by Steve Lombardo, creator of Gibson's Steakhouse and Hugo’s Frog Bar, and Steven Foster, creator of Lucky Strike Lanes in Hollywood as future tenant commitments. Morningstar, Inc. has signed a lease to occupy about 210,000square feet(20,000m²) across eight floors, making it the largest tenant in the office tower. In April 2005, Mills had announced a lease commitment with WBBM-Channel 2 for about 100,000square feet(10,000m²) of space for offices and a showcase television studio. In February 2008, developer Joseph Freed & Associates announced Club Monaco, a Muvico Entertainment LLC theatre, a David Barton Gym, a Rosa Mexican restaurant, a coffee shop and a yet-to-be-named Lettuce Entertain You Enterprises Inc. restaurant will {{be located in the}} State Street complex. In June 2008, Puma confirmed it is opening a two-level flagship store on Block 37. Also, the Muvico Theatre was reported to have an eight screen multiplex. In October 2008, Spanish clothing store Zara signed a lease for Block 37 along with German athletic-wear company Puma athletic wear and British clothing label Ben Sherman. Other confirmed retailers include clothier Steve Madden, Godiva Chocolatier, sporting apparel seller Lululemon Athletica Inc., <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> <b>skin</b> products retailer Aveda as well as body and bath products retailer Sabon.
