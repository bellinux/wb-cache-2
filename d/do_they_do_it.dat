500|$|On Memorial Day {{weekend in}} 2006, Cher called into C-SPAN's Washington Journal {{endorsing}} Operation Helmet, {{a group that}} provides helmets to help soldiers avoid head injuries while in the war zone. On June 14, 2006, she made a guest appearance on C-SPAN with Dr. Bob Meaders, the founder of Operation Helmet. That year, {{in an interview with}} Stars and Stripes, she explained her [...] "against the war in Iraq but for the troops" [...] position: [...] "I don't have to be for this war to support the troops because these men and women do what they think is right. They do what they're told to <b>do.</b> <b>They</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> with a really good heart. They do the best they can. They don't ask for anything." ...|$|E

6000|$|From {{all these}} facts it must appear to the philosophic reader that {{plagiarism}} {{is not the}} simple [...] "crime" [...] or [...] "theft" [...] that the lexicographers would have us believe. It argues a strange and peculiar courage {{on the part of}} those who commit it or indulge it, since they are sure of having it brought home to them, for they seem to dread the exposure, though it involves no punishment outside of themselves. Why <b>do</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> or, having done it, why do they mind it, since the public does not? Their temerity and their timidity are things almost irreconcilable, and the whole position leaves one quite puzzled as to what one would do if one's own plagiarisms were found out. But this is a mere question of conduct, and of infinitely less interest than that of the nature or essence of the thing itself.|$|E
60|$|As I say, {{it is an}} extravagance {{for a man to}} patronise {{a casual}} ward. And that they know it {{themselves}} is shown by the way these men shun it till driven in by physical exhaustion. Then why <b>do</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>it?</b> Not because they are discouraged workers. The very opposite is true; they are discouraged vagabonds. In the United States the tramp is almost invariably a discouraged worker. He finds tramping a softer mode of life than working. But this is not true in England. Here the powers that be do their utmost to discourage the tramp and vagabond, and he is, in all truth, a mightily discouraged creature. He knows that two shillings a day, which is only fifty cents, will buy him three fair meals, a bed at night, and leave him a couple of pennies for pocket money. He would rather work for those two shillings than for the charity of the casual ward; for he knows that he would not have to work so hard, and {{that he would not be}} so abominably treated. He does not do so, however, because there are more men to do work than there is work for men to do.|$|E
6000|$|We {{know how}} he arrived on board. For my part I know so little of prisons that I haven't the faintest notion how one leaves them. It seems as abominable an {{operation}} as the other, the shutting up with its mental suggestions of bang, snap, crash and the empty silence outside-- where an instant before you were--you were--and now no longer are. Perfectly devilish. And the release! I don't know which is worse. How <b>do</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>it?</b> Pull the string, door flies open, man flies through: Out you go! Adios! And in the space where a second before you were not, in the silent space there is a figure going away, limping. Why limping? I don't know. That's how I see it. One has a notion of a maiming, crippling process; of the individual coming back damaged in some subtle way. I admit it is a fantastic hallucination, but I can't help it. Of course I know that {{the proceedings of the}} best machine-made humanity are employed with judicious care and so on. I am absurd, no doubt, but still... Oh yes it's idiotic. When I pass one of these places ... did you notice that there is something infernal about the aspect of every individual stone or brick of them, something malicious as if matter were enjoying its revenge of the contemptuous spirit of man. Did you notice? You didn't? Eh? Well I am perhaps a little mad on that point. When I pass one of these places I must avert my eyes. I couldn't have gone to meet de Barral. I should have shrunk from the ordeal. You'll notice that it looks as if Anthony (a brave man indubitably) had shirked it too. Little Fyne's flight of fancy picturing three people in the fatal four-wheeler--you remember?--went wide of the truth. There were only two people in the four-wheeler. Flora did not shrink. Women can stand anything. The dear creatures have no imagination when it comes to solid facts of life. In sentimental regions--I won't say. It's another thing altogether. There they shrink from or rush to embrace ghosts of their own creation just the same as any fool-man would.|$|E
