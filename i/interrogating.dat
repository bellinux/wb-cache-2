6000|$|The {{declarant}} admitted {{a criminal}} intrigue {{with an individual}} whose name she desired to conceal. [...] "Being <b>interrogated,</b> what her reason was for secrecy on this point? She declared, {{that she had no}} right to blame that person's conduct more than she did her own, and that she was willing to confess her own faults, but not to say anything which might criminate the absent. <b>Interrogated,</b> if she confessed her situation to any one, or made any preparation for her confinement? Declares, she did not. And being <b>interrogated,</b> why she forbore to take steps which her situation so peremptorily required? Declares, she was ashamed to tell her friends, and she trusted the person she has mentioned would provide for her and the infant. <b>Interrogated</b> if he did so? Declares, that he did not do so personally; but that it was not his fault, for that the declarant is convinced he would have laid down his life sooner than the bairn or she had come to harm. <b>Interrogated,</b> what prevented him from keeping his promise? Declares, that it was impossible for him to do so, he being under trouble at the time, and declines farther answer to this question. <b>Interrogated,</b> where she was from the period she left her master, Mr. Saddletree's family, until her appearance at her father's, at St. Leonard's, the day before she was apprehended? Declares, she does not remember. And, on the interrogatory being repeated, declares, she does not mind muckle about it, for she was very ill. On the question being again repeated, she declares, she will tell the truth, if it should be the undoing of her, so long as she is not asked to tell on other folk; and admits, that she passed that interval of time in the lodging of a woman, an acquaintance of that person who had wished her to that place to be delivered, and that she was there delivered accordingly of a male child. <b>Interrogated,</b> what was the name of that person? Declares and refuses to answer this question. <b>Interrogated,</b> where she lives? Declares, she has no certainty, for that she was taken to the lodging aforesaid under cloud of night. <b>Interrogated,</b> if the lodging was in the city or suburbs? Declares and refuses to answer that question. <b>Interrogated,</b> whether, when she left the house of Mr. Saddletree, she went up or down the street? Declares and refuses to answer the question. <b>Interrogated,</b> whether she had ever seen the woman before she was wished to her, as she termed it, by the person whose name she refuses to answer? Declares and replies, not to her knowledge. <b>Interrogated,</b> whether this woman was introduced to her by the said person verbally, or by word of mouth? Declares, she has no freedom to answer this question. <b>Interrogated,</b> if the child was alive when it was born? Declares, that--God help her and it!--it certainly was alive. <b>Interrogated,</b> if it died a natural death after birth? Declares, not to her knowledge. <b>Interrogated,</b> where it now is? Declares, she would give her right hand to ken, but that she never hopes to see mair than the banes of it. And being <b>interrogated,</b> why she supposes it is now dead? the declarant wept bitterly and made no answer. <b>Interrogated,</b> if the woman, in whose lodging she was, seemed to be a fit person to be with her in that situation? Declares, she might be fit enough for skill, but that she was an hard-hearted bad woman. <b>Interrogated,</b> if there was any other person in the lodging excepting themselves two? Declares, that she thinks there was another woman; but her head was so carried with pain of body and trouble of mind, that she minded her very little. <b>Interrogated,</b> when the child was taken away from her? Declared that she fell in a fever, and was light-headed, and when she came to her own mind, the woman told her the bairn was dead; and that the declarant answered, if it was dead it had had foul play. That, thereupon, the woman was very sair on her, and gave her much ill language; and that the deponent was frightened, and crawled out of the house when her back was turned, and went home to Saint Leonard's Crags, as well as a woman in her condition dought.* ...|$|R

5|$|Conflicts between Armenia and Azerbaijan first {{appeared}} in 2006, when Azeri media criticized the event's website for listing Nagorno-Karabakh as the birthplace of Armenia's first representative, André, as {{it was part of}} the Azerbaijan SSR at the time.

5|$|Joel Stoffer and Neil Flynn have minor {{roles as}} FBI agents <b>interrogating</b> Indiana {{in a scene}} {{following}} the opening sequence. Alan Dale plays General Ross, who protests his innocence. Andrew Divoff and Pasha D. Lychnikoff play Soviet soldiers.

5|$|By December 1966 some Australian officers, {{including}} Lieutenant Colonel John Warr, the 5 RAR commanding officer, {{had begun}} to reassess their operational aims.

Assessing that with just two infantry battalions 1 ATF {{did not have the}} strength to destroy the Viet Cong forces then in Phuoc Tuy, Warr favoured cordon and search operations to eliminate cadres and block the supply of rice from the villages. On 7 January 1967, Brigadier David Jackson was replaced as Commander 1 ATF by Brigadier Stuart Graham, and he subsequently approved Warr's proposed concept of operations.
