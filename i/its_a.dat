According to Shinkai, the greatest challenge in the project was to keep the animation both short and entertaining while also covering the two main themes: family bonds and the future. Hirano's narration, which provided character background and insight into their personalities, helped Shinkai structure the film.|$|E
5|$|Much {{more than}} the other Big Five studios, RKO relied on B {{pictures}} to fill up its schedule. Of the thirty-one features released by RKO in 1944, for instance, ten were budgeted below $200,000, twelve were in the $200,000 to $500,000 range, and only nine cost more. In contrast, a clear majority of the features put out by the other top four studios were budgeted at over a half a million dollars. A focus on B pictures limited the studio's financial risk; while it also limited the potential for reward (Dmytryk's extraordinary coups aside), RKO had a history of making better profits with its run-of-the-mill and low-cost product than with <b>its</b> <b>A</b> movies. The studio's low-budget films offered training opportunities for new directors, as well, among them Jacques Tourneur, Mark Robson, Robert Wise, and Anthony Mann. Robson and Wise received their first directing assignments with producer Val Lewton, whose specialized B horror unit also included the more experienced director Jacques Tourneur. The Lewton unit's moody, atmospheric work—represented by films such as Cat People (1942), I Walked with a Zombie (1943), and The Body Snatcher (1945)—is now highly regarded. Richard Dix concluded his lengthy RKO career with the 1943 Lewton production The Ghost Ship. Tim Holt was RKO's cowboy star of the era, appearing in forty-six B Westerns and more than fifty movies altogether for the studio. In 1940, Chester Lauck and Norris Goff brought their famous comic characters Lum and Abner from radio to RKO for a six-film run. The Falcon detective series began in 1941; the Saint and the Falcon were so similar that Saint creator Leslie Charteris sued RKO. The Falcon was first played by George Sanders, who had appeared five times as the Saint. He bowed out after four Falcon films and was replaced by his brother, Tom Conway. Conway had a nine-film run in the part before the series ended in 1946. Johnny Weissmuller starred in six Tarzan pictures for RKO between 1943 and 1948 before being replaced by Lex Barker.|$|E

The variations in Amazonian dark earths prevent clearly determining whether all of them were intentionally created for soil improvement or whether the lightest variants are a by-product of habitation. The varied features of the dark earths throughout the Amazon Basin suggest the existence of an extensive ancient native civilization dating back 500 to 2500years.|$|E

25|$|By 2011, the Acela fleet {{had reached}} {{half of its}} {{designed}} service life. Amtrak proposed several replacement options, including one as part of <b>its</b> <b>A</b> Vision for High-Speed Rail in the Northeast Corridor. In 2011, Amtrak announced that forty new Acela coaches would be ordered in 2012 to increase capacity on existing trainsets. The existing trains would have received two more coaches, lengthening the trainsets from a 1-6-1 configuration to 1-8-1 (power car - passenger cars - power car). The longer trainsets would have required the modifications of the Acela maintenance facilities in Boston, New York and Washington. The first of the stretched trainsets was to have entered service in fiscal year 2014. This plan was cancelled in 2012 in favor of replacing, rather than refurbishing, the Acela fleet.|$|E

A huge army of combined forces of Algiers, Kabyle principalities (Kuku and Beni Abbes) and other vassal tribes under the command of Hasan Pasha, son of Hayreddin Barbarossa, and Jafar Catania, tried to conquer the Spanish-controlled strongholds of Oran and Mers El Kébir on the North African coast, defended respectively by Alonso de Córdoba, Count of Alcaudete, and his brother Martín de Córdoba. The stubborn defense of the Spanish and the arrival of a relief fleet under Francisco de Mendoza frustrated the Ottoman intentions.|$|E
25|$|Stefan Kraowski {{indirectly}} {{places the}} Mongol invasion force a fair bit above 30,000 men by estimating the smaller Mongol invasion of Poland {{two years later}} as having about that many soldiers, stating that Nogai and Talabuga personally leading an invasion suggests <b>its</b> <b>a</b> massive force by definition. Peter Jackson, using contemporary Hungarian charters, concludes that the Mongol army was very large, but is unsure if it was larger, smaller, or comparable in size to the 1241–42 invasion force. A contemporary letter from Benedict, the provost of Esztergom, estimates {{the size of the}} Mongol army at 200,000. This is almost certainly an enormous exaggeration, as the Mongols almost never fielded armies larger than 100,000 men. The Austrian chronicler of Salzburg recorded that the Mongol military camp covered an area of ten miles in width and six miles in depth (whether this was Nogai's or Talabuga's army, or how this chronicler got his information, is unknown). The Galician-Volhynian Chronicle puts the size of the Mongol army in the hundreds of thousands, saying that Talabuga's column alone lost 100,000 men during the march through the Carpathians.|$|E
25|$|To {{provide these}} workers {{with access to}} the {{downtown}} retail area, the Broadway Street Railway opened in 1863. This was a horse-drawn omnibus guided by metal rails ran down Broadway Avenue from Public Square to the Village of Newburgh twice a day. The Broadway & Newburgh Street Railway's omnibus line opened in 1873, running from the Kinsman Street Railway at the intersection of Woodland Avenue and E. 55th Street south to Broadway Avenue, and then down Broadway to E. 110th Street. A third omnibus line, the Brooklyn Street Railway, began operating in 1883 from Public Square. It traveled south on Ontario Street and Orange Avenue to Woodland Avenue, and then east on Woodland Avenue to Woodland Cemetery. One year later, it extended its line south from Woodland Avenue along E. 55th Street to Broadway (paralleling the Broadway & Newburgh Street Railway). Between 1884 and 1894, all non-cable street railways in Cleveland had converted to electricity. The Brooklyn Street Railway built <b>its</b> <b>a</b> powerhouse at the intersection of Broadway Avenue and Aetna Road. In 1893, the company, now part of the Cleveland Electric Railway Company, began construction of a spur on Miles Avenue from Broadway to E. 131st Street. A loop, beginning at Broadway and Union Avenue, traveled east on Union to E. 93rd Street, south to Harvard Street, and back to Broadway. Despite the extensive public transit system, the proximity of working housing to the steel mills meant that 60 percent of workers in 1920 in the Union-Miles Park neighborhood still walked to work daily, a much higher percentage than in any other industrial city in the nation.|$|E
