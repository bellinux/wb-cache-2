In fact Dillon LJ never said such a thing, although [...] "it <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>obvious</b> conclusion to draw [...] ". He merely distinguished Re London Wine Co, allowing him to decide the case on the facts alone. Hunter was reluctantly applied in Re Harvard Securities, where Neuberger J reluctantly decided that it had said there was no need to segregate intangible property.|$|E
500|$|At the Scorpio Ball Taylor {{wore the}} diamond with the Krupp Diamond, which Burton {{had bought for}} her in 1968, and the [...] "Ping Pong" [...] diamond, which was only [...] of a carat. The [...] "Ping Pong" [...] diamond had cost only $14 and had been bought for her by Burton after he promised her a diamond if she beat him by ten points at a game of ping pong. When people praised her {{diamonds}} at the ball, Taylor would make a show of pretending that they were praising the Ping Pong diamond and not its much larger counterparts. Burton wrote in his diary that [...] "Elizabeth's delight in it is a joy to behold and a very quaint thing to witness <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>obvious</b> pleasure that other people take in her wearing it. Even Hjordis Niven and Princess Grace, who are coldish fish, seemed to enjoy her moment. And of course nobody can wear it better.

[...] Louis Virtel from The Backlot listed [...] "Breathe" [...] at number14 on their [...] "Kylie Minogue’s 50 Best Songs, in Honor of Her Birthday" [...] and said [...] "'Breathe' would be a meditative masterpiece if it weren't so confrontational, deadpan, and sexually domineering. Impossible Princess unassuming heart stopper trips into unexpected carnality in its choruses, assuring you 'It won’t be long now' {{as you try to}} time your hyperventilation." [...] According to Tom Parker, who provided the special edition album notes for Impossible Princess, [...] " [...] is a seductive electronic groove, with a hypnotic subtlety and timelessness befitting the theme inward contemplating and resolve." [...] Larry Flick from Billboard said that [...] "Breathe" [...] is a [...] "user-friendly jam" [...] which is [...] "largely due to its big-beat electronic groove and ear-tickling pop chorus." ...|$|E

500|$|In November 2008, Roberts {{started for}} Northwich in a 1–1 draw at Broadhall Way in a match between Northwich and Stevenage, he {{subsequently}} joined the Hertfordshire side on loan {{a week after}} the match. The deal was made permanent on 1 January 2009, after impressing Graham Westley during his one-month loan spell. He scored his first Stevenage goal in a 2–0 FA Trophy win away to Farnborough, as well as scoring his second goal for the club in Stevenage's 4–0 win against Forest Green Rovers. He scored his first league goal for the club in a 2–1 victory away to Altrincham, scoring a stoppage time goal to ensure Stevenage left Moss Lane with three points. Roberts followed this up with another goal in Stevenage's next away fixture, heading in the only goal of the game to give Stevenage a 1–0 win at Northwich Victoria, his former employers. He was sent off in the club's 2–1 home win against Cambridge United in April 2009, and continued to play regularly as Stevenage made the play-offs as a result of finishing in the final play-off place. He scored in the semi-final first leg against Cambridge United, heading in Steve Morison's ball across goal, but could not prevent Stevenage from losing 4–3 on aggregate over two legs. Roberts was awarded 'Supporters Player of the Year' {{at the end of the}} season despite only joining the club in late November 2008. He also started in all seven of the club's successful FA Trophy campaign during that season, scoring twice in the process and playing in the side's 2–0 win against York City in the Final. In May 2009, it was announced that Roberts would be team captain for the 2009–10 season. On Roberts' appointment as captain, Stevenage manager Graham Westley said [...] "Roberts is a natural leader who leads in the best way — by example. He <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>obvious</b> choice." ...|$|E

Blake placed surfboards, paddleboards, and life saving equipment within reach of the interested athlete, lifeguard, and seaside visitor. In Blake's life, there was no separation between religion, surfing, swimming, building surfboards, eating, and exercise. At the time, no one guessed that his unorthodox life style would one day become the accepted standard for the beach culture.” ...|$|E

It appears on the 1929 map of the “Street Railways of Little Rock” at the intersection of Markham and Prospect Avenue (now Kavanaugh), where a trolley stop was located on the Pulaski Heights Line. Additionally, the city directory from [...] that same year records the operation of two neighborhood businesses which included “Stifft Station” in their names — one a grocery store and the other a barber shop—-which underscores the adoption of the name generally.

And if we ourselves wanted a piece of fresh meat we could cut off a delicate little fillet; it tasted to us {{as good as the}} best beef.

[...] For any U and s ∈ F(U), the union of these points (for all x ∈ U) is declared to be open in E. [...] Notice that each stalk has the discrete topology as subspace topology. [...] Two morphisms between sheaves determine a continuous map of the corresponding étalé spaces that {{is compatible with the}} projection maps (in the sense that every germ is mapped to a germ over the same point). [...] This makes the construction into a functor.|$|E

2500|$|Russell's {{solution}} was, {{first of}} all, to analyse not the term alone {{but the entire}} proposition that contained a definite description. [...] "The present king of France is bald," [...] he then suggested, can be reworded to [...] "There is an x such that x is a present king of France, nothing other than x is a present king of France, and x is bald." [...] Russell claimed that each definite description in fact contains a claim of existence and a claim of uniqueness which give this appearance, but these can be broken apart and treated separately from the predication that <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>obvious</b> content of the proposition. The proposition as a whole then says three things about some object: the definite description contains two of them, {{and the rest of}} the sentence contains the other.
