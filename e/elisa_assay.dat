50|$|In 1990, Hazelton Research Products' Reston Quarantine Unit in Reston, Virginia {{suffered}} a mysterious outbreak of fatal illness among {{a shipment of}} crab-eating macaque monkeys imported from the Philippines. The company's veterinary pathologist sent tissue samples from dead animals to the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) at Fort Detrick, where a laboratory test known as an <b>ELISA</b> <b>assay</b> showed antibodies to Ebola virus. Thereafter, a team from USAMRIID euthanized the surviving monkeys, bringing the carcasses to Ft.

50|$|Virus {{isolation}} {{provides the}} most definitive diagnosis, but takes one to two weeks for completion and {{must be carried out}} in biosafety level III laboratories. The technique involves exposing specific cell lines to samples from whole blood and identifying chikungunya virus-specific responses. RT-PCR using nested primer pairs is used to amplify several chikungunya-specific genes from whole blood, generating thousands to millions of copies of the genes in order to identify them. RT-PCR {{can also be used to}} quantify the viral load in the blood. Using RT-PCR, diagnostic results can be available in one to two days. Serological diagnosis requires a larger amount of blood than the other methods, and uses an <b>ELISA</b> <b>assay</b> to measure chikungunya-specific IgM levels in the blood serum. One advantage offered by serological diagnosis is that serum IgM is detectable from 5 days to months after the onset of symptoms, but drawbacks are that results may require two to three days, and false positives can occur with infection due to other related viruses, such as o'nyong'nyong virus and Semliki Forest virus.|$|E

40|$|Background: Aerosolization of fish {{proteins}} during seafood processing {{has been}} identified as a potential route for allergic sensitization and occupational asthma among workers involved in high-risk activities. The aim {{of this study was to}} develop immunological assays for the quantification of aerosolized fish antigens in a fish-processing factory. Methods: Polyclonal antibodies to the main fish species processed in the factory (anchovy and pilchard) were generated in rabbits and compared by <b>ELISA</b> inhibition <b>assay</b> and immunoblotting. These antisera were utilized to develop <b>ELISA</b> <b>assays</b> for the detection of fish antigens. The <b>ELISA</b> inhibition <b>assays</b> were evaluated by analyzing environmental air samples collected from three areas in a fish-processing factory: pilchard canning, fish meal production and lobster processing. Results: By immunoblotting, the rabbit polyclonal antibodies demonstrated IgG antibody binding patterns comparable with IgE antibodies of fish-sensitized patients, particularly in regard to the major fish allergens parvalbumins. The sensitivity of the fish-specific <b>ELISA</b> <b>assays</b> developed was 0. 5 μg/ml. The <b>ELISA</b> inhibition <b>assays</b> were able to differentiate between the two different fish species of interest but did not recognize a crustacean species. Notable differences in exposure levels to canned pilchard and anchovy antigens were demonstrated in the three different working areas of the factory, with assays having a detection limit as low as 105 ng/m 3. Conclusion: These ELISA-based assays are sensitive and specific to quantify differential exposure levels to fish antigens produced during fish processing, making it possible to investigate exposure-disease response relationships among workers in this industry...|$|R

After enrichment culture, DNA was extracted from the samples by using a rapid-boiling method, and the DNA extracts were used as a template in a PCR <b>ELISA</b> <b>assay.</b> A total of 51 samples were positive by either PCR ELISA or culture; of these, 43 were found to be positive by PCR ELISA and 43 were found to be positive by culture. Overall, including positive and negative results, 59 samples were concordant in both methods. Several samples were positive in the PCR <b>ELISA</b> <b>assay</b> but were culture negative; therefore, this assay may be able to detect sublethally damaged or viable nonculturable forms of campylobacters.

40|$|In {{this study}} we {{demonstrated}} that the vaccine candidate against avian influenza virus H 5 N 1 based on the hemagglutinin H 5 (HA) fused to the chicken CD 154 (HACD) {{can also be used}} for differentiating infected from vaccinated animals (DIVA). As the strategy of DIVA requires at least two proteins, we obtained a variant of the nucleoprotein (NP 49 - 375) in E. coli. After its purification by IMAC, the competence of the proteins NP 49 - 375 and HACD as coating antigens in indirect <b>ELISA</b> <b>assays</b> were tested by using the sera of chickens immunized with the proteins HA and HACD and the reference sera from several avian influenza subtypes. Together with these sera, the sera from different species of birds and the sera of chickens infected with other avian viral diseases were analyzed by competition <b>ELISA</b> <b>assays</b> coated with the proteins NP 49 - 375 and HACD. The results showed that the segment CD 154 in the chimeric protein HACD did not interfere with the recognition of the molecule HA by its specific antibodies. Also, we observed variable detection levels when the reference sera were analyzed in the ELISA plates coated with the protein NP 49 - 375. Moreover, only the antibodies of the reference serum subtype H 5 were detected in the ELISA plates coated with the protein HACD. The competition <b>ELISA</b> <b>assays</b> showed percentages of inhibition of 88 - 91 % for the positives sera and less than 20 % for the negative sera. We fixed the cut-off value of these assays at 25 %. No antibody detection was observed in the sera from different species of birds or the sera of chickens infected with other avian viral diseases. This study supported the fact that the <b>ELISA</b> <b>assays</b> using the proteins NP 49 - 375 and HACD could be valuable tools for avian influenza surveillance and as a strategy of DIVA for counteracting the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H 5 N 1 outbreaks...|$|R

40|$|Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a {{frequent}} cause of acute respiratory infections in both children and adults. Currently, diagnosis of M. pneumoniae infection will based principally on serology and the detection of IgM can provide an early and sensitive diagnosis in children. A variety of commercial immunodiagnostic assays, such as Indirect Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent (<b>ELISA)</b> <b>assay</b> and Indirect Immunofluorescence (IFA), are now available as serological methods. The Aim of this comparative prospective study, was to compare two different approaches to the rapid detection of Mycoplasma pneumoniae respiratory tract infections among children. For this purpose, a commercial IFA assay for detection of M. pneumoniae -specific IgM antibody in acute-phase sera {{was used to compare}} with <b>ELISA</b> <b>assay</b> for specific-IgM antibody and to sought wither the use of either serological assays as a more reliable laboratory diagnosis for Mycoplasma pneumoniae respiratory tract infections in children. This study was designed as a comparative prospective study in which 90 patients (Mean age of the patients in case group was 5. 94 Â± 2. 73 and in control group was 6. 51 Â± 2. 26) of either sexes were included. These patients were classified into two groups: first group (case group), included 45 patients who had been admitted in hospital with diagnosis of respiratory tract infections and the second group (control group), included 45 healthy patients who had no history of respiratory tract infections. Both the groups were age and sex matched. Presence of IgM antibodies to Mycoplasma pneumoniae was assessed by IFA kit assay in both groups and the detection result was compared with result of previous study using <b>ELISA</b> <b>assay.</b> In the case group, 2 (4 %) cases out of 45 children were positive for anti-mycoplasma antibody whereas in the control group, all children were negative. All positive case group patients had symptoms of acute pneumonia. 18 (40 %) of the patients were diagnosed with bronchial asthma (40 %) inclusive of all the two cases diagnosed with Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection. The IgM-positive rate for IFA assay (4 %) was lower than in <b>ELISA</b> <b>assay</b> (9 %), as compared from both kits. Taking the <b>ELISA</b> <b>assay</b> as a gold standard for the presence of Mycoplasma pneumoniae respiratory tract infections, the sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative predictive values of the IFA assay in comparison to ELISA, were 50 (CI: 8. 30 to 91. 70 %), 100 (CI: 91. 31 to 100 %), 100 and 95. 34 % respectively. The results of IgM IFA assay showed relatively lower positivity than <b>ELISA</b> <b>assay</b> in the early acute phase, the results of IFA undertaken for the detection of M. pneumoniae respiratory tract infections and it is a first study in the Saudia Arabia of its kind from the region reporting such a disease in children using a serological assays as IFA and ELISA assays for comparasion. We therefore conclude that the use of <b>ELISA</b> <b>assay</b> conducted in the country as a more reliable laboratory diagnosis for Mycoplasma pneumoniae respiratory tract infections in children. Further future studies need to be carried out to investigate the use of PCR to allow fast and reliable diagnosis of M. pneumoniae infection during the early phases of infection in children...|$|E
