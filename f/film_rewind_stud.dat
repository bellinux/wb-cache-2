50|$|At {{this point}} the <b>film</b> <b>rewinds</b> to the opening scene when Angélique bought the pink rose. This time the film follows the {{delivery}} boy and the subsequent events play out from Loïc's viewpoint.|$|R
50|$|Moreover, the Pentax placed {{controls}} in locations {{that would become}} standard on 35 mm SLRs from all manufacturers, such as the right-handed rapid wind lever, the bottom right mounted <b>rewind</b> release, and <b>film</b> speed reminder around the <b>film</b> <b>rewind</b> crank.|$|R
5000|$|All their SLR cameras, {{except the}} dx-3, had {{interchangeable}} pentaprisms (released by moving a button or twisting {{the base of}} the <b>film</b> <b>rewind</b> knob), and a unique dual lens mount; an external bayonet mount or a 44mm thread mount within the mirror box.|$|R
5000|$|... 1957: Asahi Pentax (Japan; called Sears Tower 26 in USA): first SLR with {{right-handed}} rapid-wind thumb lever, first fold-out <b>film</b> <b>rewind</b> crank, first microprism focusing aid. First Asahi SLR with M42 screw mount. Established the [...] "modern" [...] control {{layout of}} the 35 mm SLR. Well-integrated focal-plane shutter, instant return mirror and pentaprism design.|$|R

50|$|Henenlotter {{appeared}} in the 2013 documentary <b>film</b> <b>Rewind</b> This!, {{about the impact of}} VHS on the film industry and home video. He also appeared with the film's director, Josh Johnson, when it screened at film festivals such as the Telluride Horror Show. In 2014, he directed Chasing Banksy, which was screened with a visit of Henenlotter at New York City Forbidden Planet.|$|R
50|$|Exposure {{control was}} {{aperture}} priority AE using center-weighted light metering. Film speeds {{of the camera}} range from ASA 25 to ASA 1600. Film winding was done by using the film-wind lever located on the top right of the camera. <b>Film</b> <b>rewinding</b> was done manually using the film-rewind crank located at the top left. The camera body measured 136 × 83 × 50 mm and weighed approximately 430 g.|$|R
50|$|Moreover, the Pentax placed {{controls}} in locations {{that would become}} standard on 35 mm SLRs from all manufacturers, such as the right-handed rapid wind lever, the bottom right mounted rewind release. It also had a film speed reminder around the <b>film</b> <b>rewind</b> crank, a location that remained standard until the dial went from being merely a reminder to the photographer to actually controlling the light meter built into later SLRs.|$|R
50|$|As {{an example}} of a static application, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT-PSS) product Clevios P (Figure 7) from Heraeus has been {{extensively}} used as an antistatic coating (as packaging materials for electronic components, for example). AGFA coats 200 m × 10 m of photographic film per year with PEDOT:PSS because of its antistatic properties. The thin layer of PEDOT:PSS is virtually transparent and colorless, prevents electrostatic discharges during <b>film</b> <b>rewinding,</b> and reduces dust buildup on the negatives after processing.|$|R
50|$|Accessories for the OM-4 {{included}} all the Olympus motor drives {{made for the}} OM-System cameras. Motor Drive 2 was introduced with the OM-4 and, in addition to automatic film advance (up to 5 frames per second), featured motorized <b>film</b> <b>rewind.</b> The camera accepted the Olympus 250-exposure bulk film back (10 meters of film = 250 frames) and the Olympus T-system flashes. The T45 handle-mount electronic flash (guide number 148/45 (feet/meters) at ASA/ISO 100) was also introduced with the OM-4.|$|R
50|$|The F4 was {{the first}} Nikon F-series lacking a manual film-advance lever, though it offered both {{motor-driven}} and manual <b>film</b> <b>rewinding.</b> Like previous F-series cameras, the F4 featured {{a high degree of}} customization to specific tasks, with various remote controls, film backs, and viewfinders available. While it was a complex camera with over 1700 parts, the F4's high-quality mechanical and electronic components, as well as weather sealing and tough construction, made for a reliable and long-lived professional SLR.|$|R
50|$|There are {{a number}} of {{variations}} of the Leica M2. Although most models have the self-timer lever, it is absent from some earlier models. Also, some early models have a <b>film</b> <b>rewind</b> push-button instead of the typical lever. About 2400 M2s were factory-painted black, but these are relatively rare and more valued by collectors. Near the end of production, Leica also produced a number of M2-R models, which had the faster loading system of the later Leica M4.|$|R
50|$|Starting in 1976, Nippon Kogaku {{introduced}} the Nikon Speedlight SB-2 (guide number 82/25 (feet/meters) at ASA 100), SB-5 (guide number 105/32 (feet/meters) at ASA 100), SB-6 (guide number 148/45 (feet/meters) at ASA 100) and SB-7E (guide number 82/25 (feet/meters) at ASA 100) electronic flashes. Note that the F2 {{did not use}} a standard ISO hot shoe to mount flash units. Instead, the SB-2, -6 and -7E mounted in a unique-to-Nikon-F-and-F2 hot shoe surrounding the <b>film</b> <b>rewind</b> crank. Manually <b>rewinding</b> <b>film</b> could not be done with a flash mounted in this shoe because the flash blocked the crank. Standard ISO foot flashes can {{be connected to the}} Nikon shoe via the Nikon AS-1 Flash Unit Coupler.|$|R
50|$|The Leica MP is Leica's {{latest film}} {{rangefinder}} camera. Unlike the preceding Leica M7, the camera has adopted many retro design features {{from the earlier}} M3. These include a M3 type metal film advance lever, knob <b>film</b> <b>rewind</b> design and M3 type frameline adjust lever. The basic classic design remains unchanged and the design for loading film from the bottom has been retained. The camera comes in various camera finishes including black chrome, black paint and silver chrome and can be further customised with Leica AG's à la carte program.|$|R
50|$|Like all {{previous}} Nikon F series cameras, the F5 maintained a manual <b>film</b> <b>rewind</b> (with a rapid power rewind built in), high durability, exceptionally short shutter lag, interchangeable 100% coverage viewfinders (including a large-view Action Finder, Waist-Level Finder, and 6x High-Magnification Finder, {{in addition to}} the stock DP-30 multi-metering pentaprism), and support {{for a wide range of}} Nikon F-mount lenses. In common with the F3 and F4 it relied upon battery power in order to function, either from eight AA batteries or an optional rechargeable NiMH battery pack.|$|R
50|$|The knobs and {{controls}} on the top-plate are turned and milled from solid aluminium. Engraved numerals and arrows in the top plate indicate their respective function and mode of operation. A semiautomatic decrementing frame-counter {{is built into the}} wind-on knob visible through a small cutaway window in the knob. A small button next to it, which also doubles as a <b>film</b> <b>rewind</b> release, allows the wind-on knob to be turned back and forth to set the frame counter to the number of frames remaining on the loaded film.|$|R
25|$|In 1974 Minox {{introduced}} a very compact (100mm × 61mm × 31mm), glass fibre reinforced Makrolon bodied 35 mm film camera designed by Professor Fischer of Vienna University: the Minox EL, {{the first one}} in Minox 35mm series. These compact cameras featured a drawbridge style lens cover which when lowered brought forward a 35mm focal length f/2.8 four-element, three-group Tessar-type Minotar/Minoxar lens with between the lens leaf shutter and diaphragm, a center positioned viewfinder, two stroke film winder lever and a <b>film</b> <b>rewind</b> knob. The Minox 35 camera back must be removed for loading or unloading film.|$|R

5000|$|Another {{difference}} to the conventional design was the cocking lever. On the Rollei 35, the lever {{is located at the}} top left and the <b>film</b> <b>rewinding</b> crank at the bottom right of the camera body (instead of the cocking lever being at the top right and the rewind crank at the top left). The cartridge sits in {{the right side of the}} camera and correspondingly the exposures lay [...] "upside down" [...] on the film, reflected by the inverted position of the film inscriptions (type, frame numbers) of under/over landscape pictures. To change the film, the back must be slid downwards and removed fully, like on the Leica, for example.|$|R

50|$|The Bessa R2 {{replaced}} the Bessa-R in 2002. It was an updated version, with a Leica M-mount replacing the Leica screw mount, {{and the ability}} to take the same trigger advance accessory as the Bessa-T. Its quality of fabrication and overall finish was much better than the R, with magnesium alloy replacing the former model's plastic plates and a more substantial cast (as opposed to pressed) metal <b>film</b> <b>rewind</b> lever. The changes resulted in a more solid and marginally larger camera, available in either olive (with chrome detailing) or splatter-textured black paint finishes. The Bessa-R's self-timer was deleted from the R2, possibly due to the packaging constraints imposed on the design by the adoption of thicker metal panels.|$|R
5000|$|Production of {{the largely}} hand {{assembled}} camera was moved from Japan, first to Hong Kong in 1978 {{and then to}} China in 1990, to keep labor costs down. The [...] "Asahi" [...] name and [...] "AOCo" [...] logo {{was removed from the}} pentaprism cover to de-emphasize the company name in keeping {{with the rest of the}} [...] "Pentax" [...] line. The meter components changed as Asahi Optical searched for suitable supplies. The metal in the wind shaft was downgraded from steel. Cheaper plastic was substituted for the originally satin-chomed brass top and bottom plates and aluminum and steel <b>film</b> <b>rewind</b> assembly. Note that the use of lighter plastic lowered the weight of the Chinese-assembled K1000s to 525 g.|$|R
5000|$|In the 2008 <b>film</b> Be Kind <b>Rewind,</b> Waller was a {{major theme}} and {{influence}} for the storyline.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>film</b> <b>rewinds</b> into a flashback. It is 2010. Kakababu is {{contracted}} by Egyptian businessman Al Mamun (Rajit Kapur) {{to decipher}} the meanings of hieroglyphic symbols that his teacher, Mufti Muhammad (Barun Chanda), had drawn {{on a piece of}} paper supposedly during his sleep. Muhammad is terminally ill and is about to grant his last wish while he is being treated in Delhi. Mamun thinks that the symbols are the key for locating Mufti Muhammad's will which will describe where to find treasures Mufti Muhammad had acquired during his tenure as a political leader and revolutionary. However, Kakababu is convinced that the symbols have a different meaning and they are very unusual. Mufti Muhammad symbolically requests Kakababu to verify something, a very unusual last wish.|$|R
50|$|The {{song was}} used as the music for a film-making montage in Michel Gondry's 2008 <b>film</b> Be Kind <b>Rewind.</b>|$|R
50|$|There are two {{different}} motorized film advance units in the New F-1 system: the AE Power Winder FN, and the AE Motor Drive FN. The AE Power Winder FN allows up to 2 frames per second (frame/s) in continuous mode, and the AE Motor Drive allows up to 5 frame/s in high-speed mode and 3.5 frame/s in low-speed mode. Both units also have single-exposure mode, where only a single frame is exposed when the shutter release is held down. Both units also have a second shutter release for vertical format shooting, and a subtractive frame counter. Only the AE Motor Drive FN has a motorized <b>film</b> <b>rewind</b> (therefore when using the AE Power Winder FN {{it is not necessary}} to remove the Rewind Coupler cover from the bottom of the camera).|$|R
5000|$|The FT's {{exposure}} control system was a [...] "center-the-needle" [...] system using a galvanometer needle pointer moving vertically {{at the lower}} {{right side of the}} viewfinder to indicate the readings of the built-in, open aperture, TTL, full-scene averaging, cadmium sulfide (CdS) light meter versus the actual camera settings. The photographer would adjust the shutter speed to freeze or blur motion and/or the lens aperture f-stop to control depth of field (focus) until the needle was centered between two pincer-like brackets. The needle array was duplicated in a window next the top-mounted <b>film</b> <b>rewind</b> crank to allow {{exposure control}} without looking through the viewfinder. The meter was turned on by pulling the film wind lever out to the standby ready position and turned off by pushing it back flush against the camera.|$|R
50|$|The EOS 100 {{came with}} a {{motorised}} belt drive for <b>film</b> winding and <b>rewinding.</b> Canon claimed this made it the quietest camera in the EOS range.|$|R
50|$|The {{camera back}} is {{removable}} for changing film. A milled button {{next to the}} tripod socket rotates either way to lock the back, while in a position in between it is unlocked. The back comes off downwards as a single unit including the base-plate. A quite small film-pressure plate of thick glass is mounted {{on a piece of}} rubber foam on the back. Inside the camera, on the left-hand side, is the 35mm film cassette chamber, and to the right is the counter clockwise rotating film take-up drum. It has a narrow slit for the film leader, and it rotates freely whenever the small <b>film</b> <b>rewind</b> button on the top plate is depressed. No sprocket wheel is employed; instead, the film is pulled by, and wound onto the drum that always rotates the same angular amount for next picture frame. Acceptable frame spacing is accomplished by the large diameter take-up spool that reduces the effect of increasing spool diameter as more film is wound onto it.|$|R
