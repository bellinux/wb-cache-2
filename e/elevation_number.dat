40|$|A two-part {{pricing policy}} is {{investigated}} {{as the most}} feasible method of pricing the transportation services to be provided by NASA's SSTS. Engineering cost estimates and a deterministic operating cost model generate a data base and develop a procedure for pricing the services of the SSTS. It is expected that the SSTS will {{have a monopoly on}} space material processing in areas of crystal growth, glass processing, metallurgical space applications, and biomedical processes using electrophoresis which will require efficient pricing. Pricing problems, the SSTS operating costs based on orbit <b>elevation,</b> <b>number</b> of launch sites, and number of flights, capital costs of the SSTS, research and development costs, allocation of joint transportation costs of the SSTS to a particular space processing activity, and rates for the SSTS are discussed. It is concluded that joint costs for commercial cargoes carried in the SSTS can be most usefully handled by making cost allocations based on proportionate capacity utilization...|$|E
40|$|In many biomes, {{global warming}} has {{resulted}} in advanced and longer growing seasons, which has often led to earlier flowering in plant taxa. Elevational gradients are ideal to {{study the effects of}} global warming as they allow transplantation of plants from their original cooler higher elevations down to elevations with a prospective climate. We transplanted plants from ten populations of the European alpine monocarpic herb species Campanula thyrsoides L. to three sites along a steep mountain slope (600, 1, 235 and 1, 850  m above sea level) in the Swiss Alps and asked whether reproductive phenology adjusts plastically to elevation and if these responses were adaptive, i. e. increased the fitness of plants. We further assessed current genetic differentiation in phenotypic traits and whether any such origin effects were due to adaptation to climatic conditions of origin. Our results showed that transplantation to lower elevations caused strong shifts in phenology, with plants starting growth and flowering earlier than plants placed at higher elevations. However, compared to flower production at high <b>elevation,</b> <b>number</b> of flowers per plant decreased 21  % at mid- and 61  % at low elevation. The shift in phenology thus came with a high cost in fitness, and we suggest that phenology is maladaptive when C. thyrsoides faces temperature conditions deviating from its natural amplitude. We conclude that the frequently reported phenological shift in plant species as a response to global warming may include heavy fitness costs that may hamper species survival...|$|E
40|$|State highway {{agencies}} {{are obligated to}} maintain existing roads for the highway systems to work efficiently and with greater longevity. Every year NDOT is responsible for approximately 13, 150 lane miles of existing infrastructure. With that in mind, resources need to be provided to maintain the highway system. The purpose {{of this research was}} to estimate annual routine maintenance cost for several typical treatment methods of highways. Five prioritization categories of highways used by NDOT were considered. Linear regression models were developed that present the relationship between costs including total maintenance cost and five maintenance cost components: labor, equipment, materials, manpower and stockpile, and the influencing factors: traffic load, road geometry, pavement structure, and climate. It was expected that the cost model depends on various roadway factors including <b>elevation,</b> <b>number</b> of lanes, age of the pavement, last year of pavement construction work, average daily traffic (ADT), number of trucks, single axial load (ESAL), district work done, and weather conditions. This research undertook the following steps: data review, data correlation check, and ordinary least square regression analysis. Data used for the analysis was extracted from NDOT pavement management system. Five NDOT prioritization categories were used for data processing and the analysis. The regression models incorporated the same parameters used in the NDOT pavement management system; therefore they can be simply combined with the existing database. The analysis conducted in this study indicates that road age is a noteworthy factor for a number of life cycle segments and several maintenance cost activities. The life cycle segments varied with each prioritization category including routine maintenance activities and their schedule. For segments where the roadway age {{does not appear to be}} significant, the routine maintenance cost estimate stays constant. Routine maintenance activities may be scheduled at the times that are close to the time when a preventive maintenance or reconstruction is scheduled. This practice is reflected in the cost model that the annual maintenance cost may decline with time and suddenly increase at the end of their life cycle stages. Lastly, recommendations have been made to provide fundamentals for future study needs. Several research needs in the cost estimation model are apparent from this assessment. These include additional information regarding cost model development using various statistical tools, periodical data update, use of a larger sample size, and different approaches for constructing prioritization categories life cycle. Also, historical data should be updated constantly due to changes in the material and construction technology. Further, the construction technology might require more or less steps with certain treatments like chip seal or flush seal. Thus, it is recommended to update the data as major construction or material technology is implemented in the routine maintenance work...|$|E

40|$|Aim: We {{evaluate}} {{differences between}} and {{the applicability of}} three linear predictive models to determine butterfly hotspots in Belgium for nature conservation purposes. Location: The study is carried out in Belgium for records located to Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) grid cells of 5 x 5 km. Methods: We first determine the relationship between factors correlated to butterfly diversity by means of modified t-tests and principal components analysis; subsequently, we predict hotspots using linear models based on land use, climate and topographical variables of well-surveyed UTM grid cells (n = 197). The well-surveyed squares are divided into a training set and an evaluation set to test the model predictions. We apply three different models: (1) a 'statistically focused' model where variables are entered in descending order of statistical significance, (2) a 'land use-focused' model where land use variables known {{to be related to}} butterfly diversity are forced into the model and (3) a 'hybrid' model where the variables of the 'land use-focused model' are entered first and subsequently complemented by the remaining variables entered in descending order of statistical significance. Results: A principal components analyses reveals that climate, and to a large extent, land use are locked into topography, and that topography and climate are the variables most strongly correlated with butterfly diversity in Belgium. In the statistically focused model, biogeographical region alone explains 65 % of the variability; other variables entering the statistically focused model are the area of coniferous and deciduous woodland, elevation and the number of frost days; the statistically focused model explains 77 % of the variability in the training set and 66 % in the evaluation set. In the land use-focused model, biogeographical region, deciduous and mixed woodland, natural grassland, heathland and bog, woodland edge, urban and agricultural area and biotope diversity are forced into the model; the land use-focused model explains 68 % of the variability in the training set and 57 % in the evaluation set. In the hybrid model, all variables from the land use-focused model are entered first and the covariates <b>elevation,</b> <b>number</b> of frost days and natural grassland area are added on statistical grounds; the hybrid model explains 78 % of the variability in the training set and 67 % in the evaluation set. Applying the different models to determine butterfly diversity hotspots resulted in the delimitation of spatially different areas. Main conclusions: The best predictions of butterfly diversity in Belgium are obtained by the hybrid model in which land use variables relevant to butterfly richness are entered first after which climatic and topographic variables were added on strictly statistical grounds. The land use-focused model does not predict butterfly diversity in a satisfactory manner. When using predictive models to determine butterfly diversity, conservation biologists {{need to be aware of}} the consequences of applying such models. Although, in conservation biology, land use-focused models are preferable to statistically focused models, one should always check whether the applied model makes sense on the ground. Predictive models can target mapping efforts towards potentially species-rich sites and permits the incorporation of un-surveyed sites into nature conservancy policies. Species richness distribution maps produced by predictive modelling should therefore be used as pro-active conservation tools. SCOPUS: ar. jFLWINinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|Global urban {{population}} {{has increased from}} 22. 9 % in 1985 to 47 % in 2010. In spite of the tendency for urbanization worldwide, only about 2 % of Earth's land surface is covered by cities. Urban population in Iran is increasing due to social and economic development. The {{proportion of the population}} living in Iran urban areas has consistently increased from about 31 % in 1956 to 68. 4 % in 2006. Migration of the rural population to cities and population growth in cities have caused many problems, such as irregular growth of cities, improper placement of infrastructure and urban services. Air and environmental pollution, resource degradation and insufficient infrastructure, are the results of poor urban planning that have negative impact on the environment or livelihoods of people living in cities. These issues are a consequence of improper land use planning. Models have been employed to assist in our understanding of relations between land use and its subsequent effects. Different models for urban growth modeling have been developed. Methods from computational intelligence have made great contributions in all specific application domains and hybrid algorithms research as a part of them has become a big trend in computational intelligence. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) has the capability to deal with imprecise data by training, while fuzzy logic can deal with the uncertainty of human cognition. ANN learns from scratch by adjusting the interconnections between layers and Fuzzy Inference Systems (FIS) is a popular computing framework based on the concept of fuzzy set theory, fuzzy logic, and fuzzy reasoning. Fuzzy logic has many advantages such as flexibility and at the other sides, {{one of the biggest problems}} in fuzzy logic application is the location and shape and of membership function for each fuzzy variable which is generally being solved by trial and error method. In contrast, numerical computation and learning are the advantages of neural network, however, it is not easy to obtain the optimal structure. Since, in this type of fuzzy logic, neural network has been used, therefore, by using a learning algorithm the parameters have been changed until reach the optimal solution. Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) computing due to ability to understand nonlinear structures is a popular framework for solving complex problems. Fusion of ANN and FIS has attracted the growing interest of researchers in various scientific and engineering areas due to the growing need of adaptive intelligent systems to solve the real world problems. In this research, an ANFIS method has been developed for modeling land use change and interpreting the relationship between the drivers of urbanization.

40|$|The yak are the {{mainstay}} of livelihood for the nomads on the vast Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau of western China and adjacent regions. Yak withstand the extreme condition of a harsh, cold climate at high <b>elevations.</b> <b>Numbers</b> of yak in China are around 13 million. There {{are a number of}} recognized breeds, and microsatellite DNA markers have started to show some genetic distances between them. To improve productivity, yak can be hybridized with local or exotic cattle for use at lower elevation. The males of these hybrids are sterile. Crosses of domestic with wild yak show improved size and vigor. Traditionally, yak are managed in a transhumance system dictated by the seasons, but since the 1990 s this system has been breaking down as herders are given ownership of animals and rights to parcels of rangeland. One calf every two years is the norm, and most usually not before three years of age. Body weight of adult females varies somewhat among breeds and situations but is around 220 kg (bulls reaching twice that). Yak females may lose 25 % of their body weight over winter into early spring due to both low temperature and shortage of feed. For pregnant cows over that period, this can have unfavorable consequences for calf survival. Milk production is seasonal and averages among breeds from 150 to 500 kg with a fat content from 5. 4 % to 7. 5 %. Feces of yak are collected and dried for use as fuel. Fiber yields are variable (from 0. 5 to 2. 9 kg depending on breed and location), but the most valuable component is the down, representing about 60 % of the total fleece in calves but substantially less in adults...|$|R
