40|$|TH E absorbability {{values in}} chicks {{of a number}} of natural {{triglycerides}} and their <b>hydrolyzed</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> mixtures were determined by Young (1961) and by Ren-ner and Hill (1961). In both studies the percentage absorbability of the total mix-ture and of the individual fatty acids con-tained in these mixtures was determined. Very good agreement was obtained on the absorbability of the total lipid and the fatty acids contained in these lipid ma-terials for soybean oil, soybean oil fatty acids, lard and tallow. However, the ab-sorbability values found for beef tallow fatty acids and lard fat ty acids by these two investigators were markedly different. The absorbability values reported by Young (1961) for both tallow fatty acids and lard fatty acids were considerably higher than values found by Renner and Hill (1961). Examination of the absorb-ability values of the individual fatty acids in each of the fatty acid mixtures shows that most of the discrepancy occurred in the absorbability of palmitic and stearic acids. A detailed examination of the condi-tions under which these experiments were conducted showed a number of differences in the experimental diets and environ-mental conditions.

40|$|Owing to the {{destruction}} and loss of fatty acid in the extraction and hydrolysis process of extremely small lipid sample with inorganic strong basic solution, KOH or NaOH/ethanol, {{there is a great}} necessity for a hydrolysis reagent to defend {{the destruction}} and enhance the extraction of <b>hydrolyzed</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> during the hydrolysis and extraction steps. Tetramethylammonium hydroxide(TMAH) /methanol was employed as alternative. Standard triglycerides were hydrolyzed with 1 M KOH/ethanol and 1 M TMAH/methanol, respectively and fatty acid recoveries were determined in three different derivatives, methyl ester, trimethylsilyl(TMS) and N(O) -tert-butyldimethylsilyl(tBDMSi) derivatives. The recoveries of fatty acids from standard triglycerides with TMAH hydrolysis were higher from 1. 3 to 65 times than those of KOH hydrolysis. Fatty acid recoveries from the sample lipids, beef tallow, corn oil and tuna eyeball oil, also showed same results as standard triglycerides. The fatty acid composition of the sample lipids determined by TMAH bydrolysis showed close values with the values from the A. O. A. C. method regardless of derivatizatin methods. But in the case of KOH hydrolysis the fatty acid compositions showed significantly different values among the derivatives and from those of the A. O. A. C. method. In the KOH hydrolysis, the precision of the data obtained form recoveries or compositions of fatty acid were very poor compared to TMAH hydrolysis. In the extraction steps of hydrolyzed fatty acids on the case of KOH hydrolysis, substantial amount of fatty acid were simultaneously removed by the extraction with diethyl ether for removal of nonsuponifiable materials. When the hydrolyzed fatty acids after the extraction of nonsaponifiable materials extracted with hexane, significantly small amount were extracted compared to TMAH hydrolysis. The total amounts of fatty acids recovered from the residues of each layer in the extraction steps, such as diethyl ether layer for the removal of nonsaponifiable materials, hexane layer extracted fatty acids and the water layer remained after extraction of hydrolyzed fatty acids, were significantly higher in the case of TMAH hydrolysis than those of KOH hydrolysis...|$|E
40|$|Plant oils {{could provide}} a {{sustainable}} source of carbon for polyhydroxyalkanoate production as they are both renewable and inexpensive. No study to our knowledge has undertaken a comparative study {{of the use of}} major European and global commodity plants oils and products of their hydrolysis as substrates for medium chain length polyhydroxyalkanoate (mcl-PHA) production. There have been several studies which have investigated the use of plant oils and their hydrolysis products for short chain length PHA (scl-PHA) production, therefore, in this study, we have focused specifically on mcl-PHA-producing organisms. A comparison between direct growth on oils and the products of their hydrolysis is described here for several mcl-PHA-producing Pseudomonas strains. Pseudomonas putida KT 2440, CA- 3, GO 16, Pseudomonas chlororaphis 555 were screened for their ability to utilize a range of common plant oils (olive, sunflower, rapeseed, and palm) and their hydrolysis products as sole sources of carbon and energy for growth and PHA accumulation. When the oils were supplied in shaken flask experiments, P. putida CA- 3 and P. putida KT 2440 showed little or no growth, while P. putida GO 16 reached a cell dry weight of between 0. 33 and 0. 56 g L– 1, and accumulated mcl-PHA to between 12 and 25 % of CDW, P. chlororaphis 555 reached a cell dry weight of between 0. 67 and 0. 86 g L– 1, and accumulated mcl-PHA to between 27 and 34 % CDW in 48 h. In contrast, when the <b>hydrolyzed</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> mixtures were supplied, all 4 strains tested grew and accumulated mcl-PHA. P. putida CA- 3 and GO 16 achieved the highest biomass (1. 02 – 1. 06 g L– 1) with the majority of the hydrolyzed plant oil fatty acids, however P. chlororaphis 555 accumulated similar levels of PHA as these two strains. Despite being the strain of choice for mcl-PHA accumulation, for the majority of studies, P. putida KT 2440 achieved less biomass and accumulated less PHA than other strains tested with the majority of oil-derived fatty acids. It {{is important to note that}} both biomass and PHA levels varied significantly across strain and hydrolyzed oil type. Due to the fact that P. chlororaphis 555 was able to grow and accumulate PHA from both plant oils and hydrolyzed oil fatty acids, it was selected for bioreactor trials to try to achieve high cell density and high PHA productivity using rapeseed oil and hydrolyzed rapeseed oil fatty acids. Rapeseed oil (RO) and its hydrolysis product (HROFA) were chosen for these experiments because P. chlororaphis 555 accumulated approximately 30 % mcl-PHA from both substrates, and as this oil can be produced globally, it would offer less barriers to scale-up than Palm oil. The mcl-PHA volumetric productivity with RO as the substrate was 0. 53 g L– 1 h– 1 after 25 h with a yield of 0. 22 g PHA g– 1 oil, while the volumetric productivity with HROFA as the substrate was 0. 54 g L– 1 h– 1 after 25 h with again a lower yield of 0. 15 g PHA g– 1 HROFA. Thus, under the fermentation conditions tested, HROFA was an inferior substrate for PHA production when compared to RO...|$|E

Arachidonic acid is present in the phospholipids of whole animal extracts of both species.

These insects probably obtain the arachidonic acid from dietary phospholipids. We also report on a phospholipase A 2 activity in midgut preparations from third instars of the primary screwworm. Phospholipase A 2 is responsible for <b>hydrolyzing</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> from the sn- 2 position of dietary phospholipids to release essential <b>fatty</b> <b>acids.</b> The screwworm enzyme is similar to mammalian digestive phospholipase A 2 s because it depends on calcium for high catalytic activity, it is sensitive to the sitespecific inhibitor oleyloxyethylphosphorylcholine, and it interacts with heparin. We further characterized the screwworm midgut phospholipase A 2 by altering the reaction conditions, including reaction time, radioactive substrate concentration, protein concentration, pH and temperature.

40|$|Hepatic lipase and {{lipoprotein}} lipase <b>hydrolyze</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> from triacylglycerols and are {{critical in the}} metabolism of circulating lipoproteins. The two lipases are similar in size and amino acid sequence but are distinguished by functional differences in substrate preference and cofactor requirement. Presumably, these distinctions result from structural differences in functional domains. To begin localization of these domains, a chimeric lipase was constructed composed of the N-terminal 329 residues of rat hepatic lipase linked to the C-terminal 136 residues of human {{lipoprotein lipase}}. The chimera hydrolyzed both monodisperse short-chain (esterase) and emulsified long-chain (lipase) triacylglycerol substrates with catalytic and kinetic properties closely resembling those of native hepatic lipase. However, monoclonal antibodies to lipoprotein lipase inhibited the lipase activity, but not the esterase function, of the chimera. Therefore, the chimeric molecule is a functional lipase and contains elements and characteristics from both parental enzymes. It is proposed that the N-terminal domain, containing the active center from hepatic lipase, governs the catalytic character of the chimera, and the C-terminal domain is essential for hydrolysis of long-chain substrates...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{review the}} role of {{essential}} <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> in brain membrane function and in the genesis of psychi-atric disease. Method: Medline databases were searched for published articles with links among the following key words: essential <b>fatty</b> <b>acids,</b> omega- 3 <b>fatty</b> <b>acids,</b> docosahexanoic acid, eicosapentanoic acid, arachidonic acid, neurotransmission, phospholipase A 2, depression, schizophrenia, mental performance, attention-deficit hy-peractivity disorder, and Alzheimer’s disease. Biochemistry textbooks were consulted on {{the role of}} <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> in membrane function, neurotransmission, and eicosanoid formation. The 3 -dimensional structures of fatty ac-ids were obtained from the Web site of the Biochemistry Department, University of Arizona (2001). Results: The <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> composition of neuronal cell membrane phospholipids reflects their intake in the diet. The degree of a <b>fatty</b> <b>acid’s</b> desaturation determines its 3 -dimensional structure and, thus, membrane fluidity and function. The ratio between omega- 3 and omega- 6 polyunsaturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> (PUFAs), in particular, in-fluences various aspects of serotoninergic and catecholaminergic neurotransmission, as shown by studies in animal models. Phospholipase A 2 (PLA 2) <b>hydrolyzes</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> from membrane phospholipids: liberated omega- 6 PUFAs are metabolized to prostaglandins with a higher inflammatory potential, compared with those generated from the omega- 3 family. Thus the activity of PLA 2 coupled with membrane <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> composition may {{play a central role in}} the development of neuronal dysfunction. Intervention trials in human subjects show that omega- 3 <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> have possible positive effects in the treatment of various psychiatric disorders, but more data are needed to make conclusive directives in this regard. Conclusion: The ratio of membrane omega- 3 to omega- 6 PUFAs can be modulated by dietary intake.

Finally, the polyunsaturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> were concentrated by urea complexation. The results were assessed by <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> analysis on gas chromatography (GC) and lipid class analysis by liquid chromatography (LC). Two initial experiments with cod liver oil showed that the urea complexation was successful and the yield of omega- 3 <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> was high (over 90 % on average). The initial experiment on methanol extract of herring roe showed, however, a very low degree of concentration of EPA and DHA, and the product had high levels of cholesterol. In addition, there were major emulsion problems when the <b>hydrolyzed</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> were extracted. After the initial methanol-experiment with herring roe, focus was on solving the emulsion problem. Methanol was therefore replaced with ethanol {{in order to reduce the}} extraction of polar compounds that might cause the problems, but it gave no improvement. Neither did it help with addition of salts, heating or cooling the emulsified phases. Filtration through a burette filled with sodium chloride gave results but the method was not suitable for use in larger scale since it required large amounts of solvents and was time consuming. To find out more about the chemistry in the extraction, at which pH emulsion was formed and when cholesterol would go into the heptane phase, the ethanol-extracts of herring roe were titrated with 2 N HCl after the hydrolysis. The results showed that the cholesterol followed the <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> into the heptane phase and the emulsion occurred before most of the <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> passed into the apolar phase. The problem of cholesterol and emulsion therefore remained basically unsolved in our experiments. Four other experiments with ethanol-extraction were carried out in which extracts of herring roe and milt were collected to examine whether it was possible to achieve successful urea complexation by varying the concentration of <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> and urea on three different levels: low, medium or high concentration in total nine urea experiments. Highest concentration of EPA and DHA relative to other <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> were achieved with high concentration of <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> and medium concentration of urea, where the relationship between urea and <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> were 1, 96 : 1. In the most optimal urea experiment, the sum of EPA and DHA in the free fraction with <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> dissolved in ethanol was 76 %, where EPA and DHA were respectively 20 % and 56 % of total <b>fatty</b> <b>acids.</b> This is high levels compared to most omega- 3 products on the market. A high degree of concentration has its price in low yield. The percentage of EPA and DHA added to the urea process that was found in the concentrated fraction was respectively 73 % and 74 %. Thus, there was a loss of approximately 25 % of the two <b>fatty</b> <b>acids...</b>|$|R
30|$|Despite the {{popularity}} of alkanes as the main substrates for biotransformation processes, <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> and <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> methyl esters (FAMEs) have received more attention recently because they are considered as renewable resources. <b>Fatty</b> <b>acids</b> are naturally produced by plants whereas FAMEs are produced from transesterification of vegetable oils (Fukuda et al. 2001; Berchmans and Hirata 2008). Therefore, their use as the main raw material for DCA production can reduce the consumption of fossil fuels and would, thereby, prevent the aggravation of global warming. Recently, some researchers have elucidated the process of biotransformation of methyl laurate to dodecanedioic acid (Funk et al. 2017; Lee et al. 2017). These findings showed that Candida tropicalis could secrete several kinds of lipases and esterases for <b>hydrolyzing</b> FAMEs to <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> before converting them to DCAs (Galán-Ladero et al. 2010). Accordingly, FAMEs {{could be used as}} chief substrates for large-scale production of DCAs.|$|R
40|$|AbstractAnandamide (arachidonoylethanolamide, AnNH) {{is shown}} to {{activate}} human platelets, a process which was not inhibited by acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin). Unlike AnNH, hydroperoxides generated thereof by lipoxygenase activity, and the congener (13 -hydroxy) linoleoylethanolamide, were unable to activate platelets, though they counteracted AnNH-mediated stimulation. On the other hand, palmitoylethanolamide neither activated human platelets nor blocked the AnNH effects. AnNH inactivation by human platelets was afforded by a high-affinity transporter, which was activated by nitric oxide-donors up to 225 % of the control. The internalized AnNH could thus be <b>hydrolyzed</b> by a <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> amide hydrolase (FAAH), characterized {{here for the first}} time...|$|R
40|$|The primary {{function}} of adipose tissue is to store {{energy in the}} form of triacylglycerol, which is <b>hydrolyzed</b> to <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> to supply other tissues with energy. While insulin promotes the storage of triacylglycerol, catecholamines stimulate its hydrolysis. The development of type II diabetes is strongly associated with obesity, indicating a role of triacylglycerol metabolism in the pathogenesis of diabetes. Caveolae are plasma membrane invaginations found in most cells but are highly abundant in adipocytes. Insulin receptors are localized in caveolae and their function depends on intact caveolae structures. In the present thesis work, mass spectrometry-based methodology allowed identification of a number of new proteins and their posttranslational modifications in caveolae of human adipocytes. Variable N-terminal acetylation and phosphorylation of caveolin- 1 α and caveolin- 1 β were identified, which might regulate the function of caveolae. The transcription regulator protein PTRF was identified as the major caveolae associated protein. Specific proteolyti...|$|R
40|$|The lack of adipose {{triglyceride}} lipase (ATGL), a patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing {{enzyme that}} <b>hydrolyzes</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> from triacylglycerol (TAG) stored in multiple tissues, causes the autosomal recessive disorder neutral lipid storage disease with myopathy (NLSD-M). In two families of Lebanese and Italian origin presenting with NLSD-M, we identified two new missense mutations in highly conserved regions of ATGL (p. Arg 221 Pro and p. Asn 172 Lys) and a novel nonsense mutation (p. Trp 8 X). The Lebanese patients harbor homozygous p. Arg 221 Pro, whereas the Italian patients are heterozygotes for p. Asn 172 Lys and the p. Trp 8 X mutation. The p. Trp 8 X mutation {{results in a}} complete absence of ATGL protein, while the p. Arg 221 Pro and p. Asn 172 Lys mutations result in proteins with minimal lipolytic activity. Although these mutations did not affect putative catalytic residues or the lipid droplet (LD) -binding domain of ATGL, cytosolic LDs accumulated in cultured skin fibroblasts from the patients. The missense mutations might destabilize a random coil (p. Asn 172 Lys) or a helix (p. Arg 221 Pro) structure within or proximal to the patatin domain of the lipase, thereby interfering with the enzyme activity, while leaving intact the residues required to localize the protein to LDs. Overexpressing wild-type ATGL in one patients fibroblasts corrected the metabolic defect and effectively reduced the number and area of cellular LDs. Despite the poor lipase activity in vitro, the Lebanese siblings have a mild myopathy and not clinically evident myocardial dysfunction. The patients of Italian origin show a late-onset and slowly progressive skeletal myopathy. These findings suggest that {{a small amount of}} correctly localized lipase activity preserves cardiac function in NLSD-M...|$|R
30|$|Nanoemulsions {{prepared}} from {{vegetable oils}} generally display lower pH values; this is mainly {{attributed to the}} fact that during nanotization, the <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> esters present in vegetable oils gets <b>hydrolyzed</b> into free <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> [38]. The prepared nanoemulsions in the present study displayed stable pH values after 12  months when kept at different temperatures of 4 [*]±[*] 2  °C and 25 [*]±[*] 2  °C. Like pH, change in electrical conductivity also has substantial influence on nanoemulsion stability [38]. The electrical conductivity of the nanoformulation showed very slight difference {{over a period of time}} at different temperature conditions, therefore not significantly affecting overall droplet size. All oil-in-water nanoemulsions presented here displayed high physical stability over a period of time with constant pH, electrical conductivity, and stable droplet size at different temperatures.|$|R
