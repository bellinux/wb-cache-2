Some preliminary results of the corresponding research expose the possible sources for those large errors. The reference geoidal heights are the main suspect. Hence, {{in order to obtain}} a reliable assessment for GGM 05, the issue of building better references has to be addressed.

Through ad hoc tests on a full-scale model setup and the theoretical approach of a non linear 8 th-order suspension scheme, this study gives enhancement of the damping fluid active control on the feedback branch of the entire control system for significant improvement of the suspension response to typical road inputs.

It contains a network of four major road arteries, one of which leads directly into Israel toward the vicinity of Be'er Sheva, and three of which lead into Sinai, Egypt. During the 1948 Israeli War of independence, Egypt invaded Israel through this region. On December 22, 1948 Israeli forces launched a counter-offensive, code-named Operation Horev, against the Egyptians and succeeded in ejecting them from Nitzana. On November 24, 1949 Israel and Egypt signed an armistice whereby the Nitzana region, situated in Israel, was declared a demilitarized zone. The armistice agreement also stipulated that on the Egyptian {{side of the border}} [...] "no Egyptian defensive <b>positions</b> <b>shall</b> <b>be</b> closer to El Auja than El Qouseima and Abou Aoueigila."Different interpretations soon arose between Egypt and Israel concerning sovereignty rights in the demilitarized zone which invariably led to a number of border incidents, some of which resulted in fatalities.
