He later donated the bloody sock he wore during the game to the Baseball Hall of Fame museum. Much {{of the blame for}} the Cardinals' losses {{in the first two games}} was directed at the fact that Rolen, Edmonds and Reggie Sanders, three of the Cardinals' best batters, had combined for one hit in 22at-bats.|$|E

500|$|The {{directors}} cast Nielsen for {{his ability}} to play like [...] "a fish in water", saying [...] "You could have cast funny people and <b>done</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> everybody winking, goofing off, and silly... we wanted people to be oblivious to the comedy." [...] For Nielsen, Airplane! marked a shift from dramatic roles to deadpan comedy. When it was suggested his role in Airplane! was against type, Nielsen protested that he had [...] "always been cast against type before", and that comedy was what he always wanted to do. The same directors cast Nielsen in a similar style, in their TV series Police Squad!. The series introduced Nielsen as Frank Drebin, the stereotypical police officer modelled after serious characters in earlier police series.|$|E

He's smarter than that... He could have changed a couple of bars in that song and nobody could ever have touched him, but he {{just let it go}} and paid the price. Maybe he thought God would just sort of let him off." [...] Ringo Starr's reaction was more charitable: [...] "There's no doubt that the tune is similar but how many songs have been written with other melodies in mind?

500|$|AllMusics Stephen Thomas Erlewine {{said that}} unlike their {{previous}} two albums, [...] "there is no grappling with new sounds and styles, only an {{embrace of the}} thick aural onslaught of [...] "Stupid Girl" [...] and [...] "Vow". He complimented Manson's [...] "keenly aware lyrics" [...] and said that their hooks are efficiently delivered while [...] "no flab in either the composition or production" [...] is evident. He summarized the album [...] "as a simultaneous testament and revival of their strengths", but [...] "what once was futuristic now sounds nostalgic." [...] Tim Grierson wrote in The About Group {{that out of the}} many '90s bands that reunited in the last few years, [...] "none have <b>done</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> as much gusto as Garbage" [...] as they [...] "return with their sexy, edgy vibe intact" [...] and Manson [...] "sounds as ferocious and bruised as ever." ...|$|E

Under the inscription [...] "Architect of this cathedral" [...] is a simple shield and a small, worn, plaque with a mosaic surround, bearing Burges's entwined initials and name. Legal complications obstructed Burges's wish to be buried in the cathedral he had built. Burges's own words on Saint Fin Barre's, in his letter of January 1877 to the Bishop of Cork, sum up his career, [...] "Fifty years hence, the whole affair will be on its trial and, the elements of time and cost being forgotten, the result only will be looked at.

Christgau grouped it with contemporary releases by Love (Forever Changes) and The Beach Boys (Wild Honey), remarking: [...] "t's {{hard to believe}} that so much good can come out of one place [...]" [...] In the UK, Record Mirror gave the album a rare five-star rating, commenting [...] "Hard though it was for the Byrds to follow-up their near-perfect Younger Than Yesterday album, they've <b>done</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> this fantastic disc." [...] Melody Maker was also complimentary about the album, describing it as [...] "A beautiful selection, representing US pop at its finest." [...] Beat Instrumental concluded their review by stating [...] "It's true to say that the Byrds are one of the two best groups in the world. Nobody can say any different with the proof of this album." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{preparations}} [...] for {{the first}} German performance of Noye's Fludde in Ettal, planned for May 1959, {{the problem of the}} scarcity of handbells [...] became acute. Britten suggested that in the absence of handbells a set of tubular bells in E flat in groups of twos and threes could be played by four or six children with two hammers each to enable them to strike the chords. Britten was not present in Ettal, but he learned from Ernst Roth, of Boosey & Hawkes, that the Ettal production had substituted glockenspiel and metallophone for the handbells; according to Roth the bells in Carl Orff's Schulwerk percussion ensembles were [...] "too weak" [...] for the purpose. Britten later wrote to a friend: [...] "I am rather relieved that I wasn't there! – no church, no bugles, no handbells, no recorders – but they seem to have <b>done</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> a great deal of care all the same. Still I rather hanker after doing it in Darmstadt as we want it – even importing handbells for instance." ...|$|E

I made everyone stand in a circle, with me in the center, and I said, being onstage, you have to trust your fellow actors, especially when you're an improviser. You're {{going to be there for}} each other, and they're going to be there for you. For example, I'm going to fall back, knowing that you'll catch me. Then I let myself fall backward, and sure enough, I was caught. Everyone gets out some nervous laughter, and then they all took turns doing it. By the time it got around to Mariska Hargitay, we'd already <b>done</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> ten or eleven students, and they had clearly gotten the point. Then it was Mariska's turn. 'Okay, Mariska, cross your arms in front of you and gently fall back,' I said. She fell back and nobody caught her. She fell flat on her ass. I was horrified. This had never happened in one of my classes before." ...|$|E

The album received many positive reviews. Paul Cashmere from Undercover Music wrote, [...] "By covering the classics on The Memphis Album Guy Sebastian discovered Guy Sebastian. He has drawn from that epitome and created what should be considered the debut album from the next phase of his career. [...] If The Memphis Album was Guy's initiation into becoming a Soul Man then Like It Like That is the graduation. Ara Jansen said in The West Australian, [...] "While there are plenty of pop elements to the album, Sebastian has finally and unabashedly unleashed his soul side. He's also <b>done</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> a big grin on his face as songs such as the wonderful [...] "Magic" [...] and the title track fizz like a soft drink on a hot day." [...] A reviewer for TV Central wrote, [...] "There's no doubt in anyone's mind that Sebastian's previous 'Memphis' record has inspired him like no other. From the first beat of his new album, it screams soul. It's bold, brash, but it works — it really works. It's {{probably one of the most}} cohesive albums from Sebastian to date. Listening from start to finish, you truly feel like you’ve experienced a musical journey. [...] The album, while not without its flaws, is definitely one of the most artistically complex records we've heard from an 'Australian Idol' artist to date. It's rich, multi-layered and engaging." ...|$|E
