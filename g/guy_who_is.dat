He always tries to save his friends if he can and is a reliable force in the team. He and Yui constantly irritate one another on a daily basis, but deep down, he cares for Yui, as shown when he helps her pass on by telling her he would marry her. He is a talented baseball player, and his regret in life was his failure to catch a baseball, which cost his team an important baseball game. He nicknamed Yuri as Yurippe when they co-founded the SSS as {{he did not feel}} comfortable calling her Yuri, because his mother has the same name. He has shown romantic feelings towards Yuri in Track Zero, although he finds himself getting attracted to Yui much later in the series. He died from getting hit by a truck. He uses an RPK-74 and an S 645.|$|E

In the story he {{comes across as a}} {{friendly}} understanding <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> aware of his girlfriend's shyness, and does his best to remedy the situation.

5000|$|Sheridan {{joined the}} Federal Bureau of Investigation, resigning {{after four years}} over J. Edgar Hoover's focus on anti-Communism. As Sheridan later put it, [...] "Hoover was more {{interested}} in <b>guys</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> Communists for 15 minutes in 1931 than he <b>was</b> in <b>guys</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> stealing New Jersey." [...] He was then a National Security Agency investigator for three years.|$|R

25|$|The single's {{official}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Herb Ritts. The music video features two parts which frequently interchange back and forth throughout the song. The {{first part of the}} video shows Lopez having a small party in her home with guests including Ja Rule and Ashanti. This part of the video is {{from the point of view}} of the <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> being mentioned in the song. His face is not seen, and Lopez addresses the camera throughout this section of the video. This section begins with the guy knocking on the door, Lopez inviting him in, and then eventually showing him the door when she sees him attempting to look/flirt with other women at the party. As he leaves, she goes on entertaining the other guests. The second part of the video involves scenes with Lopez, Ja Rule and Cadillac tah in a white room, Ja Rule in a recording studio in Lopez's home, Lopez sitting in a chair singing bits of the song, and Lopez and Ja Rule singing the parts of the final verse against a gold backdrop.|$|E
500|$|Raleigh's {{older brother}} and co-pilot. Klattenhoff joined the project to work with del Toro. Describing his character, Klattentoff stated: [...] "This is a <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> looking out for his very eager, younger brother and they were enabled with this gift that gave them the {{opportunity}} to kind of save the world. Or help, at least." [...] Tyler Stevenson plays Yancy as a child.|$|E
500|$|When {{creating}} the character, Elwes {{did not want}} the character to be looked as [...] "good or bad", even having discussing it with Carter and Frank Spotnitz, another executive producer of the show. The producers and actors have instead labeled him as [...] "ambiguous", and a man who wants to see [...] "evidence through logic" [...] and not superstition. When describing his character to The Hollywood Reporter, Elwes said he [...] "is a <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> a little more buttoned up, a little more polished; he represents a different kind of FBI." ...|$|E

500|$|Dworsky was a {{four-year}} starter under Michigan's legendary coach, Fritz Crisler. Dworsky later said that Crisler's [...] "real genius" [...] was in blending all the elements. The 1947 championship team included several older veteran players who {{had returned from}} military service. Dworsky recalled: [...] "About half of us were 18-year old kids, and half were veterans. We had <b>guys</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> serious <b>guys</b> and <b>guys</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> excitable. Fritz struck a balance, so we never had to be pushed, but we never lost our focus either." ...|$|R
50|$|William's {{rule was}} peaceful, but short, as he {{died two years}} after {{assuming}} power in Achaea (1287). He was succeeded by his son <b>Guy,</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> seven years old.|$|R
500|$|The {{character}} {{progression of}} Shane is {{a focal point}} in [...] "TS-19". After facing constant rejection from Lori {{through much of the}} previous three episodes, he has become more agitated and impatient with her. According to Kirkman, it was important to integrate dimension to the character so that viewers [...] "can see later in the episode, when [...] is losing it and actually getting somewhat violent with Lori, the transition he's gone through and how this world has changed him from being a loving, easygoing guy into this <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> slowly devolving into a bit of a maniac." ...|$|E
500|$|Classmates {{believed}} [...] "the plays {{were really}} morbid and grotesque." [...] Ian MacFarlane, Cho's former classmate, stated that, [...] "when we read Cho's plays, {{it was like}} something out of a nightmare. The plays had really twisted, macabre violence that used weapons I wouldn't have even thought of." [...] When Stephen Davis, a senior who was also in Cho's class, read Richard McBeef, he turned to his roommate and said, [...] "This is the kind of <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> going to walk into a classroom and start shooting people." [...] Anna Brown, another student in the class, sometimes joked with her friends that Cho was [...] "the kind of guy who might go on a rampage killing." ...|$|E
500|$|Tsamere has {{described}} Valenton's profession as [...] "not {{far from the}} style of what I am, [...] very far in substance"; {{he said of the}} character: [...] "Under his generous side as a friend who is keeping his promise ... we have a <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> ... in the end quite megalomaniacal." [...] The show deals with the theme of death, which Tsamere said is [...] "a bit strange, but it has the virtue of attracting the public's attention". He said that he and his co-authors thought that [...] "the most irrefutable reason to go on stage ... was to talk about something strong". Tsamere {{has described}} how the show changed as the size of its audiences grew and he incorporated improvisations.|$|E

500|$|In {{response}} to a reviewer's criticism of Bond as villainous, Fleming said in a 1964 Playboy interview {{that he did not}} consider his character to be particularly evil or good: [...] "I don't think that he is necessarily a good guy or a bad <b>guy.</b> <b>Who</b> <b>is?</b> He's got his vices and very few perceptible virtues except patriotism and courage, which are probably not virtues anyway... But I didn't intend for him to be a particularly likeable person." [...] Fleming agreed with some critics' characterisation of Bond as an unthinking killer, but expressed that he was a product of his time: [...] "James Bond is a healthy, violent, noncerebral man in his middle-thirties, and a creature of his era. I wouldn't say he's particularly typical of our times, but he's certainly of the times." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} {{track on}} the album, [...] "I'm Going Bananas", is a Carmen Miranda-ish song {{done in a}} Spanish accent. A salsa rhythm is predominant, with Madonna squeezing her vocal cords while singing, backed by percussion and brass. In the fifth track, [...] "Crybaby", Madonna mimics the vocals of Betty Boop. The melody is heard over the interlining synth strings, horns and trumpets, and a bass. Rooksby explained that Madonna sang about a <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> [...] "too sensitive and soft", and the chorus employs a chromatic chord sequence. The next track [...] "Something to Remember" [...] deals with her failed marriage to Penn and {{was the source of}} inspiration for naming her 1995 compilation album. Musically, it has melancholy chords and rambling melody, which according to Taraborrelli made it the most compelling song by Madonna.|$|E
500|$|Following his debut, Kapoor {{reunited with}} Ghosh {{in a film}} he {{considered}} to be drastically different from Ishq Vishk. The thriller Fida (2004) featured him as a love-struck student who is manipulated by a woman (Kareena Kapoor) and her lover (Fardeen Khan) to rob a bank. Despite criticising the film, Rama Sharma of The Tribune wrote that Kapoor [...] "shines in his role. He looks fresh. As an impulsive emotional and innocent <b>guy,</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> sucked into crime because of these very qualities, he manages to evoke your sympathies." [...] Later that year, Kapoor appeared in the romantic comedy Dil Maange More {{in which he was}} paired opposite three women: Soha Ali Khan, Tulip Joshi, and Ayesha Takia. Patcy N of Rediff.com praised his dancing skills but was wary of his imitation of Shah Rukh Khan's acting style. Both his 2004 releases were commercially unsuccessful.|$|E
5000|$|As a {{consequence}} of this paradigm shift, Rex O'Herlihan (Berenger), a [...] "singing cowboy," [...] is the only character aware of the plot outline. He explains that he [...] "knows the future" [...] inasmuch as [...] "these Western towns are all the same" [...] and that it's his [...] "karma" [...] to [...] "ride into a town, help the good <b>guys,</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> usually poor for some reason, against the bad <b>guys,</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> usually rich for some reason, and ride out again." [...] Rex's knowledge is also connected to the unspecified [...] "root" [...] vegetables he digs up and eats.|$|R

500|$|With his {{contract}} expiring in the off-season, Teemu Selänne, who had since {{returned to the}} Ducks, was reportedly in talks with team management to sign Kariya. On August 27, 2010, however, {{on the advice of}} doctors who refused to clear him to play, Kariya announced that he would sit out the 2010–11 season with post-concussion syndrome. While the symptoms eventually did subside somewhat, the same doctors advised Kariya that it was too risky to try to play again, and Kariya officially announced his retirement from hockey on June 29, 2011, through the NHLPA. He continued to be outspoken regarding the prevalence of concussions among hockey players; {{in an interview with the}} Globe and Mail, he commented, [...] "The thing I worry about is that you'll get a <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> playing with a concussion, and he gets hit, and he dies at centre ice." ...|$|E
500|$|Ellie Kendrick, who portrays Meera Reed in the series, in an {{interview}} with The Hollywood Reporter spoke about the re-introduction of Benjen Stark, or Coldhands Benjen, and working with Joseph Mawle, saying [...] "It was so fantastic. And it's interesting. If you've read the books, then you know about the Coldhands character, who was cut out of the Bran, Meera and Jojen storyline on the show. It was always interesting, having read the books, watching this amalgamation of story lines happen. Benjen is sort of like the Coldhands character in that he's a slightly suspicious <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> half-dead and half-alive with blue hands. I thought that was very cool, the way it happened. It was a nice marriage between the book and TV revelations rolled into one. I was very excited having him on set. I loved working with Joseph Mawle, and I loved having another member of our rapidly dwindling gang." ...|$|E
500|$|The song {{itself was}} {{recorded}} at Chalice Recording Studios in Los Angeles. In {{an interview with}} Noisey, Oh Land spoke with Kim Taylor Bennett who asked her for further clarification on the lyrics. Bennett interpreted the lyrics as a [...] "girl who is perhaps incapable of love and commitment" [...] {{but by the end}} of the song, it is revealed that [...] "it's the <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> the asshole", to which Oh Land confirmed and said, [...] "Yeah, so it's like, 'fuck you!'". She also described it as a song that [...] "fast-forwards a bit" [...] and inspires her because she believes that she [...] "will do everything better when [...] get older". Oh Land discusses loving someone to a deeper extent as she ages: [...] "I will wrap my arms around you and keep you from the cold / I will love you better when I'm old". Several music critics described [...] "Love You Better" [...] as a ballad. The Guardians Paul MacInnes called the song an [...] "acoustic ballad", while Leonie Cooper from NME felt it was a [...] "folk ballad".|$|E

500|$|In 2000, Bartley and ÓBriain {{had been}} promised [...] "exclusive access" [...] to Chávez by the government's Minister of Communications. They arrived in Venezuela in September 2001. While filming the pilot they met the president, after which they reconsidered their approach. Bartley explained, [...] "We had... this notion of {{investigating}} Chávez—was he a demagogue? Was the media persona just that? What makes him tick? My sense had changed as we got closer; what we're seeing here is a <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> motivated, driven, not the demagogue with another side, drinking, carousing. I began {{to see him as}} more transparent—what {{you see is what you}} get." [...] Bartley and ÓBriain began by attempting to build a relationship with Chávez that would allow them the access they required. At first, the president's staff treated the filmmakers with suspicion and made filming difficult. After numerous delays, Bartley and ÓBriain finally got through to Chávez. They calculated that they needed to [...] "press the right buttons" [...] to gain his support, so they presented [...] him with an old edition of the memoirs of the general Daniel Florence O'Leary, irish who had fought alongside Simón Bolívar. Inside, they had written a quote from the Irish socialist playwright Seán O'Casey. Slowly, Bartley and ÓBriain gained their subjects' trust, [...] "dissolving any self-consciousness as a result of their cameras".|$|E
500|$|Pete Oliva of North Texas Daily {{said the}} episode [...] "proves {{that it is}} {{possible}} to laugh and cry at the same time without being able to control either response." [...] Bill Gibron of DVD Verdict said [...] "When Flanders Failed" [...] shows that even if The Simpsons is not dealing with famous celebrities or [...] "high profile places", the writers can still [...] "wring uproarious comedy out of their cast of regulars. Flanders is a special creation in the canon of humor, a regular <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> funny because of how hyper-normal he is compared to his Neanderthal neighbors. The focus on people who are left-handed, and the whole idea of being a lefty, is an unusual basis for a television show. But then again, nothing about The Simpsons is ever common." [...] Hock Guan Teh of DVD Town also praised the writers, stating that they [...] "are able to craft a downtrodden tale for the perpetually clueless Flanders family that serves to illustrate how dark emotions can eventually be overcome by Homer's guilt. A memorable episode." [...] Niel Harvey of The Roanoke Times called [...] "When Flanders Failed" [...] a [...] "classic bit of Simpsonia." [...] The episode's reference to It's a Wonderful Life [...] was named the 26th greatest film reference in the history of the show by Total Films Nathan Ditum.|$|E
500|$|Additionally, Paul Bettany was {{the first}} actor to portray two main {{characters}} within the universe, voicing Tony Stark's artificial intelligence J.A.R.V.I.S. in the Iron Man and Avengers films, and portraying Vision in Avengers films and Captain America: Civil War. Stan Lee, creator or co-creator {{of many of the}} characters seen in the MCU, has cameo appearances in all of the feature films and television series. In Iron Fist, it is revealed his on-set photograph cameo in the Marvel Netflix series is as NYPD Captain Irving Forbush. His cameo in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 sees Lee appearing as an informant to the Watchers, discussing previous adventures that include Lee's cameos in other MCU films; he specifically mentions his time as a FedEx delivery man, referring to Lee's cameo in Captain America: Civil War. This acknowledged the fan theory that Lee may be portraying the same character in all his cameos, with writer and director James Gunn noting that [...] "people thought Stan Lee is [...] and that all of these cameos are part of him being a Watcher. So, Stan Lee as a <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> working for the Watchers was something that I thought was fun for the MCU." [...] Feige added that Lee [...] "clearly exists, you know, above and apart from the reality of all the films. So the notion that he could be sitting there on a cosmic pit stop during the jump gate sequence in Guardians...really says, so wait a minute, he's this same character who's popped up in all these films?" ...|$|E
