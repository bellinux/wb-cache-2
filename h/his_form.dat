5|$|Although {{his poor}} batting meant <b>his</b> <b>form</b> as an all-rounder was disappointing, {{he had a}} very good season as a bowler. Nevertheless, his {{selection}} to tour Australia that winter with the MCC team surprised commentators.|$|E
5|$|An ageing West Indian team relied {{increasingly}} on Ambrose and Walsh {{to provide}} wickets, while Lara {{was seen as}} the primary source of runs. Angus Fraser played an important role for England, and when <b>his</b> <b>form</b> dipped in the later Tests the side's performance suffered.|$|E
5|$|Australia fell to {{successive}} defeats in {{the opening}} two Tests, Bradman making two ducks in his four innings, {{and it seemed that}} the captaincy was affecting <b>his</b> <b>form.</b> The selectors made another four changes to the team for the Third Test at Melbourne.|$|E
5|$|<b>His</b> <b>forms</b> {{are usually}} abstractions {{of the human}} figure, {{typically}} depicting mother-and-child or reclining figures. Moore's works are usually suggestive of the female body, apart from a phase in the 1950s when he sculpted family groups. <b>His</b> <b>forms</b> are generally pierced or contain hollow spaces. Many interpreters liken the undulating <b>form</b> of <b>his</b> reclining figures to the landscape and hills of his birthplace, Yorkshire.|$|R
50|$|Early in his career, {{changing}} from <b>his</b> human <b>form</b> into <b>his</b> Sasquatch <b>form</b> caused Langkowski extreme physical discomfort.|$|R
50|$|Henry Moore (1898-1986) emerged after World War II as Britain's leading sculptor. He {{was best}} known for his semi-abstract monumental bronze sculptures which are located around the world as public works of art. <b>His</b> <b>forms</b> are usually abstractions of the human figure, {{typically}} depicting mother-and-child or reclining figures, usually suggestive of the female body, apart from a phase in the 1950s when he sculpted family groups. <b>His</b> <b>forms</b> are generally pierced or contain hollow spaces.|$|R
5|$|Based on <b>his</b> <b>form</b> for the Services, Hassett was {{selected}} in the Australian team for a brief five-match tour of New Zealand in February and March 1946. As the military men played poorly in Australia, the national selectors concluded that their achievements against England must have been against weak opposition, and only Hassett and Miller were selected for the Australian tour of New Zealand.|$|E
5|$|Collingwood's {{form in the}} 2009 World Twenty20 tournament wasn't good: in five innings, {{managing}} just 63 runs. More important, however, was <b>his</b> <b>form</b> in {{the longest}} version of the game, {{in which he had}} attained something like a peak. Going into the 2009 Ashes, indeed, he was relishing his best-ever run in the Test side, having hoarded three centuries in his last twelve innings.|$|E
5|$|Fingleton rediscovered <b>his</b> <b>form</b> {{between the}} Tests, scoring 121 against the Gentlemen of England and 96 against Lancashire. Again however, Fingleton {{was unable to}} {{maintain}} the momentum in the Tests, making 31 and 4 against England in the Second Test at Lord's, which ended in another draw.|$|E
25|$|Although {{his initial}} {{appearance}} was timid, <b>his</b> true <b>form</b> was rather quite big {{and had a}} large tail. In <b>his</b> diminutive <b>form,</b> <b>his</b> body has a huge resilience. He is based on Pigmon from episode 8 of Ultraman.|$|R
5000|$|Baymax is an {{artificial}} synthformer capable of synthtransing his body into various <b>forms.</b> <b>His</b> default <b>form</b> {{is a large}} humanoid male designed to be less conspicuous in public while attending to Hiro's daily needs. <b>His</b> other <b>forms</b> [...] "Battle-Dragon" [...] and [...] "Action-Mecha", are significantly more powerful and imposing than <b>his</b> default humanoid <b>form,</b> and are primarily used during undercover missions and other hostile operations. When Baymax sustains physical injuries beyond his damage threshold, he automatically reverts to <b>his</b> humanoid <b>form</b> and becomes temporarily depowered.|$|R
5000|$|This is {{the only}} episode where the Man in Black appears in <b>his</b> original, human <b>form.</b> In all of his other appearances, he is either in <b>his</b> smoke <b>form</b> or the smoke {{in the form of}} a dead person. Although he appears in <b>his</b> own <b>form</b> in [...] "The Incident" [...] and [...] "Ab Aeterno", this was an {{imitation}} of <b>his</b> original <b>form</b> which by that point was dead.|$|R
5|$|<b>His</b> <b>form</b> linked {{him to a}} £4million {{transfer}} to Leeds United. However Humphreys remained at Sheffield Wednesday and played 34 matches {{for them in the}} 1996–97 season. His performances earned him a place in the England team for the 1997 FIFA U-20 World Cup in Malaysia. Humphreys wore the much coveted number 9 shirt for that tournament.|$|E
5|$|However, he {{recovered}} {{to be selected}} for the First Test at Edgbaston, just five days later. He made 82 as Australia scored 9/516 declared and took a 321-run first innings lead, but England could not be dismissed in the second innings and salvaged a draw. He continued <b>his</b> <b>form</b> with an unbeaten 104 against Kent between the Tests.|$|E
5|$|However, <b>his</b> <b>form</b> {{improved}} {{and he won}} his third All England Open and India Open titles, although he was beaten by Simon Santoso in final of the Singapore Open. In the Thomas Cup, Lee won every match he played. Malaysia reached the finals, but lost to Japan with a score of 3–2.|$|E
50|$|Violator {{appears in}} the HBO miniseries Todd McFarlane's Spawn. The Violator in <b>his</b> human <b>form</b> was voiced by Michael Nicolosi, and in <b>his</b> demonic <b>form</b> by James Hanes. Violator's true form is only shown briefly in three episodes while <b>his</b> human <b>form</b> appears {{in most of the}} episodes of the series.|$|R
50|$|Super Hero Generation (2014): Mebius is {{revealed}} {{as one of}} the playable characters in the game, featuring <b>his</b> <b>forms</b> and abilities in the series proper.|$|R
50|$|In November 1967 Eisch {{returned}} to the University of Wisconsin as a visiting professor. For two months he worked in Littleton’s studio, creating about 200 pieces of glass for exhibition in the United States. Watching Eisch develop <b>his</b> <b>forms</b> intrigued Littleton. Working with his assistant, Karl Paternoster, Eisch created “small, involved sculptural forms” that he fumed to unify the forms’ surfaces, giving them the iridescence that one sees in Art Nouveau glass. Eisch later resorted to enameling the exteriors of his pieces to strengthen <b>his</b> <b>forms.</b>|$|R
5|$|In 2000 Thorkildsen {{took his}} first medal at the Norwegian championships, {{finishing}} in silver medal position behind Ronny Nilsen. <b>His</b> <b>form</b> earned Thorkildsen his first call-up to the Norwegian European Cup team. In October he participated at the World Junior Championships and received a silver medal behind winner Gerhardus Pienaar from South Africa.|$|E
5|$|Jesé {{struggled}} {{to settle in}} Paris, however, {{and by the end}} of the year he had only started in one of his nine league appearances for the club. His lack of form and infrequent game time, which totaled 358 minutes, prompted manager Unai Emery to suggest that he would be leaving the club during the January transfer window in order to rediscover <b>his</b> <b>form.</b>|$|E
5|$|Leopard Trek's squad for the Vuelta a España {{consisted}} of Bennati, Cancellara, Fuglsang, Monfort, O'Grady, Viganò, Wagner, Zaugg, and Rohregger. Bennati was speculated to be a {{contender for the}} Vuelta's sprint stages, while for Cancellara the race represented an opportunity to hone <b>his</b> <b>form</b> ahead of the world championships. No rider on the squad was highlighted as an overall contender.|$|E
50|$|Devotional {{poems of}} <b>his</b> <b>formed</b> {{part of the}} Yellow Book of Lecan. Extracts of his verse were cited as models of poetic {{excellence}} in bardic school and tutorial tracts.|$|R
50|$|Proteus {{eventually}} went to Edinburgh, {{to possess}} his father, Joseph. After possessing his father, Proteus made a last {{stand against the}} X-Men. Joseph MacTaggert's body was destroyed in the battle. Before Proteus could take another host, Colossus (in <b>his</b> metallic <b>form)</b> punched Proteus in <b>his</b> energy <b>form.</b> Due to Proteus' intolerance for metal, {{he was unable to}} maintain <b>his</b> energy <b>form.</b> <b>His</b> energy was therefore dispersed across the world, and the X-Men and Moira assumed that he had been killed.|$|R
50|$|In {{the film}} {{adaptation}} of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Barty is played in <b>his</b> normal <b>form</b> by David Tennant and in <b>his</b> Moody <b>form</b> by Brendan Gleeson.|$|R
5|$|On December 21, 1927, Coveleski {{signed with}} the New York Yankees in an attempt at a comeback. In his final season, he posted a 5–1 record with a 5.74 ERA in 12 appearances. Coveleski failed to regain <b>his</b> <b>form,</b> however, {{pitching}} his last game on August 3, and after the signing of Tom Zachary, manager Miller Huggins released Coveleski. He retired from the game later that year.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the 2012 Tour, Wiggins's highest {{finishes}} in a Grand Tour were {{third in the}} 2011 Vuelta a España and fourth in the 2009 Tour (later promoted to third after Lance Armstrong's result was annulled in October 2012). Wiggins had shown <b>his</b> <b>form</b> in the lead-up to the Tour by winning the general classifications in three stage races in the 2012 season: the Paris–Nice, the Tour de Romandie and the Dauphiné. As a time trialist, Wiggins {{was thought to be}} the rider most suited to the race's course. The 2011 Tour winner Evans came back from an illness earlier in the season to win the two-day Critérium International and place third at the Dauphiné. The 2010 Vuelta a España winner Nibali had shown <b>his</b> <b>form</b> in the lead-up to the Tour by winning the Tirreno–Adriatico stage race.|$|E
5|$|Satan preaches from {{a raised}} earth mound and {{is dressed in}} {{clerical}} clothing {{that may be a}} soutane. He has a goat-like beard and horns, and stands in silhouette, accentuating his heavy body and gaping mouth, which is depicted as if he is screaming. <b>His</b> <b>form</b> may be derived from a 1652 illustration of the Canaanite idol Molech, as illustrated by Athanasius Kircher.|$|E
50|$|Walker {{was adamant}} that he filled in <b>his</b> <b>forms</b> {{correctly}} and denied all allegations relating to his ex-wives. He maintained {{that he has}} been the subject of a smear campaign.|$|R
50|$|<b>His</b> <b>forms</b> {{are highly}} varied and he {{employed}} alliteration and rhyme, but also wrote free verse and prose poetry. Some of his longer poems employ the traditional Icelandic {{form of the}} thula.|$|R
5000|$|Although a transmetal {{version of}} Waspinator {{was made in}} the toy line, Waspinator {{remained}} in <b>his</b> original <b>form</b> in the television series from first episode to last (the only one of the original five Predacons to do so). There was also a [...] "Fox Kids" [...] repaint of <b>his</b> original <b>form,</b> which was in new colors, and one of <b>his</b> transmetal <b>form</b> which had the colors of Buzz Saw.|$|R
5|$|The {{inexperience}} of {{the tour}} manager, Rupert Howard, and Allen's vice-captain, Walter Robins, left Allen with a heavy workload for the 1936–37 tour; he later suggested to the MCC that this affected <b>his</b> <b>form.</b> In the early part {{of the tour}}, Allen selected the team by himself, but later used Robins, Bob Wyatt, Wally Hammond and Maurice Leyland as a selection committee.|$|E
5|$|Trescothick {{played well}} against a weak Zimbabwe {{side in the}} two-Test series in May–June 2003, and scored an unbeaten century in the three ODIs against Pakistan {{averaging}} over 100. <b>His</b> <b>form</b> continued in the 2003 NatWest Series, with 114 not out against South Africa. The opening stand with Vikram Solanki of 200 runs was the highest first-wicket partnership for England and provided the first instance of both England openers scoring centuries in the same innings. Trescothick maintained <b>his</b> <b>form</b> in the South Africa Test matches; a career-best 219 at The Oval completed a successful series in which he averaged 60.87.|$|E
5|$|A Syndicate surgeon {{attempting}} to procure the alien fetus is killed {{by one of}} the alien rebels, who assumes <b>his</b> <b>form.</b> Krycek finds the dead surgeon and the fetus missing, and tells Spender that the rebels are now going to succeed in their goals to halt colonization. The Syndicate and its families gather at El Rico Air Force Base. Shortly after Fowley arrives, a white light appears around one end of the hangar. It is revealed to be the rebels, who surround and immolate the entire Syndicate—except for The Smoking Man and Fowley—who escape by car.|$|E
5000|$|Ayodhya Prasad {{tried to}} make his fortune in cane farming in Yalalevu, but soon learnt of the realities of sugar cane farming in Fiji in the 1930s. This led to <b>his</b> <b>forming</b> the Kisan Sangh.|$|R
50|$|Trapped in <b>his</b> monstrous <b>form,</b> Grimm is {{an unhappy}} yet {{reliable}} {{member of the}} team. He trusts in his friend Reed Richards to one day develop a cure for his condition. However, when he encounters blind sculptress Alicia Masters, Grimm develops an unconscious resistance to being transformed back to <b>his</b> human <b>form.</b> Subconsciously fearing that Masters prefers him {{to remain in the}} monstrous form of the Thing, Grimm's body rejects various attempts by Richards to restore <b>his</b> human <b>form,</b> lest he lose Masters' love. Grimm has remained a stalwart member of the Fantastic Four for years. The Thing first fought the Hulk early in his career, with many such further clashes over the years. Not long after that, he is first reverted to <b>his</b> human <b>form,</b> but is then restored to <b>his</b> Thing <b>form</b> to battle Doctor Doom.|$|R
50|$|Chapter 1: Old Timer is {{attacked}} by Petra {{under the command}} of the Dark Lord. She is {{attacked by}} Wolfen who has transformed into <b>his</b> master <b>form.</b> As he attacks, Petra stamps him which cancels out <b>his</b> master <b>form</b> and transforms him into <b>his</b> kon <b>form.</b> Later due to Flints interference, Wolfen-kon attacks Flint. Petra is beaten by Flint, and in turn fossilizes him, his father and Getalong. Petra drops the fossil-gun in the process.|$|R
