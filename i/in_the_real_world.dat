50|$|Working titles {{for this}} story {{included}} The Daleks, The Return of the Daleks and The Invaders. The story has at times been called World's End, most notably <b>in</b> <b>the</b> frontispiece of its novelisation. This is {{the title of the}} first episode and was applied to the story as a whole by the 1973 Radio Times 10th anniversary special and several lists that copied it. <b>The</b> story begins <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>World's</b> End area of Chelsea in London.|$|R
5|$|If a human {{watched the}} dance of the elves, he would {{discover}} that even though {{only a few hours}} seemed to have passed, many years had passed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>world.</b> Humans being invited or lured to the elf dance is a common motif transferred from older Scandinavian ballads.|$|E
5|$|In the film, {{most of the}} {{numerous}} acts of violence are committed off-screen. The violent acts were also designed to be quick, reflecting the actual speed of violence <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>world.</b> The focus {{was not on the}} direct victims of the perpetuated violence, but the impact of violence on the perpetrators or witnesses to the act.|$|E
5|$|Less formally: Consider all {{possible}} (not actual) worlds {{in which you}} always choose the right. In all those, {{there will be a}} subpart of the world that says you were free to choose a certain right or wrong action, but does not say whether you chose it. If that subpart were actual (<b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>world),</b> then you'd chose the wrong.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{arrival at}} Los Angeles Airport, Cobb passes the U.S. {{immigration}} checkpoint and Professor Miles accompanies {{him to his}} home. Using his totem—a spinning top that spins indefinitely in a dream world but falls over in reality—Cobb conducts a test {{to prove that he}} is indeed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>world,</b> but he ignores its result and instead joins his children in the garden.|$|E
5|$|William and Peter safely land in Jacksonville, and Peter directs them to {{find the}} home among the {{military}} housing where Olivia stayed at as a child, marked by a red-painted door by her birth-father. Once there, Peter finds the adult Olivia waiting for him, but realizes by her eyes {{that this is not}} her. A younger Olivia reveals herself as Olivia's true ego; assured of Peter's identity, she willingly goes with him and Bell. However, they are attacked by the image of her step-father and several military personnel. Peter sacrifices himself to protect her, waking back up <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>world.</b> Olivia is able to stand up against her past fears and stops their advance. William explains that she will be able to return to possession of her body as Walter, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>world,</b> attempts to extract William's mind.|$|E

Kip later reveals that like Lioba he is dead <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>world.</b>|$|E
5|$|During a LARP, player actions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>world</b> {{represent}} character {{actions in}} an imaginary setting. Game rules, physical symbols and theatrical improvisation {{are used to}} bridge differences between {{the real world and}} the setting. For example, a rope could signify an imaginary wall. Realistic-looking weapon props and risky physical activity are sometimes discouraged or forbidden for safety reasons. While the fictional timeline in a tabletop RPG often progresses in game-time, which may be much faster or slower than the time passing for players, LARPs are different in that they usually run in real-time, with game-time only being used in special circumstances.|$|E
5|$|Experimentation {{with real}} bikes {{has so far}} {{confirmed}} the weave mode predicted by the eigenvalues. It was found that tire slip and frame flex are not important for the lateral dynamics of the bicycle in the speed range up to 6 m/s. The idealized bike model {{used to calculate the}} eigenvalues shown here does not incorporate any of the torques that real tires can generate, and so tire interaction with the pavement cannot prevent the capsize mode from becoming unstable at high speeds, as Wilson and Cossalter suggest happens <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>world.</b>|$|E
50|$|Zapped is a British sitcom, set <b>in</b> both <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>world</b> and {{a fantasy}} world, with the {{majority}} of characters and stories wholly set <b>in</b> <b>the</b> latter.

2500|$|Carina Chocano of the Los Angeles Times {{found the}} film [...] "engrossing" [...] and wrote that [...] "the {{brilliance}} of [...] {{is how it}} suggests, without bombast or fanfare, <b>the</b> ways <b>in</b> which <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>world</b> has come to resemble the dark world of comic books".|$|R
5|$|In films, the gunslinger often {{possesses}} a nearly superhuman speed and skill with the revolver. Twirling pistols, lightning draws, and trick shots are standard fare for the gunmen {{of the big}} screen. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>world,</b> however, gunmen who relied on flashy tricks and theatrics died quickly, and most gunslingers took a much more practical approach to their weapons. Real gunslingers did not shoot to disarm or to impress, but to kill.|$|E
5|$|In the episode, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) goes {{shopping}} with Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) for an engagement ring for Elisa (Hayek). Jack grows worried {{about whether he}} and Elisa's potential marriage could survive <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>world,</b> but Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) counsels him on married life. Meanwhile, Elisa tells Liz that she is keeping a secret from Jack. A prank results in an injury back at TGS and Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) {{falls in love with}} an attractive emergency medical technician (Casaubon) who comes to help.|$|E
5|$|Mulder and Scully {{find out}} that the Lone Gunmen have become trapped inside First Person Shooter, with {{somebody}} trying to kill them. Mulder enters the game, where he sees Maitreya and follows her. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>world,</b> Phoebe tearfully admits to Scully that the female warrior was created by her as a sort of personal estrogenic outlet in a testosterone-fuelled environment. Maitreya was to be contained within Phoebe's personal separate project, but the character found her way into the First Person Shooter program.|$|E
50|$|Since {{filming of}} the {{original}} season ended <b>in</b> 2002, <b>the</b> <b>Real</b> <b>World</b> suite has been host to many famous celebrities, including Britney Spears.

5|$|The Semantic Web {{uses the}} HTTP URI scheme to {{identify}} both documents and concepts <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>world,</b> a distinction {{which has caused}} confusion {{as to how to}} distinguish the two. The TAG published an e-mail in 2005 on how to solve the problem, which became known as the httpRange-14 resolution. The W3C subsequently published an Interest Group Note titled Cool URIs for the Semantic Web, which explained the use of content negotiation and the HTTP 303 response code for redirections in more detail.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the game, Henry Townshend has been locked in his apartment in South Ashfield for five days with no means of communication and having recurring nightmares. Shortly afterwards, a hole appears in the wall of his bathroom, through which he enters alternate dimensions. His first destination is an abandoned subway station, where he meets Cynthia Velázquez, a woman convinced she is dreaming and who is soon killed by an unknown man. Awakening in his apartment, he hears confirmation on his radio that she is indeed dead <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>world.</b> Similar events repeat with the next three people Henry finds: Jasper Gein; Andrew DeSalvo, a former employee of an orphanage run by Silent Hill's cult; and Richard Braintree, a resident in Henry's apartment complex. All the deaths bear similarities to the deceased serial killer Walter Sullivan's modus operandi.|$|E
5|$|Aval Appadithan {{is one of}} {{only two}} films ever {{directed}} by Rudhraiya; the other was Gramathu Athiyayam (1980). Aval Appadithan was noted for its stylish filmmaking, screenplay and dialogue, a large portion of it being in English. The dialogues were sharp and were considered almost vulgar. It also broke the style of filmmaking followed up until that time. It was the first film made by a graduate from the M.G.R. Government Film and Television Training Institute, facilitating Indian film technology students to achieve success in the film industry. Sripriya included it in her list of favourite films she had worked in. Rudhraiya's daughter, Ganga, noted that Aval Appadithan help her face life <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>world.</b>|$|E
30|$|In {{contrast}} with Virtual Reality (VR), where a complete virtual world must be created, in AR usually only virtual objects or avatars {{are added to}} <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>world</b> as <b>the</b> rest of <b>the</b> <b>world</b> is <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>world.</b> <b>In</b> this paper we focus on mobile immersive AR, which implies that a headset is worn <b>in</b> which <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>world</b> view is augmented with virtual objects.|$|R
