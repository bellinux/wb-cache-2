40|$|Tests {{show that}} trichloro- and tetrachloro- 4 -(methylsulfonyl) pyridines {{have a wide}} {{spectrum}} of activity against microorganisms causing deterioration in industrial systems. They are particularly active as <b>fungistats</b> and are more effective against gram-positive than against gram-negative bacteria. Their fungistatic activity and persistence have led to outstanding performance as mildewcides in exterior paints. In addition, we report the performance of these compounds as preservatives in the following products: asphalt, calking compositions, joint cements, paper, plastics, soluble oils (cutting fluid emulsions), and textiles...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Propionic acid (. 3 %), {{sorbic acid}} (. 3 %), and Agrosil (. 6 %) were equally {{effective}} in preventing {{the decrease in}} fat in diets containing moldy corn (the fat content of which was re-stored by soybean oil) during 25 days of storage and in completely maintaining the nutritional value of the diets as evaluated by chick performance. Lower levels of either sorbic acid (. 05 %) or Agrosil (. 1 and. 3 %) were not effective. None of the <b>fungistats</b> were able to prevent die decrease in dietary fat after storage periods longer than 50 days, but this decrease was consistently and significantly (P<. 05) slower in the propionic acid-supplemented diet.

40|$|Antifungal {{activities}} of 6 methanol extract obtain from bark. sapwood and heartwood of Syzygium chlorantha and Hopea spp. were evaluated {{against the white}} rot fungi Pycnoporus sanguineus using a medium in which homogenised hyphae were dispersed. It is observed that Hopea spp. has antifungal activity against Pycnoporus sanguineus compared to Syzygium chlorantha. Hopea spp. bark showed the highest antifungal activity against P. sanguineus with reaction showed very clear inhibition zone. Meanwhile, Hopea spp. sapwood showed partially clear inhibition zone. On the other hand, there are no antifungal activities occur at heartwood of Hopea and all parts of Syzygium chlorantha. The positive control glycyrrhizic acid dipotassium salt (GADS) showed clear inhibition zone from 50 pg to 1000 pg. The results of the sapwood and bark of Hopea spp. suggest that these extract have great potential {{as a source of}} <b>fungistats.</b> ...|$|E
40|$|A {{model is}} {{presented}} for the optimal timing of chemical sprays {{to control the}} diseases sooty blotch and flyspeck of apple. The model accounts, at a simplified level, for dynamics of disease progress, chemical inhibition of disease spread, decay of <b>fungistat,</b> cost of control, and market structure for apples. Computed sensitivities and estimated uncertainties for the key parameters are used to compute Bayes optimal control decisions as well as expected value of improved accuracy. It is concluded that the decision as to chemical treatment is logically divided into two steps: (i) {{whether or not to}} treat; (ii) level of treatment. Crop quality is the most important determinant for the first step; <b>fungistat</b> decay rate for the second. Because of asymmetries in the economic loss curves, uncertainties lead to levels of treatment considerably A model is presented for the optimal timing of chemical sprays to control the diseases sooty blotch and flyspeck of apple.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{effect of}} propionic acid and calcium {{propionate}} as mold inhibitors and heating preventors in poultry feed stored under Israeli summer conditions was studied in a com-mercial-scale study. Heating processes in untreated feed and in feed treated with calcium propionate. 5 % (w/v) started after 19 and 26 days of storage, respectively, while in feed treated with propionic acid. 3 % (w/v) heating started after 53 days. Maximum CO, levels in untreated feed and in feed treated with propionic acid or calcium propionate were 18 %, 12. 2 %, and 9 %, respectively, while fungal popula-tion density in feed {{treated with the}} propionic acid was lower than in calcium propionate-treated feed and control. Aspergillus was the dominate genus among the microfloral population isolated from the feed during storage, whereas Aspergillus candidus was the most frequent species. No afla-toxin was detected {{in any of the}} feeds. It is concluded that propionic acid is a more effective <b>fungistat</b> than calcium propionate under local summer conditions...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Gentian violet, a {{compound}} that gained wide acceptance in the poultry {{industry as a}} mold inhibitor in feed, was tested for its activity against eight aflatoxigenic strains of Aspergillus flavus and A. parasiticus. In a simple nutrient medium, it completely inhibited growth of all strains at 8 Mg/ml. When chicken feed {{was added to the}} medium, the inhibition by the same concentration ranged from 12 to 44 % depending on the strain. Observations suggested that both the feed and the fungi were involved in the resistance conferred by chicken feed. Growth and aflatoxin production on moist rice was inhibited in one strain but not in a second strain. Inoculating autoclaved chicken feed of varying moisture contents with pure cultures revealed that the activity of gentian violet was better at high moisture contents than at low moisture contents approximating those found in poultry feed. It was not possible to assess the activity of gentian violet in unaltered chicken feed. Attempts failed because the formation of reproducible levels of aflatoxin could not be attained.

40|$|In view of {{the urgency}} of {{removing}} irritants for the treatment and prevention of diaper rash, the author experimented on various disinfectants and substances assumed {{to be capable of}} inhibiting the growth of microorganisms believed to cause dermatitis of the two kinds. Their clinical application for the treatment of diaper rash was also tried. (1) Experiments on the use of OYALOX (Sodium. hypochlorite solution), a chlorine disinfectant, for the purpose of destroying urea decomposing microorganisms found in wet diapers have proved its complete efficiency in the control of these organisms. Its clinical application has also proved the efficacy of the treatment for cases of a dermatitis due to ammonia. (2) In view of an important role played by the microorganisms of the genus Candida in the intestines, multiplying in the intestines, {{in the development of a}} dermatitis due to the presence of stools, especially watery stools, in diapers, in vitro experiments on the use of pigments, naphtoquinone and its derivatives, dehydroacetic acid and various <b>fungistats</b> for their control were performed. They have proved so effective that their clinical application was tried with little success. Experiments on the antagonism between the microorganisms of the Butyric acid bacilli (Cl. Miyari) and those of the genus Candida have revealed that the former prevents the growth of. the latter, and that even the filtrate of its culture also inhibits their development. Trials with clinical application of 2 ̆ 2 Miyarisan 2 ̆ 2, its proprietary medicine, for treatment of the cases of diaper rash have proved successful in some of the casses...|$|E
40|$|Contamination {{of cereal}} {{commodities}} by moulds and mycotoxins results in dry matter, quality, and nutritional losses and represents a significant hazard {{to the food}} chain. Most grain is harvested, dried and then stored on farm or in silos for medium/long term storage. Cereal quality is influenced by a range of interacting abiotic and biotic factors. In the so-called stored grain ecosystem, factors include grain and contaminant mould respiration, insect pests, rodents and the key environmental factors of temperature, water availability and intergranular gas composition, and preservatives which are added to conserve moist grain for animal feed. Thus knowledge of the key critical control points during harvesting, drying and storage stages in the cereal production chain are essential in developing effective prevention strategies post-harvest. Studies show that very small amounts of dry matter loss due to mould activity can be tolerated. With 75 % are required to ensure that growth of mycotoxigenic moulds does not occur in partially dried grain. Sometimes, preservatives based on aliphatic acids {{have been used to}} prevent spoilage and mycotoxin contamination of stored commodities, especially feed. These are predominantly <b>fungistats</b> and {{attempts have been made to}} use alternatives such as essential oils and anti-oxidants to prevent growth and mycotoxin accumulation in partially dried grain. Interactions between spoilage and mycotoxigenic fungi and insect pests inevitably occurs in stored grain ecosystems and this can further influence contamination with mycotoxins. Effective post-harvest management of stored commodities requires clear monitoring criteria and effective implementation in relation to abiotic and biotic factors, hygiene and monitoring to ensure that mycotoxin contamination is minimised and that stored grain can proceed through the food chain for processing...|$|E
40|$|The {{additives}} and contaminants which {{occur in}} textile fibers vary widely, {{depending on the}} type of fiber and the pretreatment which it has received. Synthetic fibers such as nylon and polyester contain trace amounts of contaminants such as catalysts and catalyst deactivators which remain after the synthesis of the basic polymers. In addition, there are frequently a number of materials which are added to perform specific functions in almost all man-made fibers. Examples of these would include traces of metals or metal salts used as tracers for identification of specific lots of fiber, TiO 2 or similar materials added as delustrants, and a host of organic species added for such special purposes as antistatic agents or flame retardants. There may also be considerable quantities of residual monomer or small oligomers dissolved in the polymer matrix. The situation becomes even more complex after the fibers are converted into fabric form. Numerous materials are applied at various stages of fabric preparation to act as lubricants, sizing agents, antistats, bleaches, and wetting agents to facilitate the processing, but these are normally removed before the fabric reaches the cutters of the ultimate consumers and therefore usually do not constitute potential hazards. However, there are many other chemical agents which are frequently added during the later stages of fabric preparation and which are not designed to be removed. Aside from dyes and printing pigments, the most common additive for apparel fabrics is a durable press treatment. This generally involves the use of materials capable of crosslinking cellulosics by reacting through such functions as N-methylolated amides or related compounds such as ureas and carbamates. These materials pose some potential hazards due to both the nitrogenous bases and the formaldehyde which they usually release. There is usually also some residual catalyst in fabrics which have received such treatments. Other types of chemical treatments which are often applied to fabrics to achieve special effects include flame retardants, soil release agents, antistatic agents, softeners, water and/or oil repellents, ultraviolet absorbers, bacteriostats, and <b>fungistats...</b>|$|E
40|$|It is {{primarily}} {{used as a}} <b>fungistat</b> and as a mold and yeast inhibitor. Most applications are in post-harvest handling and processing for food preservation and extension of shelf-life (Dorko et al., 1997). Among the food uses include use as a preservative in baked goods, chocolate, soda fountain syrups, fruit cocktails, cheeses, and artificially sweetened jellies (Winters, 1989). It is also used in fruit waxes (Nelson, 1981). These handling and processing uses are not considered in this current review. There are few references to uses of potassium sorbate, sorbic acid, or other sorbic acid salts used as crop fungicides in general or seed treatments in particular. While some experiments were conducted in the late 1960 s and early 1970 s, one reference {{found in the literature}} indicates that sorbic acid and potassium sorbate are of little value for this purpose (Davis and Pinckard, 1971). More recent experiments and inventions claim that potassium sorbate is effective as a mold inhibitor with other synthetic fungicides used in tissue culture (Guri and Patel, 1998). Action: The exact mechanism by which sorbic acid and its potassium salt inhibits microbial growth is not entirely understood. No single mechanism appears to explain the range of toxicity to various spoilage organisms. Sorbic acid inhibits the transport of carbohydrates into yeast cells, inhibits oxidative and fermentative assimilation, and uncouples oxidative phosphorylation in a variety of bacteria (Dorko et al., 1997). Other mechanisms proposed appear {{to be related to the}} inability of molds to metabolize sorbic acid (Lindsay, 1996). Combinations: Potassium sorbate was petitioned to be used as a seed treatment with sodium propionate and various unspecified polymers used to coat seed (Patil, 2001). It is also used in a number of combinations for food and feed processing (Dorko et al., 1997). Citric acid can be used as a stabilizer for sorbic acid and its salts (Montagna and Lashley, 1958). Sorbic acids and its salts may have a synergistic effect with various synthetic fungicides when used in plant tissue culture media (Guri an...|$|R
