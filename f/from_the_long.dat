5|$|Egyptologist and {{archaeology}} pioneer Sir Flinders Petrie {{surveyed the}} Giant, probably during the First World War, and published his {{results in a}} Royal Anthropological Institute paper in 1926.

He concludes that the Giant is very different <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Long</b> Man of Wilmington, and that minor grooves may have been added from having been repeatedly cleaned.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{demolition}} of the tomb's chamber, some of the sarsens around the monument had been buried, while others had been left visible.

Ashbee also suspected that sarsens from this monument had been broken up for use in the repairs and extensions to the local church in the nineteenth century.

5|$|Starting <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Long</b> Depression (1873–1896), Lyonnais silk {{production}} {{had become}} totally industrialized, and hand looms were rapidly disappearing. The 19th century saw the textile industry's progress caused by advances in chemistry.

In 1884 Count Hilaire de Chardonnet invented artificial silk and in 1891 opened a factory dedicated {{to the production of}} artificial silk (viscose), which cost much less and in part replaced natural silk.|$|E
5|$|The first {{coherent}} landscaping in Hyde Park {{began in}} 1726.

The principal effect of the work was to sub-divide Hyde Park and create Kensington Gardens. The Serpentine was formed by damming the River Westbourne, which runs through the park from Kilburn towards the Thames. It is divided <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Long</b> Water by a bridge designed by George Rennie in 1826.|$|E
5|$|After the Battle of Leros, New Zealand withdrew its {{squadron}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Long</b> Range Desert Group, compelling the LRDG to reorganise {{itself into}} two squadrons of eight patrols each. A Squadron {{was composed of}} Rhodesians and B Squadron comprised British troops and a squadron of signallers; around 80 of the officers and men were from Southern Rhodesia. The group was reassigned from the Middle East Command to the Central Mediterranean Force in early 1944, and deployed to the Gargano peninsula in south-eastern Italy, where a new LRDG headquarters was set up near the seaside town of Rodi. Britain hoped to compel the Germans to commit as many divisions as possible to south-eastern Europe so {{they could not be}} used on the more important fronts closer to Germany. In June 1944 the LRDG was assigned to operate on the western coast of Yugoslavia, with orders to set up observation posts, report the movements of German ships and undertake minor raids.|$|E

5|$|Heartstrings materialized {{following}} a brief hiatus by Howling Bells, whereupon {{the band members}} worked on other projects. Additionally, Juanita became a first-time mother after giving birth. This, along with frustration <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> period of inactivity and creation inspired her and she started to write songs again, at which point she got {{the other members of}} the band involved. They made demos and sent them out to prospective producers, one being Alan Moulder (Nine Inch Nails, The Smashing Pumpkins). Moulder was busy at the time so he recommended that the band contact an assistant of his, Catherine J. Marks (Foals, The Killers), who after meeting, Howling Bells chose to produce the album.|$|E
5|$|Larger {{species of}} procellariid face similar {{problems}} to the albatrosses with long-line fisheries. These species readily take offal from fishing boats and will also steal bait <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> lines {{as they are}} being set, risking becoming snared on the hooks and drowning. In {{the case of the}} spectacled petrel this has led to the species undergoing a large decline and its listing as critically endangered. Diving species, most especially the shearwaters, are also vulnerable to gillnet fisheries. Studies of gill-net fisheries show that shearwaters (sooty and short-tailed) compose 60% of the seabirds killed by gill-nets in Japanese waters and 40% in Monterey Bay, California in the 1980s, with the total number of shearwaters killed in Japan being between 65,000 and 125,000 per annum over the same study period (1978–1981).|$|E
5|$|Rupert {{then finally}} made a {{successful}} crossing into the Caribbean, landing first at Saint Lucia, before continuing {{up the chain}} of the Antilles to the Virgin Islands. There the fleet {{was hit by a}} terrible hurricane, which scattered the ships and sank the Defiance, this time with Prince Maurice on board. It was a while before Maurice's death became certain, which came as a terrible blow to Rupert. He was forced to return to Europe, arriving in France in March 1653 with a fleet of five ships. It became clear, as the profits and losses of the piracy campaign were calculated, that the venture had not been as profitable as hoped. This complicated tensions in the Royalist court, and Charles II and Rupert eventually split the spoils, after which Rupert, tired and a little bitter, returned to France to recuperate <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> campaign.|$|E

5|$|The Long Island Transportation Plan 2000, a {{study of}} how to handle Long Island traffic issues in 2020, was started in 1997 by {{engineers}} from NYSDOT. The preferred alternative in the study would widen several parkways on the island, inserting high-occupancy vehicle lanes (HOV lanes) for buses and carpools. The Meadowbrook would receive a new HOV lane between the Southern and Northern state parkways, while everything south of the Southern State Parkway would remain the same. The Northern State Parkway would get lanes <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Long</b> Island Expressway to the Meadowbrook, and the Southern State would get lanes from the Meadowbrook to the Sunrise Highway.|$|E
5|$|The {{siege of}} Krujë in 1450 {{resulted}} in heavy loss for both Murad II and the League of Lezhë. A {{large portion of}} the Albanian land was wasted <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> campaign where the Turkish forces had been stationed {{for more than half a}} year. The country was left with few resources to produce crops and a large famine was the result. In 1451, the year after Murad's forces had devastated the country, Mehmed II gained control of the Ottoman Empire after his father's death. Mehmed's great energy was already apparent during the previous years when he had accompanied his father to Albania. Skanderbeg realized that if Mehmed struck now, he would be in great difficulty since he lacked the resources and the support to successfully hold off a large invasion. One of Albania's most powerful princedoms, the Dukagjini, were making open negotiations with the Turks, suggesting that they would become Mehmed's vassals.|$|E
5|$|Two days later, Stauffer's {{battalion}} was deployed {{into new}} blocking positions, as Viet Cong units {{were believed to}} be moving toward the Michelin Rubber Plantation. On October 11, Cavazos led two of his companies out on a northward probe, and they were immediately attacked by the Viet Cong. While under heavy fire, Cavazos ordered the lead company to pull back behind a perimeter formed by the second company. As the lead company fell back, artillery and air support were called in to pummel the Viet Cong's attacking formation. When the battle was over, 21 Viet Cong soldiers were found dead, whereas U.S. casualties for the day were 1 killed and 4 wounded. Shortly afterwards, Cavazos' battalion pulled back to Phuoc Vinh for rest and refitting. By mid-October, Hay believed the Viet Cong's 271st Regiment had suffered a major defeat and was ready to withdraw <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Long</b> Nguyen Secret Zone, so he was ready to terminate Shenandoah II. However, increased Viet Cong activity near the Ong Thanh Stream, where the 1st Brigade made most of its contacts, had indicated otherwise.|$|E

5|$|There are few contemporary, {{reliable}} sources about the battle, and most were produced by Poles. The {{most important and}} trustworthy source is Cronica conflictus Wladislai regis Poloniae cum Cruciferis anno Christi 1410, which was written {{within a year of}} the battle by an eyewitness. Its authorship is uncertain, but several candidates have been proposed: Polish deputy chancellor Mikołaj Trąba and Władysław II Jagiełło's secretary Zbigniew Oleśnicki. While the original Cronica conflictus did not survive, a short summary from the 16th century has been preserved. Another important source is Historiae Polonicae by Polish historian Jan Długosz (1415–1480). It is a comprehensive and detailed account written several decades after the battle. The reliability of this source suffers not only <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> gap between the events and the chronicle, but also Długosz's biases against the Lithuanians. Banderia Prutenorum is a mid-15th-century manuscript with images and Latin descriptions of the Teutonic battle flags captured during the battle and displayed in Wawel Cathedral and Vilnius Cathedral. Other Polish sources include two letters written by Władysław II Jagiełło to his wife Anne of Cilli and Bishop of Poznań Wojciech Jastrzębiec and letters sent by Jastrzębiec to Poles in the Holy See. German sources include a concise account in the chronicle of Johann von Posilge. A recently discovered anonymous letter, written between 1411 and 1413, provided important details on Lithuanian maneuvers.|$|E
