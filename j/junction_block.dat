40|$|Experimental {{autoimmune}} {{myasthenia gravis}} (EAM) is an autoimmune {{disease of the}} neuromuscular junction, recently induced in animals by injection of purified acetylcholine receptor (AChR) extracted from electric fish, in complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA). Rabbits (1 - 3) and monkeys (4) usually display acute muscle weaknesses and die of severe difficulties in breathing. Guinea pigs and rats (5) usually develop a mild disease, often transient, manifested clinically by hypoactivity, sinking of head, and weight loss. The experimental muscle disease may temporarily be reversed by the administration of anticholinesterase agents, and a decremental response of muscle activity to repetitive nerve stimulation can be demonstrated in electromyographic examination. Thus, EAM serves as an experimental model for the human autoimmune disease myasthenia gravis (MG) in which the same clinical, pharmacological, and electrophysiological phenomena are observed {{as a result of}} neuromuscular <b>junction</b> <b>block</b> probably due to autoimmunization toward the postsynaptic AChR.

40|$|Heptanol, 18 α-glycyrrhetinic acid (18 αGA) and 18 β-glycyrrhetinic acid (18 βGA) {{are known}} {{blockers}} of gap junctions, {{and are often}} used in vascular studies. However, actions unrelated to gap <b>junction</b> <b>block</b> have been repeatedly suggested in the literature for these compounds. We report here the findings from a comprehensive study of these compounds in the arterial wall. Rat isolated mesenteric small arteries were studied with respect to isometric tension (myography), [Ca 2 +]i (Ca 2 +-sensitive dyes), membrane potential and – {{as a measure of}} intercellular coupling – input resistance (sharp intracellular glass electrodes). Also, membrane currents (patch-clamp) were measured in isolated smooth muscle cells (SMCs). Confocal imaging was used for visualisation of [Ca 2 +]i events in single SMCs in the arterial wall. Heptanol (150 μM) activated potassium currents, hyperpolarised the membrane, inhibited the Ca 2 + current, and reduced [Ca 2 +]i and tension, but had little effect on input resistance. Only at concentrations above 200 μM did heptanol elevate input resistance, desynchronise SMCs and abolish vasomotion. 18 βGA (30 μM) not only increased input resistance and desynchronised SMCs but also had nonjunctional effects on membrane currents. 18 αGA (100 μM) had no significant effects on tension, [Ca 2 +]i, total membrane current and synchronisation in vascular smooth muscle. We conclude that in mesenteric small arteries, heptanol and 18 βGA have important nonjunctional effects at concentrations where they have little or no effect on intercellular communication. Thus, the effects of heptanol and 18 βGA on vascular function cannot be interpreted as being caused only by effects on gap junctions. 18 αGA apparently does not block communication between SMCs in these arteries, although an effect on myoendothelial gap junctions cannot be excluded...|$|E

40|$|Several {{recent studies}} have {{attributed}} the occurrence of acute myopathy {{in intensive care unit}} patients to the combination of corticosteroids and neuromuscular <b>junction</b> <b>blocking</b> agents (NMBAs) used for mechanical ventilation.

All patients had elevated creatine kinase levels. Electrophysiological studies indicated normal motor and sensory nerve conduction velocities but reduced motor nerve response amplitudes. Needle electromyography identified abnormal spontaneous activity; motor unit potentials were polyphasic of low amplitude and short duration, characteristic of a myopathic process. Muscle biopsy demonstrated a prominent acute necrotizing myopathy in all 4 patients with a loss of thick filaments. Our observations support glucocorticoids rather than NMBAs as the main offending drug in acute corticosteroid myopathy.

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} {{involved in}} altered endothelial function in obesity-related cardiovascular disease are poorly understood. This study investigates {{the effect of}} chronic obesity on endothelium-dependent vasodilation and the relative contribution of nitric oxide (NO), calcium-activated potassium channels (K Ca), and myoendothelial gap junctions (MEGJs) in the rat saphenous artery. Obesity was induced by feeding rats a cafeteria-style diet (∼ 30 kJ as fat) for 16 to 20 weeks, with this model reflecting human dietary obesity etiology. Age- and sex-matched controls received standard chow (∼ 12 kJ as fat). Endothelium-dependent vasodilation was characterized in saphenous arteries by using pressure myography with pharmacological intervention, Western blotting, immunohistochemistry, and ultrastructural techniques. In saphenous artery from control, acetylcholine (ACh) -mediated endothelium-dependent vasodilation was blocked by NO synthase and soluble guanylate cyclase inhibition, whereas in obese rats, the ACh response was less sensitive to such inhibition. Conversely, the intermediate conductance KCa (IK Ca) blocker 1 -[(2 -chlorophenyl) diphenyl-methyl]- 1 H pyrazole attenuates ACh-mediated dilation in obese, but not control, vessels. In a similar manner, putative gap <b>junction</b> <b>block</b> with carbenoxolone increased the pEC 50 for ACh in arteries from obese, but not control, rats. IK 1 protein and MEGJ expression was up-regulated in the arteries of obese rats, an observation absent in control. Addition of the small conductance KCa blocker apamin {{had no effect on}} ACh-mediated dilation in either control or obese rat vessels, consistent with unaltered SK 3 expression. Up-regulation of distinct IKCa-and gap junction-mediated pathways at myoendothelial microdomain sites, key mechanisms for endothelial-derived hyperpolarization-type activity, maintains endothelium-dependent vasodilation in diet-induced obese rat saphenous artery. Plasticity of myoendothelial coupling mechanisms represents a significant potential target for therapeutic intervention.

40|$|Myoendothelial microdomain {{signaling}} via localized calcium-activated {{potassium channel}} (KCa) and gap junction connexins (Cx) {{is critical for}} endothelium-dependent vasodilation in rat mesenteric artery. The present study determines the relative contribution of NO and gap junction-KCa mediated microdomain signaling to endothelium-dependent vasodilation in human mesenteric artery. The hypothesis tested was that such activity is due to NO and localized KCa and Cx activity. In mesenteric arteries from intestinal surgery patients, endothelium-dependent vasodilation was characterized using pressure myography with pharmacological intervention. Vessel morphology was examined using immunohistochemical and ultrastructural techniques. In vessel segments at 80 mm Hg, the intermediate (I) KCa blocker 1 -[(2 -chlorophenyl) diphenyl-methyl]- 1 H-pyrazole (TRAM- 34; 1 μM) inhibited bradykinin (0. 1 nM- 3 μM) -induced vasodilation, whereas the small (S) KCa blocker apamin (50 and 100 nM) had no effect. Direct IK Ca activation with 1 -ethyl- 2 -benzimidazolinone (1 -EBIO; 10 - 300 μM) induced vasodilation, whereas cyclohexyl-[2 -(3, 5 -dimethyl-pyrazol- 1 -yl) - 6 - methylpyrimidin- 4 -yl]-amine (1 - 30 μM), the SKCa activator, failed to dilate arteries, whereas dilation induced by 1 -EBIO (10 - 100 μM) was blocked by TRAM- 34. Bradykinin-mediated vasodilation was attenuated by putative gap <b>junction</b> <b>block</b> with carbenoxolone (100 μM), with remaining dilation blocked by N-nitro L-arginine methyl ester (100 μM) and [1 H-[1, 2, 4] oxadiazolo-[4, 3 -a]quinoxalin- 1 -one] (10 μM), NO synthase and soluble guanylate cyclase blockers, respectively. In human mesenteric artery, myoendothelial gap junction and IKCa activity are consistent with Cx 37 and IKCa microdomain expression and distribution. Data suggest that endothelium-dependent vasodilation is primarily mediated by NO, IK Ca, and gap junction Cx 37 in this vessel. Myoendothelial microdomain signaling sites are present in human mesenteric artery {{and are likely to}} contribute to endothelium-dependent vasodilation via a mechanism that is conserved between species.

40|$|Blood {{formation}} by pluripotent {{stem cells}} and their progeny {{is thought to be}} regulated by receptorligand interactions between cell-substrate, cell-cell and cell-matrix in the bone marrow. Primitive stem cells form progenitors and, in their turn, these give rise to haemopoietic progeny which are more specifically committed in that they can form progressively fewer types of blood cells. Recently we have established that direct cell-cell communication via gap junctions may be part of this regulatory system. Connexin 43 gap junctions metabolically couple the three dimensional meshwork of bone marrow stromal cells to form a functional syncytium in which some bloodforming cells are also coupled. The expression of gap junctions in the bone marrow is markedly upregulated when there is an urgent and substantial demand for blood-formation; for example, following cytotoxic injury after 5 -fluorouracil or irradiation; or during neonatal blood-formation and in the epiphysis of growing bones.
