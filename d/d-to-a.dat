40|$|AbstractMitochondrial complex I is a large, membrane-bound enzyme {{central to}} energy metabolism, and its {{dysfunction}} is implicated in cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. An interesting feature of mammalian complex I {{is the so-called}} A/D transition, when the idle enzyme spontaneously converts from the active (A) to the de-active, dormant (D) form. The A/D transition {{plays an important role}} in tissue response to ischemia and rate of the conversion can be a crucial factor determining outcome of ischemia/reperfusion. Here, we describe the effects of alkali cations on the rate of the <b>D-to-A</b> transition to define whether A/D conversion may be regulated by sodium. At neutral pH (7 – 7. 5) sodium resulted in a clear increase of rates of activation (<b>D-to-A</b> conversion) while other cations had minor effects. The stimulating effect of sodium in this pH range was not caused by an increase in ionic strength. EIPA, an inhibitor of Na+/H+ antiporters, decreased the rate of <b>D-to-A</b> conversion and sodium partially eliminated this effect of EIPA. At higher pH (> 8. 0), acceleration of the <b>D-to-A</b> conversion by sodium was abolished, and all tested cations decreased the rate of activation, probably due to the effect of ionic strength. The implications of this finding for the mechanism of complex I energy transduction and possible physiological importance of sodium stimulation of the <b>D-to-A</b> conversion at pathophysiological conditions in vivo are discussed...|$|E

40|$|Using a {{classical}} master equation that describes energy transfer over a given lattice, we explore how energy transfer efficiency {{along with the}} photon capturing ability depends on network connectivity, on transfer rates, and on volume fractions - the numbers and relative ratio of fluorescence chromophore components, e. g., donor (D), acceptor (A), and bridge (B) chromophores. For a one-dimensional AD array, the exact analytical expression for efficiency shows a steep increase with a <b>D-to-A</b> transfer rate when a spontaneous decay is sufficiently slow. This result implies that the introduction of B chromophores can be a useful method for improving efficiency for a two-component AD system with inefficient <b>D-to-A</b> transfer and slow spontaneous decay. Analysis of this one-dimensional system can be extended to higher-dimensional systems with chromophores arranged in structures such as a helical or stacked-disk rod, which models the self-assembling monomers of the tobacco mosaic virus coat protein. For the stacked-disk rod, we observe the following: (1) With spacings between sites fixed, a staggered conformation is more efficient than an eclipsed conformation. (2) For a given ratio of A and D chromophores, the uniform distribution of acceptors that minimizes the mean first passage time to acceptors is a key point to designing the optimal network for a donor-acceptor system with a relatively small <b>D-to-A</b> transfer rate. (3) For a three-component ABD system with a large B-to-A transfer rate, a key design strategy {{is to increase the}} number of the pathways in accordance with the directional energy flow from D to B to A chromophores.

40|$|Abstract—By {{interpreting}} the Green-function reproduction property of exponential splines in signal processing terms, we uncover a fundamental relation {{that connects the}} impulse responses of allpole analog filters to their discrete counterparts. The link is that the latter are the B-spline coefficients of the former (which happen to be exponential splines). Motivated by this observation, we introduce an extended family of cardinal splines—the generalized E-splines—to generalize the concept for all convolution operators with rational transfer functions. We construct the corresponding compactly supported B-spline basis functions, which are characterized by their poles and zeros, thereby establishing an interesting connection with analog filter design techniques. We investigate the properties of these new B-splines and present the corresponding signal processing calculus, which allows us to perform continuous-time operations, such as convolution, differential operators, and modulation, by simple application of the discrete version of these operators in the B-spline domain. In particular, we show how the formalism {{can be used to}} obtain exact, discrete implementations of analog filters. Finally, we apply our results to the design of hybrid signal processing systems that rely on digital filtering to compensate for the nonideal characteristics of real-world analog-to-digital (A-to-D) and <b>D-to-A</b> conversion systems.

40|$|For low-noise {{complementary}} metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) image sensors, {{the reduction}} of pixel source follower noises is becoming very important. Column-parallel high-gain readout circuits are useful for low-noise CMOS image sensors. This paper presents column-parallel high-gain signal readout circuits, correlated multiple sampling (CMS) circuits and their noise reduction effects. In the CMS, the gain of the noise cancelling {{is controlled by the}} number of samplings. It has a similar effect to that of an amplified CDS for the thermal noise but is a little more effective for 1 /f and RTS noises. Two types of the CMS with simple integration and folding integration are proposed. In the folding integration, the output signal swing is suppressed by a negative feedback using a comparator and one-bit <b>D-to-A</b> converter. The CMS circuit using the folding integration technique allows to realize a very low-noise level while maintaining a wide dynamic range. The noise reduction effects of their circuits have been investigated with a noise analysis and an implementation of a 1 Mpixel pinned photodiode CMOS image sensor. Using 16 samplings, dynamic range of 59. 4 dB and noise level of 1. 9 e- for the simple integration CMS and 75 dB and 2. 2 e- for the folding integration CMS, respectively, are obtained...|$|E
40|$|A {{method and}} {{apparatus}} for converting {{the intensity of}} an unknown optical signal (B) into an electrical signal in digital form utilizes two elongated optical attenuators (11, 13), one for the unknown optical signal from a source (10) and one for a known optical signal (A) from a variable source (12), a plurality of photodetectors (e. g., 17, 18) along each attenuator for detecting {{the intensity of the}} optical signals, and a plurality of comparators (e. g., 21) connected to the photodetectors in pairs to determine at what points being compared the attenuated known signal equals the attenuated unknown signal. The intensity of the unknown relative to the known is thus determined by the output of a particular comparator. That output is automatically encoded to a relative intensity value in digital form through a balancing feedback control (24) and encoder (23). The digital value may be converted to analog form in a <b>D-to-A</b> converter (27) and used to vary the source of the known signal so that the attenuated intensity of the known signal at a predetermined point (comparator 16) equals the attenuated intensity of the unknown signal at the predetermined point of comparison. If the known signal is then equal to the unknown, there is verification of the analog-to-digital conversion being complete. Otherwise the output of the comparator indicating equality at some other point along the attenuators will provide an output which is encoded and added, through an accumulator comprised of a register (25) and an adder (26), to a previous relative intensity value thereby to further vary the intensity of the known signal source. The steps are repeated until full conversion is verified...|$|E
