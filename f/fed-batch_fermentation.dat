40|$|Recently, <b>fed-batch</b> <b>fermentation</b> {{has been}} {{introduced}} in {{an increasing number of}} fermentation processes. Previous researches showed that <b>fed-batch</b> <b>fermentation</b> can increase the biomass yield of many strains. Improvement of the biomass yield is interested because biomass from lactic acid bacteria (LAB) fermentation is widely used in food and pharmaceutical industry. The aim of this research is to study the ability and feasibility of <b>fed-batch</b> <b>fermentation</b> to improve biomass production of LAB. Appropriate model has been selected from literature. Monod equation described the substrate limitation of LAB and the product inhibition of LAB follows a non-competitive model. Furthermore, the lactic acid production follows Luedeking and Piret model. Then the models are applied to simulate the fermentation of batch and fed-batch cultures by using MATLAB. From the results of simulation, <b>fed-batch</b> <b>fermentation</b> showed that substrate limitation and substrate inhibition can be avoided. Besides that, the variable volume <b>fed-batch</b> <b>fermentation</b> also showed that product inhibition can be eliminated by diluting the product concentration with added fresh feed. However, it was found that <b>fed-batch</b> <b>fermentation</b> is not economically feasible because large amount of substrate is required to reduce the product inhibition effect. Therefore, <b>fed-batch</b> <b>fermentation</b> plays more importance role if the fermentation strain has high Ks value or low Kp value...|$|E

30|$|Fed-batch mode {{was found}} to be {{superior}} to the batch mode of fermentation for the growth of P. acidilactici. Hence, the <b>fed-batch</b> <b>fermentation</b> of P. acidilactici was further extended with the application of in situ lactic acid removal system. Lactic acid accumulated in the culture was lower in the <b>fed-batch</b> <b>fermentation</b> with resin addition compared to <b>fed-batch</b> <b>fermentation</b> without resin addition due to the adsorption of lactic acid by the resin. The results of this study clearly shown that the in situ addition of anion-exchange resin in the <b>fed-batch</b> <b>fermentation</b> significantly helped to enhance the growth of P. acidilactici by reducing the inhibitory effect of lactic acid.|$|E

30|$|Based on {{the results}} obtained, {{application}} of <b>fed-batch</b> <b>fermentation</b> reduced the product inhibition caused by undissociated lactic acid accumulation in the culture. The improvement of cultivation performance of P. acidilactici in the constant <b>fed-batch</b> <b>fermentation</b> was achieved due to the suitable environment conditions created by this method, such as glucose concentration of below inhibitory level and low lactic acid production due to glucose metabolic flux towards cell growth instead of lactic acid production. <b>Fed-batch</b> <b>fermentation</b> {{has the advantage of}} reducing extended lag phase of low cell density in batch fermentation (Aguirre-Ezkauriatza et al. 2010). In addition, substrate exhaustion can also be assured in <b>fed-batch</b> <b>fermentation.</b> Often, the achievement of high biomass concentrations in <b>fed-batch</b> <b>fermentation</b> managed to partially overcome the strong inhibition effect of lactic acid. Results from this study showed that the application of <b>fed-batch</b> <b>fermentation</b> in cultivation of P. acidilactici has significantly reduced the accumulation of lactic acid in the culture with significant increased in the viable cell number. This finding is in agreement with the study conducted by Ming et al. (2016), who found that glucose metabolic flux towards cell growth was increased with a reduction in lactic acid production through <b>fed-batch</b> <b>fermentation</b> of Lactobacillus salivarius I 24. In past studies conducted, improvement of productivity and final yield of targeted product with shorter fermentation time in different fermentation media has been successfully achieved through the application of <b>fed-batch</b> <b>fermentation</b> (Lee et al. 2007). Approximately two times higher final cell concentration and beyond 100 % improvement in cell growth rate can be obtained by the application of <b>fed-batch</b> <b>fermentation</b> compared to batch fermentation. Besides, the application of <b>fed-batch</b> <b>fermentation</b> has also been widely applied in improving growth and biomass production of LAB such as in the production of Lactobacillus plantarum LP 02 biomass isolated from infant feces with potential cholesterol lowering ability by Hwang et al. (2011) and improvement of cell mass production of Lactobacillus delbrueckii sp. bulgaricus WICC-B- 02, a newly isolated probiotic strain from mother’s milk by Elsayed et al. (2014).|$|E

40|$|A {{combined}} predictive {{and feedback}} control algorithm based on {{measurements of the}} concentration of glucose on-line has been developed to control <b>fed-batch</b> <b>fermentations</b> of Escherichia coli. The predictive control algorithm {{was based on the}} on-line calculation of glucose demand by the culture and plotting a linear regression to the next datum point to obtain a predicted glucose demand. This provided a predictive "coarse" control for the glucose-based nutrient feed. A direct feedback control using a proportional controller, based on glucose measurements every 2 min, fine-tuned the feed rate. These combined control schemes were used to maintain glucose concentrations in <b>fed-batch</b> <b>fermentations</b> as tight as 0. 49 +/- 0. 04 g/liter during growth of E. coli to high cell densities...|$|R

In the initial phase, P. acidilactici was cultured in a batch fermentation mode with a working volume of 0.9  L until glucose was exhausted.

The temperature optimum for growth was between 50 and 53 degrees C. These aerobic, gram-positive, endospore-forming, rod-shaped bacteria required biotin and vitamin B 12 for growth.

In order {{to study the}} effect of pH on cell growth, butyric acid biosynthesis and reducing sugar consumption, different cultivation pH values ranging from 6. 0 to 7. 5 were evaluated in 5 -L bioreactor. In controlled pH batch fermentation, the optimum pH for cell growth and butyric acid production was 6. 5 with a cell yield of 3. 65 g/L and butyric acid yield of 12. 25 g/L.

Selection of efficient GFP-expressing clones, long-term production stability without selection in flasks, effects of selection, oxygen and methanol supplies, were studied during <b>fed-batch</b> <b>fermentations</b> in a 20 -l bioreactor.
