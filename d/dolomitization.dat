25|$|The {{carbonate}} minerals {{are those}} were the main anionic group is carbonate, 2−. Carbonates tend to be brittle, many have rhombohedral cleavage, and all react with acid. Due to the last characteristic, field geologists often carry dilute hydrochloric acid to distinguish carbonates from non-carbonates. The reaction of acid with carbonates, most commonly found as the polymorph calcite and aragonite (CaCO3), relates to the dissolution and precipitation of the mineral, which is a key {{in the formation of}} limestone caves, features within them such as stalactite and stalagmites, and karst landforms. Carbonates are most often formed as biogenic or chemical sediments in marine environments. The carbonate group is structurally a triangle, where a central C4+ cation is surrounded by three O2− anions; different groups of minerals form from different arrangements of these triangles. The most common carbonate mineral is calcite, and is the primary constituent of sedimentary limestone and metamorphic marble. Calcite, CaCO3, can have a high magnesium impurity; under high-Mg conditions, its polymorph aragonite will form instead; the marine geochemistry in this regard can be described as an aragonite or calcite sea, depending on which mineral preferentially forms. Dolomite is a double carbonate, with the formula CaMg(CO3)2. Secondary <b>dolomitization</b> of limestone is common, where calcite or aragonite are converted to dolomite; this reaction increases pore space (the unit cell volume of dolomite is 88% that of calcite), which can create a reservoir for oil and gas.

Rhodes transferred into the department of exploration in February 1946, and spent the rest of her career working on various exploration assignments.

Most of the dolomites in the geological record are considered to be of replacement origin, although some were precipitated directly from pore-fluids.

Its genesis remains controversial due to its complex and variable rock texture and occurrence. In this paper, through analysis of macroscopic regional geological background, microscopic rock texture, mineralogy, and geochemistry, the Ordovician dolomites in this area are divided into three types, i. e., micrite–fine-powder crystal, coarse-powder crystal, and fine (medium) crystal. It is pointed out that they were formed in three different <b>dolomitization</b> diagenetic environments, namely, penecontemporaneous <b>dolomitization</b> by evaporative pumping, mixture <b>dolomitization</b> of freshwater and magnesium-rich brine, and seepage–reflux <b>dolomitization,</b> respectively. In terms of horizon and spatial distribution, they represent the features of “strata-controlled” and “region-specific”. The analysis of genesis provides the following findings.

Second, the main pore types, i. e., dissolved pores, intercrystalline pores, and organic framework, were respectively formed in three types of dolomites.

In the Transdanubian Range, Hungary, the Upper Triassic platform carbonates are extensively distributed and numerous data are available for the space and time relations of the dolomitized and non-dolomitized units.

This paper presents the characteristic features of the dolomite types of the dolomite-bearing formations and lithofacies types, with a view to interpret the dolomite-forming processes and to determine the main controlling factors of the dolomite genesis. Petrographic features and stable isotope characteristics of the studied successions suggest the predominance of penecontemporaneous and early diagenetic dolomite genesis. Study of the transitional interval between the pervasively dolomitized and the non-dolomitized sequences revealed the general presence of microcrystalline dolomite in the peritidal microbial deposits and the characteristics of partial <b>dolomitization</b> both in the peritidal and subtidal facies. In the peritidal facies, microbially induced Ca–Mg carbonate precipitation is inferred, which was probably complemented by penecontemporaneous mimetic <b>dolomitization</b> of precursor carbonates due to evaporative pumping or seepage influx. <b>Dolomitization</b> of the subtidal facies took place via reflux of slightly evaporated seawater. <b>Dolomitization</b> of the previously deposited carbonate mud commenced during subsequent subaerial exposure but the process of early diagenetic <b>dolomitization</b> may have continued during later exposure events.
