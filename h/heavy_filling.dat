High Seebeck coefficients and low thermal conductivities are achieved in combination with large electrical conductivities in these filled skutterudites for large ZT values.

Another version of this fabric, woven in rayon or polyester-and-rayon, is called fuji.|$|R

2500|$|A severe {{earthquake}} is {{more likely}} to disable the offshore causeway portions of Interstate Highway 80 (the Eastshore Freeway), since it is built on fill placed in the 1930s atop mudflats whose upper layers were deposited in the 19th century as a result of extensive hydraulic gold mining in the distant Sierra Nevada mountain foothills. This soft mud is expected to amplify earthquake shaking, and the mud supporting the <b>heavy</b> <b>fill</b> may liquefy, and so possibly cause major disruption of the highway due to failure by sinking of the highway and by differential movement of large sections. (More modern construction for these conditions employs linked and [...] "floating" [...] – in mud – lightweight concrete and plastic foam box structures to support a road.) Similar conditions underlie the eastern approach roads to the Bay Bridge. Better, but still locally poor soils underlie the portion of Interstate Highway 880 that extends to the South Bay region from the eastern terminus of the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge. As the bulk of cargo containers from the Port of Oakland travel on these two roads, the disabling of both would cause severe disruption of West Coast import and export goods, owing to the consequent overloading of other West Coast container handling ports.|$|R

50|$|Periods of <b>heavy</b> {{rainfall}} <b>filled</b> {{the crater}} with water, causing the lake level {{to rise above}} the lowest points of the rim. Such periods are evidenced from fossils of fish found on hilltops. Water even flowed from the basin through an overflow channel. However, there were also times when the water level was so low that the rainforest entered the basin rendering the lake only a small pond. Such a period, according to legend and now proved by paleoclimate records, lasted until about 300 years ago (Shanahan et al. 2009).|$|R

40|$|Differences in {{macroscopic}} {{measurements of}} the gastrointestinal tract have been hypothesized to correlate with the browser–grazer continuum in the natural diet of ruminants. However, to what extent these characteristics represent species-specific traits, or respond to the actually ingested diet, remains to be investigated. Twelve surplus addax antelope (Addax nasomaculatus) {{were divided into two}} groups and fed, for 3 months, either their usual diet, consisting of a concentrate feed with a limited amount of hay, or a diet of unlimited hay only. After culling, macroscopic measurements were compared between groups. The macroscopic anatomy of the addax showed many characteristics considered typical for grazing or ‘cattle-type’ ruminants. While both diet groups had mesenteric, pericardial and perirenal adipose tissue, these depots were subjectively more pronounced in concentrate-fed animals. Hay-fed animals had significantly <b>heavier</b> <b>filled</b> forestomach compartments, with corresponding significantly longer linear measurements. Masseter muscles and the surface of first-order omasal leaves were significantly more prominent in hay-fed animals, reflecting possible adaptations to overcome resistance of grass forage and to reabsorb fluid from increased rumination, but differences were not as distinct as reported between ‘cattle-type’ and ‘moose-type’ ruminants. Some measurements such as reticular crests and empty foregut mass remained stable between groups, indicating possibly genetically pre-defined characteristics less prone to change in adult life. The results emphasize the adaptability of ruminant digestive tract anatomy in adult animals even after a short period of time, but also suggest limits to this adaptability that reveals a species-specific anatomy regardless of the diet actually consumed...|$|R
