50|$|Drying and {{flooding}} practices {{have been used}} for several decades as a water-saving measure, but in many cases, farmers were practicing an uncontrolled or unplanned drying and re-flooding method. Farmers were practicing ‘forced’ AWD as early as 2006 in the AMRIS region. Some water management practices and especially keeping non-flooded conditions in the rice field for short intervals are common for about  40% of rice farmers in China and more than 80% rice farmers in North-Western India and in Japan. However, nowadays farmers follow a ‘safe’ AWD in which they maintain the 15-cm subsurface water level threshold for re-flooding. This method has become a recommended practice in water-scarce irrigated rice areas in South and Southeast Asia. In the Philippines, the adoption of safe AWD started in Tarlac Province in 2002 with farmers using <b>deep-well</b> <b>pump</b> systems. The International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) has been promoting alternate wetting and drying as a smart water-saving technology for rice cultivation through national agricultural research and extension in Bangladesh, the Philippines, and Vietnam.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In {{this paper}} {{in order to}} develop high {{efficiency}} and high head <b>deep-well</b> <b>pump,</b> a L 9 (34) orthogonal experiment was performed with four factors and three values including outlet angle, outlet width, the outside diameter of impeller back shroud, etc. 9 impellers were designed. The whole flow field of new-type two-stage <b>deep-well</b> <b>pump</b> at the operating point for design was simulated by FLUENT 6. 2 using the standard model, SIMPLEC algorithm, second-order upwind scheme to solve, and analyze the independent of the number of the grid. 9 groups of the efficiency and head in design scheme were obtained. The effects of geometrical parameters on efficiency, head were researched using Latin square test method. The primary and secondary factors of the design parameters were acquired by way of variance analysis. According to the test result, an optimum program to further design was put forward. After manufactured and tested, the efficiency and head of the final optimal design models were significantly improved. The productions show good energy saving and material saving characters and could replace traditional pumps for deep well in the future, the comprehensive technical indicators achieve international advanced levels. The results would be instructive to the design method of new-type deep well pump...|$|E
40|$|To {{study the}} stress, deformation, and seepage {{pressure}} {{during the initial}} impoundment of the Jinping-I Arch Dam, monitoring analysis and numerical calculation were used in a dam behavior analysis {{that focused on the}} working behavior of the dam during the late period of the initial impoundment up to the end of November 2014. The numerical calculation was performed based on feedback analysis of the deformation and stress of the arch dam through inversion of the elastic moduli (E) of the dam body and foundation, using a three-dimensional finite element model for the linear elastic material of the arch dam. The main monitoring indices presented insignificant changes in the late period of the initial impoundment, and the results of feedback analysis were consistent with monitoring results. Analysis results also show that the deformations of the dam body and dam foundation were within the design range; the dam stress distributions were normal, with values lower than the design control criteria; and the seepage flows through the dam body and dam foundation were lower than the design drainage capacity of the <b>deep-well</b> <b>pump</b> house, demonstrating that the Jinping-I Arch Dam was in good working condition, and the initial impoundment had been successfully completed. The results of the working behavior analysis of the Jinping-I hydropower project during the initial impoundment can provide references for safe operation of similar projects...|$|E

25|$|The {{flexibility}} of rubber is appealing in hoses, tires and rollers for devices ranging from domestic clothes wringers to printing presses; its elasticity makes it suitable for {{various kinds of}} shock absorbers and for specialized machinery mountings designed to reduce vibration. Its relative gas impermeability makes it useful {{in the manufacture of}} articles such as air hoses, balloons, balls and cushions. The resistance of rubber to water and to the action of most fluid chemicals has led to its use in rainwear, diving gear, and chemical and medicinal tubing, and as a lining for storage tanks, processing equipment and railroad tank cars. Because of their electrical resistance, soft rubber goods are used as insulation and for protective gloves, shoes and blankets; hard rubber is used for articles such as telephone housings, parts for radio sets, meters and other electrical instruments. The coefficient of friction of rubber, which is high on dry surfaces and low on wet surfaces, leads to its use for power-transmission belting and for water-lubricated bearings in <b>deep-well</b> <b>pumps.</b> Indian rubber balls or lacrosse balls are made of rubber.|$|R
40|$|The Bangkok subsoil {{that forms}} {{part of the}} larger Chao Phraya Plain {{consists}} of a broad basin filled with sedimen-tary soil deposits that form alternate layers of sand, gravel and clay. The depth of the bedrock is still undetermined, but its level in the Bangkok area is known to vary between 400 m and 1800 m deep. The aquifer system beneath the city area is very complex, and the <b>deep-well</b> <b>pumping</b> from the aquifers over the last 50 years or so has caused substantial piezometric drawdown in the upper soft and highly compressible clay layer. In this paper, the influence of the piezometric drawdown on the performance of vertical drains with surcharge on the upper clay layer is examined. Instrumented test embankments were built and the performance of large-diameter sand drains, sand wicks and prefabricated vertical drains was examined. A novel interpretation technique was adopted to evaluate the settlements from pore pressure dissipation and to compare with those measured directly from settlement measurements.

40|$|An {{airscrew}} windmill {{has been}} designed {{for use in the}} north east trade wind regime of the Caribbean, which is shown to be particularly favourable for agricultural irrigation purposes. The high-speed fixed-pitch airscrew incorporates the most recent aerodynamic theory and is manufactured from fibre-glass reinforced epoxy resin. To compete with conventional prime movers high efficiency, low cost and long life are maintained by the use of standard industrial and automotive transmission components. The strength of the blades and supporting structure has been confirmed by structural proof tests. Field tests, in which the windmill was connected to a standard <b>deep-well</b> turbine <b>pump</b> for sprinkler irrigation, have been made to determine the aerodynamic integrity of the airscrew design.

40|$|Many {{existing}} <b>deep-well</b> water <b>pumping</b> {{technologies that}} are affordable to developing world smallholders suffer from reliability issues, low efficiency and/or expensive running costs. The Double-Acting Hydraulic Ram Pump (DAHR) {{has the potential to}} address these problems. An evolution of the classic hydraulic ram pump that converts kinetic energy from free-flowing water sources into a reduced flow at a much higher head, the DAHR contains virtually no moving parts or dynamic seals. The result is a deep-lift technology that can be both highly efficient and extremely reliable. This thesis investigates the potential of the DAHR, taking an initial proof-of-concept rig to a design that is ready for outdoor field trials. The beta prototype design process has been aided considerably by the development of a suite of numerical models. Like the conventional hydraulic ram, the DAHR has clearly defined acceleration and delivery phases either side of an impact event. The fluid motion during acceleration is modelled using a 1 D lumped element approach whereas the delivery phase modelling is based on the shock equations for both compression and rarefaction waves. Unlike the conventional hydraulic ram, the DAHR makes full use of the kinetic energy downstream of the impact. The numerical results facilitate the selection of drive pipe diameter, inlet/delivery valves and the choice of pipe material via the resulting sound speed. A 15 m tall test facility housed within a three storey public stairwell was set up to help simulate pumping from deep underground. The DAHR sitting in a tank at the bottom would lift water {{to the top of the}} stairwell before it was returned under gravity to complete the circuit. The driving power input to create the low pressure, high volume oscillatory flow within the DAHR U-tube is provided by two custom-made pneumatic fluidynes. The data acquired over several weeks of testing with three different plastic drive pipe materials required an automated post-processing routine capable of analysing DAHR performance impact-by-impact. Computed efficiencies of up to 75 percent were achieved while pumping 350 L/h at 32 m head. Experimental observations also showed good agreement with numerical modelling. A single-acting design, capable of fitting down a smaller borehole, was considered as an alternative way forward. A further prototype, with the second drive pipe replaced by a gas spring, was designed, built and tested in the same facility. The prototype proved substantially more difficult to control and estimated efficiency was approximately half that of the DAHR validating the original double-acting approach. </p...|$|R
