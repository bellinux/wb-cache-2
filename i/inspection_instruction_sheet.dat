The textual, visual, and procedural elements of Trivial Pursuit <b>instruction</b> <b>sheets</b> published between 1984 and 2009 revealed a series of revisions that accounted for sociocultural and historical contexts.

40|$|It 2 ̆ 7 s easy to {{overlook}} the persuasive strategies used in board game <b>instructions.</b> An <b>instruction</b> <b>sheet</b> serves so many practical purposes, after all, that something like clarity might seem a more immediate and sensible metric for assessment. The {{same is true of}} assignment sheets in the post-secondary academic setting. Like board game <b>instructions,</b> assignment <b>sheets</b> outline a process for an intended audience to complete. Easy-to-follow instructions are great. Dense instructions are a chore. But the language of board game <b>instructions</b> and assignment <b>sheets</b> can sustain a more critical approach. What are the implicit arguments made by <b>instruction</b> <b>sheets</b> and the processes they describe? Are those arguments rhetorically persuasive? Are the intended audiences addressed as static participants or individuals with agency? Through a rhetorical analysis of Trivial Pursuit board game instructions, this project presents a practical schema for persuasive process design in academic assignment sheets. A key aspect of persuasive process design, particularly in the pedagogical context, is the acknowledgment of student agency. That is, the opportunity for intellectual curiosity and self-directed learning. I argue that the traditional language of assignment sheets often communicates restrictive processes that subordinate participants and, therefore, inhibit student agency. Early Trivial Pursuit instructions exhibit similar shortcomings. However, due to its reliance on pop culture, Trivial Pursuit has had to continuously revise <b>instruction</b> <b>sheets</b> in order to persuade contemporary audiences. I explore the persuasive strategies used in 30 years’ worth of Trivial Pursuit instructions, and consider how this history might inform the design of academic assignment prompts...|$|R

40|$|Objective: {{the aim of}} this {{research}} was to verify the level of usefulness of the printed <b>instruction</b> <b>sheets</b> in the management of patients suffering from allergic contact dermatitis. We have estimated the level of knowledge and long term memory of the patients, concerning the pieces of information contained in the printed instructions. We wanted to establish if patients derived any improvement in symptoms by following the rules written in the instructions. Materials and methods: we started our research by asking 400 randomly selected patients, from the Italian cities of Naples, Catania, Ferrara and Verona to fill in a questionnaire. Patients were asked several questions concerning the usefulness of the printed instructions, how often they consulted them and if their compliance helped improve their condition. Results: about 75 % of the patients considered the printed instructions useful; by observing the instructions regularly they reported improvements {{in the course of their}} disease. Some pieces of information concerning the objects and the materials to avoid, for example, have remained the same for 5 years, since the printed instructions were first received. We noted that the categories who remembered less information were older people and, above all, patients who were socially disadvantaged. Conclusions: the printed <b>instruction</b> <b>sheets</b> were useful for the majority of the patients, who derived satisfactory benefits from observing them; therefore we recommend that all physicians use this means of communication to give information. The language in the <b>instruction</b> <b>sheets</b> should be used friendly to make it accessible to people from all social groups...|$|R
