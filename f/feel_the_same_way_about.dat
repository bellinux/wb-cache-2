During the game, when Charles kicks the ball towards Jim, he ducks and the ball hits Phyllis (Phyllis Smith) in the face. Charles berates Jim for ducking, and Dwight mocks him.|$|E
500|$|Shinoda {{was greatly}} {{inspired}} by both rock and hip-hop acts {{when he was}} a child. He grew up listening to Boogie Down Productions, Public Enemy, N.W.A, and Juice Crew, and later Nine Inch Nails, Deftones, The Roots and Aphex Twin. Other influences and favorites of Shinoda's include Led Zeppelin, Run–D.M.C., The Beatles, Rage Against the Machine, Purity Ring, Arctic Monkeys and Santigold. In an interview with Rolling Stone, Shinoda explained, [...] "People just want junk food. They want throw-away junk food music that's going to make them lethargic and fat. We <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way</b> <b>about</b> music. We want to hopefully move even more into being able to make more substantial music. We're definitely paying attention to the substance and the nuance, and we hope to make something that's really cutting edge and really different." ...|$|E

Billis plays Honey Bun, dressed in a blond wig, grass skirt and coconut-shell bra. After the show, Emile asks Nellie to reconsider. She insists that she cannot <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way</b> <b>about</b> him since she knows about his children's Polynesian mother. [...] Frustrated and uncomprehending, Emile asks Cable why he and Nellie have such prejudices. Cable, filled with self-loathing, replies that [...] "it's not something you're born with", yet it is an ingrained part of their upbringing ("You've Got to Be Carefully Taught"). He also vows that if {{he gets out of}} the war alive, he won't go home to the United States; everything he wants is on these islands. Emile imagines what might have been ("This Nearly Was Mine"). Dejected and feeling that he has nothing to lose, he agrees to join Cable on his dangerous mission.|$|E

500|$|She {{has played}} with Robyn Maher, Michelle Timms and Shelley Gorman. [...] Jackson admires them. [...] They all won bronze medals at the 1996 Summer Olympics. Jackson had a rivalry with American {{basketball}} player Lisa Leslie. [...] Both women dislike each other, a dislike {{that goes back}} to when Jackson was on tour in the United States with the Opals as a 16-year-old. The rivalry intensified in 2000 at the Olympics in the gold medal match when Jackson accidentally pulled off Leslie's hair extension when Jackson was trying to grab a rebound. [...] Jackson treated the incident as a joke, saying [...] "It was something to joke about even though we lost the gold medal." [...] Leslie did not <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way</b> <b>about</b> the extension pulling incident. [...] The rivalry continued when Jackson transitioned to the WNBA and her Seattle Storm team played Leslie's Los Angeles Sparks, who at the time were {{the best team in the}} league. [...] The rivalry was so intense that their coaches had to coach around it, sometimes choosing to keep one off the floor when the other was on. [...] The coaches feared if they left the players on the floor together, their own player would foul out in an attempt to get the best of the other player. [...] Leslie and Jackson have played together as team members in the WNBA's All-Star game. [...] Their relationship thawed some by 2007 but they did not become friends.|$|E

One night, Tom gets into a fight with a man who tries to pick up Summer in a bar, which causes their first argument.

In [...] "The Damage You've Done", Grayson and Laurie decide to tell Jules that they had slept together in season 1, leaving Jules angry at Laurie, who had known that she was attracted to Grayson.

Later in the season, Laurie rediscovers her love of partying and one-night stands. After Bobby helps Stan get into a great preschool, Andy and Ellie reverse their previous decision to revoke his title as Stan's emergency legal guardian {{in the event of}} Jules, Andy, and Ellie's deaths. Travis begins college, making friends with his roommate Kevin and starting to date a slightly older girl named Kirsten.

Finally, he impulsively moves to Hawaii and gets a job cleaning surfboards, forcing everyone else to follow him.

6000|$|So {{it seemed}} to him in those flaccid moods to which Hilbrook's visits left him, when mind and body were both spent in the effort he had been making. In the {{intervals}} in which his strength renewed itself, he put this fear from him as a hypochondriacal fancy, and he summoned a cheerfulness which he felt less and less to meet the hopeful face of the old man. Hilbrook had renewed himself, apparently, in the measure that the minister had aged and waned. He looked, to Ewbert, younger and stronger. To the conventional question how he did, he one night answered that he never felt better in his life. [...] "But you," [...] he said, casting an eye over the face and figure of the minister, who lay back in his easy-chair, with his hands stretched nerveless on the arms, [...] "you, look rather peaked.

There is Downy the Woodpecker hard at work on a new house this very minute. That's good. I like to see that. It means that next year there will be one more house for some one here in the Old Orchard. For myself I prefer old houses. I've noticed there are a number of my neighbors who <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way</b> <b>about</b> it. There is {{something}} settled about an old house. It doesn't attract attention the way a new one does. So long as it has got reasonably good walls, and the rain and the wind can't get in, the older it is the better it suits me. But the Woodpeckers seem to like new houses best, which, as I said before, is a very good thing for the rest of us." ...|$|E
