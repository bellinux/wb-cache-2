40|$|Generally speaking, practitioners, jurists, professors, legislators, and {{students}} desire certainty in the law. For {{those interested in}} the law of municipal corporations in Georgia, however, that search for certainty is frequently frustrating, if not impossible. In his Article, Professor Sentell points {{to a number of}} Georgia constitutional and statutory rules which, when read with the interpretations of these provisions by the Georgia courts, generate uncertainty and confusion for one confronted with a question in municipal corporation law. The discussion begins {{with a look at the}} <b>definitional</b> <b>uncertainty</b> of what is a municipal corporation under Georgia law, turns next to an analysis of assorted statutory and constitutional problems engendered by the provisions themselves and by the case law interpretations of those provisions, and concludes with an inquiry as to who composes the governing councils of municipal corporations...|$|E
40|$|Chimpanzee Cultures is an edited volume {{based on}} the work of many well known {{researchers}} including de Waal, Goodall, McGrew, and Wrangham who have all spent decades studying chimpanzees. The work summarizes material presented at two conferences allowing material from wild and captive studies to be integrated and assessed. As the title of the book suggests this work is focussed on those aspects of chimpanzee life which can be considered cultural. How much learning is involved in acquiring the ability to perform various behaviours? Do chimpanzees really ‘teach ’ their young? How does learning occur? How much variability is there between populations in terms of diet, social signals and the intricacies of tool use? In order to deal with these types of questions the writers must also deal with the <b>definitional</b> <b>uncertainty</b> of what actually constitutes culture. Is culture a uniquely human characteristic? Most chimpanzee researchers argue that social learning is such an important part of becoming a functioning chimpanzee (as determined by the disastrous results of captive deprivation experiments) that the behavioural differences between groups can be classified as cultural. The potential for suc...|$|E
30|$|Partly {{owing to}} this long-standing dearth of {{theoretical}} work, {{the definition of}} “non-cognitive skills”, {{as well as their}} relation to cognitive skills, remain rather vague. The termis meant as a catchphrase describing a broad range of potentially relevant skills other than the “cognitive skills” measured by standardized achievement and IQ tests. So far, however, researchers have not reached any clear consensus as to which specific skills should be included under this umbrella term. In the absence of a clear definition, most extant surveys have included those non-cognitive skills that promised {{to be related to the}} central outcomes of interest in these surveys. Thus, the set of constructs mostly follows the specific intention of the study in question. Despite this <b>definitional</b> <b>uncertainty,</b> nearly all of these surveys have included the major dimensions of personality, the so-called Big Five. The Big Five aim to describe an individual’s personality on the most global level with five largely independent dimensions (De Raad 2000; Goldberg 1990; John et al. 2008). These dimensions are extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, emotional stability, and openness to experience. Also within the above-mentioned expert group charged with identifying the most central non-cognitive skills to be included in the PIAAC study, the only point on which a clear consensus has been reached is that the Big Five personality dimensions should be included.|$|E

40|$|Constitutional {{scholars}} have long debated {{the relative merits}} of a conduct-based compulsory joinder rule. The dialogue has centered on the meaning of the “same offence” language of the Double Jeopardy Clause, concentrating specifically on whether it includes the factual circumstances giving rise to criminal liability or applies only to the statutory offenses charged. However, the Supreme Court, in United States v. Dixon, abandoned as “unworkable” a limited conduct-based approach it had fashioned just three years before in Grady v. Corbin. This Article does not assess the frequency with which federal authorities prosecute joinable offenses separately. While such information ultimately is necessary to determine the absolute dollar costs of repeat prosecution, this Article concentrates on the opportunities to abuse power that the current approach leaves open to federal prosecutors. In addition, this Article does not precisely define the “transaction rule. ” The purpose of this Article is not to offer yet another definition of the criminal transaction but to explore the implications of imposing any compulsory joinder requirement on the federal system. Thus, the “transaction rule” discussed herein generically denotes a factually-driven joinder requirement that might range in scope from the conduct formula embraced in Grady v. Corbin to a sweeping mandate that prosecutors include all joinable offenses “which substantially overlap” in a single indictment. This Article revisits the “transaction” rule debate {{in the context of a}} hypothetical statutory joinder requirement for the federal system. Section II considers the sources of repeat prosecution in the federal arena, the impact of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines on prosecutorial charging behavior, and the costs traditionally attributed to successive prosecution. Section III examines the arguments in favor of and against a statutorily-imposed compulsory joinder approach, questioning whether either the <b>definitional</b> <b>uncertainties</b> of a transaction rule or the political benefits of the current approach are worth the individual and systemic costs inherent in an unchecked reprosecution power. Section IV offers preliminary observations on issues that must be resolved if compulsory joinder of any variety is to succeed in the federal environment...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Efficiency {{and equity}} are both {{important}} policy objectives in resource allocation. The discipline of health economics has traditionally focused on maximising efficiency, however addressing inequities in health also requires consideration. Methods to incorporate equity within economic evaluation techniques range from qualitative judgements to quantitative outcomes-based equity weights. Yet, due to <b>definitional</b> <b>uncertainties</b> and other inherent limitations, no method has been universally adopted to date. This paper proposes an alternative cost-based equity weight {{for use in}} the economic evaluation of interventions delivered from primary health care services. Methods Equity is defined in terms of 'access' to health services, with the vertical equity objective to achieve 'equitable access for unequal need'. Using the Australian Indigenous population as an illustrative case study, the magnitude of the equity weight is constructed using the ratio of the costs of providing specific interventions via Indigenous primary health care services compared with the costs of the same interventions delivered via mainstream services. Applying this weight to the costs of subsequent interventions deflates the costs of provision via Indigenous health services, and thus makes comparisons with mainstream more equitable when applied during economic evaluation. Results Based on achieving 'equitable access', existing measures of health inequity are suitable for establishing 'need', however the magnitude of health inequity is not necessarily proportional to the magnitude of resources required to redress it. Rather, equitable access may be better measured using appropriate methods of health service delivery for the target group. 'Equity of access' also suggests a focus on the processes of providing equitable health care rather than on outcomes, and therefore supports application of equity weights to the cost side rather than the outcomes side of the economic equation. Conclusion Cost-based weights have the potential to provide a pragmatic method of equity weight construction which is both understandable to policy makers and sensitive to the needs of target groups. It could improve the evidence base for resource allocation decisions, and be generalised to other disadvantaged groups who share similar concepts of equity. Development of this decision-making tool represents a potentially important avenue for further health economics research. </p...|$|R
40|$|Alexithymia is an {{important}} mental health construct, but there is continuing debate regarding its definition and measurement. We attempt to resolve this <b>definitional</b> <b>uncertainty</b> in two ways. Firstly, we trace {{the development of the}} alexithymia construct, focusing particularly on what we call the Toronto and Amsterdam models, and examine a body of empirical research that shows strong support for the hypothesis that alexithymia consists of three components (difficulty identifying feelings, difficulty describing feelings, and externally orientated thinking). Based on these components, we formulate an alternate theoretical model of alexithymia, the attention-appraisal model of alexithymia, that aligns alexithymia theory with recent advances in the broader emotion regulation field. Secondly, we examine the construct 2 ̆ 7 s latent structure by factor analysing data from multiple psychometric measures administered to a community sample (N = 368). Our results suggest statistical support for our model, rather than the Toronto or Amsterdam models. We end by discussing how our model accounts for several unresolved issues within the alexithymia field, including the construct 2 ̆ 7 s relation to imaginal capacities and emotional reactivity, whether alexithymia is a deficit or a defence, how it might be addressed in psychiatric treatment, and the discordance that has existed between alexithymia theory and alexithymia measurement.

40|$|Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart once {{authored}} a {{concurring opinion}} {{in which he}} explained that, while he would not attempt to delineate pornographic materials, he knew pornography when he saw it. Likewise, {{in the field of}} insider trading, the courts and others have embraced such pragmatism, namely, effectively transforming the test for identifying insider trading (trading while aware of 2 ̆ 2 material 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 nonpublic 2 ̆ 2 information) to a weighing of such considerations as whether the defendant had access to insiders, betrayed a confidence, and/or captured a profit. Such a pornography test approach - while satisfying on some level of expedience - fails to provide businesses with certainty, the law with clarity, the market with confidence, and the layman with guidance. Meanwhile, the definitional term 2 ̆ 2 non-public 2 ̆ 2 is reduced to a shibboleth, the mere utterance of which triggers insider trading investigations, cases, penalties, and press. The Securities and Exchange Commission has survived attacks on such <b>definitional</b> <b>uncertainty</b> (while garnering a fair share of headlines) by bringing enforcement actions showcasing exorbitant profits, salient boardroom details, indefensible criminal acts and aristocratic defendants. Nonetheless, the dirty little secret of the 2 ̆ 2 material, non-public information 2 ̆ 2 definition of insider trading is that the 2 ̆ 2 non-public 2 ̆ 2 half lacks clarity and consistent application - indeed, it may not truly exist at all. Consequently, the Commission 2 ̆ 7 s winsome approach is destined to win some and lose some, as the courts increasingly rule for defendants in cases relying on definitional vagaries or unprecedented application of the prohibition. This Article thus urges the Commission to abandon its totality of the circumstances approach (as well as its lip service to the term 2 ̆ 2 nonpublic 2 ̆ 2 as a separate definitional element) in favor of a well-defined, two-tier standard in insider trading cases...|$|E
40|$|The nation-state’s {{struggle}} with liberal individualism {{on the one}} hand and the recognition of group rights on the other is well documented in the literatures on constitutionalism, constitution-making, comparative politics and racial/ethnic relations. However, the manner in which this conundrum manifests in a state’s acceptance or rejection of affirmative action has been under-discussed. Traditional approaches to the study of affirmative action are inadequate because they tend to circumscribe the universe of policies and programs that may qualify as affirmative action by focusing only on certain groups, issue domains or countries. More specifically, current scholarship on affirmative action suffers from several substantive and methodological shortcomings: (1) a neglect of the constitutional foundations of affirmative action, (2) a fundamental <b>definitional</b> <b>uncertainty</b> when it comes to understanding what affirmative action actually is, (3) a lack of a clear analytical framework with which to classify various types of affirmative action policies, (4) a narrow focus on single-case studies, and (5) a paucity of inter-group and intra-group comparisons. To address these lacunae, this study focuses on constitutional precommitments to affirmative action. Prior to any substantive analysis, this study first proposes a consensus definition of affirmative action and develops a universal typology and sub-typology with which to categorize, analyze and compare affirmative action precommitments. Next, this study employs a large N comparative methodology to examine the constitutions of 30 countries and categorize affirmative action precommitments through the use of constitutional textual analysis and secondary source historical materials. Finally, this study compares affirmative action precommitments – both inter-group and intra-group – for racial/ethnic minorities and women across the sample. There are three principal substantive findings. First, although liberal individualism remains central to the constitution-making process, all cases exhibited constitutional acknowledgement of some form of group rights and/or preferences. Second, for various reasons, racial/ethnic minorities tend to fare better than women when it comes to the overall prevalence of preferential constitutional precommitments. Third, historical evidence suggests that both endogenous and exogenous political pressures, such as internal ethnic conflicts and global human rights movements, matter when it comes to racial/ethnic minorities’ or women’s chances of having affirmative action provisions included in constitutions during the constitution-making process. ...|$|E
