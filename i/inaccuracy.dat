5|$|Factories, {{ports and}} other {{strategic}} sites {{used by the}} German war effort were frequent targets of Allied bombers from both the British Royal Air Force (RAF) and American United States Army Air Forces (USAAF).

The present paper argues that this approach is not reasonable for modeling <b>inaccuracies</b> in concepts that are infinite in nature (for example, graphs of computable functions).

5|$|In 1984, Australia's Network Ten {{produced}} a television mini-series titled Bodyline, dramatising {{the events of}} the 1932–33 English tour of Australia. It starred Gary Sweet as Don Bradman, Hugo Weaving as Douglas Jardine, Jim Holt as Harold Larwood, Rhys McConnochie as Pelham Warner, and Frank Thring as Jardine's mentor Lord Harris. The series took some liberties with historical accuracy for the sake of drama, including a depiction of angry Australian fans burning a British flag at the Sydney Cricket Ground, an event which was never documented. Larwood, having emigrated to Australia in 1950, received several threatening and obscene phone calls after the series aired. The series was widely and strongly attacked by the surviving players for its <b>inaccuracy</b> and sensationalism.|$|E
5|$|Steve Jobs premiered at the 2015 Telluride Film Festival on September 5, 2015, {{and began}} a limited release in New York City and Los Angeles on October 9, 2015. It opened {{nationwide}} in the U.S. on October 23, 2015, to critical acclaim. Individuals close to Jobs such as Steve Wozniak and John Sculley would praise the film's performances, but the film also received criticisms for its <b>inaccuracy</b> in some of its scenes. Winslet won a Golden Globe and a BAFTA Award for Best Supporting Actress and Sorkin won the Golden Globe Award for Best Screenplay at the 73rd Golden Globes, while Fassbender and Winslet received nominations for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actress, respectively, at the 88th Academy Awards.|$|E
5|$|By 08:00, it {{was clear}} that despite his vessels speed, Stewart's plan was going to fail: the captains of Charlton and United Kingdom had not even {{attempted}} to join his advance, deliberately checking their advance towards the French, falling far behind Windham. Although Stewart now faced overwhelming odds, he had no option but to continue the attack: his ship was now too close to attempt to flee from the French frigate. Captain Dornal de Guy opened fire at 09:30, his shot repeatedly striking Windham as she approached. Stewart did not return fire, instead waiting until his ship was closer to minimise the <b>inaccuracy</b> of his gunnery. Unable to reach the more nimble French ship directly, Stewart absorbed the French fire until he was as close as he was able before unleashing his guns. The results were disappointing: the entire broadside splashed into the sea far short of the French ship. The more manoeuvrable Manche now approached Windham at close range, and the two ships fired at one another for over an hour, Stewart still unsupported by his companions, who did no more than fire the occasional ineffective shot at extreme range.|$|E

40|$|AIMS: To audit wording and {{formulation}} <b>inaccuracies</b> in certifying {{the cause}} of death. METHODS: Five hundred causes of death were analysed from the counterfoils of medical death certificates (Form 66). Wording and formulation <b>inaccuracies</b> were defined as terms contrary to the notes given to doctors in books on death certificates. RESULTS: One or more <b>inaccuracies</b> were identified in 29 % of cases. In 5. 8 % of cases, the <b>inaccuracies</b> were sufficiently serious to warrant further action or enquiry by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, including referral to Her Majesty's Coroner. CONCLUSIONS: Most <b>inaccuracies</b> {{could have been avoided}} by adhering to the notes for medical practitioners contained in books of death certificates. The wording and formulation of causes of death warrants special prominence in under-graduate and postgraduate medical education. The topic should be audited and medical practitioners should pay particular attention to cases worthy of referral to HM Coroner...|$|R
5|$|In 1955, von Neumann {{became a}} {{commissioner}} of the AEC. He accepted this position {{and used it to}} further the production of compact hydrogen bombs suitable for Intercontinental ballistic missile delivery. He involved himself in correcting the severe shortage of tritium and lithium 6 needed for these compact weapons, and he argued against settling for the intermediate range missiles that the Army wanted. He was adamant that H-bombs delivered into the heart of enemy territory by an ICBM would be the most effective weapon possible, and that the relative <b>inaccuracy</b> of the missile wouldn't be a problem with an H-bomb. He said the Russians would probably be building a similar weapon system, {{which turned out to be}} the case. Despite his disagreement with Oppenheimer over the need for a crash program to develop the hydrogen bomb, he testified on the latter's behalf at the 1954 Oppenheimer security hearing, at which he asserted that Oppenheimer was loyal, and praised him for his helpfulness once the program went ahead.|$|E
5|$|Mythology and {{folklore}} often {{exaggerate the}} skills of famous gunfighters. Most of these historical figures were not known {{to be capable of}} trick shooting, nor did they necessarily have a reputation for precision sharpshooting. Such tropes that are frequently seen in Westerns include shooting the center of a coin, stylistic pistol twirling, glancing shots that intentionally only graze an opponent (the bullet through the hat being an example), shooting an opponent's belt buckle (thus dropping his pants), a bullet cutting the hangman's rope, or shooting the guns out of opponents' hands (typically as an alternative to killing). The latter was debunked by Mythbusters as an impossibility, as unjacketed bullets tend to shatter into fragments that can hurt or even kill. Ed McGivern dispelled the myth of the <b>inaccuracy</b> of pistol fanning by shooting tight groups while fanning the revolver.|$|E
5|$|Once a human-only {{endeavor}} based mainly upon {{changes in}} barometric pressure, current weather conditions, and sky condition, weather forecasting now relies on computer-based models that take many atmospheric factors into account. Human input is still required {{to pick the}} best possible forecast model to base the forecast upon, which involves pattern recognition skills, teleconnections, knowledge of model performance, and knowledge of model biases. The <b>inaccuracy</b> of forecasting {{is due to the}} chaotic nature of the atmosphere, the massive computational power required to solve the equations that describe the atmosphere, the error involved in measuring the initial conditions, and an incomplete understanding of atmospheric processes. Hence, forecasts become less accurate as the difference between current time and the time for which the forecast is being made (the range of the forecast) increases. The use of ensembles and model consensus help narrow the error and pick the most likely outcome.|$|E

40|$|We {{aimed to}} audit nosological <b>inaccuracies</b> in death {{certification}} in Northern Ireland and to compare performance of hospital doctors and general practitioners. Nosology is {{the branch of}} medicine which treats of the classification of disease. 1138 deaths were registered in Northern Ireland in a 4 -week period commencing 3 / 10 / 94. 195 of these were either registered by HM Coroners (HMC) or required further investigation by their staff; these cases {{were excluded from the}} study. The remaining 943 were analysed for wording and formulation <b>inaccuracies</b> according to the revised notes (1974), Northern Ireland Medical Certificate of Cause of Death. These are issued in book form by the Registrar of Births and Deaths. The commonest <b>inaccuracies</b> in death certification occur in the areas of poor terminology, sequence errors and unqualified mode. One or more <b>inaccuracies</b> were found in 317 (33. 6 %) of cases. In 13 of these (4 %) cases, the <b>inaccuracies</b> were serious enough to warrant referral by the Registrar of Deaths to HM Coroner. The numbers of general practitioners and hospital doctors were recorded, with general practitioners being responsible for 122 (38 %) and hospital doctors being responsible for 195 (62 %) of <b>inaccuracies...</b>|$|R

5|$|The Madagascan sunset moth {{was first}} {{described}} by the British entomologist Dru Drury in 1773 from a specimen obtained from a Captain May of Hammersmith. Because of its resemblance to swallowtail butterflies, Drury described the species as Papilio rhipheus. The specimen Drury received had {{the head of a}} different species attached, probably that of a butterfly, which had clubbed antennae—this trait is frequently used to differentiate moths from butterflies. Once the <b>inaccuracy</b> in Drury's specimen was found, the moth was placed in the genus Urania, until 1823 when the German entomologist Jacob Hübner placed it in a new genus, Chrysiridia. The moth has also been described under other names. Because Drury described his specimen as having clubbed antennae and being tailless, William Swainson thought it was a different species than the complete specimen described by Cramer. In 1833, Swainson named the butterfly Rhipheus dasycephalus and the moth Leilus orientalis. Other synonyms include U. crameri by Maassen in 1879 and U. ripheus var. madagascariensis by Lesson in 1831.|$|E
5|$|The Utah beach landings, however, were {{relatively}} uncontested, with assault units landing on largely unoccupied beaches and experiencing far less action than the landings at Omaha. The filmmakers chose {{to begin the}} narrative with a depiction of the more dramatic story of Omaha, despite the strategic <b>inaccuracy</b> of an impossible mission that {{could easily have been}} pursued from the other beach area. In addition, one of the most notable of the operational flaws is the depiction of the 2nd SS Panzer Division Das Reich as the adversary during the fictional Battle of Ramelle. The 2nd SS was not engaged in Normandy until July, and then at Caen against the British and Canadians, 100 miles east. Furthermore, the Merderet River bridges were not an objective of the 101st Airborne Division but of the 82nd Airborne Division, part of Mission Boston.|$|E
5|$|The 513th Parachute Infantry Regiment was {{the second}} American {{airborne}} unit to land after the 507th, {{under the command of}} Colonel James Coutts. En route to the drop zone, the transport aircraft carrying the 513th had the misfortune to pass through a belt of German antiaircraft weapons, losing 22 of the C-46 transport aircraft and damaging a further 38. Just as the 507th had, the 513th also suffered from pilot error due to the ground haze, and as such the regiment actually missed its designated drop zone, DZX, and was dropped on one of the landing zones designated for the British 6th Airlanding Brigade. Despite this <b>inaccuracy</b> the paratroopers swiftly rallied and aided the British glider-borne troops who were landing simultaneously, eliminating several German artillery batteries that were covering the area. Once the German troops in the area had been eliminated, a combined force of American and British airborne troops stormed Hamminkeln and secured the town. By 2pm, Colonel Coutts reported to Divisional Headquarters that the 513th Parachute Infantry had secured all of its objectives, having knocked out two tanks and two complete regiments of artillery during their assault. During its attempts to secure its objectives, the regiment also gained a third Medal of Honor for the 17th Airborne Division when Private First Class Stuart Stryker posthumously received the award after leading a charge against a German machine-gun nest, creating a distraction to allow the rest of his platoon to capture the fortified position in which the machine-gun was situated.|$|E

40|$|In weather {{data sets}} used by crop modellers {{irregularities}} occur as <b>inaccuracies</b> in given data and as missing values. The effects of irregularities in temperature and global radiation data on potential production of spring wheat were discussed previously. Here {{the effects of}} irregularities in weather data on simulated water-limited production of spring wheat are examined, using the same methods as described previously. In general the crop growth model used was not sensitive to <b>inaccuracies</b> in vapour pressure data and wind speed and average data for these variables {{could be used to}} replace missing values. The sensitivity of the model to <b>inaccuracies</b> in other weather data depended on the amount of water available to the crop. In dry years the model was sensitive to <b>inaccuracies</b> in precipitation and radiation data but less so to <b>inaccuracies</b> in air temperature. When water was not limiting the model was not sensitive to <b>inaccuracies</b> in precipitation, but was sensitive to <b>inaccuracies</b> in temperature and radiation data. Use of average values for temperature and global radiation led to large deviations in simulation results. For all variables except precipitation, data from a nearby weather station represented good estimates for missing values. Rainfall data for estimations should be obtained from a site in the immediate vicinity. However, when the complete data set (i. e. for all weather variables) from a station 40 km away was used as input for the model, deviations of up to 2 t ha- 1 (= 30 %) in simulated yields were found. ...|$|R
