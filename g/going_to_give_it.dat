Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode three stars out of five.

[...] Shearman and Pearson, however, did praise Chris Owens' acting, writing that he did a [...] "great job". Tom Kessenich, in his book Examinations, wrote a largely negative review of the episode and derided its plot. He heavily criticized the idea that Scully would offer William up for adoption. Kessenich did however praise Duchovny's directing, noting that [...] " [...] did a masterful job of luring me back to this world of The X-Files". Aaron Kinney from Salon wrote that the episode [...] "scuttled the entire" [...] baby William subplot. M.A. Crang, in his book Denying the Truth: Revisiting The X-Files after 9/11, praised the decision to conclude the William subplot but called the episode's conclusion [...] "sappy".|$|E

2500|$|García Lorca's {{return to}} Spain in 1930 {{coincided with the}} fall of the {{dictatorship}} of Primo de Rivera and the establishment of the Second Spanish Republic. In 1931, García Lorca was appointed director of a student theatre company, Teatro Universitario La Barraca (The Shack). It was funded by the Second Republic's Ministry of Education, and it was charged with touring Spain's rural areas in order to introduce audiences to radically modern interpretations of classic Spanish theatre free of charge. With a portable stage and little equipment, they sought to bring theatre to people who had never seen any, with García Lorca directing as well as acting. He commented: [...] "Outside of Madrid, the theatre, which is in its very essence a part {{of the life of the}} people, is almost dead, and the people suffer accordingly, as they would if they had lost their two eyes, or ears, or a sense of taste. We [...] are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>it</b> back to them". His experiences traveling through impoverished rural Spain and New York (particularly amongst the disenfranchised African American population), transformed him into a passionate advocate of the theatre of social action. He wrote [...] "The theatre is a school of weeping and of laughter, a free forum, where men can question norms that are outmoded or mistaken and explain with living example the eternal norms of the human heart".|$|E

40|$|A {{small set}} of game makers in Australia are placing {{creative}} expression over financial gain, writes Daniel Golding {{in the final}} instalment of a three-part series on the videogame industry. Why do Australians make videogames? In recent articles, I've looked at who makes games in Australia, {{and what kinds of}} games it is that they're making. When it comes to the next logical issue-why make games at all?-some of the question has been tacitly explored in these previous two articles. We can already talk about why, for example, the structures of big and small Australian studios have been created to make videogames. Certainly, there's a lot of compelling work being done in this area of the industry-and even a cursory glance at the small fleet of independent designers at the gargantuan PAX videogames expo held in Melbourne this last weekend reveals a lot of confident, creative work being done in this vein locally. However, what I'm interested in here, by means of concluding this semi-formal trilogy of articles, is the margins of videogame making in Australia. As long as many Australians still pay $ 100 for a videogame in a box from a store, the videogame will remain a commercial object deeply ingrained in the money-making cycle. So why would anyone make a videogame if they're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> just <b>give</b> <b>it</b> away for free? What else could be going on for Australians to want to dedicate their lives to this medium...|$|R
5000|$|A {{thorough}} {{analysis of}} data communications is not possible. What recordings show is that data terminals {{in at least some}} field units did not work properly during at least a portion of the incident. At 09:11:14, Division 3 told Manhattan Fire dispatch, referring to the summary screen, [...] "Summary is only giving me a few units. You're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> me over the radio. I'm ready to write." [...] This means the terminal was not displaying the entire list of units assigned to Division 3, as it would under normal conditions. The work-around: the Chief had to hand-write the list of units responding. In this one instance, the dispatcher reading the list of about 29 units tied up the Manhattan Fire channel for 53 seconds. During the reading of the list of units responding, one can hear several FDNY units try to interrupt the dispatcher. Their radio traffic was delayed until the entire list was read. This need to read lists of units because of slow or inoperable terminals occurred in at least three or four cases.|$|R

60|$|She {{was less}} {{hampered}} than he, so she came more quickly to her fulness, and was sooner ready to enjoy again {{a return to}} the outside world. She was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> a tea-party. His heart sank. He wanted to go on, to go on as they were. He wanted to have done with the outside world, to declare it finished for ever. He was anxious with a deep desire and anxiety that she should stay with him where they were in the timeless universe of free, perfect limbs and immortal breast, affirming that the old outward order was finished. The new order was begun to last for ever, the living life, palpitating from the gleaming core, to action, without crust or cover or outward lie. But no, he could not keep her. She wanted the dead world again-she wanted to walk on the outside once more. She was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> a tea-party. <b>It</b> made him frightened and furious and miserable. He was afraid all would be lost that he had so newly come into: like the youth in the fairy tale, who was king for one day in the year, and for the rest a beaten herd: like Cinderella also, at the feast. He was sullen. But she blithely began to make preparations for her tea-party. His fear was too strong, he was troubled, he hated her shallow anticipation and joy. Was she not forfeiting the reality, the one reality, for all that was shallow and worthless? Wasn't she carelessly taking off her crown to be an artificial figure having other artificial women to tea: when she might have been perfect with him, and kept him perfect, in the land of intimate connection? Now he must be deposed, his joy must be destroyed, he must put on the vulgar, shallow death of an outward existence.|$|R

6000|$|It was at {{this point}} that she saw the smash of her great {{question}} as complete, saw that {{all she had to do}} with was the sense of being there with him. And there was no chill for this in what she also presently saw--that, however he had begun, he was now acting from a particular desire, determined either by new facts or new fancies, to be like everyone else, simplifyingly [...] "kind" [...] to her. He had caught on already as to manner--fallen into line with everyone else; and if his spirits verily had gone up it might well be that he had thus felt himself lighting on the remedy for all awkwardness. Whatever he did or he didn't, Milly knew she should still like him--there was no alternative to that; but her heart could none the less sink a little on feeling how much his view of her was destined to have in common with--as she now sighed over it--the view. She could have dreamed of his not having the view, of his having something or other, if need be quite viewless, of his own; but he might have what he could with least trouble, and the view wouldn't be, after all, a positive bar to her seeing him. The defect of it in general--if she might so ungraciously criticise--was that, by its sweet universality, it made relations rather prosaically a matter of course. It anticipated and superseded the--likewise sweet--operation of real affinities. It was this that was doubtless marked in her power to keep him now--this and her glassy lustre of attention to his pleasantness about the scenery in the Rockies. She was in truth a little measuring her success in detaining him by Kate's success in [...] "standing" [...] Susan. It would not be, if she could help it, Mr. Densher who should first break down. Such at least was one of the forms of the girl's inward tension; but beneath even this deep reason was a motive still finer. What she had left at home on <b>going</b> out <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>it</b> a chance was meanwhile still, was more sharply and actively, there. What had been at the top of her mind about it and then been violently pushed down--this quantity was again working up. As soon as their friends should go Susie would break out, and what she would break out upon wouldn't be--interested in that gentleman as she had more than once shown herself--the personal fact of Mr. Densher. Milly had found in her face at luncheon a feverish glitter, and it told what she was full of. She didn't care now for Mr. Densher's personal fact. Mr. Densher had risen before her only to find his proper place in her imagination already, of a sudden, occupied. His personal fact failed, so far as she was concerned, to be personal, and her companion noted the failure. This could only mean that she was full to the brim, of Sir Luke Strett, and of what she had had from him. What had she had from him? It was indeed now working upward again that Milly would do well to know, though knowledge looked stiff in the light of Susie's glitter. It was therefore, on the whole, because Densher's young hostess was divided from it by so thin a partition that she continued to cling to the Rockies.|$|R
