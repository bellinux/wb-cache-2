40|$|The {{good and}} the bad for <b>incombustibility</b> of {{interior}} finish material of building depend on the smoking modulus CA, is concerned with the structural safely of fire control system. Presently, although there is the regulations for examining the <b>incombustibility</b> of interior finish material of building but it lacks the effective evaluation method to judge whether the quality control capability of <b>incombustibility</b> of interior finish material of building attain the requirement or not. Thus, the principle of statistics is used to infer a convenient, effective and reliable evaluation tool to be evaluation standard for quality control of <b>incombustibility</b> of interior finish material of building. This new evaluation procedure is not only useful for the customers to examine and compare the purchase decision but also the best way to improve the production and quality control capability of <b>incombustibility</b> of interior finish material manufacturers. 建築裝修材料之耐燃性，攸關整體建築物之消防安全。目前雖有建築裝修材料耐性之規定，但卻鮮有品質管制之有效評估工具。因此本文利用統計推理的方法，發展一套簡便、有效且值得信賴的評估工具，以作為建築防火裝修材料品質管制之評估標準，此法除可有效評估建築防火裝修材料品質外，並可作為研判建築裝修材料製造商之製程與品管能力的指標，進而可作為建商採購建築防火裝修材料之決策及建築裝修材料製造商改進建築防火修材料製造程序與品質納制之依據...|$|E
30|$|A {{practical}} {{approach to}} enhancing the fire retardancy of wood-based materials by adding fire-retardant chemicals to the glue was developed. Plywoods were manufactured using urea melamine formaldehyde resin mixed with ammonium pentaborate or dihydrogen phosphate. Treated plywoods had better <b>incombustibility</b> than untreated ones. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis clearly demonstrated {{the distribution of}} boron and phosphorus, which had migrated from the glue to the wood, contributing to better fire retardant properties. The cross-sectional micrographs from scanning electron microscopy showed that untreated specimens exhibited a foamy structure near the interface in the glue layer and the deformed structure of wood cells. The cell structure and cell wall thickness retained intact in the specimens treated with urea melamine formaldehyde resin mixed with ammonium pentaborate or dihydrogen phosphate. When observing {{the effect of the}} thickness of overlay veneers on <b>incombustibility,</b> a shorter glowing time was obtained from the specimens with a thicker surface layer when the fire retardant chemical was added at 2 %, but the differences were smaller at the higher chemical retention of 4 %. A similar tendency was observed for the char length.|$|E
30|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop a method for the effective use of both pruned wood and porcelain stone scrap. Thus, we manufactured a wood-porcelain stone composite board, which has excellent waterproof property and <b>incombustibility</b> properties. In addition, we examined the conditions needed to manufacture the wood-porcelain stone composite board as a construction material and evaluated the physical and mechanical properties of this board based on the Japanese Industrial Standard. The main results obtained were as follows: the wood-porcelain stone composite board made from pruned wood and porcelain stone scrap had excellent thickness swelling performance and the board had <b>incombustibility</b> properties that were better than commercial oriented strand board. In both single-layer and three-layer composite boards with weight ratios of porcelain stone particles of 40 %, the internal bond strength exceeded the standard value of type 18 particleboard of JIS A 5908. However, the bending properties of the composite board were inferior to the type 18 particleboard standard. Therefore, it will be necessary to improve the bending properties of the board by changing the particle sizes of both the porcelain stone scrap and the pruned wood component.|$|E
40|$|Aqueous {{electric}} {{double layer}} capacitors (EDLCs) have <b>incombustibility,</b> earth-friendliness, high power density, as well as high capacitance. Hazardous strong acid and strong base solutions such as H 2 SO 4 and KOH are often employed as an electrolyte for aqueous EDLCs due to their high ionic conductivity. There are, therefore, handling difficulties and the potential risk of leakage. An alternative design is required for safe EDLC systems; i. e., the replacement of such electrolytes by polymer gel electrolytes is a practical strategy in terms of reliability without leakage components. In addition, the application of gel electrolytes to EDLCs can lead to thin film cells, cells without a separator and so on. However, in our knowledge, few reports succeeded in constructing gel-based EDLCs with higher capacity when compared t...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A {{composite}} adsorbent with upper-layer {{activated carbon}} (TY) and lower-layer hydrophobic silica gel (HSG) was developed, {{based on the}} comprehensive consideration of both adsorption capacity and adsorption heat of activated carbon and hydrophobic silica. For the composite adsorbent, various volumetric ratio of activated carbon to silica gel was designed, and the adsorption capacity and heat effect of the composite adsorbent with different ratio were investigated. The experimental {{results showed that the}} optimum ratio was 1 : 1. Thus, the vapor with high concentration was early adsorbed by the lower-layer hydrophobic silica gel, and then the residual vapor with low concentration was late adsorbed by the upper-layer activated carbon. In this way, <b>incombustibility</b> of silica gel and high adsorption capacity of activated carbon were fully utilized; accordingly the adsorption operation safety was improved and the adsorption capacity of activated carbon was increased owing to that the activated carbon was only used to adsorb the vapor with low concentration...|$|E
30|$|Ionic liquids are salts {{that have}} melting points around ambient {{temperature}} and unique characteristics, {{such as high}} solubility, extremely low volatility, <b>incombustibility</b> and low viscosity. Application of ionic liquids in wood processing technology has attracted attention {{and is expected to}} promote further use of wood. They are effective as wood-preserving agents to enhance decay-resistance and also improve fire resistance of wood. Ionic liquids have been used as reaction solvents for preparing various cellulose derivatives or composites with other materials. Attempts have been made to use ionic liquids in pretreatments for enzymatic hydrolysis when producing bio-ethanol from cellulose or wood. Ionic liquids also {{have been shown to be}} effective for dissolution of cellulose or wood, forming the basis for studies into the separation of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin from wood. The effective separation of these components is essential for chemical use of wood, and ionic liquid treatment thus has potential as an enabling technique in biorefineries. Moreover, ionic liquids induce depolymerization of solubilized wood polymers, which may be applicable to the production of useful chemicals from wood polymers such as cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin.|$|E
40|$|Although polymer-modified {{cement mortar}} (PCM) has been {{extensively}} used as finishing and repairing material, {{it is necessary to}} understand its combustion properties and mechanical properties at high temperature. This study evaluated the combustion characteristics with varying experimental parameters such as polymer type, unit polymer content, polymer-cement ratio, and thickness of the specimen. This study also evaluated the compressive strength and elastic modulus of PCMs with focus on the effects of the type of polymer, unit polymer content, and polymer-cement ratio. As a result, the <b>incombustibility</b> of the PCM was in the following order: SBR < VVA < EVA. After heating end, the mass loss rate of the PCM was less than 30 %, regardless of the polymer type, unit polymer content, and W/C. In heat release rate test, the higher the unit polymer content, the greater the total heat release, regardless of the difference in W/C. The PAE series showed excellent fire resistance in the temperature range of 200 ~ 400 °C. PCMs with a unit polymer content of 5 %, modified with EVA and PAE, showed outstanding compressive strength at 200 ~ 400 °C. At elevated temperature, the modulus of elasticity of PCM declined with an increase in the unit polymer content, regardless of the polymer type...|$|E
30|$|Ionic liquids (ILs) are organic salts that {{typically}} consist of bulky, asymmetric organic cations, and inorganic symmetric anions. Room-temperature ILs {{are defined as}} salts with melting points below or equal to room temperature [4, 5]. ILs have attracted widespread interest in polymer science due to their versatile properties, such as negligible saturated vapor pressure, wide liquid-state temperature range, nonflammability, <b>incombustibility,</b> high electrical conductivity, and good stability to oxidation [6 – 10]. They have progressively been used as solvents and catalysts for polymerization reactions [10] as well as additives {{in the design of}} polymer materials [11]. Their peculiar structure enables easy separation, recovery, and recycling of the catalyst from the reaction mixtures. In the case of membrane processes, ILs are being used in the design and modification of advanced materials that enable performance levels not typical of conventional materials [12]. Another application of ILs consists of their use as effective and reusable porogens in vinylic networks [13]. When ILs are used as porogenic solvents, during the in situ formation of polymer networks, chemically induced phase separation occurs. To act as efficient porogens, ILs have to possess: (i) high boiling temperature to avoid any premature evaporation, (ii) high thermal stability to remain unchanged up to the complete curing of the polymer networks, and (iii) easy extractability to be readily removed from the cured networks, thus affording porous thermosetting materials.|$|E
40|$|<b>Incombustibility</b> is one {{important}} {{advantage of the}} sheet steel sheathed shear wall over wood panel sheathed shear wall. Compared to shear wall sheathed with plywood and OSB panel, shear wall sheathed with flat sheet steel behaved lower shear strength. Although shear wall sheathed with corrugated sheet steel exhibited high nominal strength and high stiffness, the shear wall usually behaved lower ductility resulting from brittle failure at {{the connection between the}} sheathing to frames. This research is aimed at developing modifications on the corrugated sheathing to improve the ductility of the shear wall as well as derive practical response modification factor by establishing correct relationship between ductility factor ? and response modification factor R. Totally 21 monotonic and cyclic full-scale shear wall tests were conducted during the winter break in 2012 by the author in NUCONSTEEL Materials Testing Laboratory in the University of North Texas. The research investigated nineteen 8 ft. × 4 ft. shear walls with 68 mil frames and 27 mil corrugation sheet steel in 11 configurations and two more shear walls sheathed with 6 / 17 -in. OSB and 15 / 32 -in. plywood respectively for comparison. The shear walls, which were in some special cutting arrangement patterns, performed better under lateral load conditions according to the behavior of ductility and shear strength and could be used as lateral system in construction...|$|E
40|$|To {{control the}} power of fire {{has been one of}} the {{perpetual}} problems of mankind. When man learned that he could make fire an instrument of service, he found also that he was unable to cope with his tool when it overran its confinements. This might still be an unfortunate truth today were it not for the discovery of a curious fibrous mineral, called asbestos, whose outstanding and most useful characteristic is <b>incombustibility.</b> Through the use of this strange material men have been able to diminish the destruction that fire can create and to make modern living safer, more comfortable, and more efficient. It was not until modern times, however, that the innumerable potential uses of the mineral were realized, but today the possession of asbestos deposits or the unhampered access to foreign sources of supply has become essential to every industrial nation. The largest resources of this material are found in Canada, and consequently its production constitutes an extremely important industry for that nation. Although the purpose of this monograph is to examine in what manner conditions during the period following 1929 and the present war have affected the production of the mineral and the manufacture of asbestos products in Canada and throughout the world, it would make for a clearer understanding of the industry's problems if certain technical details concerning the nature of asbestos were first considered.

40|$|Like parts or {{structures}} assembled from common isotropic engineering materials, fiber reinforced composites can {{be subjected}} to impact loading during their service life. Fiber composites have, nevertheless, a unique interaction with the externally applied load, since severe internal damage can be generated without any external sign. In fact, several damage mechanisms can be operating, viz. matrix cracking, fiber breakage, fiber pullout, fiber-matrix interface rupture and delamination. The challenge of non-destructive quality control is to establish safe boundaries {{for the use of}} a composite part or structure, which has been subjected to an impact event not causing non-repairable failure. For the range of possible impact velocities many parameters could be involved on the composite response, such as the mass and the geometry of the impactor; the laminate stacking sequence; among others, the kind, architecture and volume of reinforcement fibers. In our work, we have focused our attention on two woven fabric reinforced composites: one reinforced with E-glass fibers and the other with basalt ones, both subjected to low velocity impact at different energies. Basaltfibers are produced from basalt rock using single component raw material by drawing and winding fibers from the melt. Once the basalt fibers have been produced, they are transformed into a suitable form for particular application. Basalt fibers is a contemporary material, which combines ecological safety, natural longevity, and fire safety (<b>incombustibility).</b> Water-absorbing capacity of basalt fiber is much less than 1...|$|E
