After Szymczyk convinced King that he could improve his sound to make him more appealing to a wider audience, King himself agreed to let Szymczyk produce for him. Among the albums he produced for King are the 1969 live album Live & Well, King's first ever top-100 album.

500|$|Throughout this period, Harrison's {{devotion to}} Hindu spirituality – {{particularly}} to Krishna consciousness via {{his friendship with}} A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada – reached new heights. As Harrison admitted, his adherence to his spiritual path was not necessarily consistent. His wife, Pattie Boyd, and their friend Chris O'Dell would joke {{that it was hard}} to tell whether he was dipping into his ever-present Japa Yoga prayer bag or [...] "the coke bag". This duality has been noted by Harrison biographers Simon Leng and Alan Clayson: on one hand, Harrison earned himself the nickname [...] "His Lectureship" [...] during his prolonged periods of fervid devotion; on the other, he participated in bawdy London sessions <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>likes</b> of Bobby Keys' eponymous solo album and what Leng terms Harry Nilsson's [...] "thoroughly nasty" [...] "You're Breakin' My Heart", both recorded in the first half of 1972.

Artists such as Muhal Richard Abrams, John Stubblefield, Henry Threadgill, Anthony Braxton and the Chicago Art Ensemble would perform at the space. The gallery also served as a gathering place <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>likes</b> of Jeff Donaldson, Barbara Jones-Hogu, Gerald Williams and others, who would come to discuss concepts of a relevant black art aesthetic. The group struggled: Jarrell described the search as an attempt to find [...] "a collective concept that would say 'black art' at a glance." [...] Eventually, the group made a breakthrough while listing principles and ideas regarding the concept of black art; the term [...] "coolade colors" [...] was contributed by a fabric designer. The term covered the bright fashion of stylish African American men of the time, which Jarrell described as [...] "loud lime, pimp yellows, hot pinks, high-key color clothing." [...] The final concept for their aesthetic search would be message oriented art, revolving around socially aware content. African design would be included and meaningfulness for black people would be a necessity. This group's formation would be considered one of the best aligned and organized collectives in the Black Arts Movement. This group went on to form COBRA.|$|E
