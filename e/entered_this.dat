5|$|In early December, the ITCZ spawned {{an area of}} {{convection}} {{near the}} boundary between the south-west Indian and Australian regions. On December8, the MFR estimated that a disturbance formed just within the Australian region, which <b>entered</b> <b>this</b> basin on December9. After the convection developed into a central dense overcast, the system intensified into Tropical Storm Elvina on December10. Later that day, the MFR estimated peak 10minute winds of 85km/h (50mph). On December11, the JTWC estimated peak 1minute winds of 100km/h (65mph). By that time, Elvina had been moving steadily west-southwestward, although the storm slowed on December12. A polar trough caused the storm to accelerate to the southwest on December14 while simultaneously increasing wind shear, causing weakening. On December16, Elvina dissipated well to the south of Diego Garcia.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} Hurricane Barry {{can be traced}} to a {{tropical}} wave which moved off the western coast of Africa on August13, 1983. Strong wind shear in the North Atlantic hurricane basin prevented significant development of the system as it traveled towards the west-northwest. Little convection was associated with the disturbance {{as a result of the}} shear. While approaching the Bahamas on August22, an upper-level trough moved away from the system, which led to a decrease in the wind shear. The disturbance then <b>entered</b> <b>this</b> environment and spawned an area of low pressure which intensified. On August23, the low had become sufficiently organized to be declared Tropical Depression Four. Later that day, the depression quickly strengthened into a tropical storm and was given the name Barry by the National Hurricane Center (NHC). About 12hours after becoming a tropical storm, Barry reached its initial peak intensity with winds of 60mph (95km/h).|$|E
5|$|The {{team had}} an {{excellent}} later {{half of the season}} in single-day races, attaining top-ten placings in all but one such race that they <b>entered.</b> <b>This</b> successful run started at the Clásica de San Sebastián. Both Schleck brothers were mentioned as possible pre-race contenders, and Fränk Schleck rode to sixth place on the day by finishing with the first chase pack back of solo winner Philippe Gilbert and second-placed Carlos Barredo. In August, Nizzolo continued his strong neo-pro season with a fifth place ride at the GP Ouest-France, finishing second-best from the peloton behind three attacking riders who took each podium place just ahead of them.|$|E

5|$|A Vindication of the Rights of Woman {{was written}} against the tumultuous {{background}} of the French Revolution and the debates that it spawned in Britain. In a lively and sometimes vicious pamphlet war, now {{referred to as the}} Revolution controversy, British political commentators addressed topics ranging from representative government to human rights to {{the separation of church and}} state, many of these issues having been raised in France first. Wollstonecraft first <b>entered</b> <b>this</b> fray in 1790 with A Vindication of the Rights of Men, a response to Edmund Burke's Reflections on the Revolution in France (1790). In his Reflections, Burke criticized the view of many British thinkers and writers who had welcomed the early stages of the French revolution. While they saw the revolution as analogous to Britain's own Glorious Revolution in 1688, which had restricted the powers of the monarchy, Burke argued that the appropriate historical analogy was the English Civil War (1642–1651) in which Charles I had been executed in 1649. He viewed the French revolution as the violent overthrow of a legitimate government. In Reflections he argues that citizens do not have the right to revolt against their government because civilization is the result of social and political consensus; its traditions cannot be continually challenged—the result would be anarchy. One of the key arguments of Wollstonecraft's Rights of Men, published just six weeks after Burke's Reflections, is that rights cannot be based on tradition; rights, she argues, should be conferred because they are reasonable and just, regardless of their basis in tradition.|$|E
5|$|At 02:00 September 5, Lieutenant Colonel Rollins S. Emmerich, {{one of the}} ROK I Corps KMAG advisers, {{hastened to}} Yonil Airfield where he conferred with Lieutenant Colonel D. M. McMains, {{commanding}} the 3rd Battalion, 9th Infantry, stationed there, and informed him {{of the situation in}} P'ohang-dong. Emmerich obtained a platoon of tanks and returned with them to the town. He placed the tanks in position and awaited the expected North Korean armored attack. At 05:30 he received information that elements of the ROK 22nd Regiment had retreated in the face of North Korean attack. North Korean troops <b>entered</b> <b>this</b> gap and just before 11:00 the American tanks in P'ohang-dong were under heavy North Korean machine gun fire. Five NK SU-76 self-propelled guns approached and began firing. At a range of one city block the US tanks knocked out the lead gun, killing its three crew members. In the ensuing exchange of fire the other four withdrew. Emmerich then directed air strikes and artillery fire which destroyed the other four guns. But that afternoon at 14:35 the order came to evacuate all materiel and supplies from the Yonil airstrip.|$|E
5|$|Raglan Castle {{was built}} in several phases, initial work {{occurring}} in the 1420s and 1430s, a major phase in the 1460s, with various alterations and additions {{at the end of}} the 16th century. The castle {{was built in}} stone, initially pale sandstone from Redbrook, and later Old Red Sandstone, with Bath Stone used for many of the detailed features. Like similar properties of the period, the castle of the 1460s was almost certainly designed to be approached and entered in a particular way, maximising the aesthetic and political value of the fortification. At Raglan, the design highlighted the Great Tower: a typical senior visitor would ride through Raglan village, and first the tower and then the rest of the castle would appear suddenly over the slight rise on the hill. A visitor would have needed to circle the Great Tower and the moat, before coming in through the gatehouse, into the Pitched Stone Court, around the edge of the communal hall, before reaching the previously hidden, and more refined, inner Fountain Court. Only then would a privileged guest be able to enter the Great Tower itself, overlooking the Herbert family's own chambers. Many less senior visitors or servants would never have <b>entered</b> <b>this</b> far, seeing only the external elements of the castle, but perhaps having been impressed by the outside of the Great Tower as they arrived.|$|E
