The DNW buried inside the epitaxial layer intensifies the electric field {{deep inside the}} epi-layer significantly, and helps the electrons generated inside the epi-layer to drift faster to the cathode. Therefore, this new structure reduces the carrier transit time and enhances the PD bandwidth. A PD with an area of 70 70 m 2 fabricated in a 0. 18 - m epi-CMOS achieves 3 -dB bandwidth of 3. 1 GHz in the small signal and 2. 6 GHz in the large signal, both with a 15 -V bias voltage and 850 -nm optical illumination.

In {{the context of}} solid-oxide fuel cells, STO has been recently applied as an <b>epitaxial</b> <b>substrate</b> for nano-sized layers of mixed ion-electron conductive catalysts with enhanced electrochemical performances. To extend the applications of such heterogeneous nano-cathodes in real devices, also the STO support should be active for both electron transport and oxide diffusion.

These two ions fit in the perovskite structure and induce holes in the STO valence band, so as to obtain the desired p-type electronic conduction. At the same time, the doping with alkali ions also promotes the formation of oxygen vacancies in STO, a prerequisite for effective oxide diffusion. Analysis of electron density rearrangements upon defect formation allows relating the favorable vacancy formation energies to an improved electronic delocalization over the oxide sub-lattice, as observed in closely related materials (e. g.

40|$|Integration {{of digital}} and analog {{circuits}} {{on the same}} chip {{is the result of}} the microelectronic industry's strive for low-cost, small, hand-held products. However, these mixed-signal circuits can experience interference problems; digital circuits inject noise into the substrate which is transmitted throughout the chip and received by sensitive analog circuits. This substrate noise can therefore degrade the performance of the chip. When performing noise coupling analysis, accurate substrate models are needed. Previous compact models were either based on two dimensional simulations, which is not sufficient since the substrate problem is inherently three dimensional, or required extraction of empirical parameters, which makes the models less predictable.

40|$|The {{study of}} soft matter's phase {{behaviour}} {{is based on}} thermodynamics, originally developed to describe systems i) composed of identical particles, and ii) in their final equilibrium state. However, a practical understanding requires knowledge of how real systems do (or do not) actually approach equilibrium. This is especially diffcult to achieve when, as often in soft matter, the constituents are polydisperse, i. e. comprise continuously non-identical particle species. I present a wide-ranging simulation study of phase transition kinetics {{in the presence of}} polydispersity, in the context of model colloidal systems. After briefly exploring the structural and dynamical physics of polydisperse systems, I show that fractionation (the partitioning of a polydisperse property between phases) may be enacted in the very early stages of phase separation, and highlight the qualitative sensitivity of this effect to the details of inter-particle potentials. I study the effects of metastable gas-liquid separation on crystal growth, finding a complex dependence on polydispersity which I explain with novel fractionation and local size correlation measurements. I test a theory of fractionation against experimental data in a colloid-polymer mixture with small polymers, a regime in which the widely-used Mean-Field Asakura-Oosawa (MFAO) model becomes unphysical, and find that qualitative agreement can be obtained via a simple modification of the MFAO theory. I precisely measure the composition of a diffusively-grown hard sphere crystal with small polydispersity.

The presence of coherent nanophases and the clamping effect from an <b>epitaxial</b> <b>substrate</b> enables the formation of transversely modulated nanostructures (TMNS) resulting in improved functionality, which was previously observed through increased piezoelectric response in BiFeO 3. The ability to fabricate high quality epitaxial films presents opportunity to investigate coherent phase decomposition in other material systems with multifunctional response. The research herein aims to extend the concept of nanoscale self assembly in metallic systems, including Ag-Si and Pd-PdH. First, the effect of annealing a Ag-Si couple was examined, and ordered, nanoscale Ag crystallites were observed along the interface with the epitaxial Si wafer. It is demonstrated that Ag foil {{can be used in}} place of doped Ag paste (commonly used in solar cell metallization) to achieve TMNS at the interface. It was proved that annealing the Ag-Si couple in air is necessary for the self-assembly reaction to take place, as doing so prevents bulk diffusion and eutectic melting. Electron backscatter diffraction was used to verify the epitaxial relation between the Ag nanostructures and Si crystal. A method to fabricate ordered, nanoscale PdH precipitates in epitaxial Pd thin films via high temperate gas phase hydrogenation was established. Epitaxial Pd films were deposited via e-beam deposition and a V buffer layer was necessary to induce epitaxy. This novel self-assembled nanostructure may enable hysteresis-less absorption and desorption, thus improving functionality with regard to hydrogen sensing and storage. The epitaxial Pd film was characterized before and after hydrogenation with x-ray diffraction and atomic force microscopy to determine composition and nanostructure of the film.
