30|$|Focusing on {{the timing}} variables, the <b>issuance</b> <b>of</b> debt (Column 1) is preceded by <b>issuances</b> <b>of</b> debt (Issuer Debt in t- 4 to t- 12 {{statistically}} significant) and hybrid instruments (both Issuer Hybrid Instruments in t- 4 to t- 12 and Issuer Hybrid Instruments in t- 4 to t- 12 statistically significant), but not <b>issuances</b> <b>of</b> capital. Similarly, <b>issuances</b> <b>of</b> hybrid instruments are preceded by other <b>issuances</b> <b>of</b> hybrid instruments and by <b>issuances</b> <b>of</b> debt. However, {{the probability of}} issuing capital is not correlated with the <b>issuance</b> <b>of</b> debt but increases with the <b>issuances</b> <b>of</b> hybrid instruments {{during the last three}} months. Table  4 shows that the coefficients that are statistically different from zero are also statistically different across types <b>of</b> <b>issuances.</b> Therefore, banks that finance their growth with <b>issuances</b> <b>of</b> debt also increase their <b>issuances</b> <b>of</b> hybrid instruments, which indicates that they are managing their regulatory capital holdings using hybrid instruments to comply with the higher requirements due to the increase in debt holdings. Further evidence for this finding is provided by the variable Low Capital, which is positive and statistically significant at 10 % in hybrid instruments whereas it is not statistically significant for capital, which indicates that banks whose regulatory capital is close to the minimum are likely to issue hybrid instruments but not capital instruments. Given that the threshold of 8 % is exogenous, the <b>issuance</b> <b>of</b> capital instruments might be a response to maintain or increase their Basel ratios by using only hybrid capital, which means they want to minimize the cost of regulatory compliance.|$|R
