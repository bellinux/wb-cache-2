500|$|Within {{two months}} of its {{successful}} premiere at the Odd Fellows Concert Hall in Copenhagen on 28 February 1912, the Third Symphony (Espansiva) was in the repertoire of the Amsterdam Concertgebouw, and by 1913 it had seen performances in Stuttgart, Stockholm and Helsinki. The symphony {{was the most popular}} of all Nielsen's works during his lifetime and was also played in Berlin, Hamburg, London and Gothenburg. Other works caused some uncertainty, even in Denmark. After the premiere of the Fifth Symphony (1922) one critic wrote: [...] "The treasure of Danish symphonies and Carl Nielsen's own output have been enriched by a strange and highly original work." [...] Another, however, described it as a [...] "bloody, clenched <b>fist</b> <b>in</b> the face of an unsuspecting snob audience", also qualifying it as [...] "filthy music from trenches".|$|E

Commenting on the colt's improvement, Baffert said, [...] "We took the blinkers off, put cotton in his ears and schooled him a lot. He trained well, we decided he was ready and we put him in there.

500|$|The {{immediate}} {{reception of}} the press to the symphony was generally positive, especially the first movement.

500|$|In live {{performances}} with Tool, Keenan {{has often been}} known to be situated on a platform towards {{the rear of the}} stage, without a spotlight, facing the backdrop rather than the audience. Breckinridge Haggerty, the band's live video director, says that the dark spaces on stage [...] "are mostly for Maynard". He explains, [...] "a lot of the songs are a personal journey for him and he has a hard time with the glare of the lights when he's trying to reproduce these emotions for the audience. He needs a bit of personal space, and he feels more comfortable in the shadows." [...] An exception, which surprised even devout Tool fans, occurred when a fan climbed on stage and attempted to hug Keenan during the band's performance of [...] "Pushit". After dropping the fan to the ground with a gentle hip toss, Keenan, continuing to sing, wrapped himself around the man's back into a rear naked choke. [...] He held the man without actually constricting his neck, allowing him to raise his <b>fist</b> <b>in</b> celebration. Keenan eventually turned the man to his stomach and sat on his back, where he stayed for [...] "an uncomfortably long period of time." [...] His appearance with Tool has included the Mohawk hairstyle, wigs, Kabuki masks, bras, tights, and his entire body in blue paint. This is contrasted with a variety of long haired wigs while performing with or promoting A Perfect Circle.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} of the album was positive overall. Robin Denselow of The Guardian awarded the album four of five stars and wrote that Wainwright's performance sounded as [...] "easy-going and spontaneous" [...] and it does at his live concerts.

The Daily Telegraph Colin Irwin described the album as [...] "oddly uplifting" [...] despite its [...] "variants on the theme that we're all doomed" [...] from the economic crisis. The Observer contributor Neil Spencer wrote that [...] "while [...] tone becomes shrill at times, his mix of nihilism and jauntiness (with ukulele) are finally uplifting." [...] Music journalist Andy Gill of The Independent recommended the tracks [...] "House", [...] "Fear Itself [...] " [...] and [...] "The Panic Is On". Simmy Richman's review for The Independent complimented Wainwright's ability to address current issues [...] "simply and effectively", claiming [...] "Wainwright can make you laugh, nod in agreement, shake your <b>fist</b> <b>in</b> despair and want to sing along". Richman appreciated Wainwright's honesty and humor and wrote that he displayed [...] "better lyrical form than {{he has been in}} for some time". The Independent included 10 Songs on their [...] "Indy Choice: Best of the New Music" [...] list for the week of July 16, 2010. PopMatters' Alex Ramon preferred Wainwright's album Social Studies (1999), but considered 10 Songs to be [...] "an enjoyable effort nonetheless", complimenting it for its simple approach. Furthermore, Ramon wrote that the album [...] "succeeds in getting you smiling rather than despairing at the mess we're in, and that's always been one of Wainwright's great gifts".|$|E
