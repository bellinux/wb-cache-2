The synthesis of the <b>impregnated</b> activated <b>carbon</b> was prepared according to the concentration and mixture ratio. The physicochemical properties of the <b>impregnated</b> activated <b>carbon</b> were characterized by X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Brunauer, Emmett and Teller (BET), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM). The XRD analysis was used to determine the type of compound presence on the activated carbon surface. The result reveals that the diffraction angles around 21. 66 ยบ to 22. 18 ยบ were linked for pyrazole, ethanolamine and diethanolamine which prove the presence of hydrocarbon and amine on the activated carbon surfaces. From the BET analysis, the total surface area and pore volume decreased with the increase of concentration of MEA and DEA.

The effect of amount of activated carbon and flow rate of gas stream toward adsorption capacity were investigated. Then, the activated <b>carbons</b> were <b>impregnated</b> by three types of alkaline (NaOH, KOH and K 2 CO 3) with various ratios. The effects of various types of alkaline and their impregnation ratio towards adsorption capacity were analysed.
