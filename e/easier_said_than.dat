However, they were often willing to concede privileges to certain prostitutes, consequently provoking parishioners' complains about their inability to enforce the law. Indeed, even the prostitutes taken up by the watch were frequently released after a few hours in the watch house without seeing any magistrate. The circumstances changed when theft or some other kind of crimes were committed. Public opinion, and Moreton too, firmly believed that these women needed to be restrained in their liberties not only for their vices and immoralities but because they represented a real threat to common living. Unfortunately, most of the times this was <b>easier</b> <b>said</b> <b>than</b> done. Watchmen had the power to apprehend criminals within the boundaries of their parish, and they were liable to be reprimanded for leaving their beats. So they might not have been so inclined to chase a woman who crossed into another parish in order to avoid being taken.|$|E

The renovations scenario upon these terrace houses is indeed one of the serious housing issues and problems in Malaysia.

Investigations will be carried out by questionnaires, statistic analysis of findings from site visits, and interviews with the owners of the houses. Among those things that will be investigated are about the type of renovations that have been done and the factors which influence the act of renovating.

However, most sailing courses were not nearly that neat.

And this is <b>easier</b> <b>said</b> <b>than</b> done, considering Merida is a character who, up until this point, hasn’t even been particularly likable. I like Amy Manson in the role of Merida, but she hasn’t always been given the best material, often coming across as unnecessarily combative and standoffish. And so this episode was necessary to soften the character and illustrate why she’s as hard-nosed as she is. This episode also gave Manson the opportunity to really shine, while also bringing back some OUAT alums I didn’t realize I’d missed, such as Mulan (Jamie Chung) and Ruby (Meghan Ory). We also get to meet more of Merida’s family, such as Queen Elinor (Caroline Morahan), and — through flashbacks — the late King Fergus (Glenn Keogh). It’s a story that details how Merida is shaped into a warrior and a ruler who inspires leadership in her people, and from that standpoint, it’s one of the season’s more effective character studies." ...|$|E

(1998) {{point out}} that there are {{advertisers}} who do use gay and lesbian models to promote directly to the gay and lesbian community, but wish to remain innocuous to heterosexuals. Gay and lesbian advertisers do not actively pursue national recognition (which is essentially to a much larger demographic of heterosexuals) mostly due to fear and criticism. However, some very notable corporations, such as [...] "Sony, Toyota, Microsoft, Levi's, Banana Republic, American Express, Miller, and Absolut now commonly use gay media. Some firms (IKEA, Calvin Klein, Benetton) have gone further into using homosexual imagery in advertising to [...] more general audiences" [...] (Bhat et al., 1998, p.10). The gay and lesbian advertisers should be creating ads that appeal to all sexual preferences, even though this may be <b>easier</b> <b>said</b> <b>than</b> done. The gay and lesbian advertisers must go beyond their select audience for ad campaigns targeting gays and lesbians to look at the inclusion, instead of exclusion, of heterosexuals. Sender (1999) suggests that on the heterosexual side, [...] "images which are arousing for lesbians, but which may not have originally been intended for , may actually offer greater pleasure than those which are implicitly coded to suggest a lesbian reading" [...] (p.191). If such is the case for [...] "hot lesbian" [...] advertisements, then there is nothing to say that actual lesbian advertisements might find heterosexuals left wanting something as well from them.|$|E

40|$|Online banking {{systems have}} become more common and widely used in daily life, {{bringing}} huge changes in modern banking transaction activities and giving us a greater opportunity to access the banking system anytime and anywhere. At the same time, however, {{one of the key}} challenges that still remain is to fully resolve the security concerns associated with the online banking system. Many clients feel that online banking is not secure enough, and to increase its security levels, many banks simply add more identity-checking steps or put on more security measures to some extent to give users the impression of a secure online banking system. However, this is <b>easier</b> to be <b>said</b> <b>than</b> done, because we believe that more identity-checking steps could compromise the usability of the online banking system, which is an inevitable feature in design of usable and useful online banking systems. Banks can simply enhance their security level with more sophisticated technologies, but this does not seem to guarantee the online banking system is in line with its key usability concern. Therefore, the research question raised in this thesis is to establish the relationships between usability, security and trustworthiness in the online banking system. To demonstrate these relationships, three experiments were carried out using the simulation of an online banking logon procedure to provide a similar online banking experience. Post questionnaires were used to measure the three concepts, i. e. usability, security and trustworthiness. The resulting analyses revealed that simply adding more identity-checking steps in the online banking system did not improve the customers? perceived security and trustworthiness, nor the biometric security technique (i. e., fingerprints) did enhance the subjective ratings on the perceived security and trustworthiness. This showed that the systems designer needs to be aware that the customer?s perception of the online banking system {{is not the same as}} that conceived from a technical standpoint...|$|R
