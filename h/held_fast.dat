5|$|Another {{one of the}} men {{gave the}} {{surprising}} testimony that Lieutenant Commander Coakley had threatened to have him shot after he refused to answer some questions during interrogation at Camp Shoemaker. Seaman Alphonso McPherson <b>held</b> <b>fast</b> to his testimony even when faced by Coakley in cross-examination. Coakley denied threatening anyone, exclaiming that such an idea was a personal affront. Veltmann responded that this line of evidence was news to him, too. The next day, Coakley gave the press a statement accusing Veltmann of coaching McPherson.|$|E
5|$|On 9 March 1904 Scotia {{reached its}} most southerly {{latitude}} of 74°01'S. At this point, {{the ship was}} <b>held</b> <b>fast</b> in the pack ice, and the prospect loomed of becoming trapped for the winter. It was {{during this period of}} inactivity that bagpiper Gilbert Kerr was photographed serenading a penguin. On 13 March the ship broke free and began to move slowly north-eastward under steam. Throughout this part of the voyage a regular programme of depth soundings, trawls, and sea-bottom samples provided a comprehensive record of the oceanography and marine life of the Weddell Sea.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the war, Lyme Regis was claimed by a pair of local members of parliament, and garrisoned for the Parliamentarians. King Charles I ordered the capture of the town in early 1644, and sent his nephew, Maurice, with 5,000 troops. The siege was laid on 20 April, but despite a steady bombardment, and three {{attempts}} to storm the town by ground, the earthen defences of the town that had been established by Blake <b>held</b> <b>fast.</b> Lyme Regis was regularly re-provisioned and reinforced by sea, weakening the effectiveness of the siege, and on 14 June, Maurice withdrew from the siege {{in the face of a}} relieving army led by Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex.|$|E

5|$|In Rotterdam, though {{reinforced}} by an infantry regiment, the Dutch failed to completely dislodge the German airborne troops from their bridgehead {{on the northern}} bank of the Maas. Despite permission from General Kurt Student, the German commander in Rotterdam refused to evacuate this bridgehead and the few German defenders <b>held</b> <b>fast</b> in a single office building, protected by a canal {{in front of them}} and covered by fire from the south bank. The two remaining Dutch bombers failed to destroy the Willemsbrug. The German forces involved in the attack of the previous day on The Hague also held out, none of the attempts to eliminate the isolated groups of in total about 1600 paratroopers and airlanded forces met with success.|$|E
5|$|On 5 December 1914, Shackleton's {{expedition}} ship Endurance left South Georgia for the Weddell Sea, on {{the first}} stage of the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition. It was making for Vahsel Bay, the southernmost explored point of the Weddell Sea at 77° 49' S, where a shore party was to land and prepare for a transcontinental crossing of Antarctica. Before it could reach its destination the ship was trapped in pack ice, and by 14 February 1915 was <b>held</b> <b>fast,</b> despite prolonged efforts to free her. During the following eight months she drifted northward until, on 27 October, she was crushed by the pack's pressure, finally sinking on 21 November.|$|E
5|$|Amundsen {{was born}} in Fredrikstad (around 80km from Christiania (now Oslo)), Norway, in 1872, {{the son of a}} ship-owner. In 1893, he {{abandoned}} his medical studies at Christiania University and signed up as a seaman aboard the sealer Magdalena for a voyage to the Arctic. After several further voyages he qualified as a second mate; when not at sea, he developed his skills as a cross-country skier in the harsh environment of Norway's Hardangervidda plateau. In 1896, inspired by the polar exploits of his countryman Fridtjof Nansen, Amundsen joined the Belgian Antarctic Expedition as mate, aboard Belgica under Adrien de Gerlache. Early in 1898 the ship became trapped by pack ice in the Bellinghausen Sea, and was <b>held</b> <b>fast</b> for almost a year. The expedition thus became, involuntarily, the first to spend a complete winter in Antarctic waters, a period marked by depression, near-starvation, insanity, and scurvy among the crew. Amundsen remained dispassionate, recording everything and using the experience as an education in all aspects of polar exploration techniques, particularly aids, clothing and diet.|$|E

5|$|Following the turnover, Indiana's offense {{began work}} at its 32-yard line. Despite the {{opportunity}} {{presented by the}} interception, the Hoosiers were unable to gain a first down and punted back to Virginia Tech. Tech's Steve Sanders returned the kick to the Tech 27-yard line, and Tech's offense returned to the field. The Hokie offense was no more successful than Indiana's had been, and Tech punted after going three and out. Following the kick and a short return, the Hoosiers began work at their 41-yard line. After being stopped for no gain on two consecutive plays, Paci completed a long pass to Tech's 40-yard line for the Hoosiers' first first down of the second half. Indiana continued advancing the ball via short passes, but came up oneyard short of a first down. Instead of punting on fourth down, Indiana attempted to gain the first down via a rush up the middle. Tech's defense <b>held</b> <b>fast,</b> and Indiana turned the ball over after failing to gain the needed yard.|$|E
5|$|Indiana's defense also <b>held</b> <b>fast</b> on {{the next}} possession, and Tech was unable to gain a first down {{following}} the turnover. Tech's punt was returned to the Indiana 38-yard line, where the Hoosier offense returned to the field. At first, the Hoosiers were successful moving the ball as they picked up a first down in Tech territory via a pass from Paci. The success was short-lived, however, as the Hoosiers were unable to gain a first down once on the Tech {{side of the field}} and had to punt. Sanders returned the kick to the Tech 21-yard line, where Tech began its third possession of the second half. Tech picked up a first down via two DeShazo passes, but couldn't gain another. Tech's punt was downed at the Indiana 20-yard line, and Indiana's offense began work with 3:02 remaining in the quarter.|$|E

25|$|Connecticut {{was forced}} to {{surrender}} the Pennsylvania portion (Westmoreland County) of its sea-to-sea land grant following the Yankee-Pennamite Wars and the intercession of the federal government.

25|$|The {{importance}} of the minhag ("prevailing local custom") is also a point of dispute between Karo and Isserles: while Karo <b>held</b> <b>fast</b> to original authorities and material reasons, Isserles considered the minhag {{as an object of}} great importance, and not to be omitted in a codex. This point, especially, induced Isserles to write his glosses to the Shulchan Aruch, that the customs (minhagim) of the Ashkenazim might be recognized, and not be set aside through Karo's reputation.|$|E
25|$|The Apostolic Fathers and the Apologists mostly {{dealt with}} topics other than {{original}} sin. The doctrine {{of original sin}} was first developed in 2nd-century Bishop of Lyon Irenaeus's struggle against Gnosticism. The Greek Fathers emphasized the cosmic dimension of the fall, namely that since Adam human beings are born into a fallen world, but <b>held</b> <b>fast</b> to belief that man, though fallen, is free. It was in the West that precise definition of the doctrine arose.|$|E

25|$|Leo <b>held</b> <b>fast</b> by {{his plan}} to revive iconoclasm, and in March 815 the Patrarch Nikephoros was {{stripped}} of his office and exiled to Bithynia. At this point Theodore remained in Constantinople, and assumed {{a leading role in}} the iconodule opposition. On March 25, Palm Sunday, he commanded his monks to process through the monastery's vineyard, holding up icons so that they could be seen over the walls by the neighbors. This provocation elicited only a rebuke from the emperor.|$|E
25|$|The {{flooding}} included (from {{north to}} south, east to west), the Upper Iowa River, the Turkey, and the Maquoketa Rivers; {{outside of the}} Driftless Area, they include the catchments of the Wapsipinicon River {{and that of the}} Iowa River, to include the latter's major tributary, the Cedar River (and its significant tributaries); and the Skunk River in its various forks. The Des Moines River had some minor flooding, but floodwalls and levees for the most part <b>held</b> <b>fast.</b> The Upper Mississippi River which receives the outflow from all these rivers remained at flood stage.|$|E
25|$|Cao Cao {{followed}} this advice and <b>held</b> <b>fast</b> to his ground. In the ninth month, Xun Yu {{pointed out that}} Yuan Shao had been storing supplies at a depot {{in the village of}} Gushi (故市; southwest of present-day Yanjin County, Henan), guarded by Han Meng. Cao Cao sent out small cavalry units led by Xu Huang and Shi Huan (史渙) to attack this position. They succeeded, routing Han Meng, disrupting Yuan Shao's supply lines, and burning his grain carts. Yuan Shao was forced to call for relief supplies in response to this raid.|$|E

25|$|Whigs favored {{economic}} expansion through an activist government, Democrats through limited central government. Whigs supported corporate charters, a national bank, and paper currency; Democrats {{were opposed to}} all three. Whigs also favored more humanitarian reforms than did Democrats, including public schools, abolition of capital punishment, prison and asylum reform and temperance. Whigs were more optimistic than Democrats, generally speaking, and more enterprising. They did not object to helping a specific group if doing so would promote the general welfare. The chartering of corporations, they argued, expanded economic opportunity for everyone, laborers and farmers alike. Democrats, distrustful of concentrated economic power and of moral and economic coercion, <b>held</b> <b>fast</b> to the Jeffersonian principle of limited government.|$|E
25|$|Before {{the menace}} of Rupert's cavalry, {{to which he}} had nothing to oppose, Essex withdrew to Bedfordshire in July. He made no attempt to {{intercept}} the march of the Queen's convoys, permitting the Oxford army, which he should have <b>held</b> <b>fast,</b> to intervene effectually in the Midlands, the west, and the south-west. Waller might well complain that Essex, who still held Reading and the Chilterns, had given him neither active nor passive support in the critical days, preceding Roundway Down. Still, only a few voices were raised to demand his removal, and he was shortly to have an opportunity of proving his skill and devotion in a great campaign and a great battle.|$|E
25|$|Following her husband's death, Elizabeth made solemn vows to Konrad {{similar to}} those of a nun. These vows {{included}} celibacy, as well as complete obedience to Konrad as her confessor and spiritual director. Konrad's treatment of Elizabeth was extremely harsh, and he held her to standards of behavior which were almost impossible to meet. Among the punishments he is alleged to have ordered were physical beatings; he also ordered her to send away her three children. Her pledge to celibacy proved a hindrance to her family's political ambitions. Elizabeth was more or less held hostage at Pottenstein, the castle of her uncle, Bishop Ekbert of Bamberg, in an effort to force her to remarry. Elizabeth, however, <b>held</b> <b>fast</b> to her vow, even threatening to cut off her own nose so that no man would find her attractive enough to marry.|$|E
