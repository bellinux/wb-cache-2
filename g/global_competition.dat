5|$|After the WTO {{phased out}} {{quantitative}} quotas on textile in 2004 under the Agreement on Textile and Clothing(ATC). Egyptian textile and garment producers feared that their industry would {{be threatened by}} <b>global</b> <b>competition</b> from China and India. The flood of similar articles from these two nations to the United States could edge out Egyptian exports, and possibly result {{in the loss of}} 150,000 job opportunities. This was estimated to cost some of the $3.2 billion in US foreign direct investment in Egypt. Further, Egypt was in search of sources for increased economic growth and trade to provide jobs for its rapidly growing labor force.|$|E
5|$|Bisley and Henley {{had both}} been {{previously}} used as venues during the 1908 Games. Bisley hosted {{most of the}} shooting events while Henley hosted the rowing competition. Henley continues to host the Royal Regatta, which started in 1839, and remains in use as of 2010 for <b>global</b> <b>competition,</b> including the Diamond Sculls event. The Harringay Arena was built in 1928 and staged sporting events until its demolition in 1958. Built in 1891, the Herne Hill Velodrome hosted track cycling. After falling into disrepair by 2011, a modernization plan was implemented to make extensive structural repairs to the site and install a new track surface {{so that it could}} used by British Cycling, the national sport governing body.|$|E
5|$|With {{the rise}} of {{numerous}} regional championships, {{as well as the}} growth in Olympic-style multi-sport events (such as the Commonwealth Games and the Pan-American Games), competitions between international track and field athletes became widespread. From the 1960s onwards, the sport gained more exposure and commercial appeal through television coverage and the increasing wealth of nations. After over half a century of amateurism, the amateur status of the sport began to be displaced by growing professionalism in the late 1970s. As a result, the Amateur Athletic Union was dissolved in the United States and it was replaced with a non-amateur body solely focused on the sport of athletics: The Athletics Congress (later USA Track and Field). The IAAF soon followed suit in 1982, abandoning amateurism, and later removing all references to it from its name by rebranding itself as the International Association of Athletics Federations. The following year saw the establishment of the IAAF World Championships in Athletics—the first ever <b>global</b> <b>competition</b> just for athletics—which, with the Olympics, became one of track and field's most prestigious competitions.|$|E

5|$|In 1999, the chairman, Lord Alexander of Weedon, {{announced}} a merger with Legal & General {{in a friendly}} £10.7billion deal, the first between a bank and an insurance company in UK history. The move was poorly received in the London financial markets and NatWest's share price fell substantially. Seen as a driver of the ill-advised investment banking expansion, Derek Wanless {{was forced to resign}} as chief executive following the appointment of Sir David Rowland (who became executive chairman). Also in 1999, in response to the much reduced NatWest market capitalisation, the much smaller Bank of Scotland made a hostile takeover bid for NatWest. The Bank of Scotland's aim was to break up the NatWest Group and dispose of its non-retail assets. NatWest was forced to abandon its merger, but refused to agree to a takeover by a rival bank. The Royal Bank of Scotland tabled another hostile offer and trumped the Bank of Scotland with a £21billion bid. The takeover of NatWest in early 2000 was the biggest in UK history. National Westminster Bank, once Britain's most profitable bank, was delisted from the London Stock Exchange and became, with its subsidiaries, component parts of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group. The outcome of this bitter struggle set the tone for a round of consolidation in the financial sector as it prepared for a new age of fierce <b>global</b> <b>competition.</b> The Royal Bank of Scotland Group became the second largest bank in the UK and Europe (after HSBC) and the fifth largest in the world by market capitalisation. According to Forbes Global 2000, it was then the 13th largest company in the world. NatWest was retained as a distinct brand with its own banking licence, but many back office functions were merged with those of the Royal Bank, leading to over 18,000 job losses.|$|E

The growth in cross-border activities has also increased the demand for banks that can provide various services across borders to different nationalities.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{provides}} an ethnographic {{case study of}} everyday forms of <b>global</b> tourism <b>competition</b> in one place: La Antigua Guatemala (Antigua). Located in Central America, Guatemala is better known for poverty, violence, and insecurity than for tourism. Nonetheless, like many {{other countries in the}} global South, as part of neoliberalisation the government of Guatemala has turned to tourism as a tool of development and recently embarked on a plan to transform Guatemala into one of the world’s most visited destinations. Rather than focus on government policy, this thesis turns to the everyday discourses, imaginings, practices, and performances of <b>global</b> tourism <b>competition</b> in Antigua. Antigua-locals live and work in the ‘destino Guatemala’ project and are key stakeholders and competitive actors. Through exploring everyday forms of <b>global</b> tourism <b>competition,</b> this thesis highlights how this practice is informed by and powerfully informing of diverse, and often highly unequal, social and spatial relations, as well as local identities and subjectivities. In particular, it divulges how one’s access to different forms of (dis) embodied capitals affects, but does not determine, how one engages in <b>global</b> tourism <b>competition,</b> how successful one is likely to be at attracting/satisfying global tourists, and how participating in <b>global</b> tourism <b>competition</b> can help to produce new forms of (dis) embodied capital. Within this, the ways in which <b>global</b> tourism <b>competition</b> are imagined, experienced, utilised, challenged, and resisted are brought to the fore. In providing a rich ethnographic account of everyday <b>global</b> tourism <b>competition</b> in Antigua, this thesis highlights how <b>global</b> tourism <b>competition</b> to attract/satisfy <b>global</b> tourists is making far more than ‘destino Guatemala’...|$|R

25|$|Resurgent French armies secured {{victories}} in dynastic conflicts against the Spanish, Polish, and Austrian crowns. At the same time, France was fending off attacks on its colonies. As the 18th century advanced, <b>global</b> <b>competition</b> with Great Britain {{led to the}} Seven Years' War, where France lost its North American holdings. Consolation {{came in the form}} of dominance in Europe and the American Revolutionary War, where extensive French aid in the form of money and arms, and the direct participation of its army and navy led to America's independence. Internal political upheaval eventually led to 23 years of nearly continuous conflict in the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars. France reached the zenith of its power during this period, dominating the European continent in an unprecedented fashion under Napoleon Bonaparte. By 1815, however, it had been restored to the same borders it controlled before the Revolution. The rest of the 19th century witnessed the growth of the Second French colonial empire as well as French interventions in Belgium, Spain, and Mexico. Other major wars were fought against Russia in the Crimea, Austria in Italy, and Prussia within France itself.|$|E
