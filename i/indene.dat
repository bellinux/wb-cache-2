25|$|Naphthalene is {{the most}} {{abundant}} single component of coal tar. Although the composition of coal tar varies with the coal from which it is produced, typical coal tar is about 10% naphthalene by weight. In industrial practice, distillation of coal tar yields an oil containing about 50% naphthalene, along with twelve other aromatic compounds. This oil, after being washed with aqueous sodium hydroxide to remove acidic components (chiefly various phenols), and with sulfuric acid to remove basic components, undergoes fractional distillation to isolate naphthalene. The crude naphthalene resulting from this process is about 95% naphthalene by weight. The chief impurities are the sulfur-containing aromatic compound benzothiophene (<nbsp&2%), indane (0.2%), <b>indene</b> (<nbsp&2%), and methylnaphthalene (<nbsp&2%). Petroleum-derived naphthalene is usually purer than that derived from coal tar. Where required, crude naphthalene can be further purified by recrystallization from any {{of a variety of}} solvents, resulting in 99% naphthalene by weight, referred to as 80nbsp&°C (melting point). Approximately 1.3M tons are produced annually.|$|E
