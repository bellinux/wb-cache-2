TAC invested several million dollars renovating the base facilities, and constructed new targets on the range. But only 331 personnel were assigned to the base in 1956. The base was deactivated again in December 1957. It transferred back to Ogden on 1 January 1958 and renamed Wendover Air Force Auxiliary Field, while the range was renamed Hill Air <b>Force</b> <b>Range</b> in 1960, and inactivated in August 1961.|$|E
5|$|I-8 enters Arizona from California at the Colorado River {{bridge at}} Yuma. It {{initially}} heads south through Yuma until the interchange with US95, where the freeway begins {{to turn to}} the east and passes through eastern Yuma and Fortuna Foothills, briefly paralleling US95. West of Wellton, the highway takes a northeasterly course, paralleling the Gila River and passing to the south of Roll. Through this part of Arizona, I-8 passes along the northern edge of the Barry M. Goldwater Air <b>Force</b> <b>Range</b> and to the south of the Yuma Proving Ground. It keeps a northeastern heading, passing through the community of Dateland, until it reaches Gila Bend. There, the freeway intersects SR85 heading north to Phoenix and south to the Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument.|$|E

40|$|The {{properties}} of force-based input on a handheld device were examined. Twenty-one participants used force input to set 10 different target levels representing consecutive <b>force</b> <b>ranges</b> (0 to 4 N) with visual feedback (digits or bar graphs) or no feedback. Both accuracy and speed were greater with analog feedback (bar graph). Statistical comparisons of adjacent targets/digits indicated that subjects differentiated roughly seven input levels within {{the set of}} ten <b>force</b> <b>ranges</b> actually used. Time taken to input the target force increased significantly {{with the size of}} the target force, suggesting that smaller <b>force</b> <b>ranges</b> should be considered in future implementations of force input. The results are discussed in terms of the design of appropriate feedback for force input.

25|$|Parts of {{the refuge}} are {{sometimes}} temporarily off-limits to visitors during training exercises on the adjacent Barry M. Goldwater Air <b>Force</b> <b>Range,</b> {{or because of}} law enforcement concerns with respect to illegal trafficking of people and drugs from Mexico. Additionally, parts of the refuge are temporarily off-limits to visitors between mid-March and mid-July, during the fawning season for the Sonoran pronghorn (Antilocapra americana sonoriensis), an endangered species endemic to the Sonoran Desert. The purpose of this closure is to minimize disturbance to herds containing fawns, which can result {{in the loss of}} fawns.|$|E
25|$|By the {{afternoon}} of 24 April the Glosters, with C Troop 170th Mortar Battery now fighting alongside as infantry, {{had been reduced to}} an effective fighting force of 400–450 men and were low on ammunition, though in their favour the guns of 45 Field Regiment provided excellent support. Estimates of the opposing <b>force</b> <b>range</b> from a regiment (three battalions) to a division (three regiments). The Glosters fought through the night of 24–25 April. The peak was briefly occupied by the Chinese, thus threatening the Glosters' whole position on the hill, but was retaken by a counter-attack led by the adjutant, Captain Anthony Farrar-Hockley. The Chinese attempted to take it again, launching seven attacks in one hour, without success, and their assault on the hill was finally broken up after sunrise by airstrikes. That morning, with Chinese forces infiltrating miles behind the lines, UN forces began to withdraw to Line Delta. On Hill 235 the Glosters had very little ammunition, no hope of relief and, with 45 Field Regiment on the move, no artillery support, and at 06:05 Lt-Col Carne received permission to attempt a breakout. He {{had no choice but to}} leave the wounded, estimated at some 100, and the survivors split into small groups and attempted to evade the Chinese surrounding them to reach friendly lines. Just 63 men made it.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{transverse}} {{interaction between}} {{a bunch of}} charged particles and cylindrically symmetric accelerating structures is studied in three steps. The particle motion is influenced by short <b>range</b> <b>forces</b> and long <b>range</b> <b>forces.</b> The short <b>range</b> <b>forces</b> are calculated by solving Maxwell's equation in the time domain including the presence of free moving charges passing an arbitrarily shaped structure off axis. The long <b>range</b> <b>forces</b> are dominated by resonant modes in cavities. These forces are computed in frequency domain by evaluating eigenmodes and eigenfrequencies. Since only high energy particlea are considered, the particle motion, which is affected by both forces, can be studied seperately using models and computer simulations. This first paper deals with the computation of short <b>range</b> <b>forces...</b>|$|R
500|$|The {{southern}} terminus of SR85 {{is located}} at the United States-Mexico border near Lukeville in Pima County. The road continues across the border into Mexico to the town of Sonoita as Mexican Federal Highway 8. SR85 heads north from the border as a two-lane road, passing through the Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument. The highway leaves the monument boundary and heads to a junction with SR86 in Why. SR86 heads east from this junction towards Tucson and southeastern Arizona. SR85 heads northwest from this junction to the town of Ajo. From Ajo, the highway heads north and enters the Barry M. Goldwater Air <b>Force</b> <b>Range.</b> While within the range, the highway enters Maricopa County. After the highway passes through the range, it continues towards the north to a junction with I-8 in Gila Bend. After passing I-8, the highway intersects the business loop of I-8 and turns towards the east to run concurrently with business loop along Pima Street in Gila Bend. The two highways split, with the business loop heading towards the southeast and SR85 heading northeast providing access to Gila Bend Municipal Airport ...|$|E

2500|$|However, in 1961 President John F. Kennedy {{ordered the}} United States Department of the Interior to {{implement}} measures to stop soil erosion on federal land. [...] On the Pryor Mountains range, {{where there were}} about 140 to 200 horses, BLM ordered in 1964 that the horses be removed. Fearful that the horses {{were not going to}} be stabled but that the roundup was a prelude to slaughter of the entire herd, in 1966 Johnston began a letter-writing and public relations campaign against the BLM. Johnston's goal was the establishment of a permanent refuge for the Pryor Mountains herd, but this was a daunting task. Hunting and ranching lobby groups had strongly opposed establishment of a feral horse refuge in Nevada, and only accepted creation of the Nevada Wild Horse Range in 1962 because it was within the Nellis Air <b>Force</b> <b>Range</b> area of [...] (renamed Nevada Test and Training Range in 2001). In 1965, Johnston founded the International Society for the Protection of Mustangs and Burros (ISPMB), a nonprofit group dedicated to educating the public about the plight of feral horses and burros, which and lobbied Congress and the executive branch for their protection on public land. Johnston and her group had several local allies as well. They included Bessie Tillett (a widowed rancher's wife in her 80s) and her sons, Royce and Lloyd Tillett. The Tilletts tried to protect the feral horses beginning in 1964, claiming them as their own and threatening BLM officials who tried to remove the herd from land the Tilletts leased from BLM. (The Tilletts also kept feral horses from the herd on their private land, and began adopting them out.) BLM officials suspended the Tilletts' lease in 1966 (the reason was inadequate fencing), forcing the family to give up their claim to many horses. Others who wanted to protect the herd included ranchers and the people of nearby Lovell, Wyoming, who saw the horses not only as part of Western heritage but also a major tourist attraction. The ISPMB and its allies proved highly effective in raising public awareness of the issue and building political support for their efforts, and in 1966 BLM suspended its plans for the roundup.|$|E
