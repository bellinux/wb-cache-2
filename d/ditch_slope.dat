40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} two types of ditch management on the species richness and abundance of mammals at two sites in an agricultural landscape in Flevoland, The Netherlands. The first management type involved mowing both <b>ditch</b> <b>slopes</b> twice per year with a flailmower and leaving the biomass on the spot (control sections; n= 3 at Tureluurweg site, n= 6 at Waiboerhoeve site). Here the vegetation was short throughout winter. The second management type involved mowing the two <b>ditch</b> <b>slopes</b> in alternate years and removing the biomass (reed sections; n= 3 at Tureluurweg, n= 6 at Waiboerhoeve). This resulted in reed cover (Phragmites australis) at one ditch side in winter. Species richness and abundance of mammals were investigated through sightings and trapping along the ditches and in the adjacent production grasslands. Species richness and overall abundance were highest in the reed sections. Common voles (Microtus arvalis), harvest mice (Micromys minutus) and common shrews (Sorex araneus) occurred mostly in the ditches, especially in the reed sections. Only common voles were also frequently found in the grasslands but here their density was lower than along the ditches. A male-biased sex ratio in the production grasslands also indicated that these were a poor habitat for this species. Although reduced clearing frequency of the ditches benefited the common vole, outbreaks seem unlikely {{as long as the}} grasslands continue to be used intensively. Low management costs and possible application of reed biomass on arable land could also ensure a rapid integration of nature-oriented ditch management into existing farming systems...|$|R

40|$|The {{combination}} of runoff-generating areas (saturated soils) and overland flow concentration in {{features such as}} drainage <b>ditches</b> makes <b>sloping</b> farmland vulnerable to soil erosion. The establishment of drainage ditches aims at draining the excess {{of water from the}} farmland, particularly in areas where soils are saturated in the rainy season. The hydrogeomorphic impacts on the farmland itself and on downstream areas need however also to be studied. Off site, downstream problems comprise higher peak discharges, leading to gully initiation, an increase in sediment load, and flooding problems. On-site problems such as the development of the drainage ditches into (ephemeral) gullies are less documented, although they may be important, as illustrated in the Lake Tana Basin (Ethiopia). The similarities and interactions between ephemeral gully channels and drainage ditches have to be considered to better understand all effects of drainage. Drainage ditches are a potential source of conflict between farmers with different interests and power, as well as between upstream and downstream users.

40|$|International audienceAbstractAgriculture {{must now}} feed the planet {{with the lowest}} {{environmental}} impact. Landscape management is a means to protect natural resources from the adverse impacts. In particular, the adequate management of ditches could improve crop quality. Here, we review ditch design and maintenance. We found the following major points: (1) ditch networks have been primarily designed for waterlogging control and erosion prevention. Nonetheless, when properly managed, farm ditches provide other important ecosystem services, namely groundwater recharge, flood attenuation, water purification, or biodiversity conservation. (2) All ditch ecosystem services depend on many geochemical, geophysical, and biological processes, whose occurrence and intensity vary largely with ditch characteristics. (3) The major ruling characteristics are vegetative cover; <b>ditch</b> morphology; <b>slope</b> orientation; reach connections such as piped sections and weirs, soil, sediment and litter properties, biota, and biofilms; and network topology. (4) Ditch maintenance is an efficient engineering tool to optimize ecosystem services because several ditch characteristics change widely with ditch maintenance. For instance, maintenance operations, dredging, chemical weeding, and burning improve waterlogging and soil erosion control, but they are negative for biodiversity conservation. Mowing has low adverse effects on biodiversity conservation and water purification when mowing is performed at an adequate season. The effects of burning have been poorly investigated...|$|R

Sjeverno od broda gotičke crkve istraženi su posljednji grobovi te pojedini i od njih stariji ukopi. Dokumentirani su i uklonjeni kulturni slojevi – srednjovjekovni i rimski – iz kojih su ponovno prikupljeni nalazi keramike i kućnoga lijepa. Istočno od sjeverne kule je do kraja istražen i posljednji sloj koji je sprečavao osipavanje padina jarka. Zapadno od sjeverne kule je otkriven čitav kompleks novovjekovnih zidova i drugih struktura zapunjenih obiljem materijala, prvenstveno ulomcima keramičkih posuda i pećnjaka. Postoji mogućnost da su te duboko ukopane strukture u potpunosti poništile pretpostavljeni temelj pročelja romaničke crkve.

In {{the period}} between May 23, 2011 and June 11, 2011 the tenth stage of the archaeological {{excavations}} at the site Stari Grad in Ivanec was conducted by the Institute of Archaeology. On this occasion, the research of some previously opened sectors was finished, and few new probes were opened. The graves found north of the nave of the Gothic church were explored {{as well as some}} of the older burials. In total, so far, 55 graves were explored in the sector north of the nave; based on their mutual relations and the difference established between the individual phases of burials they were chronologically divided into three groups. Cultural layers have been documented and removed - black, medieval, and brown, Roman - from which pieces of pottery and daub were collected. The remains of three large circular cut with the diameter of cca 40 cm, older than the graves excavated earlier and younger than the Medieval cultural layer, were established and excavated - they probably represent traces of an older wooden architecture. East of the Northern tower the last layer which prevented the <b>ditch</b> <b>slopes</b> from drifting was excavated. West of the Northern tower a complex of Modern Era walls and other structures filled with abundance of material, primarily fragments of ceramic vessels and tiles, was discovered. There is a possibility that these deeply buried structures completely annihilated the foundation of an assumed facade of a Romanesque church. The exploration of the defensive wall was also undertaken. Along its northern face a two meters wide probe was open which, together with the material left behind by the inhabitants of Stari Grad, provides an insight into an intense architectural activity during the Modern Era.

40|$|Drainage {{alters the}} carbon storage and {{accumulation}} functions of peatlands, but {{the long-term effects}} of drainage ditches, and their restoration, on peatland development are poorly understood. Timescales of monitoring studies in ditch-drained and restored peatlands are typically limited to a few years, and occasionally decades. In addition, experimental studies seldom monitor spatial changes in peat structure caused by ditches, despite such changes affecting water flow and water retention in peat. Ecosystem models offer an alternative to experimental studies and can help explain how complex systems such as peatlands may respond to external disturbances. Here we report on a 2 D application of a peatland development model (DigiBog) to explore how contour-parallel ditches, and their damming, affect the ecohydrology of peatlands over decades to centuries, using blanket peatlands as a case study. Drainage resulted in the rapid loss of peat due to increased oxic decay. The majority of these losses occurred in the first 100 years after the ditch was created, but water table dynamics were altered even centuries later. Restoration halted the loss of peat and encouraged net peat accumulation, although the amount lost in 100 years of drainage had not been replaced 200 years after the ditch was dammed. Restoration of <b>ditches</b> in <b>sloping</b> peatlands brought about more peat regrowth downslope of the restored ditch than further upslope.

40|$|In Sweden and in Finland large forest {{areas have}} been ditched to {{increase}} forestproductivity. In Sweden more than 1. 5 million ha forest have been ditched with a total lengthof about 220 000 km ditches for the last 100 years. Forest drainage ditching results in theerosion of minerals and humus from the <b>ditch</b> <b>slopes</b> and further transport of the erodedmaterial with the ditch water. This probably affects the biological and ecological conditions inthe ditches and brooks due to increased turbidity and sedimentation. Such adverse effects canpotentially be prevented by particle filters. In 2005 - 2007, the Swedish Forestry Board built ca 80 particle filters in Northern Sweden. The effects of these particle filters on water quality arehowever unknown. If ditching is done in acid sulphate soils in areas of for example isostaticland uplift {{there is also a}} risk of acidification, which potentially can lead to leakage of metals. The aim {{of the study was to}} evaluate if particle filters in forest drainage ditches improve waterquality. The study was performed in a ditch in Alvik, Luleå municipality, during May toNovember 2007 and in three ditches in Tärendö, Pajala municipality in October 2007. TheAlvik catchment is characterized by sulphide soils. In Alvik, only suspended materialdecreased significantly after the second particle filter during the study period. All otherinvestigated elements were unaffected by the particle filters. There were no differences in thewater levels before and after the particle filters, which indicates that the particle filters weretoo loosely packed. The effect of the ditches in Tärendö was difficult to assess. In one ditchboth of the particle filters were flooded and in another ditch, two of three particle filters wereflooded. In the third ditch there was almost no flow. On the basis of this study it is hard to saywhich benefit the particle filters constitute. The construction of the particle filters seams to becritical for their function. In Alvik, the particle filters probably were too loosely packed and inTärendö the particle filters were too small for working satisfactorily. The influence of the acid sulphate soil was significant in the Alvik ditch. The pH waslowest during May (mean 4. 5), at the same time sulphur and metal concentrations were high(S mean 17 mg/l, Al mean 2464 μg/l and Zn mean 41 μg/l). During summer (June-September) the pH increased and sulphur and metal concentrations decreased (pH mean 6. 2, S mean 10 mg/l, Al mean 950 μg/l and Zn mean 15 μg/l). In November the trend reversed again, pHdecreased and sulphur and metal concentrations increased again to the highest values for someelements (pH mean 4. 8, S mean 24 mg/l, Al mean 2880 μg/l and Zn mean 47 μg/l). pH wassignificantly negatively correlated with S and with several metals (Al, Cd, Co, Mg, Mn, Niand Zn). Sulphur and the metals were significantly correlated to each other. These resultssuggest that sulphate oxidation occurred in the soil which affected the geochemistry in theditch water. After drainage ditching the groundwater level sinks and the sulphate soils areoxidised. After oxidation, hydrogen ions and metal ions leach from the soils when the soilsagain are saturated by melt water. Because of this, the pH will decrease and further metal ionsare leaching from the soils. The leaching and transport of metals from the ditch in Alvik wassignificant. The transport of S in November was estimated to be ca. 11 kg/day. The annualaverage transport of S was ca. 2200 kg/year from the ditch in Alvik. The transport of metals inNovember in Alvik was for Al ca. 1 kg/day, for Zn 22 g/day and for Cd 64 mg/day. Theresults suggest that drainage ditching in areas containing acid sulphate soils should beavoided. Validerat; 20110630 (anonymous...|$|R

For a long time, Mediterranean farmers have thus adopted some soil conservation practices. Actual ditch networks, which are generally associated with terraces, result from historical successive farmer settlements and are one of these soil conservation practices. By intercepting surface run-off, <b>ditches</b> decrease <b>slope</b> length and prevent soil erosion on downstream plots. However, since water erosion hazard and ditch network geometries are highly variable in vineyards landscape and since ditch building and maintaining are costly, the objective {{of this study was to}} identify and map the resulting efficiency of ditch networks in preventing soil erosion. For a given area, a ditch network efficiency is defined here as the balance between the network density, i. e. network cumulated length for a given area unit, and the erosion sensitivity over an area which measures the performance of the ditch network in limiting soil erosion. The erosion efficiency of ditch networks was thus identified using both i) computer generated ditch networks with various spatial configurations and ii) the stream power index as an erosion sensitivity indicator, computed from a DTM in which each ditch network was burned. The stream power index of the actual networks were compared with a set of generated networks whose density and topology were selected to maximize the performance in preventing soil erosion thanks to the use of a self-developed optimized stochastic network generator. For four 1 km 2 hillslopes, we showed that the performances of actual networks to prevent soil erosion was among the best that were obtained by simulated networks with even greater densities. Furthermore, we showed that the stream power index values that accounted for the actual ditch networks to prevent soil erosion hazard was both minimal and weakly variable in the whole study area (30 km 2) at hillslope scale, whatever the other erosion factors, namely topography and landuse. This suggested that densities and topologies of actual ditch networks in the catchment have been optimized by farmers through individual acts along the last centuries in order to limit the soil erosion hazard. This also confirms there is very little room to propose new ditch network spatial configurations that better prevent vineyards soil erosion...|$|R

40|$|In {{the past}} the {{spoonbill}} Platalea leucorodia used to breed in the Netherlands in far larger numbers than it does today. Recently {{the cause of the}} drastic fall in numbers was pollution of the environment with chlorinated hydrocarbons (Rooth and Jonkers, 1972) during the years 1963 to 1970 (Fig. 1) Since 1970 the population has been recovering and numbers are increasing. Especially on the Waddensea-islands the increase in numbers of breeding pairs is striking. At several places new colonies have been established. At the moment the spoonbill are breeding in seven colonies all situated in the north-western part of the Netherlands (Fig. 2). Nevertheless, the total number is still much lower than {{at the turn of the}} century, or even shortly after the second world war. During the last thirty years the mainland of North-Holland, which forms the the most important foraging area during the breeding season, changed drastically. About 25 % of the suitable foraging-areas with shallow waters and small ditches have vanished, owing to changes in agricultural management and urbanization. One of the changes is the artificial manipulation of the water-level. Due to this, many shallow ditches with flat beds and edges sloping gradually, have been replaced by straight deep <b>ditches</b> with steep <b>slopes.</b> In these <b>ditches</b> a strict schedule of a low winter-level (10 to 15 cm) and a steep increase to a high summer-level (20 to 40 cm.) is maintained. Other measures are the reduction of the number of sluices used for water-management and the special measures taken to prevent salt water from penetrating into the mainland. This (for instance) makes it impossible for the migrating three-spined stickleback Gasterosteus aculeatus to enter the fresh water in early spring and causes changes in the stickleback population (Wooton, 1976; Baggerman, 1957; Mullem and van der Vlugt, 1964). Fortunately the foraging-areas on the tidal flats of North-Holland and Texel remained intact and there are no indications at hand of big changes in the prey population (c. q. Crangon crangon) ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis reviews {{algorithms}} {{that have}} been developed for classifying lidar data and identifies a progressive morphological filter for evaluation and improvement. Two potential weaknesses evaluated include the row-column order bias and grid orientation bias. Four different row-column orderings were developed to test for bias associated with the order choice. Moreover, a method rotating the filter grid to a series of angles was developed for testing bias associated with grid orientation. Measures of success of the improvements include Type I and II errors, where results are compared with a hand-produced 2 ̆ 2 truth 2 ̆ 2 dataset. Two datasets, one urban, the other rural, were selected for testing the modified filters. The results are presented and discussed for each algorithm. It was found that the four row-column orders all classified the dataset exactly the same. After the erosion and dilation functions were completed, the same surface profiles and elevations were produced regardless of row-column ordering. The filter windows used by the algorithm were found to create a rectangular area where the minimum and maximum values within that area were always selected. Therefore, {{it was found that the}} row-column orders did not create a bias in the classification. However, grid orientation was found to greatly affect results. Misclassification problems occurred at ridgelines, mounds, and along roads with <b>ditches</b> and steep <b>slopes</b> running along them. Grid angles running parallel to these objects were found to avoid these errors. Buildings also created errors, but were minimized with grid angles crossing them at 45 degrees. The selected angle directions significantly affect the classification results in all cases. Therefore, the grid orientation bias was verified. Two new methods of combining the results from the various angles have been developed. The first method used the best two classifying angles to combine the results. Best results were found in datasets with terrain objects positioned in similar directions for this method. The Multiple Angle method used all of the angle classifications to combine the results. This method performed best on datasets with terrain objects oriented in numerous directions. More accurate terrain models and better overall classification results have been generated using these methods...|$|R
40|$|The {{streams and}} rivers of the Ozark Plateaus are an unrivaled natural {{resource}} for the region. They provide habitat {{to some of the}} North America’s most abundant and rich biodiversity, while also serving as water sources for human drinking, agricultural, and recreational needs. The Nature Conservancy (TNC) has identified several priority watersheds through its Ozarks Ecoregional Conservation Assessment of 2003, where it focuses its on-the ground conservation planning and implementation efforts. Sedimentation from unpaved roads is a primary threat to water quality in Ozark streams. TNC has partnered with various organizations including the US Forest Service (USFS), the Watershed Conservation Resource Center (WCRC), and others to develop a multi-phased approach to address the impacts of unpaved roads on these priority watersheds. The first step in the approach utilizes advanced GIS/GPS technologies to develop a detailed vehicle-based road inventory of the target watershed or subwatershed. Sub-meter differential GPS with customized data dictionaries are used to characterize the location and function of sediment-producing and conveying features of the road infrastructure, including the road surface, prism and <b>slope,</b> <b>ditches,</b> bars, lead-offs, culverts, crossings, and outlets. The road inventory yields a comprehensive geodatabase and map series of the mapped features. A stratified random sample of the inventoried road network is then measured to generate sediment yield predictions on ten percent of the road network. Detailed field measurements are collected with differential GPS and customized data dictionaries. The data are entered into the Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) model, a process-based erosion prediction model developed by multiple federal agencies over the past 20 years. With sediment yields predicted for sample sites, erosion predictions are then extrapolated for the entire study watershed using the road inventory geodatabase. Once sedimentation yields are predicted for each road segment in the entire study area, priority sub-watersheds are identified in the GIS using watershed sediment accumulation tools. These sub-watersheds with high potential for sediment yield may be compared to species inventory data, stream bank erosion surveys, and other land use information to set priorities for conservation planning and prioritization efforts. Priority infrastructure maintenance improvements are also identified through features that were flagged in the road inventory geodatabase as needing repair or replacement. Road maintenance workshops are held with USFS engineers, county road crews, and other partners to transfer the inventory information, present the findings of the study and to demonstrate best management practices for road maintenance. Since 2004, TNC and its partners in the Arkansas have worked in three priority Ozark watersheds to inventory over 600 miles of unpaved roads and 3000 associated point features in an area greater than 900 square miles. The area comprises over thirty 6 th level (12 -digit) HUCs...|$|R
40|$|For nearly 30 {{years the}} {{departments}} of the above mentioned ministry are temporary housed in former German barracks located along the Van Alkemadelaan. Allthough the municipality of The Hague {{is the owner of}} the site, the site is part of adjacent municipality of Wassenaar. Wassenaar insists to terminate the suboptimal use of a valuable park site. For political reasons the cabinet moves larger governmental organisations towards weaker regions in the country: the ABP state pension fund is moved to Heerlen in the South, a large part op PTT (later KPN) is moved north to Groningen. The Ministry of Housing and the Ministry of Education where to be moved east to Zoetermeer. Being both an employee of the department of Housing and a student and involved in the process of restructuring, possible locations in Zoetermeer have been compared to possible locations in The Hague. The existing The Hague/Wassenaar site proves to the only one large enough and possesses already attractive park and vegetations qualities that can meet the municipality of Wassenaar's concern to largely improve the townscape. As governmental organisation trend to change due to the formation of new cabinets and change of society, a design for a very flexible building was developed. All present procedures, flows of people, files and information have been investigated. Both flexible and efficient structures have been tested. At the same time departments fit to open plan offices have been determined. Architects planning to built other new departments have been consulted. Official standards on use of space have been compared to costs collected from the present governmental budget. Resulted an ideal rather flat 5 storey overall building shape that is easily absorbed by the landscape including <b>slopes,</b> <b>ditches</b> and large trees. Patio's provide both daylight and views to green areas as Dutch rules forbid working stations lacking these. Areas on the top floors are rare; the majority of officials is to be located on a "raised" ground floor over a parking area, utilities and central facilities. In order to develop an efficient load bearing structure and column pattern areas needed and structural possibilities have been studied in a greater extend also related to economic factors, building techniques and flexibility towards installations. As a result prefabricated concrete slabs connected to pairs of mushroom shaped columns have been developed using computer animations that calculated both strength and stability. Related to the energy optimal building shape an all air conditioned system is designed to maintain optimal climate conditions, related to heat produced by light fixtures and despite the (then) present political unwillingness to accept air conditioning systems. Energy efficiency is reached due to reuse of energy, a well considered situation towards radiation from the sun, using the building mass for accumulation and a high level of insulation and good natural ventilation. The safety for the occupants is guarded by fire compartments. The character for the facades reflects demands from seeked optimal relation towards the park and demands from an energy, maintenance and cleaning point of view. The interior architecture reflects the open and flexible character of the building, the chosen load bearing and energy efficient structure. Traditional Dutch building materials are exposed in combination with progressive Dutch office furniture design.

5000|$|After the Roman {{withdrawal}} from Britain around 410, {{the area of}} Mamucium was used for agricultural purposes. It has sometimes been identified with the Cair Maunguid listed among the 28 cities of Britain by the History of the Britons traditionally attributed to Nennius. After lying derelict for centuries, the ruins were commented on by antiquarians John Leland in the 16th century, William Camden in the late 16th and early 17th centuries, and William Stukeley and the Manchester historian John Whitaker in the 18th century. In the early 18th century, John Horsley said: It the fort is {{about a quarter of}} a mile out of the town, being south or south-west from it. The station now goes by the name of Giant's Castle or Tarquin's Castle,and the field in which it stands is called Castle Field ... the ramparts are still very conspicuous. John Horsley, Britannia Romana Whitaker described what remained of the fort in 1773: The eastern side, like the Western, is hundred and forty yards in length, and for eighty yards from the northern termination, the nearly perpendicular rampart carries a crest of more than two yards in height. It is then lowered to form the great entrance, the Porta Pretoria of the camp: the earth there running in a ridge, and mounting up to the top of the bank, about ten in breadth. Then, rising gradually as the wall falls away, it carries an height of more than three for as many as the south-eastern angle. And the whole of this wall, bears a broken line of thorns above, shews the mortar peeping here and there under the coat of turf, and near the south-eastern corner has a large buttress of earth continued several yards along it. The southern side, like the Northern, is hundred and seventy five yards in length; and the rampart sinking immediately from its elevation at the eastern end, successively declines, till, about fifty yards off, it is reduced to the inconsiderable height of less than one yard. And about seventeen yards further, there appears to have been a second gateway, the ground rising up to the crest of the bank of a four or five at the point ...On the south side was particularly requisite ... in order to afford a passage to the river; but about fifty three yards beyond the gates, the ground betwixt both falling away briskly to the west, the rampart, which continues in a right line along the ridge, necessarily rises till it has a sharp slope of twenty yards in length at the southwestern angle. And all this side of the wall, which was from the beginning probably not much higher than it is at present, as it was sufficiently secured by the river and its banks, before it appears crested at first with a hedge of thorns, a young oak rising from the ridge and rearing its head considerably over the rest, and runs afterwards in a smooth line near the level for several yards with the ground about it, and just perceptible to the eye, in a rounded eminence of turfAs to the south-western point of the camp, the ground slopes away on the west towards the south, as well as on the south towards the West. On the third side still runs from it nearly as at first , having an even crest about seven feet in height, an even slope of turf for its whole extent, and the wall in all its original condition below. About a hundred yards beyond the angle was the Porta Decumana of the station, the ground visibly rising up the ascent of the bank in a large shelve of gravel, and running in a slight but perceivable ridge from it. And beyond a level of forty five yards, that still stretches on for the whole length of the side, it was bounded by the western boundary of the British city, the sharp slope of fifty to the morass below it. On the northern and remaining side are several chasms in the original course of the ramparts. And in one of them about a hundred and seventy five yards from its commencement, was another gateway, opening into the station directly from the road to Ribchester. The rest of the wall still rises above five and four feet in height, planted all the way with thorns above, and exhibiting a curious view of the rampart below. Various parts of it have been fleeced of their facing a turf and stone, and now show the inner structure of the whole, presenting to the eye the undressed stone of the quarry, the angular pieces of rock, and the round boulders of the river, all bedded in the mortar, and compacted into one. And the white and brown patches of mortar and stone on a general view of the wall stands strikingly contrasted with the green turf that entirely conceals the level line, and with the green moss that half reveals the projecting points of the rampart. The great foss of the British city, the Romans preserved along their northern side for more than thirty yards along the eastern end of it, and for the whole beyond the Western. And as the present appearances of the ground intimate, they closed the eastern point of it with a high bank, which was raised upon one part of the <b>ditch</b> and <b>sloped</b> away into the other.

40|$|As long linear ecosystems, {{rivers and}} streams are {{particularly}} vulnerable to fragmentation. There is growing concern {{about the role of}} road crossings – and especially culverts – in altering habitats and disrupting river and stream continuity. The River and Stream Continuity Project began in the year 2000 with a startup grant from the Massachusetts Watershed Initiative. The University of Massachusetts took the lead in convening a group of people from a variety of agencies and organizations who were concerned about the impact of road-stream crossings on fish and other aquatic organism passage. In 2005, three of the organizations/agencies that were key players in initiating and implementing the project joined to create the River and Stream Continuity Partnership. Founding members of the Partnership include: • UMass Extension (University of Massachusetts Amherst) • Massachusetts Riverways Program (MA Department of Fish and Game) and • The Nature Conservancy Members of the Partnership have made a commitment to the ongoing implementation of the River and Stream Continuity Project, including updates and revisions to the MA River and Stream Crossing Standards, coordination and implementation of volunteer assessments, management of the Continuity database, and projects to upgrade or replace substandard crossing structures. Since its beginning, the River and Stream Continuity Project has: • Developed “Massachusetts River and Stream Crossing Standards” to facilitate river and stream continuity as well as fish and wildlife passage. These standards are referenced in federal and state regulations and policies affecting road-stream crossings. • Created a field protocol for volunteer assessment of road-stream crossings, including data forms, instructions, and training materials. • Developed a system for scoring crossing structures for their effects on river and stream continuity and aquatic organism passage based on volunteer assessments. • Created an online database for data on road-stream crossings collected by volunteers. All crossings are geo-refer enced and information from the database can be easily used in a GIS to depict the location and score of all as sessed structures in participating states. • Developed a statewide GIS coverage prioritizing all mapped stream segments in Massachusetts into three catego ries based on information about their importance for fish and wildlife. • Conducted volunteer assessments of road-stream crossings in Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Vermont and New Hampshire. • Initiated demonstration projects to mitigate known barriers to aquatic organism passage on high-priority streams. • Developed workshops, presentations and other educational material on the subject of river and stream continuity and the Massachusetts River and Stream Crossing Standards.

40|$|Cue: One of {{the most}} popular methods of {{trapping}} rainwater in fields, particularly on sloping land, is through the use of contour ridges or bunds. These are raised ridges of soil or rock constructed across the slope, which stop the flow of run off, thereby encouraging water to infiltrate into the soil and preventing soil erosion. Another method is to dig a <b>ditch</b> across the <b>slope.</b> As with the contour ridge, the ditch must not go up or down, but must be perfectly level, to prevent the rain water accumulating in one place; for this reason they are called ?level ditches?. Water collects in the ditch and slowly seeps into the ground: this water then moves down the slope through the soil and is available for plants. Many farmers use level ditches to irrigate either fruit trees or fodder shrubs for livestock, which they plant in a line just below the ditch. Martin Sishekanu is the chief agricultural specialist responsible for land husbandry in the Zambian agriculture ministry. He spoke recently to Chris Kakunta about steps to encourage rainwater harvesting in hilly areas {{in the eastern part of}} the country. Chris began by asking him what technologies the Ministry was promoting, particularly to those cultivating fruit trees and fodder shrubs. IN:		?One, if it is a sloping ground?? OUT:		??consider the area of water harvesting. ? DUR?N:	 5 ? 54 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Martin Sishekanu, a land husbandry specialist with the Zambian Ministry of Agriculture. The interview comes from a radio resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Sishekanu	One, if it is a sloping ground, we would like to break the slope by having a storm drain constructed by the foot of the hill. This storm drain, once it is constructed it will stop the water which comes and runs which adds also to the erosion of the ground, it stops it, it breaks the energy that erodes the soil and it gently and safely takes this water. Now where we take the water is important. In most cases we use natural depressions, and in some cases we can even divert this water into a water reservoir where we can store the water, which we can use eventually, even during the dry season, for irrigating our fruit trees. And in some cases we use level ditches. Now when the slope is not that great, when we use a level ditch, what we are doing is we would like to intercept the water that would have gotten lost and temporarily store this water, to allow it to filter into the ground. And as the water filters into the ground, it moves slowly down the slope and when we have our tree crops planted below this ditch, the tree crops will be continuously receiving the water that has been allowed to be stored in the ground. Kakunta	That is very interesting Mr Sishekanu. Is it a system that you have been advising small-scale farmers to do here in Eastern Province? Sishekanu	Yes in Eastern Province we have advised some farmers, particularly in the area of the utilisation of level ditches, which you can put and dig along the contour to store some water which eventually will be able to recharge the underground water system and make available some water during the dry season below where the ditch is. And then in some cases, like in the area of Chipangali, actually there is a rock that we have harvested water from. Using that rock catchment, we have put a rim, a small block where we have captured this water. Instead of the water coming from the rock to run and erode fields, we have diverted it into a water tank and from this water tank farmers are tapping the water to be able to apply in their fields. Kakunta	Is this a new technology we are talking about? Because most often, like you indicated, rainwater is actually let go without being tapped the way you have explained? Sishekanu	Well to some extent we may call it new but it is an old system. If you remember, even in the villages when the rain is falling you will find that we put either dishes or buckets by the corners of our houses and we capture water. That is already water harvesting. So the technology is old, but it is the mechanism in which to use and tap this water and utilise it for our own betterment that might be termed as new. Kakunta	Now what are some of the benefits for a small-scale farmer to use this system that you have recommended in terms of raising fruit trees as well as fodder crops for livestock? Sishekanu	The benefit is basically that without water our tree crops will not perform very well and therefore when we tap this water it will enhance the productivity of our trees and shrubs such that at the time when the browsing material in the natural environment is completely dry, there will still be some moisture that will be still available to support the growth of the shrubs from which we can be able to support our livestock. Kakunta	Wonderful. Now what type of physical factors do you need to establish the system for it to actually work out well for the small-scale farmer? Sishekanu	Well basically the level ditches would require that the area has some sandy-related soils where it is not going to over flood; it will be able to absorb the water and allow it to infiltrate. Now in the case of where run off might be higher because of clay soils, particularly when there is also a hill, we will need to capture that water and divert it safely. At the same time, there is also the system where you dig ditches. These ditches will also be capturing water and you plant your fruit trees just by the side of the ditch and in some clay soils that will be quite handy and helpful. Kakunta	So from your own experiences here in Eastern Province, what lessons have you learnt in terms of rainwater harvesting which are practically useful for the small-scale farmers? Sishekanu	The level ditch system has been practically useful for the small-scale farmers because it helps to recharge the underground water reservoir and therefore, even where they have shallow wells, the shallow wells will be facilitated to receive water for a longer period of time than when they are absent. Kakunta	Is there anything that I have left out that you would like to put across in as far as the subject rainwater harvesting is concerned? Sishekanu	Basically I would say that if we harvest the water we will reduce the destruction of our soils and meanwhile we will enhance the productivity of our crops and therefore it will be important that we consider the area of water harvesting. End of track. On <b>sloping</b> land, storm <b>ditches</b> can protect land from erosion, while level ditches increase infiltration of rainwater runoff...|$|R
