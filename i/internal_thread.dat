40|$|Abstract- The present work {{focus on}} Experimental {{investigation}} of heat transfer and friction factor characteristics of horizontal circular pipe using <b>internal</b> <b>threads</b> of pitch 1 cm and 0. 5 cm with air as the working fluid. The flow regime is selected {{for this study}} with the Reynolds number range 17, 000 to 30, 000. The horizontal aluminum pipe was subjected to constant and uniform heat flux. The experimental data obtained were compared with those obtained from plain Horizontal pipe. The effects of <b>internal</b> <b>threads</b> of varying pitch on heat transfer and friction factor were presented. Based on the same pumping power consumption, the pipe with <b>internal</b> <b>threads</b> possesses the highest performance factors for turbulent flow. The heat transfer coefficient enhancement for <b>internal</b> <b>threads</b> is higher than that for plain pipe for a given Reynolds number.

The abutment is seated on the implant, a screw passes through the abutment to secure it to an <b>internal</b> <b>thread</b> on the implant (lag-screw). There are variations on this, such as when the abutment and implant body are one piece or when a stock (prefabricated) abutment is used. Custom abutments can be made by hand, as a cast metal piece or custom milled from metal or zirconia, all of which have similar success rates.|$|E

2500|$|The tooling {{used for}} thread milling can be solid or indexable. For {{internal}} threads, solid cutters are generally limited to holes larger than , and indexable <b>internal</b> <b>thread</b> cutting tools {{are limited to}} holes larger than [...] The advantage {{is that when the}} insert wears out it is easily and more cost effectively replaced. The disadvantage is the cycle time is generally longer than solid tools. Note that solid multiple-form thread cutting tools look similar to taps, but they differ in that the cutting tool does not have a backtaper and there is not a lead-in chamfer. This lack of a lead-in chamfer allows the threads to be formed within one pitch length of the bottom of a blind hole.|$|E
2500|$|Single-point threading, also colloquially called single-pointing (or just {{thread cutting}} when the context is implicit), is an {{operation}} that uses a single-point tool to produce a thread form on a cylinder or cone. The tool moves [...] while the precise rotation of the workpiece determines {{the lead of the}} thread. The process can be done to create external or internal threads (male or female). In external thread cutting, the piece can either be held in a chuck or mounted between two centers. With <b>internal</b> <b>thread</b> cutting, the piece is held in a chuck. The tool moves across the piece linearly, taking chips off the workpiece with each pass. Usually 5 to 7 light cuts create the correct depth of the thread.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{variant of}} form-milling {{involves}} holding the cutter's axis orthogonally (no canting to the thread's helix angle) and feeding the cutter in a toolpath that will generate the thread. The part {{is usually a}} stationary workpiece, such as a boss on a valve body (in external thread milling) or a hole in a plate or block (in <b>internal</b> <b>thread</b> milling). This type of thread milling uses essentially the same concept as contouring with an endmill or ball-nose mill, but the cutter and toolpath are arranged specifically to define the [...] "contour" [...] of a thread. The toolpath is achieved either using helical interpolation (which is circular interpolation in one plane [...] with simultaneous linear interpolation along a third axis the CNC control model must be one that supports using the third axis) or a simulation of it using extremely small increments of 3-axes linear interpolation (which is not practical to program manually but can be programmed easily with CAD/CAM software). The cutter geometry reflects the thread pitch but not its lead; the lead (thread helix angle) {{is determined by the}} toolpath. Tapered threads can be cut either with a tapered multiple-form cutter that completes the thread in one revolution using helical interpolation, or with a straight or tapered cutter (of single- or multiple-form) whose toolpath is one or more revolutions but cannot use helical interpolation and must use CAD/CAM software to generate a contour-like simulation of helical interpolation.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — This work {{presents}} an experimental {{study on the}} mean Nusselt number, friction factor and thermal enhancement factor characteristics in a circular tube with different types of <b>internal</b> <b>threads</b> of 120 mm pitch under uniform wall heat flux boundary conditions. In the experiments, measured data are taken at Reynolds number in range of 7, 000 to 14, 000 with air as the test fluid. The experiments were conducted on circular tube with three different types of <b>internal</b> <b>threads</b> viz. acme, buttress and knuckle threads of constant pitch. The heat transfer and friction factor data obtained is compared with the data obtained from a plain circular tube under similar geometric and flow conditions. The variations of heat transfer and pressure loss {{in the form of}} Nusselt number (Nu) and friction factor (f) respectively is determined and depicted graphically. It is observed that at all Reynolds number, the Nusselt number and thermal performance increases for a circular tube with buttress threads as compared with a circular tube with acme and knuckle threads. These are because of increase in strength and intensity of vortices ejected from the buttress threads. Subsequently an empirical correlation is also formulated to match with experimental results with ± 8 % and ± 9 %, variation respectively for Nusselt number and friction factor.
