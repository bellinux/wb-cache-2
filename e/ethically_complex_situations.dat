40|$|Limited time {{dedicated}} to each training areas, irrelevant case-studies, and ethics “checklists” {{have resulted in}} bare-bones Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) training for present biomedical graduate student researchers. Here, we argue that science graduate students be taught classical ethical theory, such as virtue ethics, consequentialist theory, and deontological theory, to provide a basic framework to guide researchers through <b>ethically</b> <b>complex</b> <b>situations</b> and examine the applicability, implications, and societal ramifications of their research. Using a relevant biomedical research example to illustrate this point, we argue that proper ethics training for graduate student researchers not only will enhance current RCR training, but train more creative, responsible scientists.

40|$|International audienceRoutine 'provider-initiated {{testing and}} counselling' (PITC) for HIV has been {{implemented}} amidst concern over how consent, confidentiality and counselling (the 3 C's) {{can be maintained}} in under-resourced health care settings. In Kenya, PITC has been rolled out since 2005, HIV prevalence is 7. 1 % and over 86 % of adults have not been tested. Kenyan nurses are the main cadre implementing PITC but {{little is known about}} their experiences of incorporating HIV testing into everyday practice and the challenges faced in maintaining the 3 'Cs within their work environments. This study aimed to explore these issues and adopted a qualitative multi-method design using a convenience sampling approach. Two focus group discussions (total n= 12) and 13 in-depth individual interviews were undertaken with nurses from 11 different public health care facilities in Nairobi and its surrounding areas (including in- and out-patient settings). Data were analysed thematically. Nurses identified a range of personal, client and health system challenges in the everyday application of PITC. These included: (i) the contradictions of normalising a highly stigmatised disease and the difficulty of providing client centred care within a routinised and target oriented work culture; (ii) the challenge of dealing with <b>ethically</b> <b>complex</b> client <b>situations</b> in which the principles of the 3 C's could be difficult to uphold; and, (iii) lack of time, resources, space and recognition within workplace environments (especially in-patient settings) that, likewise, led to problems with maintaining the 3 C's. In-patient nurses in particular identified problems associated with testing in a multi-disciplinary context, suggesting that other health professionals appeared to routinely flout the PITC guidelines. In conclusion, this study shows that the process of translating policy into practice is invariably complex and that {{more research is needed to}} explore PITC practices, particularly in in-patient settings. Nurses require supervision and support to negotiate the challenges and to fulfil their roles effectively...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a course I developed on the Economics of Sin that integrates ethical and economic material. 1 My {{hope is that}} this paper will be useful to economists interested in exploring <b>ethically</b> <b>complex</b> economic phenomena and to philosophers {{who are interested in}} the eth-ical implications of economic markets and policies. In keeping with this agenda, I proceed by discussing a framework for relating economic out-comes to common ethical criteria. This is followed by two examples from the course, one involving policy in the market for heroin and the other addressing the economics and ethics of paired kidney exchange. These examples are intended to illustrate the potential for combining ethical and economic approaches to understanding <b>ethically</b> <b>complex</b> economic transactions. I conclude with a few practical remarks regarding the challenge of developing an interdisciplinary course.

40|$|With so many terms {{available}} {{to define the}} same thing, it would seem nearly irresponsible to introduce yet another term (<b>complex</b> <b>situation)</b> to describe a phenomenological state of such as a system. However, a <b>complex</b> <b>situation</b> infers both a broader meaning and imposes a different perspective.  Complex {{in this context is}} dependent on understanding and reality rather than observer and knowledge.   Situation imposes a gestalt that cannot be characterized within a singular perspective that relegates paradox to a superior/subordinate hierarchy. This also infers that <b>complex</b> <b>situation</b> has no monotonic definition or each definition is by default incomplete. Therefore the perennial derivations for systems such as complex systems, system of systems, federation of systems is no longer a sufficient descriptor for <b>complex</b> <b>situation.</b>  Ergo system and its genealogy lack the constitution to define <b>complex</b> <b>situations.</b> The books' intent is to explore this pathology through a series of papers written by authors that work in <b>complex</b> <b>situations</b> and have dealt with the limitations of the status quo: systems...|$|R

In some active database applications, those situations are {{not restricted to}} transaction units, but may span the whole lifetime of the database application. As a consequence, the amount of process information cumulates within the system and may reach problematic dimensions. This paper introduces a method to restrict the amount of events and potential <b>complex</b> <b>situations</b> by deriving more and more precise constraints from significant context information during the collection of indicators for a <b>complex</b> <b>situation.</b> This zoom effect is a natural way to model the continuous narrowing of relevance, as known in cognitive science. Our approach extends the parameterization of events in related research. A combination with established restriction techniques significantly restricts both relevant basic events and <b>complex</b> <b>situations.</b> This leads to an efficient situation detection even for long running activities...|$|R

Kuche {{depression}} of Tarim Basin went through tectogenesis many times, {{due to the}} southward thrust compressional stress from Tianshan fold uplift, the geology condition of this area is extraordinarily complex, there are problems such as depth difference in geological horizons, abnormal pressure formations and irregular distribution of special lithologies, etc. All of these problems have brought even more difficulties in engineering design and construction. Accidents such as well leakage, drilling sticking and <b>complex</b> <b>situations</b> happened frequently. All of those have influenced the engineering progress seriously and lowered the actual effect of drilling.

The version of record {{is available on}} line via [URL] ?? 2016 The Official Journal of Paramedics AustralasiaIntroduction Advance directives are known to present challenging ethical issues in health care practice, however there is a paucity of research into paramedic perspectives of advance directives. In situations where the patient has not considered end-of-life provisions, or is unable to communicate their wishes, this contributes to an <b>ethically</b> <b>complex</b> decision-making environment for practitioners. Ethical deliberation contributes to practitioners??? critical thinking skills and helps prepare them for decision-making under uncertainty. This research aims to highlight and explore underlying values within <b>ethically</b> <b>complex</b> practice-based decisions. Methods An exploratory, interpretive study using the ???Values Exchange???, a web-based ethical decision-making tool, explored 18 urbanbased New Zealand paramedics??? deliberative perspectives on a controversial end-of-life scenario. Results Thematic analysis of participants??? responses ascertained the breadth of views on advanced directives, {{with the emergence of}} three dominant themes; legal tensions, multiple constructs of dignity and seeking solutions that support clinical practice. Conclusion Findings revealed that when considering situations involving advance directives, participants regarded the duty to uphold patient dignity as paramount. There was a desire for greater legal guidance and a call for increased professional education in law and ethics. This study provides insight into New Zealand urban-based paramedics??? views and experiences of this ethically challenging aspect of patient care...|$|R
