5|$|The mutual {{attraction}} {{between individual}} insects continues into adulthood, {{and they continue}} to act as a cohesive group. Individuals that get detached from a swarm fly back into the mass. Others that get left behind after feeding, take off to rejoin the swarm when it passes overhead. When individuals {{at the front of the}} swarm settle to feed, others fly past overhead and settle in their turn, the whole swarm acting like a rolling unit with an ever-changing leading edge. The locusts spend much time on the ground feeding and resting, moving on when the vegetation is exhausted. They may then fly a considerable distance before settling in a location where transitory rainfall has caused a green <b>flush</b> <b>of</b> new growth.|$|E

For the Genoese aristocracy, then in a final <b>flush</b> <b>of</b> prosperity, he developed a full-length portrait style, drawing on Veronese and Titian as well as Rubens' style from his own period in Genoa, where extremely tall but graceful figures {{look down on the}} viewer with great hauteur. In 1627, he went back to Antwerp where he remained for five years, painting more affable portraits which still made his Flemish patrons look as stylish as possible. A life-size group portrait of twenty-four City Councillors of Brussels he painted for the council-chamber was destroyed in 1695. He was evidently very charming to his patrons, and, like Rubens, well able to mix in aristocratic and court circles, which added to his ability to obtain commissions. By 1630 he was described as the court painter of the Habsburg Governor of Flanders, the Archduchess Isabella. In this period he also produced many religious works, including large altarpieces, and began his printmaking (see below).|$|E

25|$|In 1924, as a {{postgraduate}} student with more time, Frazer finally played first-class cricket for Oxford University. He played {{in most of}} the team matches in the 1924 season, batting mainly in the middle order, but his best score and his only total ever of more than 50 was made as an opening batsman, with 81 in the match against H. D. G. Leveson-Gower's XI at Eastbourne, a rather weak team composed entirely of amateurs, many of them not in the first <b>flush</b> <b>of</b> youth (Ernest Smith, the captain, was 54 and had played for Oxford University 36 years earlier in 1888). Frazer's timing for a big innings was immaculate: the next Oxford game was the University Match and he duly won a cricket blue to go with his two soccer blues, scoring 5 and 20 in his two innings in a nine-wicket defeat by Cambridge. Frazer played seven further matches for Sussex when the university term was over, without success, and appeared for two amateur teams in first-class matches against Oxford University in 1925, but {{that was the end of}} his first-class cricket career.|$|E

[...] Writing for the Chicago Tribune in 2007, Michael Wilmington described Labyrinth as [...] "dazzling", writing that it is [...] "a real masterpiece of puppetry and special effects, an absolutely gorgeous children's fantasy movie". In 2010 Total Film ran a feature called 'Why We Love Labyrinth' which described Labyrinth as a [...] "hyper-real, vibrant daydream, Labyrinth's main strength lies in its fairytale roots, which give the fantastical story a platform from which to launch into some deliriously outlandish scenarios".
