50|$|Contemporary art {{galleries}} are usually {{open to the}} general public without charge; however, some are semi-private. They usually profit by taking a portion of art sales; from 25% to 50% is typical. There are also many non-profit or collective galleries. Some galleries in cities like Tokyo charge the artists a <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> <b>per</b> <b>day,</b> though this is considered distasteful in some international art markets. Galleries often hang solo shows. Curators often create group shows that say something about a certain theme, trend in art, or group of associated artists. Galleries sometimes choose to represent artists exclusively, giving them the opportunity to show regularly.|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} {{operational}} models that galleries follow. The most common business model {{is that of}} the for-profit, privately owned gallery. This is an extremely competitive market but one that may yield great profits. As a general rule, commercial galleries do not charge admission to the public, perhaps in a nod to the egalitarian philosophies of many artists and critics and to encourage attendance, or perhaps in the interests of just good business. Instead, they profit by taking a cut of the art's sales; the exact percentage varies. Some galleries in cities like Tokyo and in New York charge the artists a <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> <b>per</b> <b>day</b> or per week, though this is considered distasteful in some international art markets. Inevitably the business of contemporary art has in recent decades become increasingly internationalized and commercialized.|$|E
40|$|Concentrates {{are a major}} {{cost element}} in feeding beef cattle in winter. Because {{of the need to}} retain {{finishing}} cattle until after specific dates to comply with retention periods for the draw-down of premia, feeding strategies must be flexible. The objectives of this study were to examine concentrate feeding strategies which would minimise concentrate feeding to weanlings and exploit compensatory growth, simplify feeding routines and improve the efficiency of concentrate utilisation in finishing cattle. Four experiments were carried out, two with weanlings and two with finishing cattle. • Weanlings fed outdoors (in sacrifice paddocks) in winter gained 13 kg more than those similarly fed indoors {{but by the end of}} the following grazing season the weight difference had decreased to 4 kg as a result of compensatory growth. • There was no response to an increase in protein level in the concentrate. • Feeding 2 kg/day of supplementary concentrates with silage in winter reduced silage intake by 0. 4 kg dry matter (DM) and increased total DM intake by 1. 27 kg/day. • The liveweight gain response in winter to 2 kg/day supplementary concentrates was 344 g/day or a total of 44 kg. By the end of the following grazing season this had declined to 14 kg (68 % compensation) • The conversion ratio of concentrate DM to liveweight was about 5 : 1 at the end of winter but by the end of the following grazing season it was over 15 : 1. • Feeding a fixed total concentrate allowance to weanlings gave a better response when it was offered at a flat rate daily over the whole winter, or at a high rate over the first half of the winter, rather than when offered at a high rate over the second half of the winter. • Feeding a fixed total concentrate allowance ad libitum over the final part of the finishing period was superior to feeding it at a <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> <b>per</b> <b>day</b> over the total period in terms of feed energy utilization. • There was no impairment in the efficiency of total feed energy utilization by delaying the feeding of a fixed concentrate allowance for up to 70 days after housing compared to feeding it immediately after housing. • Where animals are being finished over a 5 - 6 months period, rather than feeding concentrates at a flat rate throughout the whole period, it is better to delay introduction for 2 - 3 months and then offer concentrates ad libitum thereafter. • As the interval from housing to concentrate introduction increases, the response to concentrates fed ad libitum subsequently increases. • Although not reflected in carcass fat score, objective indicators of fatness were lower for animals fed concentrates ad libitum than for animals fed concentrates at a flat rate with silage.

5|$|Records {{from the}} Pool Adit copper mine at Trevenson (the most {{successful}} {{of the early}} copper mines) show in 1729, 25 bal maidens and three males worked as 'pickers' sorting high quality from poor quality ore, earning a <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> of 4d <b>per</b> <b>day</b> and typically working 20 <b>days</b> <b>per</b> month. (Records do not show {{the ages of the}} pickers at Pool Adit, but the male pickers are likely to have been boys too young for heavy labour.) In 1730 Pool Adit employed 30 female and four male pickers, and by 1731 the figures had risen to 55 female and five male, typically working 22 to 26 <b>days</b> <b>per</b> month. The number of bal maidens employed in the industry rose dramatically, and by the early 1770s Dolcoath, by then the most significant of the Cornish copper mines, employed around 220 bal maidens on the copper dressing floors alone.|$|R

40|$|Following the 9 / 11 {{terrorist}} incidence, {{most countries}} introduced security charges on air travel, {{mostly in the}} form of <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> <b>per</b> passenger. However, it is clear that such <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> <b>per</b> passenger may not be socially optimal as implied by previous studies on airport pricing including those utilizing Ramsey pricing. Thus, an alternative pricing scheme may enhance social welfare. In this paper, recognizing the competitive reality of today's airline markets we formulate and solve numerically a differentiated duopoly model in order to compare welfare implications of adopting the two most convenient forms of aviation security pricing: (1) charging a <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> <b>per</b> passenger; and (2) charging Ad Valorem user fees. Since obtaining meaningful analytical results requires unrealistically restrictive assumptions, we designed a numerical experiment and conducted over 5000 simulations using a wide range of possible values of firms' conduct parameters, extent of product differentiation, and market share split between full service airline (FSA) and low cost carrier (LCC). Our results show that Ad Valorem user fee is superior to the current policy of charging <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> security fee in all cases except for very few unrealistic cases. The same conclusion can be directly applied to all other per-passenger fees or taxes being collected by governments and/or airports. This is an important finding given that taxes and user charges now account for up to 30 % of the total ticket prices of short distance domestic travel in US. ...|$|R

The Code provides both minimum and maximum rate limits (1:5 ratio), thus prohibits establishment of tax-free gambling. For example, one slot machine is taxed at 1,500-7,500 roubles a year, and one table at 25,000-125,000 roubles a year.
