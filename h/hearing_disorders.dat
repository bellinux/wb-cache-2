5|$|Cavaliers can notably {{suffer from}} mitral valve disease, {{which leads to}} heart failure. This appears in many Cavaliers {{at some point in}} their lives and is the most common cause of death. Some serious genetic health problems, {{including}} early-onset mitral valve disease (MVD), the potentially severely painful syringomyelia (SM), hip dysplasia, luxating patellas, and certain vision and <b>hearing</b> <b>disorders</b> are health problems for this breed. As today's Cavaliers all descend from only six dogs, any inheritable disease present in at least one of the original founding dogs can be passed on to a significant proportion of future generations. This is known as the founder effect and is the likely cause of the prevalence of MVD in the breed. The health problems shared with this breed include mitral valve disease, luxating patella, and hereditary eye issues such as cataracts and retinal dysplasia.|$|E

25|$|VKH {{syndrome}} {{is named for}} ophthalmologists Alfred Vogt from Switzerland and Yoshizo Koyanagi and Einosuke Harada from Japan. Several authors, including the Arabic doctor Mohammad-al-Ghâfiqî in the 12th century as well as Jacobi, Nettelship and Tay in the 19th century, had described poliosis, neuralgias and <b>hearing</b> <b>disorders.</b> This constellation was probably often due to sympathetic ophthalmia but likely included examples of VKH. Koyanagi's first description of the disease was in 1914, but was preceded by Jujiro Komoto, Professor of Ophthalmology at the University of Tokyo, in 1911. It was the much later article, published in 1929, that definitively associated Koyanagi with the disease. Harada's 1926 paper is recognized for its comprehensive description {{of what is now}} known as Vogt–Koyanagi–Harada disease.|$|E
40|$|People {{communicate}} to understand {{one another and}} share information. Speaking is crucial {{in the course of}} everyone's entire life. In this thesis, we have focused on the issues related to communication with seniors with a <b>hearing</b> <b>disorder.</b> It is necessary to properly diagnose the <b>hearing</b> <b>disorder</b> using suitable methods of examination, and subsequently propose possible means of therapy and train the patient on use of the hearing aid if necessary. Two objectives were set out, both of which were achieved. Objective 1 : Map the effective skills used by nurses when communicating with seniors with a <b>hearing</b> <b>disorder.</b> Objective 2 : Determine how unsuitable communication by nurses affects seniors with a <b>hearing</b> <b>disorder.</b> A quantitative and qualitative examination was performed. Within the quantitative examination, 200 questionnaires were handed out, of which 178 properly completed were returned for processing. The qualitative examination consisted of a semi-structured interview of ten seniors with a <b>hearing</b> <b>disorder</b> with the help of technology. We defined three hypotheses. Hypothesis 1 : The type of education affects nurses' communication skills with seniors with a <b>hearing</b> <b>disorder.</b> Hypothesis 2 : Nurses adhere to the principles of communication with seniors with a <b>hearing</b> <b>disorder.</b> Both hypotheses were confirmed. Hypothesis 3 : Nurses consider care for seniors with a <b>hearing</b> <b>disorder</b> to be a burden. The last hypothesis was not confirmed. Three research questions were also defined. Research question 1 : How does the current manner of communication by nurses affect seniors with a <b>hearing</b> <b>disorder?</b> Answer 1 : The current manner of communication of nurses with seniors with a <b>hearing</b> <b>disorder</b> has a positive effect. Research question 2 : How do seniors with a <b>hearing</b> <b>disorder</b> perceive non-verbal communication by nurses? Answer 2 : Seniors with a <b>hearing</b> <b>disorder</b> consider the non-verbal communication of nurses to be adequate. Research question 3 : What problems do seniors with a <b>hearing</b> <b>disorder</b> encounter when communicating with nurses? Answer 3 : The most common problem mentioned by seniors with a <b>hearing</b> <b>disorder</b> was lack of eye contact...|$|R

2500|$|Another {{long-term}} {{risk factor}} from firefighting is exposure {{to high levels}} of sound, which can cause noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) and tinnitus. [...] NIHL is caused by exposure to sound levels at or above 85dBA according to NIOSH and at or above 90dBA according to OSHA. dBA represents A-weighted decibels. dBA is used for measuring sound levels relating to occupational sound exposure since it attempts to mimic the sensitivity of the human ear to different frequencies of sound. OSHA uses a 5-dBA exchange rate, which means that for every 5dBA increase in sound from 90dBA, the acceptable exposure time before a risk of permanent hearing loss occurs decreases by half (starting with 8 hours acceptable exposure time at 90dBA). NIOSH uses a 3-dBA exchange rate starting at 8 hours acceptable exposure time at 85dBA. [...] The time of exposure required to potentially cause damage depends on the level of sound exposed to..The most common causes of excessive sound exposure are sirens, transportation to and from fires, fire alarms, and work tools. Traveling in an emergency vehicle has shown to expose a person to between 103 and 114dBA of sound. According to OSHA, exposure at this level is acceptable for between 17 and 78 minutes and according to NIOSH is acceptable for between 35 seconds and 7.5 minutes [...] over a 24-hour day before permanent hearing loss can occur. This time period considers that no other high level sound exposure occurs in that 24-hour time frame. Sirens often output about 120dBA, which according to OSHA, 7.5 minutes of exposure is needed and according to NIOSH, 9 seconds of exposure is neededin a 24-hour time period before permanent hearing loss can occur. In addition to high sound levels, another risk factor for <b>hearing</b> <b>disorders</b> is the co-exposure to chemicals that are ototoxic. [...] The average day of work for a firefighter can often be under the sound exposure limit for both OSHA and NIOSH. The average day of sound exposure as a firefighter is often under the limit, but firefighters can be exposed to impulse noise, which has a very low acceptable time exposure before permanent hearing damage can occur due to the high intensity and short duration.|$|E

5000|$|Selective {{hearing is}} not {{known to be a}} {{disorder}} of the physiological or psychological aspect. Under the World Health Organization (WHO), a <b>hearing</b> <b>disorder</b> happens when there is a complete loss of hearing in the ears. It means the loss of the ability to hear. Technically speaking, selective hearing is not [...] "deafness" [...] to a certain sound message. Rather, it is the selectivity of an individual to attend audibly to a sound message. The whole sound message is physically heard by the ear but the idea is the capacity of the mind to systematically filter out unwanted information.

Although {{a link between}} stress and tinnitus has been widely recognized, the empirical evidence is scant. Our aims were to test for dysregulation of the stress-related hypothalamus-pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis in tinnitus and to examine ear sensitivity variations with cortisol manipulation. Methods Twenty-one tinnitus participants and 21 controls comparable in age, education, and overall health status but without tinnitus underwent basal cortisol assessments on three non-consecutive days and took 0. 5 mg of dexamethasone (DEX) at 23 : 00 on the first day. Cortisol levels were measured hourly the next morning. Detection and discomfort hearing thresholds were measured before and after dexamethasone suppression test. Results Both groups displayed similar basal cortisol levels, but tinnitus participants showed stronger and longer-lasting cortisol suppression after DEX administration. Suppression was unrelated to hearing loss. Discomfort threshold was lower after cortisol suppression in tinnitus ears.
