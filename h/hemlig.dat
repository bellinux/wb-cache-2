All classified defence documents will now have both a Swedish classification (Kvalificerat <b>hemlig</b> or <b>Hemlig),</b> and an English classification (Top Secret, Secret, Confidential, or Restricted). The term skyddad identitet, [...] "protected identity", {{is used in the}} case of protection of a threatened person, basically implying [...] "secret identity", accessible only to certain members of the police force and explicitly authorised officials.|$|E
40|$|The main {{question}} {{in this thesis}} {{is what kind of}} considerations political parties in the Swedish parliament have made between individual freedoms and state power in matters concerning information technology. Hence, it relates to a central and never ending debate about the proper relationship between the individual rights of citizens and protection of their personal integrity vis-à-vis state power and the interest of society in general, and in particular how this is affected by the rapid development of information technology. Four cases of legislative processes about information technology are analyzed. These cases concern parliamentary debates regarding the secrecy act (sekretesslagen) in 1980 (first debate), three debates concerning the personal data act (personuppgiftslagen) in 1998 - 99, three debates concerning the surveillance and crime prevention act (lag om <b>hemlig</b> rumsavlyssning & åtgärder för att förhindra vissa särskilt allvarliga brott med mera) in 2006 - 07 and three debates concerning the national defence radio establishment act (FRA & lag om signalspaning) in 2007 - 09. An analytical model is developed that includes two ideal types, individual freedom and state power, for the study and categorization of the parties and their positions in each debate. Thus, parties are categorized according to their proximity to the ideal types. The study illustrates that the majority of parties have a tendency to compromise between values constituting the two ideal types; they choose a so called hybrid position in between individual freedom and state power. The exception to this pattern is the Green Party and the Left Party that tend to choose a position close to individual freedom. Three hypotheses are tested. The first implies that parties tend to position themselves in-between the ideal type positions of individual freedom and state power (hybrid positions). This hypothesis gets strong support as hybrid positions are the most common outcome. The second hypothesis infers that a party has a tendency to support state power when in government, but individual freedom when in opposition. This hypothesis also gets empirical support, as parties, when in government, tend increasingly to support values related to state power, but support is somewhat weaker than for the first hypothesis. Finally, the third hypothesis implies that September 11 2001 was a critical moment in relation to how parties deal with values related to individual freedom and state power, i. e. parties were expected generally to be more disposed to support state power after than before September 11. This gets some support as most parties show this tendency. In parliamentary debates after September 11 the Social Democrats, the Moderate Party and the Liberal Party have been more disposed to position themselves close to the value of state power. On the other hand, the Green Party and the Left Party have not changed their positons. One reason could be that neither of these two parties were in government during the studied year...|$|E
40|$|A digital {{signature}} is the electronic counterpart to the hand written signature. It can prove {{the source and}} integrity of any digital data, and is a tool that is becoming increasingly important {{as more and more}} information is handled electronically. Digital signature schemes use a pair of keys. One key is secret and allows the owner to sign some data, and the other is public and allows anyone to verify the signature. Assuming that the keys are large enough, and that a secure scheme is used, it is impossible to find the private key given only the public key. Since a signature is valid for the signed message only, this also means {{that it is impossible to}} forge a {{digital signature}}. The most well-used scheme for constructing digital signatures today is RSA, which is based on the hard mathematical problem of integer factorization. There are, however, other mathematical problems that are considered even harder, which in practice means that the keys can be made shorter, resulting in a smaller memory footprint and faster computations. One such alternative approach is using elliptic curves. The underlying mathematical problem of elliptic curve cryptography is different to that of RSA, however some structure is shared. The purpose of this thesis was to evaluate the performance of elliptic curves compared to RSA, on a system designed to efficiently perform the operations associated with RSA. The discovered results are that the elliptic curve approach offers some great advantages, even when using RSA hardware, and that these advantages increase significantly if special hardware is used. Some usage cases of digital signatures may, for a few more years, still be in favor of the RSA approach when it comes to speed. For most cases, however, an elliptic curve system is the clear winner, and will likely be dominant within a near future. En digital signatur är den elektroniska motsvarigheten till en handskriven signatur. Den kan bevisa källa och integritet för valfri data, och är ett verktyg som blir allt viktigare i takt med att mer och mer information hanteras digitalt. Digitala signaturer använder sig av två nycklar. Den ena nyckeln är <b>hemlig</b> och tillåter ägaren att signera data, och den andra är offentlig och tillåter vem som helst att verifiera signaturen. Det är, under förutsättning att nycklarna är tillräck- ligt stora och att det valda systemet är säkert, omöjligt att hitta den hemliga nyckeln utifrån den offentliga. Eftersom en signatur endast är giltig för datan som signerades innebär detta också att det är omöjligt att förfalska en digital signatur. Den mest välanvända konstruktionen för att skapa digitala signaturer idag är RSA, som baseras på det svåra matematiska problemet att faktorisera heltal. Det finns dock andra matematiska problem som anses vara ännu svårare, vilket i praktiken innebär att nycklarna kan göras kortare, vilket i sin tur leder till att mindre minne behövs och att beräkningarna går snabbare. Ett sådant alternativ är att använda elliptiska kurvor. Det underliggande matematiska problemet för kryptering baserad på elliptiska kurvor skiljer sig från det som RSA bygger på, men de har en viss struktur gemensam. Syftet med detta examensarbete var att utvärdera hur elliptiska kurvor presterar jämfört med RSA, på ett system som är designat för att effektivt utföra RSA. De funna resultaten är att metoden med elliptiska kurvor ger stora fördelar, även om man nyttjar hårdvara avsedd för RSA, och att dessa fördelar ökar mångfaldigt om speciell hårdvara används. För några användarfall av digitala signaturer kan, under några år framöver, RSA fortfarande vara fördelaktigt om man bara tittar på hastigheten. För de flesta fall vinner dock elliptiska kurvor, och kommer troligen vara dominant inom kort. ...|$|E
