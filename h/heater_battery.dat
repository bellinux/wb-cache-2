2500|$|Chrysler Canada marketed the Valiant at Dodge and Plymouth dealers under a {{standalone}} [...] "Valiant" [...] marque. The Canadian 1960–62 Valiant was visually {{similar to}} its American counterpart except the badge {{on the trunk}} lid read [...] "by Chrysler" [...] instead of [...] "Plymouth". Besides minor differences in interior and exterior trim, the alternator was an extra-cost option in Canada through 1962 while it was standard equipment in America. An anti-ice system for the carburetor's throttle body, engine block <b>heater,</b> <b>battery</b> warmer, electric car interior heater and other cold-climate items were available as factory and/or dealer-installed options. Air conditioning, which was first offered in the US 1961 models, was not made available North of the border until 1966. Some Canadian-made Auto-Lite (now Prestolite) electrical components were used {{in lieu of the}} American-production Chrysler-built components. The Windsor, Ontario, plant was a source for left- and right-hand-drive export Valiants as knock down kits.|$|E
5000|$|A series charge {{controller}} or series regulator disables further current flow into batteries {{when they are}} full. A shunt {{charge controller}} or shunt regulator diverts excess electricity to an auxiliary or [...] "shunt" [...] load, such as an electric water <b>heater,</b> when <b>batteries</b> are full.|$|R
5|$|Some {{non-standard}} USB devices use the 5V {{power supply}} without {{participating in a}} proper USB network, which negotiates power draw with the host interface. These are usually called USB decorations. Examples include USB-powered keyboard lights, fans, mug coolers and <b>heaters,</b> <b>battery</b> chargers, miniature vacuum cleaners, and even miniature lava lamps. In most cases, these items contain no digital circuitry, and thus are not standard-compliant USB devices. This may cause problems with some computers, such as drawing too much current and damaging circuitry. Prior to the USB Battery Charging Specification, the USB specification required that devices connect in a low-power mode (100mA maximum) and communicate their current requirements to the host, which then permits the device to switch into high-power mode.|$|R
5000|$|International Charitable Foundation [...] "Resistance Movement" [...] was {{established}} on April 24, 2014 to help defenders of Ukraine who {{fight for the}} territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine. The Foundation {{was established}} by Yulia Tymoshenko, the head of political party [...] "Batkivshchyna" [...] (Motherland). Since {{the beginning of the}} military conflict until today 35 mln. UAH have been transferred for the different needs of Ukrainian defenders.

50|$|The 2011 Leaf {{price was}} set at , and the initial {{roll-out}} was limited to selected markets and in limited quantities. The 2011 Canadian Leaf came with additional equipment useful for colder weather, such as heated front and rear seats, steering wheel, and outside mirrors. Other modifications included a <b>battery</b> <b>heater</b> system and an HVAC duct to the rear seating area.|$|R
5000|$|The {{lead-acid}} {{batteries are}} sensitive to temperature, losing {{a substantial portion of}} capacity in winter conditions. When plugged in for charge the battery temperature is sensed and <b>battery</b> <b>heaters</b> used to maintain temperature sufficient to retain specified range - a necessity for colder climate fleet use, where vehicles are usually parked outdoors. This would suggest that to enhance the economy of use in such climates that the vehicle should be sheltered. NiMH batteries do not have this temperature sensitivity; however, models with NiMH batteries do have a loss in range in cold temperatures, perhaps because of greater rolling resistance in the drive train and tires.|$|R
2500|$|Normally {{the solar}} arrays on the rovers {{are able to}} {{generate}} up to [...] of energy per Martian day. After the storms, {{the amount of energy}} generated was greatly reduced to [...] If the rovers generate less than [...] per day they must start draining their batteries to run survival <b>heaters.</b> If the <b>batteries</b> run dry, key electrical elements are likely to fail due to the intense cold. Both rovers were put into the lowest-power setting in order to wait out the storms. In early August the storms began to clear slightly, allowing the rovers to successfully charge their batteries. They were kept in hibernation in order to wait out the remainder of the storm.|$|R
40|$|Currently, the Normative base of Ukraine {{has moved}} to European standards. The process of {{harmonization}} with the Eurocodes was completed, new national normative documents of DBN and DSTU were developed and put into effect. At {{the same time it}} was turned out that the big section “Concrete and reinforced concrete structures intended for work in conditions of increased and high temperatures” is absent in the Eurocodes. By order of the Ministry of Regional Development, Construction and Housing and Communal Services of Ukraine, the development of a normative act is provided for the replacement of SNiP 2. 03. 04 - 84 with DBN with a change in status. Heat-resistant concretes in the elements of thermal aggregates are used in the iron and steel industry (blast furnaces, air <b>heaters,</b> coke <b>batteries,</b> etc.), non-ferrous metallurgy (graphite furnaces, fluidized bed furnaces, etc.), oil refining and petrochemical industry (tubular furnaces, vertical sectional furnaces, etc.), in the industry of building materials, and in various sectors of industry. These norms and rules apply to the design of concrete and reinforced concrete structures designed to operate under conditions of systematic exposure to increased (50 to 200 °C inclusive) and high (above 200 °C) process temperatures...|$|R
50|$|Components used {{to ensure}} the {{temperature}} requirements are met in CubeSats include multi-layer insulation and <b>heaters</b> for the <b>battery.</b> Other spacecraft thermal control techniques in small satellites include specific component placement based on expected thermal output of those components and, rarely, deployed thermal devices such as louvers. Analysis and simulation of the spacecraft's thermal model is an important determining factor in applying thermal management components and techniques. CubeSats with special thermal concerns, often associated with certain deployment mechanisms and payloads, may be tested in a thermal vacuum chamber before launch. Such testing provides a larger degree of assurance than full-sized satellites can receive, since CubeSats are {{small enough to fit}} inside of a thermal vacuum chamber in their entirety. Temperature sensors are typically placed on different CubeSat components so that action may be taken to avoid dangerous temperature ranges, such as reorienting the craft in order to avoid or introduce direct thermal radiation to a specific part, thereby allowing it to cool or heat.|$|R
5000|$|The 955 is one {{of about}} a dozen types of [...] "acorn valve", so called because their size and shape is similar to the acorn (nut of the oak tree), {{designed}} to work in the VHF range. The 954 and 956 types are sharp and remote cut-off pentodes, respectively, all with indirect 6.3 V, 150 mA heaters. Types 957, 958 and 959 are for portable equipment and have 1.25 V NiCd <b>battery</b> <b>heaters.</b> The 957 is a medium-μ signal triode, the 958 is a transmitting triode with dual, paralleled filaments for increased emission, and the 959 is a sharp cut-off pentode like the 954. The 957 and 959 draw 50 mA heater current, the 958 twice as much. In 1942, the 958A with tightened emission specs was introduced after it turned out that 958s with excessively high emission kept working after the filament power was turned off, the filament still sufficiently heating on the anode current alone.|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} on generation of biogas {{was carried out}} as one of subjects in a project which has been promoted to make pig feeds using food recyclable resources. The {{aim of the research}} was to recycle all of leftover foods collected except those used as the pig feeds. A 1 m^ 3 digestion tank and some small 18 ℓ tanks were provided. The former was placed in a vinyl house to examine the effect of heating by the sun, and the latter ones were kept at a temperature of about 38 ℃ so as to be appropriate for methane fermentation to find the biogas generation rate. It was found that the biogas generation rate for the leftover foods of 1 kg was 70 ℓ/kg a day and a proper amount of leftover foods for the tank volume of 1 m^ 3 was appropriately 11 kg/m^ 3 a day. This means that, for instance, a digestion tank with the volume of 20 m^ 3 and leftover foods of 220 kg per day were needed if you require biogas of 16 m^ 3 per day which is equivalent to kerosene of 10 ℓ as the calorific value. It is effective in heating the digestion tank to place it in a vinyl house. Although the heating is necessary in wintertime or nighttime, the subtropical climate at Okinawa is advantageous to methane fermentation. Therefore it is considered that the electricity consumption for the heating could be saved much more by use of renewable energies such as solar water <b>heaters,</b> solar <b>batteries</b> or small-sized wind power generators...|$|R
5000|$|The safety {{mechanism}} worked until Opportunity approached the first winter on Mars. As the Sun began to retreat {{lower in the}} sky and solar power levels dropped, it became clear that Opportunity {{would not be able to}} keep the batteries charged with a heater draining power all night long. On Sol [...] (May 28, 2004), rover operators began using a procedure known as [...] "deep sleep," [...] during which Opportunity disconnected the batteries at night. Deep sleep prevented the stuck heater (and everything else on the rover except the clock and the <b>battery</b> <b>heaters)</b> from drawing power. When the Sun came up the next morning and sunlight began hitting the solar arrays, the batteries automatically reconnected, the robotic arm became operational, the shoulder joint warmed up, and the thermostatic switch opened, disabling the heater. As a result, the shoulder joint was extremely hot during the day and extremely cold at night. Such huge temperature swings, which tend to make electric motors wear out faster, were taking place every sol.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} range included {{about half}} a dozen tubes, designed {{to work in the}} VHF range. The 955 is a triode. The 954 and 956 types are sharp and remote cut-off pentodes, respectively, all with indirect 6.3 V, 150 mA heaters.

50|$|The Vixen was {{designed}} as {{an answer to the}} GMC motorhome. The Vixen {{was designed}} to be stored in a typical garage as it was only 6 feet high and 21 feet long. Despite its small size by motorhome standards, the Vixen was marketed as having all of the features of larger competitors. Such features included a generator and water <b>heater.</b> Two house <b>batteries</b> {{and one of the first}} electric inverters in an RV allowed the owner to run the microwave, air-conditioning, and anything else which could be plugged into 110-volt outlets, off the batteries that were charged by the 120-amp alternator. The Vixen could also be plugged-in at a typical campsite outlet. Water came from the fresh water tank or services at a campsite and was heated by a heat exchanger. The same engine heat was used to warm the passenger compartment. Since diesels do not develop waste heat quickly, there was also an auxiliary diesel heater that could raise the temperature of the engine coolant. This helped with winter starting, keeping the RV warm, and the water hot. The heater was fuel efficient, and didn't need to stop for propane to fuel it. Unfortunately, it was notorious for needing service.|$|R
40|$|A recent {{trend of}} the power system is the ever {{increasing}} number of distributed generators (DGs) utilizing renewable energy sources, which have output powers that fluctuate due to unpredictable weather and ambient conditions. This causes fluctuations in system frequency and bus voltages, resulting in poor quality power, higher prices for electricity, and increased chances of reverse power flow and voltage collapse. In order to allow higher levels of DG penetration, methods of reducing the effects of fluctuations must be implemented. This paper proposes a method to mitigate these fluctuations using controllable loads such as heat pump water <b>heaters</b> (HPs) and <b>battery</b> storage systems. The HPs are controlled using a decentralized bang-bang (on/off) control based on the cumulative distribution of water temperature of HPs in the local area and the local frequency. Battery systems are controlled using a smart frequency and voltage droop characteristics based control. The decentralized bang-bang control mitigates local frequency fluctuations by increasing active power consumption to lower frequency as well as decreasing active power consumption to increase the frequency. The smart droop characteristics based control applies a commonly used droop characteristics control to voltage and frequency; however, the control system monitors the state of charge (SOC) of the battery system and takes appropriate actions to prevent the SOC from reaching a critical level. The results of simulations show that fluctuations in frequency and bus voltage are mitigated by {{the application of the}} proposed control methodologies without adversely affecting the comfort level of consumers...|$|R
40|$|The TERRA {{spacecraft}} {{was launched}} in December 1999 from Vandenberg Air Force Base, becoming the flagship of NASA's Earth Observing System program to gather data on how the planet's processes create climate. Originally planned as a 5 year mission, it still provides valuable science data after nearly 10 years on orbit. On October 13 th, 2009 at 16 : 23 z following a routine inclination maneuver, TERRA experienced a battery cell failure and a simultaneous failure of several <b>battery</b> <b>heater</b> control circuits used to maintain cell temperatures and gradients within the battery. With several cells nearing the minimum survival temperature, preventing the electrolyte from freezing was the first priority. After several reset attempts and power cycling of the control electronics failed to reestablish control authority on the primary side of the controller, it was switched to the redundant side, but anomalous performance again prevented full heater control of the battery cells. As {{the investigation into the}} cause of the anomaly and corrective action continued, a battery thermal model was developed to be used in determining the control ability remaining and to simulate and assess corrective actions. Although no thermal model or detailed reference data of the battery was available, sufficient information was found to allow a simplified model to be constructed, correlated against pre-anomaly telemetry, and used to simulate the thermal behavior at several points after the anomaly. It was then used to simulate subsequent corrective actions to assess their impact on cell temperatures. This paper describes the rapid development of this thermal model, including correlation to flight data before and after the anomaly., along with a comparative assessment of the analysis results used to interpret the telemetry {{to determine the extent of}} damage to the thermal control hardware, with near-term corrective actions and long-term operations plan to overcome the anomaly...|$|R
40|$|The rapid {{detection}} and identification of infectious disease pathogens {{is a critical}} need for healthcare in both developed and developing countries. As we gain more insight into the genomic basis of pathogen infectivity and drug resistance, point-of-care nucleic acid testing will likely become an important tool for global health. In this paper, we present an inexpensive, handheld, battery-powered instrument designed to enable pathogen genotyping in the developing world. Our Microfluidic Biomolecular Amplification Reader (µBAR) represents the convergence of molecular biology, microfluidics, optics, and electronics technology. The µBAR is capable of carrying out isothermal nucleic acid amplification assays with real-time fluorescence readout {{at a fraction of}} the cost of conventional benchtop thermocyclers. Additionally, the µBAR features cell phone data connectivity and GPS sample geotagging which can enable epidemiological surveying and remote healthcare delivery. The µBAR controls assay temperature through an integrated resistive heater and monitors real-time fluorescence signals from 60 individual reaction chambers using LEDs and phototransistors. Assays are carried out on PDMS disposable microfluidic cartridges which require no external power for sample loading. We characterize the fluorescence detection limits, <b>heater</b> uniformity, and <b>battery</b> life of the instrument. As a proof-of-principle, we demonstrate the detection of the HIV- 1 integrase gene with the µBAR using the Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP) assay. Although we focus on the detection of purified DNA here, LAMP has previously been demonstrated with a range of clinical samples, and our eventual goal is to develop a microfluidic device which includes on-chip sample preparation from raw samples. The µBAR is based entirely around open source hardware and software, and in the accompanying online supplement we present a full set of schematics, bill of materials, PCB layouts, CAD drawings, and source code for the µBAR instrument with the goal of spurring further innovation toward low-cost genetic diagnostics...|$|R
40|$|For demand {{response}} in smart grid, a utility {{company wants to}} minimize total electricity cost and end users want to maximize their own utility. The latter is considered to consist of two parts in this research: electricity cost and convenience/comfort. We first develop a system optimal (SO) model and a user equilibrium (UE) model for the utility company and end users, respectively and compare the difference of the two. We consider users 2 ̆ 7 possible preference on convenience over cost-saving under the real-time pricing in smart grid, and each user is assumed to have a preferred time window for using a particular appliance. As a result, each user in the proposed energy consumption game wishes to maximize a payoff or utility consisting of two parts: the negative of electricity cost and the convenience of using appliances during their preferred time windows. Numerical results show that users with less flexibility on their preferred usage times have larger impact on the system performance at equilibrium. Second, we found that instead of minimizing total cost, if utility company is regulated to maximize the social welfare, the user equilibrium model can achieve identical optimal solution as the system optimal model. We then design a {{demand response}} pricing frame work to accomplish this goal under alternative secondary objectives. We also investigate the non-uniqueness of the user equilibrium solution and prove that there exist alternative user equilibrium solutions. In this case, robust pricing is considered using multi-level optimization for the user equilibrium. Third, we study empirical data from a demand response pilot program in Kentucky {{in an attempt to}} understand consumer behavior under demand response and to characterize the thermo dynamics when set point for heat, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) is adjusted for demand response. Although sample size is limited, it helps to reveal the great variability in consumers 2 ̆ 7 response to demand response event. Using the real data collected, we consider to minimize the peak demand for a system consisting of smart thermostats, advanced hot water <b>heaters</b> and <b>battery</b> systems for storage. We propose a mixed integer program model as well as a heuristic algorithm for an optimal consumption schedule so that the system peak during a designated period is minimized. Therefore, we propose a consumption scheduling model to optimally control these loads and storage in maximizing efficiency without impacting thermal comfort. The model allows pre-cooling and pre-heating of homes to be performed for variable loads in low-demand times. We propose several future works. First, we introduce the concept of elastic demand to our SO model and UE model. The system problem maximizes net benefit to the energy consumers and the user problem is the usual one of finding equilibrium with elastic demand. The Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions can be applied to solve the elastic demand problems. We also propose to develop algorithms for multi-level pricing models and further collect and analyze more field data in order to better understand energy users 2 ̆ 7 consumption behavior...|$|R
