40|$|HomininSpace is {{an agent}} based {{modelling}} and simulation environment for moving hominin groups {{through a large}} scale geographical landscape. Changing carrying capacity in a reconstructed paleoclimate is the ultimate driving force behind dispersal in HomininSpace. Changing temperatures and precipitation levels influence the carrying capacity of the landscape, and {{are assumed to be}} the most influential parameter in the mobility of ancient hominins in the underlying model. This research combines for the first time an environmental reconstruction driven by the results from isotopic measurements with a year by year demographic model for Neandertal groups moving through North-west Europe. The Neandertals utilize the energy levels from the environment {{in the form of the}} meat from large herbivores. The aim is to assess conceptual models underlying the behavior of Middle Pleistocene hominins in fluctuating climatic conditions, including severe stress-inducing environments. The research contributes to understanding past hominin behaviors regarding mobility strategy, dispersal and occupation history within changing environments. Two major types of behavior driving movement were identified and are implemented in the simulations: a dynamic mobility and a static mobility. Dynamic mobility can be best described as hominins following their preferred habitat. Static mobility is an implementation of the source and sink model, where populations stay in the same area and suffer from local extinction when the climate deteriorates and are replenished from remote source locations when conditions improve. Simulations were run from 131 ky BP to 50 ky BP. For 14. 948 grid cells (148 x 101) in each of 81. 000 timesteps climatic parameters are reconstructed, including elevation, temperature (yearly average, warmest and coldest month values) and precipitation levels. From these values a (grid-based) environment is reconstructed through which groups of hominins move, driven by the inferred abundance of large herbivores, representing the energy levels stored in the local environment. For each simulation different parameters can be set through the user interface implementing different models and hypotheses about hominin behavior. Output of the simulation processes include density maps of hominin presence, density maps identifying areas where hominins died and statistical information on hominin groups including sizes, composition, foraging ranges, resource deficiencies, and ages. Simulations can be started, paused and restarted at any point in time. Results can further include a log file with the key characteristics of the simulation, debug information at a desired level, screen dumps in different formats and a playable movie from snapshots at indicated intervals. Movement patterns of the simulated hominins are matched against archaeological dating information on Neandertal material taken from the literature. This data is collected in a comprehensive database which includes site name and GPS location, material <b>dated,</b> <b>date</b> assigned including accuracy and dating method, reference to the literature, and a confidence level. The archaeological data are included as Checkpoints in Space and Time of which 75 individual sites are included. Simulation results are summarized in key values allowing assessment of the level of agreement between model and archaeology on different aspects...|$|E
