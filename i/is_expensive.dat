However, traditional-style solid-wood cabinetry <b>is</b> more <b>expensive</b> and many consumers opt for cabinets that incorporate particle board or plywood to reduce costs.

For example, teak <b>is</b> more <b>expensive</b> than cherry, which <b>is</b> more <b>expensive</b> than maple, which <b>is</b> more <b>expensive</b> than oak. Similarly, solid wood <b>is</b> more <b>expensive</b> than plywood which, in turn, <b>is</b> more <b>expensive</b> than particle board or similar sheet goods.|$|R

5|$|Some {{drawbacks}} {{of using}} organoiodine compounds {{as compared to}} organochlorine or organobromine compounds is the greater expense and toxicity of the iodine derivatives, since iodine <b>is</b> <b>expensive</b> and organoiodine compounds are stronger alkylating agents. For example, iodoacetamide and iodoacetic acid denature proteins by irreversibly alkylating cysteine residues and preventing the reformation of disulfide linkages.|$|E

The modified Atkins diet has been proposed as a lower-cost alternative for those countries; the slightly more expensive food bill can be offset by a reduction in pharmaceutical costs if the diet is successful. The modified Atkins diet is less complex to explain and prepare and requires less support from a dietitian.|$|E
5|$|In dressage, the Finnhorse is able {{to compete}} with warmbloods up to {{national}} levels, and in lower levels it has the upper hand because it can easily perform the required movements, and has smoother gaits that allow for ease of riding. In 2010, a Finnhorse medaled in international paraequestrian dressage competition. In higher level dressage, the breed however it is hindered by its less-flashy movement, restricted by a somewhat upright shoulder. Despite this there are successful dressage horses, {{and a number of}} Finnhorses even earn their keep with their dressage winnings, a notable achievement as competing in Finland <b>is</b> <b>expensive</b> and prize money low. Most Finnhorses used in dressage compete at the national 4th level (US) or Grade IV (GB), though some individuals have competed at the Prix de St. Georges level.|$|E
5|$|Marge is irritated when Homer's snoring (so loud, it can {{be heard}} {{throughout}} most of the city) keeps her up at night. She sees Dr. Hibbert about the problem, and asks about a surgery, but he says it <b>is</b> <b>expensive</b> and tells them to get out when Homer asks him to do it for free. Developing a sleep problem, she sleeps for a night with Patty and Selma, and hears on the news that her old boyfriend, Artie Ziff, is one of America's five richest people. She drunkenly dictates an e-mail to Artie to congratulate him on his appearance, but Patty and Selma doctor it to use sexual terms in an attempt to split up Marge and Homer, much to Marge's horror (for using the word sex on the Internet). Artie, who over the years seems to have developed a rather frightening obsession with Marge (his house is decorated with a large number of 'Marge' sculptures/paintings), flies in his helicopter to the Simpson house to see Marge.|$|E

5|$|The {{speed of}} sound in xenon gas (169m/s) is less than that in air because the average {{velocity}} of the heavy xenon atoms is {{less than that of}} nitrogen and oxygen molecules in air. Hence, xenon vibrates more slowly in the vocal cords when exhaled and produces lowered voice tones, an effect opposite to the high-toned voice produced in helium. Like helium, xenon does not satisfy the body's need for oxygen, and it is both a simple asphyxiant and an anesthetic more powerful than nitrous oxide; consequently, and because xenon <b>is</b> <b>expensive,</b> many universities have prohibited the voice stunt as a general chemistry demonstration. The gas sulfur hexafluoride is similar to xenon in molecular weight (146 versus 131), less expensive, and though an asphyxiant, not toxic or anesthetic; it is often substituted in these demonstrations.|$|E
5|$|Fomepizole is {{a potent}} {{inhibitor}} of alcohol dehydrogenase; similar to ethanol, it acts to block {{the formation of the}} toxic metabolites. Fomepizole {{has been shown to be}} highly effective as an antidote for ethylene glycol poisoning. It is the only antidote approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of ethylene glycol poisoning. Both antidotes have advantages and disadvantages. Ethanol is readily available in most hospitals, is inexpensive, and can be administered orally as well as intravenously. Its adverse effects include intoxication, hypoglycemia in children, and possible liver toxicity. Patients receiving ethanol therapy also require frequent blood ethanol concentration measurements and dosage adjustments to maintain a therapeutic ethanol concentration. Patients therefore must be monitored in an intensive care unit. Alternatively, the adverse side effects of fomepizole are minimal and the approved dosing regimen maintains therapeutic concentrations without the need to monitor blood concentrations of the drug. The disadvantage of fomepizole is that it <b>is</b> <b>expensive.</b> Costing US$1,000 per gram, an average course used in an adult poisoning would cost approximately $3,500 to $4,000. Despite the cost, fomepizole is gradually replacing ethanol as the antidote of choice in ethylene glycol poisoning. Adjunct agents including thiamine and pyridoxine are often given, because they may help prevent the formation of oxalic acid. The use of these agents is based on theoretical observations and there is limited evidence to support their use in treatment; they may be of particular benefit in people who could be deficient in these vitamins such as malnourished or alcoholic patients.|$|E
