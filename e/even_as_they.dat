5|$|Sunday's {{popularity}} waned after World War I, {{when many}} people in his revival audiences were attracted to radio broadcasts and moving pictures instead. The Sundays' health also declined <b>even</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> continued to drive themselves through rounds of revivals—smaller but also with fewer staff members to assist them.|$|E
5|$|Despite the battalion's {{success in}} holding the {{trenches}} at Lone Pine, the August Offensive failed {{to break the}} deadlock as setbacks elsewhere resulted in continued stalemate {{and for the rest}} of the campaign the fighting was relatively static. Finally, in December the decision was made to evacuate the Allied force from the peninsula. During the evacuation, two of the battalion's soldiers, William Scurry and Alfred 'Buntie' Lawrence played a significant part through their invention of a self-firing rifle, which assisted in making the Turks believe that there were still men manning the trenches <b>even</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> were being evacuated.|$|E
5|$|Under , {{the basis}} of {{representation}} of each state in the House of Representatives was determined by adding three-fifths of each state's slave population to its free population. Because slavery (except as punishment for crime) had been abolished by the Thirteenth Amendment, the freed slaves would henceforth be given full weight for purposes of apportionment. This situation was a concern to the Republican leadership of Congress, who worried that it would increase {{the political power of}} the former slave states, <b>even</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> continued to deny freed slaves the right to vote.|$|E

5|$|Crusaders' {{arrival at}} Jerusalem {{revealed}} an arid countryside, lacking in water or food supplies. Here {{there was no}} prospect of relief, <b>even</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> feared an imminent attack by the local Fatimid rulers. There was no hope of trying to blockade the city as they had at Antioch; the crusaders had insufficient troops, supplies, and time. Rather, they resolved to take the city by assault. They might have been left with little choice, as {{by the time the}} Crusader army reached Jerusalem, {{it has been estimated that}} only about 12,000 men including 1,500 cavalry remained. These contingents, composed of men with differing origins and varying allegiances, were also approaching another low ebb in their camaraderie; e.g., while Godfrey and Tancred made camp to the north of the city, Raymond made his to the south. In addition, the Provençal contingent did not take part in the initial assault on 13 June. This first assault was perhaps more speculative than determined, and after scaling the outer wall the Crusaders were repulsed from the inner one.|$|E
5|$|During the war, {{the only}} {{military}} formations {{larger than the}} army group were the military regions, which were defined by geographical boundaries, and the army corps, of which only four were formed and only during the Battle of Wuhan. In effect, the army group was the largest fighting unit of the National Revolutionary Army, and usually exercised command over two or more field armies or several corps, and assorted lesser units. They were roughly equivalent in size to an Army in British or American military terminology. By {{the end of the}} war with Japan, 40 army groups of China were in existence. The civil war saw three additional army groups being formed, <b>even</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> were gradually being replaced by newly formed army corps, by then a largely analogous formation. The following list provides an overview of the army groups in the National Revolutionary Army, including their organization, commanders, and important battles.|$|E
5|$|Max and Steph become {{attracted}} to each other. Max plunges into grief and remorse for bringing estranged wife Clare Cunningham (Gemma Bissix) {{into the lives}} of the people he cares about. Steph feels sorry for him and invites him out. Max tries to kiss her. Steph and Max began to misread each other and, <b>even</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> developed feelings for each other, assume there is no chance at a relationship. When Max took Tom to the safari park to see an elephant named Romeo, that Steph had sponsored for him, Steph found him and they finally told each other that they liked each other and agreed to get into a relationship. Tom initially disapproves of their relationship, but comes around to the idea.|$|E

5|$|On {{the third}} and final day, Bhuvan passes his century, while most of the later wickets fall. Ismail returns to bat {{with the help of a}} runner and passes his half-century, {{reducing}} the required runs to an attainable total. The game comes down to the last over with Kachra on strike. With one ball remaining and the team down five runs, Kachra knocks the ball a short distance, managing a single. However, the umpire signals no ball. Bhuvan returns to bat and swings extremely hard at the next ball, hitting the ball high in the air towards the boundary. Russell backpedals and catches it, gleefully believing that the British team has won — until he realises that he has caught the ball beyond the boundary, giving six runs, and therefore victory, to Bhuvan's team. <b>Even</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> celebrate the victory, the drought ends as a rainstorm erupts.|$|E
5|$|Some new bands, such as London's Alternative TV, Edinburgh's Rezillos, and Leamington's the Shapes, {{identified}} with the scene <b>even</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> pursued more experimental music. Others of a comparatively traditional rock 'n' roll bent were also swept up by the movement: the Vibrators, formed as a pub rock–style act in February 1976, soon adopted a punk look and sound. A few even longer-active bands including Surrey neo-mods the Jam and pub rockers the Stranglers and Cock Sparrer also became associated with the punk rock scene. Alongside the musical roots shared with their American counterparts and the calculated confrontationalism of the early Who, the British punks also reflected the influence of glam rock and related bands such as Slade, T.Rex, and Roxy Music. One of the groups openly acknowledging that influence were the Undertones, from Derry in Northern Ireland.|$|E
5|$|The SIRT {{continued}} {{to lose money}} <b>even</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> rebuilt stations between Jefferson Avenue and New Dorp, almost into the 1970s. Rail traffic via the Arthur Kill Bridge dropped dramatically with the closing of Bethlehem Steel in 1960, and of U.S. Gypsum in 1972. On July 1, 1971, operation of the Tottenville line {{was turned over to}} the Staten Island Rapid Transit Operating Authority, a division of the state's Metropolitan Transportation Authority, and the line itself was purchased by the city of New York. As part of the agreement, freight along the line was to be {{continued to}} be handled by the B On February 28, 1973, the first six new R44 cars—the same as the newest cars then in use on the subway lines in the other boroughs—were put into service on the Staten Island Rapid Transit, replacing the PS Standard rolling stock that had been inherited from the B and had remained in continuous service since 1925. Between 1971 and 1973, a project to extend the high-level platforms at six stations commenced. A station rebuilding program began in 1985, and the line's R44s were overhauled, starting in 1987.|$|E

The lawyer accepts a dinner invitation at the wealthy American's house and brings along Jack. The father urges his daughter to win the affections of the rich, handsome and unmarried young Lord Stanley. Upon his arrival, the father who had shunned him is taken aback and greets him, but Ann refuses to even look at the guest. She ignores him, and refuses to face him <b>even</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> head towards the dining room, but Jack attempts to kiss her and she pulls away. Suddenly, Ann sees it is Jack and embraces him with a kiss.|$|E

25|$|Some species do not feed after metamorphosis, {{while others}} {{migrate to the}} sea or lakes, where they feed on {{different}} species of fish and even on marine mammals.

25|$|Deputy Governor Thomas Danforth: The {{chief judge}} of the court. He views the {{proceedings}} {{as an opportunity to}} cement his power and influence, eagerly convicting anyone brought before him.

25|$|These strikes were qualitatively {{different}} from those waged over union recognition in the 1930s: employers {{did not try to}} hire strikebreakers to replace their employees, while the unions kept a tight lid on picketers to maintain order and decorum <b>even</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> completely shut down some of the largest enterprises in the United States.|$|E

25|$|In {{the last}} years of his life, Wright had become enamored of the Japanese poetic form haiku and wrote more than 4,000 such short poems. In 1998 a book was {{published}} (Haiku: This Other World) with 817 of his own favorite haikus. Many of these haikus have an uplifting quality <b>even</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> deal with coming to terms with loneliness, death, and the forces of nature.|$|E
25|$|The Sisson Documents are {{a set of}} 68 Russian-language {{documents}} obtained in 1918 by Edgar Sisson, the Petrograd representative of the US Committee on Public Information. Published as The German-Bolshevik Conspiracy, they purported to demonstrate that during World War I Trotsky and Lenin {{as well as other}} Bolshevik leaders were agents in the pay of the German Empire to bring about Russia's withdrawal from the conflict. Their authenticity was debated <b>even</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> were widely publicized to discredit the Russian Revolution.|$|E
