I {{had been}} {{commissioned}} by the National Broadcasting Company to write an opera for television, with Christmas as deadline, and I simply didn't have one idea in my head. One November afternoon as I was walking rather gloomily through the rooms of the Metropolitan Museum, I chanced to {{stop in front of}} the Adoration of the Kings by Hieronymus Bosch, and as I was looking at it, suddenly I heard again, coming from the distant blue hills, the weird song of the Three Kings. I then realized they had come back to me and had brought me a gift.|$|E

The operation of General Bülow upon the enemy's flank was a most decisive one; and, even if I had not <b>found</b> <b>myself</b> <b>in</b> a situation to make the attack which produced the final result, it would have forced the enemy to retire if his attacks should have failed, and would have prevented him from taking advantage of them if they should unfortunately have succeeded".|$|E

After the first verse, the chorus follows, with Leto singing, [...] "Lost in the City of Angels / Down in the comfort of strangers / I <b>found</b> <b>myself</b> <b>in</b> the fire burned hills / In the land of a billion lights". During the bridge, he ornaments his vocal lines with melodic crescendos, affirming [...] "I am home". After the final chorus, the song reaches a drum-heavy climax. Emily Zemler from Billboard cited [...] "City of Angels" [...] as an example of variety and experimentation in Love, Lust, Faith and Dreams. She described the song as a [...] "pulsating, subtler track that employs a blipping electronic beat rather than the band's usual rock backdrop".|$|E

Later that year, ex-Moody Blues guitarist Denny Laine joined the McCartneys and Seiwell to form the band Wings. McCartney {{had this to say}} on the group's formation: [...] "Wings were always a difficult idea... any group having to follow [...] success would have a hard job... I <b>found</b> <b>myself</b> <b>in</b> that very position. However, it was a choice between going on or finishing, and I loved music too much to think of stopping." [...] In September 1971, the McCartneys' daughter Stella was born, named in honour of Linda's grandmothers, both of whom were named Stella.|$|E

2500|$|Visitors to Harmony {{commented on}} the {{commercial}} and industrial work being done in this religious settlement along the Wabash River. [...] "It seemed as though I <b>found</b> <b>myself</b> <b>in</b> the midst of Germany," [...] noted one visitor.

The property included an orderly town, [...] "laid out in a square", with a church, school, store, dwellings for residents, and streets to create [...] "the most beautiful city of western America, because everything is built in the most perfect symmetry". Other visitors were not as impressed: [...] "hard labor & coarse fare {{appears to be the}} lot of all except the family of Rapp, he lives in a large & handsome brick house while the rest inhabit small log cabins. How so numerous a population are kept quietly & tamely in absolute servitude it is hard to conceive—the women I believe do more labor in the field than the men, as large numbers of the latter are engaged in different branches of manufactures." [...] Although they were not paid for their work, the 1820 manufacturer's census reported that 75 men, 12 women, and 30 children were employed, [...] in the Society's tanneries, saw and grain mills, and woolen and cotton mills.
