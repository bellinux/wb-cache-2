5|$|Tham sees Yah {{as being}} a good match for Tono in personality, as she shows a {{willingness}} {{to serve as the}} traditional wife. The American scholar of Indonesian literature Harry Aveling writes that Yah's employment as a prostitute was likely a capitulation by Pane to cultural constraints; Indonesian readers at the time would not have accepted Tono having an affair with someone of the same socio-economic status. Mohamad describes her as being fatalistic and notes that she downplays her past by saying that any of a thousand girls in Tanjung Priok could tell the same story; <b>he</b> <b>found</b> <b>her</b> touching without being melodramatic, and notes that Yah was the first prostitute featured portrayed sympathetically in an Indonesian work.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} morning hours of Christmas Day 1975, George looked up at the house after {{checking}} on the boathouse and saw the pig standing behind Missy at her bedroom window.

25|$|On 10 October 1891 (aged 35), {{taking her}} stage name from her father's birthplace, {{she made her}} opera debut in the first English {{production}} of Mascagni's Cavalleria rusticana, as Lola, at the Shaftesbury Theatre, London. (This was under Arditi, and opposite Francesco Vignas as Turiddu: the new opera was a sensation.) A performance was given before H.M Queen Victoria at Windsor Castle in November 1891. She achieved a success, and followed it with a greater one in Gluck's Orfeo ed Euridice later in the same year. Shaw witnessed some early appearances in London, for instance in May 1892 an encored performance of Welsing's setting of Love's Philosophy, and in July in a Miscellaneous Concert (with Ellen Terry, Josef Hollmann, etc.). She had won Shaw's admiration in a performance of Schubert's Erlkonig, but now <b>he</b> <b>found</b> <b>her</b> <b>he</b> <b>found</b> <b>her</b> insufficiently versatile, over-specialized, with a fixed vocal colour owing to over-emphasis of the dramatic lower register: and recommended that she should permit instead the simple beauty of sound in {{the upper part of}} her voice to be heard, when she should take high rank as a singer.|$|E
25|$|On October 4, 1970, {{producer}} Paul Rothchild {{became concerned}} when Joplin {{failed to show}} up at Sunset Sound Recorders for a recording session. Full Tilt Boogie's road manager John Cooke drove to the Landmark Motor Hotel in Hollywood where Joplin was staying. He saw Joplin's psychedelically painted Porsche 356 C Cabriolet in the parking lot. Upon entering Joplin's room (#105), <b>he</b> <b>found</b> <b>her</b> dead on the floor beside her bed. The official cause of death was a heroin overdose, possibly compounded by alcohol. Cooke believes Joplin had been given heroin that was much more potent than normal, as several of her dealer's other customers also overdosed that week.|$|E
25|$|In mid-1967, Seedman, then chief detective for {{southern}} Brooklyn, caught {{the case that}} made his reputation as an investigator who could solve baffling cases. While driving on the Belt Parkway one summer morning near Plum Beach, a young woman named Nancy McEwen suddenly drifted off the road onto the median strip. A police lieutenant in the car behind her pulled over {{to see what the}} problem was. <b>He</b> <b>found</b> <b>her</b> moaning, with her head slumped forward, and called for an ambulance. She died a short time later at Coney Island Hospital, where doctors found a small hole on the side of her head that turned out to have been caused by a bullet.|$|E

25|$|On 26 July Pickle was {{carrying}} dispatches from England for Admiral Lord Collingwood at Cadiz when Cannadey sighted Cape Santa Maria in the evening. He then set his course on that basis. At midnight the lookouts sighted broken water. The helmsman immediately {{tried to turn}} her {{but it was too}} late and she grounded. Pickle started filling rapidly with water, which caused her to tip to port. The crew took to her boats and landed on the Spanish shore. In the morning, Cannadey returned to the wreck where <b>he</b> <b>found</b> <b>her</b> unsalvageable as her bottom was completely caved in. He determined that she had wrecked on the Chipiona shoal. A Maltese diver worked for three days to recover the dispatches.|$|E
25|$|When Indira came {{to power}} in 1966, Lyndon Johnson was the US President. At that time, India was reliant on USA for food aid. Indira resented the US policy of food aid as a tool in forcing India to adopt {{policies}} favored by the US. She also resolutely refused to sign the NPT (Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons). Relations with US strained badly under President Richard Nixon and his favoring of Pakistan during the Bangladesh liberation war. Nixon despised Indira politically and personally. Indira met President Ronald Reagan in 1981 {{for the first time at}} the North–South Summit held to discuss global poverty. Indira had been described to him as an 'Ogre' but <b>he</b> <b>found</b> <b>her</b> charming and easy to work with and they formed a close working relationship during her premiership in 1980s.|$|E
25|$|On 6 June 2012, John McAreavey {{said he was}} handcuffed {{by police}} {{officers}} and they examined his body for marks.

McAreavey said that he had gone back to the hotel room looking for his wife when she failed to return to the restaurant after leaving him to get some biscuits from their room to eat with their cups of tea. <b>He</b> <b>found</b> <b>her</b> unconscious in the bath, with the tap running and laid her on the floor and then tried to revive her. The DNA test made by a forensic expert from England revealed that no DNA traces of the two men accused and the other two original suspects were found on Michaela McAreavey body and at the crime scene except the DNA of John McAreavey.|$|E

25|$|In the forest, Emma, whose {{powers are}} still out of control, wakes up from her vehicle and finds Henry {{standing}} there, telling his mother that everyone was looking for her. But {{as he tried to}} approach Emma, she accidentally pushes him away, resulting in Henry's ear being cut. After Henry takes off, Emma is visited by Ingrid, who tells her that she should embrace her true self, but Emma takes off after the conversation, and heads to Gold's Pawn Shop, where Gold, sensing Emma was in the place by the way the items were coming to life, offered her a chance to rid herself of her powers, and gives her a location as to where to meet him; unknown to Emma, Gold has other plans for her. Back at the loft, David, Mary Margaret, Killian and Elsa ponder their next plan by planning another search, when Henry arrives and tells them <b>he</b> <b>found</b> <b>her,</b> but failed to help her regain control of her magic.|$|E
25|$|William Stewart Halsted, M.D. (September 23, 1852 – September 7, 1922) was an American {{surgeon who}} {{emphasized}} strict aseptic technique during surgical procedures, {{was an early}} champion of newly discovered anesthetics, and introduced several new operations, including the radical mastectomy for breast cancer. Halsted returned to New York in 1880 {{and for the next}} six years led an extraordinarily vigorous and energetic life. He operated at multiple hospitals, including Roosevelt Hospital, the College of Physicians and Surgeons, Charity Hospital, Emigrant Hospital, Bellevue Hospital and Chambers Street Hospital. He was an extremely popular, inspiring and charismatic teacher. In 1882 he performed one of the first gallbladder operations in the United States (a cholecystotomy performed on his mother on the kitchen table at 2am). Halsted also performed one of the first blood transfusions in the United States. He had been called to see his sister after she had given birth. <b>He</b> <b>found</b> <b>her</b> moribund from blood loss, and in a bold move withdrew his own blood, transfused his blood into his sister, and then operated on her to save her life.|$|E
25|$|Six {{weeks earlier}} in the Camelot dungeon, David, Hook, Merlin and Belle waste {{no time at all}} in {{defeating}} Arthur's guards, with Hook impressed by Merlin's ability to see the future. They then reach the cell where Lancelot and Merida are being held, with Merlin telling the others that it is enchanted. Belle then gives Merlin a book of spells and makes the bars disappear. Merida tells the rescuers that Arthur took the wisps which she needed to find her brothers, so Merlin suggests that they need to come up with another way to find them. When Belle asks Merida why she was in the dungeon, Merida tells her that the wisps led her to the sea, but the boat she hid out in belonged to Arthur, and that when <b>he</b> <b>found</b> <b>her</b> he then threw her in the cell. Merida then knocks Belle out with a rock and hours later Bell awakes to find herself in a rowboat with Merida. Belle learns that Merida needs Belle's magic to find her brothers. She further explained that the clans kidnapped her brothers so they can force her to relinquish the throne as she is not married.|$|E

Lehzen had opposed Coburg ambitions of Victoria marrying Albert, believing the princess to be a [...] "second Queen Elizabeth, virgin and independent of male influence." [...] Albert was well-educated, and had just completed a tour of Europe, preceded by years at the University of Bonn. Victoria's court dismayed his puritan German sensibilities. Lehzen and Albert soon developed a dislike for each other; she sought to thwart Albert's will in various ways and <b>he</b> <b>found</b> <b>her</b> personally repugnant and unworthy of befriending the queen, referring to her as [...] "the hag" [...] and a [...] "crazy stupid intriguer".|$|E

La Poype de Vertrieu wrote [...] "it appears that Marseillois shall never be an exceptional sailor, but I am convinced that she will give satisfaction".|$|E

Natasha Henstridge makes a guest appearance as substitute teacher Ms. Ellen. Following the success of [...] "Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo", a large number of celebrities started contacting Comedy Central with the hopes of making guest appearances in South Park episodes, allowing Parker and fellow co-creator Matt Stone to practically take their pick of guest stars. Parker asked for Henstridge solely because <b>he</b> <b>found</b> <b>her</b> attractive in Species, the 1995 science fiction horror film in which she starred.
