40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to use a {{bacterial}} isolate for decolorization and reduction of pollution from textile effluent. Shewanella putrefaciens was isolated from raw textile effluent and used to decolorize the effluent, in unoptimized and optimized conditions. In unoptimized condition the decolorization was 27. 95 % whereas in optimized condition it reached 63. 15 % (Chrysophenine optimized value) and 89. 4 % (Red 3 BN optimized value). It was essential to substitute the raw effluent with co-factors to enhance decolorization process. It was also important to provide suitable culture conditions to improve the decolorization efficiency, in the absence of which the bacterial isolate could not <b>decolorize</b> <b>to</b> the extent required. The physicochemical characterization of the effluent was carried out before and after decolorization process to assess the change in the parameters and thereby the pollution load on the environment. Sulphate (79. 4 %) and Phosphate (78. 6 %) showed highest reduction whereas Total suspended solids, BOD and COD showed 55 %, 41. 1 % and 30. 4 % reduction, respectively. This study recommends the application of shewanella putrefaciens, as a potent bacterial strain in decolorization of textile dyes and effluents under suitable nutritional and environmental conditions...|$|E
