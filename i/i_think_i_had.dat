Warne decided to put Jeremy Fisher into print.|$|E
500|$|Slayer {{embarked}} on the Reign in Pain tour with the bands Overkill in the United States and Malice in Europe; they {{also served as}} the opening act for W.A.S.P.'s U.S. tour in 1987. In late November 1986, drummer Lombardo quit the band; he said: [...] "I wasn't making any money. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> just gotten married, and I figured if we were gonna be doing this professionally—on a major label—I wanted my rent and utilities paid." [...] To continue the tour Slayer enlisted Whiplash drummer Tony Scaglione.|$|E

500|$|Although Piquet's {{result was}} fortuitous, Renault Engineering Director, Pat Symonds, {{subsequently}} praised him for {{stepping up to}} the job of staying with the leaders in the final stint of the race. Meanwhile, Massa commented that his car was not in good order during the race: [...] "It was just slow with difficult stability and also on braking <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> a little problem as well and lost a lot of performance. I didn’t have the car to fight. I tried but it was not possible." [...] Teammate Räikkönen also struggled with low grip and hot brakes {{for the duration of the}} race, while Kovalainen and Kubica had problems with their tyres.|$|E
500|$|Until now, Cardinale's {{own voice}} {{had not been}} used in her Italian films, as it was {{considered}} too hoarse, and owing to [...] her French accent, insufficiently Italian. Not until 8½ was she allowed to use her own voice. Cardinale explained: [...] "When I arrived for my first movie, I couldn't speak a word. I thought I was on the moon. I couldn't understand {{what they were talking}} about. And I was speaking in French; in fact I was dubbed. And Federico Fellini was the first one who used my voice. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> a very strange voice." [...] With her portrayal of Angelica in The Leopard and her brief appearance as herself in 8½, Cardinale achieved the definitive status of a top-ranking star.|$|E
500|$|On 8 February 2010 he {{announced}} his resignation from Fine Gael and from Dáil Éireann, due to having [...] "virtually no influence or input" [...] into shaping Fine Gael's economic policies {{at a time of}} economic upheaval. It emerged that on 2 February, Lee met with the Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny and told him of his intention to resign. Kenny then offered Lee the frontbench position as spokesman on economic planning. Speaking to reporters outside Leinster House soon after his announcement, Lee said it would have been dishonest of him to accept the position: [...] "I had absolutely no input for nine months. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to be honest with myself and honest with the electorate about that and not pretend." [...] Asked if his resignation was a vote of no confidence in Kenny, Lee said there were [...] "certainly lots of large mutterings at the moment in relation to the leader's position". He said he had [...] "minimal involvement" [...] with Fine Gael finance spokesman Richard Bruton. [...] "I had a maximum of two or three conversations with Richard Bruton in a total nine months period. I don’t know how my relationship is with [...] " [...] Lee said.|$|E

500|$|Ralph Waldo Emerson never {{joined the}} Brook Farm community, despite several invitations. He wrote to Ripley on December 15, 1840, of his [...] "conviction that the Community {{is not good}} for me". He also {{questioned}} the idealism of the community, particularly its optimism that all members would equally share responsibility and workload. As he wrote, [...] "The country members naturally were surprised to observe that one man ploughed all day and one looked out of a window all day... and both received at night the same wages". Twenty years later, Emerson publicly denounced the experiment in his collection of essays titled The Conduct of Life. Charles Lane, {{one of the founders of}} another community called Fruitlands, thought the Brook Farmers lived a lifestyle that did not sacrifice enough. As he said, they were [...] "playing away their youth and day-time in a miserably joyous frivolous manner". Like other communities, Brook Farm was criticized for its potential to break up the nuclear family because of its focus on working as a larger community. After its conversion to Fourierism, the Transcendentalists showed less support for the experiment. Henry David Thoreau questioned the community members' idealism and wrote in his journal, [...] "As for these communities, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> rather keep bachelor's hall in hell than go to board in heaven". Even Sophia Ripley later questioned their original optimism, referring to it as [...] "childish, empty, & sad".|$|E
2500|$|In August 1948, {{during a}} visit by an American writer, Chad Walsh, Lewis talked vaguely about {{completing}} a children's book he had begun [...] "in the tradition of E. Nesbit". After this conversation not much happened {{until the beginning of}} the next year. Then everything changed. In his essay [...] "It All Began With a Picture" [...] Lewis continues: [...] "At first I had very little idea how the story would go. But then suddenly Aslan came bounding into it. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been having a good many dreams of lions about that time. Apart from that, I don't know where the Lion came from or why he came. But once he was there, he pulled the whole story together, and soon he pulled the six other Narnian stories in after him." ...|$|E
2500|$|All of {{a sudden}} we had two Australian teams on one tour... I {{certainly}} felt excluded... At one stage in England I was waiting in a bar for my teammates to come downstairs, but because everyone was up the street with Packer, they never came... I was certainly disappointed to be left out. At that stage <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> played nine Tests and was averaging 40 and you had other people who were barely Shield cricketers being called up by Packer. I didn't know the reasons why those guys were in it and I wasn't. That is always a question I will wonder about. I certainly kept being mates with Hookesy... It was a strange feeling. There were times when we were there to play for Australia and some blokes were off at a meeting about something else. There were times when there were arguments in the bar that got a lot louder than what they should have been.|$|E

2500|$|A {{day after}} the Columbine High School {{massacre}} in Littleton, Colorado on April 20, 1999, Stern's comments regarding the incident drew criticism from some listeners. [...] "There were some really good looking girls running out with their hands over their heads...Did [...] try {{to have sex with}} any of the good looking girls?...At least {{if you are going to}} kill yourself and kill all the kids, why wouldn't you have some sex?...If I was going to kill some people, I'd take them out with sex." [...] Hundreds complained to KXPK, the show's affiliate in Denver. Stern argued his comments were taken out of context, and accused critics of being overly sensitive. [...] "I dared to ask if kids had sex. So what? That's how <b>I</b> <b>think.</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> zero intent to make fun of the situation. The point in making that comment was an attempt to try to understand a motive. We didn't know anything about motives [...] and were trying to consider all possibilities." ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{interviewed by}} Jann Wenner of Rolling Stone in 1995, Jagger stated that Taylor never {{explained}} {{why he had}} left, and surmised that [...] " [...] {{wanted to have a}} solo career. I think he found it difficult to get on with Keith." [...] In the same interview Jagger said of Taylor's contribution to the band: [...] "I think he had a big contribution. He made it very musical. He was a very fluent, melodic player, which we never had, and we don't have now. Neither Keith nor Ronnie Wood plays that kind of style. It was very good for me working with him ... Mick Taylor would play very fluid lines against my vocals. He was exciting, and he was very pretty, and it gave me something to follow, to bang off. Some people think that's the best version of the band that existed". Asked if he agreed with that assessment, Jagger said: [...] "I obviously can't say if I think Mick Taylor was the best, because it sort of trashes the period the band is in now." [...] Charlie Watts stated: [...] "I think we chose the right man for the job at that time just as Ronnie was the right man for the job later on. I still think Mick is great. I haven't heard or seen him play in a few years. But certainly what came out of playing with him are musically some of the best things we've ever done". Another statement in Guitar World in October 2002 made by Richards said [...] "Mick Taylor and I worked really well together ... He had some lovely energy. Sweetly sophisticated playing, way beyond his years. Lovely sense of melody. I never understood why he left the Stones, Nor does he, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> ... <b>I</b> <b>had</b> no desire to see him go." [...] Taylor later admitted in the 2012 documentary Crossfire Hurricane that he had become addicted to heroin and hoped to protect his family from the drug culture surrounding the band by leaving.|$|E
