50|$|This reformation of the Ottoman {{legal system}} is {{attributed}} to the growing presence of Western ideology within Ottoman society. Critical areas of progressive law reform such as liberalism, constitutionality, and rule of law were all characteristics of the European system and began taking effect within the sectors of law {{that made up the}} Ottoman legal system. This ideology began to overtake Sharia law in fields such as commercial law, procedural law, and penal law and through these paths eventually into family law. Areas of life such as inheritance, marriage, divorce, and child custody were undergoing progressive transformation as European influence continued its growth.These reforms were also put in place at the insistence of the Great Powers of Europe as well as a response to them. The Europeans had begun to chip away {{at the edges of the}} Empire, and their power was growing in the region. After the Greek War of Independence, Nationalism was on the rise in Europe, and Westerners thought they had a <b>humanitarian</b> <b>duty</b> to intervene on behalf of the Christians and Jews in the Ottoman Empire whom they saw as being unfairly treated. The British especially were gained more power with the Treaty of Balta Liman in 1838, that required the Ottomans to abolish Ottoman monopolies and allow British merchants full access to Ottoman markets, as well as taxing them equally. Overall, the Ottoman Empire was feeling the threat of the Western Powers growing influence over the Empire in general, as well as the Jews and Christians living within the Empire. The Tanzimat reforms came about as a response to this as well as from an Ottoman desire to modernize to compete with the growing European powers.|$|E

40|$|Normative {{theories}} of global justice {{can be divided}} according two criteria: (i) relational or non-relational; (ii) statist or cosmopolitan. Relational authors are either statist or cosmopolitan. Non-relational authors normally are cosmopolitan albeit {{in a different way}} from relational cosmopolitans. Limits of statists (Blake, Nagel, Julius, Sangiovanni) are showed starting with cosmopolitan objections to them. Cosmopolitans can be relational or non-relational, the difference being that relational cosmopolitans (Beitz, Pogge, Cohen and Sabel) expand the basic structure from domestic to global whereas non-relational cosmopolitans (Caney, Buchanan) use moral arguments bypassing the institutional ones. Statist arguments are here adopted for criticizing cosmopolitanism. Cosmopolitanism is criticized for two kinds of reasons: (i) institutional reasons; (ii) moral reasons. The first kind of reasons mainly concern relational cosmopolitans and the second ones non-relational cosmopolitans. In so doing, one plays the cosmopolitan with the statist and the statist with the cosmopolitan. This is not because either cosmopolitans or statists are right. The intention is rather to avoid the pitfalls of both statism and cosmopolitanism by presenting a fresh start under the name of Liberal Internationalism. Then relational institutional support for Liberal Internationalism is provided: normative regionalism. Finally, a moral support for Liberal Internationalism is found: a non-relational <b>humanitarian</b> <b>duty</b> of justice.

40|$|Current {{views on}} global justice often hold that {{affluent}} states are under {{at least two}} duties: a duty to reduce socioeconomic inequalities at home and a duty to reduce extreme poverty abroad. Potential duty conflicts deriving from resource scarcity can be solved in broadly two principled ways. The ‘lexical’ principle requires all disputed resources to be allocated to the weightiest duty. The ‘proportionality’ principle requires resources to be distributed between the two duties according to their relative weight (the weightiest duty receives the largest resource share, but the less weighty duty receives a share too). I argue that the proportionality principle is morally preferable. I show that it is sensitive {{to a number of}} factors that are intuitively relevant when solving duty conflicts: the number of affected individuals, the size of the benefits each individual could get, and the time it could take to eventually comply with the less weighty duty. Some argue that the lexical principle should nevertheless be preferred because domestic egalitarian duties are duties of justice, and they are therefore lexically prior to mere <b>humanitarian</b> <b>duties</b> to reduce global poverty. I reject this view by showing that duties of justice are not necessarily lexically prior to <b>humanitarian</b> <b>duties,</b> and that (even if they were) duties to reduce global poverty can be regarded as duties of justice too...|$|R

However, the resources to perfect humanitarian action are often limited in quantity and scope, so there is no optimal solution. In such a case, as she proposes, a community-policing model would be a second-best solution available, in which “police live in and interact regularly with the community” (Fast 2014, p. 244).|$|R

50|$|When {{carrying}} out their humanitarian function during armed conflicts, medical personnel are protected persons under international humanitarian law, and are entitled {{under the laws}} of war to carry out their work without being inhibited; they may not be attacked, harmed, taken as prisoners of war or persecuted in any way; deliberately attacking or hindering medical personnel from performing their humanitarian work is a serious war crime. The same protection extends to buildings and vehicles identified as part of the medical service. The Army Medical Service uses the red cross as a protective sign recognised under {{the laws of war}}; the sign is used on buildings and vehicles and may be worn on armbands as needed. Personnel are issued identity cards identifying them as protected persons under the Geneva Conventions. Although personnel of the Army Medical Service are members of the armed forces and hold military ranks, they are considered non-combatants under international humanitarian law and thus enjoy protection and neutrality because of their <b>humanitarian</b> <b>duties.</b> The status of medical personnel as protected persons goes back to the 1864 Geneva Convention and was repeated in the subsequent Geneva Conventions of 1906 and 1929.

International humanitarian law makes no distinction between medical personnel who are members of the armed forces (and who hold military ranks) and those who are civilian volunteers. All medical personnel are considered non-combatants under international humanitarian law because of their <b>humanitarian</b> <b>duties,</b> and they may not be attacked and not be taken as prisoners of war; hospitals and other medical facilities and transports identified as such, whether they are military or civilian, may not be attacked either. The red cross, the red crescent and the red crystal are the protective signs recognised under international humanitarian law, and are used by military medical personnel and facilities for this purpose. Attacking military medical personnel, patients in their care, or medical facilities or transports legitimately marked as such is a war crime. Likewise, misusing these protective signs to mask military operations is the war crime of perfidy. Military medical personnel may be armed, usually with service pistols, for the purpose of self defense or the defense of patients.|$|R

40|$|The main aim of {{this study}} is to examine the role of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus in {{relation}} to fundamental changes to the human and political geography of the island. The political background to these changes is given some analysis but the major focus of the study is on the spatial aspects of intercommunal conflict, and the problems created for civilian life by artificial ethnic barriers, barbed wire- fences, sentry-posts, roadblocks, and other physical lines symbolizing the separation of the Greek and Turkish Cypriots, After a brief description of the situation prior to Independence, the centrifugal forces dividing the two communities and resulting in the formation of Turkish Cypriot enclaves are discussed. In the light of these major changes U. N. F. I. CYP. had to cope with many complicated practical difficulties on the ground relating to the separate de facto territorial control of certain parts of the Republic of Cyprus by the Turkish Cypriots. This study stresses the economic and <b>humanitarian</b> <b>duties</b> of what is basically a military peacekeeping force. In carrying out these duties there are many linkages between the non-military tasks of U. N. P. I. CYP. and the human geography of the island. Finally, the period since the forming of the de facto partition line between the two communities is considered in detail, and particular attention is given to U. N. F. I. CYP.

30|$|Responding to {{the needs}} of dying {{patients}} in humanitarian crises is heavily freighted with ethical implications, especially given the possibility of discordance between humanitarians’ values and what actions seem possible in a humanitarian crisis, a reality that De Waal (2010) has described as the tragedy of humanitarian action. These situations also intersect with ideas {{about what it means to}} be a <b>humanitarian,</b> the <b>duties</b> of health professionals, and even what it means to be a human being. Encounters with patients who are last in line within a triage system that prioritizes the rescue and protection of life are remembered with a sense of particular importance. For a few participants, deciding to reserve scarce healthcare resources for those patients who are expected to survive affirms their humanitarian identity and responsibility, as such decisions link to the weight of having to determine how to allocate scarce resources. For most, such choices left participants deeply troubled. Expressed as guilt, outrage, or distress, these feelings are the moral residue (Webster and Baylis 2000) of being involved in compromised care that grates against their sense of doing the “right” or “human” thing and potentially result in moral distress (Jameton 1993).|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} {{prominent}} philosophers of equality {{have argued that}} egalitarian principles of distributive justice are appropriate between members of a given “people,” nation, or state, {{but not at the}} transnational or global level. 1 In that sense they put forward a “relational” as opposed to “non-relational” view of equality: They suggest that egalitarian distribution is appropriate between individuals who stand in a certain relationship with one another. 2 More to the point, this is a specific form of relational view: Although we might attempt to locate a relational brand of equality at the level of a neighborhood, city, region, or even continent, these theorists all argue that this relation is one that adheres between members of a people, nation, or state. A variety of reasons can be given for a membership-specific relational position on equality. I will concentrate here on the connection between egalitarianism and the state, and examine two noteworthy arguments for restricting egalitarian distributive justice to the level of individual states. The first, advanced by Thomas Nagel, suggests that the coercive character of relations between co-citizens of a state makes duties of distributive justice (of both egalitarian and nonegalitarian varieties) exclusively appropriate. A number of other philosophers—including Michael Blake and Mathias Risse—have agreed with Nagel that the presence of coercive relations makes equality between citizens appropriate, but left open the possibility that egalitarian or nonegalitarian principles of distributive justice might nevertheless be owed to noncitizens. Blake’s coercion-based view holds that “relative deprivation” is normatively significant only when it occurs between co-citizens, but, in contrast to Nagel, does not express such skepticism about global distributive justice per se (i. e., “absolute” principles of global distributive justice are not ruled out). Risse has mounted a partially overlapping defense of the normative peculiarity of the state based on its coercive nature but regards that coercion as a sufficient, but not necessary, condition of egalitarianism. Moreover, the specific kind of coercion exercised at the level of states is also present, on a plausible interpretation, at the global level and hence Risse regards Nagel’s argument that only <b>humanitarian</b> <b>duties</b> are owed beyond the state as untenable. 3 Thus Nagel’s argument that no duties of distributive justice are owed beyond the borders of the state presents the most forceful argument for the normative peculiarity of that institution, and demands particularly close attention. The second, more recently advanced by Andrea Sangiovanni, suggests that the existence of relations of reciprocity of a specific character makes a distinctively egalitaria...|$|R
40|$|This study investigates global career {{self-management}} {{behaviors of}} staff in an international governmental organization (IGO). The literature on global careers argues that individuals should maximize their career capital, operationalized in the intelligent careers (IC) concept as competencies, social networks, and motivations of persons related to their careers. The IC concept implies that career capital is transferable and argues that IC components are interrelated and self-reinforcing. We explored these assumptions through {{a case study in}} a United Nations (UN) organization. Using the IC framework we undertook 29 semi-structured interviews with international assignees, HR, and operational experts and conducted one focus group discussion with seven staffing coordinators. We found that the UN organization had high barriers to career capital transfer between head office and field stations. Therefore, the IGO staff experienced conflicting demands in terms of their career capital behaviors. Many staff did not focus on maximizing their career-relevant capabilities or social networks. Instead, they pursued international careers that intentionally sacrificed internal career progression in favor of their <b>humanitarian</b> aid <b>duties.</b> The research adds to the insights of the global careers literature and refines our understanding of the relationship of the organizational center to its foreign affiliates. The findings expose potentially contradictory behavioral implications of elements of the IC concept and call for a context-sensitive refinement. Managerial implications for resourcing, development, career management, and retention are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In {{the current}} global {{environmental}} crisis medical aid and disaster relief {{is given by}} the UN and its branches, by governments and by NGOs, who regard it as their duty to address large-scale <b>humanitarian</b> catastrophes. The <b>duty</b> to give medical aid rests on traditional interpretations of health security and on the bioethical imperatives to relieve suffering and to save lives. However, those principles are not easily reconciled in the current situation of global environmental change and the threats it poses to human security. The global demand for health care has already outpaced resources in many regions, and those resources are likely to decline further. An ethic based on more comprehensive concepts of human security can lessen the contradictions between ethical priorities because it takes into account environmental security. However, that approach leads to clashes with common interpretations of human rights, including the so-called right to health care. The argument {{presented in this paper}} states that, under the imperative of ensuring the survival for humanity in acceptable and sustainable ways, the latest generation of human rights pertaining to health care and environmental quality have become ungrantable. While this does not render them negligible, it does necessitate a new approach to global development aid and health security, with severe consequences for individual autonomy...|$|R
