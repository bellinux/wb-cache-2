5|$|Fixed {{gender roles}} began to become less {{prominent}} in the Western world starting in the late 20th century, allowing men {{to make their own}} choice of career without regard to traditional gender-based roles. Some men who choose this role may do so because they <b>enjoy</b> <b>being</b> an active part of their children's lives, while in other families, the mother wants to pursue her career. For example, of the 187 participants at Fortune Magazine's Most Powerful Women in the Business Summit, one third of the women's husbands were stay-at-home dads.|$|E

5|$|Many young enforcers need to {{establish}} their role early in their career to avoid losing their jobs. Due to the farm systems that most professional hockey leagues use, enforcers who {{get a chance to}} play at the level above their current one (for example, an AHL player getting a chance to play in an NHL game) need to show other players, coaches, and fans that they are worthy of the enforcer role on the team. Players and coaches <b>enjoy</b> <b>being</b> with enforcers who fight for their teams, not for themselves.|$|E

At age 19, while at her favorite nightclub in Anaheim, California, her boyfriend introduced her to a friend who knew the adult actor Peter North and the actor/director Craven Moorehead.

5|$|Coffin did not <b>enjoy</b> <b>being</b> in {{the public}} eye and {{considered}} his job soliciting financial aid as begging for money, which he thought to be demeaning. He stated in his autobiography that he gladly gave up the position once a new leader for the organization was selected. Coffin became concerned about giving money freely to all blacks, some of whom he was believed {{would never be able to}} care for themselves unless adequate education and farms were provided. He also believed the Society should give their limited resources only to those who were best able to benefit from them. The Society continued to operate until 1870, the same year that black men were guaranteed the right to vote under the Fifteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.|$|E

5|$|Pomeranians are {{typically}} friendly, playful and lively; {{but they can}} be aggressive with other dogs to try to prove themselves. Pomeranians are alert and aware of changes in their environment, and barking at new stimuli can develop into a habit of barking excessively in any situation. They are somewhat defensive of their territory and thus may bark when they hear outside noises. Pomeranians are intelligent, respond well to training, and can be very successful in getting what they want from their owners. They are extroverted and <b>enjoy</b> <b>being</b> the center of attention, {{but they can be}}come dominant if not well trained and socialized. The use of toys can be an effective tool in training Pomeranians to spend time alone.|$|E
5|$|Although Bart {{initially}} {{intends to}} drop out of the group as soon as possible, he decides to attend a meeting to avoid a pop quiz at school. Bart dislikes the first meeting, but when he finds out that he gets to have a pocket knife, he decides to keep attending. After a while, Bart starts to <b>enjoy</b> <b>being</b> a member of the Junior Campers, which Homer mocks him relentlessly for. When a father-son rafting trip is scheduled, neither Bart nor Homer want to go together but the end up mistakenly offering and accepting the invitations to do so. Homer does not enjoy the experience, especially when he learns that he and Bart have to share a raft with Ned and his son, Rod. Due to Homer losing the map after making it into a makeshift hat, they accidentally take the wrong turn and find themselves lost at sea. They stay stranded with no food or water for several days, as no rescue is forthcoming; the Springfield Police Department refuses to search for them because the Coast Guard boat they were using is out of refreshments. After several other failed attempts at being rescued or finding food, the raft springs a leak after Homer accidentally drops a pocket knife he was intending to gift to Bart. All seems lost, but then Homer smells his way to a Krusty Burger on an off-shore oil rig. They are saved, and Bart is proud of his father.|$|E

25|$|Lake {{expressed}} interest in renegotiating her deal with Paramount:The studio feels that way about it too. They have indicated {{they are going to}} fuss more about the pictures in which I appear. I think I'll <b>enjoy</b> <b>being</b> fussed about... I want this to be the turning point and I think that it will. I am free and clear of unpleasant characters, unless they are strongly justified. I've had a varied experience playing them and also appearing as heroines. The roles themselves haven't been noteworthy and sometimes not even especially spotlighted, but I think they've all been beneficial in one way or another. From here on there should be a certain pattern of development, and that is what I am going to fight for if necessary, though I don't believe it will be because they are so understanding here at Paramount.|$|E
25|$|Curtiss began active {{testing of}} Genie's {{language}} in October 1971, {{when she and}} Fromkin decided her linguistic abilities had advanced {{to the point where}} they would yield usable results. Their tests measured both Genie's vocabulary and her acquisition of various aspects of grammar, including syntax, phonology, and morphology, and Curtiss conducted the primary analysis of the results. At first the tests were deliberately short, only looking for six to eight responses per test, and over the course of testing they gradually increased in duration. When Curtiss began testing Genie usually did not actively resist but never initiated tests and only did the absolute least amount required, which Curtiss attributed to Genie simply being lazy, making the first year of testing extremely difficult. As Curtiss continued Genie grew to largely <b>enjoy</b> <b>being</b> tested and was typically much more willing to participate, though she still usually continued to less than she was capable of and sometimes playfully gave deliberately wrong answers, and on some occasions would even indicate that she wanted to take the tests.|$|E
