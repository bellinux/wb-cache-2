50|$|Boneless Fish (Hone-nashi Sakana) is a fish-based {{frozen food}} brand and grocery product, {{the process in}} the {{production}} of which was invented by Dairei Corporation (大冷株式会社) of Japan in 1998. It is essentially a fish that has been scaled, gutted and deboned by a skilled worker before being reassembled with a transglutaminase to look like a <b>dressed</b> <b>fish</b> (fish gutted and with its head and fins removed).

40|$|Edwardsiella tarda was {{isolated}} from 47, 88, and 79 % of skin, visceral, and dressed-fish samples, respectively. This species was also isolated from 30 % of imported <b>dressed</b> <b>fish,</b> 75 % of catfish pond water samples, 64 % of catfish pond mud samples, and 100 % of frogs, turtles, and crayfish from catfish ponds. The incidence of Edwardsiella increased {{during the summer}} months, as water temperatures increased. Of several isolation media evaluated, the most effective was selective enrichment in double-strength Salmonella-Shigella broth and subsequent plating on single-strength Samonella-Shigella agar. The significance of the incidence of Edwardsiella in catfish, catfish disease, and public health could not be substantiated...|$|E
40|$|A {{technique}} for conditioning small bony fish {{to make them}} suitable {{for a variety of}} ready-to-use convenience products has been developed. The technique involves subjecting the <b>dressed</b> <b>fish,</b> after suit-able pretreatments, t o controlled thermal processing. The choice of fish, pretreatment and conditions of processing depends on the end product desired. Full yield is assured in the process since it eliminates filleting or deboning. The product has a delicate flavour and retains the basic muscle texture. Products such as breaded fish, cutlets. and frozen curried blocks have been formulated from the thermal by processed fish. A few dehydrated products conforming to Indian tastes have also been developed. The products have been shown to possess a shelf-life exceeding six months...|$|E

This study aimed to investigate the variations in the composition of consolidated burger during 4 months of storage at - 18 °C. For this purpose, 4 types of burgers with a combination of a various percentages of Kilka and Silver carp were produced. The chemical composition by means of total protein, fat, moisture and ash contents were evaluated during preparation (zero phase) and 4 months of storage. Results showed that at zero-phase protein% and moisture% in raw Silver carp was higher, whereas fat% and ash% in Kilka was found higher. Protein content in all groups was decreased during 4 months of storage. The decreasing rate was more rapid in control group as well as treatment 3. Fat percentage was dropped during the storage period and the decreasing trend in treatment 2 was found higher. In the case of moisture, the percentage was declined in all groups and in treatment 1, in particular. Considering the results, it was concluded that freezing could significantly decrease the nutritional value of the consolidated Burgers...|$|R
