5000|$|Dave Kehr of the Chicago Reader {{praised the}} {{adaptation}} by Kazan and the [...] "down-to-earth" [...] performances of James Dean and Richard Davalos. Bosley Crowther, writing for The New York Times, described {{the film as}} having [...] "energy and intensity but little clarity and emotion"; he notes: In one respect, it is brilliant. The use that Mr. Kazan has made of CinemaScope and color in capturing expanse and mood in his California settings is almost beyond compare. His views of verdant farmlands in the famous Salinas [...] "salad bowl," [...] sharply <b>focused</b> <b>to</b> the <b>horizon</b> in the sunshine, are fairly fragrant with atmosphere. The strain of troubled people against such backgrounds has a clear and enhanced irony.For the stubborn {{fact is that the}} people who move about in this film are not sufficiently well established to give point to the anguish through which they go, and the demonstrations of their torment are perceptibly stylized and grotesque.|$|R

50|$|Auggie came <b>to</b> <b>Horizon</b> <b>to</b> avoid a Youth Authority lockup. The {{youngest}} of five children, Auggie {{grew up in}} a middle class home on the fringe of the barrio. Although not a gang member, he was a tagger and had gained an impressive reputation. Eventually he was busted, but the court took mercy on Auggie who, at 16, could barely read or write. All through school, he was placed in educable mentally handicapped classes even though he was actually very intelligent. Adjudicated <b>to</b> <b>Horizon,</b> Auggie's teachers there realized the real problem: profound dyslexia. Although good-natured, Auggie often finds himself in bouts of anger and conflict with both himself and other students at Horizon. Auggie struggles with self-confidence, regularly believing himself to be stupid and a lost cause, and must begin to understand that his educational difficulties do not have to define who he is.|$|R
