After protests by Muslim leaders in the governing coalition, this was withdrawn. It is forbidden for non-Muslims to try to convert Muslims, although Muslims are allowed to convert others. Malay politicians <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> <b>the</b> Chinese and Indian communities not to question Malay rights, for fear of igniting ethnic violence, with harmony between the races and religions being seen as a necessity.|$|E

Typically, interrupts {{caused by the}} execution of a process are handled by the interrupt service routines of the {{operating system}}, and the operating system may then send a signal to that process, which may <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> <b>the</b> operating system to register a signal handler to be called when the signal is raised, or let the operating system execute a default action (like terminating the program). Typical examples are SIGSEGV, SIGBUS, SIGILL and SIGFPE.|$|E

25|$|Cham Albanians {{claim the}} {{returning}} of the Greek citizenship, {{as a first}} phase in order to resolve the Cham issue. They are reported not to have as a primary issue the regaining of the properties, but the citizenship, because this is seen by Chams {{as an excuse for}} their suffering. They argue that the remove of their citizenship was a collective punishment, when even the Greek courts have charged only a minority of Chams for alleged crimes. They <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> <b>the</b> Greek government to have a dual citizenship, a policy followed by Greece {{in the case of the}} Greek minority in Albania.|$|E
25|$|Stephens {{married his}} second wife, Pattie White McClellan, on November 26, 1985. The couple {{separated}} on September 1, 1990, and Stephens {{filed for divorce}} on June 1, 1992. When the case was {{assigned to one of}} Stephens' former political opponents, his lawyer, State Senator Michael Maloney, withdrew the divorce petition and re-filed it the next day. When the second petition was assigned to a different judge, Stephens' wife's lawyer accused Stephens of judge shopping, alleging the second judge had political connections to both Stephens and Maloney. On appeal, the Fayette County Domestic Relations Commissioner reinstated the original petition, saying Maloney should <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> <b>the</b> judge to recuse himself rather than withdrawing and re-filing the petition. Ultimately, both judges recused themselves from hearing the case, and it was randomly assigned to a third judge, who finalized the divorce on September 28, 1993.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 2010s, Kreuzlingen's {{downtown}} began {{to experience a}} dearth of shoppers as many of them, including buses from elsewhere in Switzerland that pass through the city, started crossing the border to shop in Konstanz instead, due to lower prices for basic items in Germany, a favorable exchange rate between the euro and the franc and a German VAT refund that allows shoppers from non-European Union countries such as Switzerland to get back {{as much as a}} fifth of the price of the goods they buy. Elected officials from the city <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> <b>the</b> national government to negotiate a change in this policy with their German counterparts as they feel it is anti-competitive; at the same time some Konstanz residents, feeling displaced in their own hometown by the onslaught of Swiss on weekends, have opened businesses in Kreuzlingen that primarily cater to other Germans.|$|E
25|$|The Marii {{were the}} {{inherited}} clients of the Caecilii Metelli and a Caecilius Metellus had aided Marius' {{campaign for the}} tribunate. Although {{he seems to have}} had a break with the Metelli {{as a result of the}} laws he passed while tribune, the rupture was not permanent, since in 109 BC Quintus Caecilius Metellus took Marius with him as his legate on his campaign against Jugurtha. Legates (legati) were originally simply envoys sent by the Senate, but men appointed as legates by the Senate were used by generals as subordinate commanders, usually becoming the general's most trusted lieutenant. Hence, Metellus had to <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> <b>the</b> Senate to appoint Marius as legate to allow him to serve as Metellus' subordinate. In Sallust's long account of Metellus' campaign no other legates are mentioned, so it is assumed that Marius was Metellus's senior subordinate and right-hand man. Thus Metellus was using Marius' military experience, while Marius was strengthening his position to run for the consulship. The rupture in 119 BC may have been exaggerated after the fact in light of his later and much more serious disagreement with Metellus about Numidia.|$|E
25|$|Currently, {{the only}} NYCDOT-subsidized lines not {{consolidated}} into MTA Bus are those run by Academy Bus and formerly by Atlantic Express until their bankruptcy in 2013. Academy Bus previously operated those routes and others until 2001, when Atlantic Express and NYCT took them over. Although the X23, and X24 routes were absorbed by Atlantic Express, the X17J, X21, X22, and X30 routes were {{absorbed by the}} New York City Transit Authority. NYCT discontinued service on the X21 months after the takeover. Recently, NYS Assemblyman Lou Tobacco and NYS Senator Andrew Lanza, along with U.S. Congressman Michael E. McMahon and NYC Councilmen Vincent Ignizio and James Oddo <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> <b>the</b> MTA {{to look into the}} possible consolidation of the remainder of the NYCDOT routes. In Brooklyn, a company called Private Transportation operates the B110 route; this is franchised but not subsidized by NYCDOT. Atlantic Express also ran the AE7 express route from Travis, Staten Island and Tottenville, Staten Island {{in the same manner as}} the Private Transportation B110 local route. Citing low ridership and increased costs, Atlantic Express canceled the AE7 service on December 31, 2010. Councilmen Ignizio and Oddo as well as Congressman Michael G. Grimm have called on the MTA to revamp that route also.|$|E

[...] The supernumerary pilot was on his third flight with the company and had no prior experience flying the C-47 or DC-3. [...] The panel considered that if the supernumerary pilot had occupied the co-pilot seat, and if the captain had called for fuel cross-feed to be turned ON to deal with a fuel pressure problem in one engine, it was possible the supernumerary pilot's lack of familiarity with the DC-3 cockpit caused him to inadvertently engage the automatic pilot.|$|E
500|$|Ptitim is an Israeli pasta {{which now}} comes in many shapes, {{including}} pearls, loops, stars and hearts, but was originally shaped like grains of rice. It {{originated in the}} early days of the State of Israel as a wheat-based substitute for rice, when rice, a staple of the Mizrahi Jews, was scarce. Israel's first prime minister, David Ben-Gurion, is reputed to <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> <b>the</b> Osem company to devise this substitute, and it was thus nicknamed [...] "Ben-Gurion rice". Ptitim can be boiled like pasta, prepared pilaf-style by sautéing and then boiling in water or stock, or baked in a casserole. Like other pasta, it can be flavored in many ways with spices, herbs and sauces. Once considered primarily a food for children, ptitim is now prepared in restaurants both in Israel and internationally.|$|E

One decision the new King did have to make was whether, in his capacity as Duke of Cumberland, to swear allegiance to Victoria in the House of Lords. Shortly after William's death, Ernest heard from Lord Lyndhurst that Lord Cottenham, the Lord Chancellor, had stated that he would refuse to administer the Oath of Allegiance to the King, as a foreign Sovereign. The King hurriedly appeared in the House of Lords, before his departure for Hanover, and subscribed to the Oath before the Chief Clerk as a matter of routine. Ernest was heir presumptive to his niece until the birth of Queen Victoria's daughter, also named Victoria, in November 1840.
