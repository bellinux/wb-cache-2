5|$|In November 2007, {{a special}} edition of Time on Earth was {{released}} featuring a colour altered cover. The cover's main background area, which was previously a sandy-wheat colour, was converted into an aqua-teal colour, while the tree <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> had a bird in a nest added to it.|$|E
40|$|Semiotics {{of verbal}} and visual {{languages}} can help <b>in</b> analysing <b>the</b> <b>images</b> of <b>the</b> Chemin de la vie éternelle (1623), spiritual manual from the Jesuit Antoine Sucquet, French {{translation of the}} neo-latin Via Vitæ Æternæ (1620). An articulated narrative structure can be found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>images</b> and <b>in</b> their verbal ‘déclaration’; the verbal-visual interaction and the visual structures guide the quest for information. The reader is represented <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>images</b> by different types of ‘delegates’ and convoked by different devices. A rich rhetorical ‘idiolect’ take place <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>images,</b> that are made to introduce the spiritual subjects and to open the meditative chapters, often by showing the passages of spiritual practices, like the preparation to <b>the</b> prayer <b>in</b> <b>the</b> third <b>image...</b>|$|R

30|$|The SIFT {{algorithm}} was applied, and the 20 nearest correspondence {{features of}} the candidate block center <b>in</b> <b>the</b> reference <b>image</b> were used for <b>the</b> correspondence-block searching <b>in</b> <b>the</b> test <b>images.</b> <b>The</b> block centers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> test <b>images</b> were located by calculating the angle and length of the vectors from the feature points to the candidate block centers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> reference <b>image.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{theological}} {{concerns were}} twofold: first, putting {{man at the}} same level as monkeys or apes would lower the spiritually higher position that man was assumed to have in the great chain of being, and second, because the Bible says man was created <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> of God (theomorphism), if monkeys/apes and humans were not distinctly and separately designed, that would mean monkeys and apes were created <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> of God as well. This was something many could not accept. The conflict between world views that was caused by asserting man was a type of animal would simmer for a century until the much greater, and still ongoing, creation–evolution controversy began in earnest with the publication of On the Origin of Species by Charles Darwin in 1859.|$|E
5|$|When {{the nerve}} is damaged, {{it will lead}} to {{weakness}} of tongue movement on one side. When damaged and extended, the tongue will move towards the weaker or damaged side, as shown <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>image.</b>|$|E
5|$|With Lorentz symmetry, {{additional}} structures {{come into}} play. They {{are defined by}} the set of light cones (see image). The light-cones define a causal structure: for each event A, there {{is a set of}} events that can, in principle, either influence or be influenced by A via signals or interactions that do not need to travel faster than light (such as event B <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>image),</b> and a set of events for which such an influence is impossible (such as event C <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>image).</b> These sets are observer-independent. In conjunction with the world-lines of freely falling particles, the light-cones can be used to reconstruct the space–time's semi-Riemannian metric, at least up to a positive scalar factor. In mathematical terms, this defines a conformal structure or conformal geometry.|$|E
50|$|The {{homography}} matrix {{can only}} be computed between <b>images</b> taken from <b>the</b> same camera shot at different angles. It doesn't matter what is present <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>images.</b> <b>The</b> matrix contains a warped form of <b>the</b> <b>images.</b>|$|R
30|$|One may {{consider}} the 10 % amount of added noise to be “small to moderate” relative to <b>the</b> signal <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>images</b> because <b>the</b> latter is highly redundant {{due to its}} 2 D-periodic nature. The 50 % added noise may then be considered as “moderate to excessive” with respect to <b>the</b> signal <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>images</b> for <b>the</b> same reason.|$|R

5|$|For visual localization, {{the robot}} {{estimates}} its position {{relative to the}} aircraft using visual elements (doors, windows, tires, static ports etc.) of the aircraft. During {{the evolution of the}} robot, these visual elements are extracted from a three-dimensional virtual model of the aircraft and projected <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> plane of the cameras. The projected shapes are used for pattern recognition to detect those visual elements. The other detection method used is based on the extraction of features with a Speeded Up Robust Features (SURF) approach. A pairing is performed between images of each element to be detected and the actual scene experienced.|$|E
5|$|Hick used Irenaeus' {{notion of}} {{two-stage}} creation {{and supported the}} belief that the second stage, being created into the likeness of God, is still in progress. He argued that to be created <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> of God means to have the potential for knowledge of and a relationship with God; this is fulfilled when creation in the likeness of God is complete. Humanity currently exists <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> of God and is being developed into spiritual maturity. Hick proposed that human morality is developed through the experience of evil and argued that it is possible for humans to know God, but only if they choose to out of their own free will. Hick acknowledges that some suffering seems to serve no constructive purpose and instead just damages the individual. Hick justifies this by appealing to the concept of mystery. He argues that, if suffering was always beneficial to humans, it would be impossible for humans to develop compassion or sympathy because we would know that someone who is suffering will certainly benefit from it. However, if {{there is an element of}} mystery to suffering, to the effect that some people suffer without benefit, it allows feelings of compassion and sympathy to emerge.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, the Pat Nixon Park was {{established}} in Cerritos, California. The site where her girlhood home stood is on the property. The Cerritos City Council voted in April 1996 to erect a statue of the former first lady, {{one of the few}} statues created <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> of a first lady.|$|E

40|$|In today’s world {{information}} {{worth more}} than anything so {{it needs to be}} protected during communication and other modes of exchanging information. The aim of our work is to implement data hiding efficiently <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>images.</b> For providing security to <b>the</b> <b>image</b> embedded with secret information we take help of histogram shifting and encryption techniques. So that it will be beneficial for security of the data and efficiently transmission of data to the receiver. Improving data hiding capacity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>images,</b> reversibility, and security are the key components of the proposed work. These two techniques we used for data hiding provide good security and also improves the data hiding capacity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>images.</b> with better data hiding capacity. We also gets good PSNR values...|$|R

5|$|In both {{navigation}} modes, Air-Cobot is {{also able}} to detect, track, identify and avoid obstacles that are in its way. The laser data from laser range sensors and visual data from the cameras {{can be used for}} detection, monitoring and identification of the obstacles. The detection and monitoring are better in the two-dimensional laser data, while identification is easier in the images from the cameras; the two methods are complementary. Information from laser data can be used to delimit work areas <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>image.</b>|$|E
5|$|Leon is {{featured}} in the 1998-1999 manhua Shēnghuà Wēijī 2 ("Biological Crisis 2"). A romantic comedy retelling {{of the story of}} Resident Evil 2, centered on Leon, Claire and Ada, was released in the Taiwanese two-issue comic Èlíng Gǔbǎo II in 1999. Leon is also a character <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Image</b> Comics comic book Resident Evil, and in the novels Resident Evil: City of the Dead and Resident Evil: Underworld by S. D. Perry. He appears in the crossover video game Project X Zone 2 as a solo unit.|$|E
5|$|Nandanar {{entered the}} holy fire {{chanting}} {{the name of}} Shiva and reappeared in a new purified form. He looked like a Brahmin sage, wearing matted hair (characteristic of a Shaiva) and the sacred thread worn by Brahmins across his chest. His body was smeared with sacred ash. The gods showered flowers on the Nayanar from heaven and the Brahmins cheered. With the Brahmins, Nandanar went in the garbhagriha and saw Nataraja. The Nayanar disappeared <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> of Nataraja and became one with Shiva.|$|E

5|$|Rongorongo glyphs {{were written}} in reverse boustrophedon, left to right and bottom to top. That is, the reader begins at the bottom {{left-hand}} corner of a tablet, reads a line from left to right, then rotates the tablet 180 degrees to continue on the next line. When reading one line, the lines above and below it would appear upside down, {{as can be seen}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> at left.|$|E
5|$|The Platonic {{influence}} on Maximus' thought {{can be seen}} most clearly in his theological anthropology. Here, Maximus adopted the Platonic model of exitus-reditus (exit and return), teaching that humanity was made <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> of God, {{and the purpose of}} salvation is to restore us to unity with God. This emphasis on divinization or theosis helped secure Maximus' place in Eastern theology, as these concepts have always held an important place in Eastern Christianity.|$|E

5|$|The {{detection}} uses {{pattern recognition}} of regular shapes (rectangles, circles, ellipses). The 3D {{model of the}} element to be inspected can be projected <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> plane for more complex shapes. The evaluation is based on indices such as the uniformity of segmented regions, convexity of their forms, or periodicity of the image pixels' intensity.|$|E
5|$|The {{field is}} so small {{that only a few}} {{foreground}} stars in the Milky Way lie within it; thus, almost all of the 3,000 objects <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> are galaxies, some of which are among the youngest and most distant known. By revealing such large numbers of very young galaxies, the HDF has become a landmark image {{in the study of the}} early universe.|$|E
5|$|The {{forms of}} the glyphs are {{standardized}} contours of living organisms and geometric designs about one centimeter high. The wooden tablets are irregular in shape and, in many instances, fluted (tablets B, E, G, H, O, Q, and possibly T), with the glyphs carved in shallow channels running {{the length of the}} tablets, as can be seen <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> of tablet G at right. It is thought that irregular and often blemished pieces of wood were used in their entirety rather than squared off due to the scarcity of wood on the island.|$|E

Betelgeuse is easily seen above the three stars of Orion's belt on the right. <b>The</b> brightest object <b>in</b> <b>the</b> visual <b>image</b> is <b>the</b> full moon, which is also <b>in</b> <b>the</b> X-ray <b>image.</b> <b>The</b> X-ray colors represent the temperature of the X-ray emission from each star: hot stars are blue-white and cooler stars are yellow-red.|$|R
40|$|Several {{standard}} {{digital image}} enhancement techniques {{have been applied}} to digitized ultrasonic C-scan images of defects in graphite/epoxy composites. Features <b>in</b> <b>the</b> computer enhanced <b>images</b> are much more distinct than those <b>in</b> <b>the</b> original <b>images.</b> <b>In</b> some cases, cracks which are too close together to be visually resolved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> original <b>images</b> are clearly resolved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> enhanced <b>images.</b> Noisy images have been improved by first smoothing the original data and then edge enhancing the smoothed data. The resulting sharpened edges improve the visualization of features <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>images.</b> <b>The</b> application of digital image enhancement techniques has allowed the imaging of defects in composite materials at frequencies as low as 3. 5 MHz. This use of these lower frequencies permits better imaging of defects in thick composite materials...|$|R
