40|$|Driven piles are {{commonly}} used in foundation engineering. Pile driving formulae, which directly relate the pile set per blow to {{the capacity of the}} pile, {{are commonly}} used to decide whether an installed pile will have the designed capacity. However, existing formulae have been proposed based on empirical observations and have not been validated scientifically, so some might over-predict pile capacity, while others may be too conservative. In this report, a more advanced and realistic model developed at Purdue University for dynamic pile driving analysis was used to develop more accurate pile driving formulae. These formulae are derived for piles installed in typical soil profiles: a floating pile in sand, an <b>end-bearing</b> <b>pile</b> in sand, a floating pile in clay, an <b>end-bearing</b> <b>pile</b> in clay and a pile crossing a normally consolidated clay layer and resting on a dense sand layer. The proposed driving formulae are validated through well documented case histories of driven piles. Comparison of the predictions from the proposed formulae with the results from static load tests, dynamic load tests and conventional formulae show that they produce reasonably accurate predictions of pile capacity based on pile set observations...|$|E
40|$|Inclined piles are {{prohibited}} by many codes in seismic areas. Nevertheless the battered effect {{has not yet}} been clarified because very few data are available. The present work is a comparison, at reduced scale in the centrifuge, of the response of two simplified pile groups: a 1 × 2 vertical piles and 1 × 2 pile group with one inclined pile. Two configurations are considered: end-bearing and floating pile group, both with pile heads rigidly fixed with a massive cap. First, repeatability tests under horizontal cyclic loading were performed on both floating pile groups. Secondly, repeated horizontal impact tests were performed on both <b>end-bearing</b> <b>pile</b> groups. These impact tests, which highlight the influence of inclined piles on the inertial response of a group, are a first step for the more complex analysis of the performance of such groups under seismic loads where inertial and kinematic interactions are combined. The first part of this work revealed the influence of sand structure around the inclined pile tip on the repeatability of the tests performed on floating pile groups.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of a computational modeling for damage identification process for an axial rod representing an <b>end-bearing</b> <b>pile</b> foundation with known damage and a simply supported beam representing a bridge girder. The paper proposes a methodology for damage identification from measured natural frequencies of a contiguously damaged reinforced concrete axial rod and beam, idealized with distributed damage model. Identification of damage is from Equal_Eigen_value_change (Iso_Eigen_value_Change) contours, plotted between pairs of different frequencies. The performance of the method is checked for a wide variation of damage positions and extents. An experiment conducted on a free-free axially loaded reinforced concrete member and a flexural beam is shown as examples to prove {{the pros and cons of}} this method. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|A Thesis {{submitted}} to the Dept. of Civil Engineering for the Degree of Master of EngineeringThe two basic types of pile foundations are skin friction piles and end- bearing piles. Friction piles resist the applied vertical load by utilising the shear stresses developed along the pile-soil interface, with the end-bearing {{at the tip of}} pile contributing a small proportion of the total <b>pile</b> resistance. <b>End-bearing</b> <b>piles</b> resist the applied vertical loads mainly by end bearing generated at the tip of pile. There are many instances where <b>end-bearing</b> <b>piles</b> piers are constructed with their tip located inside a cavity made in rock strata: such piles are referred to as rock-socketed piles. The resistance developed by rock-socketed piles and piers is partially due to the shearing stresses generated at the pile rock interface {{on the wall of the}} rock cavity and partially due to the end bearing at the tip of the pile. The load that can be carried by the rock socket is usually underestimated in the design practice due the lack of guidance in relevant codes. This thesis presents the findings of the research focused on computational modeling of rock socketed piles conducted to investigate the behavior of such piles. Ax symmetric finite element analyses were conducted to determine the percentages of load resisted by interface shear along the socket wall and <b>end-bearing</b> at <b>pile</b> tip, for various socket length/pile diameter ratios. Different interface conditions were modelled by varying cohesion and friction parameters input to the interface element, as well as by assuming perfect connection between pile and rock material The finite element results obtained are compared with some available field test data to verify the models. Finally a field test procedure is suggested for deriving load carrying capacity of the socket. Findings and further expansion of this research program would be of immense benefit to state and private organizations involved in deep foundation design and construction. It will highlight whether the use of rock-socketed piles can be economically advantageous over the simple end bearing piles with no sockets, and indicate optimum geometries of rock sockets...|$|R

The soil surrounding the pile is assumed as a linearly viscoelastic layer. The propagation of {{waves in the}} soil and pile is treated mathematically by three-dimensional and one-dimensional theories, respectively. Unlike previous studies of the problem, the formulation presented allows the governing equations of the soil to be solved directly, eliminating the need to introduce potential functions. Accordingly, the dynamic response of the pile is obtained {{by means of the}} initial parameter method, invoking the requirement for continuity at the pile–soil interface.

The programme included measurements of pore water pressures using miniature piezometers, both vertically along the pile shaft and laterally from it, as the pattern of dissipation of this pressure controls the distribution of negative skin friction along pile length at any given time.

The tunnel passed below a continuous section comprising basements, box rail tunnels and other structures. These structures generally responded at the level of their foundations. The presence of a pile group through which the tunnel passed only reduced surface settlement by ~ 50 %. Passing below two existing segmentally-lined LUL tunnels these responded immediately and as predicted, although with somewhat increased trough widths indicating a stiffening effect.

The study is presented in two phases: (1) examination of the modulus variation within the group allowing the elimination of some variables, and (2) comparison of pile settlement predictions {{in the context of the}} significant variables. The research shows that predictions using the former approach match the continuum analyses very closely for friction piles and reasonably well for <b>end-bearing</b> <b>piles,</b> and show potential for reducing computational time and effort in such problems.

40|$|Rotor {{platforms}} {{supported by}} pile-groups typically run through resonance during start up and shut down. End-bearing pile-groups {{resting on a}} rather stiff underground surface cause additional layer-resonances compared with pile-groups driven into a half-space.

Thus the question arises, and is treated in this paper, if this radiation damping for <b>end-bearing</b> <b>pile</b> groups {{is strong enough to}} significantly suppress the additional resonance-peaks. The analysis uses dynamical stiffness coefficients in the frequency-domain for unbounded media recently published by Padrón et al [1].

The proposed model simulates the steady-state kinematic response of a cylindrical <b>end-bearing</b> <b>pile</b> embedded in a homogeneous viscoelastic soil stratum over a rigid base, subjected to vertically-propagating harmonic compressional waves.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{evaluate}} the influence of negative skin friction in pile foundations. Three dimensional nonlinear analyses for a single pile and pile groups were carried out for a specific case and some case studies as well. Contrary to simplified conventional analysis in which the predictions are usually overestimated and could be considered as an upper limit, it was found that the dragload of a pile in a group depends on the surface load, the pile configuration, the pile position in a group, the ultimate skin friction and the interface stiffness. It has been demonstrated that for fixed-head friction pile groups the dragload group effect is significantly greater than in the case of free-head <b>end-bearing</b> <b>pile</b> groups. Moreover, predictions for internal piles have shown considerably smaller dragloads for fixed-head piles, which is in accordance with experimental findings. It has also been demonstrated that when the construction of an embankment precedes the application of the foundation working load, the effect of negative skin friction is considerably smaller than in the reverse case.

40|$|Abstract: At the moment, a Dutch Standard for {{the design}} of piled {{embankments}} is in preparation. For this purpose, existing design models are considered and validated. This paper analyses the basic starting points of the British Standard BS 8006, concerning the design of piled embankments. The major four starting points of BS 8006 are: Marston for the load on the pile caps, no support of soft soil, an assumption for the line load WT on the geosynthetic reinforcement strips between two adjacent pile caps, and a catenary equation, giving the relation between the line-load WT and the strain and tensile stresses in the geosynthetic reinforcement. It is concluded that the British Code has fundamental problems. The coefficients presented in BS 8006 for the Marston equation distinguish arching on <b>end-bearing</b> <b>piles</b> and on friction piles, which does not agree with the assumption of no support of the soft soil; the equations are not fully 3 D and the vertical equilibrium is not generally satisfied: the total load does not equal the sum of the loads on the geosynthetic reinforcement and on the piles. The paper finally proposes an adaptation of the equations so that the method becomes fully 3 D and the vertical equilibrium is satisfied...|$|R
40|$|Pile {{foundations}} {{located within}} consolidating ground are commonly subjected to negative skin friction (NSF) and failures of pile foundations related to dragload (compressive force) and downdrag (pile settlement) {{have been reported}} in literature. In addition, they are normally subjected to axial load and NSF simultaneously. A field study was carried out to investigate load transfer behavior of piles in end-bearing and floating 2 -pile groups in consolidating ground. Moreover, load transfer mechanisms of piles subjected to NSF was investigated in detail by centrifuge tests and axis-symmetric and three-dimensional numerical analyses to achieve three objectives: to investigate response of a single pile subjected to NSF with different pile tip locations with respect to end-bearing stratum, to study behavior of floating piles subjected to NSF with and without shielding by sacrificing piles, and, to study effects of axial load on load transfer mechanism along a single floating pile and shielded center pile within a group of sacrificing piles experiencing locked-in NSF. Based on field monitoring, downdrag developed on floating piles is 70 % more than that on end-bearing piles and neutral plane (NP) is located deeper with stiffer end-bearing layer. Measured maximum β values ranged from 0. 2 to 0. 3 for piles located inside the end-bearing and floating pile groups. Based on centrifuge tests results, the maximum dragload developed at a single <b>end-bearing</b> <b>pile</b> is 60 % more than that at a single floating pile, whereas downdrag developed on single floating pile is 200 % greater than that on a single <b>end-bearing</b> <b>pile.</b> Both centrifuge and field monitoring results show larger downdrag obtained for floating pile than that of <b>end-bearing</b> <b>pile.</b> From centrifuge modeling results, the measured maximum β value at a single end-bearing and floating pile was similar and slightly smaller than 0. 3. On the other hand, smaller β values of 0. 1 and 0. 2 were mobilized at the shielded center piles for pile spacings of 2. 5 D and 3. 0 D, respectively, where D is center pile diameter. Consistent results of β values are obtained between centrifuge modeling and fielding monitoring. The use of a constant β value to estimate dragload on piles will not be realistic as a single β value cannot take into account of the reduction of dragload at the lower part of a pile. Based on centrifuge tests results, NP of a single floating pile was located at around 0. 75 L, where L is embedded pile length into clay stratum. This is consistent with the results as obtained by theoretical solutions, which ranged from 0. 63 - 0. 80 L. The location of NP of shielded center piles {{does not appear to be}} significantly affected by the presence of sacrificing piles. The measured maximum dragload of the center pile in the group at 2. 5 D and 3. 0 D spacing was only 53 % and 75 % of the measured maximum dragload of an isolated single pile, respectively. Correspondingly, the measured downdrag of the center pile was reduced to about 57 % and 80 % of that of the isolated single pile. Deduced ultimate pile capacity of shielded center pile is smaller than that of a single pile. The closer the pile spacing inside the groups, the larger is the reduction in dragload, downdrag as well as ultimate pile capacity of the center pile. This can be explained by numerical simulations of centrifuge modeling. Sacrificing piles "hang-up" the soil between the piles in the group and thus, the vertical and horizontal effective stress in the soil acting on the center pile are reduced. At the same time, smaller confining pressure at the pile tip of a center pile located inside the group causes the smaller soil stiffness and shear strength of soil, so as the ultimate pile capacity of the shielded center pile...|$|E

Geotechnical engineers face a great challenge when they build on/in collapsible soil. Inundation of collapsible soil may take place due to surface running water or raising the groundwater level. In case of surface water, the amount of settlement varies, depending {{on the extent of}} the wetting zone and the degree of saturation in the soil. The case of rising groundwater will produce full saturation in the ground and accordingly, the maximum settlement of the foundations. In the literature, there is lack of sufficient and reliable methods for predicting drag force on piles embedded in collapsible soils. These difficulties stem from the fact modeling collapsible soil analytically is difficult at best, while collapsible soil is governed by the collapse potential of the soil and method of inundation. In this thesis, the results of an experimental investigation on a single <b>end-bearing</b> <b>pile</b> embedded in collapsible soil will be presented.

40|$|Extreme {{variations}} in ground conditions which categorize karstic limestone terrain inevitably create challenges during design and installation of deep foundation systems. For example, {{the elevation of}} rock head may vary greatly over short distances, while for substantial depths below rock head, one may anticipate the presence of major solution features. Such features may be entirely open, or may be partially or completely filled with products of the limestone degradation. High capacity micropiles of the type described by FHWA (1997) have, for some years now, {{proved to be a}} technically and economically viable deep foundation system in such terrain. Frequently, they have been the only plausible solution. This adaptability {{is a result of the}} large variety of small diameter borehole drilling techniques which can be exploited to ensure penetration in such conditions, and also the fact that micropiles transfer load by skin friction. The design implication is that if certain thickness of “good ” rock is encountered, then a certain pile capacity can be guaranteed. There is therefore dramatically reduced risk of piles “punching through ” into a solution feature as would occur in the case of an <b>end-bearing</b> <b>pile.</b> During the last several years, the authors have been involved in the design, construction and performance testing of high capacity micropiles in karst.

To explain this observed phenomenon, nonlinear finite element method (FEM) analyses with a nonlinear gap element have been carried out. The spikes in the acceleration response of the pile cap caused by pounding can be modeled adequately by the FEM analyses.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} the interaction between the piles in a group with a rigid head and correlate the response of a group of piles to that of the single pile. For this purpose, an intensive parametric 3 -D nonlinear numerical analysis was carried out for different pile group arrangements in clayey soils. The responses of the groups of piles are compared to that of the single pile and the variation of the settlement amplification factor Ra was then quantified. The influence of the number of piles, the spacing and the deformation level to the group response is discussed while the effect of the settlement level was also revealed. A previously proposed relationship for predicting a group of piles response based on its configuration and the response of the single pile has been adjusted to extent its applicability for any pile spacing. The proposed relationship provides a reasonable prediction for various group configurations in clayey soils and can be considered satisfactory for the design of most superstructures. Another subject that was examined was the influence of negative skin friction in pile foundations. Three dimensional nonlinear analysis is carried out for a specific case and case studies as well for a single pile and pile groups. It has been demonstrated that for fixed-head friction pile groups the dragload group effect is significantly greater than in the case of free-head <b>end-bearing</b> <b>pile</b> groups.

40|$|Collapsible soil is {{a special}} type of soil, {{classified}} as problematic soil. It possesses a high strength in the unsaturated phase and loses its strength and exhibits substantial settlement when inundated. Many foundation failures occur around the world, many of which involve loss of lives, caused by problems associated with collapsible soils. One {{of the most commonly}} used type of foundation in collapsible soils is end-bearing piles resting on firm soil strata. However, these piles will be subjected to negative skin friction during wetting of the collapsible soil, inducing additional loads. Various case studies have reported foundation failures and excessive settlements upon the wetting of collapsible soil. Researchers are facing serious challenges in dealing with piles in collapsible soils due to the complexity of the problem and the difficulties associated with modeling this behaviour numerically and experimentally. Relatively few investigations pertinent to pile foundations in collapsible soils subjected to inundation are available in the literature. An experimental investigation was carried out to simulate the complex interaction between collapsible soil and a single <b>end-bearing</b> <b>pile</b> under various wetting and loading conditions. The experimental prototype setup was developed and calibrated in the laboratory in order to measure the drag load and accordingly the negative skin friction acting on the pile’s shaft for given soil/wetting/loading conditions. Collapsible soils with different collapse potential values were created in the laboratory by mixing kaolin clay with fine sand at predetermined ratios. A two-dimensional axi-symmetrical numerical model was generated in order to conduct a parametric study by extending the data for a wider range.

40|$|Expansion joints {{increase}} {{both the}} initial cost {{and the maintenance}} cost of bridges. Integral abutment bridges provide an attractive design alternative because expansion joints are eliminated from the bridge itself. However, the piles in these bridges are subjected to horizontal movement as the bridge expands and contracts during temperature changes. The objective {{of this research was}} to develop a method of designing piles for these conditions. Separate field tests simulating a pile and a bridge girder were conducted for three loading cases: (1) vertical load only, (2) horizontal displacement of pile head only, and (3) combined horizontal displacement of pile head with subsequent vertical load. Both tests (1) and (3) reached the same ultimate vertical load, that is, the horizontal displacement had no effect on the vertical load capacity. Several model tests were conducted in sand with a scale factor of about 1 : 10. Experimental results from both the field and model tests were used to develop the vertical and horizontal load-displacement properties of the soil. These properties were input into the finite element computer program Integral Abutment Bridge Two-Dimensional (IAB 2 D), which was developed under a previous research contract. Experimental and analytical results compared well for the test cases. Two alternative design methods, both based upon the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) Specification, were developed. Alternative One is quite conservative relative to IAB 2 D results and does not permit plastic redistribution of forces. Alternative Two is also conservative when compared to IAB 2 D, but plastic redistribution is permitted. To use Alternative Two, the pile cross section must have sufficient inelastic rotation capacity before local buckling occurs.

40|$|The {{engineering}} {{community has}} devoted much effort {{to understanding the}} response of soil-structure systems to seismic ground motions, but {{little attention to the}} effects of an outcropping fault offset. The 1999 earthquakes of Turkey and Taiwan, offering a variety of case histories of structural damage due to faulting, have (re) fueled the interest on the subject. This paper presents a methodology for design of bridges against tectonic deformation. The problem is decoupled in two analysis steps: the first (at the local level) deals with the response of a single pier and its foundation to fault rupture propagating through the soil, and the superstructure is modeled in a simplified manner; and the second (at the global level) investigates detailed models of the superstructure subjected to the support (differential) displacements of Step 1. A parametric study investigates typical models of viaduct and overpass bridges, founded on piles or caissons. Fixed-head piled foundations are shown to be rather vulnerable to faulting-induced deformation. <b>End-bearing</b> <b>piles</b> in particular are unable to survive bedrock offsets exceeding 10 cm. Floating piles perform better, and if combined with hinged pile-to-cap connections, they could survive much larger offsets. Soil resilience is beneficial in reducing pile distress. Caisson foundations are almost invariably successful. Statically-indeterminate superstructures are quite vulnerable, while statically-determinate are insensitive (allowing differential displacements and rotations without suffering any distress). For large-span cantilever- construction bridges, where a statically determinate system is hardly an option, inserting resilient seismic isolation bearings is advantageous as long as ample seating can prevent the deck from falling off the supports. An actual application of the developed method is presented for a major bridge, demonstrating the feasibility of design against tectonic deformation. © 2008 Institute of Engineering Mechanics, China Earthquake Administration and Springer-Verlag GmbH...|$|R
40|$|The {{rotational}} restraint coefficient {{at the top}} of a pier and the rotational restraint coefficient at {{the bottom}} of the pier (that is, the degree of fixity in the foundation of the pier) are used to determine the effective length factor of the pier. Moreover, the effective length factor of a pier is used to determine the slenderness ratio of the pier, while the degree of fixity in the foundation of a pier is used to perform the first-order elastic analysis in order to compute the pier deflection. Finally, the slenderness ratio of the pier is used to determine if the effect of slenderness shall be considered in the design of the pier, while the magnitude of the pier deflection resulting from the first-order analysis is used to determine if the second-order force effect (the p-∆ effect) shall be considered in the design of the pier. The computations of the slenderness ratio and the deflection of a pier, however, have conventionally been carried out by assuming that the base of the pier is rigidly fixed to the footing, and the footing in turn, is rigidly fixed to the ground. Other degrees of footing fixity have been neglected by the conventional approach. In this paper, two examples are demonstrated for the slenderness ratio computation and the first-order deflection analysis for bridge piers with various degrees of footing fixity (including footings anchored on rock, footings not anchored on rock, footings on soil, and footings on multiple rows of <b>end-bearing</b> <b>piles)</b> recommended by the AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specifications. The results from the examples indicate that the degree of footing fixity should not be neglected since it significantly affects the magnitude of the slenderness ratio and the deflection of the pier...|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of Negative skin friction (NSF) {{is regarded as}} a common problem in the design and construction of pile foundations in consolidating ground. Several authors have reported failure of pile foundations related to pile settlement (downdrag). To date most of the current design approaches consider mainly on ultimate limit state (dragload) and overestimate the effect of NSF on pile behaviour. With an aim to clarify aspects of pile behaviour subjected to NSF, four centrifuge tests have been conducted. The research includes investigations of NSF developed on single piles with different pile tip location with respect to the bearing layer as well as changes of dragload and downdrag of the centre pile inside the 3 x 3 pile group under the application of axial load. Moreover, shielding effects on dragload and downdrag in 3 x 3 pile groups at 2. 5 D and 3. 0 D spacing are investigated. The observed pile behaviour is to be compared with relevant previous studies and numerical back analysis. Combined with the findings from this study and other reported test results in literature, it suggests that the smaller of the distance of pile tip from the bearing stratum, the more significant the effect from the bearing stratum on the {{development of}} dragload and the larger the magnitude of dragload and vice versa. In contrast to the variation of dragload with pile tip location, the magnitude of downdrag with pile tip located at 0. 5 D away from the bearing stratum is about twelve times as large as the one with pile tip rest on bearing stratum. Regarding the combined effect of applied axial load and dragload on a pile where its pile tip is located at 0. 25 D from the bearing stratum, dragload developed on the centre pile is completely eliminated for the cases where pile spacing equal to 2. 5 D and 3 D when axial loads of 150 % and 175 % of the maximum dragload developed prior to the application of axial load (Pmax) is applied. The values of required axial load are comparatively close with published test result of floating pile but are about halve the value of <b>end-bearing</b> <b>pile.</b> (i. e., 3 Pmax). For the two 3 x 3 pile groups at 2. 5 D and 3. 0 D, the maximum dragload of the centre pile is 53 % and 36 % of the maximum dragload of the single isolated pile respectively. At the same time, the shielding effects on downdrag of the centre pile is about 40 % and 19 % of a single isolated pile in the case where the pile spacing equal to 2. 5 D and 3. 0 D respectively. Shielding effect on downdrag is smaller than shielding effect on dragload regardless of pile spacing and shielding effect on downdrag is largest for the centre pile as compared with other piles inside the group and the isolated pile...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT It {{has been}} {{believed}} that the static load test is the most reliable method to obtain the load-settlement relation of a pile. Most static load tests are conducted using reaction piles as the reaction system. However, some researches {{point out that the}} influence of the reaction piles on the measured load-settlement relation may not be neglected, and that an analysis of the measured data is required to obtain a true load-settlement of the. From this point of view, the dynamic load testing or the rapid load testing may not be necessarily inferior to the static load test, considering cost and time performance of the dynamic load test as well. In this study, a new computer program for analysing the stress-wave propagation phenomena in pile driving was developed using a finite difference scheme and rational soil resistance models. Verification analyses of the proposed method are conducted first, and then the developed method is applied to the dynamic and static load tests on an <b>end-bearing</b> concrete <b>pile...</b>|$|R
40|$|Pile {{foundations}} {{are widely}} used, mainly to transmit structural load to an underlying stiffer soil or rock. This limit state load a certain pile can sustain without failure {{is known as}} pile ultimate bearing capacity. During design stage load-tests are performed in-situ on test piles to determine, among others, {{the value of the}} bearing capacity. Commonly static tests are performed as they provide the most reliable data. Dynamic tests are much more cost-effective but have a series of shortcomings, mainly the fact that they introduce stress-waves on the pile and that require calibration with the static values. To overcome both nature-kind problems, a new type of test in-between the previous ones, i. e. the pseudostatic test, has been developed. It is still a dynamic test but the loading pulse lasts longer (70 - 150 ms), 20 times the dynamic pulse, emphasizing the static component. Hence, it is both an economical and reliable option as requires no calibration with the static load-displacement curves. Therefore, it is interesting to get more insight on it. Two main factors can influence the bearing capacity of a pile measured on the in-situ tests, namely, loading rate and excess pore pressures. In cases like The Netherlands, where <b>end-bearing</b> <b>piles</b> are driven into saturated sand, these two concepts may play an important role. A previous study had been carried out in dry sand and did not find a remarkable loading rate effect. However, for the case of saturated sand the soil response remains unknown. This research investigates the topic, the objective is to get more insight on the excess pore pressure generation and dissipation, evaluate the static-pseudostatic correlation and investigate the possibility of providing effective predictive tools. The research has been structured in three parts. First a series of experimental scaled tests have been carried out for three loading rates: a CPT (20 mm/s), a static test (1 mm/s) and a pseudostatic test (up to 250 mm/s). The sample consisted in saturated sand that was prepared by means of a fluidizaton-vibration system. Standard sounding rots with a piezocone acted as the pile; five values were recorded: force on the pile head, shaft friction, tip resistance, displacement and acceleration. Later on, the performed scaled tests have been modeled analytically and numerically. An analytical model based on the cone model of Wolf has been developed. Only the soil underneath the pile tip is considered and it is modeled as an elastoplastic material under static fully undrained loading followed by consolidation. PLAXIS is the program used for the numerical model...|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{need for}} regional development has led engineers to find safe ways {{to construct the}} infrastructure of transportation on soft soils. Soft soil {{is not able to}} sustain external loads without having large deformations. The geotechnical properties of soft soil which is known for its low bearing capacity, high water content, high compressibility and long term settlement as well. In pavement engineering, either highway or runway as an infrastructure, a pavement encompasses three important parts namely traffic load, pavement and subgrade. Traffic load generated from tire pressure of vehicle and/or airplane wheels are usually around 550 kPa even more {{on the surface of the}} pavement. Pavement generally comprises granular materials with unbounded or bounded materials located between traffic load and subgrade, distributing the load to surface of subgrade. One of the promising soil improvement techniques is a piled embankment. When geosynthetics layer is unrolled over piles, it is known as geosynthetics supported piled embankment. Particularly in deep soft soil, when piles do not reach a hard stratum due to large thickness of the soft soil, the construction is an embankment on floating piles. Furthermore, because of different stiffness between piles and subsoil, soil arching effect would be developed there. By using Finite Element analysis, some findings resulted from experimental works and several field tests around the world as field case studies are verified. Some important findings are as follows: the stress concentration ratio is not a single value, but it would be changed depending on the height of embankment, consolidation process of subsoil, surcharge of traffic load, and tensile modulus of geosynthetics as well. Ratio height of embankment to clear piles spacing (h/s) around 1. 4 can be used as a critical value to distinguish between low embankment and high embankment. When geosynthetics is applied to reinforce a pavement/embankment, the vertical distance of geosynthetics layers and number of geosynthetics layers depend on the quality of pavement material. The lower layer of geosynthetics withstands a tensile stress higher than upper layer. Primary reinforcements for geosynthetics in piled embankments are located at span between piles with maximum strains at zones of adjacent piles. Traffic load that passes through on the surface of the pavement can reduce the soil arching, but it can be restored during the off peak hours. Settlements of embankments on floating piles can accurately be modelled using the consolidation calculation type, whereas the <b>end-bearing</b> <b>piles</b> may be used the plastic calculation type. Longer piles can be effectively applied to reduce a creep. By applying length of floating piles more than 20 % of soft soil depth, it would have a significant impact to reduce a creep on a deep soft soil...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the past}} couple of decades, the focus of {{foundation}} design has shifted from ultimate limit state to serviceability limit state, particularly where ground conditions are challenging. Nowadays, the serviceability of a deep foundation system can be considered using advanced constitutive laws within computational software packages that are capable of considering the foundation system as a continuum. However, these methods can become both computationally-intensive and time-consuming if non-linear pile-soil-pile interaction and large groups with non-standard geometries are to be modelled. Simplified methods, generally empirical in nature, can be used in preliminary foundation design, alleviating the computational effort associated with more rigorous analyses. However, some of the assumptions therein are over-simplified. The goal of this thesis is to develop new simplified methods which are relatively easy to implement, yet founded where necessary in parametric studies using rigorous continuum analyses. Both absolute and differential settlement performance of pile groups are considered using PLAXIS 2 -D and PLAXIS 3 -D Foundation finite element software packages and primarily the Hardening Soil and MIT-S 1 constitutive models. Previous empirical solutions from linear elastic work had identified a significant dependence of stiffness efficiency on pile group size and group spacing. In this study, the effect of the pile length-to-diameter ratio, the compressibility of a stiff bearing stratum beneath the pile group and the depth below ground level to the stiff bearing stratum are also considered as variables. As a first stage of this thesis, a set of empirical equations has been formulated which has been shown to predict the stiffness efficiency of pile groups in a database very well. For the purpose of developing a more comprehensive semi-empirical solution (analytical in large parts), the load transfer (t-z) method is employed to describe the nonlinear behaviour of a single pile. The Interaction Factor Method (IFM) was then used to extend this analysis to pile groups. A number of important features associated with single pile and pile group behaviour were included herein that have not been considered in previous studies: (i) Pile-to-pile interaction effects were considered within a non-linear framework. In the course of this exercise, the author distinguishes between alternative definitions of interaction factor and shows that settlement predictions using IFM match continuum analyses very closely for friction piles and reasonably well for <b>end-bearing</b> <b>piles.</b> (ii) A numerical study on single pile and pile group installation effects was undertaken using advanced constitutive models. A variation on the traditional cavity expansion method (CEM) was adopted for the analysis of single pile effects while group effects were investigated using a new method based on volumetric expansion of tunnels in PLAXIS 2 -D; these effects were subsequently incorporated into the analytical approach by means of a simplified model. (iii) In addition, the reinforcing effects of additional group piles on the soil continuum and pre-failure pile-soil slip has also been taken into account; this is the first study to include these effects in a nonlinear analytical approach. On the subject of differential settlement, an extensive numerical study of the angular distortion of piled foundations, which has been documented as the most influential settlement characteristic in the cracking of buildings, has also been undertaken and formulated into a set of fully-normalised trends. A consistent trend between angular distortion and stiffness efficiency for corresponding pile cap rigidities was evident. The aforementioned simplified finite element-based approach was developed using a similar framework and is thus a compatible way to estimate angular distortion for the group. Through comparisons with previously published field test data and measurements from buildings in addition to numerical simulations, the results presented in this thesis indicate that the proposed approaches provide a viable framework for the serviceability design of pile groups while alleviating the computational effort and expense associated with rigorous continuum analyses...|$|R
