40|$|In the {{telecommunications}} industry, {{the market is}} highly global as well as competitive {{in this era of}} Internet and data communications. <b>Telecommunications</b> <b>carriers</b> compete with not only other <b>telecommunications</b> <b>carriers</b> providing broadband access and mobile communication but also network application and service providers, which are significant threats for <b>telecommunications</b> <b>carriers.</b> It is difficult for <b>telecommunications</b> <b>carriers</b> to control the market for two significant reasons. Firstly, due to the maturity of technology as well as customers, network services have become commoditized. Secondly, telecommunications network services are vulnerable to over-the-top services based on the Internet. This study aims to investigate how large <b>telecommunications</b> <b>carriers</b> can continue to be competitive in such an environment. This paper focuses on three kinds of strategic options that enable large high-tech companies to continue to make profits; internal R&D, growth and diversification, and M&A. In the second chapter the author focuses on IBM and Cisco, which are good examples of how large companies have evolved over time, combining these three strategies. Then, the use of the three strategies by major <b>telecommunications</b> <b>carriers</b> is investigated. Finally, in the fourth chapter, the author analyzes the future competitiveness of the NTT Group, the major <b>telecommunications</b> <b>carrier</b> in Japan, using these strategies within the next decade. by Shingo Kawai.

50|$|The Second Computer Inquiry is {{the second}} {{proceeding}} in the FCC trilogy The Computer Inquiries, which created the FCC's policy of regulating {{the way in which}} telecommunications carriers' networks are opened up and made available to enhanced services (aka computer networks). The proceeding reformed the First Computer Inquiry which established the policy objectives that <b>telecommunications</b> <b>carriers</b> which have market power and the ability to discriminate be regulated, and computer services which were competitive, innovative, and had low barriers to entry, would not be regulated. The FCC saw great promise in the computer services industry and sought to ensure that the telecommunications network was adequately meeting the needs of the computer market. In the Second Computer Inquiry, the FCC created the basic service (<b>telecommunications</b> <b>carriers,</b> regulated) versus enhanced service (computer services, unregulated) dichotomy. Broadly speaking, the FCC concluded that basic <b>telecommunications</b> <b>carriers</b> networks must be open, and, if a <b>telecommunications</b> <b>carrier</b> offers enhanced services, it must do so through a separate corporate subsidiary. Everything that the <b>telecommunications</b> <b>carrier</b> sold to its own enhanced service, must be sold to all other enhanced services on the same terms and conditions. The FCC also restricted the ability of <b>telecommunications</b> <b>carriers</b> to bundle <b>telecommunications</b> services with customer premises equipment (CPE), creating a new competitive market for telephones and modems. These rules were generally codified in Section 64.702 of the Federal Communications Commission's Rules and Regulation.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} impact of iPhone, a {{representative}} of smartphones, on <b>telecommunications</b> <b>carriers</b> and handset manufacturers in U. S. A, Europe, and Japan. We choose the event study methodology to evaluate {{the impact of}} iPhone emergence.

Our research question is How does the emergence of iPhone generate {{the impact on the}} <b>telecommunications</b> <b>carriers</b> and the handset manufactures in U. S. A, Europe and Japan? The results show that the impacts of iPhone present differently on the <b>telecommunications</b> <b>carriers</b> and the handset manufacturers. Regarding the impact on <b>telecommunications</b> <b>carriers,</b> 1) the results of event study show that the iPhone-affiliated-carriers, such as AT&T, Telefonica and Soft Bank, are neutral by the iPhone emergence, but non iPhone-affiliated-carriers have negative impact by the iPhone emergence. 2) the results of financial profits show that almost of all <b>telecommunications</b> <b>carriers</b> in U. S. A and Japan grow their profits after the iPhone emergence, but many of the <b>telecommunications</b> <b>carriers</b> in Europe reduce their profits after the iPhone emergence regardless of iPhone affiliation. Regarding the impact on handset manufacturers, the results of event study and financial profits show that 1) Apple, iPhone manufacture, have positive impact and grow profit by the iPhone emergence, but 2) many of other handset manufacturers have negative impact and reduce profit by the iPhone emergence...|$|R

Our research question is Does {{the emergence of new}} terminals generate significant imact on the <b>telecommunications</b> <b>carriers</b> and the TV media companies? The results show that the impacts of new terminals appear differently on <b>telecommunications</b> <b>carriers</b> and on TV media companies. 1) Regarding <b>telecommunications</b> <b>carriers,</b> some of the smartphone and tablet PCs generate significant positive imapct or no impact on smartphoner (or tablet PC) -affiliated telecom carriers, but generate significant negative impact on non-smartphone (or tablet PC) -related telecom carriers, 2) Regarding TV media companies, tablet PCs and smart TVs do not generate any significant impact on any researched TV medeia companies. The results imply some further reasons why the new terminals emergences generate no significant imapct on TV media companies. The paper presents three possible reasons. 1) The new terminals are not so powerful that they do not influence TV media companies. 2) The new terminals are sufficiently powerful but their imapct does not go to the TV industry. 3) The new terminals are sufficiently powerful but the services by the new terminals do not compete against incumbent TV media services.
