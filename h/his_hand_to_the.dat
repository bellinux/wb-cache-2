25|$|Albert pleads for {{the horse}} with Emilie's grandfather, who at first remains unmoved. The {{old man is}} surprised, however, when the horse chooses to return to Albert, and he {{presents}} Albert with the military pennant, asking him what it is. Albert's quick recognition of the pennant convinces the grandfather that Joey is indeed his horse. He gives Joey back to Albert, saying that it's what Emilie would have wanted. Albert returns with Joey to his family's farm, where he returns the pennant to his father. The elder Narracott extends <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> boy, now a man and like him, a former soldier.|$|E
25|$|David {{gathered}} {{together all the}} chosen men of Israel — 30,000 in all — and went to retrieve the Ark of the Covenant from Baale-judah. They brought the Ark {{out of the house}} of Abinadab and set it on a new cart. Abinadab's sons Uzzah and Ahio drove the cart, with Ahio going before the Ark. David and the Israelites played with all manner of instruments — harps, psalteries, timbrels, sistra, and cymbals. When they came to the threshing-floor of Nacon, the oxen stumbled, and Uzzah put out <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Ark. In anger, God smote Uzzah for his error, and Uzzah died by the Ark.|$|E
25|$|In a {{press conference}} on November 10, 2008, Tomita {{announced}} his retirement from the sport. Tomita cited the decline of his strength and the inability to continue performing gymnastics {{at a high level}} as the reason for his retirement. Tomita's final competition as an elite gymnast was in the World Cup Final in Madrid, Spain, where the only event championships were contested with no all-around competition. Tomita competed in both the parallel bars and high bar competition. Tomita was 6th at the parallel bars because of some visible mistakes. In his final competition in the high bar, Tomita performed with his signature skills and elegance, the only obvious error he committed was when he touched <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mat after his dismount. Nevertheless, he capped this final competition with a bronze medal.|$|E

Ulrica reveals that he will be killed by the next man who shakes his hand. He laughingly dismisses her prophecy and offers <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> courtiers, who refuse to take it. Renato arrives and shakes Riccardo's hand in greeting. Riccardo's true identity is now revealed and he is acclaimed by the people.|$|E

Then in the parashah, God killed Nadab and Abihu [...] "when they drew near" [...] to the Ark, while in the haftarah, God killed Uzzah when he [...] "put forth <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Ark." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{this first}} foray into {{theoretical}} economics, Tugan-Baranovsky turned <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> writing of biography, contributing short popular sketches of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon and John Stuart Mill to a series entitled [...] "Lives of Remarkable Men," [...] produced by the publisher Pavlenkov. In these roughly 80-page books Tugan-Baranovsky was highly critical of Proudhon for his lack of internal consistency, stylistic obscurity, lack of imagination, and hypocritical support of the regime of Louis Napoleon. He was much more sympathetic to Mill, hailing the socialist economist as one who [...] "more than anyone else helped the spread throughout the civilized world of a right understanding {{of the spirit of}} contemporary science, based on the study of nature." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ching {{ran into}} {{disciplinary}} trouble during the 2009 campaign. In July 2009, Ching was fined $500 by MLS for his comments regarding the officiating of the Dynamo's 2–1 loss to Seattle Sounders FC (a game Ching {{did not play}} in due to participation in the 2009 CONCACAF Gold Cup). On his Twitter page, Ching referred to the referee as [...] "a joke" [...] and [...] "a cheat" [...] for calling a Fredy Montero shot cleared off the line a goal. Ching scored the opening goal from a Brad Davis free kick in 3-2 win vs. Real Salt Lake on August 19 but was ejected in the 82nd minute for hard foul, the first red card in the 162 games of his MLS career. He was ejected again in next MLS game, a 0-0 tie vs. Los Angeles Galaxy on October 18, for raising <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> face of an opponent.|$|E

After crossing the river at Eleusis, about four miles from Alexandria, he was met by the Roman commissioners, to whom he gave a friendly greeting and held out his hand to Popilius. Popilius, however, placed in his hand the tablets on which was written the decree of the senate and told him first of all to read it. After reading it through, he said he would call his friends into council and consider what he ought to do. Popilius, stern and imperious as ever, drew a circle round the king with the stick he was carrying and said, [...] "Before you step out of that circle give me a reply to lay before the senate." [...] For a few moments he hesitated, astounded at such a peremptory order, and at last replied, [...] "I will do what the senate thinks right." [...] Not till then did Popilius extend <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> king as to a friend and ally. Antiochus evacuated Egypt at the appointed date, and the commissioners exerted their authority to establish a lasting concord between the brothers, as they had as yet hardly made peace with each other.

2500|$|Returning to England, he {{was head}} of the history {{department}} at Kelly College in Tavistock for five years, followed by fourteen years at Culham College of Education as principal lecturer and head of the history department. He was able to combine his love of cricket with his college duties by instituting the biannual cricket matches between the History Department and his village cricket team of North Moreton for whom he was wicketkeeper and captain. One regularly told story was that he conducted an interview out on the cricket square when one potential teaching student applied who was already on the books of Yorkshire Cricket Club! Unfortunately for Howat, the student did not take up the place which was presumably offered to him, but did go on to have a reasonably successful cricket career. He had an abrupt tutoring technique and once (at least) locked the door when the time of his tutor group was due to start which left only one student in the room (at the magnificent mansion of Nuneham) to enjoy his didactic and engaging teaching style. Meanwhile, he undertook a research degree on [...] "the place of history in education" [...] for Exeter College, Oxford. He also turned <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> world of publishing, for a time being general editor of the Historical Division of Pergamon Press.|$|E
2500|$|Reading {{the words}} of [...] "And the Lord was with Joseph, {{and he was a}} prosperous man; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian," [...] the Zohar taught that {{wherever}} the righteous walk, God protects them and never abandons them. The Zohar taught that Joseph walked through [...] "the valley of the shadow of death" [...] (in {{the words of}} [...] ), having been brought down to Egypt, but the Shechinah was with him, as [...] states, [...] "And the Lord was with Joseph." [...] Because of the Shechinah's presence, all that Joseph did prospered in his hand. If he had something in his hand and his master wanted something else, it changed in <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> thing that his master wanted. Hence, [...] says, [...] "made to prosper in his hand," [...] as God was with him. Noting that [...] does not say, [...] "And his master knew," [...] but [...] "And his master saw," [...] the Zohar deduced that Potiphar saw every day with his eyes the miracles that God performed by the hand of Joseph. [...] reports, [...] "the Lord blessed the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake," [...] and the Zohar taught that God guards the righteous, and for their sakes also guards the wicked with whom they are associated, so that the wicked receive blessings through the righteous. The Zohar told that Joseph was thrown into the dungeon, in the words of [...] "His feet they hurt with fetters, his person was laid in iron." [...] And then God liberated him and made him ruler over Egypt, fulfilling the words of [...] which reports that God [...] "forsakes not his saints; they are preserved forever." [...] Thus the Zohar taught that God shields the righteous in this world and in the world to come.|$|E
