When testing the strong version on export performances of manufacturing sectors, the overall effect of environmental policies does not conflict with export competitiveness. When testing the weak version using export flows of environmental goods, environmental policies, as well as innovation activities, all foster competitive advantages of green exports.

Strong and narrowly strong versions of the Porter hypothesis are tested on the export dynamics of five aggregated manufacturing sectors, classified by their technological content, by means of a dynamic estimator applied to a theoretically-based gravity model. When testing the strong version, the overall effect of environmental policies does not seem to be harmful for export competitiveness of the manufacturing sector, whereas specific energy tax policies and innovation efforts positively influence export flows dynamics, revealing a Porter-like mechanism.

AimsThis study aims to examine differences among sites and log positions in post-felling log traits and green veneer recovery traits and {{determine the extent to which}} log traits explain variation in recovery traits. MethodsLog traits and green rotary-peeled veneer recovery traits from six temperate eucalypt plantations were studied. Selected plantations encompassed different age, site productivity, silvicultural and species classes in south-eastern Australia. Differences in log and recovery traits among sites and between lower and upper logs were examined, as was the extent to which log traits explained variation in recovery traits. ResultsDifferences among sites for percentage recovered green veneer were non-significant, despite significant differences for peelable billet volume, roundup loss, residual core diameter and all post-felling log traits: small end diameter, sweep, taper, out-of-roundness, end splitting and dynamic modulus of elasticity (MOEdyn).

This study aimed to apply a sustainable recovery extraction to obtain bioactive extracts from the medicinal plants P. major and P. lanceolata. Different extraction methods were compared in terms of yield process, total phenolic content (TPC) and antioxidant and antibacterial activities. The methods used were: supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) with CO pure and with ethanol as co-solvent, conducted at temperatures from 40 to 60 °C and pressures from 10 to 30 MPa, and by Soxhlet (SOX) and ultrasound-assisted extraction (UE) with different solvents. High extraction yields were obtained by SOX with methanol (P. major) and by UE with EtOH-HO (P. lanceolata). The moderate-polar and polar solvents presented the best TPC values and antioxidant performance, included the supercritical extraction of P. major with 5. 0 % of ethanol as co-solvent (EC 276 ± 1). SC-CO extract presented the best antibacterial activity, being more effective against the Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus cereus).

40|$|The {{recovery}} of organometallic catalysts from polymer matrices {{is of great}} importance in promoting the application of homogeneous catalysts in industry. Such a <b>green</b> <b>recovery</b> technique will not only popularize the techniques of green catalytic hydrogenation of polymers by Rempel’s group, but also consummates the technique of heterogenization of organometallic catalysts. The high value product of {{hydrogenated nitrile butadiene rubber}} (HNBR) with dissolution of Wilkinson’s catalyst [RhCl(TPP) 3] was selected as the model polymer matrix for developing a green separation technique. The supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO 2) soluble fluorous Wilkinson’s catalyst [RhCl(P(p-CF 3 C 6 H 4) 3) 3] was synthesized and shown exhibit a very limited activity in the catalytic hydrogenation of bulk HNBR. Its recovery from a HNBR matrix using scCO 2 however failed. In spite of the assistance of the scCO 2 dissolvable chelating ligand thenoyltrifluoroacetone (TTA), the weak compatibility of scCO 2 with rhodium complexes failed again as an extraction solvent for the HNBR matrix. Inspired by the merits of CO 2 -expanded liquids (CXLs) and the versatility of CO 2 in changing the physical properties of polymer melts, CXLs were tested as extracting solvents for separation of Wilkinson’s catalyst from bulk HNBR. CO 2 -expanded water (CXW) and CO 2 -expanded alcohols including methanol and ethanol (CXM and CXE) were examined with the assistance of a variety of chelating agents. The investigated chelating agents include ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disodium salt (EDTA-Na 2), diethylenetriamine (DETA), N,N,N',N',N"-pentamethyldiethylenetriamine (PMDETA), and N,N,N’,N’-tetramethylethylenediamine (TMEDA). CXM and PMDETA were recognized as the optimal combination of extracting solvent and chelating agent for {{recovery of}} Wilkinson’s catalyst from HNBR. An extraction system consisting of CXM and PMDETA was carefully investigated with respect to the effects of temperature and pressure on the extraction performance over the temperature range of 40 to 100 °C and the pressure range of 20 to 200 bar. Increasing temperature effectively increased the extraction rate and became less influential when the temperature was above 80 °C. Increasing pressure at a fixed temperature was found to improve the extraction rate followed by suppressing it. Nevertheless, further increasing the pressure to an extreme high value above the respective critical point was able to promote the extraction rate again. The complex effects of pressure were thoroughly investigated by the means of analyzing the dissolution behavior of CO 2 in HNBR and the variation of the extraction phase composition at different operational conditions. 0. 14 g/mL was determined as the CO 2 density by which the optimal pressure at a fixed temperature can be estimated. Based on a careful interpretation of the experimental results, an extraction mechanism was illustrated for interpreting the present extraction system. Additionally, the reactions involved in the extraction process were illustrated to reveal the principal challenges present in the extraction process and pointed out the potential solution for eliminating the obstacles. Two special operations-sequential operation and pressure varying procedure were tested for their effectiveness in enhancing the extraction ratio. A pressure varying procedure was found to be beneficial in further improving the extraction ratio, while sequential operation did not show any promise in enhancing the recovery. At last, the developed technique was shown to be highly efficient in applying it to HNBR particles coagulated from the HNBR latex. A residue of 59 ppm rhodium was obtained after 9 hours of operation.

Aims - This study aimed {{to determine the}} potential for genetic improvement of traits affecting <b>green</b> sawn-board <b>recovery</b> in plantation grown E. nitens. 	Methods - The study was undertaken on an E. nitens progeny trial. All trees were measured for DBH and stem straightness and 560 trees were selected for timber processing. Assessment was made of survival, log and green sawn-board volume, log-taper and both upper and lower log end-splitting. Genetic variation in and between these traits was estimated. Results - Genetic differences among races were significant for DBH at years nine and fourteen, stem straightness, log-taper and green sawn-board volume. Within-race, narrow-sense heritabilities were significant for DBH, stem straightness, log volume and both upper and lower log end-splitting. Positive and significant additive genetic correlations were observed between DBH at all ages and survival, stem straightness and log volume. Significant adverse genetic correlations were shown between upper log end-splitting and DBH at years nine and fourteen. Conclusion - These findings showed that harvest-age stem straightness and log volume objective traits in E. nitens are amenable to genetic improvement and that selection for early-age DBH in breeding programs should improve harvest-age survival, stem diameter and straightness, as well as log and green sawn-board volume.

30|$|The {{simulation}} of core flood {{was used in}} this study to understand, optimize, interpret, and design the <b>green</b> enhanced oil <b>recovery</b> (GEOR) flooding process. GEOR is a chemical EOR involving the injection of specific green chemicals (surfactants/alcohols/polymers) that effectively displace oil because of their phase-behavior properties, which decrease the IFT between the displacing liquid and the oil. In this process, the primary displacing liquid slug is a complex chemical system called a micellar solution, containing green surfactants, co-surfactants, oil, electrolytes, and water. The surfactant slug is relatively small, typically 10 % PV (Green and Willhite 1998). It may be followed by a mobility buffer, a solution that contains polymer at a concentration of a few 100  mg/l. This polymer solution is often graded in concentration, with the polymer becoming more dilute as more of the solution is injected. The total volume of the polymer solution is typically about 1 PV (Green and Willhite 1998).|$|R
40|$|Many higher {{plants are}} polysomatic whereby {{different}} cells possess variable amounts of nuclear DNA. The conditional triggering of endocycles results in higher nuclear DNA content (C value) {{that in some}} cases has been correlated to increased cell size. While numerous multicolored fluorescent protein (FP) probes have revealed the general behavior of the nucleus and intranuclear components, direct visualization and estimation of changes in nuclear-DNA content in live cells during their development has not been possible. Recently, monomeric Eos fluorescent protein (mEosFP) has emerged as a useful photoconvertible protein whose color changes irreversibly from a green to a red fluorescent form upon exposure to violet-blue light. The stability and irreversibility of red fluorescent mEosFP suggests that detection of <b>green</b> color <b>recovery</b> would be possible as fresh mEosFP is produced after photoconversion. Thus a ratiometric evaluation of the red and green forms of mEosFP following photoconversion could be used to estimate production of a core histone such as H 2 B during its concomitant synthesis with DNA in the synthesis phase of the cell cycle. Here we present proof of concept observations on transgenic tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) Bright Yellow 2 cells and Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) plants stably expressing H 2 B::mEosFP. In Arabidopsis seedlings an increase in green fluorescence is observed specifically in cells known to undergo endoreduplication. The detection of changes in nuclear DNA content by correlating color recovery of H 2 B::mEosFP after photoconversion is a novel approach involving a single FP. The method has potential for facilitating detailed investigations on conditions that favor increased cell size and the development of polysomaty in plants...|$|R
