5|$|Thus the zwitterion, , is {{amphoteric}} {{because it}} may either be protonated or <b>deprotonated.</b>|$|E
5|$|Some copper {{proteins}} form oxo complexes, {{which also}} feature copper(III). With tetrapeptides, purple-colored copper(III) complexes are stabilized by the <b>deprotonated</b> amide ligands.|$|E
5|$|Alcohols do not {{normally}} behave as acids in water, but {{the presence of}} a double bond adjacent to the OH group can substantially decrease the pKa by the mechanism of keto–enol tautomerism. Ascorbic acid is an example of this effect. The diketone 2,4-pentanedione (acetylacetone) is also a weak acid because of the keto–enol equilibrium. In aromatic compounds, such as phenol, which have an OH substituent, conjugation with the aromatic ring as a whole greatly increases the stability of the <b>deprotonated</b> form.|$|E
50|$|On {{the other}} hand, with baking powders that contain sodium acid pyrophosphate, excess {{alkaline}} substances can sometimes <b>deprotonate</b> the acid in two steps {{instead of the}} one that normally occurs, resulting in an offensive bitter taste to baked goods. Calcium compounds and aluminium compounds do not have that problem though, since calcium compounds that <b>deprotonate</b> twice are insoluble and aluminium compounds do not <b>deprotonate</b> in that fashion.|$|R

50|$|Strong bases <b>deprotonate</b> bilfluoride. For example, calcium {{hydroxide}} gives calcium fluoride.|$|R
5|$|The base is most {{commonly}} histidine since its pKa allows for effective base catalysis, hydrogen bonding to the acid residue, and deprotonation of the nucleophile residue. β-lactamases such as TEM-1 use a lysine residue as the base. Because lysine's pKa {{is so high}} (pKa=11), a glutamate and several other residues act as the acid to stabilise its <b>deprotonated</b> state during the catalytic cycle. Threonine proteases use their N-terminal amide as the base, since steric crowding by the catalytic threonine's methyl prevents other residues from being close enough.|$|E
5|$|The {{second most}} studied triad is the Cysteine-Histidine-Aspartate motif. Several {{families}} of cysteine proteases use this triad set, for example TEV protease and papain. The triad acts similarly to serine protease triads, {{with a few}} notable differences. Due to cysteine's low pKa, {{the importance of the}} Asp to catalysis varies and several cysteine proteases are effectively Cys-His dyads (e.g. hepatitis A virus protease), whilst in others the cysteine is already <b>deprotonated</b> before catalysis begins (e.g. papain). This triad is also used by some amidases, such as N-glycanase to hydrolyse non-peptide C-N bonds.|$|E
25|$|These salts can be <b>deprotonated</b> in {{the usual}} way to give Ph3P=CH−CH2R.|$|E
50|$|In the {{earliest}} {{work in this}} area, Grignard reagents were used to <b>deprotonate</b> the cyclopentadiene.|$|R
50|$|The {{substrate}} is coordinated to the zinc {{and this}} enzyme has two zinc atoms per subunit. One is the active site, which {{is involved in}} catalysis. In the active site, the ligands are Cys-46, Cys-174, His-67, and one water molecule. The other subunit is involved with structure. In this mechanism, the hydride from the alcohol goes to NAD+. Crystal structures indicate that the His-51 <b>deprotonates</b> the nicotinamide ribose, which <b>deprotonates</b> Ser-48. Finally, Ser-48 <b>deprotonates</b> the alcohol, making it an aldehyde. From a mechanistic perspective, if the enzyme adds hydride to the re face of NAD+, the resulting hydrogen is incorporated into the pro-R position. Enzymes that add hydride to the re face are deemed Class A dehydrogenases.|$|R
5000|$|Glucose 6-phosphate binds to GPI in its {{pyranose}} form. The ring {{is opened}} in a [...] "push-pull" [...] mechanism by His388, which protonates the C5 oxygen, and Lys518, which <b>deprotonates</b> the C1 hydroxyl group. This creates an open chain aldose. Then, the substrate is rotated about the C3-C4 bond to position it for isomerization. At this point, Glu357 <b>deprotonates</b> C2 {{to create a}} cis-enediolate intermediate stabilized by Arg272. To complete the isomerization, Glu357 donates its proton to C1, the C2 hydroxyl group loses its proton and the open-chain ketose fructose 6-phosphate is formed. Finally, the ring is closed by rotating the substrate about the C3-C4 bond again and <b>deprotonating</b> the C5 hydroxyl with Lys518.|$|R
25|$|Step 6: The Lithium salt of the doubly <b>deprotonated</b> {{formic acid}} is isolated.|$|E
25|$|The trisubstituted enolate is {{considered}} the kinetic enolate, while the tetrasubstituted enolate {{is considered}} the thermodynamic enolate. The alpha hydrogen <b>deprotonated</b> to form the kinetic enolate is less hindered, and therefore <b>deprotonated</b> more quickly. In general, tetrasubstituted olefins are more stable than trisubstituted olefins due to hyperconjugative stabilization. The ratio of enolate regioisomers is heavily influenced by the choice of base. For the above example, kinetic control may be established with LDA at −78°C, giving 99:1 selectivity of kinetic: thermodynamic enolate, while thermodynamic control may be established with triphenylmethyllithium at room temperature, giving 10:90 selectivity.|$|E
25|$|Step 7: The Lithium salt of the doubly <b>deprotonated</b> {{formic acid}} is {{subjected}} to Collision Induced Dissociation. This results {{in the formation of}} the Lithium monoxide anion (LiO−) and a Carbon dioxide molecule.|$|E

25|$|Like other hydrocarbons, methane is a {{very weak}} acid. Its pKa in DMSO is {{estimated}} to be 56. It cannot be <b>deprotonated</b> in solution, but the conjugate base with methyllithium is known.|$|E
25|$|Step 5: After being {{subjected}} to Collision Induced Dissociation, the Lithium oxalate anion loses a Carbon dioxide molecule. The products of the reaction are: Lithium salt of doubly <b>deprotonated</b> formic acid (LiCO2-) and Carbon dioxide molecule.|$|E
25|$|Curcumin {{incorporates}} several functional groups whose {{structure was}} first identified in 1910. The aromatic ring systems, which are phenols, are connected by two α,β-unsaturated carbonyl groups. The diketones form stable enols and are readily <b>deprotonated</b> to form enolates; the α,β-unsaturated carbonyl {{group is a}} good Michael acceptor and undergoes nucleophilic addition.|$|E
5|$|However, further work {{showed that}} diaminocarbenes will <b>deprotonate</b> the DMSO solvent, with the {{resulting}} anion reacting with the resulting amidinium salt.|$|R
50|$|The {{strong base}} <b>deprotonates</b> the vinylic hydrogen, which after alpha-elimination forms a vinyl carbene. A 1,2-aryl {{migration}} forms the 1,2-diaryl-alkyne product.|$|R

25|$|Transferrin can {{instead be}} removed by size {{exclusion}} chromatography. This method {{is one of}} the more reliable chromatography techniques. Since we are dealing with proteins, properties such as charge and affinity are not consistent and vary with pH as molecules are protonated and <b>deprotonated,</b> while size stays relatively constant. Nonetheless, it has drawbacks such as low resolution, low capacity and low elution times.|$|E
25|$|Fluorescein has a pKa of 6.4, and its {{ionization}} equilibrium {{leads to}} pH-dependent absorption and emission {{over the range}} of 5 to 9. Also, the fluorescence lifetimes of the protonated and <b>deprotonated</b> forms of fluorescein are approximately 3 and 4ns, which allows for pH determination from nonintensity based measurements. The lifetimes can be recovered using time-correlated single photon counting or phase-modulation fluorimetry.|$|E
25|$|Because of its {{polarity}} {{and thermal}} stability, MSM is used industrially as a high-temperature solvent for both inorganic and organic substances. It {{is used as}} a medium in organic synthesis. For example, displacement of aryl chlorides by potassium fluoride can be usefully conducted in molten MSM. With a pKa of 31, it can be <b>deprotonated</b> with sodium amide, and the conjugate base is an effective nucleophile.|$|E
25|$|The {{first step}} of the {{synthesis}} involves treatment of bisphenol A with sodium hydroxide, which <b>deprotonates</b> the hydroxyl groups of the bisphenol A.|$|R
50|$|NaHMDS is {{also used}} as a base to <b>deprotonate</b> other {{compounds}} containing weakly acidic O-H, S-H, and N-H bonds. These include cyanohydrins and thiols.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the most}} useful {{chemical}} properties of n-BuLi {{is its ability to}} <b>deprotonate</b> a wide range of weak Brønsted acids. t-Butyllithium and s-butyllithium are more basic. n-BuLi can <b>deprotonate</b> (that is, metalate) many types of C-H bonds, especially where the conjugate base is stabilized by electron delocalization or one or more heteroatoms (non carbon atoms). Examples include acetylenes (H-CC-R), methyl sulfides (H-CH2SR), thioacetals (H-CH(SR)2, e.g. dithiane), methylphosphines (H-CH2PR2), furans, thiophenes and ferrocene (Fe(H-C5H4)(C5H5)). In addition to these, it will also <b>deprotonate</b> all more acidic compounds such as alcohols, amines, enolizable carbonyl compounds, and any overtly acidic compounds, to produce alkoxides, amides, enolates and other -ates of lithium, respectively. The stability and volatility of the butane resulting from such deprotonation reactions is convenient, but can also be a problem for large-scale reactions because of the volume of a flammable gas produced.|$|R
25|$|Methionine (abbreviated as Met or M; encoded by the codon AUG) is an α-amino acid {{that is used}} in the {{biosynthesis}} of proteins. It {{contains an}} α-amino group (which is in the protonated −NH3+ form under biological conditions), an α-carboxylic acid group (which is in the <b>deprotonated</b> −COO− form under biological conditions), and an S-methyl thioether side chain, classifying it as a non-polar, aliphatic amino acid.|$|E
25|$|Salts and esters of {{carboxylic}} acids {{are called}} carboxylates. When a carboxyl group is <b>deprotonated,</b> its conjugate base forms a carboxylate anion. Carboxylate ions are resonance-stabilized, and this increased stability makes carboxylic acids more acidic than alcohols. Carboxylic acids {{can be seen}} as reduced or alkylated forms of the Lewis acid carbon dioxide; under some circumstances they can be decarboxylated to yield carbon dioxide.|$|E
25|$|The {{most likely}} {{explanation}} is then that G12, in the <b>deprotonated</b> form, {{is the general}} base, and the ribose of G8 is the general acid. The apparent kinetic pKa of the hammerhead ribozyme is 8.5, whereas the pKa of guanosine is about 9.5. It {{is possible that the}} pKa of G12 is perturbed from 9.5 to 8.5 in the hammerhead catalytic core; this hypothesis is currently the subject of intense investigation.|$|E
50|$|The {{catalytic}} {{mechanism of}} catechol 1,2-dioxygenase was elucidated {{using a combination}} of O18 labeling experiments and crystallography. Upon entering the active site, the hydroxyl group on the fourth carbon (C4) of catechol binds to Fe3+; this binding is facilitated by the hydroxide ligand, which <b>deprotonates</b> the C4 hydroxyl group. The second catechol hydroxyl group on carbon 3 (C3) is coordinated to Fe3+ after its deprotonation by the Tyr200 ligand. In the process of <b>deprotonating</b> the C3 hydroxyl group, Tyr200 dissociates from the catalytic complex.|$|R
5000|$|First, the lone-pair on the {{nitrogen}} of the imine <b>deprotonates</b> the phenol, pushing the bonding electrons onto the oxygen. The carbonyl is then reformed and a double bond in the benzene ring attacks the carbon atom in the pronated imine cation. Water then {{acts as a}} base and <b>deprotonates</b> the α-carbon, reforming the aromatic ring and pushing electrons onto oxygen. The oxygen, which now has a negative formal charge, then attacks a hydrogen on the hydronium, resulting in an α-aminobenzylphenol, with water as the only byproduct.|$|R
