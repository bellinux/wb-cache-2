50|$|Pierre Lévy {{is one of}} the {{few major}} {{philosophers}} working on the implications of cyberspace and <b>digital</b> communications. <b>Lévy</b> has written a dozen of books that have been translated in more than 12 languages and are studied in many universities all over the world. His principal work, published in French in 1994 and translated into English, is entitled Collective Intelligence: Mankind's Emerging World in Cyberspace.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} fast and {{accurate}} FFT-based method of computing the prices and sensitivities of barrier options and first-touch digital options on stocks whose log-price follows a Lévy process. The numerical results obtained via our approach are demonstrated {{to be in}} good agreement with the results obtained using other (sometimes fundamentally different) approaches that exist in the literature. However, our method is computationally much faster (often, dozens of times faster). Moreover, our technique has the advantage that its application does not entail a detailed analysis of the underlying Lévy process: one only needs an explicit analytic formula for the characteristic exponent of the process. Thus our algorithm is very easy to implement in practice. Finally, our method yields accurate results {{for a wide range of}} values of the spot price, including those that are very close to the barrier, regardless of whether the maturity period of the option is long or short.

50|$|In Becoming Virtual: Reality in the <b>Digital</b> Age <b>Lévy</b> {{explores the}} way we virtualise {{every aspect of our}} lives, from real time (media) {{interaction}} through language, to our actions through technology, and our social relations through institutions. And in each case the mechanism is the same: we create some artifact, more or less material, which allows us to shift what's at stake away from the immediate here-and-now and towards a problematic where new possibilities open up.|$|R

Page ten, which refers to “Levy and Flogging,” mentions changes in the rules for recruiting and training sailors and quotes a Secretary of the Navy Dobbie as saying, “this humane act is the result largely of Commodore Levy’s efforts. ” Pages 61 - 65 include a thorough breakdown of Levy’s will with names of the inheritors. This section also mentions that he received “The Freedom of the City of New York. ” Also included is a list of donations to various societies, gravesite directions, the inscription on Levy’s monument and its cost, etc. On page 73 appears a list of traits attributed to <b>Levy.</b> <b>Digital</b> ImageDigital finding aid available...|$|R
40|$|We {{calculate}} the leading term of asymptotics of {{the prices of}} barrier options and first-touch digitals near the barrier for wide classes of Lévy processes with exponential jump densities, including the Variance Gamma model, the KoBoL (a. k. a. CGMY) model and Normal Inverse Gaussian processes. In the case of processes of infinite activity and finite variation, with the drift pointing from the barrier, we prove that the price is discontinuous at the boundary. This observation can {{serve as the basis}} for a simple robust test of the type of processes observed in real financial markets. In many cases, we {{calculate the}} second term of asymptotics as well. By comparing the exact asymptotic results for prices with those of Carr's randomization approximation, we conclude that the latter is very accurate near the barrier. We illustrate this by including numerical results for several types of Lévy processes commonly used in option pricing.

40|$|A {{study is}} done on the {{protection}} of sound recordings in the decentralized peer-to-peer (DP 2 P) file sharing in the United States, the United Kingdom and South Africa. This study reveals that because sound recordings have unique features different from other copyright works, the illegal sharing of sound recordings can ordinarily be filtered, identified, and detected by the Internet service providers (ISPs) before granting access to users and without infringing the users‟ right to privacy. However, the ISPs have failed in this regard, hence, they are strictly held liable under the contributory, vicarious and inducing infringements notwithstanding the statutory law which prohibits ISPs from monitoring, and intercepting their networks. In fact and law, the terms filtering, identifying and detecting {{on the one hand}} and monitoring and intercepting on the other hand are different in relation to sound recordings and as such ISPs are not prohibited from filtering, identifying and detecting illegal sound recordings on their networks, thus, ISPs are not protected under the limitation law as it is generally believed. However, several recommendations are made for reform, inter alia: a review of the limitation law to include the terms filtering, identifying and detecting in pursuance of the terms monitoring, and intercepting, if the intention of the legislators was meant to include the latter terms; protection of access right in digital sound recordings, protection of the neighbouring rights of ISPs in the <b>digital</b> world, imposing <b>levies</b> on all recording equipment, the insurability of sound recordings and ISPs‟ signals, and bandwidth.
