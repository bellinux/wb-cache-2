Litoral Gas demanded Beltramone's recusal for expressing an opinion about the case to the press. The appeal court agreed in a 2–1 vote to remove Beltramone, and the case was transferred to Patricia Bilotta. García had claimed that he was following instructions received <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> explosion, so Bilotta summoned the technical officers of Litoral Gas to clarify that point. Litoral Gas said that García had not received any instructions prior to the explosion.|$|E
5|$|Governor David Paterson's {{selection}} process {{began with a}} number of prominent names and high-ranking New York Democrats, including Andrew Cuomo, Fran Drescher and Caroline Kennedy, vying for the spot. Gillibrand quietly campaigned for the position, meeting secretly with Paterson on at least one occasion. She said that she made an effort to underscore her successful House elections in a largely conservative district, adding that she could be a good complement to Chuck Schumer. Gillibrand was presumed a likely choice <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> official announcement. On January 23, 2009, Paterson held a press conference to announce Gillibrand as his choice.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> {{beginning}} of the race, there was controversy over the first stage.

As a result, the race organisers decided to neutralise the stage: the teams therefore competed only for the stage victory and for the team classification, not for the general classification.|$|E

The source of conflict at the junction was the nearby Netzarim settlement, where 60 Israeli families lived until Israel's withdrawal from Gaza in 2005. A military escort accompanied the settlers whenever they left or arrived at the settlement, and an Israeli military outpost, Magen-3, guarded the approach. The area had been the scene of violent incidents <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> shooting.|$|E

Despite having almost no experience starting at quarterback before the season, Skinner was named the ACC's rookie of the year. Skinner led the ACC in completion percentage, passing efficiency, and interception rate. In addition, Skinner set 10 new single-season passing records at Wake Forest during the 2006 season. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> ACC Championship Game, Skinner {{was named to the}} second-team All-ACC team, joining eight other teammates selected to one of the two All-ACC teams.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> {{start of}} the special session, {{it became clear that}} a major battle was brewing between the {{moderate}} segregationists and the extreme segregationists. Delegates from Northern Virginia openly opposed the Stanley plan as well as calls for even more radical legislation. Although most moderate segregationists had joined with the extremists in initially supporting the Gray Commission plan and the call for a constitutional convention, the moderates largely did not support interposition. The moderate segregationists also joined with many (such as leading educators, urban leaders from Northern Virginia, former state superintendent of public schools Dabney Lancaster, several General Assembly delegates, and Gray Commission vice chairman Harry B. Davis) who felt that the tuition voucher proposal would undermine public education.|$|E
5|$|On the day decreed, Le Gris and Carrouges {{travelled}} through Paris to the Abbey of Saint-Martin-des-Champs in the city's Northern suburbs. The abbey's field {{had been}} converted from a jousting ground to a wooden arena especially for the combat, surrounded by banks for the spectators and a royal box. Attending the duel {{was not only the}} King and his uncles John, Duke of Berry, Philip the Bold and Louis II, Duke of Bourbon and his brother the Duke of Orléans, but thousands of ordinary Parisians, Normans and visiting French. Thousands of people had flooded into the city <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> combat to see the spectacle but all had been warned not to physically aid the combatants on pain of death, nor call out during the fight on pain of losing a hand.|$|E

5|$|The Danger Tree {{had been}} part of a clump of trees located about halfway into No Man's Land and had {{originally}} been used as a landmark by a Newfoundland Regiment trench raiding party <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> Battle of the Somme. British and German artillery bombardments eventually stripped the tree of leaves and left nothing more than a shattered tree trunk. During the Newfoundland Regiment's infantry assault, the tree was once again used as a landmark, where the troops were ordered to gather. The tree was however a highly visible landmark for the German artillery and the site proved to be a location where the German shrapnel was particularly deadly. As a result, the regiment suffered a large concentration of casualties around the tree. A replica representation of the twisted tree now stands at the spot.|$|E
5|$|Though the {{expedition}} ended in failure {{the members of}} the Uitvoerend Bewind became very nervous <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> Battle of Bergen. The Agent for Foreign Affairs, Van der Goes who had been in favor of distancing the Republic from the French, chose this inopportune moment to secretly approach the King of Prussia as a mediator, with a scheme in which the Hereditary Prince was to become a kind of constitutional monarch in a constitution on the model of the American Constitution. The Republic would revert to its traditional neutrality, while Britain would occupy North Holland, and France Zeeland. The overture was rejected, and it caused a lot of embarrassment in the relations with the French Directoire. At this time Napoleon Bonaparte performed his coup of 18 Brumaire, establishing the French Consulate. The Franco-Batavian relations now entered a whole new era.|$|E
5|$|While the Chinese {{were making}} a {{concentrated}} attack against the South Korean front, the North Korean forces that had infiltrated the UN rear were cutting the South Korean withdrawal route. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> Chinese Third Phase Campaign, the KPA II Corps established a major roadblock {{to the north of}} Hoengsong with an estimated strength of 10,000 soldiers, which blocked the retreat of the ROK III Corps. In response, the ROK II Corps and the US 2nd Infantry Division conducted a siege operation against the roadblock from both the north and the south, and the roadblock was forced open by January 2. Although the UN forces managed to eliminate a North Korean division at the roadblock, the ROK II Corps was nearly destroyed during the fighting, and it was disbanded on January 10.|$|E

5|$|Both {{candidates}} {{believed that}} the states of New York, New Jersey, Indiana, and Connecticut would determine the election. In New York, Blaine received less support than he anticipated when Arthur and Conkling, still powerful in the New York Republican party, failed to actively campaign for him. Blaine hoped {{that he would have}} more support from Irish Americans than Republicans typically did; while the Irish were mainly a Democratic constituency in the 19th century, Blaine’s mother was Irish Catholic, and he believed his career-long opposition to the British government would resonate with the Irish. Blaine’s hope for Irish defections to the Republican standard were dashed late in the campaign when one of his supporters, Samuel D. Burchard, gave a speech denouncing the Democrats as the party of “Rum, Romanism, and Rebellion.” The Democrats spread the word of this insult <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> election, and Cleveland narrowly won all four of the swing states, including New York by just over one thousand votes. While the popular vote total was close, with Cleveland winning by just one-quarter of a percent, the electoral votes gave Cleveland a majority of 219–182.|$|E
5|$|Competing at {{her first}} Summer Olympic Games, Pramila Rijal {{was the oldest}} person to compete for Nepal at the London Olympic Games {{at the age of}} 27. She {{attained}} qualification to the Games {{with the use of a}} wildcard because she had not set any previous time for her event, the 100 metres. Rijal revealed that she had problems with the starting block but hoped the training in Kent would aid her in setting a new Nepalese national record. She took part in the event's fourth heat on 3 August, finishing sixth out of nine competitors, with a time of 13.33 seconds. The result was attributed to Rajal having back pain <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> event and required painkillers to help her cope. She finished in front of Janice Alatoa of Vanuatu (13.60 seconds) and Mihter Wendolin from Micronesia (13.67 seconds) but behind Lidiane Lopes of Cape Verde (12.72 seconds) in a heat led by Papua New Guinea's Toea Wisil (11.60 seconds). Rajal finished 71st out of 78 runners overall, and was 1.11 seconds slower than the slowest competitor who advanced to the first round and did not make the later rounds.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> battle, Philippicus, newly {{assigned}} to the Persian front, moved to intercept an anticipated Persian invasion. He chose to deploy his army at Solachon, controlling the various routes of the Mesopotamian plain, and especially access to the main local watering source, the Arzamon river. Kardarigan, confident of victory, advanced against the Byzantines, but they had been warned and were deployed in battle order when Kardarigan reached Solachon. The Persians deployed as well and attacked, gaining {{the upper hand in}} the centre, but the Byzantine right wing broke through the Persian left flank. The successful Byzantine wing was thrown into disarray as its men headed off to loot the Persian camp, but Philippicus was able to restore order. Then, while the Byzantine centre was forced to form a shield wall to withstand the Persian pressure, the Byzantine left flank also managed to turn the Persians' right. Under threat of a double envelopment, the Persian army collapsed and fled, with many dying in the desert of thirst or from water poisoning. Kardarigan himself survived and, with a part of his army, held out against Byzantine attacks on a hillock for several days before the Byzantines withdrew.|$|E
