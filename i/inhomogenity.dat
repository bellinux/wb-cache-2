Furthermore, in special cases the microstructure of the superconducting material, which is connected by Josephson junctions, can be determined.

40|$|Context: Isolated, cooling {{neutron stars}} with thermal X-ray {{emission}} remain rarely-detected objects despite many searches investigating the ROSAT data. Aims: We simulate {{the population of}} close-by young cooling neutron stars to explain the current observational results. Given the <b>inhomogenity</b> of the neutron star distribution on the sky, it is particularly interesting to identify promising sky regions with respect to ongoing and future searches. Methods: Applying a population synthesis model, the <b>inhomogenity</b> of the progenitor distribution and the <b>inhomogenity</b> of the X-ray absorbing interstellar medium are considered for the first time. The total number of observable neutron stars is derived with respect to ROSAT count rates. In addition, we present sky maps of neutron star locations, and discuss age and distance distributions of the simulated neutron stars. Implications for future searches are discussed. Results: With our advanced model, we can succesfully explain the observed log N-log S distribution of close-by neutron stars. Cooling neutron stars will be most abundant in the directions of rich OB associations. We expect new candidates to be identified behind the Gould Belt, in particular in the Cygnus-Cepheus region. We {{expect them to be}} on average younger and hotter than the known population of isolated, cooling neutron stars.

40|$|Abstract: In this study, {{the effect}} of polar face on Schottky barrier diodes has been investigated. Two samples of ZnO were grown {{hydrothermally}} under similar growth conditions. The Palladium (Pd) metal contacts of area 0. 78 mm 2 were fabricated on both faces and were studied comprehensively using DLS- 83 Deep Level Spectrometer over temperature range of 160 K– 330 K. The current-voltage (I–V) measurements revealed that the ideality factor n and barrier height ϕB were strongly temperature dependent for both faces (Zn and O-face) of ZnO, indicating that the thermionic emission is not the dominant process, which showed the <b>inhomogenity</b> in the barrier heights of grown samples. This barrier height <b>inhomogenity</b> was explained by applying Gaussian distribution model. The extrapolation of the linear ϕap verses n plot to n = 1 has given a homogeneous barrier height of approximately 0. 88 ± 0. 01 eV and 0. 76 ± 0. 01 eV for Zn and O-faces respectively. ϕap versus 1 /T plot was drawn to obtain the values of mean barrier height for Zn and O-face (0. 88 ± 0. 01 eV, 0. 76 ± 0. 01 eV) and standard deviation(δs) (0. 015 ± 0. 001 V, 0. 014 ± 0. 001 V) at zero bais respectively.
