2500|$|The bulk of Barber's {{business}} {{followed the}} [...] "catalog architecture" [...] model popularized by earlier architects such as Palliser, Palliser & Company. [...] Barber's great innovation was {{his willingness to}} personalize his designs for individual clients at moderate cost. [...] As {{he wrote in his}} Cottage Souvenir No. 2, [...] "Write to us concerning any changes wanted in plans, and keep writing till you <b>get</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>want.</b> [...] Don't be afraid of writing too often. [...] We are not easily offended." [...] Though his firms' records no longer survive, it is believed that he sold as many as 20,000 plans in his career. [...] Since he frequently modified his designs to fit his clients' needs and specifications, his houses are sometimes difficult to attribute with any certainty.|$|E
2500|$|Culture {{is a set}} {{of values}} and {{practices}} that create meaning for society. [...] This includes both high culture (literature, art, and education, which appeals to elites) and popular culture (appeals to the masses). [...] This is what governments seek to show foreign audiences when engaging in cultural diplomacy. [...] It is a type of soft power, which is the [...] "ability to <b>get</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> through attraction rather than coercion or payments. [...] It arises from a country's culture, political ideals and policies." [...] This indicates that the value of culture is its ability to attract foreigners to a nation. [...] Cultural diplomacy is also a component of public diplomacy. [...] Public diplomacy is enhanced by a larger society and culture, but simultaneously public diplomacy helps to [...] "amplify and advertise that society and culture to the world at large". [...] It could be argued that the information component of public diplomacy can only be fully effective where there is already a relationship that gives credibility to the information being relayed. [...] This comes from knowledge of the other's culture." [...] Cultural diplomacy has been called the [...] "linchpin of public diplomacy" [...] because cultural activities have the possibility to demonstrate the best of a nation. [...] In this way, cultural diplomacy and public diplomacy are intimately linked.|$|E
