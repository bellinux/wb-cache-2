40|$|A new {{technique}} {{has been developed}} and demonstrated which allows the mass flow rate of gas exiting an initially pressurized plenum to be determined to reasonably high accuracy {{without the need for}} calibrated flow meters. The technique is applicable to discharge processes in which the mass flow rate is controlled by a sonic orifice. Once the plenum is calibrated-using a method that is described-the technique allows mass flow rate out of the plenum to be determined from a single pressure measurement and an initial temperature measurement without the need for a traditional <b>flow-metering</b> device. Accuracy is comparable to conventional tertiary measurement techniques. The technique has application {{to a wide range of}} facilities in which gas is supplied from a pressurized plenum, and in which installation of a conventional device is either impossible or prohibitively costly. The technique has been used to measure the mass flow rate in the Turbine Test Facility at QinetiQ, Farnborough. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|New static {{thermal mass}} {{principle}} {{is a very}} promising technology for gas <b>flow-metering</b> since it offers very significant potential such as digital output, absence of moving parts, direct mass measurement. Unfortunately, gas quality is expected to affect metrological performance of thermal mass flow-meters (TMFs), as far as flow disturbances and such conditions often occur in modern networks. In this paper the authors investigate the sensitivity of TMFs with natural gas quality changes and different flow disturbances. To this end, a metrological test campaign {{has been carried out}} through specifically designed laboratory test bench and facilities. The results of the tests with gas quality changes show the capillary TMFs are able to recognize the natural gas flowing strictly included in the EN 437 group H and to consequently apply specific correction factors. On the other hand, capillary TMFs have been found sensitive to high contents of CO 2 and N 2, like in biogas and natural gases at the borders of group H. Finally, flow disturbances tests show the accuracy of full bore insertion in line TMFs is affected by the interaction between sensor and piping both for double out-of plane bend and single 90 ° bend disturbances...|$|E

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation has}} confirmed the predicted flow pattern in a prototype virtual cyclone, a novel device for nonimpact particle separation proposed by Torcdzynski and Rader (1996, 1997) {{based solely on}} computational simulations. The virtual cyclone differs from an ordinary cyclone in that the flow is turned by a virtual wall composed of an eddy rather than by a solid wall. A small-scale version of the computationally simulated geometry has been fabricated out of Lucite. The working fluid is ambient air, which is drawn through the apparatus and <b>flow-metering</b> equipment using a wind-tunnel vacuum source. The flow is seeded with smoke or water droplets produced by a nebulizer so that flow visualization techniques and particle-imaging velocimetry could be applied. Experiments have been performed on this apparatus for flows with Reynolds numbers from 200 up to 40, 000 (a Mach number of 0. 3). Flow visualization using a laser light sheet passing through the mid-plane of the apparatus verified that the computationally predicted flow is obtained over {{the entire range of}} flow rates. The shear layer between the main and recirculating flow is observed to become turbulent around a Reynolds number of 4000. While not changing the flow structure, the turbulent mixing produced by shear-layer roll-up limits particle concentration at the higher flow rates. In order to achieve highly efficient particle separation using a virtual cyclone, turbulence must be suppressed or mitigated. If laminar flow cannot be achieved for macroscopic-scale virtual cyclones, it should be achievable for a small-scale (low Reynolds number) virtual cyclone fabricated using MEMS-related technologies. This approach could lead to a chip-scale particle concentrator...|$|E

40|$|Several {{technologies}} {{can be used}} in ultrasonic gas <b>flow-meters,</b> such as transit-time, Doppler, cross-correlation and etc. In applications, {{the approach}} based on measuring transit-time has demonstrated its advantages and become more popular. Among those techniques which can be applied to determine time-of-flight (TOF) of ultrasonic waves, including threshold detection, cross correlation algorithm and other digital signal processing algorithms, cross correlation algorithm has more advantages when the received ultrasonic signal is severely disturbed by the noise. However, the reference wave for cross correlation computation has great influence on the precise measurement of TOF. In the applications of the multipath <b>flow-meters,</b> selection of the reference wave becomes even more complicated. Based on the analysis of the impact factors that will introduce noise and waveform distortion of ultrasonic waves, an averaging method is proposed to determine the reference wave in this paper.

However, any delay differences arising from sources other than the flow to be measured will cause a troublesome "zero flow" offset error. In theory, the transducers used in the measurement system should not influence the zero flow error, as electroacoustic systems based on piezoelectric transducers {{have been shown to}} be reciprocal (when the media is stationary). However, care is required when designing the electrical interfaces for the piezoelectric transducers, if reciprocity in the system is to be utilized. This work presents technique and measurements that apply reciprocity to an ultrasonic transit-time <b>flow-meter.</b> Specialized electrical transducer interfaces with options to drive the transducers from either low or high impedance sources were used. Combined with a high-impedance receive mode these options made it possible to change the conditions for reciprocity in the system.

INTRODUC 1 ION A large variety of laboratory <b>flow-meters</b> designed to operate on different principles are described in literature. Although meters working on thermo-electric and electronic drop counting principles seem to be interesting, the Mariotte bottle type is found to be suitable for laboratory purposes. Zentner! employed an apparatus in which the liquid is siphoned from a Mariotte bottle and delivered through a capillary. An improved form of the above <b>flow-meter</b> has been described by Fabris and Peacock " in which, the liquid is used to measure the pressure differential across the capillary. Many difficulties, however, were encountered by us in testing the Mariotte bottle type, constructed in our laboratories. It was found that considerable time elapsed before the liquid attained definite differential height in the two limbs for a correct reading of a steady flow-rate to be taken. Further, it was difficult to set up the complicated all-glass construction in three dimensions on a wooden frame, and several parts were broken ar. d had to be frequently repaired, necessitating its recalibration every time. The final design of the <b>flow-meter</b> constructed by us was much simplified {{as a result of a}} numher of unsuccessful attempts to modify the older types.
