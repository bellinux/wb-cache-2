5|$|Clementine cake is {{prepared}} {{with the primary}} ingredients of clementine fruit, ground almonds or almond meal, flour, sugar, butter and eggs. Additional ingredients can be used, such as orange juice, orange muscat, milk, white <b>dessert</b> <b>wine,</b> or Riesling wine, orange oil or tangerine oil (or both), almond extract and vanilla extract.

5|$|Zinfandel vines {{are quite}} {{vigorous}} and grow best in climates that are warm {{but not too}} hot, because grapes may shrivel in hot weather. Zinfandel's thin-skinned grapes grow in large, tight bunches that are sometimes prone to bunch rot. The fruit ripen fairly early and produce juice with high sugar content. If weather conditions permit, the grapes may be late-harvested to make <b>dessert</b> <b>wine.</b> Zinfandel is often praised {{for its ability to}} reflect both its terroir and its winemaker's style and skill.|$|E

25|$|Most wine-producing {{countries}} have laws regulating the amount volatile acidity permitted for wine available {{for sale and}} consumption. In the United States, the legal limit is 0.9 g/l for foreign wine exported to the United States, 1.2 g/l for white table wine, 1.4 g/l for red wine, 1.5 g/l for white <b>dessert</b> <b>wine,</b> and 1.7 g/l for red <b>dessert</b> <b>wine.</b> European Union wine regulations limit VA to 1.08 g/l for white table wines and 1.20 g/l for red table wines.|$|E
25|$|Some {{producers}} {{also use}} additional propriate designations to denote quality or ripeness level within a Prädikat. These {{are out of}} the scope of the German wine law.

50|$|A {{general rule}} is that the wine should be sweeter than the food it is served with - a {{perfectly}} ripe peach {{has been described as}} the ideal partner for many <b>dessert</b> <b>wines,</b> whereas it makes sense not to drink wine at all with many chocolate- and toffee-based dishes. Red <b>dessert</b> <b>wines</b> like Recioto della Valpolicella and fortified wines like the vin doux naturel Muscats are the best matches for such difficult-to-pair desserts.Quite often, the wine itself can be a dessert, but bakery sweets can make a good match, particularly with a little bitterness like the almond biscuits that are dunked in Vin Santo. A development of this matching of contrasts is a rich savoury dish like the foie gras that is a traditional partner to Sauternes.White <b>dessert</b> <b>wines</b> are generally served somewhat chilled, but can be easily served too cold. Red <b>dessert</b> <b>wines</b> are served at room temperature or slightly chilled.|$|R

Two commercially available Botrytis lateral-flow devices (immunochromatographic devices) were tested and compared for their ability to detect and quantify levels of a highly stable Botrytis antigen in table <b>wines</b> and <b>dessert</b> <b>wines.</b> Table wines were diluted 1 : 40 and <b>dessert</b> <b>wines</b> 1 : 500 in phosphate buffered saline plus Tween 20 (0. 05 % v/v). Results from both types of devices were comparable and repeatability was good. This study shows that Botrytis lateral-flow devices could provide a useful tool for winemakers interested in relating levels of Botrytis antigens in table and <b>dessert</b> <b>wines</b> to sensory properties.

25|$|In Slovenian Istria the malvasia grape {{is grown}} in Koper area, {{especially}} on Debeli Rtič, Škocjan, Kortina and Labor. It is also grown in Italy and Croatia (see Italian and Croatian varieties). The vine {{was introduced to}} the area in the 14th century by Venetian merchants who brought cuttings from Greece. Over matured grapes give a <b>dessert</b> <b>wine</b> with non-fermented sugars and high alcohol level (around 12%) called sweet malvasia (Slovene and Croatian: sladka malvazija).|$|E
25|$|In viticulture, {{ripeness}} is {{the completion}} of the ripening process of wine grapes on the vine which signals the beginning of harvest. What exactly constitutes ripeness will vary depending on what style of wine is being produced (sparkling, still, fortified, rosé, <b>dessert</b> <b>wine,</b> etc.) and what the winemaker and viticulturist personally believe constitutes ripeness. Once the grapes are harvested, the physical and chemical components of the grape which will influence a wine's quality are essentially set so determining the optimal moment of ripeness may be considered the most crucial decision in winemaking.|$|E
25|$|A {{risk factor}} {{involved}} with fermentation {{is the development}} of chemical residue and spoilage which can be corrected with the addition of sulfur dioxide (SO2), although excess SO2 can lead to a wine fault. A winemaker who wishes to make a wine with high levels of residual sugar (like a <b>dessert</b> <b>wine)</b> may stop fermentation early either by dropping the temperature of the must to stun the yeast or by adding a high level of alcohol (like brandy) to the must to kill off the yeast and create a fortified wine.|$|E

25|$|White wine {{is also a}} <b>dessert</b> <b>wine.</b> All {{choices are}} allowed even if the sweet and {{fortified}} wines {{are more suitable for}} this. Perfumed wines (Gewurztraminer, Muscat), sparkling, and sweet wines accord well with fruit desserts (salad, tart). The fortified and sparkling wines support rich desserts made with cream or butter. Crèmes brûlées or caramel which combine sugar and cream can be eaten with a sweet and lively wine such as Jurançon or a late harvest wine. Chocolate requires a very powerful wine so white wine selection is quite limited: a natural amber sweet wine is the best compromise.|$|E
25|$|Nearly all {{the most}} notable sweet Muscats of Greece, {{particularly}} those from the island of Samos {{and the city of}} Patras on the Peloponnese are made from Muscat blanc à Petits Grains. In the history of South African wine, the famous <b>dessert</b> <b>wine</b> of Constantia was made from this variety of Muscat and while today Muscat of Alexandria is more widely planted in South Africa, producers around Constantia are trying to reclaim some of the region's viticultural acclaim by replanting more Muscat blanc à Petits Grains and making wines {{in the style of the}} original Constantia.|$|E
25|$|The method {{generally}} produces wines {{that are}} highly aromatic with low alcohol content, sometimes as low as 6%. The wines are sometimes somewhat obscure from remaining lees. They taste best 1–3 years after bottling and do not develop with further storage. In general, the wines are slightly sweet but brut (dry) varieties are also produced. The method's main weakness is that the production process is difficult to control and therefore requires great skill by the winemaker. The produced volumes are very modest. High-quality wines produced with the ancestral method, often by small growers using organic farming principles, can be complex and very distinctive. They are mainly used as aperitifs or <b>dessert</b> <b>wine</b> with fruit dishes.|$|E

25|$|Located to the {{northwest}} of the Collio Goriziano, the Colli Orientali del Friuli DOC shares similar vineyard soils and climate as the Collio region. The grape varieties are also similar though Ribolla Gialla and Picolit takes a more prominent role here as does the local grape Verduzzo. The three grapes are used to make varietal wines under the Colli Orientali del Friuli DOC. Picolit is known particularly {{for the quality of}} the <b>dessert</b> <b>wine</b> it produces and has 2 DOCG dedicated to its production in Udine. Red wine production is also more prominent in this region though it is still less than half the production of white wine. The red wines include varietal forms of Merlot, Cabernet franc and Cabernet Sauvignon as well as red wines made from the local Pignolo, Refosco, Refosco dal Peduncolo Rosso, Schioppettino and Tazzelenghe. The region is divided into 3 sub districts which include Ramandolo in the north and the DOCG of the same name as well as the <b>dessert</b> <b>wine</b> Verduzzo di Ramandolo. In the center of the zone is the Cialla district which makes dry wines under the designation Cialla Bianco and Cialla Rosso as well as sweet and off dry wines made from Picolit and Verduzzo. Other notable wines from this district include Refosco dal Peduncolo Rosso and Cialla Schioppettino. The far southern district is the Corno di Rosazzo which is heavily planted with Ribolla Gialla that is believed to have originated in the vineyards of the local abbey over 1000 years ago. The area is also known for its off-dry to sweet Rosazzo Picolit and dry Rosazzo Pignolo.|$|E
25|$|The {{red wine}} known as Valpolicella is {{typically}} made from three grape varieties: Corvina Veronese, Rondinella, and Molinara. A variety of wine styles {{is produced in}} the area, including a recioto <b>dessert</b> <b>wine</b> and Amarone, a strong wine made from dried grapes. Most basic Valpolicellas are light, fragrant table wines produced in a novello style, similar to Beaujolais nouveau and released {{only a few weeks}} after harvest. Valpolicella Classico is made from grapes grown in the original Valpolicella production zone. Valpolicella Superiore is aged at least one year and has an alcohol content of at least 12 percent. Valpolicella Ripasso is a form of Valpolicella Superiore made with partially dried grape skins that have been left over from fermentation of Amarone or recioto.|$|E
25|$|Greco bianco is {{most widely}} found in {{southern}} Italy {{where it is}} featured in several DOCs. In 2006, it numbered less than 1,000 hectares (2,500 acres) of the varieties planted. In Calabria, a specific clone of Greco bianco is used to produce the sweet <b>dessert</b> <b>wine</b> Greco di Bianco, made in a partial passito style from grapes that have been partially dried after harvest. On the island of Capri, Greco is usually blended with Biancolella and Falanghina to produce dry-style wines. In Apulia, it is a permitted blend component in the Gravina DOC. In Campania, it is featured in the DOCG wine of Greco di Tufo produced around the town of Tufo, Provincia di Avellino. It is also permitted in Lacryma Christi produced {{on the slopes of}} Mount Vesuvius.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to making an aromatic still wine of its own, {{it has often}} been blended with Chardonnay, Viognier, White Zinfandel rosé and even some red wines. It has also been used in <b>dessert</b> <b>wines,</b> sparkling wines and fortified wines.|$|R

25|$|Despite the costs, some wineries {{prefer the}} use of human workers to hand-pick grapes. The main {{advantage}} is the knowledge and discernment of the worker to pick only healthy bunches and the gentler handling of the grapes. The production of some <b>dessert</b> <b>wine</b> like Sauternes and Trockenbeerenauslese require that individual berries are picked from the botrytized bunches {{which can only be}} done by hand. In areas of steep terrain, like in the Mosel, it would be virtually impossible to run a mechanical harvester through the vineyard. In many wine regions, migrant workers are a sizable composition of the harvest time work force as well as local student and itinerant workers. Karen Ross, president of the California Association of Winegrowers, has estimated that as of 2007 as many as 70% of the employees in the California wine industry may be immigrants from Mexico.|$|E
25|$|Over 30 {{different}} grapes {{varieties are}} {{grown in the}} Friuli-Venezia Giulia including international varieties such as Chardonnay, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot {{as well as local}} varieties like Refosco dal peduncolo rosso, Schioppettino, Friulano, Ribolla gialla and Verduzzo. Of the local varieties, Friulano is the most well known and important variety, producing crisp, floral wines that develop notes of nuts and fennel as it ages. The grape was widely known as Tocai Friulano but in 2006 the European Union banned names that have some similarity or association with the Hungarian wine Tokaji. Now Tocai Friulano is called Friulano. The very acidic Ribolla gialla grape was primarily used as a blending component until winemakers started to apply the techniques used with Chardonnay (such as malolactic fermentation) to produce softer, more buttery wines that still retain the crisp, lemon edge of the grape. Wines made from Verduzzo have peach and nutty flavors in their youth but develop more honeyed flavors as the wine ages. The high acidity of the grape works well in sweet production and in regions like Ramandolo it is often dried to make a passito wine. The Picolit grape also does well in sweet wines where it can produce elegant, floral wines that have a dry finish. In contrast to the thin, sometimes bland Pinot grigio produced {{in other parts of the}} Tre-Venezie, well made examples of Friuli Pinot grigio are known for their fuller body and delicate peach, almond and green apple flavors. Sauvignon blancs are made in a style reminiscent of Sancerre with smoke, herbs and elements of honey and hazelnut. Some of the most expensive Friuli wines are made from the Picolit grape which is prone to grape diseases and mutations which cause the vine to lose its flowers and grape clusters. In most years, less than half of a vineyard Picolit crop will survive and be able to make wine. The light, honeyed <b>dessert</b> <b>wine</b> that it can produce is often in high demand because of restricted supply.|$|E
