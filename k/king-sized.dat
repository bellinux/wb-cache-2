At the end of his song, he tells the tribe that the [...] "boogie man" [...] will get them, as the tribe pretends to be frightened. [...] "Dead End", sung by black tribe members, is a list of street signs that symbolize black frustration and alienation. One of the tribe's protest chants is [...] "What do we think is really great? To bomb, lynch and segregate!" [...] "Black Boys/White Boys" [...] is an exuberant acknowledgement of miscegenation; the U.S. Supreme Court had struck down laws against the practice in 1967. [...] Another of the tribe's protest chants is [...] "Black, white, yellow, red. Copulate in a <b>king-sized</b> bed." ...|$|E
500|$|Two {{years before}} the Beatles disbanded, Lennon and Ono began public protests against the Vietnam War. They were married in Gibraltar on 20 March 1969, and spent their honeymoon at the Hilton Amsterdam, campaigning with a week-long Bed-In for Peace. They planned another Bed-In in the United States, but were denied entry, so held one instead at the Queen Elizabeth Hotel in Montreal, where they {{recorded}} [...] "Give Peace a Chance". They often combined advocacy with performance art, as in their [...] "Bagism", first introduced during a Vienna press conference. Lennon detailed this period in the Beatles song [...] "The Ballad of John and Yoko". Lennon changed his name by deed poll on 22 April 1969, adding [...] "Ono" [...] as a middle name. The brief ceremony {{took place on the}} roof of the Apple Corps building, made famous three months earlier by the Beatles' Let It Be rooftop concert. Although he used the name John Ono Lennon thereafter, official documents referred to him as John Winston Ono Lennon, since he was not permitted to revoke a name given at birth. The couple settled at Tittenhurst Park at Sunninghill in Berkshire. After Ono was injured in a car accident, Lennon arranged for a <b>king-sized</b> bed to be brought to the recording studio as he worked on the Beatles' last album, Abbey Road. To escape the acrimony of the band's break-up, Ono suggested they move permanently to Manhattan, which they did on 31 August 1971.|$|E
500|$|Vikram then {{featured}} in Mani Ratnam's bilingual films Raavanan and Raavan, {{inspired by the}} ancient Sanskrit epic Ramayana, with Vikram featuring as the tribal leader, Veeraiya, in the Tamil version and the cop, Dev Pratap Sharma, in the Hindi version of the films which were shot simultaneously. Vikram revealed that changes between the two characters during filming took up to 45 minutes, with Abhishek Bachchan playing the tribal leader in the Hindi version whilst Prithviraj played the cop in the Tamil version, with Aishwarya Rai also in the cast. Vikram was initially apprehensive because both roles were to be shot almost simultaneously but revealed he succeeded by showing differences in his body language and expressions. Vikram revealed that he and Abhishek Bachchan played the roles in the respective versions without inspiration from one another. Despite being a non-speaker and making his debut in Hindi, he dubbed his lines in the language remarking jovially it was the [...] "most difficult thing in the world". After promotions at the Cannes Film Festival and a premiere at Leicester Square in London, the two versions and the dubbed Telugu version released simultaneously in 2,200 screens worldwide and took a big opening on day one earning 20 crores. The Tamil version, Raavanan won rave reviews from critics with The Hindu calling it a [...] "masterstroke" [...] and claiming Vikram [...] "raises the bar higher with every venture". The critic cited that [...] "emotions of love, animus, anguish and joy dance on his face in quick succession", concluding that [...] "Vikram lifts the role to an admirable level". The critic from Sify labelled it as a [...] "astonishing portrayal", while the critic from the Hindustan Times praised Vikram's [...] "ability to get into Veeraiya's skin and emote with conviction". The Tamil version consequently {{went on to become}} a commercial success, with Vikram's performance leading to him winning the Filmfare Award for Best Tamil Actor among other accolades. In contrast, the Hindi version fetched mixed reviews with critics agreeing that Vikram's performance as the tribal leader was more convincing than Bachchan's. Baradwaj Rangan, writing for The New Indian Express rated the film 4/5 and said [...] "Raavan falls for Sita (and vice versa) in an intriguingly idiosyncratic take on the Ramayana– if you can get past the lead performances, that is" [...] whereas Taran Adarsh, writing for Bollywood Hungama rated it 1.5/5 and said, [...] "On the whole, Raavan is a <b>king-sized</b> disappointment, in terms of content" [...] though mentioning that Vikram was [...] "first-rate, although the role isn't substantial enough". Raavan subsequently {{went on to become a}} surprise flop at the Indian box office. The film was also screened at the Venice Film Festival and the Busan International Film Festival, with Vikram in attendance.|$|E

5000|$|In the mid-1950s, the United States bedding {{industry}} {{introduced a}} new size: the king size.
