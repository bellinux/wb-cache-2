40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{describe}} the sources of dietary variance, and determine the variance ratios and the number of days needed for estimating the habitual diet of adolescents. METHODS: Two 24 hour food recalls were used for estimating the energy, macronutrient, fatty acid, fiber and cholesterol intakes of 366 adolescents attending Public Schools in Natal, Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil. The variance ratio between the intrapersonal and interpersonal variances, determined by Analysis of Variance, was calculated. The number of days needed for estimating the habitual intake of each nutrient was given by the hypothetical correlation (r) > 0. 9 between the actual and observed nutrient intakes. RESULTS: Sources of interpersonal variation were higher for all nutrients and in both <b>genders.</b> <b>Variance</b> ratios were < 1 for all nutrients and higher in women. Two 24 hour dietary recalls were enough to assess energy, carbohydrate, fiber and saturated and monounsaturated fatty acid intakes accurately. However, the accurate assessment of protein, lipid, polyunsaturated fatty acid and cholesterol intakes required three 24 hour recalls. CONCLUSION: Interpersonal dietary variance in adolescents was greater than intrapersonal variance for all nutrients, resulting in a variance ratio of less than 1. Two to three 24 hour recalls, depending on gender and the study nutrient, are necessary for estimating the habitual diet of this population...|$|R

In addition, the UNT Customer Satisfaction Survey (UNT-CSS), which applies Hom's Basic Model of Customer Satisfaction, was used to further examine areas of interest identified by the Noel Levitz SSI. Analysis of the SSI data indicated that no statistical significance existed amongst any of the correlates of satisfaction as a function of gender. In fact, African American students appeared to have very similar ideas on what services were important to them and on how satisfied they were with the services provided to them by the university. African American males and females were most satisfied with Campus Support Services, Academic Advising/Counseling, and Instructional Effectiveness at UNT. The UNT-CSS further examined the above areas. African American males and females were measured against each other to discern if differences occur in how African American students process the customer service model as a function of gender. African American males demonstrated strong positive correlations between their expectation of customer service and their consequent evaluation of that service.

The investigation is based on three distinct theoretical perspectives: developmental psychology, social constructionism and personal epistemology. The methods used vary according to the focus in four separate studies: (1) The Interview study is based on the narratives of 23 informants. A qualitative analysis was carried out and central themes are presented at group level. (2) In the Questionnaire study, a bird’s eye view is taken. A quantitative analysis was performed on 611 respondents’ answers about their own attitudes and experienced background to strains. (3) In the Follow-up study, 21 informants from the Interview study were interviewed again after eighteen months. (4) The Case study scrutinizes in detail four informants’ narratives about strains and attitudes on three occasions, over a total of three years. The combination of three different theoretical and three different methodological perspectives was used to make recurrent phenomena more visible, enabling the formulation of developmental tasks during this period of life. The most prominent phenomenon concerning strains is to become someone in the world. This is interpreted as an individuation process, which is a specific developmental task. Depression-like conditions occur and are understood to be transitional expressions of developmental-related sorrow. A spectrum based on prominent attitudes is formulated: vegetative being – creative being – productive doing – warding-off doing. The spectrum includes both problem-solving and problem-distancing attitudes. Common for men and for women is a movement between the problem-distancing and the problem-solving attitudes. The attitudes differ between men and women. Over time, a greater range of problem-solving attitudes is used, and they become less gender-specific. The problem-distancing attitudes decrease, both within the group of women and the group of men, but are still as gender-specific. As time passes, the narratives about the background to strains and future attitudes gain an increased number of themes. These changes are interpreted as a maturity process within the age group. Most of the young adults convey a hopeful view of the future...|$|R

Potential survival and selection effects on mean levels, variances, and genetic and environmental sources of variance were evaluated. Methods: Self-reported health status in 1963 was evaluated in 5, 229 pairs of twins from the Swedish Twin Registry and in a subsample of 351 pairs surviving {{to the age of}} 80 years in 1993.

40|$|Asia (particularly South and Southeast) is home {{to large}} numbers of transpeople: persons who are gender {{identity}} variant in that they present and identify in a gender other than that matching the gender assigned to them at birth. Many make a gender category transition early in life. Access to competent and transfriendly medical support services within the established health system is often difficult, and alternatives are risky. Regardless of physical transition, transpeople are often denied opportunities to change the gender recorded on key identification documents. The result is that transpeople wanting to live in stealth are frustrated {{in their attempts to}} do so. They become easy targets for transprejudice and discrimination, many being pushed towards work at society's margins (for example sex work). Where transpeople are denied the right to change documents specifying their legal gender status, they are also denied legal recognition for mixed-gender partnerships they enter into (i. e. the right to marry, as well as associated family rights, including adoption of children).

5000|$|Biological {{reasons for}} <b>gender</b> <b>variances</b> in {{flashbulb}} memory {{may be explained}} by amygdala asymmetry. The amygdala {{is a part of the}} limbic system, and is linked with memory and emotion. Memory is enhanced by emotion, and studies have shown that people are more likely to remember a negative event than a neutral or positive one. Investigations into the amygdala revealed [...] "people who showed strong amygdala activation in response to a set of positive or negative stimuli (relative to other study participants) also showed superior memory for those stimuli (relative to other study participants)". This may explain why flashbulb memory typically involves traumatic events. When viewing emotional content, research has shown that men enhance their memory by activating their right amygdala while women activate the left side. The functional asymmetry of amygdala activation between genders is exemplified in experimentation with lesions and brain-damaged patients. One study found using a case-matched lesion approach that a [...] "man with right-sided amygdala damage developed major defects in social conduct, emotional processing and personality, and decision making, whereas the man with left-sided amygdala damage did not". [...] The reverse effect was found between two women. An experiment was conducted that had 12 men and 12 women view an assortment of images (emotional and nonemotional). Three weeks after the experiment a follow-up study was conducted testing the memory of those individuals, and it was [...] "revealed that highly emotional pictures were remembered best, and remembered better by women than by men". One study performed an MRI scan on 40 patients after showing them aversive and non-aversive photographs proceeded by a warning stimulus. This experiment found that [...] "previously reported sex differences of memory associations with left amygdala for women and with right amygdala for men were confined to the ventral amygdala during picture viewing and delayed memory". Although it is still unclear how lateralization affects memory, there may be a more effective relationship between activation of the left amygdala and memory than activation of right and memory. Generally speaking, studies testing differences between genders on episodic memory tasks revealed that [...] "women consistently outperform men on tasks that require remembering items that are verbal in nature or can be verbally labeled" [...] (Herlitz, 2008).
