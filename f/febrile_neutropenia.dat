40|$|Objective. Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) is {{important}} in the innate immune response. MBL 2 gene polymorphisms affect MBL expression, and genotypes yielding low MBL levels have been associated with an elevated risk for infections in hematological cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. However, these reported associations are inconsistent, and data on patients with solid tumors are lacking. Here, we investigated the effects of MBL 2 genotypes on irinotecan-induced <b>febrile</b> <b>neutropenia</b> in patients with solid tumors. Patients and Methods. Irinotecan-treated patients were genotyped for the MBL 2 gene. Two promoter (550 H/L and 221 X/Y) and three exon polymorphisms (52 A/D, 54 A/B, and 57 A/C) were determined, together with known risk factors for irinotecan-induced toxicity. Neutropenia and <b>febrile</b> <b>neutropenia</b> were recorded during the first course. Results. Of the 133 patients, 28 % experienced severe neutropenia and 10 % experienced <b>febrile</b> <b>neutropenia.</b> No associations were found between exon polymorphisms and <b>febrile</b> <b>neutropenia.</b> However, patients with the H/H promoter genotype, associated with high MBL levels, experienced significantly more <b>febrile</b> <b>neutropenia</b> than patients with the H/L and L/L genotypes (20 % versus 13 % versus 5 %). Moreover, patients with the HYA haplotype encountered significantly more <b>febrile</b> <b>neutropenia</b> than patients without this high MBL-producing haplotype (16 % versus 4 %). In the subgroup with wild-type exon polymorphisms (A/A), patients with the high MBL promoter phenotype had the highest incidence of <b>febrile</b> <b>neutropenia,</b> regardless of known risk factors. Conclusion. Patients with high MBL 2 promoter genotypes and haplotypes seem more at risk for developing <b>febrile</b> <b>neutropenia.</b> If confirmed, these preliminary findings may contribute to more individualized approaches of irinotecan treatment...|$|E

40|$|Background: <b>Febrile</b> <b>neutropenia</b> is an {{important}} cause of mortality and morbidity in hematology-oncology patients undergoing chemotherapy. The management of <b>febrile</b> <b>neutropenia</b> is typically algorithm-driven. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the results of a standardized protocol for the treatment of <b>febrile</b> <b>neutropenia.</b> Methods: A retrospective cohort study (2011 - 2012) was conducted of patients with high-risk neutropenia in a hematology-oncology service. Results: Forty-four episodes of 17 patients with a median age of 48 years (range: 18 - 78 years) were included. The incidence of <b>febrile</b> <b>neutropenia</b> was 61. 4 %. The presence of <b>febrile</b> <b>neutropenia</b> was associated with both the duration and severity of neutropenia. Microbiological agents were isolated from different sources in 59. 3 % of the episodes with bacteremia iso- lated from blood being the most prevalent (81. 3 %). Multiple drug-resistant gram-negative bacilli were isolated in 62. 5 % of all microbiologically documented infections. Treatment of 63 % of the episodes in which the initial treatment was piperacillin/tazobactam needed to be escalated to meropenem. The mortality rate due to <b>febrile</b> <b>neutropenia</b> episodes was 18. 5 %.
