5|$|In 1787, army {{lieutenant}} {{and part-time}} chemist Carl Axel Arrhenius found a heavy black rock <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> quarry near the Swedish village of Ytterby (now {{part of the}} Stockholm Archipelago). Thinking {{that it was an}} unknown mineral containing the newly discovered element tungsten, he named it ytterbite and sent samples to various chemists for analysis.|$|E
5|$|The {{method of}} {{embalming}} was not recorded, {{but it probably}} involved replacing the blood {{with a mixture of}} turpentine and vermilion. The body was then put <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> clock case and stored in the house of Beswick's family physician, Dr Charles White. Beswick's apparently eccentric will made her a local celebrity, and visitors were allowed to view her at White's house.|$|E

5|$|Constantine grew up <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> priory in the Leicestershire {{village of}} Knipton and went hunting {{from the age}} of seven. She had a close {{relationship}} with her sister Annette Constantine and her father, Joseph Constantine, who was successful in the property and shipping sectors, was an Old Etonian pupil and served in the Coldstream Guards. When she was young, Constantine would rely on her father for fashion advice and has commented that any style that she has, she learned from him. He was a talented artist and was offered worldwide art exhibitions, although he was too modest to accept. His death came suddenly and was a milestone for Constantine.|$|E
5|$|Crewkerne and District Museum {{is part of}} a wider {{heritage}} centre {{which includes}} local archives and a meeting room. The museum opened in 2000 <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> house with an 18th-century frontage. It was restored with the help of grants from the Heritage Lottery Fund, Somerset County Council, South Somerset District Council and Crewkerne Town Council. The development of Crewkerne during the 18th and 19th centuries, with particular emphasis on the flax and linen industry is illustrated with a permanent display. Other collections relate to local archaeology, Coins and Medals, Costume and Textiles, Fine Art, Music, Personalities, Science and Technology, Social History, Weapons and War.|$|E
5|$|Despite her {{relative}} inexperience, Leigh {{was chosen}} to play Ophelia to Olivier's Hamlet <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>Old</b> Vic Theatre production staged at Elsinore, Denmark. Olivier later recalled an incident when her mood rapidly changed as she was preparing to go onstage. Without apparent provocation, she began screaming at him before suddenly becoming silent and staring into space. She was able to perform without mishap, and by the following day she had returned to normal with no recollection of the event. It {{was the first time}} Olivier witnessed such behaviour from her. They began living together, as their respective spouses had each refused to grant either of them a divorce. Under the moral standards then enforced by the film industry, their relationship had to be kept from public view.|$|E

5|$|Egmont Prinz zur Lippe-Weißenfeld {{was born}} on 14 July 1918 in Salzburg, Austria {{as a member of}} a cadet branch of the ruling House of Lippe. His father was Prince Alfred of Lippe-Weißenfeld and his mother was born Countess Anna von Goëß. Egmont was the only son of four children. His sisters Carola, Sophie and Dora were all younger than Egmont. The family lived <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> castle in Upper Austria called Alt Wartenburg. At birth he had a remote chance of {{succeeding}} to the throne of the Principality of Lippe, a small state within the German Empire. However, only months after his birth, Germany became a republic and all the German royal houses were forced to abdicate.|$|E
5|$|In 1880, Crane {{illustrated}} and Evans printed, The Baby's Bouquet: a Fresh Bunch of Old Rhymes and Tunes, {{which went}} on to sell {{hundreds of thousands of}} copies. The book shows influences ranging from the Pre-Raphaelites, Japanese art to the incipient arts and crafts movement. In 1889, Flora's Feast: A Masque of Flowers was published, featuring flowers represented as human figures, for which Evans used as many as eight colour blocks. Their later collaborations includes an edition of Alice in Wonderland with coloured versions of John Tenniel's 1890 illustrations, and the 1899 A Floral Fantasy <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>Old</b> English Garden.|$|E
5|$|In popular memory, Tamar's {{image has}} {{acquired}} a legendary and romantic façade. A diverse set of folk songs, poems and tales illustrate her as an ideal ruler, a holy woman onto whom certain attributes of pagan deities and Christian saints were sometimes projected. For example, <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> Ossetian legend, Queen Tamar conceives her son of a sunbeam which shines through the window. Another myth, from the Georgian mountains, equates Tamar with the pagan deity of weather, Pirimze, who controls winter. Similarly, in the highland district of Pshavi, Tamar's image fused with a pagan goddess of healing and female fertility.|$|E

5|$|Monroe and Job N. Cookus {{purchased}} the Virginia Argus and Hampshire Advertiser newspaper in Romney in 1861. During their joint ownership, the offices for the Virginia Argus and Hampshire Advertiser were located <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> stone building that formerly housed the Romney Academy behind the Hampshire County Courthouse. Monroe and Cookus continued serving as its editors and publishers until the Union Army closed down the Advertiser's offices in August 1861, {{after which the}} newspaper was not revived.|$|E
5|$|On 8 March 1918, Maxwell {{commanded}} a scouting patrol that was operating {{to the east}} of Ploegsteert. Having obtained the required information, he ordered the patrol to withdraw. He and three of his men were covering the withdrawal of the main body when he noticed about thirty Germans nearby. Recalling the patrol, he led an attack against the party, which had sheltered <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> trench; the Germans quickly withdrew, leaving three dead and one wounded prisoner of war. Maxwell was awarded the Military Cross for his actions during this engagement, news of which was published in a supplement to the London Gazette on 13 May 1918.|$|E
5|$|On {{the death}} of Alphonso Vincent in 1932, his son George {{inherited}} the property. He lived at the site <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> lorry {{until his death in}} 1973. The mill passed to his daughter, who sold it in 1974 to Mr and Mrs Humphries, who intended to convert it into a house. They later changed their minds and offered it for sale for restoration. In 1976, the cap of the mill was blown to pieces in a gale. Thelnetham windmill was purchased by five members of the Suffolk Mills Group in November 1979, and plans for restoration were made. The consortium consisted of Mark Barnard, Charles Dolman, Peter Dolman, David Pearce and Chris Seago. The derelict mill and an acre of land cost £6,000.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the {{establishment}} of the Romney Classical Institute in 1846, Romney and its environs had been served by a school as early as 1752, and by Romney Academy, which had been incorporated by the Virginia General Assembly on January 11, 1814. By 1831, Romney Academy had outgrown its educational facilities <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> stone building just north of the Hampshire County Courthouse in Romney. Also at this time, several academies in present-day West Virginia were aspiring to collegiate status, as there were few colleges operating in the region prior to the American Civil War.|$|E
5|$|The Buzz on Maggie follows Maggie Pesky (Jessica DiCicco), an {{expressive}} tween fly and her family; parents Chauncey (Brian Doyle-Murray) and Frieda (Susan Tolsky); brothers Aldrin (David Kaufman) and Pupert (Thom Adcox); {{and sister}} Bella (Tara Strong), {{who is still}} a maggot.

However, she ultimately learns her lesson, {{which was one of the}} core themes for the show's conception.|$|E
