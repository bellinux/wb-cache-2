500|$|The {{production}} team wanted the episode {{to be about}} trash, and show runner Mike Scully pitched the idea that Homer should run for office. Writer Ian Maxtone-Graham {{had a friend who}} had made their way in Chicago politics, through the Sanitation Commission, and so he decided that Homer should run for Sanitation Commissioner. They then {{spent a lot of time}} trying to <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> that Homer would have an [...] "over filled trash can", and through its extensive use of packaging, the concept of Love Day was formed. Originally the episode saw Homer running for mayor, but this idea was abandoned. The ending was talked about for a while, with the original idea being that the whole town would be raised up and the rubbish be swept underneath. The ending was not intended to carry an environmental message, but it played well and is what the staff believe won the episode an Emmy.|$|E

Richards says that she likes the idea that April [...] "went on a journey to try and find herself" [...] as [...] "a lot of people [...] try and do that {{because a lot of people}} <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> where they're not really sure who they are any more". Richards also discusses the motif of April's paper dolls, saying that April can relate to them as in different places, she is [...] "still the same person", but that she is [...] "coloured in differently by different people and different surroundings". Alexandra Hewett, who played the Young April, described the dolls as April's [...] "only real friends".|$|E

It is powered by Unreal Engine 3. [...] Physics for the game are handled using the Havok physics library. A demo was released on June 10, 2010 which allowed for players to play various multiplayer matches using two of the game's character classes. [...] Developer High Moon Studios designed the friendly AI so that as a player progresses through the story any accompanying characters will help the player, but still require the player to advance through the game. [...] "The buddies don't advance the story for you. [...] They <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> to kinda show you where to go, but then they'll take up defensive positions and wait for you to progress the story" [...] said Game Director Matt Tieger. [...] "They're not finishing objectives for you, but they like to stay near you, they'll heal you if you get too wounded, they're pretty smart." ...|$|E
500|$|To {{treat these}} conditions, Jackson used Solaquin, Tretinoin, and Benoquin. On June 29, 2009, {{multiple}} tubes of Benoquin and hydroquinone {{were found in}} Jackson's home. Both creams are commonly used to treat vitiligo; Dr. David Sawcer said some patients with vitiligo <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> where {{it makes more sense}} to remove the brown bits because so much of the skin is pale. On the other hand, getting depigmented skin to darken is extremely difficult. Depigmentation causes a permanent and extreme sensitivity to the sun. Vitiligo patients are at risk to contract melanoma, and an annual cancer check-up is recommended. Jackson also had hydroxychloroquine injected directly into his scalp regularly. Another common way of treating vitiligo is using makeup to camouflage depigmented skin. The treatments Jackson used for his condition further lightened his skin tone, and with the application of pancake makeup to even out his skin tone, he could appear very pale. For example, Stevie Nicks recalled in a Rolling Stone interview: [...] "I remember before , Michael sent somebody to find out if I had any foundation make-up he could borrow. I was using some light Chanel foundation at that time, and Michael sent back a note to say, thanks, but the foundation wasn't quite light enough for him." [...] Jackson also covered his skin disorder with clothing wearing long sleeves and long pants. In the music video for [...] "Remember the Time," [...] all dancers and actors except for Jackson are lightly dressed following the example set by ancient Egyptians. Jackson usually avoided wearing patterned clothing to avoid attention to the disorder.|$|E

2500|$|Several reviewers re-watched {{the episode}} {{after the end}} of the series. Michelle Erica Green called the episode [...] "an episode of mythic proportion, with a tour de force {{performance}} by Avery Brooks" [...] in her review for TrekNation. She praised the plot in the episode saying that [...] "what Sisko really did was choose tactics over intuition, or perhaps intellect over spirituality...and it was the wrong choice. This is a stunning moment for Star Trek: an acknowledgement that there are forces in the universe which cannot be coerced, manipulated, or (as in the case of Q and the Organians) talked into submission by Starfleet captains." [...] She hoped that the repercussions from the episode would lead into the seventh series. Jamahl Epsicokhan at his website [...] "Jammer's Reviews" [...] thought that the episode took a while to <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>point,</b> but then it delivered, using the death of Jadzia in a way to drop Sisko [...] "into an abyss of despair". He thought that the melodrama in Jadzia's pregnancy and subsequent death was exaggerated, and that the manner of the death was random, but the context of the effects of Jadzia's death and the funeral scene [...] "really works". While he was pleased with some of the characterizations in the episode, such as Jeffrey Combs as Weyoun, he felt that the scene with Quark and Bashir was unnecessary. He gave the episode a score of three and a half out of four.|$|E
