5|$|Mann fought Kenny Foster at Bellator 53 {{for a spot}} in {{the next}} Featherweight tournament. He {{dominated}} the stand-up but then got taken down which <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> opportunity to finish via submission (triangle choke) in the first round.|$|E

60|$|Barry {{looked at}} his watch: it was near eight o'clock, {{but he seemed to}} feel that all he had drank had had no effect on him: it had not <b>given</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> usual pluck; it had not <b>given</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> feeling of {{reckless}} assurance, which he mistook for courage and capacity.|$|R
5|$|Donaggio won a 'best {{soundtrack of}} the year' {{award for his}} work on the film, which <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> {{confidence}} to quit his successful singing career and embark on a career scoring films. Donaggio became a regular composer for Brian De Palma films and credits Nicolas Roeg with giving him his first lesson in writing film scores, and expressed a desire to work with him again.|$|E
5|$|During Artavasdes' imprisonment, a {{civil war}} between the Parthians later took place, which <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> {{opportunity}} to escape prison. He took refuge with Augustus, who received him with friendliness, gave him back his daughter Iotapa and made him a Client King of Lesser Armenia. He died around 20 BC probably in Rome.

50|$|He prayed <b>the</b> regent to <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> archbishopric of Cambrai, {{the richest}} in France. This demand was {{supported}} by George I and the regent yielded. Dubois aimed for the Cardinals hat because such an ecclesiastical title would <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> utmost prominence and precedence in the Conseil den haut, <b>giving</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> ability to remove his political adversaries with impunity. The regent was initially reluctant: though not himself a religious man, he could hardly regard Dubois as a suitable archbishop, {{at a time when}} the ambitious Claudine Guérin de Tencin was universally believed to be his mistress.|$|R

Johnson {{was named to the}} 2014 Pro Bowl, but an injury forced him to withdraw.|$|E
5|$|In {{that first}} stage, Garin {{had asked the}} race {{official}} Lefèvre for food, which was illegal.

5|$|Two {{years after}} his {{tutoring}} had begun, {{he was sent to}} the Lower Grammar School at Växjö in 1717. Linnaeus rarely studied, often going to the countryside to look for plants. He reached the last year of the Lower School when he was fifteen, which was taught by the headmaster, Daniel Lannerus, who was interested in botany. Lannerus noticed Linnaeus' interest in botany and <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> run of his garden.|$|E

5|$|After Frank Boucher of the New York Rangers won {{the award}} seven times within eight years, Lady Byng was so {{impressed}} that she <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> original trophy to keep. Lady Byng then donated a second trophy in 1935–36. When Lady Byng died in 1949, the NHL presented another trophy and changed the official name to the Lady Byng Memorial Trophy. In 1962, the original trophy was destroyed in a fire at Boucher's home.|$|E
5|$|After his {{retirement}} from coaching, Headley remained associated with cricket, presenting awards and playing in friendly matches. He was the official {{representative of the}} Jamaican Cricket Board at Constantine's funeral in 1971. Official recognition came Headley's way when {{he was awarded the}} M.B.E. in 1956 and was made an honorary life member of the MCC in 1958. In 1969, a bronze sculpture of his head was unveiled in Jamaica's National Stadium, and in 1973 the Norman Manley Foundation <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> Award for Excellence in Sports. In the latter year, he also received the Order of Distinction. He died in Kingston on 30 November 1983.|$|E
5|$|Alexios's son John II Komnenos succeeded him in 1118, and was to rule until 1143. On {{account of}} his mild and just reign, he {{has been called the}} Byzantine Marcus Aurelius. John was unusual for his lack of cruelty—despite his long reign, he never had anyone killed or blinded. He was loved by his subjects, who <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> name 'John the Good'. He was also an {{energetic}} campaigner, spending much of his life in army camps and personally supervising sieges.|$|E

5|$|Brought {{up in the}} Rhondda Valley, Paul {{became a}} miner after leaving school, but an offer of a {{professional}} contract from Swansea <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> opportunity to leave the colliery. His football career was then disrupted by Second World War, during which he was a physical training instructor. After the war, Paul made his League debut, and spent four years playing first team football for Swansea, winning the Third Division South championship in 1948–49. Transfer listed after an abortive move to Colombian club Millonarios, Paul joined Manchester City for £19,500 in June 1950.|$|E
5|$|Conrad {{seems to}} have been {{involved}} when Henry V revolted against his father in 1105. This would explain his election as Archbishop of Salzburg at the Diet of Mainz on 7 January 1106. At that time the anti-Archbishop Berthold von Moosburg was installed in Salzburg. Conrad came to Salzburg accompanied by his brothers, the counts Otto and Wolfram, with an escort of 1,000 soldiers. Some of these soldiers may well have been servitors, servile rather than free vassals. With this display of force, he was able to force Berthold to abdicate. Pope Paschal II consecrated him as bishop on 21 October 1106 and <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> pallium.|$|E
5|$|Diocletian {{replaced}} the prefect of Rome with his consular colleague Bassus. Most officials {{who had served}} under Carinus, however, retained their offices under Diocletian. In an act of clementia denoted by the epitomator Aurelius Victor as unusual, Diocletian did not kill or depose Carinus' traitorous praetorian prefect and consul Ti. Claudius Aurelius Aristobulus, but confirmed him in both roles. He later <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> proconsulate of Africa and the post of urban prefect for 295. The other figures who retained their offices might have also betrayed Carinus.|$|E

Jerry is frustrated by his television's bad reception, and is convinced by Kramer to have cable illegally installed by two Russians (Vic Polizos and James Lashly).|$|E
5|$|Goldfaden wandered Europe as a {{poet and}} journalist. His plays {{continued}} to be performed in Europe and America, but rarely, if ever, did anyone send him royalties. His health deteriorated – a 1903 letter refers to asthma and spitting up blood – and he {{was running out of}} money. In 1903, he wrote Jacob Dinesohn from Paris, authorizing him to sell his remaining possessions in Romania, clothes and all. This <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> money to head once more to New York in 1904.|$|E
