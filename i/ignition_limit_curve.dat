The coals varied in rank from sub-bituminous to bituminous and were tested in varying concentrations from the <b>ignition</b> <b>limit</b> to 400 g/m 3. Following each successful test the combustion residue was collected, weighed and analysed within a thermogravimetric analyser, allowing Q factors to be estimated. The <b>ignition</b> <b>limit</b> varied slightly in air, but was mostly around the 200 g/m 3 level. With the exception of Coal C, which was much harder to ignite, it correlated roughly with coal rank.

Only a few high volatile coals ignited in 21 % O 2 /CO 2 v/v, and then only with a 2500 J, rather than a 1000 J, igniter. An increase in O 2 /CO 2 levels to 30 or 35 % gave ignition patterns similar to those carried out in air with a further increase to 40 % having little additional effect.

As shown in Fig.  8, the shear <b>limit</b> <b>curve</b> is activated and shear failure is initiated once the column shear demand exceeds the column shear capacity.

40|$|Abstract − Just by {{adjusting}} the control points iteratively, progressive iterative approximation (PIA) presents an intuitive and straightforward scheme such that the resulting <b>limit</b> <b>curve</b> (surface) can interpolate the original data points. In order to obtain more flexibility, adjusting only {{a subset of the}} control points, a new method called local progressive iterative approximation (LPIA) has also been proposed. But to this day, there are two problems about PIA and LPIA: (1) Only an approximation process is discussed, but the accurate convergence curves (surfaces) are not given. (2) In order to obtain an interpolating curve (surface) with high accuracy, recursion computations are needed time after time, which result in a large workload. To overcome these limitations, this paper gives an explicit matrix expression of the control points of the <b>limit</b> <b>curve</b> (surface) by the PIA or LPIA method, and proves that the column vector consisting of the control points of the PIA’s <b>limit</b> <b>curve</b> (or surface) can be obtained by multiplying the column vector consisting of the original data points on the left by the inverse matrix of the collocation matrix (or the Kronecker product of the collocation matrices in two direction) of the blending basis at the parametric values chosen by the original data points. Analogously, the control points of the LPIA’s <b>limit</b> <b>curve</b> (or surface) can also be calculated by one-step. Furthermore, the G 1 joining conditions between two adjacent <b>limit</b> <b>curves</b> obtained from two neighboring data points sets are derived.
