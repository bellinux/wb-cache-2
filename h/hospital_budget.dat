50|$|This {{management}} science {{as applied to}} the surgical suite is gaining more attention because of increasing market pressures on hospitals from competitors (e.g., other surgical suites including office based surgery) and from payers seeking lower prices. The surgical suite is often considered a profitable hospital unit. As such, surgical suites also comprise an important fraction of <b>hospital</b> <b>budget</b> spending. Holding patient safety constant, the opportunity to increase financial gain through modifying the use of already existing resources is a prime target for managerial analysis. Incremental improvements in operating room utilization and operating room efficiency can have major impacts on hospital staff and finances. Some hospital administrators perceive efficiency {{in the operating room}} as throughput, completing the most surgical cases within budget. Later in this article we will provide examples of tools a manager may use to analyze efficiency.|$|E

50|$|Once a {{regulatory}} agency has determined the clinical benefit {{and safety of}} a product and pricing has been confirmed (if necessary), a drug manufacturer will typically submit it for evaluation by a payer of some sort. Payers may be private insurance plans, governments (through the provision of benefits plans to insured populations or specialized entities like Cancer Care Ontario, which funds in-hospital oncology drugs) or health care organizations such as hospitals. At this point the critical issue is cost-effectiveness. This is where the discipline of pharmaco-economics is often applied. This is a specialized field of health economics that looks at the cost/benefit of a product in terms of quality of life, alternative treatments (drug and non-drug) and cost reduction or avoidance {{in other parts of}} the health care system (for example, a drug may reduce the need for a surgical intervention, thereby saving money). Structures like the UK’s National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence and Canada’s Common Drug Review evaluate products in this way. Some jurisdictions do not, however, evaluate products for cost-effectiveness. In some instances, individual drug benefit plans (or their administrators) may also evaluate products. Additionally, hospitals may have their own review committees (often called a Pharmacy and Therapeutics (P&T) committee) to make decisions about which drugs to fund from the <b>hospital</b> <b>budget.</b>|$|E

40|$|The use of Diagnosis Related Groups (DRG) as a {{mechanism}} for hospital financing is a currently debated topic in Portugal. The DRG system {{was scheduled to be}} initiated by the Health Ministry of Portugal on January 1, 1990 as an instrument for the allocation of public <b>hospital</b> <b>budgets</b> funded by the National Health Service (NHS), and as a method of payment for other third party payers (e. g., Public Employees (ADSE), private insurers, etc.). Based on experience from other countries such as the United States, it was expected that implementation of this system would result in more efficient hospital resource utilisation and a more equitable distribution of <b>hospital</b> <b>budgets.</b> However, in order to minimise the potentially adverse financial impact on hospitals, the Portuguese Health Ministry decided to gradually phase {{in the use of the}} DRG system for budget allocation by using blended hospitalspecific and national DRG casemix rates. Since implementation in 1990, the percentage of each <b>hospitals</b> <b>budget</b> based on <b>hospital</b> specific costs was to decrease, while the percentage based on DRG casemix was to increase. This was scheduled to continue until 1995 when the plan called for allocating yearly budgets on a 50 % national and 50 % hospitalspecific cost basis. While all other nonNHS third party payers are currently paying based on DRGs, the adoption of DRG casemix as a National Health Service budget setting tool has been slower than anticipated. There is now some argument in both the political and academic communities as to the appropriateness of DRGs as a budget setting criterion as well as to their impact on hospital efficiency in Portugal. This paper uses a twostage procedure to assess the impact of actual DRG payment on the productivity (through its components, i. e., technological change and technical efficiency change) of diagnostic technology in Portuguese hospitals during the years 1992 – 1994, using both parametric and nonparametric frontier models. We find evidence that the DRG payment system does appear to have had a positive impact on productivity and technical efficiency of some commonly employed diagnostic technologies in Portugal during this time span...|$|R

40|$|Pharmaceutical costs, which {{approach}} $ 40 billion annually, {{account for}} about 8 % of health care costs. Prescription drugs represent 5 % to 20 % of the total <b>hospital</b> <b>budget,</b> and antimicrobials account for 20 % to 50 % of hospital pharmaceutical costs. At one university hospital, the percentage of patients receiving antimicrobials increased from 31. 8 % in 1988 to 53. 1 % in 1994. Receipt of vancomycin {{has been associated with}} the emergence of resistant enterococci and has resulted in Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendations for its use. Studies show that vancomycin use is increasing, that dosing is often inappropriate, that certain populations (such as oncology, neurosurgery, and cardiovascular surgery patients) are more likely to receive vancomycin, and that often use is not consistent with CDC recommendations. Few studies have assessed the cost of vancomycin use; those that have show that it is costly. Further studies of vancomycin use are needed, so that use can be improved through focused educational programs.

The population of the study was 290 nurse administrators from all public and private JCAH hospitals of 300 or more beds located in the north-central division of the United States. A questionnaire requesting demographic information and containing two subscales, Initiating Structure and Consideration, of the LBDQ-Form XII was mailed to the nursediiri-nis trators. One hundred eighty-eight questionnaires were returned for a response rate of 65 percent. Analysis of data utilized both descriptive and inferential statistics. The demographic profile depicts the nurse administrator as a 40 to 49 year old married female vice-president of nursing, reporting to the hospital president, earning over $ 60, 000 a year and having had experience as a staff nurse, head nurse, supervisor, assistant or associate director of nursing.
