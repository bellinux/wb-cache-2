This study took 50 students of the Faculty of Languages and Arts Soegijapranata Catholic University as participants.

The writer distributed questionnaire to the participants to get their responses on how they show their disagreement toward their lecturer in four different situations. The writers found that most students apply the strategy of giving reasons to show their disapproval. Besides, the participants also apply negative politeness strategies in showing disagreement.

40|$|What {{is it to}} be {{interested}} in truth? According to what I call the Standard View, the lover of truth wants to believe that p if and only if ‘p ’ is true. In this paper, I argue that the Standard View is incorrect. In the first section, I sketch my views on two related questions: ‘Why are we interested in truth? ’ and ‘Is such an interest optional? ’ In section 2, I explain the Standard View, which builds on William James’s Insight that our interest in truth has two aspects – we want to catch the truth and avoid false beliefs. I criticize the Standard View in sections 3 - 5 by rejecting the idea that wanting to believe that p only if p is part of what, intuitively, is being interested in truth. Wanting to believe that p, if ‘p ’ is true, however, is central to our idea of being interested in truth. This leaves me with {{the problem of how to}} accommodate James’s Insight and I deal with this problem in sections 6 and 7. I suggest that a desire not to believe inconsistencies is another aspect of our interest in truth. I find support for my view in considering Chisholm’s remarks on the interest in truth but I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>disagree</b> with Ernest Sosa on these matters. 1. Some Backgroun...|$|E

40|$|We {{appreciate}} the comments and concerns expressed by Arakawa and colleagues regarding our article, titled “Pulsatile control of rotary blood pumps: Does the modulation waveform matter?” 1 Unfortunately, we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>disagree</b> with Arakawa and colleagues. As is {{obvious from the}} title of our article, it investigates the effect of different waveforms on the heart–device interaction. In contrast to the authors' claim, {{this is the first}} article in the literature that uses basic waveforms (sine, triangle, saw tooth, and rectangular) with different phase shifts to examines their impact on left ventricular unloading. The previous publications 2, 3 and 4 just varied the pump speed during systole and diastole, which was first reported by Bearnson and associates 5 in 1996, and studied its effect on aortic pressure, coronary flow, and end-diastolic volume. We should mention that dp/dtmax is a load-sensitive parameter of contractility and not representative for the degree of unloading. Moreover, none of the aforementioned reports has studied mechanical unloading and in particular the stroke work of the left ventricle. Our method is unique because we do not just alternate between high and low speed but have accurate control of the waveform because of the direct drive system of Levitronix Technologies LLC (Waltham, Mass) and a custom-developed pump controller. Without referring, Arakawa and associates state “several previous studies have already reported the coronary flow diminishes as the left ventricular assist device support increases. ” It should be noted that all the waveforms used in our study have 2000 rpm average value with 1000 rpm amplitude, which is not an excessive speed for the CentriMag rotary pump (Levitronix) to collapse the ventricle and diminish the coronary flow. We agree with Arakawa and coworkers {{that there is a need}} for a heart failure model to come to more relevant results with respect to clinical expectations. However, we have explored many existing models, including species and breeds that have a native proneness to cardiomyopathy, but all of them differ from the genetic presentation in humans. We certainly do not believe that the use of microembolization, in which the coronary circulation is impaired by the injection of microspheres, would form a good model from which to draw conclusions about coronary flow change under different loading conditions. A model would be needed in which either an infarct is created to mimic ischemic heart failure or the coronary circulation remains untouched to simulate, for instance, dilated cardiomyopathy. Furthermore, in discussion we clearly mention that “lack of heart failure is a major limitation of our study. ” We also believe that unloading is not the only factor of the cardiac functional recovery, and an excessive unloading of the left ventricle might lead to cardiac tissue atrophy. Therefore, in our article we mention that control of the level of cardiac unloading by assist devices has been suggested as a mechanical tool to promote recovery, and more studies are required to find better strategies for the speed modulation of rotary pumps and to achieve an optimal heart load control to enhance myocardial recovery. Finally, there are many publications about pulsing rotary blood pumps and it was impossible to include them all. We preferred to reference some of the earlier basic works such as an original research by Bearnson and coworkers 5 and another article published by our group, 6 which is more relevant...|$|E
