40|$|This study {{reports the}} {{microfabrication}} {{of a novel}} interconnect technology for out-of-plane biomedical probe arrays. This type of interconnect technology {{can be used to}} interconnect probe arrays perpendicular onto a backbone resulting in slim-base three-dimensional probe arrays. The microfabrication of such interconnect has been realized using bio-tolerable materials and CMOS compatible prost-processing techniques. This type of interconnect can also be used in many other non-biomedical fields which require a modular, out-of-plane integration concept. CMOS structures can be connected perpendicular with each other, without the need to significantly increase the re-distributed fan-in / fan-out area. Currently, silicon microfabricated probe arrays are often used to record and stimulate neurons at the cellular level. They can contain embedded electronics such as filters, amplifiers and multiplexers, which are integrated into the base of the probe array. Integrated electronics consume a significant amount of surface area and increases the height of the probe array. Implantation of such probe array into the cortical tissue requires extra space above the implanted area, which is most often not available. Consequently, the probe array could be caught between the skull and the cortical tissue, resulting in tissue damage or probe failure. Besides, the brain is constantly moving due to physical movement or macro movements caused by blood pulsation. The ideal probe array for long term and chronic recordings moves along with the cortical movements rather than remain attached or clamped against the skull. To fulfill the floating requirement the base of the probe array should be reduced in height and become as thin as possible. This study describes a technique to connect the shafts perpendicularly to the tall base of the probe array. This approach realizes a slim-base three-dimensional probe array while retaining the ability to integrate complex functions such as filtering, amplification, and multiplexing of the recorded neural signals. Realizing such slim-base out-of-plane biomedical probe array requires a new type of modular high density interconnect, which electrically interconnects the shaft with the tall base. An assembly technique has been developed to align and assemble the probe arrays perpendicular into the base of the probe array. Once the shafts are assembled perpendicularly into the tall base (better known as platform), a non-separable, mechanical stable electrical connection is established. The platform or tall base contains several cavities, which act as socket for the perpendicularly assembled shafts and provide mechanical stability. The electrical interconnects consist of <b>gold</b> <b>clips</b> overhanging the edge of a cavity. During the perpendicularly assembly of the probe array the metal clips will be bent and squeezed between the insulated wall of the cavity and the contact pad located on the probe array. Two microfabrication techniques have been developed to realize the interconnect for slim-base three-dimensional probe arrays. Bothmethods have their own specific technique to deposit the electrical interconnects {{over the edge of the}} cavity. The first technique uses a sacrificial filling method, while the second technique uses a thin film transfer bonding method. Several test structures have been developed to measure the contact resistance as well as the perpendicular fit. An interconnect density with a pitch of 35 &# 956;m and spacing of 15 &# 956;m has been achieved with contact resistances of about 3 Ohm. The slim-base three-dimensional probe array has been implanted in a Long-Evans rat under ketamine/xylazine anesthesia. Successful recordings were measured showing local field potentials and multiunit activity. A post-process tip sharpening technique has been developed to sharpen the chisel shape tip of the probe (prior to assembly), enabling to implant the three-dimensional probe array in bigger size primates without the need to open the dura and thus minimizing the change on in subdural infections. status: publishe...|$|E

50|$|On 19 September 2006, Therapy? {{performed}} an exclusive studio show of songs chosen by fans who had voted for their three favourite tracks from a lengthy list on the band's website. These votes were counted and the twelve tracks {{with the most}} votes were then {{performed an}}d recorded (both as audio and video). In early 2007, these tracks became available to buy from the band's official website. The Webgig is no longer available to purchase. In addition to this release, the band received some attention from their old record company Universal Records (who own {{the rights to the}} band's material recorded on A&M Records) who released both a DVD of old promo <b>clips</b> (<b>Gold)</b> and a double-CD compilation of BBC sessions (Music Through A Cheap Transistor) in 2007. On the touring front, Therapy? focused on markets they had not usually played, including a slot at the NXNE festival in Canada, festival dates in Europe (one of which was as a late replacement for Helmet at the Nova Rock Festival) and a tour through countries such as Romania, Croatia and Serbia, even playing two gigs on Reunion Island, off the East African coast. The band ended 2007 by supporting New Model Army at their Christmas gig in Köln.|$|R
40|$|MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a {{class of}} small (19 - 25 nt) non-coding RNAs. This {{important}} class of gene regulator downregulates gene expression through sequence-specific binding to the 3 'untranslated regions (3 'UTRs) of target mRNAs. Several computational target prediction approaches {{have been developed for}} predicting miRNA targets. However, the predicted target lists often have high false positive rates. To construct a workable target list for subsequent experimental studies, we need novel approaches to properly rank the candidate targets from traditional methods. We performed a systematic analysis of experimentally validated miRNA targets using functional genomics data, and found significant functional associations between genes that were targeted by the same miRNA. Based on this finding, we developed a miRNA target prioritization method named mirTarPri to rank the predicted target lists from commonly used target prediction methods. Leave-one-out cross validation has proved to be successful in identifying known targets, achieving an AUC score up to 0. 84. Validation in high-throughput data proved that mirTarPri was an unbiased method. Applying mirTarPri to prioritize results of six commonly used target prediction methods allowed us to find more positive targets {{at the top of the}} prioritized candidate list. In comparison with other methods, mirTarPri had an outstanding performance in <b>gold</b> standard and <b>CLIP</b> data. mirTarPri was a valuable method to improve the efficacy of current miRNA target prediction methods. We have also developed a web-based server for implementing mirTarPri method, which is freely accessible at [URL]...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} {{field is}} curation {{within the context}} of the independent gallery space. This solo exhibition of American artist Sarah Baker’s exploration of stereotypes and associations of masculinity and femininity focuses on the American synchronised swimmer Bill May. As a child Baker, a synchronised swimmer herself, competed against May and her research focused on depicting him as a glamorous male equivalent of a star in the Busby Berkely ‘aqua-musicals’ of the 1940 s and 50 s that featured Esther Williams. Seitz curated the exhibition and associated publicity in the gallery 1, 000, 000 MPH. A gallery he co-founded in 2002. The gallery, now with charitable status and registered with Tower Hamlets Council, is located in Old Bethnal Green Road, London E 2. Seitz and Esther Williams are the curators, either separately or together. The rationale for the exhibition space featuring new artists such as Simon Bedwell and more established figures such as Richard Wentworth, is that it be non-commercial and encourage experimental art in any media. To this end it has recently exhibited digital artworks by Jane Prophet. The curation included use of a heavy rap soundtrack (by Usher and D 12) for the film to echo the male stereotype the artist makes allusions to and a poster (48 ” X 56 ”) which shows May in a monogrammed tracksuit seated in a gold chair. A <b>gold</b> swimmer’s nose <b>clip</b> was also exhibited and worn by May in the poster as a ‘bling-style’ ring. The background echoes Louis Vuitton’s exclusive but much counterfeited monogram repeat pattern designs ([URL] and [URL]. 1, 000, 000 MPH is a venue also used by ‘Local Operations’ under the auspices of The Sackler Centre of Arts Education, The Serpentine Gallery. For example ‘Pimps and Hookers and a Salon’ (16 th June 2007) comprised debates on art as a culture industry, the later including Sarah Baker...|$|R
