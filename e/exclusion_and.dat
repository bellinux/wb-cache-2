5|$|Parts of New Labour's {{political}} philosophy linked crime with social <b>exclusion</b> <b>and</b> pursued policies to encourage partnerships between social and police authorities to lower crime rates. Other areas of New Labour's policy maintained a traditional approach to crime; {{the prison population}} in 2005 rose to over 76,000, mostly owing to the increasing length of sentences. Following the September 11 attacks, the Labour government attempted to emphasise counter-terrorism measures. From 2002, the government followed policies aimed at reducing anti-social behaviour; in the 1998 Crime and Disorder Act, Labour introduced Anti-Social Behaviour Orders (ASBOs).|$|E
5|$|Carpet beetles {{are members}} of the family Dermestidae, and while the adult beetles feed on nectar and pollen, the larvae are {{destructive}} pests in homes, warehouses and museums. They feed on animal products including wool, silk, leather, fur, the bristles of hair brushes, pet hair, feathers and museum specimens. They tend to infest hidden locations and may feed on larger areas of fabrics than do clothes moths, leaving behind specks of excrement and brown, hollow, bristly-looking cast skins. Management of infestations is difficult and is based on <b>exclusion</b> <b>and</b> sanitation where possible, resorting to pesticides when necessary. The beetles can fly in from outdoors and the larvae can survive on lint fragments, dust and inside the bags of vacuum cleaners. In warehouses and museums, sticky traps baited with suitable pheromones can be used to identify problems, and heating, freezing, spraying the surface with insecticide and fumigation will kill the insects when suitably applied. Susceptible items can be protected from attack by keeping them in clean airtight containers.|$|E
5|$|In soil, {{microorganisms}} that {{reside in}} the rhizosphere (a zone that includes the root surface and the soil that adheres to the root after gentle shaking) carry out nitrogen fixation, converting nitrogen gas to nitrogenous compounds. This serves to provide an easily absorbable form of nitrogen for many plants, which cannot fix nitrogen themselves. Many other bacteria are found as symbionts in humans and other organisms. For example, the presence of over 1,000 bacterial species in the normal human gut flora of the intestines can contribute to gut immunity, synthesise vitamins, such as folic acid, vitamin K and biotin, convert sugars to lactic acid (see Lactobacillus), as well as fermenting complex undigestible carbohydrates. The presence of this gut flora also inhibits the growth of potentially pathogenic bacteria (usually through competitive <b>exclusion)</b> <b>and</b> these beneficial bacteria are consequently sold as probiotic dietary supplements.|$|E

5|$|The Labour Government {{expected}} {{eventually to}} present a bill for a second stage of House of Lords reform, thus removing the remaining 92 hereditary peers; the history of such attempts between 1997 and 2009 is set out in a report in The Guardian. Proposals called The House of Lords: Reform were published by order of the House on 1 January 2007, with a foreword by Jack Straw. In 2009, Labour introduced the Constitutional Reform and Governance Bill, which would have ended the by-elections to fill vacancies for hereditary peers, thereby removing them through attrition. However, {{in order to ensure}} the passage of the bill through Parliament before the 2010 general election, this clause was dropped from the bill entirely, along with other clauses relating to the <b>exclusion</b> <b>and</b> suspension of peers from the House of Lords.|$|E

Ben Arimah cites this social <b>exclusion</b> <b>and</b> poor infrastructure as a cause for numerous slums in African cities. Poor quality, unpaved streets encourage slums; a 1% increase in paved all-season roads, claims Arimah, reduces slum incidence rate by about 0.35%. Affordable public transport and economic infrastructure empowers poor people to move and consider housing options other than their current slums.|$|E

This redundancy generates a sense of obsession throughout the narrative, Erika's obsession to learn the truth, and Hilde's obsession to forget it.

Four <b>exclusions</b> <b>and</b> 2 attributions were made possible only by the combined use of several DNA polymorphisms, as the analyses of red-blood-cell antigens and isoenzymes, serum proteins and HLA group determinants were inconclusive. With the DNA test, 10 <b>exclusions</b> <b>and</b> 15 attributions were confirmed, with increased overall probability. In conclusion, VNTR polymorphisms were more informative, accurate and sensitive than the immunohematologic tests. Therefore, DNA analysis is the method of choice for testing genetic relationships...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the thesis is to analyse <b>exclusions</b> <b>and</b> {{exceptions}} from patentability which is a negative requirement for an invention to enjoy a patent protection. It aims {{to answer the question}} why the <b>exclusions</b> are needed <b>and</b> whether they should be preserved as some of them proved to be very controversial. The law and practice of the European Patent Office, the Czech Republic and the United Kingdom are compared with the emphasis on the European Patent Convention and the EPO's case law. In the national regulation, mainly the differences and peculiarities to the European approach are pointed out. The work is composed of four chapters. The first chapter explains the basic concepts of patent law and presents justifications for patent protection. The second chapter deals with various patent systems and reviews the most important international tools of harmonization. In the third chapter, the <b>exclusions</b> are introduced <b>and</b> the distinction between Article 52 (2) <b>and</b> (3) EPC (<b>exclusions)</b> <b>and</b> Article 53 (exceptions) is clarified whereas it is submitted that the difficulty posed by the exclusions lies in the interpretation of the words "as such" used in Article 52 (3) EPC.

25|$|Sociologist Ruth Levitas created three sociological interpretations used {{to examine}} ways in which {{societies}} can remedy social exclusion. These tactics affect youth because they deal with the labor market and thus young people just beginning to gain financial independence. The redistributionist discourse (RED) sees poverty as the greatest contributor to social exclusion. This understanding focuses on transferring taxes and welfare to those in need. The moral underclass discourse (MUD) interpretation blames individual choice for causing social exclusion. This method suggests punishment {{as a means of}} remedying social exclusion. The last method, social integrationist discourse (SID), views the labor market as the enemy to social <b>exclusion</b> <b>and</b> therefore explores avenues for getting more people into the labor force.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{association}} between attachment styles and stigma in adults. Participants were 361 adults (186 females and 175 males) aged between 18 and 69 (M= 31. 77, SD= 9. 45). Participants completed the measurement instruments for determining their stigmatizing tendencies and attachment styles. Study results showed that, stigma tendencies of people with the secure attachment style are lower for the discrimination <b>and</b> <b>exclusion,</b> prejudgment <b>and</b> psychological health dimensions, and are higher for people with the fearful attachment style for the discrimination <b>and</b> <b>exclusion,</b> labeling <b>and</b> psychological health dimensions. Preoccupied and dismissive attachment styles are also positively associated with prejudgment tendency. Finally, stigma tendencies of males are more likely to be higher than females for the discrimination <b>and</b> <b>exclusion,</b> labeling <b>and</b> psychological health dimensions. Because different attachment styles are related variously to the subscales of stigma in this study, interventions to decrease stigma of individuals can verge to enhancing the quality of mother-child interactions...|$|R
