5|$|Noda is a {{self-reliant}} {{young man}} who executes the strategies formed by the SSS and fights with a <b>halberd.</b> He does not listen to anyone other than Yuri, for whom he has adoration, and is antagonistic to almost everyone else. He has a one-sided rivalry with Otonashi. He is a complete idiot whose weakness is education; at one point, Takeyama is able to knock him out by reciting pi. He {{is not afraid to}} harm or kill anyone who gets in Yuri's way. Though he prefers to fight with his <b>halberd,</b> he sometimes uses guns out of necessity, the type of weaponry that he hates.|$|E
5|$|The Ancient Minister's true {{identity}} {{is found to}} be that of the Master R.O.B. unit, who rebels against Ganondorf to join the allied characters. The three major groups that had formed over the storyline then all converge in one area, and use the <b>Halberd</b> to battle Ganondorf and Bowser's subspace gunship. Although they destroy the <b>Halberd,</b> all of the characters make it out unscathed in smaller vehicles. Unable to hit so many targets, Ganondorf and Bowser retreat into subspace after Kirby destroys the gunship with his dragoon. An enraged Ganondorf turns Bowser into a trophy with his dark cannon, and he learns that Master Hand was being manipulated by the chains of the actual Subspace Army leader, known only as Tabuu. Ganondorf jumps up and does the attack on Tabuu who easily defeats him, Ganondorf collides with Master Hand, thus breaking free from the chains and turning Ganondorf into his trophy. Master Hand attempts to attack Tabuu, but to no avail.|$|E
5|$|Another Malta convoy (Operation Substance) was {{conducted}} in mid-July, heavily escorted by Force H and elements of the Home Fleet and another in early August (Operation Style), albeit with only Force H covering the convoy. Several weeks later, Fury participated in Operation Mincemeat, during which Force H escorted a minelayer to Livorno to lay its mines while Ark Royals aircraft attacked Northern Sardinia as a diversion. In late September, the destroyer escorted another convoy to Malta in Operation <b>Halberd.</b>|$|E

5|$|Ark Royal {{was pressed}} into service, {{delivering}} aircraft to Malta during several supply runs throughout June and July, and escorting the convoys of Operation Substance in July and Operation <b>Halberd</b> in September. Despite some losses, the convoys succeeded in keeping Malta supplied and fighting. The continued Allied presence in Malta was a considerable problem for Rommel in Africa, who was losing {{as much as}} ⅓ of his supplies from Italy to submarines and bombers based there. Adolf Hitler decided to send a flotilla of U-boats into the Mediterranean to attack Allied shipping, {{against the advice of}} Großadmiral Raeder.|$|E
5|$|In Þorleifs þáttr jarlsskálds, Þorleifr Ásgeirsson, {{known as}} jarlsskáld ("the Jarl’s skald"), recites an abusive and magically {{aggressive}} poem in Earl Haakon's hall. In chapter 7 (chapter 173 of Óláfs saga Tryggvasonar), Haakon recovers from his injuries and offers gifts to Þorgerðr Hǫrdabrúðr {{and her sister}} Irpa, seeking their counsel {{on how best to}} take vengeance on Þorleifr. Following their advice, Haakon has a wooden man (Old Norse trémaðr) built out of driftwood and endows it with a human heart. Haakon and the two sisters then bring the trémaðr to life, arm him with a <b>halberd,</b> and send him to Iceland to kill Þorleifr, which he does.|$|E
5|$|The Ancient Minister is {{revealed}} as a subordinate to Ganondorf, Bowser and Wario {{who are under}} orders from Master Hand to draw the world into Subspace. Wario, who had stolen Ness with his dark cannon, is turned into a trophy by a Pokémon Trainer Red and a vengeful Lucas, and is then helplessly sucked in by a Subspace Bomb. Meanwhile, Meta Knight seeing his ship, the <b>Halberd,</b> being used for evil, leaves his group to reclaim it. He meets and allies with Lucario and Solid Snake, where they reach the cockpit and destroy the Mr. Game and Watch clones that were piloting it.|$|E

5|$|HMS Garland, {{also known}} by her Polish {{designation}} ORP Garland, was a G-class destroyer {{built for the}} Royal Navy in the mid-1930s. During the Spanish Civil War of 1936–1939 the ship spent considerable time in Spanish waters, enforcing the arms blockade imposed by Britain and France {{on both sides of}} the conflict. Shortly after World War II began, she was badly damaged by the premature explosion of her own depth charges and required over six months of repairs. Before these were completed, Garland was loaned to the Polish Navy in May 1940. The ship was assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet afterwards and escorted convoys there before being assigned to the Western Approaches Command in September for escort duties. She escorted a convoy from Gibraltar to Malta during Operation <b>Halberd</b> in September 1941 and escorted Convoy PQ-16 from Iceland to Murmansk in May 1942. She was badly damaged by a near miss from a German bomber during that operation and required three months of repairs.|$|E
5|$|On 23 July, {{during a}} Malta supply convoy (Operation Substance), Forester rescued {{survivors}} from her sister , {{which had been}} attacked by Italian torpedo-bombers, and then sank the wrecked and burning ship with torpedoes. A week later she screened the capital ships of Force H as they covered another Malta convoy (Operation Style). Over the next several months, Forester participated in Operation <b>Halberd,</b> another Malta convoy and escorted Ark Royal and Furious as they made several trips to fly off aircraft for Malta (Operations Status, Status II and Callboy). Upon her return to the UK on 26 October, the destroyer was briefly assigned to the 11th Escort Group before rejoining the Home Fleet at Scapa Flow in November. She then began a lengthy refit and work up that lasted until April 1942.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of 911 September, the British {{launched}} several air strikes on Messina, and Gorizia contributed her anti-aircraft batteries {{to the defense of}} the port. Later in the month, the British sent another convoy to reinforce Malta codenamed Operation Halberd; the Italian fleet sortied on 26 September to try to intercept it, but broke off the operation upon discovering the strength of the British escort force. On 29 September, upon returning from the failed attempt to disrupt Operation <b>Halberd,</b> Gorizia was sent to operate from La Maddalena, though she returned to Messina on 10 October. An Allied air attack on the port on 21 November caused extensive damage to Gorizias superstructure from bomb splinters, though she nevertheless sortied that day to escort another convoy to North Africa. On 16 and 17 December, while on another convoy escort mission, she took part in the First Battle of Sirte against a force of British light cruisers and destroyers.|$|E

5|$|The mode {{begins as}} Mario and Kirby {{face each other}} on a stadium located in the Smash Bros. world. In this world, when a fighter is defeated, they turn into a trophy form, which can be revived by {{touching}} the base. Suddenly, smoke pours from {{the sky and the}} Battleship <b>Halberd</b> flies over. It releases a stream of black purple-clouded bugs called Shadow Bugs that form the soldiers of the Subspace Army. The Ancient Minister, a cloak-clad, mysterious hovering General of the Subspace Army, arrives with his Army and detonates a Subspace Bomb, which can only be detonated by the sacrifice of two R.O.B.s, and which transports the stadium into Subspace, an alternate dimension where the Subspace Army resides. The Ancient Minister's advance prompts the heroes to progressively team up and attempt to repel the enemy, while villains harvest the power of the allied characters by using dark cannons to convert them into trophies, and using shadow bugs on some of them to fight the protagonists during their adventure.|$|E
25|$|By August 1941 Dunedin Star {{was back}} in Britain. On 9 August she left the Firth of Clyde with Convoy WS 8C to Scapa Flow, {{returning}} to the Clyde on 17 August. Then she and a Blue Star sister ship, , took part in Operation <b>Halberd</b> to relieve the siege of Malta. On 17 September they left the Clyde with Convoy WS 011D, which at sea became Convoy WS 11X. The convoy was bound for Bombay but the ships for Operation <b>Halberd</b> detached in the North Atlantic and reached Gibraltar on 24 September. There eight merchant ships formed Convoy GM 2, which left the same day under heavy Royal Navy escort for Malta.|$|E
25|$|Operation <b>Halberd</b> was a British naval {{operation}} {{that took place}} on 27 September 1941, during the Second World War. The British were attempting to deliver a convoy from Gibraltar to Malta.

25|$|As well as {{exporting}} raw copper/bronze, {{there were}} some technical and cultural developments in Ireland that had an important impact on other areas of Europe. Irish food vessels were adopted in northern Britain around 2200 BC and this roughly coincides with {{a decline in the}} use of beakers in Britain (Needham 1996). The ‘bronze halberd’ (not {{to be confused with the}} medieval <b>halberd)</b> was a weapon in use in Ireland from around 2400–2000 BC They are essentially broad blades that were mounted horizontally on a meter long handle, giving greater reach and impact than any known contemporary weapon (O’Flaherty 2007). They were subsequently widely adopted in other parts of Europe (Schuhmacher 2002), possibly showing a change in the technology of warfare.|$|E
25|$|Different {{armament}} {{was used}} by infantry, which marched onto the battlefield in close order formations of shield-bearers covering heavy cavalry detachments, or mobile units of bowmen and cross-bowmen, and sometimes irregulars, who used different weapons specialized to fight both foot soldiers and cavalry: (war hammer, war scythe, glaive, fork, flail, morgenstern, guisarme, <b>halberd,</b> bardiche). Defensive armaments of the infantry consisted of shields (wooden, round or oval, through light bucklers, up to heavy pavises), quilted jackets and gambesons or brigandines. A characteristic helmet of the foot soldier was the kettle hat - an iron hat with board brim. Earlier infantry units wore conical helmets, later sallets, but more often thick felt caps. Camp followers were used mainly for field work and sometimes to defend fortified camps or trains. Their armament was simple and coincidental.|$|E
25|$|After {{his arrival}} at Cheb, however, certain senior Scottish and Irish {{officers}} in his force assassinated {{him on the}} night of February 25. To carry out the assassination, a regiment of dragoons under the command of an Irish colonel, Walter Butler and the Scots colonels Walter Leslie and John Gordon first fell upon Wallenstein's trusted officers Adam Trczka, Vilém Kinsky, Christian Illov and Henry Neumann while the latter attended a feast at Cheb Castle (which had come under the command of Gordon himself), and massacred them. Trczka alone managed to fight his way out into the courtyard, only to be shot down by a group of musketeers. A few hours later, an Irish captain, Walter Devereux, together with a few companions, broke into the burgomaster's house at the main square where Wallenstein had his lodgings (again courtesy of Gordon), and kicked open the bedroom door. Devereux then ran his <b>halberd</b> through the unarmed Wallenstein, who, roused from sleep, is said to have asked in vain for quarter.|$|E
