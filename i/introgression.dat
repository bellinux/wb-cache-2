5|$|There {{is a kind}} of {{continuum}} {{with three}} semi-distinct categories dealing with anthropogenic hybridization: hybridization without <b>introgression,</b> hybridization with widespread <b>introgression</b> (backcrossing with one of the parent species), and hybrid swarms (highly variable populations with much interbreeding as well as backcrossing with the parent species). Depending on where a population falls along this continuum, the management plans for that population will change. Hybridization is currently an area of great discussion within wildlife management and habitat management. Global climate change is creating other changes such as difference in population distributions which are indirect causes for an increase in anthropogenic hybridization.|$|E

Here, we introduced an approach in identifying <b>introgressions</b> from all possible archaic hominins in Eurasian genomes, without referring to archaic hominin sequences. We focused on mutations emerged in archaic hominins after their divergence from modern humans (denoted as archaic-specific mutations), and identified introgressive segments which showed significant enrichment of archaic-specific mutations {{over the rest}} of the genome. Furthermore, boundaries of <b>introgressions</b> were identified using a dynamic programming approach to partition whole genome into segments which contained different levels of archaic-specific mutations. We found that detected <b>introgressions</b> shared more archaic-specific mutations with Altai Neanderthal than they shared with Denisovan, and 60. 3 % of archaic hominin <b>introgressions</b> were from Neanderthals. Furthermore, we detected more <b>introgressions</b> from two unknown archaic hominins whom diverged with modern humans approximately 859 and 3, 464 thousand years ago. The latter unknown archaic hominin contributed to the genomes of the common ancestors of modern humans and Neanderthals. In total, archaic hominin <b>introgressions</b> comprised 2. 4 % of Eurasian genomes. Above results suggested a complex admixture history among hominins.

To explore the genetic potential of O. latifolia as a novel genetic resource for the improvement of existing O. sativa cultivars, 27 disomic derivatives of O. latifolia monosomic alien addition lines (MAAL) were characterized for alien chromosome segment <b>introgressions</b> and evaluated for yield components, BB resistance, and strong stem characteristics.

40|$|Genetic {{diversity}} of crop species in sub-Sahelian Africa is still poorly documented. Among such crops, pearl millet {{is one of}} the most important staple species. In Niger, pearl millet covers more than 65 % of the total cultivated area. Analyzing pearl millet genetic diversity, its origin and its dynamics is important for in situ and ex situ germplasm conservation and to increase knowledge useful for breeding programs. We developed new genetic markers and a high-throughput technique for the genetic analysis of pearl millet. Using 25 microsatellite markers, we analyzed genetic diversity in 46 wild and 421 cultivated accessions of pearl millet in Niger.

5|$|A {{study in}} 2009 of seven {{mitochondrial}} genes (mtDNA) and three nuclear genes grouped fork-marked lemurs with sportive lemurs (family Lepilemuridae), offering {{a host of}} explanations, such as a possible hybridization (<b>introgression)</b> following the initial split between the families. A study published in 2013 also grouped fork-marked lemurs with sportive lemurs when it used 43morphological traits and mtDNA. If correct, this would make the family Cheirogaleidae paraphyletic. Broad agreement between two lemur phylogeny studies—one in 2004 using SINE analysis and another in 2012 using multilocus phylogenetic tests—gave strong support for a sister group relationship between fork-marked lemurs {{and the rest of}} the cheirogaleids and a more distant relationship with sportive lemurs.

40|$|In most crosses between {{closely related}} species of Drosophila, the male hybrids are sterile and show postmeiotic abnormalities. A series of gene {{expression}} studies using genomic approaches have found significant down regulation of postmeiotic spermatogenesis genes in sterile male hybrids. These results have led some to suggest a direct relationship between down regulation in gene expression and hybrid sterility. An alternative explanation to a cause-and-effect relationship between misregulation of gene expression and male sterility is rapid divergence of male sex regulatory elements leading to incompatible interactions in an interspecies hybrid genome. To test the effect of regulatory divergence in spermatogenesis gene expression, we isolated 35 fertile D. simulans strains with D. mauritiana <b>introgressions</b> in either the X, second or third chromosome. We analyzed gene expression in these fertile hybrid strains for a subset of spermatogenesis genes previously reported as significantly under expressed in sterile hybrids relative to D. simulans.

5|$|Fire {{response}} {{may also}} furnish {{an explanation for}} the evolution of this species. The differences in fire regime between dune crests and swales would have created different evolutionary pressures, with plants on crests adapting to frequent hot fires by becoming strongly serotinous, and plants in swales adapting to patchier, cooler fires with weaker serotiny. Speciation would be made possible by the much reduced genetic exchange between crest plants and swale plants, although evidence suggests that there was some <b>introgression</b> at first. Eventually, however, the need for weakly serotinous plants to produce ripe seed by the bushfire season would have brought forward its flowering season until the flowering seasons no longer overlapped; thus a phenological barrier to exchange was erected, allowing the two populations to drift independently of each other.|$|E
5|$|Purebred {{wild species}} evolved to a {{specific}} ecology can be threatened with extinction {{through the process of}} genetic pollution, the uncontrolled hybridization, <b>introgression</b> genetic swamping which leads to homogenization or out-competition from the heterosic hybrid species. When new populations are imported or selectively bred by people, or when habitat modification brings previously isolated species into contact, extinction in some species, especially rare varieties, is possible. Interbreeding can swamp the rarer gene pool and create hybrids, depleting the purebred gene pool. For example, the endangered wild water buffalo is most threatened with extinction by genetic pollution from the domestic water buffalo. Such extinctions are not always apparent from a morphological standpoint. Some degree of gene flow is a normal evolutionary process, nevertheless, hybridization threatens the existence of rare species.|$|E
