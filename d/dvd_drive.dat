25|$|Announced at CES 2006 {{and first}} {{publicly}} shown at E3 2006, an external HD <b>DVD</b> <b>drive</b> {{was released in}} North America on November 7, 2006 (for US$199.99) and in Japan on November 17, 2006 (for ¥19,800). In the UK, France and Germany, the HD <b>DVD</b> <b>drive</b> was released for €199.99/£129.99. The HD <b>DVD</b> <b>drive</b> was bundled for a limited time with an Xbox 360 Universal Media Remote, {{as well as a}} HD DVD copy of Peter Jackson's King Kong. The drive plays HD DVD movies, although all Xbox 360 games will remain on the DVD format. Microsoft had no plans to include an internal HD DVD player in future Xbox 360 designs. The drive connects to the Xbox 360 via USB and contains two integrated USB ports on the rear. Games can not be played on the HD <b>DVD</b> <b>drive.</b>|$|E
25|$|Bill Gates {{announced}} {{during his}} keynote speech at CES 2006 that an external HD <b>DVD</b> <b>drive</b> {{would be released}} for the Xbox 360 during 2006. At E3 2006, Microsoft officially presented the external HD <b>DVD</b> <b>drive.</b> According to Japan's chief of Xbox operations, Yoshihiro Maruyama, Microsoft will not release Xbox 360 games in the new disc formats.|$|E
25|$|Special black {{versions}} of the drive, along with black media remotes, were given {{to members of the}} Xbox 360 HD DVD development team. Unlike other black accessories which were created alongside the black Elite console, the black HD <b>DVD</b> <b>drive</b> was never made available to the general public.|$|E
50|$|His {{first victory}} came on 25 May, {{destroying}} an Albatros D.V over Albert. On 18 June he claimed a Fokker Dr.I {{set on fire}} and also an Albatros <b>D.V</b> <b>driven</b> down out of control while over Morcourt. On 2 July he drove down a Pfalz D.III at Bayonvillers, bringing his score to four. On 19 July Brookes was promoted to the temporary rank of captain while serving as a flight commander.|$|R
50|$|Davison was a Bristol F.2 Fighter pilot {{assigned}} to 22 Squadron when he scored his first aerial victory on 6 March 1918. With observer/gunner Josiah Lewis Morgan manning the {{guns in the}} rear seat of the two-seated fighter, Davison drove a German Albatros D.V down out of control over Douai. Morgan and Davison would remain teamed for ten more victories. The next three came on 8 March, with two more Albatros <b>D.Vs</b> <b>driven</b> {{out of control and}} a Pfalz D.III destroyed. On 13 March 1918, they set a Pfalz D.III afire over Annoeullin. From 25 through 29 March, they downed six more enemy planes. Davison's final tally was five enemy planes destroyed, and six driven down out of control. Davison was wounded in action on 13 April 1918.|$|R
25|$|Effective 15 July 1916, Cunningham was {{appointed}} a squadron commander, with the concomitant rank of temporary major. He would not score his next victories until 18 December 1917, {{when he was}} apparently commanding 65 Squadron. He became an ace flying a Sopwith Camel fighter to destroy one German Albatros <b>D.V</b> fighter and <b>drive</b> another down out of control.|$|R
25|$|The drive {{will play}} {{standard}} DVDs {{in addition to}} HD DVD titles; however it will not read Xbox or Xbox 360 game discs, Audio CDs or mixed media CDs. All Xbox 360 games continue to use DVD-9 media. No Xbox 360 with a built-in HD <b>DVD</b> <b>drive</b> was ever released.|$|E
25|$|Early {{production}} runs of the Xbox 360 {{are equipped with}} a 12x <b>DVD</b> <b>drive,</b> capable of a maximum read rate of 15.85MB/s. The original production DVD drives were manufactured by both LG and Toshiba. Beginning in November 2006, a new model the BenQ VAD6038 was introduced, which is said to run faster than the previous models and, in addition, is much quieter. There is a new drive by LiteOn.|$|E
25|$|The PS2 {{consisted}} of a <b>DVD</b> <b>drive</b> and retailed in the U.S. for US$299. SCEI received heavy criticism after {{the launch of the}} PS2 due to the games released as part of the launch, difficulties that it presented for video game designers, and users who struggled to port Sega Dreamcast games to the system. However, despite these complaints, the PlayStation 2 received widespread support from third party developers throughout its lifespan on the market.|$|E
50|$|Kirkman {{served in}} the Honourable Artillery Company, Territorial Force, as a private before being {{commissioned}} as a temporary second lieutenant in the Leicestershire Regiment on 12 December 1915. He was seconded to the Royal Flying Corps, and appointed a flying officer, transferred to the General List, on 14 February 1917, and promoted to lieutenant on 1 June. Posted to No. 20 Squadron, flying the Bristol F.2b fighter, between 11 September 1917 and 23 March 1918 Kirkman was credited with eight aerial victories, all against Albatros <b>D.Vs,</b> with five <b>driven</b> down out of control, and three set on fire and destroyed. On 18 December 1917 he was appointed a flight commander with the temporary rank of captain.|$|R
40|$|Plasmodium falciparum is an {{intracellular}} protozoan parasite {{that has}} been associated with humans since the dawn of time and causes severe forms of malaria. It is a major health problem around the globe and causes highest toll of death among children less than five years of age in developing countries. An infected female Anopheles mosquito injects malaria sporozoites into the skin while taking a blood meal. The sporozoites, which are released into the blood stream, reaches the liver where they undergo exoerythrocytic schizogony. After exoerythrocytic schizogony, millions of merozoites are released into the blood stream and infect new red blood cells, where they undergo erythrocytic schizogony in a cyclic manner. The erythrocytic schizogony stage of Plasmodium life cycle is where all clinical manifestations of malaria as a disease become apparent. The clinical symptoms like fever, headache, jaundice, vomiting have been associated with hyperparasitemia and these clinical symptoms coincide with the cyclical release of malaria parasites during schizonts rupture. A severe form of malaria develops as a consequence of capillaric sequestration of parasitized red blood cells (pRBC) and rosetting of pRBC with uninfected red blood cells which obstruct the blood flow to the brain. Activation of complement and coagulation, and increase in vascular permeability further aggravates severity of the disease which can lead to microcirculatory disturbances with comatous death as the ultimate outcome. Rupture of each Plasmodium falciparum infected red blood cell releases 8 - 32 infective merozoites along with a single digestive vacuole into the blood stream. The released digestive vacuole is an organelle in which hemozoin is surrounded by an intact membrane. We have discovered that the digestive vacuoles have the capacity to dually activate the complement and coagulation systems. Activation of complement and coagulation requires an intact DV membrane. The complement and coagulation activating properties of the DV are inhibited by low molecular weight dextran sulfate. In non-immune serum, DVs are opsonised with complement C 3 b and rapidly phagocytosed by polymorphonuclear granulocytes (PMN). Upon rupture, DVs lost its functional activities and the extracted malaria pigment from the DV organelle is not engulfed by the PMN. Liberated merozoites are not opsonized in non-immune serum and escape phagocytosis. High titered anti-malarial antibodies from immune patients mediate some uptake of the merozoites, but to an extent that is not sufficient to markedly reduce re-invasion rates. Engulfment of DVs by PMN induces a respiratory burst, but the generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) are unable to suppress the infective capacity of invading merozoites. Finally, ingested <b>DVs</b> <b>drive</b> the PMN into a state of functional exhaustion. Upon challenging of PMN with bacteria after DV ingestion, the ability to phagocytose bacteria prevails, but their capacity to mount a respiratory burst is reduced and microbicidal activity is compromised. We propose that these events might be linked to the development of septicemic episodes in patients with severe malaria in sub-Saharan African countries...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the psychometric {{properties}} of diabetic retinopathy (DR) and diabetic macular edema (DME) quality-of-life (QoL) item banks and determine the utility of the final calibrated item banks by simulating a computerized adaptive testing (CAT) application. Methods: In this clinical, cross-sectional study, 514 participants with DR/DME (mean age ± SD, 60. 4 ± 12. 6 years; 64 % male) answered 314 items grouped under nine QoL item pools: Visual Symptoms (SY); Ocular Comfort Symptoms (OS); Activity Limitation (AL); Mobility (MB); Emotional (EM); Health Concerns (HC); Social (SC); Convenience (CV); and Economic (EC). The psychometric properties of the item pools were assessed using Rasch analysis, and CAT simulations determined the average number of items administered at high and moderate precision levels. Results: The SY, MB, EM, and HC item pools required minor amendments, mainly involving removal of six poorly worded, highly misfitting items. AL and CV required substantial modification to resolve multidimensionality, which resulted in two new item banks: <b>Driving</b> (<b>DV)</b> and Lighting (LT). Due to unresolvable psychometric issues, the OS, SC, and EC item pools were not pursued further. This iterative process resulted in eight operational item banks that underwent CAT simulations. Correlations between CAT and the full item banks were high (range, 0. 88 - 0. 99). On average, only 3. 6 and 7. 2 items were required to gain measurement at moderate and high precision, respectively. Conclusions: Our eight psychometrically robust and efficient DR/DME item banks will enable researchers and clinicians to accurately assess the impact and effectiveness of treatment therapies for DR/DME in all areas of QoL.

25|$|The Toshiba SD-L902A for {{notebooks}} {{was one of}} the first available HD DVD writers, although it was not meant for retail. Burning HD DVD (including Dual Layer) with a 1× write speed, it could also burn DVDs and CDs. In a test of the SD-L902A by C't computer magazine with Verbatim discs, the written HD DVD-Rs suffered from high noise levels, as a result, the written discs could not be recognized by the external HD <b>DVD</b> <b>drive</b> of the Xbox 360, though they could be read back by the SD-L902A.|$|E
25|$|The game shipped with version 3189. The first update, or patch, to Supreme Commander was version 3217. Released {{shortly after}} the game launch, this update {{included}} game tweaks and balances, {{and a number of}} small bug fixes. Support for the Direct2Drive version of the game was introduced, as well as a minimalist version of the user interface. Version 3220, released on March 5, 2007, notably removed the SecuROM disk checking from the game. This enables the player to run the game without the game DVD in the <b>DVD</b> <b>drive.</b> Polish, Russian, and Chinese localizations were excluded from this change. Version 3223 included bug fixes only. It has been called a 'specific purpose patch' by the developer Gas Powered Games. Update 3251, was a highly anticipated update, mainly because of the plethora of changes relating to the balance between playable factions. A cartographic view of the map was also introduced. Hotfix 3254 solved a few issues discovered shortly after 3251 was released. It was introduced on June 7, 2007. Two weeks after that patch, version 3255 fixed a peer desynchronisation bug, one {{that could be used to}} deceive the rating system (called an exploit in gaming jargon). On July 30, 2007, patch 3260 was released. It included 3 new units, and some bug fixes and tweaks. On October 8, 2007, patch 3269 was released, including one new unit for each faction, and gameplay tweaks. On January 13, 2008 the final update to Supreme Commander was released; Patch 3280 added amBX support to the game.|$|E

500|$|The band {{released}} a touring <b>DVD,</b> <b>Drive</b> Well, Sleep Carefully, in 2005. Copies of the DVD were given away to promote animal rights, {{and the band}} are supporters of the activist group PETA. In early 2006, the band announced the upcoming release of [...] , which features eleven short films inspired by songs from the Plans album, each directed by a different person. The videos were posted {{one at a time}} at the band's website, and the DVD went on sale April 11, 2006. The iTunes Store began selling the videos (formatted for iPod) early on March 28, 2006. Lance Bangs, P.R. Brown, Ace Norton, Jeffrey Brown, Lightborne, Autumn de Wilde, Rob Schrab, Laurent Briet and Monkmus, as well as Aaron Stewart-Ahn, are among directors that have contributed to the project. An episode of MTV2's Subterranean played these videos for the whole hour, plus discussion with members of the band. Death Cab for Cutie made their first appearance at Neil Young's annual Bridge School Benefit, and completed their lengthy 2006 tour of the United States on December 10, 2006, finishing with a show at the KeyArena in Seattle, Washington.|$|E
2500|$|Released {{at the end}} of November 2006, the Microsoft HD <b>DVD</b> <b>drive</b> for the Xbox 360 game-console {{gives the}} Xbox 360 the ability to play HD DVD movies.

2500|$|Nothing in the Red, Yellow or Orange Book {{standards}} prohibits disc reading/writing devices {{from having}} {{the capacity to}} read or write discs beyond the Compact Disc standards. [...] The standards do require discs to meet precise requirements {{in order to be}} called Compact Discs, but the other discs may be called by other names; if this were not true, no <b>DVD</b> <b>drive</b> could legally bear the Compact Disc logo. [...] While disc players and drives may have capabilities beyond the standards, enabling them to read and write nonstandard discs, there is no assurance, in the absence of explicit additional manufacturer specifications beyond normal Compact Disc logo certification, that any particular player or drive will perform beyond the standards at all or consistently. Furthermore, if the same device with no explicit performance specs beyond the Compact Disc logo initially handles nonstandard discs reliably, there is no assurance that it will not later stop doing so, and in that case, there is no assurance that it can be made to do so again by service or adjustment. [...] Therefore, discs with capacities larger than 650 MB, and especially those larger than 700 MB, are less interchangeable among players/drives than standard discs and are not very suitable for archival use, as their readability on future equipment, or even on the same equipment at a future time, is not assured, even under the assumption that the discs will not degrade at all.|$|E
