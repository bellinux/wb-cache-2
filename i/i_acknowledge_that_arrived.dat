This chanter was a boy, and he sang out his hymn is a sort of loud melancholy recitative. He was a long time repeating the Eraun. The first exclamation was repeated four times, the remaining words twice; and the long and piercing note in which he concluded his confession of faith, by twice crying out the word 'hou!' ['At solemn sound of [...] "Alla Hu!"' Giaour, i. 734] still rings in my ears."--Hobhouse's Travels in Albania, i. 95. D'Ohsonn gives the Eraun at full length: [...] "Most high God!

"I am sorry," [...] Lebat went on, not heeding the interruption, [...] "that {{it should}} fall to my lot to {{denounce}} her, for <b>I</b> <b>acknowledge</b> <b>that</b> {{in the days}} before our glorious Revolution commenced I have visited at her father's chateau.
