40|$|ABSTRACT Objective: costs {{auditing}} {{is considered}} fundamental {{for the survival}} of health institutions. Thus, this article aims to investigate the reasons for <b>glosses</b> which occurred in a hospital in São Paulo, capital. Methods: data survey included the <b>glosses</b> identified from its resources, along with a health care operator. Results and Discussion: nine hundred and twenty-one <b>glossed</b> items were found in the analyzed resources, whose total value was of R$ 173, 603. 36. Ninety-one percent of the resources concern administrative <b>glosses</b> and 9 % concern technical <b>glosses.</b> As for the value appealed, around 22 % are accepted. Final results reveal that 75 % of the <b>glosses</b> can be avoided. Conclusion: most {{of the reasons for the}} <b>glosses</b> analyzed concern failures in the patient-care, administrative and paying resources areas. In order to obtain a successful result, it is necessary that the manager perform a critical analysis of the reasons for <b>glosses,</b> thus making people aware of the problems caused by <b>glossing</b> and developing action plans for solving the...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effects of differing densities of <b>glossing</b> on the uptake of target words and the comprehension of idea units from a reading text. The focus was whether different densities of <b>glossing</b> would create trade-off effects. Thirty-three Malaysian ESL learners were assigned to three different conditions: high-density <b>glossing,</b> low-density <b>glossing,</b> and no-glossing. Three weeks after a vocabulary pretest the participants read a text {{under one of the}} conditions, and took a reading comprehension test and a vocabulary posttest. The results revealed that there were no trade-off effects between reading comprehension and uptake of the target words. However, the <b>glossed</b> words did appear to detract from the uptake of un-glossed vocabulary. The results also hinted at a trade-off effect between attention given to idea units containing <b>glossed</b> target words, and those that did not contain <b>glosses.</b> The findings suggested that teachers should be aware of potential side-effects of <b>glossing...</b>|$|R

40|$|This {{quasi-experimental}} {{study examined}} the effects of different <b>glossing</b> conditions on English as a foreign language (EFL) learners’ vocabulary recall. To this end, five <b>glossing</b> conditions were adopted (i. e., inference-gloss-gloss, gloss-retrieval-gloss, inference-gloss-retrieval-gloss, gloss-retrieval-gloss-retrieval, and full <b>glossing).</b> The participants were 140 MA students of Teaching English as a Foreign Language (TEFL). They were randomly assigned to one <b>glossing</b> condition to read an English reading passage. Five target words were <b>glossed</b> in different <b>glossing</b> conditions within a reading passage. To ensure the participants’ attention focused on the reading material, the participants were told that a multiple-choice reading comprehension test would be administrated. Afterward, two vocabulary tests (i. e., form recall and meaning recall) were conducted. The results of one-way MANOVAs and the post hoc Scheffé tests revealed that the full <b>glossing</b> condition group did significantly better than other <b>glossing</b> groups in vocabulary form recall, whereas the gloss-retrieval-gloss-retrieval condition group outperformed other four groups in vocabulary meaning recall...|$|R

5|$|The bill of the {{specimen}} is black with a yellowish tip, and the cere is also black, with feathers {{on the upper}} side, almost to the nostrils. The lores are naked, and {{the upper part of}} the head is sooty black. The rest of the head is mostly brownish-black. The feathers of the nape and the neck are slightly bifurcated and have a dark green <b>gloss,</b> the latter with coppery reflections. The feathers of the neck are elongated (sometimes referred to as hackles), and some of those on the sides and lower part have paler spots near the tips. Most of the feathers on the upperparts and wings are dark brown or brownish-black with a dark green <b>gloss.</b> Almost all of these feathers have a triangular, yellowish-buff spot at their tips. The spots are almost whitish on some of the scapular feathers, vague and dark on the primary feathers. The underside of the wings is black with browner flight feathers, which have a pale spot or band at the tips. The breast is brownish-black with a faint green sheen. The tail is blackish with a dark green sheen, brownish-black on the underside, with a narrow, cinnamon-coloured band at the end. This differs from the rust-coloured tail-tip apparently shown in the drawing owned by Lever, and Latham's own illustration. The legs are small and slender, have long toes, large claws, and a comparatively short tarsus, whereas the Nicobar pigeon has shorter claws and a longer tarsus.|$|E
5|$|Thin {{film with}} diffuse reflector, {{based on the}} top two layers of a buttercup's petals. The {{brilliant}} yellow <b>gloss</b> derives from a combination, rare among plants, of yellow pigment and structural coloration. The very smooth upper epidermis acts as a reflective and iridescent thin film; for example, in Ranunculus acris, the layer is 2.7 micrometres thick. The unusual starch cells form a diffuse but strong reflector, enhancing the flower's brilliance. The curved petals form a paraboloidal dish which directs the sun's heat to the reproductive parts at {{the centre of the}} flower, keeping it some degrees Celsius above the ambient temperature.|$|E
5|$|Æthelwig's {{relationship}} with Wulfstan, when Wulfstan was {{acting as the}} abbot's diocesan bishop, {{appears to have been}} tense, for on the only recorded visitation by Wulfstan to Evesham during Æthelwig's abbacy, Æthelwig was not there. Although in legal matters Wulfstan and Æthelwig were in conflict, personally, Æthelwig is said to have regarded Wulfstan as a father figure, and as the abbot's confessor. The fact that the Evesham's house chronicle appears to have been reworked after 1100 to <b>gloss</b> over embarrassing incidents of the abbots submitting to the bishops of Worcester makes evaluation of Æthelwig's relations with his episcopal superiors more difficult.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the black}} catbird is {{unlikely}} to be mistaken for any other mimid species, there are several other black birds — including the melodious blackbird, the bronzed cowbird and the giant cowbird — that occur within the same range and might conceivably cause confusion. All are birds of more open habitats. The melodious blackbird is larger and longer tailed; it has dark eyes and a stocky bill with an evenly curved culmen. The bronzed cowbird is thicker necked than is the catbird and has a bronzy, rather than purplish or greenish <b>gloss</b> to its plumage; its eye is bright red rather than dark red. The giant cowbird is considerably larger, and is relatively longer tailed and thicker necked than is the catbird.|$|E
5|$|In {{distinguishing}} {{the police}} characters from other television detectives, Simon {{makes the point}} that even the best police of The Wire are motivated not by a desire to protect and serve, but by the intellectual vanity of believing they are smarter than the criminals they are chasing. However, while many of the police do exhibit altruistic qualities, many officers portrayed on the show are incompetent, brutal, self-aggrandizing, or hamstrung by bureaucracy and politics. The criminals are not always motivated by profit or a desire to harm others; many are trapped in their existence and all have human qualities. Even so, The Wire does not minimize or <b>gloss</b> over the horrific effects of their actions.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In our {{paper we}} present a method for the {{automatic}} generation of single German Sign Language <b>glosses</b> from German words. <b>Glosses</b> are often used as a textual description of signs when transcribing Sign Language video data. For a machine translation system from German to German Sign Language we apply <b>glosses</b> as an intermediate notational system. Then the automatic generation from given German words is presented. This novel approach takes the orthographic similarities between <b>glosses</b> and written words into account. The obtained experimental results show the feasibility of our methods for word classes like adverbs, adjectives and verbs with up to 80 % correctly generated <b>glosses.</b> ...|$|R
5|$|Shell colour is variable, from golden {{yellow to}} light yellowish-brown to grey. The {{underside}} of the shell is rarely dark; more frequently it is paler than the top, or totally white. In all cases, the shell aperture is white. Mature specimens sometimes have a metallic-grey or golden-brown <b>gloss</b> on {{the margin of the}} outer lip and the callus. A zigzag network of darker lines is sometimes present {{on the outside of the}} shell. The periostracum, a layer of protein (conchiolin) that is the outermost part of the shell surface, is yellowish-brown. It is usually thick, reticulated (net-like) and fimbriated (fringed) over the suture. The corneous operculum is dark brown, and its shape is fairly typical of the family Strombidae: a slightly bent sickle, with seven to eight weak lateral serrations.|$|E
5|$|Structural {{coloration}} {{is responsible}} for the blues and greens of the feathers of many birds (the bee-eater, kingfisher and roller, for example), as well as many butterfly wings, beetle wing-cases (elytra) and (while rare among flowers) the <b>gloss</b> of buttercup petals. These are often iridescent, as in peacock feathers and nacreous shells such as of pearl oysters (Pteriidae) and Nautilus. This is because the reflected colour depends on the viewing angle, which in turn governs the apparent spacing of the structures responsible. Structural colours can be combined with pigment colours: peacock feathers are pigmented brown with melanin, while buttercup petals have both carotenoid pigments for yellowness and thin films for reflectiveness.|$|E
5|$|The black-throated gray warbler {{has mostly}} black, gray, and white plumage, which is soft, lacking <b>gloss.</b> With its {{striping}} {{and the small}} yellow spot between its eye and bill, it is a distinctive bird. The sexes differ slightly, both having gray upperparts with black streaks, and white underparts with black streaks on the flanks. The adult male is striped with a black on the crown, throat, and below the eye, and has white around its chin and above its eye. The adult female has more dingy plumage on its head, with a white throat and dark gray cheeks. The most similar birds to the black-throated gray warbler are the black-and-white and blackpoll warblers, which although marked in black have entirely different plumage patterns.|$|E

Half of the participants received the passage which included L 2 MC <b>glosses</b> and half of them received the same passage embedding L 1 MC <b>glosses.</b> They were then tested through both immediate and delayed production and recognition posttests. The results indicated that both L 1 - and L 2 -gloss groups significantly outperformed in immediate than in delayed testing condition. However, in both conditions, L 2 <b>glosses</b> produced significantly higher scores than L 1 <b>glosses</b> did suggesting that L 2 <b>glosses</b> far outweigh for fostering learning and retaining target words.

5|$|The most {{acclaimed}} of the neo-noirs {{of the era}} {{was director}} Roman Polanski's 1974 Chinatown. Written by Robert Towne, it is set in 1930s Los Angeles, an accustomed noir locale nudged back some few years {{in a way that}} makes the pivotal loss of innocence in the story even crueler. Where Polanski and Towne raised noir to a black apogee by turning rearward, director Martin Scorsese and screenwriter Paul Schrader brought the noir attitude crashing into the present day with Taxi Driver (1976), a crackling, bloody-minded <b>gloss</b> on bicentennial America. In 1978, Walter Hill wrote and directed The Driver, a chase film as might have been imagined by Jean-Pierre Melville in an especially abstract mood.|$|E
5|$|While {{many animals}} {{are unable to}} {{synthesize}} carotenoid pigments to create red and yellow surfaces, the green and blue colours of bird feathers and insect carapaces are usually not produced by pigments at all, but by structural coloration. Structural coloration means the production of colour by microscopically-structured surfaces fine enough to interfere with visible light, sometimes in combination with pigments: for example, peacock tail feathers are pigmented brown, but their structure makes them appear blue, turquoise and green. Structural coloration can produce the most brilliant colours, often iridescent. For example, the blue/green <b>gloss</b> on the plumage of birds such as ducks, and the purple/blue/green/red colours of many beetles and butterflies are created by structural coloration. Animals use several methods to produce structural colour, {{as described in the}} table.|$|E
