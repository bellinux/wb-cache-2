5|$|Federal judges, when {{interpreting}} the Constitution, frequently use The Federalist Papers as a contemporary {{account of the}} intentions of the framers and ratifiers.

40|$|The {{sharing of}} power and {{responsibilities}} between the individual states and the <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> is detailed <b>in</b> the US Constitution and is called federalism. Research has indicated that the shift of power between the states and <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> has waxed and waned over the last 236 years. This qualitative study is based upon literature review of the relationships of local, state, and <b>federal</b> <b>governments</b> <b>in</b> responding to catastrophes. Each level of government brings unique capabilities to the response to catastrophic events. There {{is no need to}} usurp federalism in order to survive the next catastrophe; {{it is going to take}} all levels of <b>government</b> working together <b>in</b> a collaborative fashion. The aim of this study is to influence policy makers to take a more balanced approach to the roles of local, state, and <b>federal</b> <b>governments</b> <b>in</b> emergency management.

5|$|The {{strike was}} {{triggered}} by {{the decision of the}} Philadelphia Transportation Company (PTC), made under prolonged pressure from the <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>in</b> view of significant labor shortages, to allow black employees of the PTC to hold non-menial jobs, such as motormen and conductors, that were previously reserved for white workers only.

5|$|Biographer Stephen Henderson {{maintains}} that Macdonald {{played a key}} role in the wartime conscription crises that beset the <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>in</b> 1942, and again in 1944, as Prime Minister Mackenzie King tried to avoid imposing compulsory military service overseas. Macdonald himself strongly favoured conscription rather than relying solely on voluntary enlistment. A committed internationalist, he believed it unfair that some bore the sacrifices of overseas service while others escaped what he saw as their military obligations. Macdonald realized however, that conscription was highly unpopular in French-speaking Quebec and that enforcing it would split the country at a time when national unity was crucial. He also recognized that in the early years of the war, voluntary enlistment was producing enough recruits to meet the needs of the armed forces.|$|E
5|$|Hinde was {{an active}} businessman, {{pursuing}} real estate, construction, and publishing opportunities in Kentucky, Ohio and Illinois. In his early years, Hinde publicly opposed slavery. He also used his newspaper, The Fredonian, in Chillicothe, Ohio between 1806 and 1808, to highlight issues about Indian treaties and the conspiracy of Aaron Burr. He served in the War of 1812. In later years he was {{a pioneer in the}} settlement of Indiana and Illinois, and the expansion of the Methodist Church in these areas. He contributed to the Madoc Tradition and was a noted historian and biographer. Hinde cofounded the Wabash Navigation Company, which engaged in real estate speculation and dam construction. The company dammed the Wabash River next to Hinde's property, creating the Grand Rapids Dam. The dam was abandoned by the <b>Federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>in</b> 1931.|$|E
