5|$|Unable {{to remain}} in one place long enough to receive provisions, Black Hawk's group were in poor health {{and some of them}} starved to death on the road. Black Hawk stated in his account of the battle that {{at this point in the}} war <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>every</b> {{intention}} of escaping with his people back across the Mississippi River, but on encountering the large U.S. force at Wisconsin Heights he was left with no choice but to fight. His intention was to allow the non-combatants in his band to escape across the Wisconsin River.|$|E
25|$|Haughey's grip on {{political}} power began to slip {{in the autumn}} of 1991. There was a series of resignations by chairmen of semi-state companies, followed by an open declaration by Minister for Finance Albert Reynolds that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>every</b> intention of standing for the party leadership if Haughey retired. Following a heated parliamentary party meeting Seán Power, one of Reynolds's supporters, put down a motion of no-confidence in Haughey. Reynolds and his supporters were sacked from the government by Haughey, who {{went on to win the}} no-confidence motion by 55 votes to 22.|$|E
500|$|Hollywood {{had shown}} {{interest}} in Welles {{as early as}} 1936. He turned down three scripts sent to him by Warner Bros. In 1937, he declined offers from David O. Selznick, who asked him to head his film company's story department, and William Wyler, who wanted him for a supporting role in Wuthering Heights. [...] "Although the possibility of making {{huge amounts of money}} in Hollywood greatly attracted him," [...] wrote biographer Frank Brady, [...] "he was still totally, hopelessly, insanely in love with the theater, and it is there that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>every</b> intention of remaining to make his mark." ...|$|E

500|$|In his 1978 {{biography}} of Victor Trumper, Fingleton accused Bradman of relating Woodfull's {{words to the}} press. Fingleton claimed that Claude Corbett revealed the information to him. In Fingleton's version of events, Bradman telephoned Corbett during the night to arrange a meeting. Bradman wrote for Corbett's paper, Sydney's Sun. Sitting in Corbett's car, Bradman told the journalist about the Warner–Woodfull incident. Corbett considered the story too important to keep to himself, so shared it with other journalists. Fingleton later added that [...] "Bradman would have saved {{me a lot of}} backlash... had he admitted that he had given the leak. Part of his job was writing for the Sydney Sun and <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>every</b> right to leak such a vital story." ...|$|E
500|$|In a more {{positive}} assessment, for Creem magazine, Mitchell Cohen highlighted the album's second side as [...] "a collection of McCartney performances that string together like abbey roadwork", and praised McCartney's vocals relative to his past work, writing: [...] "all of the current tracks are terser, sung better, have less of what I suppose would be called the recording artist's equivalent of camera consciousness." [...] To NME critic Bob Woffinden, the attempt at an album-wide concept was [...] "a pretty half-baked one" [...] and Hipgnosis' cover photo was [...] "easily the album's strongest point". While identifying the songs as [...] "particularly weak lyrically", Woffinden concluded: [...] "It was the familiar McCartney problem. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>every</b> essential creative requirement, except the discipline required to knead the parts into a perfect whole." ...|$|E
500|$|On July 16, 1999, tragedy {{struck the}} Kennedy family again when [...] John F. Kennedy, Jr.'s [...] Piper Saratoga light {{aircraft}} {{crashed into the}} Atlantic Ocean {{off the coast of}} Martha's Vineyard. The accident killed Kennedy, his wife, and sister-in-law. As patriarch, Ted consoled his extended family along with President Clinton at the public memorial service. He paraphrased William Butler Yeats by saying of his nephew: [...] "We dared to think, in that other Irish phrase, that this John Kennedy would live to comb gray hair, with his beloved Carolyn by his side. But like his father, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>every</b> gift but length of years." [...] Ted now served as a role model for Maria Shriver, Kerry Kennedy Cuomo, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., Joseph Patrick Kennedy II, and other family members. The Boston Globe wrote of the changed role: [...] "It underscored the evolution that surprised so many people who knew the Kennedys: Teddy, the baby of the family, who had grown into a man who could sometimes be dissolute and reckless, had become the steady, indispensable patriarch, the one the family turned to in good times and bad." ...|$|E

2500|$|The appeal {{trial was}} held on 13 January 1931 at the King's Bench Division of the High Court of Justice, in London, and, it was hoped at the time, would settle the status of Lundy once and for all. It didn't – but it did show how utterly {{confused}} the situation was. In his defence, Mr Harman said <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>every</b> right to mint money, for Lundy, in his words, was [...] "a vest-pocket-size, self-governing dominion," [...] {{out of the realm}} for every practical purpose. The Lundy residents, he pointed out, never had paid any taxes to England and were liable to customs when they went there, for Lundy itself was a free port. The Attorney General, who was prosecuting Mr Harman, said that Lundy was surely a Utopia but that its inhabitants would be just as happy if the face of King George V, rather than of Mr Harman, were depicted on the place's currency. (Mr Harman's face was {{on the front of the}} coins, and that of a puffin on the back. There were two denominations, a one-puffin coin and a half-puffin coin, neatly convertible to a penny and a ha'penny at the legal rate of exchange.|$|E
2500|$|His {{coach at}} Barcelona, Bobby Robson, commented: [...] "He was the fastest thing I've ever seen {{running with the}} ball. Had he managed to stay free of injury, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>every</b> chance of {{becoming}} the best footballer ever", while Lionel Messi states: [...] "He was the best striker I've ever seen. He was so fast he could score from nothing, and could shoot the ball better than anyone." [...] Ronaldinho called Ronaldo [...] "the most complete striker there has ever been." [...] Ronaldo was also a strong and powerful player who could shield the ball from the opposition, with former Italian defender Alessandro Nesta (who faced Ronaldo in a high-profile one on one duel in the 1998 UEFA Cup final) stating: [...] "Ronaldo is the hardest attacker I've ever had to face. He was impossible to stop." [...] With his quick reactions and anticipation, he regularly beat defenders to the ball, and as a finisher he was effective with his head, and could finish well {{both inside and outside}} the penalty area. In addition to these attributes, Ronaldo was an accurate free-kick and penalty kick taker. At his physical peak in the 1990s, Ronaldo later became severely affected by serious knee injuries he would suffer from late 1999 onward and the subsequent weight gain during his inactivity, which limited his speed, fitness, and mobility.|$|E
2500|$|Rundstedt had {{resisted}} {{all attempts}} to recruit him to the various conspiracies against Hitler that had been operating inside the German Army since 1938. Although he had not denounced or reported any of the officers who had approached him, he had shown no sympathy with their appeals. By June 1944 the conspirators {{had given up on}} him (and indeed on all the senior field commanders), because he was not approached by the group around Tresckow and Stauffenberg who hatched the unsuccessful plot to kill Hitler with a bomb at the Wolf's Lair (Wolfsschanze), his headquarters in East Prussia, and had no inkling of what was planned. When he heard of the attempt on 20 July, his reaction was very hostile. A year later, in June 1945, he told the investigating commission preparing for the Nuremberg Trials: [...] "I would never have thought of such a thing, that would have been base, bare-faced treachery." [...] Since <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>every</b> reason to try to put himself in a sympathetic light at Nuremberg, this certainly reflects his view in June 1944. He also argued, however, that the attempt to kill Hitler was pointless, because the German Army and people would not have followed the conspirators. [...] "The Army and also the people still believed in Hitler at that time, and such an overthrow would have been quite unsuccessful." [...] He reiterated his traditional sense of his duty as a soldier: had he supported the plot, he said, [...] "I would have emerged and been considered for all time the greatest traitor to my Fatherland." ...|$|E
