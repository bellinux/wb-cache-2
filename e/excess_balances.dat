We're going to experiment with this and try to find what the right spread is." [...] The Fed adjusted the rate on October 22, after the initial rate they set October 6 failed to keep the benchmark U.S. overnight interest rate close to their policy target, and again on November 5 for the same reason.

In practice, the federal funds rate has fallen somewhat below the interest rate on reserves in recent months, reflecting the very high volume of excess reserves, the inexperience of banks with the new regime, and other factors. However, as excess reserves decline, financial conditions normalize, and banks adapt to the new regime, we expect the interest rate paid on reserves to become an effective instrument for controlling the federal funds rate." ...|$|E

40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Annual revenues into the Assets Forfeiture Fund (AFF) from forfeited assets increased from $ 500 million in 2003 to $ 1. 8 billion in 2011, {{in part due to}} an increase in prosecutions of fraud and financial crimes cases. Expenditures in support of forfeiture activities such as equitable sharing payments to state and local law enforcement agencies and payments to victims also increased over the same 9 -year period, growing from $ 458 million in 2003 to $ 1. 3 billion in 2011. The Department of Justice (DOJ) uses the difference between revenues and expenditures in any year to help cover anticipated expenses in the next fiscal year. Because the AFF uses fund revenues to pay for the expenses associated with forfeiture activities, DOJ carries over funds {{at the end of each}} fiscal year to ensure it has sufficient resources to cover expenses that may not be covered by the next years revenues. When determining the amounts to carry over, DOJ reviews historical data on past program expenditures, analyzes known future expenses such as salaries and contracts, and estimates the costs of any potential new expenditures. However, DOJ has not documented the process for determining the amount of funds needed to cover anticipated expenditures in the next fiscal year in its annual budget justifications. Providing more transparent information as part of the AFFs annual budget process would better inform Congress oversight of the AFF. Further, after DOJ obligates funds needed to cover program expenses, any remaining AFF funds identified at the end of a fiscal year may be declared an <b>excess</b> unobligated <b>balance.</b> DOJ has the authority to use these balances for any of the departments authorized purposes. Per Office of Management and Budget guidance, in recent years, DOJ used these <b>excess</b> unobligated <b>balances</b> to help cover rescissions. Rescissions cancel the availability of DOJs previously enacted budget authority, making the funds involved no longer available for obligation. For example, in fiscal year 2011, DOJ used <b>excess</b> unobligated <b>balances</b> to help cover a $ 495 million AFF program rescission. ...|$|R

The Action programmes entail various means of reducing the risks of the pollution of water by nitrate: (a) struggle against nitrate losses in fields using a range of good agricultural practices, including certain restrictions on the use of fertilisers (quantities, spreading periods, soil conditions, etc.), (b) keeping a balance on each farm between the organic nitrogen produced and spreading capacities on agricultural land, (c) adapting storehouses for livestock effluent to a capacity of 6 months and (d) promoting transfers of livestock effluent between farms in <b>excess</b> <b>balance</b> and farms which still have a way of using it on their land. The paper presents the principle of “soil nitrate residue” measurements (APL in French) that permits a yearly monitoring of the farming practices and constitutes a self-evaluation tool for the farmers.

Following the first comparison exercise, these tools are consistent and complementary approaches to help farmers and authorities in nitrogen management.

50|$|The {{mechanisms}} by which excess money might be translated into inflation are examined below. Individuals can also spend their <b>excess</b> money <b>balances</b> directly on goods and services. This has {{a direct impact on}} inflation by raising aggregate demand. Also, the increase in the demand for labour resulting from higher demands for goods and services will cause a rise in money wages and unit labour costs. The more inelastic the aggregate supply in the economy, the greater the impact on inflation. The increase in demand for goods and services may cause a rise in imports. Although this leakage from the domestic economy reduces the money supply, it also increases the supply of money on the foreign exchange market thus applying downward pressure on the exchange rate. This may cause imported inflation.|$|R
