60|$|<b>I</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>at</b> his subtle flattery; {{possibly}} it {{was only}} meant in payment of the rum I had treated him to, but it pleased me none the less, and to his other mental traits I was now inclined to add a marvellous skill in reading character.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>at</b> Bessie's frank answer: I {{felt that}} it was correct, but I confess I was not quite {{indifferent}} to its import: at eighteen most people wish to please, and the conviction that they have not an exterior likely to second that desire brings anything but gratification.|$|E

60|$|Yet with {{a strange}} {{evanescent}} anger, I had not sat {{an hour on the}} edge of my bed, picturing and repicturing his look, manner, words ere <b>I</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>at</b> the whole scene.

60|$|Late {{last night}} I walked along Commercial Street from Spitalfields to Whitechapel, and still {{continuing}} south, down Leman Street to the docks.
