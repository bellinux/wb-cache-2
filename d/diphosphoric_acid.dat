50|$|Triphosphoric acid (also tripolyphosphoric acid), with formula H5P3O10, is a {{condensed}} form of phosphoric acid. In {{the family}} of phosphoric acids, it is the next polyphosphoric acid after pyrophosphoric acid, H4P2O7, also called <b>diphosphoric</b> <b>acid.</b>|$|E
50|$|Pyrophosphoric acid, {{also known}} {{under the name}} <b>diphosphoric</b> <b>acid,</b> is colorless, odorless, {{hygroscopic}} and is soluble in water, diethyl ether, and ethyl alcohol. The anhydrous acid has two different forms, which melt at 54.3 °C and 71.5 °C. It is best prepared by ion exchange from sodium pyrophosphate or by reacting hydrogen sulfide with lead pyrophosphate. When phosphoric acid is dehydrated pyrophosphoric acid is produced {{as one of the}} products. When molten, pyrophosphoric acid rapidly forms an equilibrium mixture of phosphoric acid, pyrophosphoric acid and polyphosphoric acids. The percentage by weight of pyrophosphoric acid is around 40% {{and it is difficult to}} recrystallise from the melt. In aqueous solution pyrophosphoric acid like all polyphosphoric acids hydrolyses and eventually an equilibrium is established between phosphoric acid pyrophosphoric acid and polyphosphoric acids. When highly diluted, an aqueous solution of pyrophosphoric acid contains only phosphoric acid.|$|E
40|$|We {{propose that}} the most {{sophisticated}} strategy for primary biosurveillance is to exploit structural commonality through the detection of biologically relevant phosphoric substances. A novel assay, an artificial-enzyme membrane was designed and synthesized for sensor fabrication. This artificial-enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of the <b>diphosphoric</b> <b>acid</b> anhydride structure. This structure-selective, albeit not molecule-selective, catalytic hydrolysis was successfully coupled with amperometric detection. Since the catalytic reaction produces a dephosphorylation product (PO 43 −), it can be reduced by an electrode potential of − 250 mV vs. Ag/AgCl. Owing to the structural selectivity of the artificial-enzyme membrane, the sensor can detect biological phosphoric substances comprehensively that have the <b>diphosphoric</b> <b>acid</b> anhydride structure. The sensor successfully determined various biological phosphoric substances at concentrations in the micromolar (µM) to millimolar (mM) range, and it showed good functional stability and reproducibility in terms of sensor responses. This sensor was used to detect Escherichia coli lysed by heat treatment, and the response increased with increasing bacterial numbers. This unique technique for analyzing molecular commonality {{can be applied to}} the surveillance of biocontaminants, e. g. microorganisms, spores and viruses. Artificial-enzyme-based detection is a novel strategy for practical biosurveillance in the front line...|$|E
50|$|There {{are various}} kinds of phosphoric acids and phosphates. Of the many {{phosphorus}} oxoacids, the phosphoric acids constitute {{the largest and most}} diverse group. The simplest phosphoric acid series begins with monophosphoric (orthophosphoric) acid, continues with many oligophosphoric <b>acids</b> such as <b>diphosphoric</b> (pyrophosphoric) <b>acid</b> and concludes in the polyphosphoric acids. But, phosphoric acid units can bind together into rings or cyclic structures, chains (catenas), or branched structures, with various combinations possible. Each of these can form phosphates (salts or esters of phosphoric acids).|$|R

40|$|<b>Diphosphoric</b> <b>acid</b> (H_ 4 P_ 2 O_ 7) is {{the first}} {{condensation}} product of phosphoric acid (H_ 3 PO_ 4), the compound with the highest intrinsic proton conductivity in the liquid state. It exists at higher temperature (T > 200 °C) and lower relative humidity (RH ≈ 0. 01 %) and shows significant ionic conductivity under these conditions. In this work, ab initio molecular dynamics simulations of a pure H_ 4 P_ 2 O_ 7 model system and NMR spectroscopy on nominal H_ 4 P_ 2 O_ 7 (which contains significant amounts of ortho- and triphosphoric acid in thermodynamic equilibrium) were performed to reveal the nature and underlying mechanisms of the ionic conductivity. The central oxygen of the molecule {{is found to be}} excluded from any hydrogen bonding, which has two interesting consequences: (i) compared to H_ 3 PO_ 4, the acidity of H_ 4 P_ 2 O_ 7 is severely increased, and (ii) the condensation reaction only leads to a minor decrease in hydrogen bond network frustration, which is thought {{to be one of the}} features enabling high proton conductivity. A topological analysis of diphosphoric acid’s hydrogen bond network shows remarkable similarities to that of phosphonic acid (H_ 3 PO_ 3). The hydrogen bonding facilitates protonic polarization fluctuations (Zundel polarization) extending over several molecules (Grotthuss chains), the other important ingredient for efficient structural diffusion of protons. At T = 160 °C, this is estimated to make a conductivity contribution of about 0. 1 S/cm, which accounts for half of the total ionic conductivity (σ ≈ 0. 2 S/cm). The other half is suggested to result from diffusion of charged phosphate species (vehicle mechanism) that are present in high concentration, resembling conduction in ionic liquids...|$|E
