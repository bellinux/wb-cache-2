The TBM 900 model features automatic torque limiting for “set and forget” power management, which is of particularly use during takeoffs; according to Aviation Week, while this function does reduce the high workload associated with managing the PT6A engine, it is not as capable as a full FADEC arrangement.|$|E
2500|$|The Gulfstream II is a twin-jet {{swept wing}} {{corporate}} transport powered by two Rolls-Royce Spey turbofan engines {{and designed to}} provide high speed and long range capability without sacrificing the airport performance, reliability, and other operational advantages of its predecessor, the turboprop Gulfstream I. Preliminary design of the wing was influenced by both cruise and low speed considerations. The aft-mounted engine location was selected after extensive analysis and design iterations considering aerodynamic, structural, and ground clearance requirements. Airfoil geometry was developed to maximum sweep benefit from the selected planform. [...] The interference problem at the wing-body juncture was treated by modification of the airfoil shape and thickness over the inner third of the wing span. The basic airfoils for the main area of the wing {{are similar to those}} of the Grumman A-6 Intruder aircraft and utilize NACA 6-series thickness distributions combined with an in-house mean line. A buffet boundary commensurate with the M=.85 speed capability was attained by incorporating a row of co-rotating vortex generators on the outer wing panel. In developing the wing contours, attention was paid to the aircraft's low speed requirements by tailoring the leading edge radius to preclude leading edge separation. The high lift configuration, consists of a one piece, single-slotted <b>Fowler</b> <b>flap</b> of 30% chord. [...] Stall initiation on the basic wing was found to occur at midspan but spread rapidly to the tip, particularly at large flap deflections. The addition of an upper surface fence at about midspan provided a strong pitch down at the stall, without sacrificing maximum lift, and also afforded an adequate margin between initial and tip stall.|$|E

50|$|The results {{indicate}} that the best venetian-blind flap arrangement tested was only slightly better aerodynamically than the best comparable arrangement of the preliminary investigation (reported in NACA Report No. 689, 1940). The multiple-slat flaps did not give significantly higher lift coefficients than the single-slat (<b>Fowler)</b> <b>flap</b> and gave considerably greater pitching-moment coefficients.

50|$|An {{investigation}} {{was made in}} the NACA 7x10 feet wind tunnel of a NACA 23012 airfoil with 30%-chord venetian-blind flaps having one, two, three and four slats of Clark Y section. The three-slat arrangement was aerodynamically the best of those tested but showed practically no improvement over the comparable arrangement used in the preliminary tests published in NACA Report No. 689. The multiple-slat flaps gave slightly higher lift coefficients than the one-slat (<b>Fowler)</b> <b>flap</b> but gave considerably greater pitching-moment coefficients. An analysis of test data indicates that substitution of a thicker and more cambered section for the Clark Y slats should improve the aerodynamic and the structural characteristics of the venetian-blind flap.|$|E

50|$|The {{structure}} of the aircraft was Alclad aluminium alloy. The wing was designed in sections, so that alternative engines (Taurus) or armament could be accommodated. <b>Fowler</b> <b>flaps</b> were fitted for take-off/landing. Spoiler flaps were fitted to improve performance.|$|R
50|$|Its unusual {{feature is}} its ability to vary its wing area using <b>Fowler</b> <b>flaps.</b> It had been tried before by the Hannover Akaflieg in 1938 with their AFH-4, the South African Beatty-Johl BJ-2 Assegai and the SZD Zefir gliders.|$|R

5000|$|Construction of the SZD-40 Halny uses mixed materials, with a fibeglass {{laminated}} forward fuselage, {{welded steel}} tube centre-section truss, rolled aluminum tube rear fuselage boom and fibreglass laminate tail section.The wings, extended to 20m span by adding extensions {{to the roots}} using a section substantially modified from the Zefir 4's original NACA 66 216 416, were constructed from plywood, pressure moulded in concrete moulds {{and covered with a}} layer of glass-fibre, to give a very smooth and accurate finish. [...] Another meaningful modification from the original Zefir series wing was a change from Fowler (wing loading decreasing) flaps to camber increasing slotless flaps. This (flap) modification was a definite departure from previous (Zefir) attempts in variable wing geometry glider design. Notes by Eng. Jerzy Śmielkiewicz suggest that this was due to realisation that a laminar flow could not be sustained over the wing with (high speed retracted configuration) <b>Fowler</b> <b>flap</b> mechanism.|$|E
5000|$|Problems {{arising from}} the {{requirement}} to dive-bomb at up to 60° were never satisfactorily solved, due to the constant increases in loaded weight. Despite strengthened airframes, {{it was possible to}} overstress the airframe during dive-bombing. Although the German bomb-sights of the 1930s were inadequate, the later versions of the Lotfernrohr 7 proved to be comparable to the American Norden bombsight. With the introduction of the Lotfe 7, which offered an error of 20 - 30 m from a release altitude of 3000 - 4000 m and Hermann Göring's rescinding of the dive-attack requirement on 15 September 1942, the barred-gate type dive brakes on the wing's lower surfaces, placed just forward of each of the outboard ends of the <b>Fowler</b> <b>flap</b> panels, were omitted from all He 177As built after the initial A-0 pre-production batch. A photo of one of the 12 [...] "destroyer" [...] He 177A-1/U2, heavy-cannon-armed test airframes, showed the retracted dive brake panel still fitted on the undersurface of the outer starboard wing.|$|E
5000|$|NACA {{launched}} an extensive investigation of various wing-flap combinations for improving {{safety and performance}} in flight. One promising combination was a venetian-blind flap, which produced higher lift coefficients, and lower drag coefficients at moderately high lift coefficients, than any flap previously tested. A further development of this arrangement appeared promising, using a 30%-chord flap (or group of flaps), hinged at {{the trailing edge of}} the basic airfoil.The basic airfoil was constructed to the NACA 23012 profile, with a chord of 3 feet and a span of 7 feet, from laminated mahogany and tempered wallboard, with a steel trailing-edge plate. The cutout which had been made in the airfoil to accommodate the retracted <b>Fowler</b> <b>flap</b> was retained; thus the lower surface was not smooth leading into the new flap area, but contained a gap or recess.All the slats were made of wood, shaped to the Clark Y profile. They were secured to the wing with four sets of slat-hinge fittings located spanwise to produce minimum slat bending deflection. Each slat required a separate set of hinge fittings.The combinations tested were: ...|$|E
5000|$|Flap: a hinged {{aerodynamic}} surface, {{usually on}} the trailing edge, which is rotated downwards to generate extra lift and drag. Types include plain, slotted, and split. Some, such as <b>Fowler</b> <b>Flaps,</b> also extend rearwards to increase wing area. The Krueger flap is a leading-edge device.|$|R
50|$|Goodhart set up {{the project}} in 1966 to develop a glider called Sigma {{to compete in the}} 1970 World Championship Open class. After {{problems}} during production and then with its <b>Fowler</b> <b>flaps,</b> the only prototype flew in 1971. In a modified form the Sigma is still flying.|$|R
50|$|The wing had two spars {{with two}} wing fences ranging the entire chord, with {{hydraulically}} operated ailerons and <b>Fowler</b> <b>flaps.</b> The air intake {{was at the}} bow and was centrally divided by a central web. At the rear, two-start rockets were mounted and also two air brakes.|$|R
50|$|To achieve long range, the {{aircraft}} {{was designed for}} efficient cruising with the engines at half power. This required careful streamlining, both for the shaping of the fuselage and also for careful surface finishing. Induced drag was reduced by {{the small size of}} the wings and their high wing loading of 32 lb/sq ft. This would otherwise make {{the aircraft}} difficult to handle, especially with a high landing speed, but this was countered by the new development of the Fairey-Youngman flap, eventually patented in 1941. These flaps were large, around 1/3rd of the wing chord. Their movement went in two phases, controlled by a linkage; firstly the flap lowered below the wing and approximately parallel, making the aircraft almost a sesquiplane. This gave improved lift, but with little extra drag, and was used for landing. The flaps could be extended further for landing, now rotating downwards to 30° as a slotted flap. With the use of flaps, wing loading was reduced to the equivalent of 25 lb/sq ft and also gave a gain in lift coefficient of around 31%. The Fairey-Youngman flap and its initial downward parallel movement was superseded for other aircraft by the <b>Fowler</b> <b>flap,</b> which too had an initial parallel movement, although rearward sliding. Fairey did use this flap design for other aircraft though, such as the Fairey Barracuda dive bomber, as the design could be modified to also tilt the extended flap upwards, acting as a dive brake.|$|E
50|$|The Gulfstream II is a twin-jet {{swept wing}} {{corporate}} transport powered by two Rolls-Royce Spey turbofan engines {{and designed to}} provide high speed and long range capability without sacrificing the airport performance, reliability, and other operational advantages of its predecessor, the turboprop Gulfstream I.

5000|$|The Twin Otter {{incorporated}} [...] "flaperons" [...] that drooped the ailerons {{as part of}} the flaps, {{but these}} {{were not included in the}} Dash 7 due to weight and complexity. Instead, the ailerons were reduced in size to allow more flap area, and were augmented with two sets of roll spoilers, or [...] "spoilerons". The inboard roll spoilers operate at all speeds. while the outboard roll spoilers only operate at speeds less than 130 KIAS to allow for more roll control at slower speeds. Upon touchdown, both the inboard and outboard roll spoilers extend in unison to aid in destroying lift created by the wing. Each wing also includes two ground spoilers which only extend on touchdown. Most of the trailing edge is spanned by a complex, double <b>Fowler</b> <b>flap</b> arrangement for high lift at low speed. During a typical STOL landing, flaps are selected to the 45° position, generating more lift and drag, thus allowing for steeper descents and slower approach speeds. Depending on weight, the VREF speed with flaps at 45° is between 70 and 85 knots. On touchdown, through [...] "squat switches" [...] in the main gear, the flaps automatically retract to the 25° position, thus reducing lift once on the runway and producing better braking performance. The flaps also retract to 25° when engine power is increased during a go-around procedure. The four-engine layout aids lift at low speeds due to the wide span of the propellers blowing air over the wing ("propwash"). When reverse thrust is selected on landing, the props reverse pitch, push air forward, and slow the aircraft very effectively along with the antiskid wheel brakes. More importantly, if an engine fails, the asymmetric thrust is much less than on a twin-engine layout, thereby increasing safety and allowing for a lower minimum control speed with an engine inoperative [...]|$|E
