The objective of our work was to develop and evaluate several types of relatively inexpensive, portable, and efficient fish handling equipment to reduce the labor requirement for grading and harvesting fish from large circular culture tanks. This {{equipment and}} husbandry practices also had to provide for worker safety and minimize the stress or damage to the fish. Two techniques were developed and evaluated to remove the entire population from a large and deep circular tank, i. e. (a) purse seine and (b) carbon dioxide avoidance response. Two other techniques were developed and evaluated to remove the fish from a large (150 m 3) and deep (2. 44 m) circular culture tank after they had been top-graded in situ using a 3 -panel clam-shell grader: (c) an airlift fish pump and hand sorting/dewatering box and (d) a sidewall <b>drain</b> <b>box</b> for hand sorting/dewatering. Some of these technologies are new, while others (such as the purse seine) {{have been used in}} other applications. Our commercial-scale evaluation of these technologies provided insight into {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} each option. With use of the clam-shell grader, the majority of the fish in the culture tank were never lifted from the water during the self-sorting process, which minimized stress, perhaps enhancing final product quality. In contrast, harvesting the tank using the purse seine and hand brailing was much more labor intensive and increased the stress on the fish, as indicated by a nearly 10 -fold increase in fish mortality compared to the mortality observed when the clam-shell type crowder/grader system and an airlift fish pump or sidewall <b>drain</b> <b>box</b> were used during fish harvest. The combination of the clam-shell crowder/grader with the sidewall drain harvest box was our preferred harvest method, because of its low labor requirement, relatively low fish mortality, and rapid harvest rate. We also think that the carbon dioxide avoidance harvest technique can be used effectively, with little labor input and practically zero mortality when the entire fish population must be removed from a fish culture tank, but not during a selective harvest using in situ grading. Ultimately, the more effective technologies and practices should help fish farmers overcome scale-up issues and improve land-based fish farm profitability...|$|E
40|$|Construction of a {{saltwater}} pond {{research station}} 13 miles south west of Palacios, Texas {{was completed in}} early 1969. The pond facilities consist of 21 clay bottom ponds with the following dimensions: six 1 / 4 -acre, one l/ 3 -acre, six l/ 2 -acre, two 1 -acre, four 2 -acre, and two k-acre. Additional facilities include: laboratory building with wet and dry laboratory, maintenance and storage building, two residences for personnel, salt water pumping station with one 50 and two 7 l/ 2 horsepower turbines, boat harbor, fresh water well for salinity adjustments, 8 -inch underground PVC fill lines, 6 -inch drains, and a central concrete drainage canal. Electrial outlets are available to all ponds for aeriation and pumping operations. An evaporation pond is available for high salinity water. All ponds were constructed from existing Pleistocene clay soils, and clay dredged during construction of the boat harbor was used as fill material. All pond bottoms have a two percent slope to the concrete drain boxes where a damp board system, utilizing bevels and struts to lock 2 x 12 inch boards in place, was installed. Retainer screens (l/U-inch DuPont Vexar screen) were {{placed in front of}} the damp boards to prevent the escape of research animals. Ponds were filled with bay water pumped through PVC pipe and filtered through 52 mesh per inch seran bag filters installed at each pond inlet. The pond inlets are U-inch valves on all the l/^-acre ponds and 6 -inch on all other size ponds. Each pond has a separate butterfly valve for water input regulation. When the damp board system is removed, ponds drain by gravity flow through 6 -inch PVC outlets located {{at the bottom of the}} concrete <b>drain</b> <b>box.</b> This study was conducted in cooperation with the Department of Commerc...|$|E

5000|$|Before the 1840s simple {{surface drains}} or covered drains {{were used in}} towns. Surface drains carried off surface water by making the road section higher in the centre than at the sides. The {{simplest}} form of covered <b>drain</b> was the <b>box</b> <b>drain</b> that had a broad flat bottom. These drains caused problems because it was common for the entire volume of the drain to be completely filled and blocked. Another type of covered drain was the circular or barrel drain. They were rarely used, as they were more expensive and less effective than <b>box</b> <b>drains.</b> With {{the development of the}} ovoid or [...] "egg-shaped" [...] drains there was a dramatic improvement in the effectiveness of drainage systems. John Phillips designed the first ovoid drain in the 1840s and advocated that in order to have proper drainage of towns, separate drainage systems should be used for stormwater and sewage. The ovoid drains concentrated the flow of the water {{to the bottom of the}} drain and therefore decreased the likelihood of silting and blockage. In the beginning, these drains were made of stone but by the 1870s they were mainly built of cheaper brick ...|$|R

50|$|Two inlet drains {{entered the}} culvert from Albert Street in its {{original}} location. The first drain is approximately square and measures 450mm x 450mm {{and the second is}} a <b>box</b> <b>drain</b> that measures 800mm x 500mm. An ovoid brick drain running the length of Adelaide Street from Albert to Creek Street joins the culvert and carries the water to the Brisbane River. At the time of its heritage listing, it was reported that the sheer weight of the culvert appeared to hold the structure together as there was little mortar visible in the lower levels. There was however some patches of mortar visible between the blocks in the upper levels. At the western end there was some slurry build up on the floor from outside building projects but it is generally in good condition.|$|R
50|$|The {{cam shaft}} of the battery broke and the <b>box</b> <b>drain</b> for {{water from the}} river was {{insufficient}} in 1935 closing it down for repairs. The Hornsby engine was installed in February. 4,560 tons of stone were treated for a yield of 663 oz of gold. The battery operated 4,094 hours in 1936 producing 980 oz of gold from 6,951 tons of stone. G. Price at the Town View open cut had 750 tons treated at the Kidston battery for a yield of 55.77 oz of gold. The box water race from Copperfield River worked well as did the new Hornsby gas producer. 57 parcels were dealt with during the year. 66 parcels of ore were treated in 1938. In 1940 8,020 tons of ore from 22 mines were crushed in 3,648 hours of running time for 1,201 oz of gold.|$|R
40|$|The {{volcanic}} tephra Tierra Blanca Joven (TBJ) covers {{most of the}} Metropolitan Area of San Salvador where {{problems of}} mass wasting problems occur. To understand its behavior the Mohr-Coulomb, Modified Cam Clay and Hypoplasticity constitutive models were used to simulate consolidation and triaxial tests; looking for the one closer to real laboratory results. The constitutive models are used into finite element software to simulate {{the behavior of a}} soil mass (slope stability, bearing capacity etc.). Shear <b>box,</b> <b>drained</b> triaxial and consolidation tests were made in order to obtain the parameters for the models. The soil must be either saturated or dry, otherwise unsaturated properties are needed. After comparing the results of the constitutive model it was observed that none of them display exactly the real behavior observed in the laboratory. Mohr-Coulomb is the model that is used in all the geotechnical studies in El Salvador and it was the model that showed more deficiencies. Hypoplasticity showed good results in the triaxial tests but deviated from reality in the consolidation results. The results indicate that a different constitutive model and lab equipment are necessary (as TBJ is an unsaturated soil) to characterize the behavior of the soils in El Salvador. ...|$|R

50|$|A new {{alignment}} {{from the}} state line to Elk City {{was built in the}} late 1920s. It only coincided with the earlier route through Texola and through Sayre; the rest was entirely separate. Except in Sayre, where the city had paved the road with Portland cement (PC) in 1926, the state began paving the road in 1928 and 1929 with asphalt over a concrete base from Elk City to several miles east of Hext. It switched to PC in 1929, paving the remainder from east of Hext to the state line from 1929 to 1931. This alignment followed E1240 Road {{from the state}} line to Texola, and then the present main road through Erick and Hext to south of Sayre. The old cement lies {{in the center of the}} four-lane road through Texola, and then mainly follows the westbound lanes to Erick, through which it again lies in the center. A short abandoned piece of PC, including ruins from a former bridge over a creek, is located to the south of the road, between N1700 and N1710 Roads. Beyond Erick, the PC was again built in the present location of the westbound lanes, but has since been paved over until the I-40 interchange (exit 11). Just past exit 11, the road becomes two lanes, and the original road — mostly built as PC, but later resurfaced in asphalt, and once the westbound lanes of a divided highway - is now abandoned to the north of the open roadway; a 1928 concrete federal aid primary marker lies 0.8 mi west of Hext. Beyond Hext, where I-40 comes in from the south, the two-lane road crosses to the original roadway; the later eastbound lanes are now the westbound lanes of I-40. The 1929 alignment curved to the north into N1870 Road west of exit 20, following Main Street and Fourth Street as the original route did. However, it continued beyond Benton Boulevard to Sayre Avenue, turning off onto the present four-lane I-40 Bus. towards I-40 exit 25. Just prior to the exit, Route 66 curved northeast along the northside frontage road. It crossed to the south side after exit 26, crossing Timber Creek on a 1928 through truss bridge, and crossed again just east of the N1910 Road overpass. This part of the north frontage road, from east of N1910 Road to exit 32, retains the original 1928-1929 paving, as well as a 1926 <b>box</b> <b>drain.</b> Between exit 32 and Elk City, the original road (resurfaced) is now the westbound lanes of I-40 Bus., where another 1926 <b>box</b> <b>drain</b> still stands.|$|R
500|$|On 6 March 1862, {{the ship}} {{departed}} New York bound for Fort Monroe, Virginia, towed by the ocean-going tug Seth Low {{and accompanied by}} the gunboats [...] and [...] Worden, not trusting the seal between the turret and the hull, and ignoring Ericsson's advice, wedged the former in the up position and stuffed oakum and sail cloth in the gap. Rising seas that night washed the oakum away and water poured underneath the turret, {{as well as through}} the hawsepipe, various hatches, ventilation pipes, and the two funnels, so that the belts for the ventilation and boiler fans loosened and fell off and the fires in the boilers were nearly extinguished {{over the course of the}} next day; this created a toxic atmosphere in the engine room that knocked out most of the engine-room crew. First Assistant Engineer Isaac Newton ordered the engine room abandoned and had the able-bodied crew drag the afflicted engine room hands to the top of the turret where the fresh air could revive them. Both Newton and Stimers worked desperately to get the blowers to work, but they too succumbed to the noxious fumes and were taken above. One fireman was able to punch a hole in the fan <b>box,</b> <b>drain</b> the water, and restart the fan. Later that night, the wheel ropes controlling the ship's rudder jammed, making it near impossible to control the ship's heading in the rough seas. Monitor was now in danger of foundering, so Worden signaled Seth Low for help and had Monitor towed to calmer waters closer to shore so she was able to restart her engines later that evening. She rounded Cape Charles around 3:00pm on 8 March and entered Chesapeake Bay, reaching Hampton Roads at 9:00pm, well after the first day's fighting in the Battle of Hampton Roads had concluded.|$|R
40|$|Soil-bentonite (SB) slurry {{walls are}} one of the most popular {{techniques}} for minimizing the horizontal migration of contaminants. Backfill arching, or “hang-up” of the backfilled slurry, on the wall trench has the potential to significantly reduce the effectiveness of these barriers. This research was conducted to supplement the design and installation of an 11, 000 m long slurry wall at PotashCorp’s mine in Rocanville, Saskatchewan. The slurry wall is being installed through low permeability glacial till containing permeable granular zones. This study was undertaken to improve the understanding of vertical stress distribution in these deep barriers. In particular, the objective of this study was to develop an understanding of the factors controlling arching and hydraulic conductivity (k) of SB walls. Slurry wall “hang-up” or arching is dependent on shear along the wall of the trench and on a coefficient of lateral earth pressure (K). Consolidated <b>drained</b> (CD) shear <b>box</b> tests were conducted to study the shear strength parameters of the backfill mixes. Six inch proctor mold was modified with load cells on the side walls to measure horizontal stresses along with consolidation. This was used to calculate coefficient of lateral earth pressure, K (which is the ratio of horizontal to vertical effective stress). The results of the laboratory testing program found that K was relatively independent of the percentage of fines present in the SB mix. It also showed that backfill angle of internal friction and k of the backfill decreased with increased fines content. The results of the laboratory testing program were used to model the vertical stress distribution in deep walls. An analytical model (discrete model) and a coupled seepage stress-strain finite element model (FEM) were used to predict vertical stress changes with time and depth for the different backfill materials. The primary conclusion of this research is that slurry wall backfill arching or “hang-up” significantly delays the magnitude and timing of vertical stress build-up in backfill. This loss of vertical stress results in backfill with lower density and higher hydraulic conductivity. The situation was found to be most critical for deep narrow slurry walls. Any advantage in using a coarser graded backfill was offset by higher backfill hydraulic conductivity. The net result is that the upper portions of slurry walls may not be able to achieve their hydraulic conductivity objectives as soon as expected, if at all. In addition, the backfill in the upper portion of the trench may be susceptible to chemical attack and osmotic consolidation. Construction of a 2 m high surcharge berm over the slurry wall was found to increase vertical effective stress and result in significantly lower (2 to 8 times) hydraulic conductivity values in the top 5 metres of the trench. The final hydraulic conductivity (k) at a depth of 5 m was approximately 75 % lower with a surcharge berm. Thus, construction of a surcharge berm over the slurry wall helps to satisfy the k requirement for SB walls and lowers the risk of osmotic consolidation...|$|R
