25|$|The {{gray whale}} has a dark slate-gray color and {{is covered by}} {{characteristic}} gray-white patterns, scars left by parasites which drop off in its cold feeding grounds. Individual whales are typically identified using photographs of their dorsal surface and matching the scars and patches associated with parasites that have <b>fallen</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> whale or are still attached. They have two blowholes {{on top of their}} head, which can create a distinctive heart-shaped blow at the surface in calm wind conditions.|$|E
25|$|Police {{initially}} {{refused to}} believe Thomas Cummins' version of the events.

Thomas was initially charged with murder but released {{due to lack of}} evidence. He later won a settlement from the St.Louis police department for wrongful interrogation techniques.|$|E

25|$|At the 1987 World Championships in Rotterdam, Silivaș {{helped the}} Romanian squad win the team title, {{defeating}} the Soviet {{team for the}} first time since 1979. She was a favorite for the all-around title, but—hampered by low scores carried over from the team optionals, where she had <b>fallen</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> balance beam, as well as a shaky uneven bars routine in the all-around—she only managed to win the bronze medal behind teammate Aurelia Dobre and Shushunova. In the event finals, she won gold medals on the uneven bars and floor exercise.|$|E

25|$|There {{are some}} obvious {{differences}} between the original construction {{of the building and}} its restoration, probably owing to cost. The large chimneys were not kept for the restoration, although the fireplaces were kept, and the spire is no longer on the building. According to current members of the school community it may have <b>fallen</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> building in 1967. There are also some ornamental differences, such as the decorative finials that once lined the top of the roof and {{were not included in the}} restorations. Another significant difference is the verandah on the north side that has replaced an enclosed entry with a parapet, a row of eight lancet windows and the insignia of the school above a large arched front door.|$|E

25|$|The United States has {{encouraged}} Belarus to conclude and adhere to {{agreements with the}} International Monetary Fund (IMF) on the program of macroeconomic stabilization and related reform measures, {{as well as to}} undertake increased privatization and to create a favorable climate for business and investment. Although there has been some American direct private investment in Belarus, its development has been relatively slow given the uncertain pace of reform. An Overseas Private Investment Corporation agreement was signed in June 1992 but has been suspended since 1995 because Belarus did not fulfill its obligations under the agreement. Belarus is eligible for Export-Import Bank short-term financing insurance for U.S. investments, but because of the adverse business climate, no projects have been initiated. The IMF granted standby credit in September 1995, but Belarus has <b>fallen</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> program and did not receive the second tranche of funding, which had been scheduled for regular intervals throughout 1996.|$|E
25|$|In early 2012, the infighting {{between the}} Rojos and the Metros that left bloody {{confrontations}} and high-ranking arrests has diminished. Nonetheless, the Gulf Cartel {{had to change}} its logistics and reconstruct how it manages regional bosses, while other sources say that the Rojos are no longer part of the cartel. In the end, the control fell to the cartel members of the Metros faction, although the Rojos still has significant manpower. The Rojos and the forces loyal to the Cardenas drug family have barricaded in Matamoros, Tamaulipas, while their leader Juan Mejía González has <b>fallen</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> radar {{and has not been}} heard off since then. A day after several members of the Metros put up banners commemorating the late Samuel Flores Borrego on 6 August 2012, gunfighting occurred in the city, and the Metros' push in Matamoros is a sign that they are determined to remove people who turned against the organization in the past.|$|E
25|$|The two of {{them are}} taken {{to the edge of the}} Discworld by the ocean {{currents}} and nearly carried over, but they are caught by the Circumfence, a huge net built by the nation of Krull to catch sea life and flotsam washed in from the rest of the Discworld. They are rescued by Tethis the sea troll, a being composed of water who had <b>fallen</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> edge of his own world and onto the Discworld, where he was subsequently enslaved by the Krullians. Rincewind and Twoflower are then taken by the Krullians to their capital, where they learn that the Krullians intend to discover the sex of Great A'Tuin by launching a space capsule over the edge of the Disc, and plan to sacrifice Rincewind and Twoflower to get the god Fate to smile on the voyage, Fate insisting on their sacrifice after they caused him to lose the earlier game. Rincewind and Twoflower attempt to escape, but end up stealing the capsule, which is launched with Twoflower inside, the tourist wishing to see the other worlds of the universe. Rincewind is unable to get into the capsule in time, and falls off the Disc alongside it, the Luggage following them soon after.|$|E

25|$|When racing resumed, Bird kept {{first place}} and {{was in front of}} both Mahindra cars. Di Grassi was seven seconds in arrears of Gasly, {{although}} the latter had <b>fallen</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> pace of the leading battle, and the two were separated by the yet-to-stop Frijns. Bird used the restart to increase his lead to three seconds over both Mahindra drivers without using too much electrical energy. D'Ambrosio spun at the chicane, and although his car's rear-end was damaged, his rear wing remained in tact. Félix da Costa steered to the inside of Duval, but spun at the first turn, falling behind Duval's teammate d'Ambrosio. Prost caught di Grassi and placed extensive pressure onto the latter for fifth position. Rosenqvist's team noticed his car had an energy readout issue, and they prompted teammate Heidfeld to overtake him for second position on lap 36 to see whether he could draw closer to Bird and pass him. Rosenqvist fell behind quickly so that his problem could be solved in a calmer environment. The manoeuvre allowed Bird to further extend his advantage by one second. Piquet was handed a drive-through penalty because he had not served an earlier ten-second penalty—which was issued to him after changing his engine—at his car swap. D'Ambrosio drove to the inside of teammate Duval entering the sixth turn, and passed him, enabling Félix da Costa to draw closer to both Dragon cars. One lap later, Félix da Costa braked later than Duval, but made contact with Duval at the first corner hairpin. Félix da Costa was issued with a drive-through penalty as a result.|$|E
500|$|In 1864, Rodin {{submitted}} {{his first}} sculpture for exhibition, The Man with the Broken Nose, to the Paris Salon. The subject was an elderly neighbourhood street porter. The unconventional bronze piece {{was not a}} traditional bust, but instead the head was [...] "broken off" [...] at the neck, the nose was flattened and crooked, {{and the back of}} the head was absent, having <b>fallen</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> clay model in an accident. The work emphasized texture and the emotional state of the subject; it illustrated the [...] "unfinishedness" [...] that would characterize many of Rodin's later sculptures. The Salon rejected the piece.|$|E

[...] Caryn Ganz of the same {{publication}} named it a [...] "refreshing, reggae-tinged [...]" [...] Saeed Saeed of The National labelled it [...] "a peppy reggae track, [...] Madonna gives h a smackdown," [...] comparing it to Diplo's former work with Sri Lankan artist and former Madonna collaborator M.I.A.. Evan Sawdey of PopMatters called it [...] "defiant", but informed that it [...] "strikes {{more than a few}} poses copied from the Gwen Stefani playbook." [...] Gavin Haynes of NME opined that the song [...] "could've <b>fallen</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> back of a Major Lazer album." [...] While calling it [...] "interesting", Lydia Jenkin of The New Zealand Herald criticized Madonna's voice, which according to her, [...] "sounds out of place, and overly thin {{in the context of the}} track." [...] In other hand, Spins Andrew Unterberger provided a very positive note about the song, claiming: ...|$|E

500|$|When Peter {{tries to}} {{apologize}} the next day, Lois is still upset {{with him for}} missing their date and has {{decided to go to}} the country club dance with Quagmire. Later that night, Peter and Brian sneak into the dance to prevent the kiss that caused Lois {{to fall in love with}} Quagmire. They get in by crawling through the air vent, but crash through and kill one of the guys playing in the band on the stage, so Brian has to play guitar and sing. Peter tries to convince Lois that they belong together but she stubbornly informs Peter that he had his chance and blew it, and therefore she loves Quagmire now. Peter almost gives up but Brian notices Chris, Stewie, and Meg disappearing from a family picture, indicating that they have <b>fallen</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> plane of existence and tells Peter it is his last chance to do something that proves he loves Lois. Peter then demonstrates his passion by punching Quagmire and kissing Lois, showing that he cares deeply for her and wins back her love. He asks her to marry him and she accepts. In honor of this success, Brian and the band play [...] "Never Gonna Give You Up" [...] by Rick Astley. The episode ends with things seemingly back to normal, with the exception of Roger from American Dad! apparently living with the family.|$|E
500|$|At 05:00 on 23 April 1918, the High Seas Fleet left harbor {{with the}} {{intention}} of intercepting one of the heavily escorted convoys. Wireless radio traffic was kept to a minimum to prevent the British from learning of the operation. At 05:10 on 24 April, Moltke suffered machinery failure: the starboard propeller had <b>fallen</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> shaft, and before the turbine could be stopped, a gear wheel was destroyed. The destroyed wheel flung pieces of steel into an auxiliary condenser, which flooded the engine room and stopped the operation of the center and starboard engines. Saltwater entered the boilers, reducing the ship's speed to a mere four knots; by 08:45, the captain of Moltke reported to Scheer that his ship was [...] "out of control", and that the ship would need to be towed. At 09:38, the cruiser Strassburg attempted to take the ship under tow, but was unable to do so. At 10:13, the dreadnought [...] was detached from the battle fleet to tow Moltke back to port. At 14:10, the convoy had still not yet been located, and so Scheer turned the High Seas Fleet back towards German waters. By 17:10, Moltkes engines had been repaired, and the ship was able to steam at a speed of 17knots. At 19:37, the British submarine [...] spotted the ship and fired a torpedo into Moltke. The ship took in 1,800tons of water, but was able to reach harbor under her own power. Repairs were carried out in Wilhelmshaven in the Imperial Dockyard, between 30 April and 9 September 1918.|$|E
500|$|In 2015, Victor has Jack {{kidnapped and}} {{replaced}} by a lookalike, who {{turns out to be}} a Peruvian drug lord named Marco Annicelli, all in order for him to take over Jabot Cosmetics and merge it with Newman, becoming Newman Abbott Enterprises. Meanwhile, Victor and his children discover that Nikki has <b>fallen</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> wagon; they convince her to quit drinking again and she and Victor end up reuniting. Jack makes his way back to Genoa City just as Victor learns that Marco is dangerous; he plans on shooting Marco dead in the park, but it is actually Jack who he ends up shooting, who had finally returned to confront him. Jack ends up falling comatose while Victor frantically tries to get rid of Marco, who continues to masquerade around town. When Jack awakens, he reluctantly agrees to help Victor get Marco out of town and back in prison, which they end up doing successfully. With the real Jack back in Genoa City, the Newman Abbott merger comes to an end and both companies return to their separate states. Meanwhile, Adam, who had returned to town under the false identity of Gabriel Bingham, had teamed up with Ian (who had escaped prison) to create a computer virus to destroy Newman Enterprises for separate revenge on both their parts; the virus was known as the Paragon project, which later led to the revelation that [...] "Gabriel" [...] is in fact Adam. He agrees to stop Paragon, but Ian makes no such promise; on Halloween, when a party was being thrown in the Newman Enterprises ballroom, Ian is responsible for the building catching fire and a great panic ensuing. As a result, Ashley and Billy (Burgess Jenkins) offer to share office space at Jabot with Newman while the Newman building is being repaired, but Victor refuses to trust them. It is later revealed that Billy revived Paragon as an act of revenge against Victor, leading to Jack firing him and Victor filing a lawsuit against Jabot.|$|E
