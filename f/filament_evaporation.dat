Krypton costs about 100 {{times as much as}} argon. Krypton (along with xenon) is also used to fill incandescent lamps to reduce <b>filament</b> <b>evaporation</b> and allow higher operating temperatures. A brighter light results with more blue color than conventional incandescent lamps.|$|E
25|$|While {{inert gas}} reduces <b>{{filament}}</b> <b>evaporation,</b> it also conducts {{heat from the}} filament, thereby cooling the filament and reducing efficiency. At constant pressure and temperature, the thermal conductivity of a gas depends upon the molecular weight of the gas and the cross sectional area of the gas molecules. Higher molecular weight gasses have lower thermal conductivity, because both the molecular weight is higher and also the cross sectional area is higher. Xenon gas improves efficiency because of its high molecular weight, but is also more expensive, so its use is limited to smaller lamps.|$|E
25|$|An {{incandescent}} light bulb, incandescent lamp or {{incandescent light}} globe is an electric light {{with a wire}} filament heated to such a high temperature that it glows with visible light (incandescence). The filament, heated by passing an electric current through it, is protected from oxidation with a glass or fused quartz bulb that is filled with inert gas or evacuated. In a halogen lamp, <b>filament</b> <b>evaporation</b> is slowed by a chemical process that redeposits metal vapor onto the filament, extending its life. The light bulb is supplied with electric current by feed-through terminals or wires embedded in the glass. Most bulbs are used in a socket which provides mechanical support and electrical connections.|$|E
5000|$|Wire <b>{{filament}}s</b> for <b>evaporation</b> cannot deposit thick films, {{because the}} size of the filament limits the amount of material that can be deposited. Evaporation boats and crucibles offer higher volumes for thicker coatings. Thermal evaporation offers faster evaporation rates than sputtering. Flash evaporation and other methods that use crucibles can deposit thick films.|$|R
40|$|Platinum may be {{evaporated}} in vacuum {{at temperatures}} below the fusion or evaporation temperatures of tungsten. This makes possible {{the substitution of}} the evaporation technique for sputtering. Previous attempts to evaporate platinum were unsuccessful {{because it was not}} possible to heat it efficiently when a small piece was simply laid in a tungsten coiled <b>filament.</b> The <b>evaporation</b> is, however, easily effected when platinum is electrodeposited onto the tungsten filament...|$|R
25|$|The {{role of the}} gas is {{to prevent}} <b>evaporation</b> of the <b>filament,</b> without {{introducing}} significant heat losses. For these properties, chemical inertness and high atomic or molecular weight is desirable. The presence of gas molecules knocks the liberated tungsten atoms back to the <b>filament,</b> reducing its <b>evaporation</b> and allowing it to be operated at higher temperature without reducing its life (or, for operating at the same temperature, prolongs the filament life). It however introduces heat losses (and therefore efficiency loss) from the filament, by heat conduction and heat convection.|$|R
25|$|In a {{conventional}} lamp, the evaporated tungsten eventually condenses {{on the inner}} surface of the glass envelope, darkening it. For bulbs that contain a vacuum, the darkening is uniform across the entire surface of the envelope. When a filling of inert gas is used, the evaporated tungsten is carried in the thermal convection currents of the gas, depositing preferentially on the uppermost part of the envelope and blackening just {{that portion of the}} envelope. An incandescent lamp that gives 93% or less of its initial light output at 75% of its rated life is regarded as unsatisfactory, when tested according to IEC Publication 60064. Light loss is due to <b>filament</b> <b>evaporation</b> and bulb blackening. Study of the problem of bulb blackening led to the discovery of the Edison effect, thermionic emission and invention of the vacuum tube.|$|E

40|$|A close {{temporal}} and spatial association has been found between erupting filaments/coronal transients and radio noise storm continua. The three transients studied occurred away from active regions and {{are members of a}} class not usually accompanied by chromospheric emission. The data analyzed were from the S- 054 soft X-ray telescope on Skylab and from one- and two-dimensional interferometers at meter and decameter wavelengths at Nancay and Clark Lake observatories. Calculations confirmed that observed microwave radiation from the transients is due to thermal bremsstrahlung. The results are consistent with an interpretation of heating of an increased amount of coronal plasma by nonthermal, 10 - 100 keV electrons. Three possibilities for the source of the material are described: (1) the <b>filament</b> material; (2) <b>evaporation</b> from the chromosphere or transition region; and (3) via a long-lived reconnection process...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{nanocomposite}} material consisting of silicon suboxide (SiOx) film embedded with gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) was synthesized using hybrid technique combining hot wire evaporation and plasma enhanced {{chemical vapour deposition}} (PECVD) method. As prepared Au/SiOx films were rapid thermal annealed at constant temperature of 800  °C for different annealing times from 30 to 120  s. The use of tungsten <b>filament</b> for Au <b>evaporation</b> allowed the effective reduction of the silicon content. Depth profiling analysis confirmed the embedded in structure of Au/SiOx film. FESEM, UV/VIS/NIR and PL spectroscopy were utilized to study the structural and optical properties of annealed Au/SiOx film for different times. Embedded Au NPs diffused towards the surface of SiOx film agglomerate and increased in size {{with an increase in}} annealing time. Localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) peak induced by Au NPs in SiOx, which is dependent on annealing time, was clearly observed in optical spectra. Intensity and position of the PL peak located at 580  nm experienced a decrease and red-shift, as annealing time increased. © 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|The surface {{conversion}} H-minus {{ion source}} employs two 60 mil tungsten filaments which are approximately 17 centimeters in length. These filaments are heated to approximately 2, 800 degrees centigrade by 95 [...] 100 amperes of DC heater current. The arc is struck at a 120 hertz rate, for 800 microseconds and is generally run at 30 amperes peak current. Although sputtering {{is considered a}} contributing factor in {{the demise of the}} <b>filament,</b> <b>evaporation</b> is of greater concern. If the peak arc current can be maintained with less average heater current, the <b>filament</b> <b>evaporation</b> rate for this arc current will diminish. In the vacuum of an ion source, the authors expect the filaments to retain much of their heat throughout a 1 millisecond (12 % duty) loss of heater current. A circuit to eliminate 100 ampere heater currents from filaments during the arc pulse was developed. The magnetic field due to the 100 ampere current tends to hold electrons to the filament, decreasing the arc current. By eliminating this magnetic field, the arc should be more efficient, allowing the filaments to run at a lower average heater current. This should extend the filament lifetime. The circuit development and preliminary filament results are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{efficiency}} of incandescent light bulbs (ILBs) is inherently very low due to significant emission at infrared wavelengths, diminishing its market share rapidly. ILBs with cold-side filters that transmit visible light but reflect infrared radiation {{back to the}} filament can surpass state-of-the-art light-emitting diodes (LEDs) in both efficiency and light quality (color rending index; CRI). However, practical challenges such as filter and filament thermal stability, <b>filament</b> <b>evaporation</b> and imperfect geometrical alignment (view factor) between the filament and cold-side filter can limit the maximum achievable efficiency and significantly reduce the effectiveness of cold-side filters. In this thesis, we first present {{a review of existing}} approaches to improve the {{efficiency of}} ILBs such as selective filters and emitters for incandescent lighting. We highlight different challenges in achieving an efficient and long lasting bulb, and discuss previous approaches used to address these challenges in ILBs. We then present the modelling framework as well as the experimental setup and methods use throughout the thesis to study these problems. Second, we show that the effect of imperfect view factor between the filament and filter on the system efficiency can be minimized by combining a cold-side optical filter with a selective emitter. We experimentally and theoretically demonstrate energy savings of up to 67 % compared to a bare tungsten emitter at 2000 K, representing a 34 % improvement over a bare tungsten filament with a filter. Our work suggests that this approach can be competitive with LEDs in terms of luminous efficiency as well as CRI using selective emitters and filters already demonstrated in the literature, thus paving the way for next-generation high-efficiency ILBs. Third, we propose adding specular side reflectors between the filament and the cold-side filter to increase the view factor between the filament and filter which could further improve the efficiency of ILBs. We develop an analytical model to calculate the filament heat flux in 2 -D and 3 -D fully-specular enclosures consisting of a filament, a filter and side reflectors as a function of specular view factors and optical properties of the surfaces. Theoretical results show that significant improvements in luminous efficiency can be achieved using side reflectors in an ILB due to increased photon recycling. Our preliminary experimental results demonstrate an 18 % reduction in filament power consumption after adding polished copper side reflectors, thus validating the potential of this approach. Finally, we highlight two remaining challenges to achieve a durable and efficient ILB using the current planar geometry with infrared filters and discuss ways to address them. The first challenge - the filter thermal stability, is numerically and experimentally investigated to optimize the filament temperature and system geometry for maximum system efficiency while satisfying the maximum filter temperature. Using a COMSOL model validated by experimental measurements, we find that the maximum achievable luminous efficiency in a best-case scenario (vacuum environment) is about 4. 8 % when the maximum filter temperature is limited to 800 'C, only slightly higher than without infrared filters. We then investigate the second challenge - the high rate of tungsten <b>filament</b> <b>evaporation</b> and the resulting reduction in the ILB lifetime. We observe that the tungsten <b>filament</b> <b>evaporation</b> leads to rapid darkening of the filters primarily because of the low filter to filament area ratio, which limits the lifetime of the system to a few hours only. Lastly, we suggest system-level improvements that could help address these challenges and extend the lifetime of the ILB with cold-side filters. by Arny Leroy. Thesis: S.
