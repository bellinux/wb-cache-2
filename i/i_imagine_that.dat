2500|$|... 's Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, {{has urged}} the Chinese {{government}} to show [...] "restraint," [...] saying, [...] "These are significant developments and therefore {{have been the}} subject already of communication diplomatically between our two governments, and <b>I</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>that</b> those communications will continue." [...] He said Australia recognised Chinese sovereignty over Tibet but called for dialogue between the two sides when he was giving speech in Peking University on April 9, 2008.|$|E
2500|$|... "The marvel {{and mystery}} is how Engineer Jones stopped that train. The {{railroad}} men themselves wondered {{at it and}} of course the uninitiated could not do less. But stop it he did. In a way that showed his complete mastery of his engine, as well as his sublime heroism. <b>I</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>that</b> the Vaughan wreck will be talked about in roundhouses, lunchrooms and cabooses for the next six months, not alone on the Illinois Central, but many other roads in Mississippi and Louisiana." ...|$|E
60|$|I lay still. <b>I</b> <b>imagined</b> <b>that,</b> being in, {{he would}} {{switch on the}} {{electric}} light. He did, and I greeted him pleasantly.|$|R
6000|$|... "I hate you," [...] was {{her only}} reply; but <b>I</b> <b>imagined</b> <b>that</b> there was less vehemence in it than before--yet {{it might have been}} but my imagination.|$|R
6000|$|... "I did not," [...] she admitted. [...] "Indeed, I'll {{confess that}} I was {{somewhat}} startled {{when you came}} in. You see, <b>I</b> <b>imagined</b> <b>that</b> you were still in Canada." ...|$|R
2500|$|.....a pianist {{who appears}} to be {{something}} really quite extraordinary. [...] I had to overcome great resistance in order to go at all, for the description I'd heard from Dr. Hoffmann and from Maurice Zam had made me very skeptical. [...] But I must say that I have never heard such a pianist before...First, [...] he does not play at all in the style you and I strive for. [...] And just as I did not judge him on that basis, <b>I</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>that</b> when you hear him, you too will be compelled to ignore all matters of principle, and probably will end up doing just as I did. [...] For your principles would not be the proper standard to apply. [...] What he plays is expression in the older sense of the word, nothing else; but such power of expression I have never heard before. [...] You will disagree with his tempis as much as I did. [...] You will also note that he often seems to give primacy to sharp contrasts at the expense of form, the latter appearing to get lost. [...] I say appearing to; for then, in its own way, his music surprisingly regains its form, makes sense, establishes its own boundaries. [...] The sound he brings out of the piano is unheard of, or at least I have never heard anything like it. [...] He himself seems not to know how he produces these novel and quite incredible sounds - although he appears to be a man of intelligence and not just some flaccid dreamer. [...] And such fullness of tone, achieved without ever becoming rough, I have never before encountered. [...] For me, and probably for you too, it's really too much fullness, but as a whole it displays incredible novelty and persuasiveness. [...] And above all he's only [...] old, so he's still got several stages of development before him, from which one may expect great things, given his point of departure... it is amazing what he plays and how he plays it. [...] One never senses that it is difficult, that it is technique - no, it is simply a power of the will, capable of soaring over all imaginable difficulties in the realization of an idea. - You see, I'm waxing almost poetic.|$|E
60|$|And <b>I</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>that</b> their {{sluggish}} Dutch blood {{yielded to}} these influences and was greatly stirred by memories of youth.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{may have}} been mistaken, Miss Cliffe," [...] Grahame suggested. [...] "Somehow, <b>I</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>that</b> Gomez is not a {{favorite}} of yours." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "On the whole, <b>I</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>that's</b> lucky. The {{trustees}} spent {{a large sum}} {{in trying}} to find him and were satisfied he was dead. His age made this probable." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{will leave}} the reason for Lord Dredlinton's {{appointment}} alone for the moment," [...] Phipps continued. [...] "I <b>imagined</b> <b>that</b> it would be gratifying to you. <b>I</b> <b>imagined</b> <b>that</b> the four thousand a year would be of some account in your housekeeping." ...|$|R
60|$|Although knowing him so well, <b>I</b> <b>imagined</b> <b>that</b> he, like me, {{was well}} nigh {{overcome}} with terror, and intent only on saving his own skin without giving heed to whatsoever might come upon his companions.|$|R
6000|$|... "I guess you've {{been reading}} some dime and half-dime colored-cover novels, Paul. <b>I</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>that</b> {{is the way}} they do in such books." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Boldness often pays, and <b>I</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>that</b> our mysterious enemies won’t {{think of}} looking for us at the Clanch mill. We’ll go out there to-morrow.” ...|$|E

60|$|Several times <b>I</b> <b>imagined</b> <b>that</b> {{a couple}} of the village young men noticed me very closely, but I paid no {{attention}} and went on my way, never dreaming of what was in store for me.|$|R
60|$|I admired Checco's {{wisdom in}} giving them {{good reasons for}} being {{faithful}} to him. <b>I</b> <b>imagined</b> <b>that,</b> if the beneficent rule of the Countess returned, it would fare ill with those who had taken part in the looting....|$|R
60|$|She flushed darkly. <b>I</b> <b>imagined</b> <b>that</b> she saw {{her husband}} {{installed}} in a luxurious suite of rooms, dining at one smart restaurant after another, and she pictured his days spent at race-meetings and his evenings at the play.|$|R
60|$|Mrs Drassilis {{blocked the}} motion. <b>I</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>that</b> the sharp note {{in her voice}} was lost on Tanky, but it rang out like a clarion to me.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will give}} it you with pleasure," [...] the Secretary answered, [...] "although <b>I</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>that</b> he would be quite willing to see you on your own request." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Then, Sir Agravaine,' {{said the}} king, 'perhaps {{you had better}} have your charger sent round at once. <b>I</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>that</b> the matter is pressing--time and--er--dragons wait for no man.' ...|$|E
60|$|I paused, for a {{new look}} had come into Benjy's eyes. He began that peculiar, {{sympathetic}} laugh of the negro, which catches and doubles on itself, and <b>I</b> <b>imagined</b> <b>that</b> a new admiration for me dawned on his face.|$|R
6000|$|... "So I supposed. At least, <b>I</b> <b>imagined</b> <b>that</b> {{he must be}} mistaken. But a man in love is {{an optimistic}} fool, of course, and I had loved you ever since you got into my cab that morning [...] ." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am glad of that," [...] said Sir Terence, who {{had been}} bristling. [...] "For a moment <b>I</b> <b>imagined</b> <b>that</b> {{it was to be}} implied I had been as indiscreet in my choice of a {{messenger}} as Sir David Baird." ...|$|R
60|$|I promised, and escaped. On {{the veranda}} I came upon Miss Thorn {{surrounded}} {{by some of}} her uncle's guests. <b>I</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>that</b> she was bored, for she looked it.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. MacAndrew {{tightened}} her lips. <b>I</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>that</b> she {{had never}} looked with approval on her sister's leaning towards persons who cultivated the arts. She spoke of [...] "culchaw" [...] derisively.|$|E
6000|$|... "Has disappeared. Your {{mother said}} he wanted to marry her after you went away, but she would not listen to him. <b>I</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>that</b> after this he will keep his distance." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "One would think," [...] {{said his}} lordship, [...] "that {{you would be}} glad to have the means of {{securing}} your mother from beggary. <b>I</b> <b>imagined</b> <b>that</b> you would have been in some measure gratified by my--my--my good intentions towards your family." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Said I {{wanted to}} see you?" [...] {{repeated}} Susy, with her blue eyes lifted in celestial scorn and wonderment. [...] "Said I {{wanted to see}} you? Are you not mistaken, Mr. Brant? Really, <b>I</b> <b>imagined</b> <b>that</b> you came here to see ME." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And so {{you kept}} {{everything}} ready?" [...] Charnock rejoined. [...] "Well, <b>I</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>that's</b> significant! But you see, I didn't know I could leave camp {{until the day}} before I started, and then {{it looked as if}} I'd get here as soon as the mail." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{admit that}} this is plausible," [...] Pamela confessed, [...] "but you are only {{pointing}} out a very obvious danger, for which <b>I</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>that</b> we are already fairly well prepared." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your question, {{stripped}} of its unnecessary and profane expletives, seems easy to answer. <b>I</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>that</b> my immoral son has just proposed to your daughter, and been accepted with--well, unusual emphasis." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This is not {{a matter}} {{altogether}} for levity, Anna," [...] she said. [...] "Your sister's future is at stake. <b>I</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>that</b> even you must realize that this is of some importance." ...|$|E
30|$|<b>I</b> would <b>imagine</b> <b>that</b> {{most people}} would learn to use this system very quickly.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do not ask me," [...] cried I, {{putting my}} hands before my eyes, for I thought I saw the dreaded spectre glide into the room; [...] "HE can tell. Oh, save me! Save me!" [...] <b>I</b> <b>imagined</b> <b>that</b> the monster seized me; I {{struggled}} furiously and fell {{down in a}} fit.|$|R
60|$|For once I had {{the best}} of matters. Louis was evidently in a highly nervous state, from which <b>I</b> <b>imagined</b> <b>that</b> things {{connected}} with their undertaking, whatever it might be, had reached a critical stage. There were lines underneath his eyes, and he looked about him {{every now and then}} nervously.|$|R
