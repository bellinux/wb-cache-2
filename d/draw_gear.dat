40|$|This {{paper is}} focused on the vehicle {{dynamics}} caused by the forces exchanged, through buffers and <b>draw</b> <b>gears,</b> by consecutive vehicles on a curve. The results have been obtained by adding a buffers/draw gears contact model on an existing multibody code, previously developed by the authors. The multibody code manages rigid bodies connected by elastic and rigid constraints; the wheel/rail contact model is three dimensional and employs an elastic constraint among wheel and rail. The wheel/rail contact is managed by means of a numerical model called TOAM (third order approximation method). Numerical tests and experimental validations of the proposed model are here presented, considering a train made by three vehicles, running on an S shaped curve, subjected to parametric compressive forces...|$|R

25|$|A {{difficulty}} {{encountered in}} the creation of models is that often Leonardo had not entirely thought through the mechanics of a machine before he drew it, or else he used a sort of graphic shorthand, simply not bothering to <b>draw</b> a <b>gear</b> or a lever at a point where one is essential {{in order to make a}} machine function. This lack of refinement of mechanical details can cause considerable confusion. Thus many models that are created, such as some of those on display at Clos Luce, Leonardo's home in France, do not work, but would work, with a little mechanical tweaking.|$|R

50|$|Born into {{a family}} of musicians, {{he was the only}} one not able to play an instrument. His fondness for drawing was so {{apparent}} that his parents supported his artistic training throughout his school days. He started drawing steampunk art long before the term was coined. In 2000 he did the layout and background design for Walt Disney's film Atlantis: The Lost Empire. It was during this period that he developed a fondness for <b>drawing</b> submarines, <b>gears</b> and similar gadgets.

50|$|With {{gooseneck}} couplers or offset shank couplers, {{the horizontal}} {{centerline of the}} coupler head is above the horizontal centerline of the coupler shank, or shaft, and the <b>draw</b> <b>gear.</b> This arrangement is designed for use with low-floor freight cars, to lift the coupler head high enough to match the couplers on other rolling stock. The large bogie boxvans for car parts, used on the Victorian Railways, were fitted with gooseneck couplers for that reason.|$|E
50|$|The vans were {{fitted with}} the same {{low-level}} aligned bogies as the FCW class of flat wagon (previously FCF); wagons within the W bogie class could be bogie-exchanged, but only within that group which indicated a low-level design to accommodate the taller loads. The lower underframe also necessitated gooseneck-type couplers, designed to lift the coupler head high enough to match the couplers on other rolling stock.

5000|$|The trains were to use {{equipment}} {{based on}} the British Rail Mark 4 coaches modified for long distance service. All the cars were air-conditioned with power operated doors and {{designed to meet the}} safety standards of each country they would run through, the most stringent of these requirements being for the Channel Tunnel. A fleet of 139 cars were originally ordered, broken down as 47 seated cars, 72 sleeper cars and 20 service vehicles. The cars would have normally been configured as 9 seven-car and 9 eight-car sub-sets, with four spares (two seated cars and two service vehicles). The trains would have run as either individual sub-sets (for beyond London services and to some European destinations), or as two sets coupled together (from London and through the Tunnel). As the trains were designed to run as fixed formation sub-sets, only the two outer ends of each sub-set had buffers and <b>draw</b> <b>gear.</b> The sub-sets would have been configured as follows: ...|$|E
50|$|Prior to the {{modification}} of its intermediate <b>draw</b> and buffing <b>gear</b> {{to convert it}} to the Type XP1, the tender had already been modified. Most of the Type MP1 tenders were modified by shortening and raising {{the sides of the}} coal bunker, in effect making the coal {{at the rear of the}} bunker more easily accessible to the stoker and apparently without affecting the tender's coal capacity. The profile of the Type XP1 tender corresponds with the official dimensional drawing of such a modified Type MP1.|$|R
50|$|Two of the {{locomotives}} {{were later}} modified by the SAR. No. 745 {{was equipped with}} 1 in larger diameter tyres on its coupled wheels, while no. 746 was coupled to a modified Type MP1 tender. The intermediate <b>draw</b> and buffing <b>gear</b> of the tender, no. 1634 off a Class MC1 Mallet locomotive, was altered to suit no. 746. This modification converted tender no. 1634 to the sole Type XP1 tender. While it had the same coal capacity as the Type XM2 with which the locomotives were delivered, it had a 250 imp gal larger water capacity.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{temperature}} of rubber or rubber-metal springs {{is liable to}} increase under cyclic loading, due to hysteresis losses and low rubber thermal conductivity. This well-known phenomenon, called a heat build-up, is {{the primary reason for}} rubber aging. A temperature increase within the rubber compound leads to degradation of its physical and chemical properties, its stiffness increase and its damping capability loss. An extensive heat build-up can be a major concern during the accelerated fatigue testing of rubber-metal springs as it alters the spring properties during the testing procedure and can cause permanent damage leading to the testing results unreliability. The paper presents a case study of the heat generation prediction in the rubber-metal spring of railway <b>draw</b> <b>gear</b> during dynamic testing in accordance with UIC Code 827 - 1...|$|E
40|$|Rubber {{is a very}} {{flexible}} material with many desirable properties Which enable its broad use in engineering practice. Rubber or rubber-metal springs are widely used as anti-vibration or anti-shock components in technical systems. Rubber-metal springs are usually realized as a bonded assembly, however especially in shock absorbers, {{it is possible to}} realize free contacts between rubber and metal parts. In previous research it authors was observed that friction between rubber and metal in such case have a significant influence on the damping characteristics of shock absorber. This paper analyzes the development process of rubber or rubber-metal shock absorbers realized free contacts between the constitutive parts, starting from the design, construction, testing and operation, with special emphasis on the development of rubber-metal springs for the buffing and <b>draw</b> <b>gear</b> of railway vehicles...|$|E

Modern level advanced carbon composite materials have opened a new level of soundless, high resilience, lubricant free and precision gearing in power and motion transmission.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the concept of}} lifelong learning and the approach to it by Universiti Utara Malaysia’s Executive Development Centre (EDC). It illustrates how a university adopts an indigenous approach that delivers lifelong learning programmes and its implication for working adults. Generally, Universiti Utara Malaysia and other public universities in Malaysia are non-profit making institutions. Currently, EDC is offering more than twenty five (25) executive diplomas and certificate courses. The target students are working adults who wish to upgrade their management skills and knowledge. For this purpose, EDC has forged strategic alliances with several training providers and in tandem, <b>draws</b> up courses <b>geared</b> towards working adults. In working with education providers, EDC closely monitors the courses managed by its partners. The mode of delivery is face-to-face interaction during classes that are held during weekends once every month. The duration of the programmes may last from {{a few weeks to}} a year depending on the number of modules the students are required to complete. All courses are subjected to formal evaluation to show proof of students acquiring the requisite knowledge before they are conferred certificates or executive diplomas. ...|$|R
