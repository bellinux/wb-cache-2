5|$|The severed ear that Jeffrey discovers {{is also a}} key {{symbolic}} element, leading Jeffrey into danger. Indeed, just as Jeffrey's troubles begin, {{the audience}} is treated to a nightmarish sequence in which the camera zooms into the canal of the severed, decomposing ear. Notably, the camera does not reemerge from the ear canal {{until the end of}} the film. When Jeffrey finally comes through his hellish ordeal unscathed, the ear canal shot is replayed, only in reverse, zooming out through Jeffrey's own <b>ear</b> <b>as</b> he relaxes in his yard on a summer day.|$|E
5|$|Van Gogh's gaze {{is seldom}} {{directed}} at the viewer. The portraits vary in intensity and colour, and in those painted after December 1888 especially, the vivid colours highlight the haggard pallor of his skin. Some depict the artist with a beard, others without. He can be seen with bandages in portraits executed just after he mutilated his ear. In only a few does he depict himself as a painter.

5|$|Jeffrey {{insists on}} {{returning}} to Dorothy's apartment and tells Sandy to immediately send the police there, including her father. At Dorothy's apartment, Jeffrey finds Dorothy's husband, who is dead from a gunshot {{to the head}} and identifiable by his missing <b>ear,</b> <b>as</b> well as the Yellow Man, who bears a gruesome head wound, leaving him barely conscious and unresponsive but still standing. When Jeffrey tries to leave, he sees the Well-Dressed Man coming {{up the stairs and}} recognizes him as Frank in disguise. Jeffrey talks to Detective Williams over the Yellow Man's police radio, but lies about his location inside the apartment. Frank enters the apartment and brags about hearing Jeffrey's location over his own police radio. While Frank searches for him in the wrong room, Jeffrey retrieves the Yellow Man's gun and hides in the same closet in which he hid during his first visit to the apartment. Frank fires sporadically, knocking over the dead Yellow Man, who had still been standing up, and when he opens the closet door, Jeffrey fatally shoots him in the head. Detective Williams, gun drawn, enters with Sandy a moment later. Jeffrey and Sandy now go ahead with their relationship and note the unusual appearance of robins in their town. Dorothy and her son are reunited.|$|E

25|$|Supra-aural {{headphones}} or on-ear headphones have pads {{that press}} against the ears, rather than around them. They were commonly bundled with personal stereos during the 1980s. This type of headphone generally {{tends to be}} smaller and lighter than circumaural headphones, resulting in less attenuation of outside noise. Supra-aural headphones {{can also lead to}} discomfort due to the pressure on the <b>ear</b> <b>as</b> compared to circumaural headphones that sit around the ear. Comfort may vary due to the earcup material.|$|E

As the armed guards move in to arrest Jesus, Peter draws his dagger and slashes off the ear of Malchus, {{one of the guards}} and a servant of the high priest Caiaphas. Jesus, in turn, heals the <b>ear</b> <b>as</b> he reprimands Peter for his actions. As the disciples flee, the guards secure Jesus, and beat him during the journey to the Sanhedrin.|$|E
25|$|Modigliani {{wrote to}} Ghiglia {{extensively}} from Capri, {{where his mother}} had taken him to assist in his recovery from tuberculosis. These letters are a sounding board for the developing ideas brewing in Modigliani's mind. Ghiglia was seven years Modigliani's senior, {{and it is likely}} that it was he who showed the young man the limits of his horizons in Livorno. Like all precocious teenagers, Modigliani preferred the company of older companions, and Ghiglia's role in his adolescence was to be a sympathetic <b>ear</b> <b>as</b> he worked himself out, principally in the convoluted letters that he regularly sent, and which survive today.|$|E
25|$|The coat is medium {{length and}} can be straight, wavy, or curly. There is {{frequently}} feathering on the legs and tail, {{as well as on}} the <b>ear.</b> <b>As</b> a working dog, the coat should be easy to keep, requiring very little grooming. Dirt tends to just fall away. English shepherds tend to shed quite a lot and fur may be found on and under furniture, clothes, and carpeting. The primary coat colors are: sable and white (clear and shaded), tricolor, black and white, and black and tan. Other variations such as solid dogs of any color, piebalds, and red nosed tricolors and sables also exist but are not common.|$|E

25|$|Hearing is not {{a purely}} {{mechanical}} phenomenon of wave propagation, but is also a sensory and perceptual event; in other words, when a person hears something, that something arrives at the <b>ear</b> <b>as</b> a mechanical sound wave traveling through the air, but within the ear it is transformed into neural action potentials. These nerve pulses then travel to the brain where they are perceived. Hence, in many problems in acoustics, such as for audio processing, it is advantageous {{to take into account}} not just the mechanics of the environment, but also the fact that both the ear and the brain are involved in a person’s listening experience.|$|E
25|$|In {{many people}} with hyperacusis, an {{increased}} activity develops in the tensor tympani muscle in the middle <b>ear</b> <b>as</b> part of the startle response to some sounds. This lowered reflex threshold for tensor tympani contraction is activated by the perception/anticipation of loud sound, and is called tonic tensor tympani syndrome (TTTS). In some people with hyperacusis, the tensor tympani muscle can contract just by thinking about a loud sound. Following exposure to intolerable sounds, this contraction of the tensor tympani muscle tightens the ear drum, {{which can lead to}} the symptoms of ear pain/a fluttering sensation/a sensation of fullness in the ear (in the absence of any middle or inner ear pathology).|$|E
25|$|On Christmas Eve 1945, in Bedford Falls, New York, George Bailey is suicidal. Prayers for him reach Heaven, where Clarence Odbody, Angel 2nd Class, is {{assigned}} to save George in order to earn his angel wings. To prepare, Clarence is shown flashbacks of George's life. The first is in 1919, when 12-year-old George saves his younger brother Harry, who falls through the ice on a frozen pond, from drowning; George loses his hearing in one <b>ear</b> <b>as</b> a result. While working after school at the local drug store, George sees that his employer, Mr. Gower, distraught over his son's death from the flu, has accidentally added poison to a child's prescription drug, and intervenes to stop it from causing harm.|$|E

25|$|Passive noise {{isolation}} is essentially using {{the body of}} the earphone, either over or in the <b>ear,</b> <b>as</b> a passive earplug that simply blocks out sound. The headphone types that provide most attenuation are in-ear canal headphones and closed-back headphones, both circumaural and supra aural. Open-back and earbud headphones provide some passive noise isolation, but much less than the others. Typical closed-back headphones block 8 to 12dB, and in-ears anywhere from 10 to 15dB. Some models have been specifically designed for drummers, with the aim to be able to monitor the recorded sound while shutting out the sound coming directly from the drums {{at the same time as}} much as possible. Such headphones claim to reduce ambient noise by around 25dB.|$|E
25|$|On his {{recovery}} {{he proceeded to}} Paris, and, establishing a modest studio in the rue de Université, began carefully {{to work out the}} ideas which had been slowly shaping themselves in his mind. Mention is made of two decorative panels Diana leaving the Bath, and a Young Nubian as almost the first fruits of his genius; but these did not attract public attention until much later, and the painting by which he practically opened his artistic career was the Apocalyptic Vision of St John, sent to the Salon of 1840.This was followed in 1843 by Evening, which received a medal of the second class, and afterwards became widely popular under the title Lost Illusions. It depicts a poet seated on the bank of a river, with his head drooping and a wearied posture, letting his lyre slip from a careless hand, and gazing sadly at a bright company of maidens whose song is slowly dying from his <b>ear</b> <b>as</b> their boat is borne slowly from his sight.|$|E
25|$|In part writing, {{the usage}} of Conjunct Melodic Motion is important, in which the parts {{generally}} move in stepwise motion, and in counterpoint, {{if there is a}} leap (a jump of a fourth or above), the part will progress the opposite direction it just leapt in stepwise motion. Parts also must progress together in contrary motion, meaning the parts are going in different directions. This is preferable to parallel motion, where the parts move together, or oblique motion, where one part doesn’t move and another does. Parallel motion can be used, {{but it is important to}} pay attention to intervals in order to avoid breaking counterpoint rules. Dissonant intervals, both melodic and harmonic intervals are not preferable in most cases. This includes augmented or diminished intervals, tritones, and seventh chords, simply because they sound very jarring in a piece that is meant to sound pleasant to the ear. Parallel intervals, which occur when two parts move the same distance creating the same interval twice in a row, are also important to be aware of. However, this is only a problem when the intervals are either a perfect fifth or a perfect octave. These also can sound uncomfortable to the <b>ear</b> <b>as</b> they tend to have an open or hollow sound.|$|E
