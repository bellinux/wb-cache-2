40|$|AbstractLet X be a compactum and G {{an upper}} {{semi-continuous}} decomposition of X such that each element of G is the continuous <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ordered compactum. If the quotient space X/G is the continuous <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ordered compactum, {{under what conditions}} is X also the continuous <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ordered compactum? Examples around the (non-metric) Hahn–Mazurkiewicz Theorem show that one must place severe conditions on G if one wishes to obtain positive results. We prove that the compactum X is the <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ordered compactum when each g∈G has 0 -dimensional boundary. We also consider the case when G has only countably many non-degenerate elements. These results extend earlier work of the first named author in <b>a</b> number <b>of</b> ways...|$|R

In Australia, the same scenes were removed because the Australian Classification Board refused to rate the game for release due to the depiction of sexual violencespecifically the child player-character being subjected to anal probing and the interactive abortion scene. Like the European version, these scenes were replaced with a placeholder card with an explanation of what was removed on a background <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> koala crying.|$|E

Falle found this man well-dressed and attractive and did not think that he fit the stereotypical <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> pimp. She had nowhere to sleep that night and had no money for food, so she accepted his offer. The man to whom she sold sex that night had teeth that were rotten. They had sex on a soiled mattress in a poorly-ventilated restaurant attic, and she received $100.|$|E

5|$|After {{the final}} photo was selected, Heiden {{commissioned}} two {{different versions of}} the album cover. The original image was taken in black-and-white, and Heiden experimented with a variety of treatments of the photo, {{to go along with the}} album's title, and finally arrived at the blue toned, hand tinted version of the image. The LP and CD album cover is a cropped <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> longer picture including torso, more of which is seen in the cover of the cassette tape edition, and was also included as a fold-out poster in the initial pressings of the LP. A poster of Madonna, mirroring the cover art, was included within the vinyl versions of the album.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} {{each school}} day, the player will be given the option to {{navigate}} to various locations within the game's setting. Each choosable location is accompanied by an <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> heroine in order to allow the choices to be easier to make. Throughout gameplay, the player is given multiple options to choose from. Text progression pauses at these points, and depending on the choices that the player makes, the affection rate of the heroine associated with the event will either increase, decrease, or remain the same. This mechanism determines which direction of the plot the player will progress into, but influences the story only during Konomi's and Karin's plot lines.|$|E
