5|$|The copulatory bulb {{of males}} (the sperm-transferring organ {{at the tip}} of the pedipalps), terminates in a narrow, curving tip called an <b>embolus,</b> which in Unicorn bears a hook at its base and is {{accompanied}} by a similar curved extension called a translucent sclerite.|$|E
5|$|Most strokes {{result from}} loss of blood supply, {{typically}} {{because of an}} <b>embolus,</b> rupture of a fatty plaque or narrowing of small arteries. Strokes can also result from bleeding within the brain. Transient ischaemic attacks (TIAs) are strokes in which symptoms resolve within 24 hours. Investigation into the stroke will involve a medical examination (including a neurological examination) and the taking of a medical history, focusing on {{the duration of the}} symptoms and risk factors (including high blood pressure, atrial fibrillation, and smoking). Further investigation is needed in younger patients. An ECG and biotelemetry may be conducted to identify atrial fibrillation; an ultrasound can investigate narrowing of the carotid arteries; an echocardiogram can be used to look for clots within the heart, diseases of the heart valves or the presence of a patent foramen ovale. Blood tests are routinely done as part of the workup including diabetes tests and a lipid profile.|$|E
25|$|Because an <b>embolus</b> {{arises from}} elsewhere, local therapy solves the problem only temporarily. Thus, {{the source of}} the <b>embolus</b> must be identified. Because the embolic {{blockage}} is sudden in onset, symptoms usually are maximal at the start. Also, symptoms may be transient as the <b>embolus</b> is partially resorbed and moves to a different location or dissipates altogether.|$|E
25|$|An {{embolism}} is the lodging of an <b>embolus,</b> a blockage-causing {{piece of}} material, inside a blood vessel. The <b>embolus</b> {{may be a}} blood clot (thrombus), a fat globule (fat embolism), a bubble of air or other gas (gas embolism), or foreign material. An embolism can cause partial or total blockage of blood flow in the affected vessel. Such a blockage (a vascular occlusion) may affect {{a part of the}} body distant from where the <b>embolus</b> originated. An embolism in which the <b>embolus</b> is a piece of thrombus is called a thromboembolism. Thrombosis, the process of thrombus formation, often leads to thromboembolism.|$|E
25|$|An embolic stroke {{refers to}} an {{arterial}} embolism (a blockage of an artery) by an <b>embolus,</b> a traveling particle or debris in the arterial bloodstream originating from elsewhere. An <b>embolus</b> is most frequently a thrombus, {{but it can also}} be a number of other substances including fat (e.g., from bone marrow in a broken bone), air, cancer cells or clumps of bacteria (usually from infectious endocarditis).|$|E
25|$|An {{arterial}} thrombus or <b>embolus</b> {{can also}} {{form in the}} limbs, {{which can lead to}} acute limb ischemia.|$|E
25|$|This {{is known}} as a {{paradoxical}} <b>embolus</b> because the clot material paradoxically enters the arterial system instead of going to the lungs.|$|E
25|$|An <b>embolus</b> lodging in {{the brain}} from either the heart or a carotid artery {{will most likely be}} the cause of a stroke due to ischemia.|$|E
25|$|Male palpal bulbs are {{relatively}} simple in appearance, with a circular <b>embolus,</b> and are rather similar in different species. The palp usually has a simple retrolateral tibial apophysis with a blunt tip.|$|E
25|$|It is a {{dangerous}} condition as there can be bleeding into the abdomen that results in low blood pressure and can be fatal. Other causes of death in people with an abdominal pregnancy include anemia, pulmonary <b>embolus,</b> coagulopathy, and infection.|$|E
25|$|Thrombosis {{may occur}} in veins (venous {{thrombosis}}) or in arteries. Venous thrombosis leads to congestion {{of the affected}} part of the body, while arterial thrombosis (and rarely severe venous thrombosis) affects the blood supply and leads to damage of the tissue supplied by that artery (ischemia and necrosis). A piece of either an arterial or a venous thrombus can break off as an <b>embolus</b> which can travel through the circulation and lodge somewhere else as an embolism. This type of embolism {{is known as a}} thromboembolism. Complications can arise when a venous thromboembolism (commonly called a VTE) lodges in the lung as a pulmonary embolism. An arterial <b>embolus</b> may travel further down the affected blood vessel where it can lodge as an embolism.|$|E
25|$|It is {{also quite}} common {{for women to}} present with {{evidence}} of having an <b>embolus</b> (clot) passing from the heart to a vital organ, causing such complications as stroke, loss of circulation to a limb, even coronary artery occlusion (blockage) with typical myocardial infarction (heart attack).|$|E
25|$|There are two {{situations}} when {{an inferior}} vena cava filter is considered advantageous, {{and those are}} if anticoagulant therapy is contraindicated (e.g. shortly after a major operation), or a person has a pulmonary <b>embolus</b> in spite of being anticoagulated. In these instances, it may be implanted to prevent new or existing DVTs from entering the pulmonary artery and combining with an existing blockage. In spite of the device's theoretical advantage of preventing pulmonary emboli, {{there is a lack}} of evidence supporting its effectiveness.|$|E
25|$|Any injury, {{such as a}} {{surgical}} operation, causes the body to increase the coagulation of the blood. Simultaneously, activity may be reduced. There is an increased probability of formation of clots in the veins of the legs, or sometimes the pelvis, particularly in the morbidly obese patient. A clot which breaks free and floats to the lungs is called a pulmonary <b>embolus,</b> a very dangerous occurrence. Blood thinners are commonly administered before surgery to reduce the probability {{of this type of}} complication.|$|E
25|$|Assuming {{a normal}} circulation, an <b>embolus</b> formed in a {{systemic}} vein will always {{impact in the}} lungs, after passing through {{the right side of}} the heart. This will form a pulmonary embolism that will result in a blockage of the main artery of the lung and can be a complication of deep-vein thrombosis. The most common sites of origin of pulmonary emboli are the femoral veins. The deep veins of the calf are the most common sites of actual thrombi.|$|E
25|$|Embolism can be {{classified}} as to where it enters the circulation either in arteries or in veins. Arterial embolism are those that follow and, if not dissolved on the way, lodge in a more distal part of the systemic circulation. Sometimes, multiple classifications apply; for instance a pulmonary embolism is classified as an arterial embolism as well, {{in the sense that}} the clot follows the pulmonary artery carrying deoxygenated blood away from the heart. However, pulmonary embolism is generally classified as a form of venous embolism, because the <b>embolus</b> forms in veins, e.g. deep vein thrombosis.|$|E
25|$|Catheter-directed {{thrombolysis}} (CDT) is a {{new technique}} found to be relatively safe and effective for massive PEs. This involves accessing the venous system by placing a catheter into a vein in the groin and guiding it through the veins by using fluoroscopic imaging until it is located next to the PE in the lung circulation. Medication that breaks up blood clots is released through the catheter so that its highest concentration is directly next to the pulmonary <b>embolus.</b> CDT is performed by interventional radiologists, and in medical centers that offer CDT, it may be offered as a first-line treatment. Catheter-based ultrasound-assisted thrombolysis is being investigated.|$|E
25|$|A stroke is {{the rapid}} decline of brain {{function}} {{due to a}} disturbance in the supply of blood to the brain. This can be due to ischemia, thrombus, <b>embolus</b> (a lodged particle) or hemorrhage (a bleed). In thrombotic stroke, a thrombus (blood clot) usually forms around atherosclerotic plaques. Since blockage of the artery is gradual, onset of symptomatic thrombotic strokes is slower. Thrombotic stroke {{can be divided into}} two categories—large vessel disease and small vessel disease. The former affects vessels such as the internal carotids, vertebral and the circle of Willis. The latter can affect smaller vessels such as the branches of the circle of Willis.|$|E
25|$|Prognosis {{depends on}} the amount of lung that is {{affected}} and on the co-existence of other medical conditions; chronic embolisation to the lung can lead to pulmonary hypertension. After a massive PE, the <b>embolus</b> must be resolved somehow if the patient is to survive. In thrombotic PE, the blood clot may be broken down by fibrinolysis, or it may be organized and recanalized so that a new channel forms through the clot. Blood flow is restored most rapidly in the first day or two after a PE. Improvement slows thereafter and some deficits may be permanent. There is controversy over whether small subsegmental PEs need treatment at all and some evidence exists that patients with subsegmental PEs may do well without treatment.|$|E
25|$|Both {{the central}} nervous system (brain and spinal cord) and the {{peripheral}} nervous system may be involved. Emboli to the brain may cause stroke-like episodes, headache and episodes of loss of vision in one eye (known as amaurosis fugax). Emboli to the eye can be seen by ophthalmoscopy and are known as plaques of Hollenhorst. Emboli to the spinal cord may cause paraparesis (decreased power in the legs) or cauda equina syndrome, a group of symptoms due to loss of function of the distal part of the spinal cord - loss of control over the bladder, rectum and skin sensation around the anus. If the blood supply to a single nerve is interrupted by an <b>embolus,</b> the result is loss of function in the muscles supplied by that nerve; this phenomenon is called a mononeuropathy.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two types}} of strokes: ischemic stroke and hemorrhagic stroke. An ischemic stroke happens when a person’s artery, which {{supplies}} blood to different areas of the brain, becomes blocked with a blood clot. This type of stroke happens 80% of the time. The blood clot may form in the blood vessel, which is called a thrombus, or the blood clot can travel from somewhere else in the blood system that is called an <b>embolus.</b> A hemorrhagic stroke occurs when a blood vessel in the brain ruptures or bursts. Overall, people experience bleeding inside or around brain tissue. This type of stroke happens 20% of the time and is very serious. The most common causes of hemorrhagic stroke are weak vessels, traumatic injury, chronic high blood pressure hypertension, and an aneurysm.|$|E
25|$|Uterine artery {{embolization}} (UAE) is a {{minimally invasive}} procedure for treatment of uterine fibroids. Under local anesthesia a catheter is introduced into the femoral artery at the groin and advanced under radiographic control into the uterine arterty. A mass of microspheres or polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) material (an <b>embolus)</b> is injected into the uterine arteries in order to block {{the flow of blood}} through those vessels. The restriction in blood supply usually results in significant reduction of fibroids and improvement of heavy bleeding tendency. The 2012 Cochrane review comparing hysterectomy and UAE did not find any major advantage for either procedure. While UAE is associated with shorter hospital stay and a more rapid return to normal daily activities, it was also associated with a higher risk for minor complications later on. There were no differences between UAE and hysterectomy with regards to major complications.|$|E
25|$|Cholesterol {{embolism}} (often cholesterol crystal embolism or atheroembolism, sometimes blue toe or purple toe syndrome or trash foot or warfarin blue toe syndrome) {{occurs when}} cholesterol is released, usually from an atherosclerotic plaque, and travels as an <b>embolus</b> {{in the bloodstream}} to lodge (as an embolism) causing an obstruction in blood vessels further away. Most commonly this causes skin symptoms (usually livedo reticularis), gangrene of the extremities and sometimes renal failure; problems with other organs may arise, depending on the site at which the cholesterol crystals enter the bloodstream. When the kidneys are involved, the disease {{is referred to as}} atheroembolic renal disease (AERD). The diagnosis usually involves biopsy (removing a tissue sample) from an affected organ. Cholesterol embolism is treated by removing the cause and giving supportive therapy; statin drugs have been found to improve the prognosis.|$|E
25|$|While PSA testing {{may help}} 1000 in 1,000,000 avoid death due to {{prostate}} cancer, 4000 to 5000 in 1,000,000 would die from prostate cancer after 10 years even with screening. This means that PSA screening may reduce mortality from prostate cancer {{by up to}} 25%. Expected harms include anxiety for 100 – 120 receiving false positives, biopsy pain, and other complications from biopsy for false positive tests. Of those found to have prostate cancer, frequent overdiagnosis is common because most cases of prostate cancer {{are not expected to}} cause any symptoms. Therefore, many will experience the side effects of treatment, such as for every 1000 men screened, 29 will experience erectile dysfunction, 18 will suffer urinary incontinence, 2 will have serious cardiovascular events, 1 will suffer pulmonary <b>embolus</b> or deep venous thrombosis, and 1 perioperative death. Since the expected harm relative to risk of death are perceived by patients as minimal, men found to have prostate cancer usually (up to 90% of cases) select to receive treatment.|$|E
500|$|Like most spiders, the pedipalps {{of mature}} males {{end in a}} bulb {{terminating}} in a thin, curved [...] projection called an <b>embolus,</b> through which sperm is released during mating. Female U. catleyi have been observed with broken-off <b>embolus</b> tips lodged in their genitalia. This has been hypothesized {{as a type of}} [...] "sperm-plug" [...] or copulatory plug, where, by breaking off a piece of his anatomy (a process known as genital mutilation or genital breakage), a male physically precludes other males from successfully mating with the female, one of many types of sperm competition in animals. An alternative to the sperm competition function is that genital mutilation might allow males to more rapidly escape and avoid being cannibalized after mating, although this function is thought to be unlikely in Unicorn since there are no significant size differences between sexes, and cannibalism is more common when females are much larger than males. Sperm plugs of various types, including gelatinous or waxy substances, have been observed in at least 41 spider families, and are generally thought to ensure paternity. U. catlyei is one of only few goblin spiders known or suspected to utilize sperm plugs.|$|E
2500|$|Embolism (obstruction {{due to an}} <b>embolus</b> from {{elsewhere}} in the body, see below), ...|$|E
2500|$|An {{arterial}} <b>embolus</b> might {{originate in}} the heart (from a thrombus in the left atrium, following atrial fibrillation or be a septic <b>embolus</b> resulting from endocarditis). Emboli of cardiac origin are frequently encountered in clinical practice. [...] Thrombus formation within the atrium occurs mainly in patients with mitral valve disease, and especially in those with mitral valve stenosis (narrowing), with atrial fibrillation (AF). [...] In the absence of AF, pure mitral regurgitation has a low incidence of thromboembolism.|$|E
2500|$|He died at {{his home}} in either Brookline or Brighton, Massachusetts in January 1938. [...] The cause of death was {{cerebral}} <b>embolus</b> and arteriosclerosis.|$|E
2500|$|... a {{reduction}} of {{blood flow to the}} heart that can be caused by stenosis, spasm, or acute occlusion (by an <b>embolus)</b> of the heart's arteries.|$|E
2500|$|A {{thrombus}} {{may become}} detached and enter circulation as an <b>embolus,</b> finally lodging in and completely obstructing a blood vessel, which unless treated very quickly {{will lead to}} tissue necrosis (an infarction) in the area past the occlusion. Venous thrombosis can lead to pulmonary embolism when the migrated <b>embolus</b> becomes lodged in the lung. In people with a [...] "shunt" [...] (a connection between the pulmonary and systemic circulation), either in the heart or in the lung, a venous clot can also {{end up in the}} arteries and cause arterial embolism.|$|E
2500|$|In {{paradoxical}} embolism, {{also known}} as crossed embolism, an <b>embolus</b> from the veins crosses to the arterial blood system. This is generally found only with heart problems such as septal defects [...] (holes in the cardiac septum) between the atria or ventricles. The most common such abnormality is patent foramen ovale, occurring in about 25% of the adult population, but here the defect functions as a valve which is normally closed, because pressure is slightly higher in {{the left side of}} the heart. Sometimes, for example if a patient coughs just when an <b>embolus</b> is passing, it might cross to the arterial system.|$|E
2500|$|In atrial fibrillation, {{the lack}} of an {{organized}} atrial contraction can result in some stagnant blood in the left atrium (LA) or left atrial appendage (LAA). This lack of movement of blood can lead to thrombus formation (blood clotting). If the clot becomes mobile and is carried away by the blood circulation, [...] it is called an <b>embolus.</b> [...] An [...] <b>embolus</b> proceeds through smaller and smaller arteries until it plugs one of them and prevents blood from flowing through the artery. This process results in end organ damage due to loss of nutrients, oxygen, and removal of cellular waste products. [...] Emboli in the brain may result in an ischemic stroke or a transient ischemic attack (TIA).|$|E
2500|$|Thrombosis is the {{pathological}} {{development of}} blood clots. These clots may break free and become mobile, forming an <b>embolus</b> or grow {{to such a}} size that occludes the vessel in which it developed. [...] An embolism is said to occur when the thrombus (blood clot) becomes a mobile <b>embolus</b> and migrates {{to another part of}} the body, interfering with blood circulation and hence impairing organ function downstream of the occlusion. This causes ischemia and often leads to ischemic necrosis of tissue. Most cases of venous thrombosis are due to acquired states (older age, surgery, cancer, immobility) or inherited thrombophilias (e.g., antiphospholipid syndrome, factor V Leiden, and various other genetic deficiencies or variants).|$|E
2500|$|Another major {{cardiovascular}} disease involves {{the creation of}} a clot, called a [...] "thrombus". These can originate in veins or arteries. Deep venous thrombosis, which mostly occurs in the legs, is one cause of clots in the veins of the legs, particularly when a person has been stationary for a long time. These clots may embolise, meaning travel to another location in the body. The results of this may include pulmonary <b>embolus,</b> transient ischaemic attacks, or stroke.|$|E
2500|$|In {{thrombotic}} stroke, a thrombus (blood clot) usually forms around atherosclerotic plaques. Since blockage of {{the artery}} is gradual, onset of symptomatic thrombotic strokes is slower {{than that of}} a hemorrhagic stroke. A thrombus itself (even if it does not completely block the blood vessel) can lead to an embolic stroke (see below) if the thrombus breaks off and travels in the bloodstream, at which point it is called an <b>embolus.</b> Two types of thrombosis can cause stroke: ...|$|E
2500|$|Warfarin {{therapy is}} usually {{continued}} for 3–6 months, or [...] "lifelong" [...] if {{there have been}} previous DVTs or PEs, or none of the usual risk factors is present. An abnormal D-dimer level {{at the end of}} treatment might signal the need for continued treatment among patients with a first unprovoked pulmonary <b>embolus.</b> For those with small PEs (known as subsegmental PEs) the effects of anticoagulation is unknown as it has not been properly studied as of 2014.|$|E
