40|$|Masked stimuli (primes) {{can affect}} the {{preparation}} of a motor response to 					subsequently presented target stimuli. Reactions to the target can be 					facilitated (straight priming) or inhibited (<b>inverse</b> <b>priming)</b> when preceded by a 					compatible prime (calling for the same response) and also when preceded by an 					incompatible prime. Several hypotheses are currently under debate. These are the 					self-inhibition (SI) hypothesis, the object-updating (OU) hypothesis, and 					mask-triggered inhibition (MTI) hypothesis. All assume that the initial 					activation of the motor response is elicited by the prime according to its 					identity. This activation inevitably leads to straight priming in some cases and 					the mechanisms involved are undisputed. The hypotheses differ, however, as to 					why <b>inverse</b> <b>priming</b> occurs. The self-inhibition (SI) hypothesis assumes that the 					motor activation elicited by a prime is automatically followed by an inhibition 					phase, leading to <b>inverse</b> <b>priming</b> if three conditions are fulfilled: perceptual 					evidence for the prime has to be sufficiently strong, {{it has to be}} immediately 					removed by the mask, and the delay between the prime and target has to be long 					enough for inhibition to become effective. The object-updating (OU) hypothesis 					assumes that <b>inverse</b> <b>priming</b> is triggered by the mask, provided that it contains 					features calling for the alternative response (i. e. the one contrasting with the 					response induced by the prime). The MTI hypothesis assumes that the inhibitory 					phase is triggered by each successive stimulus which does not support the 					perceptual hypothesis provided by the prime. Based mostly on our own 					experiments, we argue that (1) attempts to manipulate the three factors required 					by the SI hypothesis imply changes of other variables and that (2) indeed, other 					variables seem to affect priming: prime-mask perceptual interaction and temporal 					position of the mask. These observations are in favor of the MTI hypothesis. A 					limiting factor for all three hypotheses is that <b>inverse</b> <b>priming</b> is larger for 					arrows than for other shapes, making it doubtful as to what extent the majority 					of studies on <b>inverse</b> <b>priming,</b> due to their use of arrows, can be generalized to 					other stimuli...|$|E
40|$|Ketamine is used acutely as a {{model of}} schizophrenia. It has been {{suggested}} that chronic ketamine may also mimic aspects of this disorder, in particular impaired cognitive function. As semantic processing deficits are considered central to cognitive impairments in schizophrenia, this study aimed to characterize semantic impairments following both acute and chronic ketamine. We examined the acute effects of two doses of ketamine (Experiment 1) using a double-blind, placebo-controlled, independent group design with 48 volunteers. Ketamine's chronic effects (Experiment 2) were explored in 16 ketamine users and 16 poly-drug controls. A semantic priming task with a frequency (high and low) and stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA: short- 200 msec, long- 750 msec) manipulation was used. In Experiment 1, acute ketamine produced <b>inverse</b> <b>priming</b> at the long SOA. In Experiment 2, ketamine users showed <b>inverse</b> <b>priming</b> for low-frequency words at the long SOA compared to poly-drug controls. The <b>inverse</b> <b>priming</b> effect at the long SOA induced by acute ketamine was indicative of controlled processing impairments. In ketamine users, there was also an indication of controlled processing impairments. Decreased priming for low-frequency words suggested that long-term ketamine abuse results in damage to the semantic store...|$|E
40|$|In general, both {{consciously}} and unconsciously perceived stimuli facilitate {{responses to}} following similar stimuli. However, masked arrows delay responses to following arrows. This <b>inverse</b> <b>priming</b> has been ascribed to inhibition of premature motor activation, more recently even to special processing of nonconsciously perceived material. Here, <b>inverse</b> <b>priming</b> depended on particular masks, was insensitive to contextual requirements for increased inhibition, and was constant across response speeds. Putative signs of motor inhibition in the electroencephalogram {{may as well}} reflect activation of the opposite response. Consequently, rather than profiting from inhibition of primed responses, the alternative response is directly primed by perceptual interactions of primes and masks. Thus {{there is no need}} to assume separate pathways for nonconscious and conscious processing. How do unconsciously perceived stimuli influence perceptions and actions? For this question to be studied in the laboratory, briefly presented stimuli are made invisible by following masks. Particular interest has been devoted to stimulus designs in which the mask obscures the sensory impression of the stimulus, although it does not appear at the same location (metacontrast, e. g., Francis...|$|E

These sequences are generated by starting with <b>inverse</b> <b>prime</b> expansions in base 3 and then replacing 2 in the expansion with either the string 01 or 10 based on the preceding bit, which represents a general mapping.

The expression itself is essentially same as the usual Euler product that is the infinite product, but we define a new one as the limit of the product of some terms derived from the usual Euler product. We also refer to {{the relation between the}} Bernoulli number and $P(z) $, which is an infinite summation of a $z$ power of the <b>inverse</b> <b>primes.</b> When we apply the same technique to the $L$-function associated to an elliptic curve, we can evaluate the power of the Taylor expansion for the function even in the critical strip, which is deeply related to problems known as the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture and the Beilinson conjecture.

40|$|Faces are {{processed}} {{and stored in}} distinct neuroanatomical systems. Based on evidence of a critical role of sleep in memory processes, we investigated the impact of nocturnal sleep on implicit memories for faces in healthy men. Face repetition effects in reaction times were compared across sleep periods early in the night, which are dominated by slow wave sleep (SWS), and late in the night, where rapid eye movement (REM) sleep prevails, as well as across corresponding nocturnal intervals of wakefulness. An <b>inverse</b> <b>priming</b> effect was found selectively across REM sleep rich late sleep, as indicated by distinctly prolonged response latencies to previously presented faces compared with novel faces after this period of sleep (PB/ 0. 05). We assumed this <b>inverse</b> <b>priming</b> to reflect a facilitated identification of previously presented faces after extended REM sleep periods, thereby producing interference with the response generation in our task which did not require face identification but rather required recognizing formal features of the faces. This interpretation {{was supported by a}} supplemen-tary experiment where enhanced positive repetition priming was found across late, REM sleep dominated sleep in a task requiring face identification. Together, these findings indicate that implicit face memories particularly benefit from REM sleep associated brain mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|ObjectiveAutomatic {{emotional}} {{processing of}} faces and facial expressions gain {{more and more}} of relevance in terms of social communication. Among a variety of different primes, targets and tasks, whole face images and facial expressions have been used to affectively prime emotional responses. This study investigates whether emotional information provided solely in eye regions that display mental states can also trigger affective priming. MethodsSixteen subjects answered a lexical decision task (LDT) coupled with an affective priming paradigm. Emotion-associated eye regions were extracted from photographs of faces and acted as primes, whereas targets were either words or pseudo-words. Participants had to decide whether the targets were real German words or generated pseudo-words. Primes and targets belonged to the emotional categories fear, disgust, happiness and neutral. ResultsA general valence effect for positive words was observed: Responses in the LDT were faster for target words of the emotional category happiness when compared to other categories. Importantly, pictures of emotional eye regions preceding the target words affected their subsequent classification. While we show a classical priming effect for neutral target words - with shorter RT for congruent compared to incongruent prime-target pairs-, we observed an <b>inverse</b> <b>priming</b> effect for fearful and happy target words - with shorter RT for incongruent compared to congruent prime-target pairs. These <b>inverse</b> <b>priming</b> effects were driven exclusively by specific prime-target pairs. ConclusionReduced facial emotional information is sufficient to induce automatic implicit emotional processing. The emotional-associated eye regions were processed with respect to their emotional valence and affected the performance on the LDT...|$|E

40|$|Masked stimuli {{presented}} {{near the}} threshold of conscious awareness may act as primes, affecting responses to sub-sequent targets. With arrows as primes and targets, the prime–mask–target sequence {{has been shown to}} evoke triphasic lateralized readiness potentials (LRP) with two phases of imbalance between hemispheres preceding the target-related contralateral preponderance of negativity: first a negative, then a positive preponderance contralateral to prime direction. The present article provides evidence that the second wave is related to mask presentation and reflects inhibitory processing independent of reductions in prime visibility, even being evoked by nonmasking distractors that leave the prime fully accessible for consciousness. Of all hypotheses put forward to account for <b>inverse</b> effects inmasked <b>priming,</b> this finding is most compatible with the mask-triggered inhibition hypothesis suggested by P.

40|$|Though preschoolers {{in certain}} {{experimental}} contexts strongly prefer to interpret ambiguous sentences containing quantified NPs and negation {{on the basis}} of surface syntax (e. g., Musolino’s (1998) “observation of isomorphism”), contextual manipulations can lead to more adult-like behavior. But is isomorphism a purely pragmatic phenomenon, as recently proposed? In Experiment 1, we begin by isolating the contextual factor responsible for children’s improvement in Musolino and Lidz (2006). We then demonstrate in Experiment 2 that this factor can be used to <b>prime</b> <b>inverse</b> scope interpretations. To remove pragmatics from the equation altogether, we show in Experiment 3 that the same effect can be achieved via semantic priming. Our results represent the first clear evidence for priming of the abstract logico-syntactic structures underlying these interpretations and, thus, highlight the importance of language processing alongside pragmatic reasoning during children’s linguistic development.

40|$|Shor's quantum {{algorithm}} for discrete logarithms {{applied to}} elliptic curve groups {{forms the basis}} of a "quantum attack" of elliptic curve cryptosystems. To implement this algorithm on a quantum computer requires the efficient implementation of the elliptic curve group operation. Such an implementation requires we be able to compute inverses in the underlying field. In [PZ 03], Proos and Zalka show how to implement the extended Euclidean algorithm to compute <b>inverses</b> in the <b>prime</b> field GF(p). They employ a number of optimizations to achieve a running time of O(n^ 2), and a space-requirement of O(n) qubits (there are some trade-offs that they make, sacrificing a few extra qubits to reduce running-time). In practice, elliptic curve cryptosystems often use curves over the binary field GF(2 ^m). In this paper, we show how to implement the extended Euclidean algorithm for polynomials to compute inverses in GF(2 ^m). Working under the assumption that qubits will be an `expensive' resource in realistic implementations, we optimize specifically to reduce the qubit space requirement, while keeping the running-time polynomial. Our implementation here differs from that in [PZ 03] for GF(p), and we are {{able to take advantage of}} some properties of the binary field GF(2 ^m). We also optimize the overall qubit space requirement for computing the group operation for elliptic curves over GF(2 ^m) by decomposing the group operation to make it "piecewise reversible" (similar to what is done in [PZ 03] for curves over GF(p)) ...|$|R
40|$|The masked priming {{paradigm}} {{is a tool}} in which non-conscious information processing can be measured. In this paradigm a response target is affected by a preceding unseen stimulus causing a congruency effect on response times and accuracy. There are two current explanations for priming effects. The direct-response theory proposes that primes activate conditioned associations between target and response. The semantic theory proposes the prime information is first classified before affecting motor responses. In semantic studies the target stimuli are often repeated in the prime stimulus set. There have been claims that repeat primes are able to influence behaviour as direct-response priming, via automatisation. The current study investigated the method in which repeat and novel primes were processed by the novel manipulation of prime type by block and varying the prime-target stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs). At a long SOA direct-response <b>priming</b> <b>inverses,</b> while semantic does not, allowing discrimination between the two. A number classification task was used, with both novel and repeat primes in a short and long SOA condition. Congruency effects were established at the short SOA, but only novel primes produced an effect at the long SOA, while repeat primes were nullified. This was contrary to both the automatisation and the semantic experimental hypotheses. To investigate these results a follow-up experiment was conducted at an extended SOA. Contrary to both predictions priming was nullified for both prime types. This however, supported the semantic hypothesis, as {{there were no differences}} between prime types this was instead a reflection of the limits of semantic priming. The findings provide confirmatory evidence for semantic priming theory and addresses its criticisms. In turn this provides insight into the ability of the mind to process semantic information from subliminal information. i...|$|R
