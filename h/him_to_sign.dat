Gleijeses stated that while the freighter {{was on its way}} to Nicaragua, a CIA employee went to Miller, and asked <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>sign</b> a document on behalf of the munitions department. Miller refused, and instead showed the document to his superiors, who in turn informed Dean Acheson. Gleijeses writes that Acheson immediately spoke to Truman as a result of this document, and the operation was cut short. Nick Cullather writes that due to Somoza spreading the word about the coup, the State Department decided that the cover of the operation had been lost. Other diplomats began to learn of the operation, and on 8 October Dean Acheson summoned Smith and called off the operation.|$|E
5|$|Born in Waukegan, Illinois, Graham's first {{interest}} {{growing up}} was music. Encouraged by his parents, {{both of whom}} were music teachers, he took up several instruments: the piano, violin, cornet and French horn. Graham also excelled in athletics, and attended Northwestern University on a basketball scholarship in 1940. There he played on the varsity basketball team as a freshman and continued to study music. Graham did not take up football until his sophomore year, when Northwestern coach Pappy Waldorf saw him throwing in an intramural game and invited him to practice with the team. Northwestern's coaches were impressed with his running and passing, and Waldorf convinced <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>sign</b> up. Although football became Graham's primary sport, he also played baseball and continued on the basketball team. As a senior, he was named a first-team basketball All-American, part of a squad selected by news outlets comprising the best players at each position.|$|E

In the meantime, any party foraging outside of Buena Esperanza was ordered to consist of at least 20 members for defence from the hostile natives. A chaotic evacuation back to Trujillo began, and resentment against Cerezeda was such that he feared for his life and fled to Naco to seek refuge amongst friendly natives there. On 9 May, amidst this disordered Spanish retreat, García de Celís returned from Guatemala with news that help would soon be forthcoming.|$|E

5|$|Szilard {{drafted a}} {{confidential}} {{letter to the}} President, Franklin D. Roosevelt, warning of a German nuclear weapon project, explaining the possibility of nuclear weapons, and encouraging {{the development of a}} program that could result in their creation. With the help of Eugene Wigner and Edward Teller, he approached his old friend and collaborator Albert Einstein in August 1939, and convinced <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>sign</b> the letter, lending his prestige to the proposal. The Einstein–Szilard letter resulted in the establishment of research into nuclear fission by the U.S. government. An Advisory Committee on Uranium was formed under Lyman J. Briggs, a scientist {{and the director of the}} National Bureau of Standards. Its first meeting on 21 October 1939, was attended by Szilard, Teller and Wigner. The scientists persuaded the Army and Navy to provide $6,000 for Szilard to purchase supplies for experiments—in particular, more graphite.|$|E

5|$|The general {{success of}} William L. Mayo and his college even {{inflamed}} {{the passions of}} their competitors, most especially T. Henry Bridges, the head of Henry College in nearby Campbell. According to William E. Sawyer, {{in the aftermath of}} Reconstruction the Southern-educated Bridges viewed the Northern-educated Mayo as a carpetbagger. After a battle of words between the two college presidents in local newspaper columns, on August 24, 1896, Bridges drove into Commerce in his buggy to confront Mayo, first asking <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>sign</b> a statement retracting his written claims. When Mayo refused, Bridges drew his revolver on Mayo, and after he missed his target twice, Bridges proceeded to strike Mayo with 15 to 20 lashes of his whip. The disturbance attracted an angry mob of ETNC students, who drove Bridges out of town. Bridges' Henry College would ultimately become defunct in 1901.|$|E
5|$|Three {{years after}} joining the Carlone band, Como moved to Ted Weems's Orchestra {{and his first}} {{recording}} dates. Como and Weems met in 1936 while the Carlone orchestra was playing in Warren, Ohio. Perry initially {{did not take the}} offer to join Weems's orchestra. Apparently realizing it was the best move for his young vocalist, Freddy Carlone urged <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>sign</b> with Weems. Art Jarrett had just left the Weems organization to start his own band. Weems was in need of a vocalist; Como got a raise, as Weems paid him $50 per week, and his first chance for nationwide exposure. Ted Weems and his orchestra were based in Chicago, and were regulars on radio shows such as The Jack Benny Program and Fibber McGee and Molly. The Weems band also had its own weekly radio program on the Mutual Broadcasting System from 1936 – 1937.|$|E
5|$|Charlton took {{advice from}} Celtic manager Jock Stein, who allowed <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>sign</b> right-sided midfielder Bobby Murdoch on a free transfer. Besides Murdoch the club already had ten players who Charlton moulded into a {{championship}} winning side: Jim Platt (goalkeeper), John Craggs (right-back), Stuart Boam and Willie Maddren (centre-backs), Frank Spraggon (left-back), David Armstrong (left midfield), Graeme Souness (central midfield), Alan Foggon (attacking midfield), John Hickton and David Mills (forwards). Some of these players were already settled {{at the club}} and in their positions, whilst Charlton {{had to work with}} some of the other players. He moved Souness from left midfield to central midfield to compensate for his lack of pace and coached him to play the ball forward rather than side to side as was his instinct. Foggon was played in a new role which Charlton created to break the offside trap set by opposition defenders, an extremely fast player he was instructed to run behind defenders and latch on to the long ball to find himself one-on-one with the goalkeeper.|$|E

5|$|The {{season after}} Given's arrival saw Blackburn win the Premier League title and Given {{was unable to}} oust first-choice goalkeeper and England {{international}} Tim Flowers from the team. He made two loan moves to Swindon Town. Given acted as understudy during his first spell at the Wiltshire club but helped them start their Championship winning Division Two campaign during the 1995–96 season. He played in five games for Swindon before returning to Blackburn {{at the end of}} 1995. Given was sent on loan again in January 1996, this time to Division One side Sunderland. Given kept 12 clean sheets during his 17 games for the club, and formed part of the team who won promotion to the Premier League as champions. His performances on loan impressed Kenny Dalglish, who had recently been appointed manager of Newcastle United, and prompted <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>sign</b> Given again. Given signed for the North-East club in the summer of 1997 for a fee of £1.5million. Given had earlier made his Premier League debut for Blackburn in a game against Wimbledon on 14 December 1996.|$|E
5|$|Bertram meets Raimbaut, who {{has arrived}} for an {{assignation}} with Alice. He {{gives him a}} bag of gold and advises him not to marry Alice as his new wealth will attract plenty of women (Ah! l’honnête homme). Raimbaut leaves and Bertram gloats at having corrupted him. Bertram reveals that Robert, to whom he is truly devoted, is his son; he then enters an adjoining cave to commune with the spirits of hell. Alice enters and expresses her love for Raimbaut (Quand je quittai la Normandie). She overhears strange chanting coming from the cave and decides to listen; she learns that Bertram will lose Robert forever if he cannot persuade <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>sign</b> away his soul to the Devil by midnight. On emerging from the cave, Bertram realizes that Alice has heard everything (Mais Alice, qu’as-tu donc?). He threatens her and she promises to keep silent. Robert arrives, mourning the loss of Isabelle, and Bertram tells him that to win her he should seize a magic branch from the tomb of Saint Rosalia in a nearby deserted cloister. Although to take it is sacrilege, the branch will give Robert magical powers. Robert declares {{that he will be}} bold and do as Bertram instructs. Bertram leads Robert to the cloister. The ghosts of nuns rise from their tombs, beckoned by Bertram, and dance, praising the pleasures of drinking, gambling and lust. Robert seizes the branch and fends off the demons who surround him.|$|E
5|$|The naval {{section of}} Alsos flew into Paris soon {{after it had}} been liberated in August 1944. They went down to Bordeaux to inspect the {{captured}} German destroyer Z39. After the Alsos Mission became convinced that the Germans had not developed an atomic bomb, the naval section became the Naval Technical Mission Europe. They were {{particularly interested in the}} work of Dr Hellmuth Walter in the development of submarines and rockets. Most of the targets that they were interested in lay in the British sector, so they worked closely with their English allies. In {{the last days of the}} war, the Naval Technical Mission was part of a 75-man task force, most of whom were from 30 Assault Unit, that made a dash for Kiel, entering the city far in advance of the Allied advance. The whole garrison of the city, some 150,000 men, surrendered to the task force. They drove to Admiral Karl Dönitz's headquarters in Flensburg, where they saw but did not speak with him, as Dönitz was on his way to surrender. They spoke instead to Admiral Otto Backenköhler, and persuaded <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>sign</b> a release for German scientists, so men like Walter could freely discuss their work with the Allies. From April to December 1945, Mumma also served as assistant naval attaché.|$|E
