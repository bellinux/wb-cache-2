40|$|The EU took clear {{steps to}} {{suppress}} and abandon {{the intervention of}} maize in 2006. Originally the measure should have been revised {{in the course of}} the “Health Check”. But the European Commission (EC) rendered the minimal quality requirement for maize stricter in the intervention period starting 1 November 2006. Later the EC proposed to finish the intervention of maize. According to that decision the intervention of maize exists in the marketing year of 2007 / 08 and 2008 / 09 with a quantity limitation but it finishes in the marketing year of 2009 / 10. The EC argues for the abandonment of maize intervention, because, intervention stocks of cereals have increased significantly after the accession of the 10 new member states (EU- 10), and the balance of the maize market is at risk. This measure is aimed to get back the intervention to its original purpose, as a safety net. We prove in this study that the <b>intervention</b> <b>stock</b> of cereal has not significantly increased after the enlargement in 2004 and it is not a reason for finishing maize intervention. The <b>intervention</b> <b>stock</b> of maize has increased since 2004 but not so significantly that it could be a reason for the abandonment of maize intervention. cereal, intervention, maize, stock, Agricultural and Food Policy, Agricultural Finance,...|$|E
40|$|The high {{increase}} in the prices of cereals, meat, and building materials {{is due to the}} weakness of stocks, increased exports, and the increase of internal demand. To attenuate the effect of the high {{increase in}} the price of cereals, meat and cement, the following measures are necessary: • Import important quantities of maize • Draw down on the national security stock, in consultation with the donors. • Reduce the price of animal feeds through reduction in the price of cotton-seed from the state-run cotton ginning facilities • Reduce slaughter fees • Reduce the cost of transportation through reduction in taxes on fuel and spare parts, and • Reduce the tariff on imports of cement Elements of a medium-term strategy to hold down food prices include: • At the production level, focus on better water management, the organization and training of farmers in improved techniques, and the development of the input markets as first priorities. • At the marketing level, take actions to facilitate domestic trade of cereals within the country, reduce barriers to external trade, and promote a series of actions to develop further cereals and livestock processing within the country. • At the consumption level, promote creation of consumer cooperatives, create a second <b>intervention</b> <b>stock,</b> and promote employment generation.

40|$|The latest USDA {{review reports}} {{difficult}} {{conditions in the}} EU dairy sector in {{the first eight months}} of 2002. Mild weather conditions, quota increases and the number of animals retained on farm as a result of BSE and FMD restrictions saw an increase in EU milk production, although the situation varied from country to country. With exports sluggish, massive quantities of butter and skimmed milk powder were taken into intervention. In the autumn of 2002 the EU dairy market situation improved significantly as exports rose on the back of higher export refunds (increases for butter occurred in January and for cheese in May). Russia remains a major market for EU dairy exports. In 2003 it is anticipated that the market situation will be more stable, with consumption expanding (partly as a result of specialist coffee shops) and exports remaining at current levels.

40|$|When the European Economic Community (EEC) —today’s European Union (EU) —created its common {{agricultural}} policy (CAP) in the 1960 s and 1970 s it paid scant regard {{to the interests of}} other nations. That ‘old’ CAP attempted to increase farm incomes by manipulating farm-gate prices, while a nascent, but rather ineffectual, structural policy sought to improve the competitive structure of European agriculture. Details differed from one product to another, but market price support meant in the main that imports were heavily taxed, exports subsidised and <b>intervention</b> <b>stocks</b> accumulated. When, in 1973, the EEC was enlarged with the accession of Denmark, Ireland and the United Kingdom (UK) —the latter a major importer of agricultural products from world markets—trade diversion was inevitable, and Australia in particular found its agricultural products displaced from the UK market. The CAP’s escalating budgetary costs in the 1980 s led to some half-hearted attempts at reform, but it was the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations {{under the auspices of the}} General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) that triggered a succession of ‘reforms’ that significantly changed the CAP’s policy mechanisms, while retaining its core focus of farm income support. The latest recalibration of the CAP, in 2013, established the policy framework for the period 2014 – 20.

40|$|At {{the end of}} 2001 the USDA Foreign Agricultural Service {{reported}} a dramatically smaller EU crop and little demand for EU wheat given the relative high price of unsubsidised EU wheat compared to the abundant supplies of cheaper wheat from eastern Europe. As a consequence in 2001 EU exports of wheat were down 30 % compared to 1999. Indeed, falling EU import duties and relatively high internal prices were stimulating flows of wheat into the EU. This trend continued into 2002. In February 2001 the USDA FAS reported that the EU was importing unusually large quantities of wheat, barley and rye, Import licences {{for the first six}} months of 2002 have therefore exceeded export licences.

40|$|The European Union Food Distribution {{programme}} for the Most Deprived Persons (MDP) of {{the community}} ran from 1987 until 2013. It was funded from Common Agricultural Policy budgets. The programme initially made use of surplus foods from the food mountains resulting from <b>intervention</b> <b>stocks.</b> This food was then distributed through aid agencies within member states, coordinated at a national government level. Reform of the CAP and global rises in food prices resulted {{in an increase in}} budget from € 300 to € 500 million Euros in 2010 with the added power to buy food on the open market. This led to a formal challenge to the scheme on the basis that buying goods on the open market shifted the emphasis from an agricultural/financial basis to a social one. A court ruling found that because the program was no longer used for removing surpluses the link to agriculture policy has become tenuous and therefore had no basis in community law. As a result of this legal challenge a number of policy compromises ensured the MDP would continue until the end of 2013 with a reduced budget. The scheme has been superseded by a new scheme in March 2014 called the Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived (FEAD). This is seen as a social programme. The way that policy and politics developed and changed the MDP programme are set out. The article tracks its move from being an agricultural policy to a social welfare one. The key policy players and actors in this move are set out as are the changing context and policy frameworks.

40|$|Reports {{from the}} USDA (United States Department of Agriculture) suggest that EU beef {{production}} will be lower in 2003 {{as a result}} of a reduction in both the dairy and beef herds. However, EU beef exports are expected to increase as import restrictions arising from animal disease problems in the EU are lifted. Sales from <b>intervention</b> <b>stocks</b> are likely to continue into 2003. Some beef bought in under the 'special purchase scheme' has already been sent abroad as food aid (to North Korea). It is expected that the market effects of the BSE crisis will continue to fade in 2003 with implications for poultry and pork consumption in the EU. Beef prices in some EU countries have returned to pre-BSE levels. In the long term, however, beef consumption is expected to decline as consumers in France and the UK switch to other meats. Germany, Spain, Ireland and Italy could, however, see some marginal increase in beef consumption. In budgetary terms EU expenditure in the meat sector is expected to grow {{as a result of}} higher export refund allocations to make EU meat exports price competitive, and increased direct aid premiums arising form the Agenda 2000 reforms.

This paper analyzes the impact on deforestation of such policy instruments in a dynamic framework. The forest is modelled as a potentially renewable resource, and timber is extracted for purposes of export and domestic consumption. Optimality conditions for a variety of model specifications are derived, and the impacts of changes in the terms of trade and market structure on long-run deforestation are analyzed. The results of this analysis suggest that trade interventions that seek to affect the terms of trade against the export of tropical timber products are in the long run a second-best policy option for influencing the deforestation process.

40|$|At {{the end of}} October 2003 the USDA Foreign Agricultural Service {{released}} its annual report on the EU's dairy sector. The report notes that {{in a context of}} fixed quotas and increasing yields, the size of the EU dairy herd is continuing to decline. While EU milk production is fairly constant, EU cheese production continues on an upward trend due to its profitability relative to butter and milk powder production. This profitability is supported in large part by an expansion of exports. In 2003 EU- 15 cheese exports to third countries reportedly increased by 4 % to some 490, 000 tonnes. The main export markets are Japan, Croatia, Mexico and, in particular, Russia. Butter exports are also expected to increase, largely on the back of German and Dutch sales to Egypt, Japan, Algeria and Russia. EU milk powder exports are expected to increase by 50 % to 240, 000 tonnes. This trend is driven by limited availability on world markets arising from the Australian drought. However trends vary from country to country, with Irish exports down, and Dutch, French and German exports up. The major destinations for these exports are Mexico, east Asia, and within the ACP group, Nigeria. The expansion of EU exports will however be short-lived as Australia 's industry recovers from the drought. Overall, EU <b>intervention</b> <b>stocks</b> in the dairy sector are expected to rise in the face of increased imports from Oceania and poorer conditions on the EU- 15 butter market. EU consumption of liquid milk is rising slightly {{on the back of the}} increasing popularity of coffee shops in Germany and Sweden. Comment: Two major points should be noted: first the importance of the Russian market; should a situation emerge which restricted access to the Russian market then large volumes of EU dairy products would be looking for a new home; second, the upsurge in EU milk powder exports does not reflect any increased competitiveness of the EU dairy sector but rather adverse supply conditions elsewhere.

Stocking of larger fingerlings at suitable stocking densities of endemic (rohu, catla, mrigal) and exotic (silver carp, bighead carp, common carp/mirror carp) species should be stocked at varying proportion. Floodplain fish production depends only on the natural fertility of the water bodies. Technological interventions should include the installation of low cost bamboo fencing at water inlet and outlet points and setting of ring culverts for maintaining suitable levels of water for fish culture without hampering the production of rice and other crops in the <b>intervention</b> areas, selective <b>stocking</b> with native and exotic carps, restricted fishing for {{certain period of time}} and guarding.

40|$|The article {{describes}} the evolution and future of the set-aside system of the European Union. The focus is on Finland s integration to the system. The future developments are evaluated from Finland s point of view. To {{be eligible for the}} compensatory payments introduced as part of the CAP reform for arable crops, producers must set aside a portion of their arable land with a view to achieving a better balance between production and domestic and international demand. The set-aside rate was fixed at 15 % for the rotational set-aside and 20 % (18 % in the UK and Denmark) for other forms of set-aside. The set-aside requirements do not appeal small producers producing less than 92 tons cereals a year. Because of bad harvests in certain areas of the world combined with effective production control measures, for the marketing year 1995 / 96, the set-aside rate was cut to 12 % (15 % and 17 %). During the year 1995, the <b>intervention</b> <b>stocks</b> of cereals continuously decreased and world market prices increased. Consequently, the EU decided to cut the set-aside rate to 10 % for the 1996 / 97 marketing year. As usual, the reduction only applies for the 1996 / 97 marketing year. For the year 1997 / 98, the portion will automatically revert to 15 % (and 18 % and 20 %). The cut of set-aside rate serve the interest of major cereals- producing countries. Finland is obliged to pay her share of the costs without getting any advantage. Finland s interest would probably be to increase the set-aside rate. This is because, within a certain range, (a) the change of the obligatory set-aside rate barely affects the set-aside area in Finland; (b) the change of the obligatory set-aside rate barely affects the cereals production in Finland; and (c) the change of the cereals-production area barely affects the farm income in Finland. The discussion concerning the future development of the EU set-aside system should include the following themes: (a) is the current cereals shortage a temporal or continuous phenomenon; (b) as a high set-aside rate helps to keep cereal prices up, farmers would gain in the form of high producer prices and the tax payers would gain in the form of low export subsidies (or high export taxes); (c) because the increase of set-aside rate is more difficult than the cut, the cuts should be postpo ned if possible; (b) an alternative way to increase production is to rise the farm-by-farm ceiling of 92 tons (that makes the set-aside obligatory), rather than to cut the set-aside rate; and (e) for environmental reasons, the set-aside area shou ld be covered with plants. vokMTT Taloustutkimus (MTTL) The temporal cut of the EU set-aside requirements for the 1996 / 97 marketing year: consequences for Finlan...|$|R

We aim to describe staff experiences of providing maternal care in rural health facilities in Southern Tanzania, focusing on issues related to equipment, drugs and supplies. METHODS: Focus group discussions and in-depth {{interviews were conducted with}} different staff cadres from all facility levels in order to explore experiences and views of providing maternity care in the context of poorly maintained equipment, and insufficient drugs and other supplies. A facility survey quantified the availability of relevant items. RESULTS: The facility survey, which found many missing or broken items and frequent stock outs, corroborated staff reports of providing care in the context of missing or broken care items. Staff reported increased workloads, reduced morale, difficulties in providing optimal maternity care, and carrying out procedures that carried potential health risks to themselves as a result. CONCLUSIONS: Inadequately stocked and equipped facilities compromise the health system's ability to reduce maternal and neonatal mortality and morbidity by affecting staff personally and professionally, which hinders the provision of timely and appropriate <b>interventions.</b> Improving <b>stock</b> control and maintaining equipment could benefit mothers and babies, not only through removing restrictions to the availability of care, but also through improving staff working conditions...|$|R
40|$|Wilderness stream {{crossings}} used by mules, horses, and hikers are localized disturbances {{that may}} affect habitat immediately downstream, but the potential influence of fords on streams has received little investigation, particularly in terms of possible effects on fauna. Our overall null hypothesis was absence of below-above differences for either benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages or habitat characteristics at such fords. We further sought to determine (1) whether any such differences were present prior to annual use, suggesting longer-term effects, and (2) whether differences were present in late season, after annual use. We examined macroinvertebrates and habitat immediately below and above 2 fords crossing subalpine streams in Yosemite National Park in the Sierra Nevada (California, USA) in earlyand late season and over 2 years. There were both longer-term below-above differences, as well as differences thatbecame apparent in late season, {{both of which were}} indicative of below-ford effects. Below fords there was evidence,either as main effects or interactions, of higher silt, sand, and gravel cover; a thicker periphyton layer; a greater Hilsenhoffbiotic index; a higher proportion of tolerant taxa; higher chironomid midge and total densities; and greater speciesrichness, largely a function of chironomid richness. There was also a lower expected number of species, a smaller proportionof sensitive taxa and predators, and lower densities of some sensitive Ephemeroptera (mayflies) and Plecoptera (stoneflies) below fords. Both hikers and stock may contribute to the apparent effects, but management <b>interventions</b> targeting <b>stock</b> may be particularly achievable. Among other approaches, simply halting stock strings briefly before reaching fords should reduce the volume of urine and feces directly entering streams, and handlers can expedite crossings if watering is not necessary...|$|R
40|$|The {{role of the}} Prague Commodity and Stock Exchange {{was quite}} {{specific}} during the existence {{of what is known}} as the Second Czechoslovak Republic and, in particular, during the occupation of the remaining part of the country by Nazi Germany, reflecting the extraordinary time context. The liberal principles of its operation were restricted and subject to the controlled war-oriented efforts. The racial discrimination laws and the Third Reich loyalty requirements had impacts on personal and organizational matters. Within the so-called "internal aryanization" of the Prague Commodity and Stock Exchange, pursuant to the general policy of "expulsion" of Jews from the economic life in the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, Jews were excluded from its bodies and were even not allowed to enter the Stock Exchange. The Stock Exchange Chamber as the leading body of the Prague Stock Exchange was "complemented" with Germans, who then constituted one half of its members. In addition, a special German arbitration court of the Prague Stock Exchange was set up that was obliged to notify the Reichsprotektor as chief representative of the German occupation authorities in the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia of its activities. The exchange business was limited in 1940 - 1945 and the public bond transactions virtually "fell down". Thus, the Prague Stock Exchange played rather a secondary role in the process of transformation of joint stock companies in favor of Germans (i. e., in their germanization). In some cases, however, the penetration of German business elements into the Stock Exchange institutes and the <b>interventions</b> in <b>stock</b> transactions made it possible to acquire an interest that played an important, and even decisive role in the germanization of a particular company. Prague Commodity and Stock Exchange, germanization of joint stock companies, Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia...|$|R
40|$|The {{topic is}} {{intentionally}} controversial. Prices {{on a number}} of food types used for biofuel have doubled in last couple of years. In the same time oil price is soaring. Many factors are contributing to the rise of food prices: the biggest is escalating demand. In recent years the economies of the world developing countries have been growing about 7 percent a year; other factors are droughts, new deregulation in agricultural policies (less <b>intervention</b> lowering <b>stock</b> levels), US dollar weakness benefiting commodity prices as safe haven asset and increase production costs like energy inputs. The explanation of the increases of oils prices are very close: the growth of new developing countries, political instability in fuel exporting countries, the loss of faith in US currency, the low investments in prospecting and refining of fuel. The use of renewable biofuels in lieu of fuel to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase energy security. Brazil produces 5 billions gal (19 millions hL) of sugarcane ethanol, enough to supply 45 % of its transportation fuel demands. This production needs 6 millions hectares on a total of 400 millions ha for farming. In EU the proportion area devoted to biofuels is 1 %. In US, at the same time substantial price rises for maize, the main raw material for the US ethanol. The expected reduction in US maize exports would weigh heavily on the already tight supply on international grain market. In any event, even if maize yields were to achieve the require increase, the United States might have to limit exports in order to achieve its ambitious biofuels targets. The competition between food uses and biofuels is depending of the speed of development of second generation cellulosic and biomass based biofuels and of the purpose of US authorities to improve the level of grains stocks as corn, wheat and soya...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of a project dealing with the structural characteristics of a silver fir (Abies alba Mill.) -dominated stand (including Norway spruce, European larch, European beech, hornbeam, etc. as secondary tree species), 25 years old and naturally regenerated by uniform shelterwood cuttings. In spring 2012, three research & demonstration plots (RDP 1, 2, and 3) of 450 sq. m, 400 sq. m and 300 sq. m were established. In RDP 1 and RDP 2 cleaning-respacing interventions with different silvicultural objectives and intensities were carried out while RDP 3 was kept as control. In all plots, potential final crop trees (between 400 and 489 trees/ha), mostly of silver fir, were selected based on the vigour-quality-spacing criteria. The main results of the field measurements and office analyses are as follows:- owing to the exceptional regeneration potential of silver fir, as well as its high shade-tolerance, the initial stocking of living trees was over 10, 000 stems in all plots. After <b>intervention</b> the <b>stocking</b> varies between 1, 350 trees/ha in RDP 2 and 10, 032 trees/ha in control plot;- following intervention stand basal area was reduced to 10. 87 sq. m/ha (RDP 2) and 20, 25 sq. m/ha (RDP 1); basal area shows the maximum value in control plot (31. 65 sq. m/ha);- the mean diameter ranges between 5. 60 cm (control plot) and 10. 19 cm (RDP 2);- the mean height is less variable than the mean diameter and ranges between 7. 56 m (control plot) and 8. 42 m (RDP 2);- the mean slenderness index h/d is the highest (over 130) in control plot and lowest (96) in RDP 2;- the variability of potential final crop trees in terms of their mean diameter, mean height and mea...|$|R
