25|$|Since {{the wooden}} or metal form that {{supported}} the casting of the concrete was elevated, the forms were supported on falsework, in this case using vertical pipe sections, steel beams, and diagonal cables.

50|$|Engineers later {{determined}} that <b>the</b> bridge section, <b>erected</b> over <b>the</b> {{water from the}} Hartford side, fell {{as a result of}} movement in <b>the</b> <b>falsework,</b> <b>the</b> temporary steel and wood structure used to support the bridge girders until enough had been <b>erected</b> to reach <b>the</b> next pier.

50|$|The company Kellogg Bridge Co. {{undertook}} to construct for the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway Company an iron bridge across Maumee River at Toledo, Ohio. After doing {{a portion of}} the work it entered into a written contract with Hamilton (a subcontractor) for the completion of the bridge. The bridge was put up in several spans and in order to support <b>the</b> spans, <b>falsework,</b> consisting of piles driven in the river between the piers upon which the spans were to rest, was needed. The Bridge Company had previously constructed a part of <b>the</b> <b>falsework</b> involved in {{between the first and second}} spans, which Hamilton paid for as he had agreed to do. A part of <b>the</b> <b>falsework</b> put up by the company sank under the weight of the first span and was replaced by Hamilton. When the second fixed span was about two-thirds complete, ice in the river broke up due to a flood and <b>the</b> <b>falsework</b> was carried away causing the whole of the iron material in place on that span to fall into the river. If the piles had been driven in more firmly, they would have withstood the force of the ice and the flood. Hamilton was subject to delay of the completion of the bridge and increased expense.|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>falsework,</b> {{which had}} already {{been used in the}} {{construction}} of the Halen Bridge in Kirchlindach, Bern, originated, as with the Langwieser Viaduct, from Richard Coray of Trin. The structure was built by the firm Müller, Zeerleder und Gobat.|$|R
50|$|At {{the time}} of its erection, the Langwieser Viaduct was the longest railway bridge in the world.

5000|$|A $100,000 inquest {{into the}} {{collapse}} heard testimony from over seventy witnesses and {{was completed in}} November.

The inquest found that the weight of concrete being placed to form the bridge deck exceeded the weight that the supports could hold, and that a second collapse was imminent as supports near the collapsed area showed signs of buckling.

40|$|Scaffolds and shoring {{systems are}} {{generally}} {{referred to as}} <b>the</b> <b>falsework</b> in bridge construction, serving as temporary structures to support bridge span construction. <b>The</b> <b>falsework</b> cost usually accounts for 50 - 70 % of the total project concrete budget. Falsework installation and advancing methods can greatly impact the completion time and actual cost. Thus, simulation can be instrumental in planning bridge construction operations and analyzing various options by evaluating postulated “what-if ” scenarios. This study uses a previously constructed bridge in Sweden {{as a case study}} to test three feasible construction sequence alternatives. One of these alternatives was implemented on the actual construction of this bridge. Modeling was performed in Simphony, which captures the unique construction sequence requirements and constraints, resulting in project durations for each alternative. Results from simulation experiments were corroborated by the construction engineer who had worked on the bridge project in terms of the advantages that each alternative method possesses. ...|$|R
50|$|A {{painting}} by Karl Blechen circa 1833 illustrating {{construction of the}} second Devil's Bridge (Teufelsbrücke) in the Schöllenen Gorge shows multiple king posts suspended from the apex of <b>the</b> <b>falsework</b> upon which <b>the</b> masonry arch has been laid.

5000|$|After the buttresses were completed, the {{construction}} crews could then begin building <b>the</b> <b>falsework</b> on which <b>the</b> concrete would harden. While the concrete was drying, {{the roof was}} supported by a central steel tower, the buttresses around the periphery, a circular timber tower about 135 ft from the center, and two movable timber scaffolds at the midpoints of 120 ft and 60 ft-span joists. [...] These supports totaled at 800000 sq ft of wooden scaffolding. [...] To aid in construction of the roof, a temporary steel tower was <b>erected</b> in <b>the</b> center of the stadium. As mentioned in the foundation section, the contractors decided not to fully excavate the interior of the building {{in order to reduce the}} required height of the steel tower and allow more surface area for construction crews. This decision decreased the tower height to only 100 ft thus decreased cost.|$|R
50|$|The Walnut Lane Bridge has {{a history}} of tragedies and deaths since {{construction}} began in 1906. In December 1907, <b>the</b> <b>falsework</b> (used to support the forms for pouring concrete) collapsed and sent about 20 workers plunging 150 ft into the Wissahickon Creek. Martin Simpson was listed as the only worker to die during the tragedy while Bernard Mers lost an arm and James Lawson had both of his hands crushed. The crash drew neighbors out of their homes, as the sound could be heard throughout the valley.|$|R
40|$|Falsework is a {{temporary}} scaffold-like architectural support {{which is used to}} hold elements in place during construction and until they become self supporting. Paul Cullen’s Falsework sculptures are makeshift constructions in which items of furniture are inverted and supported off the floor and against the ceiling. These sculptures could be said to model the unlikely situation in which gravity is suspended and objects are able to float free from their usual restraints. Or they could be regarded as modelling {{a situation in which the}} inverse of the everyday, in which objects sit upon the floor, is presented. The do-it-yourself aesthetic of these sculptures has a basis in the drawings of Heath Robinson and Rube Goldberg. Both men drew complex, makeshift and illogical devices designed to perform simple tasks by indirect means and to represent the application of irrational principles to the pursuit of rational outcomes. <b>The</b> <b>Falsework</b> sculptures are improvised constructions of relationships between ordinary objects reliant, like the whimsies of Goldberg and Robinson, on impractical and makeshift means. Although they are model-like, <b>the</b> <b>Falsework</b> sculptures only imitate the act of representation up to a certain point; they serve no real purpose and instead refer insistently to the processes of their own making and materiality...|$|R
40|$|Closed access. Bridge {{construction}} always involves <b>falsework</b> erection. <b>The</b> <b>falsework</b> scaffolding used in Hong Kong gave a lower {{failure load}} than the supplier’s figure and the used frames have their loadbearing capacity reduced with age of materials. Sixty-two bridge collapses during construction in twenty-two countries or cities were studied and analysed. More {{than half of}} the collapses were falsework-related failures and occurred during concreting, placing of bridge segments and redistribution of major forces. The permanent works failed mainly due to insufficient consideration of stresses generated and instability of the structural member during construction...|$|R
50|$|Julius W. Adams, the superintending {{engineer}} {{of construction}} in the area, hired James P. Kirkwood, a civil engineer who had previously worked on the Long Island Rail Road. Accounts differ as to whether Kirkwood worked on the bridge himself, or whether Adams {{was responsible for the}} plans with Kirkwood working as a subordinate. It took 800 workers, each paid about $1 per day, equal to $ per day today, to complete the bridge in a year. <b>The</b> <b>falsework</b> for <b>the</b> bridge required {{more than half a million}} feet of cored and hewn timbers.|$|R
5000|$|Construction {{began on}} July 5, 1906 and was {{completed}} on October 14, 1908. Over 40,000 tons of rubble concrete (containing {{a great amount}} of large stones, for greater shear strength) were poured into <b>the</b> <b>falsework,</b> which had been built from steel bents 20 ft high and [...] of timber, weighing about 900 tons. The bridge's six spans total 585 ft. Very little use was made of reinforcing steel, which was scarce at the time. The roadway is 40 ft wide, flanked by 10 ft reinforced-concrete sidewalks and pre-cast concrete balustrades.|$|R
40|$|Modern {{building}} construction {{is divided into}} two main types,- steel frame buildings with reinforced concrete floors, and buildings wholly constructed of reinforced concrete. In the steel frame building <b>the</b> steel is <b>erected,</b> forming a skeleton, after which the concrete floor slabs and the haunching around the beams are poured; the forms are generally supported by the steel beams themselves. The practice of supporting the forms in this way eliminates much of <b>the</b> <b>falsework</b> facilitating thereby free movement of men and materials on the floor below. This is a much safer method of construction than reinforced concrete which requires <b>the</b> use of <b>falsework</b> until <b>the</b> concrete is set. However, {{in the design of the}} steel frame building no consideration is given to the aduitional strength due to this encasing concrete. [ [...] . ...|$|R

5|$|As far {{as can be}} determined, between arches 2 to 21, {{the outer}} facing of the {{superstructure}} consists of four layers of brick, followed by layers of rough stonemasonry bound with mortar. In contrast, between arches 22 and 26, {{as well as in}} both ramps on either end, the facing consists of ashlar blocks. The two repaired arches 27a and 27b are differentiated from the earlier work through the use of smaller unworked stones and the incorporation of irregularly placed brick tiles. In arch 26, the lower side of the arch still features a projecting bearing used for the placement of <b>the</b> <b>falsework.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{difficult}} {{crossing of}} the Alpine divide started in 1971. On 16 May 1975, within the section between Gmünd and Spittal, <b>the</b> <b>falsework</b> of a newly built bridge collapsed and fell from a height of 50 m, killing ten workers. The Spittal junction opened in 1980; the A10 down to Villach was completed in 1988. After eight people died in a 1999 fire in the Tauern Tunnel following a truck accident, the single-bore tunnels were expanded at a total cost of 324 million euros. Traffic congestion now occurs at the Karawanken Tunnel further to the south.|$|R
50|$|When {{construction}} on the new bridge started in 1989, the builders built {{the first half of}} the new bridge while keeping the old bridge in service. Unfortunately, an accident ended up delaying construction. <b>The</b> <b>falsework</b> for one of the arches collapsed on April 24, 1990, causing the arch itself to collapse, killing construction worker Robert A. Moser. Later, when it came time to demolish the old bridge, crews tried to take it down with explosives, but the first effort didn't bring the bridge down. It took another, more powerful batch of explosives to bring the old bridge down a few weeks later.|$|R
