The spatial distribution of forces can be measured with pedobarography equipment. Adding this to the known dynamics of each body segment enables the solution of equations based on the Newton–Euler equations of motion permitting computations of the net forces and the net moments of force about each joint at every stage of the <b>gait</b> <b>cycle.</b> The computational method for {{this is known as}} inverse dynamics.|$|E
2500|$|The word walk is {{descended from}} the Old English wealcan [...] "to roll". In humans and other bipeds, walking is {{generally}} distinguished from running in that only one foot at a time leaves contact with the ground {{and there is a}} period of double-support. In contrast, running begins when both feet are off the ground with each step. This distinction has the status of a formal requirement in competitive walking events. For quadrupedal species, there are numerous gaits which may be termed walking or running, and distinctions based upon {{the presence or absence of}} a suspended phase or the number of feet in contact any time do not yield mechanically correct classification. [...] The most effective method to distinguish walking from running is to measure the height of a person's centre of mass using motion capture or a force plate at midstance. During walking, the centre of mass reaches a maximum height at midstance, while during running, it is then at a minimum. This distinction, however, only holds true for locomotion over level or approximately level ground. For walking up grades above 9%, this distinction no longer holds for some individuals. Definitions based on the percentage of the stride during which a foot is in contact with the ground (averaged across all feet) of greater than 50% contact corresponds well with identification of 'inverted pendulum' mechanics and are indicative of walking for animals with any number of limbs, although this definition is incomplete. Running humans and animals may have contact periods greater than 50% of a <b>gait</b> <b>cycle</b> when rounding corners, running uphill or carrying loads.|$|E

40|$|Human {{locomotion}} is {{a complex}} motor task. Previous research hypothesized that muscle synergies reflect the modular control of muscle groups operated by the Central Nervous System (CNS). Despite the high stride-to-stride variability characterizing human gait, most studies analyze only a few strides. This may be limiting, because the intra-subject variability of motor output is neglected. This gap could be filled by recording and analyzing many <b>gait</b> <b>cycles</b> during a single walking task. In this way, it can be investigated if CNS recruits the same muscle synergies consistently or if different strategies are adopted during the locomotion task. The aim of this work is to investigate the intra-subject consistency of muscle synergies during overground walking. Twelve young healthy volunteers were instructed to walk for 5 min at their natural pace. On the average, 181 ± 10 <b>gait</b> <b>cycles</b> were analyzed for each subject. Surface electromyography was recorded from 12 muscles of the dominant lower limb and the trunk. <b>Gait</b> <b>cycles</b> were grouped into subgroups containing 10 <b>gait</b> <b>cycles</b> each. The consistency of the muscle synergies extracted during the gait trial was assessed by measuring cosine similarity (CS) of muscle weights vectors, and zero-lag cross-correlation (CC) of activation signals. The average intra-subject CS and CC were 0. 94 ± 0. 10 and 0. 96 ± 0. 06, respectively. We found five synergies shared by all the subjects: high consistency values were found for these synergies (CS = 0. 96 ± 0. 05, CC = 0. 97 ± 0. 03). In addition, we found 10 subject-specific synergies. These synergies were less consistent (CS = 0. 80 ± 0. 20, CC = 0. 89 ± 0. 14). In conclusion, our results demonstrated that shared muscle synergies were highly consistent during walking. Subject-specific muscle synergies were also consistent, although to a lesser extent...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Previous {{literature}} {{hypothesized that}} Winters type I are mainly {{characterized by a}} hypo-activation of dorsiflexors and type II by hyperactivation of plantarflexors around initial contact. However, it is currently not known if hemiplegic children belonging to the same Winters class really share the same muscle activation patterns, although this information might have relevant clinical implications in the patient management. Methods Gait data of 38 hemiplegic cerebral palsy children (16 Winters type I, 22 Winters type II) were analyzed, focusing on the foot and shank. A 2. 5 -minute walk test was considered, corresponding to more than 100 <b>gait</b> <b>cycles</b> for each child, analyzing the muscle activation patterns of tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius lateralis. The large stride-to-stride variability of gait data was handled in an innovative way, processing separately: 1) distinct foot-floor contact patterns, and for each specific foot-floor contact pattern 2) distinct muscle "activation modalities", averaging only across <b>gait</b> <b>cycles</b> with {{the same number of}} activations, and obtaining, in both cases, the pattern frequency-of-occurrence. Findings At least 2 representative foot-floor contact patterns within each Winters group, and up to 4 - 5 distinct muscle activation patterns were documented.

5000|$|The gluteus medius is very {{important}} during the stance phase of the <b>gait</b> <b>cycle</b> to maintain both hips at the same level. Moreover, one leg stance accounts for about 60% of the <b>gait</b> <b>cycle.</b> Furthermore, during the stance phase of the <b>gait</b> <b>cycle,</b> there is approximately three times the body weight transmitted to the hip joint. [...] The hip abductors' action accounts for two thirds of that body weight. The Trendelenburg sign {{is said to be}} positive if, when standing on one leg, the pelvis drops on the side opposite to the stance leg to reduce the load by decreasing the lever arm. By reducing the lever arm, this decreases the work load on the hip abductors. The muscle weakness is present {{on the side of the}} stance leg. A Trendelenburg sign can occur when there is presence of a muscular dysfunction (weakness of the gluteus medius or minimus) or when someone is experiencing pain. The body is not able to maintain the center of gravity on the side of the stance leg. Normally, the body shifts the weight to the stance leg, allowing the shift of the center of gravity and consequently stabilizing or balancing the body. However, in this scenario, when the patient/person lifts the opposing leg, the shift is not created and the patient/person cannot maintain balance leading to instability.|$|E
