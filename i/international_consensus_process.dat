These include the availability of a skilled generalist at the district hospital, mentoring of team-based care in the community, a strong leadership role in the district health system, and developing holistic practice of medicine [1]. Contextual differences between Africa and other parts of the world have prompted initia-tives to define the role of family medicine in sub-Saharan Africa. An <b>international</b> <b>consensus</b> <b>process</b> defined the roles of the African family physician as care provider, consultant, capacity-builder, supervisor, manager and collaborator [2, 3]. This places an important focus on the family physician’s capacity building role as the lead clinician in the district hospital. There is also a renewed focus on training, recruitment and retention of human resources for health in Afric...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The {{definition}} {{and use of}} the term "polytrauma" is inconsistent and lacks validation. This article describes the historical evolution of the term and geographical differences in its meaning, examines the challenges faced in defining it adequately in the current context, and summarizes where the <b>international</b> <b>consensus</b> <b>process</b> is heading, in order to provide the trauma community with a validated and universally agreed upon definition of polytrauma. Conclusion: A lack of consensus in the definition of "polytrauma" was apparent. According to the international consensus opinion, both anatomical and physiological parameters {{should be included in the}} definition of polytrauma. An Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) based anatomical definition is the most practical and feasible given the ubiquitous use of the system. Convincing preliminary data show that two body regions with AIS > 2 is a good marker of polytrauma-better than other ISS cutoffs, which could also indicate monotrauma. The selection of the most accurate physiological parameters is still underway, but they will most likely be descriptors of tissue hypoxia and coagulopathy...|$|E

An <b>international</b> <b>consensus</b> <b>process</b> on reporting standards in dementia and cognitive impairment (STARDdem) was established, focusing on studies presenting data from which {{sensitivity and specificity}} were reported or could be derived. A working group led the initiative through 4 rounds of consensus work, using a modified Delphi process and culminating in a face-to-face consensus meeting in October 2012. The aim of this process was to agree {{on how best to}} supplement the generic standards of the STARD statement to enhance their utility and encourage their use in dementia research.

The areas at most risk of inadequate reporting were identified and a set of dementia-specific recommendations to supplement the STARD guidance were developed, including better reporting of patient selection, the reference standard used, avoidance of circularity, and reporting of test-retest reliability. STARDdem is an implementation of the STARD statement in which the original checklist is elaborated and supplemented with guidance pertinent to studies of cognitive disorders.

And further, supporters of justice assume that a legal response is necessary in order to promote reconciliation.

40|$|Objectives Musculoskeletal {{ultrasonography}} (US) has {{the potential}} to be an important tool in the assessment of disease activity in childhood arthritides. To assess pathology, clear definitions for synovitis need to be developed first. The aim of this study was to develop and validate these definitions through an <b>international</b> <b>consensus</b> <b>process.</b> Methods The decision on which US techniques to use, the components to be included in the definitions as well as the final wording were developed by 31 ultrasound experts in a consensus process. A Likert scale of 1 - 5 with 1 indicating complete disagreement and 5 complete agreement was used. A minimum of 80 % of the experts scoring 4 or 5 was required for final approval. The definitions were then validated on 120 standardized US images of the wrist, MCP and tibiotalar joints displaying various degrees of synovitis at various ages. Results B-Mode and Doppler should be used for assessing synovitis in children. A US definition of the various components (i. e. synovial hypertrophy, effusion and Doppler signal within the synovium) was developed. The definition was validated on still images with a median of 89 % (range 80 - 100) of participants scoring it as 4 or 5 on a Likert scale. Conclusions US definitions of synovitis and its elementary components covering the entire pediatric age range were successfully developed through a Delphi process and validated in a web-based still images exercise. These results provide the basis for the standardized US assessment of synovitis in clinical practice and research. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{the success}} of safe sleep campaigns and the {{progress}} in understanding risk factors, the rate of reduction {{in the cases of}} sudden infant death syndrome has now slowed and it remains a leading cause of postneonatal mortality in many developed countries. Strategic action is needed to tackle this problem and it is now vital to identify how the sudden infant death research community may best target its efforts. The Global Action and Prioritization of Sudden Infant Death Project was an <b>international</b> <b>consensus</b> <b>process</b> that aimed to define and direct future research by investigating the priorities of expert and lay members of the sudden unexpected infant death (SUID) community across countries. The aim was to identify which areas of research should be prioritized {{to reduce the number of}} SUID deaths globally. Scientific researchers, clinicians, counselors, educators, and SUID parents from 25 countries took part across 2 online surveys to identify potential research priorities. Workshops subsequently took place in the United Kingdom, United States, and Australia to reach consensus and 10 priority areas for research were established. Three main themes among the priorities emerged: (1) a better understanding of mechanisms underlying SUID, (2) ensuring best practice in data collection, management and sharing, and (3) a better understanding of target populations and more effective communication of risk. SUID is a global problem and this project provides the international SUID community with a list of shared research priorities to more effectively work toward explaining and reducing the number of sudden infant deaths...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Musculoskeletal {{problems}} such as low back pain, neck, knee and shoulder pain are leading causes of disability and activity limitation in adults and are most frequently managed within primary care. There is a clear trend towards large, high quality trials testing the effectiveness of common non-pharmacological interventions for these conditions showing, at best, small to moderate benefits. This paper summarises the main lessons learnt from recent trials {{of the effectiveness of}} non-pharmacological therapies for common musculoskeletal conditions in primary care and provides agreed research priorities for future clinical trials. Methods Consensus development using nominal group techniques through national (UK) and international workshops. During a national Clinical Trials Thinktank workshop in April 2007 in the UK, a group of 30 senior researchers experienced in clinical trials for musculoskeletal conditions and 2 patient representatives debated the possible explanations for the findings of recent high quality trials of non-pharmacological interventions. Using the qualitative method of nominal group technique, these experts developed and ranked a set of priorities for future research, guided by the evidence from recent trials of treatments for common musculoskeletal problems. The recommendations from the national workshop were presented and further ranked at an international symposium (hosted in Canada) in June 2007. Results 22 recommended research priorities were developed, of which 12 reached consensus as priorities for future research from the UK workshop. The 12 recommendations were reduced to 7 agreed priorities at the international symposium. These were: to increase the focus on implementation (research into practice); to develop national musculoskeletal research networks in which large trials can be sited and smaller trials supported; to use more innovative trial designs such as those based on stepped care and subgrouping for targeted treatment models; to routinely incorporate health economic analysis into future trials; to include more patient-centred outcome measures; to develop a core set of outcomes for new trials of interventions for musculoskeletal problems; and to focus on studies that advance methodological approaches for clinical trials in this field. Conclusion A set of research priorities for future trials of non-pharmacological therapies for common musculoskeletal conditions has been developed and agreed through national (UK) and <b>international</b> <b>consensus</b> <b>processes.</b> These priorities provide useful direction for researchers and research funders alike and impetus for improvement in the quality and methodology of clinical trials in this field. </p...|$|R

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) The use of {{the term}} polytrauma is {{inconsistent}} and lacks validation. While numerous definitions have been used interchangeably over the last half-century no attempt has been made to validate any of these definitions nor examine their accuracy in defining the polytrauma patient. Out of this setting comes the aim of this thesis- the development of an internationally validated consensus definition of polytrauma. A universally accepted definition of polytrauma is vital for accurate scientific communication, epidemiological understanding, monitoring of outcomes and benchmarking of trauma care. Without a validated and clear consensus definition, meaningful comparisons between institutional datasets are hampered and further advances hoped for in trauma research may be impeded by imprecise definitions of their included ‘polytrauma’ patients. To carry out the aim of this thesis a literature review and four clinical studies were conducted. An International Working Group on Polytrauma was also established. This thesis will describe the historical evolution of the term polytrauma, detailing its peculiar geographical and cultural differences and establish, through a review of the literature, the lack of a consensus and validated definition. Through four clinical studies it will: 1) examine the key components, specifically the anatomical description and physiological parameters, that must be included in any definition of polytrauma; 2) address the challenges faced in defining polytrauma adequately in the current context and; 3) summarise the <b>international</b> <b>consensus</b> <b>process</b> that has evolved out of this thesis to provide the trauma community with a validated and universally agreed upon definition of polytraum...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{economic}} {{burden of}} the treatment of periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) is high and the treatment of PJI has {{a high degree of}} international controversy. Several papers have declared the International Consensus Meeting on Periprosthetic Joint Infection (ICMPJI) to be the "flawless pledge of international academics" to overcome the challenges of musculoskeletal infections. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to highlight for the first time some essential insights into the key dilemmas that are associated with this <b>international</b> <b>consensus</b> <b>process.</b> Methods: The proceedings of the ICMPJI was reviewed, and the critical consensus agreements that were reached were communicated via e-mail to 48 leading orthopaedic surgeons, microbiologists and statisticians around the world. Of these, 30 responded, 8 did not, and 10 of respondents were not aware of the ICMPJI. Results: A thorough review of the ICMPJI proceedings identified a clear need to resolve some of the dilemmas that we highlight in this paper. The Delphi procedure has been described as a survey technique that enables a group dynamic-based practice. Although there have been several published reports on this procedure, its scientific merit is still being debated. Several challenges and questions have been raised regarding the application of the Delphi technique, but there is no doubt that it is a vital approach for achieving consensus on subjects where none currently exists. Conclusion: Performing prospective clinical studies in this area is currently the best and only option to overcome this challenge. In the long term, this approach will not only incorporate the standard of clinical evidence but also adopt regional mores for treating infection, which include patient values, cultural differences and local financial resources...|$|E
40|$|The {{business}} case of sustainability {{has been argued}} for by many authors (Willard, 2005; McNall et al., 2011). There is a large degree of consensus regarding the potential business impact of sustainability. However, most companies either are not acting or are falling short on execution (MIT Sloan, 2009). Relatively few companies consider innovation for sustainability substantially rewarding. Suggested solution for this includes better access to frameworks for understanding sustainability and value creation and the {{business case}}s thereof (MIT Sloan, 2009). Furthermore, it is well-known that support for generation and selection of ideas and for formulating goals and strategies is especially essential to have during the early phases of the innovation process (Roozenburg & Eekels, 1995).   The usual absence of an operational definition of sustainability is still a major barrier to corporate strategic sustainable development (Holmberg & Robèrt, 2000). A sustainability definition that can guide assessment of the current situation and stimulate generation of ideas for upstream solutions and strategic guidelines that can aid prioritization of early smart actions {{are among the most}} promising leverage points. A framework including those features is being developed in an <b>international</b> <b>consensus</b> <b>process</b> since twenty years (see, e. g., Robèrt et al., 2012). Among other things, this framework for strategic sustainable development FSSD, clarifies the self-interest in sustainability work and thus supports more widespread and proactive sustainable innovation.   In this study, the FSSD is used as the main basis for a new tool to be used in early phases of the innovation process for self-assessment of an organization’s current maturity and performance from an overall strategic sustainability point of view and for stimulating generation of ideas for business models design. We present a prototype version of such a tool and results from initial tests of this tool performed in four organizations. We study in particular whether the outlined tool is perceived by the organizations to be: (i) easy to comprehend, (ii) relevant, (iii) capable of differentiating the organizations in a comprehensive way, (iv) helpful for discovering insufficiencies that the organizations are not already aware of and (v) helpful for generation and selection of ideas for upstream solutions, business model innovation and for formulation of goals, and strategies. ...|$|E
