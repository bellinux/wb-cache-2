The development of ultrafine grain structure in steel depends on conditions of equal channel angular pressing (ECAP).

40|$|Abstract. A {{structure}} of a carbon steel specimen after explosive loading is investigated. The loading was executed by Mach stem, formed in high explosive charge that was preliminary compressed by advanced wave in ceramic bar. In the original condition the specimen had a typical for low carbon steel <b>ferrite-pearlite</b> <b>structure.</b> Metallographic analysis has shown that {{during the process of}} the explosive loading the following structural changes took place: formation of numerous deformation twins in both ferrite grains and pearlite colonies (i. e. in two-phase structure); formation of extended bands of localized deformation, which are not crystallographically connected with the original ferrite-pearlite structure; fine grains formation in zones of severe plastic flow. The size of the ferrite grains is by an order of magnitude less than the original grains size. According to the authors ’ opinion, above-noted structural peculiarities demonstrate that loading conditions achieved in the current loading scheme differ from common. The phenomenon of non-typical twinning in heterogeneous structure (pearlite) indirectly evidences that extremely high stresses and strain rates took place in the specimen during the loading...|$|E

40|$|In {{offshore}} oil exploitation, the riser {{is an important}} component, linking the installations on the seabed to the surface installations. This master's thesis has looked {{at the possibility of}} implementing forge welding in riser production. The focus has been on mechanical properties in riser steel subjected to the thermal effects from forge welding. Continuing the findings from the forge welding investigations, relations between strength and hardness has been established. Thermal simulation of forge welding was carried out. The material was then tempered at 650 C for respectively 1, 3 and 6 hours. Hardness profiles were measured across the HAZ, as well as tensile testing of the base material. Tempering for 1 hour produced HAZ hardness below 275 HV, but 6 hours of tempering was necessary to bring the hardness below 250 HV. Tensile testing confirmed suspicions from prior work about provided material not fulfilling the requirements for yield and tensile strength. The establishment of a strength-hardness relationship started with microstructural investigations. These included light microscopy, microhardness measurements, SEM imaging and EDS analysis to determine the effect of prolonged tempering, as well as to identify the microstructures formed by various heat treatments. It was found that as-quenched material contained a martensitic structure with no visible carbides. Material tempered {{for a short period of}} time contained lath shaped cementite, while alloy carbides of chromium and molybdenum formed in material subjected to prolonged tempering. Material subjected to controlled cooling or isothermal heat treatment at 600 C and 700 C formed <b>ferrite-pearlite</b> <b>structures.</b> However, instead of lamellar pearlite, a form of degenerate pearlite was observed in two out of three samples. A comparison of different tempering temperatures was done by using the Hollomon-Jaffe parameter to determine tempering effect. This study proved the Hollomon-Jaffe relationship valid for tempering of F 22 steel, since the same hardness reduction was achieved for tempering cycles with equal tempering parameter. The comparison also accentuated the strong dependence of temperature on achieved tempering effect. Tensile testing and corresponding hardness measurements were used for determining linear regressions between strength and hardness for F 22 steel. Regressions for both yield- and tensile strength were found. When compared to already existing relations between strength and hardness, the new models proved more accurate for the F 22 steel. However, approximating tensile strength proved more precise than approximating yield strength due to plastic deformation and work hardening. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The work {{presents}} the results on grains refinement of steel containing 0, 45 wt pct carbon resulted from severe plastic deformation (SPD). Different steel structures from prior solutioning and/or thermomechanical treatment were prepared for deformation experimental. A coarse grain <b>ferrite-pearlite</b> <b>structure</b> was achieved applying solutioning. By application of thermomechanical (TM) controlled forging process, performing multistep open die forging, the refined ferrite-pearlite mixture was prepared. Final structure refinement of steel, having different initial structure, was then accomplished applying warm Equal Channel Angular Pressing (ECAP) at 400 °C. Employment of this processing route resulted in extensive deformation of ferrite grains and cementite lamellae fragmentation. Applying the highest shear stress (εef- 4) the mixed structure of subgrains and ultrafine grains was present within the ferrite phase. In pearlite grains, modification of cementite lamellae due to shearing, bending, twisting and breaking was found efficient. The coarse cementite lamellae spheroidization was more efficient in prior TM treated steel. The tensile deformation records confirmed strength increase and diversity in strain hardening behaviour.

40|$|The {{improvement}} of the Mechanical properties of the low Carbon steel and increasing its strength, was the goal of some heat treatment technologies developed in the last twenty years. One of these technologies is the Rapid Heat Treatment (RHT), by which the strength of steel increases with the crystalline grain size decrease obtained from the rapidity of austenitizing, and more strength increase may be obtained, if the action of austenitizing is followed by rapid cooling or quenching, but in this case, ductility will decrease simultaneously by increasing the cooling rate. Another mechanical properties improving heat treatment, is the Intercritical Heat Treatment (IHT), by which the <b>ferrite-pearlite</b> <b>structure</b> of low Carbon steel transforms to Dual-Phase structure of ferrite and martensite resulting increase in strength, while {{a great deal of}} its ductility is restored. Authors in this paper report about their experiments carried out on a low Carbon-steel, trying to get the advantages of the two above mentioned technologies, by subjecting the formerly rapid heat treated steel, to intercritical heat treatment,.

40|$|The present work {{deals with}} grain {{refinement}} of medium carbon steel, having different initial microstructure, modified by either thermal and/or thermomechanical treatment (TM) prior severe plastic deformation. In case of TM treated steel, structure refinement {{was conducted in}} two steps. Preliminary structure refinement has been achieved due to multistep open die forging process which provided total strain of 3. Uniform and fine recrystallized ferrite structure with grain size {{of the order of}} 2 - 5 &# 956;m and with nest-like pearlite colonies was obtained. The further grain refinement of steel samples having different initial structure was accomplished during warm Equal Channel Angular Pressing (ECAP) at 400 °C. The microstructure development was analyzed in dependence of effective strain introduced (&# 949;ef ~ 2. 5 - 4). Employment of this processing route resulted in extensive deformation of ferrite grains where mixture of subgrains and ultrafine grain was found regardless the preliminary treatment of steel. The straining and moderate ECAP temperature caused the partial cementite lamellae fragmentation and spheroidization as straining increased. The cementite lamellae spheroidization was more extensive in TM treated steel samples. The tensile behavior was characterized by strength increase for both structural steel states; however the work hardening behavior was modified in steel where preliminary TM treatment was introduced to modified coarse <b>ferrite-pearlite</b> <b>structure...</b>|$|E
40|$|AbstractAn {{important}} {{measure in}} steel processing industry is achieving the required mechanical properties and micro {{structure of the}} material. A new phenomenon has been discovered recently which allows to refine ferrite grain significantly and to spheroidise carbides over {{a very short time}} compared to conventional heat treatment techniques. The newly developed technology based on the ASR (Accelerated Spheroidisation and Refinement) effect consists in heating a steel workpiece through thickness to a temperature no higher than Ac 1 and in subsequent plastic deformation. The energy introduced through plastic deformation causes the workpiece temperature to increase. This temperature increase, however, is not uniform throughout the workpiece cross-section, leading to substantial inhomogeneity. Fully austenitized regions, partially austenitized regions, and areas where no phase transformation occurred, coexist. In locations previously subjected to intensive plastic deformation, cementite lamellae disintegrate and globular carbides form. In regions subjected to milder plastic deformation, spheroidisation does not occur directly {{in the course of the}} thermomechanical treatment. Despite, the cementite lamellae show a stronger tendency to spheroidise during subsequent annealing. The combination of a suitable pre-heating temperature, an appropriate amount of strain and a possible reheating leads to transformation of initial <b>ferrite-pearlite</b> micro <b>structure</b> with lamellar pearlite into desired ferrite matrix with spheroidised carbides. Key microstructure parameters governing the properties of ferrite-pearlite steels include exactly the ferrite grain size, the distribution of defects within the ferrite grain and the distribution and morphology of carbides. The present article describes a new thermomechanical treatment technique which allows controlling these microstructure parameters and related mechanical properties in order to achieve their favourable combination in structural carbon steel C 45. The processing time is very short when compared to several-hour conventional heat treatments. This offers potential for achieving desired mechanical properties with time and energy savings...|$|R
40|$|ArcelorMittal {{focuses on}} both {{mechanical}} performances and machinability while designing new steel grades. ArcelorMittal has developed specific programs for machinability testing in turning, {{low and high}} speed drilling and gear machining. Machinability is evaluated through cutting forces, chip shape, surface quality and tool life. Gear machining {{is one of the}} main machining operations involved in powertrain manufacturing operations. The literature proposes many papers dealing with this process however there are too few studies interested in steel machinability evaluation while gear machining. This paper focuses on a particular gear manufacturing process, i. e. gear hobbing, and more precisely on steel machinability for gear hobbing applications. Tools as well as kinematics of gear hobbing are quite complex. This paper proposes a comprehensive experimental protocol for machinability testing. This protocol is based on a European standard. Tests are performed on a machine tool using a commercially available cutting tool. Tests provide the range of cutting conditions for five different steel grades. Both steels have a <b>ferrite-pearlite</b> <b>structure</b> with yield stress from 530 to 800 MPa and ultimate tensile stress from 680 to 900 MPa. Four grades are devoted to bar machining. The last one is devoted to forming and then machining operations. Many metallurgical solutions are investigated to enhance machinability such as lead addition or increase in sulfur content or calcium treatment. This paper analyses the influence of steel composition and structure on machinability. It shows the relevance of metallurgical solutions for machinability enhancement even for powertrain applications. Cutting conditions clearly depend on the metallurgical solution even if specific cutting force is finally close. The main difference is found on tool wear with tool life ratio from 1 to 1. 5...|$|E
