The results indicate that from the 1870 s to the 1970 s average height increased by around 11 cm, or more than 1 cm per decade. The main finding is that for the northern and middle European groups of countries the gains in height were most rapid in the period 1911 - 15 to 1951 - 55, a period that embraced two World Wars and the Great Depression but also witnessed advances in public health and hygiene. For the southern countries growth was fastest in the period 1951 - 55 to 1976 - 80. These findings suggest that advances in height were determined not only by income and living standards but also by a variety of other socioeconomic trends...|$|E
