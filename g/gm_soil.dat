(Biology) North-West University, Mafikeng Campus, 2013 Plant-root {{interaction}} {{occurs in}} the rhizosphere, a region {{referred to as a}} biologically active zone of soil where microorganisms and plant roots interact. This study examined the impact of genetically modified (GM) maize (Bt) on functional community of rhizobacteria. Soil samples of field grown GM and non-GM maize were collected from an experimental field in Delmas, South Africa, at 30 days after sowing (DAS) and I day after harvest (DAH). Chemical analyses of <b>soil</b> properties in <b>GM</b> and Non-GM <b>soil</b> samples were performed. Quantitative analysis was achieved through soil dilution and plate count (colony forming units) using selective and non-selective media (tryptic soy agar, nutrient agar, Luria Bertani agar and Pseudomonas selective agar). Qualitative analysis was achieved using analytical profile index identification systems and sequence data of rhizobacterial isolates. Biolog GN 2 microplate was used to compare community catabolic profile of rhizobacteria in <b>GM</b> and non-GM <b>soils</b> and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis technique (DGGE) was used in comparing rhizobacterial community profiles in <b>GM</b> and non-GM <b>soil</b> samples. Chemical analyses of <b>GM</b> and non-GM <b>soil</b> samples collected 30 DAS and 1 DAH indicated the same elements with similar percentages. The pH of <b>GM</b> and non-GM <b>soil</b> samples range from 6. 12 - 7. 03, indicating slightly acidic to slightly alkaline soil. Total count of rhizobacteria (cfulg) in GM and non-GM maize soil samples collected 30 DAS and 1 DAH was not significantly different in the media. Similar rhizobacterial species from the rhizosphere of both GM and non- GM maize were identified using analytical profile index and sequence data. No significant difference was observed in the community catabolic profile among the rhizobacteria in <b>GM</b> and non-GM <b>soil</b> samples. Cluster analyses of DGGE bands indicated that band patterns of GM and non-GM samples 30 DAS and 1 DAH were similar to each other. These findings suggest that the GM maize was not able to alter microbial community and activity and are significant to the investigation of the impact of GM maize on rhizobacteria. Master...|$|R
40|$|Modal analysis, {{based on}} APXS, MiniTES and Mossbauer results {{obtained}} at Gusev and Meridiani sites on Mars, indicates that Martian soils consist predominantly of igneous minerals such as olivine, pyroxene and feldspar (approximately 70 - 80 %), with the balance consisting of alteration minerals such as sulfates, silica and chlorides]. These studies {{also showed that}} soil alteration did not occur in-situ and igneous and alteration components are derived from different sources. Below, we analyse the chemical abundance data obtained from shock glasses in shergottites using mass balance mixing models. In these models, the two main end members used are (a) host rock chemical composition and (b) the <b>GM</b> <b>soils</b> average composition as the second component. Here, we consider the S-bearing phases as indicators of added alteration phases in the shock glasses and <b>GM</b> <b>soils.</b> Although the S-bearing phase in shock glasses occurs as micron sized sulfide blebs, we showed in earlier abstracts that sulfur was originally present as sulfate in impact glass-precursor materials and was subsequently reduced to sulfide during shock melting. This conclusion is based on results obtained from S-K XANES studies, Fe/S atomic ratios in sulfide blebs and 34 S/ 32 S isotopic measurements in these sulfide blebs. Additionally, sulfur in several EET 79001 Lith. A glasses is found to correlate positively with Al 2 O 3 and CaO (and negatively with FeO and MgO), suggesting the presence of Al- and Ca- sul-fate-bearing phases. The distribution of the 87 Sr/ 86 Sr iso-topic ratios determined in Lith. A glasses (, 27 &, 188 and, 54) indicate that Martian soil gypsum and host rock material were mixed {{with each other in}} the glass precursors. In some vugs in Lith A glass, 27 detected gypsum laths. Furthermore, the Martian regolith-de-rived component (where sulfur typically occurs as sul-fate) is identified in these glasses by determining neutron produced isotopic excesses/deficits in 80 Kr and 149 Sm isotopes. Moreover, the suggestion that the large amount of sulfur found in, 507 was sourced from pyrrhotite in the host rock, would require that excessive quantities of host rock would need to be stripped of sulfur to make this sulfide-rich glass. These results provide ample evidence that S occurred as sulfate and was added to glass precursor materials prior to impact shock...|$|R

High resolution soil geochemical data exist for only part of England and Wales, whilst stream sediment data cover the entire landscape. A novel methodology is presented for estimating soil equivalent ABCs for PHEs from high-resolution (HR) stream sediment geochemical data grouped by common parent materials (PM), using arsenic (As) as an example. Geometric mean (GM) values for local PM groups are used to investigate different approaches for transforming sediment to soil equivalent concentrations. Holdout validation is used to assess: (i) the optimum number of samples for calculating local GM values, and (ii) the optimum scale at which to group data when using linear regression analysis to estimate <b>GM</b> <b>soil</b> ABCs from local sediment geochemical values. Holdout validation showed that the smallest differences were generally observed when five observations were {{used to calculate the}} GM and that these should be grouped over the smallest possible area in order to encompass soils over PMs with elevated GM As concentrations.

40|$|The use {{of genetically}} {{modified}} (GM) plants in agriculture has been a topic in public debate for over a decade. Despite their potential to increase yields, there may be unintended negative side-effects of <b>GM</b> plants on <b>soil</b> micro-organisms that are essential for functioning of agro-ecosystems. Fungi are important soil organisms and can have beneficial or harmful effects on plants. Their benefits to agro-ecosystems come from their activities as free-living saprobes breaking down soil organic matter thereby releasing nutrients to the crops, {{as well as from}} mutualistic interactions. On the other hand, soil-borne plant pathogenic fungi can cause severe damage in crops. Understanding of the impact of GM plants on the dynamics and functioning of soil fungi is essential to evaluate the possible risks of introduction of GM plants for ecosystem functioning. In recent years, over 50 studies have addressed the effects of various GM traits in crops on soil fungal community structure and function. These studies showed that GM crops can have positive, negative, or neutral effects on both free-living and plant-associated soil fungi. The observed discrepancy in results of these studies is discussed. This is done by highlighting a number of case studies. New methods developed in recent years have enabled microbial ecologists to get a better picture on the functioning and assembly of soil fungal communities.

O delineamento {{experimental}} utilizado foi o inteiramente casualizado, em esquema fatorial 4 x 5, com quatro repetições, sendo quatro solos de várzea [Neossolo Flúvico (RU), Gleissolo Háplico (GX), Gleissolo Melânico (GM) e Organossolo Mésico (OY) ] e cinco níveis de saturação por K da CTC potencial (natural, 4, 6, 8 e 10 %). As saturações naturais foram de 1, 49, 1, 65, 1, 30 e 1, 55 % para os solos RU, GX, GM e OY, respectivamente. Inicialmente, amostras suficientes de 4 dm³ dos solos receberam correção com calcário para elevar a V a 50 % e incubados por 30 dias. Em seguida, amostras de 3 dm³ dos solos receberam os tratamentos com potássio e uma adubação básica com macro e micronutrientes e foram incubados por mais 30 dias em vasos com capacidade para 5 dm³. No final desse período, os solos foram inundados onde se cultivaram duas plantas de arroz por vaso, nas quais avaliaram-se os teores foliares de K no florescimento e a produção de grãos no final do ciclo. Em subamostras obtidas dos solos dos vasos antes e após o cultivo, analisaram-se as formas de potássio: K total (Ktot), K não-trocável (Knt), K trocável (Ktr), K em solução (Ksol) e K disponível pelo extrator Mehlich 1 (K M 1). Pelos resultados, verificou-se que o arroz respondeu em produção de grãos à adubação potássica em todos os solos estudados.

Initially, sufficient samples of 4 dm³ for all soils received limestone to elevate the V to 50 % and were incubated for 30 days. Following that, samples of 3 dm³ received the potassium treatments and a basic fertilization with macro and micronutrients and were incubated for more 30 days, in vases with capacity for 5 dm³. In the end of this period, the soils were flooded, to receive two rice plants per vase, on which were measured the leaf content of potassium at the flowering period and the yield {{at the end of the}} cycle. In sub-samples obtained from the soils of the vases before and after cultivation, the forms of potassium total K (Ktot), nonexchangeable K (Kne), exchangeable K (Ke), K in solution (Ksol) and available K by the Mehlich- 1 extractant were measured.

By computing RMSE and at multiple spatial scales and for different data combinations, we assessed how, and at which scales, the spatial sampling error, noise, and {{the choice of the}} reference data impact on RMSE and. The results reveal large changes in RMSE and with continental average values of 8 % and 18 % for the RMSE of relative soil moisture saturation and between 0. 4 and 0. 7 for depending on the spatial scale of aggregation and the choice of reference data. The combined effect of noise and spatial sampling error accounted for a 79 % RMSE increase at 1 km and predominated over the error due to the choise of the reference data also at 5 km scale. The effect of noise on RMSE strongly diminished at spatial scales. By con-trast, the impact of uncertainties in the reference data was larger on than on RMSE. This highlights the better potential of to estimate the benefit of observations prior to data assimilation. Based on our results, it is further suggested that a potential way for an improved ASAR GM SSM error assessment is to: 1) aggregate the data to resolution to minimize the noise; 2) subtract the spatial sampling error within the coarse resolution footprint; and 3) remove the reference uncertainty using advanced techniques such as triple collocation.

40|$|A long ongoing {{discussion}} between {{scientists and}} policy decision-makers {{seems to have}} entered recently into a new phase. The consequences of release of transgenic crops into the environment are being discussed not only by scientists but also by farmers, environmental groups and politicians, while an increasing amount of data is becoming available at all biological scales, including the field level. However, data still rely on experiments designed to capture direct consumer¿resource interactions. Here we argue that we should attempt {{to concentrate on the}} ecosystem functioning of soil biota under genetically-modified (GM) plants, because functional and mechanistic analysis of the multitrophic effects of <b>GM</b> plants on <b>soil</b> biota is still lacking. It is our opinion that we should avoid addressing taxa and soil communities separately, but link them at their functional level. We shall explain why, using examples from ecosystem services, allometric scaling, and soil food webs. The energy flow of any food web under stress incorporates several factors and pooled information on ecosystem services and on the different responses of soil invertebrates to induced perturbations in other trophic levels. Therefore, we will systematically focus on the complementarities of these approache...|$|R

The current study investigated {{the effect of a}} vermiwash foliar spray on the response of bhut jolokia (Capsicum assamicum) exposed to two different arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF: Rhizophagus irregularis, RI and G. mosseae, <b>GM)</b> in acidic <b>soil</b> under naturally ventilated greenhouse conditions. The VW spray significantly influenced the growth of plants receiving the dual treatment of AMF+VW. Plant growth was more prominent in the GM+VW treatment group than that in the RI+VW treatment group. The plant-AMF interactions in relation to growth and nutrient requirements were also significantly influenced by the application of VW. Interestingly, the VW treatment appeared to contribute more N to plants when compared to that under the AMF treatment, which led to changes in the C:N:P stoichiometry in plant shoots. Furthermore, the increased potassium dependency, as observed {{in the case of the}} dual treatments, suggests the significance of such treatments for improving crop conditions under salt stress. Overall, our study shows that the VW foliar spray modifies the response of a crop to inoculations of different AMF with regard to growth and nutrient utilization, which has implication...|$|R
3000|$|Biosensors {{may be used}} {{to assess}} the effects of genetically {{modified}} (<b>GM)</b> crops on <b>soil</b> properties, particularly their potential impact on nutrient cycling and plant/microbe interactions. Biosensors can be used to investigate the soil modification induced by GM plant roots in soil and gain an early understanding on soil functions, particularly in the rhizosphere. However, the main concern about GM crops is the release and persistence of transgenic DNA into soil, and to our knowledge there is still no whole-cell biosensors capable of signalling the presence of specific DNA sequences. In this field, chemical biosensors are much more developed than whole-cell biosensors. Also the detection of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) by whole-cell biosensors may be a valuable tool for {{a better understanding of the}} ecological implications and impact of the soil VOCs emissions, and on the transfer of pollutant VOCs to the atmosphere. Gil et al. [38] constructed a lux-inserted E. coli biosensor for VOCs detection, which was calibrated and tested with benzene.

Knowledge of arsenic background concentrations is important for land application of wastes and for making remediation decisions. The soil clean-up target level for arsenic in Florida (0. 8 and 3. 7 mg kg for residential and commercial areas,y 1 respectively) lies {{within the range of}} both background and analytical quantification limits. The objective {{of this study was to}} compare arsenic distribution in urban and non-urban areas of Florida. Approximately 440 urban and 448 non-urban Florida soil samples were compared. For urban areas, soil samples were collected from three land-use classes (residential, commercial and public land) in two cities, Gainesville and Miami. For the non-urban areas, samples were collected from relatively undisturbed non-inhabited areas. Arsenic concentrations varied greatly in Gainesville, ranging from 0. 21 to approximately 660 mg kg with a geometric mean (GM) of 0. 40 mg kg, which were lowery 1 y 1 than Miami samples (ranging from 0. 32 to 112 mg kg; GMs 2. 81 mg kg).

The main objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the N use efficiency (NUE) of rice plant, derived from GMs including sunn hemp (Crotalaria juncea L.), millet (Pennisetum glaucum L.) and urea in the greenhouse. The experimental treatments included two GMs (sunn hemp- 15 N and millet- 15 N), absence of N organic source (without <b>GM</b> residues in <b>soil)</b> and four N rates, as urea- 15 N (0, 28. 6, 57. 2 and 85. 8 mg N kg- 1). The results showed that both rice grain and straw biomass yields under sunn hemp were greater than that of millet or without the application of GM. The NUE of rice under sunn hemp was greater than that under millet (18. 9 and 7. 8 % under sunn hemp and millet, respectively). The urea N application rates did not affect the fertilizer NUE by rice (53. 7 %) with or without GMs. The NUE of GMs by rice plants ranged from 14. 1 % and 16. 8 % for root and shoot, respectively.

40|$|The {{cultivation}} {{of genetically modified}} (GM) plants has raised several environmental concerns. One of these concerns regards non-target soil fauna organisms, which {{play an important role}} in the decomposition of organic matter and hence are largely exposed to <b>GM</b> plant residues. <b>Soil</b> fauna may be directly affected by transgene products or indirectly by pleiotropic effects such as a modified plant metabolism. Thus, ecosystem services and functioning might be affected negatively. In a litterbag experiment in the field we analysed the decomposition process and the soil fauna community involved. Therefore, we used four experimental GM wheat varieties, two with a race-specific antifungal resistance against powdery mildew (Pm 3 b) and two with an unspecific antifungal resistance based on the expression of chitinase and glucanase. We compared them with two non-GM isolines and six conventional cereal varieties. To elucidate the mechanisms that cause differences in plant decomposition, structural plant components (i. e. C:N ratio, lignin, cellulose, hemicellulose) were examined and soil properties, temperature and precipitation were monitored. The most frequent taxa extracted from decaying plant material were mites (Cryptostigmata, Gamasina and Uropodina), springtails (Isotomidae), annelids (Enchytraeidae) and Diptera (Cecidomyiidae larvae). Despite a single significant transgenic/month interaction for Cecidomyiidae larvae, which is probably random, we detected no impact of the GM wheat on the soil fauna community. However, soil fauna differences among conventional cereal varieties were more pronounced than between GM and non-G...|$|R
40|$|On {{the plot}} scale, closed dynamic chamber methods (CDCM) {{are the most}} popular {{technique}} to directly measure CO 2 fluxes from the soil surface to the atmosphere. However, the gradient method (GM) provides several advantages, which refer to the underground processes contributing to the CO 2 production that cannot be investigated by the CDCM. To evaluate the suitability of the <b>GM</b> in dryland <b>soils,</b> we compared feasibility and quality of results for both methods. The GM is based on Fick's law and requires knowledge on diffusion properties of the soil, concentration gradients between soil and atmosphere, and the air-filled porosity. Our study was conducted on two sites along the Okavango River, one in Namibia (semi-arid) and the other in Angola (semi-humid) with comparable sandy soil texture. The CO 2 concentration profile was determined by collecting soil gas samples from different soil depths. CO 2 efflux was measured with a vented steady-state closed chamber system. Soil gas diffusivities were measured in lab experiments using diffusion chambers and undisturbed soil cores. Modeled diffusivities were predicted according to six popular models based on air-filled porosity and total porosity as input parameters. Results show strong agreement between CDCM and GM fluxes based on measured diffusivities. However, with modeled diffusivities overestimation of fluxes for most of the tested models, especially at high air-filled porosity, were detected. We conclude that the GM offers a valuable tool for flux estimates on the pedon scale in dry ecosystems particularly in combination with measured diffusivities and includes the possibility for investigating subsurface processes involved in the CO 2 production...|$|R
40|$|Plant roots have a {{profound}} effect on soil microbial activity, particularly in the rhizosphere. Hence, it is important to understand the potential effects of genetically modified (<b>GM)</b> crops on <b>soil</b> microbial activity and related processes such as litter decomposition. In this study, we compared the effects of GM potato Modena on soil microbial activity and carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) mineralization to effects induced by Modena’s parental isoline (Karnico) and a conventional potato cultivar (Aventra). A field experiment was conducted at two sites to assess microbial catabolic diversity (using MicroRespTM) in the rhizosphere and in bulk soil, during flowering and senescence of the potato plants. In a laboratory experiment with soil and potato litter from the field experiment, we investigated whether the cultivars had modified the activity of soil microbial communities to such an extent that this affected C and N mineralization. Results of the field experiment showed no GM-induced effects on microbial catabolic diversity, while effects of field site location and sampling date were significant. Multivariate analysis including plant traits and soil characteristics revealed that microbial catabolic activities in rhizosphere soil were strongly correlated with soil organic matter and tuber sucrose content, whereas in bulk soil, they were primarily correlated with soil moisture. In the laboratory experiment, we found that Modena induced a "home-field advantage" in N mineralization, yet this effect was inconsistent across locations and was also observed for other cultivars. Based on our data and results from previous studies, we conclude that the effects of GM cultivar Modena on soil microbial activity and litter decomposition fall within the normal range of effects found for conventional potato cultivars...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. High {{elevation}} talus {{soils are}} extreme environments for life. They are {{pertinent to the}} hydrology and biochemical cycling of high elevation ecosystems that supply drinking water to major metropolitan areas, and are undergoing change {{as a result of}} N deposition. As biological systems, they are virtually unstudied. In order to gain a basic understanding of these important systems, we studied the seasonal timing of C inputs and microclimate, and how they corresponded to microbial biomass dynamics, in vegetated and unvegetated soils from a high altitude talus slope at 3750 m in the Colorado Front Range. The soil microclimate was described by soil moisture and temperature measurements; C inputs were estimated with measures of eolian dust inputs and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). The biomass of different microbial functional groups (glutamate and salicylate mineralizers adapted to different temperatures) was estimated seasonally over 3 years. We found that the soil microclimate can be divided into three distinct seasons: Winter, with free water and temperature between 2. 9 and 0 8 C; spring, characterized by wet isothermal soils (0 8 C); and summer, characterized by hot (mean 10. 3 8 C; range 0 – 29. 3 8 C) dry soils occa-sionally wetted by precipitation. The highest OM inputs to unvegetated soils occurred in spring; PAR only reached soils in the summer. In unvegetated soils, the biomass of glutamate mineralizers (GM) was highest in spring and summer. In contrast, the <b>GM</b> of vegetated <b>soils</b> had highest biomass in the winter when plants were senesced. In both unvegetated and vegetated soils, salicylate mineralizers (SM) had greater biomass levels in the summer when temperatures were highest...|$|R

The P- 32 -P- 33 double isotope labeling technique was used to determine {{the relative}} contribution of green manures (GMs) and P fertilizers to P uptake by Setaria grass (Setaria sphacelata) grown in an amended tropical acid soil (Bungor series) in a glasshouse study. The amendments were factorial combinations of GMs (Calopogonium caeruleum, Gliricidia sepium and Imperata cylindrica) and P fertilizers [phosphate rocks (PRs) from North Carolina (NCPR), China (CPR) and Algeria (APR), and triple superphosphate (TSP) ]. Dry matter yield, P uptake, and P utilization from the amendments were monitored at 4, 8, and 15 weeks after establishment (WAE). The GMs alone or in combination with P fertilizers contributed less than 5 % to total P uptake in this soil, but total P uptake into Setaria plants in the GM treatments was three to four times that of the P fertilizers because the <b>GMs</b> mobilized more <b>soil</b> P. Also, the GMs markedly increased fertilizer P utilization in the combined treatments, from 3 % to 39 % with CPR, from 6 - 9 % to 19 - 48 % with reactive PRs, and from 6 % to 37 % with TSP in this <b>soil.</b> Both P <b>GM</b> and the other decomposition products were probably involved in reducing soil P-retention capacity. Mobilization of soil P was most likely the result of the action of the other decomposition products. These results demonstrate the high potential of integrating GMs and PRs for managing P in tropical soils and the importance of the soil P mobilization capacity of the organic components. Even the low-quality Imperata GM enhanced the effectiveness of the reactive APR more than fourfold...|$|R

Results showed that the soil pH was the lowest with an average of 5. 33 units in CK and was significantly higher in NPK (5. 89 units) and OM (5. 63 units) treatments (P, 0. 05). The application of fertilizers have remarkably improved SOC and TN values compared with the CK, Specifically, the OM treatment resulted in the highest SOC and TN concentrations (72. 5 % and 51. 2 % higher than CK) and NPK treatment increased the SOC and TN contents by 22. 0 % and 17. 8 % compared with CK. The average amounts of C/N ratio ranged from 9. 66 to 10. 98 in different treatments, and reached the highest in OM treatment (P, 0. 05).
