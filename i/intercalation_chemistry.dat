We review the <b>intercalation</b> <b>chemistry</b> of FeSe and FeS superconductors and discuss their synthesis, structure, and physical properties. Before we review the latest work in this area, we provide a brief background on the <b>intercalation</b> <b>chemistry</b> of other inorganic materials that exhibit enhanced superconducting properties upon intercalation, which include the transition metal dichalcogenides, fullerenes, and layered cobalt oxides. From past studies of these intercalated superconductors, we discuss {{the role of the}} intercalates in terms of charge doping, structural distortions, and Fermi surface reconstruction. We also briefly review the physical and chemical properties of the host materials [...] -mackinawite-type FeS and β-FeSe. The three types of intercalates for the iron chalcogenides can be placed in three categories: 1.) alkali and alkaline earth cations intercalated through the liquid ammonia technique; 2.) cations intercalated with organic amines such as ethylenediamine; and 3.) layered hydroxides intercalated during hydrothermal conditions.

The compounds investigated comprise the layered AMO 2 and AMS 2 structures, the olivine and maricite AMPO 4 structures, and the NA-SICON A 3 V 2 (PO 4) 3 structures. The calculated Na voltages for the compounds investigated are 0. 18 - 0. 57 V {{lower than that of}} the corresponding Li voltages, in agreement with previous experimental data. We believe the observed lower voltages for Na compounds are predomi-nantly a cathodic effect related to the much smaller energy gain from inserting Na into the host structure compared to inserting Li. We also found a relatively strong dependence of battery properties with structural features. In general, the difference between the Na and Li voltage of the same compound, ∆VNa-Li, is less negative for the maricite structures preferred by Na, and ∗To whom correspondence should be addressed 1 more negative for the olivine structures preferred by Li. The layered compounds have the most negative ∆VNa-Li. In terms of phase stability, we found that open structures, such as the layered and NASICON structures that are better able to accommodate the larger Na+ ion generally have both Na and Li versions of the same compound. For the close-packed AMPO 4 structures, our results show that Na generally prefers the maricite structure, while Li prefers the olivine structure, in agreement with previous experimental work. We also found surprising evidence that the barriers for Na+ migration can potentially be lower than that for Li+ migration in the layered structures.

Nevertheless, there are clear trends in the crystal chemistry of lithium nitrides and patterns to the bonding within these structures; key structure types and motifs dominate. Hence, not only does it become possible to anticipate composition–structure relationships in the synthesis of new nitrides, but also materials design and prescribed properties from magnetism through semiconducting and optical properties to superionic conductivity becomes a realistic prospect. This review presents a comprehensive account of the crystal chemistry of ternary and higher lithium nitrides across the periodic table and highlights the opportunities for materials design from the emerging understanding of structure–property relationships in these compounds...|$|E

To bypass bottlenecks {{occurring in the}} electrochemical performances of vanadium-based cathodes that derive from their intrinsic low electrical conductivity and ion diffusion coefficients, nano-engineering strategies have been implemented to 2 ̆ 2 create 2 ̆ 2 newly emerging properties that are unattainable at the bulk solid level. Integrating this concept into vanadium-based cathodes represents a promising way to circumvent the aforementioned problems as nanostructuring offers potential improvements in electrochemical performances by providing shorter mass transport distances, higher electrode/electrolyte contact interfaces, and better accommodation of strain upon lithium uptake/release. The significance of nanoscopic architectures has been exemplified in the literature, showing {{that the idea of}} developing vanadium-based nanostructures is an exciting prospect to be explored. In this review, we will be casting light on the recent advances in the synthesis of nanostructured vanadium-based cathodes. Furthermore, efficient strategies such as hybridization with foreign matrices and elemental doping are introduced as a possible way to boost their electrochemical performances (e. g., rate capability, cycling stability) to a higher level. Finally, some suggestions relating to the perspectives for the future developments of vanadium-based cathodes are made to provide insight into their commercialization...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of graphene and the nanotechnology revolution brought {{new interest in}} Layered transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). First explored in the 1960 s, these TMDs are a subject of interest due to their wide range of material properties form semiconductor, metals, to superconductor. Through <b>intercalation</b> <b>chemistry,</b> there is additional flexibility to tune the materials’ parameters to the desired property. Naturally semiconducting, Group 6 TMDs (i. e. MoS 2) have the most potential for future electronic application. Yet these Group 6 TMDs are also the most chemically inert. While over 240 organic-TMD complexes have been made reported for Group 4 (i. e. TiS 2) and Group 5 (i. e. TaS 2) TMDs, for 50 years, organic complexes of Group 6 TMDs remained unexplored. With the goal of tailoring the properties of Group 6 TMDs, we followed three different experimental approaches. We begin by pursuing liquid phase exfoliation to produce few/mono layer products and use contact angle measurement to infer the thermodynamic of the exfoliated materials in mixed solvents. We expanded a pen-paper vibrational model of 2 H-MoS 2 to analyze the vibrational spectra of WS 2 -xSex alloy with a tunable optical gap. Inspired by Lithium based intercalation methods, we propose a new and direct electrochemical intercalation route to produce Organic-MoS 2 complexes using quaternary ammonium compounds. We use the same electrochemical concept and show that the theory is sufficiently robust, allowing intercalation onto Layered Black Phosphorus (BP) ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports a}} number of recent {{developments}} in the <b>intercalation</b> <b>chemistry</b> of Al(OH) (3). From Rietveld refinement and solid-state NMR, it has been possible to develop a structural model for the recently reported [M(II) Al(4) (OH) (12) ](NO(3)) (2) ·yH(2) O family of layered double hydroxides (LDHs). The M(2 +) cations occupy half of the octahedral holes in the Al(OH) (3) layers, and it is thought that there is complete ordering of the metal ions while the interlayer nitrate anions are highly disordered. Filling the remainder of the octahedral holes in the layers proved impossible. While the intercalation of Li salts into Al(OH) (3) is facile, {{it was found that the}} intercalation of M(II) salts is much more capricious. Only with Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn nitrates and Zn sulfate were phase-pure LDHs produced. In other cases, there is either no reaction or a phase believed to be an LDH forms concomitantly with impurity phases. Reacting Al(OH) (3) with mixtures of M(II) salts can lead to the production of three-metal M(II) -M(II) '-Al LDHs, but it is necessary to control precisely the starting ratios of the two M(II) salts in the reaction gel because Al(OH) (3) displays selective intercalation of M nitrate (Li > Ni > Co ≈ Zn). The three-metal M(II) -M(II) '-Al LDHs exhibit facile ion exchange intercalation, which has been investigated in the first energy dispersive X-ray diffraction study of a chemical reaction system performed on Beamline I 12 of the Diamond Light Source...|$|E
