2500|$|Organized {{crime is}} {{involved}} in the production and distribution of child pornography, which is found as a common element of organized crime profiles. Organized into groups to produce and distribute pornography, they are often called [...] "sex rings." [...] In 2003, an international police investigation uncovered a Germany-based child pornography ring involving 26,500 suspects who swapped illegal images on the Internet in 166 different countries. In a 2006 case, US and international authorities charged 27 people in nine states and three countries in connection with a child pornography ring that US federal authorities described as [...] "one of the worst" [...] they have discovered. The assistant secretary for Immigration and Customs Enforcement added that the case reflected three larger trends that are becoming more common in child pornography rings. One is the increasing prevalence of [...] "home-grown" [...] pornographic images that are produced by predators themselves, and include live streaming video images of children being abused, not just the circulation of repeated images. Another trend is the growing use of sophisticated security measures and of peer-to-peer networking, in which participants can share files with one another on their computers rather than downloading them from a web site. The group used encryption and <b>data</b> <b>destruction</b> software to protect the files and screening measures to ensure only authorized participants could enter the chat room. A third trend is the increasingly violent and graphic nature of the images involving the abuse of younger children.|$|E

40|$|In {{comparison}} to autoclave sterilization aseptic processing offers several advantages, e. g. less damage of important ingredients or high energy recovery. New applications of aseptic packaging would be offered for food products which still are mostly heated in containers, {{such as food}} containing particles, e. g. soups, dessert or baby food. Therefore, the count reductions of bacterial spores in solid materials were investigated. Comparing the count reductions in the liquid and in the solid phase a distinct shifting to higher D-values in the solid phase was observed. These kinetic data of the count reduction of spores in solid food offered the possibility of calculating the necessary heating parameters for particulate food in continous flow-systems.

If a liquid phase of high viscosity is used, a heating process which preserves food quality in a wide range is only possible up to diameters of about 10 mm.

40|$|Vertical {{deflections}} synthesised {{from the}} Earth Gravitational Model 2008 (EGM 2008) agree with astrogeodetic vertical deflections observed over mainland Britain to within ~ 1. 2 " RMS (north-south) and ~ 1. 4 " RMS (east-west), which is commensurate with values reported for North America, Australia {{and parts of}} continental Europe. For this assessment in Britain, there has been the additional need to transform the observed relative vertical deflections to absolute ones. Not applying horizontal datum transformations led to spurious results, so absolute vertical deflections must always be used to assess EGMs. Three datum transformations were trialled (three-parameter, seven-parameter and OSTN 02), which show similar results when considering the estimated ~ 0. 3 " precision of these historical (1950 to 1976) astrogeodetic observations.

How to achieve an effective data placement schema in hybrid cloud environment has become a crucial issue nowadays, especially with the new challenges brought by the security issues.
