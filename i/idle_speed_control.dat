50|$|Most engine {{systems have}} <b>idle</b> <b>speed</b> <b>control</b> {{built into the}} ECU. The engine RPM is {{monitored}} by the crankshaft position sensor which plays a primary role in the engine timing functions for fuel injection, spark events, and valve timing. Idle speed is controlled by a programmable throttle stop or an idle air bypass control stepper motor. Early carburetor-based systems used a programmable throttle stop using a bidirectional DC motor. Early Throttle body injection (TBI) systems used an idle air control stepper motor. Effective <b>idle</b> <b>speed</b> <b>control</b> must anticipate the engine load at idle.|$|E

In {{order to}} achieve a good <b>idle</b> <b>speed</b> stability, {{emission}} and economic effect for spark ignition engine, the air-fuel ratio has to been controlled under idle conditions. In this paper, an engine model for a 125 cc EFI motorcycle engine was established using the GT-power software, and a simulation and experimental study was performed when engine under <b>idle</b> <b>speed</b> condition.

5000|$|<b>Idle</b> <b>speed</b> (<b>idling,</b> or idle) is the {{rotational}} speed {{the engine runs}} on when the engine is uncoupled to the drivetrain and the throttle pedal isn't depressed (generally measured in revolutions per minute, or rpm, of the crankshaft of a combustion engine). The idle differs in two ways engine idle and vehicle <b>idle.</b> At <b>idle</b> <b>speed,</b> the engine generates enough [...] power to run reasonably smoothly and operate its ancillaries (water pump, alternator, and, if equipped, other accessories such as power steering), but usually not enough to perform useful work, such as moving an automobile. For a passenger-car engine, <b>idle</b> <b>speed</b> is customarily between 600 rpm and 1,000 rpm. For buses and trucks it is approximately 540 rpm. In case of many single-cylinder motorcycle engines, <b>idle</b> <b>speed</b> is set between 1200-1500 rpm.|$|R

40|$|<b>Idle</b> <b>speed</b> <b>control</b> of ultra-lean burn engines {{continues}} to be a major focus of automotive engineers owing to the benefits offered in terms of fuel economy and emissions reduction. This paper applies a recently proposed linear time varying model predictive approach for the <b>idle</b> <b>speed</b> <b>control</b> of ultra-lean burn internal combustion engines. Unlike conventional gasoline engines, the approach uses fuel flow as the primary control variable to compensate for sudden fluctuations in engine load resulting in a fuel assisted <b>idle</b> <b>speed</b> <b>control</b> strategy. Simultaneously, the spark angle is maintained at a value so as to yield maximum brake torque while the emissions are reduced to negligibly low levels by constraining the engine operation to ultra-lean burn mode.

40|$|The {{performance}} {{comparison of}} PID controllers for <b>idle</b> <b>speed</b> <b>control</b> {{internal combustion engine}} (ICE) is presented in this paper. There are three methods of PID tuning applied: heuristic tuning, self-tuning by pole placement, and also iterative learning algorithm (ILA). Prior to that, data collection is gained from four cylinder sparkignition engine modeling and used as the input-output data in the system identification part. The obtained transfer function from RLS technique {{is used in the}} development of the control system for the <b>idle</b> <b>speed</b> <b>control</b> by PID controllers. The main objective of the <b>idle</b> <b>speed</b> <b>control</b> is to maintain the idling speed at 650 rpm and to reject as quickly as possible the extra load exerted on the engine system during idling mode. Comparing the three methods, it shows that PID tuning by ILA produced better results than heuristic tuning and pole placement...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} <b>idle</b> <b>speed</b> <b>control</b> of hydrogen fueled internal combustion engine (H 2 ICE) using model predictive control (MPC) and sampled data control (SDC) theories. In the first step, results from SDC theory and a version of MPC are collectively employed to obtain a rigorously developed new generic control strategy. Here, a controller, based on a family of approximate discrete time models, is designed within a previously proposed framework to have guaranteed practical asymptotic stability of the exact (unknown) discrete time model. Controller design, accomplished using MPC theory, is facilitated by successive online linearizations of the nonlinear discrete time model at each sampling instant. In the second step, the technique is implemented in the <b>idle</b> <b>speed</b> <b>control</b> of hydrogen internal combustion engine (H 2 ICE). Various conditions under which this theory can be implemented are presented and their validity for <b>idle</b> <b>speed</b> <b>control</b> problem are discussed.

40|$|<b>Idle</b> <b>speed</b> <b>control</b> is {{investigated}} for a direct injection, spark ignition, stratified charge (DISC) engine {{equipped with an}} electronic throttle. Such engines can be operated in multiple combustion modes. When operating in stratified charge combustion mode, they {{are very different from}} conventional stoichiometric engines, creating new opportunities for improved speed control. With current after-treatment technology, simultaneous high fuel economy and emissions conversion efficiency cannot be achieved by operating the engine in a steady-state manner: it must be cycled between running ultra-lean (for fuel economy) and rich (to service the after-treatment system). An <b>idle</b> <b>speed</b> <b>control</b> system is designed to meet the considerable feedback control demands required by these new engines. Copyright © 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|E

40|$|Model Predictive Control (MPC) can enable {{powertrain}} {{systems to}} satisfy more stringent vehicle requirements. To illustrate this, we {{consider an application}} of MPC to <b>idle</b> <b>speed</b> regulation in spark ignition engines. Improved <b>idle</b> <b>speed</b> regulation can translate into improved fuel economy, while improper control can lead to engine stalls. From a control point of view, <b>idle</b> <b>speed</b> regulation is challenging, since the plant is subject to time delay and constraints. In this chapter, we first obtain a control-oriented model where ancillary states are added to account for delay and performance specifications. Then the MPC optimization problem is defined. The MPC feedback law is synthesized as a piecewise affine function, suitable for implementation in automotive microcontrollers. The obtained design has been extensively tested in a vehicle under different operating conditions. Finally, we show how competing requirements can be met by a switched MPC controller...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{application}} of the Continuous Action Reinforcement Learning Automata (CARLA) methodology to PID controller parameter tuning. The PID controller parameters are initially set using the standard Zeigler-Nichols methods. The CARLA then selects parameters stochastically based on a distribution that converges to a Gaussian around the optimal parameter values. The CARLA adaptively tunes the controller parameters on-line, to minimise a performance criterion such as the sum of time error square. The method has the benefit of producing a controller with improved performance over the Zeigler-Nichols settings that is robust to noise and to the system non-linearities. Minimal system modelling is requires since it can be applied on-line optimising the parameters for the actual system. The method is demonstrated on various different systems in simulation. It is also demonstrated as a practical example for parameter tuning of a PID controller of an engine <b>idle</b> <b>speed</b> <b>control</b> system for a Ford Zetec 1. 8 engine during load change disturbances. <b>Idle</b> <b>speed</b> <b>control</b> is important to prevent engine stall and to help to reduce vehicle emissions...|$|E
