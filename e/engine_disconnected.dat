40|$|The {{performance}} of the A. D. Little number two cryostat has been so pleasing {{that it has been}} called upon to carry the whole load of helium production for the past several months. The number one cryostat is undergoing modification so that {{it will be able to}} duplicate the {{performance of}} the number two cryostat as to rate of production and convenience of assembly. It has been found that it is possible to operate the cryostat with the upper or large <b>engine</b> <b>disconnected.</b> The refrigeration from the liquid nitrogen pre-cooling of the radiation shield is substituted for this engine. The cooling time is a bit longer and the rate of production is a little less when the lower or small engine is used alone. This points out that it is possible to maintain operation if the large engine develops trouble; pre-cooling and the small engine will maintain operation until it is con-venient to take time-out to adjust or repair the large engine. The following figures on cryostat operation are for the three-month period ending June 1, 1949 : number of runs [...] 35 experiments serviced [...] . * 84 k number of liquid helium transfers [...] 146 R. P. Cavileer, J. W. Toomey, Jr. 1. Intermediate Supply of Liquid Helium It had become apparent that research problems would arise utilizing liquid helium in which it would be awkward to transfer the liquid helium directly from the cryostat to the experiment. Therefore a mobile supply would be desirable and most useful. The accompanying sketch illustrates the essentials of the scheme. The Dewar is a commercial five-liter American Thermos which was stripped and then resilvered with a window so that the level of the liquid could be observed. - 21...|$|E

5000|$|The {{effect of}} this {{arrangement}} was that the gear ratio between an engine and the output shaft depended on how many engines were driving the transmission. Gear ratio selection was accomplished not by [...] "changing gear" [...] in the conventional sense, but by filling or draining the hydraulic couplings to connect or <b>disconnect</b> the <b>engines</b> from the transmission. With only one hydraulic coupling filled with oil {{and the other three}} <b>engines</b> <b>disconnected</b> and their respective input shafts to the transmission locked by the one-way clutches, the single engine drove the output shaft through an effective gear ratio of 4:1. With two engines driving, the effective gear ratio was 2:1; with three engines, 1.33:1; and with all four engines, unity. In other words, the effective gear ratio of the transmission was the inverse of the number of engines driving it.|$|R

40|$|To {{cut down}} the costs caused by the {{additional}} starter, single-motor P 2 hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) {{make use of the}} driving motor to propel the vehicle as well as start the engine, and accordingly the engine-start control becomes more difficult. To satisfy the passengers’ demands, this paper developed different coordinated engine-start control strategies with respect to different situations. First, a detailed model for the single-motor P 2 HEVs system was built and related parameters were presented. Then, the coordinated engine-start control architecture for the internal combustion <b>engine</b> (ICE), <b>engine</b> <b>disconnect</b> clutch (EDC), electric motor (EM) and 8 -speed automatic transmission (AT) was analyzed. Considering with the different driving situations, soft start strategy and dynamical start strategy are individually proposed. Through the simulation, the above control strategies were validated in accordance with their control objectives. Last, to optimize the trade-off between driving performance and riding comfort, some key parameters were further discussed. This work not only decreases the difficulty of engine-start control in the single-motor P 2 HEVs but also is helpful {{to improve the quality of}} engine-start...|$|R

50|$|New York {{departed}} Fort Monroe on 17 January 1898 for Key West. After {{the declaration}} of the Spanish-American War in April, she steamed to Cuba and bombarded the defenses at Matanzas before joining other American ships at San Juan in May, seeking the Spanish squadron. Not finding them, they bombarded Castillo San Felipe del Morro at San Juan (12 May) before withdrawing. New York then became flagship of Admiral William T. Sampson's squadron, as the American commander planned the campaign against Santiago. However, New York was taking Admiral Sampson to a meeting with Major General William Shafter when the Spanish fleet made its breakout attempt, some of her <b>engines</b> were <b>disconnected</b> which reduced her speed, and she was only {{able to participate in}} the closing phases of the battle.

5000|$|Early {{submarines}} used {{a direct}} mechanical {{connection between the}} engine and propeller, switching between diesel engines for surface running, and electric motors for submerged propulsion.

5000|$|Automatic and semi-automatics {{typically}} use a {{centrifugal clutch}} which operates {{in a different}} fashion. At idle, the <b>engine</b> is <b>disconnected</b> from the gearbox input shaft, allowing both it and the bike to freewheel (unlike torque converter automatics, there is no [...] "idle creep" [...] with a properly adjusted centrifugal clutch). As the throttle is opened and engine speed rises, counterweights attached to movable inner friction surfaces (connected to the engine shaft) within the clutch assembly are thrown gradually further outwards, until they start {{to make contact with}} the inside of the outer housing (connected to the gearbox shaft) and transmit an increasing amount of engine power. The effective [...] "bite point" [...] is found automatically by equilibrium where the power being transmitted through the (still-slipping) clutch is equal to what the engine can provide. This allows relatively fast full-throttle takeoffs (with the clutch adjusted so the engine will be turning near its maximum-torque rpm) without the engine slowing or bogging down, as well as more relaxed starts and low-speed maneuvers at lower throttle settings and rpms.|$|R

5000|$|In September 2011, BOEMRE and the Coast Guard {{published}} {{its final}} investigative {{report on the}} accident. In essence, that report states that the main cause was the defective cement job, and Halliburton, BP and Transocean were, in different ways, responsible for the accident. [...] The report consists of two volumes. Volume I contains {{the report of the}} US Coast Guard. [...] That volume states that, although the events leading to the sinking of Deepwater Horizon were set into motion by the failure to prevent a well blowout, the investigation revealed numerous systems deficiencies, and acts and omissions by Transocean and its Deepwater Horizon crew, that had an adverse impact on the ability to prevent or limit the magnitude of the disaster. These included poor maintenance of electrical equipment that may have ignited the explosion, bypassing of gas alarms and automaticshutdown systems that could prevent an explosion, and lack of training of personnel on when and how to shut down <b>engines</b> and <b>disconnect</b> the MODU from the well to avoid a gas explosion and mitigate the damage from an explosion and fire. These deficiencies indicate that Transocean’s failure to have an effective safety management system and instill a culture that emphasizes and ensures safety contributed to this disaster. This investigation also revealed that the oversight and regulation of Deepwater Horizon by its flag state, the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI), was ineffective in preventing this casualty. By delegating all of its inspection activities to “recognized organizations,” without itself conducting on board oversight surveys, the RMI effectively abdicated its vessel inspection responsibilities.|$|R
50|$|The M10 and M10A1 were {{mechanically}} identical {{except for}} their power plants. The M10 used the General Motors 6046, {{consisting of two}} Detroit Diesel 6-71 inline engines mated to a common crankshaft. The tandem engine produced 375 horsepower (280 kW) at 2,100 rpm. One advantage of the GM 6046 was that the <b>engines</b> could be <b>disconnected</b> at will from the crankshaft and run independently. If one of the engines was damaged or destroyed, it could be disconnected and the other engine used to move the vehicle. The engine of the M10A1 was the Ford GAA, an 8-cylinder derivative of an ill-fated V-12 aircraft engine project. It produced 450 horsepower (335 kW) at 2,600 rpm. When tested {{side by side in}} September 1943, the M10A1 was judged to have superior automotive performance to the M10. Even though it produced only slightly less torque, the M10A1's engine was far lighter, and used a common fuel {{like the rest of the}} Army's vehicles (gasoline). By the time the test results were released in February 1944, the Army was committed to using the M10 overseas. As a result, the M10A1 was kept in the United States for training.|$|R
5000|$|All LCI(L) were {{twin shaft}} {{propelled}} by two banks of Detroit Diesel 6-71 [...] "Quad" [...] Diesel engines {{that produced a}} total of 1600 BHP. These engines were a wartime expedient design that utilized existing and readily available engines. Four 2-stroke Detroit Diesel 6-71 (inline 6 cylinder with 71 cubic inch displacement per cylinder) with Roots blower were coupled to create a bank {{for each of the}} two propeller shafts. The 4 engines per bank were joined together using individual drive clutches hence the name [...] "Quad Diesel". If a single engine were to fail, the broken <b>engine</b> could be <b>disconnected</b> from the unit via its clutch and repaired while the other 3 engines were still operating. General Motors Corporation Electro-Motive Division supplied the reduction gears, propellers, drive shafts and control units. Each of the two propellers was a reversible pitch propeller, which allowed the propeller shaft to spin only in one direction for either ahead or astern operation. This, coupled {{with the use of a}} stern anchor which was dropped as the ship approached the beach, was used to pull the ship off the beach after the troops had disembarked.

On July 20, 1977, the incline was again used as an escape route, evacuating residents from the valley amid rising floodwaters. It also carried [...] "boats, emergency personnel, and equipment down to the valley to aid in rescue operations". The incline was again sold for $1 by Westmont borough on March 8, 1983, to the Cambria County Transit Authority, now CamTran. CamTran initiated a $4.2 million renovation on September 7, 1983, replacing [...] "the incline's foundation piers, structural steel, and track." [...] The renovations were completed on August 22, 1984, and the incline was rededicated on September 6. It was designated an Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) in September 1994. A footbridge spanning Pennsylvania Route 56 between the incline and Vine Street was opened around the same time. On September 1, 2000, the incline was closed when the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) undertook an $2.3 million renovation of the bridge and the access road leading to the bridge. It was reopened in April 2001, but again closed in September to allow PennDOT to finish repairs to the bridge deck. The repairs were completed on December 14, 2001. A strong thunderstorm disrupted power to the incline on April 16, 2010, stranding the cars and two passengers almost halfway down the slope; the rescue took three hours and ended when firefighters rappelled down the tracks to reach the car. The Johnstown Inclined Plane was closed from September 9 to October 14, 2010, for the installation of a new 9000 lb [...] "hoist brake shaft." [...] From October 29 to October 31, 2012, CamTran shut down the incline fearing power outages due to the passage of Hurricane Sandy. During the annual Thunder in the Valley motorcycle rally, two resistors failed and stopped the incline just outside the stations on June 28, 2014; repairs took approximately a month after having experts brought in diagnose the failure. Sensor issues briefly disrupted service in August 2014 and, again, December 2014 forcing the incline to start its winter maintenance period early.|$|R
