50|$|One of the {{recognized}} medical therapies for prevention of stones is the thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics, such as chlorthalidone or <b>indapamide.</b> These drugs inhibit {{the formation of}} calcium-containing stones by reducing urinary calcium excretion.

Thiazides work best for renal leak hypercalciuria (high urine calcium levels), {{a condition in which}} high urinary calcium levels are caused by a primary kidney defect.

50|$|In medicine, diuretics {{are used}} to treat heart failure, liver cirrhosis, hypertension, influenza, water poisoning, and certain kidney diseases.

Diuretics are often abused by those with eating disorders, especially bulimics, in attempts to lose weight. The antihypertensive actions of some diuretics (thiazides and loop diuretics in particular) are independent of their diuretic effect. That is, the reduction in blood pressure is not due to decreased blood volume resulting from increased urine production, but occurs through other mechanisms and at lower doses than that required to produce diuresis. <b>Indapamide</b> was specifically designed with this in mind, and has a larger therapeutic window for hypertension (without pronounced diuresis) than most other diuretics.|$|E

40|$|<b>Indapamide</b> is a sulfonamide {{diuretic}} {{agent that}} has antihypertensive properties. In the canine femoral artery, indomethacin reduces the endothelium-dependent relaxation induced by bradykinin, and <b>indapamide</b> restores the response. The {{aim of this}} study was to determine whether <b>indapamide</b> affects the release or the effects of endothelium-derived nitric oxide and prostanoids. The effect of <b>indapamide</b> on the production of endothelium-derived nitric oxide and prostacyclin was assessed indirectly by the measurement of the tissue content of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (GMP) and the accumulation of 6 -keto-prostaglandin F(1 α) in the incubation medium, respectively. <b>Indapamide</b> did not affect the basal production of either cyclic GMP, cyclic adenosine monophosphate (AMP), or 6 -keto-prostaglandin F(1 α) in the presence or absence of indomethacin. Indomethacin decreased the production of cyclic AMP and the release of 6 -keto-prostaglandin F(1 α) induced by bradykinin, and this was unaffected by <b>indapamide.</b> <b>Indapamide</b> enhanced the bradykinin-stimulated production of cyclic GMP in the presence of indomethacin and did not affect that evoked by 3 morpholino-sydnonimine, an exogenous donor of nitric oxide. Indomethacin had no significant effect on the production of cyclic GMP stimulated by either bradykinin or 3 morpholino-sydnonimine. These studies demonstrate that the potentiation by <b>indapamide</b> of the relaxation evoked by bradykinin is associated with an enhanced production of cyclic GMP in the presence of indomethacin, which suggests that the production of endothelium-derived nitric oxide is increased. This potentiation may be mediated by an interaction of <b>indapamide</b> with the prostacyclin and cyclic AMP pathways, or it may be associated with the scavening effect of <b>indapamide</b> against the oxygen-derived free radicals produced by the activation of arachidonic acid metabolism. Alternatively, an interaction of <b>indapamide</b> with the metabolism of kinins may contribute to the potentiation of the response to bradykinin. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Vivencio Barrios, 1 Carlos Escobar 2 1 Department of Cardiology, Hospital Ramon y Cajal, 2 Department of Cardiology, Hospital La Paz, Madrid, Spain Abstract: Combined {{therapy is}} {{required}} {{in the majority of}} patients with hypertension to achieve blood pressure (BP) targets. Although different antihypertensive drugs can be combined, not all combinations are equally effective and safe. In this context, the combination of a renin angiotensin system inhibitor with a diuretic, usually a thiazide, particularly hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) or thiazide-like diuretics, such as chlorthalidone or <b>indapamide,</b> is recommended. However, not all diuretics are equal. Although HCTZ, chlorthalidone, and <b>indapamide</b> as add-on therapy effectively reduce BP levels, the majority of studies have obtained greater BP reductions with chlorthalidone or <b>indapamide</b> than with HCTZ. Moreover, there are data showing benefits with chlorthalidone or <b>indapamide</b> beyond BP. Thus, chlorthalidone seems to have pleiotropic effects beyond BP reduction. Moreover, compared with placebo, chlorthalidone has small effects on fasting glucose and total cholesterol, and compared with HCTZ, chlorthalidone achieves significantly lower total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Similarly, <b>indapamide</b> has demonstrated no negative impact on glucose or lipid metabolism. More importantly, although head-to-head clinical trials comparing the effects of <b>indapamide</b> or chlorthalidone with HCTZ are not available, indirect comparisons and post hoc analyses suggest that the use of chlorthalidone or <b>indapamide</b> is associated with a reduction in cardiovascular events. Despite this, the most frequent diuretic used in clinical practice as add-on therapy for hypertension is HCTZ. The purpose of this review is to update the published data on the efficacy and safety of HCTZ, chlorthalidone, and <b>indapamide</b> as add-on therapy in patients with hypertension.

Design: Descriptive analysis using reports from the database of the Adverse Drug Reactions Advisory Committee (ADRAC). Main outcome measures: Numbers of reports of hyponatraemia and hypokalaemia; proportion of such reports in total reports of adverse reactions to each drug; severity of electrolyte disturbances. Results: Between August 1984 and September 2000, 84 Australian reports of hyponatraemia and 87 reports of hypokalaemia, in which <b>indapamide</b> was the sole suspected drug, were submitted to ADRAC. Most reports involved an <b>indapamide</b> dose of 2. 5 mg daily. There was a significantly greater proportion of reports of hyponatraemia with <b>indapamide</b> and with the hydrochlorothiazide and amiloride combination than with chlorothiazide; hypokalaemia was significantly more common for <b>indapamide</b> than for the other two drugs.

40|$|Combined {{treatment}} with the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor delapril and the diuretic <b>indapamide</b> prevented vascular damage in vital organs of salt-loaded stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRsp). Whether the changes occurring after long-term hypertension {{could also be}} modulated in large arteries was investigated. Two-month-old SHRsp were salt loaded and treated with the drug regimen until they reached 50 +/- 10 mortality or around midlife. In a first experiment, delapril (12 mg/kg) and <b>indapamide</b> (1 mg/kg) were administered daily separately or in combination. In the second dose-finding experiment, delapril (6, 3, 1. 5 mg/kg) and <b>indapamide</b> (0. 5, 0. 25, 0. 125 mg/kg) in decreasing dose combinations were analyzed. Ultrastructural, histomorphometric, and biochemical studies were performed on the thoracic aorta. When compared with delapril (12 mg/kg) or <b>indapamide</b> (1 mg/kg) administered individually for 5 months, the combination 12 + 1 mg/kg was able to prevent the increase in extracellular matrix deposition observed in other treatment groups, as assessed by histomorphometry or 4 -OH-proline biochemical determination.

40|$|<b>Indapamide</b> is an effecctive {{antihypertensive}} {{agent in}} humans and in experimental hypertensive animals. The {{aim of the}} present study was to investigate whether <b>indapamide</b> affects endothelium-dependent and independent relaxations in canine femoral arteries. Rings (with or without endothelium) were contracted with prostaglandin F(2 α) (2 x 10 - 6 mol/liter) before the addition, in a cumulative fashion, of relaxing agents. <b>Indapamide</b> (10 - 7 to 10 - 4 mol/liter) had no direct effect on unstimulated or prostaglandin-stimulated preparations; it did not alter relaxations of preparations with endothelium induced by acetylcholine, bradykinin, adenosine diphosphate or the calcium ionophore A 23187. Similarly, it did not affect relaxations induced by sodium nitroprusside, prostacyclin or forskolin in preparations with or without endothelium. Indomethacin shifted the concentration-response curve to bradykinin to the right and did not alter that to the other relaxing drugs. The reduced relaxation to bradykinin was reversed in a concentration-dependent manner by <b>indapamide</b> (10 - 7 to 10 - 5 mol/liter). In the presence of indomethacin, <b>indapamide</b> shifted the concentration response curve to prostacyclin (in rings with endothelium) and to forskolin (in rings with and without endothelium) to the left. Thus, <b>indapamide</b> does not directly affect endothelium-dependent and independent relaxations.

40|$|Objectives: To {{investigate}} the usage pattern of <b>indapamide</b> and other antihypertensive drugs in patients attending a community-based government outpatient clinic (GOPC) or a hospital-based specialist clinic (SC). The plasma potassium concentrations of patients receiving <b>indapamide</b> and other diuretics were also examined. Method: Prescriptions from the SC and the GOPC were reviewed and collected during January 1998. Patients' plasma potassium concentrations {{and the date}} of initiation of each medication were retrieved from the hospital computer databases at SC. An age- and sex-matched control group of patients on non-diuretic antihypertensive drugs was identified. Results: A total of 1648 and 773 prescriptions were collected from the SC during a 1 -week period and GOPC during a 1 -month period, respectively. Approximately half (45 %) of the patients received antihypertensive treatment. <b>Indapamide</b> was five times more frequently prescribed in GOPC than SC (84. 7 vs. 17. 7 %, P < 0. 001). Calcium channel blocking agents were the commonest antihypertensive drugs used in both clinics. The mean plasma potassium concentration of patients taking <b>indapamide</b> was {{lower than that of}} the control group (P = 0. 037). Multiple linear regression analysis showed that consumption of <b>indapamide</b> (P = 0. 002) and duration of diuretic therapy (P = 0. 023) were significantly related to changes in plasma potassium concentrations [multiple regression equation for potassium level = 4. 09 - 0. 145 (thiazide = 1) - 0. 377 (<b>indapamide</b> = 1) - 0. 00468 (duration of diuretic therapy in months) ]. Conclusion: <b>Indapamide</b> was used extensively in the community clinic and less in the hospital-based outpatient clinic. Patients receiving <b>indapamide</b> had a significantly lower plasma potassium concentration as compared to other diuretics or antihypertensive groups and this was predicted by a multiple linear regression model.
