My husband and I got involved and were really moved and horrified. As I was writing the song I was putting myself in that place – what would <b>it</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> to be trapped? Threatened? Alone? Unable to tell anyone what was happening because you're afraid of what would happen?" ...|$|E
500|$|Unlike in a {{traditional}} film soundtrack, Moore often wrote music [...] "not necessarily to always match the images on the screen, but to sometimes play against it." [...] Moore explained that {{a traditional}} soundtrack needs to convey {{the mood of the}} scene and advance the film's storyline, but {{that he did not have}} to do that with Graveyard Mountain Home [...] "because the director's not around". [...] "I thought, well what would <b>it</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> if I did a totally different kind of mood than this scene is trying to convey? When you put that music with that scene what happens there? Sometimes it's kind of interesting what happens," [...] Moore explained.|$|E
500|$|A key to Lord's {{method is}} his {{technique}} of adopting an unconventional {{approach to the}} chronology of the event, [...] " [...] an imaginative approach to time and space in which hours and minutes prove extremely malleable, the ship itself seems almost infinitely complex, and the disaster assumes order and unity from far away." [...] In short it is [...] "a modernist narrative [...] around a modernist event." [...] Reviewers highlighted {{the way in which}} Lord depicted the human side of the Titanic story, which The New York Times called [...] "the core of Mr. Lord's account, and explains its fascination, a pull as powerful in its way as the last downward plunge of the ship itself." [...] While the [...] "legendary acts of gallantry" [...] stood out, the book invites readers to put themselves in the place of those aboard and implicitly asks how they would react in the same situation. As Newsweek put it, [...] "What would <b>it</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> to be aboard a sinking ocean liner?" ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In {{this article}} I {{distinguish}} {{the notion of}} there being something <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> to <b>be</b> {{a certain kind of}} creature from that of there being something <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> to have a certain kind of experience. Work on consciousness has typically dealt with the latter while employing the language of the former. I propose several ways of analyzing what <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> to <b>be</b> a certain kind of creature and find problems with them all. The upshot is that even if there <b>is</b> something <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> to have certain kinds of experience, it does not follow that there <b>is</b> anything <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> to <b>be</b> a certain kind of creature. Skepticism about the existence of something that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> to <b>be</b> an F is recommended...|$|R

500|$|Echevarria {{suggested}} this to Behr over lunch, but {{he initially}} was not sure. By {{the time they}} had returned separately to the studio, Behr had an entire plan worked out based on the new premise for the character. Behr suggested that the character should be basically acting as if she's schizophrenic, saying [...] "We'd never played up the idea in the past, but it made sense. What must <b>it</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> to hear all those voices and opinions?" [...] The producers also decided that they wanted a younger actress who felt vulnerable in order to offset the strength that Jadzia had grown into over the years. Casting remained difficult, until Hans Beimler suggested an actress from Canada whom he had once worked with – Nicole de Boer. She had worked with Beimler on the television series Beyond Reality and TekWar. She was asked to submit an audition tape where she played out a scene between Ezri and Quark, which she recorded herself in the hotel room she was staying at, and later admitted that she did not know what a Trill was at the time.|$|E
2500|$|Brodovitch's {{task was}} to bring American {{advertising}} design up {{to the level of}} Europe's, which was thought to have a far more modern spirit. Before his arrival, advertising students were simply copying the magazine styles of N. C. Wyeth and Howard Pyle. The illustrations were beautiful, but had evolved from the tradition of 19th-century romantic realism, a thing of the past. Brodovitch's teaching technique, on the other hand, was unlike any other the students had been exposed to. He would always teach with a visual aid. Brodovitch would bring into class French and German magazines to examine the pages with his students, explaining the artist's work or technique. He would raise questions like, [...] "Could this line be better? Could <b>it</b> <b>be</b> <b>like,</b> for example, Cocteau?" [...] When not in the classroom, Brodovitch would take the class on outings around Philadelphia to see factories, laboratories, shopping centers, housing projects, dumps, and the zoo. The students were then told to make a [...] "graphic impression" [...] of what they had seen, whether a photographic interpretation, a drawing, or an abstraction. [...] Brodovitch did not teach in the conventional sense, but rather compelled his students to discover one's inner, creative resources.|$|E

40|$|A {{widespread}} assumption {{in current}} philosophy of {{mind is that}} a conscious state’s phenomenal properties vary with its representational contents. In this paper, I present (rather dogmatically) an alternative picture that recognizes two kinds of phenomenal properties that do not vary concomitantly with content. First, it admits phenomenal properties that vary rather with attitude: what <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> {{for me to see}} rain is phenomenally different from what <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> for me to remember (indistinguishable) rain, which is different again form what <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> for me to visualize (indistinguishable) rain – where these differences cannot be traced back to variations in content. Secondly, {{there is a kind of}} phenomenal property that varies neither with content nor with attitude but is altogether invariant across all conscious states: a substantive phenomenal commonality among what <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> for me to see, remember, and visualize rain, cats, or dogs. This substantive commonality, I will suggest, is the for-me-ness component of what <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> for me to have any of these experiences. I will close by discussing the interrelations among these three concentric layers of phenomenality: content-based, attitude-based, and for-me-ness...|$|R
