40|$|Clustering is {{a useful}} data {{exploratory}} method with its wide applicability in multiple fields. However, data clustering greatly relies on initialization of cluster centers that can result in large intra-cluster variance and <b>dead</b> <b>centers,</b> therefore leading to sub-optimal solutions. This paper proposes a novel variance based version of the conventional Moving K-Means (MKM) algorithm called Variance Based Moving K-Means (VMKM) that can partition data into optimal homogeneous clusters, irrespective of cluster initialization. The algorithm utilizes a novel distance metric and a unique data element selection criteria to transfer the selected elements between clusters to achieve low intra-cluster variance and subsequently avoid <b>dead</b> <b>centers.</b> Quantitative and qualitative comparison with various clustering techniques is performed on four datasets selected from image processing, bioinformatics, remote sensing {{and the stock market}} respectively. An extensive analysis highlights the superior performance of the proposed method over other techniques.

40|$|Segmentation {{is one of}} {{the very}} {{important}} strategic tools used by the marketer. Segmentation strategy is based on the concept that no firm can satisfy all needs of one customer or one need of all the customers. The customers are too numerous and diverse in their buying requirements, hence the marketers or companies cannot cater to the requirements of all customers that too in a broad market such as two-wheelers. Cluster analysis is a class of techniques used to identify the group of customers with similar behaviors given a large database of customer data containing their properties and past buying records. Clustering {{is one of the}} unsupervised learning method in which a set of data points are separated into uniform groups. The k-means {{is one of the most}} widely used clustering techniques used for various applications.

40|$|A {{number of}} seven microhabitats {{evaluated}} for seeding establishment were: under {{the canopy of}} Chrysopogon aucheri plants, under the canopy of Chrysopogon jwarancusa plants, within <b>dead</b> <b>centers</b> of Cymbopogon sucheri plantws, within <b>dead</b> <b>centers</b> of Cymbopogon jwarancuse plants, under the canopy of Artemisia maritima plants, gravel interspaces between plants, and soil interspaces between plants. Seeding emergence and establishment were evaluated under the natural precipitation regime of the 1997 growing season and a simulated, above-normal precipitation regime. Soil moisture and soil temperature data were recorded during the entire growing season. Above-normal precipitation increased the density of emerged seedlings for both species in all microhabitats. Cymbopogon jwarancusa had higher seedling densities than Chyrsopogon aucheri. Monsoon rains in late July 1997 enhanced emergence of both species from recently disappeared seeds. Seedling of both species emerged after monsoon rains but did not survive {{to the end of}} the growing season. Gravel interspaces were suitable microhabitats for seedling development, possibly due to the vertical entrapment of dispersal units and reduced competition from more distant, established plants. Above-normal precipitation did not have a significant effect on tiller development for either species.

25|$|Like its predecessor, Left 4 Dead 2 is a first-person shooter {{with a heavy}} {{emphasis}} on cooperative gameplay. The game presents five new campaigns, each composed of three to five smaller levels. As in the first game, each campaign is presented in menus and loading screens as a film starring the four Survivors; and features, upon completing a campaign, a faux credits screen which acts as the final scoreboard for the players and recaps certain performance statistics for the group. In every campaign, most levels involve the Survivors attempting to reach a safe zone {{and close the door}} once they are all safely inside. However, the final level in each campaign requires the Survivors to call for rescue and either survive a prolonged onslaught until rescue arrives, pass through an especially challenging gauntlet of Infected to reach an escape vehicle, or (in <b>Dead</b> <b>Center</b> and The Passing) collect and utilize fuel cans to enable their escape.|$|E

40|$|The German Aerospace Center (DLR) is {{developing}} a free-piston engine as an innovative internal combustion engine for the generation of electrical power. The arrangement of the Free Piston Linear Generator (FPLG) in opposed-piston design consists of two piston units oscillating freely, thereby alternately compressing the common combustion chamber {{in the center of}} the unit and gas springs on either side. Linear alternators convert the kinetic energy of the moving pistons into electric energy. Since the pistons are not mechanically coupled to a crank train, the bottom and top <b>dead</b> <b>centers</b> of the piston movement can be varied during operation e. g. to adjust the compression ratio. Utilizing these degrees of freedom, the present paper deals with the analysis of different combustion processes in a port scavenged opposed-piston combustion chamber prototype.

Based on test bench results, a 3 D-CFD model, which has been used to develop the first prototype, is calibrated by actual measurements.
