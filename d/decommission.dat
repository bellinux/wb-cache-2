Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) {{published}} the final rule on Radiological Criteria for License Termination (the License Termination Rule or LTR) as Subpart E to 10 CFR Part 20. NRC regulations require that materials licensees submit <b>Decommissioning</b> Plans {{to support the}} <b>decommissioning</b> of its facility if it is required by license condition, or if the procedures and activities necessary {{to carry out the}} <b>decommissioning</b> have not been approved by NRC and these procedures could increase the potential health and safety impacts to the workers or the public. NRC regulations also require that reactor licensees submit Post-shutdown <b>Decommissioning</b> Activities Reports and License Termination Plans to support the <b>decommissioning</b> of nuclear power facilities. This paper provides an update on the status of the NRC's <b>decommissioning</b> program that was presented during WM' 02.

In responding to the questions, the NRC staff attempted to provide the answers in a clear and non-technical form.

40|$|The {{aging of}} {{research}} reactors worldwide {{has resulted in}} a heightened awareness in the international technical <b>decommissioning</b> community of the timeliness to review and address the needs of these research institutes in planning for and eventually performing the <b>decommissioning</b> of these facilities. By using the reactors already undergoing <b>decommissioning</b> as test beds for evaluating enhanced or new/innovative technologies for <b>decommissioning,</b> it is possible that new techniques could be made available for those future research reactor <b>decommissioning</b> projects. Potentially, the new technologies will result in: reduced radiation doses to the work force, larger safety margins in performing <b>decommissioning</b> and cost and schedule savings to the research institutes in performing the <b>decommissioning</b> of these facilities. Testing of these enhanced technologies for decontamination, dismantling, characterization, remote operations and worker protection are critical to furthering advancements in the technical specialty of <b>decommissioning.</b> Furthermore, regulatory acceptance and routine utilization for future research reactor <b>decommissioning</b> will be assured by testing and developing these technologies in realistically contaminated environments prior to use in the research reactors.

5|$|Following the 1991 Gulf War and the {{subsequent}} dissolution of the Soviet Union, the United States Navy began to <b>decommission</b> and mothball many of the ships it had brought out of its reserve fleet in the drive to attain a 600-ship Navy.

This included fifteen aircraft carriers, four battleships and over 100submarines, along with various other types of ships the overall plan specified. When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991 the Navy sought to return to its traditional, 313-ship composition.

The secretary was generally successful, and agreements were reached on this and other points, including settlements to disputes over islands in the Pacific, and limitations {{on the use of}} poison gas. The naval agreement was limited to battleships and to some extent aircraft carriers, and in the end did not prevent rearmament. Nevertheless, Harding and Hughes were widely applauded in the press for their work.

The tower's construction and its extensive use of asbestos mean that <b>decommission</b> and deconstruction has provided a technical stumbling block to redevelopment of the South Stoneham site. Physical disassembly would be hugely expensive, while explosives cannot be used due to the proximity of private houses and the Grade II* listed original building. Indeed, because the tower and kitchen/dining hall complex are physically linked to the original house by a glazed connection, the whole site, including the tower, shares the listed building status.|$|E

This chapter, along with the next four chapters, addresses various aspects of the methodological approaches being developed to estimate <b>decommissioning</b> costs. Each country has adopted a different strategy for reactor <b>decommissioning,</b> taking its political and technical situations into consideration.

5|$|The lake {{played a}} role in the {{evacuation}} of federal troops from Texas at the onset of the American Civil War. As Texas considered whether to secede from the United States, General David E. Twiggs, commander of federal troops in Texas negotiated with state leaders concerning the transfer of federal property. After learning of such negotiations, the United States military moved to <b>decommission</b> Twiggs, and replace him with Colonel Carlos Waite. Texas viewed this move as a rejection of the negotiations and proceeded to forcefully claim the federal property. Twiggs, while awaiting relief from Waite, surrendered the property on the condition that federal troops could peacefully evacuate. They were allowed to depart, but only from the Texas coast. Waite arrived and relocated troops near Green Lake, where they could await coastal departure near an adequate source of freshwater. During the stay, Fort Sumter fell under siege, and Texas grew concerned about the concentration of armed federal troops in the area. With their respective nations now at war, Texas considered the deal with Twiggs void, and began to capture federal troops to force them to either join the Confederacy or be Prisoners of War. Some of the remaining uncaptured companies elsewhere in the state attempted to flee to Green Lake. Several regiments camped by the lake later in the war, and complained about mosquitos.|$|E

This paper gives a short overview on <b>decommissioning</b> and dismantling strategies and techniques as {{an introduction to the}} applicability of radioactive metal waste recycling and reuse.
