500|$|During a {{world tour}} in 2001, the Malaysian {{government}} canceled the band's {{show in the}} nation's capital because the authorities had a negative perception of the group's image and music. The government pointed the band's mascot Vic Rattlehead as inappropriate and told the members {{that they would be}} arrested if they performed. Dave Mustaine responded: [...] "I recognize what the Malaysian government is trying to do, and it is admirable of them trying to protect the young people in the country. But <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>shows</b> the degree of ignorance and apathy that the government has toward the problem." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Our Song" [...] {{was directed by}} Trey Fanjoy. [...] While listening to [...] "Our Song", Fanjoy shared her ideals for a music video with Swift. [...] "She had this idea for a front porch performance and then a field of flowers for another performance, then a black-and-white performance shot. It all came together in her head. She was able to translate that so well onto film. <b>It</b> <b>just</b> <b>shows</b> what a truly great director she is", Swift informed CMT News. The video was conceptualized to be very fantasy-like and surreal. The video begins with a shot of Swift's toenails as she paints them. Swift, casually wearing a blue tank top, white hot pants, and straightened hair, is revealed to be engaging in a phone conversation in a bedroom. A cut-scene shows Swift affront her bedroom mirror, which she writes the word [...] "Love", before furtively approaching a front porch, seen in [...] a blue dress and curly hair. Swift then sits near the edge and performs [...] "Our Song". The scene transitions to Swift lying {{on a bed of}} flowers and wearing an orange evening gown. She holds a card that spells her first name. Then, clothed by a long, black dress, black cowboy boots, and black gloves, Swift sings with a microphone and a backup band behind her in front of a white backdrop. Throughout the remainder of the video, scenes alternate between previous settings and concludes with Swift giggling while sitting on the front porch.|$|E
2500|$|On December 2, 2013, Christie {{said at a}} {{press conference}} that Democrats were just playing {{politics}} by holding hearings into lane closures. [...] "Just because [...] John Wisniewski is obsessed with this, and [...] Loretta Weinberg, <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>shows</b> that they really have nothing to do," [...] Christie said. Christie later credited the e-mail documents subpoenaed by the hearings as the first information he had that his staff was involved. When reporter Matt Katz asked, [...] "Governor, did you {{have anything to do with}} these lane closures in September outside the GW Bridge? Have you spoken to--" [...] Christie dismissively joked [...] "I worked the cones, actually, Matt. Unbeknownst to everybody I was actually the guy out there. I was in overalls and a hat.

2500|$|The episode [...] "Turn, Turn, Turn" [...] reveals to the series' {{characters}} that Hydra has infiltrated S.H.I.E.L.D. For {{much of the}} episode, they believe that Agent Victoria Hand, who was introduced in [...] "The Hub", is a Hydra agent, and so the Big S.H.I.E.L.D. theme functions as the series' Hydra theme. Once John Garrett is revealed to be the traitor, and the Clairvoyant, the Centipede became the new Hydra theme, though McCreary continued to use his Garrett theme rather than outright replace it with the Hydra theme as Bill Paxton's [...] "performance after being revealed as the Clairvoyant is even more fun and energetic. So, his theme still fits him perfectly, <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>shows</b> us a different side of his personality." [...] With the second season came new Hydra characters, and their new MacGuffin, the Obelisk, for which McCreary wanted to use a Hydra theme. Feeling that his previous themes had become too complicated during the first season, and were too tied to that season's narrative, McCreary composed a new Hydra theme, which [...] "in true bad-guy-theme fashion ... is constructed from distantly related minor chords, and contains lots of close intervals." ...|$|E
2500|$|There was {{considerable}} negative {{reaction to the}} characters Mudflap and Skids, who some perceived as embodying racist stereotypes. Manohla Dargis of The New York Times said that [...] "the characters [...] indicate that minstrelsy remains as much in fashion in Hollywood as when, well, Jar Jar Binks was set loose by George Lucas". Critic Scott Mendelson said [...] "To say that these two are the most astonishingly racist caricatures that I've ever seen in a mainstream motion picture would be an understatement." [...] Harry Knowles, founder of Ain't It Cool News, went further, asking his readers [...] "not to support this film" [...] because [...] "you'll be taking [...] to see a film with the lowest forms of humor, stereotypes, and racism around." [...] Bay (the director) has attempted to defend the film as [...] "good clean fun" [...] and insisted that [...] "We're just putting more personality in." [...] Writers Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman responded to the controversy with [...] "It's really {{hard for us to}} sit here and try to justify it. I think that would be very foolish, and if someone wants to be offended by it, it's their right. We were very surprised when we saw it, too, and it's a choice that was made. If anything, <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>shows</b> you that we don't control every aspect of the movie." ...|$|E
2500|$|Duff McKagan {{praised the}} album, saying that [...] "Axl sounds amazing" [...] and [...] "I think Axl's finally made the record {{he always wanted}} to". Slash reacted {{positively}} to the title track, stating [...] "That sounds cool. It's good to hear Axl's voice again, y'know?" [...] When the album was released, Slash responded by saying [...] "It's a really good record. It's {{very different from what}} the original Guns N' Roses sounded like, but it's a great statement by Axl... It's a record that the original Guns N' Roses could never possibly make. And at the same time <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>shows</b> you how brilliant Axl is." [...] In a later interview, Slash stated the album was [...] "exactly what I thought it would sound like," [...] with many synthesizers and digital augmentations. Izzy Stradlin, soon after the album was released, said [...] "I have listened to some tracks off the record and I enjoyed them" [...] and [...] "I like what I've heard." [...] Steven Adler said he [...] "didn't like the album, not one bit." [...] Gilby Clarke stated [...] "I think it's a really good record – I honestly do. I think it's a great record... Knowing what I know what direction he wanted to take the band, I think he {{hit the nail on the}} head; I think he did a great job" [...] Matt Sorum called the album a 'toe-tapper'. Early Guns N' Roses guitarist Tracii Guns said he thought the album was [...] "over-indulgent, sterile and not that exciting." ...|$|E
