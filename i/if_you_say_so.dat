60|$|HIGGINS [sulkily] Oh, well, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>so,</b> I suppose I don't {{always talk}} like a bishop.|$|E
6000|$|... "All right, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>so,</b> Smoke. But Slavovitch {{seems the}} main squeeze. I'll just get an iron-bound option, black an' white, an' {{gather in the}} scatterin' first." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{just as well}} able to waltz {{with whom}} I like as you are, Julia; and <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>so</b> in that way, I shall think it's envy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But just look!" [...] pleaded Sam. [...] "Isn't that a {{good picture}} of <b>you?</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> don't <b>say</b> <b>so</b> {{yourself}} I'll give you five dollars." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes;--in a trap. Is {{there no}} trap here? <b>If</b> <b>you</b> will <b>say</b> <b>so,</b> I will {{acknowledge}} {{myself to be}} a dolt, and will beg your pardon." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If, {{when you}} know--a telegram. Even <b>if</b> <b>you</b> cannot <b>say</b> <b>so</b> much as 'Agreed,' still such a word as 'Favourable.' I just hang over the Void until I hear.|$|R
6000|$|... "Bery well, Massa Harold; <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>so,</b> dat's all right. Jake can git de wood easy enough; dere's plenty ob pieces among de {{firewood}} dat {{would do}} for us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>so,</b> I'll {{take you}} girls {{around to the}} French Shop," [...] {{suggested}} Dave, [...] "and then Ben and I can drive around to Mr. Wecks's shoe-store." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not {{the kind}} that's around here, my boy. These are the wildest and strongest kind. Howsomever, {{we can go}} after 'em <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>so.</b> When {{do you want to}} start?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Writing what? <b>Say,</b> <b>you</b> don't mind my {{putting you}} on the witness-stand, do <b>you?</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> do, <b>say</b> <b>so,</b> and I'll cut out the District Attorney act {{and talk about the}} weather.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It can be changed. It must be changed. Tell {{her that}} I am not good enough. You need not fear her. And <b>if</b> <b>you</b> will <b>say</b> <b>so,</b> I {{will never be}} angry with you for the word. I will bless you for it." ...|$|R
60|$|MRS. HOPE. Now, Mr. Lever, don't be offended! I'm {{very anxious}} for Tom {{to take the}} shares <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> the thing's <b>so</b> good.|$|R
60|$|Mr. J. C. Swift wishes a {{pass from}} me to follow your army to pick up rags and cast-off clothing. I will {{give it to him}} <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>so,</b> {{otherwise}} not.|$|E
6000|$|THE CALIFORNIAN. I didn't know there'd {{been any}} joke; but I suppose {{there must have}} been, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>so.</b> Who am I now, ma'am--your husband, or your baby, or your husband's wife, or-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{would be}} a pity, Judith, if you did think of clothes, over your parents' graves! We will never quit this spot, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>so,</b> and will let Hurry go where he pleases." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I didn't know it," [...] replied Peter, [...] "but <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> it is <b>so</b> I {{suppose it}} must be so. It is easier to believe {{than it is to}} believe that you are related to the Sparrows." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “They’ll hunt {{anything}} I {{tell them}} to, squire,” cried Natty, favoring {{the other with}} his laugh. “They’ll hunt <b>you,</b> <b>if</b> I <b>say</b> <b>so.</b> He-e-e-re, he-e-e-re, Hector—he-e-e-re, slut—come this a-way, pups—come this a- way-—come hither.” ...|$|R
6000|$|Peter drew a long breath. [...] "It is dreadfully hard {{to believe}} that I can have a cousin as big as that," [...] he exclaimed. [...] "But of course <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> it is <b>so,</b> it is so," [...] he hastened to add. [...] "Have I any other cousins {{anywhere}} near as big?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Hal made a wry face at Pat. [...] "Quit your kidding," [...] said he. [...] "We'll take {{a gallon}} of {{liniment}} <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>so.</b> Now tell us what else we'll need. Do we take guns?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{know you}} will, Phoebe, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>so.</b> Phoebe, love, when I see God, I shall thank Him for having made you {{so good and}} dear, and letting me have some comfort {{in one of my}} children.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Because {{they will}} bring the highest sum of any,--that's why. I could choose another, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>so.</b> The fellow made me a high bid on Eliza, if that would suit you any better," [...] said Mr. Shelby.|$|E
6000|$|... "Symptoms, yourself!" [...] {{interrupted}} the termagant. [...] "This {{is no time}} for bookish words, nor is this a place to stop and swallow medicines. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> are a-leg-weary, <b>say</b> <b>so,</b> as a plain-speaking man should; then seat yourself on the prairie, like a hound that is foot-sore, and take your natural rest." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'But Miss Dauncey {{has none}} of that narrowness of outlook which, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> forgive my <b>saying</b> <b>so,</b> is perhaps the secret of your strength. She has a {{delightful}} enthusiasm for every form of art. Beauty really means as much to her as bread and butter to the more soberly-minded. And she takes a passionate interest in the variety of life.' ...|$|R
6000|$|This {{morning we}} read the history of Adam's fall in the first Lesson. Now does this story seem strange to you, my friends? Do <b>you</b> <b>say</b> to yourselves, <b>If</b> I had been in Adam's place, I {{should never have been}} so foolish as Adam was? <b>If</b> <b>you</b> do <b>say</b> <b>so,</b> <b>you</b> cannot have looked at the story {{carefully}} enough. For <b>if</b> <b>you</b> do look at it carefully, I believe you will find enough in it to show you that it is a very NATURAL story, that we have the same nature in us that Adam had; that we are indeed Adam's children; and that the Bible speaks truth when it says, 'Adam begat a son after his own likeness.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am not," [...] {{said the}} guide. [...] "I am the tenderest-hearted {{person in the}} world; but even <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>so,</b> sir, I can't let a {{stranger}} stay all night in a camp that I've got charge of." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{beg your}} pardon, Jenny Wren," [...] said Peter very humbly. [...] "Of course Whip-poor-will has {{whiskers}} <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>so.</b> By the way, do the Whip-poor-wills do any {{better in the}} matter of a nest than the Nighthawks?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's jest {{what this}} is goin' to be. We're lettin' you off of a poundin' so's to show what can be done, an' <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>so</b> much as a word to old Donovan we'll pretty near kill you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As for thanking him," [...] she said, [...] "you {{can do that}} yourself, Aunt Margaret, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> like. I am not a bit {{obliged to}} him; but, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> choose to <b>say</b> <b>so,</b> <b>you</b> may; only pray do tell him to go away,--and tell him never, never to come back any more." [...] Then Mrs. Dosett {{returned}} to the drawing-room, and declared that her embassy had been quite in vain.|$|R
6000|$|... "I shall {{prove the}} contrary," [...] was the retort. [...] "I shall prove, <b>if</b> what <b>you</b> <b>say</b> is <b>so,</b> that the Church has erred through ignorance. And, furthermore, I hold that {{whatever}} is horrible in industrial society {{is due to}} the ignorance of the capitalist class. It will mend all that is wrong as soon as it receives the message. And this message it shall be the duty of the Church to deliver." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{was kept}} awake half {{of last night}} by drunken blackguards howling {{on the bridge of}} the Holy Trinity in the pure half-moonlight. This is the kind of discord I have to bear, {{corresponding}} to your uncongenial company. But, alas! Susie, you ought at ten years old to have more firmness, and to resolve that you won't be bored. I think I shall try to enforce it on you as a very solemn duty not to lie to people as the vulgar public do. <b>If</b> they bore <b>you,</b> <b>say</b> <b>so,</b> and they'll go away. That is the right state of things.|$|R
6000|$|... "Home!" [...] {{retorted}} Mrs. Lander. [...] "The'e's {{plenty of}} places where you can be safe from the fella besides home, though I'll take you back the'a this minute <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>so.</b> But you needn't to feel wo'ked up about it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>so,</b> papa, {{it must be}} so. I {{have told}} Aunt Harriet that I {{consider}} myself to be prohibited from meeting Mr. Lopez by what you have said; but I think, papa, you are a little--cruel to me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>so,</b> Mr. Jones, {{it is all}} right," [...] {{said the}} {{stranger}} with deference. [...] "Still, I confess that I miss my rubber. It is the first Saturday night for seven-and-twenty years that I have not had my rubber." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As to that I have, of course, to {{own that}} I have behaved foolishly;--worse than foolishly, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> choose to <b>say</b> <b>so.</b> <b>You</b> cannot condemn me more {{absolutely}} than I condemn myself. But I {{have made up}} my mind as to one thing. I will not marry where I do not love." [...] Oh, if Lily could have heard him as he then spoke! [...] "It would be impossible for me to speak in terms too high of Miss Dale; but I am quite sure that I could not make her happy as her husband." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{we will be}} good to him,--good to him in his degree. Of what avail to me {{will have}} been his goodness, {{if he is to}} rob me of the very {{treasure}} which his goodness helped to save? Is he to have all, because he gave some aid? Is he to take from me my heart's blood, because he bound up my arm when it was bruised? Because he helped me some steps on earth, is he to imprison me afterwards in hell? Good! No, he is not good in wishing so to destroy us. He is bad, greedy, covetous, self-seeking, a very dog, and by the living God he shall die like a dog unless you will free me from his fangs. You have not answered me. Will you tell me that you will discard him as a suitor for your hand? <b>If</b> <b>you</b> will <b>say</b> <b>so,</b> he shall receive tenfold reward for his--goodness. Answer me, Anna;--I claim an answer from you." ...|$|R
50|$|Founding member Kummerer devises the band's lyricism {{and imagery}} himself. Obscura's lyrics focus {{mainly on the}} {{writings}} of famous German philosophers. In describing these lyrics, Kummerer states:Cosmogenesis started {{with the beginning of}} our existence, the big bang theory <b>if</b> <b>you</b> want to <b>say</b> <b>so,</b> and deals with different layers and synonyms on a philosophical basis. The second, Omnivium, takes part of the evolution in many different layers such as the basic ape to human thought, religious topics, how the human individuals evolve within their existence and uses as its basic theme the novel On Nature’s Connection to the Spirit World by Friedrich Schelling.|$|R
