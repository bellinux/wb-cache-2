Affinity labeling with tritiated diisopropylfluorophosphate (3 H-DFP) suggested that ANCA-antigen is a serine protease. We used immunoelectron microscopy {{to study the}} in situ localization of the ANCA-antigen in normal human neutrophils and monocytes using immunoglobulin G (IgG) from ANCA-positive patients and a mouse monoclonal antibody against the ANCA-antigen. Label was observed on the large <b>granules</b> <b>of</b> the neutrophils and in <b>granules</b> <b>of</b> monocytes. Double-labeling, using anti-myeloperoxidase or the peroxidase reaction as markers for azurophil granules and anti-lactoferrin as marker for specific granules, showed that ANCA is colocalized with markers <b>of</b> azurophil <b>granules</b> but not with lactoferrin.

40|$|The {{effect of}} the {{ionophore}} A- 23187 was tested on isolated secretory <b>granules</b> <b>of</b> rat parotid gland. The ionophore caused extensive release of calcium from the granules without effecting release of amylase or other secretory proteins. It is therefore concluded {{that the role of}} calcium in the granules is probably not that of a stabilizing agent. KEY WORDS Ca++-ionophore 9 Ca ++ release secretory granule parotid gland 9 amylase release A high content of calcium was reported for the secretory <b>granules</b> <b>of</b> rat parotid gland (7, 17), for the submaxillary gland (5), for the membranes <b>of</b> zymogen <b>granules</b> <b>of</b> guinea pig pancreas (4), and for the chromaffin <b>granules</b> <b>of</b> the adrenal medulla (3). It has been suggested that calcium might serve to stabilize the highly concentrated protein in the secretory granules (17). In apparent support of this idea, it was found that slices and isolated secretory <b>granules</b> <b>of</b> rat parotid gland release amylase and calcium to the same relative extent (17). The ionophore A- 23187, which has recently come into use (12, 14), presented another approach to test whether or not release of calcium by the isolated, membrane-bounded granules can be dissociated from release of amylase. This ionophore, which is relatively specific for divalent cations, has been used to facilitate the movement of calcium through the membranes of various biological systems {{in order to determine the}} role of the metal (6, 8, 13, 15).
