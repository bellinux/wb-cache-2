5|$|The Doctor {{manages to}} contact UNIT to {{coordinate}} efforts {{of how to}} return the other passengers safely to Earth. The Doctor and Christina scout ahead, while the others attempt to repair the bus. The Doctor and Christina spot a sandstorm on the horizon when they are met by two Tritovores, a species resembling anthropomorphic flies, who take them to their wrecked spaceship. They explain they were delivering a shipment to San Helios, which had housed over hundred billion just recently but now is desert wherever they scan. The Doctor has them scan the approaching sandstorm and finds <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> swarm of stingray-like aliens that are destroying the ecosystem. He suspects they are generating the wormhole to travel to their next planet to feed upon, and they must hurry and close the wormhole before they can reach Earth. Christina uses her burglary skills to obtain a power crystal and its mounting from the Tritovore ship, but accidentally wakes an alien stingray, which consumes the Tritovores.|$|E

In his letters home to his wife, Rupert Edward Inglis (1863–1916), a former rugby international who was a Forces Chaplain, describes passing through the town of Albert: We went through the place today (2 October 1915) where the Virgin Statue {{at the top of}} the Church was hit by a shell in January. The statue was knocked over, but has never fallen, I sent you a picture of it. <b>It</b> <b>really</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> wonderful sight. It is incomprehensible how it can have stayed there, but I think it is now lower than when the photograph was taken, and no doubt will come down with the next gale. The Church and village are wrecked, there’s a huge hole made by a Jack Johnson just outside the west door of the Church.|$|E
500|$|What makes [...] "Ray Of Light" [...] one of Madonna's best singles is {{the fact}} that it is such a bitch to sing. Filled with {{multiple}} octave changes, it forced Madonna to push her vocal as far as it could possibly go. The song demanded she make use of her upper register and hold notes longer than she ever had before. <b>It</b> <b>really</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> techno gem that is always a standout at her concerts. After hearing a sample of it for the first time in the spring of 1998, I just knew that Madonna had outdone herself. The song brings the entire album of to a whole new level.|$|E

500|$|Author of the 1985 book Fresh: Hip Hop Don't Stop, writer Nelson George further {{elaborated}} on {{the appeal}} of Radio to listeners at the time, describing LL Cool J as a [...] "minimalist homeboy who knows his beats", and stating [...] "You can call it rap, hip hop or street, but <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> way of hearing music—and partying hard—that expresses the experiences and attitudes of a great many inner city kids. L.L. Cool J {{is one of the}} best young talkologists around, because he speaks directly to and about his generation over large beats that recall Run-D.M.C., Trouble Funk, James Brown, and funky little bits of AC/DC and Yes ... This teenage music is built around beats, but not just any old beats. It is all about a beat with style, with personality, and L.L. Cool J has plenty of both." ...|$|E
500|$|Free Collars Kingdom {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from English-speaking audiences. Matthew Alexander of Mania praised the artwork, noting that characters were [...] "cute and sexy {{with a wide}} variety of clothing that does a good job expressing the character's personality" [...] and that, overall, the artwork was [...] "very clean with attractive characters and well-detailed backgrounds". In his review of the second volume, Alexander wrote that [...] "so far, the story continues to be a fun examination of what life might be like from the cat's point of view, but I don't know how the whole Wild Cat storyline is going to be wrapped up in only one more volume". In his review of the third volume, Alexander felt that [...] "the story probably received an early ending", but concluded that [...] "despite the series only being three volumes, <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> worthy read and quite funny if you've ever owned a cat".|$|E
500|$|Three {{songs were}} played during the ending credits {{which were not}} {{included}} on the V for Vendetta soundtrack. The first was [...] "Street Fighting Man" [...] by the Rolling Stones. The second was a special version of Ethan Stoller's [...] "BKAB". In keeping with revolutionary tone of the film, excerpts from [...] "On Black Power" [...] (also in [...] "A Declaration of Independence") by black nationalist leader Malcolm X, and from [...] "Address to the Women of America" [...] by feminist writer Gloria Steinem {{were added to the}} song. Gloria Steinem can be heard saying: [...] "This is no simple reform... <b>It</b> <b>really</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> revolution. Sex and race, because they are easy and visible differences, have been the primary ways of organising human beings into superior and inferior groups and into the cheap labour on which this system still depends." [...] The final song was [...] "Out of Sight" [...] by Spiritualized.|$|E

During an Inside Soap feature on the Moon {{brothers}} vs the Mitchell brothers, Kate Woodward said [...] "Two sexy brothers to shake up Albert Square? That sounds familiar! But are Anthony and Tyler really the new Grant and Phil Mitchell?" [...] Lapinskas commented on this, saying [...] "It's {{a lot of pressure}} to put us both under, but what a duo to be compared to!... Phil and Grant were in the show together for at least 10years, and they were fantastic– so to be linked to them is phenomenal. <b>It</b> <b>really</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> lot to live up to, but Tony and I are hoping to come in with out own energy and bring something completely new to EastEnders. Rachel Tarley from the Metro said [...] "it's nice to have a bit of fresh blood in the soap, especially since the appearance of another one of his siblings always seems to leave Michael a little more demented than he was before. Lapinskas revealed to the Daily Mirror that because of his role in EastEnders, he is recognised in public, calling the experience [...] "surreal". Cecile Metcalf of the Daily Mail branded Anthony [...] "the loveable rogue of the square, with a cheeky answer for everything".|$|E

2500|$|In this map, European {{geographic}} knowledge, {{new to the}} Chinese, was {{combined with}} Chinese information unknown to Europeans to create the first map known to combine Chinese and European cartography. Among other things, this map revealed the existence of America to the Chinese. Ford W.

2500|$|If <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> single {{animal and}} not a chimera, Protoavis would raise {{interesting}} questions about when birds began to diverge from the dinosaurs, but until better evidence is produced, the animal's status currently remains uncertain. Furthermore, paleobiogeography suggests that true birds did not colonize the Americas until the Cretaceous; the most primitive lineages of unequivocal birds found to date are all Eurasian. Certainly, the fossils are most parsimoniously attributed to primitive dinosaurian and other reptiles as outlined above. However, coelurosaurs and ceratosaurs are in any case not too distantly related to the ancestors of birds and in {{some aspects of the}} skeleton not unlike them, explaining how their fossils could be mistaken as avian.

Biff Kritzen of Computer Gaming World gave the game a positive review, noting, [...] "as heavy-handed as the premise sounds, <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> rather light-hearted game." [...] The simple {{design and layout}} were praised, as were the game's colourful graphics. In a 1993 survey of pre 20th-century strategy games the magazine gave the game three stars out of five, calling it a [...] "quasi-arcade game, but with sustained play value". MegaTech magazine said the game had [...] "super graphics and 500 levels. Populous is both highly original and amazingly addictive, with a constant challenge on offer".|$|E

[...] "We don't have time to lose because extremists are trying to erase the identity, {{because they know that}} if there is no identity, there is no memory, there is no history", she said. Referring to the ancient cultures of Christians, Yazidis and other minorities, she said, [...] "This is a way to destroy identity. You deprive them of their culture, you deprive them of their history, their heritage, and that is why it {{goes hand in hand with}} genocide. Along with the physical persecution they want to eliminate – to delete – the memory of these different cultures ... we think this is appalling, and this is not acceptable." [...] Saad Eskander, head of Iraq's National Archives said, [...] "For the first time you have cultural cleansing... For the Yazidis, religion is oral, nothing is written.

2500|$|Ionesco, however, hated Sartre bitterly. Ionesco accused Sartre of {{supporting}} Communism but ignoring the atrocities committed by Communists; he wrote Rhinoceros as {{a criticism of}} blind conformity, whether it be to Nazism or Communism; {{at the end of}} the play, one man remains on Earth resisting transformation into a rhinoceros [...] Sartre criticized Rhinoceros by questioning: [...] "Why is there one man who resists? At least we could learn why, but no, we learn not even that. He resists because he is there". [...] Sartre's criticism highlights a primary difference between the Theatre of the Absurd and existentialism: the Theatre of the Absurd shows the failure of man without recommending a solution. In a 1966 interview, Claude Bonnefoy, comparing the Absurdists to Sartre and Camus, said to Ionesco, [...] "It seems to me that Beckett, Adamov and yourself started out less from philosophical reflections or a return to classical sources, than from first-hand experience and a desire to find a new theatrical expression that would enable you to render this experience in all its acuteness and also its immediacy. If Sartre and Camus thought out these themes, you expressed them in a far more vital contemporary fashion". Ionesco replied, [...] "I have the feeling that these writers – who are serious and important – were talking about absurdity and death, but that they never really lived these themes, that they did not feel them within themselves in an almost irrational, visceral way, that all this was not deeply inscribed in their language. With them it was still rhetoric, eloquence. With Adamov and Beckett <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> very naked reality that is conveyed through the apparent dislocation of language".|$|E
