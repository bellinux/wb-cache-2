5|$|Paul Baras of Brasier set {{the fastest}} lap {{of the race}} on his first lap. He {{held on to the}} lead until the third lap, when Szisz took over first position, {{defending}} it to the finish. <b>Hot</b> <b>conditions</b> melted the road tar, which the cars kicked up into the faces of the drivers, blinding them and making the racing treacherous. Punctures were common; tyre manufacturer Michelin introduced a detachable rim with a tyre already affixed, which could be quickly swapped onto a car after a puncture, saving a significant amount of time over manually replacing the tyre. This helped Nazzaro pass Clément on the second day, as the FIAT—unlike the Clément-Bayard—made use of the rims.|$|E
5|$|Under normal {{conditions}} about 75% {{of the eggs}} hatch. Hatching success can drop to about 35% in unusually <b>hot</b> <b>conditions.</b> Egg shell thinning, a potential cause of egg mortality, {{can be caused by}} pollutants. About 78% of chicks fledge in normal years, with that percentage only dropping slightly, to 77%, in abnormally hot years. Most egg and chick mortality during periods of normal climate is caused by nest fights between the parents and other birds. Breeding adults usually survive the year, with only about 18% dying every year. The young have a lower survival rate, with about 29% dying each year. The lifespan for this bird is anywhere from 16 to 30 years.|$|E
5|$|Queen Mary was {{the first}} ship to {{complete}} loading, and left Port Tewfik on 25 January. She anchored at Massawa three days later, and the soldiers on board endured very <b>hot</b> <b>conditions</b> until she resumed her journey. Aquitania was next to load, and embarked the entire 20th Brigade between 25 and 30 January. Île de France completed loading and departed Egypt on 28 January, and Nieuw Amsterdam and Queen of Bermuda sailed together on 1 February. Overall, 30,985 Australians were embarked on Queen of Bermuda and the converted liners; Aquitania carried 6,953, Île de France 6,531, Nieuw Amsterdam had 9,241 on board, 9,995 sailed on Queen Mary and 1,731 on Queen of Bermuda. A total of 622 AIF personnel remained in the Middle East after the five ships departed Egypt, but this figure was steadily reduced to below 20 by March 1943.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In this paper, we {{will discuss}} the need of {{non-linear}} material properties for performing modal analysis in <b>hot</b> <b>condition.</b> To stay competitive in the brisk rising automotive industry, automakers have to employ an integrated approach to use both simulation/modeling and hardware testing to reduce product development cost and time. Influence of temperature effects on exhaust hot end system are compared with linear and non-linear material properties for natural frequencies and mode shapes by performing modal analysis in <b>hot</b> <b>condition.</b> For these, temperature distribution are mapped from conjugate heat transfer results and then analyzed in finite element analysis with structural boundary <b>conditions</b> in <b>hot</b> <b>condition.</b> Modal analysis theory of exhaust system is discussed with appropriate explanations...|$|R

5|$|The 2007 season brought Zersenay his {{greatest}} medal haul, as he succeeded on grass, track and road. For {{the first time}} in his career he overcame all opposition, including five-time champion Kenenisa Bekele, to become the 2007 World Cross Country Champion. The <b>hot</b> <b>conditions</b> in Mombasa forced a number of runners out of the race, but Zersenay maintained his pace to finish over twenty seconds ahead of the next runner. At the Cáceres Half Marathon, he stated his intention to try for the world record and, although he won the race, poor pacing left him some distance from a record time. He returned to the Great Manchester Run and again improved his best, recording 27:24, but this was not enough to beat Micah Kogo who won in a UK all-comers record time. He competed at the Prefontaine Classic for the first time, and set a two miles best of 8:19.34, although he was some distance behind winner Craig Mottram.|$|E
5|$|The Second Test in Bombay was {{the only}} time that Lindwall was to captain Australia in a Test match. Captain Johnson and his deputy Miller were both injured, leaving the bowling depleted. Ron Archer was injured and {{unavailable}} as Australia bowled first in extremely <b>hot</b> <b>conditions.</b> The situation worsened throughout the match as pacemen Alan Davidson and Pat Crawford were hindered by stomach bugs and hip strains respectively during the game. Leg spinner Richie Benaud could not bowl for part of the match after being affected by a fever and left arm orthodox spinner John Wilson pulled a muscle midway through his debut. This left Lindwall and batting all rounder Ken Mackay as the only fully fit bowling options. Australia bowled out India for 251, before a strong batting effort led by Neil Harvey and Jim Burke, both of whom made centuries, saw Australia make 7/523. Lindwall contributed a hard-hitting unbeaten 48 at the end. Australia's depleted bowling told in the home side's second innings, as the visitors were only able to prise out five wickets and match ended in a draw, with Indian captain Polly Umrigar batting for six hours for a defiant 78. Lindwall finished the tour with scores of eight and 28 in the Third Test in Madras. In a low scoring match in which all four innings finished under 190, Lindwall took match figures of 3/41 in a 94 run victory. It was a successful series for Lindwall, taking 12 wickets at 16.58 and scoring 92 runs at 30.66.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the thermoregulatory and physiological responses of Najdi rams raised under <b>hot</b> summer <b>conditions</b> prevailing in Kingdom Saudi Arabia. The core temperature (Tcore) showed circadian rhythm characterized by biphasic achrophases, which were associated with the feeding times during both seasons. Average daily Tcore was significantly (P< 0. 05) higher under <b>hot</b> summer <b>conditions.</b> However, the amplitudes of the rhythmic oscillation during winter and summer seasons were 0. 85 and 0. 56 C, respectively. Rectal (Tre) and skin temperatures (Tsk) were significantly (P< 0. 05) higher under <b>hot</b> summer <b>conditions</b> and exhibited similar patterns during both seasons concurrent with the pattern of temperature humidity index (THI), reaching the maximum values late in the afternoon and the minimum values early in the morning. Respiratory rate (RR) and heart rate (HR) showed the same pattern of the thermal parameters and were significantly (P< 0. 05) higher under <b>hot</b> summer <b>conditions.</b> Serum concentrations of total protein, globulin, glucose, sodium and chloride were significantly (P< 0. 05) increased while those of albumin and calcium were decreased under <b>hot</b> summer <b>conditions.</b> The results obtained from this study indicate that <b>hot</b> summer <b>conditions</b> of Saudi Arabia is thermally stressful to Najdi rams.

25|$|Experience of Vampire {{operation}} in tropical climates {{led to the}} development of new models featuring refrigeration equipment for pilot comfort and increasingly powerful models of the Goblin engine, to counter the degradation of performance in <b>hot</b> <b>conditions.</b> The RAF decided to adopt a new model of the Vampire featuring the Goblin 3 engine. Accordingly, in January 1952, the first Vampire FB.9 was introduced to service and were first used by the Far East Air Force, soon replacing its older FB.5 aircraft. The FB.9 was deployed to various parts of the Middle East and Africa. In use against Mau Mau insurgents in Kenya, from 1954, it was gradually replaced by the de Havilland Venom, a swept wing development of the Vampire.|$|E

25|$|The next part in Guth's path {{came when}} he heard a lecture by Steven Weinberg in early 1979. Weinberg talked in two lectures about the Grand Unified Theory (GUT) that had been {{developed}} since 1974, and how it could explain the huge amount of matter in the universe compared to the amount of antimatter. The GUT explained all the fundamental forces known in science except for gravity. It established that in very <b>hot</b> <b>conditions,</b> such as those after the Big Bang, electromagnetism, the strong nuclear force, and the weak nuclear force were united to form one force. Weinberg also was the one who emphasized the idea that the universe goes through phase transitions, similar to the phases of matter, when going from high energy to low energy. Weinberg’s discussion of why matter is so dominant over anti-matter showed Guth how precise calculations about particles could be obtained by studying the first few seconds of the universe.|$|E
