25|$|Geotechnical {{investigations}} are performed by geotechnical engineers or engineering geologists {{to obtain information}} on the physical properties of soil and rock around a site to design earthworks and foundations for proposed structures and for repair of distress to earthworks and structures caused by subsurface conditions. This type of investigation is called a site investigation. Additionally, geotechnical {{investigations are}} also {{used to measure the}} thermal resistivity of soils or backfill materials required for underground transmission lines, oil and gas pipelines, radioactive waste disposal, and solar thermal storage facilities. A <b>geotechnical</b> <b>investigation</b> will include surface exploration and subsurface exploration of a site. Sometimes, geophysical methods are used to obtain data about sites. Subsurface exploration usually involves soil sampling and laboratory tests of the soil samples retrieved.|$|E

Ewbank Preece OhEocha, in association with Symonds Travers Morgan, produced a conceptual design and tender documents for Cork Corporation on a design and construct format based on geometric and performance specification. Thirteen parties showed interest in the contract. From these, four consortia were selected and Cork Corporation made a final contract decision in December 1994. As is typical on a large-scale project of this type, the chosen contractor was a joint venture of Tarmac Walls JV, formed by Tarmac Construction, now a division of Carillion, and P.J. Walls (Civil) Ltd., part of Ireland's Walls Group. Subcontractors then handled many of the key tasks of construction.|$|E

2500|$|When {{building}} {{on top of}} bay mud layers or when dredging estuary bottoms, a variety of regulatory frameworks may arise. Normally in the United States, an Environmental Impact Report {{as well as a}} <b>geotechnical</b> <b>investigation</b> are conducted precedent to any major construction over bay mud. [...] Combined, these reports have developed much of the data base extant on bay mud characteristics, frequently yielding original field data from soil borings. [...] These data have demonstrated that in many locations the shallower bay muds contain concentrations of mercury, lead, chromium, petroleum hydrocarbons, PCBs, pesticides and other chemicals which exceed toxic limits: a geological record of human activities of the last century. [...] These data are particularly important to consider when dredging of bay muds is contemplated as part of a development project. Such dredging can have impacts to receiving lands as soil contamination, but also water column impacts from sediment disturbance.|$|E

40|$|AbstractDuring {{the last}} decade, {{due to the}} {{increasing}} need for commercial spaces {{with access to the}} subway, tall buildings were constructed in the north of Bucharest. These buildings transmit high loads on the foundation ground and require foundation systems that ca ensure low-grade settlements, while the influence on the surrounding area is minimized. To achieve this with a sustainable economic and low environmental impact, common <b>geotechnical</b> <b>investigations</b> and advanced ones need to be corroborated in order to provide reliable input data for an accurate FEM analysis. This paper presents some correlations between Cone Penetration Tests (CPT) and Flat Dilatometer Marchetti Tests equipped with seismic module (SDMT) with common laboratory <b>geotechnical</b> <b>investigations.</b> It is aimed to achieve {{a better understanding of the}} obtained geotechnical parameters and the correlations between them, justifying the investigation effort and enabling reliable input data for advanced FEM analysis...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{determination}} {{of the influence of}} mining works and the induced seismicity is essentially obtained, separately from in-situ observations and seismic analysis, field measurements (particularly surface survey) as well as from numerical investigations. The paper presents a methodology applied for the analysis of induced seismicity due to underground coalmines based on combining numerical modelling and seismic analysis. The methodology is based on the comparing between the observations, the seismic activity and the numerical modelling for establishing a close correlation between the location of seismic activity and the induced stresses. The paper presents two case studies using seismic and <b>geotechnical</b> <b>investigations,</b> the first one concerns a fatal accident affected Lorraine coalmine (East France). The second case concerns the application of the methodology on Provence coalmines (South France). The application of the methodology shows such a coupling can be an efficient way for detecting areas subjected to rockburst hazard. This is also a powerful tool for assisting the planning of underground workings in complex geological and mining conditions.
