50|$|HD Encodulators are a {{new class}} of device in <b>Digital</b> <b>Video</b> <b>Broadcast</b> (<b>DVB).</b> Encodulators are devices that bundle a digital encoder and an RF agile {{modulator}} into one package. Encodulators accept uncompressed video as either HD or SD and encode the source to an MPEG transport stream. This transport stream can be based on either MPEG-2 or MPEG-4(H.264) broadcasting codecs. Once the video is encoded it is passed on to the modulator component of the device. The agile modulator overlays the MPEG transport stream onto a high frequency carrier wave for DTV broadcast. In the US this is typically in the 50 - 900 MHz range for terrestrial television, and 900 - 2600 MHz for satellite distribution. Standards used for terrestrial broadcast are 8-level Vestigial Sideband Modulation (8VSB) for over the air, and Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) for cable TV. A typical example of an encodulator are the units from Thor Broadcast. These units include both a high definition encoder and a frequency agile modulator for all major DVB modulation types. Many more manufacturers are moving to this sort of consolidated hardware platform. In the last year other manufacturers such as Comlan have released similar units. In the future we will see more and more broadcasting companies moving to consolidated equipment, both to save on rackspace and on cost.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, a novel cross-layer {{framework}} for opti-mizing the {{dynamic bandwidth allocation}} (DBA) of a <b>digital</b> <b>video</b> <b>broadcast</b> (<b>DVB)</b> -return channel satellite (RCS) system using adaptive coding is proposed. The design of the medium access control (MAC) methods {{taking into account the}} adaptive physical layer and higher layers ’ quality of service (QoS) requirements is cast as an optimization problem by using the network utility maximization (NUM) framework applied within the satellite subnetwork. Hierarchical and global solving procedures fully compliant with the DVB-RCS standard are proposed. They do not only provide minimum bandwidth guarantees but also maximize fairness. Further, they allow a joint optimization of the time slot size and overall system efficiency while minimizing signalling overhead. A reduced computational complexity algorithm to solve the DBA problem is presented. In practical terms, it increases the number of connections with absolute and relative QoS require-ments the system can manage and facilitates the interoperability of the satellite network within an Internet protocol (IP) environment.
