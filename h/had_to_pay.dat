5|$|In November 1815, Louis XVIII's {{government}} had to sign another Treaty of Paris that formally ended Napoleon's Hundred Days. The previous treaty had been quite favourable to France, but this one took a hard line. France's borders were retracted to their extent at 1790. France <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for an army to occupy her, {{for at least five}} years, at a cost of 150million francs per year.

5|$|Stone {{wanted to}} {{recreate}} the Kennedy assassination in Dealey Plaza. His producers <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> the Dallas City Council {{a substantial amount of}} money to hire police to reroute traffic and close streets for three weeks. He only had ten days to shoot all of the footage he needed and so he used seven cameras (two 35mm and five 16mm) and 14 film stocks. Getting permission to shoot in the Texas School Book Depository was more difficult. They <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> $50,000 to put someone in the window from which Oswald was supposed to have shot Kennedy. They were allowed to film in that location only between certain hours with only five people on the floor at one time: the camera crew, an actor and Stone. Co-producer Clayton Townsend has said that the hardest part was getting the permission to restore the building to the way it looked back in 1963. It took five months of negotiation.|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} effectively illegalised the ROIA {{and led to}} {{the immediate}} release of O'Brien and the other detained individuals, who sued the British Government for false imprisonment.

Taylor immediately regretted the decision. The Giants, who were eager to keep Taylor, took part in negotiating his way out of it.
