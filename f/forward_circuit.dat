40|$|ABSTRACT-The {{single-stage}} converters (SSC’s) with power-factor-correction (PFC) {{feature is}} {{implemented in the}} wind generator is presented in this paper. The wind induction generator(IG) feeding an isolated load through the PWM controller with the power factor correction circuit. In this circuit, the power factor is improved by using an auxiliary winding coupled to the transformer of a cascade dc/dc flyback converter. The topology of this converter is derived by combining a boost circuit and a <b>forward</b> <b>circuit</b> in one power stage. To improve {{the performance of the}} ac–dc converter (i. e., good powerfactor correction, low total harmonic distortion (THD) and low dc bus voltage), two bulk storage capacitors are adopted. The output voltage and frequency of the wind generator can be varied according to random fluctuation of wind-speed variation.

Stack machines can omit the operand fetching stage of a register machine. In addition, except explicit load from memory instructions, the order of operand usage is identical with {{the order of the}} operands in the data stack. So excellent prefetching is accomplished easily by keeping operands on the top of stack in fast storage.

40|$|Due to its {{fast charge}} and {{discharge}} rate, a supercapacitor-based {{energy storage system}} is especially suitable for power smoothing in renewable energy generation applications. Voltage equalization is essential for series-connected supercapacitors in an energy storage system, because it supports the system’s sustainability and maximizes the available cell energy. In this paper, we present a high-efficiency voltage equalization scheme for supercapacitor energy storage systems in renewable generation applications. We propose an improved isolated converter topology that uses a multi-winding transformer. An improved push-pull <b>forward</b> <b>circuit</b> is applied on the primary side of the transformer. A coupling inductor is added on the primary side to allow the switches to operate under the zero-voltage switching (ZVS) condition, which reduces switching losses. The diodes in the rectifier are replaced with metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) to reduce the power dissipation of the secondary side. In order to simplify the control, we designed a controllable rectifying circuit to achieve synchronous rectifying on the secondary side of the transformer.

40|$|The high {{demands on}} data {{processing}} and bandwidth in wireless/wireline communication and aerospace {{systems have been}} pushing <b>forward</b> <b>circuit</b> design techniques to their limitations to obtain maximum performances with respect to high operating frequency, low noise, small area, and low power consumption. Clock generators are essential components in numerous circuits, for instance, frequency synthesizers for high speed transceivers, clock sources for microprocessors, noise suppressed zero-delay buffers in system-on-chips (SOCs), and clock and data recovery (CDR) systems. Furthermore, clock generators are required to provide low jitter and high precision clocks in fully integrated image reject receivers and an ultra-wide tunability in time-interleaved applications. We explore several circuit design techniques and implementations of low jitter clock generator in this thesis. Firstly, a low jitter and wide range digital phase-locked loop (DPLL) operating 8 ~ 16 GHz is illustrated using a dual path digital loop filter (DLF). In order to mitigate the phase jitter in the phase detector (PD), we implement the separate loop filter and the output is not affected by the proportional path. For the stable operation, a 4 ~ 8 GHz linear phase interpolator (PI) is implemented in the proportional path. In addition, we design a low phase noise digitally controlled oscillator (DCO) using inductive tuning technique based on switched mutual coupling for wide operating range. The proposed DPLL implemented in 65 nm CMOS technology shows an outstanding figure-of-merit (FOM) over other state-of-art DPLLs in term of root mean square (RMS) and deterministic jitter (DJ). Secondly, we discuss a radiation-hardened-by-design (RHBD) PLL using a feedback voltage-controlled oscillator (FBVCO) {{in order to reduce}} DJ due to the radiation attack on the control voltage. Different from a conventional open loop VCO, the proposed FBVCO has a negative control loop and is composed of an open loop VCO, an integrator and a switched-capacitor resistor. Since the input to output of the FBVCO has a low-pass characteristic, any disturbance on the control voltage should be filtered and cannot affect the output phase. We are able to reduce the output frequency variation approximately 75 % compared to the conventional PLL when the radiation pulse strikes on the control voltage. The proposed RHBD PLL is implemented in 130 nm and consumes 6. 2 mW at 400 MHz operating frequency. Thirdly, a novel adaptive-bandwidth PLL is illustrated to optimize the jitter performance in a wide operating frequency range. We achieve a constant ratio of bandwidth and reference frequency with a closed loop VCO and an overdamping system with a charge pump (CP) current proportional to the VCO frequency for the adaptive-bandwidth technique. The proposed adaptive-bandwidth PLL presents 0. 6 % RMS jitter over the entire frequency range from 320 MHz to 2. 56 GHz, which is 70 % smaller than the conventional fixed-bandwidth PLL. Finally, we have developed a new feedback DCO to achieve a linear gain of DCO so that the DPLL can provide stability and a wide operating range in different process variations. Due to the negative feedback loop of the proposed DCO, the feedback DCO presents a linear gain from an input digital word to an output frequency. Moreover, we can control the bandwidth of the feedback DCO to optimize the total output phase noise in DPLL. In simulation, we can obtain 17 MHz/LSB of the peak-to-peak gain of the feedback DCO, which is reduced 96 % over the conventional DCO...|$|E
50|$|Fast {{access is}} also useful for interpreters. Most {{register}} interpreters specify their registers by number. But a host machine's registers can't be accessed in an indexed array, so a memory array is allotted for virtual registers. Therefore, the instructions of a register interpreter must use memory for passing generated {{data to the}} next instruction. This forces register interpreters to be much slower on microprocessors made with a fine process rule (i.e. faster transistors without improving circuit speeds, such as the Haswell x86). These require several clocks for memory access, but only one clock for register access. In {{the case of a}} stack machine with a data <b>forwarding</b> <b>circuit</b> instead of a register file, stack interpreters can allot the host machine's registers for the top several operands of the stack instead of the host machine's memory.|$|R
