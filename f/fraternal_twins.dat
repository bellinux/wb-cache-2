5|$|Pauline Fowler {{is one of}} the {{original}} twenty-three characters invented by the creators of EastEnders, Tony Holland (1940–2007) and Julia Smith (1927–1997). Holland had drawn on his own London background for inspiration, naming three of {{the original}} characters after his own relatives, specifically his aunt Lou and her children, Holland's cousins, the <b>fraternal</b> <b>twins</b> Pete and Pauline. This family setup of a woman named Lou Beale, with twin children Pete and Pauline, was recreated on-screen as the first family of EastEnders, the Beales and Fowlers.|$|E
5|$|Chapters on {{methodology}} {{comprise a}} third of the book's core. Identical and <b>fraternal</b> <b>twins</b> were classified using fingerprints and blood groups. Follow-up interviews were recorded to monitor the progress of their patients (the probands) and their twins, some schizophrenic and others not. Two psychological teststhe MMPI and the Object Sorting Test (Goldstein Scheerer Test of Concept Formation)were used to measure mental traits and functioning. Case summaries were prepared by the Scandinavian psychiatrist Erick Essen-Moller, and these were sent, with data on identical-or-fraternal-twin status and diagnosis-of-schizophrenia removed, to six judges from the U.S., U.K. and Japan. The judges independently evaluated whether the patients were schizophrenic.|$|E

5|$|Gottesman and Shields {{published}} Schizophrenia and Genetics {{to document}} their twin-study {{research at the}} Maudsley Hospital in London, the work that in part earned them the Hofheimer Prize for Research, the highest award for psychiatric research from the American Psychiatric Association. The study expanded on an earlier one by Eliot Slater at the same hospital, covering 24 identical and 33 <b>fraternal</b> <b>twins,</b> {{with at least one}} from every pair a schizophrenic being treated at the hospital between 1948 and 1964. This study was one of eleven such in the contemporary literature, and the book detailed the methodology and analytic detail differentiating it from the others.|$|E
5|$|Gottesman did his {{graduate}} {{work at the}} University of Minnesota, which then patterned its clinical psychology program on the Boulder model, which emphasized research theory and clinical practice. He joined the graduate program in 1956 after three years with the Navy, supported by the Korean War G.I. Bill. He began investigating personality traits in identical and <b>fraternal</b> <b>twins</b> who had filled out the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI). His Ph.D. thesis, submitted to Psychological Monographs, was rejected before a review {{on the grounds that}} the nature–nurture issue it addressed had already been settled in favor of nurture. On appeal, the thesis was reviewed and accepted for publication.|$|E
5|$|Results {{of studies}} {{comprise}} another {{third of the}} core of Schizophrenia and Genetics. The data showed that genes made a person likely to develop schizophrenia under environmental pressures. The study was not designed to find the genes responsible, but the authors hypothesized there would be several acting in tandem.Contextual elements responsible could not be identified, though some, such as an overly protective mother, birth order, natal weight, and social and economic elements were ruled out. Gottesman and Shields found roughly half of identical twins had a shared schizophrenic or non-schizophrenic status, but only one-eleventh of <b>fraternal</b> <b>twins</b> had such a shared diagnosis. MMPI scales coincided among identical twin pairs but not among fraternal twin pairs. The Object Sorting Test showed no useful relations. Those meeker than their twins were more liable to develop schizophrenia where their genes already put them at risk.|$|E

5|$|Gottesman {{began his}} career at Harvard University as a social {{relations}} and psychology lecturer. This non-tenure-track position ended after three years. Then he worked with researcher James Shields at the Maudsley–Bethlem hospital complex in London, using its twin registry to analyze traits of identical and <b>fraternal</b> <b>twins</b> at the lab of Eliot Slater, whom Gottesman met in Rome at the Second International Congress on Human Genetics in 1961. After {{his return to the}} University of Minnesota in 1966, Gottesman created a program on behavioral genetics, the first in the U.S. In 1972–1973 he received a Guggenheim fellowship to work with K.O. Christiansen in Denmark. In 1980 he left to join the Washington University School of Medicine, then moved to the University of Virginia in 1985, where he started the clinical psychology training program. Gottesman continued vising London and collaborating with Shields, with whom he co-wrote a series of books.After spending 16 years at the University of Virginia, Gottesman retired from an active role after 41 years of research, but continues research part-time in psychology and psychiatry.|$|E
25|$|Women {{who have}} a family history of <b>fraternal</b> <b>twins</b> have a higher chance of {{producing}} <b>fraternal</b> <b>twins</b> themselves, as there is a genetically linked tendency to hyper-ovulate. There is no known genetic link for identical twinning. Other factors that increase the odds of having <b>fraternal</b> <b>twins</b> include maternal age, fertility drugs and other fertility treatments, nutrition, and prior births.|$|E
25|$|This is {{particularly}} true for the marmoset. Recent research shows most marmosets are chimeras, sharing DNA with their <b>fraternal</b> <b>twins.</b> 95% of marmoset <b>fraternal</b> <b>twins</b> trade blood through chorionic fusions, making them hematopoietic chimeras.|$|E

25|$|In a {{study using}} {{identical}} and <b>fraternal</b> <b>twins,</b> {{results indicated that}} there is a stronger likelihood of identical twins both having depression than <b>fraternal</b> <b>twins.</b> This provides support for the idea that dysthymia is in part caused by heredity.|$|E
25|$|The {{classical}} twin design {{compares the}} similarity of monozygotic (identical) and dizygotic (<b>fraternal)</b> <b>twins.</b> If identical twins are considerably more similar than <b>fraternal</b> <b>twins</b> (which is found for most traits), this implicates that genes {{play an important role}} in these traits. By comparing many hundreds of families with twins, researchers can then understand more about the roles of genetic effects, shared environment, and unique environment in shaping behavior.|$|E
25|$|The basic or {{classical}} twin-design {{contains only}} identical and <b>fraternal</b> <b>twins</b> raised in their biological family.

25|$|In Greek mythology, <b>fraternal</b> <b>twins</b> Castor and Polydeuces, and Heracles and Iphicles, are sons of two {{different}} fathers. One of the twins (Polydeuces, Heracles) is the illegitimate son of the god Zeus; his brother {{is the son of}} their mother's mortal husband. A similar pair of twin sisters are Helen (of Troy) and Clytemnestra (who are also sisters of Castor and Polydeuces). The theme occurs in other mythologies as well, and is called superfecundation.|$|E
25|$|At least 40women {{have come}} forward to say their Baby Gender Mentor tests {{predicted}} the wrong sex. According to a National Public Radio (NPR) report, the company has explained certain inaccurate results as being {{the result of a}} vanishing twin, a fetus that stopped growing soon after fertilization. Acu-Gen claimed that their kit could predict a mixed sex set of <b>fraternal</b> <b>twins,</b> so the test should have predicted twins instead of predicting a single baby whose sex turned out to be incorrect.|$|E
25|$|Among dizygotic twins, in rare cases, {{the eggs}} are fertilized at {{different}} times with two or more acts of sexual intercourse, either within one menstrual cycle (superfecundation) or, even more rarely, {{later on in the}} pregnancy (superfetation). This can lead to the possibility of a woman carrying <b>fraternal</b> <b>twins</b> with different fathers (that is, half-siblings). This phenomenon is known as heteropaternal superfecundation. One 1992 study estimates that the frequency of heteropaternal superfecundation among dizygotic twins, whose parents were involved in paternity suits, was approximately 2.4%; see the references section, below, for more details.|$|E
