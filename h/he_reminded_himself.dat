2500|$|He {{preferred}} {{being an}} adviser and counselor, {{rather than simply}} a strategist in lawsuits, which {{would allow him to}} advise his clients on how to avoid problems, such as lawsuits, strikes, or other crises. Brandeis explained: [...] "I would rather have clients than be somebody's lawyer." [...] In a note found among his papers, <b>he</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>himself</b> to [...] "advise client on what he should have, not what he wants." ...|$|E

60|$|With this comforting thought, {{he started}} on his perilous {{journey to the}} open air. As he walked delicately, not courting observation, <b>he</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>himself</b> of the hero of 'Pilgrim's Progress'. On all sides of him lay fearsome beasts, lying in wait to pounce upon him. At any moment Mr Gregory's hoarse roar might shatter the {{comparative}} stillness, or the sinister note of Mr Bickersdyke make itself heard.|$|E

5000|$|..... As {{for others}} {{whose lives are}} not so ordered, <b>he</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>himself</b> {{constantly}} of the characters they exhibit daily and nightly at home and abroad, and {{of the sort of}} society they frequent; and the approval of such men, who do not even stand well in their own eyes has no value for him.

40|$|In the Changamoto world, Droids {{battle against}} hostile Aliens, slowly {{discovering}} which types {{can be easily}} beaten and which require more experience. The Droids are being controlled by Jeffrey, {{one of the thousands}} of Dutch youngsters that receive therapy for cannabis addiction. While Jeffrey trains his Droids and learns to strategically stage them against the right Aliens, <b>he</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>himself</b> to register his triggers for cannabis use in a diary...|$|R
60|$|Charmed at {{the ease}} with which he had {{demolished}} the objections of Mr. Adolphus Swann and won that suffering gentleman over to his plans, Hardy began to cast longing glances at Equator Lodge. <b>He</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>himself</b> that the labourer was worthy of his hire, and it seemed moreover an extremely desirable thing that Captain Nugent should know that he was labouring in his vineyard with the full expectation of a bounteous harvest. He resolved to call.|$|E
60|$|The {{protective}} instinct {{in the man}} {{was suddenly}} strong. Naturally unaffectionate, he was conscious of an almost overmastering desire to take her hands in his, even to lift her up and kiss away the tears which shone in her deep, childlike eyes. <b>He</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>himself</b> {{that she was a}} stranger, that her appearance of youth was a delusion, that she could only construe such an action as a liberty, an impertinence, offered under circumstances for which there could be no possible excuse.|$|E
60|$|It was {{necessary}} now that Sir Lionel should summon up his best courage. <b>He</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>himself</b> {{that after all}} his brother was but a feeble old man--impotent in all but money; and as it seemed now clear that no further pecuniary aid was to be expected, why need he fear him on this account? Had it been {{possible for him to}} get away without further talk, he would have done so; but this was not possible, so he determined to put a good face on it.|$|E
50|$|Gradually, {{the protagonist}} begins {{to realize that}} he is living out a {{perpetual}} dream, broken up only by occasional false awakenings. So far he is mostly a passive onlooker, though this changes during a chat with a passing woman who suddenly approaches him. After she greets him and shares her creative ideas with him, <b>he</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>himself</b> that she is a figment of his own dreaming imagination. Afterwards, he starts to converse more openly with other dream characters, but he begins to despair about being trapped in a dream.|$|R
50|$|Zeitgeist {{views the}} footage of {{missions}} the team goes on, ostensibly to study tactics. The supermodels he lounges with {{believe it is}} for more 'exciting' purposes. His thoughts are revealed as he studies one mission involving battling mutinous North African tribesmen. He does make mental notes on each team member. Notably, <b>he</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>himself</b> how Plazm's kill rate is not acceptable, how U-Go Girl needs to stabilize herself and how Sluk's death is not that bad, as {{he did not look}} as human {{as the rest of the}} crew.|$|R
2500|$|Once alerted by Edwin Bollier of Mebo to the MegrahiFhimah {{friendship}} and business relationship, Scottish police obtained permission to search Fhimah's office in Malta.

60|$|She smiled again, turned, {{and walked}} away, leaving George to reckon {{up all the}} social solecisms he had {{contrived}} to commit {{in the space of}} a single moment. He had remained seated, <b>he</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>himself,</b> throughout the interview; one. He had not raised his hat, that fascinating Homburg simply made to be raised with a debonair swish under such conditions; two. Call it three, because he ought to have raised it twice. He had gaped like a fool; four. And, five, he had not uttered a single word of acknowledgement in reply to her thanks.|$|E
60|$|It {{should be}} said on his behalf that he {{attributed}} to himself no preponderance of excellence, either on the score of his money or his rank. He was able so to honour the girl as {{to think of her}} that such things would go for nothing with her. It was not that he had put his coronet at her feet, but his heart. It was of that he thought when <b>he</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>himself</b> of all that he had done for her, and told himself angrily that she should not have tormented him. He was as arrogant and impatient of disappointment as any young lord of them all,--but it was not, however, because he was a lord that he thought that Marion's heart was due to him.|$|E
60|$|The {{rational}} {{part of him}} (whether {{the wiser}} or not) regained its supremacy. He remembered that the proprietor {{had told him that}} he should lock the door, and would come later to release him. He told himself that twenty things he had not thought of might explain the eccentric sounds outside; <b>he</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>himself</b> that there was just enough light left to finish his own proper work. Bringing his paper to the window so as to catch the last stormy evening light, he resolutely plunged once more into the almost completed record. He had written for about twenty minutes, bending closer and closer to his paper in the lessening light; then suddenly he sat upright. He had heard the strange feet once more.|$|E

60|$|Longueville stared; {{there was}} an unexpectedness in the speech and an incongruity in Mrs. Vivian's {{beginning}} to flatter him. <b>He</b> needed to <b>remind</b> <b>himself</b> that {{if she was a}} Bostonian, she was a Bostonian perverted.|$|R
60|$|His visitor {{had lost}} {{none of his}} embarrassment. The Marquis, in his old-fashioned dinner clothes, his black stock, the fob which hung from his waistcoat, his finely chiselled features, and that mysterious air of being entirely {{in touch with his}} surroundings, had him at a {{disadvantage}} from the first. Borden was wearing the somewhat shabby blue serge suit in which he had travelled all day, and which he had neglected to brush. He had been too much in earnest about his mission to do more than make the most hasty toilet at the hotel. The high-backed chair, which suited the Marquis so well, was an unfamiliar article of furniture to him, and he sat upon it stiffly and without ease. Nevertheless, <b>he</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>himself</b> that he was there--he must say what he had come to say.|$|E
60|$|The {{child could}} not think {{what she was talking}} about, but he quite {{understood}} the soup, which tasted most delicious. His mother had often given him nice things, but nothing had ever seemed so good as this. The smell of the herbs and spices rose from the bowl, and the soup tasted both sweet and sharp at the same time, and was very strong. As he was finishing it the guinea pigs lit some Arabian incense, which gradually filled the room with clouds of blue vapour. They grew thicker and thicker and the scent nearly overpowered the boy. <b>He</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>himself</b> that he must get back to his mother, but whenever he tried to rouse himself to go he sank back again drowsily, and at last he fell sound asleep {{in the corner of the}} sofa.|$|E
60|$|The mysterious positiveness of this {{assertion}} startled Razumov. Their eyes met. He looked away and, {{through the bars}} of the rusty gate, stared at the clean, wide road shaded by the leafy trees. An electric tramcar, quite empty, ran along the avenue with a metallic rustle. It seemed to him he would have given anything to be sitting inside all alone. He was inexpressibly weary, weary in every fibre of his body, but he had a reason for not being the first to break off the conversation. At any instant, in the visionary and criminal babble of revolutionists, some momentous words might fall on his ear; from her lips, from anybody's lips. As long as he managed to preserve a clear mind and to keep down his irritability there was nothing to fear. The only condition of success and safety was indomitable will-power, <b>he</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>himself.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The song {{opens with}} the narrator listing various small things that annoy him, {{such as his}} job and the weather; however, <b>he</b> then <b>reminds</b> <b>himself,</b> [...] "But I know I'm a lucky man / God's given me a pretty fair hand", and turns to recounting all of the luxuries in his life, from his family to his health to his truck to his new fishing rod.|$|R
50|$|To Sei-hoi (Sunny Chan) is the adopted {{son of an}} executioner. After his foster father's death, {{he carries}} his golden executioner blade with him {{wherever}} <b>he</b> goes to <b>remind</b> <b>himself</b> of his identity. He befriends Shui Yu-chan, a doctor, and the two become sworn brothers.|$|R
60|$|When one stands {{where the}} Saviour was crucified, {{he finds it}} all he {{can do to keep}} it {{strictly}} before his mind that Christ was not crucified in a Catholic Church. <b>He</b> must <b>remind</b> <b>himself</b> every now and then that the great event transpired in the open air, and not in a gloomy, candle-lighted cell in a little corner of a vast church, up-stairs --a small cell all bejeweled and bespangled with flashy ornamentation, in execrable taste.|$|R
60|$|Then {{came across}} his brow that look which had {{probably}} first induced Marie {{to declare that}} she would endure to be 'cut to pieces,' rather than to yield in this or that direction. The lower jaw squared itself and the teeth became set, and the nostrils of his nose became extended,--and Marie began to prepare herself to be 'cut to pieces.' But <b>he</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>himself</b> {{that there was another}} game which he had proposed to play before he resorted to anger and violence. He would tell her how much depended on her compliance. Therefore he relaxed the frown,--as well as he knew how, and softened his face towards her, and turned again to his work. 'I am sure, Marie, that you will not refuse to do this when I explain to you its importance to me. I must have that property for use in the city to-morrow, or--I shall be ruined.' The statement was very short, but the manner in which he made it was not without effect.|$|E
6000|$|Ensconced {{once more}} in a hansom, he {{proceeded}} to reconsider his position. Suppose (he thought), suppose he should accept defeat and declare his uncle's death at once? He should lose the tontine, and with that the last hope of his seven thousand eight hundred pounds. But on the other hand, since the shilling to the hansom cabman, {{he had begun to}} see that crime was expensive in its course, and, since the loss of the water-butt, that it was uncertain in its consequences. Quietly at first, and then with growing heat, he reviewed the advantages of backing out. It involved a loss; but (come to think of it) no such great loss after all; only that of the tontine, which had been always a toss-up, which at bottom he had never really expected. <b>He</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>himself</b> of that eagerly; he congratulated himself upon his constant moderation. He had never really expected the tontine; he had never even very definitely hoped to recover his seven thousand eight hundred pounds; he had been hurried into the whole thing by Michael's obvious dishonesty. Yes, it would probably be better to draw back from this high-flying venture, settle back on the leather business---- ...|$|E
60|$|He {{glanced around}} the table. Opposite him was Arthur, and Arthur's brother, Norman. They were her brothers, <b>he</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>himself,</b> and his heart warmed toward them. How they loved each other, {{the members of this}} family! There flashed into his mind the picture of her mother, of the kiss of greeting, and of the pair of them walking toward him with arms entwined. Not in his world were such {{displays}} of affection between parents and children made. It was a revelation of the heights of existence that were attained in the world above. It was the finest thing yet that he had seen in this small glimpse of that world. He was moved deeply by appreciation of it, and his heart was melting with sympathetic tenderness. He had starved for love all his life. His nature craved love. It was an organic demand of his being. Yet he had gone without, and hardened himself in the process. He had not known that he needed love. Nor did he know it now. He merely saw it in operation, and thrilled to it, and thought it fine, and high, and splendid.|$|E
5000|$|Several {{speakers}} {{stressed that}} future generations need protection as well. Nina Turner's speech drew boisterous {{approval from the}} attendees. She said, [...] "You've got to walk the walk...you have to care more about the next generation than the next election.” Mike Sylvester, a union organizer for 20 years who ran a successful campaign as a socialist for the Maine House of Representatives in 2016, said that as he went door-to-door campaigning for long hours, <b>he</b> would <b>remind</b> <b>himself</b> that <b>he</b> was running for office {{for the future of}} his children.|$|R
60|$|Perhaps {{the matter}} most {{remarkable}} in {{the wedding was}} the hilarity of the Duke. One {{who did not know}} him well might have said that he was a man with few cares, and who now took special joy in the happiness of his children,--who was thoroughly contented to see them marry after their own hearts. And yet, as he stood there on the altar-steps giving his daughter to that new son and looking first at his girl, and then at his married son, <b>he</b> was <b>reminding</b> <b>himself</b> of all that he had suffered.|$|R
60|$|For {{the sake}} of his neighbours: for to hear each other's voices stirs up earnestness, stirs up attention, keeps off laziness, inattention, and by a {{wholesome}} infection, makes all the congregation of one mind, as they are of one speech, in glorifying God. And for his own sake, too. For, believe me, when a man utters the responses aloud, he awakens his own thoughts and his own feelings, too. He speaks to himself, and <b>he</b> hears <b>himself</b> <b>remind</b> <b>himself</b> of God, and of his duty to God, and acknowledge himself openly (as in confirmation) bound to believe and do what he, by his own confession, has assented unto.|$|R
6000|$|He went on {{with her}} in silence; he was much more {{affected}} by what {{she had told him}} than appeared. Ever since that evening of his return from Newport her image had had a terrible power to trouble him. What Clifford Wentworth had told him--that had affected him, too, in an adverse sense; but it had not liberated him from the discomfort of a charm of which his intelligence was impatient. [...] "She is not honest, she is not honest," [...] he kept murmuring to himself. That is what he had been saying to the summer sky, ten minutes before. Unfortunately, he was unable to say it finally, definitively; and now that he was near her it seemed to matter wonderfully little. [...] "She is a woman who will lie," [...] he had said to himself. Now, as he went along, <b>he</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>himself</b> of this observation; but it failed to frighten him as it had done before. He almost wished he could make her lie and then convict her of it, so that he might see how he should like that. He kept thinking of this as he walked by her side, while she moved forward with her light, graceful dignity. He had sat with her before; he had driven with her; but he had never walked with her.|$|E
60|$|He {{moved about}} the room in an agony of spirit. He knew it to be {{essential}} to his future happiness in life {{that he should be}} the master in his own house. And he felt that he could not be so unless he should be known to have been right in this terrible misfortune with which their married life had been commenced. There was no obliterating it, no forgetting it, no ignoring it. He had in his passion sent her away from him, and, passionately, she had withdrawn. Let them not say a word about it, there would still have been this terrible event in both their memories. And for himself he knew that unless it could be settled from the first that he had acted with justice, his life would be intolerable to him. He was a man, and it behoved him to have been just. She was a woman, and the feeling of having had to be forgiven would not be so severe with her. She, when taken a second time into grace and pardoned, might still rejoice and be happy. But for himself, <b>he</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>himself</b> {{over and over again that}} he was a man, and assured himself that he could never lift up his head were he by his silence to admit that he had been in the wrong.|$|E
60|$|His great friend, {{for that}} matter, was still absent, {{as well as}} remarkably silent; even {{at the end of}} three weeks Miss Gostrey hadn't come back. She wrote to him from Mentone, admitting that he must judge her grossly inconsequent--perhaps in fact for the time odiously faithless; but asking for patience, for a {{deferred}} sentence, throwing herself in short on his generosity. For her too, she could assure him, life was complicated--more complicated than he could have guessed; she had moreover made certain of him--certain of not wholly missing him on her return--before her disappearance. If furthermore she didn't burden him with letters it was frankly because of her sense of the other great commerce he had to carry on. He himself, {{at the end of a}} fortnight, had written twice, to show how his generosity could be trusted; but <b>he</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>himself</b> in each case of Mrs. Newsome's epistolary manner at the times when Mrs. Newsome kept off delicate ground. He sank his problem, he talked of Waymarsh and Miss Barrace, of little Bilham and the set over the river, with whom he had again had tea, and he was easy, for convenience, about Chad and Madame de Vionnet and Jeanne. He admitted that he continued to see them, he was decidedly so confirmed a haunter of Chad's premises and that young man's practical intimacy with them was so undeniably great; but he had his reason for not attempting to render for Miss Gostrey's benefit the impression of these last days. That would be to tell her too much about himself--it being at present just from himself he was trying to escape.|$|E
60|$|Burton stood quite {{still for}} a moment. It was absurd that his heart should be so {{suddenly}} heavy, that all the spring and buoyancy should {{have gone out of}} life! For the first time he realized the direction in which his thoughts had been travelling since he had left his rooms an hour ago. <b>He</b> had to <b>remind</b> <b>himself</b> that it was the professor whom he had come to see.|$|R
6000|$|... "This is a {{nice place}} for you, isn't it, Phil?--a capital light that from the roof, eh?" [...] was, as usual, {{the first thing he}} said on {{entering}} the painting-room. <b>He</b> liked to <b>remind</b> <b>himself</b> and his son too that his fatherly indulgence had provided the accommodation. He had been a good father. Emily would have nothing to reproach him with there, if she came back again from her grave.|$|R
50|$|Paul, {{speaking}} for himself, Silas, and Timothy, gives {{thanks for the}} news about their faith and love; <b>he</b> <b>reminds</b> them {{of the kind of}} life he had lived while he was with them. Paul stresses how honorably <b>he</b> conducted <b>himself,</b> <b>reminding</b> them that <b>he</b> had worked to earn his keep, taking great pains not to burden anyone. He did this, he says, even though he could have used his status as an apostle to impose upon them.|$|R
