500|$|Celia Larkin, {{writing on}} 12 February 2012 in the Irish Sunday Independent, said [...] "There was {{something}} very satisfying about Heather Mills finally having her voice heard above {{the roar of the}} Red Tops. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>actually</b> take the time to listen to Mills, I mean listen, not just read what's written about her, you'll see she is a strong, sincere, independent woman. She didn't lie down under the weight of McCartney's fame and wealth, she continued to plough her own furrow, campaigning for her charities, maintaining a strong individuality. And that, it seems, is the greatest sin of all. Is it any wonder she was reduced to tears in the October 2007 GMTV interview? Did we feel sympathy for her then? No. 'Heather Mills has Melt Down' screamed the headlines, so now she had lost her marbles to boot. And if that wasn't enough, Carole Malone of the Sunday Mirror, one of the papers that was relentless in its attacks on Mills, accused her of staging an act on live TV in order to further her cause in the upcoming divorce hearing. How cruel can you get?" ...|$|E

After appearing on the show for three years, James decided to quit and the character was killed off. She stated, [...] "It {{took me a long}} time to decide to leave Shortland Street because it isn't easy to walk away from something you love. I also had this fear I'd never get work again – it's a real fear. So it {{took me a long time}} to wrestle with the idea that saying no to work wasn't unwise, and that <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>actually</b> want to grow and develop as an actor you do have to stop and move on." [...] She found her final scenes draining, [...] "Everyone was acting around me and I was there, but my acting had basically stopped. I remember lying there thinking, 'I’m going to miss all these people.' I was quite teary, actually." ...|$|E

Paterniti wanted to portray the issue sensitively because {{she did not want to}} insult victims of domestic abuse. She felt it was challenging because no violence aspects were depicted.

[...] It's like, [...] "Oh, that's why you're not trying. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>actually</b> tried hard and it sucked, then you've got to blame yourself."

5000|$|Scott wanted Legend {{to have an}} {{original}} screenplay because he felt that [...] "it was far easier to design a story to fit the medium of cinema than bend the medium for an established story". By chance, he discovered several books written by William Hjortsberg {{and found that the}} writer had already written several scripts for some unmade lower-budgeted films. Scott asked him if he was interested in writing a fairy tale. Fortunately, he was already writing some and agreed. Scott remembers, [...] "The first notion was to actually make a classical fairy story, but <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>actually</b> analyze a classical fairy story, most are either very short, or very complex". The two men bonded over Jean Cocteau's 1946 film of Beauty and the Beast. In January 1981, just before beginning principal photography on Blade Runner, Scott and Hjortsberg spent five weeks working out a rough storyline for what was then called Legend of Darkness.|$|E

He revealed: [...] "And then there's the title track, even more Dylan-like because it's slower and, as far as the overall impression goes, more introspective. For all of its five and a half minutes, you are openly caressed by Harley's cockneyified vocals, vocals which nevertheless seem to mock the very idea of a nostalgic confessional song.

5000|$|Phil Sobel said, {{speaking}} about great saxophonists [...] "they all have great fingers. Fingers that are intimate with the instrument. Fingers that barely move and {{are always in}} touch with the horn. What did they know that most saxophonists do not? That the speed at which you put down or pick up a finger affects the sound and the pitch of the note. The distance from an open saxophone key to a closed key is very minimal, so any extra distance, i.e. starting with the finger above the key but not yet on the key is a waste of motion. The opposite is true also, that in opening a key <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>actually</b> lift your finger off of the key and come out of contact with the instrument, you have now wasted energy and motion in two directions because now you will have to get back down on the key to play it again. It is impossible not to see how much motion most saxophonists waste because they don't pay enough attention to their fingers." ...|$|E

At these events, he doesn't read his books out loud; he tells stories that he heard as a child and stories from his own life. “Before books, or even reading, should come the story, says Inuit storyteller and children's author Michael Kusugak.

5000|$|MS-DOS 2.0, {{released}} 1983, {{copied the}} hierarchical file system from Unix and thus used the (forward) slash, but (possibly on {{the insistence of}} IBM) added the backslash to allow paths to be typed at the command line interpreter's prompt while retaining compatibility with MS-DOS 1.0 and CP/M where the slash was the command-line option indicator (typing [...] "DIR/W" [...] gave the [...] "wide" [...] option to the [...] "DIR" [...] command, so some other method was needed <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>actually</b> wanted to run a program called W inside a directory called DIR).

They're so flashy and they want crowns, rhinestones, diamonds, and bright outfits. The flashiness and competitiveness reminds me of rap.

5000|$|Norwegian {{producers}} Mikkel S. Eriksen and Tor Erik Hermansen, {{better known}} as Stargate, both produced and wrote the song along with Ester Dean. Dean recorded a demo of the song, which was originally written for inclusion on Barbadian artist Rihanna's sixth studio album, Talk That Talk (2011). Rihanna ultimately decided not to record the song, thus {{it was given to}} Gomez for inclusion on Stars Dance. Gomez later spoke to Billboard on the collaboration with the trio, claiming [...] "I'm a huge Stargate fan - I think their beats and what they produce is just gold ...

[...] "Come & Get It" [...] was one of the last songs to be recorded for the album, which was completed in February 2013. While recording the song, Gomez knew she wanted it to be the lead single, stating [...] "I just remember recording it and being in the studio and just thinking of how the place I was in and what I was going through and I was just so excited about it and I wanted it to be the first single." [...] Gomez shared a similar sentiment in a later interview as well, adding [...] "The reason I wanted it to be the first single was because radiates, as I said before, trust and out and that's something I'm willing to share with the world. This is the place I want to be and want to represent something good and be a good example, so I think it's fun." ...|$|E
