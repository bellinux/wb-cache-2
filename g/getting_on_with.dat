American author and journalist Charles Kaiser, also writing in The New York Times, said that the book's strength is [...] "its ability to re-create the fear the Japanese engendered with their desperation tactics" [...] and the resulting American perception that they were all prepared to fight to the death. Kaiser added that younger readers may have a better understanding from this book of what led to US President Truman's decision to use the atomic bomb against Japan, [...] "even if they ... question the morality of that decision".|$|E
500|$|Ingres' {{early career}} {{coincided with the}} Romantic movement, which reacted against the {{prevailing}} neoclassical style. Neoclassicism in French art had developed as artists saw themselves {{as part of the}} cultural center of Europe, and France as the successor to Rome. Romantic painting was freer and more expressive, preoccupied more with colour than with line or form, and more focused on style than on subject matter. Paintings based on classical themes fell out of fashion, replaced by contemporary rather than historical subject matter, especially in portraiture. Ingres resisted this trend, and wrote, [...] "The history painter shows the species in general; while the portrait painter represents only the specific individual—a model often ordinary and full of shortcomings." [...] From his early career, Ingres' main source of income was commissioned portraits, a genre he dismissed as lacking in grandeur. The success of his The Vow of Louis XIII at the 1824 Salon marked an abrupt change in his fortunes: he received a series of commissions for large history paintings, and for the next decade he painted few portraits. [...] His financial difficulties behind him, Ingres could afford to concentrate on historical subjects, although he was highly sought-after as a portraitist. He wrote in 1847, [...] "Damned portraits, they are so difficult to do that they prevent me <b>getting</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> greater things that I could do more quickly." ...|$|E
500|$|On , Weinman {{wrote to}} Joyce, asking how the Mint was <b>getting</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> the dies for the half dollar and dime, and expressing his {{willingness}} to come to Philadelphia. [...] Joyce replied two days later, informing him that {{the design of the}} half dollar was being reduced in size to prevent recurrence of the edge difficulties, and informing him of the beaded border. [...] Weinman responded hoping that Joyce would prevent the figure of Liberty from being unduly reduced, and rendering his account. [...] As the sculptor and superintendent corresponded, the Mint began the work of converting the Barber-modified designs to working dies from which circulation coins could be struck, but Joyce interceded before coining could begin. [...] The Philadelphia Mint superintendent, who had the support of von Engelken, felt that Barber's modifications were unnecessary. [...] Joyce believed that coins closer to Weinman's concept could be struck by lowering the relief slightly, adjusting the force with which the Mint's presses struck the planchets or blanks, and better preparing the planchets for striking. [...] Joyce's position prevailed, and Barber and his department prepared working dies for striking of circulation pieces, omitting Barber's beaded border and wide space between rim and design. [...] Working dies were at the Denver and San Francisco Mints on , and production began at all three mints soon after.|$|E

500|$|Promoted to air marshal, Newham became Chief of the Air Staff (CAS) on 21 May 1985, {{succeeding}} Air Marshal David Evans. [...] Newham initially {{endorsed the}} Federal government's 1986 Review of Australia's Defence Capabilities, {{otherwise known as}} the Dibb Report, but shortly afterwards publicly criticised its [...] "understanding of the application of air power" [...] and [...] "debatable judgments", especially its lukewarm attitude to the employment of the F-111s for strategic strike. At a conference the same year, he reiterated the RAAF's position that [...] "defensive action may prevent defeat, but wars can be won only by offensive action". On 9 June, he was raised to Companion of the Order of Australia for service to the RAAF, [...] "particularly as Chief of the Air Staff". Newham's term as CAS was also marked by the Federal government's decision to transfer the RAAF's battlefield helicopters to the Australian Army, against the recommendation of an independent committee. According to Air Force historians Alan Stephens and Keith Isaacs, [...] "Newham protected {{the best interests of}} the Australian Defence Force by <b>getting</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> the business of effecting the transfer, notwithstanding the deep disappointment within his own service. In February 1987, OPCOM (subsequently Air Command) was restructured into Force Element Groups (FEGs), large functional organisations that supplanted the earlier concept of all-powerful air base commands, to which every unit on a base reported. Initially established on a one-year trial basis, the FEGs have remained in place.|$|E
500|$|The {{arrival of}} Chrissie Watts was {{announced}} barely {{a month before}} she was set to first appear on-screen, and {{came at a time}} when EastEnders was undergoing immense media criticism and falling ratings. The rush of casting meant Oberman had little time to process the enormity of the part she had taken on, declaring: [...] "my feet haven't even touched the ground yet. [...] I haven't had time to think about what this role is going to do to my life! I'm very excited to be part of such a fantastic show and one I have been a fan of for many years." [...] She admitted, however, to being [...] "slightly intimidated" [...] by the high media profile and press interest surrounding the show at the time. Indeed, joining EastEnders [...] "proved to be something of a baptism of fire for Oberman", as she was playing opposite Leslie Grantham whose recent return to the show had been a highly publicised event. Twenty-four hours after Chrissie's first episode went to air a scandal surrounding Grantham hit the tabloid papers. According to Oberman, the atmosphere on set the next day [...] "was a bit tense" [...] but, she added, [...] "the Watts are pulling together and we're <b>getting</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> it and working". However Oberman was also reportedly finding things difficult, having walked into a highly complicated situation: [...] "Tracy-Ann is still really finding her feet on the show... she feels really left out because all the cast are blackballing Grantham and refusing to talk to him. Since most of her scenes are with Grantham, it's really hard for her." [...] Looking back on the incident after she had left EastEnders, Oberman remarked, [...] "I respect Leslie for fronting it out; he emerged from his dressing room and started working. No one mentioned the story. That's life in EastEnders; the machine never stops." ...|$|E
500|$|City of Death {{was voted}} into seventh {{place in a}} 1998 poll of the readers of Doctor Who Magazine {{to find the best}} Doctor Who story; the {{magazine}} commented that it [...] "represented the height of Doctor Who as popular light entertainment for all the family". In 2009, Doctor Who Magazine readers voted it in eighth place. In a more recent 2014 poll, the magazine's readers voted it fifth best Doctor Who story of all time. A 2008 article in The Daily Telegraph named City of Death one of the ten greatest episodes of Doctor Who. John Condor, writing in the fanzine DWB in 1991, hailed the story as [...] "the best blend of kitsch, surrealism, fantasy and comedy-drama seen in our favourite Time Lord's annals". Vanessa Bishop, reviewing the serial's DVD release, described it as [...] "imaginatively written, well-performed and beautifully made, City of Death is a story where pretty much everything works". Reacting to the serial, as part of Doctor Who Magazines ongoing [...] "Time Team" [...] feature, Jacqueline Rayner said [...] "you're suddenly, almost violently, made aware this is happening in our world... with people just <b>getting</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> their business and two Time Lords walking through it. I don't think I've ever experienced that with Doctor Who up till now... it's the tiny touches of mundanity amid the fantastical that lift the story even higher". Charlie Jane Anders and Javier Grillo-Marxuach of io9 included it on their list of [...] "10 TV Episodes that Changed Television", citing [...] "the sharp dialogue and clever use of time travel [...] prefigure everything Steven Moffat has done with the series in recent years." [...] The A.V. Club reviewer Christopher Bahn described City of Death as the [...] "gem" [...] of the seventeenth season, finding Adams' subtle comedy script [...] "easily the funniest and most quotable the series ever achieved". While he praised Scarlioni's costume and the mask, he felt that more could have been done with using Paris as a filming location.|$|E

2500|$|Idle {{was born}} in Harton Hospital, in South Shields in County Durham, to which {{his mother had been}} {{evacuated}} from the north west of England. His mother, Norah Barron (Sanderson), was a health visitor and his father, Ernest Idle, served in the Royal Air Force during World War II, only to be killed in a hitch-hiking accident shortly after the war. His mother had difficulty coping with a full-time job and bringing up a child, so when Idle was seven, she enrolled him in the Royal Wolverhampton School as a boarder. At this time, the school was a charitable foundation dedicated to the education and maintenance of children who had lost one or both parents. Idle is quoted as saying: [...] "It was a physically abusive, bullying, harsh environment for a kid to grow up in. I got used to dealing with groups of boys and <b>getting</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> life in unpleasant circumstances and being smart and funny and subversive at the expense of authority.

2500|$|... "Scotland {{had lost}} both Tests against the All Blacks {{earlier in the}} season but the second, in Auckland, had been close: the Blacks just sneaked home by 21-18.

We were lulled into {{a false sense of security}} and yet, on the day, we were also intimidated because we didn't play our natural game, preferring instead to sit back and wait for them to come at us. Also, we didn't kick well that day, particularly Michael Lynagh. I hardly saw the ball, and when I did I was clobbered. Not feeling the ball in my hands destroys me anyway; I cannot take it.
