5|$|I {{had it in}} my head {{to write}} an epic of it, but though <b>I</b> <b>still</b> hanker after it, I see clearly it would be foolish, for no verse could render {{the best parts of}} it, and it would only be a flatter and tamer version of a thing already existing.|$|E
5|$|Do I wish I {{had never}} endured post-partum depression? Absolutely. But {{to deny the}} {{experience}} is to deny who I am. <b>I</b> <b>still</b> mourn the loss of what could have been, but I also feel deep gratitude for those who stood by me, for the lesson that we must never be afraid to ask for help, and for the feeling of summer that still remains.|$|E
5|$|I didn't {{even know}} the project was coming out. I didn't know what the beat was for; I just knew Eminem asked me for the files and I sent it to them.... When I saw Eminem in L.A. for Grammy weekend, Eminem said, 'Yeah, he ripped the track.' Later on that day, I met Royce, and Royce was like, 'Yeah, {{download}} that track man. We ripped that track. That's the first single.' I was like, 'What?' But until then, <b>I</b> <b>still</b> wasn't sure.|$|E

5|$|In {{this book}} I {{maintained}} that a sphere of freedom is still desirable {{even in a}} socialist state, but this sphere has to be defined afresh and not in liberal terms. This doctrine <b>I</b> <b>still</b> hold. The thesis of this book seems to me important, and I hoped that it would attract more attention than it has done. It {{was intended as a}} refutation both of Marx and of the classical economists, not on a point of detail, but on the fundamental assumptions that they shared. I argued that power, rather than wealth, should be the basic concept in social theory, and that social justice should consist in equalisation of power to the greatest practicable degree. It followed that State ownership of land and capital was no advance unless the State was democratic, and even then only if methods were devised for curbing the power of officials. A part of my thesis was taken up and popularised in Burnham's Managerial Revolution, but otherwise the book fell rather flat. <b>I</b> <b>still</b> hold, however, that what it has to say is of very great importance if the evils of totalitarianism are to be avoided, particularly under a Socialist régime.|$|E
5|$|The early 18th century {{ushered in}} the rule of Kanthirava Narasaraja II, who, being both deaf and mute, ruled under the regency {{of a series of}} army chiefs (Delavoys) all of whom hailed from a single family from the village of Kalale in the Nanjangud taluk (or sub-district) of Mysore. Upon the ruler's death in 1714 at the age of 41, his son, Dodda Krishnaraja <b>I,</b> <b>still</b> two weeks shy of his 12th birthday, succeeded him.|$|E

I mean, <b>I</b> <b>still,</b> I {{do the same things}} that I did before … I think about the same things, so … I'm the wrong kind of person to be really big and famous.|$|E

5|$|The first {{incarnation}} {{of my life}} was as a ruthless killer. <b>I</b> <b>still</b> live {{with a sense of}} sin over those I killed.

Harada also traveled to the United Kingdom and United States to meet some of the American and British airmen he had fought against, including the American ace Joe Foss who {{is believed to have been}} the pilot who shot down his plane.
