40|$|Abstract This article {{considers}} {{the impact of}} risk management and monitoring costs on insurer’s monitoring activities and investigates the relationship between risk management and monitoring activities and setting {{the level of the}} <b>insurance</b> <b>premium.</b> The main results of this article are as follows. First, a firm always undertakes risk management when the risk management cost is low. Second, when the insurer can spontaneously choose the level of the <b>insurance</b> <b>premium,</b> the insurer’s incentive to monitor the firm decreases, and risk management activities will not be promoted, because the cost of the accident can be directly reflected in the level of the <b>insurance</b> <b>premium.</b> In contrast, when the level of the <b>insurance</b> <b>premium</b> is exogenously decided, the insurer’s incentive to monitor the firm increases and risk management activities will be promoted, because the cost of accidents cannot be directly reflected in the level of the <b>insurance</b> <b>premium.</b> These results have the following implications for policy making. First, the results imply that policy should be designed to lower risk management costs by offering a platform for firms to exchange useful information with each other and/or reduce taxes for investments that lower risk management costs. Second, the results imply that both heavy <b>insurance</b> <b>premium</b> regulation and the <b>insurance</b> <b>premium</b> deregulation to realize a fierce competitive insurance market are desirable for promoting risk management activities...|$|R

State officials claimed the action caused <b>insurance</b> <b>premiums</b> to go up dramatically. Many states sued in federal court on the grounds that Trump was not legally allowed to take the action.|$|E
5|$|A patient's genome {{may include}} an {{inherited}} or random mutation which affects {{the probability of}} developing a disease in the future. For example, Lynch syndrome is a genetic disease that predisposes patients to colorectal and other cancers; early detection can lead to close monitoring that improves the patient's chances of a good outcome. Cardiovascular risk is indicated by biological markers and screening can measure the risk that a child will be born with a genetic disease such as Cystic fibrosis. Genetic testing is ethically complex: patients may not want the stress of knowing their risk. In countries without universal healthcare, a known risk may raise <b>insurance</b> <b>premiums.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 2010, the Obama {{administration}} {{passed the}} Affordable Care Act, {{which made the}} most sweeping reforms to the nation's healthcare system in nearly five decades, including mandates, subsidies and insurance exchanges. The law caused {{a significant reduction in}} the number and percentage of people without health insurance, with 24 million covered during 2016, but remains controversial due to its impact on healthcare costs, <b>insurance</b> <b>premiums,</b> and economic performance. Although the recession reached its trough in June 2009, voters remained frustrated with the slow pace of the economic recovery. The Republicans, who stood in opposition to Obama's policies, won control of the House of Representatives with a landslide in 2010 and control of the Senate in 2014.|$|E

5|$|The ACA {{also helps}} reduce income {{inequality}} measured after taxes, due to higher {{taxes on the}} top 5% of income earners and both subsidies and Medicaid expansion for lower-income persons. CBO estimated that subsidies paid under the law in 2016 averaged $4,240 per person for 10 million individuals receiving them, roughly $42 billion. For scale, the subsidy for the employer market, {{in the form of}} exempting from taxation those health <b>insurance</b> <b>premiums</b> paid on behalf of employees by employers, was approximately $1,700 per person in 2016, or $266 billion total in the employer market. The employer market subsidy was not changed by the law.|$|E
5|$|The agency's Small Investment Program aims {{to promote}} FDI into {{specifically}} small and medium enterprises. The program offers standard MIGA coverage types except {{it does not}} cover breaches of contract. Under the program, small and medium enterprises may take advantage of discounted <b>insurance</b> <b>premiums</b> and no application fees, which are not available to larger investors. To qualify an investment for the Small Investment Program, MIGA defines small and medium enterprise projects as having 300 or fewer employees, total assets not to exceed $15million and annual revenues not to exceed $15million. MIGA limits the request amount for the investment guarantee to $10million, and will guarantee only up to 10years with a possible 5-year extension.|$|E
5|$|Many Public Storage {{customers}} have filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau regarding insurance policies sold by Public Storage representatives, after experiencing burglaries of their storage units then having their insurance claims denied. Investigative journalists from TV news stations in California, Kansas, and Washington have reported on difficulties consumers had when filing insurance claims for burglaries with Willis and The New Hampshire Insurance Company, which are affiliated with Public Storage. For example, claims {{have been denied}} because the storage unit had an intact lock; affiliated insurance companies cited insufficient evidence of forced entry, though burglars often replace the unit's lock {{in an attempt to}} conceal the burglary. Insurance commissioners in two states have criticized the practices of insurance companies affiliated with Public Storage. An ongoing class action lawsuit alleges Public Storage misleads consumers into thinking that <b>insurance</b> <b>premiums</b> are charged at cost, whereas a substantial amount of those premiums are retained as profits by Public Storage. Sales of these insurance policies do have a high profit, but generate less than five percent of the company's total revenue.|$|E

5|$|Soon after Chandler took office, {{it became}} clear that he could not fund the social {{programs}} initiated by Clements and Wetherby, plus Chandler's own proposed programs, with the revenue presently being brought into the state treasury. He cut the popular Youth Authority, initiated by Wetherby to unify the state's children's welfare programs, but the savings were not enough to balance the budget. In order to deliver on his campaign promises, Chandler ignored the budget during the regular legislative session in 1956, then called a special session during which he presented his budget proposal. The proposal called for spending in excess of $46million more than officials estimated would be brought into the state's coffers over the two-year budget. Chandler convinced legislators to pass the budget, promising to propose a tax plan to pay for the expenditures in a subsequent special session. The promised package added 150,000 citizens to the state's tax rolls, put a surtax on income taxes, and cut tax credits. It created a new 5 percent production tax on whisky, and added taxes to deeds and life <b>insurance</b> <b>premiums.</b> It increased the state gasoline tax for trucks by two cents per gallon and raised corporate taxes by half a percent. In addition, it transferred the assessment and collection of taxes on certain intangibles from local to state government. The plan also called for a $100million bond issue, allowing the allocation of generous budgets for state universities and colleges and improvements to the state highway system.|$|E

25|$|The {{amount of}} the subsidy given to a family {{to cover the cost}} of a premium is {{calculated}} using a formula that includes the family's income relative to the federal poverty level. The federal poverty level is related to a determined percentage that defines how much of that family's income can be put towards a health insurance premium. For instance, under the House Bill, a family at 200% of the federal poverty level will spend no more than 5.5% of its annual income on health <b>insurance</b> <b>premiums.</b> Under the Senate Bill, the same family would spend no more than 6.3% of its annual income on health <b>insurance</b> <b>premiums.</b> The difference between the family's maximum contribution to health <b>insurance</b> <b>premiums</b> and the cost of the health insurance premium is paid for by the federal government.|$|E

Compare to other insurance products, it submits lower <b>insurance</b> <b>premium</b> for low-risk individuals but higher <b>insurance</b> <b>premium</b> for high-risk individuals. Moreover, an adverse selection problem appears because the insurance companies cannot observe each risk type. But the other insurance which does not discriminate the <b>insurance</b> <b>premium</b> is not necessarily desirable because it appears cross subsidization from low-risk individuals to high-risk individuals. This paper concludes that pooling insurance is tendency to socially desirable in the situation where difference between two risk types and/or the number of high risk individuals is low...|$|R
