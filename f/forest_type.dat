5|$|Despite {{the advent}} of iron {{reinforced}} plows and other improved methods of crop cultivation, the regional environmental conditions placed limits on the practicality and extend of land tillage, but various grains, beans and peas were grown. The dense forest coverage {{on the other hand}} facilitated gathering and was more amenable to the raising of farm animals, which involved all of the major species, including in particular the small, <b>forest</b> <b>type</b> horses. The horses constituted an important element of the Baltic tribes' culture – men of the upper socioeconomic status were often buried with their horses and even together with their fancy horsemanship gear.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} assesses {{the level of}} {{sensitivity}} to desertification of <b>forest</b> <b>types</b> in Italy between 2000 and 2010 on a fine resolution scale using the Environmental Sensitive Area (ESA) scheme. The proposed methodology identifies and ranks the level of sensitivity of fourteen <b>forest</b> <b>types</b> and quantifies the changes in their level of sensitivity over time as a contribution to understanding of complex landscape-forest interactions in Mediterranean ecosystems. Only few <b>forest</b> <b>types</b> showed a relatively high sensitivity level, suggesting that forests may positively contribute to the mitigation of land degradation processes in the Mediterranean region. <b>Forest</b> <b>types</b> showing the highest sensitivity are native types mostly adapted to dry Mediterranean landscapes, introduced vegetation types and highly-fragmented and heterogeneous <b>forest</b> <b>types.</b> Results suggest that: (i) high-quality and biodiversity-rich <b>forest</b> <b>types</b> (e. g., beech, mountain pine forests) may act as vegetation buffer mitigating the increase of land sensitivity to desertification at the landscape scale; and (ii) the remaining <b>forest</b> <b>types</b> (especially highly fragmented, low-quality or low-biodiversity classes in areas with severe soil and climate conditions) may undergo increases in land sensitivity to desertification and should be protected through specific management measures as also implemented {{in the framework of}} the National Action Plans to Combat Desertification...|$|R
40|$|The genus Nepenthes {{is known}} to be diverse in Bornean fo rests and has been   {{recorded}} in Brunei Darussalam in various <b>forest</b> <b>types.</b> We aim to investigate variation in Nepenthes species richness and abundance at five <b>forest</b> <b>types</b> throughout Brunei Darussalam: open secondary, heath, peat swamp, white sand and mixed dipterocarp forests. A total of thirty-nine 5 × 5 m 2 plots were set up in these <b>forest</b> <b>types.</b> Within each plot,     Nepenthes species abundance was quantified, with Nepenthes voucher specimens collected and identified to determine species richness. No significant differences were detected either for Nepenthes species richness or abundance between the five <b>forest</b> <b>types,</b> despite records of Nepenthes in Brunei showing preferences for particular habitat types.

5|$|Two villages {{situated}} on the southern boundary were shifted to the Firozpur–Manpur area {{situated on}} Ramnagar–Kashipur highway during 1990–93; the vacated areas were designated as buffer zones. The families in these villages were mostly dependent on forest products. With the passage of time, these areas began {{to show signs of}} ecological recovery. Vines, herbs, grasses and small trees began to appear, followed by herbaceous flora, eventually leading to natural <b>forest</b> <b>type.</b> It was observed that grass began to grow on the vacated agricultural fields and the adjoining forest areas started recuperating. By 1999–2002 several plant species emerged in these buffer zones. The newly arisen lush green fields attracted grass eating animals, mainly deer and elephants, who slowly migrated towards these areas and even preferred to stay there throughout the monsoon.|$|E

30|$|Some of the {{variation}} among studies may reflect differences among geographic regions and <b>forest</b> <b>types</b> covered. All three subspecies of spotted owls inhabit <b>forest</b> <b>types</b> ranging from wet to fairly dry. For example, forests inhabited by northern spotted owls range from very mesic {{in places such as}} the Olympic Peninsula, Washington, to drier <b>forest</b> <b>types</b> on the eastern slope of the Cascade Mountains (Anthony et al. 2006). Similarly, California spotted owls inhabit relatively mesic conifer-dominated forests at higher elevations in the Sierra Nevada, but also inhabit oak (Quercus spp.) woodlands in the foothills and conifer-hardwood mixtures in the Peninsular Mountains of southern California (Verner et al. 1992). And Mexican spotted owls inhabit both rocky canyonlands and a range of <b>forest</b> <b>types</b> from wet mixed-conifer forests to drier pine-oak <b>forest</b> <b>types</b> (USDI FWS 2012). There is little reason to expect fire behavior to be similar across the range of occupied <b>forest</b> <b>types,</b> and therefore may be little reason to expect owl response to be similar among subspecies, geographic areas, and <b>forest</b> <b>types.</b> In this context, note that most of the available studies are on California spotted owls (Table 1). Far less information is available from the range of the northern and, especially, the Mexican spotted owl, and the responses of these subspecies may not be well described by studies of California spotted owls.|$|R
30|$|These early {{forest biomass}} studies {{were aimed at}} major or typical <b>forest</b> <b>types,</b> with {{developed}} biomass models largely based on stand or sample plot levels. Some biomass models were even based on individual tree data, most of them suited only for certain sites or local areas, not representative of larger regions. These forest carbon assessments were based on estimates of biomass per hectare for our major <b>forest</b> <b>types</b> from purposeful sampling and areas of <b>forest</b> <b>types</b> from our national forest inventory, which is not really suited for monitoring and assessing forest carbon storage.|$|R
25|$|At {{the highest}} elevations, {{near the top}} of Cerro de Punta, Cerro Maravilla and similar peaks, grows the Bosque enano forest, also known as dwarf forest, cloud forest, elfin forest and moss forest. This <b>forest</b> <b>type</b> is {{composed}} of very dense stands of small, stunted trees and shrubs. The cloud forest has many of the same tree species as the Bosque Micropholis Buchenavia forest, but growth is limited by adverse climate—heavy rain, strong winds, and almost constant cloud cover.|$|E
25|$|Eucalypts {{originated}} between 35 and 50 {{million years}} ago, {{not long after}} Australia-New Guinea separated from Gondwana, their rise coinciding {{with an increase in}} fossil charcoal deposits (suggesting that fire was a factor even then), but they remained a minor component of the Tertiary rainforest until about 20 million years ago, when the gradual drying of the continent and depletion of soil nutrients {{led to the development of}} a more open <b>forest</b> <b>type,</b> predominantly Casuarina and Acacia species.|$|E
25|$|<b>Forest</b> <b>type</b> {{and quality}} change with {{increasing}} altitude. At 2000 meters the natural, undisturbed forest begins to be seen. Above 2500 meters dwarf conifers and rhododendrons predominate {{in the harsh}} “elfin forest”, so called because a lack of topsoil and nutrients means that fully mature trees grow to measure only a few meters in height. Higher still, only the hardiest of plant species are found. At over 3000 meters, Fan Si Pan's summit can only support dwarf bamboo.|$|E
40|$|The {{availability}} of common standardized geospatial information on composition, structure {{and distribution of}} forests is essential to support environmental actions, sustainable forest management and planning policies. <b>Forest</b> <b>types</b> maps are suitable tools for supporting both silvicultural and forest planning choices from local to global scale levels. For this reason local authorities may develop <b>forest</b> <b>types</b> maps independently, in which case a standardized/harmonized framework for their comparison and aggregation is essential. At the same time local <b>forest</b> <b>types</b> maps may not be directly related to pan-European forest resources assessments and classification systems. This paper presents results of the harmonization of four <b>forest</b> <b>types</b> maps available for central Italy. The process {{is based on a}} bottom-up approach aimed at maintaining the most detailed common nomenclature system across the different Regions. The final results, in terms of <b>forest</b> <b>types</b> area, are compared with several independent sources of information: (i) two forest maps, one developed at national level {{on the basis of the}} Corine Land Cover 2006, and one for high resolution forest / non forest classification developed at pan-European level; and (ii) two sample based inventories: the Italian National Forest Inventory (INFC) and the Italian Land Use Inventory (IUTI).

25|$|Because of its low elevation, {{the forests}} on Mount Tremper are {{dominated}} by a <b>forest</b> <b>type</b> {{referred to in the}} Catskills as southern hardwoods. This is dominated by oak, hickory and pine species, with some basswood and poplar scattered in lower elevations. Chestnut were once common as well, but most died off in the blight of the early 20th century. Some eastern hemlocks, once more widespread before they were harvested for their tannin-rich bark, remain, primarily higher on the mountain where the barkpeelers never reached. The summit ridge has some areas of the northern hardwood forest (beech, birch and maple) more common on higher Catskill slopes. The more shade-tolerant northern hardwoods are slowly invading the southern hardwoods as an understory; due to the cessation of human intervention in the forest they will eventually displace the southern hardwoods.|$|E

Using discriminant functions analysis, a 100 % floristic and a 78 % vegetation structural discrimination was obtained between the three <b>forest</b> <b>types.</b> However, the bird communities of these floristically and structurally different <b>forest</b> <b>types</b> were very similar in species composition and had much lower densities than normally encountered in other superficially similar forests. It was only possible to discriminate between the wet and the moist/dry <b>forest</b> <b>types</b> by using the two best bird discriminators. the blackheaded oriole (Oriolus larvatus) and the sombre bulbul (Andropadus importunus). A separation of the moist and dry <b>forest</b> <b>types</b> was not possible.
