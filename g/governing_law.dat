40|$|This {{dissertation}} has two parts. In the first, I set out {{and defend}} a new empirical method of practicing metaphysics. The method avoids appeals to intuitions, ordinary beliefs, and the like. It {{does not accept}} basic principles of simplicity, unity, and the like. Instead, it proceeds from logic, analytic principles, and immediate experience alone. In {{the second part of}} my dissertation, I apply this method to the philosophy of laws of nature. I argue that there are excellent empirical reasons to accept <b>governing</b> <b>laws</b> instead of laws that reduce to other features of the world, such as natural regularities or facts about bare dispositions. The central idea is that observed natural regularities constitute strong evidence in favor of <b>governing</b> <b>laws</b> and against all competing theories. Further, I argue that the only intelligible account of <b>governing</b> <b>laws</b> is one according to which the connection between law and regularity is an irreducible necessary connection. Thus, the second part of my dissertation constitutes a new argument for metaphysically interesting a posteriori necessities...|$|R
25|$|In June 1896, Ghenadie {{received}} {{an order from}} the Attorney General to vacate the Metropolitan's Palace. He objected, arguing that the Synod had broken the <b>governing</b> <b>law,</b> and stating that he would only leave if presented with a Royal Decree. As a consequence, Ghenadie {{was taken into custody}} by the authorities, driven out of the Palace through a side door, and taken by Romanian Police carriage to Căldărușani Monastery, where his banishment came in effect. Reportedly, the prosecutors caused embarrassment when they also proceeded to evacuate Ghenadie's friends and supporters, including Conservative politico Lascăr Catargiu, out of the repossessed building. A while after, Carol signed a Royal Decree confirming his government's decision, and the interim leadership was left to a triumvirate of bishops: Partenie Clinceni, Iosif Naniescu, Gherasim Timuș.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, COSEWIC in {{an update}} {{designated}} the Newfoundland and Labrador population of Atlantic cod as endangered, and Fisheries Minister Robert Thibault announced an indefinite {{closure of the}} cod fishery in the Gulf of St. Lawrence and off the northeast coast of Newfoundland. In the Canadian system however under the 2002 Species at Risk Act the ultimate determination of conservation status (e.g. endangered) is a political, cabinet-level decision; Cabinet decided to not accept COSEWIC's 2003 recommendations. Bell has explained how both COSEWIC and public perceptions were manipulated, and the <b>governing</b> <b>law</b> broken, to favour that decision. In 2005 the WWF-Canada accused both foreign and Canadian fishing vessels of deliberate, large-scale violations of the restrictions on cod fishing on the Grand Banks, {{in the form of}} bycatch and of poor enforcement of the restrictions by NAFO, an intergovernmental organization with a mandate to provide scientific advice and management of fisheries in the northwestern part of the Atlantic Ocean.|$|E

50|$|At the {{opposite}} end of the spectrum, in some states—particularly the New England states—the state legislature has plenary authority over municipalities, and may create or abolish them, or change their <b>governing</b> <b>laws,</b> at will. These states typically have very weak traditions of home rule, such that any significant legal change to a city or town's charter or <b>governing</b> <b>laws,</b> or an agreement between municipalities, must be authorized by an act of the legislature. There is usually a legal process by which a community may petition the legislature for such a change, and the outcome of this process, if the legislature consents, is special legislation.|$|R

2500|$|Minnesota law provides: [...] "when {{a married}} woman has sexual {{intercourse}} with a man other than her husband, whether married or not, both are guilty of adultery." [...] In the 2003 New Hampshire Supreme Court case Blanchflower v. Blanchflower, it was held that female same-sex sexual relations did not constitute sexual intercourse, based on a 1961 definition from Webster's Third New International Dictionary; and thereby an accused wife in a divorce case {{was found not guilty}} of adultery. In 2001, Virginia prosecuted an attorney, John R. Bushey, for adultery, a case that ended in a guilty plea and a $125 fine. Adultery is against the <b>governing</b> <b>law</b> of the U.S. military.|$|E
2500|$|The {{distinction}} between [...] "movables" [...] (not associated {{in any way}} with real estate as such nor necessary to its enjoyment) and [...] "immovables" [...] (such as buildings and often including spare parts or even potentially but not usually mobile tools or devices or systems) arises from the principle of lex situs, by which the <b>governing</b> <b>law</b> for immovables is that where the land is located, regardless of where a will is probated or contract made or executed. [...] There are distinctions made between monetary claim on land and land itself, often with different limitations. [...] However, these distinctions determine jurisdiction, rather than define how to resolve the conversion or possession issue.|$|E
60|$|In {{the third}} chapter I seek to {{describe}} the quite extraordinary atmosphere in which such things have become possible. I call that atmosphere anarchy; but insist {{that it is an}} anarchy in the centres where there should be authority. Government has become ungovernable; that is, it cannot leave off <b>governing.</b> <b>Law</b> has become lawless; that is, it cannot see where laws should stop. The chief feature of our time is the meekness of the mob and the madness of the government. In this atmosphere it is natural enough that medical experts, being authorities, should go mad, and attempt so crude and random and immature a dream as this of petting and patting (and rather spoiling) the babe unborn.|$|E

And art of this period in all countries, including our own Norman especially, is, in the inner heart of it, the subjection of savage or terrible, or foolish and erring life, to a dominant law. It is government and conquest of fearful dreams. There is in it as yet no germ of true hope--only the conquest of evil, and the waking from darkness and terror. The literature of it is, as in Greece, far in advance of art, and is already full of the most tender and impassioned beauty, while the art is still grotesque and dreadful; but, however wild, it is supreme above all others by its expression of <b>governing</b> <b>law,</b> and here at Verona is the very center and utmost reach of that expression.|$|E
