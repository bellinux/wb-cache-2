40|$|The {{adsorption}} and <b>dissociation</b> <b>of</b> nitrogen <b>molecule</b> on Fe(111) {{surface is}} studied by density functional theory calculations.

In addition, Fe(111) surface is more active in dissociating N 2 than Fe(100) surface due to its morphology. The interaction between antibonding molecular orbitals of N 2 and partially filled $ 3 d$ orbitals of Fe atoms on the surface may be the key to the molecular <b>dissociation</b> <b>of</b> N 2. To break down the triple bond of N 2, the electron density on the surface needs to be partially transferred to the molecule to fill the antibonding molecular orbitals <b>of</b> the nitrogen <b>molecule.</b> The present result may provide some insights on the <b>dissociation</b> mechanism <b>of</b> <b>molecules</b> over transition metal surfaces...|$|R

The system has a phase transition in which the atomic condensate emerges in a nonanalytic fashion.
