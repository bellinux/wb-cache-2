50|$|Flood control {{channels}} {{are large and}} empty basins which let water flow in and out (except during flooding) or dry channels that run below the street levels of some larger cities, so that if and when a flood occurs, the water will run into these channels, and eventually drain into a river or other body of water.

These structures may be made entirely of concrete, with concrete sides and an exposed bottom, with riprap sides and an exposed bottom, or completely unlined. They often contain <b>grade</b> <b>control</b> sills or weirs to prevent erosion and maintain a level streambed. By definition, flood control channels range from the size of a street gutter to a few hundred or even a few thousand feet wide in some rare cases.

One city with many of these channels is Los Angeles, as they became mandatory with the passage of the Flood Control Act of 1941 passed in the wake of the Los Angeles Flood of 1938.|$|E
50|$|However, {{there are}} {{significant}} barriers for anadromous steelhead to run up Stevens Creek to spawn. In a 1994 study, the Santa Clara Valley Water District (SCVWD) found fish ladders at the Central Expressway and U.S. Route 101 often had insufficient flow and/or were clogged with debris and sediment. In addition, the drop structure at L’Avenida Avenue was impassable in all five years of the study. In August, 2003 the Stevens & Permanente Creeks Watershed Council was officially formed to support stewardship of the watersheds. The SCVWD’s Fish and Aquatic Habitat Collaborative Effort (FAHCE), has recommended removal of the Denil-type fish ladders at Fremont Avenue, Evelyn Avenue, and Moffett Boulevard which tend to clog with debris and are now classified as partial barriers by the California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG). Adjacent to the fish ladder at Moffett Boulevard is a concrete drop structure built in the 1980s which is another obstacle to salmonid passage. The existing concrete-lined channel extending further downstream to Highway 101 (a distance of 450 ft is flat and low flows cross it as a thin sheet of water over the concrete bottom. At least 6 in depth of flow is required for adequate fish passage. Although steehead continue to spawn in lower Stevens Creek, it is doubtful whether young trout can oversummer for {{one to two years}} in its drier, hotter lower reaches. In a 2004 report of factors limiting steelhead trout survival, the key recommendation was to improve access for spawning steelhead in the lower reaches of the creek (which gets very warm or even dry in summer) to the upper reaches of Stevens Creek which have perennial flows of colder water. In addition, if the Permanente Creek Diversion Channel could be modified to accommodate steelhead trout in-migration, then several miles of upper Permanente Creek, which currently holds a population of stream resident coastal rainbow trout, would be available for spawning. A NOAA/National Marine Fisheries Service report on the Stevens Creek steelhead trout population in April 2013 found a high density of spawning Redds below the Evelyn Avenue fish ladder and <b>grade</b> <b>control</b> structure, but that this barrier was forcing most of the steelhead to spawn in the undesirable lower reaches of the stream, and that it has been a significant barrier to upstream spawning runs for at least the past four years. Under the water district’s Fish and Aquatic Habitat Collaborative Effort (FAHCE), Stevens Creek has been identified as one of the prime steelhead habitats within Santa Clara County and plans are underway to remove three barriers to fish passage in the lower creek: at Moffett Boulevard, Evelyn Avenue and Fremont Avenue.|$|E

Engineered structures and stream restoration designs are common solutions to fish passage; however, in urban systems such solutions may not be feasible. Natural structures such as riffle <b>grade</b> <b>controls</b> and flow constrictor/step pools can provide low-maintenance stable solutions to fish passage in urban systems. Steps to designing such structures include an evaluation of the target fish species characteristics, site-specific baseflow hydrology, and hydraulics of the structure.

Fish characteristics, hydrology, and hydraulics are all used to generate fish passage design criteria...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{challenges}} of the mining industry {{is to ensure that}} produced tonnages and grades are aligned with targets derived from model-based expectations. Unexpected deviations, resulting from large uncertainties in the <b>grade</b> <b>control</b> model, often occur and strongly impact resource recovery and process efficiency. During operation, local predictions can be significantly improved when deviations are monitored and integrated back into the <b>grade</b> <b>control</b> model. This contribution introduces a novel realization-based approach to real-time updating of the <b>grade</b> <b>control</b> model by utilizing online data from a production monitoring network. An algorithm is presented that specifically deals with the problems of an operating mining environment. Due to the complexity of the material handling process, it is very challenging to formulate an analytical approximation linking each sensor observation to the <b>grade</b> <b>control</b> model. Instead, an application-specific forward simulator is built, translating <b>grade</b> <b>control</b> realizations into observation realizations. The algorithm utilizes a Kalman filter-based approach to link forward propagated realizations with real process observations to locally improve the <b>grade</b> <b>control</b> model. Differences in the scale of support are automatically dealt with. A literature review, following a detailed problem description, presents an overview of the most recent approaches to solving some of the practical problems identified. The most relevant techniques are integrated and the resulting mathematical framework is outlined. The principles behind the self-learning algorithm are explained.

40|$|Short-term {{scheduling}} {{manages the}} quality and quantity of ore to be processed given operational and access constraints. To deliver the forecasted project performance it needs to track the long-term schedule, which defines the extraction sequence that maximises project value. The effect of grade uncertainty on project performance has been well appreciated in the mining industry. Grade uncertainty has subsequently been modelled with conditional simulation, the outputs of which have been used in stochastic mine planning and optimisation. Generally, the simulated orebody models used in stochastic mine planning and optimisation have been based on the wider spaced exploration data, this while short-term scheduling is very much a factor of local deposit characteristics and geology represented by <b>grade</b> <b>control</b> information. However, <b>grade</b> <b>control</b> data is not yet available by the time short-term scheduling is done. This thesis presents an approach to short-term scheduling containing three components: (I) an approach based on sequential Gaussian co-simulation that allows for the simulation of future <b>grade</b> <b>control</b> data, that is, <b>grade</b> <b>control</b> data not yet available at the time production scheduling is done; (2) a second component based on conditional simulation by successive residuals (CSSR) that can update existing orebody models when new information becomes available. This will be used to update orebody models based on exploration data, which were used in stochastic long-term scheduling and optimisation with the in Step 1 simulated future <b>grade</b> <b>control</b> data; (3) a third component consisting of a stochastic integer programming formulation (SIP) that can take the update orebody models as input an generate an optimised short-term schedule. The first component in this approach to short-term scheduling is the generation of a simulation algorithm that can update already existing orebody models when new information becomes available. Conditional simulation by successive residuals (CSSR) allows for a separation of data influences through the column decomposition of the covariance matrix. The separation makes updating of existing orebody models possible by permitting a recalculation of only those influences that change when new information becomes available. Because only part of the calculations are redone for the update, CSSR offers a more efficient way of regenerating a set of simulations compared to assembling all existing and new information and repeating the entire simulation process. Three different implementations of the CSSR approach are generated and investigated using the Walker Lake data set. Their results are then benchmarked against the sequential Gaussian implementation (SGSIM) of the public domain software GSLIB. The first implementation, named Implementation A, is shown to be only successful in cases of high data density. When data density is low, artefacts occur and variogram reproduction suffers. The second implementation, Implementation B, makes only partial use of the new information available and hence generates updated realisations that do not differ significantly from the pre-update realisations. The third implementation, Implementation C, makes full use of the new information and generates updated realisations that clearly reflect this new knowledge. Reproduction of one and two-point statistics is shown to be excellent. All three approaches simulate clusters of grid nodes simultaneously, which adds computational efficiency. The updating capabilities (outlined above), however, need increased storage requirements compared to methods that do not perform updating. Runtimes for updating using Implementation C are in the order of 40 - 90 % depending on the size of the field and the size of the node clusters. The worst update times occur when large fields are simulated using small node clusters. For large fields, the computational overheads lie on the data search and other operations compared to matrix calculations and the update algorithm offers very little improvement. The second component within the short-term scheduling framework is a methodology for simulating future <b>grade</b> <b>control</b> data, that is, <b>grade</b> <b>control</b> data not yet available. To this end a sequential Gaussian co-simulation approach based on exploration data is used to simulate future <b>grade</b> <b>control</b> information. The distribution and spatial correlation structure of the hture <b>grade</b> <b>control</b> data are derived from past <b>grade</b> <b>control</b> information. Because it is not physically possible to have exploration and <b>grade</b> <b>control</b> information available at the same location, the regular cross variogram cannot be used to infer the cross correlation between exploration and <b>grade</b> <b>control</b> data. Instead the pseudo cross variogram is used, which does not require collocated data for inference. The approach is tested on the Walker Lake data set and subsequently applied at the Sunrise Dam gold mine, WA. It is shown to generate simulated <b>grade</b> <b>control</b> data that display the characteristics, that is, distribution of past <b>grade</b> <b>control</b> information and the auto and cross correlation in Gaussian space. The third component within the short-term scheduling framework is a stochastic integer programming (SIP) formulation that maximises discounted cash flow while minimizing deviations from production targets. It takes as input a set of orebody models and produces a raw schedule hedged against all the input orebody models. The short-term scheduling framework has been applied at the Sunrise Dam gold mine, WA. First, the CSSR approach was used to generate a set of 20 simulated orebody models based on exploration data; next, the sequential Gaussian co-simulation method was applied to simulate future <b>grade</b> <b>control</b> information. Subsequently, the orebody models based on exploration data were updated using the simulated <b>grade</b> <b>control</b> information. The result is two sets of orebody models, one based on exploration data and one displaying local characteristics inherent in <b>grade</b> <b>control</b> information. A comparison of the grade tonnage curves for both sets of models shows that the models based on the simulated <b>grade</b> <b>control</b> information predict more ore compared to the exploration based models. Using both sets of orebody models, risk profiles are derived for the Sunrise Dam mine long-term schedule. Risk profiles generated with the exploration based models and the orebody models displaying <b>grade</b> <b>control</b> characteristics, indicate a shortage of ore compared to the target of 3. 5 Mtpa. The MIK model indicates that it will generate a cumulative NPV of 497 million AU$, while the exploration based orebody models predict an expected cumulative NPV of 368 million AU$ and the orebody models based on <b>grade</b> <b>control</b> information 327 million AU$. Next, the exploration based models are input into the SIP formulations and used to derive the raw long and short-term schedules which are post processed to produce practical, feasible schedules in terms of equipment space and mining width. Both the raw and smoothed schedules fulfil the targets for grade (2 - 7 g/t) and ore production (3. 5 Mtpa) and indicate a mine life of 4 years (2005 - 2008). Because the updated orebody models based on simulated <b>grade</b> <b>control</b> data are better able to define ore and waste, they are used to determine the feasibility of the derived exploration based schedule and are used to derive risk profiles for grade and ore tomes. The updated models indicate that if the exploration based schedules are used to mine the deposit, there is a 100 % probability that the ore production will be higher than the target of 3. 5 Mtpa and that the life of mine can be extended. Next, to define schedules that actually fulfil the set targets of grade (2 - 7 g/t) and ore production (3. 5 Mtpa), the updated orebody models are used as input into the SIP formulation and the raw long and shortterm schedules are derived. These are also post processed to make them practical. The smoothed short-term schedule produces an expected cumulative NPV of 561 million AU$, which is 78 million AU$ (14 %) more than generated by the smoothed exploration based short-term schedule. It also extends the life of mine to 5 years, well into 2009. This incorporation of local orebody information in the form of simulated future <b>grade</b> <b>control</b> data coupled with the use of a SIP formulation that can handle geological uncertainty has resulted in a production schedule that extends the life of mine and increases the total expected NPV to 561 million AU$. Recommendations for further work include adapting the SIP formulation to incorporate the practical aspects of mining such as equipment space, mining width, etc. Also, the CSSR algorithm should be investigated further to speed the updating component up...|$|E
