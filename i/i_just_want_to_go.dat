500|$|Adrien Niyonshuti, {{who at the}} age of 25 {{was taking}} part in his first Olympic Games, was Rwanda's sole {{representative}} in the men's cross-country cycling event, and was notable for carrying his nation's flag at the opening and closing ceremonies. He qualified for the Games based on his performance at the 2011 African Continental Mountain Bike Championship. Niyonshuti said that he was putting his focus towards the event and wanted to impress his family, [...] "To have everyone say they are behind me makes me feel good. When people congratulate me for getting to the Olympics, it gives me a confidence and it tells me that yeah, I did well. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> there and compete and finish the race. To know that so many people are behind me makes me not want to disappoint them." [...] He took part in the 12 August race, finishing 39th out of 40 cyclists, with a time of one hour, 42 minutes and 46 seconds. Niyonshuti ranked behind Russia's Evgeniy Pechenin (one hour, 41 minutes and 40 seconds) Chan Chun Hing of Hong Kong (one hour, 41 minutes and 59 seconds) but in front of last place finisher Marios Athanasiadis from Cyprus (one hour, 43 minutes and 25 seconds).

500|$|Prior to the 2014 NBA draft, Frazier {{worked out}} for several NBA teams, {{including}} the Phoenix Suns, New York Knicks, Boston Celtics, Minnesota Timberwolves, Philadelphia 76ers and Washington Wizards. Philadelphia worked him out two times, and head coach Brett Brown invited him to play for them at the 2014 Las Vegas Summer League within an hour after he was not selected in the draft. The situation was {{compared to that of}} Khalif Wyatt, who played for the 76ers through the 2013 edition of the summer league, and attended Temple University in the Philadelphia area. Frazier said, [...] "When [...] reached out to me and said they wanted me for the summer league, I was ready to go for it. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> out, have fun, play my hardest and show Philly and other teams what they can get from me.". According to the 76ers assistant coach, Chad Iske, he impressed the team's staff by his [...] "poise" [...] and experience at the higher level. At Las Vegas, Frazier averaged 3.4 points, 4.0 rebounds, 2.0 assists and 1.2 steals in five games. On September 29, 2014, the Boston Celtics signed Frazier to a non-guaranteed training camp deal with the likely notion of auditioning with the Maine Red Claws in the future. On October 27, 2014, he was waived by the Celtics after appearing in four preseason games where he went 1-for-2 from the field and recorded two rebounds, four assists and four steals. As expected, four days later, he was acquired by the Maine Red Claws as an affiliate player. Frazier opened his season in the D-League by contributing 18 points, 9 assists, and 4 rebounds against the Oklahoma City Blue. He also shot 12-of-12 on free throws, helping the team win their first game.|$|E

Merullo has addressed these changes saying, [...] "...I've had editors counsel me to write the same book over and over, and some readers who complained that I haven’t kept writing books set in greater Boston.
