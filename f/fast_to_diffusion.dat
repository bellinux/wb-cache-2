The analysis of smoking histories shows that after 1950, when information {{about the dangers of}} tobacco started to diffuse, the prevalence of smoking declined earlier and most dramatically for college graduates. I construct panels based on smoking histories in an attempt to isolate the causal effect of smoking from the influence of time-invariant unobservable characteristics.

Figure 3a shows {{a case where}} dissolution is <b>fast</b> relative <b>to</b> <b>diffusion.</b> The material is carried away from the edge faster than it can diffuse from the center, so the concentration at the edge drops to zero. The material is carried away {{as fast as it}} arrives at the surface, and the extraction is completely diffusion limited. Here the rate of extraction can be increased by increasing diffusion rate, for example raising the temperature, but not by increasing the flow rate of the solvent. Figure 3b shows a case where solubility is low relative <b>to</b> <b>diffusion.</b> The extractant is able to diffuse <b>to</b> the edge <b>faster</b> than it can be carried away by the solvent, and the concentration profile is flat.

40|$|A {{technique}} for investigating reduction kinetics of hair using single hair fibers is described. The method {{is based on}} stress relaxation caused by disulfide bond breakage, {{and can be used}} for fundamental studies of parameters affecting hair reduction rates. Analysis of our data in light of mathematical models indicates that under conditions where reduction is <b>fast</b> compared <b>to</b> <b>diffusion</b> into the hair, the reaction proceeds as a sharp front or moving boundary, and when reaction is slow compared <b>to</b> <b>diffusion,</b> the reaction front is diffuse and pseudo first-order kinetics are followed. We have used the method to investigate he effects of pH, temperature, and reactant concentration with a monothiol reducing agent, sodium thioglycolate (TG), and with two dithiol reducing agents, dithiothreitol (DTT) and sodium dihydrolipoate (6 - 8 dithiooctanoate). The two dithiol reducing agents displayed moving boundary kinetics under all conditions investigated, while SFTK data obtained with TG was characteristic of pseudo first-order kinetics except at pH values of 10 or greater.

40|$|We {{determine}} the liquid-solid phase diagram for carbon-oxygen and oxygen-selenium plasma mixtures using two-phase MD simulations. We identified liquid, solid, and interface regions using a bond angle metric. To study finite size effects, we perform 27648 and 55296 ion simulations. To help monitor non-equilibrium effects, we calculate diffusion constants $D_i$. For the carbon-oxygen system {{we find that}} $D_O$ for oxygen ions in the solid is much smaller than $D_C$ for carbon ions and that both diffusion constants are 80 or more times smaller than diffusion constants in the liquid phase. There is excellent agreement between our carbon-oxygen phase diagram and that predicted by Medin and Cumming. This suggests that errors from finite size and non-equilibrium effects are small and that the carbon-oxygen phase diagram is now accurately known. The oxygen-selenium system is a simple two-component model for more complex rapid proton capture nucleosynthesis ash compositions for an accreting neutron star. Diffusion of oxygen, in a predominately selenium crystal, is remarkably <b>fast,</b> comparable <b>to</b> <b>diffusion</b> in the liquid phase.
