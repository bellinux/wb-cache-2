5|$|To {{accommodate}} new recordings, Meany {{and producer}} Tedd T started an independent label named Teleprompt Records. Their first release was an EP titled Reset in September 2004. Earthsuit alumnus Roy Mitchell joined the venture in 2005. Teleprompt later signed a distribution <b>deal</b> <b>directly</b> <b>with</b> Warner Bros. Records, allowing Mutemath {{to release a}} full-length self-titled album on September 26, 2006.|$|E

He believed {{the company was}} a frontrunner in encryption services and was pleased they offered a 50–50 partnership with the Premier League to exploit PPV. BSkyB's alliance with the BBC also convinced Parry; when he informed Dyke of this, the ITV chairman threatened to do a <b>deal</b> <b>directly</b> <b>with</b> the clubs which angered him.|$|E

5|$|The {{international}} {{reaction to}} this latest turn of events was varied and greatly colored by national interests. The British were unwilling to defend Madagascar's sovereignty for fear that the French might retaliate and fail to recognize the British claim to certain protectorates of its own. All official British engagement with Madagascar was henceforth transacted through the French resident, but these communiques were not officially recognized by Ranavalona and her court. The United States and Germany, on the other hand, continued to <b>deal</b> <b>directly</b> <b>with</b> the queen's government as the rightful authority in Madagascar. This discrepancy forced a reinterpretation of {{one aspect of the}} treaty, resulting in the queen's authority over internal affairs being maintained.|$|E
5|$|Epstein accused Seltaeb of not {{accounting}} properly, and cancelled {{its power}} to grant licences, which started a counter-lawsuit by Byrne against Epstein's New York accountant, Walter Hofer, asking for $5,168,000 in damages. Epstein then instructed NEMS employees to <b>deal</b> <b>directly</b> <b>with</b> American companies, so Byrne instigated court proceedings, which took three years to settle, as it entailed 39 individual claims against NEMS. Byrne won the case, and Epstein paid the court costs and legal bills himself, although the judgement was later vacated; meaning to cancel it, or render it null and void. Due to the legal battle, Woolworth's, J. C. Penney, and other companies refused to finalise any merchandising agreements, cancelling orders worth $78 million. The court case and its effect was estimated to have lost NEMS and The Beatles approximately $100,000,000.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1870s, the Straits Governor, William Jervois {{contemplated}} on placing Maharaja Abu Bakar as the overlord of {{the chiefs}} in Negeri Sembilan after the British failed {{to quell the}} sectarian violence in Sungai Ujong. Abu Bakar's client, Tunku Antah was placed as the Yam Tuan of the Sri Menanti confederacy (comprising several small states within the region), and Abu Bakar was made the adviser of Negeri Sembilan (except Sungai Ujong) in 1878. Abu Bakar was believed to have nursed expansionist ambitions, which was suggested by {{his involvement in the}} Pahang Civil War between 1857 and 1864. A later governor, Frederick Weld, aspired for stronger British control over the Malay states and was weary of Abu Bakar's influence. The chiefs were lukewarm to the prospect of Johor's sphere of influence over Negeri Sembilan, and in 1881 Weld convinced the chiefs within the Sri Menanti confederacy to <b>deal</b> <b>directly</b> <b>with</b> Singapore rather than with Abu Bakar. British officers were also appointed to oversee the affairs in 1883 and 1887, and were gradually given the powers similar to that of a British resident.|$|E

In addition, it also wants to compare the Burnout level between group of departments <b>dealing</b> <b>directly</b> <b>with</b> customers and group of departments do not <b>dealing</b> <b>directly</b> <b>with</b> customers.

Samples are taken from 15 chosen departments in Premier Surabaya Hospital. In the end, 101 samples can be used for the analysis. Multiple Linear Regression is used to analyze the impact of Burnout towards OCB. The result shows that Burnout has a significant negative effect towards OCB.

5|$|The {{success of}} The Quatermass Xperiment came at an opportune time for Hammer. By 1955 {{the deal with}} Robert L. Lippert had expired and the company {{produced}} just one feature film that year, Women Without Men. Many of the independent cinemas that provided the market for Hammer's films in the UK were struggling {{in the face of}} competition from television and faced closure. The Quatermass Xperiment gave Hammer a much needed box office hit and was also the first film to bring the company to the attention of a major film distributor, in this case United Artists. From this point onward, Hammer was increasingly able to <b>deal</b> <b>directly</b> <b>with</b> the major distributors and no longer needed intermediaries like Lippert. This ultimately spelt the end for Exclusive Films, Hammer's own distribution company, which was wound down in the late 1950s.|$|E
5|$|Mulder {{recruits}} The Lone Gunmen to {{help him}} break into a high security research facility where he thinks he {{may be able to}} find more information on how to save Scully. Meanwhile, Skinner tries to <b>deal</b> <b>directly</b> <b>with</b> The Smoking Man for Scully's life, who tells him he will get back to him. Inside the facility, Mulder discovers that Dr. Scanlon works alongside several clones of Kurt Crawford. The clones show him Scully's harvested ova and tell him they are trying to save the abducted women's lives, since they acted as their birth mothers. They also hope to subvert the colonization project as an inside job. Mulder takes Scully's ova and leaves, being pursued by the Gray-Haired Man as he escapes. He returns to the hospital to see Scully, who tells him that Penny has died but that she intends to fight the disease. Afterward, Mulder phones Skinner for letting him know Scully's doing ok and may return to work soon, as well as for thanking him for his advice about not negotiating with the Smoking Man, after which Skinner and the Smoking Man come to terms on their deal in seclusion.|$|E

25|$|Although the Sikh code {{of conduct}} does not <b>deal</b> <b>directly</b> <b>with</b> {{abortion}} (or indeed many other bioethical issues), it is generally forbidden in Sikhism because {{it is said to}} interfere with the creative work of God.

25|$|Elsewhere in the Mediterranean, {{suits are}} {{considered}} impractical without constant air conditioning.

25|$|In {{the setting}} up of creameries the {{cooperative}} movement experienced its greatest success.

25|$|The idea of {{emptiness}} {{as lack of}} inherent existence has {{very little to do}} with what the Buddha himself said about emptiness.

Manstein and Richthofen determined that the limited land forces available made cooperation between land and air forces critical.
