Following the dedication, The Oregonian published: [...] "It takes nothing from its fascination {{to know that a}} human {{on the staff of the}} square will be making the daily phone calls to the Weather Service and the Department of Environmental Quality, and pushing the necessary buttons to cue the pillar's performance...

It might sound very similar to the second one ('Into The Mirror Black').

It's still gonna be that good, I think, and there's gonna be high-pitched screaming. I'm making sure of that. With NEVERMORE, high-pitched screaming was never really called for. You know, with SANCTUARY... of course it is." ...|$|R
500|$|For this reason, Sony {{titled the}} album #1's, as Carey {{felt the need}} to express the album's true content, a {{collection}} of her number one hits. In December 2001, Columbia released the album Greatest Hits, which featured Carey's number one singles alongside songs she said [...] "needed to be really heard," [...] such as [...] "Underneath the Stars" [...] and [...] "Forever." [...] In an interview with MTV, Carey made the following statement regarding the album. [...] "There's a lot of songs that I'm happy are gonna see the light of day. I think people are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>like</b> this Greatest Hits because there are songs on it that were not necessarily singles." ...|$|E
500|$|In a 1995 interview, Guitar World writer Jeff Gilbert {{described}} Vitalogy as [...] "strange" [...] and [...] "very eclectic." [...] McCready agreed, saying, [...] "There is {{some weird}} stuff on there." [...] McCready attributed the album's sound {{to the group}} recording it on tour. During this period Vedder began to contribute in a large capacity as a guitarist. Gossard said, [...] "Vitalogy {{is the first one}} where Ed plays guitar and he wrote three to four songs. I remember thinking, 'This is so different. Is anyone <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>like</b> this?'...It had a more punk feel to it. Simple songs recorded really quickly." [...] The album has a notable lack of guitar solos compared with the band's first two albums. McCready said, [...] "Vitalogy is not really a 'solo' album. I don't think the songs demanded solos; {{it was more of a}} rhythmic album." ...|$|E
500|$|Ta's {{blind date}} {{proves to be}} the {{thoroughly}} Americanized Linda Low, who we will learn is Sammy Fong's girlfriend and a stripper at his club. [...] On the date with Ta ("I Enjoy Being a Girl"), Linda lies to Ta about her career and family. [...] Ta, knowing that Chinese-Americans with college degrees {{find it hard to}} get a job befitting their education, plans to go to law school, postponing the likely career struggle by three years. [...] The impetuous Ta asks Linda to marry him. [...] She agrees, but she needs family consent and lies, saying that she has a brother who will approve the marriage. [...] Ta returns home and meets Mei Li, who is immediately attracted to him ("I Am <b>Going</b> <b>to</b> <b>Like</b> It Here"), though Ta is unimpressed. [...] That changes when Ta sees her in a Western dress ("Like a God").|$|E

500|$|On {{arrival in}} the United States, Mei-li goes to the Golden Pearl Theatre in San Francisco's Chinatown, where little-attended Chinese opera is {{presented}} by her father's old friend Wang Chi-yang and Wang's foster brother Chin. [...] One night a week, Wang's son Ta turns the theater into a nightclub, starring the very assimilated Linda Low, a Chinese-American stripper from Seattle. [...] Linda's constant companion is a gay costume designer, Harvard (so named by his success-obsessed Chinese parents). [...] The nightclub is profitable; the Chinese opera is not. [...] Mei-li joins the opera company ("I Am <b>Going</b> <b>to</b> <b>Like</b> It Here") and is soon attracted to the indifferent Ta, who favors Linda. [...] Mei-li is fascinated by Linda, who urges her to adopt the American lifestyle ("I Enjoy Being a Girl"). [...] Linda is soon signed by talent agent Rita Liang, who pushes Wang to turn the theater into a club full-time ("Grant Avenue"), and he reluctantly opens Club Chop Suey.|$|E
500|$|Rodgers and Hammerstein {{sought to}} give the new work an Eastern flavor, without using {{existing}} oriental music. [...] According to Ben Brantley in his review of the 2002 Broadway revival, the use by Rodgers [...] "of repetitive Eastern musical structures gives the numbers a sing-song catchiness that, for better or worse, exerts a sticky hold on the memory." [...] The most oriental-sounding song in the work is [...] "A Hundred Million Miracles", which provides the eight-note drumbeat which is the musical signature of the work from overture to curtain. [...] Hammerstein wrote Mei Li's first act song, [...] "I Am <b>Going</b> <b>to</b> <b>Like</b> It Here", in a Malaysian poetic form called pantoum in which the second and fourth lines of each stanza become {{the first and third}} lines of the next. [...] One critic thought that the 2001 version's orchestrations [...] "boast more Asian accents and a jazzier edge than the original", but another felt that they [...] "pale in comparison" [...] to Bennett's typically lilting sound.|$|E
500|$|SFX {{magazine}} reviewer Russell Lewin gave [...] "The Doctor's Wife" [...] {{four and}} a half out of five stars, labelling it as [...] "non-stop intrigue and controlled suspense all the way". He particularly praised Smith's energetic performance, saying [...] "he pings and fizzes around the screen like a Technicolor firework, lighting up every scene he adorns". IGN's Matt Risley rated the episode 9 out of 10 and concluded, [...] "Sweet, touching, intelligent, different, utterly imaginative and accessible by both hardcore fans and newbies alike— this is not only Doctor Who, but sci-fi telly at its finest". He also praised Gaiman's script for being [...] "a simple idea executed brilliantly". Patrick Mulkern of Radio Times admitted he was unsure if he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>like</b> it with the [...] "grungy setting, wacko characters and peculiar dialogue", but ended up [...] "captivated". He particularly enjoyed seeing more of the TARDIS' interior and called it an [...] "instant oddball classic".|$|E

500|$|Several of the {{characters}} are given [...] "I am" [...] songs that introduce them to the audience, allowing the character to express his dreams or desires and for onlookers to establish empathy with the character. [...] Linda Low, for example, expresses her self-confidence with [...] "I Enjoy Being a Girl"; we learn Mei Li's hopes with the quieter [...] "I Am <b>Going</b> <b>to</b> <b>Like</b> It Here". [...] Although not a formal musical number, the brief [...] "You Be the Rock, I'll Be the Roll", sung and danced by Linda and by Wang San, Ta's Americanized teenage brother, was described by Lewis as [...] "virtually the first self-consciously rock and roll ditty ever sung" [...] in a Broadway musical. [...] Patrick Adiarte, who originated the role of Wang San, however, saw it as [...] "corny stuff... put in there to get a laugh". [...] Helen Chao's sad [...] "Love, Look Away" [...] is described by Lewis as [...] "arguably the most tautly crafted blues song Dick and Oscar ever wrote".|$|E

[...] 1UP.com's top 50 most anticipated games of E3 2010 ranked Lords of Shadow at number 17. Despite the heavy anticipation, Cox noted {{there was still a}} small number of fans who did not like the game's transition to the 3D format. He stated, [...] "Fair enough, some people aren't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>like</b> what we're doing and we accept that but generally what we're trying to do is bring the fans with us ... there's no point in going back and making the same game again – the point is to make a clean break and move forward with the series." ...|$|E
500|$|For this reason, Sony {{titled the}} album #1's, as Carey {{felt the need}} to express the album's true content, a {{collection}} of her number one hits.

In the album's liner notes, Carey wrote that she was releasing a collection of her number one singles as a [...] "thank you" [...] and a tribute to her fans, and explained that someday she would release a true greatest hits album containing songs that were not released as singles, as well as singles that did not reach number one.

500|$|Following the {{unexpected}} {{success of their}} first album, there was tremendous demand for new music from Casting Crowns. Although lead vocalist Mark Hall, who either wrote or co-wrote all the songs on the album, felt [...] "a little worried" [...] about the band's follow-up album, fellow recording artists Steven Curtis Chapman (who co-produced the band's first album) and Mac Powell of Christian rock band Third Day encouraged Hall to [...] "say what God wants you to say". They also advised him to not worry about commercial expectations or whether [...] "people are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>like</b> it". Ultimately, Hall [...] "absorbed" [...] the feedback their first record had received, using it as inspiration.

500|$|Michael Sragow of Baltimore Sun {{described}} the only [...] "perfect aspect" [...] of Jennifer's Body as being its title. [...] "No one is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>like</b> this movie for its brain", he said. Claudia Puig of USA Today stated of the film, [...] "Jennifer's Body {{is not as}} hot as you hope it would be". Where others praised the film's dialogue, MSNBC's Alonso Duralde called the writing lazy and [...] "orse still, all of Cody's trademark pop-culture–infused dialogue stands out as artificial and precious". Jennifer's Body, he said, wants [...] "so badly" [...] to be a Heathers-esque dark comedy, [...] "but its shortcomings makes you appreciate why that earlier film was so great". Ty Burr of The Boston Globe also said the film wants to be like Heathers, and reminded him [...] "a lot" [...] of Heathers but the only scene in the film that [...] "actually feels dangerous" [...] is when the possessed Jennifer initiates a long and passionate kiss with Needy, which the film [...] "very, very nervously backs away from" [...] and that [...] "Jennifer's Body falls into the dispiriting category of dumb movies made by smart people, {{in this case a}} glibly clever writer and a talented director who think a few wisecracks are enough to subvert the teen horror genre".|$|E
500|$|On September 27, 2012, Big Sean {{announced}} his second studio album {{with the title}} Hall of Fame: Memoirs of a Detroit Player, and then has announced a release date for December 2012. Sean explains why chose {{this to be the}} title, stating that [...] "its because it'll represent who he is". He then said that he feels [...] "like situations are really going to be relatable to people."

Some people are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>like</b> it. Some people are going to hate it; regardless, I'm just doing me." [...] Sean then said that Hall of Fame will be a far more inspirational and a more conceptually-driven project than his debut album. He even went on by saying the fact that he wants to teach, while making his lasting impact on peoples' lives with this second album. During an interview with Power 105, Sean stated that he would include some skits on the album to give it a [...] "classic feel". He even indicated that the song [...] "Mula" [...] featuring French Montana (which also this track was included on the mixtape Detroit), could be featuring as the track for his deluxe edition.|$|E

500|$|Musically, [...] "All In My Head (Flex)" [...] fuses reggae and pop with trap music. The song {{is three}} minutes and thirty-seconds {{in length and}} samples the song [...] "Flex" [...] by Jamaican DJ Mad Cobra which itself {{interpolated}} elements of The Temptations' [...] "Just My Imagination". Its instrumentation consists of guitar, percussion, synthesized finger snaps and synths creating an electronic-reggae beat. The song opens with Hansen singing the chorus featuring guitar chords and crisp clicks. Following the rap performed by Fetty Wap, Ally Brooke belts out [...] the first verse: [...] "Curtains like waves closing in all around us, dimming the lights just so that they don't blind us," [...] backed by the percussion and guitar chords. Concerning his collaboration on [...] "All in My Head (Flex)", Fetty Wap told Billboard that during the recording, his voice [...] "wasn't as mature as it is now." [...] And described as [...] "impossible" [...] to performed the song on stage. [...] "Like, I smoke way too much now. No more high-range. If you were actually to hear the first version to that song, I do not sound anything like that. It was way high up there.

Jason Hughes of The Huffington Post called the reveal a [...] "huge" [...] and [...] "shocking" [...] moment. Tedder called the reveal [...] "something that we've never seen before on The Office." [...] He admitted that, [...] "the last five minutes of this episode genuinely startled me, which is an impressive feat for a series on its ninth and final season." [...] Porter called the shots with Brian [...] "good" [...] because it reaffirmed that the camera crew was a character, {{one that had been}} {{an integral part of the}} show. Wilcox wrote that Brian's appearance was a [...] "weird turn", and that it was [...] "kind of funny" [...] that the first time a member of the camera crew intervened with the characters was when Pam needed comforting and not [...] "one of Dwight or Michael's dozens of near-death experiences." [...] Poniewozik enjoyed the reveal of the documentary crew. However, he wrote that, [...] "I don't know if I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>like</b> the idea of making Brian an actual player in the events, if indeed that's where the show is going." [...] Adams, on the other hand, said that the reveal of the cameramen was [...] "a Big Moment for The Office, but it has a hollow ring to it" [...] because the cameramen had never before interacted with the members of the office before. Campbell wrote that [...] "the show played its documentary crew trump card WAY [...] too early" [...] and noted that the crew had never intervened in past events that were on the same level as Pam crying.|$|E
