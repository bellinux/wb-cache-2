2500|$|Normally, Hagen-Poiseuille flow implies {{not just}} the {{relation}} for the pressure drop, above, but also the full solution for the laminar flow profile, which is parabolic. However, the result for the pressure drop can be extended to turbulent flow by inferring an effective turbulent viscosity {{in the case of}} turbulent flow, even though the flow profile in turbulent flow is strictly speaking not actually parabolic. In both cases, laminar or turbulent, the pressure drop is related to the stress at the wall, which determines the so-called <b>friction</b> <b>factor.</b> The wall stress can be determined phenomenologically by the Darcy–Weisbach equation in the field of hydraulics, given a relationship for the <b>friction</b> <b>factor</b> in terms of the Reynolds number.

40|$|This {{paper is}} the fourth in a series on <b>friction</b> <b>factors</b> for {{sprinkler}} laterals. The widely used <b>friction</b> correction <b>factor</b> F was developed by Christiansen for the hydraulic analysis of sprinkler laterals. A significant modification to this factor was the adjusted <b>friction</b> correction <b>factor</b> Fa. The adjusted <b>friction</b> correction <b>factor</b> can be used when the first sprinkler is {{a fraction of a}} full spacing from the lateral inlet. To design laterals with outlets and outflow at the downstream end, <b>friction</b> correction <b>factor</b> G was developed with the corresponding adjusted <b>friction</b> correction <b>factor</b> Ga. To calculate the average pressure head along a lateral, the average correction factors FAVG and GAVG were developed. These average correction factors can be used where <b>friction</b> correction <b>factors</b> F and G are used to analyze a lateral.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{study was conducted}} to determine the lower and upper Reynolds number limits of the transitional flow regime, and the characteristics of the heat transfer coefficients and <b>friction</b> <b>factors</b> for annular passages with different hydraulic diameters and diameter ratios in the transitional flow regime. Water was used in this investigation during isothermal, heating and cooling cases. Four horizontal concentric counter-flow tube-in-tube heat exchangers with conventional inlet geometries were considered to obtain the required data. The flow was both hydrodynamic and thermally developing, and the transitional flow was composed of mixed and forced convection types. The wall temperature on the inner surface of the annular passages was approximately uniform, while the outer surface was isothermal. Average Nusselt numbers were obtained for both the heating and cooling cases, while <b>friction</b> <b>factors</b> were obtained for heating, cooling and isothermal adiabatic conditions. Isothermal adiabatic condition was considered for reference purposes. The geometric size of the annular passage and direction of the heat flux (heating and cooling cases of annular fluid) had a significant influence on the heat transfer coefficients, <b>friction</b> <b>factors</b> and Reynolds number span of the transitional flow regime. The annular geometric parameters that represent the geometric size of the annular passage were proposed and found to describe the heat transfer coefficient and <b>friction</b> <b>factors</b> well. Subsequently, correlations for predicting the Nusselt numbers and <b>friction</b> <b>factors</b> in the transitional flow regime were developed. [URL] and Aeronautical Engineerin...|$|R

Hagenbach was the first who called this law the Poiseuille's law.|$|E

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation of}} heat transfer and {{pressure drop in}} rectangular micro-channels was conducted for water in the laminar and transitional regimes for three different inlet configurations. The inlet types under consideration were the sudden contraction, bellmouth, and swirl inlet types, and hydraulic diameters of 0. 57 mm, 0. 85 mm, and 1. 05 mm were covered.

For the sudden contraction inlet type, which were investigated for both adiabatic, as well as diabatic cases, adiabatic <b>friction</b> <b>factors</b> were predicted well by the laminar Shah and London correlation, while diabatic <b>friction</b> <b>factors</b> were decreased with an increase in wall heat flux. The sudden contraction inlet critical Reynolds numbers were found to be between 1 800 and 2 000 for adiabatic cases, while for diabatic cases the transition regime commenced at a Reynolds number of about 2 000. The bellmouth and swirl inlet types were investigated for diabatic cases only with swirl inlet tests limited to the 1. 05 mm channel.

Nusselt numbers and <b>friction</b> <b>factors</b> also increase with the Reynolds number, and the slopes of their representative curves increase above a critical value of the Reynolds number because of the onset of time-periodic flow oscillations.

40|$|An {{experimental}} study of friction and heat transfer characteristics for single-phase flow in microchannel condenser tubes was conducted. Data were collected for the adiabatic flow of nitrogen, and also for the diabatic flow of single-phase R 134 a w. ith air in cross-flow. The nitrogen data were analyzed to obtain <b>friction</b> <b>factors</b> in the Reynolds number range of 500 - 20000, and the R 134 a data were analyzed to obtain Nusselt numbers in the Reynolds number ranges of 1000 - 7000 and 10000 - 70000. Several types of microchannel tubes were considered, including those with circular, square, enhanced square, and equilateral triangular ports. For each tube geometry, <b>friction</b> <b>factors</b> in the laminar regime follow the known analytical solution, but the critical Reynolds numbers for the noncircular tubes are all smaller than the value of 2100 found for the circular-port tube. In the turbulent regime, microchannel tube <b>friction.</b> <b>factors</b> follow a correlation for smooth tubes given by Churchill. Accordingly, {{there is no evidence}} of surface roughness or small length scale effects. Finally, Nusselt numbers in the range of 10000 - 70000, obtained from superheated vapor data, are within 10 % of the correlation given by Gnielinski.
