40|$|The Action Plan on visas adopted {{during the}} recent EU-Ukraine summit is a success for Ukraine. It {{is the first time}} that Kyiv has succeeded in obtaining a {{definition}} of the conditions and criteria whose fulfilment will enable Ukraine to apply for the lifting of EU visas for its citizens. Ukraine's strong point has been its political will; the lifting of this visa regime has been a priority for all Ukrainian governments since 2005. Since Viktor Yanukovych became president, Ukraine has adopted or prepared key legal acts that brought it nearer to European standards in the area of border and migration management. One of Kyiv's strengths is also its relatively well reformed and efficiently managed border service. Moreover, illegal transit migration via Ukraine is decreasing, and fewer Ukrainians are trying to enter or stay in the EU illegally. Also, Kyiv has efficiently implemented the EU-Ukraine readmission agreement. The hardest task for Ukraine will be to meet the EU’s expectations concerning values, the condition of Ukrainian democracy, and the rule of law. Corruption remains the main barrier to Ukraine's development and modernisation; the courts are weak and the judicial system inefficient. The main undertaking of the new migration service that is being formed at the moment will be to create a civil system of registration, monitoring and regulating the stays of foreign nationals. This may prove difficult, as the supervisory authority (the Ministry of the Interior) remains an unreformed, police-type bureaucratic institution. Ukraine is lagging behind countries such as Russia, Belarus and Moldova when it comes to the introduction of biometric documents. Another problem is the lack of an electronic information system on foreign nationals, visas and border crossings which would be accessible to all the relevant services and institutions. For these reasons, the complete abolition of visas seems to be a longterm perspective, especially considering that many EU countries, which themselves are faced with the problem of migrants’ integration, are rather sceptical about the further liberalisation of movement of people with their eastern neighbours. In the immediate future, if Ukraine meets some of the requirements set by the EU, it will be able to seek the <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>visa</b> facilitations that have been in operation since 2008...|$|E

5000|$|JEWCOM {{officials}} knew <b>the</b> gravity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> situation, {{and turned}} to Setsuzo Kotsuji, a bible scholar and Japanese [...] "Jewish expert". Kotsuji was a friend <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Jews, and personally appealed to foreign minister Yosuke Matsuoka on behalf <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Jews <b>of</b> Kobe. A conclusion was reached that the central government would ignore the forged and expired <b>visas</b> if <b>the</b> local Kobe police would accept such a decision and let their city welcome thousands of refugees. Kotsuji then obtained 300,000 yen, no small amount, to bribe the Kobe police {{and get them to}} approve <b>the</b> <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Polish <b>visas.</b> [...] Thus, <b>the</b> first major hurdle in <b>the</b> Jews <b>of</b> Kobe surviving <b>the</b> Holocaust was surmounted.|$|R
50|$|Heehs {{was briefly}} in the news in April 2012 after the Indian home {{ministry}} declined to entertain an application for <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> his resident visa after April 15. Learning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> affair on March 31, Union Home Minister P. Chidambaram said he would review Heehs’s case. A number of prominent scholars, as well as union minister for Rural Development Jairam Ramesh, wrote in support <b>of</b> Heehs to <b>the</b> home minister and to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. Leading public intellectuals Ramachandra Guha and Pratap Bhanu Mehta wrote about the issue in their newspaper columns. On April 13, the home ministry announced that it had approved a one-year <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> Heehs’s <b>visa.</b> <b>The</b> affair became a point of reference in discussions in the Indian and international press of freedom of expression, book banning, censorship, xenophobia, and visa policy.|$|R
40|$|In {{the recent}} decade, the Polish efforts seeking <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> U. S. <b>Visa</b> Waiver Program to Poland {{have been one}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> major themes in U. S. -Polish {{relations}} and an important issue for the Polish public opinion. Polish politicians and media have often presented {{it in terms of}} American “ingratitude” for Polish support for U. S. positions like the Iraq war and the Ballistic Missile Defense program. This article, after brief outline <b>of</b> <b>the</b> provisions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> U. S. law governing <b>visas</b> and <b>the</b> <b>Visa</b> Waiver Program, presents a historical account <b>of</b> <b>the</b> issue and its role in bilateral relations since 1989, and describes legislative responses to Polish requests that have been introduced in Congress. After <b>the</b> analysis <b>of</b> those measures, <b>the</b> article concludes that <b>the</b> failure <b>of</b> Polish efforts for Poland’s inclusion in <b>the</b> <b>Visa</b> Waiver Program was caused primarily by mistaken strategy (overemphasis being put on conventional diplomacy over congressional lobbying), congressional reluctance to single out individual countries for exemption from generally applicable rules, and post - 9 / 11 political climate, unfavorable to easing of immigration rules.
