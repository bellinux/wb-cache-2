50|$|Relics of this branch survive today, {{though it}} should be {{emphasised}} that as time progresses, remnants of old railways deteriorate {{and in some cases}} disappear entirely, so what was previously evident may no longer exist. Bridges sans rails are believed to still exist {{in the early stages of}} the line, notably including a truss bridge across the Pomahaka River. In Tapanui, the railway station is preserved, the goods shed still stands, and rails remain embedded in Station Street where the railway crossing used to be. Flooding almost entirely destroyed Kelso and it is now abandoned, though the railway's goods shed still exists. On lower ground is the ruins of the town's former service station, with sombre viewing created by <b>flood</b> <b>levels</b> <b>marked</b> on the doors. Until recently, a goods shed also stood in Heriot, but it is understood that this structure was removed in the late 1990s.|$|R

40|$|A {{contour map}} of annual maximum <b>flood</b> <b>levels</b> for the 100 -year average {{recurrence}} interval (ARI) flood is constructed. <b>Flood</b> <b>levels</b> in Bangladesh {{are affected by}} many factors, which give rise to considerable joint probability problems when estimating extreme events. These problems are solved by generating contours of <b>flood</b> <b>levels</b> for particular exceedance probabilities using the time series of historical annual maximum water-level data. Water-level data from 266 stations are analysed. A total of 131 out of the 266 stations examined is stationary and independent. The average length of the data samples is 29 years. The Generalized Extreme Value distribution is adopted to develop the <b>flood</b> <b>level</b> probability map, because it provides the best fit against the annual maximum water-level data at different stations. At most of the gauging sites the Generalized Extreme Value distribution indicates {{the presence of an}} upper bound in the extreme <b>flood</b> <b>levels...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstractâ€”This paper {{presents}} an alternate approach that uses {{artificial neural network}} to simulate the <b>flood</b> <b>level</b> dynamics in a river basin. The algorithm was developed in a decision support system environment in order to enable users to process the data. The decision support system {{is found to be}} useful due to its interactive nature, flexibility in approach and evolving graphical feature and can be adopted for any similar situation to predict the <b>flood</b> <b>level.</b> The main data processing includes the gauging station selection, input generation, lead-time selection/generation, and length of prediction. This program enables users to process the <b>flood</b> <b>level</b> data, to train/test the model using various inputs and to visualize results. The program code consists of a set of files, which can as well be modified to match other purposes. This program may also serve as a tool for real-time flood monitoring and process control. The running results indicate that the decision support system applied to the <b>flood</b> <b>level</b> seems to have reached encouraging results for the river basin under examination. The comparison of the model predictions with the observed data was satisfactory, where the model is able to forecast the <b>flood</b> <b>level</b> up to 5 hours in advance with reasonable prediction accuracy. Finally, this program may also serve as a tool for real-time flood monitoring and process control...|$|R

50|$|In 1938, the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) began {{construction}} of Kentucky Dam on the Tennessee River. Impounding the river meant that flood waters would consume {{a large part}} of the community, so in 1940, TVA began buying out property and moving all families out of the area. Buildings below the <b>flood</b> <b>level</b> were given to their prior owners and buildings above the <b>flood</b> <b>level</b> were auctioned off. All buildings had to be moved out by a certain date after which TVA burned what remained. Timber below the <b>flood</b> <b>level</b> was cut and burned on a tight schedule, preventing much of its use to sawmillers. Cemeteries that would be flooded or whose access would be flooded were surveyed, next of kin contacted, and decisions made on removal and relocation or remaining in place.|$|R
