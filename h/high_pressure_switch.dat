40|$|A solvent {{delivery}} system is described {{that is designed}} to increase the efficiency of liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS) analyses. Gradients formed by using two low pressure syringe pumps are stored in a length of narrow bore tubing (gradient loop) mounted on a standard <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>switching</b> valve. The preformed gradient is pushed through the column by using a <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> syringe pump. The system is fully automated and can be controlled with either a personal computer or the mass spectrometer data system. Advantages include gradient operation without the use of split flows, pressure programed flow control for rapid sample loading and recycling to initial conditions, and a flow rate range of 0. 1 – 20 μL/min, which is suitable for packed capillary columns 50 – 500 μm in diameter. The system has been used extensively for rapid molecular weight determinations of intact protein samples, as well as LC/MS and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analyses of complex peptide mixtures...|$|R

40|$|Milk is a {{rich source}} of {{bioactive}} peptides with several healthy properties. These compounds are released after proteolytic processes that occour in milk after expiration date. This matrix is highly complex and, in order to obtain good separation before the mass spectrometer source and prevent competition for ionization, high peak capacity is essential. A two-dimensional comprehensive LC × UHPLC platform was developed for the separation of peptides after IV week from the expiration date. In this approach we evaluated the employment in the second dimension (D 2), of both sub- 2 um partially (core-shell) and totally (monodisperse) porous particles columns. High peak capacity values, with respect to a conventional monodimensional approach, were obtained. A ten port-two position <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>switching</b> valve was used for the online continuous transfer between first and second dimension, on the detection side, both diode array detector (DAD) and a hybrid ion trap-time of flight (IT-TOF) mass spectrometer were employed in series. This platform represents a powerful tool for the identification and profiling of milk peptides, and allows to promote this “waste product” as an important source of bioactive compounds for the development of nutraceutical products and functional milks...|$|R

50|$|The {{floors of}} Keely's {{workshop}} were taken {{up and a}} brick wall was removed. Inside the wall they found mechanical belts linked to a silent water motor two floors below the laboratory. In the basement there was a three-ton sphere of compressed air that ran the machines through hidden <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> tubes and <b>switches.</b> The walls, ceilings and even solid beams {{were found to have}} concealed tubes. Journalists documented everything photographically to leave no room for doubt. Hering and Goodspeed were of the opinion that the tubing and the large steel sphere in the basement indicated the use of normal forces and possible deception, and Hering said in his signed statement that Keely had probably lied and deceived, and was satisfied that he had used highly compressed air to power his demonstrations.|$|R
40|$|Groundwater {{remediation}} {{efforts are}} currently ongoing at the Test Area North (TAN) {{located at the}} Idaho Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL). These efforts are primarily directed towards the Technical Support Facility- 05 (TSF- 05) {{for the removal of}} volatile organic compounds (VOC`s). The Groundwater Treatment Facility (GWTF), positioned near the TSF- 05 injection well at TAN, was installed in 1994 to pump and treat the injection well groundwater. The GWTF was designed to be operated continuously at 50 gpm. Presently the GWTF operates in batch mode attributed to {sup 137 }`Cs found at higher concentrations than expected. This presence of {sup 137 }Cs, along with the higher than expected concentration of suspended solids revealed a need for further testing and evaluation of the GWTF process. Two independent experiments were conducted at the GWTF with actual groundwater pumped from TSF- 25 and TSF- 05 injection wells. One experiment used the 3 M Company`s web technology to remove Cs from the actual groundwater, while the second experiment contained a duplicate set of ion exchange columns in series. Each set having two columns, one to remove Cs, the other to remove Sr from the actual groundwater. A total of 5 Cs or Sr specific sorbents were tested in the column setups. A total of eight batches of water were processed through the GWTF with the experimental setups in place, six from TSF- 25 and two from TSF- 05. Downtime occasionally occurred when <b>high</b> differential <b>pressures</b> prompted the <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> shutoff <b>switches</b> to shut down the 3 M experiment feed pump. A pre-filter change out was initiated when this occurred. Also, experimental setups were shut down for GWTF backwash and discharge operations...|$|R

40|$|A novel {{technique}} {{has been developed}} for the synthesis of homogeneous, weakly agglomerated highly filterable Pb(Zr, Ti) O{sub 3 } (PZT) powders. PZT 95 / 5 based ceramics were fabricated from these powders to determine interrelationships among microstructure, dielectric properties and pressure induced ferroelectric (FE) to antiferroelectric (AFE) phase transitions. Initial measurements indicate that microstructure has a substantial effect on hydrostatic depoling characteristics. While smaller grain size materials and <b>higher</b> <b>switching</b> <b>pressures,</b> subtleties in microstructure, which may include entrapped porosity, resulted in a more diffuse depoling characteristic. In addition, greater than 90 % dense materials were obtained at process temperatures as low at 900 {degrees}C. were only 30 % {{of the values of}} PZT 95 / 5 fired at 1300 {degrees}C, the dielectric constants of the 900 {degrees}C materials were almost a factor of two higher.

40|$|We present {{transmission}} {{electron microscopy}} observations of domain wall motion in thin freestanding KNbO 3 crystals under applied electric fields. Since there is no substrate, there is no elastic clamping of 90 ◦ domains. We observe that curved and tilted 90 ◦ domain walls are the most mobile, whereas untilted 90 ◦ domain walls are resistant to field-induced motion. We explain this result in terms of two factors. First, the <b>switching</b> <b>pressure</b> on a domain wall (P 2 −P 1) ·E {{is determined by the}} relative electrostatic energies of the neighboring polarizations P 1 and P 2. Consequently, some 90 ◦ domain walls are immobile under certain field directions, leading to domain interlocking. Second, domain walls experiencing a <b>high</b> <b>switching</b> <b>pressure</b> move by a ripple mechanism, and do not move as rigid sheets. The tilted wall region in such a ripple has a polarization charge, and an associated depolarization field, which reduces the local switching barrier. An accumulation of polarization charge can result in a tilted or curved wall, as occurs at the mobile tips of 90 ◦ domain needles. Any increase in density of immobile wall configurations with cycle time represents an inherent contribution to fatigue. Uniaxial ferroelectrics, with polarizations parallel to the field, should not experience such domain interlocking. 1 I...|$|R

40|$|At the {{gas spring}} {{manufacturing}} company Strömsholmen AB {{there is the}} needfor {{a way to make}} the load alleviating gas springs more robust, endurable andmaintenance free. A small <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> compressor with a control systemshould solve these problems. The system would have to raise the pressure in the gas spring if it were to drop under a level and let some pressure out if it were to increase over a certain level. The construction of this Micro Compressor system is presented in this master's thesis. At first, {{a deeper understanding of the}} task at hand was gathered resulting in a design specification, followed by a concept study generated by the systematic design method. The evaluation of the concept study resulted in a chosen concept for prototype production. This prototype system consists of a control system with a <b>pressure</b> <b>switch,</b> a <b>pressure</b> reducing valve and a Micro Compressor that raises the pressure when needed.
