5|$|In an {{interview}} in December 2011, Google executive chairman Eric Schmidt announced that a Google-designed tablet computer would arrive in six months. <b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>interview</b> for Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera, Schmidt stated that the software company would have strong competition against Apple, the designer of the iPad line of tablets. While he did not {{refer to it as}} such, the device was inferred {{to be part of the}} Google Nexus series of consumer devices using the Android operating system and built by a partnering original equipment manufacturer (OEM).|$|E
30|$|In the {{following}} section, remarks and thoughts are discussed on some areas {{identified in the}} literature review and <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>interviews.</b> <b>The</b> issues raised <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>interviews</b> are dependent upon the interviewees and the choice of building. The results from <b>the</b> <b>interviews,</b> however, have been generalized to be applicable to multifunctional buildings in general. <b>The</b> <b>interviews</b> {{in combination with the}} literature review helped to make sure that important issues are identified and that the risk of excluding important issues is minimized. In the next section a summary of identified problems is given.|$|R

50|$|In {{order to}} help reduce stress and trauma to the child, some {{studies have shown that}} good social support <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>interviewing</b> process can help {{children}} reduce their anxiety. If an interviewer is supportive by smiling, nodding his head and compliments <b>the</b> child <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>interviewing</b> process <b>the</b> child's anxiety decreased by a decent margin. The study also showed that the less supportive an interviewer was, the higher the child's anxiety rose.|$|R
5|$|In late December 2006, the Chicago Tribune {{reported}} that the developer was soliciting opinions on a further revision from community leaders.

Further, information on the patient's insight, judgment, and capacity for abstract reasoning is used to inform decisions about treatment strategy and the choice of an appropriate treatment setting.|$|E
5|$|Lyons' admissions {{during the}} first {{interview}} were not very detailed, {{and many of the}} details provided did not match the evidence. Lyons gave incorrect information about the precise location of the killings and about the number of weapons used. <b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>interview,</b> he was confused about {{the number of people that}} had been killed, and he thought that the women were awake, and moving about the house at the time, which conflicted with the forensic evidence.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Jenna {{gets into}} trouble after she is misquoted in Maxim magazine, {{allegedly}} {{saying that she}} hates the troops. This happened due to Jenna mishearing the interviewer and thinking he meant theater troupes. The resulting outrage prompts Jack to get her an interview on Hardball with Chris Matthews to clear up the confusion over her comments. <b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>interview,</b> Jenna confuses Osama bin Laden and then-Senator Barack Obama, who was running for the Democratic Party nomination for President. A further attempt to clear Jenna's name backfires when swastikas are accidentally brandished on the TGS with Tracy Jordan stage.|$|E

5|$|Before {{the tournament}} in Poland and Ukraine, Balotelli {{was interviewed by}} a {{newspaper}} about racism amongst fans in the host countries. <b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>interview,</b> Balotelli reiterated his threat to walk off the pitch {{if any of the}} opposition fans racially abused him in any way, and said that he would 'kill' anyone that threw a banana at him. He spoke about his increasing fears that black players would be targeted by racists and that he refused to accept racism in any form, talking of his past experience of racism in football notably during his time playing in Serie A for Inter Milan. During the build-up to the competition Manchester City's manager Roberto Mancini had repeatedly defended Balotelli, but he and footballer Daniele De Rossi believed that Mario would need to grow up and mature {{if he was going to}} become the centrepiece of future Italian success.|$|E

5|$|In 1971, Detectives Toschi, Armstrong, and Mulanax {{question}} Arthur Leigh Allen, {{a suspect}} in the Vallejo case. Allen behaves suspiciously <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>interview.</b> They ask to see his watch and notice that he wears a Zodiac brand wristwatch which has the same logo used by the killer. However, a handwriting expert insists that Allen did not write the Zodiac letters, even though Allen is said to be ambidextrous. Avery receives a letter threatening his life; becoming increasingly paranoid, he turns to drugs and alcohol. At one point, he shares information with the Riverside Police Department, angering both Toschi and Armstrong. The case's notoriety weighs on Toschi, who is bothered when Graysmith shows up at the theater where Toschi is watching a Hollywood film, Dirty Harry, loosely based on the Zodiac case, with his wife.|$|E
5|$|The {{respondent}} Michael Alvarado {{agreed to}} help his friend Paul Soto steal a truck {{in the parking lot}} of a shopping mall in Santa Fe Springs, California. Soto pulled out a gun and approached the driver of the truck, demanding the keys, while Alvarado hid by the driver's side door. The driver refused and was shot and killed by Soto. Afterwords, Alvarado helped hide the gun. Los Angeles County Sheriff's detective Cheryl Comstock led the investigation of the crime. During the investigation Comstock contacted Alvarado's parents, saying that she wished to speak with Alvarado. Alvarado's parents brought him to the police station to be interviewed. Comstock brought Alvarado into an interview room and questioned him for two hours. Alvarado's parents asked to be present <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>interview</b> but were not allowed in by police. Alvarado admitted during questions that he had helped his friend try to steal the truck and that he had helped hide the gun.|$|E
5|$|Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy {{wrote the}} {{majority}} opinion for the Court, which declined to overturn the state court's decision because fair-minded jurists could disagree over whether Alvarado was in custody. Kennedy noted that there were facts for and against the claim that Alvarado was in custody. Facts pointing towards custody included that the interview took place at a police station, the interview lasted for two hours, Alvarado was not told {{he was free to}} leave, and Alvarado's parents were not allowed to be present <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>interview.</b> Facts weighing against custody included that Alvarado was not transported to the police station by police, Alvarado was not threatened or told he would be placed under arrest, and the interview focused on the crimes of Alvarado's friend, not Alvarado's crimes. The Court was not tasked with conducting a separate inquiry into the issue of custody, rather, the Court was tasked with granting relief only if the lower court's decision is objectively unreasonable. Kennedy wrote that, given this standard, the state court's decision was reasonable because it was not clearly unreasonable.|$|E

5|$|In {{the months}} {{following}} his release, Van der Sloot gave several interviews that explained {{his version of}} events. The most notable discussion included a lengthy interview with Fox News that aired over three nights in March 2006. <b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>interview,</b> Van der Sloot indicated that Holloway wanted {{to have sex with}} him, but he did not because he didn't have a condom. Van der Sloot stated that Holloway wanted them to stay on the beach, but that {{he had to go to}} school in the morning. According to Van der Sloot, he was picked up by Satish Kalpoe at about 3:00am and left Holloway sitting on the beach. In August 2005, David Kock, Satish Kalpoe's attorney, stated that his client had gone to sleep, and had not returned to drive Van der Sloot home. Van der Sloot stated that he was somewhat ashamed to have left a young woman alone on the beach, albeit by her own request, and related that he was not truthful at first because he was convinced that Holloway would soon turn up.|$|E
5|$|Once the {{candidate}} cities are selected, they must {{submit to the}} IOC a bigger and more detailed presentation of their project {{as part of a}} candidature file. Each city is thoroughly analysed by an evaluation commission. This commission will also visit {{the candidate}} cities, interviewing local officials and inspecting prospective venue sites, and submit a report on its findings one month prior to the IOC's final decision. <b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>interview</b> process the candidate city must also guarantee that {{it will be able to}} fund the Games. After the work of the evaluation commission, a list of candidates is presented to the General Session of the IOC, which must assemble in a country that does not have a candidate city in the running. The IOC members gathered in the Session have the final vote on the host city. Once elected, the host city bid committee (together with the NOC of the respective country) signs a Host City Contract with the IOC, officially becoming an Olympic host nation and host city.|$|E

25|$|Short-story {{writer and}} critic Patrick J.
