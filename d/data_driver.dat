40|$|Polycrystalline silicon (poly-Si) {{thin film}} {{transistor}} (TFT) technology is very suitable for driving an active matrix LCD (AMLCD) panel as the driver circuit, and the panel can be integrated on the same substrate. This allows the entire display system to be thin and makes the concepts of `TV on wall' and `sheet computer' possible. However, the large variation of threshold voltage of poly-Si TFT across the wafer {{makes it difficult to}} obtain analogue amplifiers with constant gain and phase margin. In this paper, an analogue <b>data</b> <b>driver</b> for the poly-Si TFT AMLCD is proposed. An operational amplifier with a gate bias-voltage generation circuit for this analogue <b>data</b> <b>driver,</b> with characteristics independent of variations in threshold voltage, will be presented. In Hspice simulation, with threshold voltage varying from 2. 5 V to 4. 5 V, gain variations of the proposed amplifier were reduced from +/- 10 dB to +/- 0. 2 dB and phase margin variations were reduced from 10 degrees to 0. 37 degrees compared with typical operational amplifier design. This enables the analogue <b>data</b> <b>driver</b> for AMLCD to be implemented in poly-Si TFT technology...|$|E
40|$|A small-area {{digital-to-analogue}} converter (DAC) using an adaptive body bias scheme is proposed for active-matrix organic light-emitting diode (AMOLED) <b>data</b> <b>driver</b> ICs. The proposed scheme adjusts the body bias {{applied to the}} P-type (PMOS) decoder according to the average picture level (APL) and maintains a low on-resistance of the PMOS decoder at a high APL. This enables reduction of the DAC area by realising the upper-half decoder using only PMOS switches, unlike conventional DACs which use both PMOS and N-type switches. A 20 -channel <b>data</b> <b>driver</b> IC is fabricated using a 0. 18 pm HVCMOS technology with 1. 8 V/ 18 V devices.
