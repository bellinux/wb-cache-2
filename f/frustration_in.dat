5|$|On 15 and 16 May, another {{attempted}} Soviet {{offensive in}} the north met the same resistance encountered on the three {{first days of the}} battle. German bastions continued to hold out against Soviet assaults. The major contribution to Soviet <b>frustration</b> <b>in</b> the battle was the lack of heavy artillery, which ultimately prevented the taking of heavily defended positions. One of the best examples of this was the defense of Ternovaya, where defending German units absolutely refused to surrender. The fighting was so harsh that, after advancing an average of five kilometers, the offensive stopped for the day {{in the north}}. The next day saw a renewal of the Soviet attack, which was largely blocked by counterattacks by German tanks; the tired Soviet divisions could simply not hold their own against the concerted attacks from the opposition. The south, however, achieved success, much like the earlier days of the battle, although Soviet forces began to face heavier air strikes from German aircraft. The Germans, on the other hand, had spent the day fighting holding actions in both sectors, launching small counterattacks to whittle away at Soviet offensive potential, while continuously moving up reinforcements from the south, including several aircraft squadrons transferred from the Crimea. Poor decisions by the 150th Rifle Division, which had successfully crossed the Barvenkovo River, played a major part in the poor exploitation of the tactical successes of the southern shock group.|$|E
5|$|That summer Garfield {{suffered}} from jaundice and significant weight loss. He {{was forced to}} return home, where his wife nursed him back to health. While he was home, Garfield's friends worked to gain him the Republican nomination for Congress, although he refused to politick with the delegates. He returned to military duty that autumn and went to Washington to await his next assignment. During this period of idleness, a rumor of an extra-marital affair caused friction in the Garfield marriage until Lucretia eventually chose to overlook it. Garfield repeatedly received tentative assignments that were quickly withdrawn, to his <b>frustration.</b> <b>In</b> the meantime, he served on the court-martial of Fitz John Porter for his tardiness at the Second Battle of Bull Run. He was convinced of Porter's guilt, and voted with his fellow generals to convict. The trial lasted almost two months, from November 1862 to January 1863, {{and by the end}} of it, Garfield had at last procured an assignment as Chief of Staff to Major General William S. Rosecrans.|$|E
25|$|Other verbal suffixes {{indicate}} that an action is deduced from circumstantial evidence, or based on hearsay. Unlike in English, in Pirahã speakers must state their source of information: they cannot be ambiguous. There are also verbal suffixes that indicate desire {{to perform an}} action, <b>frustration</b> <b>in</b> completing an action, or <b>frustration</b> <b>in</b> even starting an action.|$|E

25|$|There {{is solid}} {{evidence}} from the Abwehr war diaries that methods employed by IRA units carrying out the S-Plan generated only annoyance and <b>frustration</b> <b>in</b> Germany. Attacks against mostly civilian targets, while causing panic and loss {{of confidence in the}} authorities, were not perceived as helpful to damaging British capability for waging war.|$|E

25|$|Daimler went to {{work for}} Maschinenfabrik Daniel Straub, Geislingen an der Steige, where he {{designed}} tools, mills, and turbines. In 1863, he joined the Bruderhaus Reutlingen, a Christian Socialist toolmaker, as inspector and later executive. While there, he met Wilhelm Maybach, then a 15-year-old orphan. Thanks to Daimler's organizational skills, the factory managed to show a profit, but he quit in <b>frustration</b> <b>in</b> 1869, joining Maschinenbau Gesellschaft Karlsruhe in July.|$|E
25|$|A few {{technical}} glitches {{with the}} DeLorean hinder time travel for its users. In the first film, {{the car has}} starter problems and {{has a hard time}} restarting once stopped, much to Marty's repeated <b>frustration.</b> <b>In</b> the second movie, the destination time display malfunctions and shows random dates (mostly January 1, 1885), which partially cause Doc to be sent to 1885. In the third movie, the flying circuits (added by Doc in 2015), fuel line, and fuel injection manifold are damaged, preventing the car from moving under its own power.|$|E
25|$|One {{motivation}} for seeking anger management can be career related. As both a preventative and corrective tool, anger management {{is available to}} help individuals cope with potentially anger-inducing aspects of their jobs. One such situation applies to caretakers of individuals with mental illness. The daily stress combined with slow or no progress with the people under their care can create {{a high level of}} frustration. Skills training for caretakers of relatives with dementia has been developed to help cope with these feelings of <b>frustration</b> <b>in</b> a positive manner.|$|E

25|$|Another {{source of}} {{inspiration}} for Braun consisted of the Priapistic rituals and orgiastic festivals of the Dionysus cult, as well as ceremonies in veneration of Aphrodite (Porne), the goddess of lust and patroness of courtesans. According to Braun, censorship itself is obscene, and the suppression of sexual desire by the political and religious establishment over the centuries has only led to psychological damage and <b>frustration.</b> <b>In</b> his 740-page novel Lady Caligula, Braun goes against the grain by portraying Caligula as a brilliant character, instead of the deranged emperor described in Edward Gibbon's Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire and in I, Claudius.|$|E
25|$|Beuys made {{it clear}} that he {{considered}} this song as a work of art, not the “pop” product it appears to be, which is apparent from the moment one views it. Such becomes more obvious when one looks at the lyrics, which are aimed directly at Reagan, the military complex and whoever is trying to defrost the “Cold War” to make it “hot.” The song has to be understood in the context of intense liberal and progressive <b>frustration</b> <b>in</b> 1982. Beuys warns Reagan et al. that the peace-loving masses are behind him, and that includes the Americans as well.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} {{battles of the}} campaign, Sheridan's cavalry was relegated by army {{commander}} Maj. Gen. George Meade to its traditional role—screening, reconnaissance, and guarding trains and rear areas—much to Sheridan's <b>frustration.</b> <b>In</b> the Battle of the Wilderness (May 5–6, 1864), the dense forested terrain prevented any significant cavalry role. As the army swung around the Confederate right flank {{in the direction of}} Spotsylvania Court House, Sheridan's troopers failed to clear the road from the Wilderness, losing engagements along the Plank Road on May 5 and Todd's Tavern on May 6 through May 8, allowing the Confederates to seize the critical crossroads before the Union infantry could arrive.|$|E

50|$|John Williams had {{a similar}} life to that of his {{character}} in Stoner. He was an English professor at the University of Denver until he retired in 1985.

25|$|Her true {{identity}} {{has been a}} topic of debate and <b>frustration</b> <b>in</b> the Hartford area since the fire occurred. She was buried without a name in Hartford's Northwood cemetery, where a victims' memorial also stands. Two police investigators, Sgts. Thomas Barber and Edward Lowe, photographed her and took fingerprints, footprints, and dental charts. Despite massive publicity and repeated displays of the famous photograph in nationwide magazines, she was never claimed. Barber and Lowe {{spent the rest of}} their lives trying to identify her. They decorated her grave with flowers each Christmas, Memorial Day, and July 6. After their deaths, a local flower company continued to decorate the grave.|$|E
25|$|Operation Goodwood was {{launched}} {{at a time}} of great <b>frustration</b> <b>in</b> the higher command of the Allies, which contributed to the controversy surrounding the operation. The Allied bridgehead was about 20 percent of the planned size, which led to congestion and some fear of a stalemate. Allied commanders {{had not been able to}} exploit their potentially decisive advantages in mobility during June and early July 1944. Much of the controversy surrounding the objectives of the battle originates from the conflicting messages given by Montgomery. He talked up the objectives of Goodwood to the press on the first day, later saying that this was propaganda to encourage the Germans to keep powerful units at the east end of the battlefield.|$|E
25|$|Frederick's rule also {{witnessed}} {{the heyday of}} the National Liberal Party, which was in office from 1854. This period was marked by some political and economic reforms, such as the beginning of the demolition of the walls around Copenhagen and, in 1857, the introduction of free trade. The constant quarrels with the opposition regarding the Schleswig-Holstein Question and German demands that Denmark not try to unite with Schleswig (South Jutland) led to some changes to the constitution in order to fit the foreign political situation, which created <b>frustration</b> <b>in</b> Denmark. The National Liberals therefore at last favored a more resistant course against the Germans, which led to the Second War of Schleswig in 1864. The king wholeheartedly supported this course and just before his sudden death he was prepared to sign a new special constitution for Denmark and Schleswig (the so-called November Constitution).|$|E

25|$|While Paraguayans {{were busy}} {{fighting}} among themselves during the 1920s, Bolivians established {{a series of}} forts in the Paraguayan Chaco. In addition, they bought armaments from Germany and hired German military officers to train and lead their forces. <b>Frustration</b> <b>in</b> Paraguay with Liberal inaction boiled over in 1928 when the Bolivian army established a fort on the Paraguay river called Fortín Vanguardia. In December of that year, Paraguayan major (later colonel) Rafael Franco took matters into his own hands, led a surprise attack on the fort, and succeeded in destroying it. The routed Bolivians responded quickly by seizing two Paraguayan forts. Both sides mobilized but the Liberal government felt unprepared for war so it agreed to the humiliating condition of rebuilding Fortín Vanguardia for the Bolivians. The Liberal government also provoked criticism when it forced Franco, by then a national hero, to retire from the army.|$|E
25|$|Batty {{returned}} to Non-League football to sign for Isthmian League Division One side Woking {{in the summer}} of 1991. He was an ever-present in the league in his first season and collected the first silverware of his career with the Division One title, which the Cards won at a canter. Rarely for a goalkeeper, Batty also scored four goals during the season, three penalties and one from open play in a match versus Wivenhoe Town. His performances also won him the club's Player of the Year award. Playing in the Conference for the 1992–93 season, Batty made 39 appearances as the Cards consolidated their position with an eighth-place finish. He continued to be a first team regular over the following three seasons, in which Woking challenged for promotion to the Football League with a third-place and two runners-up finishes in the Conference. Despite <b>frustration</b> <b>in</b> the league, Batty won four cups during those three seasons, collecting two FA Trophies and two Surrey Senior Cups.|$|E
25|$|The Jazz, {{who were}} undefeated {{at home in}} the postseason coming into the series, had their most {{cohesive}} effort in a 109-83 Game 3 rout. Utah pestered Duncan into early foul trouble and got baskets from players other than Williams and Boozer, who had combined for 57.7% of their team's points through the first two games. But Jazz fans' euphoria over the team's only series victory gave way to <b>frustration</b> <b>in</b> Game 4 – with most of it aimed at Ginóbili and his flopping. 11 of his 16 fourth-quarter points came at the foul line in an ugly overall team performance in which the Spurs made more free throws (30) than field goals (28). Contributing to that discrepancy were four technical fouls called against Utah in the fourth. The subsequent ejections of Utah headcoach Jerry Sloan and Jazz guard Derek Fisher had a charged-up EnergySolutions Arena crowd raining debris onto the court in protest.|$|E

50|$|This book {{proved to}} be Bannon's most {{controversial}} and unpopular of the series, blurring lines between heroes and villains, especially on {{the tail of the}} triumphant and groundbreaking end of I Am a Woman. Bannon stated that the subject matter paralleled Bannon's own <b>frustrations</b> <b>in</b> her marriage. The content also focused on then-whispered of topics such as interracial relationships, domestic violence, and self-loathing in matters of race and sexuality.|$|R
