2500|$|A <b>hydraulic</b> <b>analysis</b> {{published}} in 2016 confirms what {{had long been}} suspected, that the changes made to the dam by the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club severely reduced {{the ability of the}} dam to withstand major storms. [...] Lowering the dam by as much as 0.9 meter (3ft) and failing to replace the discharge pipes {{at the base of the}} dam cut in half the safe discharge capacity of the dam. [...] This fatal lowering of the dam greatly reduced the capacity of the main spillway and virtually eliminated the action of an emergency spillway on the western abutment. [...] Walter Frank first documented the presence of that emergency spillway in a 1988 ASCE publication. [...] The existence of the emergency spillway is supported by topographic data from 1889 which shows the western abutment to be about one foot lower than the crest of the dam remnants, even after the dam had previously been lowered as much as 3 feet by the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club. [...] Adding the width of the emergency spillway to that of the main spillway yields the total width of spillway (wasteway) capacity that had been specified in the 1847 design of William Morris, a State Engineer. Lowering the top of the dam by the Club eliminated nearly all of the capacity of the emergency spillway and greatly reduced the discharge capacity of the main spillway on the eastern side. [...] The dam was now vulnerable to large storm events and was unable to survive the May 1889 storm.|$|E

An approach to derive the performance behaviour of a vertical centrifugal pump used for transporting dredged slurry based on detail <b>hydraulic</b> loss <b>analysis</b> has been presented in this paper. The derived analytical data has been compared with experimental results. Performance analysis of a vertical submersible centrifugal slurry pump has been accomplished in two stages.

The homogenous slurry with fine particles has been treated as Newtonian fluid with slurry viscosity and specific gravity. Additional hydraulic losses due to coarse solid particle have been considered for coarse slurry fraction. The {{performance of}} the vertical centrifugal slurry pump has been predicted with the accuracies of about 87 % and 90 % for respective solid concentration of 18 % and 10 % by volume near the maximum efficiency point.

40|$|<b>Hydraulic</b> <b>analysis</b> {{of water}} {{distribution}} networks {{is an important}} problem in civil engineering. A widely used approach in steady-state analysis of water distribution networks is the global gradient algorithm (GGA). However, when the GGA is applied to solve these networks, zero flows cause a computation failure. On the other hand, there are different mathematical formulations for <b>hydraulic</b> <b>analysis</b> under pressure-driven demand and leakage simulation. This paper introduces an optimization model for the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>analysis</b> of water distribution networks using a metaheuristic method called shuffled complex evolution (SCE) algorithm. In this method, applying if-then rules in the optimization model is a simple way in handling pressure-driven demand and leakage simulation, {{and there is no}} need for an initial solution vector which must be chosen carefully in many other procedures if numerical convergence is to be achieved. The overall results indicate that the proposed method has the capability of handling various pipe networks problems without changing in model or mathematical formulation. Application of SCE in optimization model can lead to accurate solutions in pipes with zero flows. Finally, it can be concluded that the proposed method is a suitable alternative optimizer challenging other methods especially in terms of accuracy...|$|E
