These link the <b>flywheel</b> and the <b>drive</b> shaft with different gear ratios. The flywheel is coupled to the drive with a direct drive or with a geared drive. When the press tool is braked, energy is taken up by the flywheel, and is used to provide for peak torque demands of subsequent press cycles.

50|$|Most punch presses {{today are}} {{hydraulically}} powered. Older machines, however, have mechanically driven rams, meaning {{the power to}} the ram is provided by a heavy, constantly rotating <b>flywheel.</b> The <b>flywheel</b> <b>drives</b> the ram using a Pitman arm. In the 19th century, the flywheels were powered by leather drive belts attached to line shafting, which in turn ran to a steam plant. In the modern workplace, the flywheel is powered by an electric motor.|$|R

50|$|Although the pre-Magnum ('71-'92) and Magnum {{versions}} of the 360/5.9 are both externally balanced, the two are balanced differently (the 360 Magnum uses lighter pistons) and each requires a uniquely balanced damper, <b>flywheel,</b> <b>drive</b> plate, or torque converter.

50|$|Xtrac and Flybrid {{are both}} licensees of Torotrak's technologies, which employ {{a small and}} {{sophisticated}} ancillary gearbox incorporating a continuously variable transmission (CVT). The CPC-KERS is similar as it also forms part of the driveline assembly. However, the whole mechanism including the flywheel sits entirely in the vehicle’s hub (looking like a drum brake). In the CPC-KERS, a differential replaces the CVT and transfers torque between the <b>flywheel,</b> <b>drive</b> wheel and road wheel.|$|E

50|$|Fuel {{injection}} {{and computer}} engine management systems are now normal on middle range and larger motorcycles and {{are increasingly being}} incorporated onto the smaller machines, partly driven by better emission control and lower maintenance but mostly by manufacturing cost considerations. Ignition systems moved from magneto in the 1950s to battery-coil-contact breaker (points), and these were increasingly superseded by Capacitor Discharge Ignition (CDI) from the 1980s. Small, single-cylinder motorcycles abandoned the flywheel magneto system with contact breakers to similar <b>flywheel</b> <b>driven</b> solid-state systems {{at about the same}} time.|$|R
50|$|The special {{front wheel}} {{contains}} a rotating <b>flywheel</b> <b>driven</b> by a rechargeable-battery-powered motor that spins at high RPMs like a gyroscope. This flywheel spins significantly {{faster than the}} front wheel rolls and acts as a gyroscope, even when the bike is moving slowly, such as when the rider is starting. The flywheel causes the front wheel {{to respond to a}} lean by precessing, that is the front wheel turns toward the direction of the lean, which can help provide stability at low speeds, whether riding straight or turning.|$|R
5000|$|Dr. Frank and his {{students}} in Team FATE [...] have been experimenting with various advanced vehicle technologies since 1971. He constructed his first Hybrid Electric Vehicle at the Electrical Eng Dept. of the University of Wisconsin-Madison with {{his students}} in 1971 with the only hybrid electric entry into the URBAN CAR Competition of 1972. He then was able to secure a US DOT contract to design and construct with Ford Motor Company help, the first <b>Flywheel</b> <b>drive</b> cars with a mechanical Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT) for better fuel economy and higher performance. Research into <b>flywheel</b> <b>drive</b> was continued to 1985 when prof Frank transferred to the Mechanical Engineering dept. of the University of California-Davis. He began at UCDavis by entering the SAE Supermileage Contest run by the US-AAA and SAE with his students and began {{to create a new}} concept of teaching mechanical engineering where he took the student machine shop from a dying skill to a fully staffed and capable machine shop with automated machines and research and teaching to support it. The teaching model has been essentially copied {{all over the country and}} is currently standard in many mechanical engineering curriculum. Part of the reason is that the student contests entered by UCDavis were very successful and the students manage first place in Super Mileage all over the country and Canada, providing wide visibility to UCDavis. In 1991 he and his teams of students set world records of 3313 mpg on gasoline and 2200 mpg on M85 in two separate cars. Since second place was so far below, it was attributed to error for many years. The Gasoline record was finally broken by 50 mpg 10 years later and the world record M85 still stands today. In 1992, the USDOE created an Advanced Vehicle Technology Competition called HEV Challenge to compete with the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles (US-PNGV) program to design modern cars that could triple fuel economy to 80 mpg. In 1992 and 1993 he {{and his students}} demonstrated a Plug in hybrid vehicle that achieved 72 mpg nearly achieving the 80 mpg target by the PNGV program. In 1996 his team of students converted a Ford Taurus to a PHEV in the USDOE AVTC FutureCar Challenge to 15 Universities across the country and Canada. The UCDavis vehicle achieved 68 mpg as demonstrated on a trip from Detroit to Washington DC. He and his team then created PHEV automatic transmission models with more efficient mechanical Continuously Variable Transmissions CVTs' and also full size PHEV SUV's that could double fuel economy. The last AVTC project was in 2005 with the AVTC competition Challenge X: Crossover to Sustainable Mobility, in which UC-Davis converted a Chevrolet Equinox to a 4-wheel drive system with double the fuel economy and equal or better performance with no loss if interior space and 40 miles of All Electric Range in a PHEV configuration. In the late nineties General Motors contracted Dr. Frank to convert an EV 1 electric car to plug-in hybrid.|$|E

In sunlight, the system provides voltage regulation while the wheels are accelerated to some maximum speed.

50|$|When a skid developed, {{the wheel}} would stop, {{stopping}} the drum along with it. The <b>flywheel,</b> <b>driven</b> by the one-way clutch, continued to spin. If the relative angle between the drum and flywheel reached 60 degrees, the drum would be driven forward {{to press on}} a valve. This released brake fluid into a reservoir, lowering hydraulic pressure, and releasing the brakes. As soon as the drum started spinning again and reached the (slowing) speed of the flywheel, the valve was released and the brakes re-applied. The system could cycle about ten times a second, and could hold the brakes off for up to four seconds in total before the reservoir filled.|$|R
40|$|An {{improving}} dynamic {{quality of}} vehicles and enhanced fuel efficiency are gained {{thanks to the}} combined power system (CPS), comprising a main energy source - internal combustion engine (ICE) with an attained level of the power source - and an auxiliary energy source, i. e. an energy storage device (a flywheel). To solve this problem was developed a mathematical model of CPS comprising internal combustion engine and flywheel energy storage (FES) with stepless drive. The stepless drive of the flywheel is made to be hydrostatic mechanical to raise the system efficiency. To reduce the drive weight and simplify the control system in the hydraulic part of the <b>flywheel</b> <b>drive</b> is used only one hydraulic unit being controlled. The paper presents a kinematic diagram of the track-type vehicle equipped with the CPS that has a hydrostatic mechanical drive of the flywheel and a mechanical transmission. A mathematical model of the system comprising an ICE, hydrostatic mechanical drive, and FES with stepless drive has been developed. This mathematical model was used to study the influence of ICE and <b>flywheel</b> <b>drive</b> parameters on the dynamic characteristics of the system. The paper estimates the impact of flywheel energy consumption, pressure in the hydraulic system, and control parameter of hydrostatic mechanical drive on the charging time of FES. The obtained piecewise linear law to control the regulation parameter of the hydraulic unit allows us to minimize the charging time of the flywheel at the short-term stops and in the parking area of a tracked vehicle equipped with a CPS. The causes affecting the performance of ‘ICE – drive – flywheel’ system {{in the course of}} the flywheel acceleration are a restricted maximum power of the engine, as well as a limited generating capacity, and a maximum <b>flywheel</b> <b>drive</b> hydro-system pressure. The obtained results allow us to determine rational parameters of the flywheel and the laws of drive control to provide their further optimization, with a tracked vehicle being in motion, under random external effect. </p...|$|E

5000|$|A {{friction}} motor is {{a simple}} mechanism to propel toy cars, trucks, trains, action figures and similar toys. The motor consists of a large flywheel which {{is connected to the}} drive wheels of the toy via a very low gear ratio, so that the flywheel revolves faster. The flywheel's axis is perpendicular to the direction in which the toy faces and moves. When the toy is pushed forward, the drive wheels engage the flywheel. Pushing the vehicle forward repeatedly spins this flywheel up to speed. When let go, the <b>flywheel</b> <b>drives</b> the vehicle forward. The flywheel stores the kinetic energy of the initial acceleration and propels the toy after it is released.|$|R

40|$|The use of {{thick-walled}} composite cylinders in structural applications {{has seen}} tremendous {{growth over the}} last decade. Applications include pressure vessels, <b>flywheels,</b> <b>drive</b> shafts, spoolable tubing, and production risers. In these applications, the geometry of a composite cylinder is axisymmetric {{but in many cases}} the applied loads are non-axisymmetric and more rigorous analytical tools are required for an accurate stress analysis. A closed-form solution is presented for determining the layer-by-layer stresses, strains, and displacements and first-ply failure in laminated composite cylinders subjected to non-axisymmetric loads. The applied loads include internal and external pressure, axial force, torque, axial bending moment, uniform temperature change, rotational velocity, and interference fits. The formulation is based on the theory of anisotropic elasticity and a state of generalized plane deformation along the axis of the composite cylinder.

40|$|Abstract — The {{objective}} herein is {{to demonstrate}} the feasibility of a real-time digital control of an inverted pendulum for modeling and control, with emphasis on nonlinear auto regressive moving average based neural network (NARMA). The plant of interest is a novel Gyroscopic Inverted Pendulum (GIP) device that is nonlinear and open-loop unstable. The GIP balances a pendulum on its free knife-edge base using a <b>flywheel</b> <b>driven</b> by DC motor fixated on the top. In this application, an indirect data-based technique is taken, where {{a model of the}} plant is identified on the basis of input-output data and then used in the model-based design of a NARMA controller. The plant under digital PID control with I-adaptation provides initial stability {{at the beginning of a}} single layer NARMA neural network training. NARMA models of increasing complexity are used successively to generate input-output data for the training of multilayered NARMA models. In using a NARMA neural network the control laws are nonlinear and online adaptation of the model is possible to capture un-modeled or time-varying dynamics. Such an environment provides for experimentation, data collection, system identification and real time control strategy implementation.
