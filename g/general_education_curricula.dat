Using an explanatory sequential mixed methods approach, the model was tested by examining whether the curricula were both prescriptive and specific. First, the researcher analyzed how prescriptive the <b>general</b> <b>education</b> <b>curricula</b> at 38 colleges of health science were by evaluating the institutions’ catalogs and websites. In the qualitative phase, the researcher interviewed general education leaders at six of the colleges to confirm the quantitative data and obtain information about how specific the <b>general</b> <b>education</b> <b>curricula</b> were to healthcare. The quantitative findings supported Bergquist’s model that colleges of health science have a prescriptive curriculum with 71 % of the colleges having a core, major-dominated or mixed model with a primary component of core or major-dominated. In addition, the number of required general education credits and the proportion of required math and science credits were higher than data from most national studies for other types of colleges. The interviews confirmed that general education is strongly prescriptive and also demonstrated that some colleges have a distribution model where students take a limited number of offerings in selected categories, but that the major program requirements dictate the courses students in each major must take within the distribution categories. Implemented this way, even the distribution model was prescriptive. These findings also supported Bergquist’s model by illustrating how specific the general education course content was to healthcare. Adviser: Brent Cejd...|$|E

40|$|Some novel <b>general</b> <b>education</b> {{requirements}} {{have been}} in place at Oregon State University (OSU) since a major and admirable development effort in 1988, but implementation has become overly problematic over the last decades. This observation and other pressing issues on campus drove a major review effort last year involving administration, faculty, staff and students. We were reassured by those results in terms of the philosophy and structure of our “Baccalaureate Core” and how well they align with emerging ideas from the American Association of Colleges and Universities and peer institutions nationwide. However, our campus community was consistently unsatisfied with the evolved, checklist nature of our <b>general</b> <b>education</b> requirements, the associated strategizing and gaming required of students and advisors, and the implications that this has for lack of horizontal and vertical integration of related components, both within the Core and across curricula to majors/minors. We are therefore starting a significant revision process centered on: 1. a renewed focus on basic learning outcomes for our graduates that tie together <b>general</b> <b>education</b> and major/minor <b>curricula,</b> with better description and communication of the overall design; 2. stricter requirements for first‐year experiences and advising that are more closely aligned to campus retention efforts; 3. expansion of experiential learning opportunities (e. g., research, study abroad and service learning) {{that could be used to}} meet several learning goals within our <b>general</b> <b>education</b> requirements; and 4. identified, centralized administrative support to assist with implementation in terms of departmental offerings, instructor support and course access. I will summarize our review and revision process/results and provide detail for each of the four proposed changes above, including specific issues from OSU and observed national trends related to each.

40|$|To be {{understood}} and retained, knowledge of statistics {{needs to be}} situated in clear and relevant contexts. Statistical information must ultimately be interpreted, and so students need to develop the skills to derive specific meaning from statistics. For this reason, the inclusion of statistical literacy in <b>general</b> <b>education</b> <b>curricula</b> is crucial. Traditional introductory courses in statistics, while they may include real-world examples, are not typically designed around this need. For students {{in the social and}} natural sciences, such contexts {{are an integral part of}} their major course of study where the meaning of statistics most frequently comes from disciplinary applications—the production of statistics as scientific evidence. Students in the humanities and fine arts, on the other hand, still build their beliefs about authority – the bases for making claims and the expertise that such practices entail – mainly on philosophical premises.
