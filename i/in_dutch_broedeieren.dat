40|$|Brominated {{flame retardants}} {{have entered the}} human food chain. For the time being the {{occurrence}} of these chemicals <b>in</b> <b>Dutch</b> food does not pose a human health risk. However, this might easily change at increasing contents of flame retardants <b>in</b> <b>Dutch</b> food. The monitoring of brominated flame retardants <b>in</b> <b>Dutch</b> food therefore remains necessary. Brominated flame retardants are environmental contaminants which have entered the human food chain. Next to food these chemicals can also enter the human body by ingestion of house-dust. Due to their persistent behaviour brominated flame retardants leave the human body very slowly. Brominated flame retardants therefore have bioaccumulating properties. In {{order to determine the}} health risk of brominated flame retardants these chemicals have been investigated <b>in</b> <b>Dutch</b> food product and, as a measure of the amount in the body, <b>in</b> <b>Dutch</b> breast milk. <b>In</b> <b>Dutch</b> food twelve flame retardants were found, eleven of which also occurred in breast milk. Contrary to results in Sweden the content of flame retardants <b>in</b> <b>Dutch</b> breast milk did not decline between 1998 and 2003. For health risk assessment a maximal allowed intake level is needed. Such an intake level is only available for the flame retardant PolyBromoDiphenylEther- 99 (PBDE- 99). At the moment the exposure to PBDE- 99 from food equals its maximal intake level. So, though the exposure to PBDE- 99 does not pose an immediate health risk, this may easily change when the content of brominated flame retardants <b>in</b> <b>Dutch</b> food would increase. The continuous monitoring of brominated flame retardants <b>in</b> <b>Dutch</b> food therefore remains necessary...|$|R
50|$|At Belgian universities, {{a person}} titled Licentiate (or Licentiaat <b>in</b> <b>Dutch</b> or Licencié <b>in</b> French, {{abbreviated}} lic.) holds the equivalent education of a Master's degree. A female Licentiate was called Licentiate <b>in</b> <b>Dutch</b> and Licenciée <b>in</b> French. The years spent {{to obtain the}} degree of Licentiate were called Licentiaat or Licentie <b>in</b> <b>Dutch</b> and Licence <b>in</b> French. It was the second level of university study, after that of Candidate (or Kandidaat <b>in</b> <b>Dutch</b> or Candidat <b>in</b> French, abbreviated cand.). A female Candidate was called Kandidate <b>in</b> <b>Dutch</b> and Candidate <b>in</b> French. The years spent to obtain the degree of Candidate were called Kandidaats or Kandidatuur <b>in</b> <b>Dutch</b> and Candidature <b>in</b> French. Each of those two levels required {{at least two years}} (four semesters) of successful study. Licentiates were required to write a thesis (called licentiaatsverhandeling <b>in</b> <b>Dutch</b> and mémoire de licence in French). This candidate-licentiate system is now being replaced by an American-style bachelor-master system. Civil engineer (or Burgerlijk ingenieur <b>in</b> <b>Dutch</b> or Ingénieur civil in French, abbreviated ir.), Doctor of medicine (or Doctor in de geneeskunde <b>in</b> <b>Dutch</b> or Docteur en médecine in French, abbreviated dr. med., until 1992), Physician (or Arts <b>in</b> <b>Dutch</b> or Médecin <b>in</b> French, after 1992), Doctor of law (or Doctor in de rechten <b>in</b> <b>Dutch</b> or Docteur en droit in French, abbreviated dr. iur., until 1972) and Magister (philosophy and theology, abbreviated mag.) were equivalent to Licentiate. Baccalaureus (philosophy and theology, abbreviated bac.) was equivalent to Candidate. The former titles dr. med. and dr. iur. are to be considered as professional doctorates, whereas the title dr., which is the result of third level study and research, is a higher doctorate. The Belgian licentiate was also equivalent to the doctorandus in the Netherlands. At the KU Leuven {{there used to be a}} degree Licentiaat-doctorandus in de TEW (Toegepaste Economische Wetenschappen) en in Beleidsinformatica. Apart from the general abbreviation lic., more specific abbreviations, such as LHFW (Licentiaat in de Handels- en Financiële Wetenschappen) and LTH (Licentiaat in de Tandheelkunde) exist.|$|R

40|$|In this study, we {{examined}} the relationship between changes regarding religious practices and beliefs <b>in</b> <b>Dutch</b> society as ascertained in longitudinal surveys and indicators of these social cultural trends as witnessed in drama programs on Dutch television. A sample of 503 prime-time programs aired between 1980 and 2005, with a total number of 2, 114 identified main characters, was selected for systematic content analysis. The findings showed a marked decrease in the proportion of main characters with an identifiable religious orientation and the number of programs with religious minor characters over this period of time. The occurrence of religious themes in storylines in programs also had decreased. Institutional religion plays a rapidly decreasing role <b>in</b> <b>Dutch</b> society and religious content <b>in</b> <b>Dutch</b> drama television is all but absent. Our main conclusion is that longitudinal changes in the representation of religion <b>in</b> <b>Dutch</b> television drama seem to precede changes in the role and perception of religion <b>in</b> <b>Dutch</b> society...|$|R
