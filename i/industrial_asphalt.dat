It {{is the responsibility of}} the user of this method to consult and use departmental safety and health practices and determine the applicability of regulatory limitations before any testing is performed. A. SCOPE d. Adapter, with TS 24 / 40 joint. This method covers the recovery of bitumen from asphaltic mixtures with trichloroethylene by the <b>Industrial</b> <b>Asphalt</b> Modified Abson Recovery Method. The bitumen is recovered with substantially the same properties as possessed in the asphaltic mixture. B. APPARATUS 1. Centrifuge: Batch unit capable of exerting a minimum centrifugal force of 770 times gravity or continuous unit capable of exerting a minimum centrifugal force of 3, 000 times gravity. 2.

30|$|Gasification {{technology}} is suggested to utilize asphalt particles, which are {{produced in the}} heavy oil deep separation process of using coupled low temperature separation of solvent and post extraction residue. In this work, the asphalt particles were first slurried with water and then gasified to produce synthesis gas. The gasification process of asphalt water slurry in an entrained flow gasifier was simulated using a three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model based on an Eulerian-Lagrangian method. The trajectories and residence time of asphalt particles, and the reaction rates, gas species distribution, temperature field and carbon conversion in the entrained flow gasifier were obtained. The predicted {{results indicated that the}} asphalt water slurry was a good feedstock for gasification. Moreover, the effects of particle size, oxygen equivalence ratio, and mass content of asphalt particles on the gasification performance of asphalt water slurry were investigated. These results are helpful for <b>industrial</b> application of <b>asphalt</b> water slurry gasification technology.|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} air blowing on paving grade vacuum residue to produce high {{softening}} point <b>industrial</b> grade <b>asphalt</b> {{have been studied}} in a gas-liquid reactor. Factors such as reactor design, temperature, air flow rate and time were investigated. Response of different feedstock sot metallic chloride catalysts were examined. The course of reaction was followed by measuring penetration and softening point of the blown product at regular intervals. It {{was found that the}} catalytic activity of metallic chloride could be enhanced by combining the chloride with manganese dioxide. Quantity of chloride catalyst, the amount of blown distillate and acidic gases are considerably reduced, by the addition of manganese dioxide for a given degree of hardness of the blown product. Chemical changes occurring during asphalt air blowing has been evaluated by adsorption-adsorption chromatography. The amount of asphaltene increases at the expense of saturate, namphthene aromatic and polar aromatic. Identical fractional chemical composition of different asphalts results in identical penetration and softening point. However, high molecular weight hydrocarbons may also be connected with hardening of asphalt. N. m. r. studies show transformation of straight chain hydrocarbons to cyloparaffins which in turn, are dehydrogenated to form aromatic hydrocarbons during air blowing. Dehydrogenation of asphalt molecules is supported by elemental analysed. U. v spectra show the formation of polycondensed aromatic, while f. t. i. r. spectra indicate incorporation of oxygen and cross linking in blown asphalt. Structural characterization of asphalt by instrumental methods, suggest that the blown product becomes more complex and condensed leading to increase in molecular weight. These changes are accelerated by active catalysts. The air blowing induces a movement of components from non-polar to more polar fractions. A general transformation mechanism has been proposed. Quantity and characteristics of the effluents {{have been found to be}} dependent on the chemical nature and physical properties of feed as well as on the catalyst used...|$|R
40|$|This study {{deals with}} the use of fossil carbon (oil, natural gas, coal) to {{manufacture}} materials (‘products of non-energy use') and with the potential to reduce the inputs of fossil resources and the emissions of fossil CO 2 in Germany. An overview of the material flows is given for Germany in 1995. Recycled and re-used products still accounted for less than 10 % of the end products consumed domestically. The energy requirements and CO 2 emissions from the production and waste management processes related to non-energy use have been calculated: it is estimated that approximately 1700 PJ of finite primary energy are consumed and 57 Mt of fossil CO 2 emissions are released (1995). Compared with the total German industry (without non-energy use) this represents 44 % of the energy use and 20 % of the fossil CO 2 emissions. Detailed analyses are performed {{in order to determine the}} extent to which the energy consumed by and the CO 2 emissions released from this system could be reduced. This is done by estimating the possible effects of (a) using waste as a resource, and (b) using biomass as a feedstock. In the first group recycling, re-use and enhanced energy recovery are investigated for plastics, discarded tyres, technical rubber products, <b>asphalt,</b> <b>industrial</b> bitumen and waste lubricants. The second group, i. e. the analysed bio-based materials, comprises of oleochemical surfactants, lubricants from vegetable oils, starch polymers and selected bulk chemicals. The total potential savings related to waste use and biomass use (see above (a) and (b)) are estimated at 220 PJ of gross finite energy and 14 Mt of gross fossil CO 2. This is the equivalent of a 13 % saving in energy and a 24 % reduction in CO 2 emissions. Hence, the saving potential identified on the non-energy side is comparable with the saving potential discussed and negotiated for CO 2 mitigation through energy efficiency improvements...|$|R
