40|$|ABSTRACT The {{objective}} of the present research was to clarify {{the basis for the}} difference in performance of turkey toms characterized as low or high semen volume producers. Variables measured included testicular weight, deferent duct semen volume, and deferent duct morphology based upon plastic casts. Three organizational patterns emerged after viewing plastic casts of deferent ducts: helical, serpentine, and randomly folded coil. The randomly folded coil was the principal pattern in deferent ducts from low and high semen volume producers alike. No difference in patterns was observed between low and high semen volume producers. Differential semen yield was attributed to a greater testicular mass along with a greater storage capacity of the deferent duct in high semen volume producers. However, deferent <b>duct</b> <b>storage</b> capacity appeared to be the predominant factor affecting semen yield.

40|$|Large {{parts of}} {{district}} heating used in Gothenburg originates from excess heat generated from industries near the city. There is potential to utilise more excess heat in Gothenburg from distant industries. This will however require a connecting pipeline of considerable length with high investment cost. This thesis investigates whether the economical benefits {{of such a}} pipeline can be increased by installing an additional borehole thermal energy storage (BTES) and an electricity driven heat pump. Investigations have been made for two locations, western Gothenburg and Kungälv. The behaviour of the BTES has been analysed with the <b>Duct</b> <b>Storage</b> Model using the software PILESIM 2. The district heating system has been sim-ulated with the software Martes. Simulation data including prices of fuels, taxes and political instruments {{used for this study}} are based on the forecasts of the local district heating company, Göteborg Energi AB. The investment cost of the BTES is based on previously performed master thesis project at Göteborg Energi AB. The results indicate that the potential to make profits from the proposed BTE...|$|E
40|$|Vertical BHE (borehole heat exchangers) are {{a common}} {{solution}} for GCHP applications (ground coupled heat pump). Correct BHE design and sizing are mandatory to either assure long term GCHP performance or reduce the payback period. Most models for performing the time varying analysis of complex borefields {{are based on the}} solution of the conduction equation, through the calculation of proper temperature response factors. The DST (<b>Duct</b> <b>Storage</b> Model) is often referred as the benchmark analysis tool, even if it is based on a simplified description of the borefield geometry. In this paper, DST predictions, in terms of hourly fluid temperatures along 20 years, are compared with the corresponding results obtained by implementing the MLAA (Multiple Aggregation Algorithm) approach by Bernier et al. into a model able to employ suitable g-functions generated starting from the Finite Line Source solution. This paper discusses some aspects of the improvements here introduced to the original MLAA method. The study is devoted to the comparison between the predicted fluid temperature values by the DST and MLAA models, with special attention to the influence of the BHE geometry (matrix like vs in line configurations) and to the shape of the yearly hourly load profiles (balanced vs unbalanced ground loads) ...|$|E

40|$|The sun {{is a huge}} {{energy source}} with great {{potential}} of providing energy to the heating of homes and other buildings in an environmentally sustainable manner. In order to provide buildings with energy from the sun {{it is necessary to}} transfer the energy supply over time to when the demand arises. By storing the heat in a seasonal storage, solar energy from the summer can be used in the winter when the demand for heating is greatest. Today's existing plants are mainly in Europe and particularly in Germany. These facilities are designed to supply heat demands greater than 400 MWh and covers about 40 - 50 % of this need which consists of energy for space heating and domestic hot water. How much of the heat demand that is covered, the solar fraction, is partly due to losses from the storage which in turn is connected to the surface area of the storage. The bigger a storage, the smaller the losses because of the decreasing relationship between surface area and storage volume. Looking at the size of the seasonal storages that are currently in operation, the question if seasonal storage is also suitable for installations designed for heat demands smaller than 400 MWh arises. Jonas Haglund at the architect office Skanark AB in Karlstad is planning an accommodation of 40 flats and hopes that seasonal stored solar energy can serve as the main energy source for space heating and hot water. In order to make housing more attractive he is considering the idea of adding other features, like a pool and an atrium, that also require heating but with lower temperature requirements. Haglund would like to investigate whether the efficiency of the solar collector increases when the extra energy demands are added and if the energy cost, for those demands, in this way can be reduced. The {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate the possibility of covering a large fraction of a small-scale annual heat demand corresponding to about 40 newly built apartments. The study shall present the solar fractions that can be achieved with different storage concepts when storage size and collector area is varied. The study will also answer how the solar fraction will change if a heating demand with lower temperature requirements and varied character is added to the basic domestic heating and if the added energy demand to some extent can be free. These questions are answered by calculations and simulations with the simulation software COMSOL Multiphysics. The results show that it is possible to obtain solar fractions above 80 % with sufficient collector area. Suitable storage volume varies depending on the specific storage concept. Simulations of seasonal storage in a tank show that a storage volume of 13 m 3 /MWh is an appropriate size, while the corresponding figure for <b>duct</b> <b>storage</b> in clay is 20 m 3 /MWh. An added heating demand of low temperature character increases the efficiency of the solar panels and creates, so called, free energy. Examensarbet...|$|E

5000|$|Due to insemination, {{the sperm}} of glandulocaudines has adapted. In many species, an {{elongate}} cytoplasmic collar binds the flagellum to the elongate nucleus at some stage of spermiogenesis. In almost all species, the sperm cell bodies are elongate. In the tribe Diapomini, the genus Planaltina expresses only round sperm (like that of externally fertilizing characins) and the genera Diapoma and Acrobrycon only express slightly elongated sperm; this may indicate a possible plesiomorphy. Some sperm have enlarged regions containing mitochondria, which may help in prolonging {{the life of}} the sperm while stored in the ovary. In some genera, sperm clumping and patterns of arrangement are observed in the sperm <b>ducts</b> and <b>storage</b> regions. In the tribes Xenobryconini (in the genera Tyttocharax, Scopaeocharax, and Xenurobrycon) and Glandulocaudini, there is a form of sperm packaging which would allow for a higher sperm density during transfer from the male to the female. These packets are called spermatozeugmata, and the sperm are packaged [...] to each other; this packaging is further increased by the elongation of the sperm cells. In Xenobryconini, each spermatozeugma is produced and is released fully formed in the spermatocysts, but in Glandulocaudini, the sperm is released from the spermatocysts and packaged elsewhere. The spermatozeugmata are situated in the posterior end of the testes, which serves as a storage area for sperm.|$|R
40|$|A {{unique and}} complex {{situation}} of heavy metal pollution {{arose in the}} El Paso del Norte region, {{one of the largest}} and oldest metropolitan areas on the US-Mexican border. This region with its complex topography is home to more than 2. 2 million people sharing the same environment. Although many studies have been conducted in the region to identify the sources of environmental contamination, the cumulative history of heavy metal pollution is still incomplete. ^ In order to identify the patterns of heavy metal dispersion and to test the hypothesis that the American Smelting and Refining Company (ASARCO) was a considerable contributor to local heavy metal pollution, we have studied attic dust as a medium of investigation of air pollution history via environmental forensic methods. Undisturbed attic dust provides an integrated history of atmospheric loading of particulates emanating from geological, biological, and anthropogenic sources and helps reconstruct past air pollution events on a local scale. ^ Ninety-six attic dust samples were collected from surfaces in 15 houses and buildings of varying ages in two neighborhoods, Kern Place and Government Hill areas of El Paso, and from a downtown Ciudad Juarez location (Victoria Theater). Fifty-one combined dust samples and twelve combined samples of unpolluted buried soil horizons were extracted with Aqua Regia and were analyzed by Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometry (ICP-OES) and Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS). Concentration values of 17 major and trace elements in the dusts and soil were utilized for calculation of their enrichment factors (EFs). In order to further clarify the sources of heavy metals, the EF data were processed by summary statistics, Pearson correlation analyses, MANCOVA Willk 2 ̆ 7 s Lambda test, Cluster and Principal Component (PCA) statistical methods. ^ All the statistical analyses identified the same group of elements, six heavy metals/metalloids, associated with smelting processes. The mean EFs of Pb (263), As (81), Cd (333), Sb (644), Cu (475) and Zn (376) appeared abnormally high in contrast to other elements 2 ̆ 7 EFs (3 ̆c 10) in all locations, suggesting their anthropogenic origin. At the same time the EFs of these elements were much higher in attic dusts collected from Kern Place compared to Government Hill the latter being more distantly located from the ASARCO smelter. Dust from the newest attics and attic surfaces (pipes, <b>ducts,</b> <b>storage</b> containers) post-dating the 2000 s showed lower heavy metals EF values than the dust collected on adjacent surfaces that were present during the smelter operation. A fundamental change in the EFs distribution of heavy metals/metalloids occurred after 1966, and it was the year when ASARCO constructed an 828 foot (252. 4 m) smokestack. The strongest correlations (r 3 ̆e 0. 92, p 3 ̆c 0. 0001) were observed among Pb, As, Cd, Cu and Sb, being the highest from the attic dust sampled in Kern Place area. These metals/metalloids (with minor exceptions) were also grouped together into one cluster and factor, signifying their common source, non-ferrous ore smelting. ^ Based on the evidence provided by the dust analyses, it is concluded that the identified heavy metals were predominantly emitted from the smelter stack and were preferentially deposited in the surrounding area. The emissions could have followed wind trajectories near the surface along the Rio Grande valley rather than mixing to heights resulting in movement over the Franklin Mountains and deposited on the east side of El Paso. ...|$|R

The patients succumbed between day 1 and 4 months of life; 9 patients died {{within the first}} month. All patients showed severe pathologic changes of liver with cholestasis in all livers. Extensive accumulation of stainable iron of the hepatocytes was present in 9 / 17 autopsy tissues and in two biopsy specimens. Moderate to abundant iron storage in the Kupffer cells was seen in all liver specimens. The amount of hepatocytic iron was high in livers up to 1 month of age and decreased thereafter. The general features and liver findings of this disorder suggest the name Growth Retardation Aminoaciduria Cholestasis Iron Overload, Lactacidosis and Early Death (GRACILE, OMIM 603358). Calcified concrements were seen in the medulla of 13 / 16 kidney specimens. Pancreas of 13 / 14 patients showed interstitial fibrosis and exocrine atrophy.

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} regulating sperm transfer, storage, and use in {{insects are}} far from clear. Even {{in one of the}} most well-resolved systems for studying post-copulatory sexual selection, the yellow dung fly (Scathophaga stercoraria), the process of sperm transfer is not well understood. Our aim is to model the fluid dynamics of sperm flow in the reproductive tracts of female yellow dung flies to determine what aspects of female morphology may influence sperm movement. We model fluid flow using computational mathematics, and investigate geometric parameters suspected of influencing rates of ejaculate movement: the curvature of sperm <b>storage</b> <b>ducts,</b> the smoothness of the inner duct wall (surface area), spermathecal duct length and duct diameter. Duct length does not influence the flow rate, where duct diameter has a strong influence of up to 71 % at the extremes of the natural range observed in female dung flies. Whereas duct curvature influences the flow rate only slightly (with an effect size of 1. 6 % over the natural range), the duct wall smoothness has a pronounced effect (50 %). The increase in duct surface area also slightly increases the effect of curvature, implying that these structures might act synergistically, although the small size of this effect argues against such a synergy having evolved as an adaptation for controlling sperm flow. We discuss the implications of our model and methods for research in sperm competition and sexual selection...|$|R
40|$|Epididymides were {{collected}} from five mature healthy indigenous bulls and brought to the laboratory in ice. Tissue sections were taken from six different areas; two (proximal and distal) from each head, body and tail regions of the epididymis, processed and stained with Haematoxylin& Eosin (H&E) or Van-Gieson to study the microscopic anatomy and morphometry. The volume densities of the epididymal duct, ductular lumen, epithelium, and the intestitium were measured. The tubular and lumen diameters and heights of the epithelium and stereo cilia were also measured. The commonest cell type found was principal cells with steriocilia. The basal cells, the second abundant cell type, found closer to the basement membrane of the tubules and rich in the body region. The apical cells were located closer to luminal surface of the duct. The halo cells were the least common cell type observed. The smooth muscle layers that encircle epididymal duct increase its thickness from head to tail direction. The volume density of epididymal duct was high in head and tail region {{compare with that of}} body region. The epithelial volume density decreased from head to tail direction and the opposite was observed for the luminal volume density. The tubular diameter found to be similar in all six regions except proximal tail which had the highest diameter (5. 9 mm). The decrease of the epithelial height from head to tail direction contributed for the increase of the luminal diameter in the same direction. The height of stereocilia was found low in the distal head (1. 2 mm) and distal tail (1. 4 mm) region compare {{to the rest of the}} regions. Four types of cells namely principal cells, halo cells, basal cell and epical cells, are present in the epididymal <b>duct.</b> The sperm <b>storage</b> area in the tail of the epididymis is increased due to an increase in the luminal diameter caused by a decreased in epithelial height and length of stereocilia...|$|R
40|$|Two salient {{features}} of the pulmonary response to reactive oxidant air pollutants such as ozone are the heterogeneity of response by site within the respiratory tract {{and the development of}} tolerance to injury with repeated exposure. The {{purpose of this study was}} to establish whether the development of tolerance to long-term exposure is associated with changes in the tracheobronchial epithelium. Male F 344 -N rats were exposed to 0, 0. 12, 0. 5, or 1. 0 ppm ozone 6 hours/day for 5 days/week for 20 months and killed 1 week post-exposure. Samples for light microscopic morphometry were obtained by microdissection from each infusion-fixed trachea and left lung lobe and included: 1) a cranial bronchus with short path length (generation no. 4 to 5) and small diameter; 2) a central bronchus with short path length (generation no. 4 to 5) and large diameter; and 3) a caudal bronchus with long path length (generation no. 10 to 12) and small diameter. In addition, three sites within the central acinus were examined from cranial, central, and caudal regions. These sites included terminal bronchiole, 0. 5 to 1 mm proximal to terminal bronchiole and bronchiolarized alveolar <b>duct.</b> Intraepithelial mucin <b>storage</b> (AB/PAS-positive material quantified by image analysis) within the trachea decreased with dose. Mucin storage was unchanged in the central bronchus, increased threefold with dose in the caudal bronchus, and was six times higher in the cranial bronchus at 1. 0 ppm ozone. Epithelial composition was unchanged in trachea or any bronchi; however, we noted a significant dose-dependent increase in nonciliated cell mass and volume fraction in terminal bronchioles in all three regions. There was also a significant increase in nonciliated cell mass in the bronchiolarized alveolar ducts. Bronchiolar nonciliated cells were identified greater than fourfold further into alveolar ducts in 1. 0 ppm exposed than in 0 ppm animals. Nonciliated cells occurred almost 200 microns deeper into alveolar ducts in cranial regions than in caudal regions. We conclude: 1) that the development of tolerance to injury produced by long-term exposure to ozone involves changes in airway epithelium and 2) that these changes are site specific and involve alterations in both secretory activity and cellular composition...|$|R
40|$|The {{investigation}} of the energetic aspects of spermatozoon motility implementation (Chapter 2) was carried out using demembranated spermatozoa of taxonomically distant fish species (common carp and sterlet). Special attention {{was given to the}} functioning of ATP regeneration systems: adenylate kinase (AK), and creatine kinase (CK). It was shown {{for the first time that}} the phosphocreatine/CK system is present in sterlet spermatozoa and plays an essential role in ATP regeneration. Spermatozoa of carp and sterlet were shown to have similar systems for ATP regeneration, while the efficacy of the studied systems differs in these species. The low baseline activity of CK in carp and AK in sterlet suggest these to be the source of the most pronounced effects of their inhibition on energy supply for flagella movement in the respective species. The presence of a maturational process during the post-testicular transit of sperm in sturgeon was recently ascertained in our laboratory (Chapter 3). This discovery prompted {{investigation of}} the factors that regulate this process including the involvement of proteolysis regulators and prooxidant-antioxidant system. As a result of this study (Chapter 3. 3), we found that there was no significant difference between proteolytic profiles of seminal fluids (SF) of testicular sperm (TS) and Wolffian duct sperm (WS). It suggests that the majority of proteases present in SF of mature sperm originate in the testis. Measure of amidase and anti-proteolytic activities in the SF of sterlet sperm showed significant decrease in activities as the sperm passed through the kidneys and Wolffian ducts. Considering our observation that trypsin inhibition during in vitro TS maturation blocked the maturation process (Chapter 3. 1), and based on zymography, amidase and anti-proteolytic activity determination, we think that the decrease in anti-proteolytic activity of spermatozoa surroundings during their post-testicular transit could be needed to prepare them for maturation. The present study showed that maturation of sturgeon spermatozoa and different times of <b>storage</b> in Wolffian <b>ducts</b> (in vivo <b>storage),</b> are accompanied by significant alterations in motility parameters as well as in SF redox balance (Chapter 4. 1). A high level of TBA-reactive substances (TBARS) and a high activity of antioxidant enzymes were found in immature TS compared to those in WS. The high activity of the enzymatic antioxidant system (AOS) allows TS to cope with the deleterious effects of excessive reactive oxygen species production and to retain the ability to become motile after post-testicular transit, or after in vitro maturation. The increase in TBARS content during in vivo storage was not accompanied by a corresponding increase in activity of AOS. We suggest that extended time in the Wolffian ducts resulted in sperm oxidative damage resulting from inadequate AOS efficacy and, finally, in decreases in motility parameters. Short-term hypothermic in vitro storage of sterlet sperm resulted in a significant decrease in motility and velocity without changes of AOS activity (Chapter 4. 2). It means that AOS of sterlet sperm is effective enough to prevent the development of oxidative stress during short-term storage. Short period of tench sperm exposure to hypotonic conditions was shown to induce oxidative stress and, as a result, sperm quality decline (Chapter 4. 3). The combined results of the study concerning the regulation of sperm prooxidant-antioxidant status (Chapter 4) during spermatozoa maturation, motility activation and sperm in vivo and in vitro storage may confirm a dual role of reactive oxygen species (regulatory or damaging depending from the levels of their formation and elimination) in fish sperm physiology...|$|R
