5|$|After {{the five}} heroine's routes are completed, the story shifts to a setting amid a ruined Kazamatsuri where Kotarou {{encounters}} Kagari {{in a world}} after re-evolution, still on the Moon. Kotarou {{at this point is}} a unified entity of all the Kotarous from all timelines where humanity was destroyed and he has memories of these events. The Moon's Kagari is trying to research a way so the Earth and humanity are not destroyed, and Kotarou attempts to buy her time while fighting a hoard of familiars summoned by Sakura Kashima of Gaia whose resolve is to annihilate humanity by killing Kagari. Kotarou and the entire cast rejoin together to protect Kagari, who manages to finish her plan to allow the Earth and humanity to coexist by sending the Moon's life <b>force</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Earth. In the past, the Earth had sent this energy to the Moon so life could continue. There is just enough energy and resources left for a final re-evolution.|$|E
5|$|Following the American attack, Komori {{pulled his}} {{remaining}} <b>force</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> defend the airstrip. As {{this was not}} an Allied objective, the Japanese were not subjected to further attacks by ground troops other than occasional patrol clashes and ambushes. As a result of the supply shortages, many of the Japanese soldiers fell sick. Attempts to bring supplies in by sea from Gasmata were disrupted by U.S.Navy PT boats and the force lacked enough porters to supply itself through overland trails. Komori concluded that his force was serving no purpose, and on 8February informed his superiors that it faced destruction due to supply shortages. They responded by ordering Komori to hold his positions, though his force was awarded two Imperial citations in recognition of its supposed success in defending the airstrip.|$|E
25|$|Konbaung {{was only}} one among many other {{resistance}} forces, at Salin along the middle Irrawaddy and Mogaung in the far north, which had independently sprung up across panicked Upper Burma. Fortunately for the resistance forces, the Hanthawaddy command mistakenly equated their capture of Ava with the victory over Upper Burma, and withdrew two-thirds of the invasion <b>force</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Pegu, leaving just a third (less than 10,000 men) for what they considered a mop-up operation. Moreover, the Hanthawaddy leadership was concerned by the Siamese annexation of the upper Tenasserim peninsula (present-day Mon State) while Hanthawaddy troops were laying siege to Ava.|$|E

25|$|Although the Japanese were {{successful}} in pushing the Australian defenders back in the centre of their position on the track, heavy fighting on the flanks of the position blunted the Japanese attack, bringing it to a standstill. In the aftermath, the Australian commander, Brigadier Kenneth Eather, perceiving that the attack could not be held any further and that Ioribaiwa Ridge was unsuited to launching a counter-attack, withdrew his <b>force</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Imita Ridge. The Japanese, however, had reached the limit of their supply line and after the fighting around Ioribaiwa. Regardless, strategic factors and reverses elsewhere forced the Japanese commander, Major General Tomitaro Horii, to pursue a more defensive approach in Papua and New Guinea. As a result, in October the Japanese began to withdraw towards their beachheads Buna–Gona, with the Australians in pursuit.|$|E
25|$|The fleets resupplied {{and settled}} in to await {{the arrival of a}} large French fleet from Brest under Vice-Admiral Honoré Joseph Antoine Ganteaume. Unbeknownst to Villeneuve, Ganteaume was still being {{blockaded}} in Brest. The combined fleet achieved little while in the West Indies, managing only to capture the British-held Diamond Rock after two weeks of sitting idle at anchor. The small garrison surrendered on 2 June, by which time the frigate Didon had arrived with orders. Villeneuve was instructed to attack and capture the British colonies in the West Indies, before sailing his entire <b>force</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Europe, join Ganteaume at Brest and cover the invasion flotilla. Villeneuve gathered his forces and pressed northwards towards Antigua, but on 7 June he came across a lightly defended convoy of British merchants, and captured several of them the following day. From them he discovered that Nelson was in hot pursuit, and had arrived at Barbados. Villeneuve decided to break off operations and return to Europe. The fleet got underway on 11 June.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the more}} {{successful}} tactics employed by the Mongols was to wipe out urban populations that refused to surrender. In the Mongol invasion of Rus', almost all major cities were destroyed. If they chose to submit, the people were generally spared, though this was not guaranteed. For example, the city of Hamadan in modern-day Iran was destroyed and every man, woman, and child executed by Mongol general Subadai, after surrendering to him but failing to have enough provisions for his Mongol scouting force. Several days after the initial razing of the city, Subadai sent a <b>force</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the burning ruins and {{the site of the}} massacre to kill any inhabitants of the city who had been away {{at the time of the}} initial slaughter and had returned in the meantime. Mongolian armies made use of local peoples and their soldiers, often incorporating them into their armies. Prisoners of war sometimes were given the choice between death and becoming part of the Mongol army to aid in future conquests. In addition to intimidation tactics, the rapid expansion of the empire was facilitated by military hardiness (especially during bitterly cold winters), military skill, meritocracy, and discipline.|$|E

25|$|Villeneuve {{arrived at}} Fort de France, Martinique on 14 May, and was joined {{over the next}} two days by the Spanish under Gravina. Having resupplied, he settled in to await the arrival of Ganteaume, who unbeknownst to him was still sitting {{blockaded}} in Brest. Initially reluctant to undertake any large scale assaults on the British possessions in the Caribbean without orders, he was finally persuaded by the Governor of Martinique to attack the British held Diamond Rock after two weeks of sitting idle at anchor. The small garrison surrendered on 2 June, by which time the frigate Didon had arrived with orders. Villeneuve was instructed to await the arrival of two extra ships under Rear-Admiral René Magon, and then spend a month attacking and capturing the British colonies in the West Indies. He was then to sail his entire <b>force</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Europe, join Ganteaume at Brest and cover the invasion flotilla. The orders also noted that Nelson had sailed to Egypt in search of him. In fact Nelson was by now only two days away from Barbados, where he would anchor on 4 June. Villeneuve gathered his forces and pressed northwards towards Antigua, but on 7 June he came across a lightly defended convoy of British merchants, and captured several of them the following day. From them he discovered that Nelson had arrived at Barbados. A shocked Villeneuve decided to break off operations and head north and east again, back to Europe. The fleet got underway on 11 June, causing one of the army officers attached to the fleet, General Honoré Charles Reille to note We have been masters of the sea for three weeks with a landing force of 7000 to 8000 men and {{have not been able to}} attack a single island.|$|E
500|$|In mid-October {{and early}} November 1992, the HVO briefly cut the Brčko {{corridor}} south of Orašje two more times. In turn, the VRS launched a major offensive against the HVO-held bridgehead at Orašje. After some initial success, the VRS offensive failed and the HVO drove the attacking <b>force</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the positions they had held {{prior to the}} advance. Aiming to improve {{the security of the}} Brčko corridor, units of the VRS 1st Krajina and East Bosnian Corps turned south of Brčko, and advanced [...] against defences held by the HVO and the ARBiH. That last push widened the Brčko corridor to just 3kilometres at its narrowest point.|$|E
500|$|The French {{executed}} {{their plan}} with alacrity. Ferino pursued Fröhlich and the Prince Condé toward Villingen while Saint-Cyr chased the Kreistruppen into Rastatt. Latour and Sztáray {{tried to hold}} the line of the Murg River. The French employed 19,000 foot soldiers and 1,500 horsemen in the divisions of Taponier and Bourcier. The Austrian brought 6,000 men into action under the command of Karl Aloys zu Fürstenberg and Johann Mészáros von Szoboszló. The French captured 200 Austrians and three field pieces. On 5 July 1796, Desaix defeated Latour at the Battle of Rastatt by turning both his flanks, and drove his Imperial and Habsburg combined <b>force</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the Alb River. The Habsburg and Imperial armies did not have enough troops to hold off the Army of the Rhine and Moselle and would need reinforcements from Charles, who was occupied in the north keeping Jourdan pinned down on {{the west bank of the}} Rhine.|$|E

500|$|Elsewhere, {{while the}} Japanese and Australians were {{fighting}} around Isurava, the Japanese launched an amphibious landing around Milne Bay {{as part of}} a further seaborne attempt to support the overland drive on Port Moresby. Over the course of a fortnight, the Japanese landing was repulsed in an action that came to be seen as first [...] "full-scale defeat [...] on land". The effect of the defeat around Milne Bay and fighting at Guadalcanal was felt by the Japanese on the Kokoda Track. An order to assume defensive operations and to withdraw towards Kokoda was sent to Horii on 8 September. The situation on Guadalcanal worsened for the Japanese and further resources and manpower were diverted to that effort instead. The Japanese supply line along the Kokoda Track was stretched thin by this time. Rations were running low, and the Japanese troops in the forward areas were tired and hungry. Nevertheless, in early September Horii continued his advance south with a further action being fought around Ioribaiwa, around [...] from Port Moresby. From there the Australians withdrew to their final defensive line around Imita Ridge. But there was no climactic battle at Imita Ridge, as Horii finally cancelled his offensive on 14 September and began withdrawing north to shorten his line of communication and bring supplies forward for his troops to regain their strength. On 23 September, the Japanese 17th Army ordered the withdrawal of part of Horii's <b>force</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the beachheads around Buna. Five days later, the Australians began tentative moves forward of Imita Ridge. Finding Ioribaiwa abandoned, they began their pursuit of the Japanese that were withdrawing north. Further actions were fought at Templeton's Crossing and around Oivi and Gorari throughout October, with the latter concluding on 11 November. The Japanese withdrew across the Kumusi River to their beachheads around Buna and Gona, which was the scene of heavy fighting in late 1942 and early 1943. [...] In crossing the Kumusi, they were to lose most of their artillery.|$|E

Bonaparte left Masséna and one of Meynier's brigades to hold Dego and ordered Laharpe back to Carcare.|$|E
2500|$|The attack failed, {{sending the}} {{thoroughly}} defeated <b>force</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Shanghai.

The enemy was <b>forced</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> its first line of defense and being given no time <b>to</b> rally was <b>forced</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> its second line. Here it made a stand and, by desperate fighting, prevented the 62nd New York's further advance.|$|R
2500|$|The Thirty, {{seeking to}} {{dislodge}} this threat, marched out to attack Phyle, but, {{after an initial}} assault was repulsed, a snowstorm drove the <b>force</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Athens.

[...] The Thirty dispatched the Spartan garrison of Athens, along with an Athenian cavalry force, to keep a watch on Phyle and prevent the exiles from raiding the countryside.|$|E

2500|$|Chauvel {{continued}} the attacks against these greatly superior Ottoman forces, despite heavy casualties {{that could not}} hope to be replaced due to the strategic priority of the proposed Hareira and Sheria attacks. His force also experienced supply difficulties. The horses deployed in the area had only a small ration of [...] "pure grain", as no grazing was available, and water was barely sufficient in Beersheba for the troops actually in the town. Despite these difficulties, hard fighting failed to push Chauvel's <b>force</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Beersheba.|$|E

2500|$|After {{the attack}} by Bendix's men, Peirce pulled his <b>force</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> {{south of the}} New Market Bridge, a counter-march of about [...] to assess the {{situation}} and to await an expected further Confederate attack in a more advantageous position. To the dismay of all, it was soon discovered that Bendix had opened fire with muskets and an artillery piece on the 3rd New York Infantry and the commanding general's party, wounding 21 men (two mortally) and causing dozens of other men to flee the field. At this time, the colonels of various regiments, in particular Duryea and Washburn, advised Peirce to call off the operation. However, Butler's aides, Major Winthrop and Captain Haggerty, urged Peirce to move forward, and he chose {{to continue with the}} attack.|$|E
2500|$|Through Ultra intercepts, the British also {{received}} Paulus′ report and Churchill, believing that one strong push would dislodge German forces, began {{to increase the}} pressure on General Wavell to attack. Wavell quickly prepared Operation Brevity, a limited operation {{with the intention of}} seizing Sollum, the Halfaya Pass and Fort Capuzzo, then continuing to advance on to Sidi Aziez and towards Tobruk as far as supply would allow, while not risking the forces committed; its objective was to destroy as much Axis equipment as possible and secure a foothold for the larger Operation Battleaxe to be launched once the new tanks were made available. Brevity began on 15 May and [...] Fort Capuzzo and Halfaya Pass were captured but next day William Gott, concerned that his 22nd Guards Brigade would be wiped out if caught in the open should the Germans attack with tanks, decided to pull almost the entire <b>force</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Halfaya Pass and the operation officially ended on 17 May, with only the Halfaya Pass captured. The pass was retaken by a small German force on 27 May, in Operation Skorpion.|$|E
2500|$|After Kurita's force {{began to}} withdraw, Halsey ordered TF 38 to steam north to {{intercept}} the aircraft carriers of the Northern Force, commanded by Vice Admiral Jisaburō Ozawa. Bogan correctly perceived that Ozawa's force {{was intended to}} lure TF 38 away from the landing area to allow Kurita to attack it, but Halsey overruled him and several other Task Group commanders who voiced similar concerns. Early on 25 October, aircraft from Intrepid and the other carriers launched a strike on the Japanese carriers. Aircraft from Intrepid scored hits on the carrier [...] and possibly the carrier [...] Further strikes throughout the morning resulted in the sinking of four Japanese aircraft carriers and a destroyer in the Battle of Cape Engaño. Halsey's preoccupation with the Northern Force allowed Kurita the respite he needed to turn his <b>force</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the east, push through the San Bernardino Strait, where it engaged the light forces of escort carriers, destroyers, and destroyer escorts that were directly covering the landing force in the Battle off Samar. Kurita nevertheless failed {{to break through the}} American formation, and ultimately broke off the attack.|$|E
