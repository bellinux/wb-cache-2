It is replenished perennially by a process of underwater melting of the adjacent glacier ice. It is also stated that the lake existed during the Holocene period when it emerged from a melt-water pond.|$|E

Potentially, complex life may have evolved before these glaciations, and been wiped out. However, the diversity of life in modern Antarctica has sparked disagreement over whether cold temperatures increase or decrease the rate of evolution.|$|E

40|$|The {{perennial}} <b>ice</b> <b>covered</b> lakes of the Antarctic {{are considered}} to be excellent analogues to lakes that once existed on Mars. Field studies of <b>ice</b> <b>covered</b> lakes, paleolakes, and polar beaches were conducted in the Bunger Hills Oasis, Eastern Antarctica. These studies are extended to the Dry Valleys, Western Antarctica, and the Arctic. Important distinctions were made between <b>ice</b> <b>covered</b> and non-ice covered bodies of water in terms of the geomorphic signatures produced. The most notable landforms produced by <b>ice</b> <b>covered</b> lakes are <b>ice</b> shoved ridges. These features form discrete segmented ramparts of boulders and sediments pushed up along the shores of lakes and/or seas. Sub-ice lakes have been discovered under the Antarctic ice sheet using radio echo sounding. These lakes occur in regions of low surface slope, low surface accumulations, and low ice velocity, and occupy bedrock hollows. The presence of sub-ice lakes below the Martian polar caps is possible.

25|$|Coastal regions on the {{northern}} half of Greenland experience winter temperatures similar to or slightly warmer than the Canadian Archipelago, with average January temperatures of −30°C to −25°C (−22°F to −13°F).

25|$|The snowball Earth {{hypothesis}} {{was originally devised}} to explain geological evidence for the apparent presence of glaciers at tropical latitudes. According to modelling, an ice-albedo feedback would result in glacial ice rapidly advancing to the equator once the glaciers spread to within 25° to 30° of the equator. Therefore, the presence of glacial deposits within the tropics suggests global <b>ice</b> <b>cover.</b>|$|E
25|$|The <b>ice</b> <b>cover</b> {{exhibits}} {{much greater}} regional-scale interannual variability {{than it does}} hemispherical. For instance, {{in the region of}} the Sea of Okhotsk and Japan, maximum ice extent decreased from 1.3 million km2 in 1983 to 0.85 million km2 in 1984, a decrease of 35%, before rebounding the following year to 1.2 million km2. The regional fluctuations in both hemispheres are such that for any several-year period of the satellite record some regions exhibit decreasing ice coverage while others exhibit increasing <b>ice</b> <b>cover.</b> The overall trend indicated in the passive microwave record from 1978 through mid-1995 shows that the extent of Arctic sea ice is decreasing 2.7% per decade. Subsequent work with the satellite passive-microwave data indicates that from late October 1978 through the end of 1996 the extent of Arctic sea ice decreased by 2.9% per decade while the extent of Antarctic sea ice increased by 1.3% per decade. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change publication Climate change 2013: The Physical Science Basis stated that sea ice extent for the Northern Hemisphere showed a decrease of 3.8% ± 0.3% per decade from November 1978 to December 2012.|$|E

25|$|In the 1960s, Mikhail Budyko, a Russian climatologist, {{developed}} a simple energy-balance climate model {{to investigate the}} effect of <b>ice</b> <b>cover</b> on global climate.
