50|$|Benefits {{of control}} and reduced {{hospital}} admission have been reported. However, patients on oral medication who do not self-adjust their drug dosage will miss many {{of the benefits of}} self-testing, and so it is questionable in this group. This is particularly so for patients taking monotherapy with metformin who are not at risk of hypoglycaemia. Regular 6 monthly laboratory testing of HbA1c (<b>glycated</b> <b>haemoglobin)</b> provides some assurance of long-term effective control and allows the adjustment of the patient's routine medication dosages in such cases. High frequency of self-testing in type 2 diabetes has not been shown to be associated with improved control. The argument is made, though, that type 2 patients with poor long term control despite home blood glucose monitoring, either have not had this integrated into their overall management, or are long overdue for tighter control by a switch from oral medication to injected insulin.|$|E

40|$|Background: Estimation of <b>glycated</b> <b>haemoglobin</b> and {{fructosamine}} in diabetic {{patient for}} the assessment of glycemic control isgaining importance now a day. Little data is available about assessment of fructosamine in our area. Hence the present study was undertaken to know the levels of fructosamine in diabetic patients. Material and Methods: Total 150 subjects were involved in present study and divided into two groups. Out of 150 subjects 50 were healthy subjects and 100 type II diabetes mellitus patients. In all subjects, fasting blood glucose level, postprandial blood glucose level, <b>glycated</b> <b>haemoglobin</b> and fructosamine were measured. Results: Fasting and post prandial blood glucose was significantly increased in diabetic patient as compared to healthy controls (P < 0. 001). Moreover, the <b>glycated</b> <b>haemoglobin</b> and fructosamine levels were significantly increased in diabetic patient (P < 0. 001). However, when these parameters were used to see the difference between males and females, there was no statistical difference seen.

40|$|International audienceAlthough {{disruption}} of glucose homeostasis is {{a hallmark of}} ageing in humans and laboratory model organisms, we have little information {{on the importance of}} this process in free-living animals. Poor control of blood glucose levels leads to irreversible protein glycation. Hence, levels of protein glycation are hypothesized to increase with age and to be associated with a decline in survival. We tested these predictions by measuring blood <b>glycated</b> <b>haemoglobin</b> in 274 adult collared flycatchers of known age and estimating individual probability of recapture in the following 2 years. Results show a strong decrease in <b>glycated</b> <b>haemoglobin</b> from age 1 to 5 years and an increase thereafter. Individuals with high levels of <b>glycated</b> <b>haemoglobin</b> had a lower probability of recapture, even after controlling for effects of age and dispersal. Altogether, our findings suggest that poor control of glucose homoeostasis is associated with lower survival in this free-living bird population, and that the selective disappearance of individuals with the highest glycation levels could account for the counterintuitive age-related decline in <b>glycated</b> <b>haemoglobin</b> in the early age categories...|$|E
40|$|Forty-two non-diabetics whose <b>glycated</b> <b>haemoglobin</b> levels {{could not}} be {{explained}} by their levels of fasting glycaemia or glucose tolerance were identified {{as part of the}} Islington Diabetes Survey. Mean <b>glycated</b> <b>haemoglobin</b> levels that were high relative to their blood glucose levels (HIGH GLYCATORS) were found in 22 subjects whilst 20 subjects had low relative levels (LOW GLYCATORS). A repeat glucose tolerance test in 13 of the 42 subjects (7 high and 6 low glycators) showed that they remained categorised in the two groups four years after the discrepancy was identified. Mean blood glucose levels calculated from two 5 -point diurnal profiles also failed to explain the <b>glycated</b> <b>haemoglobin</b> levels in the two groups. Further biochemical and haematological tests revealed that glycated albumin showed a better relationship with blood glucose levels than did <b>glycated</b> <b>haemoglobin.</b> Intra-erythrocyte glucose concentrations were significantly lower than the plasma glucose in the low glycators, whilst the levels of erythrocyte 2, 3 -diphosphoglycerate (a known catalyst of glycation) were significantly higher in the high glycators. These findings may partially explain the original discovery of low and high glycators. The effects of high fibre/low glucose and high glucose/low fibre diets on glycated proteins were studied in normal subjects. Only glycated albumin levels changed significantly, probably due to small changes in plasma glucose occurring on each diet, which were not mirrored by similar changes in the erythrocyte. When another group of normal subjects received 1 g vitamin C daily for three months, significant reductions in glycated albumin and <b>glycated</b> <b>haemoglobin</b> were observed, with the former being reduced to a greater extent. This suggests that vitamin C has the potential of being used therapeutically to reduce glycation. In conclusion, for normal subjects, glycated albumin is a more reliable indicator of blood glucose control than <b>glycated</b> <b>haemoglobin...</b>|$|E

Measurements of <b>glycated</b> <b>haemoglobin</b> by elec-troendosmotic and chromatographic methods, fructos-amine, and fructosamine:albumin ratio {{were made}} in 91 non-diabetic {{subjects}} with chronic renal failure managed conservatively (« = 25), by continuous ambulatory perito-neal dialysis (M = 22), by haemodialysis (« = 22), or by renal transplantation (w = 22). Results were compared with those in a control group of 43 non-diabetic subjects with normal renal function.

40|$|<b>Glycated</b> <b>haemoglobin</b> levels (HbA 1 and HbA 1 c) are {{established}} parameters of long-term glycaemic control in diabetic patients. Depending on the method used, fetal haemoglobin {{interferes with the}} assays for <b>glycated</b> <b>haemoglobin.</b> If present in high amounts, fetal haemoglobin may lead to overestimation of <b>glycated</b> <b>haemoglobin</b> levels, and therefore, of average blood glucose concentration in diabetic patients. Glycated (HbA 1 c) and fetal haemoglobin levels were measured by high pressure liquid chromatography in 60 (30 female) adult Type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetic patients of Swiss descent, and were compared with levels obtained from 60 normal, non-diabetic control subjects matched for age and sex. Fetal haemoglobin levels were significantly higher in the diabetic patients (0. 6 +/- 0. 1 %, mean +/- SEM; range: 0 - 3. 6 %) than in the control subjects (0. 4 +/- 0. 1 %, p or = 0. 6 %) were found in 23 of 60 diabetic patients (38 %) compared to 9 of 60 control subjects (15 %; chi 2 = 8. 35, p < 0. 01). In addition, fetal haemoglobin levels in diabetic patients are weakly correlated with <b>glycated</b> <b>haemoglobin</b> (HbA 1 c) (r = 0. 38, p < 0. 01). Fetal haemoglobin results were confirmed with the alkali denaturation procedure, and by immunocytochemistry using a polyclonal rabbit anti-fetal haemoglobin antibody. A significant proportion of adult patients with Type 1 diabetes has elevated fetal haemoglobin levels. In certain patients this {{may lead to a}} substantial over-estimation of <b>glycated</b> <b>haemoglobin</b> levels, and consequently of estimated, average blood glucose levels.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Evidence {{suggests}} that variations in fasting glucose and insulin amongst those without frank {{type 2 diabetes}} mellitus are important determinants of cardiovascular disease. However, {{the relative importance of}} variations in fasting insulin, glucose, and <b>glycated</b> <b>haemoglobin</b> as risk factors for cardiovascular disease in women without diabetes is unclear. Our aim was to determine the independent associations of fasting insulin, glucose, and <b>glycated</b> <b>haemoglobin</b> with coronary heart disease and stroke in older women. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We undertook a prospective cohort study of 3, 246 British women aged 60 - 79 y, all of whom were free of baseline coronary heart disease, stroke, and diabetes, and all of whom had fasting glucose levels below 7 mmol/l. Fasting insulin and homeostasis model assessment for insulin sensitivity (HOMA-S) were linearly associated with a combined outcome of coronary heart disease or stroke (n = 219 events), but there was no association of fasting glucose or <b>glycated</b> <b>haemoglobin</b> with these outcomes. Results were similar for coronary heart disease and stroke as separate outcomes. The age, life-course socioeconomic position, smoking, and physical activity adjusted hazard ratio for a combined outcome of incident coronary heart disease or stroke per one standard deviation of fasting insulin was 1. 14 (95 % CI 1. 02 - 1. 33). Additional adjustment for other components of metabolic syndrome, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, fasting glucose, and <b>glycated</b> <b>haemoglobin</b> had little effect on this result. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that in women in the 60 - 79 y age range, insulin resistance, rather than insulin secretion or chronic hyperglycaemia, is a more important risk factor for coronary heart disease and stroke.

40|$|Abstract Background High {{consumption}} of fish carries a {{lower risk of}} cardiovascular disease {{as a consequence of}} dietary omega- 3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (n- 3 PUFA; especially EPA and DHA) content. A controversy exists about the component/s responsible of these beneficial effects and, in consequence, which is the best proportion between both fatty acids. We sought to determine, in healthy Wistar rats, the proportions of EPA and DHA that would induce beneficial effects on biomarkers of oxidative stress, and cardiovascular disease risk. Methods Female Wistar rats were fed for 13  weeks with 5 different dietary supplements of oils; 3 derived from fish (EPA/DHA ratios of 1 : 1, 2 : 1, 1 : 2) plus soybean and linseed as controls. The activities of major antioxidant enzymes (SOD, CAT, GPX, and GR) were determined in erythrocytes and liver, and the ORAC test was used to determine the antioxidant capacity in plasma. Also measured were: C reactive protein (CRP), endothelial dysfunction (sVCAM and sICAM), prothrombotic activity (PAI- 1), lipid profile (triglycerides, cholesterol, HDLc, LDLc, Apo-A 1, and Apo-B 100), <b>glycated</b> <b>haemoglobin</b> and lipid peroxidation (LDL-ox and MDA values). Results After three months of nutritional intervention, we observed statistically significant differences in the ApoB 100 /ApoA 1 ratio, <b>glycated</b> <b>haemoglobin,</b> VCAM- 1, SOD and GPx in erythrocytes, ORAC values and LDL-ox. Supplementation with fish oil derived omega- 3 PUFA increased VCAM- 1, LDL-ox and plasma antioxidant capacity (ORAC). Conversely, the ApoB 100 /ApoA 1 ratio and percentage <b>glycated</b> <b>haemoglobin</b> decreased.
