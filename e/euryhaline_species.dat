2500|$|The {{water quality}} of the lake varies widely during various seasons [...] summer, premonsoon, monsoon and postmonsoon [...] as the depth and width of the lake mouth varies causing a dynamic {{situation}} of mixing and circulation of waters. The resultant salinity variation and DO (dissolved oxygen) affects the primary production, plankton, biodiversity and fisheries in this lake. Salinity values vary from zero during the monsoon to about 52,000 ppm (hyper saline) during post and premonsoon seasons. Adjustment to this wide variation is difficult for sessile and sedentary species in the lake. However, <b>euryhaline</b> <b>species</b> still dwell in the lake. The benthic or the bottom habitat of this lagoon is classified into three zones. The southern zone, the first zone, is dominated by sand with some admixture of mud. The second zone at the northern region is wholly muddy. The third zone with sand and mud in equal parts is overgrown with patches of weeds and {{is reported to be}} rich in benthic biodiversity. Toxicity levels of heavy metals such as magnesium, lead, zinc, nickel, cadmium, aluminum and copper and chemicals such as ammonia, sulphate and fluoride in the lake are well within permissible limits.|$|E

40|$|Fourteen {{species of}} subtidal macrobenthos present in {{thirteen}} Eastern Cape estuaries, South Africa, {{were compared with}} regard to correlations with two important environmental variables (salinity and sediment mud content).

Although most species exhibited wide tolerance ranges to both environmental variables, preference ranges could be identified in many cases. Among the fourteen species studied, three were found mostly at high salinities, two were confined to sandy substratum, and four showed a clear preference for muddy sediment. The crab Paratylodiplax algoense was identified as a <b>euryhaline</b> marine <b>species</b> and the larvae of chironomid midges, previously believed to be oligohaline species, were found to be tolerant to near-seawater salinities.

50|$|The River Thames {{flowing through}} London {{is a classic}} river estuary. The town of Teddington a few miles west of London marks the {{boundary}} between the tidal and non-tidal parts of the Thames, although it is still considered a freshwater river about as far east as Battersea insofar as the average salinity is very low and the fish fauna consists predominantly of freshwater species such as roach, dace, carp, perch, and pike. The Thames Estuary becomes brackish between Battersea and Gravesend, and the diversity of freshwater fish species present is smaller, primarily roach and dace; <b>euryhaline</b> marine <b>species</b> such as flounder, European seabass, mullet, and smelt become much more common. Further east, the salinity increases and the freshwater fish species are completely replaced by euryhaline marine ones, until the river reaches Gravesend, at which point conditions become fully marine and the fish fauna resembles that of the adjacent North Sea and includes both euryhaline and stenohaline marine species.

40|$|Mucosal and serum {{antibody}} {{responses were}} studied in sibling barramundi (Lates calcarifer) acclimated in either seawater or freshwater following vaccination by intraperitoneal injection or direct immersion in an inactivated Streptococcus iniae vaccine. As expected, route of vaccination had a marked effect on immune response, with direct immersion {{resulting in low}} serum antibody levels against S. iniae by ELISA detected 21 days post vaccination at 26 degrees C, whilst a significant response was detected in mucus. A strong specific antibody response was detected in both mucus and serum 21 days following intraperitoneal injection. Fish acclimated in seawater prior to vaccination showed a markedly higher specific mucosal antibody response than sibling fish acclimated in freshwater, regardless of the route of vaccination, whilst the serum antibody response was not affected by salinity. Both mucosal and serum antibodies from fish in seawater and freshwater were capable of binding antigen at salinities similar to full strength seawater in a modified ELISA assay. These results indicate that this <b>euryhaline</b> fish <b>species</b> is riot only able to mount significant specific antibody response in cutaneous mucus, but that these antibodies will function in the marine environment.

40|$|ABSTRACT The electrosensory {{system on}} {{elasmobranchs}} consists of subcutaneous electroreceptor organs known as ampullae of Lorenzini. The present {{study investigated the}} ampullae of Lorenzini morphology of the lesser guitarfish Zapteryx brevirostris, using light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The pore number found in the ventral skin surface {{is much higher than}} that found in the dorsal portion, characteristic of species that inhabit the euphotic zone. Under light microscopy it was possible to observe that the wall canal consists of a single layer of squamous epithelial cells. The canal features distal expansion, where the ampullae are located with up to six alveoli. The sensory epithelium of ampullae is composed by cubic cells, with oval nucleus, restricted to the interior of the alveoli. With analysis the clusters under scanning electron microscopy, it was possible to observe the structure and the random arrangement of individual ampullae, canals and nerves. The distribution of dorsal and ventral pores and ampullae in Z. brevirostris resembled those of the same family. The number of alveoli per ampullae was similar to that found in <b>euryhaline</b> elasmobranchs <b>species,</b> suggesting that the morphological organization in Z. brevirostris is linked to its possible evolutionary transitory position among batoids...|$|R

40|$|Crepidula fornicata (Linné 1758) is {{a marine}} {{gastropod}} {{belonging to the}} family Calyptraeidae (Blainville 1824). Hoagland (1977), in her systemat-ic study of the family, suggested retaining this com-monly-used term rather than the family name Crepidulidae (Fleming 1822) which refers only to the genus Crepidula (Lamarck 1799). This benthic gastropod, which is commonly called slipper limpet, bears a calcareous and slightly spiralled shell about 6 cm long. It is a suspension-feeder, filtering phytoplankton and particulate organic matter. This feeding mode allows it to find sufficient food to develop large populations, unlike other grazing patellids (Hoagland, 1977). Along European coasts, this species is an oyster pest. It is generally found on the coastal infralittoral grounds, but stranded populations can be observed on {{the lower part of}} certain exposed shores.

40|$|Two and a {{half years}} of data were {{collected}} from the Great Fish River and estuary using seine nets and gill nets to determine the fish species composition within these regions. The head region of the Great Fish River estuary was found to have a rich fish fauna, with the euryhaline marine fish component totally dominating the catch in all three regions. Gilchristella aesiuaria was the single most common <b>species</b> and several <b>euryhaline</b> marine <b>species</b> were captured in freshwater for the first time. Physical parameters were also measured in an effort to ascertain the possible factors which may affect the distribution and length frequency of the most common species within this area. Salinity was found to be the single most important factor affecting the species composition, and the sampling area was consequently divided into three regions, viz. river (4 ‰). In addition, it was determined that river flow rate during the month prior to sampling also had a profound effect on species composition in all three regions.

40|$|Recent {{studies on}} sexual {{isolation}} among <b>euryhaline</b> Brachionus <b>species</b> suggest {{that differences in}} the molecular structure of a mate recognition pheromone (MRP) are important in maintaining reproductive isolation. It has not been clarified whether environmental conditions can affect MRP structure and the responsiveness. The objective {{of this study was}} to examine the effect of temperature on mate recognition of the rotifer B. plicatilis. Three strains (Russian, German, and Tokyo) of B. plicatilis were cultured on Nannochloropsis oculata and a series of intra- and interstrain matings were made using female and male rotifers reared at three temperatures, 15, 20 and 25 ℃. Matings were conducted for nine combinations of treatments (3 strains x 3 temperatures). Temperature affected the attempted matings (frequency of circling behavior per male/female contact) differently among strains and sexes. Culture temperature of females affected the frequency of mating attempts. Male recognition of females occurred best at 20 ℃ for Russian strain. German strain males only recognized females when females were reared at less than 20 ℃. For Tokyo strain, however, rearing temperature of females did not affect mate recognition. MRP antibody binding did not correlate with the frequency of male mating attempts at each temperature...|$|R

40|$|Osmoregulation {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{fundamental}} and delicately controlled processes in <b>euryhaline</b> marine <b>species</b> like penaeid shrimp. Here we first report a cDNA encoding for the crustacean cardioactive peptide (CCAP) precursor cloned from the intestine of Pacific white shrimp, Litopenaeus vannamei, a prominent commercial culture species. The CCAP mature peptide (PFCNAFTGC-NH 2) is generated by post-translational processing and found to be highly comparable with its counterparts in insects and other crustaceans. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR reveals that L. vannamei CCAP (Lv-CCAP) mRNA is predominantly expressed in the brain and intestine. However, only the expression level of intestine-derived Lv-CCAP mRNA showed responsiveness to salinity changes in culture. The inducible expressed Lv-CCAP mRNA by transfer to high-salinity condition was continuous, while mRNA expression stimulated by transfer to low-salinity condition was transient. Functionally, the stimulatory effects of CCAP on heart rates in the shrimp cultured in low-and normal-salinity conditions were confirmed. Furthermore, injection of CCAP could up-regulate the freshwater tolerance of shrimp by increasing their survival rates. Our study, as a whole, provides new insights into hormone-regulated crustacean osmostasis and may prove instructive to the inland freshwater penaeid shrimp aquaculture.

40|$|European {{flounder}} (Platichthys flesus. L.) is a <b>euryhaline</b> flatfish <b>species</b> {{which can}} actively migrate towards {{and cope with}} low salinity environments. A laboratory experiment was undertaken to analyse the effect of salinity on condition and growth of metamorphosing European flounder. The working hypothesis was that flounder, which preferentially settle in low salinity habitats, would display accelerated development and/or enhanced growth and condition at lower salinities. The fish used in the experiment were in the late stages of metamorphosis. At {{the end of the}} 21  day laboratory rearing period no significant difference in ontogenetic development was found between exposures (salinity of 0, 10, 20 and 30). No significant differences in somatic growth rate, somatic condition or standard length were observed between treatments. There was no correlation between RNA:DNA ratio and somatic condition. Contrary to expectations, mean RNA:DNA ratios (measure of short-term well being) tended to increase with salinity and were significantly higher in the 30 salinity exposure compared to the 0 salinity exposure. The working hypothesis was, therefore, rejected. The results demonstrate that laboratory observations can fail to capture the complex ecological interactions at play in field environments. The preference for low salinity environments may be driven by other environmental factors such as predator/competition avoidance and food supply...|$|R
