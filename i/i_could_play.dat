25|$|The vibrato {{sound is}} incredible, {{and it took}} a long time. I put down the rhythm track on an Epiphone Casino through a Fender Twin Reverb without vibrato. Then we played the track back through four old Twins, one on each side. We had to keep all the amps {{vibrating}} in time to the track and each other, so we had to keep stopping and starting the track, recording it in 10-second bursts... I wish I could remember exactly how we did the slide part – not writing it down is one of the banes of my life! We did it in three passes through a harmonizer, set to some weird interval, like a sixth. There was a different harmonization for each pass. For the line in harmonics, I retuned the guitar so that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>play</b> it all at the 12th fret with natural harmonics. It's doubled several times.|$|E
500|$|The Max Weinberg 7 {{released}} a self-titled album in 2000 on Hip-O Records; Weinberg said {{he waited until}} then because [...] "I wanted to change my style of playing and hone my style before I committed to a record." [...] He was especially proud that the band had successfully backed Tony Bennett during a late 1990s appearance on Late Night: [...] "Two years ago if you'd asked me if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>play</b> with Tony Bennett, I would have said absolutely not. I'm not in his league. But we played with him the other night, and it was wonderful. We swung." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{one season}} outside the Premier League, Carrick felt {{compelled}} to leave the First Division, saying: [...] "the truth is I didn't feel <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>play</b> First Division football much longer." [...] He was linked with moves {{to a number of}} teams including Portsmouth, Arsenal, Everton, West Bromwich Albion and Crystal Palace before Tottenham Hotspur emerged as front-runners to sign him. On 20 August, a deal was agreed between West Ham and Tottenham for the transfer of Carrick subject to a medical. Four days later, the transfer was official as Carrick joined the club for around £3.5million after the passing of a medical. He made a goalscoring appearance for the Tottenham reserves, but his first team debut for the club was delayed after suffering an injury setback on 13 September. Carrick was assigned the number 23 shirt and made his Tottenham debut on 18 October as a substitute in a 1–0 defeat at Portsmouth.|$|E

500|$|Although {{they wanted}} to {{reproduce}} an older sound, Saadiq and Brunghardt also wanted to capture more of the bass and drum parts to add a louder, modern element to the mix. They applied a more basic approach to miking the instruments and utilizing the outboard gear, using a Neumann U 47 for guitars, alternating overhead microphones for Saadiq's drum kit, a combination of dynamic and condenser mics for the kit's bass drum, and Ampex tape machines for extra warmth to the kit. Brungardt used various standard mics for the snare drum to achieve a more solid cracking sound, rather than capturing the drum's overall tone. Their miking of the guitars' amps was adapted from The Complete Beatles Recording Sessions, and as Brungardt recounted, [...] "It really gave us warmth and character. It allowed the amp to breathe and we got the tones of the amp along with the room. For me, that really opened things up so that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>play</b> with the live room, using different reverbs to get a sound." [...] For Saadiq's bass, they used a DI unit to connect a microphone preamplifier, increased the gain on a plug-in for less compression, and adjusted the low-end tones with an equalizer plug-in.|$|E
500|$|Fresco {{approached}} Jonathan Slavin, {{with whom}} he had previously worked on the sitcom Andy Richter Controls the Universe, about playing the role of Phil. Being a fan of Slavin's work, he thought he'd be great for the role. Andrea Anders, whom Fresco previously enjoyed on The Class, and Malcolm Barrett were cast for the roles of Linda and Lem respectively. Portia de Rossi met with Fresco about the role of Veronica. Fresco assessed during their meeting that de Rossi was completely convinced that the role was perfect for her and that she was born to play it. He thought de Rossi nailed the role and cast her. When asked what drew her to the role, de Rossi replied, [...] "I'm really attracted to strong women." [...] De Rossi further went on to say, [...] "I kind of had to throw myself at [...] I told him I'd played this character who had similar qualities, very work driven, strong, insensitive, slightly chilly. I had to convince him <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>play</b> this character well and could play a character of this nature." [...] Jay Harrington was the first person Fresco met with when trying to cast someone as Ted Crisp. Although Fresco really liked Harrington, he decided to see more people before casting the role. After five weeks, Harrington was cast.|$|E
500|$|Similar to {{the process}} for Yield and Binaural, band members worked on {{material}} individually before starting the recording sessions together. According to Cameron, everyone in the band had [...] "four or five" [...] ideas coming into the sessions, and there was [...] "a lot to just kind of weed through and work on." [...] The band often recorded material intended to be demo recordings, but lead vocalist Eddie Vedder would come along and record his vocals afterwards, stating, [...] "I just sang it, that's the take." [...] Regarding the creative process, guitarist Stone Gossard said that while playing alone [...] "the anal-retentive side of you goes, 'I think <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>play</b> better.'", but when reuniting [...] "the entire band goes 'No, it's great as it is,' then you just get in the mood and embrace it." [...] Gossard stated that [...] "the process of letting go is constant in this band", adding that bandmembers would arrive with [...] "a clear idea of what a song is going to be" [...] but eschew for other musical ideas while discussing the song with the group. Riot Act was the first Pearl Jam album to feature Kenneth [...] "Boom" [...] Gaspar on Keyboards, most notably on the song [...] "Love Boat Captain". According to Gaspar, the song initially developed out of a jam session he had with Vedder in Hawaii shortly after the two first met. When they were done, Vedder asked Gaspar if he was [...] "ready to go to Seattle." [...] According to Gossard, bringing in Gaspar was about being [...] "open to new things," [...] while Vedder stated Gaspar [...] "was able to find his place" [...] and fit in easily with the band dynamics. Guitarist Mike McCready {{said that he had}} always wanted the band to feature keyboards.|$|E

500|$|Despite Hammond's best attempts, McCabe {{was able}} to gain the strike and runs came quickly. McCabe reached his century in 140 minutes and England {{declined}} to take the new ball while he was batting. By lunch, he and Barnett had added 67 in only 50 minutes, although the latter had made only 20 of these; the total was 6/261, with McCabe on 105. Having reached his century, McCabe lifted his scoring rate, scoring his last 132 runs in 95 minutes. Boundaries came much more readily and he took 44 runs from a three over spell by leg spinner Doug Wright. As {{he ran out of}} partners, he became more aggressive; in the last ten overs of his innings, he took 80% of the strike and hit 16 boundaries. He was the last man out, attempting to loft the spin of Verity, after a final wicket partnership with Leslie Fleetwood-Smith of 77 in 28 minutes, of which he scored 72. He finished with 232 from 235 minutes with 34 boundaries and one six, an innings in which Bradman summoned his players not to miss a ball, as [...] "they would never see anything like it again." [...] Bradman later said that McCabe [...] "held us all spellbound", and it was reported that the Australian captain trembled while watching the innings. While McCabe was at the crease, his partners contributed a total of only 58 runs, meaning that he had outscored them by a ratio of 4:1. Upon his return to the pavilion Bradman greeted him with the words: [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>play</b> an innings like that, I'd be a proud man, Stan". This has also been reported as Bradman saying [...] " [...] I wish I could bat like that". Bradman later wrote that [...] "Towards the end [...] I could scarcely watch the play. My eyes filled as I drank in the glory of his shots". It was regarded by English captains Arthur Gilligan and Bob Wyatt to be the best innings that they had ever witnessed, as did former England bowler Sydney Barnesregarded {{as one of the best}} of all timewho said that he would not have been able to stop McCabe. [...] Neville Cardus said that the innings was one of the greatest in Test history. Wisden reported that McCabe played [...] "an innings the equal of which has probably never been seen in the history of Test cricket; for the best part of four hours he maintained a merciless punishment of the bowling". McCabe’s biographer Jack McHarg said that the innings “was a sort of encyclopedia of attacking batsmanship, a triumph of character, technique and judgement”. Cardus said ...|$|E

2500|$|For {{the first}} time ever Danilova has brought in session musicians: Nick Johnson (drums, who {{is also a member of}} her live band), Sean McCann (viola, violin) and Ryan York (cello, double bass). [...] "I can't play violin or cello or {{stand-up}} bass, or drums. I can play keyboards, kind of. So all the keyboard parts I wrote and played, and then I would send the string parts that I had wrote on the keyboard to the string players and they would just mimic that. Same with the drums. I try to do as much as possible, still, but I wish <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>play</b> drums", she explained.|$|E

2500|$|The {{game was}} {{compared}} to Minecraft and DayZ, along with other games by Kotaku and IGN writers. Luke Plunkett (Kotaku) joked at how it's like playing a game where someone thought [...] "wow, wouldn't it be awesome if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>play</b> DayZ and Minecraft at the same time?". He noted {{the difficulty of the}} video game and again compared it to Minecraft and DayZ, saying the player will get used to the Game Over screen. Mitch Dyer (IGN) criticised Rust, saying it's a semi-broken game that's difficult to recommend due to the challenging and frustrating gameplay, but later in the review, Dyer said there were some moments that made the game unforgettable and more interesting than its inspiration.|$|E
2500|$|I kept {{up playing}} drums until I moved to London. I'd {{always wanted to}} be a good drummer and it's just ironic that I've turned out to be a bass player. The way I started playing bass was that when I arrived in London I was looking for a job, and the only place I could find one was in Macaris in Charing Cross Rd. I wanted to get {{something}} involved in music, and that seemed like a good place to be. But Macaris didn't sell drums, and so I lied and said <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>play</b> bass. They said, [...] "Fine, you sell the basses, and sweep up and get the coffees and whatever".|$|E
2500|$|After {{losing in}} the first round of the US Open to Maria Elena Camerin, Safina made three semifinals in the fall – in Luxembourg, the Tier I Moscow and Hasselt. In Moscow, she {{defeated}} world No. 1 Maria Sharapova in the quarterfinals, her first victory over a number one player. She also played a key role in Russia's victory against France in the Fed Cup, partnering Elena Dementieva to win the doubles rubber. Speaking in 2008, Safina stated: [...] "that was a great experience in my life [...] it also boosted my confidence because I showed <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>play</b> well even with the [...] crowd against me." [...] Safina finished the year ranked world No. 20, by far her highest finish.|$|E

In 1984, she won the Grammy Award for Best Ethnic or Traditional Recording, for the album Elizabeth Cotten Live, released by Arhoolie Records. When accepting the award in Los Angeles, her comment was, [...] "Thank you. I only wish I had my guitar so <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>play</b> a song for you all."
