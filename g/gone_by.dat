5|$|A weather system {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on September3. The {{disturbance}} was small and became unidentifiable within 24hours of formation. Satellite imagery indicated that the disturbance may have acquired a circulation on September7, but the circulation was <b>gone</b> <b>by</b> the next day. The remaining tropical wave moved into the Lesser Antilles on September11 and a reconnaissance aircraft was deployed. The aircraft found circulation; however, by the next day, only a strong wave was detected. Atmospheric conditions became more favorable for development, yielding lower wind shear near Hispaniola for several days. The system moved into this area as the latest Reconnaissance aircraft was deployed, declaring it a tropical depression on September13 near the Dominican Republic.|$|E

5|$|In 1994, {{an attempt}} was made to {{relocate}} the original quarry where A. fragillimus and other species had been found, using ground-penetrating radar in an attempt to image bones still buried in the ground. This attempt failed because the fossilized mudstone bones were the same density as the surrounding rock, making it impossible to differentiate the two. A study of the local topography also showed that the fossil-bearing rock strata was severely eroded, and probably was so at the time Lucas made his discovery of A. fragillimus, indicating {{that a majority of the}} skeleton was <b>gone</b> <b>by</b> the time the vertebra and femur were recovered.|$|E

5|$|There are {{currently}} an estimated 150 pirate {{radio stations in}} the UK. A large proportion of these pirate radio stations operate in London, with significant clusters in Harlesden, Crystal Palace, Stoke Newington, Southwark and Lambeth. Set-up costs for pirate radio stations are minimal with a transmitter generally built by the engineer of the station. In days <b>gone</b> <b>by</b> these were powered by car batteries, but when the Pirates moved to tower blocks, the power came directly from the block room. Pirate radio stations may receive income from advertising and publicising events at nightclubs. DJs may pay to broadcast on pirate radio stations to gain public exposure.|$|E

5|$|There {{were still}} fine mediaeval screens {{in the church}} in 1810, {{possibly}} lost when repairs were done in 1813–16; they were <b>gone</b> <b>by</b> 1862. According to the History and Antiquities of the County of Cardigan (1810) by Sir Samuel Rush Meyrick: The chancel and north transept are separated {{from the rest of}} the church by light and elegant carved screens, which, from the elaborate workmanship they display, were probably erected about the time of Henry the Seventh. They are coloured red, green and yellow, and though once very brilliant, are now so covered with dirt as to be scarce perceptible.|$|E
5|$|Wildflowers bloom {{from early}} May to late September {{but most are}} <b>gone</b> <b>by</b> late August. Moisture from snow-melt along with some {{rainfall}} in late spring kick-starts the germination of annual plants, including wildflowers. Most of these plants complete their entire life cycle in the few months each year that moisture levels are good. The onset of summer decreases the number of wildflowers and by autumn only the tiny yellow flowers of sagebrush and rabbitbrush remain. Some wildflowers that grow {{in the area are}} the arrow-leaved balsamroot, bitterroot, blazingstar, desert parsley, dwarf monkeyflower, paintbrush, scorpionweed, scabland penstemon and the wild onion.|$|E
5|$|For {{many years}} in New South Wales, the wallum banksia had <b>gone</b> <b>by</b> the {{scientific}} name of Banksia serratifolia. Richard Anthony Salisbury had published this binomial name in 1796, which was followed by Otto Kuntze, and then Karel Domin in 1921. Botanist and banksia authority Alex George conclusively established aemula as the correct name {{to be used in}} his 1981 revision of the genus. He pointed out that Salisbury's original described the leaves only, was insufficient to diagnose the species and is hence a nomen dubium—the description could have fit juvenile leaves of B.paludosa as well. In fact, Brown himself had been unsure whether serratifolia applied to what he called Banksia aemula. Salisbury's taxon appeared as Banksia serraefolia in Knight's 1809 work On the cultivation of the plants belonging to the natural order of Proteeae, but that entry might also refer to serrata. Where Salisbury got his material is unclear, but John White had sent material to James Edward Smith now held in the Linnean Society marked as B.serratifolia Salisb. as well as B.aemula R.Br.|$|E

5|$|In 1540, Hernando de Alarcón and his fleet {{reached the}} mouth of the river, {{intending}} to provide additional supplies to Coronado's expedition. Alarcón may have sailed the Colorado as far upstream as the present-day California–Arizona border. Coronado never reached the Gulf of California, and Alarcón eventually gave up and left. Melchior Díaz reached the delta in the same year, intending to establish contact with Alarcón, but the latter was already <b>gone</b> <b>by</b> the time of Díaz's arrival. Díaz named the Colorado River Rio del Tizon ("Firebrand River") after seeing a practice used by the local natives for warming themselves. The name Tizon lasted for the next 200 years, while the name Rio Colorado ("Red River") was first applied to a tributary of the Gila River, possibly the Verde River, circa 1720. The first known map to label the main stem as the Colorado was drawn by French cartographer Jacques-Nicolas Bellin in 1743.|$|E
5|$|Instead of {{alerting}} the police, {{the family}} took the silencer to Boutflour's sister's home. Boutflour said it felt sticky.

A scientist at the Forensic Science Laboratory, Mr. Hayward, found blood on the inside and outside surface of the silencer, the latter not enough to permit analysis. The blood inside was found to be the same blood group as Sheila's, although {{it could have been a}} mixture of Nevill's and June's. A firearms expert, a Mr. Fletcher, said the blood was backspatter, caused by a close-contact shooting.|$|E
5|$|John Struthers {{was the son}} of Dr Alexander Struthers (1767–1853) and {{his wife}} Mary Reid (1793–1859). They lived in Brucefield, a large stone-built 18th century house with spacious grounds, which was then just outside Dunfermline; John was born in the house. Alexander was a wealthy mill owner and linen merchant. He bought Brucefield early in the 19th century, along with Brucefield Mill, a linen {{spinning}} mill built in 1792. Linen was threshed at the nearby threshing mill, and bleached in the open air near the house. There were still linen bleachers living in Brucefield House in 1841, but they had <b>gone</b> <b>by</b> 1851, leaving the house as the seat of the Struthers family. Mary's father, Deacon John Reid, was also a linen maker. Alexander and Mary were married in 1818; the marriage, though not warmly affectionate, lasted until Alexander's death despite the large age difference. Both Alexander and Mary are buried at Dunfermline Abbey.|$|E

5|$|On April 22, 1992, {{less than}} a year after her kidnapping, a man called the Contra Costa County Sheriff's Department from a gas station less than two miles from the Garridos' home. The caller {{reported}} that he saw Dugard in the gas station staring intently at a missing child poster of herself. The caller then reported seeing her leave in a large yellow van, possibly a Dodge. In 2009, after Dugard's release, an old yellow Dodge van was recovered from the Garrido property that matched the description of the van given in the call. The license plate was not reported in the 1992 call; the caller, the girl, and the van were <b>gone</b> <b>by</b> the time police arrived. The caller never identified himself, and the police did not pursue the matter any further. In contradiction to this story, Dugard reported that she never left the Garrido property from the day she was kidnapped until shortly before her first child was born in August 1994.|$|E
5|$|Stage 15 {{proved to}} be a crucial one, as the Tour entered Switzerland in a stage with many high {{mountain}} climbs. With about three kilometers <b>gone</b> <b>by</b> in an 8.8km final climb to Verbier, Contador attacked and got free of the leading group, that included Klöden and Armstrong, soloing to the line for the stage win and the yellow jersey. Armstrong said after the stage that he had given it everything he had in the climb and Contador was simply the stronger rider; it was seen as settling any lingering controversy over the squad's leader and protected rider. Contador all but cemented the Tour title by winning the time trial in Annecy in Stage 18, just beating out Cancellara to post the day's best time. Armstrong gained a little over a minute on Fränk Schleck by finishing 16th, and climbed back into a podium position, third, with the result. The two finished the Tour in those positions after holding them on Mont Ventoux, and then riding home safely in the Tour's largely ceremonial finale in Stage 21.|$|E
5|$|When {{formed in}} 1847, Sullivan County had no boroughs.
