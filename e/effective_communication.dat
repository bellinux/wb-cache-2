40|$|Background: Managers in {{project-based}} {{international organizations}} struggle {{to recognize the}} dynamics between work contexts, which in turn shape organizational climate and employee interactions. Accordingly, decentralized international organizations increasingly need to address internal communication gaps between headquarters and country-level offices to ensure long-term development. Purpose: <b>Effective</b> internal <b>communication</b> has been linked with supporting international management and enabling organizational outcomes including employee engagement and change management. Yet, few empirical studies focus on organizational climate and its relationship with <b>effective</b> internal <b>communication</b> within international organizations. Accordingly, this thesis explores the link between organizational climate, leadership and <b>effective</b> internal <b>communication</b> within one international organization, the United Nations Office for Project Services. Methods: A qualitative approach relying on a case-study strategy was used to probe which contextual aspects impacted the flow of <b>effective</b> internal <b>communication</b> within UNOPS. Qualitative data was collected from 12 semi-structured interviews with UNOPS personnel from eight different countries. In addition, direct observations and internal document analysis were integrated to enrich the findings. Results: The thesis argues that organizational climate significantly impacts <b>effective</b> internal <b>communication</b> within international organizations. The case study findings confirm a strong relationship between management leadership, the perception of organizational trust and people's willingness to engage in an open and clear manner. More importantly, <b>effective</b> internal <b>communication</b> was directly influenced by how consistent executive, senior and middle managers were with their actions and words. In addition, <b>effective</b> two-way <b>communication</b> was linked with the perceived clarity of roles. The thesis also supports that the internal communication criteria of relevance, clarity, sincerity, credibility and reciprocity as proposed by Zaremba (2006), Drucker (2007) and Marques (2010), are proportionately related to leadership. Furthermore, the findings show {{a positive relationship between}} <b>effective</b> internal <b>communication</b> and change management, as espoused by Kitchen & Daly (2002) and Bharadwaj (2014) ...|$|R

J. Heale, who finds that scholars now concur that Reagan rehabilitated conservatism, turned the nation to the right, practiced a considerably pragmatic conservatism that balanced ideology and the constraints of politics, revived faith in the presidency and in American exceptionalism, and contributed to victory in the Cold War.|$|E

However, according to the Canadian Patient Safety Institute, ineffective communication has the opposite effect as {{it can lead to}} patient harm. Communication with regards to patient safety can be classified into two categories: prevention of adverse events and responding to adverse events. Use of <b>effective</b> <b>communication</b> can aid in the prevention of adverse events, whereas ineffective communication can contribute to these incidences. If ineffective communication contributes to an adverse event, then better and more <b>effective</b> <b>communication</b> skills must be applied in response to achieve optimal outcomes for the patient's safety. There are different modes in which healthcare professionals can work to optimize the safety of patients which include both verbal and nonverbal communication, as well as the effective use of appropriate communication technologies.|$|E
