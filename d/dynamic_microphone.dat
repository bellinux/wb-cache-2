25|$|The <b>dynamic</b> <b>microphone</b> (also {{known as}} the moving-coil microphone) works via {{electromagnetic}} induction. They are robust, relatively inexpensive and resistant to moisture. This, coupled with their potentially high gain before feedback, makes them ideal for on-stage use.|$|E
25|$|The first {{cassette}} machines (e.g. the Philips EL 3300, {{introduced in}} August 1963) were simple mono-record and -playback units. Early machines required attaching an external <b>dynamic</b> <b>microphone.</b> Most units from the 1980s onwards also incorporated built-in condenser microphones, which have extended high-frequency response, {{but may also}} pick up noises from the recorder motor.|$|E
25|$|The newly invented Western Electric {{moving coil}} or <b>dynamic</b> <b>microphone</b> {{was part of}} the Wide Range System. It had a flatter audio {{response}} than the old style Wente condenser type and didn't require electronics installed in the microphone housing. Signals fed to the cutting head were pre-emphasized in the treble region to help override noise in playback. Groove cuts in the vertical plane were employed rather than the usual lateral cuts. The chief advantage claimed was more grooves per inch that could be crowded together, resulting in longer playback time. Additionally, the problem of inner groove distortion, which plagued lateral cuts, could be avoided with the vertical cut system. Wax masters were made by flowing heated wax over a hot metal disc thus avoiding the microscopic irregularities of cast blocks of wax and the necessity of planing and polishing.|$|E

40|$|Most {{contemporary}} high-end <b>microphones</b> are <b>dynamic</b> <b>microphones,</b> {{adopting the}} most basic electromagnetic transduction principles. This study investigated the diaphragm structures of <b>dynamic</b> <b>microphones.</b> The diaphragms were composed of polyimide material, and the boundary settings required for actual operation were provided using finite element model analysis software. The characteristic frequencies caused by grooving variations on the three-dimensional diaphragm were analyzed for the various groove shapes and number. The groove angles and width variations were examined based on the optimal groove shape selected in the aforementioned analysis, {{and the effects of}} these shapes were determined based on the analytical results. Acoustic waves cause thin films to vibrate, forming the working principle behind <b>dynamic</b> <b>microphones.</b> The thin film drives a coil to vibrate in a magnetic field and cuts the line of magnetic force, subsequently producing a voltage on both ends of the coil. This audio-frequency-inducted voltage represents an acoustic wave message. The finite element model analysis software was used to conduct electromagnetic induction simulations; the sound source was fed to the diaphragm to drive the coil. The coil vibrations caused the line of magnetic force to be cut, and the final voltages produced were examined and compared...|$|R

Brown engineered the group's previous albums, and later their subsequent output, including Raphael Wiggins' solo albums after Tony! Toni! Toné! Brown recommended for him to use a <b>dynamic</b> <b>microphone</b> when recording his vocals to thicken them with more bass, a practice Wiggins continued throughout his career. Wiggins sought after former Temptations vocalist Eddie Kendricks to sing on [...] "Leavin'", but Kendricks died prior to the sessions. They {{also worked with}} two horn sections, The Fat Lip Horns and The SNL Horns, the horn section of the Saturday Night Live Band. Raphael and D'wayne Wiggins sang impromptu musical ideas to the SNL players, who in turn modelled their horn parts after their singing.|$|E
500|$|Saadiq's studio {{integrated}} modern {{equipment such as}} a Pro Tools digital workstation and an SSL 9000 mixing console, and featured various vintage gear, including Saadiq's 1960s Ludwig drum kit and a kick-drum mic {{purchased from}} Abbey Road Studios. In the studio, Saadiq and Brungardt experimented with techniques and equipment. They wanted the songs to have slower [...] like older recordings, as producers in the past did not have advanced compressors, audio tools that manipulate the dynamic content of signals and affect certain sounds in a recording's mix. Their production applied tube preamps and tube compressors, with the former used as a front end for Pro Tools. For Saadiq's vocals, he used a Shure SM57 <b>dynamic</b> <b>microphone</b> to thicken and distort his voice and embellish his characteristically clean delivery, while Brungardt employed a compressor and a Pro Tools plug-in during the mix. Saadiq sought a certain [...] "edge" [...] for his vocals and an unpolished sonic element for the album. They also tried to record tracks onto cassette tapes {{in order to produce}} a grittier, older sound. Brungardt used a FilterBank plug-in when mixing the album to uncompress vocals and roll off high-end sound from tracks.|$|E
500|$|At Electric Lady, Badu {{applied a}} {{multifaceted}} approach to recording her vocals and opted against editing them in post-production. Using her voice impressionistically, her vocals {{were characterized by}} high scales, varied frequencies, wide intervals, and time-stretched harmonies. Chavarria, who engineered the vocals with Badu, remarked on her singing, [...] "Her voice has so many frequencies, from a subharmonic of her tonic to a thin raspiness, {{and she wants to}} hear all of that." [...] Badu used a Shure SM57 <b>dynamic</b> <b>microphone,</b> finding it to have enough bottom for her voice type, and cut vocal takes while situated between two speakers in the studio's control room with the monitor mix playing. She explained this setting to be more comfortable, noting the ability to hear herself sing and hold the microphone when moving around. Badu preferred to sing in one take rather than edit different takes together: [...] "When I do vocals, I am singing with a certain volume in my voice. I am singing the double and triple harmonies at different volumes. You don't have to adjust it; I have already done it. We mix as we go, so by the time we put the vocals to ½-inch tape, I know it. If you touch a damn thing, I will know it." ...|$|E

500|$|For the {{majority}} of the recordings, Saadiq played most of the instruments, including bass, keyboard, guitar, Mellotron, percussion, and drums, and he also layered each recorded instrumental part afterwards. Brungardt used a Neumann U 47 microphone to record each of Saadiq's instrument parts. Saadiq recorded his vocals on a <b>dynamic</b> <b>microphone</b> alone in the recording studio's control room, an approach encouraged to him earlier in his career by record producer and audio engineer Gerry Brown. According to Brungardt, [...] " [...] voice benefits from a dynamic mic because it tends to give him more bottom and presence. Plus dynamic mics can sound a little older when pushed". With the songs' guitar parts, Brungardt wanted to create additional distortion in order to produce a grittier guitar sound for the songs, a stylistic preference Saadiq and he had acquired from listening to a great deal of indie rock at the time. He applied several techniques to achieve this sound, including increasing the gain on Saadiq's Fender Twin guitar amplifier, using a software plug-in for the recordings in post-production, and re-amping Saadiq's guitar parts. In his interview for EQ Magazine, Brungardt discussed using a Massey TapeHead, one of his preferred plug-ins, in the recording process, stating [...] "I’ll use that {{on a lot of things}} to get a little more grit. It thickens stuff up nicely if you record something that’s a little too bright. I usually go a lot for darker tones when recording and mixing".|$|E
2500|$|Several {{different}} types of microphone are in use, which employ different methods to convert the air pressure variations of a sound wave to an electrical signal. [...] The most common are the <b>dynamic</b> <b>microphone,</b> which uses a coil of wire suspended in a magnetic field; the condenser microphone, which uses the vibrating diaphragm as a capacitor plate, and the piezoelectric microphone, which uses a crystal of piezoelectric material. [...] Microphones typically need {{to be connected to}} a preamplifier before the signal can be recorded or reproduced.|$|E
2500|$|A loudspeaker, a {{transducer}} {{that turns}} an electrical signal into sound waves, is the functional opposite of a microphone. Since a conventional speaker is constructed {{much like a}} <b>dynamic</b> <b>microphone</b> (with a diaphragm, coil and magnet), speakers can actually work [...] "in reverse" [...] as microphones. The resulting signal typically offers reduced quality including limited high-end frequency response and poor sensitivity. In practical use, speakers are sometimes used as microphones in applications where high quality and sensitivity are not needed such as intercoms, walkie-talkies or video game voice chat peripherals, or when conventional microphones are in short supply.|$|E
50|$|As a {{practical}} matter, phantom powering allows the same two-conductor shielded cables {{to be used}} for both <b>dynamic</b> <b>microphones</b> and condenser microphones, while being harmless to balanced microphones that aren't designed to consume it, since the circuit balance prevents any substantial DC from flowing through the output circuit of those microphones.|$|R

25|$|Some {{microphones}} {{are designed}} {{not to have}} their impedance matched by the load they are connected to. Doing so can alter their frequency response and cause distortion, especially at high sound pressure levels. Certain ribbon and <b>dynamic</b> <b>microphones</b> are exceptions, due to the designers' assumption of a certain load impedance {{being part of the}} internal electro-acoustical damping circuit of the microphone.|$|R
2500|$|The {{most widely}} used type of speaker in the 2010s is the dynamic speaker, invented in 1925 by Edward W. Kellogg and Chester W. Rice. [...] The dynamic speaker {{operates}} on the same basic principle as a <b>dynamic</b> <b>microphone,</b> but in reverse, to produce sound from an electrical signal. When an alternating current electrical audio signal is applied to its voice coil, a coil of wire suspended in a circular gap between the poles of a permanent magnet, the coil is forced to move rapidly back and forth due to Faraday's law of induction, which causes a diaphragm (usually conically shaped) attached to the coil to move back and forth, pushing on the air to create sound waves. Besides this most common method, there are several alternative technologies {{that can be used}} to convert an electrical signal into sound. The sound source (e.g., a sound recording or a microphone) must be amplified or strengthened with an audio power amplifier before the signal is sent to the speaker.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{directional}} {{patterns are}} produced by enclosing {{one side of the}} ribbon in an acoustic trap or baffle, allowing sound to reach only one side. The classic RCA Type 77-DX microphone has several externally adjustable positions of the internal baffle, allowing the selection of several response patterns ranging from [...] "figure-eight" [...] to [...] "unidirectional". Such older ribbon microphones, some of which still provide high quality sound reproduction, were once valued for this reason, but a good low-frequency response could be obtained only when the ribbon was suspended very loosely, which made them relatively fragile. Modern ribbon materials, including new nanomaterials have now been introduced that eliminate those concerns, and even improve the effective dynamic range of ribbon microphones at low frequencies. Protective wind screens can reduce the danger of damaging a vintage ribbon, and also reduce plosive artifacts in the recording. Properly designed wind screens produce negligible treble attenuation. In common with other classes of <b>dynamic</b> <b>microphone,</b> ribbon microphones don't require phantom power; in fact, this voltage can damage some older ribbon microphones. Some new modern ribbon microphone designs incorporate a preamplifier and, therefore, do require phantom power, and circuits of modern passive ribbon microphones, i.e., those without the aforementioned preamplifier, are specifically designed to resist damage to the ribbon and transformer by phantom power. Also there are new ribbon materials available that are immune to wind blasts and phantom power.|$|E

50|$|A {{velocity}} receiver (velocity sensor) is {{a sensor}} that responds to velocity rather than absolute position. For example, <b>dynamic</b> <b>microphones</b> are velocity receivers. Likewise, many electronic keyboards used for music are velocity sensitive, {{and may be}} said to possess a velocity receiver in each key. Most of these function by measuring the time difference between switch closures at two different positions along the travel of each key.|$|R
2500|$|The {{advantage}} of the ribbon microphone when introduced was that the light ribbon had a much higher natural resonant frequency than diaphragms in existing microphones, above hearing range, so it had flatter response at high frequencies. [...] The voltage output of older ribbon microphones is typically quite low compared to a <b>dynamic</b> moving coil <b>microphone,</b> and a step-up transformer is used to increase the voltage output and increase the output impedance. Modern ribbon microphones do not suffer from this problem due to improved magnets and more efficient transformers and have output levels that can exceed typical stage <b>dynamic</b> <b>microphones.</b>|$|R

In 1957, Oktava small telephones and moving coil radial loudspeakers were displayed in the Russian section at the 1958 exhibition in Brussels. In 1961 Oktava introduced the D2 miniature telephone and began supplying <b>dynamic</b> <b>microphones</b> to the Kremlin. The plant also commenced a second round of modernisation and began producing electro-acoustic measuring instruments to test microphones and telephones.|$|R

50|$|An {{example of}} {{balanced}} lines is {{the connection of}} microphones to a mixer in professional systems. Classically, both <b>dynamic</b> and condenser <b>microphones</b> used transformers to provide a differential-mode signal. While transformers are still used in {{the large majority of}} modern <b>dynamic</b> <b>microphones,</b> more recent condenser microphones are more likely to use electronic drive circuitry. Each leg, irrespective of any signal, should have an identical impedance to ground. Pair cable (or a pair-derivative such as star quad) is used to maintain the balanced impedances and close twisting of the cores ensures that any interference is common to both conductors. Providing that the receiving end (usually a mixing console) does not disturb the line balance, and is able to ignore common-mode (noise) signals, and can extract differential ones, then the system will have excellent immunity to induced interference.|$|R
