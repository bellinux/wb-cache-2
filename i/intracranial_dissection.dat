40|$|Spontaneous <b>intracranial</b> artery <b>dissection</b> is an {{uncommon}} and probably underdiagnosed cause of stroke that {{is defined by}} the occurrence of a haematoma in the wall of an intracranial artery. Patients can present with headache, ischaemic stroke, subarachnoid haemorrhage, or symptoms associated with mass effect, mostly on the brainstem. Although <b>intracranial</b> artery <b>dissection</b> is less common than cervical artery dissection in adults of European ethnic origin, <b>intracranial</b> artery <b>dissection</b> is reportedly more common in children and in Asian populations. Risk factors and mechanisms are poorly understood, and diagnosis is challenging because characteristic imaging features can be difficult to detect in view of the small size of intracranial arteries. Therefore, multimodal follow-up imaging is often needed to confirm the diagnosis. Treatment of <b>intracranial</b> artery <b>dissections</b> is empirical in the absence of data from randomised controlled trials. Most patients with subarachnoid haemorrhage undergo surgical or endovascular treatment to prevent rebleeding, whereas patients with <b>intracranial</b> artery <b>dissection</b> and cerebral ischaemia are treated with antithrombotics.

40|$|OBJECTIVES—To {{compare the}} {{diagnosis}} and prognosis of extracranial versus <b>intracranial</b> vertebral artery <b>dissections</b> without intracerebral haemorrhage.  METHODS—Twenty two vertebral artery dissections were defined by intra-arterial angiography and classified in two groups: group 1,nine extracranial dissections (seven patients) and group 2, 13 <b>intracranial</b> <b>dissections</b> (nine patients), involving the basilar artery in five cases. Bilateral dissections were found in 38 % of the population. Before angiography, all the patients had been investigated by continuous wave Doppler, colour coded Doppler, and transcranial Doppler. Mean follow up was 44 months.  RESULTS—The two most important symptoms of both dissections (81 % of patients) were unbearable pain preceding stroke and progressive onset of stroke within a few hours. Severe ultrasonic abnormalities were present in 94 % of the patients whereas specific ultrasonic signs (segmental dilation with eccentric channel) were rare (19 %) in both groups. Major strokes and brainstem strokes represented respectively 67 % and 78 % in intracranial versus 43 % and 29 % in extracranial dissections. Severe sequelae (permanent disabling motor or cerebellar deficit) were more often associated with intracranial (44 %) than with extracranial dissections (14 %). No recurrence of dissection and no cerebral haemorrhage were found under heparin. Significant factors of poor outcome (P< 0. 05) were the initial severity of the stroke and the bilateral location of dissections.  CONCLUSION—The combination of a pain and a progressive onset of the stroke, corroborated by ultrasonic findings, could have helped to recognise most {{of these types of}} <b>dissections.</b> <b>Intracranial</b> <b>dissections</b> have a poorer prognosis than extracranial dissections. ...|$|R

40|$|Dissection of {{vertebral}} arteries {{is increasingly}} being {{recognized as a}} cause of ischemic stroke and /or subarachnoid hemorrhage. Although head and neck trauma and primary diseases of arterial wall are predisposing factors, it can occur spontaneously. Headache and/ or neck pain with vertigo is important warning sign that may precede onset of stroke by several days. We described three patients with spontaneous vertebral artery dissection who had neck pain as presenting symptom. All patients had hypertension. Two of them (44 year-old male and 40 year- old female) had transient ischemic attack followed by stroke. 66 -year old male patient had subarachnoid hemorrhage due to <b>intracranial</b> <b>dissection</b> of vertebral artery.

40|$|Abstract Background Spontaneous {{carotid artery}} dissections have been rarely {{reported}} in children. Diagnosis {{has traditionally been}} confirmed by catheter arteriography. More recently diagnosis has been made by magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance angiography; however the sensitivity of these techniques {{has yet to be}} determined. The authors are unaware of reports of carotid dissection confirmed by dynamic computed tomography (computerized tomographic arteriography) in the young. Case presentation We recently evaluated a fourteen year-old male following the development of transient neurologic symptoms. There was no antecedent illness or trauma. Dynamic computed tomography revealed an <b>intracranial</b> <b>dissection</b> involving the supraclinoid segment of the left internal carotid artery (confirmed by catheter arteriography). Studies for vasculitis, pro-thrombotic states, and defects of collagen were negative. Conclusion Spontaneous carotid artery dissection is a potential cause of transient neurological symptoms and ischemic stroke in the pediatric population. Dynamic computed tomography appears to be a reliable diagnostic tool which can lead to early diagnosis. </p...|$|E

40|$|The authors {{developed}} a simple reproducible technique for aneurysm creation and adapted it to mimic <b>intracranial</b> <b>dissection</b> conditions using glue application as a pseudo-arachnoid type layer. Ten 1 - 2 -month-old healthy domestic swine were employed under general anesthesia. A novel technique for bifurcation aneurysm creation was developed using two arteries and a vein. After aneurysm creation, diluted sulfuric acid was applied on the dome with a micropipette to increase aneurysm fragility in selected zones. The surgical field was then dried and contact glue was applied around the vascular complex {{in a circular}} manner so as to emulate arachnoidal connection fibers. Microsurgical dissection of the aneurysm and surrounding vessels was performed by delicately removing the adhesive substance. Diverse aneurysm clipping techniques, emergency rupture situations and vascular reconstruction procedures were trained. Twenty-two aneurysms were created at several vascular sites, one aneurysm dome ruptured during application of sulfuric acid, two aneurysm models were proved to be thrombosed, two aneurysms ruptured during the dissection and no intraoperative deaths occurred. All aneurysms were clipped in an acceptable manner. This bifurcation aneurysm model provides a novel training system to be used not only by neurosurgeons but also by neurovascular interventionists...|$|E

40|$|Background: Compared {{to those}} found in the vertebrobasilar system, <b>intracranial</b> <b>dissection</b> in the {{anterior}} circulation is relatively rare, especially in the anterior cerebral artery (ACA). Moreover, only several cases of ACA dissection that underwent endovascular treatment have been reported. Here we present a rare case of gradually developing ACA dissecting aneurysm causing cerebral infarction, successfully treated by stent-assisted coil embolization. Case Description: A 36 -year-old man was admitted with sudden right hemiparesis. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) imaging showed cerebral infarction in the left ACA territory, and MR angiography showed segmental stenosis at the A 2 portion of the left ACA. Three-dimensional digital subtraction angiogram showed segmental dilatation and stenosis at the left A 2 portion. We diagnosed ACA dissection causing acute cerebral infarction and treated the patient conservatively. Five months after the onset, the dissecting artery at the left A 2 portion formed a gradually dilating aneurysm, suggesting increased risk for aneurysmal rupture. We attempted endovascular treatment entailing coil embolization of an aneurysm while preserving the left A 2 with stent assistance. The patient remained neurologically s[table 6] months after the procedure. Conclusions: Although there are few reported cases of ACA dissection where endovascular treatment was attempted, we consider stent-assisted embolization for gradually developing ACA dissecting aneurysm as an alternative method to prevent bleeding and recurrent infarction...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE - The {{widespread}} {{preference of}} anticoagulants over antiplatelets {{in patients with}} cervical artery dissection (CAD) is empirical rather than evidence-based. SUMMARY OF REVIEW - This article summarizes pathophysiological considerations, clinical experiences, and {{the findings of a}} systematic metaanalysis about antithrombotic agents in CAD patients. As a result, there are several putative arguments in favor as well as against immediate anticoagulation in CAD patients. CONCLUSIONS - A randomized controlled trial comparing antiplatelets with anticoagulation is needed and ethically justified. However, attributable to the large sample size which is required to gather meaningful results, such a trial represents a huge venture. This comprehensive overview may be helpful for the design and the promotion of such a trial. In addition, it could be used to encourage both participation of centers and randomization of CAD patients. Alternatively, antithrombotic treatment decisions can be customized based on clinical and paraclinical characteristics of individual CAD patients. Stroke severity with National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score ≥ 15, accompanying <b>intracranial</b> <b>dissection,</b> local compression syndromes without ischemic events, or concomitant diseases with increased bleeding risk are features in which antiplatelets seem preferable. In turn, in CAD patients with (pseudo) occlusion of the dissected artery, high intensity transient signals in transcranial ultrasound studies despite (dual) antiplatelets, multiple ischemic events in the same circulation, or with free-floating thrombus immediate anticoagulation is favored. © 2007 American Heart Association, Inc.

40|$|Abstract The aim of {{this study}} was to analyze {{angiographic}} findings and the presence and topography of cerebral ischemic and/or hemorrhagic lesions in cerebral CT or MRI, and to assess the long-term clinical outcome of a series of 136 consecutive cervicocephalic artery dissection (CCAD) patients. Pulsatile tinnitus was evaluated as a symptom of CCAD. Medical records and films were reviewed retrospectively. Irregular stenosis was found in angiography in 50 % and occlusion in 33 % of the dissected cervicocephalic arteries. Irregular stenosis normalized in 81 % and occlusion recanalized in 34 %. Other findings, such as pseudoaneurysms, intimal flaps, double lumens, and irregular dilatations were rare and often remained unchanged in follow-up. Pulsatile tinnitus was a presenting symptom in 12 % of the CCAD patients, but the majority of patients had concomitant head or neck pain, ischemic brain symptoms, Horner's syndrome, or cranial neuropathies. Of the 131 patients who underwent brain imaging, 73 (56 %) had signs of infarction in cerebral CT or MRI. Occlusion of the dissected vessel was accompanied by infarction in 76 %, irregular stenosis in 40 %, and other findings only rarely. Of the anterior circulation infarctions, 95 % (39 / 41) were territorial, subcortical, or territorial infarctions with fragmentation and could thus be considered embolic. Subarachnoid hemorrhage was found in CT in 5 of the 22 patients (23 %) with <b>intracranial</b> <b>dissection.</b> The patient's long-term clinical outcome was assessed using two methods: a classification into categories based on neurological symptoms and defects and the modified Rankin Scale (mRS). Of the 136 CCAD patients, 60 % recovered with no or mild disability and 79 % scored 0 – 2 on mRS. In the case of dissection of one or more cervicocephalic arteries without occlusion, the figures were 75 % and 89 %. In the case of occlusive dissection of one or more arteries, only about 35 % of the patients recovered well, having no or mild disability, and 61 % scored 0 – 2 on mRS. No significant differences were seen in recovery after intra- and extracranial dissections. In conclusion: irregular stenosis, which is the most common angiographic finding in CCAD, is associated with brain infarction less frequently than occlusion, and the long-term clinical outcome is good in most cases. Occlusion of the dissected vessel causes more brain infarctions, and only about 35 % of the patients recover well, having no or mild disability. More than 10 % of CCAD patients have pulsatile tinnitus as a presenting, and sometimes the only symptom...|$|E

Reliable epidemiological data on stroke incidence related to sCAD are scarce in Italy. This study aims to evaluate the incidence, clinical features, and outcome of cerebrovascular events related to sCAD and spontaneous <b>intracranial</b> arteries <b>dissections</b> (sIAD) in the city of Pisa (Italy). We retrospectively analyzed consecutive patients admitted between December 1997 and June 2015 with a diagnosis of stroke, TIA, or Bernard-Horner syndrome due to acute cervical or <b>intracranial</b> artery <b>dissection.</b> Considering that our hospital collects presumptively all patients hospitalized with sCAD coming from the referral geographical area, data may provide a good approximation to real incidence of sCAD in our population.

Interobserver agreement was assessed. Seventeen patients (mean age: 41 ± 10 [SD] years; 13 men) were diagnosed with definite dissection. The intimal flaps were more frequently detected on 3 D-PD (88. 2 %, 15 / 17) than on 3 D-iMSDE-T 1 (29. 4 %, 5 / 17), and post-contrast 3 D-iMSDE-T 1 (35. 3 %, 6 / 17; P = 0. 006 and P = 0. 004, respectively). No significant difference was found in the detection rate of intramural hematomas (59 - 71 %) and vascular dilatations (47 %) on each sequence. Interobserver agreement for detection of dissection findings showed almost perfect agreement (k = 0. 84 - 1. 00), except for detection of intimal flaps on pre-contrast 3 D-iMSDE-T 1 (k = 0. 62). After addition of 3 D-PD to pre- and post-contrast 3 D-iMSDE-T 1, more patients were diagnosed with definite dissection with the initial MRI (88. 2 % vs. 47. 1 %; P = 0. 039). The intimal flap might be better visualized on the 3 D-PD sequence than the 3 D-iMSDE-T 1 sequences, allowing diagnosis of definite dissection without follow-up imaging...|$|R
40|$|Background: Blunt {{cerebrovascular}} {{injury is}} an important cause {{of morbidity and mortality}} following head trauma. <b>Intracranial</b> vessel <b>dissections,</b> carotid-cavernous fistulae, and pseudo-aneurysms are uncommon traumatic vascular lesions with limited evidence to guide endovascular management. Case description: We describe the case of a sixteen year old male patient suffering a traumatic paraclinoidal internal carotid artery (ICA) dissection with carotid-cavernous fistula and ophthalmic artery pseudo-aneurysm. Repeat angiography demonstrated worsening dissection prompting an endovascular parent vessel sacrifice following a passed balloon test occlusion. Relevant imaging is included. Conclusions: Amongst new and developing stenting technologies as well as complex surgical solutions, utilizing a modern endovascular adaptation of simple Hunterian ligation to treat a complex multi-pronged pathology may in some cases represent the best available option. Given the limited published literature, our diagnostic and treatment approach may be informative to clinicians as well as inform an evidence based management approach in similar complex intracranial vascular injuries...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY The {{clinical}} pathological {{features of}} fatal arterial dissection {{confined to the}} intracranial vessels are described. Three patients with anterior circulation dissections presented with focal ischaemic neurological deficits and pathological examination of involved vessels revealed a dis-section plane between internal elastic lamina and media accompanied by intravascular throm-bosis. Three of four patients with posterior circulation dissections had clinical pathological fea-tures of subarachnoid haemorrhage and at necropsy had transmural dissections. In contrast to previous reports, primary vasculopathies either degenerative or inflammatory were not identified in affected vessels. The pathogenesis of <b>intracranial</b> arterial <b>dissection</b> is discussed and the clinical features are correlated with the pathological abnormalities. Spontaneous <b>dissection</b> of the <b>intracranial</b> vessels leading to stenosis or occlusion of the vessel lumen has been recognised with increasing frequency as an important cause of focal ischaemic neurological dis-ease. '- 5 In contrast, until recently {{little attention has been}} focused on spontaneous intracranial arteria...|$|R

Background. Cervicocephalic arterial dissection (CCAD) is rare in the postpartum period. To our knowledge {{this is the first}} reported case of postpartum angiopathy (PPA) presenting with ischemic stroke due to <b>intracranial</b> arterial <b>dissection.</b> Case. A 41 -year-old woman presented with blurred vision, headache, and generalized seizures 5 days after delivering twins. She was treated with magnesium for eclampsia. MRI identified multiple posterior circulation infarcts. Angiography identified a complex dissection extending from both intradural vertebral arteries, through the basilar artery, and into both posterior cerebral arteries. Multiple segments of arterial dilatation and narrowing consistent with PPA were present. Xenon enhanced CT (Xe-CT) showed reduced regional cerebral blood flow that is improved with elevation in blood pressure. Conclusion. Intracranial vertebrobasila...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{narrative}} review is to evaluate the pathogenesis, clinical features, diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of <b>intracranial</b> artery <b>dissection</b> (IAD). IAD is a rare and often unrecognized cause of stroke or subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH), especially in young adults. Two types of IAD can be identified: a subintimal or subadventitial dissection. It is suggested that a subintimal dissection results in luminal stenosis, thromboembolism and subsequently cerebral ischaemia, whilst a subadventitial IAD {{could result in the}} formation of a pseudo-aneurysm and compression on brainstem or cranial nerves. Rupture of such a dissecting aneurysm causes SAH. The exact cause of IAD remains unknown but several factors are associated with its development. Diagnosis is based on clinical presentation and specific features seen on multimodal neuroimaging. The management of IAD depends on the clinical presentation. In the case of cerebral ischaemia, anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents are used, whilst in the case of SAH endovascular treatment is primarily advocated. Prognosis depends on clinical presentation. Presentation with SAH has a worse prognosis...|$|R
40|$|<b>Intracranial</b> {{vertebral}} artery <b>dissection</b> (VAD) represents the underlying etiology {{in a significant}} percentage of posterior circulation ischemic strokes and subarachnoid hemorrhages. These lesions are particularly challenging in their diag-nosis, management, and in the prediction of long-term outcome. Advances in the understanding of underlying processes leading to dissection, as well as the evolution of modern imaging tech-niques are discussed. The data pertaining to med-ical management of intracranial VADs, with em-phasis on anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents, is reviewed. Surgical intervention is discussed, in-cluding, the selection of operative candidates, open and endovascular procedures, and potential complications. The evolution of endovascular technology and techniques is highlighted...|$|R
40|$|Background and Purpose The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{demonstrate}} the magnetic resonance features of <b>intracranial</b> vertebrobasilar artery <b>dissections</b> and to determine the poten-tial and limitations of magnetic resonance imaging in their diagnosis. Methods We studied five consecutive patients with angio-graphically verified intracranial vertebrobasilar artery dissec-tion with magnetic resonance imaging (0. 5 T) in regard to the shapes of the intramural hematoma and the chronological change of its signal intensity. We also estimated the sensitivity of magnetic resonance imaging for diagnosing dissection. Results We observed intramural hematoma in four patients on the first magnetic resonance scan and in all five patients during the course of the study. The shapes of the intramural hematomas were curvilinear, crescentic, "bamboo-cut, " "band...|$|R
