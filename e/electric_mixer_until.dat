30|$|Enrichment with vitamin C is {{the second}} step to {{enrichment}} with HUFAs. Therefore, in order to enrich the live food with vitamins, fatty acid emulsion was used as carrier of this component. Fatty acid emulsion was prepared and 10 % of Ascorbyl palmitate w/w {{was added to the}} fatty acid emulsion (Treece, 2000). Mixing was done using an <b>electric</b> <b>mixer</b> <b>until</b> the vitamin C is dissolved. The emulsion containing vitamin C was preserved in refrigerator until use. Nauplii were enriched with two doses of this mixture at 0 and 18  h during the process of enrichment.|$|E
40|$|Egg white foam {{is a type}} of foam (a colloid {{in which}} a gas is {{dispersed}} or spread throughout a liquid) used in meringues, souffl és, and angel food cake to make them light and porous (airy). To prepare an egg white foam, egg whites are initially beaten (with a wire wisk or <b>electric</b> <b>mixer)</b> <b>until</b> they become frothy. Then an acid (such as cream of tartar) is added. Depending on the application, the beating of the egg white continues until soft (when the peaks stand straight and bend slightly at the tips) or stiff peaks (when the peaks stand straight without bending) are formed. Salt and sugar may also be added. How It Works: Egg whites are made up of water, protein, and small amounts of minerals and sugars. When the egg whites are beaten, air is added and the egg white protein, albumen, is denatured. Denaturation is the change of a protein’s shape under stress (in this case, beating). The denatured protein coats the air bubbles and holds in the water, causing them t...|$|E
25|$|An <b>electric</b> <b>mixer</b> is {{a kitchen}} {{appliance}} used for whipping, beating, and folding food ingredients. It typically {{consists of a}} handle mounted over a large enclosure containing the motor, which drives one or two beaters. The beaters are immersed in the food to be mixed. The first <b>electric</b> <b>mixer</b> was invented by Rufus M. Eastman in 1885. U.S. patent #330,829 for the first <b>electric</b> <b>mixer</b> was filed by Eastman on March 6, 1885, and issued on November 17, 1885.|$|R

Despite this, NBC reported that a child attempted to recreate the scenario and nearly electrocuted himself in the process (Fusco confirmed {{that the child was}} unharmed); Fusco was forced to refilm the opening sequence, replacing the <b>electric</b> <b>mixer</b> with a manual egg beater. ALF's amnesia is instead caused by a cranial concussion received after slipping in the shower (a [...] "thud" [...] is heard rather than a [...] "zap"), with all mentions of being shocked either overdubbed with new dialogue or deleted entirely (including ALF's public service announcement).

A small electric truck was used to handle 150 dozen bottles at a time where previously a hand truck would carry 6 dozen. <b>Electric</b> <b>mixers</b> replaced men with shovels handling sand and other ingredients that were fed into the glass furnace.

50|$|In Greece, one of {{the most}} popular coffees is a {{variation}} of iced coffee called Frappé, invented by a Nescafe represenatative Dimitrios Vakondios in 1957. The preparation entails instant coffee (traditionally Nescafe), water, and optionally, sugar, together using either an <b>electric</b> <b>mixer</b> or a shaker to create a foam. Subsequently, milk is optionally added followed by ice cubes, and the remainder is topped with water. It became well known outside of Greece as a result of the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, during which many tourists became fond of it and an article in the Los Angeles Times was published about it.http://www.latimes.com/features/printedition/food/la-fo-frappe18aug18,1,6434354.story?coll=la-headlines-pe-food Since its founding, Frappe became a very popular drink in Cyprus, and in Romania.|$|R
50|$|Concave cakes are {{commonly}} made with eggs, egg yolk, low gluten flour, honey {{and a small}} portion of sugar. Regardless of ingredients, the procedure for making the cakes is fairly consistent in all recipes. First, preheat the oven at around 170 degree Celsius, at the same time, mix the 1 eggs and 3 egg yolks by adding sugar and honey which depend on preference. The mixture will be creamed by using a wooden spoon or <b>electric</b> <b>mixer.</b> The gluten flour will be added and stir them softly for a while. Then, pour the mixture into molds.

[...] Additionally, the modern method typically uses an extra raising agent, and some recipes call for an extra-soft butter or margarine.

25|$|Mayonnaise {{can be made}} by {{hand with}} a whisk, or fork, or with the aid of an <b>electric</b> <b>mixer</b> or blender. It is made by slowly adding oil to an egg yolk, while whisking vigorously to {{disperse}} the oil. The oil and the water in the yolk form a base of the emulsion, while lecithin and protein from the yolk is the emulsifier that stabilizes it. A combination of van der Waals interactions and electrostatic repulsion determine the bond strength among oil droplets. The high viscosity of mayonnaise is attributed to the total strength created by these two intermolecular forces. Addition of mustard contributes to the taste and further stabilizes the emulsion, as mustard contains small amounts of lecithin. If vinegar is added directly to the yolk, it can emulsify more oil, thus making more mayonnaise.|$|R
