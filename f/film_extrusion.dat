5000|$|Coextrusion {{is common}} in sheet and <b>film</b> <b>extrusion,</b> {{allowing}} for speedy production of multi-layered parts. This is accomplished by joining multiple polymer melts in either the manifold or approach stage. Layers of different thicknesses may be formed by introducing melts at different flow rates or different manifold sizes.|$|E
50|$|Extruded tubing, such as PVC pipes, is {{manufactured}} using {{very similar}} dies {{as used in}} blown <b>film</b> <b>extrusion.</b> Positive pressure {{can be applied to}} the internal cavities through the pin, or negative pressure {{can be applied to the}} outside diameter using a vacuum sizer to ensure correct final dimensions. Additional lumens or holes may be introduced by adding the appropriate inner mandrels to the die.|$|E
50|$|Several factors {{influence}} {{the efficiency of}} the flame treatment such as air-to-gas ratio, thermal output, surface distance, and oxidation zone dwell time. Upon conception of the process, a corona treatment immediately followed <b>film</b> <b>extrusions,</b> but the development of careful transportation techniques allows treatment at an optimized location. Conversely, in-line corona treatments have been implemented into full-scale production lines such as those in the newspaper industry. These in-line solutions are developed to counteract the decrease in wetting characteristics caused by excessive solvent use.|$|R

50|$|Traditional {{plastic bags}} are usually made from polyethylene, which {{consists}} of long chains of ethylene monomers. Ethylene is derived from natural gas and petroleum. The polyethylene used in most plastic shopping bags is either low-density (resin identification code 4) or, more often, high-density (resin identification code 2). Color concentrates and other additives are often used to add tint to the plastic. Plastic shopping bags are commonly manufactured by blown <b>film</b> <b>extrusion.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Tube forming dies {{allow for}} {{continuous}} extrusion of thick walled (relative to blown <b>film</b> <b>extrusion)</b> tubes and [...] pipes. [...] The dies themselves are {{almost identical to}} those used in blown film extrusion; the only major difference is {{the gap between the}} inner mandrel and outer die wall. Once the polymer melt is extruded from the die, it is pulled away by take-up rollers. Cooling is accomplished through the use of water baths, or a large number of cooling fans. After cooling, the tube is either wound onto large spools (if flexible), or cut into pre-set lengths and stacked (if stiff).|$|E
50|$|The product {{must now}} be cooled and this is usually {{achieved}} by pulling the extrudate through a water bath. Plastics are very good thermal insulators and are therefore difficult to cool quickly. Compared to steel, plastic conducts its heat away 2,000 times more slowly. In a tube or pipe extrusion line, a sealed water bath is acted upon by a carefully controlled vacuum to keep the newly formed and still molten tube or pipe from collapsing. For products such as plastic sheeting, the cooling is achieved by pulling {{through a set of}} cooling rolls. For films and very thin sheeting, air cooling can be effective as an initial cooling stage, as in blown <b>film</b> <b>extrusion.</b>|$|E

50|$|Corona {{treatment}} (sometimes {{referred to}} as air plasma) is a surface modification technique that uses a low temperature corona discharge plasma to impart changes in the properties of a surface. The corona plasma is generated by the application of high voltage to an electrode that has a sharp tip. The plasma forms at the tip. A linear array of electrodes {{is often used to}} create a curtain of corona plasma. Materials such as plastics, cloth, or paper may be passed through the corona plasma curtain in order to change the surface energy of the material. All materials have an inherent surface energy. Surface treatment systems are available for virtually any surface format including dimensional objects, sheets and roll goods that are handled in a web format. Corona treatment is a widely used surface treatment method in the plastic <b>film,</b> <b>extrusion,</b> and converting industries.|$|E
40|$|Properties {{exhibited}} by blown films {{are controlled by}} the microstructure developed during their processing. Therefore, real-time measurement of microstructure during the blown <b>film</b> <b>extrusion</b> can help in better control and optimization of the process needed to obtain desired properties. The objectives of this research were (i) to conduct real-time microstructural measurements during single-layer and multi-layer blown <b>film</b> <b>extrusion</b> of polypropylene (PP) and low-density polyethylene (LDPE) using real-time Raman spectroscopy; (ii) to conduct real-time wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) during single-layer blown <b>film</b> <b>extrusion</b> of LDPE to obtain crystallinity and orientation values during the process; and (iii) to investigate the effect of blown film coextrusion on the microstructure of PP/LDPE bilayer films.

40|$|International audienceThe {{majority}} of LLDPE resins is processed via blown <b>film</b> <b>extrusion</b> techniques for various {{applications in the}} industrial and consumer packaging business. These LLDPE resins all have, independent of the molecular structure differences, the same intrinsic limitation in blown <b>film</b> <b>extrusion</b> processing. These limitations are: low output, high sensitivity to surface defects (stripes, sharkskin), high machine power requirement, need for large die gaps, lower bubble stability, and low melt strength. As a consequence, the more versatile manufacturing and property wise LLDPE resins {{are not used to}} their full potential. The industrial objective is therefore threefold: develop a new LLDPE resin overcoming the above limitations, develop a new flexible blown <b>film</b> <b>extrusion</b> line tailored to the new generation of LLDPE resins, develop an efficient 3 -D finite element simulation code to assist in the resin and blown <b>film</b> <b>extrusion</b> line development...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Peel {{strength}} {{between layers}} in coextruded cast <b>film</b> and <b>extrusion</b> coating {{is found to}} increase with increasing process time, defined as the time between the die exit and when the polymer is quenched. The results suggest that adhesion {{is limited by the}} time and temperature available for bonding after new interfacial area is created during drawing. This contrasts with previous work in blown film where increases in peel strength with process time were attributed primarily to stress effects. The results from both processes, however, were found to collapse onto a single master curve by multiplying the peel strength by a function of the tie resin modulus and dividing the process time by the tie resin relaxation time...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{manufacture}} the biodegradable nanocomposite <b>films</b> by <b>extrusion</b> from different combinations of cassava starch, xanthan gum and nanoclays (sodium montmorillonite - MMT- Na) and to characterize them according to their microstructure, optical, mechanical and barrier properties.

40|$|<b>Film</b> <b>extrusion</b> and welding of {{biodegradable}} polymer {{films are}} important processes {{that must be}} considered in the development of compostable packaging materials. <b>Film</b> <b>extrusion</b> of poly(lactic acid) (PLA) has proved to be rather difficult because of its brittleness, but the flexibility of PLA can be improved by incorporation of a plasticizer in the material. PLA was plasticized with triacetine (TAc) and tributyl citrate (TbC). The blended materials and neat PLA were film extruded and the films were welded with constant heat (CH) welding. The films were analyzed by means of gas chromatography (GC), dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), gel permeation chromatography (GPC), contact angle measurements, and tensile testing. Storage of the plasticized films resulted in an increased crystallinity and changes in the film properties, rendering CH welding difficult. The welding process had no influence on thermal properties, such as cold crystallization temperature, melting temperature, crystallization temperature, and degree of crystallinity, of neat PLA but caused significant changes in the crystallinity of the plasticized materials. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc...|$|E
