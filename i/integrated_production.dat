25|$|The company {{decided in}} 1960 to {{increase}} its paper production dramatically. PM4 started operations in 1963 in a fully <b>integrated</b> <b>production</b> line manufacturing supercalender magazine paper, with an annual production of 50,000 tonnes. This involved the installation of a new lumber cleaning and chopping mill, a new pulp mill, a new boiler system and a new water pipe from Femsjøen. Steam from the Halden Reactor {{was used in the}} paper machines. Saugbrugsforeningen thus became the first paper mill in the world to derive steam from nuclear power. Investments from 1958 to 1963 cost NOK165 million. By 1964 the company was producing 130,000 tonnes annually of various paper grades, up four-fold since 1950. The company had 3,000 employees, of which about 1,000 worked in the forests.|$|E

These include LEAF (Linking Environment And Farming) in the UK, FNL (Fördergemeinschaft Nachhaltige Landwirtschaft e.V.) in Germany, FARRE (Forum des Agriculteurs Responsables Respectueux de l'Environnement) in France, FILL (Fördergemeinschaft Integrierte Landbewirtschaftung Luxemburg) or OiB (Odling i Balans) in Sweden. However, there are few if any figures on the uptake of Integrated Farming in the major crops throughout Europe for example, leading to a recommendation by the European Economic and Social Committee in February 2014, that the EU should carry out an in-depth analysis of <b>integrated</b> <b>production</b> in Europe {{in order to obtain}} insights into the current situation and potential developments. There is evidence, however, that between 60 and 80% of pome, stone and soft fruits were grown, controlled and marketed according to “Integrated Production Guidelines” in 1999 already in Germany for example. In the UK, 22% of fresh fruit and vegetables are grown to Integrated Farm Management standards as recognised by the LEAF Marque.|$|E

40|$|Many useful {{techniques}} and infrastructures {{have been developed}} to test the correctness and performance of computer systems before deployment. However, they are limited when applied to the large-scale networked systems that are prevalent today, from Internet routing to peer-to-peer (P 2 P) video delivery. First, testing infrastructures are typically smaller in size and scale than the production infrastructure, limiting the scale of possible test scenarios. Second, keeping the testing infrastructures and their configurations synchronized with the production infrastructures is difficult or impossible. Finally, capturing and <b>integrating</b> <b>production</b> workloads into the testing infrastructures can be challenging. To address these shortcomings, we have developed novel techniques to conduct correctness and performance evaluations on production infrastructures for large, networked systems. We show how incorporation of domain-specific knowledge of a system being tested can provide an efficient testing infrastructure that is scalable, accurate, and easily <b>integrates</b> <b>production</b> workloads.
