For English, a classification based on Levin’s method ([Lev 93]) is VerbNet ([Sch 05]). VerbNet is an extensive digital verb lexicon which systematically extends Levin’s classes while ensuring that class members have a common semantics and share {{a common set of}} syntactic frames and thematic roles. In this work we reorganise the verbs from three French syntax lexicons, namely Volem, the <b>Grammar-Lexicon</b> (Ladl) and Dicovalence, into VerbNet-like verb classes using the technique of Formal Concept Analysis. We automatically acquire syntactic-semantic verb class and diathesis alterna-tion information. We create large scale verb classes and compare their verb and frame distributions to those of VerbNet. We discuss possible evaluation schemes and finally focus on an evaluation methodology with respect to VerbNet, of which we present the theoretical mo...|$|E
