Still maritime transport faces several operations challenges such as non-storability of shipping space, matching supply with dynamic shipping demand, and non-availability of fair allocation mechanism {{in the age of}} <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>systems</b> due to ban of anticompetitive liner conference amongst others. This paper develops a sustainable decision model for allocating ship capacity to satisfy shipping demand and to generate a route plan.

The paper uses multi-agent system modeling and an iterative combinatorial auction mechanism with Vickrey–Clarke–Groves payments to deploy ships at economically efficient prices in the age of <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>systems.</b> To tackle the computational complexity of multi-agent system model with auction mechanism, this paper proposes an enumerative search algorithm.

To facilitate <b>information</b> <b>exchange,</b> the Coast Guard developed the Maritime <b>Information</b> <b>Exchange</b> and Port State <b>Information</b> <b>Exchange</b> <b>systems</b> to share vital safety information with fellow port states and shipping companies. The results of safety inspections and ship specific information are still recorded and made public in these systems.

Semantic interoperability requires mapping between vocabularies of independently developed resources, a task fraught with uncertainty.

As such, they promise {{to improve the quality}} of service descriptions, enable more thorough analysis of service composition opportunities, and provide a theoretically sound methodology for semantic mapping under uncertainty.
