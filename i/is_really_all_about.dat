She stated: [...] "(I was) one of those kids... holding everything inside... internalizing everything. And that really can affect you, and feeling helpless and hopeless, and finding that person that you can trust, that adult, like I did later on in life, that I felt comfortable and safe to tell my issues, my worries, my pains, my aches to. This is what the Trevor Project <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>all</b> <b>about.</b> And they have a 24-hour hotline... There's someone there that you can speak with 24 hours that will be there for you." [...] She made an official It Gets Better video which was released on December 1, 2010.|$|E

[...] While Zappa was in favor of the sexual revolution, he regarded himself as a pioneer in publicly discussing honesty about sexual intercourse, stating [...] "American sexual attitudes are controlled as a necessary tool of business and government in order to perpetuate themselves. Unless people begin to see through that, to see past it to, what sex <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>all</b> <b>about,</b> they're always going to have the same neurotic attitudes. It's very neatly packaged. It all works hand-in-hand with the churches and political leaders at the point, where elections are coming up." [...] This view inspired the lyrical content of [...] "Crew Slut", in which Mary, Joe's girlfriend, falls into the groupie lifestyle, going on to participate in a wet T-shirt contest in the following track, [...] "Fembot in a Wet T-Shirt" ...|$|E

The realms in Buddhist cosmology are indeed realms of rebirths. Otherwise rebirth would always be into the human realm, or {{there would be no}} rebirth at all. And that is not traditional Buddhism, states Williams.|$|E
5000|$|In 2011, abbot of Glenstal Abbey and Benedictine monk Dom Mark Patrick Hederman, OSB, {{was quoted}} by novelist and writer Russell Shorto {{speaking}} about the Church making [...] "this island Ireland into a concentration camp where Church could control everything. ... And the control <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> sex. ... It's not difficult {{to understand how the}} whole system became riddled with what we now call a scandal but in fact was a complete culture.|$|R

5000|$|Members Dan and Ryan {{met while}} {{attending}} the same college. Dan and Jermaine {{had known each}} other for several years and learned to play guitar together. Eventually, they met Jack and the four later formed the band together. According to the band, the name comes from using the slang term “‘hunna’ in everyday language with each other... We put 'the' in front and landed on 'The Hunna'. The name is also what we <b>are</b> <b>really</b> <b>all</b> <b>about,</b> we give 100% in our music and in our daily lives.” They also cite a major hip-hop influence for the band name. They released their first single [...] "Bonfire" [...] in October 2015.|$|R
2500|$|Jaya {{released}} an album under Universal Records entitled All Souled Out, a CD album containing 12 tracks of all revival songs. It was her third cover album, containing classic R and jazz songs that {{she grew up}} listening to. The album received a critical response, after experimenting {{with a variety of}} sounds in her previous outings, [...] "Jaya comes to terms with what she <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> as a singer in [...] "All Souled Out." [...] She triumphs in making the material sound genuine, largely because it is perfect for her. And her voice is a thing of wonder. There is warmth, power, and vulnerability in her renditions, making listening to the entire album a breeze—perfect for long drives or for those lazy weekends." ...|$|E

That is what this book <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>all</b> <b>about,</b> the ruination of some men, and the salvation of others, for even out at sea there are missionaries working to try and save souls.|$|E

She was both laughing and crying, which was no surprise, {{for all of us}} would laugh and cry over a book about such an interesting subject as ourselves, but said she, [...] "How wrong you are in thinking this book is about me and mine, it <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> Timothy." ...|$|E
5000|$|Haggard told The Boot that {{he wrote}} the song after he became disheartened {{watching}} Vietnam War protests and incorporated that emotion and viewpoint into song. Haggard says, [...] "When I was in prison, I {{knew what it was}} like to have freedom taken away. Freedom is everything. During Vietnam, there were all kinds of protests. Here were these servicemen going over there and dying for a cause — we don't even know what it <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>all</b> <b>about.</b> And here <b>are</b> these young kids, that were free, bitching about it. There's something wrong with that and with disparaging those poor guys." [...] He states {{that he wrote}} the song to support the troops.|$|R
2500|$|The 1996 movie That Thing You Do! touches {{briefly on}} the phenomenon, with the Wonders making an {{appearance}} in a fictional beach party movie, Weekend at Party Pier. A 2001 episode of Sabrina, the Teenage Witch ("Beach Blanket Bizarro") also paid {{homage to the}} series, with Avalon appearing as himself. Avalon and Funicello starred in Paramount Pictures Back to the Beach in 1987, playing off their original roles and subsequent careers. Kelly Killoren Bensimon wrote in The Bikini Book, [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> Annette Funicello. If {{the girl next door}} wanted to wear a bikini, then everybody wanted to wear a bikini. We didn't want to be a bad Bond girl. We <b>all</b> <b>really</b> wanted to <b>be</b> the good girl." ...|$|R
40|$|Partial metrics were {{introduced}} in 1992 as a metric to allow the distance of a point from itself to be non zero. This notion of self distance, designed to extend metrical concepts to Scott topologies as used in computing, has little intuition for the mainstream Hausdorff topologist. The talk will show that a partial metric over a set can be represented by a metric over that set with a so-called 2 ̆ 7 base point 2 ̆ 7. Thus we establish that a partial metric is essentially a structure combining both a metric space and a skewed view of that space from the base point. From this we can deduce {{what it is that}} partial metrics <b>are</b> <b>really</b> <b>all</b> <b>about...</b>|$|R

50|$|In an {{interview}} with Jim DeRogatis of the Chicago Sun-Times, guitarist Ira Kaplan stated: What was different {{was that it was}} all sound for the most part. There was melody involved in the pieces, but it <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> mood. There's so much of that in the songs we work on anyway, but to think only about the way the mood was developing was a big difference. The songs tend to start the same way with just the three of us kind of playing and seeing what comes out, but once we had something that we were working on, it was a lot different, and the pieces were all 10 minutes long!The album's cover photos are from the accompanying films. The album artwork was designed by Jim Woodring and Jad Fair.|$|R
50|$|In March 1954, {{the theatre}} re-opened and its success {{continued}} unabated, {{under the leadership}} of Geoffrey Ost, who had been the director since 1938, a service broken only by his wartime call-up. In 1959 Ost was awarded an honorary Doctorate at the University (a Scholarship still exists under his name). The future acting stars who were members of the Company include Peter Sallis, Patrick McGoohan, Patrick Stewart, Paul Eddington, Keith Barron and Sir Nigel Hawthorne. Actors such as Sir Alec Guinness and Patrick Macnee also performed in individually contracted productions and Sir Donald Wolfit was an assistant stage manager there. However Sheffield Rep. <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> the local community - it only survived and prospered because many local people gave their labour and support on a voluntary or semi-professional basis, although plenty of local paid work was also provided.|$|R
5000|$|The {{song was}} {{recorded}} in November 2012. Payne said, [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> the vocal, kind of getting up to that point, to make it, to kinda lift it, and make it not kinda linear and repetitive. Actually kind of create those peaks." [...] The notes in the chorus were [...] "really high" [...] for vocalist Fran Healy, so during the first recording of the song he sang them in falsetto. When he listened to it the next morning, [...] "it just sounded weak". However, Healy remembered being told about an effect that adrenaline can have on human voice, {{so he decided to}} run into the North Sea, which was just outside the recording studio, to get the shock that would make his body release the hormone. After spending a minute in cold water, he ran up the beach straight into the studio, and recorded the vocals.|$|R

"The theme was: don't rely on {{technology}} {{or on the}} media to make up your own mind for you, make up your own mind for yourself and make your own decisions on what you like to listen to, what you like to see, what you like to do, how {{you are supposed to}} feel. That was what the Imaginator record <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>all</b> <b>about.</b> It <b>was</b> speaking against the sort of lucidity that we all seem to get hypnotized into by relying on the media to make up our tastes and our flavors of the minute for us so much. Gunnar Nelson (guitarist/singer) After the success of their first album, After the Rain, and years of touring, Nelson returned to the studio to record their second album.

That ancient science is embodied in the specific principles and meditation techniques of Kriya Yoga." [...] Yogananda taught his students the need for direct experience of truth, as opposed to blind belief. He said that [...] "The true basis of religion is not belief, but intuitive experience.

John W. Campbell Jr., the godfather of this genre, would have approved. The movie <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> ideas. It only seems to be about emotions.

50|$|An {{object-oriented}} {{program is}} a complex and dynamic network of objects, {{in the same sense}} that relationships between real-world objects are complex and dynamic. Consider a waiter at a restaurant. The waiter himself is a complex object that can be viewed in many ways: as my Waiter (e.g., who describes tonight's menu and takes my order), as an Employee of the restaurant (with a certain salary and working hours), and as a Person in the restaurant (which has an occupancy limitation of 150 people). If a Waiter class was written to capture the real-world essence of Waiters (which is what object orientation <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>all</b> <b>about),</b> {{it would have to be}} very complex to support all of these perspectives.|$|E
