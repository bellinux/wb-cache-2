40|$|Titanium dioxide (TiO 2) is a {{transition}} metal oxide widely used as a white pigment in various applications, including food. Due to the classification of TiO 2 nanoparticles by the International Agency for Research on Cancer as potentially <b>harmful</b> for humans <b>by</b> <b>inhalation,</b> the presence of nanoparticles in food products needed to be confirmed {{by a set of}} independent studies. Seven samples of food-grade TiO 2 (E 171) were extensively characterised for their size distribution, crystallinity and surface properties by the currently recommended methods. All investigated E 171 samples contained a fraction of nanoparticles, however, below the threshold defining the labelling of nanomaterial. On the basis of these results and a statistical analysis, E 171 food-grade TiO 2 totally differs from the reference material P 25, confirming the few published data on this kind of particle. Therefore, the reference material P 25 {{does not appear to be}} the most suitable model to study the fate of food-grade TiO 2 in the gastrointestinal tract. The criteria currently to obtain a representative food-grade sample of TiO 2 are the following: (1) crystalline-phase anatase, (2) a powder with an isoelectric point very close to 4. 1, (3) a fraction of nanoparticles comprised between 15 % and 45 %, and (4) a low specific surface area around 10 m(2) g(- 1) ...|$|R
50|$|Gorilla Glue is <b>harmful</b> <b>by</b> <b>inhalation,</b> and irritating to the eyes, {{respiratory}} system, and skin. It {{should be}} kept away from animals and children. If Gorilla Glue is ingested, it may cause gastrointestinal blockage, and medical attention should be sought immediately. If it comes {{into contact with the}} eyes they should be flushed thoroughly with water for at least 15 minutes and then medical attention should be sought. If users have chronic asthmatic conditions then they should consult a physician before use. If it comes into contact with skin it should be washed off with a rough textured soap and some water. And if it is inhaled and causes physical discomfort then users should move to an area with fresh air, if breathing difficulties continue or if it is swallowed then medical attention should be found immediately. Wearing gloves while using it is recommended. Contains known or suspected carcinogens.|$|E

30|$|Unlike aerosol {{applications}} for systemic drug delivery and gene therapy, immunization <b>by</b> <b>inhalation</b> {{does not require}} chronic repeat dosing for efficacy. For many vaccines, immunization may be achieved with 1 â€“ 2 aerosol treatments followed by a booster treatment. Thus, there is less concern {{about the safety of}} repeated lung dosing with immunization <b>by</b> <b>inhalation,</b> compared to systemic drug delivery and gene therapy <b>by</b> <b>inhalation.</b> Nevertheless, safety remains an issue with inhaled vaccines because some patient populations (e.g. patients with allergic asthma) may be more sensitive to excipients in the formulations and care-givers who are immunosuppressed may be more vulnerable to vaccine exposure than non-immunosuppressed individuals.|$|R

40|$|Selenium is a {{trace element}} that is {{essential}} for vertebrates and involved in series of vital metabolic functions. Considering {{the purity of the}} L-selenomethionine (L-SeMet) under application and the metabolic pathways of SeMet, the FEEDAP Panel considers the use of L-SeMet as safe for all animal species, provided that the maximum total selenium level authorised in feed is respected. The use of in animal nutrition is expected to result in a similar increase in selenium deposition in animal tissues/products as that resulting from other sources of SeMet. To ensure consumer safety from consumption of food originating from animals fed L-SeMet, the FEEDAP Panel concludes that dietary selenium supplementation from the additive should not exceed a maximum of 0. 2 mg Se/kg complete feed. In the absence of specific data, the additive should be considered as an irritant to skin and eyes, as a skin sensitiser and as potentially <b>harmful</b> <b>by</b> <b>inhalation.</b> The FEEDAP Panel considers that the use of L-SeMet in feed does not pose an additional risk to the environment, compared with other sources of selenium for which it will substitute, as long as the maximum authorised content in feedingstuffs is not exceeded. L-SeMet is an efficient source of selenium for all species. This conclusion is derived from studies with laying hens and pigs for fattening and, in the case of ruminants, from literature describing the microbial incorporation of selenium from organic sources in the rumen. The FEEDAP Panel made some recommendations concerning (i) the specification, (ii) the use of the compound in premixtures, (iii) the use in water for drinking and (iv) risk reduction when handling the additive...|$|E

40|$|Previously, {{the contact}} {{allergen}} dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB) {{was identified as}} a sensitizer <b>by</b> <b>inhalation</b> in BALB/c mice; in addition, DNCB induced a lymphocytic infiltrate in the larynx of dermally sensitized Th 1 -prone Wistar rats upon a single inhalation challenge. In the present study, repeated inhalation exposures to DNCB were investigated using the same protocol as the single-challenge study: female Wistar rats were dermally sensitized with DNCB and subsequently challenged <b>by</b> <b>inhalation</b> exposure to 7 or 15 mg/m(3) DNCB twice a week for 4 weeks. Allergy-related apnoeic breathing was not observed. DNCB-specific IgG antibodies were found in the serum and [...] predominantly lymphocytic [...] inflammations were found in the nasal tissues and larynx. Similar effects were observed in animals repeatedly exposed <b>by</b> <b>inhalation</b> without previous dermal contact, indicating sensitization <b>by</b> <b>inhalation.</b> The inflammation may be the upper respiratory tract analogue of hypersensitivity pneumonitis/allergic alveolitis. Possible progression of the airway inflammation upon long-term exposure should be investigated to support or dismiss discrimination between contact and respiratory allergens in relation to respiratory allergy.

40|$|Purpose: The {{intravenous}} or intramuscular {{administration of}} epinephrine is recommended treatment in systemic anaphylaxis. The {{goal was to}} evaluate epinephrine plasma levels after intramuscular injection into the buccinator muscle in comparison to inhaled epinephrine. Methods: In this pilot study in humans, we measured plasma epinephrine concentrations before and after epinephrine administration by intramuscular injection, or <b>by</b> <b>inhalation,</b> with intramuscular saline and intravenous epinephrine as the negative and positive controls, respectively. Results: Peak plasma epinephrine concentrations were higher after epinephrine was injected intramuscularly with a maximum plasma epinephrine concentration of 3367. 2 pg/ml. After administration <b>by</b> <b>inhalation</b> epinephrine peak level was 151. 89 pg/ml. Conclusions: In cases of respiratory distress when anaphylaxis is a possible cause, at first the application of epinephrine <b>by</b> <b>inhalation</b> may be of value. Manifest major cardiovascular reactions according to anaphylaxis without availability of a venous access can only be treated by titration of epinephrine intramuscularly.
