5|$|The {{information}} sharing model assumes that individuals search concurrently for finding and joining opportunities while the producer-scrounger model {{assumes that the}} search modes are mutually exclusive. Hopping with the head facing up and downward are observed to be statistically associated with the frequencies of a bird's joining and finding, respectively. When the expected stable frequency of the scrounger tactic was altered by changing the availability of seeds, the relative frequency of hopping with the <b>head</b> <b>up</b> changed accordingly. When the seed distribution made the scrounger tactic unprofitable, the frequency of hopping with the <b>head</b> <b>up</b> diminished and appears to support the predictions of the producer-scrounger model.|$|E
5|$|He {{recognised}} German {{skill in}} constructing trench parapets: by {{making use of}} an irregular top and face to the parapet, and constructing it from material of varying composition, {{the presence of a}} sniper or an observer poking his <b>head</b> <b>up</b> became much less conspicuous. In contrast, British trench practice had been to give a military-straight neat edge to the parapet top, making any movement or protrusion immediately obvious.|$|E
5|$|Both sexes reach sexual {{maturity}} at {{one year of}} age. The male mates with the female by swimming close to her with his head lowered and tail raised, continually whistling. If there {{is a group of}} males, they will chase the female in flight until only one drake is left. The female prepares for copulation, which takes place in the water, by lowering her body; the male then bobs his <b>head</b> <b>up</b> and down and mounts the female, taking the feathers {{on the back of her}} head in his mouth. After mating, he raises his head and back and whistles.|$|E
50|$|In poker tournaments <b>heads</b> <b>up</b> poker {{is played}} as {{individual}} events {{and there are}} also <b>heads</b> <b>up</b> championships. <b>Heads</b> <b>up</b> poker tournaments are typically played as knock-out tournaments. An example of a <b>heads</b> <b>up</b> tournament is the National Heads-Up Poker Championship.|$|R
50|$|USA Football created <b>Heads</b> <b>Up</b> Football, in part {{founded by}} the NFL Foundation, {{focusing}} on key certain areas such as Coaching education, Equipment fitting, Concussion recognition and response, Heat preparedness and hydration, Student cardiac arrest, <b>Heads</b> <b>up</b> tackling, <b>Heads</b> <b>up</b> blocking and player safety coach. <b>Heads</b> <b>up</b> football was created {{in order to ensure}} that the game is played safely.|$|R
50|$|In 1996, Telarc {{merged with}} another {{independent}} label, <b>Heads</b> <b>Up,</b> now a Telarc subsidiary. In late 2005 both Telarc and <b>Heads</b> <b>Up</b> were bought by Concord Records. Today both labels operate as semi-autonomous {{units in the}} Concord Music Group.|$|R
5|$|Brolgas {{are well}} known for their ritualised, {{intricate}} mating dances. The performance begins with a bird picking up some grass and tossing it into the air before catching it in its bill. The bird then jumps a metre (yard) into the air with outstretched wings and continues by stretching its neck, bowing, strutting around, calling and bobbing its <b>head</b> <b>up</b> and down. Sometimes just one brolga dances for its mate; often they dance in pairs; and sometimes {{a whole group of}} about a dozen dance together, lining up roughly opposite each other before they start.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, Doggett {{graduated}} from the FBI Academy and assumed the position of FBI Special Agent in the Criminal Investigations Division. In 2000, Agent Doggett was assigned by Deputy Director Alvin Kersh to <b>head</b> <b>up</b> the manhunt to find Special Agent Fox Mulder. The manhunt was unsuccessful and Doggett was demoted {{to work on the}} X-Files with Special Agent Dana Scully. During this time, Doggett and Kersh developed a bitter enmity, similar to the early relationship between Mulder and Walter Skinner.|$|E

Ann (Rashida Jones) tells Leslie her last talk with Chris (Rob Lowe) reassured her their relationship was fine, {{but he has been}} acting distant since then. She asks Leslie to look for signs of whether Chris is cheating on her, since he has since returned to Indianapolis.|$|E

40|$|<b>Heads</b> <b>Up</b> is {{a series}} of {{educational}} initiatives, developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which share a common goal: to help protect people of all ages, especially children and teens, from concussions and other serious brain injuries and their potentially devastating effects. This year marks the 10 th anniversary of <b>Heads</b> <b>Up.</b> CDC 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s <b>Heads</b> <b>Up</b> provides educational resources {{to a wide range of}} audiences. From the first <b>Heads</b> <b>Up</b> materials for health care professionals launched in 2003, to later efforts focusing on sports programs and schools, <b>Heads</b> <b>Up</b> has helped to raise awareness of the need for improved prevention, recognition, and response to concussion and other serious brain injuries. Many organizations have contributed to the reach and success of <b>Heads</b> <b>Up.</b> Through their invaluable participation, <b>Heads</b> <b>Up</b> materials have landed in the hands of parents, school and health care professionals, coaches, and athletes across the country.

5|$|Non-bluffing (aposematic) {{displays}} {{occur in}} mammals which possess powerful defences such as spines or stink glands, and which habitually warn off potential predators rather than attempting escape by running. The lowland streaked tenrec (Hemicentetes semispinosus) raises the spines {{on its head}} and back when confronted by a predator, and moves its <b>head</b> <b>up</b> and down. Porcupines such as Erethizon erect their long sharp quills and adopt a hunched, head-down posture when a predator is nearby. The spotted skunk (Spilogale putorius) balances on its front legs, its body raised vertically with its bold pelage pattern conspicuously displayed, and its tail (near the scent glands) raised and spread out.|$|E
5|$|The game's {{locations}} {{reflect the}} dark atmosphere of real metro tunnels, with added survival horror elements. Paranormal phenomena, such as shadow figures, hallucinations, and unexplained noises are present, and, {{for the most}} part, the player has to rely on their lighter and rechargeable flashlight to navigate the darkness. Locations will often have an intricate layout, and the game lacks any form of map or objective marker, leaving the player to try finding their objectives with only a compass. The surface is more lethal than the metro system. Featuring a day-night cycle, and a dynamic weather system, these sections are severely irradiated and a gas mask must be worn at all times because of the toxic air. The player must collect air filters for the gas mask. These last several minutes each, and are automatically replaced provided the player has more in reserve. Players are also tasked to wipe off the dirt and blood splatter that collects on the gas mask. There is no <b>head</b> <b>up</b> display indicator to tell how long the player has until the gas mask's filters begin to fail — rather, a timer on the character's wristwatch shows how long until the current filter expires. The watch also serves to indicate to a player {{if they have been}} exposed to enemy attention. With every weapon, the bullets are (partly) visible, informing the player that their weapon is about to run out of ammunition and they have to reload. Instead of <b>head</b> <b>up</b> display the game makes use of audio and visual cues to present information to players.|$|E
5|$|The up-down {{display is}} used {{for a number of}} {{interactions}} {{with other members of the}} species. Here a stork positions its body horizontally and quickly bobs its <b>head</b> <b>up</b> from down-facing to around 30 degrees above horizontal and back again, while displaying the white segments of its plumage prominently, and this is repeated several times. The display is used as a greeting between birds, and—more vigorously—as a threat display. The species' solitary nature means that this threat display is rarely witnessed.|$|E

5|$|Under Wild, Ops (B) was {{expanded}} and {{divided into two}} sections – Operations and Intelligence. It received greater power, including control of the information flowing to double agents. Wild used this to help with planning for Operation Fortitude, the major segment of the Bodyguard plan. This situation did not last long; another 'A' Force alumnus, Lieutenant Colonel David Strangeways, was brought over to <b>head</b> <b>up</b> R Force, the operational deception unit of the 21st Army Group. Strangeways and Wild clashed on a personal and professional level. Eventually, Strangeways rewrote large portions of the Fortitude South plan, and pushed Ops (B) into a more supporting role.|$|E
5|$|Between October 1953 and February 1954, the RAAF {{underwent}} major organisational change, as it transitioned from a geographically based command-and-control {{system to}} {{one based on}} function, resulting {{in the establishment of}} Home (operational), Training, and Maintenance Commands. At the same time, RAAF Headquarters in Melbourne was absorbed by the Department of Air in Canberra. Hely was acting Air Member for Personnel from 3January to 7March 1955, between the terms of Air Vice Marshals Val Hancock and Fred Scherger. On 24January 1956, he became AOC Training Command, taking over from Air Vice Marshal Murdoch. He was succeeded as DCAS by Air Vice Marshal Douglas Candy. Hely's rank of air vice marshal became substantive on 5September. In January 1957, Point Cook retired its last de Havilland Tiger Moth trainers, signalling the end of the biplane era in the RAAF. That May, Hely was seconded to the Department of Defence and posted to Washington,D.C., to <b>head</b> <b>up</b> the Australian Joint Services Staff. He was succeeded as AOC Training Command by Air Vice Marshal Ian McLachlan.|$|E
5|$|Despite initial {{difficulties}} {{in finding a}} producer willing {{to take charge of}} the debut album of a newly signed band, Don Gilmore ultimately agreed to <b>head</b> <b>up</b> the project, with Andy Wallace hired as the mixer. Recording sessions, which mostly involved re-recording the songs off the demo tape, began at NRG Recordings in North Hollywood, California in early 2000 and lasted four weeks. Shinoda's rapping sections in most of the songs were significantly altered from the original, while most choruses remained largely unchanged. Due to the absence of Dave Farrell and Kyle Christener, {{who took part in the}} 1999 extended play, the band hired Scott Koziol and Ian Hornbeck as stand-in bassists; Delson also played bass throughout most of the album. The Dust Brothers provided additional beats for the track “With You”.|$|E

5|$|Mulder goes to {{investigate}} the facility Sheriff Frass mentioned. Before breaking in, he and Scully discuss the odd behavior of the roaches, with Scully hypothesizing that the roaches could be an invasive species. Inside the facility, which resembles a typical house, Mulder sees the walls rippling and is quickly surrounded by roaches. He is then confronted by Dr. Bambi Berenbaum (Bobbie Phillips), a researcher from the Department of Agriculture who is studying cockroaches to develop more effective methods of pest control. Berenbaum has great interest in insects and, incidentally, believes that some UFOs are actually insect swarms flying through electrically charged airspaces. Yet another death occurs in Mulder's hotel, with the individual being found covered in roaches that quickly flee. At this point, Mulder believes that the individual simply died of fright, though Scully begins to wonder {{what is going on}} and decides to <b>head</b> <b>up</b> there herself.|$|E
5|$|The {{buildup of}} {{vehicles}} and men {{trying to use}} the crossing at Wolfheze caused a bottleneck and made progress slow. Rather than wait, brigade headquarters, the KOSB and 156 Para chose to <b>head</b> <b>up</b> and over the railway embankment on foot. Once south of the railway line Support and 'B' Company, 156 Para became mixed up with 10 Para making towards Wolfheze, while the battalion headquarters and other two companies headed further south. At 20:30 divisional headquarters issued orders for all units to fall back on a position around the Hartenstein Hotel in Oosterbeek. The Germans continued to pressure 4th Parachute Brigade and 10 Para dug in around Wolfheze. 156 Para to their south came under constant attack leading to fighting at close quarters throughout the night and into the next morning.|$|E
5|$|The glyphs are stylized human, animal, {{vegetable}} and geometric shapes, and often form compounds. Nearly all those with heads are oriented <b>head</b> <b>up</b> and are either seen face on or in profile to the right, {{in the direction}} of writing. It is not known what significance turning a glyph head-down or to the left may have had. Heads often have characteristic projections on the sides which may be eyes (as on the sea turtle glyph below, and more clearly on sea-turtle petroglyphs) but which often resemble ears (as on the anthropomorphic petroglyph in the next section). Birds are common; many resemble the frigatebird (see image directly below) which was associated with the supreme god Makemake. Other glyphs look like fish or arthropods. A few are similar to petroglyphs found throughout the island.|$|E
