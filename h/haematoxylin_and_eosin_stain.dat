5000|$|Hematoxylin and eosin stain or <b>haematoxylin</b> <b>and</b> <b>eosin</b> <b>stain</b> (H&E stain or HE stain) {{is one of}} the {{principal}} stains in histology. It is the most widely used stain in medical diagnosis and is often the gold standard; for example when a pathologist looks at a biopsy of a suspected cancer, the histological section is likely to be stained with H&E and termed [...] "H&E section", [...] "H+E section", or [...] "HE section".

5000|$|Haematoxylin or {{hematoxylin}} (...) , {{also called}} natural black 1 or C.I. 75290, is a compound {{extracted from the}} heartwood of the logwood tree (Haematoxylum campechianum). Haematoxylin and eosin together make up <b>haematoxylin</b> <b>and</b> <b>eosin</b> <b>stain,</b> {{one of the most}} commonly used stains in histology. This type of stain is a permanent stain as opposed to temporary stains (e.g. iodine solution in KI). Another common stain is phosphotungstic acid haematoxylin, a mix of haematoxylin with phosphotungstic acid. When oxidized, it forms haematein, a compound that forms strongly coloured complexes with certain metal ions, the most notable ones being Fe(III) and Al(III) salts. Metal-haematein complexes are used to stain cell nuclei prior to examination under a microscope. Structures that stain with iron- or aluminium-haematein are often called basophilic, even though the mechanism of the staining is different from that of staining with basic dyes.|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY. -Crocidolite {{asbestos}} fibres, {{suspended in}} physiological saline, were injected subcutaneously into {{one or both}} flanks of 95 CBA/Lac female mice; 75 control mice received injections of saline only. Most animals were killed at chosen intervals of between 2 and 42 days after injection but some were left {{for longer periods of}} up to 623 days. At autopsy, many lymphoid and non-lymphoid structures were removed and examined for the presence of asbestos by the following techniques: <b>haematoxylin</b> <b>and</b> <b>eosin</b> <b>staining</b> followed by conventional and polarized light microscopy; Perl's stain; microincineration followed by phase-contrast microscopy; maceration with KOH followed by phase-contrast microscopy; and electron microscopy. A combination of <b>haematoxylin</b> <b>and</b> <b>eosin</b> <b>staining</b> <b>and</b> microincineration was found to be the most convenient and reliable method for demonstrating asbestos fibres in the tissues.

40|$|Forensic pathologists usually {{evaluate}} injury vitality {{through the}} identification of red blood cells in wounded tissues. <b>Haematoxylin</b> <b>and</b> <b>eosin</b> <b>stain</b> {{is one of the}} most commonly used histological stains to do this evaluation. Unfortunally this microscopic technique is not reliable in decomposed bodies because erythrocytes are often lysed and not recognizable. Although a lot of researches have attempted to use histological and immunohistochemical methods to analyze the vitality of lesions of soft tissues, there is still no conclusive tools to determined whether a wound is ante-mortem or post-mortem in decomposed corpses. The impossibility to recognize red blood cells in histological samples with <b>haematoxylin</b> <b>and</b> <b>eosin</b> <b>stain</b> does not exclude the possibility to identify their specific components. In particular haemoglobin chain seem to be one of the most resistant elements to putrescence. We tested the usefulness of the immunohistochemical technique using antibodies against haemoglobin alpha chain on formalin fixed–paraffin embedded tissue sections in some cases of decomposed corpses in the aim to understand which lesions were ante-mortem and which post-mortem. We try to use it in some murdered cases that gave us some problems about vitality diagnosis of the lesions. The employment of anti-haemoglobin alpha chain antibody allowed us to validate the results of haematoxylin-eosin analysis and understand which lesions were really dealt to kill and which not (made as an attempt to hide the corpse or by animals). These preliminary data suggest that immunohistochemical analysis could be a useful tool in determination of wound vitality. Additional studies are necessary to confirm our results and to propose a standardized method for all forensic cases...|$|E

40|$|The {{diagnosis}} of DAI {{is not always}} easy, and {{should be based on}} adequate sampling of appropriate anatomical areas from a sliced, fixed brain. It is now recognised that there is a continuum of traumatic white matter damage, and that DAI represents only the severe end of the scale. Such damage may be detected from very shortly after a head injury-a fact that may give rise to some challenging diagnostic problems. Early axonal injury detected by means of beta APP immunostaining should be interpreted with caution. The most useful tools currently available for detecting axonal damage are antisera to beta APP, PG-M 1, and GFAP, used in conjunction with a routine <b>haematoxylin</b> <b>and</b> <b>eosin</b> <b>stain,</b> but even with immunocytochemistry precise dating of histological changes may not be possible...|$|E
40|$|Many {{studies have}} {{examined}} the morphology, pathology and epizootiology of the intranuclear bacilliform virus (IBV) of Cherax quadricarinatus, but little research has been conducted to acquire specific knowledge of the virus. This is partly due to difficulties in detecting the virus and in obtaining sufficient material for viral isolation and purification. As quantified by light microscopy, we significantly (p < 0. 01) enhanced IBV intensities from 10. 56 to 16. 67 % in C. quadricarinatus by using salinity stress (12 ppt) and ingestion of infected hepatopancreatic tissue, which increased intensities from 4. 33 to 10. 77 %. It was also found that phosphotungstic acid-eosin stain was superior to standard <b>haematoxylin</b> <b>and</b> <b>eosin</b> <b>stain</b> in visualizing IBV inclusion bodies.

40|$|AIM—The histopathological {{features}} of the iris in leprosy were studied by light microscopy.  METHOD—Formalin fixed and paraffin embedded iris tissue excised during cataract surgery from 20  leprosy patients were sectioned and studied with <b>haematoxylin</b> <b>and</b> <b>eosin</b> <b>stain</b> and modified Fite Faraco's stain for acid fast bacilli (AFB).  RESULTS—Chronic inflammatory reactions were seen in the iris of 11  patients, seven of whom {{did not have any}} clinically demonstrable evidence of iridocyclitis. Smooth muscle disruption and destruction were seen in two specimens. AFB were found in the iris tissue of a polar lepromatous patient whose skin smears were negative for AFB and who had completed the WHO recommended antileprosy multidrug therapy (MDT).  CONCLUSION—Histopathology discloses far more silent chronic iridocyclitis in leprosy patients than are diagnosed clinically.

40|$|Background: The {{intramuscular}} nerve {{distribution and}} relative spindle abundance {{of the human}} hand have not been well defined, although this is important in guiding hand surgery. Methods: Forty human hands were dissected and subjected to modified Sihler’s stain and <b>haematoxylin</b> <b>and</b> <b>eosin</b> <b>stain</b> to investigate intramuscular nerve distribution and relative spindle abundance, respectively. Results: The flexor pollicis brevis (FPB), adductor pollicis (AP), and abductor digiti minimi (ADM) contain separate nerve compartments. Neural anastomoses were observed in the thenar and hypothenar muscles, including the Y-like, O-like, H-like, and U-like appearance. We found that U-like neural anastomoses may be the characteristic of the opponens muscles. The relative spindle abundance was the greatest in the opponens muscles which may coordinate fine movements. Conclusion: Except for the two opponens muscles, {{the rest of the}} thenar and hypothenar muscles could be used as whole muscle or half-muscle donors for muscle transplant. Our nerve map of the hand offers valuable guidance for hand reconstruction...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Nodular Prostatic Hyperplasia (NPH) and {{carcinoma}} of the prostate are increasingly frequent with advancing age. Early detection of these lesions can significantly reduce the patient mortality and morbidity. Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) level estimation has become a popular method for screening prostatic lesions as {{it is easy to}} perform and is cost effective. Aim: To evaluate the role of PSA as a screening tool in different prostatic pathology including prostate cancer. Also, to assess the accuracy of PSA at a cut off 4 ng/ml and to correlate Gleason’s score with PSA levels. Materials and Methods: A total number of 170 prostatic biopsies from June 2012 to June 2016 received at the Central Diagnostic Laboratory, A.

40|$|Background: The {{usefulness}} of the rapid urease test (RUT) in diagnosing Helicobacter pylori infection after peptic ulcer surgery is unknown. Methods: Patients who had undergone peptic ulcer surgery were offered endoscopic examination if they presented with dyspepsia or gastrointestinal bleeding. Biopsy specimens were taken for RUT and histology from the corpus and the stoma in patients who had undergone partial gastrectomy or from the corpus and the antrum in patients who had undergone vagotomy. Histologic examination using <b>haematoxylin</b> <b>and</b> <b>eosin</b> <b>stain</b> and Warthin-Starry stain were used as the gold standard. Results: Ninety patients were studied (69 had partial gastrectomy and 21 had vagotomy). Forty-three patients (32 in the partial gastrectomy group and 11 in the vagotomy group) were positive for H. pylori by histology. The respective sensitivity of RUT was 59 % (stoma) and 75 % (corpus) in the partial gastrectomy group (P= 0. 36) and 55 % (antrum) and 73 % (corpus) in the vagotomy group (P= 0. 51).

40|$|AIMS: To {{examine the}} light and {{electron}} microscopic features of appendices removed {{at the time of}} surgical reduction of intussusception in children; and to confirm that the viral inclusions seen in some of them are due to adenovirus. METHODS: A series of 39 appendices from cases of intussusception and 15 control appendices were reviewed. Light microscopic examination of <b>haematoxylin</b> <b>and</b> <b>eosin</b> <b>stained</b> sections was performed on all of them and one appendix with large numbers of inclusions was examined by electron microscopy. Non-isotopic in situ hybridisation using a biotinylated DNA probe was carried out on sections of appendix from 30 of the cases of intussusception and from the 15 controls. RESULTS: Light microscopic examination showed viral inclusions in 19 of the appendices from the cases of intussusception and in none of the controls. Electron microscopic examination showed viral particles with the typical features of adenovirus. Most of the appendices with viral inclusions in the <b>haematoxylin</b> <b>and</b> <b>eosin</b> <b>stained</b> sections also contained adenovirus DNA as shown by in situ hybridisation. CONCLUSIONS: Viral inclusions seen in appendices from cases of intussusception are caused by adenovirus. Adenovirus DNA was not demonstrable in appendices from cases of intussusception without viral inclusions and the aetiological factors involved in intussusception in these children remain unknown...|$|R
