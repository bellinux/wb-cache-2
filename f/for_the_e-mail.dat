Juli 2012 E-mail driven {{communication}} {{opens up}} {{new opportunities for}} social engineering attacks like the ‘doppelganger mail attack’. Our goal is to lessen the impact of such attacks by employing machine learning techniques. In order to do so we determine if incoming mail by unknown addresses can be matched to other known contacts and thereby verify if an impersonation attack is being carried out. At the same time doppelganger mail will not work on our setup, since they will be regarded as unknown e-mails. For that purpose, we develop an extension <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>e-mail</b> client Thunderbird and test several scenarios, showing that our approach can successfully counter most doppelganger mail based social engineering attacks. Although our approach is successful, {{there are still some}} attacks which cannot be detected. We highlight these attacks in our work and propose ways of detecting them in future implementations.

40|$|Background: The doctor-patient {{relationship}} has been eroded by many factors. Would e-mail enhance communication and {{address some of the}} barriers inherent to our medical practices? Methods: Of our study population, 4 physicians offered e-mail communication to participating pa-tients and 4 did not. Both patients and physicians completed questionnaires regarding satisfaction, per-ceived quality, convenience, and promptness of the communication. Results: Patient satisfaction significantly increased in the e-mail group compared with the control group in the areas of convenience (P <. 0001) and {{the amount of time spent}} contacting their physician (P <. 0001). Physician satisfaction in the e-mail group increased regarding convenience, amount of time spent on messages, and volume of messages. The response time was longer with e-mail. When asked if patients should be able to e-mail their physicians, most patients in the e-mail group and all but 2 of the physicians in the non–e-mail group responded “yes. ” Conclusion: E-mail communication was found to be a more convenient form of communication. Sat-isfaction by both patients and physicians improved in the e-mail group. The volume of messages and the time spent answering messages <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>e-mail</b> group physicians was not increased. E-mail has the po-tential to improve the doctor-patient relationship as a result of better communication. (J Am Board Fa...|$|E

40|$|The {{assumption}} that social skills are necessary ingredients of collaborative learning {{is well established}} but rarely empirically tested. In addition, most theories on collaborative learning focus on social skills only at the personal level, while the social skill configurations within a learning group might be of equal importance. Using the integrative framework, this study investigates which social skills at the personal level and at the group level are predictive of task-related e-mail communication, satisfaction with performance and perceived quality of collaboration. Data collection {{took place in a}} technology-enhanced long-term project-based learning setting for pre-service teachers. For data collection, two questionnaires were used, one at the beginning and one {{at the end of the}} learning cycle which lasted 3 months.

40|$|I {{began using}} the Internet in my {{literature}} classes in 1992, {{before the advent}} of the World Wide Web. Over the past 11 years, my use of the Internet for pedagogical purposes has passed through four major stages, and has recently emerged into a fifth stage that I call &quot;Deep Reading. &quot; In this article, I outline and illustrate this progression, with primary emphasis on the latest stage. I not only discuss the &quot;what &quot; and &quot;why &quot; of Web-enhanced instruction, but also provide some practical suggestions on how to employ it successfully. I hope that this account of my experience may inspire other instructors to use digital technologies experimentally in their teaching, and that the specific techniques I describe may save some colleagues from having to start from scratch, as I did. Stage 1 : Class Management The term &quot;paperless classroom &quot; can be used to encompass all the ways in which classes can be taught and managed with the latest technologies. However, most writers use it only to refer to the management of classroom instruction: the collection, correction, return, and/or storage of records of attendance, assignments, examinations, and grades (Robb, 1997; Damery, 1998; Keller, 2001). In my first stage of technology integration, I developed a set of techniques to streamline these activities. I began by requiring that students submit all assignments by text-only email, copying and pasting their work from a word processing program with the text appropriately formatted. I established a consistent format <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>e-mail</b> &quot;subject &quot; line so that I could file assignments by class, date, and student and then easily retrieve a particular message with the search function of my e-mail client. I discovered that spreadsheet programs can be easily adapted to grading.

40|$|The rapid {{spread and}} the easy {{availability}} of a free e-mail service have made it the medium of choice for the sending of unsolicited advertising and bulk e-mail in general. These messages, known as junk e-mail or spam mail, are an increasing problem to both Internet users and Internet service providers (ISPs). The research resolves {{one aspect of the}} spam problem by developing an appropriate filter <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>e-mail</b> client. The proposed filter is a combination of three forms of filters: Whitelist, Blacklist, and a Bayesian filter. Whitelist-based filter only accepts e-mails from known addresses. Blacklist filter blocks e-mails from addresses known to send out spam. Bayesian content-based filter makes estimations of spam probability based on the text and filters messages based on a pre-selected threshold. The Bayesian filter is selected to be the main filter. The Bayesian filter is manually trained on a set of gathered e-mails; some of them are spam and the others are legitimate based on the contents of an e-mail. Thereafter the classification phase has been implemented for new entered e-mails. All the required databases are constructed in form of tables stored in the Structured Query Language (SQL) server. The filter at the client side can transparently access the database in order to carry on the intended filtering. The proposed system (e-mail client interface and the filters) can manage messages written in both Arabic and English languages which is crucial for the users in our region. Software engineering principals are implemented throughout the design process to make the system less vulnerable to faults and easily maintained. The design steps have followed the Waterfall-model using the ASCENT software. A user-friendly interface has been developed to access the features of the spam filter at the client side. Visual Basic version 6 has been used to develop the system. As well, the SQL server has been implemented to build and process the database. A number of performance measurements have been carried out with asset of gathered e-mails. The results are used to evaluate the performance of the filter and to prove its efficiency. <br /...|$|E

In an open letter to the then Minister of Arts and Culture, Mr Pallo Jordan from the South African Music Quota Committee (SAMQC) (Oct 2007) they voiced their concerns: “The SA content quota of 25 percent for commercial radio is not only too low, it is also often meaningless, because The Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (ICASA) allows stations to include gig guides, interviews and promotions as part of their local quota. You state, and we agree, that “cultural industries are serious business”. The structures protecting the national interest in iron, minerals, fishing, sport and many other areas are strongly enforced and defended here in South Africa. Why not our music?” More initiatives such as the “Play Local of Die” campaign whose aim is to urge commercial broadcasters to increase their local content with regards to commercial radios stations playlist was launched by South African Hip Hop artist commonly known as JR (Real Name: JR Bogopa) to further exhibit the South African musicians plight in how pivotal it is to their careers and overall financial well-being that the current quota be raised significantly. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the impact of local content quota on domestic radio broadcasters in South Africa. The population for this study included 100 radio station which broadcast in the republic of South Africa. The response rate <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>e-mail</b> questionnaire was 100 percent of the 100 respondents. A Likert-type scale instrument consisted of 39 questions divided into two sections: Section one looked at the demographic profile of the respondents and section two focused on getting responses on the factors impacting local content quotaand domestic broadcasters, namely local content quota, implications for domestic broadcasters, revenue streams, impact on local musicians, governments role in local content quota, success factors, globalisation and piracy. In order to realise the purpose of this study, the following research design was used: Step 1 A literature review was conducted to determine the various factors impacting local artists, local broadcasters and local content quota. Step 2 A questionnaire was composed according to the principles and guidelines in steps 1. Step 3 Empirical data was obtained with the aid of an e-mail survey. Step 4 The results of the data were analysed and interpreted. Step 5 The empirical results were integrated with Step 3. Step 6 Conclusions and recommendations were completed. The main findings from the study were: The study revealed that the radio industry is not unanimous in the call from artists for government to increase the local content quota and thus prefer that the current status quo continue. That local content quota are not the only way to curb the South African music industry‟s woes, artists should seek to maximise their revenue by exploiting the infinite avenues for revenue that globalisation avails...|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- An {{efficient}} and secure protocol in certified e-mail delivery is proposed in this paper. With {{the widespread use}} of public Internet, communication via electronic mail (e-mail) becomes a convenience application instead of traditional manuscript letter. People can easily append his/her digital signature to <b>the</b> <b>e-mail</b> in order to achieve the goal of non-repudiation of origin. However, the evidence of receipt still relies on the willingness of the recipient in <b>the</b> standard <b>e-mail</b> service. Hence, <b>the</b> recipient has no responsible <b>for</b> <b>the</b> received <b>e-mail.</b> In this paper, we present an {{efficient and}} secure protocol in fair certified e-mail delivery (CEMD). Our protocol efficiently provides non-repudiation of origin and receipt in the fair manner. In other words, the sender can obtain the irrefutable receipt if and only if the recipient gets <b>the</b> certified <b>e-mail</b> from <b>the</b> sender, otherwise, neither of them. Moreover, the proposed CEMD is efficiently in sending the other mails to the same recipient by using the pre-computation function. As the evaluations of computational cost and communication overhead, our protocol is cost-effective and efficient than other relevant protocols...|$|R
