50|$|In 1960 a {{piece of}} land was bought for the purpose of a landing strip for light airplanes. In 1961 Saskatchewan Government Telephone {{constructed}} a new <b>dial</b> <b>office</b> and telephone. Water meters were installed in residences and business places. Automatic telephones came in operation on July 5, 1962.|$|E
5000|$|On June 29, 1922, Syracuse's first dial {{telephone}} office was opened with the designation [...] "Syracuse 2" [...] {{and more than}} 4,700 telephones. The city became the first multi-office point to have dial service. By February 1926, the second <b>dial</b> <b>office,</b> [...] "Syracuse 3," [...] was implemented. At that same time, the James Exchange was retired.|$|E
50|$|At {{the time}} of the 1918 merger, Home had 60,000 {{customers}} served from 16 <b>dial</b> <b>offices.</b> Sunset had 68,000 subscribers served from nine manual offices. Home's operations were sizable and the public felt Home provided better service than Sunset, so Pacific Telephone didn't convert the <b>dial</b> <b>offices</b> to manual as it had in the past. Instead, they took the highly unusual step of adding a dial and trunk lines to every manual switchboard position. In this way, former Sunset customers could reach the former Home subscribers via their central office operator.|$|R
25|$|In {{rural areas}} some smaller {{switching}} facilities, such as community <b>dial</b> <b>offices</b> (CDOs), were housed in prefabricated metal buildings. These facilities almost always had concrete floors. The hard surfaces reflected sounds.|$|R
50|$|Between 1943 and 1947, {{the number}} of local calls made each day in the city jumped {{from an average of}} 368,000 to 528,000 and another 9,000 {{telephones}} were added in 1947, bringing the total to 82,000. New telephone facilities were constructed in Mattydale and Eastwood after World War II and new <b>dial</b> <b>offices</b> were added.|$|R
5000|$|San Francisco {{continued}} to install manual offices throughout the 1920s. When PT&T {{took over the}} operations of its San Francisco and Oakland competitor, Home Telephone Co., in the early 1920s, their customers were switched from Home's dial service to Pacific Telephone manual exchanges. [...] A 1927 Pacific Telephone & Telegraph Co. publication proudly describes the company's newest manual offices, without a word of plans to introduce dial service. [...] San Francisco's first <b>dial</b> <b>office,</b> ORdway, opened on 23 March 1929. The first suburban step-by-step (electromechanical stepping switch) office opened in Palo Alto in 1929.|$|E
5000|$|Moccasin, an unincorporated {{community}} in Tuolumne County, California, {{is located at}} the intersection of State Route 49 and State Route 120. The community is sited on the shore of Moccasin Reservoir at the edge of Lake Don Pedro. The US Postal Service ZIP Code for the area is 95347. Numbers of wired telephones in the Moccasin central office follow the format [...] (209) 989-2xxx. Before the 1980s, Moccasin telephone calls were switched by a step by step Community <b>Dial</b> <b>Office.</b> The town is home to a State of California Resources Agency, Department of Fish and Game fish hatchery.|$|E
50|$|When announced, the DTMF {{technology}} {{was not immediately}} available on all switching systems. The circuits of subscribers requesting the feature often had to be moved from older switches that supported only pulse dialing to a newer crossbar, or later an electronic switching system, requiring the assignment of a new telephone number which was billed at a higher monthly rate. Community <b>dial</b> <b>office</b> subscribers would often find the service initially unavailable as these villages were served by a single unattended exchange, often step by step, with service from a foreign exchange impractically expensive. Rural party line service was typically based on mechanical switching equipment {{which could not be}} upgraded.|$|E
50|$|The {{panel system}} was {{designed}} to work with manual offices of up to 10,500 lines. Callers <b>dialed</b> the <b>office</b> code followed by the line number within the office. For lines 10,000 and up, callers therefore <b>dialed</b> the <b>office</b> code and a five-digit line number. For offices with fewer than 10,000 lines, callers dialed four digits but PCI sends a leading 0.|$|R
25|$|The {{panel system}} was {{designed}} to interconnect the offices of a city or a local calling area. Each office was assigned a two- (later three) digit <b>office</b> code. Callers <b>dialed</b> the <b>office</b> code followed by the station number. In most situations this led to six-digit (later seven) numbers. But from the beginning the panel system handled seven-digit numbers (later eight), for two reasons. Party line numbers were listed {{with one of the}} letters J, M, R, and W following the line number. The caller <b>dialed</b> the <b>office</b> code, the line number, and the digit corresponding to the letter. The panel system {{was designed to}} work with manual offices of up to 10,500 lines. To call a line in a manual <b>office,</b> callers <b>dialed</b> the <b>office</b> code followed by the line number, just as they would when calling a number in a fully automatic office. For lines 10,000 and up, callers therefore <b>dialed</b> the <b>office</b> code and a five-digit line number.|$|R
50|$|The {{company had}} 1,500 {{employees}} by 1928 and served 43,000 telephones in the 90 sq mi Syracuse area. The building at State and Fayette Streets was opened, with equipment for 100,000 dial telephones. In succeeding months, additional central offices went into service, making {{the city the}} largest city to have 100 percent dial service. Buildings to house the additional <b>dial</b> <b>offices</b> were constructed at 4725 South Salina Street and in Draper Avenue.|$|R
50|$|In most areas, one carrier held a {{monopoly}} on local service. The landline telephone system was originally constructed in an era before transistorisation, remote concentrators or cabinetisation. Individual lines from subscribers ran not to a remote concentrator but directly to the nearest village community <b>dial</b> <b>office,</b> to be terminated at an automated mechanical switch or manual exchange. To keep subscriber loop wiring requirements manageable, local exchanges were built in each tiny hamlet. Rural subscribers often made do with party line service. Each village was a separate rate center for long-distance calls and each had its own block of ten thousand numbers (the largest that reasonably could fit on a small-town manual cord switchboard with a jack and indicator for each line). In most small villages, many of these numbers would remain unused. In large cities, multiple exchanges were created to cover individual districts or neighbourhoods; each had its own series of distinctive prefixes, and multiple blocks of ten thousand numbers each. The first few digits of a number uniquely identified a village, a town or a neighbourhood of a big city.|$|E
5000|$|The Very Compact Digital Exchange (VCDX) was {{developed}} with the 5ESS-2000, and marketed to mostly non-Bell telephone companies as an inexpensive, {{effective way to}} offer ISDN and other digital services in an analog switching center. This avoided the capital expense of retrofitting the entire analog switch into a digital one to serve all of the switch's lines when many wouldn't require it and would remain POTS lines. An example would be the (former) GTE/Verizon Class-5 telephone switch, the GTD-5 EAX. Like the Western Electric 1ESS/1AESS, it served mostly medium to large wire centers. The standalone VCDX was also capable of serving as a switch for very small wire centers (a CDX- Community <b>dial</b> <b>office)</b> of fewer than ~400 lines. However, for small wire centers, 400-4000 lines, that function was usually served by RSM's, a 5ESS [...] "Remote SM". The RSM is controlled over redundant and diverse fiber optic [...] "umbilicals". An RSM can {{have more than one}} SM, and also many other peripheral units that are part of a full 5ESS switch. An RSM can serve parts of a larger metro area, but is more often used as a Class-5 wire center for small to medium towns hosted from a 5ESS located in a larger city.The VCDX was also used as a large private branch exchange (PBX). The standalone VCDX has a single Switching Module, and no Communications Module. Its Sun Microsystems SPARC workstation runs the UNIX-based Solaris (operating system) that executes a 3B20/21D processor MERT OS emulation system, acting as the VCDX's Administrative Module. The VCDX uses the CO's normal telephone power sources (which are very large uninterruptible power supply's), and has connections to the CO Digital cross connect system for T1 access, etc.|$|E

50|$|The usual seven-digit US {{telephone}} number {{consists of a}} three-digit office code and a four-digit line number within the given office. After a caller in a panel <b>office</b> <b>dialed</b> the <b>office</b> code, the sender looked up the type of the called office (panel, manual, etc.), and whether PCI was to be used. Then the sender found a trunk to the called office. Once a trunk had been found and {{the decision to use}} PCI had been made, the sender outpulsed the digits to the manual office where they were displayed for the operator.|$|R

50|$|In several cases, overlay {{plans were}} {{implemented}} {{on a special}} case basis to implement specialised dialing plans. In some areas, a party in one area code could <b>dial</b> an <b>office</b> prefix which was local, but in a different area code, with only 7 digits. If they were calling a distant office prefix {{in the same area}} code, they would either have to dial 1 and the number or 1+area code+number.|$|R
50|$|Also, {{when the}} panel office was designed, many people used party lines. Party line numbers were listed with a J, M, R, or W {{following}} the line number. The caller <b>dialed</b> the <b>office</b> code, the line number, and the digit {{corresponding to the}} letter. Party letters replace the ten-thousands digit described above. That is, PCI sends the letter followed by the four-digit line number. So party letters and line numbers above 10,000 can't be used together.|$|R
50|$|The {{corresponding}} {{service to}} DID for outgoing calls from a PBX {{to the central}} office exchange is called direct outward dialing (DOD) or Direct <b>Dial</b> Central <b>Office</b> (DDCO). This service is often combined with DID service and allows direct dialing of global telephone numbers by every extension covered by the service without the assistance of an operator. The caller line identification (CLI) or caller-id of extensions for outgoing calls is often set to the extension DID number, but may be the organization's central switch board number.|$|R
50|$|Trunk {{lines are}} used for {{connecting}} a private branch exchange (PBX) to a telephone service provider. When needed {{they can be used}} by any telephone connected to the PBX, while the station lines to the extensions serve only one station telephones. Trunking saves cost, because there are usually fewer trunk lines than extension lines, since it is unusual in most offices to have all extension lines in use for external calls at once. Trunk lines transmit voice and data in formats such as analog, T1, E1, ISDN or PRI. The dial tone lines for outgoing calls are called DDCO (Direct <b>Dial</b> Central <b>Office)</b> trunks.|$|R
40|$|In the photo, an {{employee}} of a real estate firm is contacting his office by means of HICOM, an advanced central terminal for mobile telephones. Developed by the Orlando Division of Martin Marietta Aerospace, Orlando, Florida, and manufactured by Harris Corporation's RF Division, Rochester, N. Y., HICOM upgrades service to users, provides better system management to telephone companies, and makes more efficient use of available mobile telephone channels through a computerized central control terminal. The real estate man, for example, was able to <b>dial</b> his <b>office</b> and he could also have direct-dialed a long distance number. Mobile phones in most areas not yet served by HICOM require an operator's assistance for both local and long distance calls. HICOM improves system management by automatically recording information on all calls for accurate billing, running continual performance checks on its own operation, and reporting any malfunctions to a central office...|$|R
50|$|In {{business}} telephony, {{a telephone}} extension may {{refer to a}} phone on an internal telephone line attached to a private branch exchange (PBX) or Centrex system. The PBX operates much as a community switchboard does for a geographic telephone numbering plan and allows multiple lines inside the office to connect without each phone requiring a separate outside line. In these systems, one usually has to dial a number (typically 9 in North America, 0 in Europe) to tell the PBX to connect with an outside landline (also called DDCO, or Direct <b>Dial</b> Central <b>Office)</b> to <b>dial</b> an external number. Within the PBX, the user merely dials the extension number to reach any other user directly. For inbound calls, a switchboard operator or automated attendant may request {{the number of the}} desired extension or the call may be completed with direct inbound dialing if outside numbers are assigned to individual extensions.|$|R
5000|$|Before modern {{electronic}} telephone switching systems came into use, dial tones were usually generated by electromechanical means. In the United States, the standard [...] "city" [...] dial tone was a 600 Hz tone that was amplitude-modulated at 120 Hz. Some dial tones were simply adapted from 60 Hz AC line current. In the UK, the standard Post <b>Office</b> <b>dialling</b> tone was 33 Hz; it was {{generated by a}} motor-driven ringing machine in most exchanges, and by a vibrating-reed generator in the smaller ones. Some later ringing machines also generated a 50 Hz dial tone.|$|R
50|$|When built, the {{building}} had its business office on the first floor, with space for customers to transact business with the phone company, public telephone booths, and rooms for long distance calls. The next 12 floors contained telephone equipment, such as long distance switchboards, other special switchboards, and <b>dial</b> central <b>office</b> equipment for the MAin, ATlantic, and BRidgeport central offices. There were also breakroom facilities and a lunch room for telephone operators who were off duty. The 14th, 25th, and 26th floors were mechanical floors. Finally, a tower on the 15th through 24th floors housed administrative offices of the telephone company. There were also three basement floors with power and heating equipment, along with cable vaults. The building measured 346 ft above street level, 42 ft in the basements, and had 26 stories. Many of these stories were somewhat taller than those in office buildings due {{to the size of}} central office equipment. The building had 24000 sq ft of floor space, and housed about 1,000 employees.|$|R
50|$|States {{that were}} divided into {{multiple}} areas were assigned area codes with a 1 in the middle, the second position, while areas that covered an entire state or province, were numbered with the digit 0 as the middle digit. In order to distinguish seven-digit dialing from ten-digit <b>dialing,</b> central <b>office</b> codes were restricted to not having a 0 or 1 in the middle position. This was already common practice, because the system of using the initial letters of central office names did not assign letters to digits 1 and 0. Furthermore, area codes and central office codes could not start with 0 or 1, because 0 was used for operator assistance, and a leading single pulse, i.e. the digit 1, was automatically ignored by most switching equipment of the time. Additionally, the last two digits of an area code could not be the same, so that the assignments N00 and N11 (N = 2-9) were reserved for special purposes, as some central offices had been using them already for special services. The area codes N10 were reserved similarly and most {{were used for the}} Teletypewriter Exchange Service (TWX).|$|R

5000|$|A {{relic of}} these {{differences}} is found in emergency telephone numbers used in various countries; the United Kingdom selected 999 due to the ease of converting call <b>office</b> <b>dials</b> to make free calls. [...] "0" [...] for the Operator was already free, and the cam that removed the shunt on the line when the dial was rotated to the [...] "0" [...] position could be altered to include the adjacent digit [...] "9" [...] (and [...] "8" [...] if required) so that calls to [...] "0" [...] and [...] "999" [...] could be made without inserting coins.

50|$|The 300 {{series was}} much more than just the Tele. 332. There was a whole range of {{similarly}} designed products. Fieldsets (Tappers), Headsets, Pendant Telephones, Wall Phones and the House Exchange System. Many Private Telephone Companies had sprung up in the UK. As these were banned by law from connecting to external lines, they contented themselves with producing systems for automatically <b>dialling</b> between company <b>offices,</b> within the same building or, via private wires, rented from the GPO, virtually anywhere. The GPO could only do this via PMBXs (manual switchboards), ranging from the 2 to 5 line cordless boards, via the 25 and 50 line plug and cord boards to the mighty PMBX 1A, which, with its modular construction, could be any size a large company might require. The GPO regarded the Private Telephone Companies as a thorn in their flesh and a great loss of potential income. They decided to tap into this lucrative market. Initially they produced a system virtually identical to the competition and called it the House Telephone System. This appeared, from the rear, like a Tele. 332 but the front sloped down and was covered in two rows of buttons, by which a few other, similar, extensions could be called. Like the competition this system was entirely internal and could not connect to the PSTN (Public Service Telephone Network). Unlike the competition, however, the number of extensions which could be incorporated was strictly limited. The GPO tried again.|$|R
