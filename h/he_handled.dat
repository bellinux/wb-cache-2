5|$|After the 1896 launch {{was called}} off, enthusiasm {{declined}} for joining the expedition {{for a second}} attempt in 1897. From the candidates Andrée picked the 27-year-old engineer, Knut Frænkel, to replace Ekholm. Frænkel was a civil engineer from the north of Sweden, an athlete who was fond of long mountain hikes. He was enrolled specifically to take over Ekholm's meteorological observations. Despite lacking Ekholm's theoretical and scientific knowledge, <b>he</b> <b>handled</b> this task efficiently. His meteorological journal has enabled researchers to reconstruct {{the movements of the}} three men during their last few months with considerable precision.|$|E
5|$|Carlsen faced Anand in the World Chess Championship 2013, at Hyatt Regency in Chennai, India, from 9 to 22 November. Carlsen won {{the match}} 6½–3½ by winning games five, six and nine and drawing the remainder. Thus, Carlsen became the new World Chess Champion. Though Carlsen was the challenger, and less {{experienced}} than Anand, <b>he</b> <b>handled</b> the pressure with ease. He drew first blood in game 5 by {{taking advantage of}} a small mistake made by Anand, and emerged victorious in games 6 and 9, making him the 16th undisputed World Chess Champion.|$|E
5|$|During Gladbach's opening {{match of}} the 2013–14 season against Bayern Munich, Domínguez conceded a penalty when <b>he</b> <b>handled</b> {{the ball in}} the box. Thomas Müller's {{resultant}} penalty was saved by goalkeeper Marc-André ter Stegen but Domínguez handled again from the rebound, giving away a second penalty which was duly converted by David Alaba. Gladbach ultimately lost the match 3–1. It was an injury-disrupted season for Domínguez, though, as early in October he suffered a broken collarbone and dislocated shoulder. He managed just 22 appearances for the campaign, and 34 in the next before a spate of back injuries severely curtailed his playing time in the seasons that followed.|$|E

5|$|Guitarist Chris Poland {{and drummer}} Gar Samuelson had been {{expelled}} from the band following {{the conclusion of the}} Peace Sells tour for disruptive behavior, including Poland's habit of pawning band equipment to pay for drugs. Samuelson was immediately replaced by his drum technician, Chuck Behler. However, a new guitarist would take longer to emerge. At first, the band hired guitarist Jay Reynolds from the band Malice, but Reynolds was not up to the task of recording, and was subsequently replaced by his guitar teacher, Jeff Young. Dave Mustaine has since stated his regret for the way <b>he</b> <b>handled</b> Reynolds's firing.|$|E
5|$|In 1947, Cariappa was {{the first}} of two Indians {{selected}} to undergo training at the Imperial Defence College, at Camberly, in the UK, to attend the higher command courses. With the experience he had gained at the Imperial Defence College, Cariappa felt that dividing the Indian Army during the partition would have a devastating effect on both sides. He explained to the hierarchy that without the help of British officers, there was a risk of inexperienced Indian officers taking over higher commands. But his concern was not addressed. During the disquieting period of partition <b>he</b> <b>handled</b> the division of the Army and sharing of its assets between the two new nations as the officer in charge.|$|E
5|$|Most of Clarke's time in England {{was during}} the Interregnum, when rule {{of the country was}} under Parliament and Oliver Cromwell as the Lord Protector. Clarke's primary purpose there was to secure a {{strengthened}} charter for the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations ensuring the religious liberties on which the colony had been founded, and Cromwell confirmed the validity of Rhode Island's 1643 patent. Clarke also assisted the colony in 1656 by sending home four barrels of powder and eight barrels of shot and bullets, and in 1657 <b>he</b> <b>handled</b> a letter from the colony requesting assistance with legal proceedings against William Harris.|$|E

He was involved directly with English policy towards Spain, the Netherlands, Scotland, Ireland and France, and embarked on several diplomatic missions to neighbouring European states.|$|E
5|$|Gillom {{signed with}} the Browns, an AAFC team coached by Brown, in 1947. <b>He</b> <b>handled</b> all of the team's punting chores and played as a utility end on both offense and defense. Gillom's Cleveland teams won three {{straight}} AAFC championships before the league dissolved and the Browns were absorbed by the NFL. The Browns won the NFL championship in 1950 and repeated in 1954 and 1955. Gillom was a consistent punter, never averaging below 41.2 yards per kick in a season. His abilities declined in his later years, however, and he was released during the 1956 season. Gillom attempted a comeback in 1961 with the New York Titans of the American Football League, but {{failed to make the}} team. He moved to Los Angeles and worked as a security guard {{for the rest of his}} life. Gillom died of a heart attack in 1985. He was named in 2007 as a Cleveland Browns Legend, a grouping of the team's best-ever players.|$|E
5|$|Howard {{repeatedly}} questions Vaughn, {{believing he}} is {{acting as the}} fall guy for his two friends. Vaughn says nothing, but eventually writes a letter of apology to Ellison. Felton closes the case despite Howard's protests for more time to investigate. Vaughn eventually pleads guilty at his arraignment and insists on serving life without parole. Marvin and Tweety are sentenced to 30 years in prison, but Ellison tells Howard he feels no comfort because his wife is still dead. Howard tries to give Vaughn's letter to Ellison, but he refuses to accept it. Howard eventually speaks directly to Vaughn in prison, where Vaughn admits <b>he</b> <b>handled</b> the gun during the stick-up because he thought {{if he had the}} gun, he could control the situation and prevent anyone from getting hurt. Vaughn said he lost control of the robbery, and insists he needs to serve the life sentence to make amends. A devastated Howard finally agrees with Felton's opinion that Vaughn was indeed the shooter.|$|E

5|$|In 1967, Brooke-Little was {{advanced}} {{to the position of}} Richmond Herald. On 7 July 1980, after almost thirty years of service to the Earl Marshal and the College of Arms, Brooke-Little was appointed to replace Sir Walter Verco as Norroy and Ulster King of Arms, with heraldic authority in the part of England north of the Trent, as well as in Northern Ireland. While serving in that office, he enjoyed telling people that the commonly held view that the Order of Saint Patrick was extinct was quite false. Brooke-Little believed that as the Ulster King of Arms – the capacity in which <b>he</b> <b>handled</b> Northern Irish heraldry – he remained ex officio an Officer of the Order. As the holder of that office, he and his successors would remain the Order's King of Arms, Registrar and Knight Attendant, until such time as the Sovereign should choose formally to abolish the office of Ulster King of Arms or to declare that these positions are not vested in the office. The fact that the last knight had died in 1974 was of little consequence to such a staunch traditionalist.|$|E
5|$|After fans likened Naruto, Sasuke Uchiha and Sakura Haruno to {{the three}} main {{characters}} from Harry Potter fantasy books, Kishimoto noted that both trios began their careers in a classroom, though {{he added that the}} similarity was unintentional. During the series' publication, Kishimoto married and had children. This influenced how he viewed Naruto's character. Naruto met his parents, and learned of their sacrifices in order to help him to control the Fox inside him so that he could protect their world. As a result, Naruto appreciated his life more and learned that his parents loved him, something the author wanted the character to feel based on his own experience as a father. In the first chapters of the series, Kishimoto did not conceive the idea that Naruto would be the son of Minato Namikaze. However, as time passed on, the manga author made touches to Minato's face shown in the Hokage Mountain in Konoha to make them more similar to Naruto with an emphasis on their spiky hairs. However, in order to reduce too many similarities, Kushina Uzumaki's character was made to look like Naruto's face. Kishimoto's first editor, Kosuke Yahagi, praised the author for the way <b>he</b> <b>handled</b> Naruto's parents and his heritage.|$|E
5|$|The first {{work that}} Ito {{composed}} after leaving Square was the soundtrack to Culdcept II, which he regards as his best work. He attributes this feeling {{both to the}} fact that it was his first freelance piece and that <b>he</b> <b>handled</b> all aspects of the music production, from composition through arrangement and sound production. From there he returned to working with Square and the Mana series with the remake of his second soundtrack, Final Fantasy Adventure, into the soundtrack of Sword of Mana. It was an act he would repeat two years later for Square, now Square Enix, with the remake of Romancing SaGa, Romancing SaGa: Minstrel Song. He has since returned to the Mana series twice, with the soundtracks to Children of Mana and Dawn of Mana. All of the video game soundtracks that he has composed since the third expansion pack for Cross Gate in 2004 have been with the assistance of other composers except for 2007's Hero Must Die, though during those years he has branched out from video games into composing and producing albums and singles for performers as well as composing music for plays and concerts. He has also released an album of piano pieces that he has composed; only two of the eight tracks are from his video game works.|$|E
