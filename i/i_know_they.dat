So we started the PBR dollar-can special. I'd say it was around 1997 or 1998. At one point, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>they</b> said we were the largest distributor of Pabst in the state, if not the country. We got written up in The New York Times about it. We were going through hundreds of cases and dozens of kegs a week.|$|E

She collaborated with artist Camilla d'Errico and writer Joshua Dysart on the manga, which was about a shy girl named Hana who, upon meeting her hero, Lavigne, learned to overcome her fears. Lavigne said, [...] "I know that many of my fans read manga, and I'm really excited {{to be involved in}} creating stories that <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>they</b> will enjoy."

500|$|When {{discussing}} Tumbling Dice, {{recording engineer}} Andy Johns stated, that {{recording of the}} song was [...] "like pulling teeth" [...] due to the {{extended period of time}} it took to get a satisfactory take. Johns has claimed that there were between thirty and one hundred reels of tape on the base track of the song. Some have said that it may have taken as many as 150 takes to get the basic track of the song. The mixing of the album was also difficult, Jagger has never liked the final mix of the song, stating in an interview with Melody Maker, [...] "I think they used the wrong mix for that one. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>they</b> did." ...|$|E

500|$|Jim Reid's piece {{appeared}} in The Observer on 25 September 1994. This is [...] "one {{of the most}} peculiar stories of the year", he cautioned readers. [...] "Peculiar because pretty much everyone who comes across this magazine {{is going to have}} trouble believing a word of it. Peculiar because every last dot and comma of what is to come is the truth." [...] "It took about two hours for that cash to go up in flames", he added. [...] "I looked at it closely, it was real. It came from a bona fide security firm and was not swapped at any time on our journey. More importantly, perhaps, after working with the K Foundation <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>they</b> are capable of this." ...|$|E
500|$|The country's sole {{female athlete}} at the 2016 Games was Maryan Nuh Muse, in the 400 metres. Muse had {{previously}} competed {{on behalf of}} Somalia at international youth athletic competitions around the world. Prior to the competition, she spoke {{of the difference in}} the quality of the training facilities in Somalia compared to those in other countries, saying [...] "A number of countries will be participating among them Jamaica and United States; but I am hoping to shine. We don’t have the same training facilities, theirs is better than ours. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>they</b> are determined to win but we are also equally determined." [...] She competed in the sixth heat of the 400 metres competition on 13 August; she came in last place with a time of 1:10:14, over 18 seconds behind the heat's winner Salwa Eid Naser of Bahrain.|$|E
500|$|On 26 January 2009, Rehman {{signed a}} loan deal with League Two club Bradford City, {{which was to}} last {{until the end of}} the 2008–09 season. Rehman had turned down a chance to move to Luton Town and team up with Mick Harford, who was {{previously}} the assistant manager at QPR, and said he was only prepared to drop down to League Two if he joined Bradford City. Rehman said of the move, [...] "I was only prepared to drop down the leagues to play for this club. I spoke to the manager and chairmen and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>they</b> want to get Bradford back up to where they belong. I've been involved in relegation battles in the past and it's nice to be joining a club pushing for promotion – that's a good pressure to have." [...] He made his debut the following day in a 1–0 defeat to Bury at Gigg Lane, and in doing so became the first British Asian to play in all four divisions of professional football in England. He made his home debut on 31 January, playing at right back, in a 2–0 home win over Grimsby Town at Valley Parade. In March he turned down the chance to play for Pakistan in the Asian Football Confederation Challenge Cup qualifiers in order to help Bradford's push for promotion.|$|E
5000|$|McCullough has had {{a lifelong}} {{interest}} in aviation. In {{an interview with the}} Santa Barbara Independent, he remarked, [...] "I loved to make model airplanes when I was a young boy and I took flying lessons later on; I would have continued if they weren’t so expensive. But I have to say in all candor that <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> very little about Wright brothers. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>they</b> were from Ohio, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>they</b> were bicycles mechanics, and <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>they</b> invented the airplane. But <b>I</b> really didn’t <b>know</b> anything beyond that of any substance..." [...] He added, [...] "Once I got into their lives and into all that they went through and the truly admirable human qualities that they personified, I would have wanted to write the book even if they hadn't succeeded in inventing the flying machine." ...|$|R

[...] "Between Andrea Dworkin and Kitty MacKinnon, they've written so many books, and they mention my name and all that, but financially they've never helped me out. When I showed up with them for {{speaking}} engagements, I'd always get five hundred dollars or so. But <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>they</b> made a few bucks off me, just like everybody else." [...] Thus Tom Leonard, writing for the London Daily Mail on March 26, 2012, alleged that both the porn industry and the anti-pornography movement had taken advantage of her.|$|E

2500|$|In 2005, Coetzee criticised {{contemporary}} anti-terrorism laws as resembling those {{employed by}} the apartheid regime in South Africa: [...] "I {{used to think that}} the people who created [...] laws that effectively suspended the rule of law were moral barbarians. Now <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>they</b> were just pioneers ahead of their time". The main character in Coetzee's 2007 Diary of a Bad Year, which has been described as blending [...] "memoir with fiction, academic criticism with novelistic narration" [...] and refusing [...] "to recognize the border that has traditionally separated political theory from fictional narrative", shares similar concerns about the policies of John Howard and George W.

2500|$|Archbishop Kyprianos was defiant in his death. He {{was aware}} of his fate and {{impending}} death, yet stood by the Greek cause. He is revered throughout Cyprus as a noble patriot and defender of the Orthodox faith and Hellenic cause. An English explorer {{by the name of}} Carne spoke to the Archbishop before the events of 9 July, who was quoted as saying: [...] "My death is not far away. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>they</b> [...] are waiting for an opportunity to kill me". Kyprianos chose to stay, despite these fears, and provide protection and counsel for the people of Cyprus as their leader. To this day, his response (in the form of a poem) to Küçük Mehmet's declaration (seen in the previous paragraph) to kill the Greeks of Cyprus in mass purges maintains legendary status in Cyprus and Greece.|$|E

After being released three days later, Coretta's husband {{was sent back to}} jail on October 22 for driving with an Alabama license while being a resident of Georgia and was sent to jail for four months of hard labor. After her husband's arrest, King believed he would not make it out alive and telephoned her friend Harris Wofford and cried while saying [...] "They're going to kill him. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>they</b> are going to kill him." [...] Directly after speaking with her, Wofford contacted Sargent Shriver in Chicago, where presidential candidate John F. Kennedy was campaigning at the time, and told Shriver of King's fears for her husband. After Shriver waited to be with Kennedy alone, he suggested that he telephone King and express sympathy. Kennedy called King, after agreeing with the proposal.|$|E
2500|$|To the {{backdrop}} of the June 1975 Italian elections, Fo wrote Il Fanfani rapito (Fanfani Kidnapped)—a reference to Amintore Fanfani. Also in June 1975, Fo, Rame {{and other members of the}} company went to China—Fo later used his recollections of the trip in the monologue La storia della tigre (The Tale of a Tiger), with which he toured around Italy in 1978. The same year (1975) Fo was nominated for the Nobel Prize for the first time. He thought the idea absurd: [...] "I have become famous for my aversion to figures of reverence and genuflections of any kind. This Nobel business is a real comedy. I can imagine the look on the faces of certain state officials, magistrates and politicians <b>I</b> <b>know.</b> <b>They</b> take great pains to shut me up and clap me in handcuffs, and the Swedes go and play a trick like this ... would be like acting in one of my plays." ...|$|E

All of the men had hidden their faces. The four men in police uniform rushed up the stairs and herded the males into the dining room. The women were taken into another room. Eliza [...] "got down on her knees and pleaded for mercy, but was struck {{on the side of the}} head and fell to the floor". When Owen asked why his family was being singled-out, one of the gunmen said it was because he was [...] "a respected papist".

At the same time, they make it easy for non-gamers, or people who wish they were gamers (ie: me) to understand. Bits and pieces feel really awkward though, and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>they</b> put in awkward moments for comedic effect sometimes, but I find that these don't always have the comedic effect that they're probably going for, and end up going full circle just being plain awkward". It argues the [...] "small size and down-to-earth-ness" [...] of the show adds to its charm, by saying [...] "a commercial version of the show would be way too polished and just wouldn't feel right".

And it's also Bill Drummond and Jimmy Cauty's final extravagant howl of self disgust, defiance and contempt for a music world gone foul and corrupt." [...] Many of the KLF's friends and collaborators gave their reactions in the magazine. Movie director Bill Butt said that [...] "Like everything, they're dealing with it in a very realistic way, a fresh, unbitter way, which is very often not the case. A lot of bands disappear with such a terrible loss of dignity". Scott Piering said that [...] "They've got a huge buzz off this, that's for sure, because it's something that's finally thrilling. It's scary to have thrown away a fortune which <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>they</b> have. Just the idea of starting over is exciting. Starting over on what? Well, they have such great ideas, like buying submarines". Even Kenny Gates, who as a director of the KLF's distributors APT stood to lose financially from the move, called it [...] "Conceptually and philosophically... absolutely brilliant". Mark Stent reported the doubts of many when he said that [...] "I [...] had so many people who I know, heads of record companies, A men saying, 'Come on, It's a big scam.' But I firmly believe it's over". [...] "For the very last spectacularly insane time", the magazine concluded, [...] "The KLF have done what was least expected of them".|$|E
