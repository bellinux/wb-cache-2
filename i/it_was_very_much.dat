And we got to do what we love the most, which is just fashion and making {{beautiful}} images, and not having any rules. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> on the fly. We went downtown to the abandoned Sears building; it’s all destroyed and creepy in there. We were there for two days and it was like an art project.|$|E
5|$|The humid weather {{meant that}} the game was played at a {{relatively}} slow pace, which seemed to favour Porto. This caused a number of rash challenges from Celtic, one of which led to Joos Valgaeren getting a yellow card on 8 minutes. After this <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> a stoic affair, until 32 minutes into the first half when Capucho played in Deco, but he could {{do no more than}} fire his shot straight at Celtic's goalkeeper Robert Douglas. Straight after this attack Celtic broke on the counter with Henrik Larsson, putting Didier Agathe through on the right, but his cross was too high for Chris Sutton. Larsson had a chance to make it 1–0 on 35 minutes, but from Sutton's assist he was unable to make enough contact with the ball. Porto came close on 41 minutes when Deco moved past Bobo Baldé to go one on one against Robert Douglas, who saved Deco's shot with his legs. Porto finally found a way through on 45 minutes when, after an offensive play from Deco, Derlei followed up Dmitri Alenichev's shot on target, which had been saved by Robert Douglas. This gave Porto a 1–0 lead on the stroke of half time and Derlei's 11th goal of the competition.|$|E
5|$|Screenwriter Gidding, who {{had worked}} with {{director}} Wise on the 1958 film I Want to Live!, began a six-month write of the script after reading the book, which Wise had given to him. He perceived the book to be more about mental breakdown than ghosts, and although he was informed after meeting author Shirley Jackson that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> a supernatural novel, elements of mental breakdown were introduced into the film. The film was shot at MGM-British Studios in the United Kingdom on a budget of US$1.05 million, with exteriors and the grounds shot at Ettington Park (now the Ettington Park Hotel) in the village of Ettington, Warwickshire. Julie Harris was cast by Wise who found her ideal for the psychologically fragile Eleanor, though during production she suffered from depression and had an uneasy relationship with her co-stars. The interior sets were by Elliot Scott, credited by Wise as instrumental in the making of The Haunting. They were designed to be brightly lit, with no dark corners or recesses, and decorated in a Rococo style; all the rooms had ceilings to create a claustrophobic effect on film. Numerous devices and tricks were used in the filming. Wise used a 30mm anamorphic, wide-angle lens Panavision camera that was not technically ready for use and caused distortions. It was only given to Wise on condition that he sign a memorandum in which he acknowledged that the lens was imperfect. Wise and cinematographer Davis Boulton planned sequences that kept the camera moving, utilizing low-angle takes, and incorporating unusual pans and tracking shots.|$|E

They warned that King Albert of the Belgians planned to evacuate Antwerp. Churchill later claimed that it has been a collective decision that he should go to Antwerp but Sir Edward Grey later wrote, more plausibly in historian John Charmley’s view, that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> Churchill’s idea.|$|E

25|$|A {{problem with}} BBC News output at the time, was that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> {{fragmented}} with different brands. BBC News bulletins, BBC Breakfast News and BBC News 24 all had separate identities. To solve this, a major relaunch of all BBC News television output, {{with the exception}} of Breakfast News, in 1999 saw the channel adopt a common theme {{with the rest of the}} BBC's main news bulletins. The redesign involved a new cream and red colour scheme together with a large numeral, representing the time of the bulletin on the domestic bulletins, but replaced with '24' for the channel, as well as a variation on the new musical composition by David Lowe.|$|E
25|$|Lawrence {{returned}} to the musical stage in Lady in the Dark in 1941. It originally had been planned as a play with recurrent musical themes for Katharine Cornell by Moss Hart, Kurt Weill and Ira Gershwin, {{but by the time}} the first act was completed it was clear <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> a musical that Cornell agreed was beyond her capability as a performer. Soon after this, Hart met Lawrence at a rehearsal for a revue designed to raise funds for British War Relief, and he offered her the role of Liza Elliott, a magazine editor undergoing psychoanalysis to better understand why both her professional and personal lives are filled with indecision.|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} the temple is not known clearly. Different {{communities}} put {{their own version of}} it. There are many beliefs regarding the antiquity and history of this splendid, miraculous and extraordinary idol. This idol was in Lanka. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> worshipped in the times Bhagawan Munisuvrat Swami. Ramchandraji took it to Ayodhya. Then it was in Ujjain. In course of time, it appeared under a banyan tree outside Vatpradnagar. It was worshipped for some years. Again it appeared under a tree at distance of one kilometer from the village. This is the Chief Tirth of Jains in the Mevad State. A fair is held here every year on the eighth day of the dark half of the month of Fagan. With all the five fingers, people worship God here with Saffron. They give a gift of saffron to God. Bhils, know God by the name of ‘Kalababa’. Non - Jain devotees come here with faith. Since centuries, there is a custom of giving saffron to God as a gift. Sometimes so much saffron is plastered on God, that God looks saffron - colored. People, therefore, call God Kesariyanath.|$|E

500|$|Discussing his onscreen {{relationship}} with Yang, McKidd said: [...] "It's {{not going to}} be easy for them. What I read when I read the season premiere, and this is just my take on it, is that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> two very analytical people, Owen and Cristina. They're very similar in a way, I think, as people. Two analytical people see each other over a crowded ER room and their eyes meet." [...] On the topic of Yang's triumphs and challenges in the eighth season, Oh said: [...] "It has been an extremely challenging year that has had a lot of ups and downs, both challenging and exhilarating. We would shoot all our scenes for a day or two straight, and that was extremely challenging because emotionally and physically it becomes really exhausting." ...|$|E
500|$|While Jones is {{credited}} with writing the screenplay, the shooting script was actually a collaborative effort that featured contributions from Henson, George Lucas, Laura Phillips, and Elaine May. Jones himself {{has said that the}} finished film differs greatly from his original vision. According to Jones, [...] "I didn't feel that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> mine. I always felt it fell between two stories, Jim wanted it to be one thing and I wanted it to be about something else." [...] Jones has said his version of the script was [...] "about the world, and about people who are more interested in manipulating the world than actually baring themselves at all." [...] In Jones' original script, Jareth merely seems [...] "all powerful to begin with" [...] and is actually using the Labyrinth to [...] "keep people from getting to his heart." ...|$|E

New York magazine wrote about a clip that reveals the link between Timms and Pond: [...] "This footage is actually dirty. That is, it makes us feel like voyeurs when looking at it, but it's so juicily erotic that we can hardly look away". About nudity in the movie, Connelly said: [...] "It kind of shocked everyone who knows me that I wound up doing this movie, because I had always been so careful about nudity, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> a part of this character and I couldn't be coy or guarded or self-conscious--otherwise it wouldn't work. It was sort of a challenge I wanted to take on, I guess".|$|E

500|$|Berkman {{encouraged}} Diener and Boxenbaum {{to fly out}} to Los Angeles {{to watch}} a showcase gig at The Viper Room for the four-piece Kara's Flowers. After watching Levine onstage, they were convinced. Berkman told HitQuarters he believed what the band needed was a [...] "fifth member to play the guitar and free up the singer, {{so he could be}} the star I perceived him to be." [...] Octone immediately insisted that the band change its name to break with its pop past. Also, the label began looking for a full-time guitarist to enable Levine to focus on performing as the frontman. James Valentine (from the L.A. band Square) was recruited for the job. On his joining the band, Valentine commented: [...] "I became friends with them and we sort of started jamming together, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> like I was cheating on my band, we were having sort of an affair and I eventually quit my other band to join up with them." ...|$|E
500|$|Although {{this model}} would {{eventually}} be extremely successful, Scientology was a very small-scale movement at first. Hubbard started off {{with only a few}} dozen followers, generally dedicated Dianeticists; a seventy-hour series of lectures in Philadelphia in December 1952 was attended by just 38 people. Hubbard was joined in Phoenix by his 18-year-old son Nibs, who had been unable to settle down in high school. Nibs had decided to become a Scientologist, moved into his father's home and {{went on to become a}} Scientology staff member and [...] "professor". Hubbard also traveled to the United Kingdom to establish his control over a Dianetics group in London. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> a shoestring operation; as Helen O'Brien later recalled, [...] "there was an atmosphere of extreme poverty and undertones of a grim conspiracy over all. At 163 Holland Park Avenue was an ill-lit lecture room and a bare-boarded and poky office some eight by ten feet—mainly infested by long haired men and short haired and tatty women." [...] On September 24, 1952, only a few weeks after arriving in London, Hubbard's wife Mary Sue gave birth to her first child, a daughter whom they named Diana Meredith de Wolfe Hubbard.|$|E
500|$|MTV's Kevin P. Sullivan {{summarized}} the episode as follows: [...] "When all {{was said and}} done, it was another tribute episode, something that can't be uttered by a Glee fan without a sigh and an eye roll." [...] Bell noted that tribute episodes usually mean that [...] "all sense of plot continuity" [...] is forgone, but that this one ranked [...] "at the top {{of all of the}} other Glee tribute episodes because even though it was absurd at times, at least there was a plot—and it kind of made sense". Futterman was more complimentary and described it as the [...] "most effortless tribute episode yet", and Canning wrote that [...] "with songs we know and love and storylines that actually connected and delivered some meaningful and moving moments" [...] it was [...] "more than just a theme episode". Jen Chaney of The Washington Post, however, thought that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> like previous tributes in that it also [...] "featured scattered plot lines engineered to include as many songs by said artists as possible" [...] and also [...] "glorified their respective pop stars’ images to an absurd degree". The A.V. Club Todd VanDerWerff also noted the glorification of Jackson, and noted [...] "every time the show turns into an episode about Michael Jackson, it stops dead in its tracks entirely". He stated that what was [...] "weird" [...] about the episode was that [...] "what didn’t work was the spectacle, while what did work were the smaller, character-based stories" [...] which [...] "provided a spine some of the other spectacle-oriented episodes have lacked". Futterman was one of many reviewers who took note of a new feature of this tribute episode when she commented on the [...] "initial whiff of product placement and forced timing" [...] related to the [...] "Immortal World Tour" [...] dialogue. Rae Votta of Billboard thought the inclusion a [...] "brilliant bit of marketing synergy", but TVLine Michael Slezak called it [...] "ridiculously unsubtle product-placement".|$|E
