30|$|Adaptive filter {{automatically}} adapts {{the change}} of channel characteristics by adjusting the gain of each tap to achieve the best filtering effect. At present, the conventional adaptive filtering error extraction algorithms include zero forcing algorithm, {{minimum mean square error}} algorithm, constant modulus algorithm, and so on. Zero forcing algorithm is applicable to the conditions that give priority to inter symbol crosstalk and in which noise is relatively minor, such as the wired channel. In wireless systems, the effect of adaptive filter using zero forcing algorithm is poor due to noise <b>influence.</b> <b>Constant</b> modulus algorithm uses the high order statistic information of modulus for channel adaptive filtering, and it has the characteristics of rapid convergence and minor steady state error. But its algorithm is relatively complicated, unsuitable for application in the high-speed data transmission systems. This paper adopts the minimum mean square error algorithm to adaptively update the tap coefficient of adaptive filter to track the channel changes.|$|E

30|$|CMN is a GAW Global station {{operated}} by the Institute of Atmospheric Sciences and Climate of the National Research Council of Italy (ISAC-CNR). Mt. Cimone is the highest peak of the northern Italian Apennines {{and is the only}} high mountain station for atmospheric research located between the Southern Alps and the northern Mediterranean Sea. The Apennines are the first mountain chain affected by air masses from the Sahara on their way to Europe (Bonasoni et al. 2004). The station is considered to be representative of the baseline conditions of the Mediterranean FT (Bonasoni et al. 2000 a; Fischer et al. 2003). Even during the warm seasons, the influence of the boundary layer air is substantial owing to convection and the mountain breeze (Fischer et al. 2003; Van Dingenen et al. 2005). The Mediterranean basin is located at the boundary between the tropical zone and northern mid-latitudes. It serves as a crossroad for air masses originating from Europe, Asia, and Africa, where anthropogenic emissions encounter natural emissions (Kanakidou et al. 2011; Lelieveld et al. 2002). Henne et al. (2010) classified CMN as a “weakly <b>influenced,</b> <b>constant</b> deposition” site.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{compares the}} {{evolution}} of working conditions and core labour rights in Asian and non-Asian economies in the late 20 th and early 21 st century and analyses the relationship between labour conditions and international trade and investment flows. Labour conditions generally improved throughout the globalisation of recent decades. Real per capita income growth remains a powerful source of improved labour conditions, {{and the effect of}} trade on working conditions is mainly indirect through its impact on GDP. Trade has had both direct and indirect impacts on some labour rights, but the direct effects seem to have diminished by the early 21 st century. We find no evidence that persistent differences in labour conditions between Asia {{and the rest of the}} world can be explained by differences in growth and international trade. We also find no evidence that countries with poor labour conditions attract disproportionate flows of foreign direct investment. Instead, FDI flows seem mainly influenced by considerations of market size, investment risks, and the share of trade in GDP. Even after holding those <b>influences</b> <b>constant,</b> the Asia region receives a comparatively small share of world FDI inflows.
