500|$|The {{marriage}} {{was in the}} process of breaking down rapidly. Northrup and Hubbard had frequent rows and his violent behaviour towards her continued unabated. On one occasion, while Northrup was pregnant, Hubbard kicked her several times in the stomach in an apparent – though unsuccessful – attempt to induce an abortion. She recalled that [...] "with or without an argument, there'd be an upsurge of violence. The veins in his forehead would engorge" [...] and he would hit her [...] "out of the blue", breaking her eardrum in one attack. Despite this, she still [...] "felt so guilty about the fact that he was so psychologically damaged. I felt as though he had given so much to our country and I couldn't even bring him peace of mind. I believed thoroughly that he was a man of great honor, had sacrificed his well being to the country ... It just never occurred to me he was a liar." [...] He told her that he didn't want to be married [...] "for <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>buy</b> my friends whenever I want them" [...] but he could not divorce either, as the stigma would hurt his reputation. Instead, he said, if Northrup really loved him she should kill herself.|$|E

In a 2010 op-ed for The Independent, Nash wrote, [...] "I spend so much time ... trying to get the world to judge me on anything other than my breasts and body shape." ... I am liberated by many things ... a world where I can be free sexually, I can wear revealing clothing if I want to, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>buy</b> condoms, go on the pill, get the coil, talk about sex, write about it if I wish." ...|$|E
2500|$|The music {{industry}} suggested that iPods {{have a substantial}} and legitimate commercial use in contrast to Grokster, to which Souter replied, [...] "I know perfectly well that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>buy</b> a CD {{and put it on}} my iPod. But I also know if I can get music without buying it, I'm going to do so." [...] On the other hand, the justices seemed troubled at the prospect of ruling that Grokster's alleged business model of actively inducing infringement and then reaping the commercial benefits was shielded from liability. Grokster argued that affirming the Ninth Circuit would only prevent an injunction against future use of the P2P software, while the plaintiffs would still be free to pursue damages in the district court for alleged past wrongful acts. Much of the Court, however, expressed skepticism that Grokster's continuing enterprise could be severable from the consequences of those prior acts.|$|E

5000|$|But many {{families}} in the 1980s were giving {{up the idea of}} ever buying a house. This led many young Japanese to spend part of their savings on trips abroad, expensive consumer items, and other luxuries. As one young worker put it, [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>can</b> never <b>buy</b> a house, at least <b>I</b> <b>can</b> use my money to enjoy life now". As credit card and finance agency facilities expanded, the use of credit to procure other consumer durables was spreading. By 1989, the number of credit cards issued in Japan reached virtual parity with the population.|$|R

Our B-sides were never an afterthought, because it was all about the whole package. The single cover looked like the tracks inside and songs worked with each other.

30|$|Consider an IMS {{consisting}} of M interconnected MGs through a power interconnection infrastructure and a communication network. Let E_i^(g) and E_i^(c) be the generation {{and consumption of}} MG i during each scheduling time slot, respectively. MG i is allowed to sell energy E_i,j(E_i,j> 0) to MG j, j <b>i,</b> and <b>can</b> <b>buy</b> energy E_k,i(E_k,i> 0) from MG k, k i. In order to describe the connection between MGs, an adjacency matrix A=[a_i,j]_M× M is defined. If there exits a connection from MG i to MG j, element a_i,j is set as 1; otherwise, element a_i,j is set to be 0. Thus, A may be nonsymmetric, meaning {{that at least two}} MGs are allowed to exchange energy in one direction only. Moreover, we choose a_i,i= 0, and if a_i,j= 0, we can directly have E_i,j= 0.|$|R

Now I will go upstairs and fetch down his clothes and burn them. If a search should be made they will assuredly excite suspicion if found in a house occupied only by women." ...|$|R

It {{was out of my}} power you know, to speak to you when you were absent about what I intended to do. Besides, I was, at the time, very much in need of some ready money, for, although I am rich enough, there are times when most of my capital is what business men called `locked up,' and therefore not immediately available. In these circumstances, Marizano came to me with a very tempting offer.
