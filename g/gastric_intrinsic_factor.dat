The 'extrinsic factor' is now known as vitamin B12 (cobalamin) and provides an effective therapy for pernicious anemia.|$|E
5000|$|Vitamin B12 is an {{essential}} water-soluble vitamin, the absorption of which relies on a functional secretion of salivary haptocorrin, functional secretion of <b>gastric</b> <b>intrinsic</b> <b>factor,</b> functional cleavage of the haptocorrin via pancreatic protease, and a functional absorption via the Cubam at terminal ileum. As expected, a defect at any point of the aforementioned list, can cause malabsoption of vitamin B12, and subsequent macrocytic anemia. The {{most common cause of}} Vitamin B12 deficiency is deficiency of the intrinsic factor (IF) usually due to atrophic gastritis, which reduces the number of parietal cells secreting intrinsic factor. This can lead to pernicious anemia. However, a rare abnormality of AMN can also cause vitamin B12 anemia; this condition is referred to as [...] "Imerslund-Gräsbeck syndrome (IGS)." [...] Autosomal recessive mutations in both component of Cubam (AMN, and cubilin) is responsible for Imerslund-Gräsbeck syndrome, which manifests as macrocytic, megaloblastic anemia.|$|E
50|$|Vagotomy {{was once}} popular {{as a way}} of {{treating}} and preventing PUD and subsequent ulcer perforations. PUD was thought to be due to excess secretion of the acid environment in the stomach, or at least that PUD was made worse by hyperacidity. Vagotomy was a way to reduce the acidity of the stomach, by denervating the parietal cells that produce acid. This was done with the hope that it would treat or prevent peptic ulcers. It also had the effect of reducing or eliminating symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux in those who suffered from it. The incidence of vagotomy decreased following the discovery by Barry Marshall and Robin Warren that H. pylori is responsible for most peptic ulcers, because H. pylori can be treated much less invasively. One potential side effect of vagotomy is a vitamin B12 deficiency. As vagotomy decreases <b>gastric</b> secretion, <b>intrinsic</b> <b>factor</b> production can be impaired. <b>Intrinsic</b> <b>factor</b> is needed to absorb vitamin B12 efficiently from food, and injections or large oral doses of the vitamin may be required after such a procedure in certain populations.|$|R

40|$|Many {{investigators}} consider {{pernicious anemia}} an autoimmune disease.

Although a cause-effect relation between these immune abnormalities and the disease process is unproved, current evidence suggests that cell-mediated immune mechanisms may be responsible for the atrophic gastritis in pernicious anemia. Like several other presumed autoimmune disorders, this disease occurs with increased frequency in immunodeficiency states; this association raises the possibility that autoimmunity may be the consequence of a deficient rather than a heightened immune response. Thus, pernicious anemia appears to represent an excellent model to study the interrelations between autoimmune disease...|$|R

In contrast, four of seven patients with pernicious anaemia showed improvement in absorption of vitamin B 12 during prednisolone administration for periods of two to 10 months. No consistent changes in gastric mucosal morphology were noted. An additional five patients were studied intensively during one month of prednisolone administration. In three, absorption of vitamin B 12 was restored to within the normal range between eight and 13 days after the commencement of the drug.

40|$|Cobalamin {{deficiency}} {{is commonly}} observed in olderpeople, {{with an estimated}} prevalence of nearly 40 %. 1 Oral cyanocobalamin can be a pharmacotherapeutic option {{for the treatment of}} cobalamin (vitamin B 12) – deficient anemia of various etiologies, although it is underused. This is most likely a result of the 1959 US Pharmacopeia Anti-Anemia Preparations Advisory Board, which cautioned against the use of oral therapy for pernicious anemia be-cause of its unpredictable efficacy. 2 Historically, oral cyanocobalamin therapy was perceived as inadequate due to reported low serum cobalamin concentrations in patients taking 100 – 250 µg/d. 3 Over the course of many years, var-ious published studies 4 - 9 have shown that this is not always the case. This article reviews the data supporting the use of oral cyanocobalamin for the treatment of all forms of vita-min B 12 -deficient anemia. Pathophysiology Cobalamin is an important cofactor for synthase and mutase enzymes maintaining methylation reactions in the brain. 10 Its deficiency can result in failure of myelin syn-thesis and other neurotoxic processes. Cobalamin deficien-cy classically presents as macrocytic megaloblastic ane-mia. 11 Patients may have a smooth and beefy red tongue from atrophic glossitis and possible neurologic complica-tions. Frequently, neurologic signs and symptoms precede hematologic abnormalities and include peripheral neuropa-thy, ataxia, imbalance, upper motor neuronal signs, behav-ioral abnormalities, and dementia. A patient presenting with these neurologic manifestations may already have ir-reversible damage to the spinal cord and cerebrum. 12, 13 The consequences range from mild paresthesias and numbness to memory loss and frank psychosis. The daily cobalamin requirement is 2. 4 µg/d. 14 Absorp-tion depends on <b>intrinsic</b> <b>factor,</b> which is secreted by the <b>gastric</b> mucosa. <b>Intrinsic</b> <b>factor</b> then binds cobalamin...|$|R
40|$|Vitamin B 12 (cobalamin) is an {{essential}} coenzyme for nucleic acid synthesis. Animal protein is the major dietary source of vitamin B 12. Deficiency of vitamin B 12 leads to megaloblastic anemia, degeneration of the brain, spinal cord, peripheral nerves, and abnormalities of epithelial tissues. Two factors are necessary for the cure of megaloblastic anemia: one in food (extrinsic factor) and one in <b>gastric</b> juice (<b>intrinsic</b> <b>factor).</b> The extrinsic factor is vitamin B 12. <b>Intrinsic</b> <b>factor</b> (a glycoprotein secreted by gastric parietal cells) ensures cobalamin absorption by receptors in the terminal ileum. Vitamin B 12 is actively transported across the placenta. Neonates have high serum levels and significant liver stores of vitamin B 12. The neonates born to mothers with deficiency of vitamin B 12 have deficiency of this vitamin. Pregnant women in resource-poor areas have low vitamin B 12 status which is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes, including anemia, low birth weight, and intrauterine growth retardation. Supplementation of vitamin B 12 had significantly higher plasma of vitamin B 12 in mothers and neonates. A single intramuscularly injection of vitamin B 12 of between 250 µg and 1 mg and a dietary intake of 1 µg/kg per day vitamin B 12 is sufficient to combat vitamin B 12 deficiency. Mean DNA damage scores in infants with vitamin B 12 deficiency and their mothers were significantly higher before than after supplementation with vitamin B 12.

40|$|The {{effect of}} partial pancreatectomy (80 - 90 %) on vitamin B 12 {{absorption}} was {{studied in the}} rat. The absorption of 5 ng of 57 Co-labeled vitamin B 12 was significantly reduced from 70 ± 2. 5 % (mean ±SE) in control and sham-operated rats to 32 ± 2. 6 % in partially pancreatectomized rats. Hog pancreatic extract (0. 17 g/kg) improved vitamin B 12 absorption from 30. 0 to 61. 0 % in partially pancreatectomized rats but did not alter vitamin B 12 absorption in control rats. Chloramphenicol did not enhance vitamin B 12 absorption in partially pancreatectomized rats with pancreatic extract-improved vitamin B 12 malabsorption. The partially pancreatectomized rats with pancreatic extract-improved vitamin B 12 malabsorption were sacrificed and the stomach and small bowel studied in vitro to further define the pathogenesis of the vitamin B 12 malabsorption. Rat <b>gastric</b> <b>intrinsic</b> <b>factor</b> stimulated vitamin B 12 uptake by intestinal sacs prepared from partially pancreatectomized rats 3. 1 -fold. <b>Gastric</b> <b>intrinsic</b> <b>factor</b> prepared from partially pancreatectomized rats was as effective in promoting vitamin B 12 uptake by rat intestinal sacs as intrinsic factor prepared from control rats. These data indicate that partially pancreatectomized rats develop an abnormality in the absorption of labeled vitamin B 12 which can be corrected by pancreatic extract. The vitamin B 12 malabsorption is due to neither an alteration in <b>gastric</b> <b>intrinsic</b> <b>factor</b> activity nor an impairment of the intrinsic factor-vitamin B 12 receptor in the intestine.

40|$|Metabolic {{deficiency}} of vitamin B 12 is much commoner than most physicians suppose, because laboratory reports giving the “normal ” range commonly provide a range that includes many patients with metabolic B 12 deficiency (eg 160 - 600 pmol/L). Absorption of vitamin B 12 is very complex: {{it requires a}} salivary <b>factor</b> (haptocorrin), <b>gastric</b> acid, <b>intrinsic</b> <b>factor,</b> pancreatic third factor, an intact ileal mucosa, and transport proteins including transcobalamin I and II. Thus {{there are many ways}} for B 12 absorption to become defective. Above age 65, 20 % of the population have metabolic B 12 deficiency(1), which can be defined by a serum B 12 14 µmol/L) (2). In our patients with vascular disease, metabolic B 12 deficiency was present in 11 % of patients age 71 (3). With folate supplementation of the grain supply, only 1. 7 % of the population are deficient in folate(4), and In folate-replete subjects, the key factor determining plasma tHcy is B 12 (3). Since folate fortification of the grain supply in North America, we showed that serum B 12 is directly related with plasma total homocysteine, and patients with lower B 12 levels have significantly more carotid plaque than those with higher levels of serum B 12 (3). Although folate supplementation has not been shown {{to reduce the risk of}} myocardial infarction, a meta-analysis showed a significant reduction of stroke(5). In elderly patients with serum B 12 in the lowest quartile, 1000 mcg per day of oral B 12 is needed to achieve adequate absorption (2).

40|$|Pernicious anemia, a {{clinical}} state of vitamin B 12 deficiency, {{is characterized by}} a virtually complete absence of <b>gastric</b> <b>intrinsic</b> <b>factor</b> secretion, result-ing in marked inability of the patient to absorb the low concentrations of vitamin B 12 present in usual dietary sources. Intrinsic factor deficiency is also produced by total gastrectomy in the rat and, as in the patient, can be temporarily abolished by the oral administration of intrinsic factor. A number of facts concerning the nature and function of in-trinsic factor have been discovered by observations on patients (1 - 2) and, recently, on gastrectomized rats (3 - 5). Intrinsic factor preparations of various species-man, hog, rat and dog-are capable of binding vitamin B 12 (6 - 9) as are other substances such as food proteins which, however, lack intrinsic factor activity (10, 11). Vitamin B 12 bound by intrinsic factor is preferentially absorbed over unbound vitamin when both are simultaneously administered in pernicious anemia (12) {{as well as in the}} intes-tine of the gastrectomized rat (13). These facts suggest that normally the first task of the <b>gastric</b> <b>intrinsic</b> <b>factor</b> may be to compete for the vitamin B 12 of ingested animal protein with which the vi-tamin is associated or bound. For convenience in reporting the present experiments, we shall refer to this competition as Phase I of the hypothetical action of intrinsic factor. That vitamin B 12 bound to intrinsic factor is preferentially absorbed also suggests that the vitamin must approach, adhere to, and perhaps even penetrate the intestinal wall in combination with intrinsic factor.
