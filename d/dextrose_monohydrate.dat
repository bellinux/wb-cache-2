Such cases are registered under Section 420 IPC (Indian Penal Code) r/w 63 copyright act. Authors have successfully carried out the identification and quantitation {{of the contents of}} spurious health drinks in actual cases received in the laboratory. The questioned samples were thoroughly analysed by chemical and instrumental methods 1, 2 such as solubility, pH, presumptive colour tests, and identification of <b>dextrose</b> <b>monohydrate,</b> citric acid, cations and anions (calcium, chloride, phosphate and sulphate), and percentage purity 1 of <b>dextrose</b> <b>monohydrate</b> by digital polarimeter. The results were compared with the results obtained with standard reference materials (SRMs) and pure dextrose standard EXCELAR grade as well as genuine samples.

40|$|A reverse-phase {{high-performance}} liquid chromatographic (HPLC) {{method for}} {{recovery of the}} lipophilic drug, alprazolam, from matrix tablets containing the hydrophilic polymer hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) was developed. Lipophilic drugs, such as alprazolam, are difficult to completely extract and quantitate from tablets containing HPMC polymer. The percentage of recoveries of alprazolam from placebo powder spiked with alprazolam stock solution and from placebo powder mixed with alprazolam powder were about 100 % and 85 % to 95 %, respectively. The validated method using water to completely dissolve HPMC before {{the addition of a}} strong solvent to dissolve and extract the drug from the HPMC solution was shown to be the most reproducible method. Different molecular weight distributions of the HPMC polymer, such as HPMC-K 4 M and HPMC-K 100 LV, did not influence the dissolution results of alprazolam using this validated method. Similarly, the excipients composing the matrix tablet formulations, such as dicalcium phosphate dihydrate, dicalcium phosphate anhydrous, calcium sulfate dihydrate, sucrose, <b>dextrose,</b> and lactose <b>monohydrate,</b> did not influence the percent recovery of alprazolam. The recovery method reported herein was shown to be the most efficient to achieve complete recovery of alprazolam from powder blends and tablets containing a variety of excipients and different grades of HPMC...|$|R

40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} evaluate the effects of various dextrose, lactose, and whey sources on weanling pig performance. In Exp. 1, a total of 228 pigs (initially 17. 1 lb) were used in a 14 -d experiment. There were six treatments consisting of a control (corn-soybean meal diet) or the control diet with 7. 2 % lactose, 7. 2 % dextrose anhydrous, 7. 2 % <b>dextrose</b> <b>monohydrate,</b> 10 % feed-grade whey, or 10 % food-grade whey. Pigs were blocked by weight and randomly allotted to treatment after being fed SEW and Transition diets for the first seven days post-weaning. Overall, ADG and d 14 weight were improved (P< 0. 05) for pigs fed lactose or food-grade whey when compared to pigs fed feed-grade whey. There were no other differences in ADG or d 14 weights among the treatments. Average daily feed intake was improved (P< 0. 05) for pigs fed lactose, <b>dextrose</b> <b>monohydrate,</b> or food-grade whey when compared to those fed feed-grade whey. Feed efficiency was improved (P< 0. 05) for pigs fed food-grade whey rather than <b>dextrose</b> <b>monohydrate.</b> For the economic analysis, pigs fed the control diet had the lowest (P< 0. 01) cost per pound of gain, followed by pigs fed <b>dextrose</b> <b>monohydrate,</b> dextrose anhydrous, feed-grade whey, lactose, and food-grade whey. Margin-over-feed cost was improved (P< 0. 05) for pigs fed the control diet rather than the diets containing lactose, dextrose anhydrous, or either whey source. In Exp. 2, a total of 352 pigs (initially 17. 1 lb) were used in a 14 -d experiment to evaluate seven commercial whey sources. There were eight treatments consisting of a corn-soybean meal-based control diet and seven diets containing 10 % whey, each of a different whey source. Pigs were blocked by weight and randomly allotted to treatment after being fed SEW and Transition diets {{for the first five}} days post-weaning. Overall, ADG and d 14 weight were improved (P< 0. 05) for pigs fed whey sources A and E when compared to the control and sources B and D. Pigs fed whey sources C, F, and G had intermediate ADG. Average daily feed intake was greater (P< 0. 05) for pigs fed whey source E rather than the control or whey sources B, C, D, and G. Feed efficiency was improved (P< 0. 05) for pigs fed whey source A rather than the control. Pigs fed the remaining whey sources had intermediate F/G. For the economic analysis, pigs fed the control diet had the lowest cost per pound of gain (P< 0. 01). Margin-over-feed cost was improved (P< 0. 05) for pigs fed the control diet rather than the diets containing whey sources B, D, and G. Pigs fed whey source A had intermediate MOF that was also greater (P< 0. 05) than that of pigs fed whey sources B and D. In conclusion, differences in the growth performance of pigs fed various whey (or lactose) and dextrose sources exist. The quality, cost, and relative feeding value of lactose sources should be considered when formulating diets for nursery pigs. In some cases, especially with the current high price of dried whey, feeding a Phase 2 diet containing no added source of lactose may be a more economical option despite the slight reduction in growth performance...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{modelling}} of a continuous cooling column crystallizer. An accurate model of this system is needed for complex process control. The investigated system consists on <b>dextrose</b> <b>monohydrate</b> in aqueous solution. An adaptive hybrid model is presented. The model consists of two parts: the phenomenological model, expressed {{by a set of}} differential algebraic equations, and a neural network, based on historical data, developed by the fuzzy ARMAP technique. The empirical part of the hybrid model is aimed at eliminating the deviations of the prediction of the phenomenological model caused mainly by incrustations over the surface of the cooling coils located along the column crystallizer. The model is adaptive since neural network parameters are updated by a self-learning system (SLS) based on the acquired process data storage of the DCS of an industrial plant. Firstly, the hybrid model was implemented by using the data of a three-month campaign of the crystallizer, then the self-learning technique was checked on site in a subsequent campaign. © 2010 The Institution of Chemical Engineers...|$|E

40|$|Generally, {{to reduce}} calorie {{content of a}} food, fat and sugar are reduced or removed and, subsequently, {{replaced}} with other components. Calorie can also ideally reduced in a food, through the incorporation of {{a certain amount of}} air, to obtain a product with the same volume but with a different weight and consequently a reduced calorie content. Considering that lipids and sugar play many roles in food, the reduction or substitution of these ingredients may affect both sensory and physical properties of modified foods. The aim of the thesis was the calorie reduction in food. The research have been focused on: the characterization of a new sweet protein, as alternative to sugar, particularly, for beverage industry application; the optimization of a fat replacer system for fat based fillings. The first study case focused on the sensory characterization of MNEI, obtained by recombinant expression in cells of E. coli with high yields. Since MNEI is an High Intensity Sweeteners (HIS) it could be used in the beverage industry meeting the consumer needs about the low calorie content and the sweetness of beverage. Thus, the specific objectives of this study were, first, the determination of taste detection (DT) and recognition threshold (RT) of MNEI in different conditions typical of beverage processing and of beverage consumption, concerning mineral content, serving temperature of the product, pH and thermal treatment, and then to compare dynamic sensory performance of MNEI, with that of aspartame, saccharin and sucrose. A selected panel evaluated DT and RT of MNEI by using a modified version of difference from Reference method. Through the modified method, assessors were also asked to give a qualitative information about the perceived taste, thus it was also possible to obtain the RT of MNEI. Then, equi-sweet concentrations of different sweeteners were found through difference from Reference method, by using a selected panel. Next sweeteners, at those concentrations, were analysed thought time-Intensity (t-I) and Temporal Dominance of Sensation (TDS), to determinate sweetness evolution over time and the interaction between sweetness and other stimuli, respectively, by using a trained panel. The results demonstrated that MNEI DT and RT were much lower than those of sucrose. Besides, both mineral content and serving temperature affected MNEI DT, whereas pH and thermal treatment did not affect perceived sweetness. The modified version of difference from Reference method was useful for RT determination. Equi-sweetness values of MNEI and of three market sweeteners were determined. Time-Intensity results showed that MNEI differed from sucrose, meanwhile TDS results showed that, in presence of other stimuli, these differences were reduced. The dominant attributes of model beverages were the same for all sweeteners. In the other study case the effect of different sugar and milk proteins on some properties of a fat-based filling cream were investigated by using a three-component (icing sugar, <b>dextrose</b> <b>monohydrate,</b> skimmed milk powder) D-optimal mixture design. The best formulation was used as reference and powders percentage were considered the constant ingredients. In order to reduce calorie content, a D-optimal mixture design with five component (water, margarine, simplesse, microcrystalline cellulose and maltodextrin) was used, 25 formulations resulted. As response variables, aw, density, colour parameters and mechanical parameters were evaluated. The best formulation was chosen through the desirability function to determine areas of overlap where all responses were simultaneously optimized. To validate the model, formulations in the optimized region were prepared and submitted to a paired t –test (p ≤ 0. 05). Quadratic models were used to explain almost all parameters considered, except for aw, highlighting that the components interacted with each other and determined effect on some physical parameters. The optimized formulation had 3. 5 kcal/g,so, considering that the full fat formulation had 5. 1 kcal/g, it was possible to develop filling cream reducing the caloric content at least of 30 %...|$|E
