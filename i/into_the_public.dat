5|$|Because Corman did {{not believe}} that The Little Shop of Horrors had much {{financial}} prospect after its initial theatrical run, he did not bother to copyright it, resulting in the film falling <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> domain. Because of this, the film is widely available in copies of varying quality. The film was originally screened theatrically in the widescreen aspect ratio of 1.85:1, but has largely only been seen in open matte at an aspect ratio of 1.33:1 since its original theatrical release.|$|E

5|$|After meeting Fannie Lou Hamer in {{the summer}} of 1964 and hearing her {{experiences}} in the civil rights movement, Blackwell decided to join the SNCC. As a project director for the SNCC, she organized voter registration drives across Mississippi. Later that year, she became a member on the executive committee of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP), which provided a party for voters that SNCC had been registering to vote. In late August she and 67 other activists left Mississippi to represent the MFDP at the 1964 Democratic National Convention in Atlantic City, New Jersey, in an attempt to get the MFDP seated as delegates. They were unsuccessful in getting seats, but the move brought the party and the Mississippi civil rights movement <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> eye.|$|E

He conducted an unusual campaign for the Democratic nomination in 1972 for Vice President of the United States, and then {{played a crucial role}} in getting Congressional approval for the Trans-Alaska pipeline in 1973. He was re-elected to the Senate in 1974, but gradually alienated most of his Alaskan constituencies and his bid for a third term was defeated in a primary election in 1980.|$|E
5|$|Between 1945 and 1955, {{the number}} of day schools run by Indian Affairs {{expanded}} from 9,532 to 17,947. The growth in day schools was accompanied by {{an amendment to the}} Indian Act in 1951 that allowed federal officials to establish agreements with provincial and territorial governments and school boards regarding the education of Indigenous students in the public school system. These changes were indicative of the government's shift in policy from assimilation-driven education at residential schools to the integration of Indigenous students into public schools. It was believed that Indigenous children would receive a better education {{as a result of their}} transition <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> school system.|$|E

5|$|In the 1970s {{four of the}} Universal-produced films fell <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> domain {{when their}} {{copyright}} was not renewed. These four films were restored and colourised. Some of the films in the series had become degraded over time, {{with some of the}} original negatives lost and others suffering from nitrate deterioration because of the unstable cellulose nitrate film. The UCLA Film and Television Archive restored the series, putting the films onto modern polyester film, in a process that was jointly paid for by UCLA, Warner Bros. and Hugh Hefner.|$|E
5|$|One {{day after}} the report was released, Metropolitan Herman {{resigned}} from his position as Metropolitan. That November, the OCA elected a new Primate at its 15th Annual All-American Council. Metropolitan Jonah (Paffhausen) was chosen because he had recently been appointed as a bishop (only 11 days prior) and was viewed to not be involved with the previous financial scandal. Metropolitan Jonah immediately took a strong stance against the previous scandal and became a very public metropolitan, seeking to repair damage done by the previous scandal and bring the OCA <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> realm. Metropolitan Jonah also sought to improve relations with non-Orthodox groups and especially sought to repair {{the relations between the}} OCA and traditional Anglican groups. He was invited twice to speak at the conference of the Anglican Church of North America, in 2009 and 2012.|$|E
5|$|Raucher's novelization of his {{screenplay}} of {{the same}} name was released prior to the film's release and became a runaway bestseller, to the point that audiences lost {{sight of the fact that}} the book was based on the film and not vice versa. Though a pop culture phenomenon in the first half of the 1970s, the novelization went out of print and slipped into obscurity throughout the next two decades until a Broadway adaptation in 2001 brought it back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> light and prompted Barnes & Noble to acquire the publishing rights to the book.|$|E

In the magazine, Taylor credited his hobby of golf with helping him get over his previous hard-partying ways and drug filled lifestyle. He co-founded eXfuze, a network marketing company based in West Palm Beach, Florida. Along with former NFL players, such as Eric Dickerson and Seth Joyner, he was a spokesman for Seven+, the flagship multi-botanical drink produced by the company. His son Brandon signed a national letter to play with the Purdue Boilermakers. Taylor was a contestant on the 8th season of Dancing with the Stars, partnered with Edyta Śliwińska. He was eliminated in the seventh week on the April 21, 2009 show.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} 10 years the Stationers {{repeatedly}} advocated bills to re-authorize the old licensing system, but Parliament declined to enact them. Faced with this failure, the Stationers decided to emphasise {{the benefits of}} licensing to authors rather than publishers, and the Stationers succeeded in getting Parliament to consider a new bill. This bill, which after substantial amendments was granted Royal Assent on 5 April 1710, {{became known as the}} Statute of Anne due to its passage during the reign of Queen Anne. The new law prescribed a copyright term of 14 years, with a provision for renewal for a similar term, during which only the author and the printers they chose to license their works to could publish the author's creations. Following this, the work's copyright would expire, with the material falling <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> domain. Despite a period of instability known as the Battle of the Booksellers when the initial copyright terms under the Statute began to expire, the Statute of Anne remained in force until the Copyright Act 1842 replaced it.|$|E

5|$|The {{episodes of}} Flywheel, Shyster, and Flywheel were recorded, {{but for many}} years it was thought the {{recordings}} had not been preserved. At {{the time of the}} broadcasts, pre-recorded shows were frowned upon by advertisers and audiences. However, in 1988, Michael Barson, who worked in the United States Copyright Office at the Library of Congress discovered that the scripts for twenty-five of the twenty-six episodes had been submitted to the Office, where they had been placed in storage. Nobody was aware that they still existed and their copyrights had not been renewed. This meant that Flywheel, Shyster, and Flywheel had fallen <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> domain. The scripts were published that same year by Pantheon in a book titled Flywheel, Shyster, and Flywheel: The Marx Brothers' Lost Radio Show, edited by Michael Barson and with an interview with Perrin. In October 1988, Flywheel, Shyster and Flywheel scenes were broadcast {{for the first time since}} the show went off the air in 1933 when National Public Radio, a non-profit media organization that provides content to public radio stations around the United States, aired an 18-minute recreation of Flywheel, Shyster and Flywheel in markets such as Chicago, Illinois, Dallas, Texas, and Los Angeles, California, using Washington, D.C.-based Arena Stage actors to perform the Chico and Groucho lead roles from the published scripts. Years later, three recordings of Flywheel, Shyster, and Flywheel were found, including a five-minute excerpt of Episode 24 and a fifteen-minute recording of Episode 25. A complete recording of Episode 26 exists and was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in 2005.|$|E
