25|$|Originally an {{employee}} with the Cadbury confectionery firm in Birmingham, {{he was first}} engaged by Warwickshire as a professional in 1904 but played only irregularly for over half a decade owing {{to the presence of}} Lilley behind the stumps. When, after losing his Test place Lilley decided to concentrate on batting, Tiger Smith took his opportunity remarkably well, and developed a remarkable understanding with Frank Foster in his first full season in 1910. The following year Warwickshire achieved an astonishing triumph in the County Championship even though the abnormally dry and hot weather made it an utter fluke based around the pace bowling of Foster and Frank Field. Smith kept wicket superbly – standing up to Foster even though he could <b>get</b> <b>great</b> pace off the extremely fast pitches – and made a remarkable advance in batting. He had not scored one half century before 1911 but advanced to over 800 runs with a century against Surrey at Edgbaston.|$|E
