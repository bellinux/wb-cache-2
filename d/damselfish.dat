5|$|There {{are several}} {{different}} mating systems among teleosts. Some species are promiscuous, where {{both males and}} females breed with multiple partners and there are no obvious mate choices. This has been recorded in Baltic herring, guppies, Nassau groupers, humbug <b>damselfish,</b> cichlids and creole wrasses. Polygamy, where one sex has multiple partners can come in many forms. Polyandry consists of one adult female breeding with multiple males, which only breed with that female. This is rare among teleosts, and fish in general, but is found in the clownfish. In addition, it may also exist to an extent among anglerfish, where some females have more than one male attached to them. Polygyny, where one male breeds with multiple females, is much more common. This is recorded in sculpins, sunfish, darters, <b>damselfish</b> and cichlids where multiple females may visit a territorial male that guards and takes care of eggs and young. Polygyny may also involve a male guarding a harem of several females. This occurs in coral reef species, such as damselfishes, wrasses, parrotfishes, surgeonfishes, triggerfishes and tilefishes.|$|E
5|$|At the {{juvenile}} stage, a teleost {{looks more like}} its adult form. At this stage, its axial skeleton, internal organs, scales, pigmentation and fins are fully developed. The transition from larvae to juvenile can be short and fairly simple, lasting minutes or hours as in some <b>damselfish,</b> while in other species, like salmon, squirrelfish, gobies and flatfishes, the transition is more complex and takes several weeks to complete. At the adult stage, a teleost is able to produce viable gametes for reproduction. Like many fish, teleosts continue to grow throughout their lives. Longevity depends on the species with some gamefish like European perch and largemouth bass living up to 25 years. Rockfish {{appear to be the}} longest living teleosts with some species living over 100 years.|$|E
5|$|In Batesian mimicry, a palatable, {{harmless}} prey species {{mimics the}} appearance of another species that is noxious to predators, thus reducing the mimic's risk of attack. This form of mimicry is seen in many insects. The idea behind Batesian mimicry is that predators that have tried to eat the unpalatable species learn to associate its colors and markings with an unpleasant taste. This results in the predator learning to avoid species displaying similar colors and markings, including Batesian mimics. Some species of octopus can mimic a selection of other animals by changing their skin color, skin pattern and body motion. When a <b>damselfish</b> attacks an octopus, the octopus mimics a banded sea-snake. The model chosen varies with the octopus's predator and habitat. Most of these octopuses use Batesian mimicry, selecting an organism repulsive to predators as a model.|$|E

25|$|Most of Australia's {{fish species}} are marine, and 75% live in {{tropical}} marine environments. This is {{partly due to}} Australia's huge marine territory, covering 9 million km2. Groups of interest include the moray eels and squirrelfish, as well as the pipefish and seahorses, whose males incubate their partner's eggs in a specialised pouch. There are 80 species of grouper in Australian waters, including one of the world's biggest bony fish, the giant grouper, which can grow as large as 2.7m and weigh up to 400kg. The trevally, a group of 50 species of silver schooling fish, and the snappers are popular species for commercial fishing. The Great Barrier Reef supports a huge variety of small- and medium-sized reef fish, including the <b>damselfish,</b> butterflyfish, angelfish, gobies, cardinalfish, wrassees, triggerfish and surgeonfish. There are several venomous fish, among them several species of stonefish and pufferfish and the red lionfish, all of which have toxins that can kill humans. There are 11 venomous species of stingray, the largest of which is the smooth stingray. The barracudas are one of the reef's largest species.

40|$|Coral reef fishes {{represent}} one of {{the most}} outstandingly diverse assemblages of vertebrates on the planet but our understanding of their mode of diversification remains limited. Here we test whether the <b>damselfishes</b> (Pomacentridae), {{one of the}} most species-rich families of reef-associated fishes, adaptively radiated during their evolutionary history. Tests of the tempo of lineage diversification using a time-calibrated phylogeny including 208 species did not support the expected pattern of rapid inital diversification that slowed through time as predicted by macroevolutionary theory. Evolutionary modeling of trophic traits similarly rejected the hypothesis of early among-lineage partitioning of ecologically relevant phenotypic diversity. Instead, <b>damselfishes</b> are shown to have experienced iterative convergent radiations wherein subclades converge on similar trophic strategies (i. e. pelagic feeders, benthic feeders, intermediate) and morphologies. We discuss that regionalization of coral reefs, bipartite life cycle of reef fishes, competition and functional constraints are good candidate of causal factors underlying the iterative ecological radiation and convergent evolution of <b>damselfishes.</b> Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|While it is {{generally}} assumed that specialist species are more vulnerable to disturbance compared with generalist counterparts, this has rarely been tested in coastal marine ecosystems, which are increasingly subject {{to a wide range}} of natural and anthropogenic disturbances. Habitat specialists are expected to be more vulnerable to habitat loss because habitat availability exerts a greater limitation on population size, but it is also possible that specialist species may escape effects of disturbance if they use habitats that are generally resilient to disturbance. This study quantified specificity in use of different coral species by six coral-dwelling <b>damselfishes</b> (Chromis viridis, C. atripectoralis, Dascyllus aruanus, D. reticulatus, Pomacentrus moluccensis, and P. amboinensis) and related habitat specialization to proportional declines in their abundance following habitat degradation caused by outbreaks of the coral eating starfish, Acanthaster planci. The coral species preferred by most coral-dwelling <b>damselfishes</b> (e. g., Pocillopora damicornis) were frequently consumed by coral eating crown-of-thorns starfish, such that highly specialized <b>damselfishes</b> were disproportionately affected by coral depletion, despite using a narrower range of different coral species. Vulnerability of <b>damselfishes</b> to this disturbance was strongly correlated with both their reliance on corals and their degree of habitat specialization. Ongoing disturbances to coral reef ecosystems are expected, therefore, to lead to fundamental shifts in the community structure of fish communities where generalists are favored over highly specialist species...|$|R

40|$|Bipartite {{life cycle}} of coral reef fishes {{promotes}} increasing shape disparity of the head skeleton during ontogeny: an example from <b>damselfishes</b> (Pomacentridae) Bruno Frédérich * and Pierre Vandewalle Background: Quantitative studies of the variation of disparity during ontogeny exhibited by the radiation of coral reef fishes are lacking. Such studies dealing with the variation of disparity, i. e. the diversity of organic form, over ontogeny could be {{a first step in}} detecting evolutionary mechanisms in these fishes. The <b>damselfishes</b> (Pomacentridae) have a bipartite life-cycle, as do the majority of demersal coral reef fishes. During their pelagic dispersion phase, all larvae feed on planktonic prey. On the other hand, juveniles and adults associated with the coral reef environment show a higher diversity of diets. Using geometric morphometrics, we study the ontogenetic dynamic of shape disparity of different head skeletal units (neurocranium, suspensorium and opercle, mandible and premaxilla) in this fish family. We expected that larvae of different species might be relatively similar in shapes. Alternatively, specialization may become notable even in the juvenile and adult phase. Results: The disparity levels increase significantly throughout ontogeny for each skeletal unit. At settlement, all larval shapes are already species-specific. <b>Damselfishes</b> show high levels of ontogenetic allometry during their postsettlement growth. The divergence of allometric patterns largely explains the changes in patterns and levels of shape disparity over ontogeny. The rate of shape change and the length of ontogenetic trajectories seem to be less variable among species. We also show that the high levels of shape disparity at the adult stage are correlated to a higher level of ecological and functional diversity in this stage. Conclusion: Diversification throughout ontogeny of <b>damselfishes</b> results from the interaction among several developmental novelties enhancing disparity. The bipartite life-cycle of <b>damselfishes</b> exemplifies a case where the variation of environmental factors, i. e. the transition from the more homogeneous oceanic environment to the coral reef offering a wide range of feeding habits, promotes increasing shape disparity of the head skeleton over the ontogeny of fishes...|$|R
40|$|The {{success of}} a taxonomic group can be {{promoted}} by a key character that allows the group to interact with its environment {{in a different way}} and to potentially occupy new niches. The Pomacentridae possess a synapomorphic trait, the cerato-mandibular (c-md) ligament, which joins the hyoid bar to the inner part of the lower jaw. It has previously been shown that this ligament is a key trait in communication in <b>damselfishes</b> because it enables them to slam the oral jaws shut causing teeth collision and sound production. This specific behavior of mouth closing could, however, also be used for other tasks, such as feeding. Many territorial <b>damselfishes</b> are referred to as farmers, due to their ability to manage algal crops on which they feed. This study hypothesizes that the c-md ligament provides an advantage for grazing filamentous algae, and should thus be considered a key trait for farming behavior. The kinematic patterns associated with sound production and biting filamentous algae or attached animal prey are all based on the same mechanism and are associated with a slam of the oral jaws. We observed that transection of the c-md ligaments makes the fish unable to perform such actions. This study shows that the c-md ligament is a key trait both for sound production and for grazing activities in <b>damselfishes.</b> The buccal jaw slam enables the fish to perform accurate strikes on small filamentous algae. This kind of bite probably {{plays a major role in}} farming activity and allows grazing <b>damselfishes</b> to occupy distinct niches, possibly increasing their competitive evolutionary success.
