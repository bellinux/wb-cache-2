40|$|A new {{methodology}} {{has been}} developed to treat resonance self-shielding in doubly heterogeneous very high temperature gas-cooled reactor systems in which the fuel compact region of a reactor lattice consists of small fuel grains dispersed in a graphite matrix. The new method first homogenizes the fuel grain and matrix materials using an analytically derived <b>disadvantage</b> <b>factor</b> from a two-region problem with equivalence theory and intermediate resonance method. The <b>disadvantage</b> <b>factor</b> accounts for spatial self-shielding effects inside each grain {{within the framework of}} an infinite array of grains. Then the homogenized fuel compact is self-shielded using a Bondarenko method to account for interactions between the fuel compact regions in the fuel lattice. In the final form of the equations for actual implementations, the double-heterogeneity effects are accounted for by simply using a modified definition of a background cross section, which includes geometry parameters and cross sections for both the grain and fuel compact regions. With the new method, the doubly heterogeneous resonance self-shielding effect can be treated easily even with legacy codes programmed only for a singly heterogeneous system by simple modifications in the background cross section for resonance integral interpolations. This paper presents a detailed derivation of the new method and a sensitivity study of double-heterogeneity parameters introduced during the derivation. The implementation of the method and verification results for various test cases are presented in the companion paperclos...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1983 Spatial flux {{profiles}} {{were calculated}} in idealized, optically-thin (1 mfp) cell systems using integral transport theory. Numerical accuracy improvement and convergence efficiency in computing these spatial flux profiles {{was the primary}} concern. Toward these ends, kernel volume-averaging techniques for curvilinear cell systems, a reflective angular-dependent edge source boundary condition for optically-thin cell systems and an iterative heuristic convergence method were developed. To the optically-thin cell systems (slab, cylindrical, and spherical), an angular-dependent edge source boundary condition (equivalent to a Double-PN (PNN) boundary condition) was applied to improve the flux profile shape and <b>disadvantage</b> <b>factor.</b> The spatial flux profile is composed of the volume-source flux profile (black-body boundary condition) plus a normalized flux from an edge source. The edge source represents a reflecting boundary by reinserting neutrons that leak from the cell under the more easily computed black-body conditions. For an optically-thick system (greater than a few mfp's), an isotropic edge flux (zero current boundary condition or P∞) is sufficient to produce an accurate flux profile. However, in an optically-thin system, the zero current boundary condition begins to break down and a "dip" in the flux profile near the cell edge and a reduced moderator flux are observed. The anisotropy of the volume-source leakage {{is assumed to be}} poorly represented by a re-entrant isotropic edge flux. In order to "correct" the flux profile, the angular moments of the volume-source leakage neutrons can be more accurately approximated by two or more edge sources of different angular emission distributions. However, complete matchup of the angular moments of the volume-source leakage neutrons to the re-entrant edge source neutrons would result in the undesireable mirror boundary condition for curvilinear systems subject to the classical "ray effect" (overestimation of the <b>disadvantage</b> <b>factor).</b> Thus, the diffuse few-moment condition (i. e. the P₁₁ or an isotropic edge flux and cosine-directed edge flux combination) that was developed seems to be an accurate and workable compromise between the inaccuracies of the simple zero-current boundary condition (P∞ and those of a "mirror reflecting" system...|$|E

5000|$|The {{topic of}} {{multiple}} jeopardy, {{relates to the}} understanding of the concept Matrix of Domination. This term, used by Patricia Hill Collins, refers to the sociological intersectional paradigms that describes the overall social organization within which oppressions that are fueled by the intersection of multiple <b>disadvantaging</b> <b>factors,</b> originate, develop, and are contained. [...] By intersectional, it is meant that the <b>disadvantaging</b> <b>factors</b> that are discussed in the explanation of multiple jeopardy, intersect and overlap with one another just as an inseparable link; an interlocking system of oppression. In the United States, domination can be seen in institutions such as schools, employment, housing, the government, and other social elements. The domination of the superior group affects those who are/have been socially oppressed due to the factors that have historically caused them disadvantages. The idea of multiple jeopardy feeds into the concept of the Matrix of Domination because it is these multiple factors, gender, race, sex, class, religion and other social/cultural identities, that have historically caused many disadvantages for certain groups of people.

The method {{is composed of}} a series of subroutines that are consolidated to produce a set of self-consistent multigroup parameters. The thermal cross sections are determined by averaging the cross section over a "hardened" or shifted Maxwellian spectrum, the amount of hardening being a function of the macroscopic absomption-to-slowing-down ratio. The <b>disadvantage</b> <b>factor</b> is calculated using diffusion theory for the moderator and a transport condition at the surface of the rod, the accuracy of the calculation being comparable to a g a shielding effects even for very close-packed lattices. The fast-fission factor is calculated relative to the experimental measurements for UO/sub 2 /. The diffusion coefficients are found by averaging the measured cross sections over the appropriate neutron flux in each neutron energy group. The slowing-down cross section is defined as the diffusion coefficient divided by the neutron age, the age being determined by calculating equivalent transport and slowing-down factors relative to light-water measurements.

The measurements {{were made in the}} M. I. T. Heavy Water Lattice Facility with source neutrons from the M. I. T. Reactor. Two lattices were studied in detail in this work. The more closely packed lattice had a triangular spacing of 1. 25 inches, and the less closely packed lattice had a triangular spacing of 2. 5 inches. The results of the experiments were compared to one-dimensional, 30 -energy group, THERMOS calculations based on the available energy exchange kernels. The comparison indicated that the approximation that the hexagonal cell may be replaced by an equivalent circular cell (the Wigner-Seitz approximation) can lead to serious discrepancies in closely packed lattices moderated b! y heavy water. A modified one-dimensional, and a two-dimensional, calculation were shown to predict the intracellular activation distribution in the closely packed lattice. An analytical treatment of the problem of the flux perturbation in a foil was developed and compared to the experimental results obtained by using gold foils of four different thicknesses in the lattice cell; the method was shown to be adequate. An analytical method to treat the effect of leakage from an exponential assembly was formulated; the results indicated that only in small exponential assemblies would leakage be a significant problem in intracellular flux measurements. A method was developed to predict the cadmium ratio of the foils used in the lattice cell; comparison with available measurements with gold foils indicated good agreement between theory and experiment, except for a lattice having very large ratios of moderator volume, to fuel volume, e. g., 100 : 1. Calculations of the fuel <b>disadvantage</b> <b>factor</b> by the method of successive generations for gold, lutetium and europium detector foils were compared to the results of THERMOS calculations, because THERMOS was shown to predict the experimental distributions.

If one considers the landscape of accounting education in South Africa, the unique challenges faced by accounting students at Unisa and the recent scholarly addresses on retention and throughput of distance education students, as well as the <b>disadvantaging</b> <b>factors</b> with which Unisa students are faced, this study contributes to the theoretical comprehension of students’ retention and {{throughput rate}}s in accounting education at postgraduate level. The focus of the current study was mainly on non-academic factors affecting the performance of accounting students at postgraduate level, since much research has already been done on academic factors that affect the performance of accounting students. Many studies are focussed on students at undergraduate level; therefore, in this study, postgraduate students studying towards becoming a chartered accountant were chosen. Financial AccountingM. A.

40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} the economic context of immigration in Luxembourg before examining {{the determinants of}} individual and cross-national unemployment, income, and occupational mobility. It finds that although being an immigrant in itself {{does not seem to}} cause substantial economic advantage or <b>disadvantage,</b> correlated <b>factors</b> such as education and the nationality of one's parents do. Cross-nationally, Luxembourg does not have an admirable record on unemployment or income for immigrants, but the foreign-born do seem to achieve relatively high levels of upward mobility. Pan-EU analysis suggests that the main source of such intergenerational mobility is Luxembourg's sustained economic growth...|$|R
40|$|In {{my thesis}} paper I have studied {{different}} factors shaping {{the housing market}} trends in Slovenia. An online-survey-based analysis of housing preferences has been performed, classifying the respondents into three categories based {{on the type of}} their household type, their head householder and the current residential status. I have also carefully considered their views of different factors influencing the resolution of residential issues, subduing them to comparison and evaluation. Furthermore, I have researched the acceptability of the tenancy and owner-occupancy statuses amongst Slovenes, as well as elaborated on their advantages and <b>disadvantages.</b> <b>Factors</b> most commonly decisive with one's residential status are: housing prices, income, permanent employment, household size, neighbourhood, accessibility of city centres as well as sufficient privacy and the feeling of safety. The majority of respondents have given more importance to non-commercial factors, however, the price often plays a crucial role in making the final decision. A great number of survey participants have voiced their ambition for estate ownership, thus considering all other forms merely temporary solutions. The key motive behind it is free and independent decision-making as well as arranging of the owned dwelling. Nonetheless, they do admit to certain advantages of tenancy and consider it a relatively equivalent substitute to ownership. The results of the study show that many households resolve their residential issue by settling in an independent or shared dwelling of either one's own or partner's parents...|$|R
