50|$|A <b>giro</b> <b>{{transfer}}</b> is a {{bank transfer}} payment, whereby order {{is given by}} the payer {{to his or her}} bank, which transfers funds into the payee's bank account; the receiving bank then notifies the payee. Giro is often used by post offices as well. The term is little used in the United States, although an ACH Transfer or direct deposit is the US electronic version of the <b>giro</b> <b>transfer.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{the postal}} giro model, the paying party sends {{a request to}} pay the payee (called a <b>giro</b> <b>transfer)</b> to the <b>giro</b> centre, which verifies that the funds are available, debits the payer's {{accounts}} by the amount requested, and credits that amount to the payee's account. The giro centre then sends the <b>giro</b> <b>transfer</b> document to the recipient, and an updated account statement to both the payer and payee. In the case of large utilities receiving thousands of payments per day, statements are sent electronically and incorporate a unique reference number for each payment for reconciliation purposes.|$|R
5000|$|A giro ( [...] , , , , or [...] ), or <b>giro</b> <b>{{transfer}},</b> is {{a payment}} transfer from one bank account to another bank account and instigated by the payer, not the payee.

50|$|In the Postal <b>Giro</b> model <b>Giro</b> <b>Transfers</b> {{are sent}} through the post by the {{remitter}} to the Giro Centre. On receipt, the transfer is checked and the account transfer takes place. If the transfer is successful, the transfer document {{is sent to}} the recipient, together with an updated statement of account being credited. The remitter is also sent an updated statement. In the case of large utilities receiving thousands of transactions per day, statements would be sent electronically and incorporate a reference number uniquely identifying the remittance for reconciliation purposes.|$|R
50|$|Ag2r {{was one of}} 22 teams which {{participated in}} the Giro d'Italia. They were not {{competitive}} {{in the beginning of}} the Giro in the Netherlands, as they did not have any riders contesting the sprint finishes to stage 2 or 3 and their highest-placed rider after three stages was Alexander Efimkin in 37th. Their fortunes did not improve upon the <b>Giro's</b> <b>transfer</b> to Italy, as they were last of the 22 teams in the stage 4 team time trial. Efimkin gave the team its first top ten in a stage when he finished near the front of the peloton, for ninth, on stage 6, which was won by a breakaway. However, this stage was also costly for the team, as their squad leader Bonnafond was forced to retire from the Giro after crashing and sustaining a gash near his right eye.|$|R
50|$|Online Banking ePayments (OBeP) {{are similar}} to <b>giro</b> <b>transfers,</b> but are {{designed}} specifically for use with online commerce. With OBeP, during the online checkout process, the merchant redirects the consumer to their financial institution’s online banking site where they login and authorize charges. After charges are authorized, the financial institution redirects the consumer back to the merchant site. With some services, like Trustly, the merchant can embed an iframe on their site so that the consumer doesn't {{have to leave the}} page to make a payment. All network communications are protected using industry standard encryption. Additionally, communications with the OBeP network take place on a virtual private network, not over the public Internet. OBeP systems protect consumer personal information by not requiring the disclosure of account numbers or other sensitive personal data to online merchants or other third parties.|$|R
50|$|In most European countries, cheques are now rarely used, {{even for}} third party payments. In these countries, it is {{standard}} practice for businesses to publish their bank details on invoices, {{to facilitate the}} receipt of payments by giro. Even before the introduction of online banking, it has been possible in some countries to make payments to third parties using ATMs, which may accurately and rapidly capture invoice amounts, due dates, and payee bank details via a bar code reader to reduce keying. In some countries, entering the bank account number results in the bank revealing {{the name of the}} payee as an added safeguard against fraud. In using a cheque, the onus is on the payee to initiate the payment, whereas with a <b>giro</b> <b>transfer,</b> the onus is on the payer to effect the payment (The writer of a paper cheque is pushing on a rope: he cannot force money out of his own account and into the destination's account. By writing the paper cheque, he is handing {{the far end of the}} rope to the payee, who will pull in his own good time. In contrast, giro is more akin to wire transfer, in that the payer pushes his money away towards the payee). The process is also procedurally more simple, as no cheques are ever posted, can claim to have been posted, or need banking or clearance.|$|R
40|$|Interbank GIRO (IBG) is {{the only}} <b>GIRO</b> <b>transfer</b> in Malaysia {{provided}} by Malaysian Electronic Payment Sdn. Bhd. (MEPS). It is an interbank fund transfer system designed to handle a high volume of low-value payment transmitted from the originating bank to another banks (receiving banks). Currently, IBG is adopting batch processing where the electronic fund transfer can either be executed by job scheduler or manual human intervention. Almost everyday, there is delay from originating banks in submitting the IBG files to MEPS. At MEPS, the extension of time will result in non-efficient services and incur loss to the organization. This in-efficiency service, thus impact the MEPS distribution processes to receiving banks as per MEPS‘s Service Level Agreement (SLA). Since the inefficiency caused by the originating bank, the alternative is for MEPS to reduce the processing time by streamlining and automating the processes at MEPS. This study identifies the effectiveness of Business Process Management (BPM) concept to solve the problem. Previous researches conducted have shown that it can solve some of the important key in monitoring, automating and improving {{the efficiency of the}} business process. A newly business process for IBG was developed {{to reduce the number of}} process, reduce number of resources, lower the risks of delay in submitting the IBG files to receiving banks and reduce the time for the whole IBG processing. To have a standard BPM implementation, a BPM framework is proposed to be applied by MEPS for IBG business processes. With this, it can cater continuous changes in IBG business process in future and achieve the organizational mission and vision...|$|R
50|$|In Germany, Austria, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Scandinavia, cheques {{have almost}} {{completely}} vanished {{in favour of}} direct bank transfers and electronic payments. Direct bank <b>transfers,</b> using so-called <b>giro</b> <b>transfers,</b> have been standard procedure since the 1950s to send and receive regular payments like rent and wages and even mail-order invoices. In the Netherlands, Austria, and Germany, all kinds of invoices are commonly accompanied by so-called acceptgiros (Netherlands) or Überweisungen (German), which are essentially standardized bank transfer order forms preprinted with the payee's account details and the amount payable. The payer fills in his account details and hands the form to a clerk at his bank, which will then transfer the money. It is also very common to allow the payee to automatically withdraw the requested amount from the payer's account (Lastschrifteinzug (German) or Incasso (machtiging) (Netherlands)). Though similar to paying by cheque, the payee only needs the payer's bank and account number. Since the early 1990s, this method of payment has also been available to merchants. Due to this, credit cards are rather uncommon in Germany, Austria and the Netherlands, and are mostly used to give access to credit {{rather than as a}} payment mechanism. However, debit cards are widespread in these countries, since virtually all Austrian, German and Dutch banks issue debit cards instead of simple ATM cards for use on current accounts. Acceptance of cheques has been further diminished since the late 1990s, because of the abolition of the Eurocheque. Cashing a foreign bank cheque is possible, but usually very expensive.|$|R

50|$|Telegram boys {{became popular}} after the Post Office took {{over control of}} inland {{telegraphs}} from the railways and private telegraph companies. Many of the boys employed by these services to deliver <b>telegrams</b> <b>transferred</b> to the Post Office.

They were expected to behave in a manner befitting one who wore the uniform of the Queen, and were required to complete a daily drill. From 1915 to 1921, morning exercise was added to these requirements.|$|R
