5|$|Higgins' song writing {{grew out}} of a desire to express her {{emotions}} when she was at school and her lyrics describe her feelings about her own life and relationships. The piano was the first instrument she learned to play, and she continues to use it as well as <b>digital</b> <b>pianos</b> including a Roland RD-300SX, RD-700 and KR-15. She also uses guitars extensively in her music particularly when touring, due to their portable nature and favours the Australian brand, Maton. On occasion she plays keytar, xylophone and melodica during performances.|$|E
25|$|Compared to <b>digital</b> <b>pianos</b> or stage pianos, digital {{keyboards}} {{are usually}} much lower in cost, {{as they have}} unweighted keys. Like <b>digital</b> <b>pianos,</b> they usually feature on-board amplifiers and loudspeakers. Stage pianos, however, typically do not have integrated amplifiers and speakers, as these instruments are normally plugged into a keyboard amplifier in a professional concert setting. Unlike synthesizers, {{the primary focus of}} home electronic keyboards is not on detailed control of sound synthesis parameters. Most home electronic keyboards offer little or no control or editing of the sounds (although a selection of 128 or more preset sounds is typically provided).|$|E

25|$|In Russia, most {{kinds of}} {{keyboards}} (including <b>digital</b> <b>pianos</b> and stage pianos) were simply {{often referred to}} as a synthesizer (Russian: синтезатор, sintezator), usually with no other term to distinguish them from actual digital synthesizers.|$|E
25|$|Digital piano - Electronic {{keyboards}} {{designed to}} sound {{and feel like}} an ordinary acoustic piano. They typically contain a amplifier and loudspeaker built into the instrument. In most cases they can fully replace acoustic pianos and provide several features, such as recording and saving files to a computer. Many <b>digital</b> <b>pianos</b> can imitate the sounds of several instruments, including a grand piano, electric piano, pipe organ, Hammond organ and harpsichord. They are not sensitive to the climate or humidity changes {{in a room and}} there is also no need for tuning, as with acoustic pianos.|$|E
25|$|MIDI terminals: Most {{keyboards}} usually incorporate MIDI {{connection for}} data communication, typically connected {{with either a}} computer or another electronic musical instrument, such as a synthesizer, a drum machine or a sound module, allowing it {{to be used as}} a MIDI controller. Not all keyboards have conventional MIDI terminals and connector, but they may have a USB instead, which serve as both input and output in a single connection. Most recently, conventional MIDI in/out terminals are only available in professional-grade keyboards, stage pianos and high-end synthesizers, while low-cost home keyboards, <b>digital</b> <b>pianos,</b> and budget synthesizers uses USB as the only connection available.|$|E

25|$|Polyphony: In {{digital music}} terminology, {{polyphony}} {{refers to the}} maximum number of notes that can be produced by the sound generator at once. Polyphony allows significantly smoother and more natural transitions between notes. Inexpensive toy electronic keyboards designed for children can usually only has five to ten notes at a time. Many low priced keyboards can perform 24 or 32 notes at a time. More advanced keyboards can perform over 48 notes at a time with 64 or 128 notes being common. <b>Digital</b> <b>pianos,</b> has more complex polyphonic system and could perform by up to 256 notes.|$|E
2500|$|Broadly speaking, in {{a popular}} music context, the term {{electronic}} keyboard or just a keyboard mostly refers to any type of digital or electronic keyboard instrument. These include synthesizers, <b>digital</b> <b>pianos,</b> stage pianos, electronic organs and digital audio workstations. However, in true musical terminology, an electronic keyboard is an inexpensive synthesizer equipped with built-in power amplifier and small loudspeakers.|$|E
2500|$|Velocity {{sensitivity}} (also {{found under}} the keyword touch sensitivity in some manuals): While {{the least expensive}} keyboards are simply [...] "on-off" [...] switches, mid-range and higher-range instruments simulate the process of sound generation in chordophones (string instruments) which {{are sensitive to the}} speed (or [...] "hardness") of a key press. Mid-range instruments may only have two or three levels of sensitivity (e.g., soft-medium-loud). More expensive models may have a broader range of sensitivity. For implementation, two sensors are installed for each key: the first sensor detects when a key is beginning to be pressed and the other triggers when the key is pressed completely. On some higher-end electronic keyboards or <b>digital</b> <b>pianos,</b> a third sensor is installed. This third sensor allows the player to strike a key and still sound a note even when the key has not yet come to its full resting position, allowing for faster (and more accurate) playing of repeated notes. The time between the two (or three) signals allows a keyboard to determine the velocity with which the key was struck. As the key weight is constant this velocity can be considered as the strength of the press. Based on this value the sound generator produces a correspondingly loud or soft sound. The least sophisticated types of touch sensitivity cause the keyboard to change the volume of the instrument voice. The most sophisticated, expensive types will trigger both a change in volume and a change in timbre, which simulates the way that very hard strikes of a piano or electric piano cause a difference in tone—as well as an increase in volume. Some sophisticated touch-sensitivity systems accomplish this by having several samples of an acoustic instrument note per key (e.g., a soft strike, a mid-level strike, and a hard strike). Alternatively, a similar effect can be accomplished using synthesis-modelling of the ADSR envelope or digital modelling (e.g., for the hard strike, the keyboard would add the timbres associated with a hard strike—in the case of a Fender Rhodes voice, this would be a biting, [...] "bark" [...] sound).|$|E

50|$|While <b>digital</b> <b>pianos</b> may {{sometimes}} {{fall short of}} a real piano in feel and sound, they nevertheless have other advantages over acoustic pianos. <b>Digital</b> <b>pianos</b> cost much less than an acoustic piano and most models are much smaller and lighter in weight than an acoustic piano. As well, <b>digital</b> <b>pianos</b> {{do not need to}} be tuned, and their tuning can be modified to match the tuning of another instrument (e.g., a pipe organ). Since <b>digital</b> <b>pianos</b> produce their sound electronically, the volume can be made louder or softer using a volume control. <b>Digital</b> <b>pianos</b> can be connected to a keyboard amplifier or PA system to produce a sound loud enough for a large venue. At the same time, most <b>digital</b> <b>pianos</b> can be played using headphones, which means that they are quiet enough for practicing in an apartment or hotel room. Some <b>digital</b> <b>pianos</b> can also emulate other sounds besides the piano, the most common ones being pipe organ, electric piano, Hammond organ and harpsichord. <b>Digital</b> <b>pianos</b> are often used in school and amateur performances to replace traditional instruments.|$|E

5000|$|In modern usage, {{the term}} {{electronic}} piano sometimes refers {{to either a}} digital piano or a stage piano.
