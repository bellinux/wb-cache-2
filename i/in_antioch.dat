5|$|Caracalla's mother Julia Domna was {{initially}} left in peace when Macrinus became emperor. This changed when Macrinus {{discovered that she}} was conspiring against him and had her placed under house arrest <b>in</b> <b>Antioch.</b> By this time Julia Domna was suffering from an advanced stage of breast cancer and soon died <b>in</b> <b>Antioch,</b> possibly by starving herself. Afterwards, Macrinus sent Domna's sister Julia Maesa and her children back to Emesa in Syria, from where Maesa set in motion her plans to have Macrinus overthrown. Macrinus remained <b>in</b> <b>Antioch</b> {{instead of going to}} Rome upon being declared emperor, a step which furthered his unpopularity in Rome and contributed to his eventual downfall.|$|E
5|$|Alice's second husband, Bohemond, {{was the son}} of Bohemond IV and {{his first}} wife, Plaisance Embriaco. He only succeeded his father <b>in</b> <b>Antioch</b> and Tripoli in 1233, after his {{marriage}} with Alice was annulled. Alice's young third husband, Ralph of Nesle, came to the Holy Land during the crusade of Theobald IV of Champagne in September 1239.|$|E
5|$|Basil II accorded Mansur the fief of Shih al-Laylun (Loulon) {{near the}} Byzantine–Arab frontier. According to {{historian}} Jean-Claude Cheynet, this fief {{could not have}} been the frontier fortress of Loulon, but rather a group of villages from which Mansur received his income during his asylum <b>in</b> <b>Antioch.</b> Mansur later built a fortress in his fief. Basil II also granted Mansur a building <b>in</b> <b>Antioch</b> itself. Mansur received a salary and he and his men served in the Byzantine army of Antioch, where he commanded a tagma (professional regiment) of 700 men. He was in the entourage of Emperor Romanos III at the Battle of Azaz in 1030, which was fought against Salih's son and successor, Shibl al-Dawla Nasr. Mansur's presence likely indicates Romanos's intention to restore Mansur to Aleppo, according to Zakkar, though the attempt ended in a decisive Byzantine defeat.|$|E

5|$|Before long, Bohemond granted Jabala (which {{was still}} to be conquered) to the Templars {{although}} Raymond-Roupen had promised the town to the Hospitallers. The papal legate, Cardinal Pelagius, brokered an agreement between the military orders, dividing the town between them. However, Bohemond remained hostile to the Hospitallers. After he confiscated their property <b>in</b> <b>Antioch,</b> Pelagius excommunicated him.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the death}} of Caracalla, Macrinus allowed Caracalla's mother, Julia Domna, and his aunt Julia Maesa, to settle in their home town of Emesa.

Her sister Julia Maesa, however, returned to Emesa with her family finances intact.|$|E

5|$|After {{finding an}} empty {{treasure}} <b>in</b> <b>Antioch,</b> Raymond-Roupen increased taxation, {{which made him}} unpopular among his subjects. He also refused to assist Leo against the Seljuqs. In 1217, Raymond-Roupen tried to capture Leo, but the Templars assisted Leo to flee to Cilicia. Bohemond visited John, King of Jerusalem, in Acre in autumn 1217. John recognized Bohemond as the lawful prince of Antioch early the next year, but did not provide him with military assistance.|$|E
5|$|At {{about the}} same time rebellions began in Roman Syria and Palaestina Prima in the wake of Heraclius' revolt. In 609 or 610 the Patriarch of Antioch, Anastasius II, died. Many sources claim that the Jews were {{involved}} in the fighting, though it is unclear where they were members of factions and where they were opponents of Christians. Phocas responded by appointing Bonus as comes Orientis (Count of the East) to stop the violence. Bonus punished the Greens, a horse racing party, <b>in</b> <b>Antioch</b> for their role in the violence in 609.|$|E

5|$|Bohemond III's {{younger son}} (Raymund-Roupen's uncle), Bohemond, Count of Tripoli, disputed the {{validity}} of their oath. He expelled his father from Antioch {{with the support of}} the Templars, the Hospitallers and the commune of the burghers in late 1198. Three months later Leo invaded the Principality of Antioch, forcing the younger Bohemond to allow his father to return to Antioch. Pope Innocent III also supported the restoration of BohemondIII <b>in</b> <b>Antioch,</b> but, responding to the Templars' demand, he also began urging Leo to restore Bagras to them.|$|E
5|$|Constance who {{was born}} in 1128 was the only child of Prince Bohemond II of Antioch and Alice, the second {{daughter}} of King Baldwin II of Jerusalem. Bohemond was killed in a battle at the Ceyhan River in February 1130. After his death, Alice assumed the regency for Constance. According to rumors spreading <b>in</b> <b>Antioch,</b> Alice was planning to send Constance to a monastery or to marry her off to a commoner. Bohemond's cousin, Roger II of Sicily, regarded himself as Bohemond's lawful successor because he was the senior member of the House of Hauteville.|$|E
5|$|Diocletian was <b>in</b> <b>Antioch</b> in {{the autumn}} of 302, when the next {{instance}} of persecution occurred. The deacon Romanus visited a court while preliminary sacrifices were taking place and interrupted the ceremonies, denouncing the act in a loud voice. He was arrested and sentenced to be set aflame, but Diocletian overruled the decision, and decided that Romanus should have his tongue removed instead. Romanus would be executed on November 18, 303. The boldness of this Christian displeased Diocletian, and he left the city and made for Nicomedia to spend the winter, accompanied by Galerius.|$|E

5|$|New {{conflicts}} emerged after Bohemond's eldest son, Raymond, died in 1197.

The elderly Bohemond seems to have supported his son during his last years. The War of the Antiochene Succession began with Bohemond's death and lasted until 1219.|$|E
5|$|Peace was {{restored}} with {{the mediation of}} Henry I of Jerusalem, who persuaded both Leo and Bohemond to renounce their claims to suzerainty over each other.

5|$|Affairs quieted {{after the}} initial persecution. Diocletian {{remained}} <b>in</b> <b>Antioch</b> for the following three years. He visited Egypt once, over the winter of 301302, where he began the grain dole in Alexandria. In Egypt, some Manicheans, followers of the prophet Mani, were denounced {{in the presence of}} the proconsul of Africa. On March 31, 302, in a rescript from Alexandria, Diocletian, after consultation with the proconsul for Egypt, ordered that the leading Manicheans be burnt alive along with their scriptures. This was the first time an Imperial persecution ever called for the destruction of sacred literature. Low-status Manicheans were to be executed; high-status Manicheans were to be sent to work in the quarries of Proconnesus (Marmara Island) or the mines of Phaeno. All Manichean property was to be seized and deposited in the imperial treasury.|$|E
5|$|After his victory, Zabdas marched {{south along}} the Jordan Valley and {{apparently}} met little opposition. There is evidence that Petra was attacked by a small contingent which penetrated the region. Arabia and Judaea were eventually subdued. Palmyrene dominance of Arabia is confirmed by many milestones bearing Vaballathus' name. Syrian subjugation required less effort because Zenobia had substantial support there, particularly <b>in</b> <b>Antioch,</b> Syria's traditional capital. The invasion of Arabia coincided with the cessation of coin production in Claudius' name by the Antiochean mint, indicating that Zenobia had begun tightening her grip on Syria. By November 270, the mint began issuing coinage in Vaballathus' name.|$|E
