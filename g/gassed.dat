A proposal for rationalizing the trade to ease these constraints is offered. Gas pricing, and factors driving demand are also analyzed using evidence from the literature.

The ship departed from Brest in late November with her first load of nearly 2,000 wounded and convalescing soldiers, {{many of whom were}} from the U.S. 76th Infantry Division. The former liner arrived at the Quarantine Station on 10 December 1918, and docked in New York the next day. One of the men aboard was Captain Walter Camp who had been wounded and <b>gassed</b> in the Meuse-Argonne Offensive; Camp was the son of the Yale University football coach of the same name. Another passenger on board was Sarah Wilmer, an American YWCA front-line worker who had become lost in the Argonne forest and <b>gassed</b> when a German shell exploded nearby. Before departing on her next voyage, Kroonland hosted a party for 150 newsboys from New Jersey at her Hoboken, New Jersey, pier on Christmas Day.

30|$|Natural <b>gases</b> {{were widely}} {{distributed}} in the Jiyang Depression with complicated component composition, {{and it is difficult}} to identify their genesis. Based on investigation of <b>gas</b> composition, carbon isotope ratios, light hydrocarbon properties, as well as geological analysis, natural <b>gases</b> in the Jiyang Depression are classified into two types, one is organic <b>gas</b> and the other is abiogenic <b>gas.</b> Abiogenic <b>gas</b> is mainly magmatogenic or mantle-derived CO 2. Organic <b>gases</b> are further divided into coal-type <b>gas,</b> oil-type <b>gas,</b> and biogas according to their kerogen types and formation mechanisms. The oil-type <b>gases</b> are divided into mature oil-type <b>gas</b> (oil-associated <b>gas)</b> and highly mature oil-type <b>gas.</b> The highly mature oil-type <b>gases</b> can be subdivided into oil-cracking <b>gas</b> and kerogen thermal degradation <b>gas.</b> Identification factors for each kind of hydrocarbon <b>gas</b> were summarized. Based on genesis analysis results, the genetic types of <b>gases</b> buried in different depths were discussed. Results showed that shallow <b>gases</b> (< 1, 500 Â m) are mainly mature oil-type <b>gases,</b> biogas, or secondary <b>gases.</b> Secondary <b>gases</b> are rich in methane because of chromatographic separation during migration and secondary biodegradation. Secondary biodegradation leads to richness of heavy carbon isotope ratios in methane and propane. Genesis of middle depth <b>gases</b> (1, 500 â€“ 3, 500 Â m) is dominated by mature oil-type <b>gases.</b> Deep <b>gases</b> (3, 500 â€“ 5, 500 Â m) are mainly kerogen thermal degradation <b>gas,</b> oil-cracking <b>gas,</b> and coal-type <b>gas.</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{formulated}} a short-run model, with {{an explicit}} role for monetary policy, for analyzing world oil and <b>gas</b> markets. The model described carefully {{the parameters of}} these markets and their vulnerability to business cycles. Estimates showed that short-run demand for oil and <b>gas</b> was price- inelastic, relatively income-elastic, and was influenced by interest and exchange rates; short-run supply was price-inelastic. Short-run price inelasticity could be a source for high volatility in oil and <b>gas</b> prices, and could confer to producers a temporary market power. Being simultaneous and incorporating interest and exchange rates, the model could be useful in short-term forecasting of oil and <b>gas</b> outputs and prices under policy scenarios.

Deaths took place in concentration and extermination camps, ghettos, and through mass executions. Many victims of the Holocaust were <b>gassed</b> to death, while others died of starvation or disease or while working as slave labourers. In addition to eliminating Jews, the Nazis planned to reduce the population of the conquered territories by 30 million people through starvation in an action called the Hunger Plan. Food supplies would be diverted to the German army and German civilians. Cities would be razed and the land allowed to return to forest or resettled by German colonists. Together, the Hunger Plan and Generalplan Ost would have led to the starvation of 80 million people in the Soviet Union.
