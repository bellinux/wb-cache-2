With this objective, we propose an investment model based on both prospective models and Tobin’s q. The developed model is then applied to analyse the investment determinants of material and immaterial assets over a panel of 87 non-financial Spanish firms that have been quoting on the Stock Market during 12 years. Results show that material investment decisions are isolated from immaterial assets, whereas <b>immaterial</b> <b>investment</b> is affected by tangible investment and stock.

40|$|I {{have chosen}} this topic {{because of my}} deep {{interest}} in the intellectual property rights and trademark issues especially. I consider trademarks one of the essential parts of the contemporary private law system, although it is very complicated to decide whether it pertains to the commercial law branch or to the civil law. Trademarks have connection to both the branches, but its legal provisions are highly specific and independent. The contemporary popularity of trademarks grows rapidly thanks to its major usability in practical life. Trademarks are irreplaceable, especially {{when there is a}} need to distinct between identical or similar goods and services that are offered by different producers or providers and are useful also, when {{there is a need to}} represent goods and services on the market. The trademarks can also be licensed, contractually transferred to other legal entity or can be the object of a deposit. The usability of the trademarks can be found also in their use as an <b>immaterial</b> <b>investment</b> in a company. I have chosen the trademarks topic because of its high practicality and because of creativity and originality of this legal branch. This thesis attempts to describe and analyze the trademark issues comprehensively focusing on the present legal regulation of this discipline. The thesis is [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Some {{recent studies}} have also {{advocated}} that an organization could achieve better performance and higher efficiency through establishing right quality culture. Implementing TQM and its main components represents a dramatic challenge from those of traditional management. It requires a massive change {{in the social and}} technological components of a workforce. This study examines the relationships between corporate culture, TQM implementation and financial performance of Tunisian manufacturing firms. The model is tested using structural equations, surveying 70 Tunisi- an firms. The causal analysis results show no significant and direct effect of TQM implementation on Sales and operating income growth, but a negative and significant direct effect of TQM imple- mentation on ROA and ROS. Furthermore, results show a positive and a significant relationship between corporate culture and the TQM implementation. This study also assessed the culture dimensions shared among Tunisian manufacturing firms and investigates their relationship with TQM practices. Successful adoption of TQM practices lies largely on a culture oriented innovati- on characterized by an openness to change, propensity to experiment and take risks and culture oriented people reflecting perceived support, cooperation, mutual respect and consideration be- tween organizational members. The results suggested that there was no strong evidence to verify the moderator effect of the corporate culture on the relationship between TQM implementation and financial performance. The key managerial implications of these results are that firms should- n’t get disillusioned with TQM when short-term improvements did not materialize given that TQM implementation is an expensive <b>immaterial</b> <b>investment</b> and that many cultural traits affect the bene- fits of effective TQM implementations...|$|E
40|$|The {{issue of}} {{accounting}} depreciation is an older concern of this study's authors on the incidence over the true and fair {{view of the}} earning and the net value of the non- current assets. Proceeding from the consideration that the present depreciation methods, acknowleged by the accounting standards and regulations are not sufficient to render the reality of the irreversible impairment of the fixed assets nor that of the material and <b>immaterial</b> <b>investment</b> recovery we performed a research on the indicators reported by 20 companies in Cluj county and we applied a questionnaire to each entity on the depreciation methods used, their incidence on the {{true and fair view}} and their proposals for the completion of the depreciation methods. The objective of the research is to identify the most appropriate depreciation methods, truthfully illustrating the effects of the irreversible impairment on the net asset and on the earning, to introduce the excluded assests in the cathegory of the non-current assets (like property and plant, goodwill, intangible assets created with ones own strengths) and the enforcement of appropriate treatments to the revaluation differences and their own overhead investments. The International Accounting Standard IAS 16 - Property, plant and equipment refers to three depreciation methods: the straightline method, the diminishing balance method and the technical depreciation method (units of production method). In Romania only two of these methods are accepted: the straightline method, the diminishing balance method and the accelerated method was additionally instilled, which is used internationally in exceptional situations and not currently. The results of the research led us to the following conclusions: - for the depreciation of the machinery, facilities and technological equipments it is recommended to use the technical depreciation method or the units of production method; -taking into consideration the financial conception on the non-current assets the depreciation of all cathegories of tangible and intangible assets is recommended, the purpose being the gradual recovery of the investment in these assets and not the covering of the wear and tear or obsolescence; - the surplus value resulted from the revaluation of the tangible assets musn't be depreciated because it generates in fictional expenses; - the depreciation of the overhead assets musn't be acknowledged as an expense but it should be treated as a reduction in the income resulting from fixed assets; -the completion of the depreciation concept with its financial meaning, namely the process of recovering the investments in tangible and intangible assets; The application of the research results leads to correcting the image provided by financial reportings on the tangible and intangible assets contribution to the income, the depreciation's reflection in the expenses and the net value of these assets. The contribution of the authors consists in interceding to ensure the application of the research results by modifying and completing the national accounting rules in order to achieve accounting's consecrated objective: reproducing a true and fair view on the financial position and performances.

40|$|According to {{the recent}} WIFO {{investment}} survey, which samples some 900 firms of the manufacturing sector, the construction sector and the energy sector as well as public transport enterprises and public utilities in Austria, investment spending will decrease by 6. 4 percent in nominal terms in 2002. In real terms, aggregate investment in Austria is forecast to fall by 0. 7 percent. Overall growth of the domestic economy is now gradually recovering from the downturn in 2001. The fragile development of the international economy, however, makes the uncertainty surrounding an economic upturn {{before the end of}} 2002 greater than assumed {{at the beginning of the}} year 2001. The latest business survey of the European Union supports the view that a slow recovery is under way. Although the composite index of the manufacturing sector increased during the first month of 2002, a decline was recorded in May 2002. The construction and retail trade sectors have reported pessimistic expectations since the beginning of 2002, with no sign of improvement. Due the weak growth prospects aggregate investment is forecast to decrease by 0. 7 percent in real terms. Overcapacity and weak demand motivated companies to postpone investment projects. For 2003, WIFO expects a stabilisation of business expectations and a pronounced increase in aggregate investment (+ 3. 9 percent). The enterprises of the manufacturing sector plan to reduce their investment spending substantially (- 7. 3 percent) in nominal terms, driving the investment/sales ratio down to 5. 7 percent. The firms included in the Survey primarily cut investment in buildings and in electronic equipment. <b>Immaterial</b> <b>investment</b> in R&D as well as in marketing activities are also affected by the weak growth performance. For 2001, the average R&D to sales ratio amounted to 2. 8 percent, a reduction by 0. 7 percentage points as compared to 2000. Investment spending differs widely across manufacturing sectors. Companies in the motor vehicles industry and in the non-durable consumer goods sector plan to increase their capital outlays. The producers of intermediate goods, investment goods, and durable consumer goods report reductions in planned investment. The construction sector has been heavily affected by the downturn in 2001 and there is no sign of a recovery in 2002. WIFO expects an output decline; as a consequence, investment will be weak in 2002. Specifically, reports by enterprises active in building construction indicate a reduction in investment expenditures. Production growth and investment spending will be much stronger in civil engineering as a result of large projects for building up and improving the infrastructure (e. g., tunnels for train networks and motor highways). In the electricity industry the downsizing in the course of the liberalisation process is levelling off in 2002. After several years of massive reductions in capital outlays, the survey results point to a small investment increase in 2002 (+ 1. 1 percent). Transport firms and public utilities report a reduction by 10. 7 percent.

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this article}} is to analyze how market actors, and farmers in particular, {{mobilize}} collective coordination capacities to face global changes – market price or sectorial policies – within different regional contexts. A multi-scale conceptual framework is proposed to analyze market functioning and transformation over time and space. We extend Commons and Fligstein’s work on market institutions to define the notion of competition regime as a combination of four market institutions that legitimizes competition strategies. We also mobilize Ostrom’s work on common property rights regimes to show that a competition regime relies on the creation and management of two systems of common-pool resources, namely innovation capacity and reputation-building. This paper then shows the relevance of this framework through the case study of the current restructuring of dairy supply chains in mountainous areas in France. It shows that market liberalization strongly destabilizes the regional competition regimes that were based on the appropriation of social rights inherent to the national public policies. In the hybrid and specific competition regimes, existing territorial coordination devices are not directly threatened and can support the development of new cooperative strategies. In all cases, with the development of a contractual economy, farmers are incited to develop or to strengthen coordination devices to become effective market participants. Through the development of large territorial producers’ organizations capable of managing milk supply in volume and quality, they would be able to take part in the management of the supply chains. To do so, the present paper suggests that farmers’ organizations need material and <b>immaterial</b> <b>investments</b> and assistance from regional public players to build new local collective capacities. The competition regime framework is an asset for the design of such public supports in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, taking the regional specificity of the markets’ institutions and collective capacities into account...|$|R

40|$|The {{following}} remarks {{concentrate on}} {{an aspect of}} the relation between trade and factor movements, which has been neglected in the literature so far. It is the intertemporal dimension of factor movements, which in turn is closely linked to the relation between real and financial capital movements. The focus is on capital as a factor of production - analogies with labor and other factors will only be touched upon. Capital movements in this context, are defined in the wide (Boehm-Bawerkian) sense. It is <b>immaterial</b> whether <b>investment</b> or consumption goods are traded internationally. All that is necessary to transfer "capital" is a positive balance on current account and an excess of savings over domestic investment in the capital exporting country - and the reverse in the capital importing country. This corresponds of course to net financial capital movements during the process of "real capital" transfers. It is modelled in a simple way by introducing as the one financial asset an equity share. The paper attempts a critique of the comparative static modelling of the substitution vs. complementarity relation between trade and capital movements. It therefore starts from the same Heckscher-Ohlin framework where factor price equalization is granted. It looks primarily at the conditions for efficiency in the world economy, which is attained if all the marginal equivalences are realized, especially if in addition to commodity prices factor prices are equalized across countries. If factor price equalization (FPE) is brought about by trade alone, there is thus no incentive - and no need - for international factor movements; the two are substitutes. On the other hand they are complements if because of non-FPE by trade alone factor movements are induced and are necessary to attain an efficient situation. The argument will be developed in several steps. First, the comparative static results will be reviewed using a convenient graphic illustration developed by Dixit and Norman (1980). It will then be shown that the comparative static procedure is inadequate, as capital movements in an essential way involve time. The intertemporal framework will be formulated in terms of a neoclassical growth model. Following Oniki and Uzawa (1965) it will be demonstrated that a trade pattern of specialization is particularly interesting for our problem. This scenario of growth cum trade with specialization exhibits non-FPE. If the possibility of capital movements (implying trade in securities and trade imbalances) is introduced, using a procedure suggested by Hori and Stein (1977), a factor movement will materialize, which is complementary to trade. In conclusion some open questions and possible extensions will be sketched...|$|R
