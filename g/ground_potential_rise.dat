50|$|In {{electrical}} engineering, {{earth potential}} rise (EPR) also called <b>ground</b> <b>potential</b> <b>rise</b> (GPR) {{occurs when a}} large current flows to earth through an earth grid impedance. The potential relative to a distant point on the Earth is highest {{at the point where}} current enters the ground, and declines with distance from the source. <b>Ground</b> <b>potential</b> <b>rise</b> is a concern in the design of electrical substations because the high potential may be a hazard to people or equipment.|$|E
50|$|A {{grounding}} (earthing) {{system must}} be designed. The total <b>ground</b> <b>potential</b> <b>rise,</b> and the gradients in potential during a fault (called touch and step potentials), must be calculated to protect passers-by during a short-circuit in the transmission system. Earth faults at a substation can cause a <b>ground</b> <b>potential</b> <b>rise.</b> Currents flowing in the Earth's surface during a fault can cause metal objects to have a significantly different voltage than the ground under a person's feet; this touch potential presents a hazard of electrocution. Where a substation has a metallic fence, it must be properly grounded to protect people from this hazard.|$|E
50|$|Moreover, during fault {{conditions}} electromagnetic perturbations may rise significantly and disturb those communications channels based on copper wires. The {{reliability of the}} communications link interconnecting the protection relays is critical and therefore must be resistant to effects encountered in high voltage areas, such as high frequency induction and <b>ground</b> <b>potential</b> <b>rise.</b>|$|E
40|$|For {{calculations}} and measurements of transient characteristics of groundings, {{the current and}} potential lead wires are frequently used accordingly to inject the current into the grounding and find the <b>grounding</b> <b>potential</b> <b>rise</b> (GPR). The results of the {{calculations and}} measurements can be dependent on {{the location of the}} current and potential lead wires due to mutual influence between them and the grounding wire. It is important to determine to what extent the location of the wires influences the calculation results for the grounding with a simple configuration. Notably, in contrast to the measurements, for the calculations it is possible to locate wires vertically, also the potential lead wire can be replaced by the integral of the electric field. For the calculations the finite difference time domain method (FDTD) has been used in the work. In order to estimate to what extent the calculated GPR can be influenced by location of the wires, calculations with different wires locations have been carried out. An analysis of the calculation results has been made. There are calculation methods in which the injection of the current and calculation of the GPR are performed without the current and potential lead wires. The method based on the telegrapher's equations is one of such methods. In order to determine what location of the lead wires gives the same calculation results as those of the method that uses the telegrapher's equations, a comparison of calculation results of two methods has been made. Based on the calculation results it can be concluded that the calculated transient characteristics depend to a different extent on such factors as mutual location of the lead wires and the grounding wire, replacing the potential lead wire by the integral of the electric field, electrical parameters of the soil. Location of one of the lead wires above the grounding wire significantly reduces the calculated GPR. Calculation results for a perpendicular location of three wires (the lead ones and the grounding wire) using the FDTD method correspond to those of the method based on the telegrapher's equation. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{touch or}} step {{voltages}} which {{exist in the}} vicinity of a grounding electrode are closely related to the earth structure and resistivity and the ground current. The grounding design approach is required to determine the grounding electrode location where the hazardous voltages are minimized. In this paper, in order to propose a method of mitigating the electric shock hazards caused by the <b>ground</b> surface <b>potential</b> <b>rise</b> {{in the vicinity of}} a counterpoise, the hazards relevant to touch voltage were evaluated {{as a function of the}} soil resistivity ratio for several practical values of two-layer earth structures. The touch voltage and current on the ground surface just above the test electrode are calculated with CDEGS program. As a consequence, it was found that burying a grounding electrode in the soil with low resistivity is effective to reduce the electric shock hazards. In the case that the bottom layer soil where a counterpoise is buried has lower resistivity than the upper layer soil, when the upper layer soil resistivity is increased, the surface potential is slightly raised, but the current through the human body is reduced with increasing the upper layer soil resistivity because of the greater contact resistance between the earth surface and the feet. The electric shock hazard in the vicinity of grounding electrodes is closely related to soil structure and resistivity and are reduced wit...|$|R
40|$|Low voltage, {{single-phase}} residential loads {{are usually}} {{supplied by the}} local utility, through a common distribution system (CDS) in a radial layout. In US and UE typical distribution systems, a faulted dwelling unit can affect a healthy one by transferring <b>ground</b> <b>rise</b> <b>potentials,</b> sometime dangerous. The authors propose a novel system defined as TN-island grounding system with the adoption for each customer of a local transformer (LT) with taps, grounded at the mid-point of the secondary winding, supplied by a common distribution system with the neutral grounded but not distributed. This solution allows to reach several goals: - to elevate the immunity of dwelling units, - to stop <b>potential</b> <b>rises,</b> due to <b>ground</b> faults, and of circulation of stray currents - to balance the distributed capacitance-to-ground - to limit the triplen current harmonics naturally caused by the LT - to supply more customers and locally high power common loads HPCL of buildings - to organize common emergency system (UPS and generator sets), common power system management, loads shedding, etc. Moreover, for special conditions (i. e. swimming pool, medical rooms, damp houses), the use of local transformers LTs allows to adopt proper reduced voltage system recommendable owing to the lower value of touch voltage and to adopt further local ungrounded system (IEC IT-system...|$|R
50|$|Initially these {{networks}} {{were made of}} metallic conductive media, however {{the vulnerability of the}} 56-64 kbit/s channels to electromagnetic interference, signal ground loops, and <b>ground</b> <b>potential</b> <b>rise</b> made them too unreliable for the power industry. Strong electromagnetic fields caused by the high voltages and currents in power lines occur regularly in electric substations.|$|E
50|$|This {{case is a}} {{simplified}} system; practical earthing systems are more complex than a single rod, and the soil will have varying resistivity. It can, however, reliably {{be said that the}} resistance of a ground grid is inversely proportional to the area it covers; this rule can be used to quickly assess the degree of difficulty for a particular site. Programs running on desktop personal computers can model ground resistance effects and produce detailed calculations of <b>ground</b> <b>potential</b> <b>rise,</b> using various techniques including the finite element method.|$|E
5000|$|Telecommunication {{standards}} {{define a}} [...] "zone of influence" [...] around a substation, inside of which, equipment and circuits {{must be protected}} from the effect of <b>ground</b> <b>potential</b> <b>rise.</b> In North American practice, the zone of influence {{is considered to be}} bounded by the [...] "300 volt point", which is the point along a telecommunications circuit at which the GPR reaches 300 volts with respect to distant earth. [...] The 300 volt point defining a zone of influence around a sub station is dependent on the ground resistivity in ohms, the amount of fault current in amperes. It will define a boundary a certain distance from the ground grid of the sub station. Each sub station has its own zone of influence since the variables explained above are different for each location.|$|E
25|$|A {{particular}} concern in design of electrical substations is earth <b>potential</b> <b>rise.</b> When very large fault currents are {{injected into the}} earth, {{the area around the}} point of injection may rise to a high potential with respect to distant points. This is due to the limited finite conductivity of the layers of soil in the earth. The gradient of the voltage (changing voltage within a distance) may be so high that two points on the ground may be at significantly different potentials, creating a hazard to anyone standing {{on the ground in the}} area. Pipes, rails, or communication wires entering a substation may see different <b>ground</b> <b>potentials</b> inside and outside the substation, creating a dangerous touch voltage.|$|R

50|$|Earth <b>Potential</b> <b>Rise</b> (EPR) {{is caused}} by {{electrical}} faults that occur at electrical substations, power plants, or high-voltage transmission lines. Short-circuit current flows through the plant structure and equipment and into the grounding electrode. The resistance of the Earth is non-zero, so current injected into the earth at the grounding electrode produces a <b>potential</b> <b>rise</b> {{with respect to a}} distant reference point. The resulting <b>potential</b> <b>rise</b> can cause hazardous voltage, many hundreds of metres away from the actual fault location.

40|$|A {{grounding}} system is generally composed of several vertical, horizontal electrodes or grids. Excessive ground potential rises due to adjacent grounding electrodes can cause failures or misoperation of electronic devices and control systems.

In this paper, in order to propose a method for evaluating the <b>ground</b> <b>potential</b> <b>rise</b> and interference {{in the vicinity of}} vertical grounding electrodes, the experimental and theoretical results on the potential interference between vertical grounding electrodes and its frequency dependence were described.

40|$|In this paper, {{earthing}} system models for wind turbines are developed under variable frequency and transient conditions. Under high frequency and high resistivity, a {{fall in the}} earth <b>potential</b> <b>rise</b> occurs which suggests a strong capacitive effect at these frequencies. For on-shore windfarms, {{it was found that}} earthing interconnection of adjacent wind turbine structures is beneficial in reducing transient earth <b>potential</b> <b>rise</b> (TEPR) under impulse conditions. For the on-shore scenario, the benefits of interconnection extend to at least three turbines either side of the struck turbine. However, in an off-shore environment, the benefits of interconnection are less significant due to the low resistivity of the water which limits the effective length to less than that of a typical inter-turbine spacing. It was established that, for high frequency and transient conditions, the magnitude of the <b>potential</b> <b>rise,</b> seen from the point of injection, is significantly higher when the above-ground structure is taken into account.

The evaluation of {{efficacy of the}} lightning protection schemes among others requires an accurate knowledge of the consequential <b>potential</b> <b>rise</b> at the struck point and the current injected into soil at the earth termination. The present work has made a detailed effort to deduce these quantities for the lightning protection scheme of the Indian satellite launch pad-I. A reduced scale model of the system with a frequency domain approach is employed for the experimental study. For further validation of the experimental approach, numerical simulations using numerical electromagnetic code- 2 are also carried out on schemes involving single tower.

Grounding {{system must be}} safe as it is directly concerned with safety of persons working within the substation. The ground resistance, grid resistance, <b>ground</b> <b>potential</b> <b>rise,</b> step and touch voltage criteria for safety, maximum grid current, minimum conductor size, electrode size, maximum fault current level and soil resistivity are the basic design quantities of the grounding grid system. In this paper the design of grounding system for 220 KV high voltage substations and simulation for calculation of required parameters has been presented. A careful analysis {{was carried out in}} order to obtain the magnitude of total fault current that may occur in the substation. Soil resistivity is a major factor influencing substation grid design. Therefore, a resistivity investigation and analysis was carried out in order to obtain accurate design results. All necessary parameters were computed and assumptions were made using the relevant formulas. It has also been tried to reduce the grid resistance as well as <b>ground</b> <b>potential</b> <b>rise</b> by selecting the proper horizontal conductor size and addition of ground rods. A step by step procedure for the essential design considerations has been considered. Finally, simulations were carried out using software known as ETAP Software for verification of the design.
