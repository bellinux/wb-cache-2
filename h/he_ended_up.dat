5|$|Following graduation, Brown {{sought to}} enroll in a college outside of the South. His principal, Nathaniel Burger, advised he attend an all-black college, as his brother Marvin Brown had done, however, <b>he</b> <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> enrolling at Ohio State University as his {{childhood}} role model, Jesse Owens, had done. Burger told Brown only seven African Americans had graduated from the school that year, but Brown nonetheless was determined to enroll, feeling he would compete well with white students.|$|E

5|$|NASCAR, {{and stock}} car racing in general, {{has its roots}} in bootlegging during Prohibition. Junior Johnson was one of many bootleggers {{who took part in the}} sport during the 1950s, equally well known for his arrest in 1955 for {{operating}} his father's moonshine still as he is for his racing success. <b>He</b> <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> spending a year in an Ohio prison, but soon returned to the sport before retiring as a driver in 1966.|$|E
5|$|Nathan {{graduated}} from Pine Bush High School in Pine Bush, New York in 1992, {{where he played}} basketball and baseball and ran track. Only Division III colleges showed minimal interest in him, and <b>he</b> <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> at Stony Brook University largely because his high school assistant coach Jeff Masionet and Stony Brook baseball coach Matt Senk knew each other as former teammates in the State University of New York at Cortland baseball program.|$|E
5|$|There are {{contradictory}} {{accounts of}} Abbe's last years in Japan.

Sources appear to agree, however, that Abbe was in poor spirits and poor health towards the end of his life. He suffered a stroke on 17 November 1985, and was hospitalised.|$|E

5|$|A win at the World 10K Bangalore, {{where he}} beat Moses Kipsiro in 27:51, was the {{highlight}} of a low-key build up to the 2008 Beijing Olympics. In August, Zersenay was among some forty runners competing for the medals in the 10,000 metres Olympic final. Zersenay's brother, Kidane, was also competing and he led for most of first half of what was a quick race. Zersenay Tadese had the lead at the 7–8000m mark but Bekele and Sihine sprinted into first and second. Although Zersenay's time almost equalled the previous Olympic record for the event, <b>he</b> <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> one second behind Kenyans Moses Masai and Micah Kogo, taking fifth place overall.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{receiving}} enquiries {{from other}} clubs, he stayed at Vicarage Road for pre-season, {{in the hope}} of regaining his match fitness. After proving that he had recovered, Gibbs was offered a short term contract at the club, which was eventually extended. Newly relegated Watford finished 13th of 24 teams in 1996–97. They conceded 38 goals in 46 league matches, the joint-best defensive record in the division. Gibbs missed just one of the club's 57 fixtures, scoring in a game against Brentford. The defender later noted the irony that having been released as an injury concern, <b>he</b> <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> playing more games the following season than any of his teammates.|$|E
5|$|Louis {{assembled}} his armies in Temesvár (now Timișoara in Romania) in February 1365. According a royal charter that year, he {{was planning}} to invade Wallachia because the new voivode, Vladislav Vlaicu, had refused to obey him. However, <b>he</b> <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> heading a campaign against the Bulgarian Tsardom of Vidin and its ruler Ivan Sratsimir, which suggests that Vladislav Vlaicu had in the meantime yielded to him. Louis seized Vidin and imprisoned Ivan Stratsimir in May or June. Within three months, his troops occupied Ivan Stratsimir's realm, which was organized into a separate border province, or banate, under the command of Hungarian lords.|$|E

5|$|On a dare, Antonucci {{then decided}} that he would try {{producing}} a children's animated series of his own. While designing a commercial, <b>he</b> <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> drawing three characters that he felt particularly pleased with. Growing excited over their potential, he named them Ed, Edd, and Eddy and spent the following months developing a show around them. He faxed a one-page concept sheet to Cartoon Network and Nickelodeon in 1996. Both studios quickly responded, Cartoon Network in only 20 minutes, and were enthusiastic and wanted to see more; they each demanded creative control, however, and Antonucci refused. After Cartoon Network agreed to let Antonucci have control of the show, conversations between Antonucci and the studio continued.|$|E
5|$|Reagan's {{campaign}} {{relied on}} a strategy crafted by campaign manager John Sears of winning a few primaries early to damage the inevitability of Ford's likely nomination. Reagan won North Carolina, Texas, and California, but the strategy failed, as <b>he</b> <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> losing New Hampshire, Florida, and his native Illinois. The Texas campaign lent renewed hope to Reagan, when he swept all 96 delegates chosen in the May 1 primary, with four more awaiting at the state convention. Much {{of the credit for}} that victory came from the work of three co-chairmen, including Ernest Angelo, the mayor of Midland, and Ray Barnhart of Houston, whom Reagan as President would appoint in 1981 as director of the Federal Highway Administration.|$|E

He tells Kate that his real name isn't Sawyer and that the letter was written to the real Sawyer, a con man, who ruined his family. <b>He</b> <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> {{becoming}} a con man himself, so he took the name Sawyer as an alias.

5|$|The {{appearances}} of the Turk were profitable for Mälzel, {{and he continued}} by taking it and his other machines to the United States. In 1826, he opened an exhibition in New York City that slowly grew in popularity, giving rise to many newspaper stories and anonymous threats of exposure of the secret. Mälzel's problem was finding a proper director for the machine, having trained an unknown woman in France {{before coming to the}} United States. <b>He</b> <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> recalling a former director, William Schlumberger, from Alsace in Europe to come to America and work for him again once Mälzel was able to provide the money for Schlumberger's transport.|$|E
5|$|The group {{released}} several successful albums, including December's Children (And Everybody's), Aftermath and Between the Buttons, but {{in their}} personal lives their behaviour was brought into question. In 1967, Jagger and Richards were arrested on drug charges and were given unusually harsh sentences: Jagger was sentenced to three months' imprisonment for possession of four over-the-counter pep pills he had purchased in Italy. The traditionally conservative editor of The Times, William Rees-Mogg, wrote an article critical of the sentences; and on appeal Richards' sentence was overturned and Jagger's was amended to a conditional discharge (although <b>he</b> <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> spending one night inside London's Brixton Prison). The Rolling Stones continued to face legal battles for the next decade.|$|E
