50|$|In a {{telephone}} network, flood search routing is non-deterministic routing {{in which a}} <b>dialed</b> <b>number</b> received at a switch is transmitted to all switches, i.e., flooded, in the area code directly connected to that switch; if the <b>dialed</b> <b>number</b> is not an affiliated subscriber at that switch, the number is then retransmitted to all directly connected switches, and then routed through the switch that has the <b>dialed</b> <b>number</b> corresponding to the particular user end instrument affiliated with it. All digits of the numbering plan are used to identify a particular subscriber. Flood search routing allows subscribers to have telephone numbers independent of switch codes. Flood search routing provides the highest probability that {{a telephone}} call will go through even though a number of switches and links fail.|$|E
50|$|Cell phones {{generally}} do not use dial tones, because the technology used to transmit the <b>dialed</b> <b>number</b> is different from a landline.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>dialed</b> <b>number</b> is {{translated}} into an IP address and named the endpoint {{of the application}} server, and the call is routed there.|$|E

50|$|In telecommunications, {{the call}} setup success rate (CSSR) is the {{fraction}} of the attempts {{to make a call}} that result in a connection to the <b>dialled</b> <b>number</b> (due to various reasons not all call attempts end with a connection to the <b>dialled</b> <b>number).</b> This fraction is usually measured as a percentage of all call attempts made.|$|R
50|$|Parentheses {{are used}} in {{national}} notation to indicate digits that are sometimes not dialed, such as area code in variable-length <b>dialing</b> <b>numbering</b> plans. Parentheses are not allowed in the international notation, according to the standard, as international callers use fixed <b>number</b> <b>dialing.</b>|$|R

50|$|Most analog {{telephone}} adapters for Internet-based telecommunications (VoIP) recognize and translate DTMF tones but ignore dial pulses, an issue which also exists for some PBX systems. Like cellular handsets, telephones designed for voice-over-IP use out-of-band signaling {{to send the}} <b>dialed</b> <b>number.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{international}} standard for telephone signaling utilizes dual-tone multi-frequency (DTMF) signaling, more {{commonly known as}} touch-tone dialing. It replaced the older and slower pulse dial system. The push-button format is also used for all cell phones, but with out-of-band signaling of the <b>dialed</b> <b>number.</b>|$|E

50|$|Originally {{designed}} {{along with}} the panel type telephone office, PCI was intended to allow subscribers in fully automated exchanges to <b>dial</b> <b>numbers</b> in manual offices {{the same way they}} <b>dialed</b> <b>numbers</b> in their own exchange. For PCI to achieve its purpose, the panel office sent the requested number to the manual office, where the number was lit on an operator's display. The switchboard operator at a PCI-aware manual office reads the number from the call indicator display and completes the call in the usual way. As a format of interoffice signaling, PCI is one of multiple options retained for compatibility in the #5 Crossbar switch, a later system which served as the platform for the initial DTMF push-button telephone services.|$|R

50|$|A pen register, or <b>dialed</b> <b>number</b> {{recorder}} (DNR), is {{an electronic}} device that records all numbers called {{from a particular}} telephone line.

50|$|In {{addition}} to the inconvenience and embarrassment that may result from an erroneously <b>dialed</b> <b>number,</b> the phenomenon can have other consequences including using up a phone user's airtime minutes. Accidental calls, if not hung up immediately, tie up the recipient's phone line. If this is a landline, the recipient {{may not be able}} to disconnect the call in order to use the phone.|$|E

5000|$|American Telephone & Telegraph (AT&T) first {{introduced}} 800 Toll-Free service in 1967. When AT&T {{was the only}} Interexchange Carrier (IC), Local Exchange Carriers (LECs) automatically routed all Toll-Free calls directly to AT&T Points of Presence (POP) without performing a translation from the Toll-Free number to the terminating number. The LECs routed the calls to AT&T based on the first 3 digits (800) of the <b>dialed</b> <b>number.</b> AT&T then performed all number translations and service area validation screenings.|$|E
5000|$|Cold {{transfer}}: This {{transfer is}} in reality not a transfer, but a pass-on {{of information for}} the caller to call a particular number after they hang up the current call. However, in certain instances a cold transfer may be implemented by calling the desired number {{on behalf of the}} caller, the original call handler/operator then drops-off without waiting for the called number to be picked up irrespective if the <b>dialed</b> <b>number</b> had queue management implemented or not (see above in point #2).|$|E
50|$|A {{related service}} feature {{available}} to {{private branch exchange}} subscribers is the <b>Dialed</b> <b>Number</b> Identification Service (DNIS), a code indicating the number requested by the caller. With the information, a service provider can have several toll-free numbers directed to the same call center and provide unique service {{based on the number}} dialed. DNIS {{can also be used to}} identify other call routing information. For example, toll-free service can be configured to send a specific DNIS number that is assigned to callers from geographic regions based on city, area code, state, or country.|$|E
50|$|Other {{countries}} {{have sought to}} use technical means to prevent callback, by blocking the inbound and outbound calls made to and from DID numbers, or by disabling touch tone dialing.

50|$|Historically, not all {{push-button}} telephones used DTMF dialing technology. Some manufacturers implemented {{pulse dialing}} with push-button keypads and even Western Electric produced several telephone models with a push-button keypad that could also emit traditional dial pulses. Sometimes the mode was user-selectable with a {{switch on the}} telephone. Pulse-mode push-button keypads typically stored the <b>dialed</b> <b>number</b> sequence in a digit collector register to permit rapid dialing for the user. Some push button pulse dial phones allow for double-speed pulse dialing. These allow even faster pulse dialing in exchanges that recognize double-speed pulse dialing.|$|E
5000|$|ACDs route {{incoming}} {{calls to the}} most qualified employee or employees within a company that can address a caller's needs. The technology can also use rule-based instructions such as caller ID, automatic number identification, interactive voice response or <b>dialed</b> <b>number</b> identification services to determine how calls are handled. ACD systems are often found in offices that handle large volumes of incoming phone calls from callers who have no {{need to talk to}} a specific person, but require assistance from any of multiple persons (e.g., customer service representatives) at the earliest opportunity.|$|E
5000|$|Additionally, for voice T1s {{there are}} two main types: {{so-called}} [...] "plain" [...] or Inband T1s and PRI (Primary Rate Interface). While both carry voice telephone calls in similar fashion, PRIs are commonly used in call centers and provide not only the 23 actual usable telephone lines (Known as [...] "B" [...] channels for bearer) but also a 24th line (Known as the [...] "D" [...] channel for data) that carries line signaling information. This special [...] "D" [...] channel carries: Caller ID (CID) and automatic number identification (ANI) data, required channel type (usually a B, or Bearer channel), call handle, <b>Dialed</b> <b>Number</b> Identification Service (DNIS) info, requested channel number and a request for response.|$|E

50|$|A number {{translation}} service translates a <b>dialled</b> telephone <b>number,</b> typically beginning 08 in the UK to a geographical 'connect number' beginning 01 or 02 in the UK. The connect number may be changed without changing the published <b>dialled</b> <b>number.</b> Originally NTS numbers were used, for example, to allow any caller to dial a local {{call to the}} called party irrespective of location, saving money if the connect number was not also a local call, but the system gradually {{came to be seen}} as a way of making money and now most phone companies charge the caller more for 08 numbers than for 01, 02 or 03 numbers.|$|R
