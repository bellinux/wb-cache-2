5|$|Bart stays up late on Christmas Eve to kill Santa Claus for not {{bringing}} him a dirt bike three Christmases ago. He eventually falls asleep and dreams that the Polar Express, driven by Otto Mann, lands {{in front of}} the house and flies him to the North Pole. Bart meets Santa (Krusty the Clown) only to find out that he has run out of money, since giving out presents in return for cookies every year is not a sustainable business model. Feeling pity, Bart decides that Santa no longer has to give him a dirt bike and leaves with Santa throwing a party in his office after revealing <b>how</b> <b>stupid</b> kids are.|$|E

500|$|Martin {{appeared}} in victory lane {{to celebrate his}} fifth win of the season, and his first at the New Hampshire Motor Speedway, in front of 101,000 who attended the race. Martin also earned $232,750 in race winnings. Montoya was somewhat frustrated with the result, saying: [...] "Martin just screwed me -- he just stopped {{the car on the}} apex, right on the bottom, and I had nowhere to go," [...] Montoya said. [...] "I could have pushed him out of the way ... but I respect him a lot." [...] Martin was delighted with his victory: [...] "Alan [...] won the race, Alan's the man. This is a dream come true. ... We still have the lotto at Talladega , and [...] think we'll run OK at Martinsville. We finished [...] in the spring, but I don't run good there -- but this is my hardest place. It's a tough place." [...] Martin also argued that his driving did not cause the final caution: [...] " [...] Once you got the lead, you need to make sure you don't drive it in there and turn it sideways (and) slide it up the racetrack. I mean, <b>how</b> <b>stupid</b> would I look then?" ...|$|E
500|$|Joy Division {{were due}} to begin their first American tour in May 1980. While Curtis had {{expressed}} a desire to take time off to visit a few acquaintances, he feigned excitement about the tour around the band because {{he did not want to}} disappoint either his bandmates or Factory Records. At the time, Curtis's relationship with his wife, Deborah (the couple had married in 1975 as teenagers), was strained. Contributing factors were his ill health, his excluding her from band activities, and his affair with a young Belgian woman named Annik Honoré whom he had met on a 1979 European tour. The evening before Joy Division were to fly out for their first American tour, Curtis returned to his home in Macclesfield to talk to his by then estranged wife. He asked her to drop the divorce suit she had filed; later, he told her to leave him alone in the house until he caught a train to Manchester the following morning. Early on 18 May 1980, having spent the night watching the Werner Herzog film Stroszek, Curtis hanged himself in his kitchen. Deborah discovered his body later that day when she returned to their home. It came as a shock both to the band members and their management. In 2005, Wilson recollected: [...] "I think all of us made the mistake of not thinking his suicide was going to happen We all completely underestimated the danger. We didn't take it seriously. That's <b>how</b> <b>stupid</b> we were".|$|E

2500|$|A {{report in}} November 2010 {{suggested}} that Hatcher, along with co-star Felicity Huffman, would be quitting Desperate Housewives, but ABC denied the claim. Hatcher later addressed the rumors of her departure from Desperate Housewives, saying that [...] "here {{are not enough}} adjectives to describe <b>how</b> <b>stupid,</b> off base, and ridiculously untrue this is". However, after the show concluded in 2012, media sources revealed an apparent rift with her co-stars. It has been widely speculated that the cast did not get along well with Hatcher. Eva Longoria, Felicity Huffman, Marcia Cross, and Vanessa Williams gave thank-you gifts to the crew from the show which included a message with their names subscribed at the end, and Hatcher's name was distinctly absent. TV Guide source, William Keck, revealed that [...] "something went down" [...] between Hatcher and the cast that caused a split and also observed how Hatcher would physically distance herself from the others during breaks in filming. On her end, Hatcher said to TV Guide that [...] "I will never disclose the true and complicated journey of us all, but I wish everyone on the show well." [...] Longoria denied any animosity saying to David Letterman, [...] "we all get along." [...] Remarkably, a friend of Longoria's revealed, to another media source, that Hatcher [...] "excluded herself {{from the rest of}} the cast from day one", and that she chose to end it all on a sad note, saying that [...] "doing the last press they will ever do for the show, the ladies stood united and were shocked when Teri simply didn't show up".|$|E
2500|$|The Miranda {{character}} receives {{negative comments}} to her videos from viewers who are {{fooled by the}} character and {{believe that they are}} watching a serious video by a bad entertainer. Ballinger told Backstage: [...] "It's sort of like an Andy Kaufman thing. You wouldn't believe the hate mail. ... You would never say that stuff to someone's face, but you can type anything online." [...] TheaterJones commented that [...] "perhaps because the Internet is some crazy postmodern distortion of reality, people ... felt it was their duty to point out how woefully untalented [...] was, in the most horrific ways. ... Her hate mail, which she reads some of on stage, is an art form all its own." [...] Ballinger noted: [...] "The whole reason Miranda went viral is because people were making fun of <b>how</b> <b>stupid</b> it was. If I didn't get hate mail, I wouldn't have a job." [...] The online critics were so harsh that Miranda became a [...] "hero of the anti-bullying movement". Her young fans find the character empowering because they see, perhaps selectively, [...] "a conservatively attired girl who does what she likes, gets lots of attention and has bottomless self-esteem." [...] Miranda also teaches that [...] "Popular girls don’t have to be stylish. ... Fear no one. ... It's [...] to be cranky." [...] An article at The Conversation observed that some YouTubers [...] "use humour and satire to challenge ideas of popular femininity. ... Miranda Sings... puts on monstrous makeup to perform parody music videos [...] being conventionally pretty." [...] Fans of the character who are studying the performing arts say that Miranda is [...] "a role model and a 'strong woman in comedy'" [...] that inspires confidence in their performance and social skills.|$|E
