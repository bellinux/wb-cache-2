40|$|The {{design of}} complex VLSI {{circuits}} is typically {{based on the}} decomposition of the routing area into regions to be connected independently of one another. This approach {{requires the use of}} a tool for the definition of these regions and their ordering through a suitable <b>interconnection</b> <b>sequence.</b> In this paper, an algorithm is proposed that is able to successfully define and order routing regions for generic macrocell structures in which non-rectangular blocks are utilized. The ordering scheme involves the building and management of a floor plan graph to extract the intrinsic dependence among regions. The program produces the complete specification of each routing region, the information of which type of routing tool can be used for connecting each routing region (channel or switchbox), and the order according to which regions will be connected...|$|E
40|$|The {{interconnections}} of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) continuous cryostat {{have been}} completed in fall 2007 : 1695 interconnections magnet to magnet and 224 interconnections between the continuous cryostat and the cryogenic distribution line have been executed along the 27  km of the LHC. The very tight schedule, {{the complexity of the}} <b>interconnection</b> <b>sequence,</b> the strict quality standards applied have required the creation of an ad hoc organization in order to steer and coordinate the activities on the worksite dispersed along the whole accelerator ring. The concatenation of construction and test phases carried out by CERN staff, CERN collaborating institutes and contractors have led to the necessity of a common approach and of a very effective information flow. In this paper, after having recalled the main technical challenges, we review the organizational choices that have been taken and we briefly analyze the development of the worksite in term of allocated resources and production...|$|E
50|$|Operation Reduction for Low Power is a ASIC Program {{transformation}} {{technique used}} to reduce the power consumed by a specific application. A program transformation is any operation that changes the computational structure such as nature and type of computational models, their <b>interconnections,</b> <b>sequencing</b> of operations keeping the input output behavior intact. We basically use Operation reduction {{to reduce the number}} of operations to be done to perform a task which reduces the hardware required and in turn power consumption. For example in a given Application specific IC reducing the number of independent additions required automatically reduces the adders required and also the power consumed.|$|R
50|$|A camlock is an {{interchangeable}} {{electrical connector}} {{often used in}} temporary electrical power production and distribution. The most common form is the 16 series, rated at 400 amperes with 105 °C terminations. Also in common use is the 15 series (mini-cam), rated at 150 amperes. A larger version is made denoted as the 17 series with ratings up to 760 A. A ball nose version and a longer nose standard version exist-the latter is the most common. Another version is the Posi-lok which has controlled <b>interconnection</b> <b>sequencing</b> to a panel and a shrouded connector body.The early version original connector was hot-vulcanized to the cable body;later versions use dimensional pressure to exclude foreign material from the connector pin area;the tail of the connector insulator body is trimmable to fit the cable outer diameter.|$|R

40|$|For several decades, {{technology}} scaling {{has brought}} many {{orders of magnitude}} improvements in digital CMOS performance and similar economic benefits to consumers. Feature size is quickly approaching nanometer scale, and the associated large variability imposes grand challenges in achieving reliable and robust operation. This is especially so for high-precision analog and mixed-signal circuits since they have always relied on accurate device matching which will not be available in nanometer CMOS or emerging technologies. This dissertation is aiming to develop design methodologies for overcoming such grand challenges without the conventional matching requirements. The underlining hypothesis is that, from a population of devices with significant variability, correct <b>interconnection</b> and <b>sequencing</b> can produce an effective system level matching that is several orders of magnitude better than the original devices. The optimal solution is non-deterministic polynomial-time hard but a simple ordered element matching strategy based on ordered statistics produces dramatically improved matching. Practical implementation of the new matching strategy is demonstrated on a 15 -bit binary-weighted current-steering digital-to-analog converter design in a 130 nm CMOS technology. The core area of the chip is less than 0. 42 mm 2, among which the MSB current source area is well within 0. 021 mm 2. Measurement results {{have shown that the}} differential nonlinearity and integral nonlinearity can be reduced from 9. 85 LSB and 17. 41 LSB to 0. 34 LSB and 0. 77 LSB, respectively...|$|R
40|$|The main {{components}} of the LHC, the next world-class facility in high-energy physics, are the twin-aperture high-field superconducting cryomagnets to be installed in the existing 26. 7 -km long tunnel. After installation and alignment, the cryomagnets have to be interconnected. The interconnections must ensure the continuity of several functions: vacuum enclosures, beam pipe image currents (RF contacts), cryogenic circuits, electrical power supply, and thermal insulation. In the machine, about 1700 interconnections between cryomagnets are necessary. The interconnections constitute a unique system that is nearly entirely assembled in the tunnel. For each of them, various operations must be done: TIG welding of cryogenic channels (~ 50 000 welds), induction soldering of main superconducting cables (~ 10 000 joints), ultrasonic welding of auxiliary superconducting cables (~ 20 000 welds), mechanical assembly of various elements, and installation of the multi-layer insulation (~ 200 000 m 2). Defective junctions could be very difficult and expensive to detect and repair. Reproducible and reliable processes must be implemented together with a strict quality control. The interconnection activities are optimized taking into account several constraints: limited space availability, tight installation schedule, high level of quality, high reliability and economical aspects. In this paper, the functions to be fulfilled by the interconnections and the various technologies selected are presented. Quality control at different levels (component/ interconnect, subsystem, system) is also described. The <b>interconnection</b> assembly <b>sequences</b> are summarized. Finally, the validation of the interconnection procedures is presented, based in particular on the LHC prototype cell assembly (STRING 2) ...|$|R
