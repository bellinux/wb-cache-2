40|$|Context. <b>Dust</b> <b>deposits</b> or <b>dust</b> cover are a {{prevalent}} morphology in {{the northern}} hemi-nucleus of comet 67 P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko (67 P). The evolution of the <b>dust</b> <b>deposits</b> was captured by the OSIRIS camera system onboard the Rosetta spacecraft having escorted the comet for over two years. The observations {{shed light on the}} fundamental role of cometary activity in shaping and transforming the surface morphology. Aims: We aim to present OSIRIS observations of surface changes over the <b>dust</b> <b>deposits</b> before and after perihelion. The distribution of changes and a timeline of their occurrence are provided. We perform a data analysis to quantify the surface changes and investigate their correlation to water activity from the <b>dust</b> <b>deposits.</b> We further discuss how the results of our investigation are related to other findings from the Rosetta mission. Methods: Surface changes were detected via systematic comparison of images, and quantified using shape-from-shading technique. Thermal models were applied to estimate the erosion of water ice in response to the increasing insolation over the areas where surface changes occurred. Modeling results were used for the interpretation of the observed surface changes. Results: Surface changes discussed here were concentrated at mid-latitudes, between about 20 °N and 40 °N, marking a global transition from the dust-covered to rugged terrains. The changes were distributed in open areas exposed to ample solar illumination and likely subject to enhanced surface erosion before perihelion. The occurrence of changes followed the southward migration of the sub-solar point across the latitudes of their distribution. The erosion at locations of most changes was at least about 0. 5 m, but most likely did not exceed several meters. The erosive features before perihelion had given way to a fresh, smooth cover of <b>dust</b> <b>deposits</b> after perihelion, suggesting that the <b>dust</b> <b>deposits</b> had been globally restored by at least about 1 m with ejecta from the intensely illuminated southern hemi-nucleus around perihelion, when the north was inactive during polar night. Conclusions: The erosion and restoration of the northern <b>dust</b> <b>deposits</b> are morphological expressions of seasonality on 67 P. Based on observations and thermal modeling results, it is inferred that the <b>dust</b> <b>deposits</b> contained a few percent of water ice in mass on average. Local inhomogeneity in water abundance at spatial scales below tens of meters is likely. We suspect that dust ejected from the deposits may not have escaped the comet in bulk. That is, {{at least half of the}} ejected mass was afloat in the inner-coma or/and redeposited over other areas of the nucleus...|$|R

40|$|Eolian <b>dust</b> <b>deposits</b> {{in north}} China provide an {{excellent}} means of determining past variations in continental paleoclimate and atmospheric circulation. However, debate still exists on which deserts in east Asia are the dominant sources of Chinese loess {{and whether the}} dust provenance has shifted significantly at different time scales. Here we present new constraints on the provenance of fine-grained <b>dust</b> <b>deposited</b> on the central Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP) by combining electron spin resonance signal intensity and crystallinity index of fine-grained quartz contained in samples from two loess-paleosol sequences. Our {{results show that the}} fine-grained <b>dust</b> <b>deposits</b> on the CLP originate mainly from the Gobi desert in southern Mongolia and the sandy deserts in northern China (primarily the Badain Juran and Tengger deserts), rather than from the Taklimakan desert in western China, at least during the last climatic cycle. The dominant source of fine-grained dust varied significantly, from southern Mongolia during cold periods, to northern China during warm periods. The glacial-interglacial provenance fluctuations are strongly coupled with changes in the intensity of the near-surface northwesterly winter monsoon. <br/...|$|R
40|$|Dust {{raising and}} {{transport}} are common and important processes in Australia today. The aridity of the Australian continent and high climatic variability result in widespread dust raising in the arid and semi-arid areas and transport to the humid margins and surrounding oceans. The supply of erodible particles {{appears to be}} the greatest limitation on total flux of transported dust. Dust raising is greatest in the Lake Eyre Basin, including the Simpson Desert, and Murray-Darling Basin where internal drainage renews supplies of fine particles to the arid zone. In the west and northwest dust entrainment is low, despite considerable aridity. The marine record of dust flux shows at least a threefold increase in dust flux, compared with the Holocene, in the last glacial maximum in both tropical and temperate Australia, driven by weakened Australian monsoon rains and drier westerly circulation, respectively. Despite the widespread confirmation of aeolian <b>dust</b> <b>deposits</b> in southeastern and southwestern Australia, dated or quantified records are extremely rare. The dominant model of Australian <b>dust</b> <b>deposits,</b> the clay-rich ‘parna’, is shown to be poorly substantiated while modern and ancient <b>dust</b> <b>deposits</b> examined in detail are shown to bear a strong similarity to conventional definitions of loess. 29 page(s...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the pass through {{of the change}} in policy interest rate of the central bank of Pakistan to market interest rates. The market rates examined include KIBOR, six month <b>deposit</b> <b>rate</b> and weighted average lending rate. More or less complete pass-through {{of the change in}} policy rate to KIBOR is observed within one month. However, the magnitude of change in policy <b>rate</b> to <b>deposit</b> and lending <b>rate</b> is not only low but is slow as well. The pass-through to the weighted average lending rate is 47 percent and occurs with a lag of one to one and half year. The pass-through to the <b>deposit</b> <b>rate</b> is only 16 percent and occurs with a lag of one year. The asymmetry between the magnitude of pass-through to lending and <b>deposit</b> <b>rates</b> has served to increase the interest margin of the banks. The slow pass-through to the lending and <b>deposit</b> <b>rate</b> put limits on the effectiveness of interest rate as a policy tool. The pass-through, and hence the effectiveness of monetary policy will increase if all the lending and <b>deposit</b> <b>rates</b> are floating in nature and are quoted as KIBOR-plus and KIBOR-minus respectively. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{origin and}} {{evolution}} of two major eolian deposits of the Martian north polar region, the layered deposits and the debris mantle, are examined. Both apparently result from deposition of dust along with the seasonal CO 2 frost cap. <b>Dust</b> <b>deposited</b> onto the perennial ice is incorporated into the layered <b>deposits,</b> while <b>dust</b> <b>deposited</b> directly onto the surface {{becomes part of the}} debris mantle. Climatically induced fluctuation of the perennial ice margin has influenced the evolution of both units. Periodic exposure to the atmosphere has allowed erosion of curvilinear troughs in the surface of the layered deposits. Intervening periods of deposition may have resulted in gradual poleward migration of the trough forms, leaving behind sets of low-amplitude surface undulations in former trough locations. Advance and retreat of the perennial ice margin has also probably resulted in a fine interfingering of the layered deposits-debris mantle contract.
