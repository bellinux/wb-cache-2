5|$|The line started {{construction}} in 1884, and rapid transit {{service on the}} line started on February 23, 1886. Passenger service ended on March 31, 1953, and <b>freight</b> <b>service</b> ended by 1989. In 2005, <b>freight</b> <b>service</b> on the western portion of the line was reactivated, and there are proposals to reactivate the former passenger line for rail or bus service.|$|E
5|$|Alternate plans {{included}} constructing {{two sets}} of two tubes, one for commuter and <b>freight</b> <b>service</b> from the LIRR {{and the other for}} rapid transit, or two tunnels each with individual tubes for freight and subway service. The <b>freight</b> <b>service</b> would have occurred during off-peak hours only, but simultaneous with subway service, with passenger trains running in 30-minute or one-hour headways during these times. A 1912 proposal had freight running at night between 1 a.m. and 5 a.m., while the 1925 plans called for joint freight and passenger service during early mornings (5 a.m. to 6 a.m.), middays (10 a.m. to 4 p.m.), and overnights (8 p.m. to 5 a.m.).|$|E
5|$|Freight {{services}} {{to and from}} the steelworks at Ebbw Vale continued until the site closed on 5 July 2002. The final <b>freight</b> <b>service</b> to run from the Corus steelworks in Ebbw Vale in 2003 removed scrap metal from site.|$|E
50|$|Like the MPDs {{these units}} were also {{suitable}} for working <b>freight</b> <b>services</b> and regularly {{appeared on the}} CIÉ <b>freight</b> <b>services</b> to and from Londonderry.|$|R
50|$|From late 2016, 201 Class {{locomotives}} {{will operate}} increased <b>freight</b> <b>services</b> as {{the weight and}} length of some <b>freight</b> <b>services</b> will be increased due to customer demand.|$|R
50|$|In {{their early}} years the {{locomotives}} hauled express trains (later known as InterCity) and heavy <b>freight</b> <b>services,</b> {{but in their}} later years they were transferred to smaller regional and light <b>freight</b> <b>services.</b>|$|R
5|$|In 1925, however—the year bids from {{contractors}} were to {{be entertained}} by the city—the project was halted and the project's engineering staff laid off. Officially, the plan was delayed {{due to lack of}} funding, but Hylan and New York City Board of Transportation (BOT) Chairman John Delaney also wanted to secure <b>freight</b> <b>service</b> for the tunnel. The status of the tunnel as mixed-use created tension and deadlock between Hylan, Delaney and the New York State Transit Commission; the latter emphasized passenger service for the tunnel. After an investigation issued by Governor Al Smith, planners eliminated <b>freight</b> <b>service</b> from the plan, as per the Nicoll-Hofstadter Act signed into law by the governor; this then led to lack of interest from contractors.|$|E
5|$|Train {{services}} {{on the line}} are provided by Southeastern, and are mostly operated by Class 375 Electrostar, or occasionally Class 465/466 Networker units. The line still sees a <b>freight</b> <b>service</b> to and from British Gypsum's sidings at Mountfield.|$|E
5|$|JAL Cargo is {{the brand}} {{of the airline}} group's <b>freight</b> <b>service</b> {{and is a member}} of the WOW cargo {{alliance}} with the following products, J Speed, General Cargo and Dangerous Goods. In the fiscal year ended 31 March 2009, the Cargo division carried 500,779 tonnes of freight domestically and 627,213 tonnes of freight internationally.|$|E
50|$|Air freight {{is limited}} in South Australia, with {{only a small number}} of major regular <b>freight</b> <b>services.</b> Some minor intrastate air <b>freight</b> <b>services</b> are {{provided}} by smaller jets and turboprop aircraft, especially to outlying areas of the state.|$|R
50|$|Gakunan-Harada Station has {{a single}} island {{platform}} serving two tracks for passenger service. In addition, adjacent multiple tracks are used for container <b>freight</b> <b>services</b> as well as private <b>freight</b> <b>services</b> to the nearby Nippon Daishowa Paperboard Company factories.|$|R
50|$|<b>Freight</b> <b>services</b> ceased in 1965.|$|R
5|$|Passenger {{service was}} {{eliminated}} entirely in 1934. Conrail, the Pennsylvania Railroad's successor, sold the remaining trackage in the 1980s to the Indiana and Ohio Railway, a short line {{now owned by}} RailAmerica. That company continues to provide local <b>freight</b> <b>service</b> on the ex-CL, and the Lebanon Mason Monroe Railroad operates tourist trains on {{a portion of the}} line near Lebanon.|$|E
5|$|SS Wittekind {{was built}} by Blohm & Voss of Hamburg for North German Lloyd’s Roland Line, which was a {{fortnightly}} steerage and <b>freight</b> <b>service</b> from Bremen to New York. Launched on 3 February 1894, Wittekind—named for Wittekind (c. 730–808), the Duke of Saxony—and sister-ship Willehad were the first twin-screw steamers expressly built for North German Lloyd. The new liner sailed on her maiden voyage to Hoboken, New Jersey on 14 April.|$|E
5|$|The station {{burned down}} in 1907 and was rebuilt later that year. The {{rise of the}} {{automobile}} caused the railroad to end passenger service in 1937; by 1959 the station was completely closed and sold off. After closure, it was used {{for a variety of}} businesses, including serving as a public-access television station. <b>Freight</b> <b>service</b> along the Wallkill Valley line continued until 1977, when the corridor was shut to regular rail traffic.|$|E
50|$|<b>Freight</b> <b>services</b> ceased in 1976.|$|R

50|$|<b>Freight</b> <b>services</b> ceased in 1983.|$|R
5|$|Continued drought, road competition, and {{rationalisation}} of intrastate freight {{operations have}} seen this change in recent years, {{with an average of}} only 6.1 million tonnes of intrastate freight carried from each year between 1996 and 1998; and containers now being the major traffic, with residual cement, logs, quarry, and steel trains operating. By the 1990s road transport has captured most general freight traffic, with less than carload traffic was discontinued in July 2007 {{with the end of the}} Fastrack <b>freight</b> <b>service.</b> An exception to the decline is interstate operations, with intermodal container traffic growing due to competition between private operators.|$|E
5|$|During April 1887, J.I. Berry {{established}} {{a site for}} a town after he chose a well-watered section along {{the way of the}} Fort Worth and Denver City Railroad, which had begun building across the Texas Panhandle. Berry and Colorado City, Texas, merchants wanted to make their new town site the region's main trading center. On August 30, 1887, Berry's town site won the county seat election and was established in Potter County. Availability of the railroad and <b>freight</b> <b>service</b> after the county seat election made the town a fast-growing cattle-marketing center.|$|E
5|$|Extending {{the line}} through the Sunnyside Yard and onto the LIRR Montauk Branch, running {{directly}} to the lower level of the Archer Avenue Line in Jamaica. The Montauk Branch in Queens is currently used for <b>freight</b> <b>service,</b> last seeing passenger service in 1998, {{and would have been}} rebuilt and electrified. The Montauk line would merge with the BMT Jamaica elevated at Lefferts Boulevard just west of 121st Street, using the BMT approach to the Archer Avenue subway. The Jamaica El would truncated to Crescent Street in Brooklyn and replaced by bus service. New stations would be built at Thomson Avenue within the Sunnyside Yard, and at Fresh Pond Road (the site of the former Fresh Pond station) and Woodhaven Boulevard (at the former Ridgewood station site) along the Montauk Branch. The now-closed Richmond Hill station on the Montauk Branch would be renovated and lengthened for subway service. The LIRR would have exclusive use of the tracks during overnight hours for <b>freight</b> <b>service.</b> This $594 million option would be open by 1997, but people living around the Montauk Branch opposed the proposal due to fears of increased traffic and danger from the Montauk Branch's multiple grade crossings, though plans called for new overpasses and access roads to eliminate these crossings.|$|E

5|$|The {{company was}} granted a 20-year charter on March 18, 1840, by the Maryland {{legislature}} and then acquired three of the former Maryland & Virginia's steamboats: Pocahontas, Georgia, and Jewess. The company began overnight paddlewheel steamship passenger and <b>freight</b> <b>service</b> daily except Sundays between Baltimore and Norfolk. By 1848, the company's steamship Herald was making the trip in less than 12hours, a time which the line would maintain until the end in 1962. An affiliate, the Powhatan Line, started service between Norfolk and Richmond in 1845, interchanging freight and passengers with the Old Bay Line.|$|E
5|$|A {{series of}} {{derailments}} {{in the mid-1970s}} shattered Amtrak's confidence in the locomotive, and many railroads banned it from their tracks. Multiple investigations pointed to issues with the locomotive's trucks, {{the weight of the}} water and steam generators used for train heating, or the vibration of baggage cars behind the locomotive. In 1977 Amtrak decided to move on from the SDP40F in favor of the EMD F40PH, which was already in use on short-distance routes. Amtrak traded most of its fleet into EMD; the components were incorporated into new F40PHs. The remainder were traded to the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway (ATSF) for use in <b>freight</b> <b>service.</b> The Santa Fe rebuilt the locomotives and designated them SDF40-2. The Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway (BNSF), successor to the Santa Fe, retired them in 2002.|$|E
5|$|Teaneck {{is split}} {{east and west}} by {{railroad}} tracks, which currently provide <b>freight</b> <b>service</b> by CSX Transportation. Until 1959, passenger train service was provided on these same tracks by the West Shore Railroad, with Teaneck stations at Cedar Lane and West Englewood Avenue. Commuter service was available from these stations, with 44 passenger trains operating daily to and from Weehawken, where Hudson River ferry service was available to New York City at 42nd Street and at the Financial District in Lower Manhattan. Train service from Teaneck was also available north to Albany, along the west shore of the river. Efforts are ongoing to restore some passenger train service on this line for commuters heading toward New York City, including extension of the Hudson-Bergen Light Rail service via the Northern Branch to Englewood or Tenafly.|$|E
50|$|<b>Freight</b> <b>services</b> {{continued}} until 1980.|$|R
50|$|The {{steadily}} {{growth of}} long-distance, suburban and <b>freight</b> <b>services</b> made necessary the radical {{transformation of the}} Spandau railway between 1905 and 1912. It was also necessary to relocate <b>freight</b> <b>services,</b> for which the Berlin railway had become too congested, to outer areas.|$|R
50|$|October 1998: <b>Freight</b> <b>services</b> {{temporarily}} stop.|$|R
5|$|The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 {{mandated}} that all new construction on transit stations including making the stations handicapped accessible. Because the 1885 depot {{is very close}} to the tracks, such upgrades at the old station location would have been difficult. New platforms, with mini-high platforms on their west ends for level boarding, were built just west of the former station. A footbridge with two elevators was built to allow passengers to reach the outbound platform without crossing the tracks, which carry slow-moving CSX <b>freight</b> <b>service</b> as well as MBTA and Amtrak trains. The new station was built in 2000 and opened in early 2001.|$|E
5|$|The first {{plans for}} a line through Numedal were {{launched}} after the Sørland Line reached in Kongsberg in 1871. After {{it was decided that}} the Bergen Line would instead follow Hallingdal, the Numedal plans lay dead until it was decided that a railway was necessary to build two hydroelectric power stations near Rødberg. The plans were passed in 1918, the first trains started running in 1924 and the line was officially opened in 1927. At first all services were provided with steam locomotives, but from the 1930s diesel multiple units were used for passenger trains. The line was frequented with classes Cmd 16, 86, 87 and 91. The last regular train ran in 1988; since, there has been sporadic <b>freight</b> <b>service</b> and some heritage trains running from Kongsberg to Rollag. Draisine rental is available on the section from Veggli to Rødberg.|$|E
5|$|The station depot {{remained}} in {{use by the}} Erie until October 1960, when that was folded into the Erie-Lackawanna Railroad, which itself would fold in April 1976, as it was absorbed into the Consolidated Rail Corporation (Conrail). Conrail maintained passenger services until 1983, when that job {{was taken over by}} Metro-North Railroad. On April 18, 1983, the last passenger train left the Harriman station, as Conrail and Metro-North abandoned the tracks in favor of using the Graham Line (a high-speed freight line) for passenger and <b>freight</b> <b>service.</b> At that time, a new park & ride off of New York State Route 17 in Harriman opened for the newly realigned passenger service along the ex-Graham Line.|$|E
25|$|The Bureau of Aeronautics and <b>Freight</b> <b>Services</b> {{carries out}} the {{enforcement}} of the Commission's rules. It has three divisions: Airports Division, Aviation <b>Services,</b> and <b>Freight</b> <b>Services.</b> The bureau, along with the Passenger Transportation Bureau, was formed out of the Multi-Modal Transportation Services Bureau in 2006.|$|R
50|$|On April 1st, 2016, Catalina Express and Harley Marine began {{operating}} a new sister company, Avalon <b>Freight</b> <b>Services</b> from the Catalina Sea and Air terminal in San Pedro. Avalon <b>Freight</b> <b>Services</b> operates self-propelled landing craft named Catalina Provider, and a rebuilt tug named Lucy Franco.|$|R
50|$|<b>Freight</b> <b>services</b> ceased between 1980 and 1982.|$|R
