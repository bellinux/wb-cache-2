A distribution coefficient (K d) at different trace elements for pH value of 4 and at different pH was calculated experimentally. Also the K d of strontium at different shaking times was calculated. Stability of inorganic <b>ion</b> <b>exchanger</b> at different pH was investigated too. The results show that ZrP is almost stability in acid medium, especially with the lower molarity. Also titration shows a that it has high ability of displacement of ions previously attached and loosely incorporated into its structure by oppositely charged ions present in the surrounding solution. In pH value of 4, ZrP is an useful inorganic <b>ion</b> <b>exchanger</b> and shows a high affinity for some elements such as Cs and Sr. The degree of ionization of ZrP depends on acid strength of solution.
