You seem to dread {{the prevalence of}} Paine's opinions (which in most parts I detest {{as much as you}} do) while I am much more afraid of the total annihilation of all principles of liberty and resistance, an event which <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> would be as sorry to see as I. We both hate the two extremes equally, but we differ in opinions with respect to the quarter from which the danger is most pressing.|$|E

On the American launch party in New York on the 12th of October 2011 Jay-Z came to show his support and stated to the reporter that he was [...] "a little bit Norwegian, as <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> know".|$|E

"I {{learn that}} the park {{commission}} are seriously thinking of a building at Minnehaha {{for the express purpose}} of taking photographs—on the site heretofore profaned by a shanty for that purpose. I cannot remain silent in view of this proposed vandalism which <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> cannot sanction—and which I am equally sure will forever be a stigma upon Minneapolis and elicit the anathema of every man of sense and taste who visits the place. If erected it will simply be pandering to the tastes of the army of boobies who think to boost themselves into notoriety by connecting their own stupid features with the representation of one of the most beautiful of God’s works.” ...|$|E

500|$|On {{his return}} to St. James's Palace, Churchill's {{attention}} was drawn towards other matters, and to a fresh face at court. [...] "I beg you will let me see you {{as often as you}} can", pleaded Churchill in a letter to Sarah Jennings, [...] "which <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> ought to do if you care for my love..." [...] Sarah Jennings' social origins were in many ways similar to Churchill's – minor gentry blighted by debt-induced poverty. After her father's death when she was eight, Sarah, together with her mother and sisters, moved to London. As Royalist supporters (despite the fact that Sarah's great uncle, James Temple, was convicted of regicide), the Jennings' loyalty to the crown, like the Churchill's, was repaid with court employment, and in 1673 Sarah followed her sister Frances into the household of the Duchess of York, Mary of Modena, second wife to James, Duke of York.|$|E
500|$|However, {{despite these}} {{occasional}} supply ships, the French garrison was rapidly {{running out of}} food. To conserve resources, the French forced the civilian population out of the city; the civilian population dropped from 45,000 in 1799 to 9,000 by 1800. Nelson himself took nominal command of the blockade, while Ball was made president of the Maltese National Congress. As liaison between the Maltese military and civilian commanders, he directed the distribution of supplies to the Maltese population, which was beginning to suffer from disease brought about by food shortages. He was replaced on Alexander by his first lieutenant, William Harrington. On 1 November Nelson again offered terms of surrender to Vaubois, and was again rebuffed, with the reply [...] "Jaloux de mériter l'estime de votre nation, comme vous recherchez celle de la nôtre, nous sommes résolus défendre cette fortresse jusqu'à l'extrémité" [...] ("Keen to deserve the esteem your nation, as you seek that of ours, we are resolved to defend this fortress until the end"). By this point, Nelson was conducting the blockade at a distance, based at the Neapolitan court in Palermo. There he indulged in gambling and social engagements, becoming {{closer and closer to}} Emma, Lady Hamilton, wife of the ambassador Sir William Hamilton. His behaviour was heavily criticised, not just by his commanding officer Vice-Admiral Lord Keith, who had recently replaced Earl St Vincent, but also by old friends such as Thomas Troubridge, who wrote to him [...] "If you knew what your friends feel for you <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> would cut out all the nocturnal parties [...] [...] [...] I beseech your Lordship, leave off". In December 1799, Erskine was replaced by Lieutenant-General Henry Edward Fox, who immediately redistributed 800 troops from the garrison at Messina to Malta under Brigadier-General Thomas Graham. These troops filled the gap left by the withdrawal of Portuguese forces, which had been ordered to return to Lisbon. Disease began to spread within the city as rations became scarcer. The arrival of an aviso in January 1800 with the news of the events of 18 Brumaire that made Bonaparte First Consul of France prompted a brief respite and a public statement from Vaubois that the city would never be surrendered, although conditions continued to deteriorate.|$|E

2500|$|I am {{well aware}} that American {{enterprise}} has made available reprints of the official papers relating to the present European war; but the original British prints of these publications may not be accessible to those persons of influence who would study them for a true history of the conflict.

2500|$|Again he {{discussed}} his ideas, and she subsequently wrote telling him of her [...] "fear that our {{opinions on the}} most important subject should differ widely. My reason tells me that honest & conscientious doubts cannot be a sin, but I feel it would be a painful void between us. I thank you from my heart for your openness with me & I should dread the feeling that you were concealing your opinions from the fear of giving me pain." [...] She continued; [...] "my own dear Charley we now do belong to each other & I cannot help being open with you. Will you do me a favour? yes <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> will, it is to read our Saviours farewell discourse to his disciples which begins {{at the end of the}} 13th Chap of John. It is so full of love to them & devotion & every beautiful feeling." [...] In the Farewell Discourse from the Gospel of St. John, Jesus instructs his disciples to [...] "love one another", a central part of Christian doctrine which emphasises the need for belief. For Emma the importance of faith had been reinforced by the death of her sister Fanny in 1832, and her need to meet Fanny again in the afterlife. She clearly felt that Darwin would be able to overcome doubt and believe. John 15 also says [...] "If a man abide not in me...they are burned". Darwin's warm reply reassured her, and she replied that [...] "To see you in earnest on the subject will be my greatest comfort & that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> are. I believe I agree with every word you say, & it pleased me that you shd have felt inclined to enter a little more on the subject." [...] However, this tension would remain.|$|E
2500|$|Coles ran for {{governor}} in the election of 1822. To his great surprise, he won the election by a very tight margin, defeating Chief Justice Joseph Philips (an ally of Judge Jesse Thomas and prominent slavery advocate {{in his own right}} who eventually returned to Kentucky), Associate Justice Thomas C. Browne(the eventual candidate of the Ninian Edwards faction) and militia commander James B. Moore. Coles had left Illinois on election day believing he had lost, and received the news of his victory while in Virginia recovering from bilious fever. He accordingly cleared up his land office accounts in Washington, D.C. and returned to Illinois. Madison sent him a package containing a pedometer, and a note, [...] "As you are about to assume new motives to walk in a straight path, and with measured steps, I wish you to accept the little article enclosed, as a type of the course <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> will pursue, and as a token of the affection I have so long cherished for you." ...|$|E

2500|$|His use of {{real-time}} rendered cinematics (not prerendered video) {{serves both}} his own rapidly interactive development process with no rendering delays, and the player's {{interaction with the}} game's continuity. He prefers to change his games right until they are finalized, and to make [...] "something unique and unprecedented". He prefers the game to be interactively fun rather than have elaborate film sequences, stating in 1999, [...] "I will never make movie-like games"; therefore, the more than 90 total minutes of short cutscenes interspersed throughout Ocarina of Time deliver more interactive cinematic qualities. His vision mandates a rapid and malleable development process with small teams, as when he directed substantial changes to the overall game scenario in the final months {{of the development of}} Ocarina of Time. He said, [...] "The reason behind using such a simple process, as <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> have all experienced in the workshop, {{is that there is a}} total limit on team energy. There is a limit to the work a team can do, and there is a limit to my own energy. We opted not to use that limited time and energy on pre-rendered images for use in cinema scenes, but rather on tests on other inter-active elements and polishing up the game".|$|E
2500|$|Having {{decided to}} marry, Darwin visited his cousin Emma on 29 July 1838 {{and told her}} of his ideas on transmutation. On 11 November he {{returned}} and proposed to Emma. Again he discussed his ideas, and about ten days later she wrote, [...] "When I am with you I think all melancholy thoughts keep {{out of my head}} but since you are gone some sad ones have forced themselves in, of fear that our opinions on the most important subject should differ widely. My reason tells me that honest & conscientious doubts cannot be a sin, but I feel it would be a painful void between us. I thank you from my heart for your openness with me & I should dread the feeling that you were concealing your opinions from the fear of giving me pain. It is perhaps foolish of me to say this much but my own dear Charley we now do belong to each other & I cannot help being open with you. Will you do me a favour? yes <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> will, it is to read our Saviours farewell discourse to his disciples which begins {{at the end of the}} 13th Chap of John. It is so full of love to them & devotion & every beautiful feeling. It is the part of the New Testament I love best.
