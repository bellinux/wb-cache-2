40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{studies the}} Jewish {{community of the}} Algerian M’zab during the French colonization of the Sahara from 1882 until 1962. French officials refused to extend the 1870 Crémieux Decree that emancipated Algerian Jews to the M’zab after its 1882 annexation. French administrators saw the M’zabi Jews as insurmountably different and consequently excluded them from emancipation. Despite petitions from the community and French and Algerian Jewish advocacy for extending emancipation to the south, successive French colonial and metropolitan governments declined to <b>extend</b> the Crémieux <b>Decree</b> to the M’zab. French officials justified this decision by invoking the insurmountable difference of M’zabi Jews, who were both too Jewish and too similar to Algerian Muslims to be “regenerated” as French citizens. 	Within the colonial legal system, M’zabi Jews were classified as “indigènes,” or natives, alongside Algerian Muslims. M’zabi Jews faced the restrictions that bounded the lives of Muslims in French Algeria and settler antisemitism that culminated in the Vichy abrogation of the Crémieux Decree in 1940. When Free French forces reinstated the Crémieux Decree in 1943, the French again excluded the M’zabi Jews. Following this, a number of individuals and families from the community left Algeria to join the growing Jewish community in British mandatory Palestine. 	M’zabi Jews were the only organized Jewish community who left Algeria for Israel. Their history challenges historiography that claims Zionism was unsuccessful in Algeria. M’zabi Jews were not ardent Zionists, but they did {{take advantage of the}} opportunities for emigration made possible by international Zionist organizations including the American Joint Distribution Committee and the Jewish Agency. In contrast to the larger history of Algerian Jews, the history of the M’zabi Jewish immigration from Algeria to Israel is part of the larger history of Jewish migrations from the Arab world to Israel after 1945. M’zabi Jews won full French citizenship in late 1961, but most still opted to make their way to Israel rather than France...|$|R
40|$|Après avoir fait un rappel historique des circonstances qui ont entouré l'instauration des régimes de {{conventions}} collectives étendues dans les trois pays considérés, l'auteur procède à une étude comparative des législations en ce domaine. Il considère les dispositions relatives aux conventions susceptibles d'extension, à la procédure d'extension, aux effets de l'extension et à l'application des conventions étendues. Il accorde une attention particulière à certains aspects de la législation québécoise en cette matière. INTRODUCTIONThe {{extension of}} a collective agreement is a {{process by which the}} field of application of an agreement can be extended to all employers and all workers in the professional and territorial field of application of the agreement, even if they are not parties to that agreement. Regarding the kind of organizations having the right to extend such agreements we might identify two categories of countries : those where the extension is granted by the political executive (v. g. France and quebec) and those extending agreements by way of appeal to arbitration boards or judicial tribunals (v. g. Great Britain and other countries members of the Commonwealth). However the categories are different if we compare the result of the extension with the original agreements. In France and Great Britain the extended agreements seem to have a real continuity with the private collective agreements in force in those countries. However in the Province of quebec both regimes are developing in a parallel direction and one does not necessarily see continuity between the two types of agreements. This is what we will look into. SOME HISTORYThe economic crisis of the thirties brought the three countries considered in this paper to the passing of laws favorising the extension of collective agreements :quebec and Great Britain — 1934 Other Canadian Provinces — 1935 - 1939 France — 1936 Since then all laws have been either amended, or replaced by other. We now find in Great Britain the « Terms and Conditions of Employment Act » of 1959, in France « La loi du 11 février 1950 (Code du travail, Livre I, art. 31 à 31 zc)  » and in Quebec the « Collective Agreement Decrees Act » (R. S. Q., 1964, chap. 143). The similarity existing between the different Canadian laws of extension other than Quebec to study, as example, only one case, Ontario in her « Industrial Standards Act » (R. S. P., 1960, Chap. 186 as amended by 1964, chap. 46). THE AGREEMENTS SUBJECTED TO EXTENSIONThe considerable importance taken by an extended agreement explains why all laws studied hereby include provisions establishing precise conditions thus reserving the right of extension to a few number of agreements only. a) In France the agreement must have been concluded by the most representative labor organizations in the country. The criteria establishing the representative character of those organizations are defined by the law. 1. —These arguments must in principle have been concluded within a joint commission formed by the minister ; 2. —They must be in a definite sector of the economic activity and cover all professional categories ; 3. —They must be national, regional or local; « les accords d'établissement » and wage agreements are not subjected to extension ; 4. —They must include a few compulsory provisions. b) The British law is not as precise as the French one on this point. 1. —The parties to the agreement must be representative of the employers and of the workers included in the industry or the trade covered by the agreement. The law however does not define what is to be held as representative ; 2. —An agreement may cover a whole industry or only part of it ; 3. —It can be national or district wide ; 4. —Finally there are no compulsory provisions. c) In the Province of Quebec, at least in theory, all agreements can be extended provided for the minister believes « the provisions of the agreement have a preponderant significance and importance for the establishing of condition of labour, without serious inconvenience resulting from the competition of outside countries or the other provinces » (sec. 6). According to the law the minister is free to determine the criteria of measure of the preponderant significance and importance. Also according to the law, the parties are free to determine the professionnal and territorial field application. There are no compulsory provisions and only a few provisions are susceptible of extension. d) We find in Ontario a quite different system : even if the process resembles what exists elsewhere, one might hesitate to call it extension of collective agreements. I think it would rather be a way of establishing working conditions by means of reglementation to which parties are invited to participate. In fact, the minister invites the parties himself and determine the field of application of the schedule. In addition to all this the number of provisions is very limited and is established by the law. However the terms of the agreement must be accepted « by a proper and sufficient representation of employers and employees » (sec. 8 (2)). THE EXTENSION PROCESSThe extension is never automatic. Different kind of mecanisms have been installed {{in order to protect the}} parties that will be covered by the extended agreement. a) In France the minister may begin the extension process though the parties usually do it. A notice is published in an official paper and any observation must be made within two weeks. The minister must consult the Superior Commission of Collective Agreements but he is free to do what he wants after that consultation. The minister has the power to decide the granting or the refusal of the extension but he cannot alter the content of the agreement. b) The British conception of the collective agreement is quite different. For the process to begin, an employer must have omitted or refused to apply the recognized terms and conditions. The labor will then lodge a complaint to the minister who will delegate the Industrial Relations Department to try to reach a settlement. If the latter does not succeed, the Industrial Court will hear the case and will make an award by which the employer will be forced to apply the recognized terms and conditions to the workers of the same trade as the complainant. c) In quebec any party to the agreement may apply for the extension {{of a collective}} agreement. The document is then published in the Official Gazette, in a newspaper published in the French language and in a newspaper published in English language. Any objection must then be made within thirty days. The final decision belongs to the minister who may, if he wants, modify the content of the agreement. However modifications are rarely made but when it happens the parties are consulted. d) In Ontario, when the agreement is presented to the minister by the parties, the former may ask for an inquiry to know whether he must modify the agreement or not. EFFECTS OF THE EXTENSIONEverywhere the extended agreements come into force after their publication in an official paper. Usually they expire in the same time as the original agreement. However in France and in quebec the minister has the power to repeal the extension in any circumstances. In quebec the minister may <b>extend</b> the <b>decree</b> while negotiations are underway before a new contract is signed. THE APPLICATION OF AN EXTENDED COLLECTIVE AGREEMENTBesides Great Britain where disobediance to the conditions prevailing in the sentence may bring a worker to engage in civil suit; the application of extended collective agreements is usually controlled by administrative organizations with special power granted by the legislator. In France a system of inspection provides any qualified inspector with the sufficient power to apply the law. Penal sanctions are predicted. While Ontario controls the system by means of a service of inspection (Department of Labour) the quebec law gives that responsibility to the parties by allowing the establishment of parity committees with strong powers in matters such as inspection and appeal to tribunals and sometimes in the administration of private social security fund, professional training and the control of the degree of qualification of the workers. By this last right, the committee has the possibility, at least in theory, to control the number of workers to be admitted in some categories of occupations on the labor market. It also brings up difficulties in the recognition of competence cards produced by other committees. CONCLUSIONEven if a certain continuity seems to exist between the ordinary collective agreement system and the extended collective agreement regime in Great Britain and France, it is quite different in quebec where private agreements are usually negotiated by certified unions for relatively small units (firm, manufacture or department) while the negotiations of agreements <b>extended</b> in <b>decrees</b> necessitates the formation of employer and union associations. This situation forces the parties to the decree to use a different way of concluding an agreement in such a matter that both systems co-exist in a parallel way. Is it necessary to reduce this gap...|$|R

Elegemos como objeto de estudo o Programa Nacional de IntegraÃÃo da EducaÃÃo Profissional com a EducaÃÃo BÃsica na Modalidade de EducaÃÃo de Jovens e Adultos no IFCE- campus Fortaleza. O PROEJA, como Ã mais conhecido, foi instituÃdo no primeiro Governo do presidente Luiz InÃcio Lula da Silva (2003 - 2006) atravÃs do decreto 5478 / 2005, tendo sido ampliado pelo decreto 5840 / 2006 de modo a atender tambÃm a alunos do ensino fundamental.

Trata-se de uma pesquisa de natureza qualitativa, tendo como abordagem o Estudo de Caso, usando procedimentos como: anÃlise documental, anÃlise bibliogrÃfica, entrevistas e questionÃrios. Apresenta-se inicialmente como aporte teÃrico a ontologia marxiana, momento em que se constitui um debate mais denso no campo das relaÃÃes trabalho e produÃÃo no sistema capitalista, tentando fazer uma correlaÃÃo com o percurso histÃrico da EducaÃÃo de Jovens e Adultos no Ãmbito internacional e nacional. Na sequÃncia, apoiando-se no referencial teÃrico-metodolÃgico do pensamento de Haddad e Di Pierro (2000) fundamenta-se o processo histÃrico da EducaÃÃo de Jovens e Adultos, o que nos ofereceu subsÃdios para compreendermos as relaÃÃes histÃricas oriundas de um projeto de resgate do processo educativo deste nÃvel. Outro ponto importante no que diz respeito ao aporte teÃrico Ã o debate conceitual sobre educaÃÃo permanentem que trouxemos Ã cena Edgar Fourie (1970), comparando com os debates existentes no Brasil. Ã guisa de consideraÃÃes, diante do resultado trazido pela pesquisa, advogamos que a escolarizaÃÃo bÃsica como via de habituaÃÃo do trabalhador, e de forma particular o PROEJA tÃm uma relevante influencia na relaÃÃo do processo de educaÃÃo de jovens e adultos. Contudo, vale ressaltar que no contexto histÃrico ao trabalhador pobre, desqualificado, o Programa {{assume a}} forma apenas de ascensÃo social com condiÃÃes de possibilitar acesso aos bens de consumo que o capital produz. Todavia, urge a necessidade de se repensar a execuÃÃo do Programa de modo a possibilitar seu alinhamento com as orientaÃÃes previstas em seu documento norteador, gerando efetivamente condiÃÃes para a realizaÃÃo de uma aÃÃo educativa voltada a emancipaÃÃo humana e nÃo sÃ a reproduÃÃo das relaÃÃes de produÃÃo capitalistas.

This program as the base document that guides its implementation, intended to rescue and reintegrate millions of youth and adults into the Brazilian school system, allowing them access to professional education in the perspective of a full training. This is a qualitative research, and having as the Case of Study approach, taking procedures such as documental analysis, literature reviews, interviews and questionnaires. It presents initially as a theoretical Marxian ontology, when the denser debate is in the field of labor relations and production in the capitalist system, trying to make a correlation with the historical background of Youth and Adults at the international and national fields. Further, relying on the theoretical and methodological thinking of Haddad and Di Pierro (2000) is based on the historical process of Education for Youth and Adults, which offered subsidies {{in order to understand the}} historical relationships derived from a rescued project from the educational process at this level. Another important point with regard to the theoretical framework is the conceptual debate on permanent education we brought to the scene from Edgar Fourie (1970), comparing with the existing debates in Brazil. By way of considerations, through the results brought forth by research, we advocate that the basic education as a means of habituation of the worker, and the particular form, PROEJA has a significant influence on the relationship of the education process of young people and adults. However, it is noteworthy that in the historical context to the poor, disqualified working people, the program takes the form only for social conditions to facilitate the access to the goods consumers that the capital produces. However, there is an urgent need to rethink the implementation of the program to enable its alignment with the guidelines set forth in its guiding document, effectively creating conditions for the realization of an educational activity aimed at human emancipation, not just the reproduction of relations of the capitalists productions...|$|R
