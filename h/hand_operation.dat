5|$|TCDD was {{classified}} in 1997 by the International Agency for Research on Cancer as a carcinogen for humans (group 1). In the occupational cohort studies {{available for the}} classification, the risk, even at very high exposures, was weak and borderline detectable. Therefore, human data were not deemed sufficient, and the classification was, in essence, based on animal experiments and mechanistic considerations. This has been criticized as a deviation from IARC classification rules. It is much debated whether TCDD is carcinogenic only at high doses which also cause toxic damage of tissues. Moreover, a recent review concludes that, after 1997, further studies do not support an association between TCDD exposure and cancer risk. New studies include the update of Vietnam veteran studies from Ranch <b>Hand</b> <b>operation,</b> which concluded that after 30 years the results do not provide evidence of disease.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{addressing}} the mobility problems {{introduced by the}} previous model, the final production version of the Panzer IV—the Ausf.J—was considered a retrograde from the Ausf.H. Born of necessity, to replace heavy losses, it was greatly simplified to speed production. The electric generator that powered the tank's turret traverse was removed, so the turret had to be rotated manually. The turret traversing mechanism was modified and fitted with a second gear which made hand-operation easier when the vehicle was on sloping terrain. On reasonably level ground, <b>hand</b> <b>operation</b> at 4 seconds to traverse to 12.5° and 29.5 seconds to traverse to 120° was achieved. The resulting space was later used for the installation of an auxiliary [...] fuel tank; road range was thereby increased to , The remaining pistol and vision ports on the turret side hatches were removed, and the engine's radiator housing was simplified by changing the slanted sides to straight sides. Three sockets with screw threads for mounting a 2-ton jib boom crane were welded on the turret roof while the hull roof was thickened from [...] to [...] In addition, the cylindrical muffler was replaced by two flame-suppressing mufflers. On June 1944 Wa Prüf 6 had decided that because bomb damage at Panzerfirma Krupp in Essen had seriously jeopardized tank production, all plates which should have been face-hardened for the Panzer IV were instead made with rolled homogeneous armour plate. By late 1944, Zimmerit was no longer being applied to German armored vehicles, and the Panzer IV's side-skirts {{had been replaced by}} wire mesh, while the gunner's forward vision port in the turret front was eliminated and the number of return rollers was reduced from four to three to further speed-up production.|$|E

5000|$|Prior {{to their}} next album, Ninety Pound Wuss would undergo another member change with Matt Johnson (Blenderhead, Roadside Monument) {{replacing}} bassist Dale Yob. Shortly after, the band entered Seattle based Avast! Recording Company with producer Steve Kravac, {{known for his}} work with Blink-182, Less Than Jake, MxPx and Youth Brigade. The outcome would be their third effort, Short <b>Hand</b> <b>Operation,</b> released on April 22, 1999. The album marked another drastic shift in the band's music by building on the post-hardcore experimentalism and vivid lyrical imagery of their previous offering, with a noticeable increase in both the keyboard playing of Suffering and the guitar effects of Spalding. These factors helped to further evolve the band's post-punk sound, creating the most dynamic album of their career with songs ranging from the chaotic onslaught of [...] "Torment in Tension" [...] and [...] "What I Am" [...] to widely atmospheric tracks like the synth-laden [...] "It Seems So Far Away" [...] and epic album closer [...] "At the End of It All". Satisfied with the final outcome, Suffering referred to Short <b>Hand</b> <b>Operation</b> as [...] "quite possibly ...the best album I'll ever record." [...] To support the release, Ninety Pound Wuss embarked on another United States tour.|$|E
50|$|Sports {{cars were}} made {{accessible}} to drivers with limited physical capabilities by equipping the cars {{with the necessary}} components to convert manual transmission vehicles to <b>hand</b> <b>operation.</b> This was achieved by transferring the clutch control to a small lever located on the gear shift knob; the brake control to a lever {{to the right of}} the lower portion of the steering wheel; and the gas control to an accelerator “ring” which was situated either in front of or behind the steering wheel.

50|$|Double-Gate: Have two opposed {{overlapping}} gates at {{the opening}} which prevent a rope or anchor from inadvertently passing through the gate in either direction.
