5|$|Galileo's astronomical discoveries and {{investigations}} into the Copernican theory {{have led to a}} lasting legacy which includes the categorisation of the four large moons of Jupiter discovered by <b>Galileo</b> (Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto) as the Galilean moons. Other scientific endeavours and principles are named after <b>Galileo</b> including the <b>Galileo</b> spacecraft, the first spacecraft to enter orbit around Jupiter, the proposed <b>Galileo</b> global satellite navigation system, the transformation between inertial systems in classical mechanics denoted Galilean transformation and the Gal (unit), sometimes known as the <b>Galileo,</b> which is a non-SI unit of acceleration.|$|E
5|$|After its {{discovery}} by Voyager 1, Thebe {{was photographed}} by the Voyager 2 space probe in 1979.

5|$|Dava Sobel {{argues that}} prior to Galileo's 1633 trial and {{judgement}} for heresy, Pope Urban VIII had become preoccupied with court intrigue and problems of state, and began to fear persecution or threats to his own life. In this context, Sobel argues {{that the problem of}} <b>Galileo</b> was presented to the pope by court insiders and enemies of <b>Galileo.</b> Having been accused of weakness in defending the church, Urban reacted against <b>Galileo</b> out of anger and fear.|$|E

5|$|Earlier, Pope Urban VIII had {{personally}} asked <b>Galileo</b> to give arguments {{for and against}} heliocentrism in the book, and {{to be careful not}} to advocate heliocentrism. He made another request, that his own views on the matter be included in Galileo's book. Only the latter of those requests was fulfilled by <b>Galileo.</b>|$|E

40|$|Starting with a {{discussion}} of what I call ‘Koyré’s paradox of conceptual novelty’, I introduce the ideas of Damerow et al. on the establishment of classical mechanics in <b>Galileo’s</b> work. I then argue that although their view on the nature of <b>Galileo’s</b> con-ceptual innovation is convincing, it misses an essential element: <b>Galileo’s</b> use of the experiments described in {{the first day of the}} Two New Sciences. I describe these ex-periments and analyze their function. Central to my analysis is the idea that <b>Galileo’s</b> pendulum experiments serve to secure the reference of his theoretical models in actually occurring cases of free fall. In this way, <b>Galileo’s</b> experiments constitute an essential part of the meaning of the new concepts of classical mechanics. 1. Introduction. Th...|$|R
40|$|This article {{addresses}} {{an aspect}} of <b>Galileo’s</b> thought that has hitherto attracted little attention, that is to say, his philosophy of language. First of all, we try to show that <b>Galileo’s</b> reflections on the ambiguous and conventional nature of verbal language, though not expounded systematically, present interesting analogies with John Locke’s. In addition, we analyse the ontological and epistemological implications of <b>Galileo’s</b> mathematical realism...|$|R
5|$|Fantastic Light and <b>Galileo</b> {{did meet}} at Ascot in the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes, {{for which the}} Aidan O'Brien-trained three-year-old was sent off the 1/2 {{favourite}} ahead of Fantastic Light at 7/2. The race {{was the subject of}} considerable advance publicity, and was portrayed as a clash between the two most powerful forces in European racing; Godolphin, represented by Fantastic Light, and Ballydoyle/Coolmore represented by <b>Galileo.</b> As in the Prince of Wales's Stakes, Dettori settled Fantastic Light in the early stages before moving him out to challenge in the straight. <b>Galileo</b> had already taken the lead but Fantastic Light moved up and went level a furlong out. The two horses raced side-by-side for several strides, but <b>Galileo</b> then pulled ahead to win by two lengths.|$|E
5|$|For {{the next}} decade, <b>Galileo</b> stayed {{well away from}} the controversy. He revived his project of writing a book on the subject, {{encouraged}} by the election of Cardinal Maffeo Barberini as Pope Urban VIII in 1623. Barberini was a friend and admirer of <b>Galileo,</b> and had opposed the condemnation of <b>Galileo</b> in 1616. Galileo's resulting book, Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems, was published in 1632, with formal authorization from the Inquisition and papal permission.|$|E
5|$|<b>Galileo</b> {{initially}} {{named his}} discovery the Cosmica Sidera ("Cosimo's stars"), but the names that eventually prevailed were chosen by Simon Marius.

5|$|In 1623, <b>Galileo</b> {{published}} The Assayer—Il Saggiatore, which attacked theories {{based on}} Aristotle's authority and promoted experimentation and the mathematical formulation of scientific ideas. The book was highly successful and even found {{support among the}} higher echelons of the Christian church. Following the success of The Assayer, <b>Galileo</b> published the Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems (Dialogo sopra i due massimi sistemi del mondo) in 1632. Despite taking care {{to adhere to the}} Inquisition's 1616 instructions, the claims in the book favouring Copernican theory and a non Geocentric model of the solar system led to <b>Galileo</b> being tried and banned on publication. Despite the publication ban, <b>Galileo</b> published his Discourses and Mathematical Demonstrations Relating to Two New Sciences (Discorsi e Dimostrazioni Matematiche, intorno a due nuove scienze) in 1638 in Holland, outside the jurisdiction of the Inquisition.|$|E
5|$|In 2002–2003 <b>Galileo</b> {{spacecraft}} had two {{passes through}} the gossamer rings. During them its dust counter detected dust particles in the size range 0.2–5μm. In addition, the <b>Galileo</b> spacecraft's star scanner detected small, discrete bodies (< 1 km) near Amalthea. These may represent collisional debris generated from impacts with this satellite.|$|E
5|$|On 31 October 1992, Pope John Paul II {{expressed}} {{regret for}} how the <b>Galileo</b> affair was handled, and issued a declaration acknowledging the errors committed by the Catholic Church tribunal that judged the scientific positions of <b>Galileo</b> Galilei, {{as the result of}} a study conducted by the Pontifical Council for Culture. In March 2008, the head of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, Nicola Cabibbo, announced a plan to honour <b>Galileo</b> by erecting a statue of him inside the Vatican walls. In December of the same year, during events to mark the 400th anniversary of Galileo's earliest telescopic observations, Pope Benedict XVI praised his contributions to astronomy. A month later, however, the head of the Pontifical Council for Culture, Gianfranco Ravasi, revealed that the plan to erect a statue of <b>Galileo</b> in the grounds of the Vatican had been suspended.|$|E

5|$|The first {{reported}} observation of Io {{was made by}} <b>Galileo</b> Galilei on 7 January 1610 using a 20x-power, refracting telescope at the University of Padua. However, in that observation, <b>Galileo</b> could not separate Io and Europa due to the low power of his telescope, so the two were recorded as a single point of light. Io and Europa were seen {{for the first time}} as separate bodies during Galileo's observations of the Jovian system the following day, 8 January 1610 (used as the discovery date for Io by the IAU). The discovery of Io and the other Galilean satellites of Jupiter was published in Galileo's Sidereus Nuncius in March 1610. In his Mundus Jovialis, published in 1614, Simon Marius claimed to have discovered Io and the other moons of Jupiter in 1609, one week before Galileo's discovery. <b>Galileo</b> doubted this claim and dismissed the work of Marius as plagiarism. Regardless, Marius' first recorded observation came from 29 December 1609 in the Julian calendar, which equates to 8 January 1610 in the Gregorian calendar, which <b>Galileo</b> used. Given that <b>Galileo</b> published his work before Marius, <b>Galileo</b> is credited with the discovery.|$|E
5|$|The surname Galilei {{derives from}} the given name of an ancestor, <b>Galileo</b> Bonaiuti, a physician, {{university}} teacher and politician who lived in Florence from 1370 to 1450; his descendents had changed their family name from Bonaiuti (or Buonaiuti) to Galilei in his honor in the late 14th century. <b>Galileo</b> Bonaiuti {{was buried in the}} same church, the Basilica of Santa Croce in Florence, where about 200 years later his more famous descendant <b>Galileo</b> Galilei was also buried.|$|E

Since these new stars displayed no detectable diurnal parallax, <b>Galileo</b> concluded that they were distant stars, and, therefore, disproved the Aristotelian belief in the immutability of the heavens.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{helps to}} clarify the role of {{empirical}} evidence in psychological and epistemologiral theories. Following <b>Galileo's</b> idealization, epistemological theories do not describe the behavior of individuals in the real world. It is only when the "impediments " of the;:eal subjects are gradually removed by experimental manipulation that the real performance of individuals can approximate the competence of the ideal epistemic subject. It is concluded that <b>Galileo's</b> method of idealization {{has important implications for}} the construction of the neo-Piagetian epistemological theory. Discussed are <b>Galileo's</b> method of experimental analysis, the role of the epistemic subject in Paiget's genetic epistemology, the relationship between <b>Galileo's</b> ideal laws and Piaget's ideal knower, and the manipulation of the impediment variables.
