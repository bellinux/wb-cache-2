40|$|Grid {{workflow}} management systems automate the orchestration of scientific applications with large computational and data processing needs, but lack control over network resources. Consequently, the management system cannot prevent multiple communication intensive applications {{to compete for}} network resources, which leads to unpredictable performance. Currently, the lack of control over network resources may prevent certain applications, i. e. applications that need high capacity and Quality of Service, to utilize Grids. Hence, such applications would use dedicated infrastructures. Because the costs to build dedicated infrastructures may far exceed the cost of using existing Grids, the Grid needs to support mechanisms to optimize the <b>interworking</b> <b>between</b> <b>networks</b> and applications. In this paper, we present the architecture and proof of concept to control network resources from Grid {{workflow management}} system and to manage network resources from workflow-enabled applications at run-time. Depending on the current network infrastructure capabilities or future advances, applications may employ existing QoS mechanisms or use application-specific ones to provide the desired network service. We believe that our approach leads to performance improvements in communication intensive applications and enables novel Grid applications, which require optimal <b>interworking</b> <b>between</b> <b>networks</b> and applications. © 2010 IEEE...|$|E

The thesis presents an overview of IMS, its purpose, the circumstances and the environment in which it has evolved, and a look into some of the challenges that lie ahead. Through careful examination {{of the history of the}} mobile communications and of IMS itself, the thesis attempts to give the reader a full and comprehendible understanding of what IMS is, what its purpose is, and why it came into existence.

40|$|Abstract—Internet {{telephony}} {{is viewed}} as an emerging technology not only for wireline networks, but also for third generation wireless networks. Although IP end-toend is considered the ultimate approach for future wireless voice services, {{there is still a}} long way to go before IP voice packets can be effectively transported over the air. Therefore, Internet telephony and today’s circuit-switched wireless network will coexist for years to come, and it is essential to effectively perform <b>interworking</b> <b>between</b> these <b>networks.</b> This paper proposes the Unified Mobility Manager (UMM) that achieves efficient <b>interworking</b> <b>between</b> traditional wireless <b>networks</b> and Internettelephony networks. The main characteristic of the UMM is that it combines UMTS HLR and SIP proxy functionality in one logical entity, which helps eliminate the performance degradation due to <b>interworking</b> <b>between</b> SIP and UMTS. This paper identifies seven potential network architectures with and without the UMM and with varying degree of IP penetration in the wireless core networks, and performs comparative analysis in terms of their call setup signaling latency. Our performance results show that for SIP originated calls, the architecture with the UMM can achieve better performance when compared to existing UMTS networks without the UMM. Our results further show that when the backbone network is fully IPenabled, dramatic performance gain can be accomplished with the UMM for PSTN originated calls as well as for SIP originated calls. The paper also demonstrates that the UMM allows for a graceful migration from today’s circuit-switched wireless networks to hybrid SIP/circuitswitched wireless networks, and towards the IMS architecture for all-IP UMTS networks in the future...|$|R

40|$|Providing {{quality of}} service (QoS) in {{large-scale}} networks like the Internet inherently needs to deal with heterogeneous network QoS systems. Therefore, the <b>interworking</b> <b>between</b> different <b>network</b> QoS systems is of high importance. In this paper, the interworking {{with respect to a}} basic characteristic of network QoS systems, the time scale of the system, is under investigation. The time scale of a network QoS system is its speed of reaction to individual requests for differentiated treatment of units of service. A slow time scale system will prefer requests to arrive with a low frequency and persist unaltered for a substantial period of time while a fast one is able to support much higher arrival rates of requests and is thus more amenable for short-lived units of service. Obviously, when overlaying a slow time scale QoS system over a faster one, there is no problem. However, and that is a more likely case, for the overlay of a fast time scale system on a slow one, there is a mismatch to be mediated at the edge between the two. The technique that is applied at an edge device for this mediation is called decoupling of time scales. Decoupling can also be viewed as aggregation of requests in time in contrast to spatial aggregation on the data path. In the paper we develop an adaptive heuristic scheme to deal with decoupling and evaluate this scheme by extensive simulations...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—With the <b>interworking</b> <b>between</b> a {{cellular}} <b>network</b> and wireless local area networks (WLANs), an essential aspect of resource management is {{taking advantage of}} the overlay network structure to efficiently share the multi-service traffic load <b>between</b> the <b>interworked</b> systems. In this study, we propose a new load sharing scheme for voice and elastic data services in {{a cellular}}/WLAN integrated network. Admission control and dynamic vertical handoff are applied to pool the free bandwidths of the two systems to effectively serve elastic data traffic and improve the multiplexing gain. To further combat the cell bandwidth limitation, data calls in the cell are served under an efficient service discipline, referred to as shortest remaining processing time (SRPT) [1]. The SRPT can well exploit the heavy-tailedness of data call size to improve the resource uti-lization. An accurate analytical model is developed to determine an appropriate size threshold so that data calls are properly distributed to the integrated cell and WLAN, taking into account the load conditions and traffic characteristics. It is observed from extensive simulation and numerical analysis that the new scheme significantly improves the overall system performance.
