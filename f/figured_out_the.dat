5|$|Development {{was almost}} {{complete}} with only minor polishing {{to be done}} before the game was to be released in 2011. A playable demo of Duke Nukem Forever was released once Gearbox <b>figured</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> timing, with purchasers of the Game of the Year Edition of Borderlands gaining early access. The demo is unexpectedly different from the versions available at PAX and Firstlook. Those that purchased Borderlands on Valve's Steam prior to October 12, 2010 got the code for the demo without the need to buy the Game of the Year edition of the game. Duke Nukem Forever was initially scheduled for release on May 3 in the United States and May 6 internationally and after another delay was finally released on June 14 in North America and June 10 worldwide, nearly four weeks after the game had 'gone gold' within 15 years.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1919, Centurion {{had been}} {{transferred}} to the Mediterranean Fleet. Although she {{spent much of her}} time in reserve, she had a peripheral role in the Allied Intervention in the Russian Civil War. After her return home in 1924, the ship became the flagship of the Reserve Fleet. In 1926 Centurion was converted into a target ship and participated in trials evaluating the effectiveness of aerial bombing in addition to her normal duties. During the Second World War, the ship was rearmed with light weapons and was converted into a blockship in 1941. When that operation was cancelled, she was then modified into a decoy with dummy gun turrets in an attempt to fool the Axis powers. Centurion was sent to the Mediterranean in 1942 to escort a convoy to Malta, although the Italians quickly <b>figured</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> deception.

5|$|Lisa {{performs}} a science experiment {{to see if}} cola will dissolve a tooth, and Bart shocks Lisa {{as part of his}} project to prove that nerds conduct electricity. The tooth is also shocked; it undergoes an unusual reaction and creates a race of miniature beings. Lisa discovers this the next day and marvels at how the people in her universe evolve at a rapid rate. Bart destroys some of the ecosystem in Lisa's tub universe, and the people respond by sending a squadron of space ships to attack him. Lisa is shrunk and beamed down into the tub, where the citizens explain that they regard her as God, and they want her to do something about Bart, whom they regard as the Devil. She says she can help them if they unshrink her, but they tell her they have not <b>figured</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> technology to do that. Bart grabs the tub and submits it in the science fair, and Lisa is forced to watch from within as Bart wins first prize. Realizing that she is now stuck in the small universe forever, Lisa orders her citizens to grovel and bring her some shoes.|$|E

25|$|Colorado paid US$275,000 to Montana State for {{the game}} which showed Colorado had not yet <b>figured</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> new system. James Cox went 8–22 for 110yards passing and Colorado had 106yards rushing. The defense held two goal line stances to allow only field goals but the offense could not produce the needed points late in the game. Despite this limited success on defense, Freshman CB Cha'pelle Brown {{consistently}} failed to defend against the pass and Senior safety J. J. Billingsley missed too many tackles. Mason Crosby missed a 63-yard field goal that was well short. This loss extended the losing streak to 5 games.|$|E

After two hours at Anzac Cove, he instructed Lt General Birdwood, the Commander of the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force to begin planning to evacuate the Peninsula. Winter was coming and already too many soldiers were being taken sick and even dying of hypothermia and frostbite, while the Turks had been stubbornly holding their ground. Retreat made sense, aside from just one problem: once the Turks <b>figured</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> troops were pulling back, the retreat would very quickly become a bloodbath.|$|E

In November 2005, Timberlake visited Timbaland's brand-new Thomas Crown Studios in Virginia Beach, Virginia, United States.

500|$|The {{gameplay}} of I Love Bees tasked players {{around the}} world to work together to solve problems, with little or no direction or guidance. For example, the game presented players with 210 pairs of global positioning system coordinates and time codes, with no indications to what the locations referred to. Players eventually <b>figured</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> coordinates referred to pay phones and the times to when the phones would ring; one player in Florida stayed by a phone while Hurricane Frances was minutes away in order to recite answers to prerecorded questions. Other phone calls were made by live persons known as [...] "operators"; these calls allowed players to interact with the characters of the games in spontaneous and occasionally humorous ways. Other players treated the corrupted data on ilovebees.com as encrypted files to decipher, or used image files found on the web server to solve puzzles. After players completed certain tasks, they were rewarded with new installments to an audio drama which revealed the reasons for the ilovebees.com malfunction.|$|E

While King George V and Ajax were scrapped, Centurion was demilitarized by the removal of her armament and was converted into a radio-controlled target ship. In addition to {{being used as a}} target for surface ships, Centurion was used {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} various types of aerial bombing. During the Second World War, she was rearmed with light weapons and was converted into a blockship in 1941. In preparation for that operation (subsequently cancelled), she was modified into a decoy with dummy gun turrets in an attempt to fool the Axis powers. Centurion was sent to the Mediterranean in 1942 to escort a convoy to Malta, although the Italians may have <b>figured</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> deception.

It turned out that workers knew all the tools and parts only by their mat-based names: khuyovina, pizdyulina, khuynyushka, khuyatina, etc. (all of these are loosely translated as [...] "thing"); the same went for technological processes: otkhuyachit (to detach, cut, disconnect), zayebenit (to push through, force into), prikhuyachit (to attach, connect, bond, nail), khuynut (to move slightly, throw, pour), zakhuyarit (to throw far away, to put in deeply) etc.|$|E

2500|$|The Academic Building {{stands at}} the {{crossroads}} of the campus. Completed in 1914, it stands on the site of Old Main, the first campus building, which burned to the ground in 1912. Its most prominent feature is its copper dome, which is green with oxidation, much like the Statue of Liberty. When the building was constructed, {{it was one of the}} first on campus to use rebar. Its architect, A Professor F. E. Giesecke knew little about reinforced concrete, [...] "so [...] just <b>figured</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> amount of steel...necessary and doubled it". The result was an extremely durable building so filled with steel that blowtorches had to be used when piping for water fountains was added. In front of the Academic Building is the Academic Plaza, which is the site of a wide range of campus events, most notably Silver Taps.|$|E
2500|$|Interested in the idea, Raguet {{approached}} associates, Richard Peters, Clement C. Biddle and Thomas Hale {{on creating}} {{a similar institution}} in Philadelphia. A meeting was held on November 25 to discuss the plan. A total of twelve men agreed {{to work together to}} form the bank. Along with Raguet, Peters, Biddle, and Hale, the other men, called associate founders, were Charles N. Bancker, Andrew Bayard, Samuel Breck, John McCrea, William Schlatter, John C. Stocker, John Strawbridge and Roberts Vaux. Over several meetings the group <b>figured</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> bank's structure and positions. Andrew Bayard was elected the first president of the bank during the third meeting on November 28. The bank was named the Philadelphia Saving Fund Society because Raguet felt the name [...] "bank" [...] was unpopular and calling it a society would make it easier to receive a charter from the state legislature.|$|E
2500|$|Initially, {{the editors}} had a {{difficult}} time finding someone to write the series, with Tim Hunter proving a tricky character to get right: although he already appeared in a mini-series, the character's main function had been to bear witness to the past, present and future of magic in the DC universe and so did not offer a writer much detail to work with. [...] Karen Berger eventually settled on writer John Ney Rieber to continue Tim's story, who expanded Tim's character using his own memories of being fourteen, later saying, [...] "I don't believe that my soul is likely to be shuffled off to Purgatory after I die. [...] What would be the point? I've been fourteen already." [...] Rieber utilized his own teenage confusion and delight in writing Tim, while introducing his first girlfriend Molly as a counterpoint: Molly was the opposite of Tim in nearly every way, someone [...] "who'd already <b>figured</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> best thing you could possibly do with your life was live it." ...|$|E
