5|$|Ingels {{was born}} in Copenhagen in 1974 to an {{engineer}} father and a dentist mother. Hoping to become a cartoonist, he began to study architecture in 1993 at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts as {{he thought it would}} help him to improve his drawing skills. Only after he had been studying for a couple of years, <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>really</b> take an interest in architecture. He continued his studies at the Escola Tècnica Superior d'Arquitectura in Barcelona, and returned to Copenhagen to receive his diploma in 1999. As a third-year student in Barcelona, he set up his first practice and won his first competition.|$|E
500|$|Atwell {{referred}} to Carter's relationship with Jarvis as the series' comic relief, while Fazekas called their relationship [...] "the center {{relationship of the}} show". Executive producer Tara Butters compared the relationship to that of Fox Mulder and Dana Scully in the early seasons of The X-Files, where [...] "you really believed they cared about each other but it wasn’t sexual. That was very refreshing." [...] Fazekas discussed giving Jarvis a major character arc in the second season, saying that he [...] "really got a taste for adventure with Peggy in the first season, so, when she comes back into his life, he's so happy because he's so bored with being Howard Stark's butler ... what that starts is a really interesting story for him, which is, how much <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>really</b> understand about what Peggy does? For him, it's like a fun diversion, even though he's in danger ... we will see in Jarvis' story how he grows to understand that and where he comes out in the end. It will have a cost for him, and it {{will have an impact}} on his relationship with Peggy".|$|E

5000|$|Mondale: [...] "I think uh - Senator Dole has richly {{earned his}} {{reputation}} as a hatchet man tonight, by implying, and stating, that World War II and the Korean War were Democratic wars. <b>Does</b> <b>he</b> <b>really</b> mean to suggest to the American people that there was a partisan difference over our involvement in the war to fight Nazi Germany? I don't think any reasonable American would accept that. <b>Does</b> <b>he</b> <b>really</b> mean to suggest that it was only partisanship that got us into the war in Korea?" ...|$|R

6000|$|Mercy {{looked at}} him in unconcealed surprise. His strongly-felt {{interest}} in her was restrained within the strictest limits of good-breeding: he was unmistakably a gentleman. <b>Did</b> <b>he</b> <b>really</b> mean what he had just said? ...|$|E
6000|$|His son made no reply, but {{sipped his}} wine in silence, aching at his heart for his absent bride, and {{wondering}} what his father would say <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>really</b> know what had [...] "kept him in town." ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{laid his}} hand upon my arm. Was it my fancy, or <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>really</b> recoil {{a little as}} he touched me? [...] "Let us go home!" [...] he said hoarsely. [...] "I have--something to say to you!" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "That is good talk," [...] said Miller in reply, [...] "but the {{question}} is, <b>Does</b> <b>he</b> <b>really</b> experiment in that condition of mind?

6000|$|He {{looked a}} little annoyed, and he made his apologies without {{mentioning}} the doctor's name. His cousin was interested enough in him already to ask herself what this meant. <b>Did</b> <b>he</b> <b>really</b> dislike Benjulia, and had there been some disagreement between them? ...|$|E
60|$|Mr. Green stared, for {{his mind}} was {{precisely}} one of those which would conceive {{it to be a}} high act of audacity in a ci-devant colonist to claim the rights of an old country, even <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>really</b> understand the legality and completeness of the separation.|$|E
6000|$|He {{stood at}} the window staring at the hot hillside. [...] "He must get food every day--and I don't envy him. <b>Did</b> <b>he</b> <b>really</b> sleep last night? Out in the open somewhere--secure from collisions. I wish we could get some good cold wet weather instead of the heat.|$|E
40|$|In a Wall Street Journal {{forum on}} terrorism, {{published}} on September 9, 2011, a former top government official wrote: 2 ̆ 2 We {{went to war}} with Germany in 1941 not because it had attacked Pearl Harbor {{but because it was}} dangerous. 2 ̆ 2 <b>Does</b> <b>he</b> <b>really</b> think Germany rather than Japan attacked Pear Harbor?

6000|$|... "O yes, you <b>do!</b> <b>He's</b> <b>really</b> a kind-hearted man. He puts on {{a manner}} which scares people sometimes, but he's {{a man of the}} highest character. He's the {{greatest}} thinker I ever met--O I'm not disloyal to Dr. Sanborn, he's the best man I ever met." [...] There was a story in that tender inflection.

6000|$|It somehow {{completed}} {{the thrill of}} my fanciful nerves that at that instant the Duke appeared again silently among the glimmering trees, with his soft foot and sunset-hued hair, coming round {{the corner of the}} house in company with his librarian. Before he came within earshot, Father Brown had added quite composedly, [...] "Why <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>really</b> hide the secret of what <b>he</b> <b>does</b> with the purple wig?

6000|$|March {{turned his}} face and stared in Stoller's, which he was letting hang forward as he stamped heavily on.

60|$|Walking along {{quickly to}} restore warmth I muse upon my {{eccentric}} friend, and cannot help asking myself this question: <b>Did</b> <b>he</b> <b>really</b> replace the gilded {{image of the}} god Mercurius {{with the rest of}} the treasures? He seemed to do so; and yet I could not testify to the fact. Probably, however, he was as good as his word.|$|E
6000|$|A {{few days}} later we met our friend, and as we strolled beside him in the maniacal hubbub of the New York streets, so {{favorable}} to philosophic communion, we said, [...] "Well, have you met your namesake since you came to his rescue against the robber State, or <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>really</b> sail on the cattle-steamer, as {{he said he was}} going to do?" ...|$|E
5000|$|I {{have a broad}} {{question}} for the minister. <b>Does</b> <b>he</b> <b>really</b> believe in science {{and the implications of}} scientific inquiry? I have a more specific question that will put a fine point on it. There is a vast bunch of science out there that says that life was created on this planet three to four billion years ago, and there are other theories. Does the minister believe that life was created on this planet through evolution three to four billion years ago or <b>does</b> <b>he</b> subscribe to a different theory? MP Bruce Hyer ...|$|R
5000|$|Dean Angelo, the {{president}} of Chicago’s Fraternal Order of Police Lodge 7, declared the accusation of racism in the Chicago Police Department “biased.” Lori Lightfoot, {{who was on the}} task force responded to Angelo [...] "It is hard to fathom that Mr. Angelo maintains his reflexive, uninformed position when it is obviously belied by the facts. <b>Does</b> <b>he</b> <b>really</b> believe that a better trained, better prepared and more professional police force will not inure to the benefit of his members?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Ernest Hemingway (1899-1961), the 1954 Nobel laureate for literature, {{defended his}} concise style against a charge by William Faulkner that he [...] "had never {{been known to}} use a word that might send the reader to the dictionary." [...] Hemingway responded by saying, [...] "Poor Faulkner. <b>Does</b> <b>he</b> <b>really</b> think big {{emotions}} come from big words? He thinks I don't know the ten-dollar words.

60|$|But I {{felt more}} keenly the {{degradation}} of my situation. I was obliged to help Lady Blanche at her toilet and help her to look beautiful. For what? To captivate him? O--no, no,--but why this sudden thrill and faintness? <b>Did</b> <b>he</b> <b>really</b> love her? I had seen him pinch and swear at her. But I reflected that he had thrown a candlestick at my head, and my foolish heart was reassured.|$|E
6000|$|He {{found her}} on a curious tilted bed, her face an unwholesome yellow but her purple lips moving slightly. Then only <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>really</b> {{believe that she was}} alive. She was muttering. He bent, and heard her sighing, [...] "Hard get real maple syrup for pancakes." [...] He laughed inexhaustibly; he beamed on the nurse and proudly confided, [...] "Think of her talking about maple syrup! By golly, I'm going to go and order a hundred gallons of it, right from Vermont!" ...|$|E
6000|$|In {{playing for}} {{points in the}} game of party {{advantage}} Evesham displayed at times a quite wicked unscrupulousness in the use of his subtle mind. I would sit on the Liberal benches and watch him, and listen to his urbane voice, fascinated by him. <b>Did</b> <b>he</b> <b>really</b> care? Did anything matter to him? And if it really mattered nothing, why did he trouble to serve the narrowness and passion of his side? Or did he see far beyond my scope, so that this petty iniquity was justified by greater, remoter ends of which I had no intimation? ...|$|E
60|$|Why {{could not}} he himself desire a woman so? Why <b>did</b> <b>he</b> never <b>really</b> want a woman, {{not with the}} whole of him: never loved, never worshipped, only just {{physically}} wanted her.|$|R
5000|$|What you haven't {{seen the}} trailer is {{the show is}} a lot of fun. That's what you haven't gotten to see yet. What Jake (Brian) <b>does,</b> <b>he's</b> <b>really</b> funny, and brings a sense of fun to it…I think a big thing is the casting of Jake. Obviously we loved the movie, but Bradley's character, Eddie Morra, is kind of self-serving: he takes the drug, he writes this book, he becomes a stock broker, makes money, withwomen, and in a TV show, you're not going to root for that guy. —Kadin, on Limitless (2015) ...|$|R
