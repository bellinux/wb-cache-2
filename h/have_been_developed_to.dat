5|$|Although {{precursors}} to {{this table}} exist, its invention is generally credited to Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev in 1869. Mendeleev invented {{the table to}} illustrate recurring ("periodic") trends in {{the properties of the}} elements. The layout of the table has been refined and extended over time, as new elements have been discovered, and new theoretical models <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>developed</b> <b>to</b> explain chemical behavior.|$|E
5|$|Both CVD and HPHT {{diamonds}} can be {{cut into}} gems and various colors can be produced: clear white, yellow, brown, blue, green and orange. The appearance of synthetic gems on the market created major concerns in the diamond trading business, {{as a result of}} which special spectroscopic devices and techniques <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>developed</b> <b>to</b> distinguish synthetic and natural diamonds.|$|E

5|$|Emphasis in Alzheimer's {{research}} {{has been placed on}} diagnosing the condition before symptoms begin. A number of biochemical tests <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>developed</b> <b>to</b> attempt earlier detection. One such test involves the analysis of cerebrospinal fluid for beta-amyloid or tau proteins, both total tau protein and phosphorylated tau181P protein concentrations.|$|E
5|$|PCR tests <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>developed</b> <b>to</b> {{detect and}} measure the amount of HBV DNA, called the viral load, in {{clinical}} specimens. These tests are used to assess a person's infection status and to monitor treatment. Individuals with high viral loads, characteristically have ground glass hepatocytes on biopsy.|$|E
5|$|Weather {{forecasting}} of wind, precipitations {{and humidity}} {{is essential for}} preventing and controlling wildfires. Different indices, like the Forest fire weather index and the Haines Index, <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>developed</b> <b>to</b> predict the areas more at risk to experience fire from natural or human causes. Conditions {{for the development of}} harmful insects can be predicted by forecasting the evolution of weather, too.|$|E

5|$|At {{least two}} {{different}} types of cyclooxygenases, COX-1 and COX-2, are acted on by aspirin. Aspirin irreversibly inhibits COX-1 and modifies the enzymatic activity of COX-2. COX-2 normally produces prostanoids, most of which are proinflammatory. Aspirin-modified PTGS2 produces lipoxins, most of which are anti-inflammatory. Newer NSAID drugs, COX-2 inhibitors (coxibs), <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>developed</b> <b>to</b> inhibit only PTGS2, with the intent to reduce the incidence of gastrointestinal side effects.|$|E
5|$|Buildings, {{operations}} and management {{have become increasingly}} sophisticated since the mid 20th century, when international airports began to provide infrastructure for international civilian flights. Detailed technical standards <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>developed</b> <b>to</b> ensure safety and common coding systems implemented to provide global consistency. The physical structures that serve millions of individual passengers and flights {{are among the most}} complex and interconnected in the world. By the second decade of the 21st century, there were over 1,200 international airports and almost two billion international passengers along with 50 million metric tonnes of cargo were passing through them annually.|$|E
5|$|Conservation {{efforts for}} Hydnellum are {{hindered}} {{by the fact}} that some species are difficult to discriminate in the field, making it hard to determine an appropriate conservation status. Techniques based on species-specific PCR primers and DNA extraction from soil <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>developed</b> <b>to</b> detect the mycelia of various Hydnellum species without having to rely on the presence of fruitbodies, which may help conservation efforts as well as improve understanding of below-ground ecology. Similar techniques have been used to show that, in the case of H.aurantiacum and H.caeruleum, the fungus can persist below the ground for at least four years without producing fruitbodies.|$|E

5|$|Genetic {{engineering}} is the modification of an organism's genome through biotechnology. Since the 1970s, {{a variety of}} techniques <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>developed</b> <b>to</b> specifically add, remove and edit genes in an organism. Recently developed genome engineering techniques use engineered nuclease enzymes to create targeted DNA repair in a chromosome to either disrupt or edit a gene when the break is repaired. The related term synthetic biology is sometimes used to refer to extensive genetic engineering of an organism.|$|E
5|$|Methods <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>developed</b> <b>to</b> purify DNA from organisms, such as phenol-chloroform extraction, and to {{manipulate}} {{it in the}} laboratory, such as restriction digests and the polymerase chain reaction. Modern biology and biochemistry make intensive use of these techniques in recombinant DNA technology. Recombinant DNA is a man-made DNA sequence that has been assembled from other DNA sequences. They can be transformed into organisms {{in the form of}} plasmids or in the appropriate format, by using a viral vector. The genetically modified organisms produced can be used to produce products such as recombinant proteins, used in medical research, or be grown in agriculture.|$|E
5|$|Molecular {{techniques}} <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>developed</b> <b>to</b> {{help with}} conservation efforts of stipitate hydnoid fungi, including H.peckii. While {{the distribution of}} the fungus has traditionally been determined by counting the fruit bodies, this method has a major drawback in that fruit bodies are not produced consistently every year, and the absence of fruit bodies is not an indication of the absence of its mycelium in the soil. More modern techniques using the polymerase chain reaction to assess the presence of the fungal DNA in the soil have helped alleviate the issues in monitoring the presence and distribution of fungi mycelia.|$|E

5|$|The most fertile period (the {{time with}} the highest {{likelihood}} of pregnancy resulting from sexual intercourse) covers the time from some 5 days before until 1 to 2 days after ovulation. In a 28‑day cycle with a 14‑day luteal phase, this corresponds to the second {{and the beginning of}} the third week. A variety of methods <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>developed</b> <b>to</b> help individual women estimate the relatively fertile and the relatively infertile days in the cycle; these systems are called fertility awareness.|$|E
5|$|The {{primary cause}} of {{vibrations}} in a properly functioning bicycle is the surface over which it rolls. In addition to pneumatic tires and traditional bicycle suspensions, {{a variety of techniques}} <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>developed</b> <b>to</b> damp vibrations before they reach the rider. These include materials, such as carbon fiber, either in the whole frame or just key components such as the front fork, seatpost, or handlebars; tube shapes, such as curved seat stays; and special inserts, such as Zertz by Specialized, and Buzzkills by Bontrager.|$|E
5|$|To {{better control}} the {{population}} of termites, various methods <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>developed</b> <b>to</b> track termite movements. One early method involved distributing termite bait laced with immunoglobulin G (IgG) marker proteins from rabbits or chickens. Termites collected from the field could be tested for the rabbit-IgG markers using a rabbit-IgG-specific assay. More recently developed, less expensive alternatives include tracking the termites using egg white, cow milk, or soy milk proteins, which can be sprayed on termites in the field. Termites bearing these proteins can be traced using a protein-specific ELISA test.|$|E

5|$|Armillaria calvescens {{is rather}} similar in appearance, {{and can only}} be {{reliably}} distinguished from A.gallica by observing microscopic characteristics. A.calvescens has a more northern distribution, and in North America, is rarely found south of the Great Lakes. A.mellea has a thinner stem than A.gallica, but can be more definitively distinguished {{by the absence of}} clamps {{at the base of the}} basidia. Similarly, A.cepistipes and A.gallica are virtually identical in appearance (especially older fruit bodies), and are identified by differences in geographical distribution, host range, and microscopic characteristics. Molecular methods <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>developed</b> <b>to</b> discriminate between the two species by comparing DNA sequences in the gene coding translation elongation factor 1-alpha.|$|E
5|$|Below Spalding, {{there were}} no {{restrictions}} on headroom, which allowed small coasters to reach the town. The bridge at Fosdyke was a swing bridge, {{to comply with the}} provisions of the Fosdyke Bridge Act of 1870. The demise of such traffic allowed it {{to be replaced by a}} fixed bridge with headroom of , but the powers of the original act had to be rescinded, and the Port of Fosdyke Act was obtained in 1987 to allow this to happen. The redundant wharfs at Fosdyke <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>developed</b> <b>to</b> provide moorings for yachts and other pleasure craft. The lock at Fulney has three sets of gates, two pointing towards the sea, and a third between them which points upriver. The lock can thus only be used when the level below it is higher than the level above it, and as the tide falls, the intermediate gate closes to prevent its use.|$|E
5|$|Games {{are played}} on a {{rectangular}} court with raised goal rings at each end. Each team attempts to score goals by passing a ball down the court and shooting it through its goal ring. Players are assigned specific positions, which define their roles within the team and restrict their movement to {{certain areas of the}} court. During general play, a player with the ball can hold on to it for only three seconds before shooting for a goal or passing to another player. The winning team is the one that scores the most goals. Netball games are 60 minutes long. Variations <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>developed</b> <b>to</b> increase the game's pace and appeal to a wider audience.|$|E
