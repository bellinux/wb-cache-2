The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to determine the chemical and organoleptic characteristics of mung <b>bean</b> <b>flakes</b> with the addition of fillers and water. The study was conducted using completely randomized design with two factors namely the addition of fillers and water.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the experiments was to demonstrate the influence of low- and high-tannin <b>horse</b> <b>bean</b> on the selected fermentation indicators. The sheep rumen content {{with the addition of}} 1, 2 and 5 g of high- and low-tannin <b>horse</b> <b>bean</b> was incubated in vessels of 250 ml volume. A significant increase of ammonia, lactic acid, CO 2 and methane as well as pH decrease in samples with addition of <b>horse</b> <b>bean</b> seed was demonstrated. While comparing high- and low-tannin <b>horse</b> <b>bean</b> varieties, it was observed {{that in the case of}} small doses of 1 and 2 g a higher intensity of fermentation takes place in the samples with the addition of high-tannin <b>horse</b> <b>bean.</b> In the case of larger doses of 5 g per sample, a higher intensity of fermentation takes place in the samples with the addition of low-tannin horse-bean. A probable reason for the decrease in the fermentation process intensity in the samples with the addition of 5 g of high-tannin <b>horse</b> <b>bean</b> is a high content of tannins, which reduce fermentation processes.

Among others inadequate capital, lack of experience on export trading, inadequate knowledge of exporters, lower quality standards of <b>horse</b> <b>beans</b> and inadequacy of export incentives and government support services {{are supposed to be}} critical. The major objective {{of this study was to}} identify and analyze to what extent those major determinants affect the performance of export of <b>horse</b> <b>beans</b> across the border. A binary logistic regression is employed using SPSS 15. 0 software to examine the effects of the selected variables on the performance of export of <b>horse</b> <b>beans.</b> A sample of fifty exporters residing in Bahir Dar, Gondar and Metema towns have been taken from a total of 87 exporters in the three areas using simple random sampling technique as primary sources of information. The findings of the study implied that the amount of exporters’ capital, the quality of exportable <b>horse</b> <b>beans</b> and support services of the government were found to significantly affect performance of export.

Tillage treatments included conventional tillage (CT), two-layer tillage (TT), surface tillage (ST) and minimum tillage (MT). In the subplots, the three N fertilization rates, applied to the preceding triticale crop, were 0 kg ha(- 1) (N(0)), 50 kg ha(- 1) (N(50)) and 100 kg ha(- 1) (N(100)). Over the whole experimental period, tillage system did not significantly influence <b>horse</b> <b>bean</b> seed yield, N uptake, crude protein content and 48 -h in vitro true dry matter digestibility.
