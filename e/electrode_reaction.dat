50|$|Therefore, {{according}} to the convention (1), the value of EMF is bivariant (with two variants), i.e., reversing the <b>electrode</b> <b>reaction,</b> and reversing the corresponding cell diagram, will cause the change of sign of ΔG and E, even though the polarity of the cell measured with a direct-current voltmeter does not necessarily reverse.

30|$|As it {{was already}} mentioned, {{the aim of this}} study is to find a handing {{approximate}} solution which best describes a reaction diffusion process related to Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Several oxidoreductase reactions such as quinones and ferrocenes consist of <b>electrode</b> <b>reactions</b> which allow conjugating between redox enzyme <b>reactions</b> and <b>electrode</b> <b>reactions.</b> The redox compound-mediated and enzyme catalysed electrode process is called mediated bioelectrocatalysis (Thiagarajan et al. 2011).

5000|$|Potentiostatic {{coulometry}} is {{a technique}} most {{commonly referred to as}} [...] "bulk electrolysis". The working electrode is kept at a constant potential and the current that flows through the circuit is measured. This constant potential is applied long enough to fully reduce or oxidize all of the electroactive species in a given solution. As the electroactive molecules are consumed, the current also decreases, approaching zero when the conversion is complete. The sample mass, molecular mass, number of electrons in the <b>electrode</b> <b>reaction,</b> and number of electrons passed during the experiment are all related by Faraday's laws. It follows that, if three of the values are known, then the fourth can be calculated.|$|E
50|$|The sample mass, {{molecular}} mass, {{number of}} electrons in the <b>electrode</b> <b>reaction,</b> {{and number of}} electrons passed during the experiment are all related by Faraday's laws of electrolysis. It follows that, if three of the values are known, then the fourth can be calculated. The bulk electrolysis can also be useful for synthetic purposes if {{the product of the}} electrolysis can be isolated. This is most convenient when the product is neutral and can be isolated from the electrolyte solution through extraction or when the product plates out on the electrode or precipitates in another fashion. Even if the product can not be isolated, other analytical techniques can be performed on the solution including NMR, EPR, UV-Vis, FTIR, among other techniques depending on the specific situation. In specially designed cells the solution can be actively monitored during the experiment.|$|E
50|$|In electrochemistry, {{concentration}} polarization denotes {{the part of}} the polarization of an electrolytic cell resulting from changes in the electrolyte concentration due to the passage of current through the electrode/solution interface. Here polarization is understood as the shift of the Electrochemical potential difference across the cell from its equilibrium value. When the term is used in this sense, it is equivalent to “concentration overpotential”. The cause of the changes in concentration (emergence of concentration gradients in the solution adjacent to the electrode surface) is the difference in the rate of electrochemical reaction at the electrode and the rate of ion migration in the solution from/to the surface. When a chemical species participating in an electrochemical <b>electrode</b> <b>reaction</b> is in short supply, the concentration of this species at the surface decreases causing diffusion, which is added to the migration transport towards the surface {{in order to maintain the}} balance of consumption and delivery of that species.|$|E
40|$|This work evaluates {{a number}} of two- and {{three-dimensional}} <b>electrodes</b> for the <b>reactions</b> of an all-copper hybrid flow battery. Half- and full-cell experiments are conducted by minimizing the crossover effect of the copper(II) species. The battery incorporates a Nafion® cation exchange membrane and the negative electrolyte is maintained at the monovalent (colourless) state by the incorporating copper turnings in the electrolyte reservoir. Under such conditions, the half-cell coulombic efficiencies of the negative <b>electrode</b> <b>reactions</b> are all higher than 90 % regardless of electrode materials and the state-of-charge (SOC). With charge–discharge cycling the half-cell from a 0 % SOC, the coulombic efficiencies of the positive <b>electrode</b> <b>reactions</b> are lower than 76 % with the planar carbon electrode, which further decrease in shorter charge–discharge cycles. Polarization and half-cell charge–discharge experiments suggest that the high-surface-area electrodes effectively reduce the overpotentials and improve the coulombic efficiencies of both <b>electrode</b> <b>reactions.</b> When copper fibres and carbon felt are used as the negative and positive electrodes, the average coulombic and voltage efficiencies of an all-copper flow battery are as high as c. a. 99 % and c. a. 60 % at 50 mA cm− 2 for 35 cycles...|$|R

40|$|A {{mathematical}} {{model for the}} theoretical evaluation of microbial electrochemical technologies (METs) is presented that incorporates a detailed physico-chemical framework, includes multiple reactions (both at the electrodes and in the bulk phase) and involves a variety of microbial functional groups. The model is applied to two theoretical case studies: (i) A microbial electrolysis cell (MEC) for continuous anodic volatile fatty acids (VFA) oxidation and cathodic VFA reduction to alcohols, for which the theoretical system response to changes in applied voltage and VFA feed ratio (anode-to-cathode) as well as membrane type are investigated. This case involves multiple parallel <b>electrode</b> <b>reactions</b> in both anode and cathode compartments; (ii) A microbial fuel cell (MFC) for cathodic perchlorate reduction, in which the theoretical impact of feed flow rates and concentrations on the overall system performance are investigated. This case involves multiple <b>electrode</b> <b>reactions</b> in series in the cathode compartment. The model structure captures interactions between important system variables based on first principles and provides a platform for the dynamic description of METs involving <b>electrode</b> <b>reactions</b> both in parallel and in series and in both MFC and MEC configurations.

50|$|Potential sweep {{reversals}} {{as used in}} {{cyclic voltammetry}} are different for a RDE system, since {{the products of the}} potential sweep are continually swept away from the electrode. A reversal would produce a similar i-E curve, which would closely match the forward scan, except for capacitive charging current. A RDE cannot be used to observe the behavior of the <b>electrode</b> <b>reaction</b> products, since they are continually swept away from the electrode. However, the rotating ring-disk electrode is well suited to investigate this further reactivity. The peak current in a cyclic voltammogram for a RDE is a plateau like region, governed by the Levich Equation. The limiting current is typically much higher than the peak current of a stationary electrode, being that the mass transport of reactants is actively stimulated by the rotating disk, and not just governed by diffusion, as is the case for a stationary electrode. Any rotating disk electrode can, of course, also be used as a stationary electrode by using it with the rotator turned off.|$|E
