25|$|Despite being {{relatively}} {{unaffected by}} the embargo, the UK nonetheless faced an oil crisis of its own—a series of strikes by coal miners and railroad workers over the winter of 1973–74 became {{a major factor in}} the change of government. Heath asked the British to <b>heat</b> <b>only</b> one room in their houses over the winter. The UK, Germany, Italy, Switzerland and Norway banned flying, driving and boating on Sundays. Sweden rationed gasoline and heating oil. The Netherlands imposed prison sentences for those who used more than their ration of electricity.|$|E
25|$|Energy {{stored in}} {{capacitive}} or inductive {{elements of the}} network give rise to reactive power flow. Reactive power flow strongly influences the voltage levels across the network. Voltage levels and reactive power flow must be carefully controlled to allow a power system to be operated within acceptable limits. A technique known as reactive compensation is used to reduce apparent power flow to a load by reducing reactive power supplied from transmission lines and providing it locally. For example, to compensate an inductive load a shunt capacitor is installed close to the load itself. This allows all reactive power needed by the load to be supplied by the capacitor {{and not have to}} be transferred over the transmission lines. This practice alone does not save energy in a direct way, because reactive power does no work. But because the reactive component of the current is now only flowing locally, it is producing <b>heat</b> <b>only</b> in the local conductors and thus saving total energy.|$|E

2500|$|In engineering, {{the term}} {{convective}} heat transfer {{is used to}} describe the combined effects of conduction and fluid flow. From the thermodynamic point of view, heat flows into a fluid by diffusion to increase its energy, the fluid then transfers (advects) this increased internal energy (not heat) from one location to another, and this is then followed by a second thermal interaction which transfers heat to a second body or system, again by diffusion. This entire process is often regarded as an additional mechanism of heat transfer, although technically, [...] "heat transfer" [...] and thus heating and cooling occurs only on either end of such a conductive flow, but not as a result of flow. Thus, conduction can be said to [...] "transfer" [...] <b>heat</b> <b>only</b> as a net result of the process, but may not do so at every time within the complicated convective process.|$|E

6000|$|L. When {{they are}} dissolved, or uncrystallized, {{they are really}} {{separated}} from each other, like a swarm of gnats in the air, or like a shoal of fish in the sea;--generally at about equal distances. In currents of solutions, or at different depths of them, one part may be more full of the dissolved atoms than another; but on the whole, you may {{think of them as}} equidistant, like the spots in the print of your gown. If they are separated by force of <b>heat</b> <b>only,</b> the substance is said to be melted; if they are separated by any other substance, as particles of sugar by water, they are said to be [...] "dissolved." [...] Note this distinction carefully, all of you.|$|E
6000|$|Marama {{departed}} {{in a great}} hurry, fearing {{lest the}} [...] "god of the Mountain," [...] or Bastin, whose new and splendid garb he regarded with much suspicion, might develop some evil energy against him. Then {{we went back to}} our camp, leaving the industrious Bastin, animated by a suggestion from Bickley that the fruit and food might spoil if left in the sun, to carry it into the shade of the cave. Owing to the terrors of the Orofenans the supply was so large that to do this he must make no fewer than seven journeys, which he did with great good will since Bastin loved physical exercise. The result on his clerical garments, however, was disastrous. His white tie went awry, squashed fruit and roast pig gravy ran down his waistcoat and trousers, and his high collar melted into limp crinkles in the moisture engendered by the tropical <b>heat.</b> <b>Only</b> his long coat escaped, since that Bickley kindly carried for him.|$|E
60|$|Then they wound through dusky woods {{out of the}} hot valley, {{and down}} the long white road across a sun-baked moor, where the dust whirled behind them in a rolling cloud. However, {{the men in the}} {{foremost}} vehicle got little of it, and Ingleby felt that the drive would have been pleasant in different circumstances, as he watched the blue hills that rose in the dazzling distance, blurred with <b>heat.</b> <b>Only</b> one white fleecy cloud flecked the sweep of cerulean, and the empty moor lay still under the drowsy silence of the Sunday afternoon. It seemed to him most unfitting that the harsh voices of his companions, the clatter of hoofs, and the doleful tooting of the cornet, should jar upon it. Then as they dipped into a hollow they came upon other travellers, all heading in the same direction, who hurled somewhat pointed jests at them as they passed; but these did not exactly resemble the men in the wagonettes. Their attire was by no means neat, and they had not in the least the appearance of men about to discharge a duty, while several of them carried heavy sticks.|$|E

60|$|Edmund looked pleased, {{which must}} be Fanny's comfort, and the ride to Mansfield Common took place the next morning: the party {{included}} all the young people but herself, and was much enjoyed at the time, and doubly enjoyed again in the evening discussion. A successful scheme of this sort generally brings on another; and the having been to Mansfield Common disposed them all for going somewhere else the day after. There were many other views to be shewn; and though the weather was hot, there were shady lanes wherever they wanted to go. A young party is always provided with a shady lane. Four fine mornings successively were spent in this manner, in shewing the Crawfords the country, and doing the honours of its finest spots. Everything answered; it was all gaiety and good-humour, the <b>heat</b> <b>only</b> supplying inconvenience enough to be talked of with pleasure--till the fourth day, when the happiness {{of one of the}} party was exceedingly clouded. Miss Bertram was the one. Edmund and Julia were invited to dine at the Parsonage, and she was excluded. It was meant and done by Mrs. Grant, with perfect good-humour, on Mr. Rushworth's account, who was partly expected at the Park that day; but it was felt as a very grievous injury, and her good manners were severely taxed to conceal her vexation and anger till she reached home. As Mr. Rushworth did not come, the injury was increased, and she had not even the relief of shewing her power over him; she could only be sullen to her mother, aunt, and cousin, and throw as great a gloom as possible over their dinner and dessert.|$|E
