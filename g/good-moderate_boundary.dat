40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare the critical limits for surface water acidification used in the critical loads calculation under the UNECE Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution and the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD) classification in Norway. The critical limits to be compared were the ANClimit,oaa,var from the critical loads calculation and the ANC <b>good-moderate</b> <b>boundary</b> values from the WFD classification. They are not directly comparable, but were compared by using them to calculate critical loads. ANC <b>good-moderate</b> <b>boundary</b> values from the first WFD classification manual gave unrealistic results, showing that these boundary values were too high. Critical loads based on the ANClimit,oaa,var from the critical loads work and the ANC <b>good-moderate</b> <b>boundary</b> values from the second WFD classification manual gave fairly harmonised results. Thus, the requirements set by the two management systems are similar. However, the WFD requirements are somewhat less strict overall, and especially for regions with naturally low buffering capacity or high TOC concentration. Splitting the upper TOC category is recommended. Further harmonisation of the critical limits is possible, but the WFD concept of discrete boundary values sets limitations to complete harmonisation. Updating the ANClimit,oaa,var based on changes in TOC concentration could be considered. Det er to typer politiske reguleringer som brukes i forvaltningen knyttet til forsuring i ferskvann i Norge: UNECEs konvensjon for langtransporterte luftforurensninger (LRTAP) og EUs rammedirektiv for vann (Vannforskriften). Begge bruker grenseverdier for å definere de kjemiske forholdene som er nødvendige for å oppnå ønskelige biologiske forhold. Formålet med dette arbeidet var å sammenligne grenseverdiene brukt i LRTAP-konvensjonen og i implementeringen av vannforskriften i Norge, siden det er viktig at det settes de samme kravene på tvers av forvaltningssystemer.

40|$|The European Water Framework Directive (2000 / 60 /EC) commits the Member States of the European Union to {{classify}} the ecological {{status of their}} surface waters using biological assessment methods. The harmonisation of the good ecological status between Member States {{is done in the}} intercalibration exercise. This doctoral thesis comprises the analysis of basic intercalibration approaches and includes results of the first intercalibration phase. In Chapter 1 the direct comparison of invertebrate-based methods is explored. By means of correlation analyses various biological indices are matched for eight countries sharing two common stream types. The outcomes reveal strong relationships between methods, but deviating definitions of the good ecological status. Supportive environmental data is used to illustrate the level of anthropogenic pressure associated with the respective <b>good-moderate</b> <b>boundary</b> of each national method. In search of the most suitable way for comparing national classifications two differing intercalibration options are studied in Chapter 2. The results show that national macrophyte methods are conceptually different: Divergences in the detection of pressures (nutrient enrichment versus unspecific stresses) and the definition of the natural reference state become evident. Chapter 3 identifies the similarities of national methods to establish common grounds in macrophyte intercalibration. The method comparison is enabled by delineating indicator taxa that are used in a common metric for macrophytes. Chapter 4 includes the comparison of ecological classifications for five Eastern European countries. Common metrics are applied in the intercalibration of national methods using benthic diatoms and invertebrates. Since the availability of data from undisturbed reference sites is generally scarce, an alternative approach based on sites impacted by similar levels of disturbance is employed. The biological benchmarks derived from these sites set transnational reference points for the harmonization of national status classifications...|$|E
