5|$|Because {{the game}} was {{developed}} during the period when Columbia Pictures owned Gottlieb, the intellectual rights to Q*bert remained with Columbia <b>even</b> <b>after</b> <b>they</b> divested themselves of Gottlieb's assets in 1984. Therefore, the rights have been owned by Sony Pictures Entertainment since its parent Sony acquired Columbia in 1989. Q*bert appeared in Disney's computer-animated film Wreck-It Ralph under license from Sony, and later appeared in Columbia's live-action film Pixels in 2015.|$|E
5|$|Earwigs {{have five}} molts {{in the year}} before they become adults. Many earwig species display {{maternal}} care, which is uncommon among insects. Female earwigs may care for their eggs, and <b>even</b> <b>after</b> <b>they</b> have hatched as nymphs will continue to watch over offspring until their second molt. As the nymphs molt, sexual dimorphism such as differences in pincer shapes begins to show.|$|E
5|$|Education of {{the young}} was never {{considered}} to be the primary domain of schools, <b>even</b> <b>after</b> <b>they</b> had become more common. Most education was carried out by a child's parents or foster parents. Formal apprenticeships were not the norm in Plymouth; it was expected that a foster family would teach the children whatever trades they themselves practiced. The church also {{played a central role in}} a child's education. As noted above, the primary purpose of teaching children to read was so that they could read the Bible for themselves.|$|E

Their only child, Elizabeth, was born on 1 January 1789. The relationship was not a happy one and Baker refused to accompany {{his wife and child}} when they were transferred to the remote colonial outpost of Norfolk Island in March 1790. Susannah and Elizabeth had no further contact with Baker, <b>even</b> <b>after</b> <b>they</b> returned to Sydney in the 1800s.|$|E
5|$|The {{two players}} {{did not tell}} their {{teammates}} or management about the deal, feeling that their interactions with bookmakers would meet with disapproval. They {{said that they did}} not feel that their liaisons were harming their team's chances in any way. They remained silent <b>even</b> <b>after</b> <b>they</b> reported Pakistan captain Saleem Malik for attempting to bribe them during the team's subsequent tour of Pakistan. Australian coach Bob Simpson later said that he was unaware of these events, asserting that his anti-betting attitude would have deterred any players from discussing their involvement in such matters with him.|$|E
5|$|Milk's {{early career}} {{was marked by}} {{frequent}} changes; in later years he would take delight in talking about his metamorphosis from a middle-class Jewish boy. He began teaching at George W. Hewlett High School on Long Island. In 1956, he met Joe Campbell, at the Jacob Riis Park beach, a popular location for gay men in Queens. Campbell was seven years younger than Milk, and Milk pursued him passionately. <b>Even</b> <b>after</b> <b>they</b> moved in together, Milk wrote Campbell romantic notes and poems. Growing bored with their New York lives, they {{decided to move to}} Dallas, Texas, but they were unhappy there and moved back to New York, where Milk got a job as an actuarial statistician at an insurance firm. Campbell and Milk separated after almost six years; it would be his longest relationship.|$|E

5|$|The {{script was}} {{originally}} too long, {{and as a}} result many sequences had to be cut, some <b>even</b> <b>after</b> <b>they</b> had been filmed. These included a fight scene with the Doctor and Rosanna's steward (Simon Gregor), a longer fight sequence between Rory and Francesco, and some dialogue between the Doctor and Amy following the climax. In the original script, Amy and Rory cornered Francesco after suspecting him of killing a villager and Francesco climbed up the wall. Whithouse thought this would be a relatively easy stunt, but was told it would be too hard to accomplish and Whithouse revised it to when Francesco simply runs away. When discussing the script with Whithouse, Helen McCrory, who portrayed Rosanna, thought that she should hurt Amy at some point and it was added that she bites Amy while she is in the chamber.|$|E
