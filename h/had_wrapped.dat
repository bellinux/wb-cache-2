5|$|The next {{scenes were}} the El Rancho nightclub scenes {{and the scene}} in which Susan {{attempts}} suicide. Welles later said that the nightclub set was available after another film <b>had</b> <b>wrapped</b> and that filming took 10 to 12 days to complete. For these scenes Welles had Comingore's throat sprayed with chemicals to give her voice a harsh, raspy tone. Other scenes shot in secret included those in which Thompson interviews Leland and Bernstein, which were also shot on sets built for other films.|$|E
5|$|During September 12, the {{depression}} continued to develop quickly {{with both the}} JMA and the JTWC reporting that {{the depression}} had intensified into a Tropical Storm later that day, with the JMA assigning the international name of Choi-wan and the international designation of 0915. During September 13, Choi-wan gradually developed whilst moving west with the JMA reporting that Choi-wan had become a severe tropical storm late that day, before reporting along with the JTWC early the next day that Choi-wan had intensified further and had become a weak Typhoon with multiple spiral bands that <b>had</b> <b>wrapped</b> into the fully consolidated center to form a banding eye. During September 14, Choi-wan intensified further whilst moving along the southwestern edge of a deep level subtropical ridge of the northeast, intensifying into a Category 4-equivalent typhoon on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale with 1-minute winds of 220km/h (140mph).|$|E
5|$|Dracula's Daughter was {{the last}} in the first cycle of Universal Horror films that reached back into the 1920s. Publicly, Universal {{said it was because}} a British ban on horror films would cut too deeply into the revenue such films could generate. In truth, the cycle was {{suspended}} because, just before filming on Dracula's Daughter <b>had</b> <b>wrapped,</b> the Laemmle family had lost control of Universal. Because of cost overruns on a number of pictures, Junior Laemmle was forced to borrow $1,000,000 on November 1, 1935. The money came from J. Cheever Cowdin, head of the Standard Capital Corporation, and from Charles R. Rogers. When the loan was called in March of the following year, Universal was unable to repay it. Standard assumed control of the studio on March 4, 1936 and Rogers replaced Junior as head of production. Rogers did not like horror films and he shut down production on them following the release of Dracula's Daughter to focus on fare like Deanna Durbin musicals. Universal would not return to the horror genre for three years, when it released Son of Frankenstein in 1939.|$|E

5|$|To {{properly}} {{tell the}} international {{aspects of the}} story, filming for Sense8 took place almost entirely on location around the globe. In the first season they filmed in nine cities located in eight countries: Berlin, Chicago, London, Mexico City, Mumbai, Nairobi, Reykjavík, San Francisco, and Seoul. Production on the first season began on June 18, 2014 in San Francisco. The filmmakers successfully negotiated with {{the organizers of the}} Clarion Alley Mural Project and select artists to feature their artwork in the show. Shooting in Chicago began on July 9 and wrapped up on August 8, with filming taking place both on location and at the Cinespace Film Studios. They shot some scenes in the Superdawg drive-through restaurant, while customers were being asked not to stare at the filming. Lana and Lilly Wachowski are frequent customers of the place. During location scouting, the producers found the City Methodist Church in Gary, Indiana which is nearby Chicago, and changed one site's description in the scripts to a church accordingly in order to fit that particular site into the filming. They filmed in the church from July 25 to 28. Filming proceeded to London for a short shoot and then to Iceland, where between August 26 and September 6 they shot in Reykjavik and nearby places such as Akranes. Filming then started in Nairobi, where a sequence required a crowd of 700 extras, 200 cars and a helicopter. In Seoul they filmed from September 18 to 30. Next they moved to Mexico City and later to Germany, where they filmed in Berlin and inside Babelsberg Studio. Last place they visited was Mumbai where they also shot a Bollywood dance number that was choreographed by Slumdog Millionaires Longinus Fernandes. The writers wanted to feature an event in each city. They were able to schedule the Pride scenes with its Dykes on Bikes on the Dyke March in San Francisco, the Fourth of July fireworks celebration in Chicago, and the Ganesha Chaturthi Hindu festival in Mumbai. Additionally they recorded footage from the Fresh Meat Festival of transgender and queer performance in San Francisco, a club event taking place at the KOKO in London, and a real lucha libre (Mexican professional wrestling) event with the fighters wearing wrestling masks in Arena Naucalpan, in Mexico City. Lastly the scenes where characters are flying on an airplane were recorded during the real flights the cast and crew had to do to get from London to Iceland. On November 17, 2014 Straczynski wrote that the main unit shooting <b>had</b> <b>wrapped,</b> with only a few winter shots in Iceland remaining to be captured the next month. These scenes were further delayed to mid-January 2015, until Iceland had the necessary amount of snow, with the wrap party taking place in Reykjavík's Harpa Music and Concert hall on January 21. By the end of the shooting, the filmmakers had completed 100,000 miles of flight time, or four times around the globe.|$|E

Kennedy, if nominated and elected, {{would be unable}} to serve as president for a full term because of Addison's disease and dependence on cortisone. Kennedy, however, <b>had</b> <b>wrapped</b> up the needed delegates for nomination before the convention even opened. Kennedy realized that he could not be elected without support of traditional Southern Democrats, most of whom had backed Johnson. Therefore, Johnson was offered the vice-presidential nomination.|$|E
25|$|While Schoonmaker didn't officially {{work with}} Scorsese until Raging Bull, she did make an uncredited {{contribution}} to Taxi Driver. Scorsese {{had decided not}} to edit the picture Taxi Driver during proaction shooting, but to save all the editing until shooting <b>had</b> <b>wrapped.</b> Unfortunately, this left him very little time to cut the picture, as Columbia’s contract stipulated that a finished cut had to be supplied by the middle of February…among others, Scorsese brought in Schoonmaker to help. At one point, Steven Spielberg visited Scorsese and chipped in with some contributions towards the final edit.|$|E

25|$|There are {{conflicting}} {{accounts of}} his discovery because Röntgen had his lab notes burned after his death, {{but this is}} a likely reconstruction by his biographers: Röntgen was investigating cathode rays from a Crookes tube which he <b>had</b> <b>wrapped</b> in black cardboard so that the visible light from the tube would not interfere, using a fluorescent screen painted with barium platinocyanide. He noticed a faint green glow from the screen, about 1 meter away. Röntgen realized some invisible rays coming from the tube were passing through the cardboard to make the screen glow. He found they could also pass through books and papers on his desk. Röntgen threw himself into investigating these unknown rays systematically. Two months after his initial discovery, he published his paper.|$|E
25|$|In early 1943, the two {{concurrent}} {{radio series}} (Ceiling Unlimited, Hello Americans) that Orson Welles created for CBS {{to support the}} war effort had ended. Filming also <b>had</b> <b>wrapped</b> on the 1943 film adaptation of Jane Eyre and that fee, {{in addition to the}} income from his regular guest-star roles in radio, made it possible for Welles to fulfill a lifelong dream. He approached the War Assistance League of Southern California and proposed a show that evolved into a big-top spectacle, part circus and part magic show. He offered his services as magician and director, and invested some $40,000 of his own money in an extravaganza he co-produced with his friend Joseph Cotten: The Mercury Wonder Show for Service Men. Members of the U.S. armed forces were admitted free of charge, while the general public had to pay. The show entertained more than 1,000 service members each night, and proceeds went to the War Assistance League, a charity for military service personnel.|$|E
25|$|The biggest {{irritants}} came in 1982. In that year, the ABA discarded {{their system}} in which how well a pro did during the season had at least some bearing on who became Number one Pro for the year. Previously to 1982, who won the most money decided who was number one Pro. A pro's winnings were his points. The reason for the change was that Kevin McNeal, the ABA Number One Pro for 1981, had a runaway season and <b>had</b> <b>wrapped</b> up the title a full month before the Grand National, rendering the event vis a vis Number one Pro irrelevant. This resulted in a low turnout of big-name pros like Stu Thomsen and Greg Hill, both of whom opted to attend the NBL-sanctioned $10,000 pursed Knott's Berry Farm Mongoose International Grand Championships race being held the same weekend. Lack of pro attendance due to a foregone conclusion would mean lack of publicity for the ABA in the BMX press, which in turn would breed reluctance in both various BMX Industry and non-BMX industry-related companies to sponsor the Grand Nationals. The ABA {{wanted to make sure}} in 1982 that the pros attended their Grand Nationals and it was a relevant event.|$|E

500|$|Shatner {{scheduled}} {{the campfire}} scenes {{to be the}} last ones shot, after which the cast and crew had a small celebration before a traditional wrap party later. The cast celebrated the end of filming in the last week of December 1988, and gave a press conference on the set of the Enterprise bridge on December 28. Shatner returned to Paramount Studios a few days after principal photography <b>had</b> <b>wrapped</b> to organize the film's post-production schedule. This included showing a rough cut of the film— minus the special effects— to studio personnel. Shatner recalled that the film received praise and left the screening [...] "reveling" [...] in its reception; {{it turned out to be}} a [...] "momentary victory" [...] once he saw the special effects.|$|E
500|$|After Downey missed another {{required}} {{drug test}} in 1999, {{he was arrested}} once more. Despite Downey's lawyer, John Stewart Holden, assembling for his client's 1999 defense the same team of lawyers that successfully defended O.J. Simpson during his criminal trial for murder, Downey was sentenced to a three-year prison term at the California Substance Abuse Treatment Facility and State Prison in Corcoran, California (a.k.a. [...] "Corcoran II"). At {{the time of the}} 1999 arrest, all of Downey's film projects <b>had</b> <b>wrapped</b> and were close to release, with the exception of In Dreams, which he was allowed to complete filming. He had also been hired for voicing the devil on the NBC animated television series God, the Devil and Bob, but was fired when he failed to show up for rehearsals.|$|E
500|$|Operationally, the NHC did not {{initiate}} advisories until 1500UTC on November29, {{about nine}} hours after it actually developed. By that time, the convection <b>had</b> <b>wrapped</b> into a ring [...] in diameter. In the first advisory on Epsilon, the NHC forecast steady strengthening to near hurricane status due to marginally favorable conditions, followed by extratropical transition within five days; an alternate possibility was Epsilon being absorbed by a larger extratropical storm. The storm moved westward after its development with a persistent ridge to its north. Initially, Epsilon was embedded beneath an upper-level low that provided {{an area of}} low wind shear and instability. An eye-like feature briefly developed {{in the center of}} the convection, although the thunderstorms waned late on November28 due to restricted inflow. However, banding features and outflow improved at the same time.|$|E

500|$|As {{the series}} progressed during its {{broadcast}} season, the writers received frequent notes and directives from Fox network executives calling for increases and decreases in the science-fiction, comedy and traditional Western elements. Cuse said, [...] "I {{think we did}} a particularly good job of maintaining continuity with all the schizophrenic notes we were getting from the network." [...] However, midway through the first season, the writers made a thematic shift from science-fiction to more comedy and adventure. Cuse said, [...] "We were biting off more than we could chew... {{we were trying to}} do a comedic action adventure Western, with tongue-in-cheek humor, genuine drama, plus science fiction. All these things added too many elements to serve simultaneously." [...] By the final third of the series, the writers <b>had</b> <b>wrapped</b> up the science-fiction plot with the Orb and focused more on traditional Western motifs.|$|E
500|$|Wolfe, {{positioned}} {{with the}} 28th Foot and the Louisbourg Grenadiers, {{had moved to}} a rise to observe the battle; he had been struck in the wrist early in the fight, but <b>had</b> <b>wrapped</b> the injury and continued on. Volunteer James Henderson, with the Louisbourg Grenadiers, had been tasked with holding the hill, and reported afterwards that within moments of the command to fire, Wolfe was struck with two shots, one low in the stomach and the second, a mortal wound in the chest. Knox wrote {{that one of the}} soldiers near Wolfe shouted [...] "They run, see how they run." [...] Wolfe, on the ground, opened his eyes and asked who was running. [...] Upon being told that the French had broken, he gave several orders, then turned on his side and said [...] "Now, God be praised, I will die in peace", and died.|$|E
500|$|Peter Cashmore of NME {{stated that}} it [...] "is a glorious snail’s-pace gush of braggadocio. In fact, if the album <b>had</b> <b>wrapped</b> up after [...] "Sanctified", rather than {{dribbling}} to a close with the weedy [...] "Walkin’ On Air" [...] and [...] "Thug Cry", then Mastermind would be pretty much wall-to-wall bangers." [...] Craig Jenkins of Pitchfork Media gave this song the tag of [...] "Best New Track" [...] and stated, [...] "'Sanctified' is an outstanding entry into Ross and Kanye’s catalogue of stunners, but it never feels like Ross' song." [...] Christopher Weingarten of Rolling Stone said, the song [...] "shines with guest singer Betty Wright's powerful gospel rasp and Kanye West confessing his sins on a featured verse. Ross, meanwhile, ends up talking designer clothes and fellatio." [...] Ken Capobianco of the Boston Globe said that [...] "Kanye West turns his host into an afterthought on the fine, gospel-influenced [...] "Sanctified".|$|E
