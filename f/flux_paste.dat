50|$|The stencil {{printing}} function is achieved through a single material namely solder paste {{which consists of}} solder metal and <b>flux.</b> <b>Paste</b> also acts as an adhesive during component placement and solder reflow. The tackiness of the paste enables the components to stay in place. A good solder joint is one where the solder paste has melted well and flowed and wetted the lead or termination on the component and the pad on the board.|$|E
50|$|To obtain perfect joins, {{the inside}} of the fitting and the outside of the copper pipe are cleaned using coarse steel wool, <b>flux</b> <b>paste</b> is applied, the pipe is {{inserted}} into the fitting and heat applied from a portable propane torch until a ring of solder shows {{at the edges of the}} fitting. To obtain a durable joint, water must not be poured on the solder joint to cool it. Yorkshire fittings are now made with lead-free solder.|$|E
50|$|Unless brazing {{operations}} are contained within an inert or reducing atmosphere environment (i.e. a vacuum furnace), a flux such as borax {{is required to}} prevent oxides from forming while the metal is heated. The flux also serves the purpose of cleaning any contamination left on the brazing surfaces. Flux can be applied {{in any number of}} forms including <b>flux</b> <b>paste,</b> liquid, powder or pre-made brazing pastes that combine flux with filler metal powder. Flux can also be applied using brazing rods with a coating of flux, or a flux core. In either case, the flux flows into the joint when applied to the heated joint and is displaced by the molten filler metal entering the joint. Excess flux should be removed when the cycle is completed because flux left in the joint can lead to corrosion, impede joint inspection, and prevent further surface finishing operations. Phosphorus-containing brazing alloys can be self-fluxing when joining copper to copper.Fluxes are generally selected based on their performance on particular base metals. To be effective, the flux must be chemically compatible with both the base metal and the filler metal being used. Self-fluxing phosphorus filler alloys produce brittle phosphides if used on iron or nickel. As a general rule, longer brazing cycles should use less active fluxes than short brazing operations.|$|E
40|$|In view of {{the problem}} that <b>paste</b> <b>flux</b> is {{difficult}} to spread uniformly {{on the surface of}} filler metal, the adhesion behavior of the different concentrations of <b>paste</b> <b>flux</b> on the surface of filler metal was studied by the equipment of OM, wetting angle tester and surface tensiometer. The results show that adhesive layer is gradually thickened with the increase of the concentration of <b>paste</b> <b>flux.</b> A small amount of shrinkage appears in the thin adhesive layer. however, mass <b>paste</b> <b>flux</b> slides off filler metal when adhesive layer is thicker, accompanying by severe aggregation and shrinkage. For the ideal surface, the adhesive tension of <b>paste</b> <b>flux</b> with different concentrations of <b>paste</b> <b>flux</b> is the same. For the actual surface, the stripe groove additional pressure is formed when <b>paste</b> <b>flux</b> wets stripe groove, and the additional pressure is the main reason for the lagging phenomenon of the shrinkage of the adhesive layer. With the increase of <b>paste</b> <b>flux</b> concentration, the additional pressure decreases, the hysteresis resistance decreases, and the shrinkage increases. A relationship is satisfied when the shrinkage takes place in thin adhesive layer, this is Δ W C ≥ A +Δ P. Whether the shrinkage occurs mainly depends on the adhesion tension and the additional pressure...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- Titanium alloys {{have found}} {{increased}} applications in various industrial sectors. One {{of the critical}} issues in quality control is the weld penetration during welding. In the present paper, tungsten inert gas (TIG) welding of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy with and without an activating flux was conducted. The effect of the activating flux on Ti alloy welding was investigated. A data acquisition system was used to monitor the welding current and voltage signals during welding. These signals were then correlated to the weld penetration information. It was found that by applying the activating flux on the Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy surface, weld penetration increases. The amount of the activating <b>flux</b> <b>pasted</b> in the surface determines the penetration capability. Results from monitoring of the welding current and voltage signals indicate {{that there is a}} clear correlation between the signals and the weld penetration. Therefore, process monitoring can provide an effective way to assess the consistency of the weld penetration and thus the quality of the welds...|$|R
40|$|The figure {{depicts the}} main {{parts of a}} {{prototype}} miniature, lightweight, onetime- opening valve. Like some other miniature one-time-opening valves reported in previous issues of NASA Tech Briefs, this valve is opened by melting a material that blocks the flow path. This valve is designed to remain closed at some temperature between room temperature and cryogenic temperature until the time of opening. The prototype valve includes a 1 / 8 -in. (3 -mm) aluminum tube, one end of which is plugged with a solder comprising about 37 weight percent of lead and 63 weight percent of tin. The tube and the solder both have a {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} of 23 micron/m-K at room temperature. Before plugging, the interior surface of the plug end of the tube is cleaned with a commercial <b>flux</b> <b>paste</b> developed specifically for preparing aluminum for bonding with lead/tin solder. The solder is then melted into the cleaned end of the tube, forming the plug. In a test, the plugged tube was pressurized to 1, 000 psi (6. 9 MPa) with helium and leak-tested. It was then cooled to a temperature of 77 K (about 196 C) and again leak-tested at the same pressure. Finally, at a lower pressure, the plugged end of the tube was heated to about 200 C (the melting temperature of the solder is 183 C), causing the solder plug to be ejected (see figure). It has been estimated that in a subsequent version of the valve, the plug could be melted by electrical heating, using a nichrome wire having a mass of only 10 g...|$|E

Solder joint damage was of a greater extent after thermal shock exposures rather than thermal cycling. The Sn-Ag-Bi alloy on the largest package appeared most susceptible to thermal shock.

50|$|The graping {{phenomenon}} can {{be resolved}} utilizing proper solder materials in addition to correct reflow profile settings. Solder powders are available that provide a tighter distribution range {{as well as a}} high oxidation barrier. This barrier not only improves the paste release from the stencil, but also provides an ideal surface area-to-volume ratio. These solder powder characteristics help to eliminate the graping phenomenon. Future solder <b>paste</b> <b>flux</b> formulations provide sufficient activity paired with re-oxidation mitigation capabilities. This pairing means that graping {{can be resolved}} as it occurs which is ideal for miniaturization processes.|$|R

50|$|Graping {{occurrence}} {{has continued}} to increase since it was first identified in 2006. The viscosity of the flux decreases as {{the temperature of the}} reflow oven increases. Lead-free reflow soldering temperatures are higher which results in more graping. Graping is also caused by increased surface oxidation. The increased surface oxidation is the result of smaller printed paste deposit volumes that cause a diminished surface area to flux ratio of the solder particle resulting in flux exhaustion. While solder paste can be manufactured using any size range however there has been a move towards finer particle sizes especially for fine feature stencil printing. Finer particle sizes places added pressure on the solder <b>paste</b> <b>flux</b> to remove surface oxides which leaves the outside of the joint not fully coalesced producing the irregular surface finish known as graping.|$|R
40|$|Fluxless {{soldering}}, i. e. residue free soldering {{with the}} aid of gaseous activation is known for many years, but only well established in the field of opto-and microwave electronics. In low cost high volume applications this technology has not yet become mainstream. In the fluxless soldering the wetting of the solder is made possible by means of an activating process gas. After the soldering process, no cleaning process is necessary because no corrosive residues are left on the circuit boards and components. Therefore soldering using solder paste without aggressive chemical ingredients has a high market potential. Expensive preforms could be replaced by paste dispensing or paste printing. In this paper, a residue free SnAgCu solder paste and a suitable soldering process is developed and presented. It is applied on high power ceramic LED packages and unpackaged flip chip LEDs which can be assembled directly on a substrate. In this paper the main paste properties such as printability of a commercial <b>flux</b> solder <b>paste</b> with those of the fluxless solder paste are compared. Likewise, the soldering results after a reflow process of these different paste systems are evaluated and compared. Different solder joint analysis methods like X-Ray, the transient thermal analysis, cross section and shear strength tests are presented in this paper. Finally a measurement technique to detect contamination on a soldered module is shown. There is a possibility that the concept and process proposed and demonstrated in this paper can reduce the production costs of electronic systems and improve the quality of soldered electronic modules...|$|R

We investigated void propagation in the solder interconnect joints of a semiconductor packaging and believe can be lead to a new crack propagation. Stereometry of voids and morphology of the joint was examined by using 3 -D Stereology Microscope (IFM) ®. 3 D analysis of microstructure was carried out to obtain depth profile formation of voids streometry. The average of depth of 50 μm – 60 μm meanwhile diameter of 45 μm – 85 μm were observed. SEM analysis was also carried out to support all the data’s obtained.

40|$|The Surface Mount Technology (SMT) {{industry}} has been faced with several challenges in the past decades. Two {{of the most recent}} ones are RoHS compliant lead-free assembly and the adoption of fine-pitch components assembly processes. Moreover, halogen-free is another new requirement for assembled PCB reliability, environmental and health concerns. All these requirements create fundamental challenges of developing a solder paste to satisfy everything. One of the resolutions for these challenges can be the development of the activator package with the advanced organic chemistry technology. Serial innovative activator system was developed recently for solder <b>paste</b> <b>flux,</b> tacky flux and liquid flux formulation. This paper will discuss three Type 4 lead-free halogen-free no-clean solder pastes (ROL 0) developed based on different innovative activators, which respond to the challenges described above.

The testing results show all three pastes with the new activators are fully capable of printing and reflowing 01005 components with different board/device finishes, even in air reflow. They can handle a wide variety of print variables, including print speed, long abandon time and a wide range of temperature and humidity.
