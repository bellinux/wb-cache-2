40|$|Introduction: Rickets is {{diagnosed}} based on classical clinical features like craniotabes, rachitic rosary, widening of wrist joints, pot belly, hypotonia, bowed legs {{and supported by}} the laboratory evidence of hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, and raised alkaline phosphatase. Hypocalcemic convulsions are a rare manifestation of nutritional rickets. Decline in the magnitude of the rickets requires high index of suspicion to identify this treatable condition. Herewith presenting retrospective study of twelve cases of rickets who presented with hypocalcemic seizures as primary manifestation. Materials and methods: A detailed retrospective analysis of diagnosed cases of rickets presenting with convulsions was done. Children who were admitted with <b>hypocalcemic</b> <b>convulsion</b> and subsequently diagnosed to have rickets were included in the study. Children who did not fulfill the criteria for diagnosis of rickets either clinically or biochemically or radiologically were excluded from the study. Details including age at presentation, weight, sex, gestational age and other associated diseases were collected and analyzed. Rickets was diagnosed on the basis of clinical features, biochemical parameters (serum calcium, phosphorous, alkaline phosphatase) and radiological findings. Results: A Total of 12 children; 8 male and 4 females constituted the study subjects. Mean age of presentation was 6 months. All children had presented with preceding convulsions or active convulsions. One child who presented with active convulsions was treated with parenteral phenobarbitone. All 12 of them were evaluated for the cause and found to have hypocalcemia without any other cause for convulsions. Further clinical examination revealed features of rickets and were subjected to radiological and biochemical investigations. The mean calcium value was 6. 3 mg/dl, phosphorus - 5. 35 mg/dl, alkaline phosphatase- 890. 13 units. All the cases had radiological features of rickets. All 12 were treated with parenteral vitamin-D and they responded well to the treatment. Conclusions: Convulsion is a rare manifestation of rickets and as a primary presentation is even rarer. Current observational study indicates that rickets could be a cause of <b>hypocalcemic</b> <b>convulsion</b> in young infants and children. Screening infants and young children presenting with convulsion for rickets can help in early diagnosis and institution of specific therapy...|$|E
40|$|Summary A case of {{simultaneous}} bilateral scapula fractures and a femoral neck {{fracture of}} the right hip suffered during <b>hypocalcemic</b> <b>convulsions</b> in a 19 -year-old male is pre-sented. The medical history, the treatment, and his latest follow-up are reported. The treatment approaches of such fractures in renal osteodystrophy patients are discussed. Case report A case of simultaneous bilateral scapula fractures and a femoral neck fracture {{of the right}} hip suffered during <b>hypocalcemic</b> <b>convulsions</b> by a 19 -year-old male is presented. His medical history, the treatment he received during the years following his first presentation {{as well as his}} latest follow-up 2 years later are reported. Discussion The main issue of this report is the first osteosynthesis failure and the justification of the second. The treatment approaches of femoral neck fractures in patients with renal osteodystrophy are outlined, as they appear in the relevant literature.

40|$|Hereditary hypomagnesemia with {{secondary}} hypocalcemia (HSH) {{is a rare}} condi-tion {{caused by}} mutations in the Transient Receptor Potential Melastatin 6 (TRMP 6) gene. Patients usually present during early infancy with symptomatic hypocalcemia; however, intracranial calcification has not been previously reported in HSH. We report on a three-month-old Saudi girl who presented with <b>hypocalcemic</b> <b>convulsions</b> and was initially treated as nutritional rickets. However, further biochemical analysis of blood and urine were suggestive of HSH. This diagnosis was confirmed by mutation analysis, which identified a novel homozygous frame shift mutation (ins 2999 T) of the TRMP 6 gene. A computed tomography brain scan, done {{around the time of}} diagnosis, identified bilateral basal ganglia calcification (BGC). Her serum calcium and the BGC improved with magnesium replacement. BGC can be added as a new feature of HSH and the case highlights the importance of measuring serum Mg in patients with <b>hypocalcemic</b> <b>convulsions,</b> particularly in children of consanguineous parents...|$|R
40|$|A male born {{to first}} cousins {{presented}} at 12 months with <b>hypocalcemic</b> <b>convulsions,</b> rickets, epistaxis due to vitamin K deficiency, and extremely low serum levels of beta-carotene and vitamin A. Liver function was altered moderately (glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase, 55 U/L; glutamic-pyruvic transaminase, 37 U/L; lactate dehydrogenase, 255 U/L; alkaline phosphatase, 437 U/L). To correct the deficiencies, 8000 IU vitamin D/day, 10, 000 IU vitamin A/day, and intramuscular administration of vitamin K 1 were required. At 9 years, he presented signs of neuromuscular affection, and the serum vitamin E level (measured {{for the first}} time) was extremely low. Classic lipid malabsorption syndromes (abetalipoproteinemia, chronic cholestasis, mucoviscidosis, coeliac disease, Whipple's disease) were excluded by appropriate examinations. Composition of duodenal bile acids was characterized by undetectable levels of cholic acid metabolites, and only chenodeoxycholic acid metabolites were present. Serum total bile acid concentration was normal, with an atypical low cholic acid/chenodeoxycholic acid ratio and abnormal presence of 3 β-OH-Δ 5 -cholenic acid and 6 -OH-bile acids. Urinary bile acid composition was also characterized by elevated 6 -OH-bile acids. Known enzymopathies of the bile acid synthetic pathway were excluded (cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, cerebro-hepato-renal syndrome of Zellweger, coprostanic acidemia). Bile acid pool sizes were determined by using stable isotopes: cholic acid pool size [2. 90 (N, 32 ± 16) μM/kg] and chenodeoxycholic acid pool size [10. 8 (N, 32. 6 ± 9. 9) μM/kg] were extremely low; fractional turnover rates of both bile acids were in a normal range. Treatment with chenodeoxycholic acid markedly improved the absorption of fat soluble substances and normalized hepatic function. A partial enzyme defect in the metabolism of the steroid nucleus is proposed. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|Vitamin D is {{a hormone}} in steroid form {{rather than a}} vitamin. The main source of vitamin D is {{cutaneous}} synthesis after exposure to solar ultraviolet B radiation (wavelength, 290 - 310 nm). Cutaneous vitamin D production is inşuenced by age, skin pigmentation, latitude, and season of the year. Uptake of Vitamin D with only natural products can not meet the recommended daily requirements. Human milk contains 10 - 60 IU/L of Vitamin D which is far from daily requirement. Rickets are usually seen among infants between ages of 6 months and 3 years old age who are not exposed to sunlight, and breastfed without appropriate vitamin D supplementation in winter season. The classic effect of 1. 25 -dihydroxyvitamin D is on active calcium transport in the intestinal cell. Vitamin D deficiency in infant and children adversely affects calcium metabolism resulting in Rickets, <b>hypocalcemic</b> <b>convulsions,</b> bowing of weight-bearing bones, muscle weakness, hypoplasia of tooth, general ill health, and poor growth. The skull is frequently soft and enlarged with delayed closure of the fontanels. Vitamin D also {{plays a role in}} the pathogenesis of auto-immune disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and congestive heart failure and also regulates specific cell differentiation and proliferation. The incidence of vitamin D deficiency in our population is 1. 6 - 19 %. Treatment for Rickets may be administered gradually over several months or in a single day's dose (stoss therapy) with vitamin D. Stoss therapy may be advantageous when compliance with therapy and/or follow up is a problem. However, such high doses of vitamin D can lead to hypercalcemia. Rickets is due to a deficiency in vitamin D, and can be prevented by exposure to sunlight or by dietary supplements of vitamin D. It is recommended that adequate intake of vitamin D to prevent Rickets in infants is 400 IU per day in first year and preferably for three years...|$|R
