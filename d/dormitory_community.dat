A planned extension of this highway to the north, to the [...] seems definitively buried. Although {{it has been}} desired by elected officials for the voters and the State, in order to divert trucks from the A7, the absence of this highway has not created the announced decline. On the contrary, the city ceased to grow (see demographics) without being absorbed by its relatively distant neighbours thanks precisely to its relative isolation from the main road network, including Grenoble (in no effect a <b>dormitory</b> <b>community).</b>|$|E

The name of each building in Middle Earth is named after a character or a place from J.R.R. Tolkien's The Hobbit and [...] "The Lord of the Rings". Middle Earth was built in three phases. The first phase was built in 1974 and it includes seven halls: Hobbiton, Isengard, Lorien, Mirkwood, Misty Mountain, Rivendell, and the Shire, along with a separate Head Resident's manufactured home called [...] "Bag End". The second phase was built in 1989 with thirteen more halls: Balin, Harrowdale, Whispering Wood, Woodhall, Calmindon, Grey Havens, Aldor, Rohan, Gondolin, Snowbourn, Elrond, Shadowfax, and Quenya. The third phase was built in 2000 with four halls: Crickhollow, Evenstar, Oakenshield, and Valimar. Each hall houses about fifty to eighty students, although Quenya was built with sixty single suite rooms which mainly house graduate students.|$|R
5000|$|The region may {{be defined}} as the {{catchment}} area from which employees and students commute into the city on a daily basis. It is the catchment area from which people choose to visit one city, as opposed to another, for retail shopping and entertainment. Economically the city region may include the hinterland that depends on its wholesale markets, banking facilities, transport hubs and information exchanges. The region needing integration may be seen as the zone from which perishable foods, firewood and building materials supply the city. The economic region can also {{be defined as the}} area managed by exchanges in the city. Telephone calls to the region go through the city's telecom exchange; post goes through the city's general post office; money transfers go through the city’s financial institutions and internet data passes electronically through the city’s servers. The area over which “city exchanges" [...] disperse matter can well be called the city’s economic hinterland or region. Usually the region includes <b>dormitory</b> <b>communities,</b> airports, water reservoirs, perishable food farms, hydro facilities, out-of-doors recreation and other infrastructure that serves the city. Intelligent urbanism sees the integrated planning of these services and facilities as part of the city planning process.|$|R

40|$|In this study, {{we argue}} that the {{specific}} process of the proletarianization of Chinese migrant workers contributes to the recent rise of labour protests. Most of the collective actions involve workers' conflict with management {{at the point of}} production, while simultaneously entailing labour organizing in <b>dormitories</b> and <b>communities.</b> The type of living space, including workers' <b>dormitories</b> and migrant <b>communities,</b> facilitates collective actions organized not only on bases of locality, ethnicity, gender and peer alliance in a single workplace, but also on attempts to nurture workers' solidarity in a broader sense of a labour oppositional force moving beyond exclusive networks and ties, sometimes even involving cross-factory strike tactics. These collective actions are mostly interest-based, accompanied by a strong anti-foreign capital sentiment and a discourse of workers' rights. By providing detailed cases of workers' strikes in 2004 and 2007, we suggest that the making of a new working class is increasingly conscious of and participating in interest-based or class-oriented labour protests.

25|$|St. Ann's Church, a rusticated-stone {{structure}} with a Romanesque Revival tower on East 12th Street that dated to 1847, {{was sold to}} NYU {{to make way for}} a 26-story, 700-bed <b>dormitory.</b> After <b>community</b> protest, the university promised to protect and maintain the church's original facade; and so it did, literally, by having the facade stand alone in front of the building, now the tallest structure in the area.

5000|$|The {{industry}} {{of the town}} was initially tied to the abundant fruit growing operation ... {{there was once a}} canning factory and a basket factory in Forest. In more recent years the town has become a <b>dormitory</b> <b>community</b> for the city of Sarnia (and to a lesser extent London, Ontario). Support to the extensive tourism area along the shores of nearby Lake Huron also supports several businesses.

50|$|Dronfield Woodhouse once {{claimed to}} have the largest privately owned housing estate in Europe ("Gosforth Valley") {{when it was first}} built in the 1970s. During the same decade, on 16 October 1975, the £6.5m 5 mi A61 Dronfield-Unstone Bypass was opened running through the western side of the town, to allow easier access for travel between the larger {{populated}} areas of Sheffield to the north and Chesterfield to the south.

50|$|Kruttschnitt tackled Mount Isa's {{problems}} with relentless energy and after more capital was raised through overseas financiers, ore production commenced again in 1931. In earlier {{years of the}} mine's operation, the company expended {{large amounts of money}} providing housing for employees. Two-storeyed timber houses, a number of <b>dormitories</b> and <b>community</b> buildings were constructed for workers during these more buoyant years. The 1930s saw more austere housing accommodation for workers often in the form of tin huts and tent houses. The problem of a lack of financial resources for accommodation extended to Kruttschnitt's own residence. Initially, he was housed in a modest staff house overlooking Central Park and the Band Rotunda. Kruttschnitt was reported to be unimpressed with his quarters.|$|R
