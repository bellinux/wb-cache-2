The researchers suggested that the effect is stronger for higher numbers because in daily life these numbers are less saturated with other meanings, other than their associations with birthdays.|$|E
5|$|Of Stratton's many contributions, {{his studies}} on {{perception}} and visual illusions {{would continue to}} influence the field of psychology well after his death.

Stratton considered these issues more salient to the application of psychology in the real world, though his ideas on this front did not produce a lasting impact in the field because of their subjective and non-experimental nature.|$|E

The 2011 United Nations Development Programme's Human Development Report ranked India 132 out of 187 in terms of gender inequality. The value of this multidimensional indicator, Gender Inequality Index (GII) is determined by numerous factors including maternal mortality rate, adolescent fertility rate, educational achievement and labour force participation rate. Gender inequality in India is exemplified by women’s lower likelihood of being literate, continuing their education and participating in the labour force.|$|E

The aim of replication is to assess the generalizability of a theoretical claim and the “research finding” that is (or is not) confirmed in the replication study is a claim that is derived from the previous studies. Sometimes the term replication is also used for conducting a study in the same case (or population) in order to assess whether the <b>finding</b> <b>from</b> the previous study can be reproduced. To avoid confusion, the latter method of assessing the reliability of a study might better be called duplication. Duplication will not be discussed here...|$|R

5|$|After {{returning}} to Edmonton in 1982 and {{learning of the}} lead-level <b>findings</b> <b>from</b> the 1981 expedition, Beattie struggled to find a cause. Possibilities included the lead solder used to seal the expedition's food tins, other food containers lined with lead foil, food colouring, tobacco products, pewter tableware, and lead-wicked candles. He came {{to suspect that the}} problems of lead poisoning compounded by the effects of scurvy could have been lethal for the Franklin crew. However, because skeletal lead might reflect lifetime exposure rather than exposure limited to the voyage, Beattie's theory could be tested only by forensic examination of preserved soft tissue as opposed to bone. Beattie decided to examine the graves of the buried crewmen on Beechey Island.|$|E
5|$|<b>Findings</b> <b>from</b> the Dawn {{spacecraft}} {{have found}} evidence that the troughs that wrap around Vesta could be graben formed by impact-induced faulting (see Troughs section above), meaning that Vesta has more complex geology than other asteroids.

The only thing that knocked it out of the category of a dwarf planet was the formation of two large impact basins at its southern pole. At the time of these impacts Vesta was not warm and plastic enough to return to a shape in hydrostatic equilibrium.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a fuzzy analysis technique for pitch class determination that improves {{the accuracy of}} key <b>finding</b> <b>from</b> audio information. Errors in audio key finding, typically incorrect assignments of closely related keys, commonly result from imprecise pitch class determination and biases introduced {{by the quality of}} the sound. Our technique is motivated by hypotheses on the sources of audio key finding errors, and uses fuzzy analysis to reduce the errors caused by noisy detection of lower pitches, and to refine the biased raw frequency data, in order to extract more correct pitch classes. We compare the proposed system to two others, an earlier one employing only peak detection from FFT results, and another providing direct key <b>finding</b> <b>from</b> MIDI. All three used the same key finding algorithm (Chew’s Spiral Array CEG algorithm) and the same 410 classical music pieces (ranging from Baroque to Contemporary). Considering only the first 15 seconds of music in each piece, the proposed fuzzy analysis technique outperforms the peak detection method by 12. 18 % on average, matches the performance of direct key <b>finding</b> <b>from</b> MIDI 41. 73 % of the time, and achieves an overall maximum correct rate of 75. 25 % (compared to 80. 34 % for MIDI key finding) ...|$|R
5|$|In 1998, the National Cancer Institute {{undertook}} a large study, using cancer case {{information from the}} Institute's SEER database.

Another large study in Sweden examined cancer rates of 700,000 individuals who had received potentially contaminated polio vaccine as late as 1957; the study again revealed no increased cancer incidence between persons who received polio vaccines containing SV40 and those who did not. The question of whether SV40 causes cancer in humans remains controversial however, and the development of improved assays for detection of SV40 in human tissues will be needed to resolve the controversy.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, {{a series}} of Historical Public Exposure Studies were {{conducted}} to assess past releases and public exposures. For example, the figure at right illustrates the calculated lifetime cancer risk to a laborer from the 1957 Rocky Flats fire. The key shows the cancer risk due to exposure during the 1957 event per million persons. This figure means that an outdoor laborer in the reddest part of Arvada would have roughly a two-in-a-million risk of contracting cancer (0.000002) from being outside during the 1957 fire. The original, complete figure - {{as well as many}} others showing the risks of past exposures - can be viewed in the Summary of <b>Findings</b> <b>from</b> the Historical Public Exposure Studies.|$|E
