40|$|The {{object of}} investigation: {{alkaloid}} of ergotoxine group, the preparation Abergine, the tablettes of Abergin, {{the raw material}} - sclerotia of ergot of the <b>ergotoxin</b> strains. The purpose of the work: {{the development of the}} complex analytic evaluation of the alkaloids of the <b>ergotoxin</b> group, of the analytic ensurance of the technology of production and standardization of the preparation Abergin. The optimum parameters and the conditions of separation of the alkaloids, the direction of its destruction have been determined, the method of detection of ergoalkaloids has been developed, the characteristic signals of the ergoalkaloids protons have been revealed and its dependence on its chemical shift from the solvent to be used. The methods of the qualitative and quantitative determination of ergoalkaloids in preparation Abergin, its medicinal form, technical half-products and raw material have been offered. The alkaloid composition in 10 strains of ergot has been established. The subject of introduction: the methods of quality control of the substantion and tablettes of Abergin - VES 42 - 2244 - 93, VES 42 - 2245 - 93 and STP 64 - 10 - 39 - 47 - 93. The introduction of the obtained results allows to realize the manufacture of the country dopaminergic means and to increase the assortment of preparations, possessing the neurohormonal activity. The field of application: the control-analytic laboratories, the chemico-pharmaceutic productions, the pharmacetic faculties of the Higher Schools, the enterprises of the forensic expertiseAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|E
40|$|One hundred {{patients}} {{suffering from}} sustained arterial hypertension were studied {{over a period}} of two years during which time the action of parenterally administered hydrogenated ergot alka-loids (Hydergine) constituted the main drug therapy. An immediate transient reduction of both the arterial blood pressure and the pulse rate was demonstrated in over 80 per cent of the entire group within a period of two hours. The average reduction in systolic and diastolic pressure was 36 mm. and 12 mm., respectively, and the pulse rate was reduced 6 beats per minute. Of interest was a group of 22 patients presenting evidence of early central vascular derangement in whom these alkaloids seemed to accomplish their best therapeutic action and possibly aborted what may have been a sustained cerebral accident. Untoward effects were minimal because of rapid dissipation of the drug, and its use in all types of hypertensive disease was deemed safe in the rec-ommended dosage. IN the evaluation of depressor drugs for the palliation of arterial hypertension the selective action of each must be given prime consideration. The syndrome of arterial hypertension is due to the action of a pressor substance, the origin and composition of which may vary as may its strength and choice of effector. Stoll and Hofman ' first demonstrated three alkaloids contained in <b>ergotoxin,</b> namely; ergocornine, ergokriptine and ergocrystine. They found that one of the double bonds of the lysergic acid component contained in each could easily be hydrogenated. Later, Roth-lin 2,' 3, 4 and others found that these hydro-genated alkaloids were stable and had selective properties so far as the circulatory system was concerned. These consisted of central vasodila-tor effect, in the main, and a sympatholytic or adrenolytic effect peripherally. Recent studies by Barcroft, Konzett an...|$|E
