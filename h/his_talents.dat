5|$|In Paris, Chopin {{encountered}} {{artists and}} other distinguished figures, and found {{many opportunities to}} exercise <b>his</b> <b>talents</b> and achieve celebrity. During his years in Paris he was to become acquainted with, among many others, Hector Berlioz, Franz Liszt, Ferdinand Hiller, Heinrich Heine, Eugène Delacroix, and Alfred de Vigny. Chopin was also acquainted with the poet Adam Mickiewicz, principal of the Polish Literary Society, some of whose verses he set as songs.|$|E
5|$|Rimsky-Korsakov became {{especially}} appreciated within The Five, {{and among}} those who visited the circle, for <b>his</b> <b>talents</b> as an orchestrator. He was asked by Balakirev to orchestrate a Schubert march for a concert in May 1868, by Cui to orchestrate the opening chorus of his opera William Ratcliff and by Alexander Dargomyzhsky, whose works were greatly appreciated by The Five and who was close to death, to orchestrate his opera The Stone Guest.|$|E

5|$|Between 1769 and 1773, {{the young}} Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart {{and his father}} Leopold Mozart made three Italian journeys. The first, an {{extended}} tour of 15 months, was financed by performances for the nobility and by public concerts, and took in the most important Italian cities. The second and third journeys were to Milan, for Wolfgang to complete operas that had been commissioned there on the first visit. From the perspective of Wolfgang's musical development the journeys were a considerable success, and <b>his</b> <b>talents</b> were recognised by honours which included a papal knighthood and memberships in leading philharmonic societies.|$|E
5|$|Harvey's {{performances}} were rewarded with selection for an Australian XI in a tour match against the England cricket {{team at the}} start of the 1954–55 season. However, the match was curtailed by rain and Harvey was not able to exhibit <b>his</b> <b>talents</b> on a sticky wicket highly difficult for batting. Listed at No. 4, Harvey came in after the dismissal of his brother and made seven in his only innings. As a result, Ray was not chosen for the Test team alongside his brother during the season.|$|E
5|$|His socialist {{activism}} monopolised his time, {{forcing him}} to abandon a translation of the Persian Shahnameh. It also led to him seeing far less of Burne-Jones, {{with whom he had}} strong political differences; although once a republican, Burne-Jones had become increasingly conservative, and felt that the DF were exploiting Morris for <b>his</b> <b>talents</b> and influence. While Morris devoted much time to trying to convert his friends to the cause, of Morris' circle of artistic comrades, only Webb and Faulkner fully embraced socialism, while Swinburne expressed his sympathy with it.|$|E

Mr. Svetlev participated in the tours of The Metropolitan Opera Guild. He also sang classical programs worldwide, accompanied by his wife, pianist Zornitza Svetlev.|$|R
5|$|When first {{exhibited}} in 1832, The Destroying Angel was widely praised for its technical brilliance, but critics were {{divided on the}} subject matter. Some praised its vividness and ability to mix fear and beauty without lowering into tastelessness; others criticised its thematic matter as inappropriate, and chastised Etty for wasting <b>his</b> <b>talents.</b> The painting changed {{the manner in which}} art critics viewed the artist; some saw it as indicating previously unseen character depths, others considered it a renunciation of his previous works. In 1854 Henry Payne, who had commissioned the painting, sold it to Sir Joseph Whitworth. Whitworth donated it in 1882 to the Manchester Art Gallery, where it remains.|$|E
5|$|Within a {{month of}} his {{appointment}} Granby resigned the leadership in the Commons, feeling himself inadequate to the post, and the party functioned without {{a leader in the}} Commons {{for the rest of the}} parliamentary session. At the start of the next session, affairs were handled by a triumvirate of Granby, Disraeli, and John Charles Herries—indicative of the tension between Disraeli and the rest of the party, who needed <b>his</b> <b>talents</b> but mistrusted him. This confused arrangement ended with Granby's resignation in 1851; Disraeli effectively ignored the two men regardless.|$|E
5|$|After {{his final}} season at Michigan, Robinson {{stated that he}} was open to playing any {{position}} in the National Football League. Some suggested {{that he would have}} a better chance of being drafted by an NFL team if he switched to cornerback, receiver, running back or kick returner because of his quickness – 4.35 in the 40 yard dash. CBS Sports' Mike Freeman said <b>his</b> <b>talents</b> would be wasted on the defensive side of the ball. Doug Flutie (Buffalo Bills) and Dieter Brock (Los Angeles Rams) were relatively successful quarterbacks similar in stature to Robinson. Russell Wilson who currently plays starting quarterback for the Seattle Seahawks is also similar in stature to Robinson.|$|E

5|$|As a {{commercial}} entity, Messi's marketing brand {{has been based}} exclusively on <b>his</b> <b>talents</b> and achievements as a player, in contrast to arguably more glamorous players like Cristiano Ronaldo and David Beckham. At {{the start of his}} career, he thus mainly held sponsorship contracts with companies that employ sports-oriented marketing, such as Adidas, Pepsi, and Konami. From 2010 onwards, concurrently with his increased achievements as a player, his marketing appeal widened, leading to long-term endorsement deals with luxury brands Dolce & Gabbana and Audemars Piguet. Messi is also a global brand ambassador for Gillette, Turkish Airlines, Ooredoo, and Tata Motors, among other companies. Additionally, Messi was the face of Konami's video game series Pro Evolution Soccer, appearing on the covers of PES 2009, PES 2010 and PES 2011. He subsequently signed with rival company EA Sports to become the face of their series FIFA and has since appeared on four consecutive covers from FIFA 13 to FIFA 16.|$|E
5|$|Bartender Sam Malone (Ted Danson) {{has been}} jealous {{of his brother}} Derek, who is more successful, better-educated, multi-talented and handsome, for years, and discovers that he is {{arriving}} in Boston on his private jet. Meanwhile, co-bartender Coach (Nicholas Colasanto) is offered a coaching job in Venezuela requiring fluency in Spanish. Derek (an unseen character voiced by George Ball) arrives unexpectedly {{at the bar and}} entertains the patrons with <b>his</b> <b>talents,</b> which include singing, playing a pool table, tap dancing and telling stories. Derek offers a job to regular patron Norm (George Wendt), teaches Coach Spanish (increasing his chances of being hired) and impresses waitress Diane (Shelley Long) with their common interests. Diane and Derek pair off (which bothers Sam). During his date with Debbie (Deborah Shelton), Sam hears Derek's private jet, where he carries Diane along.|$|E
5|$|In New York City, a {{group of}} {{teenagers}} audition to study at the High School of Performing Arts, where they are sorted into three different departments: Drama, Music and Dance. Accepted in the Drama department are Montgomery MacNeil, a closeted homosexual, Doris Finsecker, a shy Jewish girl, and Ralph Garci, who succeeds after failed auditions for Music and Dance. In the Music department, Bruno Martelli is an aspiring keyboardist whose electronic equipment horrifies Mr. Shorofsky, a conservative music teacher. Lisa Monroe is accepted in the Dance department, despite having {{no interest in the}} subject. Coco Hernandez is accepted in all three departments because of her all-around talent. Leroy Johnson goes to the school, performing as part of a dance routine for an auditioning friend, but the dance teachers are more impressed by <b>his</b> <b>talents</b> than hers.|$|E

5|$|Meredith had to {{deal with}} {{extremely}} physical defences, and was often boxed into the corner of the pitch by as many as four players. As <b>his</b> <b>talents</b> became widely regarded, more well organised defences would designate him with a man-marker, to try and isolate him from his teammates. This often left him reliant on an unselfish inside-right partner willing to fetch and carry the ball for him without expecting much in terms of goals or glory in return. A hard-working wing-half would also improve Meredith's effectiveness by winning the ball and sending him a pass down the flank. The best teams he played in also had a centre-forward able {{to make the most of}} his accurate crosses.|$|E
5|$|That year, William Stearn {{succeeded in}} obtaining a {{scholarship}} to the local Cambridge High School for Boys on Hills Road, close to the Cambridge Botanic Garden, which he attended for eight years till he was eighteen. The school had an excellent reputation for biology education, {{and while he was}} there, he was encouraged by Mr Eastwood, a biology teacher who recognised <b>his</b> <b>talents.</b> The school also provided him with a thorough education in both Latin and Greek. He became secretary of the school Natural History Society, won an essay prize from the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and spent much of his time at the Botanic Garden. Stearn also gained horticultural experience by working as a gardener's boy during his school holidays, to supplement the family income.|$|E
5|$|The film {{serves as}} a satire of the social conditions, {{dominant}} practices, and ideologies of Hollywood, {{as well as the}} film industry's perceived mistreatment of actors. Filmmaking was becoming more expensive and requiring larger technical resources, particularly with the rise of sound production, making it increasingly difficult for amateur filmmakers to enter the profession. This deepened a divide between amateurs and Hollywood professionals, and as a result, a growing number of amateurs started lampooning Hollywood in their films, including A Hollywood Extra. The subject of the film is an extra who starts his Hollywood career with hopes and dreams, but ultimately finds himself used and discarded by the industry, and his artistic ambitions destroyed. At the start of the film, the protagonist has a name (Mr. Jones) and a letter of recommendation outlining <b>his</b> <b>talents,</b> but his abilities are ignored and he is reduced to a number, symbolizing his dehumanization.|$|E

50|$|<b>His</b> <b>talent</b> lies in same {{straight}} line with how an actor {{should be in}} Malayalam - learning from his experience and mistakes.

5|$|The {{main source}} of {{information}} concerning Haakon is the Saga of Haakon Haakonsson which {{was written in the}} immediate years following his death. Commissioned by his son Magnus, it was written by the Icelandic writer and politician Sturla Þórðarson (nephew of the famous historian Snorri Sturluson). Having come into conflict with the royal representative in Iceland, Sturla came to Norway in 1263 in an attempt to reconcile with Haakon. When he arrived, he learned that Haakon was in Scotland, and that Magnus ruled Norway in his place. While Magnus initially took an unfriendly attitude towards Sturla, <b>his</b> <b>talents</b> as a story-teller and skald eventually won him the favour of Magnus and his men. The saga is considered the most detailed and reliable of all sagas concerning Norwegian kings, building on both written archive material and oral information from individuals who had been close to Haakon. It is nonetheless written openly in support of the political program of the House of Sverre, and the legitimacy of Haakon's kingship.|$|E
