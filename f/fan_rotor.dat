2500|$|In July 2014 {{there was}} an {{uncontained}} failure [...] of a <b>fan</b> <b>rotor</b> while the aircraft was preparing for take-off. The parts passed through a fuel tank and caused a fire, grounding the F-35 fleet. During high g-force maneuvering three weeks before flight, there was excessive rubbing at the seal between the fan blisk and the fan stator causing the failure. The engine [...] "flex" [...] generated a temperature of over 1,000°C (1,900°F) in materials designed to fail at 540°C (1,000°F). Micro cracks appeared in third-stage fan blades, according to program manager Christopher Bogdan, causing blades to separate from the disk. The failed blades punctured the fuel cell and hot air mixing with jet fuel caused the fire. As a short term fix, each aircraft is flown on a specific flight profile to allow the rotor seal to wear a mating groove in the stator to prevent excessive rubbing.|$|E
50|$|Some low-bypass ratio {{military}} turbofans (e.g. F404) have variable {{inlet guide}} vanes to direct air onto the first <b>fan</b> <b>rotor</b> stage. This improves the fan surge margin (see compressor map).|$|E
50|$|Low {{specific}} thrust {{is achieved by}} replacing the multi-stage fan with a single-stage unit.

40|$|The overall {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop a 3 -D numerical analysis for compressor casing treatment flowfields, and to perform a series of detailed numerical predictions to assess the effectiveness of various endwall treatments for enhancing the efficiency and stall margin of modern high speed <b>fan</b> <b>rotors.</b> Particular attention was given to examining the effectiveness of endwall treatments to counter the undesirable effects of inflow distortion. Calculations were performed using three different gridding techniques based on the type of casing treatment being tested and the level of complexity desired in the analysis. In each case, the casing treatment itself is modeled as a discrete object in the overall analysis, and the flow through the casing treatment is determined as part of the solution. A series of calculations were performed for both treated and untreated modern <b>fan</b> <b>rotors</b> both with and without inflow distortion. The effectiveness of the various treatments were quantified, and several physical mechanisms by which the effectiveness of endwall treatments is achieved are discussed...|$|R

50|$|Today, a {{conventional}} turbofan featuring a T-staged fan {{would have an}} overhung <b>fan</b> <b>rotor</b> (without any inlet guide vanes), followed {{by one or more}} T-stages supercharging the core stream alone. The name T-staged fan is derived from the overall appearance of the LP compressor when the side elevation is shown diagrammatically.|$|E
50|$|Variable pitch {{on-the-fly}} {{axial fans}} - These {{are similar to}} “Variable Pitch Axial Fans” except they include an internal mechanism that allows the blade pitch to be adjusted while the <b>fan</b> <b>rotor</b> is in motion. These versatile fans offer high-efficiency operation at many different points of operation. This instantaneous blade adjustment capability is an advantage that is possible with axial fans only.|$|E
50|$|GE took a {{different}} approach with their first high bypass ratio turbofan, the TF39. A unique, very complex design; the T-stage, which supercharges the core stream, is located ahead of the main <b>fan</b> <b>rotor.</b> The T-stage itself comprises an overhung mini-rotor followed {{by a set of}} outlet guide vanes; the main <b>fan</b> <b>rotor</b> is located immediately behind these OGV's. Outboard of the T-stage rotor are the main inlet guide vanes, which only affect the bypass stream. The T-stage rotor extends to about half the main rotor stage annulus and runs in a tip shroud. The main fan stage has a mid-span platform/flow splitter which separates the single-stage outer annulus from the 2-stage inner annulus. These two stages mainly supercharge the 16-stage high-pressure compressor. However, a fair proportion of the air entering the T-stage is bled off into the bypass duct, there being two annular passages leading to the bypass duct. The nominal bypass ratio of 8:1 must refer to the ratio of total bypass mass flow to HP compressor entry mass flow.|$|E

50|$|A {{turbomolecular pump}} {{is a type}} of vacuum pump, superficially similar to a turbopump, used to obtain and {{maintain}} high vacuum. These pumps work on the principle that gas molecules can be given momentum in a desired direction by repeated collision with a moving solid surface.

50|$|Corden-Lloyd, as {{commanding}} officer, {{along with}} Captain Philip Schofield and Sergeant Ives flew in a Gazelle helicopter {{from the base}} at Bessbrook Mill to assess the situation and provide information to the troops. While flying low and fast over {{the scene of the}} engagement, the aircraft came under fire from the IRA. The pilot executed a torque turn and, in so doing, stalled his tail fenestron <b>fan</b> <b>rotor</b> and lost control of the aircraft. The helicopter crashed into the field bordered by the March Wall, some 700 meters from Jonesborough. Corden-Lloyd was killed instantly, while the other two passengers were wounded.|$|E
50|$|On July 19, 1989, United Airlines Flight 232, a McDonnell Douglas DC-10-10, {{experienced}} an uncontained failure of its No. 2 engine stage 1 <b>fan</b> <b>rotor</b> disk assembly. The engine fragments severed the No. 1 and No. 3 hydraulic system lines. Forces {{from the engine}} failure fractured the No. 2 hydraulic system line. With the loss of all three hydraulic-powered flight control systems, safe landing was impossible. The lack of independence of the three hydraulic systems, although physically isolated, left them vulnerable to a single failure event due to their close proximity to one another. This was a zonal hazard. The aircraft crashed after diversion to Sioux Gateway Airport in Sioux City, Iowa, with 111 fatalities, 47 serious injuries and 125 minor injuries.|$|E
40|$|Blade-to-blade {{velocity}} distributions {{based on}} laser velocimeter data acquired in compressor or <b>fan</b> <b>rotors</b> are increasingly used as benchmark {{data for the}} verification and calibration of turbomachinery computational fluid dynamics (CFD) codes. Using laser Doppler velocimeter (LDV) data for this purpose, however, must be done cautiously. Aside from the still not fully resolved issue of the seed particle response in complex flowfields, {{there is an important}} inherent difference between CFD predictions and LDV blade-to-blade velocity distributions. CFD codes calculate velocity fields for an idealized rotor passage. LDV data, on the other hand, stem from the actual geometry of all blade channels in a rotor. The geometry often varies from channel to channel as a result of manufacturing tolerances, assembly tolerances, and incurred operational damage or changes in the rotor individual blades...|$|R

The additional loss attributable to the damper and the total region along the blade height influenced were correlated with selected aerodynamic and geometric parameters. The maximum damper loss correlated well with the mean inlet Mach number at the damper location, the geometric parameters of leading- and trailing-edge damper radius normalized by mean passage height and damper aerodynamic chord, respectively, and the aerodynamic loading parameter of the blade camber divided by the solidity at the damper location. The region of damper influence extended over a mean passage height {{of the order of}} 10 to 15 times the maximum damper thickness...|$|R
40|$|The {{experimental}} {{performance of}} 10 transonic <b>fan</b> <b>rotors</b> {{was used to}} correlate losses caused by midchord part-span dampers (PSD) during off-design operation between 50 and 100 percent of design speed. The design tip speed for the rotors used varied from 419 to 425 m/s and the design pressure ratios from 1. 6 to 2. 0. The loss attributable to the damper and the region influenced along the blade height was correlated with relevant aerodynamic and geometric parameters. The losses at the design point were estimated by a previously reported correlation (Roberts, 1978). Using this as a base, the off-design losses were correlated with variation in blade suction surface incidence. A check with independent data showed that the prediction of damper losses and region of influence was fair to good {{for most of the}} off-design data examined...|$|R
5000|$|A General Electric F404 {{military}} turbofan {{was used}} {{as the basis for the}} GE36. The F404 mixed exhaust stream discharged through a turbine which drove two counter rotating stages of 10 and 8 fan blades each (originally 8 and 8). The scimitar shape of the <b>fan</b> <b>rotor</b> blades can operate at speeds up to Mach [...]75, about 575 mph at sea level. The power turbine was a seven-stage (initially 6-stage) turbine plus inlet and outlet guide vanes. The fourteen turbine blade rows rotated alternate rows in opposite directions. Each stage was a pair of rotors (there were no stators). The counter-rotating turbine ran at half the rpm of a conventional turbine so did not require a reduction gearbox to drive the fan.|$|E

5000|$|Although {{nowhere near}} as {{successful}} as the Pratt & Whitney JT3D, the CJ805-23 was a very advanced engine for its time (late 50's). Like the JT3D, the CJ805-23 was a turbofan derived from a turbojet. General Electric's approach {{was to take the}} single spool CJ805-3 turbojet and incorporate an aft fan/turbine system into the exhaust system. Each turbine blade {{was an integral part of}} a blucket, the outboard section of which was a <b>fan</b> <b>rotor</b> blade. Running freely on a stub shaft, a series of bluckets, mounted on a disc, made up the aft rotor assembly. The efflux from the turbojet expanded through the (inner) turbine annulus. thus providing power directly to the fan blades located in the outer annulus. A full-length cowl, an annular exhaust system and a bucket thrust-reverser were fitted for the Convair 990. A relatively short fan cowl and thrust reverser [...] was used to demonstrate the engine on the Sud Aviation Caravelle. The CJ805-23, if chosen, would have replaced the Rolls-Royce Avon. Rolls-Royce quickly built and tested an aft-fan demonstrator Avon to compete with the greater thrust and lower sfc of the CJ805-23. In the end the Caravelle was re-engined with the P&W JT8D turbofan.|$|E
40|$|A {{principal}} {{source of}} turbomachinery noise is {{the interaction of}} the rotating and stationary blade rows with the perturbations in the airstream through the engine. As such, a lot of research has been devoted {{to the study of the}} turbomachinery noise generation mechanisms. This is particularly true of <b>fan</b> and open <b>rotors,</b> both of which are the major contributors to the overall noise output of modern aircraft engines. Much of the research in <b>fan</b> and open <b>rotor</b> noise has been focused on developing theoretical models for predicting their noise characteristics. These models, which run the gamut from the semi-empirical to fully computational ones, are, in one form or another, informed by the description of the unsteady flow-field in which the propulsors (i. e., the <b>fan</b> and open <b>rotors)</b> operate. Not surprisingly, the fidelity of the theoretical models is dependent, to a large extent, on capturing the nuances of the unsteady flowfield that have a direct role in the noise generation process. As such, flow diagnostic techniques have proven to be indispensible in identifying the shortcoming of theoretical models and in helping to improve them. This presentation will provide a few examples of the role of flow diagnostic techniques in assessing the fidelity and robustness of the <b>fan</b> and open <b>rotor</b> noise prediction models...|$|R

50|$|Blisk {{manufacturing}} {{has been}} used since the mid-1980s. It was first used by Sermatech-Lehr (now known as GKN Aerospace) in 1985 for the compressors of the T700 helicopter engine.

50|$|One SST VCE {{concept is}} the Tandem Fan engine. The engine has two fans, both {{mounted on the}} {{low-pressure}} shaft, with a significant axial gap between the units. In normal flight, the engine is in the series mode, with the flow leaving the front fan passing directly into the second fan, the engine behaving much like a normal turbofan. However, for take-off, climb-out, final-descent and approach, the front fan is allowed to discharge directly through an auxiliary nozzle {{on the underside of}} the powerplant nacelle. Auxiliary intakes are opened on each side of the powerplant, allowing air to enter the rear fan and progress through the rest of the engine. Operating the fans in this parallel mode substantially increases the total airflow of the engine at a thrust, resulting in a lower jet velocity and a quieter engine. Back in the 1970s, Boeing modified a Pratt & Whitney JT8D to a Tandem Fan configuration and successfully demonstrated the switch from series to parallel operation (and vice versa) with the engine running, albeit at part power. In the Mid Tandem Fan concept, a high specific flow single stage fan is located between the high pressure (HP) and low pressure (LP) compressors of a turbojet core. Only bypass air is allowed to pass through the fan, the LP compressor exit flow passing through special passages within the fan disc, directly underneath the <b>fan</b> <b>rotor</b> blades. Some of the bypass air enters the engine via an auxiliary intake. During take-off and approach the engine behaves much like a normal civil turbofan, with an acceptable jet noise level (i.e., low specific thrust). However, for supersonic cruise, the fan variable inlet guide vanes and auxiliary intake close-off to minimize bypass flow and increase specific thrust. In this mode the engine acts more like a 'leaky' turbojet (e.g. the F404).|$|E

40|$|Common blade design {{techniques}} {{are based on}} the assumption of the airflow laying on cylindrical surfaces. This behav- iour is proper only for free-vortex flow, whereas radial fluid migration along the span is always present in case of controlled vortex design blades. The paper presents a design procedure to increase aeraulic efficiency of <b>fan</b> <b>rotors</b> originally designed using a controlled vortex criterion, {{based on the assumption that}} a blade section positioning taking into account the actual airflow direction could be beneficial for rotor aeraulic performance. The proposed procedure employs a three-dimensional aerofoil positioning and blade forward sweep. The procedure is applied to a rotor-only tube-axial fan featuring a 0. 44 hub-to-tip ratio, an almost constant swirl velocity distribution at the rotor outlet and a quite low blade Reynolds number. Rotor prototypes deriving from step-by-step blade modifications are experimentally tested on an ISO 5801 standard test rig.

The consequences of bird impact can be severe and, therefore, the aircraft components have to be certified for a proven level of bird impact resistance before being put into service. The <b>fan</b> <b>rotor</b> blades of aeroengine are the components being easily impacted by birds. It is necessary to ensure that the <b>fan</b> <b>rotor</b> blades should have adequate resistance against the bird impact, to reduce the flying accidents caused by bird impacts. Using the contacting-impacting algorithm, the numerical simulation is carried out to simulate bird impact. A three-blade computational model is set up for the <b>fan</b> <b>rotor</b> blade having shrouds. The transient response curves of the points corresponding to measured points in experiments, displacements and equivalent stresses on the blades are obtained during the simulation. From the comparison of the transient response curves obtained from numerical simulation with that obtained from experiments, it can be found that the variations in measured points and the corresponding points of simulation are basically the same. The deforming process, the maximum displacements and the maximum equivalent stresses on blades are analyzed. The numerical simulation verifies and complements the experiment results...|$|E

Using ANSYS-CFX and SolidWorks, the cross-flow fan was modeled computationally and tested at 8, 000 rpm. A parametric study determined optimum blade stagger angle using thrust, power, and thrust-to-power ratio as desired output variables. A MarkForged Mark One 3 D printer was used to print components of a carbon-fiber composite cross-flow <b>fan</b> <b>rotor.</b> These pieces were assembled and the thrust, power, and thrust-to-power ratio of the 3 D printed rotor were measured. These performance characteristics were compared to a rotor of the same geometry previously manufactured from traditional carbon fiber components. The optimum stagger angle for the current 26 -bladed, 101. 6 mm (4 inch) diameter rotor was determined to be 10 ¡ forward of its previous position. The 3 D printed rotor was found to produce less thrust, but also required less power. This was thought to be caused by the outward deflection of the rotor blades due to centripetal force in conjunction with the surface roughness of the blades.

However, the published literature is not always unanimous in quantifying these effects and still lacks of clearly outlined design criteria.
