500|$|Fighting {{tactics are}} governed by several actual rules and enforcers will also adopt {{informal}} tactics particular to their style and personality. One tactic adopted by players is known as [...] "going for it", in which the player puts {{his head down and}} just throws as many punches as he can, as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>can.</b> In the process, that player takes as many punches as he delivers, although some of them are to the hard forehead. Fighters usually must keep one hand on their opponent's jersey since the ice surface makes maintaining balance very difficult. For this reason, the majority of a hockey fight consists of the players holding on with one hand and punching with the other.|$|E
2500|$|Mark Spitz {{is quoted}} as saying, [...] "When I went to the Olympics, I had every {{intention}} of shaving the moustache off, but I realized I was getting so many comments about it—and everybody was talking about it—that I decided to keep it. [...] I had some fun with a Russian coach who asked me if my moustache slowed me down. [...] I said, 'No, {{as a matter of}} fact, it deflects water away from my mouth, allows my rear end to rise and make me bullet-shaped in the water, and that's what had allowed me to swim so great.' [...] He's translating as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> for the other coaches, and the following year every Russian male swimmer had a moustache." ...|$|E

"Most {{guys are}} relaxed, but I {{look up and}} I see Kellen, and he's... going 110 miles an hour," [...] said 2013–14 Butler Bulldogs first year head coach Brandon Miller during an August {{overseas}} basketball tour. [...] "Sprinting {{up and down the}} court. Shooting pull-ups. Going as hard and <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> possible <b>can.</b> <b>He</b> goes at a pace, whether its shootaround in Australia, 17 minutes into practice or two hours into practice, that never changes." ...|$|R

6000|$|We {{are more}} edified {{by the energy}} with which Rousseau refused {{connivance}} with the public outrages on morality perpetrated by a patron. M. d'Epinay went to pay him a visit at the Hermitage, taking with him two ladies with whom his relations were less than equivocal, and for whom among other things he had given Rousseau music to copy. [...] "They were curious to see the eccentric man," [...] as M. d'Epinay afterwards told his scandalised wife, for {{it was in the}} manners of the day on no account to parade even the most notorious of these unblessed connections. [...] "He was walking in front of the door; he saw me first; he advanced cap in hand; he saw the ladies; he saluted us, put on his cap, turned his back, and stalked off <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> could. <b>Can</b> anything be more mad?"[266] In the miserable and intricate tangle of falsity, weakness, sensuality, and quarrel, which make up this chapter in Rousseau's life, we are glad of even one trait of masculine robustness. We should perhaps be still more glad if the unwedded Theresa were not visible in the background of this scene of high morals.|$|R
5|$|A {{monument}} to Civil War Union General John Sedgwick {{stands on the}} outskirts of the Plain. Sedgwick's bronze statue has spurs with rowels that freely rotate. Legend states that if a cadet is in danger of failing a class, they are to don their full-dress parade uniform the night before the final exam. The cadet visits the statue and spins the rowels at the stroke of midnight. Then the cadet runs back to the barracks <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> or she <b>can.</b> According to legend, if Sedgwick's ghost catches them, they will fail the exam. Otherwise the cadet will pass the exam and the course. Although being out of their rooms after midnight is officially against regulations, violations have been known to be overlooked for the sake of tradition.|$|R

Every passenger seems like a parcel holding his string as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> about him, lest {{one corner of the}} wrapper should come undone and reveal what is inside. And every other passenger is forced, by the public will, to hold himself as tight-bound also. Which in the end becomes a sort of self-conscious madness.|$|E
50|$|While the off-roaders are tough, they cannot absorb {{unlimited}} damage. Players must {{waste time}} fixing their off-roaders {{in case of}} a trouble situation with either the engine or other vital automobile parts. The player has the choice of either practicing any of the ten levels in the game or starting a full race once he or she has practice all the moves. In addition, the player has to watch out for his or her fuel consumption. If he or she runs out of fuel, then he or she has to retire from the race or practice session. Like all Japanese games, the speed gauge of the player's vehicle is in kilometers. Through desert, snow, paved, and unpaved roads, the player must race from Paris to Moscow and finally to Beijing <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> or she <b>can</b> in order to become the best rally racer in the world.|$|R

"Well; let us hurry {{over this}} part of the story <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> we <b>can.</b> <b>He</b> did slay this pure young girl; he took her into the wood near the house, an old wood that is {{standing}} yet, with some of its magnificent oaks; and then he plunged a dagger into her heart, after they had had a very tender and loving talk together, in which he had tried to open the matter tenderly to her, and make her understand that, though he was to slay her, it was really for the very reason that he loved her better than anything else in the world, and that he would far rather die himself, if that would answer the purpose at all. Indeed, he is said to have offered her the alternative of slaying him, and taking upon herself the burden of indefinite life, and the studies and pursuits by which he meant to benefit mankind. But she, it is said,--this noble, pure, loving child,--she looked up into his face and smiled sadly, and then snatching the dagger from him, she plunged it into her own heart. I cannot tell whether this be true, or whether she waited to be killed by him; but this I know, that in the same circumstances I think I should have saved my lover or my friend the pain of killing me. There she lay dead, at any rate, and he buried her in the wood, and returned to the house; and, <b>as</b> it happened, <b>he</b> had set his right foot in her blood, and his shoe was wet in it, and by some miraculous fate it left a track all along the wood-path, and into the house, and on the stone steps of the threshold, and up into his chamber, all along; and the servants saw it the next day, and wondered, and whispered, and missed the fair young girl, and looked askance at their lord's right foot, and turned pale, all of them, as death.|$|R

60|$|The pearl-diver descends by {{the help}} of a long rope, to the end of which is {{attached}} a heavy stone.
