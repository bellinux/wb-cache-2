The current lack of transparency around lobbying activities {{and the absence of}} formal regulation mean that a hidden lobbying problem may prevail. The tentative case study of green industries in the EU is illustrative. The wind turbine industry, for example, benefits from ambitious <b>environmental</b> <b>target</b> levels for greenhouse gas reductions that will increase the future market for renewable energy.

To address the growing national environment and energy concerns, leaders introduced several binding <b>environmental</b> <b>targets</b> for government departments and large enterprises. The {{heavy reliance on}} a target-based implementation approach {{raises questions about the}} effectiveness of this strategy in the short and long run for environmental governance in China.

The <b>environmental</b> <b>target</b> is of the safety-first type, which requires probabilistic emissions control. One market is built around the trading ratio, which defines the substitution rate between stochastic and deterministic pollution, and is modeled on existing markets for water quality trading. The other market is built around a new definition of the pollution credit as a multi-attribute good, where the attributes supply information to the market on the environmental risks associated with stochastic pollution loads. The market with multi-attribute credits is found to out-perform the trading ratio market in its ability to satisfy the safety-first <b>environmental</b> <b>target</b> at least cost. This result comes about because polluters are able to directly price risk in this market.

40|$|The {{implementation}} {{schedule for the}} EU water framework directive requires the creation of monitoring programmes for water bodies according to {{the intensity of the}} pollution risk by the end of 2006. Until 2009 river basin district management programmes have to be established followed by the implementation of measures from the management plans (until 2012). The WAgriCo-project (Water Resources Management in Cooperation with Agriculture), is a collaborative project funded by the European Commission Life Fund within the period October 2005 to September 2008, involving six British and four German institutions. The WAgriCo-project is based around the catchment management process, of identifying diffuse pollution issues and potential management solutions, involving land managers/advisors to implement methods and to assess their effectiveness in terms of pollution reduction and costs. For a basic understanding of the interactions between these issues an integrated hydrological/hydrogeological conceptual model has been set up. The model consists of three main features: natural characteristic assessment, anthropogenic impact assessment using monitoring data and model tools providing a linkage between the first two parts. In this paper the application of the integrated hydrological/hydrogeological conceptual model for geographical prioritization and determination of <b>environmental</b> <b>target</b> areas in the case study area Grosse Aue in the Federal State of Lower Saxony, Germany is described and discussed. It is demonstrated how area differentiated parameters like the denitrification condition in soils, the runoff ratio, nitrate concentrations in the leachate and groundwater monitoring data are determined and combined in order to determine target areas.

40|$|Policy makers {{as well as}} {{many economists}} {{recognize}} geological Carbon Capture and Sequestration (CCS) as a key option to avoid costly emission reduction. While an extreme perspective is to envision CCS as a magic bullet to solve the issue of climate change, the economics perspective is more balanced and see it {{as a part of a}} portfolio of mitigation actions. Besides, as any novel mitigation technology, CCS can be implemented with a twofold purpose; on one side it can substitute some other technological efforts to reach a given <b>environmental</b> <b>target.</b> On the other side, it offers the opportunity to go for additional emission reductions and reach a "safer" climate target. In order to balance these two possible utilizations of CCS and assess their respective effects on early policystrategies, we undertake a twofold numerical experiment. First, a cost-efficiency analysis is undertaken where CCS sole effect is substitution of other efforts. This is followed by a cost-benefit analysis where both purposes have to be balanced. We find that future availability of CCS is less a reason to relax near-term abatement efforts than what could be inferred from previous analyses. Moreover, cost-benefit analysis indicates that the <b>environmental</b> <b>target</b> should be more ambitious when CCS is included in the picture...|$|E

An integrative emission model is used to simulate the interactions between agricultural practice, nitrogen surpluses and the nitrogen flow through the soil and aquifer to the outflow into surface waters.
