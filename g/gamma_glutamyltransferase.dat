25|$|Mutations of the HFE gene {{account for}} 90% {{of the cases}} of non-transfusional iron overload. This gene is {{closely linked to the}} HLA-A3 locus. Homozygosity for the C282Y {{mutation}} is the most common genotype responsible for clinical iron accumulation, though heterozygosity for C282Y/H63D mutations, so-called compound heterozygotes, results in clinically evident iron overload. There is considerable debate regarding the penetrance—the probability of clinical expression of the trait given the genotype—is for clinical disease in HHC homozygotes. Most, if not all, males homozygous for HFE C282Y will show manifestations of liver dysfunction such as elevated liver-specific enzymes such as serum <b>gamma</b> <b>glutamyltransferase</b> (GGT) by late middle age. Homozygous females can delay the onset of iron accumulation because of iron loss through menstruation.|$|E
5000|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{there is strong}} {{evidence}} that high levels of consumption of kava beverage can result in scaly skin rash, weight loss, nausea, loss of appetite and indigestion. These adverse health effects, while significant, {{are considered to be}} reversible upon cessation of kava use. Other possible effects include sore red eyes, laziness, loss of sex drive and general poor health. No effect on cognition, which might be associated with the pharmacological activity of kava, has been identified. No information is available on the potential for kava beverage consumption to impact on the incidence of chronic disease. Moderate to high kava beverage consumption also produces a reversible increase in the liver enzyme <b>gamma</b> <b>glutamyltransferase</b> (GGT), which may be an early indicator of cholestasis. Clinical surveys in Aboriginal communities in northern Australia with a history of heavy kava use have not revealed any evidence of long-term liver damage associated with consumption of kava beverage.|$|E
50|$|In another study, {{choriocarcinoma}} {{cells were}} {{grown in the}} presence of 5-bromo-2’-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd) and results conveyed a 30- to 40- fold increase in alkaline phosphatase activity. This procedure of enhancing the activity of the enzyme is known as enzyme induction. The evidence shows that there is in fact activity of alkaline phosphatase in tumor cells, but it is minimal and needs to be enhanced. Results from this study further indicate that activities of this enzyme vary among the different choriocarcinoma cell lines and that the activity of the alkaline phosphatase protein in these cells is lower than in the non-malignant placenta cells. but levels are significantly higher in children and pregnant women. Blood tests should always be interpreted using the reference range from the laboratory that performed the test. High ALP levels can occur if the bile ducts are obstructed. Also, ALP increases if there is active bone formation occurring, as ALP is a byproduct of osteoblast activity (such as the case in Paget's disease of bone). Levels are also elevated in people with untreated coeliac disease. Lowered levels of ALP are less common than elevated levels. The source of elevated ALP levels can be deduced by obtaining serum levels of <b>gamma</b> <b>glutamyltransferase</b> (GGT). Concomitant increases of ALP with GGT should raise the suspicion of hepatobiliary disease.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background and Aim: The {{significance}} of serum <b>gamma</b> <b>glutamyltransferase</b> activity and its dynamics {{have not been}} well investigated in Asian patients with idiopathic neonatal hepatitis. This study aimed to explore the significance in Mainland China. Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed in 38 cases with a diagnosis of idiopathic neonatal hepatitis. Their prognosis was compared between low or high <b>gamma</b> <b>glutamyltransferase</b> groups, and the mechanics of biochemical parameters were analysed. Results: Poor prognosis was found in 5 out of 6 patients with low <b>gamma</b> <b>glutamyltransferase,</b> compared to 3 out of 32 patients with high <b>gamma</b> <b>glutamyltransferase</b> (P= 0. 001). Dynamic analysis found that serum <b>gamma</b> <b>glutamyltransferase</b> levels gradually rose to a peak and then normalised along with a remission of jaundice in patients with good prognosis. However, the serum <b>gamma</b> <b>glutamyltransferase</b> level was consistently low {{in spite of the}} fluctuations of bilirubin and aminotransferases level in 5 cases with poor prognosis. The <b>gamma</b> <b>glutamyltransferase</b> level was high at presentation and then decreased along with their clinical deterioration in the other 3 cases with poor prognosis.

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} Pregnancy {{outcome in}} hyperemesis gravidarum {{and the effect}} of metabolic, biochemical, hematological and clinical indicators of disease severity on outcome. Study Design: A retrospective study based on 166 women hospitalized for confirmed hyperemesis gravidarum from January 2004 to January 2005. For each woman, three controls matched for age, parity and ethnicity were obtained from our 2004 birth register. The effects of laboratory indicators of hyperemesis severity were separately analyzed within the hyperemesis gravidarum study group. Outcome measures include stillbirths, Apgar score, mode of delivery, low birthweight, preterm delivery, labor induction, pregnancy induced hypertension and gestational diabetes. Analysis was by t-test, Fisher's exact test and multivariable logistic regression analysis. Results: Women with hyperemesis had similar pregnancy outcome compared to controls. In the analysis of laboratory indicators of hyperemesis severity and pregnancy outcomes, hypokalemia (adjusted odds ratio AOR 2. 7 : 95 % confidence interval CI 1. 0 - 6. 8) was associated with emergency operative delivery, high creatinine (odds ratio 4. 4 : 95 % CI 1. 3 - 15) with labor induction and raised <b>gamma</b> <b>glutamyltransferase</b> (AOR 7. 5 : 95 % CI 1. 2 - 46) with the development of gestational diabetes.

40|$|The {{wet weight}} of the stomach, small intestine, caecum, and colon were {{significantly}} reduced (p less than 0. 001) in intravenously fed rats compared with orally fed controls. Human epidermal growth factor (urogastrone) reversed this atrophy. Detailed analysis of the small intestine showed a similar effect on intestinal crypt cell population, mitoses per crypt, and protein content. Brush border <b>gamma</b> <b>glutamyltransferase</b> and alpha glucosidase activities were reduced by up to 50 % throughout the small intestine of the animals fed intravenously. The specific activities (mU/mg protein) were unchanged, as a concomitant decrease in the tissue weight and protein content also occurred. Intestinal brush border enzyme activities in the rats treated with urogastrone-epidermal growth factor were restored to those seen in the orally fed rats except for alpha glucosidase activity in the proximal gut. In addition, the specific activity of <b>gamma</b> <b>glutamyltransferase</b> was highly significantly increased (p less than 0. 01) in all regions of the small intestine. Thus, although urogastrone administration prevents the decrease in brush border enzyme activity seen after the removal of luminal nutrition, the response seems to differ depending on the intestinal location, with the specific activities of some enzymes being higher than those seen in orally fed rats.

Histological analyses and quantification of biomarkers aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), <b>gamma</b> <b>glutamyltransferase</b> (γ-GT), bilirubin, creatinine and urea were performed for monitoring liver and kidney functions. the EOs of C. nepeta and F. vulgare showed very low toxicity suggesting their potential use as food supplement. Additionally, our studies point out the importance of the integration of C. nepeta and F. vugare in silvopastoral agroforestry systems, contributing to the animal health and profitability of livestock...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} is {{designed}} to investigate the anti-inflammatory potential of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) against carbosulfan (CB) -induced hepatic dysfunction in rats. Rats exposed to CB and NAC were examined for toxicity by assessing various biochemical alteration, inflammation (interferon gamma and leucocyte counts), and peroxidation marker, including in liver. Significant increases of blood alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and <b>gamma</b> <b>glutamyltransferase</b> (GGT) were detected in CB-treated rats. In addition, the level of pro-oxidative marker, such as malondialdehyde (MDA), was also increased. According to the results, rats exposed to CB showed a significant alteration in hepatic enzymes {{and an increase in}} the accumulation of lipid peroxidation index; also, CB induced an increase in pro-inflammatory cytokine in CB-treated rats when compared with their respective controls. Interestingly, administration of NAC to CB-treated rats attenuates the toxicity of CB, objectified by biochemical and oxidative improvement of liver. Thus, the present study reports {{for the first time that}} NAC could be a promising therapeutic agent against CB-induced liver impairment...|$|E
40|$|The present {{work was}} carried out to {{investigate}} the hepatoprotective effect of ginger, chicory and their mixture against carbon tetrachloride intoxication in rats. Carbon tetrachloride treatment significantly elevated the alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase and <b>gamma</b> <b>glutamyltransferase</b> activities and the serum triglycerides and cholesterol concentration as compared to control group. It also increased RBCs counts and Hb concentration, total or differential leucocytes counts. However it decreased platelet counts, platelet distribution width, mean platelet volume, platelet larger cell ratio. Methanol extract of ginger (250 and 500 mg/kg) and chicory (250 and 500 mg/kg) given alone or mixed (1 : 1 wt/wt) significantly restored the carbon tetrachloride-induced alterations in the biochemical and cellular constituents of blood. No toxic symptoms were reported in doses up to 5 g/kg. Alkaloids and/or nitrogenous bases, carbohydrates and/or glycosides, tannins, flavonoids, saponins and unsaturated sterols and/or triterpenes are the main active constituents of their methanol extract. The hepatoprotective effect of ginger and chicory was also confirmed by the histopathological examination of liver tissue...|$|E
