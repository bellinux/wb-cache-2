40|$|In {{this study}} we {{investigate}} the forward bias puzzle in EM {{in light of the}} lessons provided by previous financial crises. We perform an elaborate treatment of the structural breaks likely to populate EM exchange rates, and find that (i) break dates are associated with financial crises and (ii) the forward premium usually switches signs before and after the break date. Motivated by the slowly emerging empirical literature on carry trade returns and how important global risk aversion is in explaining the large unwindings of carry trades during crises, we further investigate the nonlinearities in the dynamics between the spot and forward rate allowing their relationship to be state-‐dependent on the level of global risk aversion, which we proxy using VIX. Our results show that UIP is violated for low levels of risk aversion but that deviations revert back to equilibrium for high levels of risk aversion. This phenomenon is in line with the popular carry trade activities. During crises, risk aversion is high and carry traders quickly unwind their positions to limit their FX exposure to risk and we observe a steep depreciation of the <b>investment</b> <b>currency.</b> As the economies recover, carry traders become active again increasing their FX exposure in high-‐yielding currencies causing an appreciation of the currency. Overall, our findings are in line with the widespread use of bias-‐trading strategies. This effectively challenges the concept of limits-‐to-‐speculation as an explanation for the forward bias puzzle in EM. 1...|$|E

A more flexible exchange rate regime would allow China to operate a more independent monetary policy, providing a useful buffer against domestic and external shocks.

There is negatively significant association between US dollar-based carry trade and US stock market while the relationship between yen-based carry trade and Japanese stock market is positive.

Currency portfolios differ from stock only portfolios in that a triangular relationship exists among foreign exchange rates to avoid arbitrage. Although the inclusion of such a constraint in the model {{would lead to a}} nonconvex problem, we show that by choosing ap-propriate uncertainty sets for the exchange and the cross exchange rates, we obtain a convex model that can be solved efficiently.
