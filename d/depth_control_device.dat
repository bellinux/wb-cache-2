40|$|Abstract: A subsoiler-cum-differential rate {{fertilizer}} applicator {{was designed and}} developed by selecting the best parameters from previous studies. The equipment consisted of a rectangular frame, a main winged tine, two shallow leading winged tines, a <b>depth</b> <b>control</b> <b>device,</b> a fertilizer box of 100 kg capacity, positive feed type fertilizer metering devices and a ground wheel with chain and sprockets for transmitting power to the metering mechanism. The equipment had the option to place fertilizers up to a 500 mm soil depth by the main winged tine and delivering fertilizer up to 250 mm deep using the leading tines, thereby helping place fertilizer at different depths in vertical soil profile in a single pass. All three tines had independent metering systems. Options were provided to meter and deliver either 33. 3 % or 25. 0 % or 20. 0 % of the total recommended fertilizers with the main tine and the remaining amount through two shallow leading tines. The laboratory evaluations indicated a coefficient of uniformity of more than 90 % for application rates of 250, 500, 750 and 1, 000 kg/ha. The equipment was tested {{in the field to}} observe its performance on sugarcane with results showing an increase of 16. 2 %, 16. 4 % and 35. 4 % in yield as compared to conventional ploughing with in-furrow fertilizer application (Control). Subsoiling alone increased the cane weight, number of millable cane and cane yield by 4. 3 %, 11. 4 % and 15. 9 % compared to the control...|$|E

The buoyancy control system {{is made up of}} buoyancy controller and two sets of buoyancy <b>control</b> <b>devices</b> include: water tank, sea water pump, valve grouping, pipeline etc. Buoyancy <b>control</b> <b>devices</b> were configured to both head and tail part of the AUV symmetrical to its buoyant center. <b>Depth</b> <b>control</b> algorithm and buoyancy control algorithm were proposed separately. In the process of voyage at a constant depth, the real time speed, pitch angle and depth error were detected to evaluate the residual buoyancy indirectly, and then the real time buoyancy control was executed by pumping the water into or out of the tanks.

40|$|To {{economically}} {{enhance the}} performance of active/passive <b>control</b> <b>devices</b> for seismic response reduction of tall buildings, this paper investigates the optimal placement and optimal parameter of <b>control</b> <b>devices</b> using the linear quadratic performance index as an objective function. The linear relation between the increment of performance index and the change of the position matrix of <b>control</b> <b>devices</b> is first established {{based on the assumption}} that the control gain remains unchanged. The optimal placement of <b>control</b> <b>devices</b> is then determined in terms of the sequence of the calculated performance index increments and the number of <b>control</b> <b>devices</b> to be used. With the <b>control</b> <b>devices</b> at their optimal places, the seismic response of the building is finally computed using the suboptimal control gain derived using the minimum error principle, from which the equivalent optimal parameters of passive devices can be also determined. The applicability of the proposed approach and its limitation are carefully examined through numerical examples. The results from the numerical examples show that the suggested approach is quite accurate and effective in determining the optimal placement and optimal parameter of <b>control</b> <b>devices</b> if the number of removed <b>control</b> <b>devices</b> is limited to a certain range.

40|$|Voltage {{regulation}} {{by means}} of coordinated voltage control {{is one of the}} challenging aspects of distribution system operation. Integration of distributed generation (DG), which can also be operated in voltage control mode, in distribution systems may introduce adverse effects including control interactions, operational conflicts and long term oscillations. The seamless operation of distribution systems embedded with DG for effective voltage control is one of the challenging tasks, mainly because (a) DG may interact with the conventional voltage <b>control</b> <b>devices</b> and (b) prioritised operation of different voltage <b>control</b> <b>devices</b> depends on the network topology and real-time characteristics of the system. Coordinated operation involving multiple voltage <b>control</b> <b>devices</b> (i. e., on-load tap changers and voltage regulators in addition to local capacitor banks) and DG units is one of the feasible technical solutions at medium voltage distribution system level. In most of the methods proposed in the literature, the voltage <b>control</b> <b>devices</b> and DG units are tuned and coordinated online using Volt/VAR optimization strategies in accordance with the time-graded operation. However, there is no mechanism to operationally minimize the interactions between DG units and the voltage <b>control</b> <b>devices</b> in real-time between any two consecutive control states. In such case, more generic approach needs to be developed for examining interactions between the DG units and the voltage <b>control</b> <b>devices.</b> In this paper, interactions among multiple DG units and the voltage <b>control</b> <b>devices</b> are identified using their simultaneous and non-simultaneous responses...|$|R
