50|$|The {{earliest}} IOE layouts used atmospheric <b>inlet</b> <b>valves</b> {{which were}} held {{closed with a}} weak spring and were opened by the pressure differential created when the piston went down on the inlet stroke. This worked well with low-speed early engines and {{had the benefit of}} being very simple and cheap, but the weak spring was unable to close the valve fast enough as the RPM's of engines increased, necessitating stronger springs, which in turn needed direct mechanical action to open, as the atmospheric pressure of 15psi limits the total force available from creating a pressure differential, meaning that a 15-lb spring is the strongest that can be used (for practical purposes, {{it would have to be}} lighter still). When the limits of this system were reached, the design was improved without substantial changes to the head casting by adding a mechanical system to open the <b>inlet</b> <b>valves</b> and stronger <b>springs</b> to close them. In both cases, the exhaust valves were in the block and were opened by contact with a camshaft through a tappet or valve lifter and closed by springs.|$|R

These changes lifted the engine's power by 30% from 63 bhp @ 5000 rpm to 82 bhp @ 6000 rpm. For US export, a de-tuned 1565cc version was used giving 80 bhp @ 6000 rpm.|$|R
40|$|A {{computational}} {{fluid dynamics}} model of the middle chamber of a triplex positive displacement reciprocating pump is presented to assess the feasibility of a transient numerical method to investigate {{the performance of the}} pump throughout the 180 of crank rotation of the inlet stroke. The paper also investigates, by means of {{computational fluid dynamics}}, the pressure drop occurring in the pump chamber during {{the first part of the}} inlet stroke in order to gain a better understanding of the mechanisms leading to cavitation. The model includes the compressibility of the working fluid and the lift of the <b>inlet</b> <b>valve</b> as a function of the pressure field on the <b>inlet</b> <b>valve</b> surfaces. It also takes into account the <b>valve</b> <b>spring</b> preload in the overall balance of forces moving the valve. Simulation of the valve motion was achieved by providing the solver with two user-defined functions. The plunger lift–time history was defined by the crank diameter and connecting rod length. This paper will demonstrate the feasibility and reasonable accuracy of the method adopted by comparison with experimental data...|$|R

2500|$|Both <b>inlet</b> and exhaust <b>valves</b> {{were in the}} {{cylinder}} heads. The automatic <b>inlet</b> <b>valves</b> of earlier Anzani engines, opened by atmospheric pressure and closed by <b>valve</b> <b>springs</b> were retained, but fuel was fed from a mixing chamber in the crankcase via inlet tubes placed {{at the rear of}} the engine to avoid cooling of the mixture by the oncoming airflow. [...] This arrangement placed the exhaust valves at the front of the engine, where they were operated from a cam in the rear of the crankcase via push rods and rockers. [...] A single carburettor fed the crankcase chambers from below. [...] Some versions used a single Gibaud magneto, running at 3,000 rpm, though others built by British Anzani had a pair of Bosch magnetos, running slower. [...] Plugs (K.L.G. for the British variant) were mounted in the sides of {{the cylinder}} heads, sloping upwards to avoid plug fouling by lubricating oil. The exhaust was collected by a prominent pair of semi-circular manifolds.|$|R
50|$|The Yamaha FZ750 is {{a sports}} {{motorcycle}} produced by Yamaha Motor Corporation between 1985 and 1991. The FZ750 is notable for several reasons, {{perhaps the most}} radical being the 5-valve cylinder head with a radial arrangement. This became something of a Yamaha trademark, and although disputed in recent years, it was argued that for a given lift, the 3 <b>inlet</b> <b>valves</b> flowed more efficiently than conventional twin <b>inlet</b> <b>valves.</b> What was indisputable was that their light weight allowed for faster opening speeds, and softer <b>valve</b> <b>springs,</b> all contributing to theoretical increases in engine speed and thus power outputs. Whatever the scientific merits, the bikes were famous for their linear power delivery, and in 1985 it was still considered impressive to achieve 150mph from a 750 road machine. Yamaha also designed the motor to have a forward-inclined cylinder block, to effectively lower the centre of gravity. As a result, the FZ750 ran a relatively long wheelbase, which hampered it when used for road racing. What was clear was that Yamaha had considered the engine design in the overall package, rather than as had happened before, when engines were created, and then somehow bundled into a chassis. The FZ750 show-cased Yamaha's design skills.|$|R
50|$|IOE engines {{were widely}} used in early motorcycles, {{initially}} with the <b>inlet</b> <b>valve</b> being operated by engine suction instead of a cam-activated valvetrain. When the suction-operated <b>inlet</b> <b>valves</b> reached their limits as engine speeds increased, the manufacturers modified the designs by adding a mechanical valvetrain for the <b>inlet</b> <b>valve.</b> A few automobile manufacturers, including Willys, Rolls-Royce and Humber also made IOE engines for both cars and military vehicles.

40|$|This {{experimental}} work {{was concerned with}} comparison of <b>inlet</b> <b>valve</b> actuation strategies in a thermodynamic single cylinder spark ignition research engine equipped with a mechanical fully variable valvetrain on both the inlet and exhaust. The research involved study {{of the effects of}} the valvetrain on combustion, fuel economy and emissions when used to achieve variable valve timing alone and when applied together with early <b>inlet</b> <b>valve</b> closing for so-called unthrottled operation. The effects of such early <b>inlet</b> <b>valve</b> closure were examined using either fully variable events or by simulating two-stage cam profile switching. While fully variable operation enabled the maximum fuel savings over the widest operating map, it was apparent that two-stage switching mechanisms can provide an attractive compromise in terms of cost versus CO 2 benefit on engines of moderate to large capacity. However, from speed-load maps obtained in the current study it would appear that a wide range of <b>inlet</b> <b>valve</b> durations would be necessary to obtain fuel savings sufficient to warrant a system any more sophisticated than current variable valve timing mechanisms in future aggressively downsized gasoline engines. © IMechE, 2009...|$|R

40|$|This work {{involved}} {{study of}} the effects of alcohol blends on combustion, fuel economy and emissions in a single cylinder research engine equipped with a mechanical fully variable valvetrain on the <b>inlet</b> and variable <b>valve</b> timing on the exhaust. A number of splash blends of gasoline, iso-octane, ethanol and butanol were examined during port fuel injected early <b>inlet</b> <b>valve</b> closing operation, both with and without variable valve timing. Under low valve overlap conditions, it was apparent that the <b>inlet</b> <b>valve</b> durations/lifts required for full unthrottled operation were remarkably similar for the wide range of blends studied. However, with high valve overlap differences in burning velocities and internal EGR tolerances warranted changes in these valve settings. In turn, it was concluded that high ethanol content blends facilitated minimum throttling at the <b>inlet</b> <b>valve</b> itself and the largest relative savings in terms of fuel consumption, engine-out emissions of NOx and (corrected) unburned hydrocarbons.
