25|$|HD DVD-R is the writable disc {{variant of}} HD DVD, {{available}} with a single-layer capacity of 15 GB or a dual-layer capacity of 30 GB. Write speeds depend on <b>drive</b> <b>speed,</b> with a data rate of 36.55 Mbit/s (4.36 MB/s) and a recording time of 56 minutes for 1× media, and 73 Mbit/s (8.71 MB/s) and a recording time of 28 minutes for 2×.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "×" [...] rating, {{that was}} used by some card {{manufacturers}} and made obsolete by speed classes, is a multiple of the standard CD-ROM <b>drive</b> <b>speed</b> of 150KiB/s (approximately 1.23Mbit/s). Basic cards transfer data at up to six times (6×) the CD-ROM speed; that is, 900KiB/s or 7.37Mbit/s. The 2.0 specification defines speeds up to 200×, but is not as specific as Speed Classes are on how to measure speed. Manufacturers may report best-case speeds and may report the card's fastest read speed, which is typically faster than the write speed. Some vendors, including Transcend and Kingston, report their cards' write speed. When a card lists both a speed class and an [...] "×" [...] rating, the latter may be assumed a read speed only.|$|E

50|$|Original CD-ROM drives {{could read}} data at 150 kibibytes (150 × 210 bytes) per second. As faster drives were released, the write speeds and read speeds for optical discs were multiplied by manufacturers, far {{exceeding}} the <b>drive</b> <b>speeds</b> originally released onto the market. In order to represent this exponential growth in <b>drive</b> <b>speeds,</b> manufacturers used the symbol nX, whereby n is the multiple {{of the original}} speed. For example, writing to a CD at 8X will be {{twice as fast as}} writing onto a disc at 4X..|$|R
50|$|Process {{control and}} energy {{conservation}} {{are the two}} primary reasons for using an adjustable <b>speed</b> <b>drive.</b> Historically, adjustable <b>speed</b> <b>drives</b> were developed for process control, but energy conservation has emerged as an equally important objective.|$|R

50|$|A {{major reason}} {{for the failure of}} the Zip drives is also {{attributed}} to the higher pricing they carried (partly because of royalties that 3rd-party manufacturers of drives and disks had to pay).

50|$|The usable {{data rate}} of a Blu-ray Disc drive can {{be limited by}} the {{capacity}} of the drive's data interface. With a USB 2.0 interface, the maximum exploitable <b>drive</b> <b>speed</b> is 288 Mbit/s or 36 MB/s (also called 8× speed). A USB 3.0 interface (with proper cabling) does not have this limitation, nor do even the oldest version of Serial ATA (SATA) nor the latest Parallel ATA standards. Blu-ray drives that are integrated into a computer (as opposed to physically separate and connected via a cable) typically have a SATA interface.|$|E
5000|$|The 1571 was {{designed}} to accommodate the C128's [...] "burst" [...] mode for 2x faster disk access, however the drive cannot use it if connected to older Commodore machines. This mode replaced the slow bit-banging serial routines of the 1541 with a true serial shift register implemented in hardware, thus dramatically increasing the <b>drive</b> <b>speed.</b> Although this originally had been planned when Commodore first switched from the parallel IEEE-488 interface to a custom serial interface (CBM-488), hardware bugs in the VIC-20's 6522 VIA shift register prevented it from working properly.|$|E

The valve action of the engines were hardened steel cams that were applied to the cam shaft. The cam faces were slightly convex, and worked on hardened rollers, carried in swinging forks, which bore against square ended sliders. The valves were alumimum heads driven to shoulder on riveted steel stems. The valve action was direct with no side action on the sliders. The compression was between 50 to 55 pounds of pressure.|$|E
