5|$|Finally, at 8:00 am., some of Frederick's army <b>emerged</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> woods, {{with most}} of Generalleutnant Friedrich Wilhelm von Seydlitz's cavalry {{and the rest of}} his artillery; a short time later, the rest of the Prussians <b>emerged</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> woods, and the Russians {{realized}} it was not a scouting party, but the main army. The Prussians stood ranked for battle, which now began in earnest. Finck's artillery park had been in place since dawn and, at 11:30 am, Moller initiated bombardment of the Russian position from the northern and northeastern ends of the Russian line (now the Russian left). In error, the Russian artillery had faced their batteries to the meadows beyond the Mühlberge, not the ravine, and had to be reset. For 30 minutes, the two sides bombarded each other.|$|E

5|$|Greenpeace is a {{non-governmental}} {{environmental organization}} which <b>emerged</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> anti-nuclear and peace {{movements in the}} 1970s. Its ship, the Rainbow Warrior, frequently tried to interfere with nuclear tests and whaling operations. The movement now has branches in forty countries.|$|E
5|$|In 1917 Rutherford bombarded {{nitrogen}} gas with alpha particles and observed hydrogen nuclei being emitted {{from the gas}} (Rutherford recognized these, because he had previously obtained them bombarding hydrogen with alpha particles, and observing hydrogen nuclei in the products). Rutherford concluded that the hydrogen nuclei <b>emerged</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> nuclei of the nitrogen atoms themselves (in effect, he had split a nitrogen).|$|E
5|$|In {{the field}} of {{military}} organisation, Napoleon borrowed from previous theorists such as Jacques Antoine Hippolyte, Comte de Guibert, and from the reforms of preceding French governments, and then developed much of what was already in place. He continued the policy, which <b>emerged</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Revolution, of promotion based primarily on merit.|$|E

5|$|The PSD that <b>emerged</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{disintegration}} of PADESM {{was a powerful}} force in Malagasy politics throughout the First Republic. When Madagascar achieved independence in 1960, PSD leader Tsiranana was named the country's first president, a position he held until the rotaka protests forced him to resign in 1972. His administration was succeeded by the socialist nationalist Second Republic under Didier Ratsiraka.|$|E
5|$|The {{victory was}} {{important}} for the Danes. Not only had their arch-enemy been defeated, out of the smoldering city came a stronger bourgeoisie with renewed confidence, more privileges and an improved position vis-a-vis the Danish crown. In many ways, {{it was a new}} Denmark which <b>emerged</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> assault of its capital on February 12, 1659.|$|E
5|$|A {{light rail}} system for Greater Manchester <b>emerged</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> failure of the 1970s Picc-Vic tunnel scheme to obtain central {{government}} funding. A light-rail scheme was proposed in 1982 as the least expensive rail-based transport solution for Manchester city centre and the surrounding Greater Manchester metropolitan area. Government approval was granted in 1988 and the network began operating services between Bury Interchange and Victoria on 6 April 1992, becoming the United Kingdom's first modern street-running rail system; the 1885-built Blackpool tramway being the only first-generation tram system in the UK that had survived up to Metrolink's creation.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave <b>emerged</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> African coast late on July 10. The wave {{entered the}} Bahamas on July 21 and organized into Tropical Depression Six while 70miles (110km) east of Eleuthera. Initially {{the storm was}} predicted to execute a clockwise loop and drift to the west {{in response to a}} high pressure system. Several models indicated the possibility of the storm to drift westward into central Florida. Soon after the depression formed, it strengthened into Tropical Storm Franklin.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} {{the west coast}} of Africa on October3. It tracked westward, reaching the Caribbean Sea on October10. By October13, a large area of convection persisted from Hispaniola southwestward through Panama, and {{over the next few days}} the convection organized and concentrated in the northwestern Caribbean Sea. An anticyclone became established near Jamaica on October15, which created a favorable upper-level environment for the system by reducing wind shear. Around the same time, a low-level trough <b>emerged</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Intertropical Convergence Zone, heading north off the coast of Nicaragua. Early on October 16, the system developed into a broad tropical depression about halfway between Central America and Jamaica.|$|E
5|$|According to some sources, the Poles resented their {{change of}} {{fortunes}} because, before the war, Poles had a privileged position. Then, {{in the space}} of a few days, Jews and other minorities from within Poland occupied positions in the Soviet occupation government—such as teachers, civil servants and engineers—that they allegedly had trouble achieving under the Polish government. What to the majority of Poles was occupation and betrayal was, to some Jews—especially Polish communists of Jewish descent who <b>emerged</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> underground—an opportunity for revolution and retribution. There were even some extreme cases of Jewish participation in massacres of ethnic Poles such as Massacre of Brzostowica Mała. Such behavior affronted non-Jewish Poles.|$|E

5|$|Advancing up {{the ridge}} {{they had just}} abandoned, Browne's {{battalion}} came under intense fire from Ruffin's emplaced infantry and artillery. Within a few salvoes, half the battalion was gone and, unable to continue, Browne's men scattered amongst the cover provided by the slope and returned fire. Despite his success, Ruffin could not descend the hill to brush away the remnants of Browne's battalion, as Dilkes's brigade had by now <b>emerged</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> wood and was forming up {{at the base of}} the slope.|$|E
5|$|Approximately 600 Jews {{were killed}} in Greater Albania during the war. Albania-proper <b>emerged</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> war with a {{population}} of Jews eleven times greater than at the beginning, numbering around 1,800 individuals. Most of these subsequently emigrated to Israel, but several hundred remained until the fall of Communism in the early 1990s before they did the same. As of 2011, 69 Albanians have been recognized as Righteous Among the Nations for the role they played in saving Jews during the Holocaust.|$|E
5|$|Around this time, Persano {{broke off}} the engagement, and though his ships still outnumbered the Austrians, {{he refused to}} {{counter-attack}} with his badly demoralized forces. In addition, the fleet was low on coal and ammunition. The Italian fleet began to withdraw, followed by the Austrians; Tegetthoff, having gotten the better of the action, kept his distance {{so as not to}} risk his success. As night began to fall, the opposing fleets disengaged completely, heading for Ancona and Pola, respectively. Kaiser Max had <b>emerged</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> battle essentially undamaged, the Italian shells having been unable to penetrate her armor.|$|E

5|$|At around 19:30, von Spee ordered Dresden and Leipzig {{to launch}} a torpedo attack against the damaged British armored cruisers. Dresden {{increased}} speed to position herself off the British bows, and briefly spotted Glasgow as she was withdrawing, but the British cruiser disappeared in the haze and gathering darkness. Dresden then encountered Leipzig; both ships initially thought the other was hostile. Dresdens crew was loading a torpedo when the two ships confirmed each other's identity. By 22:00, Dresden {{and the other two}} light cruisers were deployed in a line that searched unsuccessfully for the British cruisers. Dresden had <b>emerged</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> battle completely unscathed.|$|E
5|$|Bolzano had {{a fairly}} uneventful peacetime career, which {{primarily}} consisted of naval reviews for Italian and foreign dignitaries. She saw extensive {{action in the}} first three years of Italy's participation in World War II. She took part in the Battles of Calabria, Taranto, Cape Spartivento, and Cape Matapan. The ship was lightly damaged at Calabria, but she <b>emerged</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> other engagements unscathed. She also frequently escorted convoys to North Africa in 1941 and 1942 and patrolled for British naval forces in the central Mediterranean Sea.|$|E
5|$|Both ships {{survived the}} war, though Leipzig was in very poor {{condition}} following an accidental collision {{with the heavy}} cruiser Prinz Eugen late in the war. Leipzig was therefore used as a barracks ship before being scuttled in 1946. Nürnberg, however, <b>emerged</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> war largely unscathed, and as a result, was seized by the Soviet Navy as war reparations, and commissioned into the Soviet fleet as Admiral Makarov; she continued in Soviet service until the late 1950s, and was broken up for scrap by 1960.|$|E
