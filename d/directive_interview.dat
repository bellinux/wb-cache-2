40|$|Interviewing {{as it is}} {{developed}} in this publication is a disciplined encounter technique for counselors and reference librarians wto wish tc {{be more effective in}} serving the individual patron. There seems to be two polar types of patrons: those who will not talk, and those who will not stop talking. Without training, librarians tend to rush patrons to the hooks rather than take the time to encourage the patron to discuss his purposes and interests. The following subjects are discussed: (1) orientaticn to the interview,. (2) patron-librarian interface, (3) counseling in librarianship, (4) interpersonal aspects of librarian counseling, (5) psychological dimensions of librarian counseling and (6) interview question analysis. The appendices contain examples of the non-directive interview, the <b>directive</b> <b>interview,</b> and functional interviewing.

40|$|This Bachelor thesis {{deals with}} {{possibilities}} that trained {{members of the}} Army of the Czech Republic have when giving first aid on their foreign missions. It deals with the soldiers who have passed through a special Combat Lifesaver Course (later just CLS), the activity of doctors and middle medical staff in medical centres is not involved. The work is divided in two parts ? theoretical and practical. In the theoretical part I summarized the specifics of giving first aid in field conditions and the basic principles that military medical staff follow. There are into detail described actions that a Combat Lifesaver performs in case a fellow fighter is injured, to ensure their vital signs immediately after the injury and to transport them {{to a higher level}} medical facility. The aim of this work is to provide an idea of giving first aid in the tactical environment of experts and to point out numerous peculiarities which differentiate it from the first aid we know from the civil life. That´s because combat conditions bring lots of restrictions and risks for the injured {{as well as for the}} medical staff providing urgent care. The method selected for the qualitative research in the practical part is semi <b>directive</b> <b>interview.</b> The interviews were held with four members of the Army of the Czech Republic, who have attended the above mentioned course and have taken part in a foreign mission with that specialization, and with two instructors of the CLS course. The questions were about the way of selecting soldiers for the CLS course, their training and preparation before their departure to a foreign mission. There were also analysed the competences and obligations of a Combat Lifesaver in case of injury of a fellow fighter. The research has demonstrated that soldiers are selected for the Combat Lifesaver course mainly according to the requirements for the foreign missions. The aim of the selection is the presence of at least one soldier with medical training in each crew. The only requirement on the soldiers that must be fulfilled before departing to a foreign mission is completion of the cited course. Other activities, like training other members of the crew and rounding off their knowledge are up to their consideration. It´s been proved that a Combat Lifesaver fulfils their tasks at a foreign mission in the same way as any other soldier and their specialization is applied only in case of injury of a fellow fighter. They most often deal with gunshot and fragment wounds...|$|E

The objective was to identify which outdoors public spaces children declared to be places where they engaged in plays as a function of age and gender. The survey was carried on with 377 children attending primary schools in a small town. Children answered a short questionnaire. They were shown 10 sets of photos corresponding to 10 outdoor public spaces and said if they knew the place. If they did, they reported how frequently they used that place, whether they had already gone alone and played there. The development of the children's knowledge of the outdoor public spaces slightly increases between 6 and 10 years, the younger ones already know most of the major public spaces of the city. On the other hand, there is a tangible progression in the autonomous use of these outdoor spaces (without adult supervision), yet the spatial autonomy in the city appears limited even for the older children. Moreover, whatever age is considered, the autonomous use of outdoor spaces is more restricted for girls than for boys. The findings comfort the idea that outdoor public spaces providing children with specific age amenities are the most attractive, but they differ for boys and girls. The results also underline that for the age range considered outdoors spaces close to the home are essential.

The data also permits an analysis of the development of the autonomous use of these outdoor spaces depending on the distance from the child's home. We are investigating some aspects of primary-school children's urban practices. Specifically, the study focuses {{on the development of}} 6 to 11 year olds' knowledge and usage of the main outdoor public spaces of their town, i. e. places, squares, play areas, block parks, public parks and woods surrounding the city. The collected data allows us to identify which outdoors public spaces children as a function of age and gender declared to be places where they engaged in plays and activities. The data also permits an analysis of the development of the autonomous use (without adult supervision) of these outdoor spaces depending on the distance from the child's home. The survey intends to capture the representation that the population of children living in a town have from the outdoors public spaces they are provided with. Thus, it was carried on with 88 % of the children attending primary schools in a small town [...] Arpajon [...] where 377 children answered to a short questionnaire. The older children (4 th and 5 th grades) filled up the questionnaire in the classroom, while younger children were submitted to a semi <b>directive</b> <b>interview</b> conducted in small groups of four (2 nd and 3 rd grades) or two children (1 st grade). Firstly, children were asked to indicate the places where they usually go when they play outside. Then, 10 sets of photos corresponding to 10 outdoor public spaces were shown to the children who said if they knew the place. If they did, they also reported how frequently they used that place, whether they had already gone alone and played there.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{focuses on}} the way drug users (DUs) {{play an active role}} in {{implementing}} public health policies by their involvement in self-support groups, thus providing new forms of patients' expertise. Expertise of this nature may seem paradoxical, in that it confers qualities to populations whose practices are unlawful and whose identity is stigmatised. A qualitative method including semi <b>directive</b> <b>interviews</b> (57) and ethnographic observations was used for this research. A thematic content analysis was done from empirical data following an inductive logic. This paper aims to show how a DUs' organisation finds a place in the social arena in the political context of harm reduction, succeeds in building the French DUs' health and welfare conditions as a legitimate cause, and elaborates a specific rhetoric centered around life skills and citizenship. The new forms of patients' expertise, based on life experiences, contribute to enhancing the value of practical, emotional and subjective knowledge that sometimes questions specialist knowledge. This claim for citizenship is often used as a sort of magic incantation, and content may be lacking if public health policies are not accompanied by broader policies that attempt {{to take into account the}} political, legal, economical and social conditions of stigmatised social groups like DUs...|$|R

40|$|In Belgium, Nuclear Waste Management (NWM) is {{conducted}} by a Federal Agency called ONDRAF - i. e. the “National Agency for Radioactive Waste and Enriched Fissile Materials”. Adhering to a largely accepted vision, NWM is considered by ONDRAF as a long-term and complex issue, consisting in technical, social, economic and ethical questions. In this respect, scientific literature invites to clarify and address those aspects in a decision-making process that could benefit from meaningful public participation (Callon, Lascoumes, and Barthes 2001). In this context, many stakeholders (e. g. citizens, researchers, industrialists, civil society organizations, the European Union [...] . and ONDRAF itself) are in demand of a “conductor” that can organize, ensure and legitimize such a participatory decision-making process. Many questions emerge from this demand. Who can be the gatekeeper of this process? What could be his role? For which purposes? In addition to that, how should participation be organized/assessed/controlled? To that regard, {{the purpose of this}} paper is twofold. First, I elaborate a possible definition of “gatekeeping a participatory decision-making process concerning NWM in Belgium”. Second, I question the possible role of Technology Assessment (TA) - as an institution as well as a set of approached - in this context.

Board meetings were observed by the writer and records of past meetings and Departmental files were examined. The writer has traced the development of community participation and the sharing of decision making in Papua New Guinea education up to 1970 when school Boards were established by the Education Act, as well as subsequent developments in the relationship between the Department of Education and Boards of Governors. Histories of the six schools used as case studies are given, including accounts of the establishment and development of their Boards of Governors. In only one function, student discipline, did the Boards appear to have a largely executive role. This function was regarded by most Board members as being the area in which their Boards did their most important work. In some of the other functions listed in the Act and in subsequent directives, the Boards' role was found to be only a partially executive one or an advisory or critical one. With some of the functions assigned to them, there was little or no involvement by the Boards. Although the Boards have continued to be viable and to contribute to the effective running of their schools, they were not being used to their full potential and there was a need for their relationship with emerging Provincial Governments to be defined.

The interview transcripts were analyzed using thematic analysis and a conceptual model was constructed based on the resulting themes. We developed a two-step dignity model of illness. According to this model, illness related conditions do not affect patients' dignity directly but indirectly by affecting the way patients perceive themselves. We identified three components shaping self-perception: (a) the individual self: the subjective experiences and internally held qualities of the patient; (b) the relational self: the self within reciprocal interaction with others; and, (c) the societal self: the self as a social object in the eyes of others. The merits of the model are two-folded. First, it offers an organizing framework for further research into patients' dignity. Secondly, the model can serve to facilitate care for seriously ill patients in practice by providing insight into illness and dignity {{at the level of the}} individual patient where intervention can be effectively targete...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{attempts}} {{to map the}} changes to guidance and policy that have {{had an effect on}} Navy medicine's readiness program. Documents reviewed for this thesis include {{but are not limited to}} DoD, GAO, and service IG reports, studies by the RAND Corporation, Center for Naval Analysis, Institute for Defense Analysis, and Logistic Management Institute, congressional testimony, and relevant DoD and Navy <b>directives</b> and manuals. <b>Interviews</b> and electronic mail with officials associated with Navy medicine include Deputy Commander of MED- 27, J- 4 Medical Readiness Division Chief, RROC director, N 931 Analyst, and DMRTI. Measuring medical readiness is a large and complex issue and the military medical systems use a variety of data and models in an attempt to measure readiness. The conclusions of this thesis are that many groups and individuals are providing guidance for Navy medical readiness and changes have been produced at a rapid rate. Considerable uncertainty and variety remains concerning who and how we need to train for wartime medical care. To address these problems, Navy medicine created the RROC and its subordinate task forces. U. S. Navy (U. S. N.) author...|$|R
40|$|Background It is {{difficult}} to measure the impact of {{speech and language therapy}} intervention for people with aphasia. This is because the effect of communication loss and language rehabilitation is hard to capture using concise psychometric measurements. Quality of life measurement is also challenging for people severe aphasia. People with severe aphasia have difficulties understanding and producing single words. This level of language loss has resulted in people with severe aphasia being excluded from research into outcome measurement because they do not meet the minimum inclusion criteria for most aphasia investigations. Our clinical therapy trial was designed to overcome this challenge. Method This paper reports a research project that is being conducted to assess and compare the impact of two types of word finding therapy. This paper reports a single case study, and describes how outcome measurement was used to elicit the views of a person with severe aphasia. Interviews at four stages: pre therapy, at therapy change over, post therapy and at follow up were used to evaluate the impact of therapy. Ten non <b>directive</b> question <b>interviews</b> were conducted at each stage of the trial with both the person with aphasia and her husband. Interviews with the carer were transcribed and matched to interview questions using content analysis. This content was then presented to the person with severe aphasia for verification or contradiction using a range of conversation techniques including identifying topics for discussion, recapping what has been understood, visual analogue scales, adapted visual presentation of materials, writing, drawing, gesture, facial expression, pen, paper, keywords and yes/no questions. Results and Discussion Being able to represent your own views is a prerequisite of authentic quality of life measurement. This verification interview technique allowed our participant to contribute to the evaluation of her therapy allowing him to agree, disagree and qualify the propositions made by her husband. At times the technique allowed the person with aphasia to communicate novel information to the interviewer and her husband. We argue that this way of measuring outcome and the impact of therapy on quality of life will facilitate aphasia therapists to include people with all types of aphasia in their research and propose that it will contribute to the creation of an evidence base for impairment based language therapy for people with severe aphasia...|$|R
40|$|For {{several decades}} in France, the {{balance-sheet}} method has been recommended and widely {{used to calculate}} N fertilizer rates. However, despite the scientific consensus on this method and its adoption as a regulatory tool, high N losses are still frequently occurring, suggesting limits {{in the implementation of}} this method. We assumed this consensus might hide discrepancies between some scientific concepts and the ways farmers use methods and tools. We combined a systematic analysis of official reports delivered by groups of experts (Nitrate Groups) from the 20 French regions concerned by the fifth reform of the Nitrate <b>Directive,</b> and <b>interviews</b> with experts, advisors and farmers. We identified principles of the method that reveal discrepancies between the theoretical model and its use, highlighting the gap between scientific concepts and their possible implementation. Here we show three frequent controversies that create uncertainties in calculating N fertilizer rates with the model. 75 % of the Nitrate Groups debated about the estimation of the target yield, showing that there is no common understanding of the concept. In practice, farmers tend to fix the target yield as the value they desire more than the average value that can be reached in their fields. Although scientists emphasized the importance of measuring soil mineral content at the end of winter, sampling and uncertain extrapolation of the measurement lead to doubts and uncertainties, weakening the reliability of the N rates estimation. 45 % of the interviewed advisors and seven Nitrate Groups put forward limits due to the regulatory implementation of the balance-sheet method, such as the reduced exploration of alternatives adapted to local specificities, or the prevention of an agronomical approach by an administrative one. These controversies among stakeholders showed that despite the rigor of the method and the scientific consensus on it, its implementation creates uncertainties, doubts and errors in the calculated N rates. Despite 40 years of agronomical and technological progress, major points of the method are still obstacles for its use. Considering these discrepancies between the model and its use, we suggest that, instead of persisting in improving incrementally each term of the balance-sheet method, we should switch to the innovative design of a completely new fertilizer calculation method, where users are taken into account {{from the beginning of the}} design process.

40|$|Engaging {{in regular}} {{exercise}} has multiple health benefits [...] for example, physical (Anshel, 2003; Penedo 2 ̆ 6 Dahn 2005); mental (Stathopoulou, Powers, Berry, Smits, 2 ̆ 6 Otto, 2006); emotional (Berger Pargman, 2 ̆ 6 Weinberg, 2002); and social (Anshel, Reeves, 2 ̆ 6 Roth, 2003; Dishman, 1994; Lox, Martin, 2 ̆ 6 Petruzzello, 2003). Unfortunately, {{there are as}} many barriers to people exercising (e. g., time, cost, and accessibility) as there are benefits. Consequently, approximately two-thirds of individuals living within the United States do not engage in regular exercise (i. e., 3 days per week for at least 45 minutes; CDC, 2006). Multiple interventions have been implemented to help individuals initiate regular exercise (e. g., psychotherapy, physicians, and community programs), but none of them review how an individual alters his or her thoughts about exercise that could lead to initiation. Addressing an individual 2 ̆ 7 s beliefs about engaging in regular exercise will add to the understanding of how modifying thoughts can help lead to initiation. The purpose of the current study was to monitor the use of Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT) -style interviews to help three male participants who have had difficulties beginning and sustaining regular exercise explore their thoughts about exercise and potentially begin an exercise routine. In this dissertation, a comprehensive background is provided, outlining and explaining definitions affiliated with REBT, exercise, and mental health. Then a thorough literature review is provided, which outlines previous research on exercise interventions. In response to the specific research questions posed, the results of the current study indicate that using a variety of active <b>directive</b> REBT style <b>interviews</b> helped three men modify their beliefs about exercise and consequently improve their motivation to routinely engage in the behavior. Finally, limitations, implications, and directions for future research and practice are provided...|$|R
40|$|Advance {{directives}} {{are just}} one aspect of advance care planning. According to the New Zealand Nurses Organisation, advance directives are becoming increasingly common in New Zealand. Nurses are well positioned to take on an increasing role in advance directives, particularly {{in view of the}} expected burgeoning older population to which New Zealand is no exception. The literature suggests there is a role for primary health nurses in advance directives but no literature to date is available on this role in the New Zealand context. The aim of this research was to determine primary health nurses' role in advance directives. A qualitative case study research approach was used to explore the knowledge, attitudes, experiences, and involvement of primary health nurses in advance <b>directives.</b> Semi-structured <b>interviews</b> were conducted with 13 senior primary health nurses from one New Zealand province. Two propositions informed the analysis: 1) primary health nurses currently do not have a role in advance directives; and 2) primary health nurses believe that advance directives can promote effective-end-of-life care. Watson's Theory of Human Caring was used as the theoretical framework to guide the study. Three themes were identified from the analysis: encountering challenges, facilitating patient voice, and valuing the person. The findings revealed that primary health nurses had little or no significant experience or involvement in advance directives. Participants described knowledge inconsistencies about advance directives, in particular to related legalities. Nevertheless, participants had positive attitudes towards advance directives and believed there was a role for primary health nurses in early advance directive conversations. They emphasised the importance of teamwork and envisaged their role as one of support to both the patient and doctor. Caring praxis underpinned the nurses' positive attitudes towards advance directives. These caring behaviours sustained the core values of patient autonomy and patient advocacy considered fundamental to sensitive advance directive conversations. Many challenges were identified in terms of the nurse's role in advanced directives. These included cultural considerations for Māori in order to respect The Treaty of Waitangi principles and attending to the cultural needs of the individual Pacific Island groupings. Other challenges included unclear guidelines, unclear role delineation, ethical dilemmas and fragmented or complex communication issues across the primary/secondary health sector. Results of this study may inform nurses of the need to establish nurse–patient relationships built upon trust and positive regard in order to support patients in advanced directive discussions. Implications for nurse educators include incorporating education directed at empowering nurses to participate in ethical decision making to enhance patients' end-of-life care. Given the importance of the multi-disciplinary responsibility in establishing advance directives, {{there is a need for}} further research regarding how health professionals could function together in the role of advance directive communication to best meet patients' needs...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Within the Southern African {{prevention}} of mother to child transmission (PMTCT) programmes, counsellors talk with pregnant mothers {{about a number}} of interrelated decisions and behaviour changes. Current counselling has been characterised as ineffective in eliciting behaviour change and as adopting a predominantly informational and <b>directive</b> approach. Motivational <b>interviewing</b> (MI) was chosen as a more appropriate approach to guide mothers in these difficult decisions, as it is designed for conversations about behaviour change. MI has not previously been attempted in this context. This paper reflects on how MI can be incorporated successfully into PMTCT counselling and what lessons can be learnt regarding how to conduct training with counsellors. Methods: Thirty-eight lay and nurse counsellors at four sites in Southern Africa were trained in MI. After the initial training, they participated in a five-month inquiry group at each site, where an action researcher (AR) facilitated ongoing learning of new counselling skills and reflection. Transcripts of recorded counselling sessions were then analysed using the motivational interviewing treatment integrity (MITI) code to assess their skills in MI. The MITI analysis was discussed with the action researchers and a consensus was reached on how to improve training. Results: Overall, the counsellors showed a global rating score of four out of seven, a reflection-to-question ratio of 0, a 43 % open question score, an 18 % complex reflection score and a 58 % MI-adherent score. There were significant differences between the sites and between nurses and lay counsellors (p < 0. 05). The action researchers suggested that the following factors were important in enabling learning and change: assessment of the baseline level of skills and readiness to change, reflection on real consultations, differences between the ARs and counsellors, a focus on the overall spirit of MI versus technical skills, the approach to information giving, managerial support and an appreciative versus a critical facilitation style. Conclusion: Nurse counsellors in Namibia and Swaziland demonstrated beginning proficiency in MI, while lay counsellors in South Africa did not. From the dialogue with the action researchers, nine recommendations were made to guide the development of future training programmes. Articl...|$|R
