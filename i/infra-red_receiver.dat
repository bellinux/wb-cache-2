The first remote SCPH-10150 came bundled (as SCPH-10170) with an <b>infra-red</b> <b>receiver</b> dongle SCPH-10160 which attached {{to one of the}} PlayStation 2's controller ports; this dongle is not needed on later PS2 models (beginning from SCPH-500xx) and slimline PS2 models (SCPH-700xx to SCPH-900xx) as they feature an integrated IR port.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} a low-power <b>infra-red</b> communications <b>receiver</b> chip designed using asynchronous techniques. We focus on aspects that {{were difficult to}} implement asynchronously, and contrast our techniques with synchronous ones, where possible. We also detail the methodology used to design the chip, and the asynchronous toolset that was created to support it. 1. Introduction Asynchronous logic design is currently receiving much attention {{as an alternative to}} traditional synchronous design [2], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [13], [14]. Asynchronous designs do not use a global clock, simplifying global chip routing and eliminating problems due to clock skew. Furthermore, a large portion of a synchronous chip's power budget is dedicated to driving the clock, whereas elimination of the global clock in an asynchronous chip allows it to achieve near-zero standby power when quiescent. For this reason asynchronous design is particularly attractive for battery operated applications. Unfortu [...] ...|$|R
50|$|The PS1 Pro was {{a special}} {{production}} order for a German Distributor, and was more expensive {{than any of the}} Grado line. A partnership between headphone manufacturer Grado and wireless technologies manufacturer FreeSystems paved way for the FreeSystems headphones. The FreeSystems package included an integrated Grado RA 1 amplifier (as mentioned above), headphones which have a physical appearance {{similar to that of the}} Grado PS1, and a Free Systems <b>infra-red</b> transmitter and <b>receiver.</b> The RRP was US$3,800. The system was intended for release by February 2002, but was never released.|$|R
40|$|AbstractAutomatic switch is an {{automatic}} electrical device that uses sensor technology to detect movement, or body temperature that was {{detected in the}} switch. The sensor uses passive <b>infra-red</b> <b>receiver</b> (PIR) by using lithium tantalite (LiTaO 3) that will capture a moment as a response in temperature changes. In this research, we synthesized a thin film of lithium tantalite (LiTaO 3) on a substrate silicon p-type. The film was produced by chemical solution deposition (CSD) and engineering spin coatings with temperature annealing on 550 °C, 600 °C, 650 °C, 700 °C, 750 °C and 800 °C with 3000 rpm in speed for around 30 seconds. The value of high absorbent showed that the LiTaO 3 film has {{a large number of}} photon energy. This research obtained the energy band-gap film LiTaO 3 in the range 3. 41 - 4. 56 eV. This result concludes that annealed temperatures affects the optical properties of the LiTaO 3 film in the substrate of Si (100) p-type semiconductor. The sensitivity of this high intensity absorbent for energy and high value of band-gap is great and is therefore potential to be used prospectively for the automatic switch sensor on the satellite platform...|$|E
