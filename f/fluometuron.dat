The objective of these studies was to evaluate effects of tillage and cover crop management on <b>fluometuron</b> sorption and degradation. Length of equilibration time and organic C level appeared to be the dominant factors influencing <b>fluometuron</b> sorption quantity and kinetics. Related to these factors, resident time and plant surface accumulation of organic residues may influence the potential for subsequent movement in soil.

The effects of long-term no-tillage practices on <b>fluometuron</b> degradation were studied in a Dundee silt loam under laboratory conditions. Soil was collected at four depths (0 – 2, 2 – 5, 5 – 10, and 10 – 25 cm) from field plots following 11 years of continuous no-tillage (NT) or conventional tillage (CT). Organic carbon content, microbial biomass, and fluorescein diacetate (FDA) -hydrolytic activity were 48, 106, and 127 % greater, respectively, in the upper 2 cm of NT soil compared to CT soil. Microbial biomass and FDA-hydrolytic activity were 39 – 66 and 34 – 99 % greater in the CT compared to NT soil, respectively, in the 2 – 5 and 5 – 10 cm depths. <b>Fluometuron</b> degradation was assessed under laboratory conditions using 14 C-ring labeled <b>fluometuron.</b> <b>Fluometuron</b> was degraded more rapidly at depths between 0 and 10 cm of the CT soil relative to the NT soil. <b>Fluometuron</b> degradation was described as first-order (k 0 : 0754, 0. 0608, 0. 0273, and 0. 0074 per day in the 0 – 2, 2 – 5, 5 – 10, and 10 – 25 cm depths of CT soils compared to 0. 035, 0. 0368, 0. 0145, and 0. 0138 per day in respective depths of NT soil).

40|$|Currently, 74 % {{of cotton}} {{acres in the}} United States are planted with {{glyphosate}}tolerant varieties. The average glyphosate-tolerant cotton crop is treated with glyphosate 2. 1 times each year {{in addition to other}} herbicides, insecticides, and fungicides. The primary objectives of this research were to: 1) describe the influence of glyphosate and pesticides commonly applied at or near the time of cotton planting on soil microbial activity and biomass; 2) study the effect of glyphosate on <b>fluometuron</b> degradation; 3) evaluate the response of Rhizoctonia solani to glyphosate and fluometuron; 4) study changes in glyphosate metabolism that occur as a result of repeated glyphosate applications; and 5) define shifts in the soil microbial community. Additionally, methods for accelerated solvent extraction (ASE) of <b>fluometuron</b> from soils were developed. In one experiment, the addition of glyphosate reduced C-mineralization in soils treated with <b>fluometuron,</b> aldicarb, or mefenoxam + PCNB formulations. However, in a second experiment, C-mineralization increased when glyphosate was applied with <b>fluometuron</b> relative to <b>fluometuron</b> applied alone. Accelerated solvent extraction was used in experiments which demonstrated that application of glyphosate with <b>fluometuron</b> increased the rate of <b>fluometuron</b> degradation in soil relative to <b>fluometuron</b> alone. When glyphosate was added to minimal medium, degradation of <b>fluometuron</b> by R. solani was reduced and less fungal biomass was produced. The total amount of 14 C-glyphosate mineralized was reduced when glyphosate was applied 5 times relative to 1, 2, 3, or 4 times. Incorporation of 14 Cglyphosate residues into soil microbial biomass was greater following five glyphosate applications than one application 3 and 7 days after application (DAA). Soil fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) profiles were altered by five glyphosate applications relative to one application. Additionally, FAMEs common to gram-negative bacteria were present in higher concentrations following five applications relative to 1, 2, 3, or 4 applications both 7 and 14 DAA. These studies indicated that: 1) glyphosate altered the soil microbial response to other pesticides; 2) fluometuron-degrading microorganisms in soil responded differently to glyphosate; 3) changes in the dissipation or distribution of glyphosate following repeated glyphosate applications were associated with changes in the structural diversity of the soil microbial community...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} three tillage {{implements}} (field cultivator, disk harrow, rotary harrow) {{on the soil}} incorporation of various herbicides and consequently on the efficacy of these herbicides against the weeds and on their selectivity on cotton, was evaluated in four field experiments conducted in Northern Greece during 2003 and 2004. All experimental plots were irrigated with sprinklers, immediately after the pre-emergence application of herbicides, while later all plots were irrigated with either drip irrigation or mobile sprinklers. The herbicide treatments consisted of a broadcast preplant-incorporated (PPI) application of s-metolachlor or trifluralin followed by pre-emergence (PRE) applied prometryn, a pre-emergence 38 cm band application of s-metolachlor + <b>fluometuron</b> and a broadcast PPI application of s-metolachlor followed by post-emergence applied trifloxysulfuron-sodium or pyrithiobac. The PPI application of s-metolachlor or trifluralin followed by PRE application of prometryn resulted the greatest control of redroot pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus L.), common lambsquarters (Chenopodium album L.) and black nightshade (Solanum nigrum L.). The efficacy of herbicides against common lambsquarters and black nightshade was slightly reduced when they were incorporated into the soil with the rotary harrow. Cotton plant emergence, number of bolls, boll opening and cotton lint yield were not affected in most cases by the tillage implement. Cotton lint yield in plots irrigated with drip irrigation was higher or equal with plots irrigated with sprinklers. The effect of three tillage implements (field cultivator, disk harrow, rotary harrow) and various herbicides was also evaluated in two field experiments conducted in Northern Greece during 2006 and 2007. Herbicide treatments included the pre-plant incorporation of s-metolachlor + <b>fluometuron,</b> trifluralin + <b>fluometuron,</b> ethalfluralin, pendimethalin + <b>fluometuron,</b> <b>fluometuron.</b> Irrigation with sprinklers was not made after cotton sowing. Cotton lint yield in plots treated with preplant incorporated s-metolachlor + <b>fluometuron</b> was equal to plots treated with trifluralin + <b>fluometuron</b> or pendimethalin + <b>fluometuron,</b> but significantly higher than plots treated with ethalfluralin or <b>fluometuron.</b> The incorporation of herbicides in the soil with disk harrow or field cultivator compared to rotary harrow, provided higher efficacy against some weeds and similar effect on cotton plant emergence, number of bolls, bolls opening and cotton lint yield. In addition, the fossil-fuel and labor time requirements of disk harrow and field cultivator were {{lower than that of}} rotary harrow. The findings of this study showed that the herbicides trifluralin, s-metolachlor or pendimethalin in tank mix with <b>fluometuron</b> or prometryn should be used for effective control of broad leaved weeds in cotton. Finally, drip irrigation combined with the PPI application of s-metolachlor or pendimethalin in tank mix with <b>fluometuron</b> and incorporated in the soil with field cultivator or disk harrow should be the first choice of cotton growers in integrated crop management systems. ...|$|E

In this work, organoclays were prepared by treating Wyoming montmorillonite (SWy- 2) and Arizona montmorillonite (SAz- 1) with different organic cations and were assayed as soil amendments to enhance the retention and reduce the leaching losses of the herbicide <b>fluometuron</b> [N,N-dimethyl-N′-[3 -(trifluoromethyl) phenyl] urea] in soils. Two agricultural soils from Southern Spain were selected for being high-risk scenarios of ground and surface water contamination. First, a batch adsorption study was conducted to identify organoclays with high affinity for <b>fluometuron.</b> Among the different organoclays assayed, spermine-treated Wyoming montmorillonite (SW-SPERM) displayed high and reversible adsorption of <b>fluometuron</b> and was selected as an amendment for subsequent persistence, leaching, and herbicidal activity experiments of <b>fluometuron</b> with unamended and amended soils. Amendment of the soils with SW-SPERM at rates of 1 %, 2 %, and 5 % greatly enhanced <b>fluometuron</b> retention by the soils and retarded <b>fluometuron</b> leaching through soil columns. Incubation experiments revealed that the persistence of the herbicide in the amended soils was similar to that in unamended soils and that most of the herbicide was ultimately available for degradation.

The effect of amending soil with six biochars made from different feedstocks on the sorption and leaching of <b>fluometuron</b> and 4 -chloro- 2 -methylphenoxyacetic acid (MCPA) was compared to the effect of other sorbents: an activated carbon, a Ca-rich Arizona montmorillonite modified with hexadecyltrimethylammonium organic cation (SA-HDTMA), and an agricultural organic residue from olive oil production (OOW). Soil was amended at 2 % (w/w), and studies were performed following a batch equilibration procedure. Sorption of both herbicides increased in all amended soils, but decreased in soil amended with a biochar produced from macadamia nut shells made with fast pyrolysis. Lower leaching of the herbicides was observed in the soils amended with the biochars with higher surface areas BC 5 and BC 6 and the organoclay (OCl). Despite the increase in herbicide sorption in soils amended with two hardwood biochars (BC 1 and BC 3) and OOW, leaching of <b>fluometuron</b> and MCPA was enhanced with the addition of these amendments as compared to the unamended soil. The increased leaching is due to some amendments' soluble organic compounds, which compete or associate with herbicide molecules, enhancing their soil mobility. Thus, the results indicate that not all biochar amendments will increase sorption and decrease leaching of <b>fluometuron</b> and MCPA.

40|$|A {{strategy}} {{based on}} the random isolation and screening of soybean cDNAs encoding cytochrome P 450 monooxygenases (P 450 s) was used {{in an attempt to}} identify P 450 isozymes involved in herbicide metabolism. Nine full-length (or near-full-length) P 450 cDNAs representing eight distinct P 450 families were isolated by using PCR-based technologies. Five of the soybean P 450 cDNAs were expressed successfully in yeast, and microsomal fractions generated from these strains were tested for their potential to catalyze the metabolism of 10 herbicides and 1 insecticide. In vitro enzyme assays showed that the gene product of one heterologously expressed P 450 cDNA (CYP 71 A 10) specifically catalyzed the metabolism of phenylurea herbicides, converting four herbicides of this class (<b>fluometuron,</b> linuron, chlortoluron, and diuron) into more polar compounds. Analyses of the metabolites suggest that the CYP 71 A 10 encoded enzyme functions primarily as an N-demethylase with regard to <b>fluometuron,</b> linuron, and diuron, and as a ring-methyl hydroxylase when chlortoluron is the substrate. In vivo assays using excised leaves demonstrated that all four herbicides were more readily metabolized in CYP 71 A 10 -transformed tobacco compared with control plants.

40|$|Increasing {{populations of}} glyphosate-resistant weeds, such as Palmer amaranth, have {{prompted}} growers to pursue alternative means of weed control in cotton. In many cropping systems, {{this means the}} utilization of older chemistries and residual herbicides. The goal {{of this research was}} to evaluate and understand the agronomic and environmental factors that affect the inconsistent injury often associated with these herbicides as well as determine the impact of Palmer amaranth emergence date on seed production, biomass, and cotton yield. Experiments were conducted in three counties in Arkansas giving a distinct range of climate and soil texture. Injury, biomass, and number of plants per m of row, number of seed per female Palmer amaranth plant, and cotton yield were assessed in experiments under various conditions. Seed vigor levels, seed size, stressed conditions, and planting depth constituted the majority of factors evaluated. Low seed vigor increased the risk of injury from diuron, fomesafen, and <b>fluometuron.</b> Increasing planting depth from 0. 64 to 2. 5 cm resulted in greater cotton injury from fomesafen but proved inconsequential when applying diuron or <b>fluometuron</b> preemergence. Cotton injury from glufosinate was observed on two Widestrike® cultivars {{and to a lesser extent}} on a Liberty Link® cultivar. Injury from glufosinate was significantly increased when cotton was shaded prior to application.

Due to the continuous emergence pattern of tropical spiderwort, successful management will require a multi-component approach that includes an effective herbicide with soil residual activity. Field studies were conducted in Georgia and North Carolina to evaluate the effectiveness of several preemergence herbicides in suppressing tropical spiderwort emergence.

The fresh weight of both species was greatly decreased by trifluralin followed by fluometu-ron and atrazine. The dry weight was, in general, only slightly decreased by all the herbicides with the largest response with trifluralin. On the other hand, the activit-ies of PAL and Cl were greatly enhanced in both species by alachlor and rimsulfuron, but decreased by trifluralin. <b>Fluometuron</b> induced decreases in PAL activity of maize only and decreased Cl activity of maize and soybean seedlings. Moreover, hydroxyphen-olic compounds were increased in both species by alachlor and rimsulfuron and decreased by trifluralin and atrazine. Similarly, anthocyanin content was increased in both seedlings by alachlor and rimsulfu-ron, but decreased by trifluralin and <b>fluometuron,</b> whereas atrazine decreased the anthocyanin content in maize only. The present results indicate that stress is maintained by the different herbicides and confirm the controlling action of PAL and Cl on the production of anthocyanin and phenolic compounds during the induced state of stress. In addition, dry weight reduc-tion appeared to coincide with the changes in the parameters of secondary metabolism, suggesting a regulatory role of secondary metabolism on seedling growth.

40|$|Agricultural {{production}} {{is a major}} source of revenue in Arkansas. In order to increase productivity, it has been necessary to rely increasingly on the use of pesticides and irrigation water. In the last 15 years several states have reported finding pesticides in groundwater as a result of normal agricultural practices. Since almost half of the population also relies on groundwater as their source of drinking water, it is necessary to conduct research as to ascertain {{the presence or absence of}} commonly used pesticides in groundwater. Multi residue analytical techniques were developed for the analysis of acifluorfen, alachlor, atrazine, cyanazine, diuron, <b>fluometuron,</b> linuron, metolachlor and propanil from groundwater, by either GLC or HPLC. Analytical sensitivities ranged from 1 to 5 ppb. Groundwater samples were collected from three areas of southeastern Arkansas that are under heavy agricultural production.

For the 21 preemergence herbicides, planting was done before application {{in half the}} plot {{and then in the}} other half. After incorporating the 5 preplant-incorporated products, half the plot was ridged before planting while the remainder was planted without ridging. The recommended rate for heavy soils was applied, plus the double and quadruple of this rate, to establish the margin of selectivity. Injury ratings taken 30, 45, 60, 90 and 110 days after planting showed that the herbicides linuron, norea, <b>fluometuron,</b> chlorbromuron, diuron, fluoiodifen, nitrofen, pronamide, methazole, butachlor, alachlor, DNBP, chloramben, cyanazine, benthiocarb, trifluralin and nitralin were highly selective in cassava.

40|$|During {{the summer}} of 1997, water samples were {{collected}} and analyzed for pesticides from 32 playa lakes of the High Plains that receive drainage from both cotton and corn agriculture in West Texas. The major cotton herbicides detected in the water samples were diuron, <b>fluometuron,</b> metolachlor, norflurazon, and prometryn. Atrazine and propazine, corn and sorghum herbicides, also were routinely detected in samples from the playa lakes. Furthermore, the metabolites of all the herbicides studied {{were found in the}} playa-lake samples. In some cases, the concentration of metabolites was equal to or exceeded the concentration of the parent compound. The types of metabolites detected suggested that the parent compounds had been transported to and had undergone degradation in the playa lakes. The types of metabolites and the ratio of metabolites to parent compounds may be useful in indicating the time that the herbicides were transported to the playa lakes. The median concentration of total herbicides was 7. 2 micrograms per liter, with the largest total concentrations exceeding 30 micrograms per liter.

40|$|Specific {{growth rate}} {{constants}} {{were used to}} evaluate the effects of selected herbicides on Erwinia carotovora, Pseudomonas fluorescens, and Bacillus sp. Comparison of growth rate constants permitted the identification of either stimulatory or inhibitory effects of these substances. E. carotovora was inhibited by 6, 7 -dihydrodipyrido(1, 2 -a: 2 ′-c) pyrazinediium (diquat) and 4 -hydroxy- 3, 5 -diiodobenzonitrile (ioxynil) at 25 μg/ml; 1, 1 ′-dimethyl- 4, 4 ′-bipyridinium (paraquat) at 50 μg/ml; and pentachlorophenol (PCP) at 10 μg/ml. P. fluorescens was inhibited by paraquat and PCP at 25 μg/ml and by 4 -amino- 3, 5, 6 -trichloropicolinic acid (picloram) at 50 μg/ml. Stimulation of P. fluorescens was observed with 4 -(methylsulfonyl) - 2, 6 -dinitro-N,N-dipropylaniline (nitralin) at 25 μg/ml.

40|$|Field {{studies were}} {{conducted}} during 2006 and 2007 to evaluate control of saw greenbriar and southern dewberry by various pasture herbicides {{and to assess}} forage tolerance of Tifton 85 bermudagrass to these herbicides. Herbicides evaluated in each study included triclopyr, picloram, 2, 4 -D, fluroxypyr, dicamba, aminopyralid, metsulfuron methyl and various combinations of the above. Visual ratings were taken on each herbicide efficacy experiment. Visual evaluations of phytotoxicity, measurements of dry matter yield, and forage quality were quantified {{for each of the}} bermudagrass tolerance trials. Saw greenbriar was best controlled at approximately one year after treatment by triclopyr at 10. 9 % ae v/v with diesel as the carrier (88 - 98 %), although the lower rate of triclopyr + diesel at 0. 87 % ae v/v + 5 % v/v and triclopyr alone at 0. 87 % ae v/v provided 49 to 86 % control. Triclopyr + fluroxypyr at 0. 25 % ai v/v + 0. 086 % ai v/v gave best control of southern dewberry in both years when applied as an individual plant treatment (IPT) six weeks after shredding. In general, shredding 45 days prior to herbicide application gave an advantage to southern dewberry control versus not shredding. In 2006, triclopyr + fluroxypyr (IPT) was the only treatment to decrease Tifton 85 dry matter yield at the first harvest, with no effect observed at the second harvest. In 2007, both broadcast treatments containing triclopyr + fluroxypyr and the IPT treatment of triclopyr decreased dry matter yield at the first harvest, with triclopyr (IPT) being the only treatment to lower dry matter yield at the second harvest. Field studies were also conducted in 2006 and 2007 to assess sharppod morningglory control in Roundup Ready Flex? and LibertyLink? cotton systems. Herbicides evaluated included glyphosate, glufosinate, prometryn, <b>fluometuron,</b> and diuron. Visual ratings of percent weed control and sharppod morningglory plant counts were taken to assess control. Prometryn at 1. 8 kg ai ha?? and <b>fluometuron</b> at 1. 8 kg ai ha?? provided significant preemergence control (33 - 81 %) of seedling sharppod morningglory. All rates of glyphosate (1. 06 and 1. 54 kg ai ha??) and glufosinate (0. 45 and 0. 6 kg ai ha??) controlled sharppod morningglory from 55 to 100 % at both application timings. The addition of diuron at 1. 12 kg ai ha?? to glyphosate and glufosinate at the late season application enhanced sharppod morningglory control by 3 to 16 %.

40|$|Because of {{the concern}} for {{potential}} contamination of ground water by agricultural chemicals, 38 wells drilled in the Mississippi River Valley alluvial aquifer in Mississippi County and the eastern parts of Craighead and Poinsett Counties, Arkansas were analyzed for pesticides and nitrate. The pesticide, <b>fluometuron,</b> was detected in one sample at a concentration of 0. 5 mg/L. Bentazon was detected in three samples at concentrations of 2. 5, 0. 3, and 0. 3 mg/L. The occurrences of the pesticides appear to represent isolated incidents rather than a widespread aquifer contamination. All detections were below health and safety standards. Nitrate is present in several wells at concentrations above 0. 15 mg/L, one of which exceeded the EPA established maximum contaminant level for drinking water of 10 milligrams per liter as nitrogen. Except for two wells nitrate and iron are not present together at concentrations above 0. 15 mg!L. This is probably due to microbially mediated reactions. Nitrate concentrations above 0. 15 mg/L is only present in wells that are less than 60 feet deep and near permeable soils.

40|$|Water-sampler {{equilibrium}} partitioning coefficients and aqueous {{boundary layer}} mass transfer coefficients for atrazine, diuron, hexazionone and <b>fluometuron</b> onto C 18 and SDB-RPS Empore disk-based aquatic passive samplers have been determined experimentally under a laminar flow regime (Re = 5400). The method involved accelerating {{the time to}} equilibrium of the samplers by exposing them to three water concentrations, decreasing stepwise to 50 % and then 25 % of the original concentration. Assuming first-order Fickian kinetics across a rate-limiting aqueous boundary layer, both parameters are determined computationally by unconstrained nonlinear optimization. In addition, a method of estimation of mass transfer coefficients-therefore sampling rates-using the dimensionless Sherwood correlation developed for laminar flow over a flat plate is applied. For each of the herbicides, this correlation is validated to within 40 % of the experimental data. The study demonstrates that for trace concentrations (sub 0. 1 mu g/L) and these flow conditions, a naked Empore disk performs well as an integrative sampler over short deployments (up to 7 days) for the range of polar herbicides investigated. The SDB-RPS disk allows a longer integrative period than the C 18 disk due to its higher sorbent mass and/or its more polar sorbent chemistry. This work also suggests that for certain passive sampler designs, empirical estimation of sampling rates may be possible using correlations that have been available in the chemical engineering literature for some time...|$|E

Activated carbon was applied at 0, 150 and 300 pounds per acre, broadcast basis, while diuron, linuron, <b>fluometuron</b> and metobromuron were applied at rates of 1. 0 and 2. 0, 2. 0 and 4. 0, 1. 0 and 2. 0, and 1. 0 and 2. 0 lbs /acre, respectively. The results obtained showed that when activated carbon was used as a band treatment of one inch over the row (broadcast basis) at a rate of 150 pounds per acre, prior to herbicide application, good crop protection was obtained for all herbicide treatments at all rates. However, the activated carbon also protected that weeds that germinated under the carbon band. In the greenhouse, the influence of band width was determined by applying 0, 150 and 300 pounds per acre of carbon in bands of 1. 0 and 3. 0 inches in width. A carbon band of 1. 0 inch provided adequate protection to the beans for all rates tested. No injury was observed in either the roots or the shoots, for all rates tested. The effectiveness of activated carbon in protecting four plant species, beans, ryegrass (Lolium perenne Var. Linn L.), pigweed Amaranthus retroflexus L.) and barnyardgrass (Echinochloa crusgalli (L) Beauv) from diuron injury was also determined in a greenhouse experiment. It was found that activated carbon to diuron ratios of 100 : 1 were effective in protecting the four species tested. Experiments with 2 -gram "packets" of vermiculite with carbon showed that beans were protected from diuron injury only when the packet contained carbon. Application of activated carbon mixed in with a vermiculite "packet" was as effective as applying the carbon in a one-inch band over the row. In an experiment involving alternate wetting and drying of activated carbon no decrease of the adsorptive capacity of the carbon was observed. In the laboratory the adsorption of diuron at 7, 10 and 20 ppm by four commercial types of activated carbon (Aqua Nuchar A, Darco-M, Gro-Safe and Pittsburg No. 3) was determined. The results indicated that differences exist between different carbon sources. The greater the surface area of the carbon, the greater its adsorptivity. Desorption studies with diuron at 20 ppm and four different activated carbon sources showed that the degree of desorption also varied between the carbon sources...|$|E
