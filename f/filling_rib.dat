25|$|This example {{clearly states}} what appeal to ignorance is, {{although}} we have proved that the moon is not made of spare ribs, we have not proved that its core cannot be filled with them; therefore, the moon’s core is <b>filled</b> with spare <b>ribs.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{windows and}} {{ceilings}} in the cloister and chapter house are fine examples of mediaeval stonework. The rib-vaulted ceiling is constructed from stone <b>ribs</b> <b>filled</b> in with stone blocks. There are decorative carved faces along the cloister where the vaulting ribs {{emerge from the}} walls.|$|R
40|$|Innovative stone arch {{footbridges}} made of two stone arch ribs {{supporting the}} deck are introduced. Therefore, stone ribs are not stabilized by earth <b>filling</b> between <b>ribs</b> and deck, since the arches {{are connected to}} the deck through steel members supporting it. Stone arches are made of squared elements connected one to the other by only contact forces. Prestressing is obtained through tendons placed in drilled holes. Contact forces are thus increased and the eccentricity of the arch compressive force due to external loads (including seismic action) controlled, too. Stone elements are jointed by interposing a layer of fibre-reinforced mortar between them. Steel members supporting the deck {{are connected to the}} arches through a steel plate inserted between two stone elements, and interposed between two mortar layers. Prestressed stone arch footbridges show to have high aesthetic value, with the horizontal deck distant from the stone arch ribs...|$|R
40|$|Heat {{transfer}} and {{mass flow rate}} in a natural convection vertical channel was investigated using a CFD code coupled with anoptimization dedicated software. The channel was considered bidimensional and set in vertical position, immersed in air, witha heated wall at uniform temperature condition, the other wall being adiabatic. The channel was open {{at the bottom and}} at thetop to allow the natural circulation of the ambient air. The heated wall was <b>filled</b> with <b>ribs</b> whose height, width, pitch, thermal conductivity and side wall inclination were variable. The analysis proceeded through the following steps: a) results validation versus schlieren experiments [1]; b) performance comparison: ribbed versus smooth configuration; c) smooth channel sensitivity analysis; d) ribbed channel sensitivity analysis; e) ribbed channel DOE sampling; f) ribbed channel optimization through genetic and simplex algorithms, aiming at average heat {{transfer and}} mass flow maximization. In the first steps the existence of an optimal channel width was investigated; the results coming from the latter steps clearly show the importance of the rib height: higher ribs strongly disturb the air stream leading to a performance drop...|$|R
50|$|Horse flesh ribs are cut {{out with}} the meat and hung for 5-7 hours to drain the {{remaining}} blood. The intestines of the horse are thoroughly washed and kept in saline water for 1-2 hours. The meat from the ribs is salted, seasoned with pepper and garlic and left roped in cloth for 2-3 hours. Then the intestines are <b>filled</b> with the <b>rib</b> meat and the two ends of the filled intestine are tied. After this preparation, the kazy can be smoked or hung to dry for {{a week at a}} sun-lit placed exposed to wind. Smoking is performed in a thick smoke of 50-60° for 12-18 hours.|$|R
50|$|The Sländan (Dragonfly) was {{the first}} Swedish {{microlight}} apart from glider based types. It is built from composite materials, with a square section beam formed in two halves supporting the engine well ahead of the wing leading edge and extending aft continuously to the tail. The wings, rectangular in plan and with a high aspect ratio (10:1), {{are attached to the}} beam with dihedral of 1.5°. Ailerons cover 30% of the trailing edge. The wing has two pressed spars, foam <b>filled</b> glass fibre <b>ribs</b> and Kevlar <b>filled</b> glass fibre sandwich skins. The butterfly tail surfaces are also rectangular and assisted by a short ventral fin with the same chord as the tailplane.|$|R
2500|$|The VT-16 Orlik was {{designed}} by Jiri Matejček and is a high-wing monoplane of all-wood construction, except that the skin is stabilized with polystyrene foam. Its wing has a single spar structure with a forward torsion box; the whole wing is plywood skinned and foam <b>filled,</b> allowing the <b>ribs</b> to be comparatively widely spaced. [...] In plan it is straight-tapered with blunt tips; there are 3° of dihedral. [...] It has conventional plain ailerons and spoilers at mid-chord, which extend both {{above and below the}} wing. [...] At the time of its first flight in August 1959 it was a Standard Class glider with a [...] span. [...] Later aircraft had [...] and [...] spans but it was the 16 m version that went into series production.|$|R
40|$|Guanine {{nucleotide}} exchange factor (GEF) {{domains of}} the Dbl family {{occur in a}} variety of proteins that include multiple protein-protein and protein-lipid interaction domains. We used an epithelial-derived cell line to investigate the mechanisms by which the two GEF domains of Kalirin, a neuronal Rho GEF, influence morphology. As expected, Kal-GEF 1, an efficient GEF for Rac 1 and RhoG, induced the formation of lamellipodia resembling those induced by active Rac 1. Although Kal-GEF 1 activated Rac and Pak, its ability to induce formation of lamellipodia was not blocked by dominant negative Rho GTPases or by catalytically inactive Pak. Consistent with this, a catalytically inactive mutant of Kal-GEF 1 induced formation of lamellipodia and activated Pak. Active Pak was required for the GEF-activity independent effect of Kal-GEF 1 and the lamellipodia produced were <b>filled</b> with <b>ribs</b> of filamentous actin. Kal-GEF 1 and a GEF-dead mutant co-immunoprecipitated with Pak. The interaction of Kal-GEF 1 with Pak is indirect and requires the regulatory protein binding domain of Pak. Filamin A, which is known to interact with and activate Pak, binds to both catalytically active and inactive Kal-GEF 1, providing a link by which catalytically inactive Kal-GEF 1 can activate Pak and induce lamellipodia. Together, our results indicate that Kal-GEF 1 induces lamellipodia through activation of Pak, where GEF activity is not required. GEF-activity-independent effects on downstream targets may be a general property of RhoGEFs...|$|R
40|$|A 76 -year-old {{woman with}} {{compression}} fracture of L 1 underwent percutaneous balloon kyphoplasty using polymethyl meth-acrylate. Three years after kyphoplasty of L 1, {{the patient was}} readmitted with severe low back pain. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed progressive collapse of L 1 vertebra and new compression fracture at T 12. There were no signs of infe-ction. As conservative treatment failed, combined surgery consisting of anterior corpectomy of T 12 and L 1, interposition of a titanium mesh cage <b>filled</b> with autologous <b>rib</b> graft, and anterior instrumentation of T 11 -L 2 was performed. Histologic examination showed granulomatous inflammation surrounding the cement. Polymerase chain reaction {{and culture of the}} specimen confirmed the diagnosis of tuberculosis. The anti-tuberculous medications were administered for 10 months, and the patient recovered without any sequelae. Tuberculous spondylitis {{should be included in the}} differential diagnosis of spondylitis after cement augmentation. If conservative antibiotic therapy fails, resection of the infected bone-cement com-plex is indicated...|$|R
40|$|SPA] En 1536 los visitadores de la Orden de Santiago deciden construir una nueva iglesia parroquial en Caravaca de la Cruz (Murcia) {{debido a}} que el antiguo templo, incluso ampliado, se había quedado pequeño frente al importante crecimiento de la población de la villa. Existen diferentes hipótesis sobre la autoría de las trazas para la nueva iglesia, pero una de las más sólidas señala a Jerónimo Quijano como posible tracista (Gutiérrez-Cortines 1989 pp. 299 - 315). Las obras comenzaron pocos años antes de 1540 y se alargaron durante los siglos siguientes, en varias fases y con diferentes maestros cantero. [ENG] The presbytery {{of the church of}} El Salvador of Caravaca de la Cruz (Murcia) is covered by a mid- 16 th century trellis vault, built as a mesh of curved <b>ribs,</b> <b>filled</b> with coffers. Vandelvira's {{manuscript}} (ca. 1585) explains a number of constructive solutions for this kind of vaults where ribs are defined by spherical surface spanning a rectangular area. However, a number of studies show that many trellis vaults are not really spherical (Palacios [1990] 2003 pp. 302 - 321; Bravo 2009; Bravo 2011). Taking this into account, Bravo (2011) puts forward a geometrical classification. In this paper we shall present a three-dimensional survey of this trellis vault. We have analyzed its geometry, checking it is not a spherical surface and, furthermore, it cannot be included in any type of classification posited in previous studies. Then we will pose a hypothesis about the process of vault formal generation, stressing its differences with Vandelvira's trellis vaults...|$|R
5000|$|The 1955 {{model year}} Chevrolet {{introduced}} its now-famous small-block V-8 — the first V-8 {{available in a}} Chevrolet since 1918. It has a displacement of [...] Prior to 1955, Chevrolet offered an inline [...] displacement in-line 6-cylinder engine only. The 1955 model, like its engine, was all new. The [...] "shoebox" [...] design, so named {{because it was the}} first Chevrolet to feature streamlined rear fenders, was a watershed for Chevrolet. The lightweight car, coupled with a powerful overhead valve V-8, became a showroom draw, but also thrust the company into the arena of competitive motorsports. 1955 Chevrolets went on to dominate drag racing and became a formidable force in circle track racing. In 1956, the design was lengthened somewhat in front and given a more squarish treatment; under the hood, engine power increased and a Chevrolet Corvette engine was available for the first time in a full-size passenger car. The V-shaped trim on the tail fins was <b>filled</b> with a <b>ribbed</b> aluminum insert exclusive to the Bel Air. The fuel-injected engine represented the first time that an internal combustion gasoline engine in a passenger car reached an advertised one horsepower for each cubic inch benchmark, although the Chrysler 300B beat that by a year in their 355-horsepower, 354 c.i.d dual-carburetored engine, and the Alfa Romeo Giulietta Sprint was introduced a year earlier than that (1954), with a 79 cubic inch (1290cc) engine that produced 80 hp. In NASCAR racing the 283 with its increased horsepower gave the '57 a dramatic advantage over the smaller 265 V8 the '55 and '56 had. NASCAR held the competition, especially the '55-'57 Chevrolet to a cubic inch restriction because of all the races the '57s were winning. This restriction stayed with the '55-'57 till they were grandfathered out of the lower NASCAR divisions in the 1970s as the '57 was still beating virtually all in their class.|$|R
