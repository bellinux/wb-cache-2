40|$|The {{clearances}} in {{the slide}} guide system of a hydraulic press {{are one of}} the significant factors affecting its accuracy. These clearances also affect the energy consumption of the press. An energy loss model that considers the oil leaks and friction associated with these clearances was proposed, and the size of clearances was optimized based on the model. The maximum allowable eccentric load and the energy loss on the wedge clearance condition were calculated to ensure the slide and <b>guide</b> <b>pillars</b> function properly. The stiffness of pillars and wear of guide rails were checked under an eccentric load condition. A case for rapid sheet metal forming with a 20 MN hydraulic press was examined. For this case, the optimum fit clearances were found to be approximately 0. 4 mm. The energy loss under an eccentric load condition was increased by approximately 83 % compared to a non-eccentric load condition. The pillars were optimized by reducing excessive stiffness, which served to decrease the pillar weight by nearly 20 %...|$|E

5000|$|Fire {{is perhaps}} the most memorable visual form by which God has made His {{presence}} known to men. The burning bush, the <b>guiding</b> <b>pillar</b> of fire, the all-consuming fire on Mount Carmel, the tongues of fire at Pentecost and the eventual purification of the world by fire are pictures that come quite readily to mind. Being symbolic, my representation of fire became formalized, differing from the fluctuating form of fire itself. An artist may frequently attempt to make a visual analogy between differing visual forms, creating a bridge that will unite seemingly disparate qualities to form a new reality. In bringing together the two halves of my design I trapped a space that outlines the form of a wheat ear, the wheat that God will harvest when the chaff has all been burned. At the center of the design is a calm, stable form in clear plexiglass which I think of as the quiet flame of God's presence -- the still small voice at the heart of every fiery experience.|$|R

40|$|When {{considering}} the theme ‘Towards {{building a new}} sport system’, {{it is important that}} as for any structure, there are strong foundations. Sport is a logical extension of a school’s physical education (PE) program (Commonwealth of Australia, 1992). Furthermore, research suggests that the optimum time for children to learn and refine their motor skills and to be introduced to positive PE experiences is during preschool and early primary school years. It is therefore argued that to build an ideal sport system, as suggested by the title, we need to ‘begin on the front foot’ through quality Health and Physical Education (HPE) implementation for children. More so, an ideal sport system requires an inclusive, developmentally appropriate and progressive infrastructure within schools that enhance success and opportunity, and ultimately health and wellbeing for all. This concept is supported by the inaugural ICHPER-SD world congress theme, ‘Child Health and the School’. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to share five essential <b>guiding</b> <b>pillars</b> from the recent Australian HPE curriculum reform; educative, strength-based, movement, health literacy, and critical inquiry (Macdonald, 2013). It is proposed that these pillars offer direction for building a sport system and are examined through investigating successful practical examples...|$|R

50|$|The {{subject of}} social {{entrepreneurship}} {{is a fairly}} new development in public policy curriculum, in 2013 Batten Professor Christine Mahoney and two students received {{a grant from the}} Jefferson Trust to fund classes, competitions, field work, and faculty. Social Entrepreneurship @ U.Va. (SE@UVA) is a pan-university interdisciplinary program that seeks to engage students in thought about social change through entrepreneurship in non-profits, NGOs, and government institutions. With a focus on creating value for multiple parties, not just focusing on shareholders, SE @ U.Va. features numerous classes for both graduate and undergraduate students at Batten, including a startup class open to all students, regardless of major or School. The program also sponsors student competitions and hosts lecture series. It centers on developing student skills in interdisciplinary fields, along with finance, policymaking, nonprofits, and international development, and focuses on enacting those skills in real life ventures. SE @ U.Va.'s projects are located in countries across the world, including Brazil, Tanzania, Rwanda, Zambia, and the Philippines. Classes are cross-listed in the Batten School, {{as well as in the}} Curry School of Education and the University of Virginia College of Arts and Sciences. It also works closely with the School of Engineering and Applied Science, Darden School of Business, and the McIntire School of Commerce.

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{molecular}} {{science and engineering}} – melding a deep understanding of molecular science with an engineering mind-set – is emerging as a powerful way to create novel, effective and sustainable solutions to global grand challenges, such as the growing threat of antimicrobial resistance. By blurring the boundaries between scientific and engineering disciplines, in this holistic approach, final function and end-use requirements {{become an integral part}} of the underlying scientific research. Commercially ready materials can thus become a reality in an accelerated, flexible and economic manner. In other words, molecular science and engineering can fundamentally alter the way molecules are identified and designed for real-world usage. It is not enough to simply make molecules; we must make molecules work for a complex world. The notion of bringing researchers, industry and government communities together to work on grand challenges has a long and illustrious history – think, for instance, of the Manhattan Project, the industrial scale-up of penicillin and the Moon landings. More recently, the idea of ‘convergence’ – tackling grand challenges with a multifaceted array of scientists, engineers, clinicians and beyond – has become more formally recognised as a valuable way to stimulate societally important and ground-breaking research. Molecular science and engineering is a specific, yet far-reaching, part of this convergence landscape. Within the growing worldwide molecular science and engineering community, the Institute for Molecular Science and Engineering (IMSE) was founded in 2015 as Imperial College London’s newest Global Institute. The Institute’s overarching aim is to bring the College’s engineers, scientists, medics and business researchers together with a wide array of external stakeholders – and to remove the boundaries between these disciplines – to find innovative molecular-based science and engineering solutions to pressing grand challenge problems. Imperial’s world-class researchers and facilities, together with its existing culture of collaboration, multidisciplinarity, research translation and grand challenge goals, make the College the perfect home for IMSE. The Institute’s three <b>guiding</b> <b>pillars</b> – advancing integrated transdisciplinary research, transforming education and enabling effective translation of research to industry – are used to steer the Institute’s community-building activities and to help overcome obstacles that are commonly encountered during convergence-style and transdisciplinary research. Such issues include organisational barriers in academic institutions, personal motivational issues for researchers (e. g., measures of success), poor communication between traditionally separated disciplines and between academia, industry and government, as well as a scarcity of suitably trained (i. e., collaboration-ready) science and engineering graduates. To that end, IMSE manages a range of activities that foster innovation and collaboration. For example, IMSE co-ordinates bespoke workshops to bring its large community of Imperial-based affiliates, as well as external partners, together to focus on specific grand challenge problems and industrial needs. IMSE catalyses new collaborations through seed-funded projects that enable the first steps towards transformative research goals. IMSE’s unique Master’s of Research in Molecular Science and Engineering has been designed to train the next generation of scientists and engineers, who are equipped to work across the important molecular science/engineering interface...|$|R
