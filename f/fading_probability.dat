40|$|UWB impulse radio {{communications}} can provide multi-path diversity when a rake receiver is used. The narrow time domain pulse can effectively combat the fading. Perfect pulse synchronisation is, however, required to obtain optimum performance.

We first devise a novel MAC paradigm for ad hoc networks when using these techniques in multipath fading environment. In such networks, the use of conventional directional antennas does not necessarily improve the system performance. On the other hand, the exploitation of {{the potential benefits of}} smart antenna systems and especially beamforming techniques needs a prior knowledge of the physical channel. Our proposition performs jointly channel estimation and radio resource sharing. We validate the fruitfulness of the proposed MAC and we evaluate the effects of the channel estimation on the network performance. We then present an accurate analytical model for the performance of IEEE 802.11 MAC protocol. We extend the latter model, by introducing the <b>fading</b> <b>probability,</b> to derive the saturation throughput for our proposed MAC when the simplest beamforming strategy is used in real multipath fading ad hoc networks.

40|$|Free-space optical (FSO) communication, or laser communication, {{is capable}} of {{providing}} high-rate communication links, meeting the growing downlink demand of space missions, including those on small-satellite platforms. FSO communication {{takes advantage of the}} high-gain nature of narrow laser beams to achieve higher link efficiency than traditional radio-frequency systems. In order for a FSO link to be established and maintained, the spacecraft's attitude determination and control system needs to provide accurate pointing at the optical ground station. However, small satellites, such as CubeSats, have limited ground-tracking capabilities with existing attitude sensors. Miniaturized laser beacon tracking system, on the other hand, has the potential to provide precise ground-based attitude knowledge, enabling laser communication to be accomplished on small-satellite platforms. This thesis details the development of a CubeSat-sized laser beacon camera capable of achieving a sub-milliradian attitude knowledge accuracy with low <b>fade</b> <b>probability</b> during various sky conditions, sufficient to support a high-rate FSO communication link on a CubeSat platform on low-Earth orbit.

40|$|Diversity {{techniques}} have been extensively considered for application in propagation media, examining various combining schemes, {{to mitigate the}} effects of short-term <b>fading</b> <b>probability</b> and consequently to reduce the required fading margin. Narrowband propagation measurements were conducted within a four-story building at Technical University of Athens under {{a number of different}} radio path conditions, using a dual-channel-receiving unit, consisting of two spectrum analyzers, controlled by a personal computer. This paper presents the results of indoor radio propagation using space and cross-polarization diversity measurements in an indoor wireless radio channel at 1. 8 GHz. Moreover, the diversity gain at 99 % signal reliability level and corresponding cross-correlation coefficients have been estimated by considering selection and maximal ratio-combining diversity schemes. The results are very important for system designers of indoor communication systems, involving data transmission on wireless mobile networks.

40|$|An encoder, {{subject to}} a rate constraint, wishes to {{describe}} a Gaussian source under squared error distortion. The decoder, besides receiving the encoder's description, also observes side information consisting of uncompressed source symbol subject to slow fading and noise. The decoder knows the fading realization but the encoder knows only its distribution. The rate-distortion function that simultaneously satisfies the distortion constraints for all fading states was derived by Heegard and Berger. A layered encoding strategy is considered in which each codeword layer targets a given fading state. When the side-information channel has two discrete fading states, the expected distortion is minimized by optimally allocating the encoding rate between the two codeword layers. For multiple fading states, the minimum expected distortion is formulated as the solution of a convex optimization problem with linearly many variables and constraints. Through a limiting process on the primal and dual solutions, it is shown that single-layer rate allocation is optimal when the <b>fading</b> <b>probability</b> density function is continuous and quasiconcave (e. g., Rayleigh, Rician, Nakagami, and log-normal). In particular, under Rayleigh fading, the optimal single codeword layer targets the least favorable state as if the side information was absent. Comment: 24 pages, 10 figure...|$|E

For this purpose, 106 realizations are conducted, and the PDF of the envelope is obtained for the bistatic and monostatic topologies for M[*]×[*] 1 [*]×[*] 1 (M[*]=[*] 1, 2, 3, 4). Figure  4 b shows the numerical simulation results. As shown, {{the results of the}} simulation and the above analytical calculations are in complete agreement. The PDF of a conventional one-way Rayleigh fading channel is also illustrated. We note that the PDF’s are normalized to unit transmit power. Deep fading in the PDF of the cascaded backscatter channel can be seen in Fig.  4 compared to the one-way Rayleigh channel, as it is shown from the left to right arrow. By increasing the number of the transmit antennas, the corresponding envelope PDF shifts to the right indicating reduced <b>fading</b> <b>probability.</b> The most significant change is seen in the transition from a fully correlated channel, where the PDF changes from an exponential distribution of the monostatic channel to a product of Rayleigh distribution for the bistatic channel with M transmitters. By increasing M, the PDF curves approach the Rayleigh distribution, in which a Rayleigh fading can express the cascade channel for massive numbers of coherent transmitters.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} the fading {{multiple input multiple output}} (MIMO) Gaussian broadcast channel (GBC), where a single transmitter with M elements broadcasts independent information to K users, each (possibly) having multiple elements, and full channel knowledge at the transmitter and receivers. Our {{purpose is to}} shed light on the property of physical degradedness {{in the context of the}} MIMO GBC with a thorough analysis of how it manifests itself algebraically and probabilistically. From an algebraic standpoint, we establish the necessary conditions for the MIMO GBC to be physically degraded. We characterize the space of fading states leading to physical degradedness and establish their full-dimensionality. Subsequently we analyze the MIMO GBC from a probabilistic standpoint and show that when the number of receiving elements for every user is greater than or equal to that at the transmitter, the <b>fading</b> <b>probability</b> distribution may lead to nonzero probability that the channel is physically degraded. Finally we {{consider the}} special case of i. i. d Rayleigh fading, and establish asymptotic results in the number of users (K), and the number of transmit elements (M) : as K increases, the probability of physical degradedness tends to zero; and, as M increases together with the number of receive elements at each user, the probability of physical degradedness also tends to zero.

The optical fiber is modeled {{by the use}} of a discrete set of reflectors positioned randomly along the fiber. The {{statistics of}} the reflected light from a traveling pulse are derived. The statistics of the signal are used to calculate the characteristics of shot noise in the photodetector, and the probability that noise of certain intensity will occur. An estimation of the backscattered power is made by calculating the fraction of the backscattered power that is captured in a guiding mode. Upper power limits are calculated by considering nonlinear optical effects. An estimation of noise from thermally excited sound waves, amplified by Brillouin scattering, is derived. This noise considers the parameters of a photodetector, giving a model for the noise in the measurable photocurrent.

The equipment under test uses 2  ×  2 multi-input multi-output (MIMO), there are two spatial streams where both horizontal and vertically polarized signals are utilized.

However, inertial-based attitude sensors often limit ground tracking capability of the satellite due to high ephemeris uncertainty of most CubeSats. Laser beacon tracking directly measures of the satellite’s attitude relative to a ground station or target, eliminating attitude errors induced in the coordinate frame conversion process.
