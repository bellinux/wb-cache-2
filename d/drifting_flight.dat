He took advantage of this quiet period to test his spatial awareness and motor control, which he found was broadly unaffected by weightlessness, and to eat a light meal. He powered the spacecraft back up over the Indian Ocean, and continued over the Pacific.

High resolution free-fluid electrophoresis of particles proposed in the late 1960 s to take advantage of reduced gravity began with brief experiments done during two Apollo flights. The recent Apollo Soyuz Test Project mission had two major experiments that accomplished the separation of viable biological cells. Experiments now are being planned for the Space Shuttle which will attempt to achieve high resolution of the separated species by using zone electrophoresis. These experiments will return a quantity sufficient for laboratory testing and establish the potential of fractionation and purification of biological materials in space...|$|E

50|$|With delayed extraction, {{the mass}} {{resolution}} is improved {{due to the}} correlation between velocity and position of the ions after those have been produced in the ion source. Ions produced with greater kinetic energy have a higher velocity and during the delay time move closer to the extraction electrode before the accelerating voltage is applied across the target or pulsed electrode. The slower ions with less kinetic energy stay closer to a surface of the target electrode or pulsed electrode when the accelerating voltage is applied and therefore start being accelerated at a greater potential compared to the ions farther from the target electrode. With the proper delay time, the slower ions will receive enough extra potential energy to catch the faster ions after flying {{some distance from the}} pulsed acceleration system. Ions of the same mass-to-charge ratio will then <b>drift</b> through the <b>flight</b> tube to the detector in the same time.|$|R
50|$|The Yantar program {{produced}} two memorable launch accidents. The {{first of these}} was on May 15, 1996 when an attempted launch of a 1KFT (Kometa) at Baikonur's LC-31 failed 50 seconds after liftoff when the payload fairing disintegrated. The satellite was destroyed by aerodynamic forces, but the booster continued to fly until T+126 seconds when it began to <b>drift</b> off its <b>flight</b> path, leading to an automatic shutdown command. On June 20, a few weeks later, a 4K1 (Oktan) launched from Plesetsk's LC-16 and met nearly the same fate when again the payload fairing disintegrated 50 seconds after launch. This time the onboard destruct system on the satellite activated and destroyed it, after which ground controllers sent a manual shutdown command to the booster, which crashed 4 miles (6 kilometers) from the pad. The back-to-back failures were traced to a manufacturing defect in the payload shrouds, which were produced in a batch, and they left Russia's ability to perform military reconnaissance severely hampered. In both cases, the shrouds broke up {{at the point of}} maximum aerodynamic pressure during ascent.|$|R
40|$|Invertebrate {{colonisation}} pathways {{were investigated}} {{in relation to}} a changing flow regime and seasonality in a stream with an intermittently flowing lower course at Cass, inland Canterbury. Benthic, drift, hyporheic and non-aquatic adult invertebrate faunas were sampled over a 12 month period, from November 1996 to November 1997. During this period, the stream channel in the lower, grassland reach dried up for three months, from late January to late April, and recolonisation of this reach was assessed following flow resumption. Colonisation pathways operating in both forest and grassland sections of the permanently flowing upper reach were also assessed. At the perennially flowing forested and grassland sites, invertebrate drift, oviposition by flying adult insects, and vertical migration from the hyporheos all contributed to colonisation of the benthos. Assemblages of invertebrates using the three pathways and the two riparian biotopes (forest and grassland) differed to varying degrees, with <b>drift</b> and <b>flight</b> activity of potential colonists being greatest during summer. Invertebrate drift from the perennially flowing upper reaches and oviposition by flying adults appeared to be the main sources of colonists of the intermittent grassland reach when flow resumed in autumn following a three month dry period. The hyporheic zone was of limited importance as a refuge when the channel dried up, since subsurface water disappeared rapidly following the loss of surface flow. Recolonisation of the benthos was gradual, as both drift and ovipositing adults contributed relatively low numbers of colonists in late autumn and winter. Local conditions, particularly substratum type (which affects hyporheic drainage) and proximity to permanent water bodies (sources of colonists), were important determinants of the colonisation pathways used by invertebrates following flow resumption in the intermittent reach. It will be important to take such local factors into consideration when making predictions about recolonisation pathways operating in other New Zealand streams and rivers...|$|R
40|$|Uncertainty in {{air traffic}} arrival demand creates {{difficulties}} for the Air Traffic Control (ATC) specialists in effectively planning Ground Delay Programs(GDPs). An inefficiently planned GDP leads to excessive flight delays and under-utilization of the GDP airport. GDP optimization models that exist today may not generate the best strategies for planning GDPs as they consider demand as deterministic, when in reality, {{it is highly}} stochastic. In this thesis, we identify Flight Cancellations, Pop-up Flight Arrivals, and <b>Flight</b> <b>Drift</b> as the common sources of demand uncertainties. Two models [...] an optimization model and a simulation model [...] that generate effective planningstrategies for a stochastic demand and deterministic capacity scenario, are developed. These models incorporate uncertainty in demand by associating probabilities to the stochastic demand elements during GDPs. The results from both the models suggest that setting Planned Airport Arrival Rates (PAARs) [...] the number of flights that are ordered to arrive in a time period at a GDP airport [...] that exhibit taircasepattern can effectively mitigate the detrimental effects of demand uncertainties during GDPs.

40|$|Water {{velocity}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} important abiotic factors influencing the survival of aquatic insects in rivers and streams. The unidirectional water flow shaping their habitat and characteristically dividing it into alternating zones of high and low water velocity (riffles and pools) also imposes on them the special necessity to adapt to continual downstream drift. Here, we analyze an individual-based eco-evolutionary model parameterized with field data, and show how species adapted to riffles and pools, respectively, emerge if three basic processes are considered: density-dependent local competition, <b>drifting,</b> and adult <b>flight.</b> We also find that evolutionary branching in velocity adaptation is accompanied by an differentiation of drifting behavior. Generally, individuals drift either frequently and for only a short duration, or infrequently and for a longer duration. While riffle and ool species each exhibit both drifting strategies, a third species that can stably establish at intermediate water velocities (runs) exhibit exclusively the former. As the run species is therefore particularly susceptible to drift loss, long-range adult flight turns out to be crucial for its persistence. These insights highlight the ability of process-based eco-evolutionary models to generate testable hypotheses and stimulate empirical research...|$|R
40|$|This chapter synthesizes {{data from}} 41 studies on 32 species of stream insects {{in an attempt}} to answer three questions: First, what is the major {{dispersal}} mechanism in aquatic insects, i. e. stream <b>drift</b> or adult <b>flight?</b> If it is stream drift, then genetic variation would be expected to fit the Stream Hierarchy Model of Meffe and Vrijenhoek (1988). If it is adult flight, populations would be expected to be panmictic at small scales, i. e. among populations in neighbouring catchments. Most stream insects with an adult flight stage do not fit the Stream Hierarchy Model, suggesting that adult flight is the major mechanism of dispersal. Second, at what scale are populations of stream insects structured? Across all studies, there was a signifi cant positive relationship between FST and geographic distance for studies using mitochondrial DNA. The isolation-by-distance relationship for allozyme studies was significant only when studies with high numbers of Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) deviations were excluded. Third, what can recent analysis of DNA sequence data contribute to our understanding of historical processes affecting stream insects? Several recent phylogeographic studies using mitochondrial DNA sequence data provide evidence of population and range expansions and contractions, along with past fragmentation, all estimated to have occurred during the Pleistocene.

50|$|The crashed {{happened}} on the Nukus-Mineralnye Vody part of the route. At {{the time of the}} accident the weather conditions at Mineralnye Vody Airport were reported to be low-level clouds and fog less than 100 meters above the ground, ice was present on the ground, and visibility ranged between 1020-1180 meters. The aircraft approached the airport at a bearing of 117°. While preparing for landing crew completely released the flaps and lowered the speed of the aircraft from 290 to 260 km/h; during the approach the crew was distracted monitoring instruments and searching for landmarks, resulting in their failure to notice the <b>flight</b> <b>drifting</b> slightly off course. At 1.5 kilometers from the airport, the pilots realized the deviation, set the bearing to 127°, but the pilot in command realized the landing was impossible and proceeded to go-around for a second approach. The flight, while attempting to disengage the first approach, did not climb 300 meters in a straight line, but instead turned right at 80-90 meters above the ground, losing altitude; placing it in a 4-5° roll. The speed of the aircraft reached 270 km/h, and then at an altitude of 120-130 meters the crew adjusted the flaps too quickly at the same time. The pilot in command pulled the nose up until the aircraft was pitched 11°, which led to an overload of 1.64 gs. The excessive g force damaged the ailerons, rudder, and other control surfaces. The aircraft continued turning to the right despite the crews attempts to adjust the ailerons. In just eight seconds the flight rolled from a bearing of 165° to 205°. The aircraft entered a right bank of 10-30° Il-18 flew at a bearing 102° towards the airport, to which the pilots attempted to correct; The pilots tried to gain altitude, but at 23:17:44, flying at a speed of 285 km/h at a bearing of 216° and with a left bank of 5-8°, the aircraft hit the ground, damaging a railroad.|$|R
40|$|ATIC (Advanced Thin Ionization Calorimeter) is {{a balloon}} borne {{experiment}} {{designed to measure}} the cosmic ray composition for elements from hydrogen to iron and their energy spectra from approx. 50 GeV to near 100 TeV. It consists of a Si-matrix detector to determine the charge of a CRT particle, a scintillator hodoscope for tracking, carbon interaction targets and a fully active BGO calorimeter. ATIC had its first flight from McMurdo, Antarctica from 28 / 12 / 2000 to 13 / 01 / 2001. The ATIC flight collected approximately 25 million events. The silicon matrix of the ATIC spectrometer is designed to resolve individual elements from proton to iron. To provide this resolution careful calibration of each pixel of the silicon matrix is required. Firstly, for each electronic channel of the matrix the pedestal value was subtracted taking into account its <b>drift</b> during the <b>flight.</b> The muon calibration made before the flight was used then to convert electric signals (in ADC channel number) to energy deposits in each pixel. However, the preflight muon calibration was not accurate enough for the purpose, {{because of lack of}} statistics in each pixel. To improve charge resolution the correction was done for the position of Helium peak in each pixel during the flight. The other way to set electric signals in electronics channels of the Si-matrix to one scale was correction for electric channel gains accurately measured in laboratory. In these measurements it was found that small different nonlinearities for different channels are present in the region of charge Z > 20. The correction for these non-linearities was not done yet. In linear approximation the method provides practically the same resolution as muon calibration plus He-peak correction. For searching a pixel with the signal of primary particle an indication from the cascade in the calorimeter was used. For this purpose a trajectory was reconstructed using weight centers of energy deposits in BGO layers. The point of intersection of this trajectory with Si-matrix and its RMS was determined. The pixel with maximal signal in 3 sigma region was taken as sought. The signal in this pixel was corrected by trajectory zenith angle. The preliminary results on charge resolution of the Si-matrix in the range from protons to iron are presented...|$|R
40|$|International audienceLOAC (Light Optical Aerosol Counter) {{is a small}} optical {{particle}} counter/sizer of ∼ 250 grams {{that can}} fly under all kinds of balloons. The measurements are conducted at two scattering angles: the first one, at 12 •, is {{used to determine the}} aerosol particle concentrations in 19 size classes within a diameter range of ∼ 0. 2 - 100 micrometers. The second angle is at 60 •, is used to discriminate between the different types of particles dominating the different size classes. The sensor particularly discriminates wet or liquid particles, mineral dust and carbon particles. 30 flights of LOAC have been conducted during the ChAMEx campaign (Chemistry Aerosol Mediterranean Experiment) on summer 2013, from Minorca Island (Spain) and Ile du Levant (south of France) : 19 flights under meteorological balloons and 12 flights under low altitude drifting balloons. Most of the flights were also coupled with ozone concentration measurements. LOAC balloons were especially, but not only, dedicated to study the various Saharan dust events that occurred during the campaign. In particular, flights were conducted every 12 hours during the 15 - 19 June dust event. Turbid air masses from North America were also sampled in late June over Minorca. The flights allow us to determine the vertical extent of the dust plume and various aerosol layers, and to follow the particle size distribution and the concentration evolution along the vertical. The low altitude drifting balloons, which stayed at constant altitude (between 0. 4 and 3 km) for several hours, allow us to study the time-evolution of the aerosol concentrations in the same air mass. Under both balloon types, LOAC has detected larges particles up to ∼ 30 micrometers in diameter. The <b>flights</b> <b>drifting</b> within dust layers indicate that there is a relatively stable particle size distribution during transport over the sea, with no clear sedimentation loss of large particles. LOAC is used to tentatively identify the various kinds of particles (marine salt close to the sea, pure sand or more heterogeneous layers). Continuous surface measurements have also been conducted on Minorca Island with a LOAC. The LOAC number concentration measurements are converted to mass concentrations, in order to evaluate the effect of the mid-June dust event on the ambient air quality. Coincident ground-based remote sensing (lidar, sun-photometer) and in situ measurements (aethalometer, TEOM [...] .) performed on Minorca Island and occasionally close airborne data are also used for comparison with balloon data...|$|R
40|$|Numerous streams on the West Coast drain {{catchments}} {{impacted by}} active or abandoned coal mining areas. Acid mine drainage (AMD) from coal mining can have significant {{negative effects on}} stream communities. Changing environmental ethics and regulations mean that mining companies are now encouraged to treat acid mine drainage to enable streams communities to recover. However, remediation efforts {{have not always been}} ecologically successful, and mining companies are seeking methods to enhance macroinvertebrate community recovery. Initially, I conducted an extensive survey of 45 streams draining the Stockton Plateau, which is the site of the largest opencast coal mine in New Zealand. I assessed physical and chemical conditions at each site as well as sampling benthic communities. This spatial survey showed streams impacted by acid mine drainage were comprised of chironomids and AMD-tolerant caddisflies such as Psilochorema and stoneflies such as Spaniocercoides. Un-impacted streams typically had a pH of ~ 5 and were dominated by mayflies (Deleatidium or Zephlebia). Analysis revealed that stream location within the landscape also had a significant influence on macroinvertebrate community composition. Another aspect of stream recovery is the ability of species to recolonise a stream. Therefore, I investigated the flight direction of adult aquatic insects in order to determine longitudinal and lateral flight preferences. No significant differences in flight direction were observed. I also investigated the influence of riparian habitat on lateral dispersal and found that a number of patterns were evident. Scrub vegetation supported higher densities of adult aquatic insects dispersing further from the stream, in contrast to the rapid decline in open bedrock and forest. Furthermore, a comparison between downstream <b>drift</b> and aerial <b>flight</b> showed significantly more individuals where drifting downstream, and this method is liable to provide rapid recolonisation of macroinvertebrates within connected stream networks. At the local scale, organic matter (comprising leaves bags and timber) and artificial moss cover were added to six streams to determine if organic matter and habitat availability would improve macroinvertebrate communities in manipulated streams. A series of floods during the experiment reduced taxonomic richness and density in manipulated streams. Overall, this study has shown that after AMD has been treated, the geographic position of streams within the landscape and lateral dispersal barriers may prevent streams being rapidly re-colonised. Therefore, to promote rapid re-colonisation of macroinvertebrates, stream remediation projects should be targeted at streams that either have un-impacted headwaters or tributaries. This will allow macroinvertebrates to drift in and re-colonise faster. In my experiment I did not find that organic matter significantly enhanced the macroinvertebrate community, but moss additions did provide additional habitat for macroinvertebrates. These results highlight the importance that disturbance events can have on remediation projects...|$|R
