40|$|Abstract: In {{this paper}} an {{obstacle}} identification system {{was set up}} and an artificial neural network (ANN) was established to identify obstacles in forest based on multi-sensor fusion, aiming to improve the efficiency of automated operations of <b>forestry</b> <b>harvester</b> in the complicated environment of forest areas. Firstly, a 2 D laser scanner and an infrared thermal imager were used to collect the information of obstacles in forest areas. Based on the collected infrared photo, visible pictures and laser scan data, image fusion and data association were conducted to obtain features of obstacles. Second, a BP neural network was established for forest obstacles identification by training samples. Then, to improve the performance of BP model, several common used functions were adopted to construct BP model by permutations and combinations. The test {{results showed that the}} model with trainlm training function had a best performance in forest obstacles identification. Finally, three best models were selected to be evaluated by testing all samples and the results illustrated that the three selected BP neural network models can identify trees, people, stones at a high correct rate of 93. 3 % or more.

40|$|The use of {{rapeseed}} oil in mobile hydraulic systems {{has become more}} widespread over recent years. This is because of concern about {{the environment in which}} the systems work and the perceived benefit of using such fluids. This article examines the major segments of the life cycle of mineral and {{rapeseed oil}} as used in mobile hydraulic systems, with case studies of a <b>forestry</b> <b>harvester</b> and a road sweeper. It shows that the systems running on rapeseed oil are not necessarily better for the environment. Many of the environmental issues examined in the study were affected more negatively by the use of rapeseed oil than mineral oil. The main exception to this was greenhouse gas emissions, which are consistently higher for systems using mineral oil because of the use of fossil resources. This study examines the production of the machinery, the oils, and their use throughout the machines' lives. The poor environmental performance of the rapeseed oil is due mainly to its poor performance in the field. This is because it does not respond as well to high pressure and temperature as mineral oil, causing it to need more frequent replacement during use. This, in turn, influences the definition of the functional unit used in the life-cycle assessment that was conducted. Also, the rapeseed oil has more corrosive qualities than the mineral oil, and more hydraulic components need replacing during the life of a machine running on rapeseed oil than one running on mineral oil...|$|E
40|$|Excavators are {{commonly}} used in forest harvesting in Brazil as an option to typical <b>forestry</b> <b>harvesters,</b> mainly because of their lower cost and also because some models are being manufactured locally, which means more units sold, facilitating dealer’s support and purchase of parts. Problems with excavators are related to high cost of tracks maintenance and difficulties to operate on steep ground terrain, when compared with wheeled harvesters. This study compared excavators, used as <b>forestry</b> <b>harvesters,</b> with wheeled harvesters to fall Eucalyptus tree plantations located on flat terrain. The productivities of both machines were quite similar, but the higher cost per effective hour of wheeled harvesters, concerned the models utilized in this study, favored the use of excavators, as base machines, to fall trees in a clear-cut system on flat terrain...|$|R

50|$|Forestry {{mechanization}} {{was always}} in close connection to metal working {{and the development of}} mechanical tools to cut and transport timber to its destination. Rafting belongs to the earliest means of transport. Steel saws came up in the 15th century. The 19th century widely increased the availability of steel for whipsaws and introduced Forest railways and railways in general for transport and as forestry customer. Further human induced changes, however, came since World War II, respectively in line with the '1950s-syndrome'. The first portable chainsaw was invented in 1918 in Canada, but large impact of mechanization in forestry started after World War II. <b>Forestry</b> <b>harvesters</b> are among the most recent developments.

40|$|New Zealand’s {{forests are}} {{commonly}} planted on steep slopes and include large trees. The {{research in this}} thesis contributes to the long term objective of developing a teleoperated mechanised harvester capable of working on slopes of up to 45 ° steepness and with large trees. The final aim of the project {{is to create a}} <b>forestry</b> <b>harvester</b> that provides a comparable improvement to productivity of steep slope harvesting that has been experienced with mechanisation of flat land forestry harvesting in New Zealand. This thesis studies the feasibility and practicability of teleoperation and autonomous control of forestry harvesters, particularly the predominantly excavator-based forestry harvesting machinery in use in New Zealand. The studies were performed on a laboratory scale hydraulic system, but were not able to be tested in the field, but it is considered that the studies presented have made a significant contribution to retrofitting existing forestry harvesters as used in New Zealand. The forestry industry makes a significant contribution to New Zealand’s economy. A large amount of steep land was converted to plantation forestry in the 1980 s, and these forests are coming to harvesting age. Unfortunately, the forestry industry has high rates of deaths and serious injuries due to the hazardous nature of the work. While mechanised harvesting is used where possible to the improve safety and productivity, much forestry harvesting is carried out on steeply sloped land. Steep slope machinery is available in other countries but the large tree size in New Zealand precludes its use here. New Zealand-specific machines for steep slope harvesting are under development, but most steep slope harvesting is still performed by hand. The specific areas of research this thesis addresses are in teleoperation – autonomous control, visual feedback, haptic feedback, as well as the use of minimal modelling for system identification of the hydraulic machinery. Trinder Engineering have developed a steep slope harvester using a system of cable anchoring for safety. While this steep slope harvesting machine can perform its task well, the research on teleoperation is aimed at eliminating the hazard to the worker by removing the worker from the machine on the steep slope – “no worker on the slope, no hand on the chainsaw” – without sacrificing the worker’s productivity. Teleoperation of forestry machinery is a difficult problem, primarily due to the unstructured and uncontrolled environment in which forestry harvesting takes place. However, improving technology is easing the difficulties of implementation and is making teleoperation of forestry machines feasible with off-the-shelf computing and networking hardware. The research in this thesis is aimed at maximising the use performance of off-the-shelf computing hardware and software. The system identification uses minimal modelling to develop the dynamic equations of force and motion. Unlike data driven modelling, which fits the system to the data, minimal modelling is driven by a simplified dynamic model, with inaccuracies being modelled as disturbances. The advantage of minimal modelling is that it is physically derived, so {{it is easy to see}} how changes in the machine properties affects the behaviour. This has the potential to allow various types of machinery to be modelled in this way, in particular the minimal modelling was first used to model the dynamic behaviour of a Phantom Omni haptic feedback arm, before being tested on a laboratory scale hydraulic system. This research was used to demonstrate the transferability of minimal modelling between different types of mechanical systems. The emphasis on retrofitting existing machinery in the forestry industry flows through to a strong emphasis on using control systems suitable for retrofit during the research, including for system identification. The hydraulic test system has been used to test autonomous control, including autonomous obstacle avoidance. The objective is to make teleoperation easier, by removing the requirement of operators to operate all the hydraulic rams themselves. The state of the machine was sensed by measurement of ram lengths, which in combination with a model of the machine joints enabled accurate calculation of joint angles. In particular, the key novel contribution to the state of the art is in implementation of semi-autonomous teleoperation control using ROS (Robot Operating System), off-theshelf components and ‘Minimal Modelling’ based system identification. The use of these techniques show it is possible to retrofit autonomous controllers in a modular way, without having detailed design information about the machines or having to design heavily customised control systems. The research finds that autonomous control using ROS and minimal modelling based system identification techniques are useful for retrofitting excavator based forestry harvesters. In particular, the modularity of the ROS based system and the ability of the minimal modelling to be extended to non-linear systems using linear time variant models of damping to account for the effects of friction and actuator dead zone. The autonomous control tests on the laboratory hydraulic system were successful, showing it is possible to control a hydraulic machine using a ‘conventional’ electrically operated hydraulic retrofit to perform autonomous movements. This, along with the strong industrial nature of this research work, is a significant research step forward to development of safer harvesting machines in New Zealand...|$|E

40|$|In {{agriculture}} and forestry, robotics {{has made a}} substantial impact. Farmers are conscious of their need for automatic vehicle guidance to minimize damage to the growing zone of their soil. Automatic sensing, handling, and processing of produce are now commonplace, while there is substantial instrumentation and mechanization of livestock procedures. In <b>forestry,</b> legged <b>harvesters</b> have not yet seen great success in their application, but the automation of trimming and forwarding with simultaneous localization and mapping techniques will change the industry in the future. Some impressive developments in walking <b>forestry</b> <b>harvesters</b> are presented, including machines targeted towards the difficult terrain of the Scandinavian forests. More-conventional cut-to-length harvesters are also highly automated, while operations such as delimbing {{must be carried out}} at speed. Before complete autonomous harvesting becomes possible, some of the localization and mapping techniques that are described must come to fruition. The combination of machine vision with global positioning by satellite (GPS) allows a tractor to follow a row of crops, performing a headland turn {{at the end of the}} row. The history of a series of projects is outlined, leading to the present outcome that is in the process of being commercialized. Another project that is based on machine vision relates to the location of macadamia nuts. To select which trees should be propagated, it is necessary to attribute fallen nuts to the correct tree. Color sorting and grading of produce is not a matter of sensing alone, but involves a measure of produce handling that puts it at the fringe of robotics. Automated milking parlours have proved their worth. However success has eluded some other projects described here, such as automated sheep-shearing and an automated abattoir. Another project is presented that literally sorts the sheep from the goats, using a swinging gate to separate different species using machine vision so that feral species are excluded from watering holes in the dry Australian outback. Although robotics is making rapid inroads into these areas, they are still a fruitful source of application projects, some sufficiently demanding to require the development of new theoretical techniques. ...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Before {{performing}} {{any financial}} analysis costs must be calculated. These costs should allow {{the planning and}} control {{over the use of}} the machines as well as the comparison between different investments alternatives since this is easily calculated. Generally the operating costs of forest harvesting machines are estimated until the maximum of 25, 000 hours of work, and {{it is not possible to}} know whether the activity remains profitable thereafter or not. For this reason the objective of this study was to evaluate the costs from cutting activities and wood processing carried out by a <b>forestry</b> tractor <b>harvester</b> up to approximately 30, 000 hours of work. Ten forest machines composed of two models of harvester (John Deere, model 1270 D and 1470 D) were used. A spreadsheet provided by a forestry company located in the state of Minas Gerais, containing the necessary data to estimate the operating cost of the machines and subsequent achievement of the sensitivity analysis was used. The operating cost was obtained by the sum of the fixed and variable costs. For sensitivity analysis the variation ± 20 % of the most representative elements of the total cost of the machine was performed. The results for the operating cost of the harvester and forwarder was U. S. $ 190. 85 h- 1. Costs for repairs and maintenance, labor, fuel, and depreciation represented approximately 90 % of the total cost of the machine. Despite the fact that the age of the machine has a direct influence on its operating cost, the costs did not behave in a linear fashion over the years...|$|R
40|$|In {{this report}} both the present {{situation}} and estimates of emissions from large non-road mobile machinery were studied. The estimates over future emission amount from the non-road mobile machinery sector in Sweden were conducted for the year 2010 and 2020. Special focus has been taken {{to the development of}} technology for diesel engines and alternative fuels. Moreover, possible measures and means of control to reduce emissions in the future were discussed. The study comprises fuel consumption and emissions from non-road mobile machinery equipped with diesel engines with a rated engine power of 37 to 560 kW. Nonroad mobile machinery for example includes tractors, wheel loaders, excavators, articulate haulers, mobile cranes, combined <b>harvester,</b> <b>forestry</b> machines and trucks. The estimate of annual fuel consumption and emissions amounts were based on input data concerning occurring types of machinery, number of machines, average engine power, annual work hour, load factors, fuel consumption and emission factors. Furthermore, concern was taken to the age distribution of the entire assembly of machinery. Inventory data regarding types of machinery, number, age, engine power, and annual work hour has been obtained from the Swedish machinery testing institute’s machinery inspection operation, statistics of sale returns from trade organisations and the Swedish motor-vehicle register. The fuel consumption and emission factors used were based on the CORINAIR Emission Inventory Guidebook and European emissions regulations for non-road mobile machinery and adjusted for: • differences in quality and specification between the fuel stipulated for use during type approval and Swedish diesel of environmental class 1, • differences between the maximum value stipulated in the emission regulations and the recorded emission amounts during type approval, • differences in engine load between the test cycle employed during type approval and during real use of the machinery, and • deterioration in fuel consumption and emission formation with increasing age. In total, 290 000 non-road mobile machinery with a rated engine power of 37 to 560 kW were estimated to operate in Sweden year 2006, which was about 25 % more machinery compared with the last published study concerning number of non-road mobile machinery in Sweden (Flodström et al., 2004). The annual estimated fuel consumption and emission mounts from the non-road mobile machinery sector in Sweden for year 2006 is shown in table S 1. The estimated annual fuel consumption was about 5 % lower compared with previous studies despite the higher number of machinery included. For emissions the differences were even larger compared with the above-mentioned study. Emissions of NOx were halved while both emissions of CO and HC only amounted to approximately one-third of previously estimated amounts. The largest difference was obtained for emissions of particulate matter, a reduction with 75 %. The differences obtained could be attributed to improved input data with higher resolution, especially concerning annual work hour as function of machinery age and the adjustment of fuel consumption and emission factors. Possible changes in the assembly of machinery between the present and previous studies were assumed to only have minor importance. Several different estimates of future emission amounts were conducted. The first estimate was based on the introduction of the European emission regulation, which resulted in a reduction of emissions of NOx and PM with about 70 % compared with the present amounts. Corresponding reduction of NOx and PM to year 2010 were about 21 %. The development of technology for diesel engines is focused on the reduction of nitrogen oxides and particulate matter. According to the study, current technologies for reduction of NOx were EGR, NOx-traps, SCR and engine-out modifications. For particulate matter, engine-out and different types of particulate filters will be utilised in order to fulfil future emission regulations. Alternative fuels can be used {{in order to reduce the}} emissions from current diesel engines, the most promising and suitable fuels in the future would probably be GTL-fuels, synthetic diesel and different types of biodiesel. For dedicated engines, dimethylester (DME) could be an interesting alternative. Several different means of control for reduction of emissions from non-road mobile machinery exists. Within the agricultural and forestry sector different types of economical means of control were assumed to be the most cost-effective methods. For the industrial and construction sector regulations and economical and informative means of control were assumed to have similar effects...|$|R
40|$|In {{this report}} future annual {{emissions}} amounts of gaseous pollutants, particulate matter (PM 10) and {{noise from the}} non-road mobile machinery sector in Sweden were estimated. The estimates over future emissions amounts were conducted for each year from 2006 to 2020. Special focus has been taken {{to the impact of}} European and national legislations, the age distribution of different types and sizes of machinery and measures to reduce the annual emissions. Besides different measures to reduce emissions, corresponding costs were also estimated. The study comprises fuel consumption and emissions of CO 2, carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbons (HC), nitrogen oxides (NOx), particulate matter (PM), and noise from non-road mobile machinery equipped with diesel engines with a rated engine power of 37 to 560 kW. Non-road mobile machinery for example includes tractors, wheel loaders, excavators, articulate haulers, mobile cranes, combined <b>harvesters,</b> <b>forestry</b> machinery and trucks. The current report was a supplementary study to a report describing a methodology for estimating annual fuel consumption and emissions from the non-road mobile machinery sector in Sweden for year 2006. Inventory data of the year 2006 study was obtained from the Swedish machinery testing institute’s machinery inspection operation, statistics of sale returns from trade organisations and the Swedish motor-vehicle register. The number of machinery and annual fuel consumption and emissions amounts for year 2006 is presented in table S 1. Besides estimates of annual fuel consumption and emissions amounts, emissions of noise was also derived both at a national level and for a specific construction site. For the case study the results showed {{that it was possible to}} reduce the average noise level with more than 3 dB(A) compared with the base scenario just by choosing the machinery fulfilling the strictest noise limits, i. e. Stage II which was mandatory for most machinery from 2006. Other measures simulated included various types of retrofit of noise reduction packages. The specific cost for the different measures to reduce average noise emissions from the specific construction site varied from 4 000 up to more than 500 000 SEK dB- 1. For the estimate of future fuel consumption and emissions amounts various simulations were conducted, each with a different measure for reducing the annual amounts. Five main emission reduction measures or programs were studied: - Scrappage program - Alternative fuel program - Voluntary emission regulation program - Retrofit of aftertreatment program - Noise reduction program The impact on engine exhaust gas emissions and noise of the current European emission and noise regulations, Stage I to IV and Stage I to II for emissions and noise respectively were common for all simulations or programs. Besides the impact of European regulations, annual work was set to a fixed value for each type of machinery and year simulated, thus eliminating any potential changes of the state of the market. The result of the baseline scenario "Business as usual" (BAU), i. e. only taking account to the impact of European regulation, is presented in table S 2 for four different years Both fuel consumption and emissions of CO 2 remains fairly constant as an effect of the assumption that the annual work was set at a fixed value. However, emissions of especially NOx and PM showed a major reduction due to the tighter and tighter regulations. All programs simulated were able to reduce the emissions compared with the BAU scenario with exceptions for emissions of nitrogen oxides, which increased in some of the alternative fuel programs. Both the absolute reduction and cost varied significantly between and within the various programs. Reduction of NOx varied from an accumulated increase in emissions of 25 000 tonne to an accumulated reduction of 22 000 tonne for the studied period from 2006 to 2020. At the same time the accumulated cost for the programs varied from a few hundred million SEK to more than 60 000 million SEK. In table S 3, specific reduction cost for each pollutant in SEK kg- 1 for eight typical emission reduction programs are presented. The results showed that the most economically favourable alternative for reducing emissions from non-road mobile machinery was the voluntary emissions regulation program, i. e. early introduction of machinery fulfilling coming emission limits. Another important result was that the introduction of alternative fuels as a mean of emissions reduction was associated with rather high costs compared to the actual reduction in emissions. For emissions of nitrogen oxides the specific reduction cost varied from almost 100 SEK kg- 1 up to a few hundreds of SEK kg- 1 except for the alternative fuel programs, which resulted in a considerable higher cost...|$|R
