40|$|In tectonic maps of Variscan Europe, {{allochthonous}} {{pieces of}} Cadomian basement clearly stand {{out with their}} predominant metabasic to ultrabasic elements, the so-called exotic terranes with ophiolites. Most of these domains are observed in basements of the Central Iberian Allochthone, the South Armorican domain, the nappe structures of the French Massif Central, the Saxothuringian Zone and the Bohemian Massif. Similar relics can be recognized in many Alpine basement areas, and correlations with supposedly more autochthonous basements, such as the Ossa Morena Zone and the Central Iberian basement, can be envisaged. All of these relics are thought to represent the <b>interrupted</b> <b>trace</b> of a former continuous or discontinuous structure, characterized {{by the presence of}} ocean-derived proto-Rheic rock suites. These can be interpreted as pieces of former magmatic arcs of Ediacaran to Cambrian age accreted to the Gondwana margin, which later were scattered as allochthonous units during the Variscan plate-tectonic processes. The presence of similar rock suites of Ordovician age in the Alpine realm is explained by the accretion of exotic China-derived basements and their collision with the Gondwana margin during the opening of the Rheic Ocean...|$|E

The man is concerned about a woman and is trying to get into contact with Her. Just before he is able {{to get a hold of}} the woman, Black calls his contact and agrees to take some sort of action against Him that will leave Him unable to escape and not <b>interrupt</b> the <b>trace.</b>|$|R
30|$|Intel PT records all {{control flow}} {{transfer}} instructions by default, which fill the Trace Buffer with {{large quantities of}} uninteresting packets to DTrace like conditional branch taken-not-taken. The irrelevant packets increase the burden of packet decoding {{and the number of}} <b>interrupts</b> for the <b>Trace</b> Buffer filling events.|$|R
50|$|This {{instruction}} is sensitive {{because it allows}} access to the entire status register, which includes not only the condition codes but also the user/supervisor bit, <b>interrupt</b> level, and <b>trace</b> control. In most later family members, starting with the MC68010, the MOVE from SR instruction was made privileged, and a new MOVE from CCR instruction was provided to allow access to the condition code register only.|$|R
40|$|User {{programs}} may be long-running and have arbitrarily complex interactions with their environment, and thus reproducing bugs by repeated re-execution may be impractical or impossible. To facilitate the debugging process, {{we hope to}} produce a tool which allows the user to efficiently trace the execution of a given program, and then exactly replay any interval of the traced execution. In this paper we show how the technique of tracing unique-spanning reads can be further refined to efficiently trace system calls during program execution using a new state machine to detect and trace reads following system calls. We also discuss how <b>interrupts</b> can be <b>traced,</b> and how the trace information {{can be used to}} incrementally replay a program execution, including system calls executed by the program and interrupts which occurred during the original execution. 1 Introduction Debugging requires repeated executions of a given program. Programs may be long-running and have arbitrarily complex interact [...] ...|$|R
