As an essential prerequisite, the isolated DNA should be of adequate quality which is a common obstacle when dealing with woody species and their interfering secondary components/metabolites.

Purpose: To assess the reliability of a new balance protocol for use in elite academy football, due to the difficulty in testing large group sizes and the limited movements patterns with the current {{gold standard}} tests. Methods: 10 Participants completed a series of functional jumps, incorporating forward, lateral and vertical movement and landing strategies, with single leg landings. The participants’ jumps were videoed for retrospective analysis as well as scored in real time by two observers. The subjects balance abilities were graded based on pre-determined criteria derived from the current gold standards of balance testing. Both intra and inter-tester reliability of the functional balance protocol was assessed. Main Results: The results show the FBP has ‘excellent’ inter-rater reliability for both real-time analysis and retrospective video analysis, with correlation coefficients ranging from 0. 864 to 0. 950. Conclusions: The FBP has excellent intra and inter-rater reliability.

This has lead to intensive research efforts and high hopes for novel therapeutic and diagnostic measures. We aimed to develop methods suitable for high-throughput expression analysis from low cell counts and to discover small-molecules and key signalling pathways critical to regulatory T cell function. Methods: Solid-phase mRNA extraction, quantitative real-time PCR and flow cytometric methods were developed, optimized and applied using automated workstations to a screening assay for small-molecules able to modulate ex vivo human T cells. Results: A <b>functional</b> <b>protocol</b> for high-throughput capable gene expression analysis in low cell counts was produced.

Conclusions: Regulatory T cell modifiers can be identified using the methods described in this work, and the results presented here indicate that large scale screening of such compounds is feasible. Suitability of the discovered compounds for potential diagnostic or therapeutic purposes need to be assessed in further studies.

Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, {{as well as other}} microalgae, has been investigated with a view to producing biofuel. But current production costs are still too high and impede the commercial implementation of the biofuel from microalgae strategy. Genetic improvement of C. reinhardtii is, thus, an area of immense interest in the worldwide scientific community. During this work, we studied a mutant for the isocitrate lyase (ICL) enzyme. It is the key enzyme of the glyoxylate cycle, which allows Chlamydomonas to use acetate as a carbon source to grow and develop, especially when cultivated in the dark. Identification and characterization of effects of this mutation could, thus, be helpful to better understand the interplays between ICL and other metabolic pathways. This study of the icl mutant highlights modifications of several cellular functions such as respiration, amino acids biosynthesis and stress responses. The second part of this work was devoted to the determination of mitochondrial transcription start site(s) in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.

40|$|AbstractThe {{phenomenology}} {{of nuclear}} Ca 2 + dynamics has experienced important progress revealing {{the broad range}} of cellular processes that it regulates. Although several agonists can mobilize Ca 2 + from storage in the nuclear envelope (NE) to the intranuclear compartment (INC), the mechanisms of Ca 2 + signaling in the nucleus still remain uncertain. Here we report that the NE/INC complex can function as an inositol- 1, 4, 5 -trisphosphate (InsP 3) -controlled Ca 2 + oscillator. Thin optical sectioning combined with fluorescent labeling of Ca 2 + probes show in cultured airway epithelial ciliated cells that ATP can trigger periodic oscillations of Ca 2 + in the NE ([Ca 2 +]NE) and corresponding pulses of Ca 2 + release to the INC. Identical results were obtained in InsP 3 -stimulated isolated nuclei of these cells. Our data show that [Ca 2 +]NE oscillations and Ca 2 + release to the INC result from the interplay between the Ca 2 +/K+ ion-exchange properties of the intralumenal polyanionic matrix of the NE and two Ca 2 +-sensitive ion channels—an InsP 3 -receptor-Ca 2 + channel and an apamin-sensitive K+ channel. A similar Ca 2 + signaling system operating under the same <b>functional</b> <b>protocol</b> and molecular hardware controls Ca 2 + oscillations and release in/to the endoplasmic reticulum/cytosol and in/to the granule/cytosol complexes in airway and mast cells.

40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{comparison}} of eight density functional models for predicting the molecular structures, vibrational frequencies, infrared intensities, and Raman scattering activities of platinum(II) antitumor drugs, cisplatin and carboplatin, is reported. Methods examined include the pure density <b>functional</b> <b>protocols</b> (G 96 LYP, G 96 PW 91, modified mPWPW and original PW 91 PW 91), one-parameter hybrid approaches (mPW 1 PW and mPW 1 LYP), and three-parameter hybrid models (B 3 LYP and B 3 PW 91), {{as well as}} the HF and MP 2 levels of theory. Different effective core potentials (ECPs) and several basis sets are considered. The theoretical results are discussed and compared with the experimental data. It is remarkable that the mPW 1 PW protocol introduced by Adamo and Barone [J Chem Phys 1998, 108, 664], is clearly superior to all the remaining density functional methods (including B 3 LYP). The geometry and vibrational frequencies of cisplatin and carboplatin calculated with the mPW 1 PW method, and the ECP of Hay and Wadt (LanL 2 DZ basis set) are in better agreement with experiment than those obtained with the MP 2 method. The use of more elaborated ECP and the enlargements of basis sets do not significantly improve the results. A clear-cut assignments of the platinum-ligand vibrations in cisplatin and carboplatin are presented. It is concluded that mPW 1 PW is the new reliable method, which can be used in predicting molecular structures and vibrational spectra of large coordination compounds containing platinum(II). c © 2001 John Wiley &...|$|R
