5|$|After HIV has {{bound to}} the target cell, the HIV RNA and various enzymes, {{including}} reverse transcriptase, <b>integrase,</b> ribonuclease, and protease, are injected into the cell. During the microtubule-based transport to the nucleus, the viral single-strand RNA genome is transcribed into double-strand DNA, which is then integrated into a host chromosome.|$|E
5|$|Enzymes serve a {{wide variety}} of {{functions}} inside living organisms. They are indispensable for signal transduction and cell regulation, often via kinases and phosphatases. They also generate movement, with myosin hydrolyzing ATP to generate muscle contraction, and also transport cargo around the cell as part of the cytoskeleton. Other ATPases in the cell membrane are ion pumps involved in active transport. Enzymes are also involved in more exotic functions, such as luciferase generating light in fireflies. Viruses can also contain enzymes for infecting cells, such as the HIV <b>integrase</b> and reverse transcriptase, or for viral release from cells, like the influenza virus neuraminidase.|$|E
5|$|HIV is {{different}} in structure from other retroviruses. It is roughly spherical with a diameter of about 120nm, around 60times smaller than a red blood cell. It is composed of two copies of positive single-stranded RNA that codes for the virus's nine genes enclosed by a conical capsid composed of 2,000 copies of the viral protein p24. The single-stranded RNA is tightly bound to nucleocapsid proteins, p7, and enzymes needed {{for the development of}} the virion such as reverse transcriptase, proteases, ribonuclease and <b>integrase.</b> A matrix composed of the viral protein p17 surrounds the capsid ensuring the integrity of the virion particle.|$|E

Serine <b>integrases</b> such as that from ϕC 31 and its relatives have found an especially wide-range of applications within diverse micro-organisms right through to multi-cellular eukaryotes. Here we review the mechanisms of the two major families of <b>integrases,</b> the tyrosine and serine <b>integrases,</b> and the advantages and disadvantages of each type as they are applied in genome engineering and synthetic biology. In particular, we focus on the new areas of metabolic pathway construction and optimisation, bio-computing, heterologous expression and multiplexed assembly techniques. <b>Integrases</b> are versatile and efficient tools that can be used in conjunction with the various extant molecular biology tools to streamline the synthetic biology production line...|$|R

Both <b>integrases</b> utilize a novel four-stranded β-sheet DNA-binding motif, {{in contrast to the}} known proteins that bind their DNA targets by means of three-stranded β-sheets. Moreover, the β-sheets in IntHPI and IntHAI 7 are longer than those in other <b>integrases,</b> and the structured helical N terminus is positioned perpendicularly to the large C-terminal helix. These differences strongly support the proposal that the <b>integrases</b> of the genomic islands make up a distinct evolutionary branch of the site-specific recombinases that utilize a unique DNA-binding mechanism...|$|R
40|$|International audienceTyrosine (Y) -recombinases {{have evolved}} to deliver {{mechanistically}} different reactions {{on a variety of}} substrates, but these evolutionary transitions are poorly understood. Among them, integron <b>integrases</b> are hybrid systems recombining single-and double-stranded DNA partners. These reactions are asymmetric and need a replicative resolution pathway, an exception to the canonical second strand exchange model of Y-recombinases. Integron <b>integrases</b> possess a specific domain for this specialized pathway. Here we show that despite this, <b>integrases</b> are still capable of efficiently operating the ancestral second strand exchange in symmetrical reactions between double-stranded substrates. During these reactions, both strands are reactive and Holliday junction resolution can follow either pathway. A novel deep-sequencing approach allows mapping of the crossover point for the second strand exchange. The persistence of the ancestral activity in <b>integrases</b> illustrates their robustness and shows that innovation towards new recombination substrates and resolution pathways was a smooth evolutionary process...|$|R
5|$|HIV is {{a member}} of the genus Lentivirus, part of the family Retroviridae. Lentiviruses have many morphologies and {{biological}} properties in common. Many species are infected by lentiviruses, which are characteristically responsible for long-duration illnesses with a long incubation period. Lentiviruses are transmitted as single-stranded, positive-sense, enveloped RNA viruses. Upon entry into the target cell, the viral RNA genome is converted (reverse transcribed) into double-stranded DNA by a virally encoded reverse transcriptase that is transported along with the viral genome in the virus particle. The resulting viral DNA is then imported into the cell nucleus and integrated into the cellular DNA by a virally encoded <b>integrase</b> and host co-factors. Once integrated, the virus may become latent, allowing the virus and its host cell to avoid detection by the immune system. Alternatively, the virus may be transcribed, producing new RNA genomes and viral proteins that are packaged and released from the cell as new virus particles that begin the replication cycle anew.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} viral capsid enters the cell, an enzyme called reverse {{transcriptase}} liberates the single-stranded (+)RNA genome from the attached viral proteins and copies {{it into a}} complementary DNA (cDNA) molecule. The process of reverse transcription is extremely error-prone, and the resulting mutations may cause drug resistance or allow the virus to evade the body's immune system. The reverse transcriptase also has ribonuclease activity that degrades the viral RNA during the synthesis of cDNA, as well as DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity that creates a sense DNA from the antisense cDNA. Together, the cDNA and its complement form a double-stranded viral DNA that is then transported into the cell nucleus. The integration of the viral DNA into the host cell's genome is carried out by another viral enzyme called <b>integrase.</b>|$|E

40|$|In this study, {{we searched}} for {{integrative}} conjugative elements (ICEs) in chromosomes of 124 strains of Streptococci. These exhaustive analyses revealed 105 putative ICEs and 26 slightly decayed elements that were grouped in 7 distinct families. Comparison of the conjugation modules of ICEs belonging to each family allowed {{the identification of}} the conserved proteins. The phylogenetic analysis also revealed that exchanges or acquisition of conjugation and recombination modules are frequent. Integration of these streptococcal ICEs is catalyzed either by site-specific tyrosine <b>integrases,</b> low-specificity tyrosine <b>integrases,</b> site-specific single serine <b>integrases,</b> triplet of site-specific serine <b>integrases</b> or DDE transposases. Analysis of their integration sites led to the detection of 8 new target-genes for streptococcal ICE insertion that have not been identified previously (ftsK, guaA, lysS, mutT, rpmG, rpsI, traG and ybaB/EbfC).

25|$|Even at {{the highest}} doses that can be tolerated in patients, AZT is not potent enough to prevent all HIV {{replication}} and may only slow the replication of the virus and progression of the disease. Prolonged AZT treatment can lead to HIV developing resistance to AZT by mutation of its reverse transcriptase. To slow the development of resistance, physicians generally recommend that AZT be given in combination with another reverse transcriptase inhibitor and an antiretroviral from another group, such as a protease inhibitor, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, or <b>integrase</b> inhibitor; this type of therapy is known as HAART (Highly Active Anti Retroviral Therapy).|$|E
25|$|The single-strand RNA is {{tightly bound}} to p7 nucleocapsid proteins, late {{assembly}} protein p6, and enzymes {{essential to the}} development of the virion, such as reverse transcriptase and <b>integrase.</b> Lysine tRNA is the primer of the magnesium-dependent reverse transcriptase. The nucleocapsid associates with the genomic RNA (one molecule per hexamer) and protects the RNA from digestion by nucleases. Also enclosed within the virion particle are Vif, Vpr, Nef, and viral protease. A matrix composed of an association of the viral protein p17 surrounds the capsid, ensuring the integrity of the virion particle. This is in turn surrounded by an envelope of host-cell origin. The envelope is formed when the capsid buds from the host cell, taking some of the host-cell membrane with it. The envelope includes the glycoproteins gp120 and gp41, which are responsible for binding to and entering the host cell.|$|E

Although radC genes were thought to encode DNA repair proteins, this conclusion was based on mutation data that was later shown to affect a different gene.

25|$|Haseltine then {{helped design}} {{programs}} to transfer knowledge from academic laboratories to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies {{to develop new}} anti viral drugs. Early on pharmaceutical companies were reluctant to initiate new research programs on HIV/AIDS. Biotechnology companies lacked the necessary funds and expertise for such work. To address this issue, Haseltine suggested that NIAID create a special grant program to encourage pharmaceutical and biotech companies to work on HIV related problems. Under this program a relatively large amount of money was granted to academic scientists provided that their laboratory have a pharmaceutical or biotechnology partner capable of translating knew knowledge to new drugs. The majority of the funds of these grants went to the industry partner to encourage {{the development of new}} drug research activities. These co-operative drug development grants led directly to the discovery of the protease inhibitors that changed the course of HIV/AIDS treatment and later to drugs that effectively target the <b>integrase</b> and envelope proteins.|$|E
25|$|Lentiviruses are a {{subclass}} of Retroviruses. They {{are sometimes}} used as vectors for gene therapy {{thanks to their}} ability to integrate into the genome of non-dividing cells, which is the unique feature of Lentiviruses as other Retroviruses can infect only dividing cells. The viral genome in the form of RNA is reverse-transcribed when the virus enters the cell to produce DNA, which is then inserted into the genome at a random position (recent findings actually suggest that the insertion of viral DNA is not random but directed to specific active genes and related to genome organisation) by the viral <b>integrase</b> enzyme. The vector, now called a provirus, remains in the genome and is passed on to the progeny of the cell when it divides. The site of integration is unpredictable, which can pose a problem. The provirus can disturb the function of cellular genes and lead to activation of oncogenes promoting the development of cancer, which raises concerns for possible applications of lentiviruses in gene therapy. However, studies have shown that lentivirus vectors have a lower tendency to integrate in places that potentially cause cancer than gamma-retroviral vectors. More specifically, one study found that lentiviral vectors did not cause either an increase in tumor incidence or an earlier onset of tumors in a mouse strain with a much higher incidence of tumors. Moreover, clinical trials that utilized lentiviral vectors to deliver gene therapy for the treatment of HIV experienced no increase in mutagenic or oncologic events.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Integrase</b> inhibitors (also {{known as}} <b>integrase</b> nuclear strand {{transfer}} inhibitors or INSTIs) inhibit the viral enzyme <b>integrase,</b> {{which is responsible}} for integration of viral DNA into the DNA of the infected cell.

40|$|Background: The host protein LEDGF/p 75 is a chromatin-associated protein {{required}} for efficient integration of lentiviruses. LEDGF/p 75 interacts with <b>integrases</b> of lentiviruses through its C-terminal integrase-binding domain (IBD) and with host chromatin through its N-terminal domains. Lentiviruses normally show {{a preference for}} integration in the bodies of actively transcribed genes, a preference reduced in LEDGF/p 75 -depleted cells. LEDGF/p 75 is therefore thought {{to function as a}} molecular tether for integration. We set out to test this model, by asking whether a protein containing the LEDGF/p 75 IBD and an alternative DNA binding domain in place of LEDGF/p 75 ’s N-terminal chromatin-binding domains would rescue infection and retarget integration. Methods: We generated a fusion protein containing the heterochromatin-binding protein CBX 1 (HP 1 b) fused to the LEDGF/p 75 IBD. The construct was expressed in HeLa-P 4 cells stably knocked down for LEDGF/p 75. Cells were challenged with HIV and EIAV and infection assessed by Q-PCR, transgene expression and a viral breakthrough assay. Integration sites were then amplified, sequenced by 454 sequencing and analyzed for their proximity to genomic regions reported to be rich in CBX 1 and its ligand. Results: The CBX 1 fusion protein showed nuclear targeting and co-localization with HIV <b>integrases</b> in LEDGF/p 75 knockdown cells, and mediated rescue of HIV and EIAV integration, transgene expression and HIV replication. Analysis of the genomic distribution of EIAV integration sites in cells expressing the CBX 1 fusion showed successful retargeting of integration to chromatin regions bound by CBX 1 : heterochromatic, gene-poor regions of the genome, rich in CBX 1 and its ligand, histone 3 trimethylated at lysine 9. These regions were disfavored by integration sites from wild-type, LEDGF/p 75 knockdown or back-complemented cells. Conclusions: We were able to reverse of the normal integration site preferences exhibited by lentiviruses using a CBX 1 -LEDGF/p 75 fusion protein. This supports the role of LEDGF/p 75 as a tether for integration, whose interaction with <b>integrases</b> is both necessary to target integration to genes and sufficient to retarget integration to alternative regions. Moreover, these experiments open the possibility of using the interaction between LEDGF/p 75 and <b>integrases</b> to retarget integration of lentiviral gene therapy vectors away from genes, {{to reduce the risk of}} insertional activation of oncogenes. status: publishe...|$|R

2500|$|Haseltine and his {{laboratory}} quickly showed that damage {{to any of}} the viral genes that specify the virus capsid, polymerase, protease, ribonuclease, <b>integrase</b> and envelope genes killed the virus and therefore that proteins specified by each gene were good targets for anti-viral drugs.

The first HIV specific protease inhibitor Nelfinavir, was developed {{as a part of a}} three way collaboration between the Haseltine laboratory, Cambridge BioSciences, a company Haseltine and his colleagues created, and Agouron Pharmaceuticals. The combination of an HIV polymerase inhibitor such as AZT and an anti protease drug lead to the first long term survival of those infected with HIV. Haseltine proposed the use of combination chemotherapy, the use of multiple drugs targeted against different viral proteins would be the basis for effective therapy. Today those ideas have proven out; The pharmaceutical industry has developed more than forty drugs that inhibit the HIV polymerase, protease, <b>integrase,</b> and envelope proteins. Combinations of these drugs have transformed HIV infection from a near universally fatal disease to one that with proper management can usually be successfully treated for decades.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the case}} of HIV, reverse {{transcriptase}} is responsible for synthesizing a complementary DNA strand (cDNA) to the viral RNA genome. The enzyme ribonuclease H then digests the RNA strand, and reverse transcriptase synthesises a complementary strand of DNA to form a double helix DNA structure ("cDNA"). The cDNA is integrated into the host cell's genome by the enzyme <b>integrase,</b> which causes the host cell to generate viral proteins that reassemble into new viral particles. [...] In HIV, subsequent to this, the host cell undergoes programmed cell death, or apoptosis of T cells.
