Lucy accepts Gru's invitation for a date, and the pair <b>dive</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> ocean seconds before the rocket enters the volcano and violently explodes. After a comical 147 dates, Gru and Lucy get married, and Margo, Edith and Agnes finally have someone close to a mother.|$|E
5|$|Ramón Jiménez, Fernández's stepfather, {{defected}} from Cuba in 2005, {{settling in}} Tampa, Florida. Fernández attempted to defect unsuccessfully three times, with each failed defection attempt {{followed by a}} prison term. Fernández, along {{with his mother and}} sister, defected in 2007. On that successful attempt, José's mother fell overboard when the boat hit turbulent waters, and José had to <b>dive</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> water to save her life. They reached Mexico, and then moved to Tampa in 2008.|$|E
5|$|Maryland met Georgia in the 1948 Gator Bowl. The Terrapins scored {{first when}} Gambino broke a 35-yard {{run for a}} {{touchdown}} in the second quarter. On the first series of the second half, Georgia quarterback John Rauch led an 87-yard drive capped by a one-yard <b>dive</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> end zone. Maryland responded with an 80-yard drive for another score by Gambino. Georgia turned the ball over with a fumble on its own 40-yard line and Maryland capitalized with a 24-yard touchdown pass to Gambino. In the final quarter, Georgia came from behind with a one-yard touchdown rush by Joe Geri and a nine-yard touchdown pass to John Donaldson. Georgia missed the extra point and the final result was a 20–20 tie. Gambino recorded all three Maryland touchdowns and 165 rushing yards, which set a school bowl-game record that stood for 60 years until broken by Da'Rel Scott in the 2008 Humanitarian Bowl.|$|E

5|$|Mickal {{showed his}} {{versatility}} {{in the first}} game of the 1933 season against Rice, tossing a 40-yard pass on the first play from scrimmage to end Pete Burge and booting punts of 76 and 61 yards. In week four against Arkansas Mickal completed touchdown passes of 48 and 57 yards and ran for a 15-yard touchdown, as he was responsible for every score in the 20–0 win over the eventual Southwest Conference champion Razorbacks. He scored the only touchdown of LSU's final game of the season, against Tennessee, with a goal line <b>dive</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> end zone. He also kicked the extra point for the 7–0 victory, and completed the season having successfully made every extra point he attempted. The Tigers finished undefeated with three ties in their first season as members of the Southeastern Conference (SEC). After the season, Mickal was named to the United Press (UP) All-SEC second team as a halfback.|$|E
5|$|The fleet {{returned}} to waters off Okinawa on 4 May and renewed its {{attacks on the}} airfields on the Sakishima Islands. Vice-Admiral Bernard Rawlings, second {{in command of the}} BPF, and his staff had determined that bombardment of Japanese gun positions by the heavy guns of battleships and cruisers might be a more effective method of destroying them than aerial attack. They detached King George V and Howe, as well as five cruisers, that morning to bombard Nobara and Hiara airfields while fighters flew a protective CAP over them and spotted the fall of their shells. The loss of the most effective anti-aircraft ships was more important than anticipated and the Japanese were {{able to take advantage of}} the opportunity. The carrier had just launched two Corsairs for bombardment-spotting duties and the deck park of eleven Avengers was being moved forward to allow aircraft to land when an undetected Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighter attacked at 11:31. The Zero first strafed the flight deck before any of Formidables guns could open fire and then turned sharply to <b>dive</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> forward flight deck despite the ship's hard turn to starboard. The fighter released a bomb shortly before it would have impacted the deck and was destroyed by the bomb's blast, although the remnants of the Zero struck Formidable.|$|E
5|$|As Patching {{had slipped}} {{earlier in the}} meet, Kerry decided to rub a sticky red {{substance}} onto {{the soles of his}} feet. The Soviet hosts had installed a carpet following the incidents, resulting in Kerry leaving red footprints in the stadium. Kerry led off in a time faster than his effort in the individual event, but it was still two seconds slower than his personal best time of 57.87s, leaving Australia in fourth place {{at the end of the}} first leg. Evans then swam a personal best of 63.01s, drawing Australia almost level with the host nation at the halfway mark. Tonelli swam his leg in 54.94s, almost two seconds faster than he had done over the distance. Tonelli did so with an uneven arm technique due to the uneven strength in his arms. He began to lose ground in the last 50m and was a bodylength behind until a late surge brought him to within a metre by the end of his leg. Brooks then executed a powerful, well-timed dive and surfaced almost even with his Soviet counterpart. He had drawn level by the halfway mark and made a superior turn to take the lead. The Soviet freestyler pulled level at the 25m mark before Brooks again sprinted away to seal an Australian victory by 0.22s. Brooks had finished his leg in 49.86s as he had vowed to his teammates. The time of 3m 45.70s sealed Australia's first ever win in a medley relay at the Olympics, for men or women. The team then made a celebratory <b>dive</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> pool and were interviewed poolside. In 2000, Kerry and the other members of the quartet were each awarded the Australian Sports Medal for their victory in Moscow.|$|E

25|$|Another way to {{understand}} the Aeroscraft’s VTOL capability is to compare the Aeroscraft to a submarine. For example, when a submarine needs to <b>dive</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> water, it takes on water to make it heavier. When the submarine needs to surface, it releases that water to become lighter. Similarly, the Aeroscraft can control its weight by releasing and taking on air, controlling the heaviness or lightness of the vehicle.|$|E
25|$|Shrimp are {{widespread}} and abundant. There {{are thousands of}} species adapted {{to a wide range}} of habitats. They can be found feeding near the seafloor on most coasts and estuaries, as well as in rivers and lakes. To escape predators, some species flip off the seafloor and <b>dive</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> sediment. They usually live from one to seven years. Shrimp are often solitary, though they can form large schools during the spawning season.|$|E

25|$|After {{an initial}} period of confusion, the four {{travellers}} find {{they have been}} transported forward in time to just {{before the end of}} the universe. They are in Milliways, the Restaurant at the End of the Universe, which was built on the ruins of Magrathea. So, as Arthur says, they have travelled through time but not through space. Waiting for them is Marvin the depressed robot, whom they left on Magrathea 40 million years ago. He's now an attendant at the car park, and still depressed. Just before the universe ends, Zaphod and Ford get Marvin to help them steal a supercool all-black spaceship, which turns out to be the property of a very loud rock band called Disaster Area. The episode ends on the cliff-hanger as the black ship is about to start a <b>dive</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> sun of Kakrafoon.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of the Buran {{began in the early}} 1970s {{as a response to the}} U.S. Space Shuttle program. Soviet officials were concerned about a perceived military threat posed by the U.S. Space Shuttle. In their opinion, the Shuttle's 30-ton payload-to-orbit capacity and, more significantly, its 15-ton payload return capacity, were a clear indication that one of its main objectives would be to place massive experimental laser weapons into orbit that could destroy enemy missiles from a distance of several thousands of kilometers. Their reasoning was that such weapons could only be effectively tested in actual space conditions and that to cut their development time and save costs it would be necessary to regularly bring them back to Earth for modifications and fine-tuning. Soviet officials were also concerned that the U.S. Space Shuttle could make a sudden <b>dive</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> atmosphere to drop bombs on Moscow.|$|E
25|$|Two {{days after}} the {{conversion}} was completed, BAVG-1 was transferred to and commissioned in the Royal Navy {{as part of the}} Lend-Lease program. On 23 December 1941, three US Navy Grumman F4F Wildcats landed on Archer for trials to the launch accelerator. The accelerator misfired, causing the first aircraft to <b>dive</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> sea as sufficient airspeed had not been gained. The remaining two aircraft were successfully flown off. Archer put into the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard on 24 December 1941 for repairs to the accelerator, which had been damaged in the misfire. On 2 January 1942, Archer successfully completed her sea trials. On 9 January, she sailed down the Delaware River bound for Norfolk, Virginia where she was to load aircraft for ferrying to the United Kingdom. Her gyro compass failed near Goose Island and then her engines developed problems. After repairs were effected she arrived at Norfolk and on 12 January she embarked eleven Grumman Martlets.|$|E

25|$|On 13 January, a Bell Jet Ranger {{helicopter}} {{that had}} been waterbombing the fires in the forests west of Canberra crashed into Bendora Dam with one person, pilot Duncan Patrick, injured. The pilot was reloading waterbuckets from the dam {{at the time of}} the crash. ACT Chief Minister Jon Stanhope and ACT Chief Fire Control Officer Peter Lucas-Smith were reviewing the fires nearby during a routine bushfire surveillance flight in the Snowy Hydro SouthCare helicopter. The unconscious pilot had been pulled from the sinking wreckage by a SouthCare rescue helicopter medical crewman Euan McKenzie, but due to the weight of his clothes and lack of life vest, was unable to be dragged from the water. The pilot of the Southcare chopper cautiously positioned his aircraft to allow Stanhope, Lucas-Smith and a paramedic on board to <b>dive</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> dam and bring the injured pilot about 60 metres to shore for resuscitation by Lucas-Smith and McKenzie. The pilot had head injuries and underwent emergency surgery at Canberra Hospital.|$|E
25|$|The B-57A was not {{considered}} combat-ready by the USAF and the aircraft were used solely for testing and development. One of the aircraft {{was given to the}} National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) which fitted it with a new nose radome and used it to track hurricanes. The aircraft was placed into limited production. Particularly contentious were the cockpit arrangement and the lack of guns, the Canberra having been designed as a high-speed, high altitude bomber rather than for close air support. The definitive B-57B, which introduced numerous improvements, made its first flight on 18 June 1954. The aircraft initially suffered from the same engine malfunctions as the RB-57As and several were lost in high-speed low-level operations due to a faulty tailplane actuator which caused the aircraft to <b>dive</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> ground. The USAF came to consider the B-57B as being inadequate for the night intruder role and thus Martin put all aircraft through an extensive avionics upgrade in response. Regardless, by the end of 1957, the USAF tactical squadrons were being re-equipped with supersonic North American F-100 Super Sabres. The complete retirement was delayed, however, by the start of the Vietnam War.|$|E
25|$|The primary screwworm, C. hominivorax, is a {{parasitic}} species, whose larvae are {{renowned for}} eating and infesting {{the flesh of}} living organisms, primarily warm-blooded animals such as cattle and other livestock. Their larvae cause myiasis, or an infestation of maggots, in lesions or other wounds and injuries that the host animal may have. Fly strikes may occur due to such farming processes as branding, castrating, dehorning, and tailing of the host animals. These processes, along with barbed-wire cuts and flea bites, lead to myiasis in the host animal. Navels of newborns also can be the sites of infestation. C. hominivorax tends to reproduce only on the flesh of a living host. Unlike most other maggots, these maggots attack and consume healthy living tissue along with decaying tissue (hominivorax literally translates to “man-eating”). The larvae are responsible for their common name, the screwworm, because they possess small spines on each body segment that resemble a screw’s threads. After the larvae hatch, they <b>dive</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> wound and burrow deeper, perpendicular to the skin surface, eating into live flesh, again resembling a screw being driven into an object. The larvae then continue to feed on the wound fluids and the animal’s tissue.|$|E
