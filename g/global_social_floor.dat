This model, however, is not designed to be a broad-based guarantee of labour standards among trading partners because it is based on external complaints not the results of monitoring. While it is effective in providing procedural rights, a lower percentage of trading partners provide substantive standards, so this measure has had mixed success. Some hope that implementation in competitor developing countries along with support by complementary domestic policies would allow this model to overall, raise the <b>global</b> <b>social</b> <b>floor.</b>|$|E
40|$|Work in Progress. Please do not cite. Please do not disseminate. -International {{relations}} {{literature has}} frequently {{called attention to}} international policy networks and their influence on policy-making. Other literature has pointed to networks such as epistemic communities, knowledge networks, and advocacy coalitions within different fields and dimensions of global social policy. In this paper, we assess and compare the role {{of different kinds of}} networks in global social policy with a particular focus on their contributions to basic social needs. The paper is structured as follows: The first part reviews the varying composition, characteristics and functions of networks. Literature distinguishes for example networks that rely mainly on non-state actors, as advocacy-groups or epistemic communities and business but also transnational networks or trans-governmental networks of public officials. The following parts of the paper analyzes examples of policy networks in three different social policy fields related to meeting basic social needs, namely in social protection, health, and food policies.

All first edition chapters have been systematically revised and updated to reflect major developments in this fast-paced area of policy. It includes new material on the Millennium Development Goals, the <b>Social</b> Protection <b>Floor</b> and the 'greening' of <b>global</b> <b>social</b> policy. This second edition includes new chapters on global poverty and inequality, social protection, criminal justice and education.

It starts with some remarks on the role of <b>social</b> protection <b>floors</b> and human rights in a new <b>global</b> <b>social</b> contract. It then provides a framework as to how the rights?based approach can be operationalised – for four main human rights principles and using structural, process and output indicators. It applies this framework to the right to social security. The penultimate section shows that the adoption of national <b>social</b> protection <b>floors</b> would constitute a key ingredient to a human rights approach towards achieving the MDGs before and after 2015.

The authors explore two areas in which new mechanisms of global governance of health have emerged {{in the first decade}} of the 21 st century: firstly, international assistance to finance healthcare and the Global Fund to fight AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria; and secondly, the <b>Social</b> Protection <b>Floor</b> which aims to ensure basic social guarantees for all. They argue that human rights can help to combine and strengthen these mechanisms, serving as a guide for a true partnership between people across borders, rather than merely a set of norms imposed upon states.

40|$|Background As {{the human}} {{cost of the}} global {{economic}} crisis becomes apparent the ongoing discussions surrounding the post- 2015 global development framework continue at a frenzied pace. Given the scale and scope of increased globalization moving forward in a post-Millennium Development Goals era, to protect and realize health equity for all people, {{has never been more}} challenging or more important. The unprecedented nature of global interdependence underscores the importance of proposing policy solutions that advance realizing global responsibility for global health. Discussion This article argues for advancing global responsibility for global health through the creation of a Global Fund for Health. It suggests harnessing the power of the exceptional response to the combined epidemics of AIDS, TB and Malaria, embodied in the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, to realize an expanded, reconceptualized Global Fund for Health. However this proposal creates both an analytical quandary embedded in conceptual pluralism and a practical dilemma for the scope and raison d’etre of a new Global Fund for Health. To address these issues we offer a logical framework for moving from conceptual pluralism in the theories supporting global responsibility for health to practical agreement on policy to realize this end. We examine how the innovations flowing from this exceptional response can be coupled with recent ideas and concepts, for example a <b>global</b> <b>social</b> protection <b>floor,</b> a <b>Global</b> Health Constitution or a Framework Convention for Global Health, that share the global responsibility logic that underpins a Global Fund for Health. Conclusions The 2014 Lancet Commission on Global Governance for Health Report asks whether a single global health protection fund would be better for global health than the current patchwork of <b>global</b> and national <b>social</b> transfers. We concur with this suggestion and argue that there is much room for practical agreement on a Global Fund for Health that moves from the conceptual level into policies and practice that advance global health. The issues of shared responsibility and mutual accountability feature widely in the post- 2015 discussions and need to be addressed in a coherent manner. Our article argues why and how a Global Fund for Health effectuates this, thus advancing global responsibility for global health...|$|R
40|$|Tracing the Fragments of <b>Global</b> <b>Social</b> Policy. Whereas {{some authors}} argue that <b>global</b> <b>social</b> policy – defined as global redistributive policies, <b>global</b> <b>social</b> {{regulatory}} policies and elements of global provision and empowerment – does exist, other observers challenge this claim. These contradictory positions are {{the starting point}} of our article. In the first part, we investigate to what extent elements of <b>global</b> <b>social</b> policy can be found; we demonstrate that only fragments of <b>global</b> <b>social</b> policy exist, namely some norms of social justice and some weak global regulatory mechanisms. In the second part of our article, we identify reasons for the limited articulation of <b>global</b> <b>social</b> policy. We sketch social policy theories which have been developed for the national level and discuss their relevance for <b>global</b> <b>social</b> policy. In doing so, we highlight limited industrialization at the global level, the weakness of global trade unions and churches, the dominance of liberal international organizations, the veto power of powerful national governments and the weakness of (Scandinavian) welfare states in global politics as possible reasons for the rather fragmentary existence of <b>global</b> <b>social</b> policy...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, {{international}} non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have been contesting the neo-liberal economic order in international politics by campaigning for normative conditions {{to bring about}} what Richard Falk calls 2 ̆ 7 humane governance 2 ̆ 7. However, {{the degree to which}} NGOs have contributed to the formation of <b>global</b> <b>social</b> contracts remains controversial. While NGO activists and various scholars advocate the establishment of such contracts, empirical testing of this normative argument is underdeveloped. Drawing upon this lack of empirical support, critics dismiss the <b>global</b> <b>social</b> contract concept and question the roles played by NGOs in international politics. This article addresses the controversy through a review, refinement and application of <b>global</b> <b>social</b> contract theory and an empirical study of two prominent international NGO campaigns directed at the World Trade Organization (WTO), an institution that represents a 2 ̆ 7 hard test case 2 ̆ 7. It explores the ways in which NGOs and their networks are challenging the neo-liberal basis of WTO agreements and contributing to the emergence of <b>global</b> <b>social</b> contracts. The article concludes that in some circumstances, NGOs have the capacity to inject social justice into international economic contracts and there is some basis for optimism regarding the formation of <b>global</b> <b>social</b> contracts involving NGOs, nation-states and international organizations. <br /...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{discussion}} of some fundamental elements of <b>global</b> <b>social</b> policy concepts. The dimension of <b>global</b> <b>social</b> policy that is about the social policy models of global actors has been characterised by primarily referring to pension policy. Analysing global policy ideas of national health systems, this thesis tests to what extent these definitions and concepts of <b>global</b> <b>social</b> policy hold true when taking into account policy models other than for pension policy. The analysis focuses {{on a number of}} international (inter-governmental) organisations that appear as <b>global</b> <b>social</b> policy actors in the field of health systems, most notably the World Health Organisation (WHO), the World Bank, the International Labour Organisation (lLO) and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Based primarily on a detailed document analysis, the thesis is structured to study, and to compare, the organisations' mandates as global health actors, the models for health systems developed by these organisations, and their communication channels. The characterisations of the global policy models of health systems are then compared to those for pension systems and related to more general understandings of <b>global</b> <b>social</b> policy. The key arguments developed in this thesis are that (l) not all social policy fields are characterised by the same structures and processes; that (2) not all social policy fields are about competition and contestations, but for models of health systems, we find a significant degree of similarity between the models promulgated by international organisations; and that (3) <b>global</b> <b>social</b> policy analysis would benefit from more nuanced ways of understanding the nature of its actors, the specifics of its ideas and concepts, and the implications of different communication channels...|$|R
