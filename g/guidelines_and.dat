In addition to offering lower-fat menu item such as salads, the company has updated its nutrition guides to include dietary <b>guidelines</b> <b>and</b> other nutritional data. One of its reactions to the concerns over trans-fats was to initiate a program in January 2008 to phase out added trans-fat in its products, and to switch to pure vegetable oils that are free of hydrogenated fats. The program ended in early 2009 with a complete changeover to the new oils. Most, but not all, of the products contain no added trans-fats; some products, such as the beef used in the hamburgers, still contain naturally occurring trans-fats.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of {{research}} conducted after the fires, a new fire management plan for Yellowstone was implemented in 1992. The plan observed stricter guidelines for managing natural fires, increased the staffing levels of fire monitors and related occupations, and allocated greater funding for fire management. By 2004, further amendments to the wildland fire management plan were added. According to the 2004 plan, natural wildfires are allowed to burn, so long as parameters regarding fire size, weather, and potential danger are not exceeded. Those fires that do exceed the standards, {{as well as all}} human-caused fires, are to be suppressed. These changes are primarily updates of the 1972 fire management plan and continue to emphasize the role of fire in maintaining a natural ecosystem, but apply stricter <b>guidelines</b> <b>and</b> lower levels of tolerance.|$|E

Additionally, mineral extraction through mining and {{oil and natural gas}} exploration and recovery are also conducted, though in Sawtooth National Forest this has become less common due to a consensus to protect the natural surroundings.

The IIHF was created on May 15, 1908, under the name (in French) Ligue Internationale de Hockey sur Glace (LIHG).

The IIHF was composed entirely of European teams until 1920, when Canada and the United States joined.|$|E

People with AS may analyze and distill their observations of social interaction into rigid behavioral <b>guidelines,</b> <b>and</b> apply these rules in awkward ways, such as forced eye contact, resulting in a demeanor that appears rigid or socially naive. Childhood desire for companionship can become numbed through a history of failed social encounters.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Clinical {{guidelines}} {{have been}} used in the medical domain for some time now, primarily to reduce proneness to errors during the treatment of specific diseases. Recently, physicians have special software at their disposal, which supports them at decision-making based on computerized protocols <b>and</b> <b>guidelines.</b> Using such tools, physicians sometimes want to know the reason why the computer recommends a particular treatment method. To comprehend the suggestions, a connection between the original <b>guideline</b> <b>and</b> its computerized representation is needed. This paper introduces a tool that was designed to provide a solution for that, the so-called Guideline Markup Tool (GMT). This tool enables the protocol designer to create links between the original <b>guideline</b> <b>and</b> its formal representation. ...|$|R

5|$|The era of American film {{production}} {{from the early}} sound era to {{the enforcement of the}} Hays Code in 1934 is denoted as Pre-Code Hollywood. The era contained violence and crime in pictures which would not be seen again until decades later. Although the Hays office had specifically recommended removing profanity, the drug trade, and prostitution from pictures, it had never officially recommended against depictions of violence in any form in the 1920s. State censor boards, however, created their own <b>guidelines,</b> <b>and</b> New York in particular developed a list of violent material which had to be removed for a picture to be shown in the state. Two main types of crime films were released during the period: the gangster picture and the prison film.|$|E

5|$|Western Middle School in Russiaville faced {{enormous}} pressure from many parents and faculty to deny White {{from the campus}} after his diagnosis became widely known. In the school of 360 total students, 117 parents and 50 teachers signed a petition encouraging school leaders to ban Ryan from school. Due to the widespread fear and ignorance of AIDS, the principal and later the school board succumbed to this pressure and prohibited re-admittance. The White family filed a lawsuit seeking to overturn the decision. The Whites initially filed suit in the U.S. District Court in Indianapolis. The court, however, declined {{to hear the case}} until administrative appeals had been resolved. On November 25, an Indiana Department of Education officer ruled that the school must follow the Indiana Board of Health <b>guidelines</b> <b>and</b> that Ryan White must be allowed to attend school.|$|E

5|$|Air Force {{planners}} {{believed that}} Operation Commando Hunt VII (1 November 1971 to 29 March 1972) {{would be the}} most fruitful of the entire campaign. During this dry season phase, the U.S. averaged 182 attack fighters, 13 fixed-wing gunships, and 21 B-52 sorties per day. As a result of this all-out effort, U.S. intelligence analysts claimed 10,689 North Vietnamese trucks were destroyed and credited AC-130E Spectres alone with 7,335 of these kills. During the campaign, however, ominous signs appeared in the mountains of Laos. On 10 January 1972, a U.S. 0–1 observation aircraft, flying near the Mu Gia Pass, dodged the first surface-to-air missile(SAM) launched from Laotian soil. This event, and others like it, were compounded by the crossing into Laotian airspace of North Vietnamese MiG fighters. Both of these threats tended to force off B-52 and tactical air strikes. During the campaign, ten American aircraft were lost to SAMs (mostly SA-2 <b>Guideline)s</b> <b>and</b> another thirteen were lost to more conventional weapons.|$|E
5|$|Further {{indicative}} of the role cognitive flexibility plays in education is the argument that how students are taught greatly impacts the nature and formation of their cognitive structures, which in turn affect students’ ability to store and readily access information. A crucial aim of education is to help students learn as well as appropriately apply and adapt {{what they have learned}} to novel situations. This is reflected in the integration of cognitive flexibility into educational policy regarding academic <b>guidelines</b> <b>and</b> expectations. For example, as outlined in the , a standards-based education reform developed to increase high school graduation rates, educators are expected to present within the classroom “high level cognitive demands by asking students to demonstrate deep conceptual understanding through the application of content knowledge and skills to new situations.” This guideline within the Common Core Initiative is the essence of cognitive flexibility, and a teaching style focused on promoting it has been seen to foster understanding especially in disciplines where information is complex and nonlinear. A counterexample is evident in cases where such material is presented in an oversimplified manner and learners fail to transfer their knowledge to a new domain.|$|E
