In 1868 the <b>external</b> <b>flight</b> of stairs was removed from the west front and a new porch {{entrance}} was added to its ground floor. The entrance featured a Norman doorway that had been moved from elsewhere in the monastery; Greene believes that it probably formed the entrance from the west cloister walk into the nave of the church. An exact replica of this doorway was built and placed {{to the north of the}} Norman doorway, making a double entrance. The whole of the undercroft was radically restored, giving it a Gothic theme, adding stained glass windows and a medieval-style fireplace. The ground to the south of the house was levelled and formal gardens were established.|$|E

2500|$|The {{lighthouse}} is conical in form. It stands [...] high, {{constructed of}} prefabricated cast iron plates, and painted white, with splayed flanges at the base, {{much like the}} Sandy Cape Light. The tower is topped by a cantilevered iron gallery, with a simple iron balustrade. Inside the tower is a spiral iron staircase with cast iron steps, adjoined to the internal walls. Entrance to the lighthouse was originally via an <b>external</b> <b>flight</b> of stairs and a small landing leading to a door on the second floor. In 1935 and entrance was provided {{on the ground floor}} and the stairs were relocated within the tower. On top of the gallery is the original [...] diameter Chance Bros lantern. In the lantern room is a catwalk, supported by ornate iron brackets. The dome of the lantern is copper clad and painted red, and itself topped with a spherical knob and a weather vane.

In passing the tower he thought of what she had said about the sergeant's virtuous habit of {{entering}} the church unperceived at the beginning of service. Believing that the little gallery door alluded to was quite disused, he ascended the <b>external</b> <b>flight</b> of steps at the top of which it stood, and examined it. The pale lustre yet hanging in the north-western heaven was sufficient to show that a sprig of ivy had grown from the wall across the door to a length of more than a foot, delicately tying the panel to the stone jamb. It was a decisive proof that the door had not been opened at least since Troy came back to Weatherbury.|$|E
5000|$|Town Hall (Rathaus). The {{town hall}} from 1454 is an {{architectural}} curiosity {{because it has}} no internal stairs. The only access to the upper storeys is by an <b>external</b> <b>flight</b> of steps that also leads up to St. Martin's Church.|$|E

As the place name indicates, Shipley had a history as sheep grazing land, so wool was plentiful, and the River Aire was a ready source of water for powering water mills and cleaning processes. There was a fulling mill in Shipley by 1500 and two more by 1559. Another mill was built by the Dixon family {{on the banks of the}} Aire in 1635. New Mill on the far side of Hirst Wood was built in the 1740s and by the late 18th century between 9,000 and 10,000 pieces of broadcloth were being fulled annually at Shipley's mills. Much work was undertaken in workers' cottages which had 'loomshops' for spinning yarn. Home workshops were once a common site along the River Aire and often had <b>external</b> <b>flights</b> of steps. Examples can be seen in the cottages at Jane Hills along the canal in Saltaire.|$|R

As {{a result of the}} impact caused the name Oscar was retired, from the list of tropical cyclone names for the region. Ahead of a tropical cyclone alert for Fiji being issued during February 27, local radio bulletins made Fijians, aware that a tropical cyclone existed several days in advance. Gale, storm and hurricane warnings were subsequently issued for various parts of Fiji including Viti Levu, Kandavu and the Yasawa and Mamanutha island groups. Ahead of the system impacting the island nation, the Nadi International Airport was closed, with both internal and <b>external</b> <b>flights</b> cancelled. Schools around the nation were also closed with some being used as evacuation centres for the hundreds of Fijians who evacuated. During February 28, the system started to affect Fiji with strong winds and light rain, before the wind and rain gradually became stronger during March 1, with storm and hurricane force winds recorded over the island nation.|$|R

Unlike the earlier Lascaris towers, Xlendi Tower has an additional platform with a slope to its base on the seaward side. It has a flat roof, where guns were mounted. Initially it held two 6-pounder guns, which were later replaced by two 4-pounder guns. Entrance to the tower is via an <b>external</b> <b>flight</b> of stairs that connects to the only doorway, which is situated on the second floor. Originally, the tower was under the command of a Capomastro, assisted by a bombardier, and an Aggiutante, all of whom were paid by the Università. At night, three men manned the tower. Salt pans are located close to the tower.|$|E
5000|$|The cockpit {{has been}} {{described}} as being relatively noisy, but also often praised for the provision of excellent <b>external</b> visibility; <b>Flight</b> Magazine stated that [...] "It is almost like being in a four-place open cockpit plane". Typically, the Rallye would be furnished with dual flying controls, each being complete with their own control stick, upon which controls for the intercom would be often mounted. While fully-featured cockpit instrumentation was an available option to be installed upon the Rallye, the additional weight of this equipment would noticeably impact the aircraft's performance; thus,customers would have to weigh up the benefits of having superior flight performance or being able to make use of greater amount of cockpit features.|$|R

50|$|Target {{designation}} {{data can}} be introduced into the missile from the launch aircraft or ship or <b>external</b> sources. <b>Flight</b> mission data is inserted into the missile control system after input of target coordinates. An inertial system controls the missile in flight, stabilizes it at an assigned altitude and brings it to a target location area. At a certain target range, the homing head is switched on to search for, lock on and track the target. The inertial control system then turns the missile toward the target and changes its flight altitude to an extremely low one. At this altitude, the missile continues the process of homing by the data fed from the homing head and the inertial control system until a hit is obtained.|$|R

50|$|During the mid-18th century, Sir Richard Brooke was {{involved}} in a campaign to prevent the Bridgewater Canal from being built through his estate. The Bridgewater Canal Extension Act had been passed in 1762, and it made allowances for limited disturbance to the Norton estate. However Sir Richard did not see the necessity for the canal and opposed its passing though his estate. In 1773 the canal was opened from Manchester to Runcorn, except for 1 mi across the estate, which meant that goods had to be unloaded and carted around it. Eventually Sir Richard capitulated, and the canal was completed throughout its length by March 1776.By 1853 a service range had been added to the south wing of the house.

50|$|A set of {{concrete}} steps with bullnose edges, {{leading to a}} short verandah along the front wall of the building, form {{the entrance to the}} lower level. The verandah has square posts and a two-rail dowel balustrade. An <b>external</b> <b>flight</b> of stairs to the upper level joins the verandah at the far end. The entrance on this level is a low waisted four-panel timber French door, with a three-pane rectangular fanlight (two panes of clear glass and one painted) and flat arch. The door and windows on this level are surrounded by a false quoin effect created by brickwork proud of the main wall face. Timber elements appear to have been painted red. External walls are constructed in brick with quoins on each corner. The lower floor has double hung timber sash windows with horns and flat arch. Timbers used to support the balcony rest on corbels between the windows and are painted white. A white-painted awning, made from timber palings finished to form a decorative edge, hangs from the balcony and covers windows on two sides of the building. The rear wall of the ground floor is built into the slope behind. This level consists of 3 rooms, two smaller ones that open onto the main room that runs the length of one side of the building. The main room contained the cedar bank counter, which divided the room into two halves. There is no internal access from this level to the floor above. The original unpainted and un-rendered external brick and stonework is retained. Square blocks of stone have been used in part of the rear wall on the lower level and the verandah. One of the side walls on the lower level also uses blocks of stone and has been painted white.|$|E

40|$|Variations in the {{geometry}} of the <b>external</b> <b>flight</b> apparatus of birds are beneficial for different behaviors. Long-distance flight is less costly with more pointed wings and shorter tails; however these traits decrease maneuverability at low speeds. Selection has led to interspecific differences in these and other flight apparatuses in relation to migration distance. If these principles are general, how are the <b>external</b> <b>flight</b> apparatus within a partially migratory bird species shaped in which individuals either migrate or stay at their breeding grounds? We resolved this question by comparing the wing pointedness and tail length (relative to wing length) of migrant and resident European blackbirds (Turdus merula) breeding in the same population. We predicted that migrant blackbirds would have more pointed wings and shorter tails than residents. Contrary to our predictions, {{there were no differences}} between migrants and residents in either measure. Our results indicate that morphological differences between migrants and residents in this partially migratory population may be constrained...|$|E
