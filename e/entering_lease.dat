50|$|NC Addleson, for the {{respondent}}, argued that, on the affidavits, {{the undisputed}} facts were such as {{to justify a}} final interdict. It was not disputed that the respondent had the contractual rights of a lessee and that the appellant had entered the premises on five occasions {{in such a manner}} that the respondent's attorney had once to be called before he left. The appellant was claiming an unrestricted right of entry which is in breach of the respondent's right to commodus usus. Such a breach entitled the respondent to a final interdict, since a lessor who <b>enters</b> <b>leased</b> premises without permission is a trespasser. The absence of prejudice to the appellant was a factor which the court a quo correctly took into account. Alternatively, Addleson continued, there was no bona fide dispute which could not be resolved on affidavit.|$|R
