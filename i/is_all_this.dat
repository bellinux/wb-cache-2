25|$|That day was, I fear, {{the fatal}} term of local patriotism. On that day, I fear, {{there was an}} end of that narrow scheme of {{relations}} called our country, with all its pride, its prejudices, and its partial affects. All the little quiet rivulets, that watered an humble, a contracted, but not an unfruitful field, are to {{be lost in the}} waste expanse, and boundless, barren ocean of the homicide philanthropy of France. It is no longer an object of terrour, the aggrandizement of a new power, which teaches as a professor that philanthropy in their chair; whilst it propagates by arms, and establishes by conquest, the comprehensive system of universal fraternity. In what light <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> viewed in a great assembly? The party which takes the lead there has no longer any apprehensions, except those that arise from not being admitted to the closest and most confidential connexions with the metropolis of that fraternity. That reigning party no longer touches on its favourite subject, the display of those horrours, that must attend the existence of a power, with such dispositions and principles, seated in the heart of Europe.|$|E
500|$|Blaney {{considered}} the song to be [...] "riddled with contradictions. Its hymn-like setting sits uncomfortably alongside its author's plea {{for us to}} envision a world without religion." [...] Urish and Bielen described Lennon's [...] "dream world" [...] without a heaven or hell as a call to [...] "make the best world we can here and now, since this <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> is or will be". In their opinion, [...] "because we are asked merely to imagine—to play a 'what if' game, Lennon can escape the harshest criticisms". Former Beatle Ringo Starr defended the song's lyrics during a 1981 interview with Barbara Walters, stating: [...] " [...] said 'imagine', that's all. Just imagine it." ...|$|E
500|$|Stalin called {{everyone}} who didn't {{agree with him}} an [...] "enemy of the people." [...] He said {{that they wanted to}} restore the old order, and for this purpose, [...] "the enemies of the people" [...] had linked up with the forces of reaction internationally. As a result, several hundred thousand honest people perished. Everyone lived in fear in those days. Everyone expected that at any moment there would be {{a knock on the door}} in the middle of the night and that knock on the door would prove fatal... eople not to Stalin's liking were annihilated, honest party members, irreproachable people, loyal and hard workers for our cause who had gone through the school of revolutionary struggle under Lenin's leadership. This was utter and complete arbitrariness. And now <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> to be forgiven and forgotten? Never! ...|$|E

500|$|Diana uses Paul's son and stepson to {{help her}} plan along. Declan Napier (Erin Mullally) gives Diana inside info about Paul embezzling as he {{believes}} he is doing the right thing. Andrew Robinson (Jordan Smith) tries to bond with Diana by giving her company information and Diana discovers the extent of Paul's money problems and knows that she has enough details to ruin him. Paul realises that Diana knows the truth and offers to join forces with her to bring down Rosemary instead. Diana becomes friends with Paul's wife, Rebecca (Jane Hall), and she realises that she can [...] "shatter Paul's marriage" [...] as Rebecca does not suspect anything is wrong. Badler said [...] "There <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> history between Paul and Diana and now {{they seem to be}} dancing around each other. There's every chance they could catch fire again. Diana is so charming and when people meet her they think she is lovely – but she really is not. And that's what makes her even more of a superbitch." ...|$|E

2500|$|I {{spent the}} whole process in a wheelchair, so {{physically}} I was really frustrated. I think my vocal performance on it is pretty poor. It sounds tired and strained. The saving grace of the album was [...] "Candy Store Rock" [...] and [...] "Achilles Last Stand". The rhythm section on {{that it was so}} inspired ... I was furious with Page and [...] Peter Grant. I was just furious that I couldn't get back to the woman and the children that I loved. And I was thinking, <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> rock'n'roll worth anything at all? ...|$|E

2500|$|... "The CSR {{has got to}} be the {{performance}} bargain of the car world, despite any flaws when it comes to civility. As previously mentioned, the roof and flimsy side doors are useless. Luggage space is nearly nonexistent, and you better be OK with the fact that anything short of a Razor scooter will tower over you on the road. But what <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> harping about creature comforts? This is a Caterham Seven after all, the fastest to ever leave the factory and maybe the quickest accelerating car on the planet. That counts more than cupholders any day." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{ritual of}} the Order of the Owls stated [...] "We {{advocate}} no creed. We {{know there are}} so many gods, so many creeds, so many paths that wind and wind. We believe that the art of kindness <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> old world needs." [...] They elsewhere stated that their Order was [...] "a secret society of good fellows, who believe in love, laughter and the Kingdom of Heaven ON EARTH. [...] It does not believe in postponing ones enjoyments until after death" [...] Other Owls literature stated claimed they were [...] "the only great secret fraternity which does not claim in any manner to be a religious body." ...|$|E
2500|$|Following {{the success}} of [...] "Shōganai Yume Oibito", the group {{released}} their 40th single, [...] "Nanchatte Renai", on August 12. Because [...] "Nanchatte Renai" [...] was the group's 40th single, a commemorative edition was released along with the usual regular edition plus two limited editions. The commemorative edition has a different c/w track on it than the regular and limited editions. The group hadn't had two different c/ws since their 4th single, [...] "Memory Seishun no Hikari" [...] in 1999, which has two c/w tracks in one edition. The single came in at number two on the Oricon chart, only behind the new single of powerhouse Ayumi Hamasaki, Sunrise/Sunset (Love <b>Is</b> <b>All).</b> <b>This</b> single marked their best opening week since [...] "Iroppoi Jirettai" [...] in 2005.|$|E

2500|$|Hartford Courant {{music critic}} Roger Catlin {{has said that}} the album's appeal is limited to aficionados of [...] "early {{synthesizer}} experiments". Malcolm Cecil, who {{went on to become a}} leading synthesizer proponent as the co-creator of TONTO, recalls that when he first encountered a Moog 3P, his immediate thought was: [...] "Geez, this is the [...] that George Harrison made that record on. I'm looking at it, and I saw it has filters, envelope generator – what the hell <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> stuff?" [...] Tom Rowlands of the Chemical Brothers has cited Electronic Sound as an influence. In his introduction to the 2014 CD booklet, he recalls discovering a rare copy of the LP in a Tokyo record shop in the 1990s and says that the sleeve [...] "now hangs on the wall of my studio, just next to my own Moog modular, beaming inspiration straight to my brain".|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Portland Monthly on December 18, 2012, Franzen revealed that he currently had [...] "a four-page, single-spaced proposal" [...] for a fifth novel he was currently working on, although {{he went on to}} suggest that while he had a proposal there was no guarantee that what was proposed would make the final cut, saying of similar proposals for previous novels, [...] "I look at the old proposals now, and I see the one part of them that actually got made into a book, and I think, 'How come I couldn't see that? What <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> other stuff?'". Franzen also hinted that the new novel would probably also be long, adding [...] "I've let go of any illusion that I'm a writer of 150-page novels. I need room to let things turn around over time and see them from the whole lives of other characters, not just the single character. For better or worse, one point of view never seems to do it for me." [...] In October 2014, during a discussion at Colgate University, Franzen read a [...] "self-contained first-person narrative" [...] that is part of a novel that he hopes will be out in the summer of 2015.|$|E
2500|$|Some of Anderson's men {{managed to}} get across the creek and {{momentarily}} threaten Reynolds's position, however he was reinforced by Meade's brigade and two regiments from Morell's division. The three Confederate brigades were driven back with substantial casualties. Arriving {{on the field and}} realizing what was happening, Robert E. Lee hastily summoned Longstreet's and D.H. Hill's divisions. As Lee surveyed the futile attacks, Jefferson Davis and the Confederate cabinet rode up to him. Davis asked him [...] "General, what <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> army and what is it doing here?" [...] Lee replied sarcastically [...] "I don't know, Mr. President. It is not my army and this is no place for it." [...] William D. Pender's brigade then attacked the Union left flank at Ellerson's Mill, held by Seymour's brigade. Once again, the well-entrenched infantry and massed artillery proved too much for the Confederates and Pender was forced to retreat. Just then, Roswell Ripley's brigade of D.H. Hill's division arrived on the field and was ordered next to assault the Union left. Ripley charged head-on into the Union entrenchments and suffered the very worst of all with over 600 casualties, the largest percentage of them coming from the 44th Georgia, which lost 335 men and most of its officers (out of a total of 514), including its colonel Robert A. Smith, a roughly 65% casualty rate. The 1st North Carolina suffered 50% casualties (133 men killed, wounded, or captured) and also lost its commander, Col. Montford Stokes. General Ripley himself survived unscathed, but came within inches of being decapitated by an artillery shell. Ripley's other two regiments, the 3rd North Carolina and 48th Georgia, were {{to the rear of the}} 1st North Carolina and 44th Georgia; their losses were lighter. Union casualties around Ellerson's Mill were small, only 40 men total were killed or wounded in the 7th Pennsylvania Reserves and 12th Pennsylvania Reserves, which were defending this sector of the battlefield. The 13th Pennsylvania Reserves lost 75 men, the highest total number of any Union outfit. Some 20 years after the battle, D.H. Hill wrote [...] "The attacks on the Beaver Dam entrenchments, on the heights of Malvern Hill, at Gettysburg, were all grand, but of exactly the kind of grandeur the South could not afford." ...|$|E
