A brief overview of this method is as follows: a median spectrum is calculated from several sequential spectra; the median noise value is subtracted from this derived spectrum; the median spectrum is smoothed; the detection/nondetection decision is made by comparing the smoothed spectrum to the variance of the smoothed noise; and if a signal is detected, then the <b>half-power</b> <b>points</b> of the smoothed echo spectrum are used to place limits on the evaluation of the first two moments of the unsmoothed median spectrum.

An experimental tube was built and subjected to static and dynamic tests. The maximum errors in multiplication under static conditions were approximately two percent of the maximum product; the output voltage corresponding to the maximum product was three volts. Under the conditions of the dynamic tests, performance was limited by stray capacitance shunting the output cir-cuit; accordingly, with a sinusoidal output voltage the <b>half-power</b> <b>point</b> was at 70 kc/sec.

First considerable care was taken to construct a waveform simulator whose characteristics matched those of the instrument — specifically, this meant some tuning to get leading edge slope and position of <b>half-power</b> <b>point</b> in exact agreement with the RA- 2 altimeter. This simulator was used to generate waveforms as the virtual instrument overflies a small rectangular patch of enhanced variability (a "bright target") possibly representing glassy seas. From a number of such (noise-free) simulations spanning the narrow altimeter swath {{it was possible to}} use mathematical inversion techniques to produce a set of weights for estimating intensities of such hyperbolae, and then remove these features from the 2 -D waveform space. This is demonstrated in a number of worked examples (datasets provided for validation). A key aspect of the technique is that it can equally well be used to compensate for weak targets (rain cells or absence of ocean due to land); this is particularly effective in the transits of Pianosa. This technique is much better at coping with multiple discrete targets than an approach that treats each waveform in isolation thus neglecting the contextual information from neighbouring waveforms. The implementation with real RA- 2 altimeter data is still problematic, because there are movements in the tracker window, which can still be important at the sub-binwidth scale, yet are hard to correct for. A further challenge is estimating the intensity of hyperbolic features when not all of the feature is present in the waveform anomalies e. g. because of data over land generated using a different chirp bandwidth...|$|E

This result is of fundamental importance for understanding the emission process and requires extended studies over a wider frequency range. In this paper we have carried out a detailed study of the profile component widths of 123 normal pulsars observed in the Meterwavelength Single-pulse Polarimetric Emission Survey at 333 and 618 MHz. The components in the pulse profile were separated into core and conal classes. We found that at both frequencies the core {{as well as the}} conal component widths versus period had a LBL which followed the $P^{- 0. 5 }$ relation with a similar lower boundary. The radio emission in normal pulsars have been observationally shown to arise from a narrow range of heights around a few hundred kilometers above the stellar surface. In the past the $P^{- 0. 5 }$ relation has been considered as evidence for emission arising from last open dipolar magnetic field lines. We show that the $P^{- 0. 5 }$ dependence only holds if the trailing and leading half-power points of the component are associated with the last open field line. In such a scenario we do not find any physical motivation which can explain the $P^{- 0. 5 }$ dependence for both core and conal components as evidence for dipolar geometry in normal pulsars.

By design, the map also covers the region mapped in the infrared with the Spitzer Space Telescope. We detect 44 definite sources, and a few likely sources are also seen along a filament in the eastern streamer. The map indicates that dense cores in Ophiuchus are very clustered and often found in filaments within the cloud. Most sources are round, as measured at the <b>half-power</b> <b>point,</b> but elongated when measured at lower contour levels, suggesting spherical sources lying within filaments. The masses, for an assumed dust temperature of 10 K, range from 0. 24 to 3. 9 M☉, with a mean value of 0. 96 M☉. The total mass in distinct cores is 42 M☉, 0. 5 %- 2 % of the total cloud mass, and the total mass above 4 σ is about 80 M☉. The mean densities in the cores are quite high, with an average of 1. 6 × 106 cm- 3, suggesting short free-fall times. The core mass distribution can be fitted with a power law with slope α = 2. 1 ± 0. 3 for M > 0. 5 M☉, similar to that found in other regions, but slightly shallower than that of some determinations of the local IMF. In agreement with previous studies, our survey shows that dense cores account for a very small fraction of the cloud volume and total mass. They are nearly all confined to regions with AV ≥ 9 mag, a lower threshold than found previously...|$|E
