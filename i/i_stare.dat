She wondered how much had been absorbed and carried on through the generations to shift not only parenting, but spectatorship as well. In what is described as an [...] "oppositional gaze", hooks explains the sometimes overwhelming desire to look and thus stating that by looking, actually declares a defiantly, [...] "Not only will <b>I</b> <b>stare,</b> I want my look to change reality." [...] The cinema became a place of critical analysis and a place where black men could view narratives starring white women without the risk of being lynched or murdered for being perceived as a threat.|$|E

60|$|After {{a summer}} of good health of a very radiant order, {{toothache}} {{and the death of}} a very old friend, which came upon me like a thunderclap, have rather shelved my powers. <b>I</b> <b>stare</b> upon the paper, not write. I wish I could write like your Sculptors; yet I am well aware that I should not try in that direction. A certain warmth (tepid enough) and a certain dash of the picturesque are my poor essential qualities; and if I went fooling after the too classical, I might lose even these.

6000|$|As <b>I</b> <b>stare</b> at the Belfry, I {{think with}} a sort of smile of some of my friends in London who are quite sure of how {{children}} will turn out if you give them what they call [...] "the right environment." [...] It is a troublesome thing, environment, for it sometimes works positively and sometimes negatively, and more often between the two. A beautiful environment may make a child love beauty; it may make him bored with beauty; most likely the two effects will mix and neutralise each other. Most likely, that is, the environment will make hardly any difference at all. In the scientific style of history (which was recently fashionable, and is still conventional) we always had a list of countries that had owed their characteristics to their physical conditions.|$|E
60|$|He {{lifted a}} hand {{that was not}} too steady to his brow and scanned the road leading to the fort. Even as he spoke four figures emerged from the woods,--undoubtedly the gentlemen who had held the council at the inn that afternoon. We watched them in silence as they drew nearer, and then {{something}} in the walk and appearance of the foremost began to bother me. He wore a long, double-breasted, claret-colored redingote that fitted his slim figure to perfection, and his gait was the easy gait {{of a man who}} goes through the world careless of its pitfalls. So intently did <b>I</b> <b>stare</b> that I gave no thought to those who followed him. Suddenly, when he was within fifty paces, a cry escaped me,--I should have known that smiling, sallow, weakly handsome face anywhere in the world.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{look at the}} facts. See how {{the fellow}} got away every time, and you'll {{understand}} what I mean. Why was he able {{to stand in the}} place of the scarecrow, hidden by nothing but an old hat? Because it was a village policeman who knew the scarecrow was there, was expecting it, and therefore took no notice of it. Now I never expect a scarecrow. I've never seen one in the street, and <b>I</b> <b>stare</b> at one when I see it in the field. It's a new thing to me and worth noticing. And it was just the same when he hid in the well. You are ready to find a well in a place like that; you look for a well, and so you don't see it. I don't look for it, and therefore I do look at it." ...|$|E

60|$|George had a quick {{rejoinder}} to {{his letter}} of excuse to Haslam, {{so we had}} not his company yesterday, which I was sorry for as there was our old set. I know three witty people all distinct in their excellence--Rice, Reynolds, and Richards. Rice is the wisest, Reynolds the playfullest, Richards the out-o'-the-wayest. The first makes you laugh and think, the second makes you laugh and not think, the third puzzles your head. I admire the first, I enjoy the second, <b>I</b> <b>stare</b> at the third. The first is claret, the second ginger-beer, the third crÃªme de Byrapymdrag. The first is inspired by Minerva, the second by Mercury, the third by Harlequin Epigram, Esq. The first is neat in his dress, the second slovenly, the third uncomfortable. The first speaks adagio, the second allegretto, the third both together. The first is Swiftean, the second Tom-Crib-ean, the third Shandean. And yet these three eans are not three eans but one ean.|$|E
6000|$|Our {{family dinner}} must come off at Gad's Hill, where I have {{improvements}} to exhibit, and where I shall be truly {{pleased to see}} you and the doctor again. I have deferred answering your note, while I have been scheming and scheming for a day between this time and our departure. But it is all in vain. My engagements have accumulated, and become such a whirl, that no day is left me. Nothing is left me but to get away. I look forward to my release from this dining life with an inexpressible longing after quiet and my own pursuits. What with public speechifying, private eating and drinking, and perpetual simmering in hot rooms, I have made London too hot to hold me and my work together. Mary and Georgina acknowledge the condition of imbecility to which we have become reduced in reference to your kind reminder. They say, when <b>I</b> <b>stare</b> at them in a forlorn way with your note in my hand: [...] "What CAN you do!" [...] To which I can only reply, implicating them: [...] "See what you have brought me to!" ...|$|E
60|$|As I {{stand at}} the street corner, I don't see {{as many as four}} people at once going to church, though I see as many as four churches with their {{steeples}} clamouring for people. I choose my church, and go up the flight of steps to the great entrance in the tower. A mouldy tower within, and like a neglected washhouse. A rope comes through the beamed roof, and a man in the corner pulls it and clashes the bell--a whity-brown man, whose clothes were once black- -a man with flue on him, and cobweb. He stares at me, wondering how I come there, and <b>I</b> <b>stare</b> at him, wondering how he comes there. Through a screen of wood and glass, I peep into the dim church. About twenty people are discernible, waiting to begin. Christening would seem to have faded out of this church long ago, for the font has the dust of desuetude thick upon it, and its wooden cover (shaped like an old-fashioned tureen-cover) looks as if it wouldn't come off, upon requirement. I perceive the altar to be rickety and the Commandments damp. Entering after this survey, I jostle the clergyman in his canonicals, who is entering too from a dark lane behind a pew of state with curtains, where nobody sits. The pew is ornamented with four blue wands, once carried by four somebodys, I suppose, before somebody else, but which there is nobody now to hold or receive honour from. I open the door of a family pew, and shut myself in; if I could occupy twenty family pews at once I might have them. The clerk, a brisk young man (how does HE come here?), glances at me knowingly, as who should say, 'You have done it now; you must stop.' Organ plays. Organ-loft is in a small gallery across the church; gallery congregation, two girls. I wonder within myself what will happen when we are required to sing.|$|E

60|$|Here is our pew in the church. What a high-backed pew! With {{a window}} near it, {{out of which}} our house can be seen, and IS seen many times during the morning's service, by Peggotty, who likes to make herself as sure as she can that it's not being robbed, or is not in flames. But though Peggotty's eye wanders, she is much {{offended}} if mine does, and frowns to me, as I stand upon the seat, that I am {{to look at the}} clergyman. But I can't always look at him--I know him without that white thing on, and I am afraid of his wondering why <b>I</b> <b>stare</b> so, and perhaps stopping the service to inquire--and what am I to do? It's a dreadful thing to gape, but I must do something. I look at my mother, but she pretends not to see me. I look at a boy in the aisle, and he makes faces at me. I look at the sunlight coming in at the open door through the porch, and there I see a stray sheep--I don't mean a sinner, but mutton--half making up his mind to come into the church. I feel that if I looked at him any longer, I might be tempted to say something out loud; and what would become of me then! I look up at the monumental tablets on the wall, and try to think of Mr. Bodgers late of this parish, and what the feelings of Mrs. Bodgers must have been, when affliction sore, long time Mr. Bodgers bore, and physicians were in vain. I wonder whether they called in Mr. Chillip, and he was in vain; and if so, how he likes to be reminded of it once a week. I look from Mr. Chillip, in his Sunday neckcloth, to the pulpit; and think what a good place it would be to play in, and what a castle it would make, with another boy coming up the stairs to attack it, and having the velvet cushion with the tassels thrown down on his head. In time my eyes gradually shut up; and, from seeming to hear the clergyman singing a drowsy song in the heat, I hear nothing, until I fall off the seat with a crash, and am taken out, more dead than alive, by Peggotty.|$|E
