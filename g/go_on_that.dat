25|$|In 1930, Cliff was {{appointed}} Art Director to Newport Pottery and A. J. Wilkinson, the two adjoining factories that produced her wares. Her work involved {{spending more time}} with the Colley Shorter, and this gradually developed into an affair, conducted in secrecy. The couple worked closely together on creating awareness of 'Bizarre ware' to catch the attention of buyers {{in the middle of a}} major financial depression, and with a skilful eye and great foresight, Colley Shorter registered Clarice's name and even some of her shapes. It was her ability to design both patterns and also the shapes they were to <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> distinguished Cliff above any other designers in the Staffordshire Potteries at this time. Her first modelling in the mid 20s was of stylised figures, people, ducks, the floral embossed Davenport ware of 1925. But in 1929 at the same time as she started the colourful cubist and landscape designs, Cliff's modelling took on a new style. This was influenced by European originals by Désny, Tétard Freres, Josef Hoffmann and others, that she had seen in design journals including 'Mobilier e Décoration'.|$|E
500|$|Brendan Fraser as Richard [...] "Rick" [...] O'Connell [...] An American adventurer {{who served}} in the French Foreign Legion. Producer James Jacks offered the role of Rick O'Connell to Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon and Ben Affleck but the actors were not {{interested}} or could not fit the role into their respective schedules. Jacks and director Stephen Sommers were impressed with the money that George of the Jungle was making at the box office and cast Brendan Fraser as a result; Sommers also commented that he felt Fraser fit the Errol Flynn swashbuckling character he had envisioned perfectly. The actor understood that his character [...] "doesn't take himself too seriously, otherwise the audience can't <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> journey with him".|$|E
500|$|The album's lead single, [...] "Tango del Pecado", is {{addressed}} {{to the parents of}} Residente's then-girlfriend, former Miss Universe Denise Quiñones, who did not approve of the couple's relationship. [...] He explains that the song expresses how he will still date her regardless of their opinions, and author Ed Morales observes that [...] "It's a calling out of the morality of Latin America. [...] It's just an invitation to turn everything upside-down by embracing the ugly and profane in life and, you know, asking people to <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> journey." [...] "Tango del Pecado" [...] also created controversy due to the repeated chanting of [...] "Súbele el volumen a la música satánica" [...] (turn up the satanic music). [...] Residente asserts that he did not add the line to create a reaction, saying, [...] "I never do something expecting something. I do things because I like them." [...] "El Avión Se Cae" [...] depicts the thoughts of a drunken airplane passenger. In [...] "Pal Norte", Residente discusses the plight of immigrants in the United States. [...] Commenting on the track's lyrical themes, he explained [...] "I had wanted to do that theme because I think it is an important topic. And not just for the immigrants in the United States but all over. It is a song that immigrants can identify with, Dominicans as well as Puerto Ricans. All the people leave one country for another for the same reasons." [...] Although much of the album addresses immigration and moving to different countries, [...] "La Crema" [...] is a celebration of living in Puerto Rico.|$|E

2500|$|In July 2015, Mitsubishi {{announced}} that it would end production at the plant in Normal. [...] The plant had been operating well below capacity for several years. [...] In 2014, it produced just over 69,000 vehicles out of a capacity of 240,000 vehicles annually. Production would shift to Japan, with Mitsubishi importing all vehicles sold in North America. Mitsubishi said it would try to sell the plant to preserve jobs, but that the plant would be closed by November if no buyer was found. [...] Ultimately a buyer was not found in time, and production ended on the 30th of November. [...] Most of the workers (900 out of 1200) were let <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> date, with the rest staying to build replacement parts until the final closure of the plant in May 2016. [...] Eventually the plant was sold to Maynards Industries, an auctioning and liquidation firm, with ownership to transfer June 1, 2016.|$|E

60|$|This was due {{partly to}} a {{succession}} of bad Head-prefects, and partly to Leicester himself, who was well-meaning but weak. His spirit was willing, but his will was not spirited.
