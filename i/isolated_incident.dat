25|$|The {{murder of}} cab driver Monier Gindy on January 4, 2007, in Marrero, Louisiana, {{was not an}} <b>isolated</b> <b>incident.</b> Ever since Hurricane Katrina in 2005, cab drivers have {{increasingly}} been the targets of criminals terrorizing the New Orleans metropolitan area. The president of United Cab discourages his drivers from carrying firearms, instead advising them to accelerate the car and crash into a lamppost or even a police car if they are threatened with a gun.|$|E

25|$|There {{is another}} Nattapara in Hooghly district, a remote village in Balagarh block. There are some 100 dhakis in the village. There {{is not a}} single family without a dhaki. All used to go out to work as dhakis during the festive season, but now the demand has {{declined}} {{to such an extent that}} many are forced to give up the traditional profession and work as wage labourers. Worse still, a dhaki from the village was contacted by a well-known Durga Puja in Kolkata for Rs. 2,000. After he had performed his duties they paid him less and insulted him. It is not an <b>isolated</b> <b>incident</b> and there are similar complaints from dhakis in the Tarakeswar and Dhaniakhali regions.|$|E
25|$|A {{more direct}} {{manifestation of the}} growing {{reaction}} against secularism was {{the revival of the}} Sufi brotherhoods. Not only did suppressed Sufi orders such as the Kadiri, Mevlevi, Nakşibendi, Khālidiyyā and Al-Ṭarīqah al-Tijāniyyah reemerge, but new movements were formed, including the Nur Cemaati, Gülen movement, Sülaymānīyyā, Community of İskenderpaşa and İsmailağa. The Tijāni became especially militant in confronting the state. For example, Tijāni damaged monuments to Atatürk to symbolize their opposition to his policy of secularization. This was however a very <b>isolated</b> <b>incident</b> and only involved one particular Sheikh of the order. Throughout the 1950s, there were numerous trials of Ticani and other Sufi leaders for antistate activities. Simultaneously, however, some movements, notably the Süleymancı and Nurcular, cooperated with those politicians perceived as supportive of pro-Islamic policies. The Nurcular eventually advocated support for Turkey's multiparty political system, and one of its offshoots, the Gülen movement, had supported the True Path Party while the Işıkçılar and Enver Ören had openly supported the Motherland Party since the mid-1980s.|$|E
25|$|The first {{skirmish}} of the New Zealand Wars was the 1843 Wairau Affray at {{the north}} end of the South Island. It was an <b>isolated</b> <b>incident</b> caused by the Nelson settlers trying to seize land they did not own, an extra-legal vigilante action that resulted in twenty-two of them being killed. The Flagstaff or Northern War took place in the far north of New Zealand, around the Bay of Islands, in March 1845 and January 1846. This was about mana—tribal prestige—and customs duties. It was really a war between rival Māori chiefs with the British fighting on one side for the prestige of the British Empire. This was followed almost immediately by the Hutt Valley Campaign, March to August 1846, and the Wanganui Campaign, April to July 1847, in the south-west of the North Island. Both these conflicts were about the encroachment of the European settlers onto Māori land. In the first three wars Māori fought the British to a standstill each time. From the engagements emerged an understanding: English law prevailed in the townships and settlements, and Māori law and customs elsewhere. There followed a period of relative peace and economic cooperation from 1848 to 1860.|$|E
25|$|The {{administration}} of George W. Bush asserted {{that these were}} <b>isolated</b> <b>incidents,</b> not indicative of general U.S. policy.

These organizations stated that the abuses at Abu Ghraib were not <b>isolated</b> <b>incidents,</b> but were part of a wider pattern of torture and brutal treatment at American overseas detention centers, including those in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Guantanamo Bay. Several scholars stated that the abuses constituted state-sanctioned crimes.|$|R

500|$|A minor {{incident}} occurred involving blind Member of Parliament David Blunkett, who was attending {{the opening ceremony}} alongside a Channel 4 director.

However, Blunkett noted that this was an <b>isolated</b> <b>incident</b> and chose not to make an issue of it, simply advising organisers to [...] "seek to find a solution rather than impose a preconceived notion of what is or is not possible." ...|$|E
500|$|Following {{a review}} of the source {{material}} related to the AD 52 naumachia, Leon observes that the fighters were not gladiators but were convicted criminals sentenced to death.

500|$|Shortly {{after the}} murder, later-disbarred American {{attorney}} Jack Thompson, who has campaigned against violence in video games, {{claimed that he}} had written to Rockstar after the game was released, warning them {{that the nature of}} the game could inspire copycat killings; [...] "I wrote warning them that somebody was going to copycat the Manhunt game and kill somebody. We have had dozens of killings in the U.S. by children who had played these types of games. This is not an <b>isolated</b> <b>incident.</b> These types of games are basically murder simulators.

500|$|During the {{aftermath}} of the murder of Stefan Pakeerah, by his friend Warren Leblanc in Leicestershire, England, the game Manhunt was linked after the media wrongfully claimed police found a copy in Leblanc's room. The police officially denied any link, citing drug-related robbery as the motive and revealing that the game had been found in Pakeerah's bedroom, not Leblanc's. Thompson, who had heard of the murder, claimed that he had written to Rockstar after the game was released, warning them that the nature of the game could inspire copycat killings: [...] "I wrote warning them that somebody was going to copycat the Manhunt game and kill somebody.

500|$|It was at {{this time}} that the pan-Islamic Khilafat Movement began in India. Gandhi, until then {{relatively}} unknown on the Indian political scene, began emerging as a mass leader. His call for protests against the Rowlatt Act achieved an unprecedented response of furious unrest and protests. The situation—especially in Punjab—deteriorated rapidly, with disruptions of rail, telegraph, and communication systems. The movement peaked {{in the first week of}} April, with some recording that [...] "practically the whole of Lahore was on the streets; the immense crowd that passed through Anarkali was estimated to be around 20,000." [...] In Amritsar, over 5,000 people gathered at Jallianwala Bagh. The situation deteriorated perceptibly over the next few days. The British feared that a more sinister conspiracy for rebellion was brewing under the veneer of peaceful protests. O'Dwyer is said to have believed that these were the early and ill-concealed signs of a coordinated uprising—on the lines of the 1857 revolt—that he expected to take place in May, when British troops would have withdrawn to the hills for the summer. Contrary to being an <b>isolated</b> <b>incident,</b> the Amritsar massacre—as well as responses to other events that preceded and succeeded it—was the end result of a concerted plan of response from the Punjab administration to suppress such a conspiracy. James Houssemayne Du Boulay is said to have ascribed a direct relationship between the fear of a Ghadarite uprising in the midst of an increasingly tense situation in Punjab and the British response that ended in the massacre.|$|E
