40|$|BackgroundThe use of 6 -minute walk {{test for}} {{assessing}} the functional status capacity of patients with chronic heart failure is commonly applied as prognostic gauges for systolic HF patients. The aim of study was to verify the impact of 6 MWD in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) and to analyze the relation between clinical and echocardiographic data and the 6 minutes walk test (6 MWT) in patients with chronic systolic heart failure. Methods and results 814 patients (age 63 years, 68 % males) with CHF underwent a six-minute walk test in a therapeutic unit of heart failure. Clinical data, biological and echocardiographic parametres were campared. We divided patients for 3 groups: group 1 : 6 MWD 450 m (n= 20). 154 patients (19 %) were in NYHA <b>functionnal</b> class III: 96 % (n= 148) patients in group 1, 3 % (n= 5) in group 2 and 1 % (n= 1) in group 3 (p= 0. 04). Age, hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, Ischemic heart disease, strock attack did not differ among the groups. However male sex, diastolic dysfunction (p= 0. 01), right ventricular systolic dysfunction (p< 0. 0001), hospitaliszation rate for cardiac decompensation (p< 0. 0001), high heart rate {{were higher in the}} group with 6 MWF< 300 m.

40|$|Rehabilitation {{of elderly}} amputees raises several issues. Taking {{into account that}} amputations are {{frequently}} performed in elderly patients, with vascular diseases, it seems relevant to ask whether it is preferable to perform an amputation and quickly rehabilitate the patient or to attempt revascularisation and save the patient's limb. The knowledge {{of the outcome of}} amputation is crucial for the choice of treatment Therefore, we discuss limb amputation In old patients in terms of epidemiology, aetiology, <b>functionnal</b> characteristics, specific problems and results with regards to expectations. Types and characteristics of prostheses, as well as rehabilitation and cost-effectiveness are briefly discussed. It is concluded that amputation is a mutilating procedure which carries for the elderly a poor outcome in terms of rehabilitation.

We use a non-hermitian {{representation of the}} Hamiltonian, and a <b>functionnal</b> representation of the generating function, where the integration variable consists of non-local supermatrices, due to the non-locality of the Aharanov-Bohm interaction. The conductivity coefficients are computed using a specific saddle-point procedure, which incorporates ladder diagrams contributions. The situation with an external uniform magnetic field is considered with the two different spin projection possibilities. The limit of vanishingly small external magnetic field is unstable with respect to spin flip, because of E= 0 states. In particular a quantized step is obtained when comparing the Hall conductance between the two possible spin projections. Comment: 19 pages, 4 figure...|$|E
