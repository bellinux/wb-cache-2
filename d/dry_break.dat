40|$|Azlons are {{increasingly}} concerned for their excellent performance properties and biodegradation. A kind of novel azlon, zein/viscose textibe fibers, were fabricated by wet-spinning of zein and cellulose sulfonate blended solution. Some parameters that determine the fabrication process were optimized. The structure and properties of zein/viscose fibers were characterized, and {{compared with those}} of common viscose fibers. <b>Dry</b> <b>breaking</b> tenacity of zein/viscose fibers was 2. 02 CN/dtex, whereas <b>dry</b> <b>breaking</b> elongation was 16. 6 %. Mechanical properties of zein/viscose fibers were a little better than common viscose fibers. The moisture regain rate of zein/viscose fibers was 14. 1 %, similar to that of viscose fibers. From the microstructure of zein/viscose fiber, viscose acted as framework and zein was accreted to viscose. The content of protein was 14. 48 % in zein/viscose fibers. The basic chains of zein and viscose were not changed by blended spinning, so the fibers had advantages of both zein and viscose. (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

50|$|A {{steam box}} is a long, sealed {{container}} used to steam wooden planks {{for the purpose}} of making them pliable. Once steamed and then fastened or clamped into the desired position and left to dry, the wood will hold the new shape. Steam boxes allow for much more efficient use of wood. Instead of cutting the desired shape away from a large and more expensive piece of wood and leaving much scrap to be discarded, steam boxes allow for a smaller piece to be bent in the general shape and leaving much less scrap. Steam boxes also allow the wood to bend beyond its <b>dry</b> <b>breaking</b> point, which is useful in making extreme curves with the wood. In many cases, the bent piece is stronger than an identical piece cut from larger stock. Steam bending wood allows the wood grain to follow the bend, leaving it strong where a piece cut from larger stock would snap across crosscut grains or laminated joints.|$|R

40|$|Contrasting {{signals of}} genetic {{divergence}} due to historic and contemporary gene flow were inferred for Coachwood, Ceratopetalum apetalum (Cunoniaceae), a wind-dispersed canopy tree endemic to eastern Australian warm temperate rainforest. Analysis of nine nuclear microsatellites across 22 localities revealed two clusters between {{northern and southern}} regions and with vicariance centred on the wide Hunter River Valley. Within populations diversity was high indicating a relatively high level of pollen dispersal among populations. Genetic variation was correlated to differences in regional biogeography and ecology corresponding to IBRA regions, primary factors being soil type and rainfall. Eleven haplotypes were identified by chloroplast microsatellite analysis from the same 22 localities. A lack of chloroplast diversity within sites demonstrates limited gene flow via seed dispersal. Network representation indicated regional sharing of haplotypes indicative of multiple Pleistocene refugia as well as deep divergences between regional elements of present populations. Chloroplast differentiation between sites in {{the upper and lower}} sections of the northern population is reflective of historic vicariance at the Clarence River Corridor. There was no simple vicariance explanation for the distribution of the divergent southern chlorotype, but its distribution may be explained by the effects of drift from a larger initial gene pool. Both the Hunter and Clarence River Valleys represent significant <b>dry</b> <b>breaks</b> within the species range, consistent with this species being rainfall dependent rather than cold-adapted.

25|$|The Pamunkey {{tradition}} of pottery making {{dates back to}} before the English settled Jamestown. They have been using clay from {{the banks of the}} Pamunkey River since prehistoric times. Many continue to use the traditional method. To do so, they let the clay <b>dry,</b> then <b>break</b> it into smaller pieces. These pieces are soaked in water until reaching the consistency of cream. The clay is strained to remove rocks or debris. The water is drained and pressed out until the clay is like dough. It is then ready to be made into pots. Traditional pottery by Pamunkey ancestors of the Woodland Period was strengthened with crushed or burned shells, crushed steatite, river pebbles, or quartz sand.|$|R
5000|$|Each step on {{an island}} sinks about 2-4" [...] {{depending}} on {{the density of the}} ground underfoot. As the reeds <b>dry,</b> they <b>break</b> up more and more as they are walked upon. As the reed breaks up and moisture gets to it, it rots, and a new layer has to be added to it. It is {{a lot of work to}} maintain the islands. Because the people living there receive so many tourists now, they have less time to maintain everything, so they have to work even harder in order to keep up with the tourists and with the maintenance of their island. Tourism provides financial opportunities for the natives, while simultaneously challenging their traditional lifestyle.|$|R
50|$|Under trade wind conditions, {{there is}} very often a {{pronounced}} moisture discontinuity between 4000 and 8000 ft. Below these heights, the air is moist; above, it is <b>dry.</b> The <b>break</b> (a large-scale feature of the Pacific High) {{is caused by a}} temperature inversion embedded in the moving trade wind air. The inversion tends to suppress the vertical movement of air and so restricts cloud development to the zone just below the inversion. The inversion is present 50 to 70 percent of the time; its height fluctuates from day to day, but it is usually between 5000 and 7000 ft. On trade wind days when the inversion is well defined, the clouds develop below these heights with only an occasional cloud top breaking through the inversion.|$|R
40|$|Consecutive {{investigations}} in 1994, 1996, 1998, and 2002 in the permanent plots established in Futian Mangrove Reserve of Shenzhen, Guangdong Province, {{revealed that the}} <b>breaking,</b> <b>drying</b> and death of the individual plants or branches in the mangrove communities were significant {{and the number of}} plants in plots covering an area of 200 m 2 was 417, 341, 196 and 132; the average density of population per square meter is 2. 08, 1. 70, 0. 98 and 0. 66; the death rate between the interval of two investigations is 18. 2 %, 42. 5 % and 32. 6 % respectively. The individuals of population exhibit an obvious diameter at breast height (DBH) growth. For example, the maximum increment of individual DBH was up to 3. 63, 2. 45, and 4. 52 cm in the dominant populations Aegiceras corniculatum (L.) Blanco (Ac), Kandelia candel(L.) Druce (Kc), and Avicennia marina (Forsk.) Vierh. (Am), respectively. At the same time, growth of individual height was also prominent. In the second investigation, 233 out of the 341 individuals exhibit a height growth; whereas the number under the third and fourth investigations was 127 out of 196 and 74 out of 132, respectively. During a 2 -year interval, the maximum height growth was 1. 5 m in Ac, 1. 9 m in Kc, and 1. 8 m in Am. The biomass also showed a relative change in the mangrove communities. The total biomass of stems and leaves decreased with time but occasionally an increase was found {{in the second and third}} investigations and finally a decrease in the fourth investigation. However, the average biomass of the survived individuals usually increased with time. In terms of the total biomass, the results of the four investigations were similar to the previous research in which the data were calculated by the methods of standardized timbers, etc. being 7. 57, 8. 36, 5. 15 and 7. 71 kg/m 2 during 1994, 1996, 1998 and 2002, respectively. The above analysis indicates that self-thinning of mangrove communities is an important evolutionary process, characterized by <b>drying,</b> <b>breaking,</b> and death of individuals/ramifications. During the process of evolution, fewer new seedlings developed, and individual height growth, DBH growth, breaking and death from dryness maybe closely related to the composition, structure and density of population in the mangrove communities...|$|R
