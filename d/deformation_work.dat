There was a close correlation between the mechanical characteristics and the non-ideal storage time. Sensory evaluation showed significant ranking in “bite and chewing”, “sweet taste” and “global impression” attributes according to the Page test. Principal component analysis (PCA) plots were determined for the acoustic stiffness coefficient, cutting force and <b>deformation</b> <b>work</b> ratio and these showed that PC 1 followed a tendency {{similar to that of}} the storage time.
