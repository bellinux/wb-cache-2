40|$|Plants produce {{hundreds}} of glycosidases. Despite their importance in cell wall (re) -modelling, protein and lipid modification and metabolite conversion, {{very little is}} known of this large class of glycolytic enzymes, partly because of their post-translational regulation and their elusive substrates. Consequently, glycosidases are poorly defined in plants and other organisms. Here, we apply activity-based glycosidase profiling using cell permeable small molecular probes that react covalently with the active site nucleophile of retaining glycosidases in an activity-dependent manner. Using mass spectrometry we detect the active state of dozens of myrosinases, glucosidases, xylosidases, and <b>galactosidases</b> representing seven different retaining glycosidase families. The method is simple and applicable on different organs, different plant species, in living cells and in subproteomes. We displayed the active state of previously uncharacterized glycosidases, one of which encoded by a previously declared pseudogene.

The two enzymes of permease and <b>galactosidase</b> are coded by two genes, lac(y) and lac(z) respectively (stated in the fifth and sixth rule of the program), in a cluster of genes (lac(X)) - called an operon - that is expressed when the amounts (amt) of glucose are low and lactose are high or when they are both at medium level (see {{the fourth and fifth}} rule).

50|$|Carbon {{sources are}} {{typically}} sugars or other carbohydrates, {{although in the}} case of substrate transformations (such as the production of vinegar) the carbon source may be an alcohol or something else altogether. For large scale fermentations, such as those used for the production of ethanol, inexpensive sources of carbohydrates, such as molasses, corn steep liquor, sugar cane juice, or sugar beet juice are used to minimize costs. More sensitive fermentations may instead use purified glucose, sucrose, glycerol or other sugars, which reduces variation and helps ensure the purity of the final product.

The first two activities (based on wet brain weight) rose with age until about 24 days, then declined moderately; this curve parallel somewhat the curve for ganglioside concentration in brain.

40|$|Plants {{have adapted}} a timed {{mechanism}} to release seeds from a dormant state to avoid unfavorable environmental conditions {{in order to}} establish a healthy plant and be able to reproduce. The release of seed dormancy to initiate germination involves the transcriptional regulation of β- 1, 3 -glucanases. A possible substrate of β- 1, 3 -glucanase activity is callose, which {{can be found in the}} endosperm of several plant seeds. However, the biochemical activities and substrate specificities of seed-expressed β- 1, 3 -glucanases have not been thoroughly investigated. In this study, two enzyme isoforms from Arabidopsis thaliana grouped in Glycosyl Hydrolase Family 43 (Carbohydrate Active EnZyme database, www. cazy. org) have been characterized. Phylogenetic analysis reveals a closer similarity of known plant GH 43 sequences to putative bacterial β- 1, 3 -glucanases rather than to arabinanases, xylosidases, or <b>galactosidases.</b> AtGH 43 A and AtGH 43 B transcripts are relatively evenly expressed in both vegetative and reproductive plant tissues. The single- and double-mutants do not show significant visual phenotypes, even under various stress stimuli, yet a delay in seed germination is observed in the atgh 43 b mutant and, to a lesser extent, in the double mutant. Linkage analysis reveals a two-fold increase in the 3 -gal linkage in aerial and root cell walls. Recombinant proteins expressed in Nicotiana tabacum BY- 2 demonstrate activity by releasing glucose monosaccharides from purified Arabidopsis aerial cell walls in a time-dependent manner. AtGH 43 B enzyme has measurable activity against laminarin (β- 1, 3 -glucan), and β-gentiobiose (β- 1, 6 -glucan), but not to cellobiose (β- 1, 4 -glucan) or sophorose (β- 1, 2 -glucan). It is postulated that AtGH 43 A and AtGH 43 B may target callose (a 1, 3 -linked glucose polymer) or a 1, 6 -glucan linkage in AGPs or glycosylated protein which may affect seed germination.

The selectivity values in all the examined cases were below one, which implies that the hydrolysis, and not the synthesis, was the dominating reaction.
