5|$|If a {{baseball}} hits {{anywhere on the}} <b>dugout</b> it is considered out of play.|$|E
5|$|If {{a player}} catches {{a ball and}} falls into the <b>dugout</b> the batter is ruled out and the base runner is allowed one base.|$|E
5|$|The bullpens, reconfigured {{between the}} 2014 and 2015 seasons, are raised above the playing field, which allows fans to see {{pitchers}} warming up. Both bullpens are located adjacent to section 103 behind right-center field, with the Indians' bullpen {{closer to the}} field. Like the majority of ballparks, the Indians' <b>dugout</b> is along the third base line and the visitors' <b>dugout</b> is located along the first base line. When the ballpark was built it contained 121 luxury boxes. A remodel and renovation between the 2014 and 2015 seasons removed six of them for a new total of 115, the second most in Major League Baseball.|$|E
5|$|Everton {{constructed}} covered <b>dugouts</b> in 1931. The {{idea was}} inspired by a visit to Pittodrie to play a friendly against Aberdeen, where such <b>dugouts</b> had been constructed {{at the behest of the}} Dons' trainer Donald Colman. The Goodison Park <b>dugouts</b> were the first in England.|$|R
50|$|Dodson Field, is {{home of the}} Bearcat {{baseball}} team. The {{field was}} renovated in 2005 with new <b>dugouts,</b> new netting behind home plate, and concrete walls between the <b>dugouts.</b> Dodson field provides large <b>dugouts,</b> a grass infield, and Major League field dimensions. The field is named after James W. Dodson.|$|R

5|$|A {{player is}} only allowed {{to catch a}} fly ball on {{the first step of}} the <b>dugout.</b> If the player has one foot on the first step and his other foot on the second step the ball is ruled non-playable and the player is not allowed to catch it.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, Bonds's son Nikolai, {{who served}} as a Giants batboy during his father's years playing in San Francisco and always sat next to his dad in the <b>dugout</b> during games, was charged with five misdemeanors {{resulting}} from a confrontation with his mother, Sun. Barry accompanied him to San Mateo County Superior Court.|$|E
5|$|Initially, Greer {{was capable}} of seating 7,200spectators, but was {{expanded}} to 8,800 {{by the end of}} the inaugural season. Theater-type seats with back support and armrests accounted for 3,000 of the stadium's seats; bleacher seats made up the remainder. The press box included two radio broadcast booths and an organ booth. There were locker rooms for two teams, which each accommodated 25people, as well as a locker room for umpires. The field measured 330feet (100m) down the left and right field lines, 375feet (114m) to left- and right-center fields, and 405feet (123m) to center field. Bullpens are located in foul territory in the outfield, with the home team occupying the third base <b>dugout,</b> and the visitors occupying the first base <b>dugout.</b> Eight lighting grids atop steel poles 100feet (30m) high provided illumination for night games. Amenities for customers at the park included two men's and women's restrooms and seven concession stands.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dugouts</b> {{of varying}} degrees of comfort would be built {{in the rear of}} the support trench. British <b>dugouts</b> were usually 2.5 to 5 m deep, whereas German <b>dugouts</b> were {{typically}} much deeper, usually a minimum of 12 ft deep and sometimes dug three stories down, with concrete staircases to reach the upper levels.|$|R
50|$|Brinsford Lane {{boasts a}} clubhouse, a tearoom, {{and a small}} stand with bench seating for {{approximately}} 150 people. Its distinctive ivy-covered <b>dugouts</b> were featured in David Bauckham's book <b>Dugouts.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Their Watchet Lane {{ground was}} {{featured}} in David Bauckham's book <b>Dugouts,</b> which highlighted a large sign painted on {{the rear of the}} <b>dugouts</b> saying [...] "Please do not swear".|$|R
5|$|The Salt Lake Bees, the Angels' AAA affiliate, also {{postponed}} {{their game}} on April 9 against the Reno Aces. The team also wore a number 32 patch {{through the season}} representing Adenhart's jersey number during his time with the Bees. A number 32 was also painted on the grass {{in front of the}} Bees <b>dugout.</b>|$|E
5|$|Wood {{is used to}} {{construct}} carts, farm implements, boats, <b>dugout</b> canoes and in shipbuilding. It is used for making furniture, tool handles, boxes, ladders, musical instruments, bows, weapons, matches, clothes pegs, brooms, shoes, baskets, turnery, carving, toys, pencils, rollers, cogs, wooden screws, barrels, coffins, skittles, veneers, artificial limbs, oars, skis, wooden spoons, sports equipment and wooden balls.|$|E
5|$|As {{the teams}} {{prepared}} to leave their dressing rooms, Manchester City deliberately delayed their exit by a short period to play on any nerves the Leicester City players may have had. Manchester City coach Malcolm Allison was not permitted {{to take his place}} on the bench, as he was serving a touchline ban. Instead, he had to sit in the stand behind the <b>dugout.</b> Before kick-off, the players were introduced to the guest of honour, Princess Anne.|$|E
50|$|Individual leagues {{at levels}} below MLB {{are free to}} set their own rules {{governing}} the <b>dugouts</b> as is appropriate for their league's ballparks and playing level. For example, the rule governing reaching into <b>dugouts</b> to catch fly balls would not apply in leagues where the <b>dugouts</b> are separated from the field by a chain-link fence that is taller than the players.|$|R
50|$|From September to November 1915, the British 177th Tunnelling Company built {{tunnelled}} <b>dugouts</b> in {{the city}} ramparts near the Menin Gate. These were the first British tunnelled <b>dugouts</b> in the Ypres Salient.|$|R
50|$|The Greenfields Sports Ground {{features}} a small all-seater stand, some hard standing, dug outs, and floodlights. Its unusual wooden <b>dugouts,</b> set into a fence surrounding the pitch, were featured in David Bauckham's book <b>Dugouts.</b>|$|R
5|$|In December 2006, Aulie's {{father was}} using a tractor to clear snow off a frozen <b>dugout</b> in {{anticipation}} of an outdoor shinny game on New Year's Day. The ice could not support {{the weight of the}} tractor, and he fell through. Aulie was able to pull his father {{out of the water and}} get him to safety. The Canadian Red Cross honoured Aulie with their Rescuer Award for his act.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, Stein {{appeared}} to be in good spirits; during the warm-up, Wales goalkeeper Neville Southall found that the Scottish fans in the crowd kept all of the balls he and Eddie Niedzwiecki were using. On returning to the dressing room he spoke about it to Stein, who then went out onto the pitch and gestured to the fans to return all the balls. Prior to the start he took his place in the <b>dugout</b> and the game kicked off without incident.|$|E
5|$|Pre-historic {{finds in}} the parish of Eccles include <b>dugout</b> boats found at Barton-upon-Irwell, an arrowhead, a spear and axes at Winton, which taken {{together}} appear to suggest {{the existence of a}} hunting and travelling society. Human habitation in the area may extend as far back as 6000BC, with two separate periods of settlement on Chat Moss, the first around 500BC and the second during the Romano-British period.|$|E
50|$|Archmere's campus {{features}} two {{artificial turf}} fields (utilized by football, M/W soccer, M/W lacrosse, and field hockey), a baseball field (upgraded with <b>dugouts),</b> a softball field (upgraded with <b>dugouts),</b> six tennis courts, and a running track.|$|R
50|$|In autumn 1915, the 177th Tunnelling Company {{moved into}} Ypres itself, where it built {{tunnelled}} <b>dugouts</b> {{in the city}} ramparts near the Menin Gate from September to November 1915. These were the first British tunnelled <b>dugouts</b> in the Ypres Salient.|$|R
5000|$|Not all <b>dugouts</b> {{are located}} below the field level. At {{the major league}} level, the few <b>dugouts</b> that are located at the field level are in {{multi-purpose}} stadiums to simplify the conversion from baseball configuration to another sports field configuration. At such ballparks, the seating area is raised such that the <b>dugouts</b> do not obstruct the spectators' view. <b>Dugouts</b> are also at field level at most amateur ballparks, where locating them below field level would be cost prohibitive or otherwise not beneficial. In these cases, the term [...] "dugout" [...] still applies, as does [...] "bench." [...] In {{the early days of}} professional baseball, the seating areas were often constructed high enough that the bench was at field level.|$|R
5|$|Shearer took a brief {{role in the}} <b>dugout</b> for {{his final}} three games under Glenn Roeder. Shearer had {{rejected}} offers of coaching or assistant roles at Newcastle under both the returning Kevin Keegan in February 2008 and Joe Kinnear in November 2008. Shearer had previously had talks about, but never been offered, a full-time manager's role at Newcastle until his appointment on 1 April 2009.|$|E
5|$|Supplies {{could be}} flown into Wau if fighter cover was available. On 5 September, 12 planeloads of {{supplies}} were dropped at Kudjeru. To economise on scarce transport aircraft, air transport was supplemented by an overland route. Supplies were {{shipped to the}} mouth of the Lakekamu in luggers, transported up the river to Bulldog in launches or powered <b>dugout</b> canoes, and then carried over the Bulldog Track by native carriers.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} human {{habitation}} {{in and around}} Pettigrew State Park stretches {{back as far as}} 8000 BC. Archaeologists have found thousands of relics at the park, including pottery, arrowheads, and sunken <b>dugout</b> canoes. Estimates place some of the dugouts as being at least 4,400 years old. They were preserved {{in the bottom of the}} lake by its unusually clean waters.|$|E
50|$|The {{grounds of}} several {{teams in the}} league, most notably Brown Clee, were {{featured}} in David Bauckham's book <b>Dugouts,</b> which noted the high frequency of <b>dugouts</b> with lockable doors which are also used for storage, a feature seemingly unique to clubs in Shropshire.|$|R
50|$|The Hanks' <b>Dugouts</b> are {{a series}} of pioneer {{dwellings}} in southern Utah, in what is now Capitol Reef National Park. The <b>dugouts</b> were constructed as temporary housing for the Ephraim K. Hanks family, Mormon pioneers who established the now-vanished Floral Ranch on Pleasant Creek in April 1883. The remains of three <b>dugouts</b> and one other structure remain at the site. All above-ground construction has collapsed. The <b>dugouts</b> were abandoned in 1888 when the Hanks' built a four-room frame house, although the homestead claim of Hanks' widow claims that a one-room log house was built at the time of settlement. The site includes debris such as ceramic and glass, and pieces of a wagon. The settlement reflects a typical early Mormon homestead of the time.|$|R

5|$|A {{rich source}} of Late Paleolithic sites and {{artifacts}} (the Magdalenian culture of 14,500 BCE) is the Prądnik River Valley. The Maszycka Cave there contained {{the remains of a}} typical (at that time) social unit of several families, 20-30 people, as well as numerous tools and other artifacts of their culture, including ornamented bone utensils. Remnants of a 15,000 to 17,000 years old Magdalenian culture dwelling (a <b>dugout</b> cabin site with traces of supporting posts, a hearth and imported materials) were discovered recently in Ćmielów, Ostrowiec Świętokrzyski County.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} the penalty was taken, the Welsh <b>dugout</b> was {{surrounded}} by press and photographers, as the home team were still leading 1–0. With the scores levelled, the pack switched {{their attention to the}} Scottish bench, which led to Stein remonstrating with at least one photographer {{to move out of the}} way of his view of the game. Both Professor Stewart Hillis, the Scotland team doctor (who was also Stein's consultant), and Welsh manager Mike England stated that there appeared to be nothing wrong at this point.|$|E
5|$|Bob Napolitano, Wilson's {{coach at}} Londonderry High School, noticed Wilson's ability to {{concentrate}} on baseball. Napolitano specifically remembered the first home game of Wilson's senior year, which happened shortly after his father's death. No fewer than 29 professional scouts, all with radar guns, showed up to see him pitch. According to Napolitano, Wilson was completely oblivious to their appearance; he ate and drank in the <b>dugout,</b> warmed up, and pitched a two-hitter while apparently not noticing that scouts were there. The Cleveland Indians offered him a contract straight out of high school, {{but he did not}} sign, opting to attend college instead.|$|E

50|$|Even {{though some}} {{buildings}} were {{built by the}} end of the Civil War, the troops still had primitive housing. M. Wisner wrote his company arrived in January 1865 and had to build <b>dugouts</b> with mud chimneys. He noted these <b>dugouts</b> had been comfortable in the severe cold weather.|$|R
