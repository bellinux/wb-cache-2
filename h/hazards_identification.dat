40|$|The Wenchuan {{earthquake}} triggered many landslides along Province Road 303 (PR 303) in Sichuan Province. These landslide deposits pose hazards to {{the safety}} of the traffic and road facilities under rainfall conditions. Some of the slopes are hard to access as the terrains are steep and high. How to identify the hazards is a challenge to engineers. In this paper, a method for <b>hazards</b> <b>identification</b> is demonstrated for a segment of PR 303 between milestones K 34 + 00 m and K 34 + 200 m. This method consists of three steps. First, identify all possible hazard sources based on field surveys and aerial photographs. Second, analyze past failure events to single out the most likely sources of hazards. Finally, apply numerical reliability analysis to ascertain the sources of hazards.

40|$|Misidentifying {{chemical}} hazards {{can have}} serious deleterious effects. Consequences of not identifying a chemical are obvious and include fires, explosions, injury to workers, etc. Consequences of identifying hazards {{that are really}} not present can be equally as bad. Misidentifying hazards can result in increased work with loss of productivity, increased expenses, utilization/consumption of scarce resources, and the potential to modify the work to include chemicals or processes that are actually more hazardous than those originally proposed. For these reasons, accurate <b>hazard</b> <b>identification</b> is critical to any safety program. <b>Hazard</b> <b>identification</b> {{in the world of}} chemistry is, at best, a daunting task. The knowing or understanding, of the reactions between any of approximately twelve million known chemicals that may be hazardous, is the reason for this task being so arduous. Other variables, such as adding other reactants/contaminants or changing conditions (e. g., temperature, pressure, or concentration), make hazard determination something many would construe as being more than impossibly difficult. Despite these complexities, people who do not have an extensive background in the chemical sciences can be called upon to perform chemical <b>hazard</b> <b>identification.</b> Because <b>hazard</b> <b>identification</b> in the area of chemical safety is so burdensome and because people {{with a wide variety of}} training are called upon to perform this work, tools are required to aid in chemical <b>hazard</b> <b>identification.</b> Many tools have been developed.

40|$|Safety risk {{assessment}} {{is one of}} the functions in a Safety Management System and an important element of safety {{risk assessment}} is the identification of hazards. A hazard can be considered as a dormant potential for harm which is present {{in one form or another}} within the aviation system or its environment. This potential for harm may be in the form of a natural hazard such as terrain, or a technical hazard such as wrong runway markings. This document develops the concept of ‘the hazard ’ within a safety risk management framework which also defines risk, safety events, undesirable events, outcomes, consequences and risk controls (barriers or mitigations). The basic concepts behind hazard identification methodologies (data-driven and qualitative) are described. It is acknowledged however that it is difficult to declare completeness of a <b>hazards</b> <b>identification</b> process, and hence hazard identification should be periodically reviewed. Moreover, it is further recognised that the aviation system involves a complex interaction between technical and human-centred sub-systems operated by a wide range of different stakeholders (Airlines, Airports, ANSP and MRO etc.). Each organisation should manage the hazards that fall within their managerial control, but should also co-operate with other stakeholders to help manage interactions and interfaces. A number of specific tools and techniques for <b>hazards</b> <b>identification</b> are summarised and their advantages and disadvantages noted. These tools and techniques include...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the paper is to {{investigate}} safety <b>hazard</b> <b>identification</b> in the con-struction industry towards the improvement of employee’s health and safety (H&S). Unidentified hazards {{in the construction industry}} are likely to present the most unavoidable risks. Therefore, <b>hazard</b> <b>identification</b> is paramount to con-struction safety management since risk assessment is the practical means by which hazardous events are managed. The study is mainly literature review with reference to existing theoretical literature, published and unpublished research. The paper presents an overview of hazards and accident causation. The findings from the study have shown that falls at construction sites are {{the leading cause of death}} and most of these deaths were attributed to falls from roofs, scaffolds, and ladders. Construction accidents lead to delay in project completion, increase the expenses and ruin the reputation and reliability of constructors. The following were identified as some of the barriers to H&S improvement: lack of information sharing across projects, full-time safety department, subjective nature of <b>hazard</b> <b>identification</b> and risk assessment. The study explores safety hazard identifica-tion in the construction industry towards the improvement of employee’s H&S.
