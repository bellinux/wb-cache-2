5000|$|According to {{the reactor}} design specification, the uranium hydride core is {{surrounded}} by hydrogen-absorbing storage trays, made of depleted uranium or thorium. The storage trays can either desorb or absorb the hydrogen gas from the core. During normal operation (with the operating temperature being approximately [...] ), the storage trays are kept at a temperature high enough to expel the hydrogen gas to the core. The storage trays are heated or cooled by means of heat pipes and an external thermal source. Thus, in a steady state, the uranium hydride core <b>is</b> <b>slaved</b> <b>to</b> {{the temperature of the}} storage trays.

50|$|The {{commander}} and gunner have largely identical multispectral image sights, with visible electromagnetic spectrum and thermography channels and laser rangefinders. The commander's sight is {{installed on the}} turret top and has a 360° field of view, while the gunner's, situated in the turret's niche to the gun's left, <b>is</b> <b>slaved</b> <b>to</b> it and is additionally equipped with a direct-vision periscopic channel and laser designator for the T-14's gun-launched, SACLOS anti-tank missiles. The detection distance of tank-sized objects for both sights is 7,500 m (8000) in daylight, through the TV/periscopic channel, and ≈3,500 m at night through the thermal channel. There is also a backup night-vision capable sight, with 2,000/1,000 m respective detection distances. In addition to traditional vision periscopes, the driver has a forward looking infrared camera {{and a number of}} zooming closed-circuit television cameras. Video cameras are installed for all-round vision for the crew, since it lacks the normal vantage point of turret roof hatches. This 360-degree camera coverage is perhaps one of the T-14's most unusual features, made necessary because of extremely limited visibility without them. The crew, clustered {{in the front of the}} hull, would have poor situation awareness if the camera setup and video feeds were to fail.|$|E
50|$|Type 347 radar is {{frequently}} but erroneously referred {{by many as}} either Type 349 or Type 348, because externally, all three radars look very similar, and all three are developed as fire control radar for small caliber guns. In reality, the three radars are different {{and they can be}} easily distinguished by the following features: When electro-optics (EO) are integrated with radar, EO is installed on the portside of Type 347 radar antenna, but for Type 348 and Type 349, EO is installed on the starboard side of the radar antenna. Furthermore, when incorporated as part of CIWS, Type 349 <b>is</b> <b>slaved</b> <b>to</b> Type 730 CIWS gun and thus does not rotate, because the gun rotates when searching/tracking. In contrast, Type 348 is not slaved to the Type 76 37mm twin guns, but instead, installed separately from the gun mounts, and thus Type 348 rotates when searching/tracking. The shape of antenna is also an important visual cue to distinguish three radars. The tip of Type 349 radar is a conical, which is missing on Type 347. Instead, the tip of Type 347 radar antenna is a small circular flat surface, missing the tip of the cone. The antenna of Type 348 radar differs from both Type 347 and Type 349 radars in that most of the cone is missing, only the base remains, so the antenna of Type 348 radar has a very large circular flat surface, resulting in Type 348 radar resembles a scaled down version of another larger fire control radar for larger caliber guns (76 mm or greater), Type 344.|$|E

5000|$|Type 348 radar {{is one of}} {{the most}} misidentified Chinese radars because it is {{frequently}} but erroneously referred by many as several other Chinese radars due to confusion. For example, Type 348 has been confused with and misidentified as much larger Chinese active phased array radar Type 346. Additionally, Type 348 radar is also misidentified with two other fire control radars of its same class: Type 347 and Type 349. Type 347, 348, and 349 are all fire control radars for small caliber guns and all share the similar size and configuration, so they looks very similar externally, but in reality, they are different radars.

Mirror images feature prominently in the film, including the twin cenobite and literal mirrors that Angelique and Paul use. In Kane's analysis, Paul not only mirrors his ancestors but also Pinhead, whom he emulates to become stronger. Kane describes how darkness and light also {{show up in the}} film, sometimes literally, as when light kills Pinhead, and sometimes metaphorically, as when Angelique and Pinhead show elements of their underlying humanity.|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn this paper, a {{generalization}} {{of the concept}} of selective "slaved" pulses in NMR spectroscopy introduced recently by the authors is presented. The shape of these pulses <b>is</b> <b>slaved</b> <b>to</b> that of a signal produced by the sample by the action of an electronic feedback loop. The theoretical analysis is based on results of the theory of nonlinear dynamical systems, which predicts the possibility of performing 90 ° self-calibrated radiofrequency pulses, through the simultaneous action of a constant radio-frequency field and of a magnetization dependent field of the kind above. Experimental demonstrations show that rotation of the magnetization onto the xy-plane is achieved, regardless of its initial position. Moreover, it is shown to remain stable for more than 50 ms, without significant loss of intensity...|$|E
