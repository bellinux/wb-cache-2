5|$|Vaan was {{conceptualized}} {{as the main}} character for Final Fantasy XII in order to contrast the older hero from Square's previous title Vagrant Story {{as a result of}} negative <b>feedback</b> <b>received</b> by fans. Critical reception to Vaan's character has been mixed {{as a result of his}} lack of involvement with the Final Fantasy XIIs plot although various video game publications still found him likable.|$|E
5|$|With the <b>feedback</b> <b>received</b> from players {{after the}} release of Nightmare, Brett Clements and Phillip Tanner started work on the major update to the series. They struck a deal with J. W. Spear & Sons, to use {{publishing}} experience and market research with Nightmare to help create the new game. The deal allowed J. W. Spear & Sons to have input into how the game was developed, which was not the case with Nightmare. Village Roadshow was also involved with the game's development and with its release in the United States. The development ended six years after it started, with about six million dollars invested {{in the development of the}} game.|$|E
5|$|Enterprise was {{the second}} Star Trek series to be {{released}} in high definition on Blu-ray following the earlier releases of Star Trek: The Next Generation, with season one delivered on March 26, 2013. The fans of the franchise were asked for feedback on potential covers for the first season release, but as there was no clear winner, a new design was created based on the <b>feedback</b> <b>received.</b> The second season was released on August 20, 2013, the third season was on January 7, 2014, and the final season on April 29, 2014. The Blu-ray releases featured both the same additional features as the DVD release, in addition to new features exclusive to these releases. In January 2017 a new 24 disc Blu-ray set of the whole series was released. This set includes the whole series in 1080p with a screen size ratio of 1.78:1 (widescreen) and with the sound in DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 (5 channels plus subwoofer). The set includes 97 episodes from its original broadcast run {{at the dawn of the}} 21st century and features like a cast reunion. Note that the Blu-ray release in 1080p is actually higher than its original broadcast resolution which ranged from 720p to 1080i.|$|E

5|$|After {{completing}} work on Super Smash Bros. Brawl for the Wii, Masahiro Sakurai {{was taken}} out for a meal by Nintendo's then-CEO Satoru Iwata in July 2008. During their meal, Iwata asked Sakurai to develop a launch title for the Nintendo 3DS. The platform was still in early development at the time, with Sakurai being the first external staff member to learn of its existence. On his way home, Sakurai was faced with both ideas and problems: Sora Ltd., which had developed Super Smash Bros. Brawl, had been drastically reduced in size {{as most of the}} game's staff had been either from other Nintendo teams or outsourced. While he had the option to creating an easy-to-develop port for the system, Sakurai decided to create a game around the third-person shooter genre, which was unpopular in Japan yet seemed suited to the planned 3D effects of the 3DS. At this point, the project was still an original game. In later conversations with Iwata, Sakurai decided to use an existing Nintendo IP as the game's basis. This was inspired by <b>feedback</b> <b>received</b> from players of Super Smash Bros. Brawl that many members of its character roster had not been in an original game for some time. After a positive response from Iwata at the suggestion, Sakurai ran through the possible franchises and decided to use Kid Icarus due to its long absence from the gaming market and continued popularity in the West. He also decided upon him due to his involvement with the character through Super Smash Bros. Brawl. Once he had chosen a possible series, he conceived the basic sequence of five-minute aerial segments, ground-based combat and bosses at the end of chapters. After submitting his plan, Sakurai was given the go-ahead to develop the game. One of the other franchises under consideration by Sakurai for use in the game was Star Fox, but he felt that there were some restrictions in implementing the planned gameplay features within the Star Fox setting. Uprising was the first Kid Icarus game to be developed since the Western-exclusive 1991 Game Boy title , and the first to be planned for Japan since the original Kid Icarus in 1986.|$|E

40|$|We {{propose that}} writers must form {{accurate}} representations {{of how their}} readers will interpret their texts to convey their ideas successfully. In two experiments, we investigated whether getting feedback from their readers helps writers form better representations of how their texts are interpreted. In our first experiment, one group of subjects (writers) wrote descriptions {{of a set of}} geometric figures; another group of subjects (readers) read those descriptions and used them to select the figures from sets of similar looking distractor figures. Half the writers <b>received</b> <b>feedback</b> on how well their readers selected the figures, and half the writers did not receive this feed back. Those writers who <b>received</b> <b>feedback</b> improved their descriptions more than those writers who did not <b>receive</b> <b>feedback.</b> In our second experiment, half the writers received two treatments of feedback on their descriptions of one set of figures, whereas {{the other half of the}} writers did not <b>receive</b> <b>feedback.</b> Then, all the writers described a new set of figures. Those writers who had previously <b>received</b> <b>feedback</b> wrote better new descriptions than did those writers who had never <b>received</b> <b>feedback.</b> We concluded that feedback- even this minimal form of feedback- helps writers to envision how readers interpret their texts...|$|R
40|$|This study {{tries to}} answer some ever-existent {{questions}} in writing fields regarding approaching {{the most effective way}} to give feedback to students' errors in writing by comparing the effect of error correction and error detection on the improvement of students' writing ability. In order to achieve this goal, 60 pre-intermediate English learners were randomly divided into two groups: the first one was Direct <b>Feedback</b> Group, <b>receiving</b> <b>feedback</b> on their writing through error correction (DFG) and the other one was Indirect <b>Feedback</b> Group (IFG), <b>receiving</b> <b>feedback</b> in their writing through error detection along with the codes.

25|$|In addition, one of {{the most}} {{important}} ("first rank") diagnostic symptoms of schizophrenia is the patient's delusion of being controlled by an external force. People with schizophrenia will sometimes report that, although they are acting in the world, they do not recall initiating the particular actions they performed. This is sometimes likened to being a robot controlled by someone else. Although the neural mechanisms of schizophrenia are not yet clear, one influential hypothesis is that there is a breakdown in brain systems that compare motor commands with the <b>feedback</b> <b>received</b> from the body (known as proprioception), leading to attendant hallucinations and delusions of control.|$|E

On 31 January 1990, type certification was received from French authorities; it was followed by the awarding of US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certification on 28 August 1990. During early 1990, the first delivery of a TBM 700 occurred; the first production batch of 50 aircraft were sold out almost instantly. Early <b>feedback</b> <b>received</b> from operators and pilots was typically positive about the capabilities of the new aircraft, often praising its speed and generous power margins amongst other attributes.|$|E

2500|$|Blizzard {{has plans}} to add new {{characters}} and maps to the game. With respect to characters, Kaplan expected they will release these one at a time, rather than in groups, allowing the new character to be stabilized before adding the next. Kaplan referred to the negative <b>feedback</b> <b>received</b> after the grouped introduction of the final three charactersGenji, Mei, and D.Vaduring the closed beta period, which if repeated could be [...] "disruptive" [...] to the game's community. For example, the first new character, Ana, was revealed and playable on the Public Test region from July 12, 2016, and made available to all on the Windows version on July 19 with console versions following in the days after. Other characters like Sombra were added in a similar manner, along with other new features. In regards to maps, Blizzard first announced a new map, called [...] "Eichenwalde", on August 16, 2016. [...] Blizzard is also able to add in new game modes and cosmetics, such as sprays and skins, among other things. Themed limited-time modes and cosmetics have also been made available for events and holidays, such as the 2016 Summer Olympics or Halloween. Some of these additions are derived from player feedback to Blizzard. In {{the case of the}} [...] "Overwatch Uprising" [...] event during April 2017, Kaplan said that players wanted to have more story put into the game, inspiring them to create a new story-driven player-vs-environment mode set during Overwatch's past that helped to create some new narrative and provide cosmetic items to reflect that.|$|E
