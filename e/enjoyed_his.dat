5|$|Although he <b>enjoyed</b> <b>his</b> work, Kraft {{found it}} {{increasingly}} stressful, {{especially since he}} did not consider {{himself to be a}} strong theoretician. In 1956, he was diagnosed with an ulcer and started thinking about a change of career.|$|E
5|$|Dale {{was born}} on 6 May 1947 in Dunedin, Otago, New Zealand. One of four children, Dale <b>enjoyed</b> <b>his</b> childhood, but his family was {{relatively}} poor. Although he was a gentle child, Dale was bullied so he learned to defend and stand up for himself.|$|E
5|$|Although Shaw's unmasking scene {{lasted only}} {{two minutes and}} seven seconds and {{included}} just 24 words of dialogue spoken by Shaw, he received more fan mail and autograph requests from Return of the Jedi than he had for any role {{in the rest of}} his career. He later reflected that he very much <b>enjoyed</b> <b>his</b> experience filming for Return of the Jedi and expressed particular surprise that an action figure was made of him from the film.|$|E

5|$|Constantine neither <b>enjoyed</b> <b>his</b> legal studies, nor {{found the}} work easy, but was {{determined}} to prove he could succeed. His wife kept him motivated, restricted visitors to avoid distractions and forced him to study, making him continue when he was several times tempted to give up. The family moved to London in 1949; between 1950 and 1954, Constantine passed the required series of examinations, and in 1954 he was called to the bar by the Middle Temple.|$|E
5|$|In 1953 Gielgud {{made his}} first Hollywood film, the sole {{classical}} actor in Joseph L. Mankiewicz's Julius Caesar, playing Cassius. Marlon Brando (Mark Antony) was in awe of him, and James Mason (Brutus) was disheartened at Gielgud's seemingly effortless skill. Gielgud, for his part, felt he learned much about film technique from Mason. Gielgud <b>enjoyed</b> <b>his</b> four-month stay in California, not least, as Morley comments, for the relaxed attitude there to homosexuality.|$|E
5|$|In October 1906, Keynes's Civil Service {{career began}} as a clerk in the India Office. He <b>enjoyed</b> <b>his</b> work at first, but by 1908 had become bored and {{resigned}} his position to return to Cambridge and work on probability theory, at first privately funded only by two dons at the university – his father and the economist Arthur Pigou.|$|E

5|$|On Bates's {{return to}} England, he was {{encouraged}} by Charles Darwin to write up his eleven-year stay in the Amazon as a book. The result was widely admired, not least by Darwin; other reviewers sometimes disagreed with the book's support for evolution, but generally <b>enjoyed</b> <b>his</b> account of the journey, scenery, people, and natural history. The book has been reprinted many times, mostly in Bates's own effective abridgement for the second edition, which omitted the more technical descriptions.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{reveals that}} the entire story was a fanfiction created by the Ice King that he is reading to Finn and Jake (who are {{incapacitated}} in ice). The Ice King asks how they <b>enjoyed</b> <b>his</b> story; Finn hesitates at first but hurriedly placates him when Ice King threatens them with his ice powers.|$|E
5|$|After {{an anxious}} journey of nine days {{during which they}} were honoured in some towns and refused entry to others, Metternich, his wife, and son Richard arrived in the Dutch city of Arnhem. They stayed until Metternich regained his strength, then reached Amsterdam and The Hague, where they waited to hear {{the results of a}} {{demonstration}} by English chartists, planned for 10 April. On 20 April they landed at Blackwall in London, where they stayed in the Brunswick Hotel in Hanover Square for a fortnight until they found a permanent residence. Metternich largely <b>enjoyed</b> <b>his</b> time in London: the Duke of Wellington, now nearly eighty, tried to keep him entertained, and there were also visits from Palmerston, Guizot (now also in exile) and Benjamin Disraeli, who <b>enjoyed</b> <b>his</b> political conversation. The sole disappointment was that Victoria herself did not acknowledge his presence in the capital. The trio leased a house, 44 Eaton Square, for four months. The younger children joined them in the summer. He followed events in Austria from afar, famously denying ever having erred; in fact, he declared the turmoil in Europe to be vindication of his policies. In Vienna, a hostile post-censorship press continued to attack him; in particular, they accused him of embezzlement and accepting bribes, prompting an investigation. Metternich was eventually cleared of the more extreme charges, and searches for evidence of the lesser ones came up empty handed. (In all likelihood Metternich's large expense claims were merely a product of the necessities of early 19th century diplomacy.) Meanwhile, as he was denied his pension, Metternich was ironically reliant on loans.|$|E

5|$|Chapman {{was popular}} at Cambridge and <b>enjoyed</b> <b>his</b> time there. He {{took part in}} a variety of social engagements and became {{involved}} in other sports. These included fives, tennis, rugby union, golf and football. He captained Pembroke College at rugby and was close to playing for the full university side. Chapman continued to play rugby for Berkshire Wanderers until he was nearly 30 years old. Also for Pembroke, he played as goalkeeper in the football team and might have played for the university at hockey had he taken the sport seriously. In later years, he also displayed proficiency at tennis, in which critics thought he could have reached a high standard if motivated to do so, and golf.|$|E
5|$|Developed as a {{defensive}} specialist through much of his career, Conroy was twice {{a finalist for the}} Frank J. Selke Trophy as the NHL's top defensive forward, and was nominated for the Lady Byng Memorial Trophy as its most gentlemanly player. He played over 1,000 games in the NHL and was the second-oldest player in League history to reach that milestone. Conroy, who <b>enjoyed</b> <b>his</b> greatest offensive seasons with the Flames, is a former captain of the team and was twice honored by the organization for his leadership, dedication and humanitarian efforts.|$|E
5|$|Early in the 1889–90 Australian season, Trumble {{endured a}} period where {{he was not able}} to take wickets consistently. With {{selection}} of the Australian team to tour England in 1890 due at this time, Trumble was anxious about this poor run of form. Noting his anxiety while playing, a friend offered him a beer during the lunch break to revive his spirits. Previously a teetotaler, Trumble <b>enjoyed</b> <b>his</b> first taste and ordered another before re-entering the field of play. Feeling relaxed, although wondering about his steadiness of step, Trumble took a succession of wickets to ensure his selection in the Australian team. Trumble finished the season with 27wickets at an average of 14.20 per wicket.|$|E

5|$|Hayes {{attended}} the common schools in Delaware, Ohio, and enrolled in 1836 at the Methodist Norwalk Seminary in Norwalk, Ohio. He did well at Norwalk, {{and the following}} year transferred to The Webb School, a preparatory school in Middletown, Connecticut, where he studied Latin and Ancient Greek. Returning to Ohio, he attended Kenyon College in Gambier in 1838. He <b>enjoyed</b> <b>his</b> time at Kenyon, and was successful scholastically; while there, he joined several student societies and became interested in Whig politics. He graduated with highest honors in 1842 and addressed the class as its valedictorian.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to his Shakespearean commitments, Hordern joined the St Pancras People's Theatre, a London-based company partly funded by the theatrical manager Lilian Baylis. Hordern <b>enjoyed</b> <b>his</b> time there, despite the tiresome commute between Sussex and London, and stayed with the company for five years. By the end of 1936 {{he had left his}} sales job in Beaconsfield to pursue a full-time acting career. He moved into a small flat at Marble Arch and became one of the many jobbing actors eager {{to make a name for}} themselves on the London stage.|$|E
5|$|On November 10, 1948, Shadrick {{left for}} basic combat {{training}} at Fort Knox, Kentucky. As he was 17 years old, Shadrick {{had to convince}} his parents to sign papers allowing him to enlist. Shadrick completed this training in February 1949, and sailed for Japan to join the 34th Infantry Regiment, 24th Infantry Division, for post–World War II occupation duties. Shadrick spent a year on Kyushu island with the division. According to his family, Shadrick <b>enjoyed</b> <b>his</b> tour in Japan at first, but by June 1950 he was growing tired of the country, and indicated in letters he was feeling depressed.|$|E

He was treated hospitably, but also witnessed the ill-treatment of slaves. Seward was persuaded to return to New York by his family, and did so in June 1819. As it was too late for him to graduate with his class, he studied law at an attorney's office in Goshen before returning to Union College, securing his degree with highest honors in June 1820.|$|E
5|$|Tristano {{first met}} saxophonist Charlie Parker in 1947. They played {{together}} in bands that included bebop musicians Dizzy Gillespie and Max Roach {{later that year}} for radio broadcasts. The pianist reported that Parker <b>enjoyed</b> <b>his</b> playing, {{in part because it}} was different from what Parker was accustomed to and did not copy the saxophonist's style. In 1948 Tristano played less often in clubs, and added Konitz and a drummer to his regular band, making it into a quintet. This band recorded the first sides for the New Jazz label, which later became Prestige Records. Later that year Warne Marsh, another saxophonist student of Tristano's, was added to the group.|$|E
5|$|Unlike most amateurs of the time, Seamer prioritised {{defensive}} {{play when}} batting; {{he watched the}} ball and minimised the risks, valuing his own wicket. This careful style was exemplified by his innings in the University match of 1934, when he helped Oxford salvage a draw by batting for two hours with the tail, during which time he scored 24 runs. Despite his circumspect batting technique, Seamer <b>enjoyed</b> <b>his</b> cricket, and in a more relaxed setting he once scored a century before lunch: playing in the Sudan, the match started at {{seven in the morning}} to avoid the worst of the heat. Before their opponent's innings, Seamer and his team-mates got them drunk to improve their chances of a win.|$|E
