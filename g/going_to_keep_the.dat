Gary Hall, stated that the Charleston church shooting was the catalyst for the planned removal, saying [...] "It {{seemed to me that}} we couldn't, with credibility, address the race agenda if we were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> windows in there." [...] In 2017, however, the windows remained in place. On September 6, 2017, workmen were removing them.|$|E
2500|$|Holland and Smith {{wanted the}} {{character}} to be feisty and emotionally strong. They {{had been introduced}} to the young actress Susan Tully when they attended an open evening at the Anna Scher Theatre School [...] in North London. They were extremely impressed with her [...] "natural and unaffected" [...] acting abilities and felt she displayed hidden depths of emotion. Despite their interest, both Holland and Smith were hesitant about casting {{her because she was}} already widely known for playing the student Suzanne Ross in the children's television show Grange Hill. Nevertheless, she was asked to audition for the role of Michelle and was informed of the intention to make the character a pregnant schoolgirl. Tully liked the story and liked the fact that the character was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> baby, but what interested her most was the opportunity to allow the character to grow up on screen, something she was unable to do with her Grange Hill character. Although Julia Smith initially feared that Tully was too well-known to play the part, they eventually decided to use this fact to their advantage. Tully had a huge following from Grange Hill, and they felt that those fans would be likely to tune in to EastEnders, so she was offered the part.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the fourth}} Test of their five-Test {{series against the}} West Indies in 1966, England were 3–0 down and had lost the series. Needing someone {{to come in to}} {{revitalise}} the squad, the England selectors turned to the successful Yorkshire captain, Brian Close. Close knew why he had been selected, and also why many of his men had been. At the pre-match dinner he said, [...] "I shouldn't be here if we hadn't made such a mess of the series. What's more, neither would a few of you. You are here because you are all fighters, and we are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> pressure on and keep it on for five days." [...] What Close did was to engender a battling spirit for the final Test Match. So, when England were 166 for 7 in reply to the West Indies' 268 all out, they did not give up. Instead, centuries from Tom Graveney and John Murray, and half-centuries from Ken Higgs and John Snow, saw England to a score of 527. The highlight of the match was when West Indian captain Gary Sobers, who had a batting average in the series of well over 100, came in to bat at 137 for 5 with his side still 122runs from making England bat again. Close knew that Sobers was a fine hooker, and he knew how he wanted to approach him, so he asked Snow to bowl a bouncer first up. Everything went to plan: Sobers hooked, edged the ball into his body, and it rebounded to Close at his customary short leg position, close to the batsman, ready to take the catch – or a full blow to the body had Sobers middled it. Sobers c. Close, b. Snow 0 off one ball. England {{went on to win the}} game by an innings and 34 runs.|$|E

60|$|This plan delighted the boys, {{and they}} all {{pronounced}} in its favor; but the oldest one suggested {{that it would be}} better to fasten the ropes to the trunk before they began to saw upon it, and another boy asked how they were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> tree standing when they hauled her up again.|$|E

60|$|Of course, I {{meant to}} take the train for Camelot. Train! Why, the station was as vacant as a cavern. I moved on. The journey to Camelot was a {{repetition}} of what I had already seen. The Monday and the Tuesday differed in no way from the Sunday. I arrived far in the night. From being the best electric-lighted town in the kingdom and the most like a recumbent sun of anything you ever saw, it was become simply a blot--a blot upon darkness--that is to say, it was darker and solider {{than the rest of}} the darkness, and so you could see it a little better; it made me feel as if maybe it was symbolical--a sort of sign that the Church was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> upper hand now, and snuff out all my beautiful civilization just like that. I found no life stirring in the somber streets. I groped my way with a heavy heart. The vast castle loomed black upon the hilltop, not a spark visible about it. The drawbridge was down, the great gate stood wide, I entered without challenge, my own heels making the only sound I heard--and it was sepulchral enough, in those huge vacant courts.|$|E
6000|$|The {{struggle}} for naval supremacy {{is not merely}} a struggle in shipbuilding and expenditure. Much more is it a struggle in knowledge and invention. It is not the Power that has the most ships or the biggest ships that is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> win in a naval conflict. It is the Power that thinks quickest of what to do, is most resourceful and inventive. Eighty Dreadnoughts manned by dull men are only eighty targets for a quicker adversary. Well, {{is there any reason to}} suppose that our Navy is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> above <b>the</b> general national level in these things? Is the Navy bright? ...|$|R
2500|$|In November 2004 it was {{announced}} that Lou Pearlman was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> on with <b>the</b> 'Natural idea' at least in name.

6000|$|I {{could never}} induce Miss Grant {{to carry back}} an answer. [...] "No," [...] she would say, when I persisted, [...] "I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> big feet out of the platter." [...] This was the more hard to bear, as I was aware she saw my little friend {{many times in the}} week, and carried her my news {{whenever}} (as she said) I [...] "had behaved myself." [...] At last she treated me to what she called an indulgence, and I thought rather more of a banter. She was certainly a strong, almost a violent friend, to all she liked; chief among whom was a certain frail old gentlewoman, very blind, and very witty, who dwelt in the top of a tall land on a strait close, with a nest of linnets in a cage, and thronged all day with visitors. Miss Grant was very fond to carry me there and put me to entertain her friend with the narrative of my misfortunes; and Miss Tibbie Ramsay (that was her name) was particular kind, and told me a great deal that was worth knowledge of old folks and past affairs in Scotland. I should say that from her chamber window, and not three feet away, such is the straitness of that close, it was possible to look into a barred loophole lighting the stairway of the opposite house.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am a man}} who {{has written}} much of love," [...] he continued, [...] "of love and life and all the tangled skein of {{emotions}} which make of it a complex thing. And yet so few of us know what love is, so few of us know what companionship is, so few of us know the world in which those others dwell. You have looked at me with your great eyes, Julia, and at first you saw nothing but a fat, plain old man, with plenty of conceit and a humour for idle speeches. And today you think a little differently, and as the days go on you will think more differently still, for I am going to take you with me, Julia, and I am going to keep you with me, and I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> light in your eyes and the laughter at your lips, in the only way that counts. You will sit with me in my study, you shall see my work come and hear it grow. I shall take you into the world where the music is born, and your eyes will be closed there, and you will only know that there is another soul there who is your guide, and in whom you trust, and for whom you have a strange feeling. That is how love comes, Julia--the only sort of love which lasts. It isn't born in this land, it doesn't even flourish in this universe. If you don't come up in the clouds to find it, it isn't the sort that lasts. You are going to find it with me, dear." ...|$|E
6000|$|Then {{there came}} to them a loud voice calling to them from the hall. 'Are any of you coming to church, or are you <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> {{carriage}} waiting all day?' Of course they {{were all going to}} church. They always did go to church when they were at Caversham; and would more especially do so to-day, because of the bishop and because of the bonnets. They trooped down into the hall and into the carriage, Lady Pomona leading the way. Georgiana stalked along, passing her father at the front door without condescending to look at him. Not a word was spoken on the way to church, or on the way home. During the service Mr Longestaffe stood up {{in the corner of his}} pew, and repeated the responses in a loud voice. In performing this duty he had been an example to the parish all his life. The three ladies knelt on their hassocks in the most becoming fashion, and sat during the sermon without the slightest sign either of weariness or of attention. They did not collect the meaning of any one combination of sentences. It was nothing to them whether the bishop had or had not a meaning. Endurance of that kind was their strength. Had the bishop preached for forty-five minutes instead of half an hour they would not have complained. It was the same kind of endurance which enabled Georgiana to go on from year to year waiting for a husband of the proper sort. She could put up with any amount of tedium if only the fair chance of obtaining ultimate relief were not denied to her. But to be kept at Caversham all the summer would be as bad as hearing a bishop preach for ever! After the service they came back to lunch, and that meal also was eaten in silence. When it was over the head of the family put himself into the dining-room arm-chair, evidently meaning to be left alone there. In that case he would have meditated upon his troubles till he went to sleep, and would have thus got through the afternoon with comfort. But this was denied to him. The two daughters remained steadfast while the things were being removed; and Lady Pomona, though she made one attempt to leave the room, returned when she found that her daughters would not follow her. Georgiana had told her sister that she meant to 'have it out' with her father, and Sophia had of course remained in the room in obedience to her sister's behest. When the last tray had been taken out, Georgiana began. 'Papa, don't you think you could settle now when we are to go back to town? Of course we want to know about engagements and all that. There is Lady Monogram's party on Wednesday. We promised to be there ever so long ago.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then I'll {{tell you}} what I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do about it," [...] {{retorted}} Bartley. [...] "I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> leave it. I've done my last day's work on that paper. Do you think," [...] he cried, angrily, [...] "that I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> on in <b>the</b> dark, and let you consult your pleasure as to my future? No, sir! You don't know your man quite, Mr. Gaylord!" ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1932 Lieut. Colonel Moore-Brabazon said in {{a debate}} in the House of Commons about the Road Fund: [...] "This vote is {{different}} from any other because the money that goes to the Ministry of Transport is motorists' money. It is not Imperial taxation. It is money that comes from the motorists, to be spent on one definite thing, namely, the roads. If the Government {{come to the conclusion that}} they are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> spend less money on the roads, they have to make a case to the motorists why they are not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> reduce the taxation upon their cars.
