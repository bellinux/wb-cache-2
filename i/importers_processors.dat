A recent series of domestic and international food safety crises have elevated the importance of meat safety among Japanese consumers. The Japanese government and food industry are implementing new policies and systems intended to assure consumers that the food supply is safe and wholesome. Given that these systems tend to focus heavily on consumer assurance programs and traceability, this paper examines the demand for such programs from the perspective of Japanese meat <b>importers,</b> <b>processors,</b> and retailers. The paper discusses Japan 2 ̆ 7 s recent history of food safety crises, some of the consumer assurance programs already in use in retail outlets, the potential demand for assurance programs for imported products, and the ability of U.

40|$|This is the authors’ accepted, {{refereed}} {{and final}} manuscript to the articleThe {{purpose of this}} paper is to look at how relationships between buyers and sellers are affected when on the supply side the most important resource is available only through a trading system created from a market perspective, whereas on the customer side the interaction resembles a network where relationships are long-term and complex. The empirical setting of the study is the pelagic industry, where this situation represents a challenge for the Norwegian herring exporters as they try to bridge these two types of interactions. In this industry, the purchasing of the herring is subject to a blind auction by law. At the same time, Norwegian exporters have customers in European seafood markets characterised by long-term relationships and close cooperation between <b>importers,</b> <b>processors,</b> producers and retailers. To analyse this situation, the study applies a qualitative research design including personal interviews with selected respondents in Norway and the three largest Norwegian herring export markets: Germany, Poland and Russia. The authors find that the interaction in these particular supplier–customer relationships is not extended to its full potential. It seems that the market-type transactions create “spillover-effects” to the other relationships, meaning that it is difficult to maintain high-involvement relationships when interaction in connected relationships is limited. 1, Forfatterversjo...|$|E
40|$|The {{presence}} of multiple sources of uncertainty complicates hedging decisions. One {{of these is}} the output price and its correlation with input prices. The other is how far forward a firm covers its positions. This study analyzes hedging strategies for grain <b>importers</b> as <b>processors.</b> The analytical model addresses questions of the hedge horizon and accounts for the correlation between input and output prices and exchange rate risk. A theoretical model was developed explicitly modeling the operations of a grain importing firm. The concept of strategic demand for hedging was developed {{in the context of an}} analytical model, representing the adjustment in hedge ratios in relation to the hedge horizon and input-output price correlations. Results indicated that the hedging demand diminishes as the time horizon increases, that input-output price correlations have an important impact on hedging, as does the exchange rate. The model also illustrated the impact of price controls and/or output contracting on risk exposure and the demand for hedging. price risk uncertainty, hedging, grain, importers, International Relations/Trade, Risk and Uncertainty,...|$|R

In Italy, there is Comieco, which is the National Consortium for Recovery and Recycling of cellulosic-based packaging. The main aim of Comieco’s is recycling and recovery of packaging of cellulosic origin. The members of the Consortium Comieco are manufacturers, <b>importers</b> and <b>processors</b> of materials and board packaging. In 2014, each Italian has collected on the average slightly less than 52 kg of paper and cardboard. The performance of citizens on the Center and in the Northern Italy are quite similar since several years, with a per capita collection of around 63 kg per capita per year. People in Southern Italy collect lesser quantity of paper and cardboard, with an average value of 29. 9 kg/capita/year during 2014. In 2007, in Southern Italy, in order to join, support and reward those Municipalities that had reached excellent results in the collection of paper and cardboard, Comieco founded the Club “EcoChampions Municipalities in paper and cardboard (‘Comuni EcoCampioni in carta e cartone’, in Italian).

40|$|Abstract Groundnut is an {{important}} cash crop for domestic markets {{as well as for}} foreign trade in several developing and developed countries. It {{is also one of the}} most valuable cash crops in eastern Ethiopia. However, its production is constrained by Aspergillus species, which cause quantitative losses and produce highly toxic and carcinogenic chemical substances known as aflatoxins. This article critically reviews Aflatoxin Contamination in Groundnut (Arachis hypogaea L.) in Ethiopia and Its Management. Although groundnut has a huge potential as a cash crop to improve livelihoods of farmers and traders in various parts of Ethiopia, its market is declining and export of the crop has come to a standstill. This is due to aflatoxin contamination of the crop and the difficulty of meeting tolerance limits by <b>importers</b> and food <b>processors,</b> leading to rejection of the crop and reduction in market demand. Aflatoxin contamination is both a pre-harvest and postharvest problem. Therefore, management of aflatoxin contamination of groundnut in Ethiopia is very important using cultural practice such as habitat management, soil amendments and pre- and post-harvest managements, using physical control methods, using biological control methods, using resistance groundnut varieties and using chemical control methods...|$|R
40|$|The {{continued}} {{high prices}} for vanilla {{on the world}} market have led various countries to establish or revive vanilla production. Madagascar, the world s leading producer of vanilla (Vanilla fragrans), {{has not been able to}} contain the sky-rocketing prices, since the government liberalised the sector in 1995 and abolished fixed price levels. Now producers are in danger of losing part of their market share to competitor countries. At present, the country produces around 1, 200 MT of cured vanilla annually, while the total worldwide output of cured vanilla is around 2, 200 MT. Curing is a six-month process, during which the green vanilla beans are first exposed alternately to moist and dry heat for 20 days, after which the beans are slowly dried to enhance and bring out their well-known flavour in the familiar form of a vanilla stick. Vanilla fragrans is regarded to yield the best or Bourbon quality, which is preferred for foodstuffs, like ice, cakes, chocolate and drinks. Vanilla tahitensis (South Pacific), V. java (Indonesia) and V. pompona (West Indies), yield vanillas that are used for flavouring tobacco, soaps, perfumes and medicines. The average price for green vanilla in 2001 has been around 20 /kg, which in 2000 was 13 /kg and in 1999 only 4 /kg. Prices for cured vanilla amount to approximately t 160 /kg for 2002, so eight times more than green beans fetch. The steep price increase is also driving <b>importers</b> and <b>processors</b> to look for alternatives, both for the product as for the producers. Bioprocessing methods have been developed to harvest more fragrance per unit of cured vanilla and synthetic vanilla is being mixed with, or replacing natural vanilla. Nothing beats the real thing, though, and importers are actively looking for new producers. India and China have taken up vanilla production, but their first vanilla will not reach the market before 2003. Small wonder that last season vanilla growers in Tonga were surprised by eight visiting vanilla buyers, offering 22. 50 per green kilo. Tonga produces between 35 t and 40 t of bourbon vanilla annually.

Moroccan organic exports of fruits and vegetables are growing sharply. Yet, the exported quantity is still limited. The late establishment of national standards, the lack of public support, the absence of local market and the inadequate marketing structure are the main hindrances of organic production development in the Kingdom. The aim {{of this study is to}} identify the opportunities and constraints facing the organic production and marketing, to provide an understanding of the limitations of the existing production system and exports’ strategies, and to suggest how these limitations can be overcome and marketing process of organic horticultural products can be improved. This study was based upon a survey conducted in Morocco and Europe. Interviews were drawn from the whole spectrum of those involved in the production, marketing and assistance of Moroccan organic horticultural products: producers, exporters, <b>processors,</b> <b>importers,</b> public and private institutions. Results show that the sector avails of great potential in terms of production adequacy and diversity, which provides stakeholders various opportunities in the coming years. Yet, there exists a series of weaknesses, which limit the producers’ ability to take full advantage from these potentialities. Public institutions are still far from fully supporting the organic sector, whilst, farmers’ associations and NGO’s are making many efforts for the sector development. Results have allowed to set up the main actions that should be undertaken for the promotion of the sector, the responsibility of the involved actors, and the 'actions’ time scale feasibilit...|$|R
40|$|In the {{increasing}} organic market in Europe, {{more and more}} of the organic food is sold via big retail chains. This development implies that an increasing trade with organic food takes place over long distances and across borders in Europe. Therefore, the control of organic products through the food chain “from farm to fork” has become increasingly important, because the organic inspection and certification system is the only guarantee to the consumer that the organic food products they buy really are organic. At the European level quite a lot of research has been done on various aspects of organic farming and marketing of organic food products, but little is known about the organic certification system at EU level as regards efficiency, costs and size of the organic certification sector. As an outcome of the CERTCOST project, baseline information on the actors in the organic certification sector has been made available in the www. organicrules. org database for the study year 2008. The database contains statistic information, contact details and other relevant information on the actors involved in the organic certification chain (competent authorities, accreditation bodies, control authorities, control bodies, standards owners and authorities managing certification subsidies), and it covers 16 EU countries, 2 associated countries and an EU candidate country. This study intends to shed some light on the European certification sector with respect to the fees for control (inspection and certification) of organic operators (as far as they are publicly available) and to make an estimate of the size of the certification sector in the EU and two other European countries (Switzerland and Turkey) in staff full time years and costs. Data on publicly available fees for organic control plus public certification support measures influencing the actual control costs were collected by the CERTCOST partners from 19 European countries, for the certification database, www. organicrules. org. Afterwards a more detailed survey was carried out in 7 study countries (the Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom, Switzerland and Turkey) by means of detailed questionnaires, which were particularly aimed at the 4 types of actors involved in organic control (competent authorities, accreditation bodies, control authorities / control bodies and standards owners). The questionnaires were designed for collection of data for several tasks in the CERTCOST project, but relevant for this study were questions concerning control fees, hours spent on control and other costs related to the control (travel costs, overhead etc.). The questionnaire for the control bodies also contained questions concerning control fees for 3 farm cases and 2 processor cases in order to get comparable data on control fees and time spent on the control for different control bodies and countries. Besides, all actors were asked for information on the number of staff employed by them, measured in full time years, and the hours in a full time year for their organisation for estimation of the organic certification sector size. Transparency and the possibility to compare control fees of different control bodies within countries as well as between countries are important for the organic operators (farmers, <b>processors,</b> <b>importers</b> etc.) and stakeholders, and it is particularly relevant in countries where there are many control bodies to choose among, as for example in Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom and Turkey. It seems obvious that all control bodies offering their services to the organic operators should have a publicly available price list on their web site, as also stated in the requirements of ISO 65 (EN 45011), according to which all approved control bodies are accredited. However, the percentage of control bodies in the 7 study countries, which did have public price lists on their web site, varied from 67...|$|R
