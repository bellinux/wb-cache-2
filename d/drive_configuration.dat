5|$|However, {{the initial}} {{popularity}} of the PowerBook100 did not last. Sales decreased, and by December 1991 the 140 and 170 models had become more popular because customers {{were willing to pay}} more for a built-in floppy disk drive and second serial port, which the PowerBook100 lacked. By August 10, 1992, Apple quietly dropped the PowerBook100 from its price list but continued to sell existing stock through its own dealers and alternative discount consumer-oriented stores such as Price Club. In these stores, a 4MB RAM/40MB hard <b>drive</b> <b>configuration</b> with a floppy drive sold for less than $1,000 (more than $1,500 less than the similar 2MB/20MB configuration's original list price).|$|E

25|$|The company {{faced the}} choice of {{building}} right-hand drive models from scratch, or performing a post-production conversion exercise. Given the cost of new body molds, tooling, {{and a host of}} specific parts that a factory-built right-hand <b>drive</b> <b>configuration</b> would require, the company opted to investigate the idea of a post-production conversion using a company based in Hampshire called Wooler-Hodec Ltd.|$|E

25|$|Powertrain {{options for}} the Camry XV40 {{comprised}} both four- and six-cylinder engines with manual and automatic transmissions. The entry-level engine was a 2.4-liter 2AZ-FE four-cylinder in front-wheel <b>drive</b> <b>configuration</b> available with manual and automatic transmissions, both five-speed units. For the Japanese market only, an all-wheel drive variant of the 2.4-liter engine was available, although a four-speed automatic was the sole transmission fitted. All other XV40 series Camrys utilize front-wheel drive. XV40s produced in the United States from January 2009 saw the 2.4-liter 2AZ-FE powerplant replaced by the 2.5-liter 2AR-FE engine and with it bringing new six-speed manual and automatic transmissions. In some markets, the top-level powertrain combination was a 3.5-liter 2GR-FE V6 engine paired exclusively to a six-speed automatic.|$|E
25|$|The new Fronte was a {{big step}} away from the SS20, making the switch from a rear-engined, rear-wheel <b>drive</b> <b>configuration</b> to a more {{up-to-date}} transversely mounted engine in front, driving the front wheels. Wheelbase was increased from 2030 to 2150mm and the new car was much more spacious. The four-door Fronte had an opening rear glass window, whereas the two-door Alto got a proper rear hatch. In some export markets the car was just known as the Suzuki SS40. In Europe, the Fronte (labelled Alto) was also sold with a 796cc four-stroke three (SS80) from July 1981 and was 100mm longer, thanks to bigger bumpers. These cars also received larger 12-inch wheels. Four-doors received the SS80F chassis code, while three-door passenger versions were called SS80G.|$|E
25|$|For the North American market, Camrys were {{produced}} in Georgetown, Kentucky by Toyota Motor Manufacturing Kentucky. Introduced in 1991 as a 1992 model year, automatic transmission {{became the only}} option on all but the base and sport model Camrys, whereas previously, a manual transmission was available on the majority of trim levels. In addition to the DX and LE trims, 1992 saw the addition of an XLE luxury trim and the SE sport trim. The SE model differs from the LE and XLE in appearance {{with the addition of}} a standard V6 engine, alloy wheels, a rear spoiler, and black side mirrors as well as the sports suspension from the Lexus ES 300. The range-topping XLE was equipped with leather upholstery along with an electric sunroof and power adjustable driver's seat. The station wagon body styles were offered in a new seven-seat guise, compared to five in the regular wagon and sedan. These station wagon body variants were also made in right-hand <b>drive</b> <b>configuration</b> for export to Japan, badged as Scepter. Wagons were also produced in Australia. This generation of Camry was featured on Car and Driver magazine's Ten Best list for 1992 and 1993.|$|E

500|$|Before commencing {{production}} of the Aurion, Toyota Australia manufactured the full-size Avalon model at its Altona plant in Melbourne until June 2005. Production of the Avalon had begun in 2000, taking much of its basic design and mechanical features from the then six-year-old Avalon model sold in North America. The Avalon was offered as a larger, more upmarket car than the Toyota Camry, which it was built alongside. The original sales predictions were not met, with the Avalon failing to challenge rivals such as the Holden Commodore and the Ford Falcon. The reasoning behind this has been widely attributed to the Avalon's older design and styling, which has been widely described as [...] "bland", {{as well as the}} front-wheel <b>drive</b> <b>configuration</b> and smaller engine displacement. In its best year, the Avalon only managed to reach half of Toyota's projected sales target, with many potential buyers opting for the slightly smaller sized V6 Camry, featuring the same engine as the Avalon.|$|E
2500|$|The 86 was {{designed}} around a front-mounted boxer engine, rear-wheel <b>drive</b> <b>configuration,</b> {{inspired by the}} AE86. The flat architecture of the boxer engine allows it to be mounted low, dropping {{the center of gravity}} down, resulting in sporty handling characteristics. The exterior design of the 86 delivers a slippery [...] and was inspired by the Toyota 2000GT's low-to-the-ground profile and long, sleek hood. Its design cues translate onto the 86 in such areas as: upward trailing edge of the doors; the upward finish to the side-window line; the front and rear haunches; the circular taillights set in silver (singular instead of double as on the 2000GT).|$|E
2500|$|A {{number of}} futuristic ideas were {{explored}} by AMC. But the automaker lacked adequate resources to build components from scratch {{and needed to}} use outside suppliers or adapt its existing parts and use its production facilities. Unique for a comparatively small car, the Pacer was as wide as a full-size American car of the era. American Motors did not describe it as [...] "cab forward," [...] but the Pacer's layout included wheels pushed to the corners (short overhangs), a relatively wide body, and A-pillars moved forward; the windshield was placed over part of the engine compartment. Contrary to myth, The Pacer was not widened six inches (152.4mm) {{to make room for}} the rear-wheel <b>drive</b> <b>configuration.</b> The editor of Road & Track asserted that front-wheel drive, as well as a transverse mid-engined configuration, were among [...] "various mechanical layouts... tossed around by the idea people at AMC," [...] adding that [...] "it's unlikely they ever had much hope of being able to produce anything other than their traditional front engine and rear drive, using components already in production." ...|$|E
