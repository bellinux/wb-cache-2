Cambodia recently joined {{a long list of}} countries outlawing commercial surrogacy because it can exploit women who 2 ̆ 7 ve nothing to sell but the use of their bodies.

"Ah! bravely <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> all," [...] {{continued}} Beatriz de Bobadilla, with sparkling eyes, and {{a feeling}} of exultation that caused her to overlook the quiet rebuke of her mistress; [...] "and worthy was it of a princess of the royal house of Castile! 'The Infantas of Castile,' you said, 'could not be disposed of, in marriage, without the consent of the nobles of the realm;' and with that fit reply they were glad to be content." ...|$|R

When the pair walked to where Lamar Howard was sitting, Tom Verner slapped the young man's cap onto the floor. James asked him, [...] "What <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>'em</b> down at Athens?" [...] To which he replied he knew nothing to <b>tell</b> <b>them.</b> They started to attack him.

'You {{go and do}} your duty, sir,' said Mr Slyme, angrily, 'and {{borrow money}} for {{travelling}} expenses; and whoever you borrow it of, let 'em know that I possess a haughty spirit, and a proud spirit, and have infernally finely-touched chords in my nature, which won't brook patronage. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> hear? <b>Tell</b> <b>'em</b> I hate 'em, and that that's the way I preserve my self-respect; and <b>tell</b> <b>'em</b> that no man ever respected himself more than I do!' ...|$|R

You might give me their address." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's not {{the sort}} of thing to tell 'em," [...] remarked Henry, as, with his napkin over his arm, he leant against one of the pillars of the verandah, and sipped the glass of Burgundy I had poured out for him; [...] "and they wouldn't believe it if <b>you</b> <b>did</b> <b>tell</b> <b>'em,</b> not one of 'em.

6000|$|... "Right, my friend," [...] he said. [...] "Quite right! Better he {{not know}} as yet. Perhaps {{he will never}} know. I pray so, but if it be needed, then he shall know all. And, my good friend John, let me caution you. You deal with the madmen. All men are mad {{in some way or}} the other, and inasmuch as you deal discreetly with your madmen, so deal with God's madmen too, the rest of the world. <b>You</b> <b>tell</b> not your madmen what <b>you</b> <b>do</b> nor why <b>you</b> <b>do</b> it. <b>You</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> not what <b>you</b> think. So you shall keep {{knowledge}} in its place, where it may rest, where it may gather its kind around it and breed. You and I shall keep as yet what we know here, and here." [...] He touched me on the heart and on the forehead, and then touched himself the same way. [...] "I have for myself thoughts at the present. Later I shall unfold to you." ...|$|R

Your sister will {{understand}} why, {{if no one else}} <b>does.</b> But <b>you</b> will <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> from me, I am sure, that it was, as they intended, a comfort to us. Your sister knows too much of us for me to suppose that our great poverty can be secret from her. And, as far as I am concerned, I do not now much care who knows it." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "The first strong memory I have of Nick was at {{the second}} or third session for Five Leaves Left. Richard Hewson, a well known arranger, and a fifteen piece {{orchestra}} had been brought in to arrange Nick's songs. Nick started getting hotter and hotter under the collar. He was very young and he had struck me as a person you could push about - some people in a recording session will <b>do</b> whatever <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> - but he was getting quietly more and more aggravated, and in the end he dug his heels in and dismissed the arrangements. He said he'd get this friend at Cambridge, Robert Kirby, he thought would be much more sympathetic to what he was doing. Robert had never before done anything in his life in a recording studio. But two weeks later we booked him together with a bunch of musicians - a smaller bunch than the first time, I remember... We were flabbergasted. He was so good."

6000|$|Now, {{though this}} was {{exceeding}} kind in her, yet, as my old good woman said to her, unless she resolved to keep me for good and all, she would do the little gentlewoman more harm than good. 'Well,' says the lady, 'that's true; and therefore I'll only take her home for a week, then, that I may see how my daughters and she agree together, and how I like her temper, and then I'll <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> more; and in the meantime, if anybody comes to see her {{as they used to}} <b>do,</b> <b>you</b> may only <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>you</b> have sent her out to my house.' ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{radio program}} was {{sponsored}} by Allen Gellman, president of Elgin American, maker of watch cases and compacts, during its first {{two and a half}} seasons. Later, seasons of the television show (as well as the radio show, after January 1950) were sponsored by Chrysler, with advertisements for DeSoto automobiles incorporated into the opening credits and the show itself. Each show would end with Groucho sticking his head {{through a hole in the}} DeSoto logo and saying, [...] "Friends...go in to see your DeSoto-Plymouth dealer tomorrow. And when <b>you</b> <b>do,</b> <b>tell</b> <b>'em</b> Groucho sent you." [...] Still later sponsors included The Toni Company (Prom Home Permanent, White Rain Shampoo) with commercials featuring Harpo and Chico, Lever Brothers (Lux Liquid, Wisk Detergent), Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Geritol), and Lorillard Tobacco Co. (Old Gold cigarettes).|$|R
2500|$|Act Two begins {{six months}} later, and still {{there is no}} sign of Drood. There is much {{speculation}} as to his fate. Meanwhile, it is revealed that Puffer has been investigating Drood's disappearance, but has also noticed a rather seedy looking figure who seems to be doing the same. It turns out that this man (played by the same actor who plays Drood, normally), Dick Datchery, is a private investigator. They sing [...] "Settling Up The Score". The cast appears and summarizes the situation, warning the audience, [...] "don't fall back on your assumptions, hasty presumptions might <b>do</b> <b>you</b> in!", <b>telling</b> <b>them</b> to think carefully of who they will vote for as the murderer, in the song [...] "Don't Quit While You're Ahead". As the song climbs to a climax, the actors trail off, and the Chairman announces to the audience that it was at this place that Charles Dickens laid down his pen forever. [...] However, they, with the audience's help, will resolve the story and the public voting begins as to who Datchery and The Murderer are; unfortunately, the actress playing Drood and, up to that point, Datchery is not chosen as Datchery and exits the theater in a huff. [...] Once the votes have been tabulated, the cast come out and sing [...] "Don't Quit While You're Ahead" [...] to welcome the audience back into the story and to remind them that the mystery has not been solved.|$|R
6000|$|Never did toast {{apparently}} conduce {{so little}} {{to the health of}} the subject. Unprepared as Clara was for such a declaration, it was to her as if she had been publicly denounced as the supplanter of her brother. She became deadly white, and sat bolt upright, stiff and motionless, barely stifling a scream, and her eyes fixed between command and entreaty on her cousin without seeing, far less acknowledging, the bows levelled at her. Louis, alarmed by her looks, saw that no time was to be lost; and rising hastily before any one was ready, perilled his fame for eloquence by rapidly assuring the gentlemen and ladies that Miss Dynevor was truly sensible of the kindness of their welcome, and their manner of receiving the toast. Then pushing back his chair, with 'never mind,' to Mrs. Smithers and her scent-bottle, he was at the back of Clara's chair almost before her confused eyes had missed him in her gasps for breath, and impulse to do something desperate; and so she might, if his voice had not been in her ear, his hand grasping hers, both to console and raise her. 'Clara, come, take care.' She obeyed, but trembling so much that he was obliged to support her. Others would have risen in alarm, but he silenced them by signs, and entreaties that no one would frighten her grandmother. There was a large glass door standing open under the Gothic window, and through it he led her out upon a wide green lawn. She drew her breath in sobs, but could not speak. Louis asked her to untie her bonnet, and touched the string, which was merely a streamer. This brought a kind of laugh, but she unfastened the bonnet herself, and the first use she made of her breath was fiercely to exclaim--'How could <b>you!</b> Why <b>did</b> <b>you</b> not <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> I never will--' ...|$|R
