5|$|According to many observers, {{including}} Ray Ferraro {{and teammates}} Brendan Gallagher and Connor McDavid, Tanev {{was perhaps the}} best defenceman in the tournament <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> defensive play - he and his defence partner, Morgan Rielly, {{were not on the}} ice for a single goal against at even-strength. Tanev also played a major role on Canada’s tournament-best penalty kill that allowed just two goals against in 29 opportunities. He registered one assist during the tournament.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} has been popular <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> appearance. Nick Levine of media reporting website Digital Spy claimed {{in a section}} aimed specifically at gay readers, that Declan (played by Sorensen at the time) {{was one of the}} main reasons to tune into Neighbours after its move in the UK to Five. Levine was commenting on the character's appearance and favoured the character different occasions branding him as 'something nice to look at' and has commented that he is a 'fittie'.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 2012, Keef {{was the subject of}} a bidding war with many labels to sign him, {{including}} Young Jeezy's CTE World. While 2013 proved to be a relatively quiet year, <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> music output, Keef began the year by signing with Interscope Records, as a separate deal promised his own label imprint, Glory Boyz Entertainment (GBE). The deal was worth $6,000,000 over a three album layout, as well as an additional $440,000 in advance, to establish GBE. The deal also set up rights for Interscope to pull out of the contract in the case that Keef's debut album failed to sell 250,000 copies by December 2013. Chief Keef's debut studio album Finally Rich, was released on December 18, 2012. Featured guests on the album included rappers 50 Cent, Wiz Khalifa, Young Jeezy, Rick Ross and his fellow Glory Boyz member Lil Reese.|$|E

5|$|Stephen was a well {{established}} figure in Anglo-Norman society by 1135. He was extremely wealthy, well-mannered and liked by his peers; {{he was also}} considered a man capable of firm action. Chroniclers recorded that despite his wealth and power he was a modest and easy-going leader, happy to sit with his men and servants, casually laughing and eating with them. He was very pious, both <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> observance of religious rituals and his personal generosity to the church. Stephen also had a personal Augustinian confessor appointed {{to him by the}} Archbishop of Canterbury, who implemented a penitential regime for him, and Stephen encouraged the new order of Cistercians to form abbeys on his estates, winning him additional allies within the church.|$|E
5|$|Tom Savini {{agreed to}} return to make-up duties for The Final Chapter because he felt he {{should be the one}} to bring Jason full circle <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> look from child to man. Savini used his design from the {{original}} Friday the 13th, with the same practice of application as before, but molded from Ted White's face. Since Jason is not the actual killer in A New Beginning, it was not necessary to do any major designing for Jason's look. Only a head mask to cover the top and back of the head, like the one Brooker wore while wearing the hockey mask, was needed for the film. Make-up artist Louis Lazzara, who cites A New Beginning as almost a direct sequel to The Final Chapter, did base his head-mask on Tom Savini's design for The Final Chapter.|$|E
5|$|Following the Invincibles tour, Lindwall {{found the}} pitches in South Africa in 1949–50 less to his liking and was dropped {{for the final}} Test. He {{returned}} in the following season against England, regularly taking wickets in another series win. The following year, he played a major part in stopping the much vaunted West Indian batsmen, but he was criticised for his prolific use of short-pitched bowling. In 1952, Lindwall played in the Lancashire League in England, where he developed his inswinger. He returned to 1953 with an aging national team in decline and despite {{the loss of the}} Ashes, commentators felt that Lindwall was at his zenith <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> bowling craft. Upon returning to Australia, Lindwall moved north to Queensland due to work commitments and then suffered a season of injury and illness in 1954–55 which saw him perform poorly as England retained the Ashes easily. After a strong performance in the Caribbean, Lindwall missed half of the 1956 English tour with injury and was otherwise ineffective as Australia lost its third consecutive Ashes series. During the return trip to Australia, Lindwall captained Australia for the only time in a Test match against India in Mumbai, after injuries forced out regular captain Ian Johnson. Following the repeated defeats to England, the Australian selectors instituted generational change and gambled on a radical youth policy which saw Lindwall dropped for the 1957–58 tour of South Africa. Lindwall forced his way back into the Test team at 37 years of age in the following season, breaking Clarrie Grimmett's Australian Test record of 216 wickets. He retired from Test cricket after the tour of the Indian subcontinent in the following season, with a total of 228 Test wickets. In retirement, Lindwall mentored Test world-record holder Dennis Lillee and also served as a national selector.|$|E

25|$|In 1902 Webern began {{attending}} {{classes at}} Vienna University. There he studied musicology with Guido Adler, writing his thesis on the Choralis Constantinus of Heinrich Isaac.

25|$|As with Dennis Brookes, it is {{impossible}} to evaluate Brian Reynolds' contribution to Northamptonshire solely <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> performances for the first team.

25|$|For {{the most}} part, the Reformed {{tradition}} did not modify the medieval {{consensus on the}} doctrine of God. God's character is described primarily using three adjectives: eternal, infinite, and unchangeable. Reformed theologians such as Shirley Guthrie have proposed that rather than conceiving of God <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> attributes and freedom to do as he pleases, the doctrine of God is {{to be based on}} God's work in history and his freedom to live with and empower people.|$|E

25|$|Savage was a right-arm off-break bowler who, unusually for his time, {{which was}} an era of {{increasingly}} defensive bowling, flighted the ball rather than bowling flat, and a right-handed tail-end batsman. In his first game for Leicestershire in 1953 he hit 31 and 8 not out, and therefore averaged 39.00 with the bat at that point: {{it proved to be}} a very false dawn <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> batting ability, as he only once surpassed that 31 and his highest score in 17 years was only 33.|$|E

He was to make six or seven trips to the US, where he alienated {{a number of people}} with his brash and impudent demands for money.
