Suspected of supporting parliamentarians against William I, the Crown Prince and his wife were subjected to harsh criticism. The trip that the couple made to the Mediterranean in October 1862 aboard Queen Victoria's yacht served as a pretext for conservatives to accuse Frederick of abandoning his father in a time of great political tension. They also emphasised the fact that the Crown Prince traveled aboard a <b>foreign</b> <b>vessel</b> escorted by an English warship.|$|E

2500|$|It was in {{the northeastern}} North Atlantic that the Basques {{witnessed}} {{the loss of their}} near monopoly on the trade beginning in the early 17th century. Their men were recruited for English (1611), Dutch (1613), northern French (1613), and Danish (1617) whaling expeditions to Spitsbergen, where they hunted the bowhead whale. The first was caught on 12 June 1611 (Old-Style) by one of the six Basque whalemen recruited from the town of Saint-Jean-de-Luz. When the merchants of San Sebastian learned of this new whaling ground they were eager to expand their operations to that distant corner of the Arctic. The next year, 1612, they dispatched a single ship under the command of Juan de Erauso and piloted by the Englishman Nicholas Woodcock, a former employee of the Muscovy Company of London who had made two prior voyages to Spitsbergen (1610–11). Upon reaching Spitsbergen they discovered such an abundance of whales [...] "that for a stretch of sixty leagues along the coast the sea was obscured." [...] The Englishman Thomas Edge, master of the Sea Horse (180 tons), one of the two ships sent by the Muscovy Company to Spitsbergen, spoke with Woodcock while surveying the coast in a pinnace, reporting that the Basque ship had [...] "made a full Voyage in Green-harbour", or Grønfjorden, {{on the south side of}} Isfjorden. On his return Woodcock spent sixteen months in the Gatehouse and Tower for leading a <b>foreign</b> <b>vessel</b> into an [...] "English preserve". The expedition returned to Spain [...] "with [...] glowing reports of the wealth of the fishery" [...] that a patent was secured from the Viceroy of Navarre, Don Alonso de Idiáquez, conde de Aramayona. Its report led others to send out a fleet of whaleships to Spitsbergen in 1613, including the ports of Holland, northern France, and the Basque provinces. San Sebastian sent out a dozen ships (one of them being the ship Woodcock had piloted the previous year), while Saint-Jean-de-Luz sent out three or four.|$|E

The regularly recurring feasts and saints' days, the half-yearly courier from San Diego, the rare transport ship and rarer <b>foreign</b> <b>vessel,</b> were the mere details of his patriarchal life. If there was no achievement, there was certainly no failure. Abundant harvests and patient industry amply supplied the wants of Presidio and Mission. Isolated from the family of nations, the wars which shook the world concerned them not so much as the last earthquake; the struggle that emancipated their sister colonies {{on the other side of}} the continent to them had no suggestiveness. In short, it was that glorious Indian summer of California history around which so much poetical haze still lingers--that bland, indolent autumn of Spanish rule, so soon to be followed by the wintry storms of Mexican independence and the reviving spring of American conquest.|$|E
60|$|At this time, and, indeed, {{throughout}} its existence, the great lucrative monopoly of the Republic was the salt {{manufactured in the}} lagoons, and forced into every market, at rates that no other salt could compete with. Wherever alien enterprise attempted rivalry, it was instantly discouraged by Venice. There were troublesome salt mines, for example, in Croatia; and in 1381 the Republic caused them to be closed by paying the King of Hungary an annual pension of seven thousand crowns of gold. The exact income of the State, however, from the monopoly of salt, or from the various imposts and duties levied upon merchandise, it is now difficult to know, and {{it is impossible to}} compute accurately the value or extent of Venetian commerce at any one time. It reached the acme of its prosperity under Tommaso Mocenigo, who was Doge from 1414 to 1423. There were then three thousand and three hundred vessels of the mercantile marine, giving employment to thirty-three thousand seamen, and netting to their owners a profit of forty per cent, on the capital invested. How great has been the decline of this trade may be understood from the fact that in 1863 it amounted, according to the careful statistics of the Chamber of Commerce, to only $60,229,740, and that the number of vessels now owned in Venice is one hundred and fifty. As the total tonnage of these is but 26,000, it may be inferred that they are small craft, and in fact they are nearly all coasting vessels. They no longer bring to Venice the drugs and spices and silks of Samarcand, or carry her own rare manufactures to the ports of western Europe; but they sail to and from her canals with humble freights of grain, lumber, and hemp. Almost as many Greek as Venetian ships now visit the old queen, who once levied a tax upon every <b>foreign</b> <b>vessel</b> in her Adriatic; and the shipping from the cities of the kingdom of Italy exceeds hers by ninety sail, while the tonnage of Great Britain is vastly greater. Her commerce has not only wasted to the shadow of its former magnitude, but it has also almost entirely lost its distinctive character. Glass of Murano is still exported to a value of about two millions of dollars annually; but in this industry, as in nearly all others of the lagoons, there is an annual decline. The trade of the port falls off from one to three millions of dollars yearly, and the manufacturing interests of the province have dwindled in the same proportion. So far as silk is concerned, there has been an immediate cause for the decrease in the disease which has afflicted the cocoons for several years past. Wine and oil are at present articles of import solely,--the former because of a malady of the grape, the latter because of negligent cultivation of the olive.|$|E

that the deponent resolved at break of day to [...] come up the companion-way, where the negro Babo was, being the [...] ringleader, and Atufal, who assisted him, and having spoken to [...] them, exhorted them to cease committing such atrocities, asking [...] them, at the same time, what they wanted and intended to do, [...] offering, himself, to obey their commands; that notwithstanding [...] this, they threw, in his presence, three men, alive and tied, [...] overboard; that they told the deponent to come up, and that they [...] would not kill him; which having done, the negro Babo asked him [...] whether there were in those seas any negro countries where they [...] might be carried, and he answered them, No; that the negro Babo [...] afterwards told him to carry them to Senegal, or to the [...] neighboring islands of St. Nicholas; and he answered, that this [...] was impossible, on account of the great distance, the necessity [...] involved of rounding Cape Horn, the bad condition of the vessel, [...] the want of provisions, sails, and water; but that the negro Babo [...] replied to him he must carry them in any way; that they would do [...] and conform themselves to everything the deponent should require [...] as to eating and drinking; that after a long conference, being [...] absolutely compelled to please them, for they threatened to kill [...] all the whites if they were not, at all events, carried to [...] Senegal, he told them that what was most wanting for the voyage [...] was water; that they would go near the coast to take it, and [...] thence they would proceed on their course; that the negro Babo [...] agreed to it; and the deponent steered towards the intermediate [...] ports, hoping to meet some Spanish, or <b>foreign</b> <b>vessel</b> that would [...] save them; that within ten or eleven days they saw the land, and [...] continued their course by it in the vicinity of Nasca; that the [...] deponent observed that the negroes were now restless and mutinous, [...] because he did not effect the taking in of water, the negro Babo [...] having required, with threats, that it should be done, without [...] fail, the following day; he told him he saw plainly that the coast [...] was steep, and the rivers designated in the maps were not to be [...] found, with other reasons suitable to the circumstances; that the [...] best way would be to go to the island of Santa Maria, where they [...] might water easily, it being a solitary island, as the foreigners [...] did; that the deponent did not go to Pisco, that was near, nor [...] make any other port of the coast, because the negro Babo had [...] intimated to him several times, that he would kill all the whites [...] the very moment he should perceive any city, town, or settlement [...] of any kind on the shores to which they should be carried: that [...] having determined to go to the island of Santa Maria, as the [...] deponent had planned, for the purpose of trying whether, on the [...] passage or near the island itself, they could find any vessel that [...] should favor them, or whether he could escape from it in a boat to [...] the neighboring coast of Arruco, to adopt the necessary means he [...] immediately changed his course, steering for the island; that the [...] negroes Babo and Atufal held daily conferences, in which they [...] discussed what was necessary for their design of returning to [...] Senegal, whether they were to kill all the Spaniards, and [...] particularly the deponent; that eight days after parting from the [...] coast of Nasca, the deponent being on the watch a little after [...] day-break, and soon after the negroes had their meeting, the negro [...] Babo came to the place where the deponent was, and told him that [...] he had determined to kill his master, Don Alexandro Aranda, both [...] because he and his companions could not otherwise be sure of their [...] liberty, and that to keep the seamen in subjection, he wanted to [...] prepare a warning of what road they should be made to take did [...] they or any of them oppose him; and that, by means of the death of [...] Don Alexandro, that warning would best be given; but, that what [...] this last meant, the deponent did not at the time comprehend, nor [...] could not, further than that the death of Don Alexandro was [...] intended; and moreover the negro Babo proposed to the deponent to [...] call the mate Raneds, who was sleeping in the cabin, before the [...] thing was done, for fear, as the deponent understood it, that the [...] mate, who was a good navigator, should be killed with Don [...] Alexandro and the rest; that the deponent, who was the friend, [...] from youth, of Don Alexandro, prayed and conjured, but all was [...] useless; for the negro Babo answered him that the thing could not [...] be prevented, and that all the Spaniards risked their death if [...] they should attempt to frustrate his will in this matter, or any [...] other; that, in this conflict, the deponent called the mate, [...] Raneds, who was forced to go apart, and immediately the negro Babo [...] commanded the Ashantee Martinqui and the Ashantee Lecbe to go and [...] commit the murder; that those two went down with hatchets to the [...] berth of Don Alexandro; that, yet half alive and mangled, they [...] dragged him on deck; {{that they were going to}} throw him overboard [...] in that state, but the negro Babo stopped them, bidding the murder [...] be completed on the deck before him, which was done, when, by his [...] orders, the body was carried below, forward; that nothing more was [...] seen of it by the deponent for three days; * * * that Don Alonzo [...] Sidonia, an old man, long resident at Valparaiso, and lately [...] appointed to a civil office in Peru, whither he had taken passage, [...] was at the time sleeping in the berth opposite Don Alexandro's; [...] that awakening at his cries, surprised by them, and at the sight [...] of the negroes with their bloody hatchets in their hands, he threw [...] himself into the sea through a window which was near him, and was [...] drowned, without it being in the power of the deponent to assist [...] or take him up; * * * that a short time after killing Aranda, they [...] brought upon deck his german-cousin, of middle-age, Don Francisco [...] Masa, of Mendoza, and the young Don Joaquin, Marques de [...] Aramboalaza, then lately from Spain, with his Spanish servant [...] Ponce, and the three young clerks of Aranda, José Mozairi Lorenzo [...] Bargas, and Hermenegildo Gandix, all of Cadiz; that Don Joaquin [...] and Hermenegildo Gandix, the negro Babo, for purposes hereafter to [...] appear, preserved alive; but Don Francisco Masa, José Mozairi, and [...] Lorenzo Bargas, with Ponce the servant, beside the boatswain, Juan [...] Robles, the boatswain's mates, Manuel Viscaya and Roderigo Hurta, [...] and four of the sailors, the negro Babo ordered to be thrown alive [...] into the sea, although they made no resistance, nor begged for [...] anything else but mercy; that the boatswain, Juan Robles, who knew [...] how to swim, kept the longest above water, making acts of [...] contrition, and, in the last words he uttered, charged this [...] deponent to cause mass to be said for his soul to our Lady of [...] Succor: * * * that, during the three days which followed, the [...] deponent, uncertain what fate had befallen the remains of Don [...] Alexandro, frequently asked the negro Babo where they were, and, [...] if still on board, whether they were to be preserved for interment [...] ashore, entreating him so to order it; that the negro Babo [...] answered nothing till the fourth day, when at sunrise, the [...] deponent coming on deck, the negro Babo showed him a skeleton, [...] which had been substituted for the ship's proper figure-head--the [...] image of Christopher Colon, the discoverer of the New World; that [...] the negro Babo asked him whose skeleton that was, and whether, [...] from its whiteness, he should not think it a white's; that, upon [...] discovering his face, the negro Babo, coming close, said words to [...] this effect: [...] "Keep faith with the blacks from here to Senegal, or [...] you shall in spirit, as now in body, follow your leader," [...] pointing [...] to the prow; * * * that the same morning the negro Babo took by [...] succession each Spaniard forward, and asked him whose skeleton [...] that was, and whether, from its whiteness, he should not think it [...] a white's; that each Spaniard covered his face; that then to each [...] the negro Babo repeated the words in the first place said to the [...] deponent; * * * that they (the Spaniards), being then assembled [...] aft, the negro Babo harangued them, saying that he had now done [...] all; that the deponent (as navigator for the negroes) might pursue [...] his course, warning him and all of them that they should, soul and [...] body, go the way of Don Alexandro, if he saw them (the Spaniards) [...] speak, or plot anything against them (the negroes)--a threat which [...] was repeated every day; that, before the events last mentioned, [...] they had tied the cook to throw him overboard, for it is not known [...] what thing they heard him speak, but finally the negro Babo [...] spared his life, at the request of the deponent; that a few days [...] after, the deponent, endeavoring not to omit any means to preserve [...] the lives of the remaining whites, spoke to the negroes peace and [...] tranquillity, and agreed to draw up a paper, signed by the [...] deponent and the sailors who could write, as also by the negro [...] Babo, for himself and all the blacks, in which the deponent [...] obliged himself to carry them to Senegal, and they not to kill any [...] more, and he formally to make over to them the ship, with the [...] cargo, with which they were for that time satisfied and quieted. * [...] * But the next day, the more surely to guard against the sailors' [...] escape, the negro Babo commanded all the boats to be destroyed but [...] the long-boat, which was unseaworthy, and another, a cutter in [...] good condition, which knowing it would yet be wanted for towing [...] the water casks, he had it lowered down into the hold.|$|E
