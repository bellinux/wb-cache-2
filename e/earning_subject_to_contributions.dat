30|$|The {{design of}} the Polish system {{involves}} a cap on contributions. System participants pay contributions based on standard rules but only to a level corresponding to 30 times the average wage in the economy.

2500|$|Beginning in April 1989, {{the rankings}} were changed {{to be based}} on the average points per event played instead of simply total points <b>earned,</b> <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> a minimum divisor of 60 (20 events per year). This was in order to more {{accurately}} reflect the status of some (particularly older) players, who played in far fewer events than their younger contemporaries but demonstrated in major championships that their ranking was artificially low. Tom Watson, for example, finished in the top 15 of eight major championships between 1987 and 1989, yet had a [...] "total points" [...] ranking of just 40th; his ranking became a more realistic 20th when based on [...] "average points". A new system for determining the [...] "weight" [...] of each tournament was also introduced, based on the strength of the tournament's field in terms of their pre-tournament world rankings. Major championships were guaranteed to remain at 50 points for the winners, and all other events could attain a maximum of 40 points for the winner if all of the world's top 100 were present.

40|$|Much {{work on the}} {{apparent}} ineffectiveness on incumbent spending in congressional elections has hypothesized that the productivity of incumbent spending is low because incumbents operate on the “flat part” of their election returns function. Differences in campaign spending associated with state campaign finance laws allows for a test of this hypothesis because restrictions on campaign <b>contributions</b> tend <b>to</b> reduce campaign spending. Exploiting cross-state variation in campaign finance laws, this study tests whether campaign expenditures by state House candidates are more productive when candidates are <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> <b>contribution</b> limits. The results show that campaign expenditures by incumbents and challengers are more productive when candidates run in states with campaign contribution limits, as opposed to in states without limits. In states with contribution limits, incumbent spending and challenger spending are equally productive, and spending by both candidates is quantitatively important in increasing their vote shares.
