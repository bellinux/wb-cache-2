One method for doing this was the construction of ice houses to hold the product, typically either shortly after the ice was first harvested or at regional depots after it had been shipped out. Early ice houses were relatively small, but later storage facilities were the size of large warehouses and contained much larger quantities of ice.|$|E

25|$|It was {{originally}} planned to withdraw these final two locomotives on 31 December 2004. However, all {{did not go}} to plan, as the replacement Class 90 locomotives did not prove to be as reliable as hoped. Therefore, two locomotives were reprieved until at least March 2005. A final twist saw no. 86232 repaired, replacing no. 86246, which had again suffered from a serious failure. A third locomotive, no. 86234, was also repaired and briefly returned to traffic in April 2005, but was later stored again after failing. The last two locomotives (nos. 86232/235) saw occasional use, when not enough Class 90 locomotives were available. By mid-2005, no. 86232 was out of use and no. 86235 was operational but not used. The <b>final</b> <b>use</b> of the class came on 17 September 2005, when no. 86235 was used on several Norwich-London return trips to mark its retirement from service. This has brought an end to 40 years of Class 86-hauled passenger trains.|$|E

500|$|One shot {{created by}} Shade VFX {{is when the}} {{audience}} sees Matt Murdock's [...] "vision" [...] – {{the way that he}} [...] "sees" [...] using his other heightened senses. On why this was only used once in the season, DeKnight explained that it had in fact been budgeted to appear several more times, with the effect actually completed at least twice more for the season. It was removed for several reasons, including to avoid taking away the specialty of it, and to maintain the crime drama tone of the series. One instance where it would have been used again was in [...] "Stick", where the audience would have seen how Murdock saw Stick as he threw keys at him, and then when he is older and Stick throws fighting sticks at him and his senses are more refined. In that case, the effect was not finished on time. Another instance was in [...] "The Ones We Leave Behind" [...] when Murdock comes across a Chinese worker and realizes that he has been blinded. The <b>final</b> <b>use</b> of the effect {{was going to be in}} [...] "Daredevil" [...] when the camera pushes in on Page's reaction Murdock telling her that they can work together. Here, the effect was hiding all of the nuances in her expression, so it was decided that it would be better to remove it.|$|E
500|$|As a tree grows, {{only the}} {{outermost}} tree ring exchanges carbon with its environment, so the age measured for a wood sample {{depends on where}} the sample is taken from. [...] This means that radiocarbon dates on wood samples can be older than the date at which the tree was felled. [...] In addition, if {{a piece of wood}} is used for multiple purposes, there may be a significant delay between the felling of the tree and the <b>final</b> <b>use</b> in the context in which it is found. [...] This {{is often referred to as}} the [...] "old wood" [...] problem. [...] One example is the Bronze Age trackway at Withy Bed Copse, in England; the trackway was built from wood that had clearly been worked for other purposes before being re-used in the trackway. [...] Another example is driftwood, which may be used as construction material. [...] It is not always possible to recognize re-use. [...] Other materials can present the same problem: for example, bitumen is known to have been used by some Neolithic communities to waterproof baskets; the bitumen's radiocarbon age will be greater than is measurable by the laboratory, regardless of the actual age of the context, so testing the basket material will give a misleading age if care is not taken. [...] A separate issue, related to re-use, is that of lengthy use, or delayed deposition. [...] For example, a wooden object that remains in use for a lengthy period will have an apparent age greater than the actual age of the context in which it is deposited.|$|E

2500|$|Unfortunately, {{however, the}} case for a coregency between Osorkon I and Shoshenq II is {{uncertain}} because there is no clear evidence that the Year 3 and Year 33 bandages on Naktefmut's body were made at the same time. These two dates were not written on a single piece of mummy linen—which would denote a true coregency. [...] Rather, the dates were written on two separate and unconnected mummy bandages which were likely woven and used {{over a period of several}} years, as the burial practices of the Amun priests show. A prime example is the Mummy of Khonsmaakheru in Hamburg which contains separate bandages dating to Years 11, 12, and 23 of Osorkon I—or a minimum period of 12 Years between their creation and <b>final</b> <b>use.</b> (Altenmüller: 2000) A second example is the mummy of Djedptahiufankh, the Third or Fourth Prophet of Amun, which bears various bandages from Years 5, 10, and 11 of Shoshenq I, or a spread of six years in their <b>final</b> <b>use</b> for embalming purposes. As these two near contemporary examples show, the temple priests simply reused whatever old or recycled linens which they could gain access to for their mummification rituals. The Year 3 mummy linen would, hence, belong to the reign of Osorkon's successor. [...] Secondly, none of the High Priest Shoshenq C's own children—the priest Osorkon whose funerary papyrus, P. Denon C, is located in the Russian National Library in St. Petersburg or a second priest named Harsiese (likely king Harsiese A) who dedicated a Bes statue in memory of his father, now in Durham Museum—give royal titles to their father on their own funerary objects. The priest Osorkon only calls himself the [...] "son of the High Priest Shoshenq", rather than the title [...] "King's Son" [...] in his funerary papyri, which would presumably have been created long after his father's death.|$|E

2500|$|The {{power plant}} {{consisted}} of Scotch marine boilers providing steam at 150 psi (10.34 bar) to Parsons turbines. [...] Steam first drove a high-pressure turbine, which turned a propeller shaft with a 57inch (1,448mm) screw {{at up to}} 700 revolutions per minute. [...] Exhaust steam from the centre turbine drove two low-pressure turbines, one on either side, turning wing shafts each with two 40inch (1,016mm) screws, at up to 1,000 rpm. [...] (In 1905, the fore propellers {{were removed from the}} outboard shafts, which actually improved performance.) [...] The drives were ungeared, and the speeds of the turbines were the speeds of the [...] shafts. [...] After <b>final</b> <b>use</b> in the lower-pressure outboard turbines, the steam, now expanded 125-fold, exhausted into condensers. Astern turbines operated on the two wing shafts, with the central shaft idling when the ship was backing. The aim was for a speed of 20 knots (37km/h), outpacing other Clyde steamers while providing economy in fuel, rather than the high speeds of the navy vessels. The propulsion system differed from that of the lightly built destroyers, which operated under higher steam pressure and drove four propeller shafts. Denny gave the new ship the yard number 651.|$|E
60|$|Nor {{will ever}} future American Patriots and Unionists, indifferently {{over the whole}} land, or North or South, find a better moral to their lesson.

Then there is a cement to the whole people, subtler, more underlying, than any thing in written constitution, or courts or armies--namely, the cement of a death identified thoroughly with that people, at its head, and for its sake. Strange, (is it not?) that battles, martyrs, agonies, blood, even assassination, should so condense--perhaps only really, lastingly condense--a Nationality.|$|E
6000|$|It is an {{innocent}} and healthful employment of the mind, distracting one from too continual study of himself, and leading him to dwell rather upon the indigestions {{of the elements}} than his own.

6000|$|My visit at Stormfield {{came to an}} {{end with}} tender relucting on his part and on mine. Every morning before I dressed I heard him {{sounding}} my name through the house {{for the fun of it}} and I know for the fondness; and if I looked out of my door, there he was in his long nightgown swaying up and down the corridor, and wagging his great white head like a boy that leaves his bed and comes out in the hope of frolic with some one. The last morning a soft sugarsnow had fallen and was falling, and I drove through it down to the station in the carriage which had been given him by his wife's father when they were first married, and been kept all those intervening years in honorable retirement for this <b>final</b> <b>use.</b> Its springs had not grown yielding with time; it had rather the stiffness and severity of age; but for him it must have swung low like the sweet chariot of the negro [...] "spiritual" [...] which I heard him sing with such fervor, when those wonderful hymns of the slaves began to make their way northward. 'Go Down, Daniel', was one in which I can hear his quavering tenor now. He was a lover of the things he liked, and full of a passion for them which satisfied itself in reading them matchlessly aloud. No one could read 'Uncle Remus' like him; his voice echoed the voices of the negro nurses who told his childhood the wonderful tales. I remember especially his rapture with Mr. Cable's 'Old Creole Days,' and the thrilling force with which he gave the forbidding of the leper's brother when the city's survey ran the course of an avenue through the cottage where the leper lived in hiding: [...] "Strit must not pass!" ...|$|E

Whilst I write, the Turks {{are said to be}} massacring the Armenian Christians on an unprecedented scale; but Europe is {{not in a position to}} remonstrate; for her Christians are slaying one another by every device which civilization has put within their reach as busily as they are slaying the Turks. Barabbas is triumphant everywhere; and the <b>final</b> <b>use</b> he makes of his triumph is to lead us all to suicide with heroic gestures and resounding lies. Now those who, like myself, see the Barabbasque social organization as a failure, and are convinced that the Life Force (or whatever you choose to call it) cannot be finally beaten by any failure, and will even supersede humanity by evolving a higher species if we cannot master the problems raised by the multiplication of our own numbers, have always known that Jesus had a real message, and have felt the fascination of his character and doctrine. Not that we should nowadays dream of claiming any supernatural authority for him, much less the technical authority which attaches to an educated modern philosopher and jurist. But when, having entirely got rid of Salvationist Christianity, and even contracted a prejudice against Jesus on the score of his involuntary connection with it, we engage on a purely scientific study of economics, criminology, and biology, and find that our practical conclusions are virtually those of Jesus, we are distinctly pleased and encouraged to find that we were doing him an injustice, and that the nimbus that surrounds his head in the pictures may be interpreted some day as a light of science rather than a declarations of sentiment or a label of idolatry.|$|E
60|$|At {{the end of}} the {{vacation}} he returned to college, leaving his measure with Halleck's tailor, and his heart with all the splendors and elegances of the town. He found the ceilings very low and the fashions much belated in the village; but he reconciled himself as well as he could. The real stress came when he left college and the question of doing something for himself pressed upon him. He intended to study law, but he must meantime earn his living. It had been his fortune to be left, when very young, not only an orphan, but an extremely pretty child, with an exceptional aptness for study; and he had been better cared for than if his father and mother had lived. He had been not only well housed and fed, and very well dressed, but pitied as an orphan, and petted for his beauty and talent, while he was always taught to think of himself as a poor boy, who was winning his own way through the world. But when his benefactor proposed to educate him for the ministry, with a view to his <b>final</b> <b>use</b> in missionary work, he revolted. He apprenticed himself to the printer of his village, and rapidly picked up a knowledge of the business, so that at nineteen he had laid by some money, and was able to think of going to college. There was a fund in aid of indigent students in the institution to which he turned, and the faculty favored him. He finished his course with great credit to himself and the college, and he was naturally inclined to look upon what had been done for him earlier as an advantage taken of his youthful inexperience. He rebelled against the memory of that tutelage, in spite of which he had accomplished such great things. If he had not squandered his time or fallen into vicious courses in circumstances of so much discouragement, if he had come out of it all self-reliant and independent, he knew whom he had to thank for it. The worst of the matter was that there was some truth in all this.|$|E
