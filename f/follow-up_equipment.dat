40|$|Telemedicine is {{a medical}} {{application}} of advanced technology to disease management. This modality may provide benefits also to patients with {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD). Different devices and systems are used. The legal problems associated with telemedicine are still controversial. Economic advantages for healthcare systems, though potentially high, are still poorly investigated. A European Respiratory Society Task Force has defined indications, <b>follow-up,</b> <b>equipment,</b> facilities, legal and economic issues of tele-monitoring of COPD patients including those undergoing home mechanical ventilation. Key points The costs of care assistance in chronic disease patients are dramatically increasing. Telemedicine may be a very useful application of information and communication technologies in high-quality healthcare services. Many remote health monitoring systems are available, ensuring safety, feasibility, effectiveness, sustainability and flexibility to face different patients’ needs. The legal problems associated with telemedicine are still controversial. National and European Union governments should develop guidelines and ethical, legal, regulatory, technical, administrative standards for remote medicine. The economic advantages, if any, of this new approach must be compared to a “gold standard” of homecare that is very variable among different European countries and within each European country. The efficacy of respiratory disease telemedicine projects is promising (i. e. to tailor therapeutic intervention; to avoid useless hospital and emergency department admissions, and reduce general practitioner and specialist visits; and to involve the patients and their families). Different programmes based on specific and local situations, and on specific diseases and levels of severity {{with a high level of}} flexibility should be utilised. A European Respiratory Society Task Force produced a statement on commonly accepted clinical criteria for indications, <b>follow-up,</b> <b>equipment,</b> facilities, legal and economic issues also of telemonitoring of ventilator-dependent chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients. Much more research is needed before considering telemonitoring a real improvement in the management of these patients. Educational aims To clarify definitions of aspects of telemedicine To describe different tools of telemedicine To provide information on the main clinical results To define recommendations and limitation...|$|E
40|$|The {{estimated}} {{prevalence of}} ventilator-dependent individuals in Europe is 6. 6 per 100   000 people. The increasing number {{and costs of}} these complex patients make present health organisations largely insufficient to face their needs. As a consequence, their burden lays mostly over families. The need to reduce healthcare costs and to increase safety has prompted the development of tele-monitoring for home ventilatory assistance. A European Respiratory Society Task Force produced a literature research based statement on commonly accepted clinical criteria for indications, <b>follow-up,</b> <b>equipment,</b> facilities, legal and economic issues of tele-monitoring of these patients. Many remote health monitoring systems are available, ensuring safety, feasibility, effectiveness, sustainability and flexibility to face different patients' needs. The legal problems associated with tele-monitoring are still controversial. National and European Union (EU) governments should develop guidelines and ethical, legal, regulatory, technical, administrative standards for remote medicine.

50|$|To plastic {{extrusion}} machine, plastic extruder is usually called the host, and its <b>follow-up</b> <b>equipments</b> {{are called the}} plastic auxiliary equipments. With about 100 years of development, plastic extruder derived from single screw to twin-screw, multi screw or no screw and other models. Plastic extruder (the host) can match with the pipe, film, holding materials, monofilament, flat, packing tape, crowded network, plate (sheet) material, profile, granulation, cable coating {{and other kinds of}} plastic molding auxiliary equipment, composed of a variety of {{plastic extrusion}} production lines, to produce various plastic products. Therefore, either now or in the future, plastic extrusion machine are used widely in plastics processing industry.|$|R
40|$|Introduction During your {{stay in the}} hospital, various {{pieces of}} {{equipment}} {{will be given to}} you or ordered for you. Your therapists or nurse will be instructing you in the use, care and repair of this equipment. Also, you will find materials in this section regarding specialized equipment that you may need during your hospital stay and following discharge. There are also reference materials about equipment you may need in the future. If you have any questions about your equipment while in the hospital, contact your therapist, nurse or case manager. As part of your <b>follow-up</b> program, <b>equipment</b> will be reviewed and re-evaluated from time to time. If you have questions about equipment after discharge, contact the SCI Follow-Up Clinic for a nurse clinician who will direct you to the proper source. (57 pages, 1. 08 Mb...|$|R
30|$|In fact, all the {{blackout}} events showed that equipment along the power flow rerouting path during the dynamic process could be tripped by protection relays earlier than UFLS actions. Therefore the cascading development such as successive islanding {{could not possibly}} be interrupted by solely depending on the distributed control measures such as UFLS. Moreover, the emergency control problem should be formulated as that of {{the blackout}} defense mechanism in case of sudden loss of a key power transmission interface which although was a single transmission line in all the above cases. Therefore, the primary control objective should be to prevent cross-grid rerouting of large power flow and the <b>follow-up</b> uncontrolled <b>equipment</b> tripping and system islanding, and automatic generator tripping and load shedding triggered by the event of a sudden loss of transmission corridor is the most effective emergency control measure to prevent similar cascading outages. The economic rationality of deploying this type of emergency control can be analyzed {{from the point of view}} of risk reduction.|$|R
40|$|Unlike {{many other}} countries, where {{the nuclear power}} plants have a finite period of time {{foreseen}} in their operating licence, the authorization in Belgium is delivered without time limitation but on condition of a safety reassessment process at definite intervals of ten years. Important repairs, replacements and modifications (steam generator replacement, seismic re-evaluation and requalification, RCS overpressure protection and process computers) are mainly associated with these 10 -year reviews. Beyond those major changes, the <b>follow-up</b> of <b>equipment</b> is performed on a case-by-case basis. Specific monitoring programmes {{have been developed for}} sensible equipment to cope with new loading or degrading phenomena (erosion-corrosion, intergranular attack stress corrosion, weal; stratification, etc.). The lifetime policy is assessed on a pragmatic case-by-case basis, owing to the variety of plants and circumstances, 'generic' solutions are not often applicable. This Belgian approach is put into perspective by contrasting it to a variety of possible nuclear power plant life definitions...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{demonstrate}} a treatment program that may permit a student-athlete who has a mandible fracture to continue participation in a sport without further jeopardizing his or her health. This article is based on an actual case in which a student-athlete sustained a mandible fracture during an intercollegiate basketball game. Within 24 hours, the injured athlete resumed basketball practice. Three days following the injury, he was permitted to compete in a game. In addition to recommendations regarding acute care, we discuss protective <b>equipment,</b> <b>follow-up</b> guidelines, and nutritional considerations. These guidelines may assist the sports medicine team in determining when an athlete with a mandible fracture can return to competitive and contact sports...|$|R
40|$|Give me a layout {{good enough}} and a {{building}} to place it, and I will install your accelerator". To paraphrase Archimedes, {{this is the}} role attributed to the Integration team in the MedAustron project. Starting with the optics layout and a building sketch, the integration work consists {{of a series of}} activities, interlinked in a complex manner. First the design and the integration of accelerator: list all items, define geometrical envelopes with interfaces, put them in position in CAD, identify conflicts and define input for design of items and of infrastructure. Then the various equipment is procured: verify and validate design data, <b>follow-up</b> manufacturing, fiducialize <b>equipment</b> and build supports. Lastly the global installation: check building and infrastructure, define survey framework, install and pre-align equipment on supports, move assemblies to their final location, survey actual position and adjust to theoretical position. The whole chain of operations from the layout to a real beam in MedAustron, is illustrated. The help from item-driven data management is emphasized. Grouping all the activities within a single team favours interactions between stakeholders and the consistency of activities...|$|R
40|$|Respiratory {{home care}} is an {{important}} aspect of rehabilitation programmes designed for patients needing long-term mechanical ventilation. Many differences have emerged between countries in the long-term care of these patients, depending on the different ways of supplying material, managing patients and providing equipment. The results of analysis of the data obtained in a preliminary survey carried out in 1995 - 1996 among 115 Italian centres operating in the field of home mechanical ventilation are presented. A questionnaire (all closed-circuit items) consisting of two sections (the first epidemiological, and the second methodological and economic) was sent to all centres. Fifty-seven out of 115 (50 %) centres responded to the questionnaire, with a prevalence of responses from the north of Italy (37 centres). The responding centres had been working in this field for a mean period of 6 +/- 3 yrs, and a total of 1, 842 patients were surveyed. The analysis focuses on the prevalence of treated diseases, methods of mechanical ventilation, regulation of prescription, evaluations carried out during <b>follow-up,</b> supply of <b>equipment,</b> costs and reimbursement, and relations with volunteer associations. A more thorough approach to all the problems emerging from this Italian survey regarding candidates for home mechanical ventilation is warranted. A more detailed comparative analysis of indications, management and costs vis-à-vis other countries should contribute towards achieving maximum uniformity of standards throughout Europe...|$|R
