40|$|Besides anti-suit injunctions, {{recent cases}} suggest that {{breaches}} of <b>jurisdiction</b> <b>clauses</b> {{may also be}} remedied by damages. Without distinguishing between types of <b>jurisdiction</b> <b>clauses</b> or the manner of breach, existing analyses appear to assume that these damages must be contractual, by analogy with breaches of arbitration clauses. In relation to breaches of English <b>jurisdiction</b> <b>clauses,</b> this may be inappropriate, given that the basis and effect of English judgments are distinct from those of arbitral awards. Contractual damages for breach of English <b>jurisdiction</b> <b>clauses</b> may thus be difficult to justify. However, tortious damages may arguably be available as an alternative...|$|R

5000|$|First, {{there is}} the (unlikely) risk that the court first seised finds the <b>jurisdiction</b> <b>clause</b> invalid, which {{consequently}} takes away the possibility for the designated court to decide the case, even if the latter would have declared the clause valid. Although the Court in Gasser first seems to minimise the likelihood of this hypothesis by stating that a <b>jurisdiction</b> <b>clause</b> [...] "must be regarded as an independent concept", it nonetheless points out that verifying the existence of <b>jurisdiction</b> <b>clauses</b> [...] "may necessitate delicate and costly investigations". As a result, although unlikely, {{there is still a}} risk that two courts from different Member States will decide upon the validity of a <b>jurisdiction</b> <b>clause</b> differently.|$|R
40|$|This article {{seeks to}} analyse two {{possible}} legal bases on which <b>jurisdiction</b> <b>clauses</b> included in Regional Trade Agreement (RTAs) may be enforced in disputes before the World Trade Organization (WTO), namely, {{the application of}} RTA <b>jurisdiction</b> <b>clauses</b> as applicable law in WTO disputes, and that as WTO tribunals&# 039; inherent powers. It will {{be argued that the}} applicability RTA <b>jurisdiction</b> <b>clauses</b> in WTO disputes is originally a matter of applicable law. However, there are no provisions in WTO law that either fully confirm or entirely eliminate such an application. Thus, the applicability of RTA <b>jurisdiction</b> <b>clauses</b> cannot be decisively verified from the applicable law perspective. In this context, it is natural that whether they can be enforced in WTO disputes largely depends on the discretion and willingness of WTO tribunals to do so. From this understanding, the article then takes into consideration two important factors, namely, inherent powers of WTO tribunals, and the requirements set out in the Dispute Settlement Understanding (DSU) to assess how these factors, as well as the interaction between them may constrain or drive the application of RTA <b>jurisdiction</b> <b>clauses</b> in WTO disputes. It appears that even though equipped with the inherent power to decide their own jurisdiction, WTO tribunals cannot enforce RTA <b>jurisdiction</b> <b>clauses</b> because such enforcement would be inconsistent with the key provisions of the DSU...|$|R

40|$|Coherency in {{international}} litigation and upholding exclusive <b>jurisdiction</b> <b>clauses,</b> {{for the most}} part, work hand in hand. Courts generally take jurisdiction on very wide and exorbitant grounds. There is therefore the ever-present risk of irreconcilable judgments stemming from multiple courts hearing disputes arising from the same transaction or state of affairs. One way in which such a risk is averted is by giving effect to exclusive <b>jurisdiction</b> <b>clauses</b> where parties have included such clauses into their contracts. Thus, when faced with an action brought in breach of an exclusive <b>jurisdiction</b> <b>clause</b> in favour of another forum, the starting position is that the court will stay its proceedings unless the plaintiff is able to show “strong cause” or “strong reasons” why he {{should be allowed to}} breach his promise to sue exclusively in another forum. Another means by which the courts strive to uphold exclusive <b>jurisdiction</b> <b>clauses</b> is by taking a liberal construction of them...|$|R

The Law Commission initially excluded arbitration clauses from the Act, but later amended their draft bill so as to allow third parties to take advantage of arbitration proceedings.

It is argued that the approach of applying the common law principles of contractual interpretation to a bill of lading is questionable. The approach used to apply English private international law is problematic in a number of ways. There are legitimate reasons for concern that the doctrine of comity in English private international law may become undermined as a result...|$|R

40|$|This case-note is {{concerned}} with a recent judgment of the ECJ, {{in which it was}} held that a <b>jurisdiction</b> <b>clause,</b> agreed in the contract concluded between the manufacturer of goods and the buyer thereof, cannot be relied on against a sub-buyer who brings an «action directe » for damages against the manufacturer, unless it is established that that third party has actually consented to that clause under the conditions laid down in Article 23 Regulation Brussels I. The Author, after having examined the legal basis of the «action directe» in the French legal order, critically discusses the preliminary ruling, particularly as regards the denial by the Court to refer to national law in order to assess whether the <b>jurisdiction</b> <b>clause</b> between the manufacturer and the first buyer can extend its effects vis-à-vis the subbuyer...|$|R
