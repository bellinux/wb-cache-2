Central to this methodology is a novel air-based measurement system consisting of charge-coupled device (CCD) cameras and dedicated image-processing software. This prototype measurement system is placed inside the cockpit of an aircraft and is used to take images of the airport landing lighting system whilst the aircraft approaches the airport. Developed image-processing techniques then allow unique luminaire identification and extraction from the hundreds of luminaires within the airport lighting pattern. The corresponding luminous intensity and alignment of each luminaire is derived using dynamic position and orientation information estimated from a visual environment model. By obtaining luminous intensity and alignment information for each luminaire within the pattern, it is then possible to derive its associated <b>isocandela</b> <b>diagram.</b> This then allows an assessment to be made regarding the luminaires ’ conformity to the CAA standards. The unique system has been teste...|$|E
