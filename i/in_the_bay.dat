50|$|Four Santa Rosa-Swift Creek {{sites have}} been {{radiocarbon}} dated. Two sites <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Choctawhatchee <b>Bay</b> area have been dated {{to the period}} 150 to 450, while two sites <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Pensacola <b>Bay</b> area have been dated to the period 350 to 650. The later dates for the Santa Rosa-Swift Creek culture <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Pensacola <b>Bay</b> area seem to indicate a later adoption of the Santa Rosa-Swift Creek culture, as late Deptford ceramics have been dated to 260 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Pensacola <b>Bay</b> area, but only to 150 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Choctawhatchee <b>Bay</b> area.

5|$|There {{is also a}} {{significant}} diversity of salmonids present <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bay.</b> Steelhead populations in California have dramatically declined due to human and natural causes; <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bay</b> Area, all naturally spawned anadromous steelhead populations below natural and manmade impassable barriers in California streams from the Russian River to Aptos Creek, and the drainages of San Francisco, San Pablo, and Suisun Bays are listed as threatened under the Federal Endangered Species Act. The Central California Coast coho salmon population is the most endangered of the many troubled salmon populations {{on the west coast}} of the United States, including populations residing in tributaries to the San Francisco Bay. Industrial, mining, and other uses of mercury have resulted in a widespread distribution of that poisonous metal <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bay,</b> with uptake in the bay's phytoplankton and contamination of its sportfish.|$|E
5|$|While <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bay</b> of Campeche, {{the shrimp}} boat Celestino Arias was sunken by strong waves {{generated}} by Janet after it suffered engine failures. The stranded ship was heavily {{damaged by the}} hurricane's strong winds <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bay,</b> which broke towing lines. All of the ship's crewmen, which had evacuated the boat after it sunk, were later rescued and brought back to Tampa, Florida. Along the coast, tides were reported to be 3–4ft (0.91–1.2m) above average. Farther north along the Texas coast, tides were 2ft (0.61m) above average, blocking beach roads near Corpus Christi.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> Bungus <b>Bay</b> with ​​ 21, 050 {{meters of}} {{coastline}} length and 1, 383. 86 ha of surface area confines with a rounded shape surface. This study aimed to determine coastline changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Bungus <b>Bay</b> based on overlay analyses of satellite imagery of 2000, 2006, 2010, and 2011. <b>The</b> method used <b>in</b> {{this research was}} visual interpretation using four key interpretation such as hue image, texture association, and shape. The results showed that in general there were abrasion processes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Bungus <b>Bay.</b> <b>The</b> abrasion processes were more dominant <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Buo <b>Bay,</b> Kaluang Bay, and Kabuang <b>Bay.</b> <b>The</b> largest coastline changes occurred <b>in</b> <b>the</b> northern Bungus <b>Bay</b> for 26 m/yr, while <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Kaluang <b>Bay</b> and Kabuang Bay exhibited a moderate change of 9 m/yr. <b>In</b> general, <b>the</b> rate of coastline change <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Bungus <b>Bay</b> was 5. 9 m/yr...|$|R
5|$|After Sercey {{returned}} to Île de France his squadron broke up. Four ships were {{sent back to}} France in 1797 and 1798 as Île de France could no longer supply repairs, manpower or provisions in support of Sercey. This dispersal of the squadron was encouraged by the Colonial Assembly of Île de France and Governor Malartic neither of whom were well-disposed to the Directory then ruling France. With his remaining crews becoming rebellious, Sercey sent Forte and Prudente on a commerce raiding operation during the autumn of 1798, during which they achieved some success <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bay</b> of Bengal. By the time this force {{returned to}} Île de France Sercey had sailed to Batavia, leaving instructions for Forte and Prudente to follow him. Malartic countermanded this order, seizing Prudente and selling the frigate to a privateer concern and ordering Forte to operate independently <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bay</b> of Bengal {{in the autumn of}} 1798. Sercey was furious, but could do nothing to alter Malartic's arrangements.|$|E
5|$|Another serious effect {{created by}} the oil-related {{industries}} has been the pollution around the Houston Ship Channel and in Galveston Bay. By the 1970s, these waterways {{were among the most}} polluted waters in the United States. Though industrial sources were major sources of pollution, urbanization around the bay also contributed significantly to pollution levels. In recent decades, most of the pollution <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bay</b> is the result of storm run-off from various smaller commercial, agricultural, and residential sources, as opposed to the major industrial complexes. Conservation efforts in the mid to late 20th century by area industries and municipalities have helped to dramatically improve water quality <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bay</b> reversing {{at least some of the}} earlier damage to the ecosystem.|$|E

In addition, he invested in real estate.

50|$|<b>In</b> 1991, <b>the</b> <b>Bay</b> {{agreed to}} stop {{retailing}} fur {{in response to}} complaints from people opposed to killing animals for this purpose. <b>In</b> 1997, <b>the</b> <b>Bay</b> reopened its fur salons {{to meet the demand}} of consumers.|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} changes in nutrient concentrations on phytoplankton biomass and community composition during 8 field trips performed during different seasons <b>in</b> <b>the</b> southwestern coral lagoon of New Caledonia. The lagoon is characterized by spatial variation in macronutrient concentrations, with locally elevated values <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bays</b> bordering <b>the</b> city of Noumea. Low DIN:DIP (dissolved inorganic nitrogen: dissolved inorganic phosphorus) and elevated Si:DIN ratios suggest that nitrogen is the macronutrient that likely drives phytoplankton community composition. Most of the microphytoplankton groups discriminated by inverted microscopy and the picoplankton groups distinguished by flow cytometry present significant and distinct relationships with inorganic nitrogen concentrations. Picophytoplankton-dominated assemblages are replaced by microphytoplankton-dominated assemblages with increasing DIN concentrations. Within the picophytoplankton, Prochlorococcus abundance dominates <b>in</b> <b>the</b> adjacent oceanic and southern lagoon shelf sites, and assemblages shift to Synechococcus-dominated populations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bays,</b> with an increasing proportion of picoeukaryotic phytoplankton. Within the microplankton, 142 species of microphytoplankton were identified, mainly represented by diatoms, dinoflagellates, and coccolithophorids. Nutrient enrichment <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bays</b> favors large diatoms {{at the expense of}} coccolithophorids and dinoflagellates, which dominate in adjacent oceanic and southern shelf waters. Therefore, although moderate, the elevated nitrogen concentrations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bays</b> result <b>in</b> increased phytoplankton biomass, accompanied by important shifts <b>in</b> <b>the</b> phytoplankton community structure...|$|R
5|$|Bellerophon rendezvoused with Jervis's fleet <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bay</b> of Cadiz on 30 May 1797. Three {{days later}} she was visited for the only time by Horatio Nelson, then a rear-admiral and {{in command of the}} inshore {{squadron}} of the blockading fleet. Bellerophon was with the fleet <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bay</b> of Cadiz until October, when Jervis took it to sea to patrol between Cape Trafalgar and Cape St. Vincent. These duties lasted until late May 1798, when Bellerophon was assigned to a detached squadron under Captain Thomas Troubridge and ordered to rendezvous with and reinforce Nelson's squadron. Nelson was in the Mediterranean hunting for a large French fleet which had sailed from Toulon carrying troops.|$|E
5|$|Continuing {{with her}} patrol, U-43 {{attacked}} Convoy 14-BS <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bay</b> of Biscay, and sank the 4,374 ton French merchant ship Arijon on 22 November. Convoy escorts counter-attacked with 23 depth charges, but U-43 escaped without damage.|$|E
5|$|Emeralds boats {{participated in}} a cutting-out {{expedition}} in Viveiro harbour on 13 March 1808.
