40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was evaluation of the structure in the cross-section of gas-assisted <b>injection</b> <b>moulded</b> parts. The parts investigated were stroller handles made from polypropylene. Design/methodology/approach: Polymer structure was observed in the cross-section using the optical microscope. The microtomed slices cut from the manufactured parts were observed in polarized light. The parts obtained with different <b>injection</b> <b>moulding</b> temperature values were tested. Findings: was found that spherulites size differs in the cross section. A big gradient of spherulites is observed in the area near the skin while the spherulites contacting the gas channel are of similar size - like those in the part centre. Research limitations/implications: The investigation is limited to semi-crystalline polymers, like polypropylene. In case of amorphous polymers spherulitic structure does not occur. Practical implications: The investigation results can contribute to the improvement of the knowledge about gas-assisted <b>injection</b> <b>moulding</b> and can also be helpful in selection of proper <b>injection</b> <b>moulding</b> parameters, in order to obtain good polymer structure in the part.
