40|$|Abstract: The {{solution}} redistribution was {{an important}} phenomenon during the solidification of multi-component alloys. The changing disciplines during solidification of different component Al-Si-Mg alloys were calculated <b>in</b> this paper. <b>The</b> calculations were coupled with CALPHAD technology. The interaction of solutes would change the solute redistribution coefficients during <b>the</b> solidification especially <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> solidification. So <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> solidification, {{the slope of the}} curves turned to bigger and bigger. The results of the calculating of the eutectic fraction of the alloys show that errors exist under assuming the partition coefficients of solutes as a constant due to the interaction between solutes <b>in</b> ternary alloys. <b>The</b> predicted eutectic fractions of Al-Si-Mg alloys agree well with the experimental results for using the CALPHAD methods...|$|R
