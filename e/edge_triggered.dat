By enabling <b>edge</b> <b>triggered</b> interrupts on the encoder B line (called direction line by Lego), it {{is possible}} to have 720 increments per turn instead of 360. This enhancement allows for smoother rotation at low speed and better position control. This hack was not possible on the NXT due to a hardware limitation.

As described under delayed sweeps, a trigger delay circuit (typically the main sweep) extends this delay to a known and adjustable interval. In this way, the operator can examine a particular pulse {{in a long}} train of pulses.|$|R
40|$|In area of {{low power}} VLSI, {{switching}} activity of circuit node {{is of great}} concerned to reduce dynamic power. Dynamic power is directly proportional to switching activity of nodes. Switching activity vary according to input data pattern thereby for different input data sequence different power dissipation can occur. To achieve same data throughput as in single <b>edged</b> <b>triggered</b> flip-flop (SETFF), dual <b>edged</b> <b>triggered</b> flip-flop (DETFF) is {{an effective way to}} decrease power dissipation. DETFF reduces switching activity for same data throughput. In this paper, two different design of DETFF are investigated. The technique used to design DETFF is to generate pulse at every edge of clock to trigger data and/or latch stage of circuit. A conventional and a proposed design of DETFF are surveyed. Proposed DETFF utilized different scheme to generate pulse at every edge of clock. In view of power dissipation there is no considerable improvement but delay has been greatly reduced thereby overall PDP with respect to conventional DETF...|$|R
2500|$|... <b>edge</b> <b>trigger,</b> an edge-detector {{that generates}} a pulse when the input signal crosses a {{specified}} threshold voltage in a specified direction. These are the most-common types of triggers; the level control sets the threshold voltage, and the slope control selects the direction (negative or positive-going). (The first sentence of the description {{also applies to}} the inputs to some digital logic circuits; those inputs have fixed threshold and polarity response.) ...|$|R
50|$|The {{first is}} an IRQ line being {{deasserted}} {{before it is}} acknowledged. This may occur due to noise on the IRQ lines. In <b>edge</b> <b>triggered</b> mode, the noise must maintain {{the line in the}} low state for 100 ns. When the noise diminishes, a pull-up resistor returns the IRQ line to high, thus generating a false interrupt. In level triggered mode, the noise may cause a high signal level on the systems INTR line. If the system sends an acknowledgment request, the 8259 has nothing to resolve and thus sends an IRQ7 in response. This first case will generate spurious IRQ7's.|$|E
50|$|Try {{to reduce}} the amount of <b>edge</b> <b>triggered</b> {{interrupts}}. If interrupts can be triggered only with a level, then this helps to ensure that noise on an interrupt pin will not cause an undesired operation. It must be kept in mind that level-triggered interrupts can lead to repeated interrupts as long as the level stays high. In the implementation, this characteristic must be considered; repeated unwanted interrupts must be disabled in the ISR. If this is not possible, then on immediate entry of an edge-triggered interrupt, a software check on the pin to determine if the level is correct should suffice.|$|E
50|$|Since the ISA bus {{does not}} support level {{triggered}} interrupts, level triggered mode {{may not be used}} for interrupts connected to ISA devices. This means that on PC/XT, PC/AT, and compatible systems the 8259 must be programmed for <b>edge</b> <b>triggered</b> mode. On MCA systems, devices use level triggered interrupts and the interrupt controller is hardwired to always work in level triggered mode. On newer EISA, PCI, and later systems the Edge/Level Control Registers (ELCRs) control the mode per IRQ line, effectively making the mode of the 8259 irrelevant for such systems with ISA buses. The ELCR is programmed by the BIOS at system startup for correct operation.|$|E

Experimental results show that, the new criteria weeds out about 40 % rules while with translation performance improvement, and the new feature brings another improvement to the baseline system, especially on larger corpus. ...|$|R

5000|$|Edge-triggered {{interrupts}} do {{not suffer}} {{the problems that}} level-triggered interrupts have with sharing. Service of a low-priority device can be postponed arbitrarily, and interrupts {{will continue to be}} received from the high-priority devices that are being serviced. If there is a device that the CPU does not know how to service, it may cause a spurious interrupt, or even periodic spurious interrupts, but it does not interfere with the interrupt signalling of the other devices. However, it is fairly easy for an <b>edge</b> <b>triggered</b> interrupt to be missed - for example if interrupts have to be masked for a period - and unless there is some type of hardware latch that records the event it is impossible to recover. Such problems caused many [...] "lockups" [...] in early computer hardware because the processor did not know it was expected to do something. More modern hardware often has one or more interrupt status registers that latch the interrupt requests; well written edge-driven interrupt software often checks such registers to ensure events are not missed.|$|E
50|$|The 8085 has {{extensions}} {{to support}} new interrupts, with three maskable vectored interrupts (RST 7.5, RST 6.5 and RST 5.5), one non-maskable interrupt (TRAP), and one externally serviced interrupt (INTR). Each {{of these five}} interrupts has a separate pin on the processor, a feature which permits simple systems to avoid {{the cost of a}} separate interrupt controller. The RST 7.5 interrupt is <b>edge</b> <b>triggered</b> (latched), while RST 5.5 and 6.5 are level-sensitive. All interrupts are enabled by the EI instruction and disabled by the DI instruction. In addition, the SIM (Set Interrupt Mask) and RIM (Read Interrupt Mask) instructions, the only instructions of the 8085 that are not from the 8080 design, allow each of the three maskable RST interrupts to be individually masked. All three are masked after a normal CPU reset. SIM and RIM also allow the global interrupt mask state and the three independent RST interrupt mask states to be read, the pending-interrupt states of those same three interrupts to be read, the RST 7.5 trigger-latch flip-flop to be reset (cancelling the pending interrupt without servicing it), and serial data to be sent and received via the SOD and SID pins, respectively, all under program control and independently of each other.|$|E
5000|$|... (f) The impulse timer is a D type {{positive}} <b>edge</b> <b>triggered</b> flip flop. Input information {{applied at}} D {{is transferred to}} Q on the occurrence of the positive edge of the clock pulse. thus when the comparator output (e) is positive Q goes positive or remains positive at the next positive clock edge. Similarly, when (e) is negative Q goes negative at the next positive clock edge. Q controls the electronic switch to generate the current impulse into the integrator. Examination of the waveform (e) during the initial period illustrated, when Vin is 0.4 V, shows (e) crossing the threshold well before the trigger edge (positive edge of the clock pulse) {{so that there is}} an appreciable delay before the impulse starts. After the start of the impulse there is further delay while (e) climbs back past the threshold. During this time the comparator output remains high but goes low before the next trigger edge. At that next trigger edge the impulse timer goes low to follow the comparator. Thus the clock determines the duration of the impulse. For the next impulse the threshold is crossed immediately before the trigger edge and so the comparator is only briefly positive. Vin (a) goes to full scale, +Vref, shortly {{before the end of the}} next impulse. For the remainder of that impulse the capacitor current (c) goes to zero and hence the integrator slope briefly goes to zero. Following this impulse the full scale positive current is flowing (c) and the integrator sinks at its maximum rate and so crosses the threshold well before the next trigger edge. At that edge the impulse starts and the Vin current is now matched by the reference current so that the net capacitor current (c) is zero. Then the integration now has zero slope and remains at the negative value it had at the start of the impulse. This has the effect that the impulse current remains switched on because Q is stuck positive because the comparator is stuck positive at every trigger edge. This is consistent with contiguous, butting impulses which is required at full scale input.|$|E
