50|$|The city's {{riverbank}} {{has been}} particularly transformed - from <b>industrial</b> <b>dereliction</b> caused by the decline of shipbuilding into to an entertainment and residential centrepiece. The banks of the Clyde have become a playground for property developers, with office blocks and high-rise luxury flats taking {{the place of the}} old shipyards, granaries, wharves and docks.|$|E
40|$|The City of Glasgow is {{situated}} on {{and around the}} lower floodplain and inner estuary of the River Clyde in the west of Scotland, UK. Glasgow’s urban hinterland once was one of Europe’s leading centres of heavy industry, and of ship building in particular. The industries were originally fed by locally mined coal and ironstone. In common with many European cities, the heavy industries declined and Glasgow was left with a legacy of <b>industrial</b> <b>dereliction,</b> widespread undermining, and extensive vacant and contaminated sites, some the infilled sites of clay pits and sand and gravel workings. ...|$|E
40|$|During the {{industrialization}} process {{early in}} 20 th century {{in most of}} Chinese cities, heavy industries with contamination were initially located in city periphery when they were founded. But nowadays, these industrial areas gradually became part of urban area due to the rapid and large-scale urbanization and city expansion. Since late in the 20 th century, with decline of heavy industries and traditional manufacturing, there has been increasing number of derelict industrial areas with great potentials to be redeveloped and integrated into the city. As for these <b>industrial</b> <b>dereliction,</b> the typical development mode in China is to demolish and then rebuild to maximize the profit of government and developers. However, this development mode may cause many negative gentrification effects and target only on certain groups of people, while the demands from the general public are being neglected. Therefore, it has been becoming an urgent {{need to come up}} with a collection of strategies both on city and local scales to tackle with this issue. The site chosen for the project is the former Capital Steel Complex, known as the Shougang Group, which was the largest and most important steel production complex in Beijing. It has witnessed the history of heavy industry development in China since it was founded in 1919, and enormous contribution to the city development was made by this huge company which has been functioning as the pillar of local economy. Due to city image and environmental concern, the industrial complex has been reducing production until it completely halted in 2010, which indicate the end of a grand age of this steel industrial area, leaving a 8 km 2 <b>industrial</b> <b>dereliction</b> with heritage value and huge potential for redevelopment in a strategic location in western Beijing. The objective is to develop a collection of strategies for redeveloping this site that will balance the preservation of industrial heritage and implementation of new urban functions in a ecological way, and at the same time meet the emerging demands both from city and local perspectives. This will be realized by creating a new centrality in the site identified as the CRD (Cultural & Recreational District) - expectation from government. The approach is culture-led regeneration in this large brownfield, namely, culture will be catalyst for new development and generate new economy related to culture and creative industries. During the regeneration process, the concept of positive gentrification will be introduced to guarantee the benefit of public, promoting social equality in this decaying area in problematic condition left by post-industrialism.

40|$|In {{some way}} {{photography}} seems an improbable medium for examining the future. It {{has long been}} associated rather with acts of remembrance and recollection. The photograph is so often the memento mori, the treasured relic of a lost loved one, of a time past. How then might photographs speak to the conflicted times of a landscape labelled post-industrial or de-industrialised? And how might such photography speak to the conditions of Northern England? Here it seems {{we are looking at}} a time and a place caught ‘in-between’. There is an industrial legacy fading rapidly from sight and living memory; a landscape of <b>industrial</b> despoliation and <b>dereliction</b> that has been rapidly transmuted into a post-industrial consumerist landscape; and yet that consumerist future now seems like a future ruin – with developments and promises teetering on the edge of collapse, traces of what might have been. All this is occurring in a land that labels itself the ‘North’ in contradistinction to the powerful global city of London and the prosperous south and yet, is sandwiched between that and the culturally re-assertive nation of Scotland to its own north. A region whose self-identity is founded on an industrial era, whose prosperity and produce were deeply connected to supplying an empire that no longer exists. Post-industrial and postcolonial northern England, defined as much by its lack and losses as any positive identity. And yet, the celebration of this very condition remains part of a deeply sedimented and felt belonging. How are such conflicted and overlain spatial and temporal coordinates to be pictured...|$|R
40|$|Channel 14 ’ is a video work {{continuing}} my {{collaboration with}} David Bickerstaff. This video is co-authored with equal levels of intellectual, research and creative input. ‘Channel 14 ’ was intentionally devised {{to take a}} number of forms and has been reworked in relation to particular audience and site contexts. It has been shown as a single or double screen projection in conventional gallery spaces and also as a site-specific piece in two major international exhibitions. The first of these was in ’The Invisible City’, the 6 th Manifestation of Internationale Video et Art Electronique, Montreal in 2004. The video focuses on nocturnal representations of the post industrial areas of the River Thames and its gradual <b>industrial</b> <b>dereliction</b> and decay as a trade artery for London. In Montreal we chose to present {{the work in the}} disused city incinerator, its decaying structure matching the video’s subject matter. This juxtaposition initiated an interest for me {{in the way in which}} an artwork specific to one location creates a special set of meanings and experiences when used to contextualize another environment. (see output 3) The second major exhibition was in the Graz Media and Architecture Biennale, Austria in 2005. where it was shortlisted for the biennale prize. Other artists in the biennale included: Olivio Barbieri, David Lamelas, Chris Marker, Anri Sala, and Catherine Yass. Other showings of the work include: The Drawing Room, London as part of a joint exhibition by Wainwright and Bickersaff in 2004 and the Champ Libre compilation selected from all the previous international video manifestations of the last six years and screened at The Old National Library, Montreal in 2006...|$|E
40|$|For {{over two}} decades, Scotland {{has been a}} major {{beneficiary}} of the regional policy of the European Union (EU). By 2006, it is expected that Scotland will have received around £ 7 billion under the Structural Funds since the inception of ERDF in 1975. During the 1990 s, when Structural Fund expenditure in Scotland was at its maximum, some two thirds of the Scottish population were covered by areas eligible for EU regional policy support, averaging over £ 250 million per year. In the current budget planning period (2000 - 2006), Scotland will receive a total of £ 1, 094 million for the various EU-funded programmes now under way. This European funding is now under threat. As the EU prepares for enlargement to take in up to 12 new members over the next decade, plans are being made to redirect Structural Funds to the poorer countries of Central and Eastern Europe. Many of these countries have income levels well below those of the EU Member States, with extensive poverty, underdevelopment and <b>industrial</b> <b>dereliction.</b> Tackling these problems will be the priority for future EU regional policy, with any remaining available Structural Funds going largely to the present less-developed countries of the EU - Greece, Portugal and Spain. Without an increase in EU budgetary resources, it seems unlikely that the richer EU Member States, including the UK, can expect to receive much, or maybe any, funding under EU regional policy, {{after the end of the}} current budgetary period in 2006. The following paper considers the implications of the next reform of EU regional policy for Scotland. It begins by reviewing the political context for enlargement and the economic development challenges, and then reviews the emerging debate on scenarios for reform, identifying the issues for Scotland...|$|E
