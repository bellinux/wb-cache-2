50|$|Operation Distant Plain was {{a series}} of non-nuclear {{explosive}} and <b>detonable</b> gas tests performed on test sites in Alberta, Canada during the course of 1966 and 1967. Their purpose was to provide airblast, cratering and ground shock data in summer and winter conditions for testing new prototype equipment, military targets and coniferous forest blowdown and defoliation. Participants included Canada, United Kingdom, Australia and United States under the Tripartite Technical Cooperation Program. <b>Detonable</b> gas balloons were used in this operation in an attempt to find an economical substitute for TNT {{as well as for the}} fact that they could be placed at desired heights without a heavy support structure or towers. In addition, they were more adaptable to airblast phenomena and produced a well defined blast wave without perturbation or ejecta; they also produced no crater. However, it was found that they lacked the high pressure associated with high explosives, and difficulties were encountered as the 20-ton gas balloon ruptured and another detonated unexpectedly during inflation. Ultimately ANFO was elected as a lower cost alternative to TNT for non-nuclear explosives tests.|$|E
5000|$|Heavy metal azides, such as {{lead azide}} are primary high {{explosives}} <b>detonable</b> when heated or shaken. Heavy-metal azides are formed when solutions of sodium azide or HN3 vapors {{come into contact}} with heavy metals or their salts. Heavy-metal azides can accumulate under certain circumstances, for example, in metal pipelines and on the metal components of diverse equipment (rotary evaporators, freezedrying equipment, cooling traps, water baths, waste pipes), and thus lead to violent explosions.|$|E
50|$|A {{very wide}} variety of fuels may occur as gases, droplet fogs, or dust suspensions. Oxidants include halogens, ozone, {{hydrogen}} peroxide and oxides of nitrogen. Gaseous detonations are often associated {{with a mixture of}} fuel and oxidant in a composition somewhat below conventional flammability ratios. They happen most often in confined systems, but they sometimes occur in large vapor clouds. Other materials, such as acetylene, ozone, and hydrogen peroxide are <b>detonable</b> in the absence of oxygen; a more complete list is given by both Stull and Bretherick.|$|E
50|$|Other {{energetic}} {{materials in the}} vicinity of the pit also influence its safety. US missile propellants come in two general classes. The class 1.3, fire hazard but very difficult to impossible to detonate; an example is 70% ammonium perchlorate, 16% aluminium, and 14% binder. The class 1.1, both fire and detonation hazard, is a double-base propellant based on cross-linked polymer, containing 52% HMX, 18% nitroglycerine, 18% aluminium, 4% ammonium perchlorate, and 8% binder. The 1.1 propellant has 4% higher specific impulse (about 270 s versus 260 s), giving an 8% longer range for constant burning time. The insensitive high explosives are also less powerful, necessitating larger and heavier warheads, which reduces the missile range - or sacrificing some yield. The safety/performance tradeoff is especially important for e.g. submarines. As of 1990, the Trident SLBMs used both <b>detonable</b> fuel and non-insensitive explosives.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the most}} active areas of solid {{propellant}} research is the development of high-energy, minimum-signature propellant using C6H6N6(NO2)6 CL-20 nitroamine (China Lake compound #20), which has 14% higher energy per mass and 20% higher energy density than HMX. The new propellant has been successfully developed and tested in tactical rocket motors. The propellant is non-polluting: acid-free, solid particulates-free, and lead-free. It is also smokeless and has only a faint shock diamond pattern that is visible in the otherwise transparent exhaust. Without the bright flame and dense smoke trail produced by the burning of aluminized propellants, these smokeless propellants all but eliminate the risk of giving away the positions from which the missiles are fired. The new CL-20 propellant is shock-insensitive (hazard class 1.3) as opposed to current HMX smokeless propellants which are highly <b>detonable</b> (hazard class 1.1). CL-20 is considered a major breakthrough in solid rocket propellant technology but has yet to see widespread use because costs remain high.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: A {{thermochemical}} {{model was}} newly {{proposed in the}} present study. The proposed model was developed to maintain an accuracy for detonation simulations with the detailed chemical reaction model under thermally perfect gas condition and to reduce computational load. The proposed model consists of three gas components, which are premixed <b>detonable</b> gas, burnt gas and inert gas. For chemical reactions, it is considered that premixed <b>detonable</b> gas reacts to burnt gas under the one-step irreversible chemical reactions. The thermodynamic data for premixed <b>detonable</b> gas and inert gas follow the enthalpy changes of the mixture as thermally perfect gas, and {{it is assumed that}} the burnt gas is isentropically expanded. In the present study, single-cycle and multiple-cycle operations of one-dimensional and two-dimensional single-tube Pulse Detonation Engine (PDE) were investigated with the proposed model. For one-dimensional simulations of single-tube, single-cycle PDE, advantages of the proposed model compared with some other models were shown using pressure and temperature profiles at the closed and open ends of the tube. Furthermore, two-dimensional simulations of single-tube, multiple-cycle PDE were carried out to investigate the spatial distributions and histories of the thermodynamic properties with the proposed and the detailed models. The spatial distributions and histories of the thermodynamic properties of the proposed model were in good agreement with those of the detailed model. The proposed model dramatically reduced the CPU time required for simulation to about 9 % for one-dimensional analysis and 14 % for two-dimensional analysis...|$|E

40|$|Direct initiations and stabilizations of {{three-dimensional}} conical detonation waves were attained {{by launching}} spheres with 1. 06 – 1. 31 times the C–J velocities into <b>detonable</b> mixtures. We conducted high time-resolution Schlieren visualizations {{of the whole}} processes over unsteady initiations to stable propagations of the stabilized Oblique Detonation Waves (ODWs) using a high-speed camera. The <b>detonable</b> mixtures were stoichiometric oxygen mixtures with acetylene, ethylene or hydrogen. They were diluted with argon in a 50 % volumetric fraction, and a 75 % diluted mixture was also tested for the acetylene/oxygen. The direct initiation of detonation by the projectile and the DDT process like the re-initiation appeared in the initiation process of stabilized ODW. This process {{eventually led to the}} stabilized ODW supported by the projectile velocity and the ringed shape detonation wave originating in the re-initiation. We modeled the spatial evolution of stabilized ODW after the re-initiation based on its C–J velocity and angle. The model qualitatively reproduced the measured development rate of stabilized ODW. We also discussed about the detonation stability for the curvature effect arising from the three-dimensional nature of stabilized ODW around the projectile. The curvature effect attenuated the detonation wave below its C–J velocity at the vicinity of projectile. The propagation limits of curvature effect will be responsible for the criticality to attain the stabilized ODWs. By accessing the detailed distributions of propagation velocities and curvature radiuses, the critical curvature radiuses normalized by the cell sizes experimentally revealed to be 8 – 10 or 15 – 18 for mixtures diluted with each 50 % argon or 75 % argon/krypton...|$|E
40|$|The Brookhaven National Laboratory High-Temperature Combustion Facility (HTCF) is {{described}} and data from initial hydrogen detonation experiments are presented. Initial {{phase of the}} inherent detonability experimental program {{is described}}. Test gases thus far tested are hydrogen-air mixtures at one atmosphere initial pressure and temperatures 300 K- 650 K. Detonation pressure, wave speed, and detonation cell size were measured. Data were consistent with earlier SSDA (small-scale development apparatus) test results. HTCF results confirm the conclusion from the SSDA program that the gas temperature decreases the cell size and, therefore, increases the sensitivity of mixtures to detonation. Data from the larger HTCF test vessel, however, also demonstrates {{that the effect of}} increased scale is to extend the range of <b>detonable</b> mixtures to lower concentration...|$|E
40|$|The {{propagation}} of a gaseous detonation wave into a porous medium {{has been studied}} experimentally and theoretically. The porous medium is composed of inert spheres of equal diameter contained within a detonation tube. The propagation mechanisms were elucidated by means of high-speed Schlieren and open shutter photography of the wave-particle interactions in 2 -D obstacle arrays, to simulate the phenomenon in actual porous media. It is found that a Chapman-Jouguet (CJ) detonation can transmit into a porous medium filled with <b>detonable</b> gas and continue to propagate as a quasi-steady combustion wave. There exists a continuous spectrum of averaged combustion wave velocities ($ rm 0. 3 le V/V sb{CJ} le 1) $ spanning the lean and rich propagation limits and exhibiting a maximum value at the most sensitive composition. A decrease in the particle size of the medium {{has the effect of}} narrowing the detonability range and reducing the velocity for a given mixture. It is clearly demonstrated that the propagation phenomenon, and thus the velocity, is governed by the relative length scales of the <b>detonable</b> mixture (critical tube diameter $ rm d sb{c}) $ and of the porous medium (average pore size $ rm d sb{p}). $ An empirical correlation was established between the wave velocity (V/V$ sb{CJ}) $ and the properties of the system, via the ratio $ rm d sb{c}/d sb{p}. $ The global wave propagation mechanism, for the major part of the possible range of velocities, i. e., $ rm V/V sb{CJ} ge 0. 5,$ consists of periodic phases of detonation failure by diffraction around obstacles (i. e., the particles), followed by local reinitiation at detonative Mach stems formed by shock wave-particle interactions. This is essentially identical to the {{propagation of}} "quasidetonations" studied by Teodorczyk et al. (1988, 1991), in linear arrangements of obstacles. When local reinitiation of detonation is not possible, ignition transfer in the pores is controlled by the turbulent jetting of hot combustion produ...|$|E
40|$|The {{explosive}} properties of mixtures of hydrogen peroxide and isopropanol were determined The mixtures appear to detonate in a well-defined range of concentrations and show extremely fast reactions in an adjacent range of concentrations if initiated by shock wave stimuli. The upper boundary {{of organic matter}} concentrations at which initiation can be initiated appears to depend on temperature by margins of about 10 to 15 %. The lower boundary is hardly affected by temperature Initiation by exposure to heat may lead to detonation as well. This implies that venting may {{not be sufficient to}} reduce the hazard at these concentrations. The range of concentrations at which <b>detonable</b> properties were observed upon initiation by thermal stimuli is similar to the ranges observed with shock stimuli The test (SCB) and test procedure applied in testing with thermal stimuli appear to be very suitable for this type of testing...|$|E
40|$|A pulse {{detonation}} engine (PDE) uses {{a series}} of high frequency intermittent detonation tubes to generate thrust. The process of filling the detonation tube with fuel and air for each cycle may yield non-uniform mixtures. Lack of mixture uniformity is commonly ignored when calculating detonation tube thrust performance. In this study, detonation cycles featuring idealized non-uniform H 2 /air mixtures were analyzed using the SPARK two-dimensional Navier-Stokes CFD code with 7 -step H 2 /air reaction mechanism. Mixture non-uniformities examined included axial equivalence ratio gradients, transverse equivalence ratio gradients, and partially fueled tubes. Three different average test section equivalence ratios (phi), stoichiometric (phi = 1. 00), fuel lean (phi = 0. 90), and fuel rich (phi = 1. 10), were studied. All mixtures were <b>detonable</b> throughout the detonation tube. It was found that various mixtures representing the same test section equivalence ratio had specific impulses within 1 percent of each other, indicating that good fuel/air mixing is not a prerequisite for optimal detonation tube performance...|$|E

40|$|During {{hypothetical}} core melt accidents {{steam and}} hydrogen can be {{released into the}} air filled containment of pressurized water reactors (PWR). Without counter measures flammable mixtures may form and cause combustion loads that could threaten {{the integrity of the}} containment. German PWR’s are now equipped with passive catalytic recombiners so called PARs (passive autocatalytic recombiners). They are arranged in boxes with arrays of plates coated with a platinum catalyst and are designed to prevent the accumulation of <b>detonable</b> conditions. Recombiner models have been implemented into the CFD code GASFLOW II to simulate such PAR mitigation in thermal hydraulic full containment calculations for various accident scenarios.

40|$|Solid rocket motors are favored {{for launch}} {{applications}} {{because of their}} simplicity and high thrust to weight ratio. Longer space missions and manned missions will require new, higher performance propellants. Preliminary calculations by others have identified the aluminum and water combustion system as having high potential for propulsion applications. Problems achieving and sustaining combustion experienced by early research have been solved {{through the development of}} aluminum nanoparticles. As a result, aluminum and water propellants have received renewed attention. Nearly all recent work on nanoscale aluminum and water propellants has been small in scale. The purpose of this work is to provide fundamental propellant characterization and safety testing, providing a foundation for scale up and development of these propellants. ^ The first part of this work presents a historical overview of research pertinent to the development of aluminum and water propellants. It also discusses aluminum nanoparticles and their characterization. This work also examines the combustion characterization of aluminum and ice propellants experimentally, computationally, and analytically. The safety characterization of propellant formulations in terms of impact, shock, and electrostatic discharge sensitivity are also examined. Procedures for large-scale mixing of the propellant are presented. ^ Results of this work are as follows: Equilibrium combustion calculations predict Al/H 2 O/H 2 O 2 propellants to have theoretical vacuum specific impulses of over 350 seconds. The linear burning rate pressure dependence of formulations has been experimentally shown to vary between 0. 25 - 0. 43 depending on formulation. Hydrogen peroxide was used to enhance the burn rate of aluminum ice mixtures containing larger nanoparticles to replicate burning characteristics of aluminum ice formulations containing smaller aluminum nanoparticles. The surfactant Neodol 91 - 6 was successfully used to mix hydrophobic palmitic acid coated aluminum. Sensitivity testing reveals that palmitic acid and Viton aluminum particle coatings have the potential to dramatically decrease the electrostatic discharge ignition sensitivity of dry aluminum Nanopowders. Shock sensitivity tests reveal that mixtures of aluminum and water containing 5 % hydrogen peroxide in the water are <b>detonable.</b> Stoichiometric aluminum-ice propellants containing 38 nm Technanogy aluminum were determined to be weakly <b>detonable.</b> All mixtures of aluminum and ice containing between 0 - 10 % hydrogen peroxide were insensitive to impact ignition. ...|$|E
40|$|Current {{interest}} in developing a low cost, less complex tactical missile propulsion system that operates on readily available liquid fuels and can operate from low subsonic to a flight Mach number of 5 is driving research on pulse detonation engines. This research program involved the design, construction, and testing of a valveless Pulse Detonation Engine using a JP- 10 / air mixture as the primary combustible reactants. A small JP- 10 /oxygen pre- detonation tube was used to initiate the detonation in the JP- 10 /air mixture in the engine. The engine was tested at various inlet conditions and equivalence ratios {{in order to determine}} the <b>detonable</b> regime of the fuel/air mixture. The original area transition from the pre-detonation tube to the main combustion tube appeared to be too extreme, so a tube was added to extend the pre- detonation tube into the throat of a shock focusing device inserted flush with the head end of the main combustion tube to promote more favorable transition conditions[URL] Navy (U.

40|$|Abstract — This project aims to {{recognize}} when a material is <b>detonable</b> {{and to do}} so with only one to two pounds of the material. The goal is investigating non-ideal explosives reacting well below their critical diameter (Dcr). Since stable detonation is not possible below Dcr, the materials in question, usually fuel-oxidizer mixtures, will be monitored with time-resolved propagation diagnostics. By using both conventional and experimental techniques, pressure and detonation velocity profi les will be measured. This will infer whether the chemistry in the sample is capable of reacting on detona-tion time scales. Because these tests are non-ideal in nature, explosive radial loading will over-compensate for any losses {{at the edges of the}} charge. This confi guration will give the materials their best chance to perform explosively. Results from this test will be compared and integrated with hydrodynamic chemical modelling codes, in particular LLNL’s ALE 3 D and Sandia’s CTH. This year, new diagnostic techniques have been theorized and preliminary testing has confi rmed proof of concept. These diagnostics will be adaptations of existing technologies, which have never been used to witness propagation in explosives, until now...|$|E
40|$|The {{wavefront}} {{propagation of}} curved detonation waves in carbon–oxygen cores and helium shells of Type Ia supernova (SNIa) progenitors is determined via a detonation shock dynamics approach. A level set implementation {{is used to}} track the front, which is evolved according to intrinsic quasi-steady, quasi-one-dimensional detonation speed–curvature relationships. The effects of curvature are analysed {{for a number of}} SNIa models from the literature by comparing the results to those obtained by wavefront propagation at the local planar detonation speed. The differences can be very profound in the low-density regions where detonation models are exploited to produce intermediate-mass elements. In <b>detonable</b> low-density regions, the speed tends to be much lower than the planar wave analysis predicts, while the subsonic driving zone controlling the dynamics is many orders of magnitude shorter. However, the lower shock temperatures ensure that the complete reaction lengths are orders of magnitude longer when curvature effects are properly accounted. Furthermore, the material cannot be detonated in sufficiently low-density regions due to a curvature-induced extinction limit. The implications for and need to reassess the nucleosynthesis and intermediate-mass element production of SNIa detonation models is discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} project is to develop and validate a detailed chemical kinetic mechanism for gas-phase hydrazine decomposition. Hydrazine is used extensively in aerospace propulsion, and although liquid hydrazine is not considered <b>detonable,</b> many fuel handling systems create multiphase mixtures of fuels and fuel vapors during their operation. Therefore, a thorough knowledge of the decomposition chemistry of hydrazine {{under a variety of}} conditions can be of value in assessing potential operational hazards in hydrazine fuel systems. To gain such knowledge, a reasonable starting point is the development and validation of a detailed chemical kinetic mechanism for gas-phase hydrazine decomposition. A reasonably complete mechanism was published in 1996, however, many of the elementary steps included had outdated rate expressions and a thorough investigation of the behavior of the mechanism under a variety of conditions was not presented. The current work has included substantial revision of the previously published mechanism, along with a more extensive examination of the decomposition behavior of hydrazine. An attempt to validate the mechanism against the limited experimental data available has been made and was moderately successful. Further computational and experimental research into the chemistry of this fuel needs to be completed...|$|E

40|$|Experimental {{results are}} {{presented}} examining {{the behavior of the}} shock wave created when a gaseous detonation wave normally impinges upon a planar wall. Gaseous detonations are created in a 7. 67 -m-long, 280 -mm-internal-diameter detonation tube instrumented with a test section of rectangular cross section enabling visualization of the region at the tube-end farthest from the point of detonation initiation. Dynamic pressure measurements and high-speed schlieren photography in the region of detonation reflection are used to examine the characteristics of the inbound detonation wave and outbound reflected shock wave. Data from a range of <b>detonable</b> fuel/oxidizer/diluent/initial pressure combinations are presented to examine the effect of cell-size and detonation regularity on detonation reflection. The reflected shock does not bifurcate in any case examined and instead remains nominally planar when interacting with the boundary layer that is created behind the incident wave. The trajectory of the reflected shock wave is examined in detail, and the wave speed is found to rapidly change close to the end-wall, an effect we attribute to the interaction of the reflected shock with the reaction zone behind the incident detonation wave. Far from the end-wall, the reflected shock wave speed is in reasonable agreement with the ideal model of reflection which neglects the presence of a finite-length reaction zone. The net far-field effect of the reaction zone is to displace the reflected shock trajectory from the predictions of the ideal model, explaining the apparent disagreement of the ideal reflection model with experimental reflected shock observations of previous studies...|$|E
40|$|Thermo-nuclear fusion {{may be the}} key to a high Isp, high {{specific}} power (low alpha) propulsion system. In a fusion system energy is liberated within, and imparted directly to, the propellant. In principle, this can overcome the performance limitations inherent in systems that require thermal power transfer across a material boundary, and/or multiple power conversion stages (NTR, NEP). A thermo-nuclear propulsion system, which attempts to overcome some of the problems inherent in the ORION concept, is described. A passive tapered liner is launched behind a vehicle, through a hole in a pusher-plate, that is connected to the vehicle by a shock-absorbing mechanism. A dense FRC plasmoid is then accelerated to high velocity (in excess of 1, 000 km/s) and shot through the hole into the liner, when it has reached a given point down-range. The kinetic energy of the FRC is converted into thermal and magnetic-field energy, igniting a fusion bum in the magnetically confined plasma. The fusion reaction serves as an ignition source for the liner, which is made out of <b>detonable</b> materials. The energy liberated in this process is converted to thrust by the pusher-plate, as in the classic ORION concept. However with this concept, the vehicle does not carry a magazine of pre-fabricated pulse-units. A magnetic nozzle may also be used, in place of the pusher-plate. Estimates of the conditions needed to achieve a sufficient gain will be presented, along with a description of the driver characteristics. The incorporation of this concept into the propulsion system of a spacecraft will also be discussed...|$|E
40|$|Spherical {{projectiles}} {{were launched}} into <b>detonable</b> mixtures {{over a wide}} range of projectile velocities from near to about 1. 8 times the Chapman–Jouguet (C–J) velocity. Oblique detonation waves (ODWs) and shock-induced combustions (SICs) stabilized around the projectiles were visualized with high time and high spatial resolutions using the Schlieren technique and a high-speed camera with a 1 -μs frame speed. Unsteady wave structures called Straw Hat type structures consisting of a SIC region followed by a C–J ODW were observed near stabilizing criticalities of a C–J ODW, and they were divided into two propagation types, depending on whether the C–J ODW could be stabilized [11], [12] and [14]. In the present study, we suggested wave structures of the Straw Hat types based on our examination of dozens of continuous images. Triple points were observed at the intersection of a bow shock, a C–J ODW and a transverse detonation or shock wave when projectile velocities were slightly higher than C–J velocities. Onsets of local explosions in the SIC region for stabilizing the ODW in the Straw Hat type structures have been reported [14]. We observed this stabilizing mechanism by visualizing onsets of periodical local explosions and their transition to spherical detonation waves when the projectile velocity was much higher than the C–J velocity. We also determined stabilizing criticalities using a stoichiometric acetylene-oxygen mixture diluted with argon or krypton in 50 % or 75 % volumetric fractions, respectively. We found that the stabilizing criticalities did not depend only on the ratio of the projectile diameter and the cell size of the mixture...|$|E

Our paper deals with Minimum-signature (smokeless) propellant. This propellant is non-polluting, acid free; solid particulates free, and lead free. It is also smoke free and has only a faint shock diamond pattern that is visible in the otherwise transparent exhaust. Without the bright flame and dense smoke trail produced by the burning of aluminized propellants, these smokeless propellants all but eliminate the risk of giving away the positions from which the missiles are fired. This invention relates to propellant formulations and plastic bonded explosive compositions. More particularly, this invention relates to energetic compositions, which offer increased performance {{in conjunction with a}} total absence of halogen based oxidizers to eliminate exhaust products, such as hydrogen chloride. This paper also contains the economic analysis of this smoke free propellant. It is also smoke free and has only a faint shock diamond pattern that is visible in the otherwise transparent exhaust.

40|$|The {{wavefront}} {{propagation of}} curved detonation waves in carbon-oxygen cores and helium shells of type Ia supernova progenitors may be predicted via a Detonation Shock Dynamics (DSD) approach. DSD is used typically in engineering to model explosives. A level set implementation {{is used to}} evolve the front, using intrinsic quasi-steady, quasi-one-dimensional detonation speed-curvature relationships. The effects of curvature are analysed {{for a number of}} models from the literature which originally use the local planar detonation speed, and compared. The differences can be very profound in the low density regions where detonation models are exploited to produce intermediate mass elements. In <b>detonable</b> low density regions, the detonation wave speed tends to be much lower than the planar DSD analysis predicts, while the subsonic driving zone controlling the dynamics is many order of magnitude shorter than its planar version. However, the lower shock temperatures ensure that the complete reaction lengths are orders of magnitude longer when curvature effects are properly accounted. Furthermore, the material cannot be detonated in sufficiently low density regions due to a curvature induced extinction limit. The implications for and need to reassess the nucleosynthesis, intermediate mass element production and even the progenitors of SN Ia detonation models, is discussed. In the second part of this thesis, an adapted method for evolving the front when the speed function has a curvature component is introduced. A stationary boundary value problem is adapted by considering the non-stationary form. This method is similar in its implementation to the level set form but is more efficient. Its efficiency and error is investigated and compared to the level set method...|$|E
40|$|The High-Temperature Combustion Facility (HTCF) was {{designed}} and constructed {{with the objective of}} studying detonation phenomena in mixtures of hydrogen-air-steam at initially high temperatures. The central element of the HTCF is a 27 -cm inner-diameter, 21. 3 -m long cylindrical test vessel capable of being heating to 700 K {+-} 14 K. A unique feature of the HTCF is the {open_quotes}diaphragmless{close_quotes} acetylene-oxygen gas driver which is used to initiate the detonation in the test gas. Cell size measurements have shown that for any hydrogen-air-steam mixture, increasing the initial mixture temperature, in the range of 300 K to 650 K, while maintaining the initial pressure of 0. 1 MPa, decreases the cell size and thus makes the mixture more <b>detonable.</b> The effect of steam dilution on cell size was tested in stoichiometric and off-stoichiometric (e. g., equivalence ratio of 0. 5) hydrogen-air mixtures. Increasing the steam dilution in hydrogen-air mixtures at 0. 1 MPa initial pressure increases the cell size, irrespective of initial temperature. It is also observed that the desensitizing effect of steam diminished with increased initial temperature. A 1 -dimensional, steady-state Zel`dovich, von Neumann, Doring (ZND) model, with full chemical kinetics, has been used to predict cell size for hydrogen-air-steam mixtures at different initial conditions. Qualitatively the model predicts the overall trends observed in the measured cell size versus mixture composition and initial temperature and pressure. It was found that the proportionality constant used to predict detonation cell size from the calculated ZND model reaction zone varies between 10 and 100 depending on the mixture composition and initial temperature. 32 refs., 35 figs...|$|E
40|$|Detonation {{waves in}} gaseous {{reactive}} mixtures {{have been known}} to exhibit multidimensional structure since the 1950 's. The interaction of shocks and presence of unsteady triple shock interactions in the detonation structure give rise to the detonation cell, the size of which is determined by the reactive mixture and initial conditions. <b>Detonable</b> gaseous mixtures have been classified as regular or irregular, depending on their behavior in particular experimental conditions. The main combustion mechanisms in the structure of irregular mixtures have not yet been positively identified. The structure of detonation waves in an irregular mixture of stoichiometric methane and oxygen is observed using non-intrusive visual diagnostics. Framing schlieren, streak schlieren and framing self-luminous imaging were used, yielding, respectively, an instantaneous measure of the density gradient, a time evolution of the density gradients and a record of the regions of high luminosity. Regions of high luminosity correspond qualitatively to regions of high chemical reaction. Pockets of high density gas were observed behind the lead shock surface. Light emission was observed, using framing self-luminous imaging, at the edges of these pockets indicating the pockets burned primarily at the edges. The amount of mass burned in one such pocket was found to be 40 % of the total mass burned in one cell cycle. The induction time of a particle undergoing shock compression was calculated. The cases of constant properties behind the shock and of a decaying blast followed by expansion waves were considered as characteristic induction times of shock-induced combustion. Both measures of induction time were found to be longer than the typical time scale of a particle burning in one of the observed pockets.

It is {{found that the}} noise {{radiation characteristics}} are intermittent and periodic. Pulse detonation engine jet noise are mainly consisted of annuploe source and quardrupole source. The frequency spectrum of the noise is very broad, its radiation energy mainly concentrates in the frequency range of 0 - 5 kHz, and it is composed of principal frequency (namely the detonation frequency), which is caused by pulse jet and harmonic frequencies. The peak sound pressure level is not sensitive to operating frequencies of this two kinds of conformations, but it increases along with the increasing of equivalence ratio and fill fraction. The impulse sound pressure level increases with the increasing of operating frequency, equivalence ratio and fill fraction. The peak sound pressure level of HPDE is less than PDC about 4 dB, and the impulse sound pressure level reduces 2 dB. At the same measuring locations, the head pressure, pipe pressure and PDC outlet pressure of the HPDE is greater than PDC. In the condition of HPDE’s equivalence ratio is a constant, when the detonation wave flows through the turbine, {{the reduction of the}} peak pressure between the PDC outlet and the turbine exhaust decreases with the increasing of fill fraction, and the greater fill fraction increases, the smaller reduction produces. The reduction is 29. 74 dB when fill fraction is 1. 0.

40|$|Emulsion {{explosives}} are non-ideal explosives. The composition, rheological {{structure and}} its detonation properties {{were presented in}} previous ICT Conferences. Emulsion matrix is only <b>detonable</b> if it is sensitized (generally by hollow microspheres dispersed in the emulsion gelatin phase). Two kinds of spheres were used in experiments - expanded dry micro-spheres of 50 µm mean diameter (DE) and 5 mm expanded polystyrene spheres (EPS). The last big EPS spheres were successively dispersed in emulsion gelatin (emulsion matrix) and in emulsion explosive sensitized with DE microspheres. This sensitization mechanism {{can be explained by}} the deformation and collapse of the hollow microspheres, under shock detonation transmission, generating compressed hot gas and very high shear stress conditions in two lateral pockets. These two hot spot zones insure ignition of the outside emulsion matrix, generating, by the progress of reaction, cells and compressed layers, very well recorded in experimental tests, by the printed figures in copper witness plates. The experimental micro dynamic measurements were performed using optical techniques, using optical fibers and fast opto-electronic converters (presented previously in ICT Conferences). Two kinds of optical multimode fibers can be used in these measurements: PMMA and silica fibers. In a similar way, two kinds of opto-electronic receivers were used, as a function of optical range (maximum sensibility at 650 nm and 850 nm). Rise time is less than 50 ns. Silica fibers of 60 µm present more precise experimental measurements, due its reduced diameter and its more difficult ignition behavior with atmospheric air, when shocked from expansion of detonation products. Record signals show clearly the collapse of the EPS sphere. It shows the arrival of shock detonation front in sphere, the disappearing of light during collapse of sphere, and at the end, the very intense light generated by hot spots. Then two reaction progress regions seem to be developed. Their progression generate, sometimes, a central reaction zone, proved by the printed crater at the copper witness plate. This complex phenomena ensure the self-sustained detonation progression...|$|E
40|$|Pulse Detonation Engine Technology is {{currently}} being investigated at Glenn for both airbreathing and rocket propulsion applications. The potential for both mechanical simplicity and high efficiency due to the inherent near-constant-volume combustion process, may make Pulse Detonation Engines (PDE's) well suited {{for a number of}} mission profiles. Assessment of PDE cycles requires a simulation capability that is both fast and accurate. It should capture the essential physics of the system, yet run at speeds that allow parametric analysis. A quasi-one-dimensional, computational-fluid-dynamics-based simulation has been developed that may meet these requirements. The Euler equations of mass, momentum, and energy have been used along with a single reactive species transport equation, and submodels to account for dominant loss mechanisms (e. g., viscous losses, heat transfer, and valving) to successfully simulate PDE cycles. A high-resolution numerical integration scheme was chosen to capture the discontinuities associated with detonation, and robust boundary condition procedures were incorporated to accommodate flow reversals that may arise during a given cycle. The accompanying graphs compare experimentally measured and computed performance over a range of operating conditions for a particular PDE. Experimental data were supplied by Fred Schauer and Jeff Stutrud from the Air Force Research Laboratory at Wright-Patterson AFB and by Royce Bradley from Innovative Scientific Solutions, Inc. The left graph shows thrust and specific impulse, Isp, as functions of equivalence ratio for a PDE cycle in which the tube is completely filled with a <b>detonable</b> hydrogen/air mixture. The right graph shows thrust and specific impulse as functions of the fraction of the tube that is filled with a stoichiometric mixture of hydrogen and air. For both figures, the operating frequency was 16 Hz. The agreement between measured and computed values is quite good, both in terms of trend and magnitude. The error is under 10 percent everywhere except for the thrust value at an equivalence ratio of 0. 8 in the left figure, where it is 14 percent. The simulation results shown were made using 200 numerical cells. Each cycle of the engine, approximately 0. 06 sec, required 2. 0 min of CPU time on a Sun Ultra 2. The simulation {{is currently}} being used to analyze existing experiments, design new experiments, and predict performance in propulsion concepts where the PDE is a component (e. g., hybrid engines and combined cycles) ...|$|E
40|$|This work {{focuses on}} {{applying}} modern molecular simulation techniques and ab initio methods, such as electronic density functional theory, {{to explore the}} synthesis of nanoporous aluminosilicates and their use as solid acid catalysts. Paramount to all investigations into the design of porous solids {{is the need for}} a fundamental understanding of the initial steps leading to the formation of these materials. To begin, we explored the mechanism and energetics of the condensation reaction of prenucleation silica species. Our results suggested the initial steps in the synthesis process {{play a crucial role in}} determining the properties of the resulting crystalline solids. To further elucidate the synthesis mechanism, we employed a hybrid solvation technique to examine the self-assembly process forming mesoporous solids templated via block copolymers. Our results indicated the Q 3 silica species play a predominate role in forming the ordered mesophase domain of the porous solids and gives evidence that the self-assembly process is in some way driven via intermolecular forces and not simply through ionic interactions. ^ In the area of catalyst function, the use of zeolite-based catalysts in the aromatization of light alkanes is a very industrially important process. To improve catalyst performance, research has focused on elucidating each step in the aromatization pathway. We examined the oligomerization reaction of propene and subsequent adsorption of the resulting C 6 species occurring at Brønsted acid sites within the pores of the zeolite H-ZSM- 5. To model the active site of H-ZSM- 5 we used two cluster modeling techniques: a fully QM bare-cluster model and a combined QM/MM embedded-cluster model. We concluded that cluster size effects must be considered when the relative stability of adsorbed species is under investigation. However, for reaction path analysis and activation energy calculations the more minimalistic models may be suitable. ^ Finally, the catalytic cracking of hydrocarbon jet-fuel, JP- 10, was studied. The motivation behind this work was to understand the cracking reaction of JP- 10 for use as a possible propellant for pulse detonation engines and other high-speed flight applications. JP- 10 was targeted primarily due to its high stability. Unfortunately, this advantage makes detonation of the fuel difficult when using a low-energy ignition source available on most flight vehicles. Thus, catalytic pre-cracking has been identified as a viable method of breaking the larger hydrocarbon into more easily <b>detonable</b> light hydrocarbons. We proposed a closed-loop catalytic cycle for the cracking of JP- 10 over H-ZSM- 5. Reaction path analysis showed the process to have an endothermic heat of decomposition which presents a plausible heat sink for the combustion reaction. ...|$|E
40|$|There is a {{definite}} inconsistency between the classical ZND theory of detonation and contemporary experimental observations and attempts to model real detonation waves. Nevertheless, the classical onedimensional model of detonation is still extensively used in interpreting measurements because of its simplicity and physical clarity. This naturally raises the questions, what does actually the classical model represent and how one can relate the real multidimensional wave structure to an effective onedimensional detonation ? The answer to these questions is extremely important from the practical point of view, because it defines how simple {{the solution of the}} criticality problems in detonation could be (i. e. whether one has to solve the very cumbersome three-dimensional nonsteady gasdynamic problem with detailed kinetics of the chemical reaction comprising a few hundreds of elementary steps to predict such parameters as critical initiation energy, critical distances, and concentrations, or the solution of a simplified onedimensional gasdynamic problem with global chemical kinetic equations would suffice ?). The present communication discusses the following ATTillisible with the aim of answering partly the above questions. (1) An analysis of the detailed kinetic calculations of the heat evolution rate in some fuel-air mixtures and comparison of these results with experiments reveals that (a) in the majority of <b>detonable</b> mixtures heat release can be described by global equations with an accuracy quite sufficient for assessing the critical detonation parameters, (b) chemical kinetics shows no so-called "recombination" zones with an appreciable heat evolution that follow the main reaction zone, (c) the ratio between the induction and the explosion (within which the major fraction of the stored energy is evolved) times exceeds unity under the conditions corresponding to detonation waves in fuel-air mixtures, which contradicts the shock tube measurements. All these results can be reasonably {{explained by the fact that}} the chemical reaction in detonation waves (in shock waves as well) proceeds in a gas with a highly inhomogeneous distribution of the parameters (temperatures, pressures, and particle velocity) which gives rise to the so-called hot-spot mechanism of chemical reactions in gaseous and two-phase media. It is shown that the hot spot ignition is the main reason of instability of detonation waves. Nonsynchronous mixture ignition at different points produces the effect of extended heat evolution zone and reduces the effective induction zone. Results of measurements of averaged and local parameters behind detonation waves in gases support the idea that the effective heat evolution rate in the onedimensional representation of the wave is much more complicated than that inherent in the chemical reaction alone, because it contains also a significant contribution of the kinetic and thermodynamic energy redistribution within the major reaction zone and downstream of it, which makes the onedimensional structure of detonation waves deviate significantly from the classical pattern leading to nonmonotonic heat release behind the shock front (the possibility of appearance of two or more effective sonic planes and heat rlease maxima). However, a onedimensional analysis of marginal detonation waves has demonstrated that critical parameters can be estimated quite accurately within simplified models, which is attributable to the fact that the criticality is associated with local termination of the reaction within narrow stream tubes where the flow pattern resembles closely the ZND non-CJ detonation wave structure. Unlike the chemical reaction zone in detonations far away from the limit, which is shorter than the detonation cell size, the reaction zone in marginal detonations is comparable with the cell size. The results of onedimensional calculations of critical diameters and minimal energies of direct initiation of detonation are compared with experiment...|$|E
40|$|An {{improved}} type of {{exhaust nozzle}} has been invented to help optimize {{the performances of}} multitube detonative combustion engines. The invention is applicable to both air-breathing and rocket engines used to propel some aircraft and spacecraft, respectively. In a detonative combustion engine, thrust is generated through the expulsion of combustion products from a detonation process in which combustion {{takes place in a}} reaction zone coupled to a shock wave. The combustion releases energy to sustain the shock wave, while the shock wave enhances the combustion in the reaction zone. The coupled shockwave/reaction zone, commonly referred to as a detonation, propagates through the reactants at very high speed. typically of the order of several thousands of feet per second (of the order of 1 km/s). The very high speed of the detonation forces combustion to occur very rapidly, thereby contributing to high thermodynamic efficiency. A detonative combustion engine of the type to which the present invention applies includes multiple parallel cylindrical combustion tubes, each closed at the front end and open at the rear end. Each tube is filled with a fuel/oxidizer mixture, and then a detonation wave is initiated at the closed end. The wave propagates rapidly through the fuel/oxidizer mixture, producing very high pressure due to the rapid combustion. The high pressure acting on the closed end of the tube contributes to forward thrust. When the detonation wave reaches the open end of the tube, it produces a blast wave, behind which the high-pressure combustion products are expelled from the tube. The process of filling each combustion tube with a <b>detonable</b> fuel/oxidizer mixture and then producing a detonation repeated rapidly to obtain repeated pulses of thrust. Moreover, the multiple combustion tubes are filled and fired in a repeating sequence. Hence, the pressure at the outlet of each combustion tube varies cyclically. A nozzle of the present invention channels the expansion of the pulsed combustion gases from the multiple combustion tubes into a common exhaust stream, in such a manner as to enhance performance in two ways: (1) It reduces the cyclic variations of pressure at the outlets of the combustion tubes so as to keep the pressure approximately constant near the optimum level needed for filling the tubes, regardless of atmospheric pressure at the altitude of operation; and (2) It maximizes the transfer of momentum from the exhaust gas to the engine, thereby maximizing thrust. The figure depicts a typical engine equipped with a nozzle according to the invention. The nozzle includes an interface section comprising multiple intake ports that couple the outlets of the combustion tubes to a common plenum. Proceeding from its upstream to its downstream end, the interface section tapers to a larger cross-sectional area for flow. This taper fosters expansion of the exhaust gases flowing from the outlets of the combustion tubes and contributes to the desired equalization of exhaust combustion pressure. The cross-sectional area for flow in the common plenum is greater than, or at least equal to, the combined cross-sectional flow areas of the combustor tubes. In the common plenum, the exhaust streams from the individual combustion tubes mix to form a single compound subsonic exhaust stream. Downstream of the common plenum is the throat that tapers to a smaller flow cross section. In this throat, the exhaust gases become compressed to form a compound sonic gas stream. Downstream of the throat is an expansion section, which typically has a bell or a conical shape. (The expansion section can be truncated or even eliminated {{in the case of an}} air-breathing engine.) After entering the expansion section, the exhaust gases expand rapidly from compound sonic to compound supersonic speeds and are then vented to the environment. The basic invention admits of numerous variations. For example, the combustion tubes can be arranged around the central axin a symmetrical or asymmetrical pattern other than the one shown in the figure. For another example, the flow cross-sectional area(s) of one or more of the intake ports in the interface section, of the common plenum, the throat, and/or the expansion section can be varied, either symmetrically or asymmetrically, to adjust dynamics of the exhaust stream or to direct the thrust vector away from the central axis...|$|E
