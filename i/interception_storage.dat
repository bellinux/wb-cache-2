Maximum water storage capacity and <b>interception</b> <b>storage</b> capacity under various rainfall conditions were evaluated for two contrasting litter types: a needle-leaf type, represented by Cryptomeria japonica leaves; and a broad-leaf type, represented by Lithocarpus edulis leaves. An artificial rainfall simulator was applied to measure each litter type’s <b>interception</b> <b>storage</b> capacity under various rainfall intensities. Our results indicated that (1) the maximum water storage capacity of each litter layer was proportional to the litter mass (kg/m 2) regardless of layer thickness; (2) the litter <b>interception</b> <b>storage</b> capacity increased with rainfall intensity {{in the range of}} realistic rainfall conditions (under 50 mm/h); (3) the broad-leaf litter of L. edulis intercepted more rainwater than the needle-leaf litter of C. japonica; and (4) the rainwater moved laterally in the litter layer of L. edulis whereas it moved directly down in the litter layer of C. japonica. These results show that not only the litter mass but also the rainfall conditions and leaf shapes are important in evaluating the moisture dynamics of litter layers.

Past research has either neglected or underestimated the role of hydrological functions of litter layers, although some studies have considered the impact of various characteristics of rainfall and litter on litter interception. Based on both simulated rainfall and litter conditions in North China, the effect of litter mass, rainfall intensity and litter type on the maximum water storage capacity of litter (S) and litter <b>interception</b> <b>storage</b> capacity (C) were investigated under five simulated rainfall intensities and four litter masses for two litter types. The results indicated: 1) the S values increased linearly with litter mass, and the S values of broadleaf litter were on average 2. 65 {{times larger than the}} S values of needle leaf litter; 2) rainfall intensity rather than litter mass determined the maximum <b>interception</b> <b>storage</b> capacity (Cmax); Cmax increased linearly with increasing rainfall intensity; by contrast, the minimum <b>interception</b> <b>storage</b> capacity (Cmin) showed a linear relationship with litter mass, but a poor correlation with rainfall intensity; 3) litter type impacted Cmax and Cmin; the values of Cmax and Cmin for broadleaf litter were larger than those of needle leaf litter, which indicated that broadleaf litter could intercepte and store more water than needle leaf litter; 4) a gap existed between Cmax and Cmin, indicating that litter played a significant role by allowing rainwater to infiltrate or to produce runoff rather than intercepting it and allowing it to evaporate after the rainfall event; 5) Cmin was always less than S at the same litter mass, which should be considered in future interception predictions.

40|$|A major {{challenge}} in hydrologic modeling remains the {{mapping of vegetation}} dynamics in an urban landscape. The impact of vegetation on <b>interception</b> <b>storage</b> varies over time {{and needs to be}} quantified in order to enable proper management of water resources in urban areas. However, the heterogeneity and complexity of the urban landscape makes it challenging to monitor urban vegetation. A more detailed spatial and temporal scale is needed. To characterize surface cover at a high spatial resolution, a hyperspectral APEX image (2 m) is used, while a time series of Proba-V images (daily, 100 m) allows a detailed characterization of the seasonal variation of urban greenness. For this study, we use and validate the leaf area index (LAI) maps derived from APEX and Proba-V data for a selected pixel in the Watermaelbeek catchment in Brussels (Belgium). The ground-truthing of the Proba-V pixels includes a detailed mapping of land cover characteristics and more specifically vegetation cover throughout the seasons. LAI values calculated based on the APEX image agree with the LAI values measured from the ground (n = 106, R 2 = 0. 68). Further, the aggregated APEX pixels correlate with the Proba-V pixels (R 2 = 0. 79), and the Proba-V data can be used to monitor vegetation dynamics. As the seasonal LAI measurements correspond with the Proba-V dynamics, we conclude that Proba-V images allow the characterization of vegetation dynamics at a high spatial resolution in heterogeneous areas.

40|$|Interception {{losses are}} a major {{influence}} in the water yield of vegetated areas. For most storms, interception results in less water reaching the ground. However, fog drip or occult precipitation can result in negative interception because small drops are deposited on all plant surfaces and subsequently {{fall to the ground}} once vegetation storage capacities are exceeded. Fog drip is normally disregarded, but for some plant communities, it could be a mechanism offsetting evaporation losses. Tillandsia recurvata is a cosmopolitan epiphyte adapted to arid habitats where fog may be an important water source. Therefore, the <b>interception</b> <b>storage</b> capacity by T. recurvata was measured in controlled conditions through applying simulated rain or fog. The storage capacity was proportional to dry weight mass. Nocturnal stomatic opening in T. recurvata is not only relevant for CO 2 but for water vapor, as suggested by the higher weight change of specimens wetted with fog for 1 h at dark in comparison to those wetted during daylight (543 ± 77 vs. 325 ± 56 mg, p = 0. 048). The coefficients obtained in the laboratory were used together with biomass measurements for T. recurvata in a xeric scrub to calculate the depth of water intercepted. <b>Interception</b> <b>storage</b> capacity (C min) was 0. 19 and 0. 54 mm for rainfall and fog respectively. T. recurvata contributed 20 % to the rain interception of their shrub hosts: Acacia farnesiana and Prosopis laevigata. Meteorological data registered during one year at Cadereyta, México showed that radiative fog formation was possible during the dry season. The results showed the potential role of T. recurvata in capturing fog, which probably is a main source of water during the dry season that supports their reproductive and physiological activity at that time. The storage capacity of T. recurvata leaf surfaces could increase the amount of water available for evaporation, but as this species colonise montane forests, the effect could be negative on water recharge, because in the laboratory experiments it took up to 12 h to reach saturation conditions when fog was applied...|$|E

Snowslide appeared to be the dominant process of canopy snow removal during the study period, with melt, wind erosion, evaporation of meltwater, and sublimation of canopy snow occurring in order of decreasing significance.

The computations based on actual gauzing illustrates that while the cultivated and forested watersheds yield almost the same amount, the cultivated watershed exudes the water faster during the first months, and therefore sooner becomes exhausted (Kerr 2002).|$|R

40|$|Hydrologic {{climate change}} {{modelling}} is hampered by climate-dependent model parameterizations. To reduce this dependency, we extended the regional hydrologic modelling framework SIMGRO {{to host a}} two-way coupling between the soil moisture model MetaSWAP and the crop growth simulation model WOFOST, accounting for ecohydrologic feedbacks in terms of radiation fraction that reaches the soil, crop coefficient, interception fraction of rainfall, <b>interception</b> <b>storage</b> capacity, and root zone depth. Except for the last, these feedbacks are dependent on the leaf area index (LAI). The influence of regional groundwater on crop growth is included via a coupling to MODFLOW. Two versions of the MetaSWAP-WOFOST coupling were set up: one with exogenous vegetation parameters, the "static" model, and one with endogenous crop growth simulation, the "dynamic" model. Parameterization of the static and dynamic models ensured that for the current climate the simulated long-term averages of actual evapotranspiration are the same for both models. Simulations were made for two climate scenarios and two crops: grass and potato. In the dynamic model, higher temperatures in a warm year under the current climate resulted in accelerated crop development, {{and in the case}} of potato a shorter growing season, thus partly avoiding the late summer heat. The static model has a higher potential transpiration; depending on the available soil moisture, this translates to a higher actual transpiration. This difference between static and dynamic models is enlarged by climate change in combination with higher CO 2 concentrations. Including the dynamic crop simulation gives for potato (and other annual arable land crops) systematically higher effects on the predicted recharge change due to climate change. Crop yields from soils with poor water retention capacities strongly depend on capillary rise if moisture supply from other sources is limited. Thus, including a crop simulation model in an integrated hydrologic simulation provides a valuable addition for hydrologic modelling as well as for crop modellin...|$|E
40|$|In {{this chapter}} {{our goal is}} to {{highlight}} some of the many ways that urbanization affects the water budget and water cycle. A water budget describes the stores or volumes of water in the surface, subsurface and atmospheric compartments of the environment over a chosen increment of time. The water cycle has to do with char-acterizing the flow paths and flow rates of water from one store to another. Under-standing how urbanization affects the water budget and water cycle first requires an appreciation of how conditions work in a natural system. The sun drives the hydrologic cycle, whereby water is evaporated by solar radia-tion from oceans, inland water bodies and soil, condenses and falls on land as precip-itation, and returns to receiving water bodies by either surface runoff or groundwater discharge (Fig. 2. 1). There are many critical sub cycles within the overall hydrologic cycle. For example, a portion of precipitation is returned to the atmosphere by evap-oration before it reaches the ground. A portion of precipitation that is stored on veg-etation (<b>interception</b> <b>storage),</b> on the land surface in puddles (depression storage), or in shallow soil pores, also evaporates rather than moving downward to ground-water or running off to surface water channels. Precipitation infiltrating the soil that is not lost to evaporation can flow downward to recharge groundwater, contributing to a rise in the water table, or flow shallowly in a lateral direction and discharge to streams. Flow in streams that is not due to surface or shallow subsurface runoff from the land is termed base flow; base flow in natural systems arises from deep and shallow groundwater discharging to streams during both storm and non-storm periods. A water budget or water mass balance can be calculated for any time increment for a chosen control volume, wher...|$|E

40|$|Snow {{cover is}} not only a major {{hydrological}} input to the Wolf Creek Research Basin but provides a habitat for life and sustains important interactions with vegetation and climate. The losses or gains of snow within the basin and to and from the basin are therefore extremely important for the hydrology, biology and climatology of the region. This paper will review a four year record of snow studies in Wolf Creek. The sites are in the alpine, shrub-tundra and boreal forest vegetation bands of the basin and are representative of tundra plateaux, valley shrub-tundra and lowland forest respectively. At the alpine and shrub-tundra sites, wind speed, blowing snow occurrence, snow depth, temperature and humidity were measured half-hourly and snowfall and snow accumulation on the ground measured monthly. These measurements permit a mass balance of snow transformations due to blowing snow on the alpine plateaux and shrub-tundra valleys of Wolf Creek Basin. The measurements show that on average 50 % of snowfall is removed from the alpine plateau and 25 % is removed from low-lying shrub-tundra by blowing snow storms. Much of this snow is relocated to hillsides where it can triple snow accumulations. However, though some blowing snow is lost to sublimation, the proportion cannot yet be quantified in mountainous terrain. At the forest site, snow surveys under the canopy were compared to snowfall records in order to estimate snow <b>interception</b> <b>storage</b> and eventual sublimation. Snow remains in the canopy for weeks to months in the cold mid-winter. From 38 %- 45 % of annual snowfall is lost to snow sublimation from spruce canopies in the lower elevations of Wolf Creek. The implications of these results are that the snow cover of Wolf Creek is controlled by its vegetation cover, exposure and climate. Changes to land use or climate in the Yukon will therefore have profound changes on the snow cover and then on the water resources, aquatic chemistry, animal populations and vegetation that are influenced by snow...|$|E
40|$|Characterizing the {{response}} of a catchment to rainfall, {{in terms of the}} production of runoff vs the interception, transpiration and evaporation of water, is the first important step in understanding water resource availability in a catchment. This is particularly important in small semi-arid catchments, where a few intense rainfall events may generate much of the season's runoff. The ephemeral Zhulube catchment (30 km(2)) in the northern Limpopo basin was instrumented and modelled in order to elucidate the dominant hydrological processes. Discharge events were disconnected, with short recession curves, probably caused by the shallow soils in the Tshazi sub-catchment, which dry out rapidly, and the presence of a dambo in the Gobalidanke sub-catchment. Two different flow event types were observed, with the larger floods showing longer recessions being associated with higher (antecedent) precipitation. The differences could be related to: (a) intensity of rainfall, or (b) different soil conditions. Interception is an important process in the water balance of the catchment, accounting for an estimated 32 % of rainfall in the 2007 / 08 season, but as much as 56 % in the drier 2006 / 07 season. An extended version of the HBV model was developed (designated HBVx), introducing an <b>interception</b> <b>storage</b> and with all routines run in semi-distributed mode. After extensive manual calibration, the HBVx simulation satisfactorily showed the disconnected nature of the flows. The generally low Nash-Sutcliffe coefficients {{can be explained by the}} model failing to simulate the two different observed flow types differently. The importance of incorporating interception into rainfall-runoff is demonstrated by the substantial improvement in objective function values obtained. This exceeds the gains made by changing from lumped to semi-distributed mode, supported by 1 000 000 Monte Carlo simulations. There was also an important improvement in the daily volume error. The best simulation, supported by field observations in the Gobalidanke sub-catchment, suggested that discharge was driven mainly by flow from saturation overland flow. Hortonian overland flow, as interpreted from field observations in the Tshazi sub-catchment, was not simulated so well. A limitation of the model is its inability to address temporal variability in soil characteristics and more complex runoff generation processes. The model suggests episodic groundwater recharge with annual recharge of 100 mm year(- 1), which is similar to that reported by other studies in Zimbabwe...|$|E
40|$|Climate change impact {{modelling}} of hydrologic responses is {{hampered by}} climate-dependent model parameterizations. Reducing this dependency {{was one of}} the goals of extending the regional hydrologic modelling system SIMGRO with a two-way coupling to the crop growth simulation model WOFOST. The coupling includes feedbacks to the hydrologic model in terms of the root zone depth, soil cover, leaf area index, <b>interception</b> <b>storage</b> capacity, crop height and crop factor. For investigating whether such feedbacks lead to significantly different simulation results, two versions of the model coupling were set up for a test region: one with exogenous vegetation parameters, the "static" model, and one with endogenous simulation of the crop growth, the "dynamic" model WOFOST. The used parameterization methods of the static/dynamic vegetation models ensure that for the current climate the simulated long-term average of the actual evapotranspiration is the same for both models. Simulations were made for two climate scenarios. Owing to the higher temperatures in combination with a higher CO 2 -concentration of the atmosphere, a forward time shift of the crop development is simulated in the dynamic model; the used arable land crop, potatoes, also shows a shortening of the growing season. For this crop, a significant reduction of the potential transpiration is simulated compared to the static model, in the example by 15 % in a warm, dry year. In consequence, the simulated crop water stress (the unit minus the relative transpiration) is lower when the dynamic model is used; also the simulated increase of crop water stress due to climate change is lower; in the example, the simulated increase is 15 percentage points less (of 55) than when a static model is used. The static/dynamic models also simulate different absolute values of the transpiration. The difference is most pronounced for potatoes at locations with ample moisture supply; this supply can either come from storage release of a good soil or from capillary rise. With good supply of moisture, the dynamic model simulates up to 10 % less actual evapotranspiration than the static one in the example. This can lead to cases where the dynamic model predicts a slight increase of the recharge in a climate scenario, where the static model predicts a decrease. The use of a dynamic model also affects the simulated demand for surface water from external sources; especially the timing is affected. The proposed modelling approach uses postulated relationships that require validation with controlled field trials.

It is a computer-based program that has been developed by United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA). Further interface of the model was done by CHI [33]. Since its first development, it has undergone various versions. The version {{used for this study}} is the 13 th version. PCSWMM is a model that simulates various components of hydrology and hydraulics such as runoff from rural and urban areas, rainfall <b>interception</b> in depression <b>storage,</b> percolation of infiltrated water into ground water layers [34]. It is very advanced in terms of working with GIS data and incorporates GIS engine for hydraulic modeling. The model is capable of illustrating results in one-dimensional (1 D) and two-dimensional (2 D).|$|R
40|$|Urban {{land cover}} is {{dominated}} by impervious surface that degrades both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems relative to predevelopment conditions. There are significant opportunities for designers of urban landscapes to use alternative land covers that have multiple functions, benefiting both human and nonhuman components of the urban ecosystem. Vegetated (green) roofs are one form of alternative land cover that has shown the potential to provide a variety of ecological benefits in urban areas. We evaluated how stormwater retention, building energy and temperature, and rooftop habitat {{are influenced by the}} use of green roofs using test plots in Georgia and Massachusetts. Green roofs were shown to recreate part of the predevelopment hydrology through increasing <b>interception,</b> stormwater <b>storage,</b> evaporation, and transpiration on the rooftop and worked extremely well for small storm events. Temperature reductions were found on the green rooftop as compared to an asphalt surface, although other roof technologies that minimize temperatures, such as lighter colored membranes, provide similar benefits. Novel habitat was created on the rooftop, although the extent of this habitat was limited in part by plant survivability and the need for additional water inputs for diverse plant communities to survive. Despite the challenges, the green roof benefits reported here suggest that green roofs can be used effectively as a multifunctional land cover in urban areas...|$|R
30|$|The {{main reason}} for reduced surface runoff in Eucalyptus {{plantations}} {{is believed to be}} canopy <b>interception</b> that leads <b>storage</b> and slowly movement of water in order to percolate to the ground. As the runoff study spatially limited to the local conditions, further multiple studies should be done. Otherwise, it could not be used to compare the results from different areas. In general, the expansion of Eucalyptus has no significant impact on surface runoff generation if it is expanded on previously grassland. However, it could also significantly reduce the surface runoff generated if it is planted on previously cultivated land. In addition, this study has also observed higher soil moisture under Eucalyptus woodlots than cultivated land. Depending the above observations, Eucalyptus can be used as area conservation tree, especially to reduce soil erosion by water, where high runoff recorded fields with consideration of tree planting spacing. The effect of proper Eucalyptus planting spacing and litter accumulation level on the runoff generation needs further studies in the country.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2008 MIKE SHE is a fully distributed, physically-based hydrologic {{model that}} can {{simulate}} water movement over {{and under the}} Earth's surface. Evapotranspiration (ET) {{is one of the}} components of this model. MIKE SHE uses a modification of the Kristensen -Jensen (1975) method to calculate actual ET. This method is based on addition of the three evapotranspiration components – <b>interception</b> <b>storage,</b> transpiration by the plant and evaporation from the soil surface, to compute total actual evapotranspiration. The validity of the Kristensen-Jensen method has been tested on an arid region within the Sprague River subbasin of the Upper Klamath basin in southern Oregon. The model was setup on a 1, 000 m by 1, 000 m flat surface as a one-dimensional grid cell. There are sixteen computation layers which make three soil profile layers with varying soil properties. Meteorological data from the Pacific Northwest Cooperative Agricultural Weather Network (AgriMet) were used to setup the model. Soil physical properties were taken from the Soil Survey Geographic (SSURGO) database of the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). Values of the van Genuchten parameters for soil water retention and hydraulic conductivity as a function of soil texture from Carsel and Parrish (1988) were applied. Wetland vegetation such as duckweed and cattail, natural vegetation such as big sagebrush, ponderosa pine and juniper, and agricultural crops such as grass pasture and maize were used to test MIKE SHE evapotranspiration simulation. The length of growth stage, crop coefficient, leaf area index (LAI) and root depth values were taken from the literature. Actual crop ET rates were calculated based on AgriMet reference ET which uses the Kimberly Penman (Wright, 1982) method. The alfalfa reference ET was converted to a grass reference by multiplying by a factor of 0. 833 (Jensen et al., 1990). The single crop coefficient method was used and soil stress was accounted for using the FAO 56 method (Allen et al, 1998). Simulated irrigation was applied to maize and grass to keep the root zone soil moisture close to field capacity. Crop ET rates from the MIKE SHE simulation were then compared to the AgriMet based ET rates, resulting in a comparison of Kristensen-Jensen method against the Kimberly Penman method. Both the Kristensen-Jensen and AgriMet simulation scenarios were driven by the same reference ET and the same FAO 56 basal crop coefficient. Differences are therefore a function of different methods for dealing with soil moisture stress. Results indicate that the MIKE SHE simulated evapotranspiration corresponds to the Kimberly Penman method for the duckweed and cattail wetlands species with resulting Nash and Sutcliffe (NS) efficiencies of 0. 97 and 1. 00, respectively. The big sagebrush, juniper, and ponderosa pine species required a soil stress correction factor for the crop coefficients and the results yielded NS efficiency values of 0. 14, 0. 59 and 0. 68, respectively. Irrigation was automatically turned on for maize at a 20 percent soil moisture deficit to minimize the effects of water stress and the resulting NS efficiency was 0. 85. For pasture, an irrigation based on average monthly water deficit for pasture in Klamath was used (Cuenca et al., 1992). This resulted in a NS efficiency of 0. 77. Each crop requires unique treatment within the model. Required vegetation parameters such as crop coefficient and LAI, climatic factors such as reference ET, and soil hydraulic properties need to be based on local conditions to the extent possible. It {{should be noted that the}} MIKE SHE simulations were run in a one-dimensional mode which precluded accounting for spatial variability or lateral flow of surface or groundwater. The simulation results indicate that converting the study area into a well irrigated pasture would require application of substantial amounts of irrigation water by sprinkler or flooding. Wetlands would require even more water to flood the land, but would be well suited for development of regional habitat. Big sagebrush, juniper and ponderosa pine survive under natural conditions but experience considerable plant stress brought on by soil water deficits which limit plant production below the maximum possible growth...|$|E
40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the degree of correlation between internal water potential of Engelmann spruce trees and selected environmental factors. The secondary objective of the study was to determine the effect of summer precipitation, both in meadow and forested sites, on the soil drying cycle. Four study plots (each roughly 154 square meters) under spruce cover and two study plots (100 square meters) in a small meadow were established. At each spruce plot, a thermocouple psychrometer was installed at one meter above the ground on the north side of three selected, mature Engelmann spruce trees. Thermocouple psychrometers were installed at 5, 15, and 30 cm depths in the soil at the meadow plots and at 15, 30, 45, and 90 cm depths at the spruce plots. A tensiometer and two soil temperature thermocouples were installed near the thermocouple psychrometers at each of the plots but at 15, 30, 45, and 90 cm soil depths. Throughfall gages were placed at each plot to obtain an estimate of rainfall which was not intercepted by the canopy but which fell to the forest floor. Gross precipitation was measured by a 20. 3 cm diameter recording gage located at the meadow. Global radiation and wind were recorded at the meadow area also. Air temperature and relative humidity were recorded in wooden shelters. One shelter was located at the meadow area and one was located in the vicinity of the four spruce plots. Except for wind, weather parameters were recorded continuously. Wind movement was totalized on a digital counter and recorded on data sheets when needed. Psychrometric, pressure chamber, and soil data were obtained according to two schedules. Diurnal measurements of trunk water potential in six trees and independent variables were made during seven days in the summer months of 1971. Seasonal measurements of trunk water potential in twelve trees and independent variables were done at periodic intervals during the summer averaging every three to four days. Data to evaluate the effect of summer precipitation on the soil drying cycle was obtained periodically the summer of 1970 and concurrently (for the most part) with tree water potential measurements during 1971. Significant findings of this study included the following: as shown by analyses of variation of the data, within-season variations of tree water potential (by psychrometer and pressure chamber measurements) were statistically significant. In other words, fluctuations in water potential with time were large enough that they could not have been due to chance alone. On an hourly basis for seven cycles of diurnal measurements, daily peaks in wind movement corresponded roughly with trunk water potential minima, peak radiation occurred about two hours before water potential minima, and maximum vapor pressure deficits corresponded closely to water potential minima. Diurnal fluctuations in water potential of small understory branches, as determined by the pressure chamber, did not correlate well with weather factors. Seasonally, trunk water potential appeared to be highly correlated with fluctuations in vapor pressure deficit and less correlated with global radiation and wind. Soil factors such as matric potential and temperature were not correlated with trunk water potential. Correlations between water potential determined by the pressure chamber and environmental factors were not consistent. Pressure chamber values of water potential, however, did correlate roughly with trunk water potential during the latter half of the summer of 1971. By multiple regression analysis, a predictive equation was devised to predict trunk water potential on a daily and on a seasonal basis. With diurnal input data, radiation, vapor pressure deficit, and a transformation of vapor pressure deficit were significant variables. The model explained 81 percent of the diurnal variation in trunk water potential. Evaluation of the model with seasonal data input showed only one variable, vapor pressure deficit, highly significant. With seasonal data, 72 percent of the variation in trunk water potential was explained. Analysis of 18 rainstorms which occurred during two summers of study showed that roughly 0. 25 cm of rain must fall before <b>interception</b> <b>storage</b> of a spruce canopy is satisfied and measurable amounts of rain can fall to the forest floor. Variability among sample catches of a given storm was great, apparently reflecting the irregular nature of the overmature spruce canopy. On the average, 96 percent of rainfall from storms between 0. 0 0 and 0. 13 cm, 70 percent between 0. 13 and 1. 3 cm, and 38 percent between 1. 3 and 2. 5 cm was intercepted. The influence of rain on soil matric potential was restricted to the first 45 cm of soil at the spruce plots with no substantial increase of matric potential before the onset of fall rains. The effect of rain on matric potential of soil in the meadow was more pronounced. The matric potential of the 5, 15, and 30 cm depths fluctuated greatly. A temporary increase in matric potential of these depths following summer storms was noted while more marked increases in matric potential were measured after heavier fall rains. The major conclusions made as a result of this study are (1) relative vapor pressure in the trunks of Engelmann spruce changes markedly from hour-to-hour and from day-to-day during the summer months, (2) trunk water potential as measured by thermocouple psychrometers is functionally related to atmospheric factors of radiation, wind, and vapor pressure deficit, (3) fluctuations in trunk water potential with weather factors imply a causal relation with transpiration, (4) precipitation during the summer months modifies soil matric potential-but only in the shallow profiles, (5) matric potential fluctuations in the meadow areas are extreme (from saturation to low as - 40 bars) and would impose a serious threat to the water economy of young Engelmann spruce seedlings established in such meadows, and (6) Peltier type thermocouple psychrometers are useful instruments for investigation of the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum in field situations...|$|E
40|$|Dynamic {{numerical}} {{models are}} powerful tools for representing and studying environmental processes through time. Usually they are constructed with environmental modelling languages, which are high-level programming languages that operate {{at the level}} of thinking of the scientists.

40|$|As a {{step toward}} {{simulating}} runoff from the entire Red Butte Creek (RBC) watershed, we use continuous precipitation-runoff simulation to prepare a hydrologic mass balance for the Lower Knowlton Fork (LKF) watershed, an RBC sub-watershed. The RBC watershed drains a narrow canyon with steep side walls. RBC flows southwest into the Jordan River, which drains into the Great Salt Lake. Formed from colluvium and alluvium derived from mixed sedimentary rocks, RBC soils are well-drained and have high infiltration rates. Some infiltrated water percolates and becomes groundwater. Groundwater that returns to Red Butte Creek increases the creek’s base flow. And ultimately affects Jordan River flow. RBC watershed elevations range from 1, 500 to 2, 524 m. Annual precipitation in all forms ranges from 50 cm at lower elevation to 90 cm at higher elevation. The proportion of precipitation falling as snow, the snow pack accumulation, {{and the impact of}} snow melt on runoff increase with elevation. Because the LKF watershed is the highest portion of the RBC watershed, it receives the most snow. We present an LKF mass balance between precipitation and its subsequent distribution as snow accumulation, snow melt, canopy <b>interception,</b> surface <b>storage,</b> evapotranspiration, and infiltration. Preparing the LKF mass balance, involves long-term simulations using the Hydrologic Engineering Center Hydrologic Modeling System (HEC-HMS 4. 1). For simulating loss, snowmelt, routing, transformation, base flow, and evapotranspiration, HEC-HMS uses these methods: soil moisture accounting (SMA), Temperature index (Degree-day), Muskingum, Clark unit hydrograph, linear recession, and Priestley Taylor, respectively. Preparing HEC-HMS input data involves using ArcGIS to extract soil and other property data from the Soil Survey Geographic Database (SSRUGO), and assuming parameters based upon watershed characteristics and seasonal variability. Calibration produces the set of parameter values that cause simulated values to match observed stream discharge and calculated snow water equivalent (SWE) ...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{effects of}} shrub {{clearing}} on surface and subsurface water {{movement in the}} Edwards Aquifer region were investigated using two large‐scale rainfall simulation plots. Multiple replications of a large (168 mm) rainfall event were applied at an ashe juniper covered plot before and after shrub removal and at a plot with longstanding herbaceous cover. The study sites were equipped for monitoring of throughfall, stemflow, surface runoff, and soil water. Lateral subsurface flow was measured in a trench at the downhill end of each plot. The canopy plot produced high lateral subsurface flow during rainfall but no surface runoff, even for high rainfall intensities. In contrast, hydrologic response at the inter‐canopy plot was dominated by rapid surface runoff. Following shrub removal at the canopy plot, water movement beyond the soil layer increased due to reduced canopy <b>interception.</b> Soil water <b>storage</b> capacity at the shrub plot remained small for both conditions, with much water apparently bypassing the litter and soil layers via macropore pathways. This additional water could move off site as macropore flow or remain on site as matrix and conduit storage. Differences in surface runoff and subsurfaceflow are attributable to vegetation and geologic differences...|$|R
