Some booktalkers may have a natural inclination for first-person booktalks, while others may present typical third-person book talks, or a book talk that's been digitally enhanced to keep the interest of the audience. The audience will also determine the length of the presentation, how many booktalks are presented, how much <b>information</b> <b>to</b> <b>disclose,</b> and the length of the individual booktalks.

40|$|Management Discussion and Analysis is a {{mandatory}} document under Italian law. In 2007, the Italian legislator issued Legislative Decree 32 / 2007, which broadened {{the information that}} firms have to provide in their MD&A. Italian companies have been required to prepare their MD&A according to these new requirements since the fiscal year 2008. The new art. 2428 of the Civil Code requires firms to discuss and analyze more topics, such as the principal risks and uncertainties that the company faces, financial and non-financial key performance indicators and information relating to environmental and personnel matters; however, the format for their presentation and the <b>information</b> <b>to</b> <b>disclose</b> for each topic continue to be deliberately not specified. This means that Italian firms can voluntarily decide both the <b>information</b> <b>to</b> <b>disclose</b> for each topic and how to present this information. As a consequence, {{it is possible to}} find great variety across firms and industries. To help firms in preparing their MD&A, in 2009 the Italian professional standard setter issued some more explicit guidance on the type of information a firm could discuss in its MD&A. This paper develops a framework for analyzing MD&A disclosures {{on the basis of the}} new legal requirements of art. 2428 of the Civil Code and the guidance issued by the Italian professional standard setter, and then investigates the content of the Italian companies’ MD&A disclosures provided for 2008, in order to verify the impact of new MD&A requirements on their disclosure behavior. Moreover, the paper investigates the relationship between the MD&A disclosures and properties of the analysts’ earnings forecasts, i. e. forecast accuracy and dispersion, in order to examine whether the information provided by Italian companies in their MD&A is useful for a specific category of financial statement users: financial analysts. The findings show that Italian companies responded in a positive way to the new legal requirements, but mainly with regard to the information concerning the review of the data contained in the financial statement. Moreover, the paper provides evidence that the level of MD&A disclosures is significantly and positively related to forecast accuracy. In particular, this result confirms that MD&A is an important determinant of the accuracy of analysts’ forecasts. The results enhance our understanding of the role of MD&A disclosures in the wide set of information that firms provide to financial statement users...|$|E

40|$|A {{current policy}} issue is whether, {{and if so}} under what circumstances, {{insurance}} companies should be given access to genetic test results. The insurance industry argues for mandatory disclosure {{in order to avoid}} problems of adverse selection; an alternative would be a moratorium or legislation preventing such disclosure; a third option a voluntary disclosure law. This paper investigates the impact of these policies on individuals incentives to both acquire genetic <b>information</b> and <b>to</b> <b>disclose</b> it <b>to</b> providers of health and/or life insurance. The theoretical framework used to inform this analysis is provided by the games of persuasion literature, in which one agent tries to influence another agent s decision by selectively withholding her private information regarding quality. The application of the theoretical framework to this policy context yields the following results. Individuals have the incentive <b>to</b> acquire genetic <b>information</b> and <b>to</b> <b>disclose</b> the test results if disclosure is voluntary. If, however, they are obliged <b>to</b> <b>disclose</b> the results of any genetic tests they have taken, their incentive may be not <b>to</b> acquire such <b>information.</b> I discuss the policy implications of these findings both {{from the point of view}} of the insurance industry and from a public health perspective. ...|$|R
40|$|We study a {{two-stage}} {{model in}} which the information processed by consumers at the first stage (advance-purchase stage) is endogenously determined. In the model, the firm decides whether to introduce an advance-purchase program, chooses what attribute <b>information</b> <b>to</b> <b>disclose</b> and determines an advance-purchase price and a retail price. Forward-looking consumers strategically choose, based on the disclosed information, to buy in advance or to make a purchase decision at the second stage (retail stage) when all information is revealed. We characterize the firm's optimal choice on the advance-purchase program and the strategy of information disclosure. In particular, we show that the firm always prefers to introduce the advance-purchase program except when underlying consumer preferences are extremely homogenous. In addition, we find that fully revealing horizontal product information at the advance-purchase stage is never optimal to the firm, but revealing either partial or no product information can be optimal depending on the underlying consumer preferences. Our finding that partial information disclosure is sometimes optimal to the firm {{is in contrast to}} the result in the literature of horizontal information provision that a firm maximizes profit by revealing either no or full information to consumers. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{exploration}} of the non-protein-coding RNA (ncRNA) transcriptome is currently focused on profiling of microRNA expression and detection of novel ncRNA transcription units. However, recent studies suggest that RNA processing can be a multi-layer process leading to the generation of ncRNAs of diverse functions from a single primary transcript. Up to date no methodology has been presented to distinguish stable functional RNA species from rapidly degraded side products of nucleases. Thus the correct assessment of widespread RNA processing events {{is one of the}} major obstacles in transcriptome research. Here, we present a novel automated computational pipeline, named APART, providing a complete workflow for the reliable detection of RNA processing products from next-generation-sequencing data. The major features include efficient handling of non-unique reads, detection of novel stable ncRNA transcripts and processing products and annotation of known transcripts based on multiple sources of <b>information.</b> <b>To</b> <b>disclose</b> the potential of APART, we have analyzed a cDNA library derived from small ribosome-associated RNAs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

40|$|This article aims at {{measuring}} recommendation {{value on}} the Tunisian market and uses a hand-collected database of 6646 recommendations (2005 – 2009).

We suggest that it is related to large (small) firms having more ‘buy’ (‘sell’) recommendations and to the direction of the market trend over the period.

40|$|A {{database}} view is {{a dynamic}} virtual table composed of the result set of a query, often executed over different underlying databases. The view maintenance problem concerns how a view is refreshed when the data sources are updated. We study the view maintenance problem when self-interested database managers from different institutions are involved, each concerned about the privacy of its database. We regard view maintenance as an incremental, sequential process where an action taken at a stage affects what happens at later stages. The contribution {{of this paper is}} twofold. First, we formulate the view maintenance problem as a sequential game of incomplete information where at every stage, each database manager decides what <b>information</b> <b>to</b> <b>disclose,</b> if any, without knowledge of the number or nature of updates at other managers. This allows us to adopt a satisficing approach where the final view need not reflect 100 % of the databases updates. Second, we present an anytime algorithm for calculating ɛ-Bayes-Nash equilibria that allows us to solve the large games which our problem translates to. Our algorithm is not restricted to games originating from the view maintenance problem; {{it can be used to}} solve general games of incomplete information. In addition, experimental results demonstrate our algorithm’s attractive anytime behavior, which allows it to find good-enough solutions to large games within reasonable amounts of time...|$|E

40|$|Physicians’ {{attitudes towards}} {{disclosure}} to patients of cancer diagnoses have changed from non-disclosure to full disclosure. Also disclosure of prognosis are likewise {{said to have}} changed, though not to the same degree. The overriding aim of this dissertation is to analyse information disclosed to patients with severe cancer prognoses, from a Swedish perspective, through two sets of interviews with patients and doctors. The aim of the first study (I) is to explore how the interviewed patients related to the information given them by their physicians. The second study (II) focuses how the information the patients received, concerning the severity of their illness, related to their awareness (or lack thereof). In the third study (III) conducted several years later, physicians were interviewed about what <b>information</b> <b>to</b> <b>disclose</b> to patient in (four) situations where relevant scientific knowledge is lacking or uncertain. In the fourth study (IV) the interviews, from both perspectives, were further analysed in order to explore, how the patient’s impending death is communicated. The main finding of these papers is the discrepancy there is between patients’ desires for honest information and physicians’ reluctance to prognosticate until patients have overt signs of approaching death. The conclusion of this thesis is that, as a rule, patients should be more and better informed about their prognoses, unless the patient is clearly opposed to receiving such information or otherwise not a suitable partner for dialogue...|$|E
40|$|An {{environmental}} accident at a Placer Dome {{mine in the}} Philippines provides the context for this event study. This accident triggered a contagion effect across the Canadian mining industry. The decline in equity prices was moderated by environmental information disclosed prior to the accident. There is {{evidence to support the}} interpretation by Blacconiere and Patten –in their 1994 study of the Union Carbide accident – that investors interpret environmental disclosure as a signal {{of the extent to which}} the company is managing environmental risks and costs. In this current research, however, the modifying effect of disclosure is limited to information on high- level commitment to environmental stewardship. This paper draws on legitimacy theory to explain the image companies wish to project to their external audience, and signal theory for insight into how managers decide what <b>information</b> <b>to</b> <b>disclose.</b> The paper extends prior research into signal theory by examining the association of the disclosed signal with actual environmental performance. The correlation of disclosure with the volume of National Pollutant Release Inventory emissions is negative, suggesting that companies with a high-level commitment are better environmental performers. The findings of this study are consistent with prior research that examines factors contributing to disclosure credibility.

40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. We study online {{learning}} strategies over distributed networks. Here, {{we have a}} distributed collection of agents with learning and cooperation capabilities. These agents observe a noisy version of a desired state of the nature through a linear model. The agents seek to learn this state by also interacting with each other yet the communication load plays significant role. To this end, we propose compressive diffusion strategies that extract the compressed information from the diffused data. Agents can compress the information into a scalar or a single bit, i. e., a substantial reduction in the communication load. Importantly, we show that agents can achieve a comparable performance to the conventional diffusion strategies that require the direct diffusion of information without compression and with infinite precision. We also examine which <b>information</b> <b>to</b> <b>disclose</b> and how to utilize them optimally in the mean-square-error (MSE) sense. Note that all the well-known distributed learning strategies achieve suboptimal learning performance in the MSE sense. Hence, we provide algorithms that achieve distributed minimum MSE (MMSE) performance over an arbitrary network topology based on the aggregation of information at each agent. This approach differs from the diffusion of information across network, i. e., exchange of local estimates. Notably, exchange of local estimates is sufficient only over the certain network topologies. For these networks, we also propose strategies that achieve the distributed MMSE performance through the diffusion of information. Hence, we can substantially reduce the communication load while achieving the best possible MSE performance. Finally, for practical implementations we provide approaches to reduce {{the complexity of the}} algorithms through the time-windowing of the observations. Sayın, Muhammed ÖmerM. S...|$|E
