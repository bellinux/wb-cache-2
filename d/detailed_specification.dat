5|$|There {{has been}} {{controversy}} over the contract between the MWAA and Dulles Transit Partners, which consists of Bechtel and Washington Group International. The $2.7 billion project was originally awarded by VDOT under the Virginia Public-Private Partnership Act, rather than by using conventional competitive bidding based upon a <b>detailed</b> <b>specification.</b> As a result, the contractor is allowed to both design and build the project with no upper cap on its cost. Problems could arise from the arrangement where MWAA is supervising the design and construction but ultimately WMATA must operate the Silver Line. The contract provides for price escalation of $3 million to $6 million a month for delays. VDOT transferred the contract to MWAA when MWAA took over the project in November 2008.|$|E

Construction of the Senedd ended on 7 February 2006 when the National Assembly {{took control of the}} building. The project was six months late, due to the National Assembly not producing a <b>detailed</b> <b>specification</b> on time. The 10-year ICT contract, known as Merlin, was between the National Assembly and Siemens Business Services Ltd, now known as Siemens IT Solutions and Services. Other subcontractors on the project included Arup (structural engineers), BDSP Partnership and MJN Colston (services engineers), and BCL Timber Projects (timber ceiling).|$|E

The empirical estimates show that, irrespective of the precise functional form adopted, these <b>detailed</b> <b>specifications,</b> particularly those for output heterogeneity, are critical determinants of the performance of plant-level production functions. When the most detailed input and output specifications are used, 95 % of the observed variation in plant production is explained. However, when the eleven firms are treated as an industry, less <b>detailed</b> <b>specifications</b> for inputs and outputs are shown to be more appropriate for explaining the variation in industry production. ...|$|R
