5|$|Decimal {{fractions}} can {{be added}} by a simple modification of the above process. One aligns two decimal fractions above each other, with the <b>decimal</b> <b>point</b> in the same location. If necessary, one can add trailing zeros to a shorter decimal {{to make it the}} same length as the longer decimal. Finally, one performs the same addition process as above, except the <b>decimal</b> <b>point</b> is placed in the answer, exactly where it was placed in the summands.|$|E

5|$|As well as four-function arithmetic, the Executive had {{the ability}} to compute squares, reciprocals, and {{multiply}} or divide by a fixed constant. The Executive could carry out sums to two, four or six decimal places, or use a floating <b>decimal</b> <b>point.</b>|$|E
50|$|Where <b>decimal</b> <b>points</b> are assumed, {{they are}} leading <b>decimal</b> <b>points.</b> The last two symbols in Fields 10 and 11 {{of the first}} line give powers of 10 {{to apply to the}} {{preceding}} decimal. Thus, for example, Field 11 (-11606-4) translates to -0.11606E-4 (-0.11606×10−4).|$|R

5|$|Visible light waves {{oscillate}} {{faster than}} microwaves, and therefore optical clocks {{can be more}} precise than caesium atomic clocks. The Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt is working on several such optical clocks. The model with one single ytterbium ion caught in an ion trap is highly accurate. The optical clock based on it is exact to 17 digits after the <b>decimal</b> <b>point.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Sovereign came in satin chrome and {{gold-plated}} models, {{with leather}} pouches and fitted wooden cases. It had an 8-digit seven-segment display that used red light-emitting diodes, with a <b>decimal</b> <b>point</b> {{to the right}} of each digit that could be illuminated as necessary. Power was provided by two 1.35 mercury button cells. The Sovereign measured , which made it small and sleek compared to other calculators of the time.|$|E
5|$|To fit {{the program}} into the 320 words {{available}} on the chip, some significant modification was used. By not using regular floating point numbers, which require lots of instructions to keep the <b>decimal</b> <b>point</b> in the right place, some space was freed up. Trigonometric functions were implemented in about 40 instructions, and inverse trigonometric functions are almost 30 more instructions. Logarithms are about 40 instructions, with anti-log about 20 on top of that. The code to normalize and display the computed values are roughly the same in both the TI and Sinclair programs.|$|E

25|$|Write the {{original}} number in decimal form. The numbers are written {{similar to the}} long division algorithm, and, as in long division, the root will be written on the line above. Now separate the digits into groups of digits equating to the root being taken, starting from the <b>decimal</b> <b>point</b> and going both left and right. The <b>decimal</b> <b>point</b> of the root will be above the <b>decimal</b> <b>point</b> of the square. One digit of the root will appear above each group of digits of {{the original}} number.|$|E
25|$|To {{change a}} decimal to a fraction, {{write in the}} {{denominator}} a 1 followed by as many zeroes as there are digits {{to the right of}} the <b>decimal</b> <b>point,</b> and write in the numerator all the digits in the original decimal, omitting the <b>decimal</b> <b>point.</b> Thus 12.3456 = 123456/10000.|$|E

25|$|Tests ridden at the Olympic Games are {{scored by}} a panel of seven {{international}} judges. Each movement in each test receives a numeric score from 0 (lowest) to 10 (highest) and the resulting final score is then converted into a percentage, which is carried out to three <b>decimal</b> <b>points.</b> The higher the percentage, the higher the score. However, in eventing dressage the score is calculated by dividing the number of points achieved by the total possible points, then multiplied by 100 (rounded to 2 <b>decimal</b> <b>points)</b> and subtracted from 100. Thus, a lower score is better than a higher score.|$|R

25|$|A {{long-lasting}} persistent myth is that spinach contains {{significantly more}} iron than other green vegetables.

25|$|The {{resolution}} of a multimeter is often {{specified in the}} number of decimal digits resolved and displayed. If the most significant digit cannot take all values from 0 to 9 it is generally, and confusingly, termed a fractional digit.
