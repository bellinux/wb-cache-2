5|$|Concert {{promoter}} AEG Live {{has faced}} criticism since the film's confirmation, {{largely in the}} form of accusations that the film was made simply for profit. Multiple members of Jackson's family refused to support the film, and some family members even attempted to stop the film agreement in August 2009. In the same month, however, a judge approved a deal between Jackson's estate, AEG Live, and Columbia Pictures. The agreement allowed Columbia to edit the <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>hours</b> of rehearsal footage needed to create the film. Columbia subsequently paid $60 million for the film rights.|$|E
5|$|Hale {{had spent}} many <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>hours</b> searching for comets without success, and was {{tracking}} known comets from his driveway in New Mexico when he chanced upon Hale–Bopp just after midnight. The comet had an apparent magnitude of 10.5 and lay near the globular cluster M70 {{in the constellation}} of Sagittarius. Hale first established {{that there was no}} other deep-sky object near M70, and then consulted a directory of known comets, finding that none were known to be in this area of the sky. Once he had established that the object was moving relative to the background stars, he emailed the Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams, the clearing house for astronomical discoveries.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} create an RPG that would appeal to a wide {{audience}} unfamiliar with the genre, and video games in general, Horii {{wanted to create a}} new kind of RPG that did not rely on previous experience with the Dungeons & Dragons tabletop RPG, did not require <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>hours</b> of rote fighting, and could appeal to any kind of gamer. To accomplish this he needed to simplify the system and have players associate themselves with the hero. Thus as the game progressed, the hero would become stronger, in contrast to games like Super Mario Bros. where the character Mario did not become progressively more powerful during the game. He wanted to build on Portopia and place a greater emphasis on storytelling and emotional involvement. He developed a coming-of-age tale that audiences could relate to and made use of RPG level-building gameplay as a way to represent this.|$|E

5|$|Argentina {{suffered}} {{a terrorist attack}} in 1994, the AMIA bombing targeting a Buenos Aires Jewish center, that killed 85 people and wounded 300. The investigation remained open for years, and prosecutor Alberto Nisman {{was appointed to the}} case. He accused Iran of organizing the attack, and the Hezbollah group of carrying it out. He intended to prosecute five Iranian officials, including former Iranian president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, but Argentina signed a memorandum of understanding with Iran for a joint investigation. Nisman accused the president of signing that memorandum for oil and trade benefits, according to <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>hours</b> of wiretaps. On 19 January 2015 he was found dead at his home, a day before a congressional hearing to explain his accusation, which caused a great controversy. As of 2016, both the cases of the AMIA bombing and the death of Nisman remain unresolved, and the courts declined at the time to investigate his denunciation of Kirchner.|$|E

Another built a replica of a mole rat burrow in a horizontally mounted wheel, so that as the mole rat ran along the tunnel, the wheel could be spun to keep the animal adjacent to the camera. To illustrate the motion of bats' wings in flight, a slow motion sequence was filmed in a wind tunnel. The series {{was also the first}} to include footage of a live (although dying) coelacanth.|$|E
25|$|One of the Europeans, a Mr Tross, {{encouraged}} the young Baloo to bowl {{to him in}} the nets.

25|$|Inspired by Hitchcock's Psycho, Morris visited Plainfield, Wisconsin in 1975. While in Wisconsin, he {{conducted}} multiple interviews with Ed Gein, the infamous serial killer who resided at Mendota State Hospital in Madison. He later made plans with German film director Werner Herzog, whom Tom Luddy had introduced to Morris, {{to return in}} the summer of 1975 to secretly open the grave of Gein's mother to test their theory that Gein himself had already dug her up. Herzog arrived on schedule, but Morris had second thoughts and was not there. Herzog did not open the grave. Morris later returned to Plainfield, this time staying for almost a year, conducting <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>hours</b> of interviews.

40|$|We derive {{analytic}} expressions, and approximate them {{in closed}} form, for the effective detection aperture for Cerenkov radio emission from ultra-high-energy neutrinos striking the Moon. The resulting apertures {{are in good}} agreement with recent Monte Carlo simulations and support the conclusion of James & Protheroe (2009) that neutrino flux upper limits derived from the GLUE search (Gorham et al. 2004) were too low by an order of magnitude. We also use our analytic expressions to derive scaling laws for the aperture {{as a function of}} observational and lunar parameters. We find that at low frequencies downward-directed neutrinos always dominate, but at higher frequencies, the contribution from upward-directed neutrinos becomes increasingly important, especially at low neutrino energies. Detecting neutrinos from Earth near the GZK regime will likely require radio telescope arrays with extremely large collecting area and <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> exposure time. Higher energy neutrinos are most easily detected using lower frequencies. Lunar surface roughness is a decisive factor for obtaining detections at higher frequencies and higher energies.

25|$|The {{first stage}} of the process is the {{scanning}} of the film negatives or prints into a digital picture and sound raw format. Depending on the film's condition, it may undergo a physical cleaning before the scanning could begin. The scanned materials will then undergo an automated and a painstaking frame by frame digital restoration process. The process involves the digital removal of dirt, scratches, fingerprints, discolorations, molds, tape marks, and other damages in the scanned materials. The process also involves the correction of color, brightness, and contrast into its original form often consulting the original cinematographers of each films whenever possible. Subtitles and watermarks, if present, are also remove in the process. The process also involves the restoration and remastering of sound.

25|$|In 1985, Yuji Horii and {{his team}} at Chunsoft began {{production}} on Dragon Quest (Dragon Warrior). After Enix published the game in early 1986, it became the template for future console RPGs. The game {{was influenced by the}} first-person random battles in Wizardry, the overhead movement in , and the mystery storytelling in Horii's own 1983 visual novel game Portopia Serial Murder Case. Horii's intention behind Dragon Quest was to create a RPG that appeals to a wider audience unfamiliar with the genre or video games in general. This required {{the creation of a new}} kind of RPG, that didn't rely on previous D experience, didn't require <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>hours</b> of rote fighting, and that could appeal to any kind of gamer. Compared to statistics-heavy computer RPGs, Dragon Quest was a more streamlined, faster-paced game based on exploration and combat, and featured a top-down view in dungeons, in contrast to the first-person view used for dungeons in earlier computer RPGs. The streamlined gameplay of Dragon Quest thus made the game more accessible to a wider audience than previous computer RPGs. The game also placed a greater emphasis on storytelling and emotional involvement, building on Horii's previous work Portopia Serial Murder Case, but this time introducing a coming of age tale for Dragon Quest that audiences could relate to, making use of the RPG level-building gameplay as a way to represent this. It also featured elements still found in most console RPGs, like major quests interwoven with minor subquests, an incremental spell system, the damsel-in-distress storyline that many RPGs follow, and a romance element that remains a staple of the genre, alongside anime-style art by Akira Toriyama and a classical score by Koichi Sugiyama that was considered revolutionary for console video game music.|$|E
