25|$|The term kelp {{refers to}} marine algae {{belonging}} to the order Laminariales (phylum: Heterokontophyta). Though not considered a taxonomically diverse order, <b>kelps</b> are highly diverse structurally and functionally. The most widely recognized species are the giant <b>kelps</b> (Macrocystis spp.), although numerous other genera such as Laminaria, Ecklonia, Lessonia, Alaria, and Eisenia are described.|$|E
25|$|Prostrate <b>kelps</b> lie {{near and}} along the sea floor (e.g., Laminaria).|$|E
25|$|Canopy <b>kelps</b> {{include the}} largest species and often {{constitute}} floating canopies that {{extend to the}} ocean surface (e.g., Macrocystis and Alaria).|$|E
5000|$|<b>Kelp</b> {{forests are}} {{underwater}} areas {{with a high}} density of <b>kelp.</b> They form {{some of the most}} productive and dynamic ecosystems on Earth. [...] Smaller areas of anchored <b>kelp</b> are called <b>kelp</b> beds. <b>Kelp</b> forests occur worldwide throughout temperate and polar coastal oceans.|$|R
50|$|Many {{different}} species of fish rely on the <b>kelp</b> forests {{as a source of}} life. Populations of fish are larger in areas with a higher concentration of <b>kelp.</b> Fish that live in and rely on <b>kelp</b> forests include <b>kelp</b> surfperch (Brachyistius frenatus), <b>kelp</b> bass (Paralabrax clathratus), giant kelpfish (Heterostichus rostratus), and <b>kelp</b> rockfish (Sebastes atrovirens). A study conducted near San Luis Obispo, California showed that when <b>kelp</b> was removed from a nearby reef, fish biomass declined by 63%. Juvenile fish rely on <b>kelp</b> beds a nursery grounds. Southern California Edison built a 174 acre off San Clemente in 2008.|$|R
40|$|<b>Kelp</b> {{are large}} {{seaweeds}} in the Order Laminariales. Twenty-six species of <b>kelp</b> grow along Washington State’s shorelines, making Washington {{one of the}} sites of highest <b>kelp</b> diversity in the world (Gabrielson et al, 2000). <b>Kelp</b> beds support commercial and sport fish, invertebrates, marine mammals and marine birds (Dayton 1985, Duggins et al. 1989). Many factors, both natural and anthropogenic, affect the extent and composition of these important nearshore habitats (Duggins 1980, Dayton and Tegner 1984, Foster and Schiel 1985). <b>Kelp</b> species can be grouped based on their growth forms: canopy-forming <b>kelp</b> produces buoyant bulbs and blades that {{spread out on the}} water surface, while understory <b>kelp</b> canopies extend horizontally near the bottom. There is a gradient in the occurrence of <b>kelp</b> in Puget Sound due to natural environmental conditions (Figure 1). <b>Kelp</b> is most common in rocky, high energy environments, with greatest abundance in the San Juan Archipelago and the Strait of Juan de Fuca. <b>Kelp</b> beds gradually decrease in size and frequency in central and southern Puget Sound. <b>Kelp</b> is uncommon in Hood Canal.

25|$|Stipitate <b>kelps</b> {{generally}} {{extend a}} few meters above the sea floor and can grow in dense aggregations (e.g., Eisenia and Ecklonia).|$|E
25|$|<b>Kelps</b> are {{primarily}} associated with temperate and arctic waters worldwide. Of the more dominant genera, Laminaria is mainly associated {{with both sides}} of the Atlantic Ocean and the coasts of China and Japan; Ecklonia is found in Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa; and Macrocystis occurs throughout the northeastern and southeastern Pacific Ocean, Southern Ocean archipelagos, and in patches around Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. The region with the greatest diversity of <b>kelps</b> (>20 species) is the northeastern Pacific, from north of San Francisco, California, to the Aleutian Islands, Alaska.|$|E
25|$|Another {{potential}} benefit of facilitation is insulation from competitive interactions. Like the now familiar example of nurse plants in harsh environments, nurse logs {{in a forest}} are sites of increased seed germination and seedling survival because the raised substrate of a log frees seedlings from competition with plants and mosses on the forest floor. The crab-coral interaction described above is also an example of refuge from competition, since the herbivory of crabs on seaweed reduces competition between coral and seaweed. Similarly, herbivory by sea urchins (Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis) on <b>kelps</b> (Laminaria spp.) can protect mussels (Modiolus modiolus) from overgrowth by <b>kelps</b> competing for space in the subtidal zone of the Gulf of Maine, USA.|$|E

The Romans introduced the consumption of wine and olive oil.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to these exposure stresses (temperature, desiccation, and salinity), intertidal organisms experience strong mechanical stresses, especially in locations of high wave action. There are myriad {{ways in which the}} organisms prevent dislodgement due to waves. Morphologically, many mollusks (such as limpets and chitons) have low-profile, hydrodynamic shells. Types of substrate attachments include mussels' tethering byssal threads and glues, sea stars' thousands of suctioning tube feet, and isopods' hook-like appendages that help them hold on to intertidal <b>kelps.</b> Higher profile organisms, such as <b>kelps,</b> must also avoid breaking in high flow locations, and they do so with their strength and flexibility. Finally, organisms can also avoid high flow environments, such as by seeking out low flow microhabitats. Additional forms of mechanical stresses include ice and sand scour, as well as dislodgment by water-borne rocks, logs, etc.|$|E
25|$|Multiple kelp species often co-exist {{within a}} forest; the term {{understory}} canopy {{refers to the}} stipitate and prostrate <b>kelps.</b> For example, a Macrocystis canopy may extend many meters above the seafloor towards the ocean surface, while an understory of the <b>kelps</b> Eisenia and Pterygophora reaches upward only a few meters. Beneath these <b>kelps,</b> a benthic assemblage of foliose red algae may occur. The dense vertical infrastructure with overlying canopy forms a system of microenvironments similar to those observed in a terrestrial forest, with a sunny canopy region, a partially shaded middle, and darkened seafloor. Each guild has associated organisms, which vary in their levels of dependence on the habitat, and the assemblage of these organisms can vary with kelp morphologies. For example, in California, Macrocystis pyrifera forests, the nudibranch Melibe leonina, and skeleton shrimp Caprella californica are closely associated with surface canopies; the kelp perch Brachyistius frenatus, rockfish Sebastes spp., and many other fishes are found within the stipitate understory; brittle stars and turban snails Tegula spp. are {{closely associated with the}} kelp holdfast, while various herbivores, such as sea urchins and abalone, live under the prostrate canopy; many seastars, hydroids, and benthic fishes live among the benthic assemblages; solitary corals, various gastropods, and echinoderms live over the encrusting coralline algae. In addition, pelagic fishes and marine mammals are loosely associated with kelp forests, usually interacting near the edges as they visit to feed on resident organisms.|$|E
40|$|<b>Kelp</b> {{forests are}} highly {{valuable}} <b>Kelp</b> forests are very productive marine ecosystem with high species diversity. They {{are located in}} many parts of the world, including off the coast of California. <b>Kelp</b> forests are a major contributor to atmospheric carbon sequestration (storage) on the North American Pacific Coast.

40|$|Sustainable {{management}} of the <b>kelp</b> forests of the Shiretoko Peninsula, a World Natural Heritage site, is necessary due to <b>kelp's</b> ecological and economic importance. The objectives {{of this study were}} to estimate the area of <b>kelp</b> forests and to clarify their spatial characteristics in coastal waters of the Shiretoko Peninsula. Data on the presence/absence and thickness of <b>kelp</b> forests were collected via acoustic observation on transects over about 80 km using an echosounder at 200 kHz.

25|$|Catastrophic storms {{can remove}} surface kelp {{canopies}} through wave activity, but usually leave understory <b>kelps</b> intact; {{they can also}} remove urchins when little spatial refuge is available. Interspersed canopy clearings create a seascape mosaic where sunlight penetrates deeper into the kelp forest and species that are normally light-limited in the understory can flourish. Similarly, substrate cleared of kelp holdfasts can provide space for other sessile species to establish themselves and occupy the seafloor, sometimes directly competing with juvenile kelp and even inhibiting their settlement.|$|E
25|$|During tidal immersion, {{the food}} supply to {{intertidal}} organisms is subsidized by materials carried in seawater, including photosynthesizing phytoplankton and consumer zooplankton. These plankton are eaten by numerous forms of filter feeders—mussels, clams, barnacles, sea squirts, and polychaete worms—which filter seawater {{in their search for}} planktonic food sources. The adjacent ocean is also a primary source of nutrients for autotrophs, photosynthesizing producers ranging in size from microscopic algae (e.g. benthic diatoms) to huge <b>kelps</b> and other seaweeds. These intertidal producers are eaten by herbivorous grazers, such as limpets that scrape rocks clean of their diatom layer and kelp crabs that creep along blades of the feather boa kelp Egregia eating the tiny leaf-shaped bladelets. Crabs are eaten by goliath grouper, which are then eaten by sharks. Higher up the food web, predatory consumers—especially voracious starfish—eat other grazers (e.g. snails) and filter feeders (e.g. mussels). Finally, scavengers, including crabs and sand fleas, eat dead organic material, including dead producers and consumers.|$|E
500|$|The {{marine waters}} around the {{province}} are considered boreal, or sub-Arctic, in nature. [...] A {{great deal of}} the coastline is rock-strewn, allowing an extensive variety of plant and animal life to thrive. The leading plants of the shoreline are the large brown seaweeds, such as bladder, forked and knotted Wracks, and winged and sugar <b>kelps,</b> though there are also a number of red and green seaweeds present. Common animals of the seashore region include barnacles, [...] tortoiseshell limpet, common periwinkle, blue mussels, sea anemones, sea slugs, sea urchins, starfish, and rock crabs. The deeper waters are home to a variety of fish, such as Atlantic cod, sculpins and cunners, halibut, haddock, sharks, and marine mammals, such as dolphins, porpoises, and whales. Whales seen off Newfoundland include Pilot whales, minkes, sei whales, fin whales and humpbacks. Harp and hooded seals are usually found in the spring, giving birth to their young on coastal ice floes.|$|E

2500|$|Although kelp {{forests are}} unknown in {{tropical}} surface waters, a few species of Laminaria {{have been known}} to occur exclusively in tropical deep waters. This general absence of kelp from the tropics is believed to be mostly due to insufficient nutrient levels associated with warm, oligotrophic waters. One recent study spatially overlaid the requisite physical parameters for kelp with mean oceanographic conditions has produced a model predicting the existence of subsurface <b>kelps</b> throughout the tropics worldwide to depths of 200 m. For a hotspot in the Galapagos Islands, the local model was improved with fine-scale data and tested; the research team found thriving kelp forests in all eight of their sampled sites, all of which had been predicted by the model, thus validated their approach. This suggests that their global model might actually be fairly accurate, and if so, kelp forests would be prolific in tropical subsurface waters worldwide. The importance of this contribution has been rapidly acknowledged within the scientific community and has prompted an entirely new trajectory of kelp forest research, particularly emphasizing the potential for a spatial refuge from climate change also the [...] explanations to evolutionary patterns of <b>kelps</b> worldwide.|$|E
