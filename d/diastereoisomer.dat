Next, displacement with propargyl {{alcohol in the}} presence of zinc chloride gives predominanntly the stereochemistry represented by <b>diastereoisomer</b> 3. The side chain is protected as the phenylacetylamide; the triple bond is partially reduced with a 5% Pd-CaCO3 (Lindlar catalyst) and then epoxidized with mCPBA to give 4. The epoxide is opened at the least hindered end with 1-methyl-1H-tetrazole-5-thiol to put in place the future C-3 side chain and give intermediate 5. Jones oxidation followed in turn by ozonolysis (reductive work-up with zinc-AcOH) and reaction with SOCl2 and pyridine give halide 6. The stage is now wet for intramolecular Wittig reaction. Displacement with PPh3 and Wittig olefination gives 1-oxacephem 7. Next a sequence is undertaken of side chain exchange and introduction of a 7-methoxyl group analogous to that which is present in cephamycins and gives them the enhanced beta-lactamase stability. First 7 is converted to the imino chloride with PCl5 and then to the imino methyl ether (with methanol) and next hydrolyzed to the free amine (8). Imine formation with 3,5-di-t-butyl-4-hydroxybenzaldehyde is next carried out leading to 9. Oxidation with nickel peroxide gives iminoquinone methide 10, to which methanol is added in a conjugate sense and in the sterechemistry represented by formula 11. The imine is exchanged with Girard's reagent T to give 12, and this is acylated by a suitable protected arylmalonate, as the hemiester hemiacid chloride so as to give 11.
