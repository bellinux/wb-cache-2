The {{study was conducted}} in five villages namely Kilimani, Mhekela, Tukuzi, Burma and Mateka. The main objective {{of the study was to}} evaluate the efficiency; effectiveness and sustainability of Heifer Intrust Project in Mbinga Diocese. The specific objectives were to determine the efficiency and effectiveness of the project; economic contribution of the project to both men and women involved; to examine smallholder farmers' perception to the project and to identify the evolvement of gender roles, responsibilities and ownership in sustainable development of Heifer Intrust Project. The study comprised a random sample of 50 project farmers, 25 non-project farmers and 17 key informants. Thus involved 92 respondents, (23 women and 69 men). Primary data were obtained through personal observation, administering of structured questionnaire and focus group discussion. Secondary data was obtained from diocese office, district agriculture/livestock office, Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU) /Open University of, Tanzania (OUT) library as well as Sokoine National Agriculture Library (SNAL). Descriptive statistics as frequencies and percentage were used in analysis. The results from this study showed that an introduction of improved dairy cattle through Heifer In trust Project (HIP) not only have positive impact on incomes of households and food security but have also social and environmental impact. Livestock play diverse economic and social roles in the economy of household in the study area. They produce milk for subsistence, supply manure for cropping and sales of livestock and milk provide farmers with cash to purchase household necessities and farm inputs. The Project, increased material assets and financial ability to meet various social services after the introduction of improved diary cattle. As far as gender roles and responsibilities in HIP are concerned, there is a clear division of labour, access and control of resources in study villages. Farmers' accept HIP as a beneficial project to them and the components of the project has great influence and contribute significantly on poverty reduction process. The major conclusion is that the project has contributed a lot to poverty alleviation in the study area and is sustainable. Therefore, it is recommended that similar development projects be promoted in other villages but attempts should be made to make sure that they target poor strata, especially women. The major constraints to the implementation of HIP were found to be high input prices, low priced produce, lack of credit facilities, shortage of extension services and unreliable input supply. The study identifies several possible research areas. It is therefore recommended that, further research include more focused studies in connection with labour demand by season and division of labour by gender as well as assessment of demand and marketing system for diary products.

The earliest date attested for hexadecimal in Merriam-Webster Collegiate online is 1954, placing it safely {{in the category of}} international scientific vocabulary (ISV). It is common in ISV to mix Greek and Latin combining forms freely. The word sexagesimal (for base 60) retains the Latin prefix. Donald Knuth has pointed out that the etymologically correct term is senidenary (or possibly, sedenary), from the Latin term for grouped by 16. (The terms binary, ternary and quaternary are from the same Latin construction, and the etymologically correct terms for decimal and octal arithmetic are <b>denary</b> and octonary, respectively.) Alfred B. Taylor used senidenary in his mid-1800s work on alternative number bases, although he rejected base 16 because of its [...] "incommodious number of digits". Schwartzman notes that the expected form from usual Latin phrasing would be sexadecimal, but computer hackers would be tempted to shorten that word to sex.

40|$|The Chinese {{traditional}} chrysanthemum is {{a notable}} group of chrysanthemums (Chrysanthemum 6 morifolium Ramat.) {{in which the}} phenotypic characteristics richly vary. At present, {{there is a serious}} controversy regarding homonyms and synonyms within this group. Moreover, the current international chrysanthemum classification systems are not comprehensive enough to be used on Chinese traditional chrysanthemums. Thus, we first identified a broad collection of 480 Chinese traditional chrysanthemum cultivars using the unique DNA fingerprints and molecular identities that were established by 20 simple sequence repeat markers. Five loci, which distinguished all of the selected cultivars, were identified as the core loci to establish unique fingerprints and molecular identities with 19 <b>denary</b> digits for each cultivar. A cluster analysis based on Nei’s genetic distance indicated that the selected cultivars were clustered according to their horticultural classification. Population structure analysis was subsequently performed with K values ranging from 2 to 14, and the most likely estimate for the population structure was ten subpopulations, which was nearly consistent with the clustering result. Principal component analysis was further performed to verify the classification results. On the basis of the Q-matrices of K = 10, a total of 19 traits were found to be associated with 42 markers. Taken together, these results can serve as starting points for the identification and classification of chrysanthemums based on the polymorphism of microsatellite markers, which is beneficial to promote the marker-assisted breeding and international communication of this marvelous crop...|$|E
40|$|Let x denote a {{positive}} integer, {{written in the}} ordinary <b>denary</b> form, and define its palindromic inverse x T to be the integer obtained from x by writing its digits in reverse order. We ignore leading zeros so that both 1234 and 12340 have palindromic inverse 4321. A number is called a palindrome if x = x f. Similar definitions apply to bases other than 10. A notorious problem concerns palindromic sums [3]. From any starting point Xi we form a sequence inductively by x^+i = Xy. + x £, {{and the question is}} whether one always arrives at a palindrome. A negative answer is conjectured, and specifically that for Xi = 196 a palindrome is never reached. Although this problem is unsolved, the conjecture is known to be correct for base 2 [2]. The problem, however, is somewhat artificial since the property of being a palindrome will not persist throughout the iteration even if ever attained. We consider here the problem of taking palindromic differences; starting with X define x x fe + l k ^kl inductively. In this case, if xk were a palindrome, all its successors would vanish, and the first question that arises is whether this always occurs. This problem has been considered previously (see [1], [4], [5]). Clearly, if X has only one digit, then x 2 - 0, and if Xi has two digits, then x 2 will have at most two digits and be divisible by 9. If x 2 = 9 or 99, then # 3 = 0, whereas all other cases do eventually reach zero, as the sequenc...|$|E

Most recently, David W. Pankenier has offered that the archaic dating cycles of ten and twelve members known respectively as the Ti 2 ̆ 6 amacr;n G 2 ̆ 6 amacr;n (2 ̆ 2 Heavenly Stems 2 ̆ 2) and Dì Zh 2 ̆ 6 imacr; (2 ̆ 2 Earthly Branches 2 ̆ 2) constituted some portion of the orthography 2 ̆ 7 s ultimate developmental core: he suggests most generally that these two sequences, lying at the heart of Sh 2 ̆ 6 amacr;ng-era cultic and calendrical practice, may have been devised in relation to early astro-calendrical concerns. Previous attempts by the current author to elaborate both Pankenier 2 ̆ 7 s general idea and his more specific proposal of a stellar D 2 ̆ 6 imacr;ng, fourth of the <b>denary</b> Stems, may indicate that the twenty-two calendrical signs were indeed first conceived in representation of highly particular astronomical constructs—asterisms proximate to the ecliptic and lunar phases—instrumental in prehistoric Chinese steps towards the reification and organization of time and the cosmos. ^ This dissertation moves to extend the same investigation, again primarily by the methodologies of paleography and of historical linguistics. Chapter 1 introduces general issues—spoken word, written symbol and the early and fluid interaction of these two domains in relation to early cosmological conceptions—by reference to the glyph 〈[Special character omitted. ]〉 and an associated word huáng 2 ̆ 7 jade ring 2 ̆ 7 which found at an early date metaphorical reapplication to the diurnal and annual circuits of the sun. Chapter 2 turns to consider the origins of the glyph, writing most typically the word xià 2 ̆ 7 summer 2 ̆ 7 and suggested as first depicting the key element of an early delineation of the northern circumpolar region of the celestial sphere into 2 ̆ 2 seasonal 2 ̆ 2 deific components.

In 1989 a smaller scaleresearch has been made in that object. The excavated material showed that this was a prehistoric sitethat had been occupied in early and late Neolithic. In the year of 2003 the Archaeological Museum in Split started with the systematic archaeologicalresearch in this cave, and held two campaigns (2003 and 2005). At first two coins, and later 107 coinswere found in {{the last days of the}} research of the first campaign, in the soil from the eastern profile ofthe Probe 1 (picture 5). Substantial devastations happened in 2004 in the cave, especially in the Probe 1 at the east side where in January 2005 the following 107 coins were found in the collapsed parts ofthe probe. So far we can state that a hoard exists in the Turska peć cave and it consist of 216 coins. 154 examples have been typologically analysed. The rest of the examples were so glued togetherthat they could not be separated. The hoard of Turska peć consists of the coins of the cities of Verona– 1 example, Venice – 8 examples and Split – 145 examples (graph 1). The earliest examples coming from this hoard (cat. no. 1 - 8) belong to the Venetian silver denarithat were minted in Venice at the period of Dukes Orio Malipiero (1178 – 1192) and Enrico Dandolo(1192 – 1205). Other examples of the coins belonging to these dukes come from the hoards fromČiovo, Trilj and Nerežišća. Next in time-scale is a silver denar of the city of Verona (cat. no. 9). These coins were mintedduring the rule of the emperor Friedrich II of Schwabia (1218 – 1250). Other examples of these coinswere preserved in the hoards from Trilj and Nerežišća. The largest number of remaining coins belongs to the ones minted in Split (cat. no. 10 - 154). Typological analysis is based upon the typology created by G. Stockert (graph 2). TYPE II, GROUP B: 98 examples (67 % of the total sum) of the remaining coins from Split belong to this group. Accordingto the reverse of the coins of this group, I have divided them into two variants. The first variantconsists of 66 examples (cat. no. 10 – 75). The second variant consists of 30 examples (cat. no. 76 – 107). Examples of the coins of B group were found in hoards on Čiovo, in Trilj and Nerežišća. TYPE II, GROUP C:This group is represented within our hoard with 9 examples (cat. no. 108 – 116), that is 6 % of the totalsum. Analogies have been preserved in the hoards from Čiovo and Nerežišća. TYPE II, GROUP D:Only 3 examples from our hoard belong to this group that is only 2 % out of total sum. It is interestingthat each example represents different variant within this group (cat. no. 117 – 119). As analogiesexamples from the hoards from Čiovo and Nerežišća should be mentioned. TYPE II, GROUP E:This group is represented by 3 examples from our hoard, or 2 % of the total sum (cat. no. 120 - 122). Similar examples have been found in the hoards from Čiovo and Nerežišća. TYPE II, GROUP F:This group is represented with 8 examples divided into two variants that make 6 % of the total sum(cat. no. 123 – 130). The analogous examples come from the hoards from Žažvić near Skradin andfrom Čiovo and Nerežišća. TYPE II, GROUP G:Group G is represented in our hoard with 24 examples divided into two variants, that makes 17 % ofthe total sum (cat. no. 131 – 154). The analogous examples to this group were found in the hoardsfrom Žažvić near Skradin, and from Čiovo and Nerežišća. Information about the earliest distribution and minting of the Split medieval coins of type I areconnected to the fist half of the 13 th century (1237 – 1247), according to the archives used by G. Novak in his book „The History of Split“. The archive documents from the same source confirm theminting of Split coins of type I also in the period from 1258 to 1266. According to the majority of the authors, coins of type II started to be minted by the end of the 13 th century. At the same time type I was still minted and used. Furthermore, the authors believethat the coins of type III and IV appeared in Split at the beginning of the 14 th century. None of theauthors states the opinion whether the type II coins were still minted in that period, but accordingto the hoards from Trilj and Nerežišća this type was certainly used as a legal tender. The examples ofthe coins of type I-II have been better preserved compared to the types III – IV. Therefore, I believethat coins of the type I-II was simultaneously minted with the types III-IV in Split in the beginning ofthe 14 th century. Split statute dates from that period (1312) and it states through numerous laws theusage of coins that were minted in Split. From 1327 to 1357 Split was under the Venetian rule. Most of the authors believe that coins oftype V were minted in that period. I believe that, because of the number of preserved coins of type V,at that period as far as Split denari are concerned, types I-II,V were most commonly used. Hoards fromTrilj and Nerežišća lead to that conclusion. Present-day situation leads to the belief that Split denariwere minted in Split at that time of Venetian government, and not only coins of type V. According to the records of the Great Council assembly for the 1357 – 1384 period, Split denariare mentioned again, therefore they were minted in Split. I believe this is also type II in question,but we also have to take into consideration types I, III – V. According to the aforementioned, coins oftype II were probably minted in Split as late as the second half of the 14 th century. This situation isconfirmed by hoards from Trilj and Nerežišća. The authors agree that the next money to be minted in Split was the one belonging to DukeHrvoje Vukčić Hrvatinić who had minted several emissions of his coinage from 1403 to 1413. Theauthors do not state that any kind of coinage was minted between 1357 and 1403. Which coinswere used at that period as a legal tender? I am inclined to believe that those were the coins of typeI-V, especially type I-II and V that could have been minted in Split until the end of the 14 th and thebeginning of 15 th century. The existing archive material that mentions the same supports this. Duke Hrvoje Vukčić Hrvatinić minted his coins in Split from 1403 to 1413 (types VI-VIII). I aminclined to believe that besides Hrvoje’s coins, the same coins of type I-V were minted, especially typeI-II and V. In the year of 1420 Split was under the Venetian rule. Most of the authors believe that Venicestarted minting types IX-X in Venice only in 1491. No one is asking question about which coinswere minted, or which were used until 1491. It is important to note that the county of Split askedVenice for permission to mint lower value coins (probably split denari) because of the shortage ofthe same coins. Venetian government had decided in 1491, 1497 and 1518 to allow minting of Splitcoins – bagatin in Split itself. So which coins of lower value were used in Split until 1491 and slowlydisappeared from circulation? The idea that it were Split <b>denary</b> of type I-V suggests itself. If they werenot minted in Split at that time, they were definitely used as a legal tender until 1491. According to the historic data the most probable scenario is that the depositing of the coinshappened because of some danger, most probably war. Time intervals in which depositing couldhave happened are as follows: 1252; 1287 - 1290; 1322 - 1327; 1387 - 1390; 1401 - 1402; 1411 - 1412; 1416 - 1420. We can conclude that our hoard from Turska peć was probably deposited in the ground between 1252 and 1491. The exact time when that happened we cannot say with certainty...|$|E
