5000|$|A {{multitude}} of random arcs form in operation gap exceeding 1.5 mm {{between the two}} electrodes during discharges in gases at the atmospheric pressure [...] As the charges collect {{on the surface of}} the dielectric, they discharge in microseconds (millionths of a second), leading to their reformation elsewhere on the surface. Similar to other electrical discharge methods, the contained plasma is sustained if the continuous energy source provides the required degree of ionization, overcoming the recombination process leading to the extinction of the discharge plasma. Such recombinations are directly proportional to the collisions between the molecules and in turn to the pressure of the gas, as explained by Paschen's Law. The discharge process causes the emission of an energetic photon, the frequency and energy of which corresponds to the type of gas used to fill the <b>discharge</b> <b>gap.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Dielectric-barrier {{discharges}} are {{a type of}} {{plasma source}} that limits the current using a dielectric that covers one or both electrodes. A conventional DBD device comprises two planar electrodes {{with at least one}} of them covered with a dielectric material and the electrodes are separated by a small gap which is called the <b>discharge</b> <b>gap.</b> DBDs are usually driven by high AC voltages with frequencies in the kHz range. In order to use DC and 50/60 Hz power sources investigators developed the Resistive Barrier Discharge (RBD). However, for medical application of DBD devices, the human body itself can serve as one of the two electrodes making it sufficient to devise plasma sources that consist of only one electrode covered with a dielectric such as alumina or quartz. DBD for medical applications such as for the inactivation of bacteria, for treatment of skin diseases and wounds, tumor treatment [...] and disinfection of skin surface are currently under investigation. The treatment usually takes place in the room air. They are generally powered by several several kilovolt biases using either AC or pulsed power supplies.|$|E

40|$|The {{electric}} {{characteristics of}} the cathode layer of a normal glow discharge are discussed. The value of the normal current density and its dependence on the discharge parameters are modeled within a one-dimensional drift approximation with a local ionization. The dependence of the coefficient of electron-ion emission oil the electric field strength at the cathode causes the normal current density to {{be a function of}} the reduced length of the <b>discharge</b> <b>gap.</b> This result differs radically from the commonly accepted model with a constant emission coefficient. Within the framework of this model. the reduced normal current density is independent of the reduced length of the <b>discharge</b> <b>gap</b> provided that the latter exceeds some critical value and the effect of the normal current density is absent at a shorter reduced length of the <b>discharge</b> <b>gap.</b> A modification of this model used in this work provides a quantitative description of the dependence of the normal current density on the reduced length of the <b>discharge</b> <b>gap.</b> This dependence has been experimentally found recently...|$|E

40|$|Low-pressure gas {{measurements}} are of increasing {{interest in the}} process industry for both control purposes and emission measurements. Industrial measurement environments include some very challenging components, such as:- Dust, particles, vapor, water droplets, etc. - Temperatures up to 1200 °C- Pipe diameters of 1 to 10 mUltrasound flow measurement techniques have many advantages for such industrial measurement problems. Currently, a major problem {{is the lack of}} transducer technology that is sufficiently robust to operate {{in the presence of the}} above given industrial components. For the purpose of producing more robust technology, a <b>gap</b> <b>discharge</b> sound transmitter has been developed [1, 2]. Theoretical and experimental studies of the <b>gap</b> <b>discharge</b> transmitter indicate that flow measurement performances in the range of 1 - 2 % of the actual flow is achievable [3]. Based on this <b>gap</b> <b>discharge</b> transmitter, an experimental ultrasound gas flowmeter was designed. The design features a <b>gap</b> <b>discharge</b> transmitter and piezo-based receivers. The design was tested in a real industrial environment. The test environment included heavy dust and water vapor in an exhaust pipe at a pelletization plant at LKAB, Kiruna, Sweden. The pipe diameter is 3 m, the pressure is ambient, and the gas flow speed is in the range of 5 - 20 m/s. The flow conditions were highly turbulent, using a straight pipe length ten times the pipe diameter in front of the experimental flowmeter. This paper presents the experimental <b>gap</b> <b>discharge</b> ultrasonic flowmeter design, the experimental setup and some measurement data.

30|$|As the {{increase}} in pulse off time, there were no changes in the surface roughness during machining of D 2 steel. This {{is due to the}} time between the pulse width which is inconsequentially increased and which is not much affecting the ratio of pulse energy in the plasma channel between the electrode and work piece surface. It is observed that the surface roughness increases with increase of pulse on time and decreases with {{the increase}} of servo voltage. With increase in servo voltage, the average <b>discharge</b> <b>gap</b> gets widened resulting into better surface accuracy due to stable machining. During {{the increase in}} servo voltage, the <b>discharge</b> <b>gap</b> widens means the intensity of the spark impinges on the machined surface is low and causes for smaller craters leading to lower surface roughness (Shahali et al. 2012). At lower servo voltage, the <b>discharge</b> <b>gap</b> was reduced causes higher intensity of spark penetrates into the material, melts more amount of material, forms deeper crater on the machined surface, and causes worsening of the surface leads to higher surface roughness. Effect of wire feed on surface roughness is similar to MRR. A minor change in the surface roughness with respect to wire feed is observed. This {{may be due to the}} no changes in cutting speed caused by the increase in wire feed which leads to melting and evaporation of material.|$|E
