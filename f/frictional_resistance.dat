25|$|Biofilms {{have become}} {{problematic}} in several food industries {{due to the}} ability to form on plants and during industrial processes. Bacteria can survive long periods of time in water, animal manure, and soil, causing biofilm formation on plants or in the processing equipment. The buildup of biofilms can affect the heat flow across a surface and increase surface corrosion and <b>frictional</b> <b>resistance</b> of fluids. These can lead to a loss of energy in a system and overall loss of products. Along with economic problems biofilm formation on food poses a health risk to consumers due {{to the ability to}} make the food more resistant to disinfectants As a result, from 1996 to 2010 the Center for Disease Control and Prevention estimated 48 million foodborne illnesses per year.

The analytical evaluation of the in-plane <b>frictional</b> <b>resistances</b> activated {{at the onset of}} the rocking-sliding mechanisms is revisited in order to account for the different contributions of the self weight of the wall and additional loads. It is assumed that the wall is arranged in a running bond pattern, with rigid blocks and dry contact interfaces governed by cohesionless Coulomb failure criterion. The accuracy and robustness of the analytical results are assessed by experimentally testing both the resultant <b>frictional</b> <b>resistances</b> and their applications points.

40|$|In {{this paper}} the limit {{analysis}} of a simple out-of-plane failure mechanism of a laterally weakly connected masonry wall involving <b>frictional</b> <b>resistances</b> is developed according to the displacement-based approach. The pushover analysis is made considering geometric nonlinearity, i. e. by evaluating the static multiplier for varied kinematic configurations, {{as a function of}} the displacement of a control point. The effect of the interlocking between the front wall and the sidewalls gradually decreases after a certain displacement, due to the progressive detachment of the front wall and the variation of the <b>frictional</b> <b>resistances</b> can be represented by a non-linear function of the decreasing number of involved rows. The stabilizing role of friction between interlocked walls is compared to another system of strength in masonry buildings, i. e. the effect of tie-rods, with and without the detrimental effect of the static thrust of masonry vaults. The sensitivity of the load multiplier to these strength parameters is investigated with reference to different combinations of loading conditions. Comparative results and pushover curves are developed to evaluate the displacement capacities for each case analyzed...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{new findings}} {{in the assessment of}} the lateral strength of dry block masonry walls under in-plane loading, based on an existing macro-modelling approach using limit analysis methods.

The solution procedure of the previous macro-block model providing upper and lower bounds for the ultimate load factor is also reconsidered and the computation of the “exact” load factor falling within the range is proposed. A satisfactory comparison is found with a micro-block and other macro-block models existing in the literature. This comparison is carried out through a parametric analysis, in terms of both the load factor and the failure mode and with reference to the effects of chosen parameters (wall aspect, unit aspect, unit size ratios and overload) on the load factor...|$|R
25|$|Tectonic {{earthquakes}} occur {{anywhere in}} the earth where there is sufficient stored elastic strain energy to drive fracture propagation along a fault plane. The sides of a fault move past each other smoothly and aseismically only {{if there are no}} irregularities or asperities along the fault surface that increase the <b>frictional</b> <b>resistance.</b> Most fault surfaces do have such asperities and this leads to a form of stick-slip behavior. Once the fault has locked, continued relative motion between the plates leads to increasing stress and therefore, stored strain energy in the volume around the fault surface. This continues until the stress has risen sufficiently to break through the asperity, suddenly allowing sliding over the locked portion of the fault, releasing the stored energy. This energy is released as a combination of radiated elastic strain seismic waves, frictional heating of the fault surface, and cracking of the rock, thus causing an earthquake. This process of gradual build-up of strain and stress punctuated by occasional sudden earthquake failure {{is referred to as the}} elastic-rebound theory. It is estimated that only 10 percent or less of an earthquake's total energy is radiated as seismic energy. Most of the earthquake's energy is used to power the earthquake fracture growth or is converted into heat generated by friction. Therefore, earthquakes lower the Earth's available elastic potential energy and raise its temperature, though these changes are negligible compared to the conductive and convective flow of heat out from the Earth's deep interior.|$|E

2500|$|Seepage in {{an upward}} {{direction}} reduces the effective stress within the soil. When the water pressure {{at a point}} in the soil is equal to the total vertical stress at that point, the effective stress is zero and the soil has no <b>frictional</b> <b>resistance</b> to deformation. For a surface layer, the vertical effective stress becomes zero within the layer when the upward hydraulic gradient is equal to the critical gradient. At zero effective stress soil has very little strength and layers of relatively impermeable soil may heave up due to the underlying water pressures. [...] The loss in strength due to upward seepage is a common contributor to levee failures. The condition of zero effective stress associated with upward seepage is also called liquefaction, quicksand, or a boiling condition. Quicksand was so named because the soil particles move around and appear to be 'alive' (the biblical meaning of 'quick' – as opposed to 'dead').

The out-of-plane behavior of a masonry system composed of a façade wall connected with two sidewalls is investigated by means of limit analysis and some recurrent classes of mechanisms are analyzed.
