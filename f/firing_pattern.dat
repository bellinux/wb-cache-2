25|$|Shotgun {{proteomics}} {{refers to}} the use of bottom-up proteomics techniques in identifying proteins in complex mixtures using a combination of high performance liquid chromatography combined with mass spectrometry. The name is derived from shotgun sequencing of DNA which is itself named after the rapidly expanding, quasi-random <b>firing</b> <b>pattern</b> of a shotgun. The most common method of shotgun proteomics starts with the proteins in the mixture being digested and the resulting peptides are separated by liquid chromatography. Tandem mass spectrometry is then used to identify the peptides.|$|E
25|$|Since monotremes, {{egg-laying}} mammals, {{are considered}} to represent one of the evolutionarily oldest groups of mammals, they {{have been subject to}} special interest in the study of mammalian sleep. As early studies of these animals could not find clear evidence for REM sleep, it was initially assumed that such sleep did not exist in monotremes, but developed after the monotremes branched {{off from the rest of}} the mammalian evolutionary line, and became a separate, distinct group. However, EEG recordings of the brain stem in monotremes show a <b>firing</b> <b>pattern</b> that is quite similar to the patterns seen in REM sleep in higher mammals. In fact, the largest amount of REM sleep known in any animal is found in the platypus. REM electrical activation does not extend at all to the forebrain—suggesting that platypods do not dream. The average sleep time in a 24-hour period of a platypus is said to be as long as 14 hours; though this may be because of their high-calorie crustacean diet.|$|E
25|$|A {{group of}} neurons can also {{generate}} oscillatory activity. Through synaptic interactions the firing patterns of different neurons may become synchronized and the rhythmic changes in electric potential caused by their action potentials will add up (constructive interference). That is, synchronized firing patterns result in synchronized input into other cortical areas, which {{gives rise to}} large-amplitude oscillations of the local field potential. These large-scale oscillations can also be measured outside the scalp using electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG). The electric potentials generated by single neurons are far {{too small to be}} picked up outside the scalp, and EEG or MEG activity always reflects the summation of the synchronous activity of thousands or millions of neurons that have similar spatial orientation. Neurons in a neural ensemble rarely all fire at exactly the same moment, i.e. fully synchronized. Instead, the probability of firing is rhythmically modulated such that neurons are more likely to fire at the same time, which gives rise to oscillations in their mean activity (see figure at top of page). As such, the frequency of large-scale oscillations does not need to match the <b>firing</b> <b>pattern</b> of individual neurons. Isolated cortical neurons fire regularly under certain conditions, but in the intact brain cortical cells are bombarded by highly fluctuating synaptic inputs and typically fire seemingly at random. However, if the probability of a large group of neurons is rhythmically modulated at a common frequency, they will generate oscillations in the mean field (see also figure at top of page). Neural ensembles can generate oscillatory activity endogenously through local interactions between excitatory and inhibitory neurons. In particular, inhibitory interneurons {{play an important role in}} producing neural ensemble synchrony by generating a narrow window for effective excitation and rhythmically modulating the firing rate of excitatory neurons.|$|E

The fire origin will ultimately be connected to a plume generated <b>fire</b> <b>pattern.</b> However, if the <b>fire</b> <b>pattern</b> is incorrectly assigned as a plume generated pattern, then the entire origin hypothesis will most likely be incorrect (Carman 2008).|$|R

While the rest state for each element is {{globally}} stable for a phase-attractive coupling, various <b>firing</b> <b>patterns,</b> including cyclic and chaotic <b>firing</b> <b>patterns,</b> exist in an phase-repulsive coupling region. Although the rest state becomes linearly unstable via a Hopf bifurcation, periodic solutions associated to the <b>firing</b> <b>patterns</b> is not connected to the Hopf bifurcation. This means that the solution branch emanating from the Hopf bifurcation is subcritical and unstable for any coupling strength. Various types of cyclic <b>firing</b> <b>patterns</b> emerge suddenly through saddle-node bifurcations. The parameter region in which different periodic solutions coexist is also found...|$|R
2500|$|Studies with rats {{have shown}} that place cells tend to fire quickly when a rat enters a new, open environment, but outside of a firing field, place cells tend to be {{relatively}} inactive. Together place cells are thought to form a [...] "cognitive map" [...] {{in which they have}} localized firing patterns called place fields. Place cell firing patterns are often determined by external sensory information and the local environment. Place cells have proven {{to have the ability to}} suddenly change their <b>firing</b> <b>pattern</b> from one pattern to another, a phenomenon known as [...] "re-mapping" [...] and though place cells do change according to the external environment, they are stabilized by attractor dynamics which [...] "enable the system to resist small changes in sensory input but respond collectively and coherently to large ones".|$|E
2500|$|Shotgun {{sequencing}} is a sequencing method {{designed for}} analysis of DNA sequences longer than 1000 base pairs, {{up to and including}} entire chromosomes. It is named by analogy with the rapidly expanding, quasi-random <b>firing</b> <b>pattern</b> of a shotgun. Since this method can only be used for fairly short sequences (100 to 1000 base pairs), longer DNA sequences must be broken into random small segments which are then sequenced to obtain reads. Multiple overlapping reads for the target DNA are obtained by performing several rounds of this fragmentation and sequencing. Computer programs then use the overlapping ends of different reads to assemble them into a continuous sequence. [...] Shotgun sequencing is a random sampling process, requiring over-sampling to ensure a given nucleotide is represented in the reconstructed sequence; the average number of reads by which a genome is over-sampled is referred to as coverage.|$|E

30|$|Since the {{beginning}} of organized fire investigation in the late 1940 ’s, fire investigators have relied on <b>fire</b> <b>patterns</b> as their basis for determining the fire origin (Rethoret 1945). <b>Fire</b> <b>patterns</b> are defined as the “visible or measurable physical changes, or identifiable shapes, formed by a fire effect or group of fire effects” (NFPA 2014). Absent the testimony of reliable eyewitnesses to or recording of the fire’s inception, the investigator is required to determine the origin by observation and expert interpretation of the physical evidence (e.g. <b>fire</b> <b>patterns)</b> {{in an attempt to}} reconstruct the fire’s development. As such, fire origin determination is largely a matter of <b>fire</b> <b>pattern</b> recognition and interpretation (NFPA 2014).|$|R

30|$|Given {{the history}} of using <b>fire</b> <b>patterns</b> within the <b>fire</b> {{investigation}} profession, it was reasonable that they would also {{be included in the}} first edition (1992), and all subsequent editions of NFPA 921 Guide for Fire and Explosion Investigations. NFPA 921 is recognized as establishing the standard of care for the fire investigation profession and is the only consensus document that exists for fire investigators. The importance of <b>fire</b> <b>patterns</b> is clearly reiterated in Section 6.1. 1 by stating “the major objective of any fire scene examination is to collect data as required by the scientific method. Such data include the patterns produced by the fire” (NFPA 2014). The chapter on <b>fire</b> <b>patterns</b> underwent reorganization between the 2004 – 2008 editions to divide fire effects and <b>fire</b> <b>patterns.</b> This {{was the first time that}} a distinction was drawn between damage caused by the fire (fire effects) and clusters of fire effects that may have characteristics that assist the <b>fire</b> investigator (<b>fire</b> <b>patterns).</b> <b>Fire</b> effects are the physical or chemical changes that occur to different materials when exposed to the byproducts of combustion (e.g. melting of plastics, oxidation of metals). <b>Fire</b> <b>patterns</b> are identified as the collection of these effects and geometric shapes that these effects produced.|$|R

30|$|Fire {{investigators}} have historically relied upon damage {{as a means}} to conclude where a fire originated. This review evaluates the historical and current literature on the topic, with a specific emphasis towards the research conducted over the past 80  years related to <b>fire</b> <b>patterns.</b> The concept of <b>fire</b> <b>patterns</b> for this review has been broken into four components that better assist in evaluating their effectiveness in determining an area of origin. The first component evaluated is the ability to assess the varying degree of fire damage along the surfaces of the compartment and contents. Next, the ability to identify clusters of damage was evaluated. Interpretation of the causal factors for the generation of the <b>fire</b> <b>patterns</b> was next appraised. Finally, the availability of processes using <b>fire</b> <b>patterns</b> in determining an area of origin was assessed. This deconstruction of the problem provides a gap analysis of the current processes and identifies areas where future work is needed. A seven step reasoning process for evaluating damage for determining the area of origin, along with a new definition for the term <b>fire</b> <b>pattern</b> is proposed.|$|R

The present study provides novel biological experimental findings regarding complex bifurcation scenarios from period- 1 bursting to period- 1 spiking with chaotic <b>firing</b> <b>patterns.</b> These bifurcations were found to be similar to those simulated using the Hindmarsh-Rose model across two separated chaotic regions. One chaotic region lay between period- 1 and period- 2 burstings. This region has not attracted much attention. The other region is a well-known comb-shaped chaotic region, and it appears after period- 2 bursting. After period- 2 bursting, the chaotic firings lay in a period-adding bifurcation scenario or in a period-doubling bifurcation cascade. The deterministic dynamics of the chaotic <b>firing</b> <b>patterns</b> were identified using a nonlinear prediction method. These results provided details regarding the processes and dynamics of bifurcation containing the chaotic bursting between period- 1 and period- 2 burstings and other chaotic <b>firing</b> <b>patterns</b> within the comb-shaped chaotic region.

Attributing a fundamental interpretation to an observation, specifically one that ties the underlying physics to an observation, is a major key to accurately determining the true fire scenario and area of origin.

A literature review was performed in order to achieve the objectives of this study.

30|$|Beginning in March of 2005, {{a series}} of 20 {{full-scale}} <b>fire</b> <b>pattern</b> tests were conducted at Eastern Kentucky University (Gorbett et al. 2006; Hopkins et al. 2007; Hopkins et al. 2008; Hopkins et al. 2009; Gorbett 2010; Gorbett et al. 2013). The test fires were conducted in identically constructed, finished and furnished living room and bedroom compartments within a burn building.

The researchers discuss that similar truncated cone patterns were identified in the first eight tests (Gorbett et al. 2006). The most important finding from these tests is that “the interpretation of all fire effects provides substantial evidence for the investigator to identify the correct area of origin” (Gorbett et al. 2010). These studies contended that the use of the heat and flame vector analysis enabled the investigator to determine the true area of origin.
