5|$|Monitoring of {{the volcano}} and {{predictions}} of large eruptions are particularly important because of its location in a <b>densely</b> <b>populated</b> <b>area,</b> {{with the city of}} Kagoshima's 680,000 residents just a few kilometers from the volcano. The city conducts regular evacuation drills, and a number of shelters have been built where people can take refuge from falling volcanic debris.|$|E
5|$|Norte Chico {{sites are}} notable for {{exceptional}} collective density, {{as well as}} individual size. Haas argues that the density of sites in such a small area is globally unique for a nascent civilization. During the third millennium BC, Norte Chico may have been the most <b>densely</b> <b>populated</b> <b>area</b> of the world (excepting, possibly, northern China). The Supe, Pativilca, Fortaleza, and Huaura River valleys each have several related sites.|$|E
5|$|Although Wakaw had a {{population}} of only 400, it sat {{at the heart of}} a <b>densely</b> <b>populated</b> <b>area</b> of rural townships and had its own district court. It was also easily accessible to Saskatoon, Prince Albert and Humboldt, places where the Court of King's Bench sat. The local people were mostly immigrants, and Diefenbaker's research found them to be particularly litigious. There was already one barrister in town, and the residents were loyal to him, initially refusing to rent office space to Diefenbaker. The new lawyer was forced to rent a vacant lot and erect a two-room wooden shack.|$|E

Brooklands is the most <b>densely</b> <b>populated</b> <b>area.</b> Most of the parks, including Worthington and Walton, are in the central and southern areas, leaving Ashton upon Mersey and Sale Moor with a shortage of accessible green space.|$|E
5|$|By June 1942, the Manhattan Project {{had reached}} the stage where the {{construction}} of production facilities could be contemplated. On June 25, 1942, the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD) S-1 Executive Committee deliberated on {{where they should be}} located. Moving directly to a megawatt production plant looked like a big step, given that many industrial processes do not easily scale from the laboratory to production size. An intermediate step of building a pilot plant was considered prudent. For the pilot plutonium separation plant, a site was wanted close to the Metallurgical Laboratory, where the research was being carried out, but for reasons of safety and security, it was not desirable to locate the facilities in a <b>densely</b> <b>populated</b> <b>area</b> like Chicago.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} initial tornado dissipated, a new {{circulation}} rapidly developed {{to the east of}} the old one. This new circulation produced a tornado that touched down at the Union University campus in Jackson, almost immediately intensifying into a violent EF4 and causing tremendous damage. Several large, brick, two-story dormitory buildings sustained major structural damage, two of which completely collapsed. 80% of the dormitory buildings on campus were damaged or destroyed, and hundreds of vehicles were damaged or destroyed in the parking lots around campus. Twelve students at the university were trapped in damaged buildings but all were eventually rescued. Due to the damage, the university was closed until February 18. Past Union University, the tornado weakened slightly and maintained EF3 strength along the remainder of the path. It tracked across U.S. Route 45, heavily damaging several banks, businesses, a hospital, and several doctors offices. The tornado then moved through the northern part of Jackson, inflicting significant damage to many subdivisions and businesses. The Chapel Creek, Indian Hills, and Wyndhurst subdivisions were all struck by the tornado. Numerous homes were damaged in this area, some of which sustained loss of roofs and exterior walls. Additional damage was noted at Northside High School, at the Jackson Oaks Senior Living Complex, and in the Walnut Trace subdivision as well. Continuing northeast, the tornado caused major damage to multiple additional homes as it crossed near the intersection of Christmasville Road and Ashport Road. The Madison County Fire Station #11 was destroyed in this area as well, with the station's fire engine and pumper, along with its water and brush trucks all being damaged. Beyond this point, the tornado weakened and dissipated. 70 structures were destroyed in Jackson, with over 500 more damaged. Despite causing EF4 damage after dark in a <b>densely</b> <b>populated</b> <b>area,</b> the tornado did not cause any deaths in Jackson, though 51 people were injured, and the initial EF3 tornado caused three fatalities and 14 injuries. The second of the two tornadoes was the third violent tornado to hit Jackson in 10 years. Two others, both rated F4, had devastated the community on January 17, 1999 and May 4, 2003.|$|E

30|$|Concerning the {{remaining}} variables, one noteworthy and surprising {{finding is that}} unemployed persons in <b>densely</b> <b>populated</b> <b>areas</b> {{are less likely than}} unemployed persons in areas with an intermediate degree of urbanization to use either of the two methods. One could have imagined that access to social networks is easier and hence, more frequently used for job search in <b>densely</b> <b>populated</b> <b>areas.</b> However, given that there is no difference between regions with different degrees of urbanization in terms of overall job search intensity, we can conclude that the lower use of the PEO and search via personal networks must be compensated by a higher use of other search channels. For example, it is conceivable that in <b>densely</b> <b>populated</b> <b>areas</b> standard search channels such as advertisements already generate sufficient job offers.|$|R
25|$|The second-largest {{volcanic}} eruption of the 20th century, and {{by far the}} largest eruption to affect a <b>densely</b> <b>populated</b> <b>area,</b> occurred at Mount Pinatubo on June 15, 1991.

25|$|Utrecht is {{the centre}} of a <b>densely</b> <b>populated</b> <b>area,</b> which makes concise {{definitions}} of its agglomeration difficult, and somewhat arbitrary. The smaller Utrecht agglomeration of continuously built up areas counts some 420,000 inhabitants and includes Nieuwegein, IJsselstein and Maarssen. It is sometimes argued that the close by municipalities De Bilt, Zeist, Houten, Vianen, Driebergen-Rijsenburg (Utrechtse Heuvelrug), and Bunnik should also be counted towards the Utrecht agglomeration, bringing the total to 640,000 inhabitants. The larger region, including slightly more remote towns such as Woerden and Amersfoort counts up to 820,000 inhabitants.|$|E
25|$|Camperdown Cemetery is {{associated}} with numerous sensational stories, several reputed ghosts and a murder. It is used regularly for historical and genealogical research.

50|$|The {{last major}} {{earthquake}} {{in the same}} region of similar magnitude (7.6 Mw) was almost exactly ten years prior in October 2005, which resulted in 87,351 deaths, 75,266 injured, 2.8 million people being displaced, and 250,000 farm animals dying. The notable difference between this earthquake and the 2005 earthquake is the focal depth and its location {{with respect to the}} <b>densely</b> <b>populated</b> <b>areas.</b> The 2005 earthquake was 15 km deep and centered close to some <b>densely</b> <b>populated</b> <b>areas</b> while this earthquake was 212.5 km deep and centered farther from <b>populated</b> <b>areas,</b> reducing its damaging effects.|$|R

The Panthers eventually surrendered, with four Panthers and four officers being injured. All six arrested Panthers were acquitted of the most serious charges brought against them, including conspiracy to murder police officers, because it was ruled that they acted in self-defense.|$|E
25|$|Immigrant {{segregation}} {{declined in}} the first half of the 20th century, but has been rising over the past few decades. This has caused questioning of the correctness of describing the United States as a melting pot. One explanation is that groups with lower socioeconomic status concentrate in more <b>densely</b> <b>populated</b> <b>area</b> that have access to public transit while groups with higher socioeconomic status move to suburban areas. Another is that some recent immigrant groups are more culturally and linguistically different from earlier groups and prefer to live together due to factors such as communication costs. Another explanation for increased segregation is white flight.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} Pleistocene era, a huge {{landslide}} {{occurred at the}} mountain, with approximately 25km³ of debris travelling some 120km, reaching the Pacific Ocean. An area of some 2,200km² was covered in landslide deposits. The currently active cone is situated within a large caldera that was probably formed {{by a combination of}} landslides and large eruptions. The lava is andesite containing 56-61% SiO2. About 300,000people live within 40km (25 miles) of the volcano, which makes it the most dangerous volcano in Mexico. In light of its history of large eruptions and situation in a <b>densely</b> <b>populated</b> <b>area,</b> it was designated a Decade Volcano, singling it out for study.|$|E
