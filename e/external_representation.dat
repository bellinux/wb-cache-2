25|$|The President of the European Council is {{appointed}} for a {{two and a}} {{half year}} term in a qualified majority vote of the European Council. A president can be reappointed once, and be removed by the same voting procedure. Unlike the post of President of the European Commission, the appointment of the President of the European Council does not have to reflect the composition of the European Parliament. The president's work involves coordinating the work of the European Council, hosting its meetings and reporting its activities to the European Parliament after each meeting. This makes the president the lynchpin of negotiations to find agreement at European Council meetings, which has become a more onerous task with successive enlargement of the EU to 28 Member States. The president also chairs informal summits of the 19 Member States which use the euro as their currency.

The analysis also revealed that none of the included techniques explicitly support designers in making multiple simultaneous representations of services. The research contributes knowledge about how purposes for visualising and prototyping are related to general benefits of making <b>external</b> <b>representations.</b> It also provides insights about how to choose and use different service design techniques based on theories of distributed and situated cognition...|$|R

This representational effect was discussed under a framework of distributed number representations. We propose that in numerical tasks involving <b>external</b> <b>representations,</b> numbers {{should be considered as}} distributed representations and the behavior in these tasks should be considered as the interactive processing of internal and external information through the interplay of perceptual and cognitive processes.

Whether in the classroom, university or workplace, {{there is a growing}} requirement to use and interpret a large variety of external representational forms and tools for knowledge acquisition, problem solving, and to communicate with others. Use of Representations in Reasoning and Problem Solving brings together contributions from some of the world’s leading researchers in educational and instructional psychology, instructional design, and mathematics and science education to document the role which <b>external</b> <b>representations</b> play in our understanding, learning and communication. Traditional research has focused on the distinction between verbal and non-verbal representations, and the way they are processed, encoded and stored by different cognitive systems. The contributions here challenge these research findings and address the ambiguity about how these two cognitive systems interact, arguing that the classical distinction between textual and pictorial representations has become less prominent. The contributions in this book explore: * How we can theorise the relationship between processing internal and <b>external</b> <b>representations</b> * What perceptual and cognitive restraints can affect the use of <b>external</b> <b>representations</b> * How individual differences affect the use of <b>external</b> <b>representations</b> * How we can combine <b>external</b> <b>representations</b> to maximise their impact * How we can adapt representational tools for individual differences. Using empirical research findings to take a fresh look at the processes which take place when learning via <b>external</b> <b>representations,</b> this book is essential reading for all those undertaking postgraduate study and research in the fields of educational and instructional psychology, instructional design and mathematics and science education. nrpages: 260 status: publishe...|$|R

The obvious explanation— <b>external</b> <b>representations</b> save internal memory and computation—is {{only part of the}} story. I discuss seven ways <b>external</b> <b>representations</b> enhance cognitive power: they change the cost structure of the inferential landscape; they provide a structure that can serve as a shareable object of thought; they create persistent referents; they facilitate rerepresentation; they are often a more natural representation of structure than mental representations; they facilitate the computation of more explicit encoding of information; they enable the construction of arbitrarily complex structure; and they lower the cost of controlling thought—they help coordinate thought. Jointly, these functions allow people to think more powerfully with <b>external</b> <b>representations</b> than without. They allow us to think the previously unthinkable...|$|R

Three experiments are designed to examine the relation between internal and external working memory. The experimental results show that external working memory can hinder as well as enhance task performance. In other words, <b>external</b> <b>representations</b> do not always aid working memory. It is shown that the critical factor that determines task difficulty is the retrieval of information from internal and external working memory. Different representations across internal and external working memory and different encodings in internal working memory elicit different retrieval strategies, which give rise to different difficulty levels. It is argued that different patterns of behavior result from a constraint satisfaction process that minimizes the load of internal working memory and meanwhile satisfie...|$|R

40|$|In this {{doctoral}} project {{we focused}} {{on the role of}} <b>external</b> <b>representations</b> in distributional reasoning. Although in the mathematics education literature a lot {{has been written about the}} importance of representations in problem solving and learning, this is much less the case in the statistics education literature. Especially with respect to distributional reasoning, the role of representations is not valued and studied much. In this doctoral project we tried to fill this gap. A first research question was: What is the role of <b>external</b> <b>representations</b> in distributional reasoning?. We studied this role by comparing how students solved the same tasks with different representations (dot plot, descriptive statistics, box plot, and histogram). We found, as expected, that the best achievement differs by representation and task. Accuracy was relatively low in general, and each representation elicited misinterpretations. This was especially the case for box plots and histograms. The second research question was: Which reasoning mechanisms underlie the (mis) interpretation of <b>external</b> <b>representations</b> for data distributions?. Because we found interesting misinterpretations of box plots and histograms in the first studies, we chose to answer this research question for two specific misinterpretations of box plots and histograms. Using graph design principles and the dual processing theory of reasoning as a framework we found that both misinterpretations are elicited by specific design features of the box plot and the histogram, and can be characterised as the consequence of the intuitive or heuristic processing of salient graph features. The third research question was: How can students interpretation of <b>external</b> <b>representations</b> for data distributions be improved?. We focused for this research question on one specific misinterpretation of the box in the box plot. We used both multiple <b>external</b> <b>representations</b> and refutational text to improve students interpretation of box plots. Multiple <b>external</b> <b>representations</b> had a positive effect when dot plots and box plots were combined. When histograms and box plots were combined, the effect was less clear. Refutational text improved the reasoning of many students and seems to be a promising way to further improve instruction on distributional reasoning. status: publishe...|$|R

This chapter outlines {{a theoretical framework}} providing insights into the use of low-sophisticated <b>external</b> <b>representations</b> during prior knowledge activation in the science domain. This framework distinguishes representations that prompt (i. e., initiate) prior knowledge activation from representations that reinforce (i. e., facilitate) the activation process. Prompts that consist of pictorial representations (e. g., pictures, animations) will be more suitable than verbal representations to activate structural and causal models important for science learning. Furthermore, <b>external</b> <b>representations</b> may reinforce the activation process. There are limits {{to the amount of}} information that can be activated simultaneously because of human’s limited working memory capacity. Self-constructing representations (i. e., note taking) might offload working memory while activating prior knowledge.
