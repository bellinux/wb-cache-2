40|$|This Office <b>of</b> <b>Inspector</b> General Semiannual Report to the Congress {{covers the}} period from October 1, 1995, through March 31, 1996. The report {{summarizes}} significant audit, inspection, and investigative accomplishments for the reporting period, {{a large portion of}} which facilitated Department of Energy management efforts to improve management controls and ensure efficient and effective operation of its programs. A major accomplishment during this period was the completion of financial statement audits for Fiscal Year 1995. Annual financial statement audits are mandated by the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990. Narratives of our most significant reports are grouped by measures which the Office <b>of</b> <b>Inspector</b> General uses to gauge its performance. The common thread that ties the performance measures together is their emphasis on supporting Department efforts to produce high quality products at the lowest possible cost to the taxpayer. During this reporting period, the Office <b>of</b> <b>Inspector</b> General issued 67 audit and 15 inspection reports. For reports issued during the period, the Office <b>of</b> <b>Inspector</b> General made audit recommendations that, when implemented by management, could result in $ 134. 6 million being put to better use. Management committed to taking corrective actions which the Office <b>of</b> <b>Inspector</b> General estimates will result in a more efficient use of funds totaling $ 333. 2 million. Office <b>of</b> <b>Inspector</b> General investigations led to 6 criminal convictions and 1 pretrial diversion, as well as criminal and civil prosecutions which resulted in fines and recoveries of $ 10, 942, 714. The Office <b>of</b> <b>Inspector</b> General also provided 33 investigative referrals to management for recommended positive action...|$|R
