40|$|AbstractBased on the {{chemical}} analysis data, Beiya Gold multi-metal Ore contains Au 2. 17 g/t, Ag 59. 36 g/t, Fe 38. 51 %, Cu 0. 57 %, Pb 2. 00 %, and Zn 0. 48 %. Chemical phase analysis shows that 95. 72 % Au <b>exists</b> <b>as</b> nature gold; 67. 22 % Fe <b>exists</b> <b>as</b> limonite and hematite, and only 23. 65 % <b>exists</b> <b>as</b> magnetite; 26. 41 % Cu <b>exists</b> <b>as</b> malachite and only 12. 14 % <b>exists</b> <b>as</b> sulfide minerals such as chalcopyrite and covellite; {{in the same}} way only 3. 98 % Pb <b>exists</b> <b>as</b> galena and 26. 09 % Zn <b>exists</b> <b>as</b> sphalerite. So the Systemic process mineralogy study is very necessary to guarantee separating these valuable elements from the ore reasonably and economically. Based on the process mineralogy research, reasonable technology flowsheet is worked out: the ore is ground to 90 % under 0. 074 mm, leaching Au firstly, then enriching Fe by low-intensity and high-magnetic separation. The Cu, Ag, Pb and Zn in the ore are unavailable now...|$|R
