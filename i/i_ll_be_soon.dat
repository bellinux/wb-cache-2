40|$|The {{effect of}} a {{vasodilator}} (hydralazine), a beta-blocker (oxprenolol) and also their combination, on essential arterial hypertension and plasma renin activity (PRA), was studied. Eighteen patients with mild hypertension (WHO <b>I</b> or <b>ll)</b> <b>were</b> treated for 4 weeks with oxprenolol, hydralazine and their combination, with-t-week placebo periods between the active treatment periods. Oxprenolol and hydralazine lowered the blood pressure to a similar degree and their combination accentuated this effect. PRA decreased significantly on both the oxprenolol and the combination therapy, but increased during the following placebo and hydralazine periods to a level slightly higher than the initial level. Another group of eleven patients were treated with oxprenolol for 20 weeks. Blood pressure decreased almost to a normotensive level during the first 4 weeks of treatment and a little lower during the following 4 weeks. It remained at this level {{until the end of}} the trial. PRA decreased significantly during the first 4 weeks on oxprenolol and remained low during the whole 20 -week treatment period. No correlation was found between the change in blood pressure caused by oxprenolol treatment and the initial placebo value ofPRA, or, the change in PRA on oxprenololtreatment. These results support the view that the level of PRA has no significance when an antihypertensive treatment is being selected, e. g. beta-blockers...|$|R

Keeping on this analogy, Ehrhard and Regnier introduced Differential Linear Logic (D <b>I</b> <b>LL)</b> — an extension of Multiplicative Exponential Linear Logic with differential constructions. In this setting, promotion (the logical exponentiation) can be approximated by a sum of promotion- free proofs of D <b>I</b> <b>LL,</b> via Taylor expansion.

The relative shift of two graphene layers induces a dramatic transformation between the Dirac-cone structure and the parabolic band structure, and thus leads to drastic changes of Landau levels (LLs) in the spatial symmetry, initial formation energy, intergroup anti-crossing, state degen-eracy and semiconductor-metal transition.
