40|$|The present {{investigation}} {{was carried out}} at Research Farm and the laboratories of Department of Vegetable Science, CCS HAU, Hisar during spring-summer season (January to May, 2004). The experimental material for the present studies comprised 12 parents and their 66 F 1 crosses and the experiment was laid out in Randomized block design with three replications. Correlation and path analysis revealed that due weightage is to be given for number of fruits per plant and fruit weight (g), therefore, fruit weight as an important character which may be included in selection criterion for improvement in fruit yield per plant. The correlation analysis revealed that total fruit yield (kg) per plant was correlated significantly and positively with number of fruits per plant, fruit weight and total sugar. The study of path coefficient analysis showed that highest positive direct effect was exerted by number of fruits per plant. The correlation of yield {{with most of the}} quality traits indicated that simultaneous <b>improvement</b> <b>of</b> <b>yield</b> and quality traits was not possible because of negative correlation of yield with such quality traits.

30|$|Hydrofracturing of low-yielding {{boreholes}} in hard rocks is {{a widely}} used technique in Africa for <b>improvement</b> <b>of</b> <b>yield,</b> thus making them qualified for installation of a hand-pump for domestic water supply. However, the success rate of the hydrofracturing campaigns seems not to be that high as generally claimed by contractors. One reason amongst others might be that the selection of zones for hydrofracturing in the individual borehole is based on pre-hydrofracturing investigation using conventional electrical logs only. Thereby, the zones selected are the occurring resistivity minima interpreted as weak zones with some fracturing. However, resistivity minima can also be caused solely by lithological reasons, which then in most cases could have been seen on a gamma log as corresponding increased gamma radiation. The advantages of using gamma logging in combination with conventional electrical logging technique for prediction of fractured zones in basement rocks is illustrated by investigations of three low-yielding boreholes located in different geological environments in crystalline basement rocks in Ghana.|$|E
