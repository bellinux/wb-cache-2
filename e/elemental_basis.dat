5000|$|It is {{possible}} that diamonds exist on Saturn and Jupiter {{on the basis of}} a different prior theory by Reginald B. Little. In 2000-03, Little previously proposed (2000) and demonstrated (2003). that a strong magnetic field can organize diamonds at lower temperatures and pressures relative to the higher pressure and temperatures formations from amorphous carbon and/or graphite. In 2005, Little realized that lightning could also provide such a magnetic field to directly transform graphite and elemental carbon to diamond and Reginald Little experimentally observed Nanodiamonds form from terrestrial lightning bolts upon solid carbon in 2009. Therefore, on the basis of his prior work, Reginald Little reasoned in 2013 that diamond particles can form and exist in the lightning storms and clouds on Saturn and Jupiter but by the direct cloud transformation of carbon to small diamond particles by lightning strikes in such clouds. As Baines and Delitsky report here in 2013, the lightning striking methane generates elemental carbon in clouds on Saturn and Jupiter, but Little asserts that the diamonds form not from the carbon sinking into the core of these planets but by subsequent lightning strikes on the generated carbon in the clouds. Therefore, Little suggests that the lightning directly transforms the elemental carbon to small diamond particles in the clouds with such diamonds in the clouds sticking together and falling as diamond hail. As the diamond hail falls it is chemically etched by the hydrogen in these planets under higher pressure and temperatures to reform methane gas. The resulting methane gas rises back to reform clouds to create a cycle of hydrogen-methane cloud forming diamond hail at higher elevations (by lightning) and the resulting diamond hail reforming hydrogen methane as it (the diamond) falls to lower elevations by temperatures for a diamond-hydrogen to methane cycle on these planets of similarity and analog to water-steam-ice cycle in thunderstorms on Earth. Such a cycle is important on these planets of Saturn and Jupiter to explain the prevailing presence of methane in their atmospheres. If the methane as by Baines and Delitsky is irreversibly converted to elemental carbon and to graphite at lower elevation and irreversibly to diamond at even lower elevations in Saturn and Jupiter then the atmospheres would be completely stripped of methane which is inconsistent with the persisting hydrogen, methane ammonia clouds of these planets. But unlike Baines and Delitsky prior theory of diamond forming toward the interior of these planets as the carbon falls (2013), Reginald Little asserts that the diamond forms in the clouds directly from frequent lightning striking the elemental carbon in the clouds. Reginald Little in 2005 also proposed that lightning striking Kimberlites on earth may explain diamond in certain Kimberlitic rocks relative to non producing Kimberlitic rock on Earth. Reginald Little correlated the most producing Kimberlitic rock with regions on the Earth with the highest yearly frequency cloud to ground lightning central to southern Africa. Prior to the birth of science, over thousands of years ago some ancient people in India believed that diamonds form by lightning striking rock but this belief was non scientific as there was no <b>elemental</b> <b>basis</b> for diamond and they believed granite would form diamond as well as slates, phyllites, mylonite, jade, marble, soapstone, and serpentine. The true theory and prediction came with Reginald Little in 2000. As only Carbonaceous rock perhaps with some iron only form diamond when struck by lightning. Extending this theory to other planets of Saturn and Jupiter as inspired by Baines and Delitsky, rather naturally and beautifully reasons direct transformation of elemental carbon to diamond by lightning at high elevation in the clouds of Saturn and Jupiter is not subject to thermodynamics of chemically etching of diamond and mixing in the interior of the planets. As at higher elevations in the clouds of these planets the temperature is very low so such thermodynamic mixing is infeasible but the thermal quenching of the lightning transformed diamond is feasible. This model and mechanism of Reginald Little is also not subject to the low methane concentration argument. as the carbon is concentrated in from initial low methane concentrations by prior lightning strikes. So very frequent lightning strikes and severe lightning storms in these planets tend to support. Reginald Little diamond cloud theory in Saturn and Jupiter.! ...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} was to {{determine}} how to change the environmental performance of electricity generation depending on the resources and their shares, in order to support decision-makers. Additionally, this paper presents an application of life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology to determine the environmental burdens of electricity generation in Turkey. Electricity generation data in Turkey for the years 2012 and 2023 were used as a case study. The functional unit for electricity generation was 1 kWh. The LCA calculations were carried out using CML-IA (v 3. 00) data and the results were interpreted with respect to Monte Carlo simulation analysis (with the Monte Carlo function built in SimaPro 8. 0. 1 software). The results demonstrated that the fossil fuel consumption not only contributes to global warming, but it also has effects on the <b>elemental</b> <b>basis</b> of abiotic depletion due to raw material consumption for plant infrastructure. Additionally, it was observed that the increasing proportion of wind power in the electricity mix would also increase certain life cycle impacts (such as the <b>elemental</b> <b>basis</b> of abiotic depletion, human ecotoxicity, and terrestrial ecotoxicity) in Turkey’s geography compared to increasing the share of other renewable energy sources, such as hydropower, geothermal, as well as solar...|$|E

Design/methodology/approach - Case study approach was selected as the most appropriate for the study and semi-structured interviews, document review and direct observations were used for the data collection. Four case studies were conducted. Eight semi-structured interviews were conducted among four cases. Further, document review was used in three cases, and direct observation was used in one case. The validation of the results was not possible in a real life project due to time limitations. Findings- The findings identified six labour productivity factors (LPFs) affecting the LP of ASF. The need for LPNs for ASF on an <b>elemental</b> <b>basis</b> is identified. Further, LPNs were developed using LPFs. Research limitations/implications - This research was limited to LHPs for underserved settlements in Colombo, Sri Lanka which use ASF. The LPNs were prepared based on time studies and were restricted to structural elements such as slabs, beams and columns. Originality/value - The LPNs were developed for ASF in LHPs based on the effect of weather, crew, site, management and project factors. Further, the study addresses a gap in the literature regarding the development of LPNs of ASF for LPHs in Sri Lanka.

Psy-g-PMA grades have been synthesized and characterized on structural <b>basis</b> (<b>elemental</b> analysis, FTIR spectroscopy, intrinsic viscosity study) as well as morphological and thermal studies, taking psyllium as reference. The effects of reaction time, amount of monomer and silver sulfate (free radical initiator) on grafting of PMA on psyllium backbone have been studied. It is observed that all the grades of Psy-g-PMA have higher intrinsic viscosities than that of psyllium. The best synthesized grade was Psy-g-PMA having intrinsic viscosity of 6.93 and 58  % grafting of PMA on the main polymer backbone. Further Psy-g-PMA applications as flocculants for waste water treatment have been investigated. Psy-g-PMA resulted in higher decrease in the flocculation parameters such as total dissolved solid or total solids compared to psyllium.

40|$|Abstract. Among the {{questions}} that ecosystem-based management raises for economists is how to partition uses of the many biological, chemical and physical attributes of marine ecosystems into sets of property rights that undergird total ocean wealth. An <b>elemental</b> <b>basis</b> of property rights for fisheries involves the interplay between ecological and technological interactions, including sideeffects (externalities), and transaction costs. Fisheries management typically divides ownership by species. Divided ownership is efficient where production requires specialized skills and technologies and/or where interactions are negligible. When damages caused by side-effects are substantial, divided ownership might be used either by attenuating (e. g., gear restrictions) or excluding (e. g., zoning) a subset of attribute rights, provided that the opportunity (reduced output) and transaction costs of restrictions/exclusions are less than damages in their absence. However, uncertainty about resource dynamics, the recurrent nature of interactions, the complexity of numerous contractual stipulations owing to multi-attribute resources, and practical enforcement problems make it likely that the transaction costs of divided ownership are great at this time. Alternatively, property rights could be bundled into sets wherein tradeoffs across margins which promote the total wealth of a multi-attribute, common pool asset would be decided internally by a governance organization.

This paper describes recent developments in ecological and biological stoichiometry that unify these aspects of Lotka's work. Stoichiometrically explicit versions of the Lotka-Volterra equations capture key missing aspects of food web interactions, such as the effects of food quality and nutrient recycling feedbacks, and encompass a richer, and potentially more realistic, set of dynamics than non-stoichiometric models. These stoichiometric models are now being further extended to include the recently discovered effects of excess dietary nutrient content on consumer performance. The multi-dimensional capacity of stoichiometric models is likely to be of particular value given the pressing need to anticipate the ecological effects of globally dynamic perturbations of multiple chemical elements (e. g. C, N, and P) due to human actions. *Cover Letter Dear Ferenc: We were pleased to receive the thoughtful and helpful reviews of our “Lotka re-loaded” manuscript for Ecological Modelling.

40|$|Differences between stutterers and nonstutterers in {{temporal}} or-ganization of fluent speech {{may offer}} {{clues to the}} <b>elemental</b> <b>basis</b> of fully elaborated, perceptible stuttering events. Guided by this hypothesis, we investigated voice onset time&mdash;the interval be-tween voice onset and upper articulatory stop release&mdash;in voiced stop consonants under varying constraints. Under variation of rate, lexical stress location, and location of key words beginning with voiced stops, the stutterers realized voiced stops by voicing before release (prevoicing), whereas the controls realized voiced stops by voicing following the release. The significance of this phonetic strategy difference for understanding and treating stut-tering is discussed. The study of timing and sequencing of gestures underlying the fluent and disfluent speech of stutterers has gained impe-tus with recent advances in speech technology and models of speech production. The issue of timing has been raised in re-lation to (a) perceptible stuttering events such as part-word repetitions (Viswanath & Neel, 1995) and (b) perceptibly flu-ent utterances (e. g., Agnello, 1975; Hillman & Gilbert, 1977; Zimmerman, 1980). Partly as consequence of these studies, several researchers have suggested that stutterers ’ intermittent (perceptible) speech breakdowns, frequently recognized as &dquo;moments of stuttering,&dquo; are but {{the tip of the}} iceberg (Adams & Runyan, 1981; Zebrowski, Conture, & Cudahy, 1985). This suggestion carries the strong implication that even when stut-terers appear to be fluent, they may be subtly aberrant. Con-sistent with this suggestion, Viswanath (1989) and Viswanath and Rosenfield (1991) proposed that such subtle aberrancies are likely in utterance locations where stutterers typically ex-perience their greatest difficulty, namely, the beginning of words in relation to variables such as lexical stress, rate, and word location that predispose stutterers to stutter.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of research and practical approbation of formal methods for describing object-oriented programs suitable for automatic generation of programs text to the programming language. As formal models, the functional and relational models are used. The functional model re{{presents the}} program as a scheme of the connection of functional atomic objects that are capable of direct interaction by forming dynamic connections and automatic computations, which can be represented graphically. In this case, the connection scheme of objects is considered as a scheme of task solving. It is shown that the formalization of the task solution scheme, rather than the entire programming paradigm, makes the process of program creating more suitable for the practice. The requirements for atomic objects are determined as such, which form the <b>elemental</b> <b>basis</b> of the objectoriented program. The relational model represents the object as a virtual relationship, the scheme which is specified by the class that implements the functional dependence of non-key attributes from the key ones by their calculations, which makes it possible to apply relational operations to describe the scheme of task solving. The relational model allows using a language which is similar to the structured query language of databases, to describe the scheme of solving the task and to perform it automatically. It is shown that the functional and relational models are suitable for graphical representation of the task solution scheme and are sufficiently expressive for direct generation of programs. In fact, the developed models allow us to increase the process of creating object-oriented programs to a higher level, focusing on the structure of the program, rather than on its components, and to eliminate the lack of methods for presenting programs. The programming technology of active dynamic connections of objects {{has been used as a}} basis for practical implementation. ? ?????? ???????????? ?????????? ???????????? ? ???????????? ????????? ?????????? ??????? ???????? ????????-??????????????? ????????, ????????? ??? ?????????????? ????????? ?????? ???????? ?? ????? ????????????????. ? ???????? ?????????? ??????? ???????????? ?????????????? ? ??????????? ??????. ?????????????? ?????? ???????????? ????????? ??? ????? ?????????? ?????????????? ????????? ????????, ????????? ? ????????????????? ?????????????? ????? ??????????? ???????????? ?????????? ? ?????????????? ??????????, ??????? ????? ?????????????? ? ??????????? ?????. ??? ???? ????? ?????????? ???????? ??????????????? ??? ????? ??????? ??????. ????????, ??? ???????????? ?????? ????? ??????? ??????, ? ?? ???? ????????? ????????????????, ?????? ??????? ???????? ????????? ?????? ???????????? ? ????????. ?????????? ?????????? ? ????????? ???????? ??? ???????, ??? ?????????? ?????????? ???? ????????-??????????????? ?????????. ??????????? ?????? ???????????? ?????? ??? ??????????? ?????????, ????? ???????? ???????? ???????, ??????? ????????? ?????????????? ??????????? ?????????? ????????? ?? ???????? ????? ?? ??????????, ??? ????????? ????????? ??????????? ???????? ??? ???????? ????? ??????? ??????. ??????????? ?????? ????????? ???????????? ????, ???????? ?????????????????? ????? ???????? ? ????? ??????, ??? ???????? ????? ??????? ?????? ? ?? ??????????????? ??????????. ????????, ??? ?????????????? ? ??????????? ?????? ???????? ??? ???????????? ????????????? ????? ??????? ?????? ? ???????? ?????????? ?????????????? ??? ???????????????? ????????? ????????. ??????????, ????????????? ?????? ????????? ??????? ??????? ???????? ????????-??????????????? ???????? ?? ??????? ????, ??????????????? ?? ????????? ?????????, ? ?? ?? ?? ????????????, ? ????????? ?????? ? ???????????? ??????? ????????????? ????????. ? ???????? ?????? ??? ???????????? ?????????? ???????????? ?????????? ???????????????? ???????? ???????????? ?????????? ????????...|$|E

Throughout my college education, work on this project will be continued towards launching a career as a professional artist in a public exhibition with multi-media fiber/paint pieces with the same unified themes of the tarot and visual narration. Tarot divination cards were used as inspiration in honor of remembering the traditions of the past. The intent was to portray individual cards in a visual language that was both readable to modern culture, and expressive of personal memories and beliefs. The creative process for this project began with research into the astrological and <b>elemental</b> <b>basis</b> of individual cards and exploration of the work of modern artist's who combined fiber and painting mediums, used visual narration, or put their own personal spin on the tarot. As part of the brainstorming process, a series of thumbnail sketches were created in order to workout formal issues and express concepts visually. A full-sized reproduction of the chosen thumbnail for each piece was created and revamped if necessary, then used as a template for the final piece.   Before the final pieces could be created, a series of fourteen different samples were used to test out which processes and mediums would be best suited for the final works. Methods and mediums tested include: shibori, batik, various fabric resists and discharges, immersion and batch dying methods, hand-embroidery stitches, machine-stitching, couching, hand beading, and various methods of applying gesso and paint to portions of cotton fabric.   A valuable conclusion arrived at through this research, are how {{it is very important to}} view the work of other artists, and to sketch, plan, and test techniques prior to creating successful final pieces of artwork.

Additionally, it is important to stretch fabric prior to painting portions of it, even if it will be removed from the stretchers for final presentation, otherwise the gesso and paint create permanent wrinkles in the fabric. This project requires continued research in order to reconcile whether painting or fiber techniques should hold more dominance or equal standing in my art, and to discover a similar balance between figures and backgrounds. Most importantly, developing diligent habits and work ethics are necessar...|$|E
40|$|Urban Reaction The thesis {{proposal}} {{comes out}} {{as a result of}} seeing the City of Brussels as a Mundaneum. At the beginning of the process, an analysis of the two main axis of the city revealed that the area that is in direct relation with the canal and the actual Harbour is not defined. Which is why, this area was choose as a possible site for the project. Historically speaking, the canal and all the infrastructure that relates with it had been remove in several occasions along time. At present days, the harbour is intended to be moved once again, leaving this area as a vacant space, creating a hole in the city. As an urban reaction, the idea is to keep this empty space which will be generated and give it to the city, creating a new park in the area which will include this location in the structure of parks of Brussels. Furthermore, the project proposes the generation of a new primary element which will border the park {{in order to avoid the}} city to invade the space. Public Pools Program The Mundaneum was a project proposed by Paul Oulet, considered as a building that would hold together all the knowledge of the world. As a first reaction to the problem of Mundaneum, it is intended for the primary element to act as a counter project for the other parks of the city. In one hand, all the other important parks are located in the highest points of the topography while the project is proposed for the lowest part of it. Also, the other parks contain buildings that are in direct relation with the expression of power, either political or religious. The thesis proposed a project that will hold a program that is not related with power, but a project for people. As long as one of the main elements of the site is the presence of water, and, that public baths since Roman Empire had always been considered as monuments for people. It was decided that this program was the most suitable for the proposed building. Design Infrastructures are primary elements per excellence because they either can accelerate or retard the urban process. In order to create a primary element in this point it was decided to create a new infrastructure which at the same time will provide a service for the city, it will work with the canal and hold the public program. In order to do this, the thesis proposed to merge in one single element architecture and infrastructure. In this sense, the thesis creates a water treatment plant merged with the program of a public pool. The building takes the water from the canal, purifies it and uses it for the pools, giving the building the spirit of machine that creates its own <b>elemental</b> <b>basis</b> to generate leisure for people. The Building is composed by system of steel truss frame structures created by the repetition and placement of a basic element of 7, 5 by 7, 5 m, which allows to create a mega structure of 600 m long by 260 m wide capable to save long distances without support and hold the machinery needed for the infrastructure and to generate the spaces needed for the program. This steel structure composes the main load bearing system, which is revealed in the façade, giving the building the expression of a giant industrial machine. Furthermore, the main load bearing system holds together a serious of substructures that contain the inside spaces and are based on modular systems that come out from the dimensions of the main structure. The substructures change in scale from outside to inside, maintaining the monumentality of the infrastructure to the outside and transforming it to the scale of a building to the inside. At the inside, the process of water purification is revealed becoming part of the public program of the building. Metaphor The expression that was looked for the building is the expression of an old fabric in which the pools become a piece of purified water inside an space which may not be considered as a proper environment for this type of program, the purified pools come as a result of a process of the re use of the polluted water from the canal, as an analogy of how infrastructures generate the base for societies to work. This analogy becomes a metaphor of a Mundaneum, because there is no need for the project to stack pieces of knowledge production because society is the one that produces knowledge demonstrating that it can also be a project devoted for people as long as it creates an absolute outbreak in our traditional way of life, and this project creates that outbreak in an urban, architectural, and programmatic levels.
