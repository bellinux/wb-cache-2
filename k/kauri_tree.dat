40|$|Tree {{species can}} affect the soil they are growing on and this might {{influence}} their fitness. The New Zealand gymnosperm <b>tree</b> species <b>kauri</b> (Agathis australis (D. Don) Lindl.) which grows in mixed angiosperm¿gymnosperm forests has a substantial effect upon the soil. We studied the hypotheses that: (1) low soil moisture availability below mature <b>kauri</b> <b>trees</b> hampers growth of kauri seedlings and angiosperm seedlings, (2) low nutrient availability below <b>kauri</b> <b>trees</b> hampers only angiosperm seedlings, and (3) angiosperm seedlings are hampered more than kauri seedlings by the conditions below <b>kauri</b> <b>trees.</b> We tested these hypotheses by planting seedlings of kauri and mapau (Myrsine australis (A. Rich) Allan) under <b>kauri</b> <b>trees</b> and applying the following treatments: removal of herbs, removal of litter, removal of nutrient limitation, and elimination of root competition of mature <b>kauri</b> <b>trees.</b> The results indicate that low soil moisture availability, or the combination of low soil moisture availability and low nutrient fertility, hampers the growth of kauri as well as mapau seedlings below <b>kauri</b> <b>trees.</b> The mapau seedlings are hampered relatively more than the kauri seedlings which might result in an increased relative fitness of the latte...|$|R

50|$|Prior to European settlement, the Beach Haven {{area was}} covered to the water’s edge by thick bush, pohutukawa, ferns and giant <b>kauri</b> <b>trees.</b> Maori tribes {{inhabited}} the area, but were decimated by wars and finally {{succumbed to the}} newly acquired guns of Hongi Hika. In 1844 the area was sold to the Government and became deserted. One of the first settlers in the district established an orchard near Soldier’s Bay and as the <b>kauri</b> <b>trees</b> were gradually removed from the land, it {{was found to be}} an ideal place for fruit growing, especially grapes and strawberries.

40|$|Plants {{can change}} the soil that they grow on, for example by {{producing}} litter. If litter characteristics are such that their effect on the soil increases a plant's fitness, a positive feedback can develop between the plant and the soil. Several studies indicate that New Zealand <b>kauri</b> <b>trees</b> (Agathis australis) lower the availability of nutrients in the soil beneath their crown. Low nutrient availability would be positive {{for the survival of}} kauri seedlings as they are known to use nutrients more efficiently than angiosperm species. We tested the hypotheses that nutrient availability is lower and light availability is higher beneath <b>kauri</b> <b>trees</b> than beneath the surrounding angiosperm vegetation. We determined the availability of nutrients (using leaf nutrient concentrations as a proxy), soil moisture, and light in both situations. As a reference we did the same measurements in tea tree vegetation (Leptospermum scoparium and Kunzea ericoides) where kauri seedlings were abundant. The availability of nitrogen, phosphorus and calcium was lower under kauri than in the surrounding vegetation. Further, in a dry period the availability of water in the organic layer surrounding the kauri trunk was lower than in the mineral soil further away from the kauri trunk. We suggest that periodic drought explains why the density of kauri seedlings under mature <b>kauri</b> <b>trees</b> is less than in tea <b>tree</b> vegetation. <b>Kauri</b> seedlings are more tolerant of drought and low nutrient availability than other tree seedlings and we conclude that the conditions under mature kauri give kauri seedlings an advantage over seedlings of other tree species. The low nutrient availability under mature <b>kauri</b> <b>trees</b> supports the idea of a positive soil¿plant feedback driven by poor decomposability of kauri litter...|$|R
