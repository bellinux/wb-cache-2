So in order to run the Incremental Algorithm, first a preference order of attributes has to be given.

25|$|Broadly, {{negative}} priming is {{also known}} as the mechanism by which inhibitory control is applied to cognition. This refers only to the inhibition stimuli that can interfere with the current short-term goal of creating a response. The effectiveness of inhibiting the interferences depends on the cognitive control mechanism as a higher number of <b>distractors</b> yields higher load on working memory. Increased load on working memory can in turn result in slower perceptual processing leading to delayed reaction. Therefore, negative priming effect depends on the amount of <b>distractors,</b> effectiveness of the cognitive control mechanism and the availability of the cognitive control resources.|$|E
40|$|Eye {{movements}} {{towards a}} new target can be guided or disrupted by input from multiple modalities. The degree of oculomotor competition evoked by a <b>distractor</b> depends on both <b>distractor</b> and target properties, such as <b>distractor</b> salience or certainty regarding the target location. The ability to localize {{the target is}} particularly important when studying saccades made towards auditory targets, since determination of elevation and azimuth of a sound are based on different processes, and these processes may be affected independently by a <b>distractor.</b> We investigated {{the effects of a}} visual <b>distractor</b> on saccadic eye movements made to an auditory target in a two-dimensional plane. Results showed that the competition evoked by a vertical visual <b>distractor</b> was stronger compared with a horizontal visual <b>distractor.</b> The eye movements that were not captured by the vertical visual <b>distractor</b> were still influenced by it: a deviation of endpoints was seen {{in the direction of the}} visual <b>distractor.</b> Furthermore, the interference evoked by a high-contrast visual <b>distractor</b> was stronger compared with low-contrast visual stimuli, which was reflected by a faster initiation of an eye movement towards the high-contrast visual <b>distractor</b> and a stronger shift of endpoints in the direction of the high-contrast visual <b>distractor.</b> Together, these findings show that the influence of a visual <b>distractor</b> on aurally guided eye movements depends strongly on its location relative to the target, and to a lesser extent, on stimulus contrast. © 2014 Springer-Verlag...|$|R

25|$|Distractor {{inhibition}} {{model is}} the oldest model that explains the negative priming effect {{as the result of}} selective attention to a target stimulus. When we pay attention to a particular stimulus, we perceive other stimuli surrounding the target as <b>distractors</b> in order to help focus. But when one of those <b>distractors</b> becomes the new target of attention, our response to the target is hampered due to immediate residual inhibition. Selective attention is the ability to respond to a specific object when there are other <b>distractors</b> that also compete for a response. To explain this selective attention, the distractor inhibition model proposes a dual mechanism involving excitation to boost target signal and inhibition to suppress <b>distractors.</b> This inhibition is triggered when there is a mismatch between the internal representations of the target and a distractor. Inhibition of the distractor's internal representation is a way of helping to selectively attend to the target stimulus. This inhibition decays gradually when the stimulus is no longer present to help with the next target. However, if a distractor stimulus is re-encountered as the target, the internal representation of the distractor stimulus may continue to be suppressed because it is too soon for the decay to dissipate already. This {{is referred to as the}} transient residual inhibition. This inhibition also impairs the processing of an appropriate response to the new target stimulus and results in greater reaction time.|$|E
25|$|Emotion {{has been}} found to {{modulate}} the magnitude of the visual extinction deficit, so that items that signal emotional relevance (e.g., spiders) {{are more likely to be}} processed in the presence of competing <b>distractors</b> than nonemotional items (e.g., flowers).|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the issues}} found with the distractor {{inhibition}} model, Tipper and Houghton modified the distractor inhibition model to account for long-term negative priming effects. The original inhibition account proposed that inhibition occurs only when the <b>distractors</b> are suppressed. The Houghton–Tipper model revised this proposition and claims that inhibition occurs during both the encoding of <b>distractors</b> and the retrieval of that memory. The main reason for this change is to explain the long-term negative priming and justify it using the new combined model. When a repeated distractor becomes the target, processing of this stimulus automatically retrieves {{the memory of the}} stimulus being inhibited as a distractor. This model suggests that inhibition occurs when ignoring the distractor and during the memory retrieval of the previous ignorance of the stimulus. Therefore, it incorporates the inhibition account in selective attention and the episode retrieval model.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. It {{has been}} argued that salient <b>distractor</b> items {{displayed}} during rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) trigger an attentional blink (AB) when they share features with the target item. Here we demonstrate that salient <b>distractor</b> words induce an AB independently of feature overlap with the target. In two experiments a color-highlighted irrelevant word preceded a target by a variable lag in an RSVP series of false font strings. Target identification was reduced at short relative to long temporal lags between the <b>distractor</b> word and the target, irrespective of feature sharing with the <b>distractor</b> word. When the target shared features with the <b>distractor</b> word, target accuracy was reduced across all lags. Accordingly, feature sharing between the <b>distractor</b> word and the target did not amplify the AB, but had an additive effect on attentional capture by the <b>distractor</b> word...|$|R
40|$|The role of {{salience}} in localized attentional interference (LAI) was examined. In two experiments, {{target discrimination}} performance was measured {{as a function}} of the spatial separation between the target and a salient <b>distractor</b> item. In Experiment 1, both the salience of the <b>distractor</b> and that of a target were manipulated. <b>Distractor</b> salience was manipulated via size changes to the <b>distractor,</b> and target salience was manipulated by using unmasked or onset targets. When the target was of low salience, the magnitude of interference from the <b>distractor</b> increased with <b>distractor</b> salience. However, when the target had an abrupt onset, the <b>distractor</b> had no impact on target performance. In Experiment 2, the attentional salience of the <b>distractor</b> was manipulated using a probability manipulation. Displays contained both a target and a color singleton <b>distractor.</b> The color singleton produced LAI when it was predictive of the target location but not when it was unpredictive of the target location. The results of both experiments are consistent with models of competition-based attentional selection. This work was supported by Grant EY 1368701 from the National Eye Institute.

40|$|Closing in Behaviour (CIB) in graphic copying tasks is the {{tendency}} to copy extremely close to or {{on top of the}} original model. It is exhibited in pre-school children, particularly from age 3 to 5 and is also exhibited in dementia patients (Gainotti, 1972). Chieffi, Ricci & Carlomagno (2001) proposed that CIB may be the extreme manifestation of the <b>distractor</b> effect.

Twenty-Eight children participated in this study. CIB was assessed using a preliminary graphic copying task.

40|$|Perceptual {{grouping}} {{plays an}} indispensable role on attention distribution. An {{example of this}} interaction is the impaired visual search performance when the target overlaps with a task-irrelevant salient <b>distractor</b> organized to a snake-like configuration by collinear bars, and when the collinear <b>distractor</b> is long enough (Jingling & Tseng, 2013). This phenomenon is puzzling because it is opposite {{to our understanding of}} attention capture which predicts search facilitation instead of impairment. As an attempt to fully understand the interaction between perceptual grouping and attention, the current research probed the possible neural stage of this collinear search impairment effect. In Study 1, the <b>distractor</b> column of the search display was split into two eyes: one eye saw a <b>distractor</b> with varied length (= 1, 5, or 9 bars) while the other eye saw the rest of the <b>distractor</b> column. When both eyes were properly fused, observers saw a search display containing a 9 -bar <b>distractor.</b> Observers were asked to identify the orientation of a target gap that could be overlapping or non-overlapping with the <b>distractor.</b> It was found that search impairment was dominated by monocular collinear <b>distractor</b> length. In Study 2, a 9 -bar <b>distractor</b> was shown to one eye of observers and strong flashing color patches were shown to the other eye (Continuous Flash Suppression) such that part of the <b>distractor</b> was suppressed from observers’ awareness. It was found that invisible collinear <b>distractor</b> parts enhanced search impairment, suggesting awareness of the <b>distractor</b> is not necessary for the effect. Results from both studies converge to suggest that the effect of collinear grouping on attention is likely to be at early visual sites like V 1 where monocular information but not awareness is processed. It highlights the need to incorporate perceptual grouping into current salience-based attention models. published_or_final_versionPsychologyMasterMaster of Philosoph...|$|R
25|$|There {{are a few}} {{problems}} associated with this inhibition model. This model accounts for negative priming only when the stimuli are repetitively ignored as <b>distractors</b> during a goal directed behavior of selecting the target stimulus. This model does not support negative priming effects found in cases short of goal directed behavior. Another issue is that negative priming effects {{have been found to}} be long-term contradicting to the proposed transient residual inhibition. Long-term persistence of negative priming questions the validity of the distractor inhibition model.|$|E
25|$|Neurological {{evidence}} of negative priming effects is being researched to help understand the physiological aspects {{and to develop}} more accurate models. The most common method to find such neurological evidence is by neuroimaging the brain using fMRI while subjects go through experiments of tasks that prompt negative priming effects. The two primary bases for neurological evidence are the internal representations of stimuli and memory retrieval. Most significantly activated regions of the brain are the left temporal lobe, inferior parietal lobe, and the prefrontal cortex of the frontal lobe. Evidence for internal representations {{are found in the}} left anterior temporal cortex, which has been associated with abstract semantic knowledge representations. Left anterolateral temporal cortex was found to be directly related to the magnitude of negative priming effect. The inferior parietal lobe is connected to the shifts in attention that occurs when attending to the <b>distractors</b> and the target. The inferior parietal cortex activated whenever attention shifted from the distractor to target stimulus or vice versa. Another significant area of activation was found in the prefrontal cortex. The superior, inferior, and medial frontal gyri, and the medial prefrontal cortex exhibited activation during the negative priming tasks. Activations in the frontal lobe has been associated with inhibitory network and selective attention. Similarly, evidences for semantic representations and temporal lobe activations are used to support the episode retrieval model. Additional investigations of the neurophysiological data of negative priming are necessary to further clarify the relationship between selective attention and memory in negative priming.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{a recent}} study, we {{observed}} that saccadic distraction (i. e., the remote <b>distractor</b> effect, RDE) was reduced when target and <b>distractor</b> were displayed at unequal contrast [Born, S., & Kerzel, D. (2008). Influence of target and <b>distractor</b> contrast {{on the remote}} <b>distractor</b> effect. Vision Research, 48 (28), 2805 – 2816]. We hypothesized that arrival times explain the RDE modulation: With equal contrast, target and <b>distractor</b> signals arrive simultaneously in the oculomotor system so that mutual inhibition (and therefore saccadic distraction) is largest. With unequal contrast, high-contrast signals arrive earlier than low-contrast signals, resulting in less mutual inhibition and little saccadic distraction. In the current contribution, we presented target and <b>distractor</b> at different stimulus onset asynchronies (SOA) to re-align arrival times with unequal contrast. Results confirmed that unequal contrast of target and <b>distractor</b> reduced saccadic distraction with simultaneous presentation and that strong distraction could be reestablished by introducing a SOA. However, maximal saccadic distraction also varied strongly with the specific combination of target and <b>distractor</b> contrast. Thus, contrast may not only modulate arrival times of target and <b>distractor</b> signals, but also their strength in the mutual inhibition process. Finally, we found more saccadic distraction when the <b>distractor</b> was presented slightly after the target. A second experiment suggests that alerting effects superimposed on the distraction contribute to this effect, but may not fully explain it. We suggest that distraction may be strongest when the rise-to-threshold of the target-related signal has already advanced...|$|R

40|$|Meeting {{abstract}} {{presented at}} VSS 2013 Session - Visual search: AttentionOpen Access JournalPerceptual grouping plays an indispensable role on figure/ground segregation and attention distribution. However, its relation with visual attention {{is not well}} understood yet. Jingling & Tseng (2012) reported that visual search was harder when the target overlapped with a global <b>distractor</b> constituted by collinear elements but not by non-collinear elements. The present study aims at investigating how early this collinear grouping affects selective search in visual pathway. Our observers viewed a 9 x 9 search display containing identical vertical (or horizontal) bars except a randomly selected <b>distractor</b> column consisting of orthogonal bars. This <b>distractor</b> was grouped into a collinear (snake-like) or non-collinear (ladder-like) organization. Participants judged orientation of a target located either on the <b>distractor</b> column or the other columns. In Experiment 1, we varied the <b>distractor</b> length (= 1, 5, or 9 bars) and found search impairment occurred only at the visual display when the collinear <b>distractor</b> reached a critical length (= 5 bars), not under or when <b>distractor</b> is non-collinear. In Experiment 2, we used a stereoscope to split the <b>distractor</b> column into two eyes: one eye saw a <b>distractor</b> column with varied length (distractor_length_mono = 1, 5, or 9 bars) while the other eye saw the rest parts of the <b>distractor.</b> When both eyes were properly fused, observers saw a search display identical to Experiment 1 with the longest <b>distractor</b> length (distractor_length_bino = 9 bars). If collinear contour affected visual search after binocular fusion, the search impairment effect should be observable in all three conditions. However, we found that observers’ RTs were identical to that in Experiment 1, suggesting monocular collinear contour information dictated selective attention. Our results imply {{that the effect of}} collinear grouping on attention is likely to be driven by bottom-up processes. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R

The pattern of results was unaltered when potentially confounding information from individual visual cues was removed. The availability of stereoscopic information reduced the effect.
