It was found that the maximum change in water permeability of TBTCl- and TPhTCl-exposed fish occurred after 14 days and 21 days, respectively; thereafter there was an increase towards control values, suggesting adaptaion to compensate for the effects of the organotin exposure. Drinking rates increased significantly in both organotin groups but urine production rates did not change.

40|$|Many species gain {{protection}} from predators by forming groups, {{but there is}} also evidence that some predators are better able to detect or more likely to attack grouped prey. Given this, it might pay prey to be flexible in their group behavior, forming groups on detecting certain predators, but dispersing when detecting others. In the first of 2 experiments, we found that <b>flounders</b> (<b>Platichthys</b> <b>flesus)</b> were more likely to attack larger groups of gammarids (Gammarus pulex) than smaller ones, whereas sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) showed no such bias. This gave us the opportunity to test the idea that prey might show predator-specific grouping responses. Accordingly, our second experiment compared the grouping behavior of gammarids exposed to kairomones from either of the 2 predators, to conspecific injury cues (a nonspecific predation cue), to combinations of predator kairomone plus conspecific injury cues and finally to 2 control treatments. We predicted, based on our first experiment, that the gammarids would disperse in response to flounder kairomones, and group more cohesively in response to stickleback kairomones and conspecific injury cues. In fact, only the treatments including conspecific injury cues elicited a grouping response in the gammarids, whereas predator kairomones alone had no effect whatsoever on group cohesion or dispersal. We discuss possible explanations for these findings and briefly consider other systems that might be better suited to exploring predator-specific antipredatory grouping behavior.

40|$|Field {{studies in}} various {{polluted}} coastal areas in Europe and the United States of America clearly indicate a relation between pollution {{and the increase}} in prevalence of tumours and infectious diseases in fish. One of the chemicals of interest in the myriad of xenobiotics found in polluted waters and sediments is the organotin compound tributyltin (TBT), originating mainly from antifouling paints used on the hulls of ships. This report describes a study in which <b>flounders</b> (<b>Platichthys</b> <b>flesus)</b> were exposed to bis(tri-n-butyltin) oxide (TBTO) in the water under controlled laboratory conditions. The possible histopathological effects on several organs (gill, skin, eye, liver, mesonephros, ovary/testis, spleen, and gastrointestinal tract) were examined and morphometric analysis of the thymus was performed to assess the target organ(s) for TBTO in this fish species. Also the function of the non specific and specific resistance was studied using ex vivo/ in vitro immune function tests. Exposure of flounder to TBTO, in concentrations which are in the same order of magnitude as maximum TBT levels measured in the field (experiment: 17. 3 mug TBT; field: 7. 2 mug TBT), caused mortality after 7 - 12 days, decreased the condition factor, resulted in gill lesions, and induced significant reduction of the non specific resistance.

40|$|The {{contamination}} of the Gironde Estuary, southwest of France, by polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) was assessed using six fish of high ecological and economic importance as bioindicator species. The concentrations of 21 PCB congeners and total fat contents were determined in the muscle and liver of eels (Anguilla anguilla), seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax), <b>flounders</b> (<b>Platichthys</b> <b>flesus),</b> meagres (Argyrosomus regius), mullets (Liza ramada), and soles (Solea vulgaris). In addition, information regarding the trophic ecology of the studied fish was obtained through the analysis of carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes (i. e., delta C- 13 and delta N- 15) in muscle. Results revealed high PCB concentrations in fish compared to monitored European estuaries. The muscle of eels {{was by far the}} most contaminated fish flesh (Sigma(7) PCBs = 1000 +/- 440 ng g(- 1), on a dry weight basis), while the higher PCB concentrations in liver were measured in flounder (Sigma(7) PCBs = 2040 +/- 1160 ng g(- 1), d. w.). A quantile regression approach allowed to investigate the fate of PCBs in the Gironde estuarine fish assemblage, and revealed a general process of trophic magnification. Finally, most of the analysed fish presented PCB concentrations in muscle meat above the current European maximum limits for sea products, while the derived "Toxic Equivalent Quantity" (TEQ) revealed human health concerns only for high-fat fish consumption...|$|R
40|$|From December 1990 to December 1992 the {{multidisciplinary}} research project 'Fish diseases in the North Sea' {{has been carried}} out. The aim of this biological effect monitoring has been the registration of spatial distribution patterns of environmental pollution by different biological and chemical methods. Therefore dabs (Limanda limanda L.) from 34 NSTF sampling sites and <b>flounders</b> (<b>Platichthys</b> <b>flesus</b> L.) from 7 estuaries have been investigated. The activity of hepatic mixed function monooxygenase (MFO), {{has been one of}} the investigated biological parameters. MFOs are of central importance in biotransformation of xenobiotics. MFO activity is a sensitive indicator and reflects exposure to chemical inducers. The main inducers are PCB and PAH. Because MFO activity can be related quantitatively to the extent of pollutant exposure, such studies of molecular effects can be used as a bioassay of the presence and effects of pollutants. Along the North Frisian coast high MFO activities were found. They increased from south to north and from offshore to nearshore stations. Furthermore there is strong evidence for very high contaminant levels near oil platforms in the Ekofisk oilfield. Dabs from British offshore stations had the highest MFO activities. Decreasing MFO activities from the Firth of Forth to the mouth of Humber indicated a decreasing pollution gradient. Most of the estuaries also showed typical pollution gradients. Flounders from the river Elbe estuary had the highest MFO activities which decreased from the inner to the outer estuary. In the river Schelde we measured peaks of MFO activity as high as in the river Elbe estuary. In female dabs MFO activity is about five times higher than in flounders. Furthermore their MFO activity showed a negative correlation with stage of gonadal development. Therefore males should be used as indicator organisms. (orig.)

Radiotracers were used to measure hydromineral fluxes, the water balance and passive sodium efflux of chronically (35 days) exposed fish. The water permeabilities of exposed flounders varied {{during the course of}} the experiment and were significantly lower than the corresponding controls, that did not change significantly with time. It was found that the maximum change in water permeability of TBTCl- and TPhTClexposed fish occurred after 14 days and 21 days, respectively; thereafter there was an increase towards control values, suggesting adaptation to compensate for the effects of the organotin exposure. Drinking rates increased significantly in both organotin groups but urine production rates did not change. The effects of organotin exposure on the passive sodium efflux and Na+/K+-ATPase activity showed an inverted relationship in the TBT group, where the Na 7 K+-ATPase activity was reduced and the passive sodium efflux was increased. TPhT had no inhibitory effect on Na 7 K+-ATPase activity and the passive sodium efflux increased only gradually. The overall effect of these changes in these components of hydromineral regulation was to reduce the mean blood osmolalities of the organotin groups compared to the control values. The effects of chronic exposure to sediment-associated triorganotin compounds during sea water adaptation was examined and quantified by measuring the active sodium efflux, Na+/K+-ATPase activity and structural changes to the gill epithelium usually encountered in euryhaline fish during adaptation to sea water. Following the transfer to sea water, the Na+/K+-ATPase activity and the active sodium efflux were decreased in the TBT group but increased significantly in both the TPhT and control groups. Similarly, the morphological changes to the gill epithelium, involving chloride cell distribution, associated with sea water adaptation, took place in the control group and only partially in the TPhT group but were significantly inhibited or delayed in the TBT group. The exposure to organotin caused the mean blood osmolalities in fish of the TBT and TPhT to rise beyond the expected values that were observed in the control group. The results presented in this study lead to the conclusion that tri-tt-butyltin chloride and triphenyltin chloride in sediments are capable of significantly disrupting both the physiological as well as morphological components of osmoregulatory functions of an estuarine fish, at concentrations currently found in local sediments...|$|R

Species-specific Delta models with two sub-models were used: Binomial (presence/absence); Gamma (density when present). Models were fitted and tested on separate data sets to estimate the accuracy and robustness of predictions. Temperature, salinity and mud content in sediment were included in most models for presence/absence; salinity and depth in most models for density (when present). In Binomial models (presence/absence), goodness-of-fit, accuracy and robustness varied concurrently among species, and fair to high accuracy and robustness were attained for all species, in models with poor to high goodness-of-fit. But in Gamma models (density when present), goodness-of-fit was not indicative of accuracy and robustness. Only for <b>Platichthys</b> <b>flesus</b> were Gamma and also coupled Delta models (density) accurate and robust, despite some moderate bias and inconsistency in predicted density. The accuracy and robustness of final density estimations were defined by the accuracy and robustness of the estimations of presence/absence and density (when present) provided by the sub-models. The mismatches between goodness-of-fit, accuracy and robustness of positive density models, {{as well as the}} difference in performance of presence/absence and density models demonstrated the importance of validation procedures in the evaluation of the value of habitat suitability models as predictive tools.
