50|$|<b>Dimethylthiambutene</b> was {{developed}} in the United Kingdom in the late 1940s and introduced to the market by Burroughs-Wellcome in 1951. <b>Dimethylthiambutene</b> is now under international control under the UN Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs 1961, the laws governing habit-forming substances in virtually all countries and Schedule I of the US Controlled Substances Act of 1970 due to high abuse potential and never being introduced clinically in the United States; other countries regulate it much as morphine or diamorphine. Its DEA ACSCN is 9619 and it had a zero manufacturing quota in 2013.|$|E
50|$|Notable {{compounds}} include <b>dimethylthiambutene,</b> diethylthiambutene, ethylmethylthiambutene, pyrrolidinylthiambutene and piperidylthiambutene. Of these, ethylmethylthiambutene is {{the most}} potent, with 1.3x the potency of morphine, pyrrolidinylthiambutene is the least potent at 0.7x, and the rest are all around the same potency as morphine. Diethylthiambutene {{has been the most}} widely used, mainly in veterinary medicine.|$|E
50|$|Three {{of these}} {{compounds}} are explicitly listed as illegal drugs under UN convention, diethylthiambutene, <b>dimethylthiambutene</b> and ethylmethylthiambutene, {{and so are}} illegal throughout the world, but the rest will only be illegal {{in countries such as}} the USA, Australia and New Zealand that have laws equivalent to the Federal Analog Act.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dimethylthiambutene</b> (N,N-Dimethyl-1-methyl-3,3-di-2-thienylallylamine, DMTB, {{trade names}} Ohton, Aminobutene, Dimethibutin, Kobaton, Takaton, Dimethibutin) is an opioid {{analgesic}} drug, {{most often used}} in veterinary medicine in Japan {{and to a lesser}} extent in other countries in the region and around the world. It is the most prominent and widely used of the thiambutenes, a series of open-chain opioids structurally related to methadone which are also called the thienyl derivative opioids which also includes diethylthiambutene and ethylmethylthiambutene, as well as the non-opioid cough suppressant tipepidine.|$|E
50|$|Diethylthiambutene (Thiambutene, Themalon, Diethibutin, N,N-Diethyl-1-methyl-3,3-di-2-thienylallylamine) is an opioid {{analgesic}} drug {{developed in the}} 1950s which was mainly used as an anesthetic in veterinary medicine and continues, {{along with the other}} two thiambutenes <b>dimethylthiambutene</b> and ethylmethylthiambutene to be used for this purpose, particularly in Japan. It is now under international control under Schedule I of the UN Single Convention On Narcotic Drugs 1961, presumably due to high abuse potential, although little more information is available. It is listed under Schedule I of the US Controlled Substances Act as a Narcotic and has an ACSCN of 9616 with zero annual manufacturing quota as of 2013.|$|E
40|$|In the rat, {{the ratio}} of the {{analgesic}} to the respiratory depressant potency was the same for morphine, codeine, diamorphine, methadone, dipipanone, piperidylisomethadone, phenadoxone, dextromoramide, and propoxyphene. The relative respiratory depressant activity of pethidine tended to be less, but the difference was not significant. The ratio of the analgesic dose to the dose preventing transport of a charcoal meal in the rat was about the same for morphine, codeine, pethidine, methadone, phenadoxone, <b>dimethylthiambutene,</b> and propoxyphene; the relative activities of these compounds in inhibiting the peristaltic reflex of the isolated guinea-pig ileum were also similar. However, because of differences in the slopes of regression lines in the charcoal meal test, some compounds (for example, morphine) had a greater effect on gastrointestinal propulsion than others (for example, pethidine) when given at moderate analgesic dose levels...|$|E
