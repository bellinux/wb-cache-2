5|$|She later {{contacted}} Mulder, who {{was back}} to full health at the time, seeking help on a case she suspected had some link {{to the murder of}} Doggett's son. However, as before, she soon returned to <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>work.</b> Reyes remained with the New Orleans field office until she was called upon to protect agent Dana Scully in May 2001, driving her out to a remote location in Georgia so that the pregnant Scully might deliver her child out of harm's way. Reyes helped deliver the child, and made a permanent move soon afterwards, becoming Doggett's partner on The X-Files.|$|E
5|$|Her book Intercourse, which {{addresses}} {{the role of}} sexual intercourse in society, has been interpreted as opposing all heterosexual intercourse, but Dworkin said it does not and that what she was against was male domination by intercourse. Some critics of Dworkin accused her of supporting incest, and she sued for defamation, but a court did not forbid the criticism. She subsequently wrote much in opposition to incest. She wrote some fiction, some of which was held for a time by Canadian customs authorities before it was released, giving rise to a controversy over whether her support for antipornography law had led to the seizure of <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>work.</b> When {{she said she was}} drugged and raped in a hotel in 1999, controversy over the truth of the allegations followed. In her later years, she suffered from severe osteoarthritis, which limited her mobility. She died of acute myocarditis at the age of 58.|$|E
5|$|Riefenstahl {{produced}} and directed <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>work</b> called Das Blaue Licht ("The Blue Light") in 1932, co-written by Carl Mayer and Béla Balázs. This film won the Silver Medal at the Venice Film Festival, {{but was not}} universally well-received, for which Riefenstahl blamed the critics, {{many of whom were}} Jewish. Upon its 1938 re-release, the names of Balázs and Sokal, both Jewish, were removed from the credits; some reports claim this was at Riefenstahl's behest. In the film, Riefenstahl played an innocent peasant girl who is hated by the villagers because they think she is diabolic and cast out. She is protected by a glowing mountain grotto. According to herself, Riefenstahl received invitations to travel to Hollywood to create films, but she refused them in favour of remaining in Germany with a boyfriend. The film attracted the attention of Hitler, who believed she epitomized the perfect German female. He saw talent in Riefenstahl and arranged a meeting.|$|E

25|$|The critic Camille Paglia {{has written}} of Harrison's {{influence}} on <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>work.</b> Paglia argues that Harrison's {{career has been}} ignored by second wave feminists whom Paglia thinks object to Harrison's findings and efface the careers of prominent pre-WWII female scholars to bolster their claims of male domination in academe.|$|E

25|$|This growing {{wellspring of}} women historians was {{especially}} {{evident in the}} Victoria History of the Counties of England, {{where much of the}} text was written by female medievalists like Levett, poring over contemporaneous medieval records of peasantry at the time.

She had been trained in Berlin and Glasgow, but had {{spent some time in}} New York City, where she {{encountered}} American Abstract Expressionism. <b>Her</b> <b>own</b> <b>work</b> was also tending towards abstraction. The compatibility of their artistic interests and their support for each other influenced the later development of their art for both of them.|$|E

25|$|In 1999, {{as part of}} the {{international}} conference on family constellations and the work of family therapist Bert Hellinger in Wiesloch, Germany, she was invited by Hellinger to give an extended workshop to demonstrate her work, to his students and conference delegates. Influenced by her time in Japan in the early 1980s where there is a strong tradition of honouring the ancestors, Purce developed a process for doing this in <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>work,</b> using ceremony and chant to acknowledge excluded family members, both living and dead.|$|E
25|$|Wilder did {{not keep}} copies of her {{correspondence}} with Lane, but Lane kept carbon copies of virtually everything she ever wrote, including the correspondence with her mother concerning the Little House books. The correspondence shows that Wilder sometimes adamantly refused to accept some of Lane's suggestions, {{and at other times}} gratefully accepted them. Lane's diaries show reactions to time spent on the project ranging from anger and frustration over financial loss from lack of <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>work</b> to elation at the success of the books and the prestige and income they brought to Wilder.|$|E
25|$|Throughout {{her career}} Franck, who was {{sometimes}} {{described as a}} feminist, was uncomfortable being {{in the shadow of}} her famous husband and wanted to be recognized for <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>work.</b> In 1970, the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London planned to stage Franck's first solo exhibition: when she saw that the invitations included her husband's name and said he would be present at the launch, she cancelled the show. Franck once said that she put her husband's career ahead of her own. In 2003 Franck and her daughter launched the Henri Cartier-Bresson Foundation to promote Cartier-Bresson's photojournalism, and in 2004 Franck became its president.|$|E

With him, she put herself {{in the forefront of}} an informal movement toward experimentation in American art. Since, because of her independent means, she was not constrained to make her living by selling art, she was free to use exhibitions and her many contacts with artists and collectors to advance appreciation and understanding of works which did not conform to the still-conservative norm of the 1920s and 1930s.|$|E
25|$|Gravure {{photographer}} Tamao Yamato {{is assigned}} to photograph Tomura, tracking her down to her hometown and finding her sleeping with a pacifier in her mouth amongst department store items. Hachisuka warns Yamato of Tomura's past, but Yamato gets Tomura to agree to be photographed {{under the condition that}} it be done in Greece. Tomura burns her house down and learns about Mizuno's crime. Tomura is photographed nude on an outcrop, and when Hachisuka finds them, poisons his drink. Using Tomura's diary which was found by Hachisuka, Yamato discovers her past, but she exchanges it for photographs of Yamato handing Hachisuka the poisoned drink, as well as the photographs taken of her. Tomura moves to Greece, staying as a photographer and exhibiting the nudes as <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>work.</b>|$|E
25|$|Critics, who hailed {{it as one}} of the year's finest musicals, {{immediately}} {{noted the}} film's Broadway musical potential when it was first released in 1991, encouraging Disney CEO Michael Eisner to venture into Broadway. All eight songs from the animated film were reused in the musical, including a resurrected musical number which had been cut from the motion picture. Original songwriter Menken composed six new songs for the production alongside lyricist Rice, replacing Ashman who had died during production of the film. Woolverton, who had written the film's screenplay, adapted <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>work</b> into the musical's libretto, and specifically expanded upon the characterization of the Beast. Woolverton also expanded the storylines of the castle staff from servants who had already been transformed into household objects into humans who were gradually turning into inanimate objects. Costumes were designed by Ann Hould-Ward, who based her creations on both the animators' original designs as well as the Rococo art movement after researching how clothing and household objects looked during the 18th century.|$|E
