25|$|Clemens, your lecture was {{magnificent}}. It was eloquent, moving, sincere. Never in {{my entire}} life have <b>I</b> <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> such a magnificent piece of descriptive narration. But you committed one unpardonable sin– the unpardonable sin. It is a sin you must never commit again. You closed a most eloquent description, by which you had keyed your audience up to a pitch of the intensest interest, with a piece of atrocious anti-climax which nullified all the really fine effect you had produced.|$|E
25|$|Well, it's {{not really}} a choice at all. It's just, you know, I started playing very young and from early on, the people I was {{listening}} to had some element of finger style. Probably the first guitarist I was emulating was Scotty Moore, when I was maybe 6 or 7. And he played with a pick, but he also used fingers. And {{a lot of the}} session players, like Chet Atkins, they played with fingers or a pick. Then <b>I</b> <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> a certain amount of light classical guitar playing. And of course later on, when the first wave of rock 'n' roll kind of fell away, folk music was very popular and very influential in my style. So it was really less of a choice than what I fell into. I use a pick occasionally. I certainly use it more in the studio when {{you want to get a}} certain tone. But it's just the way I came up. I wasn't taught. I just sort of figured things out on my own terms. I guess that was one of the ways that I became comfortable and it just kind of set in.|$|E

500|$|The band {{immediately}} started {{to search for}} a replacement vocalist and found Howard Jones of Blood Has Been Shed. Jones disliked the band's sound when he first heard it. He commented, [...] "I was like, 'Meh.' I come from hardcore and dirtier metal, and Killswitch sounded so clean. But the more <b>I</b> <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> it, I realized there's some really good songs here". After hearing about Leach's vocal problems, Jones contacted the band and was accepted as the replacement. Philip Labonte of All That Remains tried out for lead vocals but lost to Jones, who had to quickly memorize seven songs for his debut at the 2002 Hellfest.|$|E

In November 1861, Kanille introduced the 18-year-old Nikolai to Mily Balakirev. Balakirev in turn {{introduced him to}} César Cui and Modest Mussorgsky; all three were known as composers, despite only being in their 20s. Rimsky-Korsakov later wrote, [...] "With what delight <b>I</b> <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> real business discussions [...] of instrumentation, part writing, etc! And besides, how much talking there was about current musical matters! All at once I had been plunged into a new world, unknown to me, formerly only heard of in the society of my dilettante friends.

According to drummer Mitch Mitchell, he and bassist Noel Redding {{learned the}} song in the studio: [...] "Hendrix came in and kind of hummed us the riff and showed Noel the chords and the changes. <b>I</b> <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> it and we went, 'OK, let's do it.'

500|$|Jon Landau, {{also from}} Rolling Stone, was {{disappointed}} by the singer's effort, writing that she [...] "no longer sings songs", but rather [...] "acts them out".

[...] AllMusic's William Ruhlmann awarded the album three out of five stars but found it obvious that the record was [...] "thrown together" [...] instead of being orchestrated and thought out carefully. He also declared that the success of the title track [...] "propelled th album {{to the top of the}} charts".|$|E

[...] In 2006, he reaffirmed his previous statements and further opined, [...] "When I was growing up, if I liked , <b>I</b> <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> it — and I went to the shows.

500|$|Following the management's {{rejection}} of the track, Stewart and Nash dealt it out to other record labels. It was also given to English singer-songwriter Taio Cruz, who failed to convince his record company to release it. It was then opted by Island Def Jam chairman Antonio [...] "L.A." [...] Reid, a friend of Stewart who established his first studio. By early February 2007, the demo was sent to Reid's right-hand woman, A executive Karen Kwak, who passed it along to Reid with a message confirming that they had found a song suited for Rihanna, who was working on her third studio album, Good Girl Gone Bad, at the time. Reid immediately sent the demo to Rihanna, who was also positive of it: [...] "When the demo first started playing, I was like, This is interesting, this is weird....

500|$|During {{the early}} stages of her career, Perry's musical style gravitated towards gospel and she aspired to be as {{successful}} as Amy Grant.

She cites the band's frontman, Freddie Mercury, as her biggest influence and expressed how the [...] "combination of his sarcastic approach to writing lyrics and his 'I don't give a fuck' attitude" [...] inspired her music. She paid homage to the band by naming her third fragrance Killer Queen. Perry described The Beach Boys and their album Pet Sounds as having a considerable influence on her music: [...] "Pet Sounds {{is one of my favorite}} records and it influenced pretty much all of my songwriting.

[...] Detroit rapper Elzhi states, [...] "round the time Nas did Illmatic, it made me wanna step my game up... He's one of the reasons I did go off into storytelling because his pictures were so vivid. When he displayed his rhyme schemes and his word play and his songs, it made me wanna create visual pictures as well." [...] Casey Veggies also recounts the impact Nas' lyricism had on his own work as an underground rapper in the 2000s: “I [...] Illmatic when I was 14, 15. I didn’t get onto to it till late, but when I did, that's probably the only thing <b>I</b> <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> for six months to a year... After I got heavy on Illmatic, I put out Sleeping In Class (2010). That's when I really tried to sharpen my skills and get better.” ...|$|E
500|$|The Cure {{were one}} of the first {{alternative}} bands to have chart and commercial success in an era before alternative rock had broken into the mainstream.

Interpol lead singer Paul Banks was quoted as saying, [...] "the Cure is the band that all of us in Interpol can say influenced us. When I was younger <b>I</b> <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> them a lot.
