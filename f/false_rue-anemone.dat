50|$|The <b>false</b> <b>rue-anemone</b> {{is often}} {{confused}} with the similar species, the rue-anemone (Thalictrum thalictroides). The <b>false</b> <b>rue-anemone</b> holds its flowers in leaf axils, most often singly. The flowers of a rue-anemone appear in a cluster above a whorl of leaf-like bracts, most often in groups of 3-6. The rue-anemone has a greater variation in flower size, and while false rue-anemones always have five sepals, rue-anemones most often have more than five. Sometimes rue-anemone sepals are pale to dark pink, whereas <b>false</b> <b>rue-anemone</b> sepals are always white. False rue-anemones have a small cluster {{of no more than}} six green carpels {{in the center of the}} flower, while rue-anemones sometimes have as many as fifteen.|$|E

50|$|Enemion (<b>false</b> <b>rue-anemone)</b> are spring ephemerals {{with white}} flowers, {{branching}} stems, and finely divided {{leaves in the}} buttercup family. One species, Enemion biternatum, is native to eastern and central North America, while Enemion occidentale, stipitatum, hallii, and savilei are native to the West Coast of the United States and Canada. The genus Isopyrum is similar, and has species native to Europe and Asia.|$|E
