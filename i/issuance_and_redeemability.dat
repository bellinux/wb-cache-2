The problems were then studies using descriptive method. Techniques of collecting data used were interview and library study. The result of research conducted on Tirta Kencana Village showed that the ADD <b>issuance</b> <b>and</b> realization was carried out using two interrelated procedures: <b>issuance</b> <b>and</b> realization. The problems inhibiting the <b>issuance</b> <b>and</b> the realization of ADD was that Village Secretary was not still understand the create ADD issuance documents especially APBDes (Village Income and Expense Budget) documents such as Village Anniversary and RI’s Anniversary celebration, whether or not it may be funded by ADD, and in rural infrastructure development as bridge, whether or not the consultant should exist. Thus, the documents having arrived at BPMPD were often returned to the village for improvement because there were some misallocations of cost budget post existing in APBDes (Village Income and Expense Budget). To prevent the delayed issuance of ADD from occurring, village apparatuses should be understand regulation related ADD <b>issuance</b> <b>and</b> realization. Eventually to prevent the same mistakes the create ADD issuance documents especially APBDes (Village Income and Expense Budget) documents thus ADD can be cleared.

40|$|Abstract: There is {{an ongoing}} debate on whether {{risk-taking}} incentives align risk-averse managers’ interests with those of shareholders or whether such incentives lead to excessively risky firm and leverage policies. In this study, we shed light on this debate by using CEO risk-taking incentives, measured by the sensitivity of CEO wealth to changes in stock return volatility (Vega), and explain how Vega affects firms’ security <b>issuance</b> <b>and</b> repurchase activities. In general, we find that a higher Vega increases (decreases) the likelihood of debt <b>issuance</b> (share <b>issuance)</b> <b>and</b> it decreases (increases) the propensity of debt retirement (share repurchase). However, in high-levered firms, {{the positive effect of}} Vega on debt <b>issuance</b> <b>and</b> the negative influence of Vega on debt retirement are diminished. One the other hand, for equity <b>issuance</b> <b>and</b> repurchases, high leverage does not seem to alter the impact of Vega. These findings have three main implications: 1) in general, CEO risk-taking incentives (Vega) do affect the financing decisions of firms by increasing firms’ degree of leverage, (2) when existing leverage is high, CEO risk-taking incentives do not seem to induce CEOs to take excessive financial risks through debt issuance, but such incentives encourage them to continue repurchasing shares that would lead to even higher debt ratios and non-operational risks, and (3) firms with high Vega do not seem to adopt target debt ratios.
