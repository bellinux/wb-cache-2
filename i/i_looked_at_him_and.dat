5|$|Joe Shea got up {{and started}} calmly with {{a report on the}} state of the investigation. But within a minute, he was rambling, and in another thirty seconds, he was incoherent. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> saw my father, in the grip of {{dementia}} praecox. It was horrifying and fascinating at the same time.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> then of {{a sudden}} his name flashed back into my mind. I took his hand.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> at his tormentor squatted by {{him like}} a mocking fiend, and as I looked the candle went out.|$|E
50|$|Examples: Kinitak a kastoy. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> like this.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> in blank amazement. The thing seemed impossible.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> with a contemptuous {{amusement}} that daunted him.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> he ceased. Somehow I {{could not}} bear, as yet, {{to hear her}} beloved name spoken by other lips.|$|E
6000|$|... "My brain demands complexity." [...] The lisping cherub cried. [...] <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> only said, [...] "Go on. The {{world is}} wide." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> {{from him}} to Giuliana, and my eyes most clearly invited her {{to tell me how}} she would have me act.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> blankly. <b>I</b> had {{forgotten}} all about Lord Porthoning.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> in surprise. He {{repeated}} the movement--a grotesque one.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> curiously. A {{man does}} not often confess himself entirely friendless.|$|R
60|$|It {{was only}} for a moment that I had this opportunity; for he waved his tight-fitting black glove the instant <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> came {{straight}} in.|$|E
6000|$|He paused. [...] "Twas with {{a strange}} medley of {{emotions}} <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> <b>And</b> Dorothy, too, was leaning forward, her lips parted and her eyes riveted upon his face.|$|E
60|$|We {{all stood}} silent. The Detective made a deep sound of in-taking breath. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> as he caught my glance {{he turned his}} eyes on Miss Trelawny whose back was toward him.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> curiously. <b>I</b> {{had never}} {{understood}} his insistence on that point.|$|R
60|$|It was a {{singular}} question. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> quickly. His face was sphinxlike.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> again. Good is so overpoweringly frivolous. 'What is it?' I said.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> it {{was then}} that I began to fancy him no longer in his right mind. He was peering up to me, as if for sympathy, a timid joy in his eyes. All that had passed between us was already {{forgotten}} in the prospect of this fresh disaster.|$|E
6000|$|... ... that unruly {{child of}} {{mountain}} birth, [...] The famous brook, who, {{soon as he}} was boxed [...] Within our garden, found himself at once, [...] As if by trick insidious and unkind, [...] Stripped of his voice and left to dimple down ... <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> smiled, and smiled again, ... 'Ha,' quoth I, 'pretty prisoner, are you there!' ...|$|E
6000|$|Ae {{man there}} {{in the thick of}} the throng Sat in his saddle, {{straight}} and strong. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> he at me, And he was a master-man to see. [...] . And who is this yin? and who is yon That has the bonny lendings on? That sits and looks sae braw and crouse? [...] . Mister Frank o' the Big House! ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> sideways. He {{was really}} a dear. Niceness fairly exhaled from him.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> In {{the popular}} phrase, I {{could hardly believe}} my own ears.|$|R
60|$|I {{dropped my}} glance, browbeaten for an instant. Then <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> again, and smiled.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> saw but a white-faced, white-haired man, with calm eyes. Save for his serenity, {{the touch}} almost of beauty that {{resulted}} from his set tranquillity and his magnificent build, he might have passed muster among a hundred other comfortable old gentlemen. Then I shivered. By way of answer to his second question, I handed him a revolver with either hand.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> {{recognized}} the stranger who had followed my husband {{out of the}} room. Why had he returned alone? Why was Eustace not with me, {{like the rest of}} them? I tried to raise myself, and get on my feet. The stranger gently pressed me back again on the pillow. I attempted to resist him--quite uselessly, of course. His firm hand held me as gently as ever in my place.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{went from}} there to the ranch-house. I find H. Ogden, Esquire, lying asleep on his little cot bed. I guess he had been {{overcome}} by anti-insomnia or diswakefulness or some of the diseases peculiar to the sheep business. His mouth and vest were open, and he breathed like a second-hand bicycle pump. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> gave vent to just a few musings. 'Imperial Cæsar,' says I, 'asleep in such a way, might shut his mouth and keep the wind away.' ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> {{a little}} puzzled. His words {{had seemed to}} possess some special significance.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> in surprise. He {{was waiting}} for my answer {{with an air of}} anxiety.|$|R
60|$|For {{the moment}} I forgot this man's {{kindness}} to me. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> with a shudder.|$|R
60|$|All {{within the}} house is changed. Every trace of Nap. or his reign totally done away, as if traced in sand over which the tide has passed. Moreau and Pichegru's portraits hang in the royal ante-chamber. The former has a mean look; the latter has been a strong and stern-looking man. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> thought of his death-struggles. In the guard-room were the heroes of La Vendée--Charette with his white bonnet, the two La Rochejacqueleins, Lescure, in an {{attitude}} of prayer, Stofflet, the gamekeeper, with others.|$|E
6000|$|... "The very man," [...] was the reply; [...] "and he was {{the most}} {{formidable}} rival I ever had in that sort of affair. The proper thing for me to do, according to the custom of the times, would have been to take him aside, as soon as I found that he was paying attentions to my sweetheart, and fight him; but the more <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> his peculiar proportions, the more I was convinced that he was not a man with whom I wanted to fight." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So we went away, and {{in another}} moment {{one of the biggest}} villains on the earth troubled it no more. Once in the fresh air Every {{recovered}} quickly. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> horror and sorrow pierced me through to see such a sight. His face was the face of a man of sixty, though he was not yet forty, and his poor body was cut to pieces with stripes and scars, and other marks of the torments which Wambe had for years amused himself with inflicting on him.|$|E
60|$|He sat, {{with that}} carved {{grin on his}} face, <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> the fire, as <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
60|$|A man's figure {{suddenly}} {{appeared on the}} left. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> puzzled, wondering whence he had come.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> for {{a moment}} in silence. There was nothing to be learned from his expression.|$|R
