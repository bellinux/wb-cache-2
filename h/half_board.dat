2500|$|In {{a hockey}} rink, the boards are {{the sides of}} the rink. The [...] "side boards" [...] are the boards along the two long sides of the rink. The <b>half</b> <b>boards</b> are the boards halfway between the goal line and blue line. The {{sections}} of the rink located behind each goal are called the [...] "end boards." [...] The boards that are curved (near the ends of the rink) are called the [...] "corner boards." [...] It is a popular misconception that the <b>half</b> <b>boards</b> are the entire section of boards on {{the sides of the}} rink.|$|R

50|$|At {{his or her}} turn, {{the player}} takes all seeds from a hole and relay-sows them counterclockwise. If there are holes {{with more than one}} seed, then the player must sow {{starting}} from one such hole. If the last seeds fall in a hole of the inner row and the opposite hole in the opponent's <b>half</b> <b>board</b> is not empty, its contents are captured and removed from the game. If both the opposite hole and that behind it in the opponent's <b>half</b> <b>board</b> are non empty, all seeds are captured from both of them. The game ends when one of the players is left without any seed in his rows.|$|E

5000|$|The Rabun Gap {{motto of}} [...] "Work, Study, Worship" [...] is still dominant. Today, {{a small number}} of {{students}} are the first generation in their families to attend college. Over 70% of students receive some form of financial aid. Enrollment averages 350, with <b>half</b> <b>boarding</b> and <b>half</b> day students. The school continues its historic commitment to financial aid, allocating over $3.5 million annually through the advent of Georgia's tax credit program coupled with the generosity of the school's constituencies and endowment interest.|$|R
50|$|The {{ice hockey}} rink {{measures}} 61 meters &times; 30 meters (200 ft &times; 98.5 ft) which is standard international size. New double frame <b>half</b> <b>boards</b> were installed in 2001, designed to switch to NHL rink dimensions or to be easily removed when other events than ice hockey take place. To maximize the view for spectators, a seamless protective glass barrier consisting of tempered glass panels clipped together at their top corners with clear plastic brackets is used instead of traditional Plexiglas with metal dividers.|$|R

50|$|At its peak, {{the camp}} saw 6,000 guests moving in every Saturday whilst the last 6,000 left the same day. The camp had 1,300 staff {{to look after}} the needs of the guests, {{including}} the famous Redcoats. When the camp opened, all guests were catered on either full or <b>half</b> <b>board</b> basis; however, in 1968 Butlin handed running of the company to his son Bobby Butlin, who introduced self-catering accommodation as a means to reduce labour costs.|$|E
50|$|The {{board is}} governed by eight board members elected from two {{subdivision}}s: four from the Owairaka subdivision (western <b>half</b> of the <b>board</b> area), and four from the Maungawhau subdivision (eastern <b>half).</b> The first <b>board</b> members were elected with the nationwide local elections on Saturday 9 October 2010; the local board's second election closed on 12 October 2013.|$|R
60|$|As for the house, {{which is}} embowered {{in the little}} Paradise which I have been describing, I am sorry {{to say that it}} is, in general, the merest wooden hut on stilts; the front half {{altogether}} open and unwalled; the back <b>half</b> <b>boarded</b> up to form a single room, a passing glance into which will not make the stranger wish to enter, if he has any nose, or any dislike of vermin. The group at the door, meanwhile, will do anything but invite him to enter; and he will ride on, with something like a sigh at what man might be, and what he is.|$|R
60|$|It was {{a nondescript}} building, half canvas and <b>half</b> <b>boards.</b> The {{interior}} {{seen through the}} open door was fitted up with side shelves, a counter carelessly piled with provisions, groceries, clothing, and hardware--with no attempt at display or even ordinary selection--and a table, on which stood a demijohn and three or four dirty glasses. Two roughly dressed men, whose long, matted beards and hair left only their eyes and lips visible in the tangled hirsute wilderness below their slouched hats, were leaning against the opposite sides of the doorway, smoking. Almost thrown against them in the rapid momentum of his descent, Clarence halted violently.|$|R

5000|$|Some pits {{that play}} a special {{role in the}} game have {{specific}} names. The fourth rightmost pit in the [...] "inner" [...] row of each <b>half</b> <b>board</b> is called nyumba ("house") or kuu ("main"); in most traditional boards, it is visually distinguished by a square shape. The first and last pit of the inner row are called kichwa ("head"), while the name kimbi applies to both the kichwa and the pits adjacent to them (i.e., the second and next to last pit in the row).|$|E
50|$|In 1985, The Rank Group {{owner of}} Butlins at that time, also bought Haven Holidays and certain sites {{including}} Duporth rebranded to the sister company (There is some anecdotal evidence {{that in the}} early 1980s Duporth was branded under another sister company's name, Warner Holiday Camps. The Manor was demolished in 1989 after it became uneconomical to repair. Duporth was owned by Haven Holidays until 2000, then sold several times into private ownership. The capacity of the park was around 1200, with a combination of chalets and caravans, and self-catering and <b>half</b> <b>board</b> holidays.|$|E

5000|$|Holidaymakers {{would pay}} a fee for their {{accommodation}} and decide whether to go full board (all meals would also {{be included in the}} price), <b>half</b> <b>board</b> (only the main meal would be included) or self-catering (no meals provided). At the larger camps it was not impossible for up to 10,000 people to need to be catered for. These camps would have two sittings for each meal, usually an hour apart. This could mean that a camp would serve over 200,000 meals per week, all cooked on site. In a typical year in the early 1960s, Butlins would cook: ...|$|E
50|$|The village {{consists}} {{mostly of}} large Austrian-style chalet buildings. Many of these offer {{bed and breakfast}} or self-catering accommodations, as well as hotel accommodations on a <b>half</b> <b>board</b> or full board basis. In {{the centre of the}} village there is a bakery, a few ski rental shops, a church, and a butcher shop. The Pyramide night club is renowned for its amiable DJ's who will play anything requested of them, though the clientele is almost exclusively drunken Brits. There is also a supermarket located 0.5 km outside the village square in the direction of Ischgl, opposite the Hotel Alpenrose. This can be reached easily by bus. There is also a sports centre in the village which has an indoor swimming pool, indoor tennis court, and offers opportunities to play other sports such as darts, pool (billiards), and squash.|$|E
5000|$|Upon {{arrival in}} Auvers, Van Gogh {{decided to stay}} at the Auberge Ravoux, mainly because it was cheaper than the hotel {{proposed}} by Dr. Gachet, which charged 6 francs a day for full board accommodation. At the Auberge Ravoux, Vincent paid 3 francs 50 a day, <b>half</b> <b>board,</b> and rented room 5, a tiny attic room measuring 75 sq ft and containing only a bed, a dressing table and a built-in cupboard. He stored his paintings and drawings in a shed at the back. [...] He became acquainted with Arthur Ravoux and his family and painted a portrait of Adeline Ravoux, the eldest daughter of Ravoux, on more than one occasion. Van Gogh was charmed by the village and {{in a letter to his}} brother Theo van Gogh praised its old thatched roofs and colours, calling it “profoundly beautiful”. He found the juxtaposition between the rustic country life and recent modern additions such as the railway and the bridge on the River Oise fascinating. He was in good health, covering large distances with his painting gear and painting as much as he could.|$|E

50|$|Chief {{among the}} {{criticisms of the}} health board system was that of {{political}} patronage. Typically about <b>half</b> of the <b>board</b> members were appointed by the city or county councils of the functional area; and the Minister for Health appointed three members on each board. The cumulative effect was that over <b>half</b> of the <b>board</b> members were, in effect, appointed by local and national government; the nominated board members were often the aspiring members of political parties.|$|R

25|$|In 1975, Leslie Gunawardena and he were {{preparing}} the ground for {{a major shift in}} the management of the CTB, whereby Employees' Council representatives were to form <b>half</b> the <b>board</b> of directors.
