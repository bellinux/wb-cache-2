40|$|Purpose In Australia in 2010, nurse {{practitioners}} (NPs) were granted legislated {{access to the}} Medical Benefits Scheme (MBS) and Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) as providers. These schemes are the <b>federal</b> <b>schemes</b> for third-party reimbursement for health care and medications. As a condition {{of access to the}} schemes, it was determined that collaborative arrangements needed to be in place as part of eligibility criteria for NPs. This article is the first published policy analysis of this determination. Data sources Published literature and available grey literature (including meeting minutes), and media content, was accessed and analyzed. Conclusions The policy that was the National Health Collaborative arrangements for Nurse Practitioners Determination to amend the Australian National Health Act 1953 was a success. The policy led to NP access as providers to the MBS and PBS in Australia. Implications for practice Understanding the policy process {{as it relates to the}} determination of the need for collaborative arrangements demystifies the process and origins of the policy for NPs in Australia. Understanding the determination means NPs in Australia will not artificially reduce scope of practice based on recommendations from the medical lobby. Clear research direction is provided that may inform the next policy cycle...|$|E
40|$|This Article {{considers}} {{whether the}} market participant exception {{should be interpreted}} to exempt local climate change and sustainability initiatives from the "ceilings" imposed by existing environmental laws and pending federal climate change legislation. In the decades-long absence of federal action on climate change, local governments-along with the states-positioned themselves {{at the forefront of}} climate change and sustainability planning. In fact, state and local actions account for most of the nation's greenhouse gas reduction efforts to date. Yet, front-running localities are being limited by a preemption doctrine that fails to account for both the motives behind their initiatives and the actual effect they have on <b>federal</b> <b>schemes.</b> Indeed, while environmental law has long sought a balance between federalization and devolution of regulatory authority, current preemption doctrine, as applied to federal "ceilings," almost exclusively favors federalization values. The market participant exception offers a means to correct this imbalance. This Article begins by providing a detailed discussion of the evolution of the market participant exception in the dormant Commerce Clause and preemption contexts and unpacking the rationales behind federal floors" and "ceilings. " It then analyzes the collapsing roles of governments and corporations as regulators and market actors, and recasts the work of local governments undertaking climate change initiatives as a "race to the top" of the market for "green" places to live, work, and invest. The Article then articulates a revised test for the market participant exception and illustrates through several case studies how the test can successfully empower local autonomy and enable local innovation without sacrificing the benefits of federal law...|$|E
40|$|The {{control of}} water {{resources}} in Australia is traditionally {{the responsibility of the}} states. The Commonwealth was not given an express legislative power over this resource at federation but has the capacity to affect, directly and indirectly, water resources management through several of its legislative and financial powers. Until 2007, this had occurred mainly by the adoption of policy guidelines and the provision of financial assistance in relation to environmental protection and the fostering of interstate trade in water entitlements. Due to its limited powers in this area, the Commonwealth had promoted cooperative arrangements with the states. However, the enactment of the Water Act 2007 (Cth) involves the new assertion of Commonwealth legislative powers as well as, by amendment in 2008, the exercise of powers referred to the Commonwealth by the states. The Water Act establishes a new national framework for gathering and disseminating water resources information. More significantly, the Water Act establishes for the Murray-Darling Basin (2 ̆ 7 MDB 2 ̆ 7) a new framework for defining environmental limits on water resources exploitation and new rules for enhancing the interstate water market. Nevertheless, state law remains the foundation for the water resources entitlement regimes, {{and the reason for that}} is constitutional. This chapter begins with an outline of the states 2 ̆ 7 constitutional authority under both the powers that accrue to state governments by virtue of their ownership of natural resources and their general legislative powers, which are subject to certain limits under the Commonwealth Constitution and their own constitutions. Secondly, the chapter outlines the legislative powers of the Commonwealth, including its power to override state law. Thirdly, it briefly notes the powers of the territories. Fourthly, it explains the constitutional basis for the use of cooperative <b>federal</b> <b>schemes</b> for water resource management, including the referral of state powers to the Commonwealth that underlies the expansion of its regulation {{of water resources}} through the Water Act 2007 (Cth) ...|$|E

40|$|India's health sector {{continues}} to be challenged by overall low levels of public financing, entrenched accountability issues in the public delivery system, and the persistent dominance of out-of-pocket spending. In this context, this case study describes three recent initiatives introduced by the central and state governments in India, aimed at addressing some of these challenges and improving the availability of and access to health services, particularly {{for the poor and}} vulnerable groups in the country. This includes two <b>federal</b> <b>schemes</b> introduced by the Government of India-the National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and the Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana (RSBY) of the Ministry of Labor and Employment-and the Rajiv Aarogyasri scheme launched by the state government of Andhra Pradesh. The three schemes discussed in this case study were designed and implemented by different agencies almost in parallel, over the same time period, and used different financing and delivery approaches. A discussion of the mechanics and operational features of these programs has been undertaken to unravel the underlying complexities, interactions, and interdependencies of these programs within the country's health system. The remainder of this case study on India's march toward universal health coverage focuses on three recent, prominent programs, and includes a discussion on the institutional structure of these programs and their interactions within the country's health system, their mechanisms for beneficiary targeting and enrolment, the benefits packages covered by them, accompanying innovations in public financial management, and their information environment. Annex one presents an overview of the health system and health financing in India, and annex two discusses the evolutionary context of India's Government sponsored health insurance schemes. The discussion of the mechanics and operational features of these programs has been undertaken to unravel the underlying complexities, interactions, and interdependencies within these programs. The case study also aims to contribute to the ongoing debate within the Indian health sector, with opinions divided between investments in traditional input-based health spending for publicly managed health facilities versus demand-side financing, purchasing of care, and involving private providers and intermediaries in delivering services financed by public money. The case study also aims to share how the lessons learned by one program can be applicable more widely within the Indian health system and beyond...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{takes as}} its point of {{departure}} the debate on federalism that emerged in Italy in the years preceding the unification of 1861 and that resumed in the early 1990 s, a debate mainly revolving around the profound socio-economic differences between the North and the South of the country. Torn between continuous centripetal and centrifugal forces, but not characterized by ethnic connotations, the Italian regional model implemented with the 1948 constitution and strengthened in 2001 elicits questions that intersect with topical debates engaging scholars across the globe, and displays features that {{have the potential to}} stimulate fruitful discussions both inside and outside Italian borders. While the present state of Italian regionalism remains ambiguous, the Italian regional model distils lessons coming from different theoretical experiences, including federalism, sub-state nationalism, and the European unification process. Therefore, it can be seen as an innovative experiment crafted by those who were looking for a compromise between unitary and <b>federal</b> <b>schemes.</b> Adopting a theoretical framework combining literature on federalism, regionalism and sub-state national theory, this thesis addresses a number of questions that help fill a gap in scholarship. The thesis discusses the relationship between federalism and regionalism, arguing that regionalism is an overarching term that incorporates diverse experiences; consequently, the regional state paradigm to which Italy is usually associated {{is just one of the}} many shapes that regionalism can take. The research also identifies the elements enabling us to differentiate between a federal and a regional model, as well as the advantages of opting for a regional scheme (as opposed to a federal one). The socio-economic tensions between the North and the South of Italy offer the ideal basis to discuss non-national differences, an expression used to indicate political and socio-economic communities located within a geographical territory displaying some de facto asymmetries compared to the state-wide community, seeking some form of acknowledgement of their specificity. The thesis argues that national differences (e. g. differences based on linguistic, religious or other cultural issues) are not the only ones requiring attention, and it identifies a number of legal and constitutional stratagems that could be used to address non-national difference. Also, the recognition of non-national difference may also help find a solution to issues regarding sub-state national recognition. Finally, the thesis tries to find a point of reconciliation between federalism and solidarity, particularly in the context of non-national difference. The Italian regional experience serves once again as the {{point of departure}} to discuss whether federalism and solidarity are conflicting ideas, and to open a discussion regarding the exact contours of solidarity, especially in its horizontal understanding...|$|E
