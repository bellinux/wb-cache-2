5|$|From early childhood, Johnson {{suffered}} from poor eyesight, especially {{in his left}} eye, which interfered with his education. There were somewhat contradictory reports about his eyesight from his contemporaries. He {{appeared to have been}} near-sighted, yet he did not use <b>eyeglasses.</b> His eyesight became worse with age; still, his handwriting remained quite legible.|$|E

His notes are now in the possession of the State Historical Society of North Dakota. His satchel, pencil, and <b>eyeglasses</b> are on display in the Newseum in Washington, DC.|$|E
5|$|The 10th Earl of Shaftesbury {{became a}} {{familiar}} figure {{in some of the}} nightspots on the French Riviera. He was known for his black leather trousers, pink shirts, and large red and black <b>eyeglasses.</b> He had a habit of flashing his money around as he bought drinks {{for a wide variety of}} female companions. At one such establishment on the Riviera, he met Jamila Ben M'Barek (born c. 1961), a divorcée and the mother of two children from a previous relationship. She was one of seven children born in Paris to a Tunisian mother and Moroccan father. In 1993, M'Barek had posed naked in Playboy, but it did not cause alarm. They were married on 5 November 2002, at Hilversum in the Netherlands.|$|E

5|$|The climax {{takes place}} at the beauty pageant. After a frantic race against the clock the family arrives at the hotel, and are curtly told by a pageant {{organizer}} that they are a couple minutes past the deadline. A sympathetic hired hand instead offers to register Olive on his own time. As Olive prepares for the pageant, the family sees Olive's competition: slim, hypersexualized pre-teen girls with teased hair and capped teeth. They wear lip gloss, adult-like swimsuits, and glamorous evening wear while performing highly elaborate dance numbers with great panache. It quickly becomes apparent that Olive (plain, chubby, wearing large <b>eyeglasses,</b> and untrained in beauty pageant conventions) is a mere amateur by comparison.|$|E
5|$|Samantha {{revealed}} that she too {{would be seen}} in a dual role— a mature mother named Krishna Veni in the past and a bubbly girl named Priya in the present. She added that she would not be overshadowed in the film despite the presence of three male leads. Similar to Ye Maaya Chesave, Chaitanya and Samantha had a kissing scene in this film {{as a part of the}} script. A clip of one of Samantha's looks in the film was leaked in late July 2013. She was seen sporting an urban look and opted for a complete makeover. Nagarjuna's look in the film was leaked in mid August 2013 and he was seen sporting corrective <b>eyeglasses</b> and a conventional clean shave and moustache for which he removed the goatee he grew for his previous works Greeku Veerudu (2013) and Bhai (2013). Saran's look in the film's flashback sequences was leaked in late February 2014.|$|E
5|$|Zoroastrians were {{subjected}} to public discrimination through dress regulations – not allowed to wear new or white clothes, and compelled by enactments to wear the dull yellow raiment already alluded to as a distinguishing badge. They {{were not allowed to}} wear overcoats but were compelled to wear long robes called qaba and cotton geeveh on their feet even in winter. Wearing <b>eyeglasses,</b> long cloak, trousers, hat, boots, socks, winding their turbans tightly and neatly, carrying watch or a ring, were all forbidden to Zoroastrians. During the rainy days they were not allowed carry umbrellas or to appear in public, because the water that had run down through their bodies and cloths could pollute the Muslims. Zoroastrian men in Yazd would carry a large shawl that they would place under their feet when visiting a Muslim's home so as to prevent the carpet from being polluted. Forbidden from riding horses and only allowed to ride mules or donkeys, upon facing a Muslim they had to dismount. Not until 1923, was the general proscription against Zoroastrians' riding horses and donkeys lifted by Reza Shah.|$|E
40|$|AbstractBest-corrected acuity was {{measured}} for {{vertical and horizontal}} gratings and for Lea Symbols® recognition acuity in 3 - to 5 -year-old children with high astigmatism and in non-astigmatic children. There was significant amblyopia among astigmatic children at baseline. There {{was no evidence that}} <b>eyeglass</b> correction of astigmatism resulted in a reduction in amblyopia over a 4 -month average treatment duration (although vision in astigmatic children was significantly improved immediately upon <b>eyeglass</b> correction, indicating that <b>eyeglass</b> correction did provide a visual benefit). Treatment outcome results are discussed in terms of both methodological issues and theoretical implications...|$|R

25|$|There is {{tentative}} {{evidence that}} near-sightedness {{can be prevented}} by having young children spend more time outside. This {{may be related to}} natural light exposure. Near-sightedness can be corrected with <b>eyeglasses,</b> contact lenses, or surgery. <b>Eyeglasses</b> are the easiest and safest method of correction. Contact lenses can provide a wider field of vision; however are associated with a risk of infection. Refractive surgery permanently changes the shape of the cornea.|$|E

25|$|The {{earliest}} pictorial {{evidence for}} the use of <b>eyeglasses</b> is Tommaso da Modena's 1352 portrait of the cardinal Hugh de Provence reading in a scriptorium. Another early example would be a depiction of <b>eyeglasses</b> found north of the Alps in an altarpiece of the church of Bad Wildungen, Germany, in 1403. These early glasses had convex lenses that could correct both hyperopia (farsightedness), and the presbyopia that commonly develops as a symptom of aging. It was not until 1604 that Johannes Kepler published the first correct explanation as to why convex and concave lenses could correct presbyopia and myopia.|$|E

25|$|Bifocal, trifocal, and {{progressive}} lenses generally require a taller lens shape to {{leave room for}} the different segments while preserving an adequate field of view through each segment. Frames with rounded edges are the most efficient for correcting myopic prescriptions, with perfectly round frames being the most efficient. Before the advent of <b>eyeglasses</b> as a fashion item, when frames were constructed with only functionality in mind, virtually all <b>eyeglasses</b> were either round, oval, or curved octagons. It was not until glasses began {{to be seen as}} an accessory that different shapes were introduced to be more aesthetically pleasing than functional.|$|E
