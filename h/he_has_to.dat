5|$|After four years, {{the story}} {{presents}} tax attorney Loudon Trott (Griffin Dunne) {{on a busy}} day. He is getting married to the daughter {{of one of the}} richest men in New York, Simon Worthington. Loudon's bride Wendy Worthington (Haviland Morris) is a selfish woman who is more consumed in her wedding plans than in the well-being of her fianc√©. Loudon, on the other hand, has a number of duties entrusted to him by his boss (and future father-in-law), Mr. Worthington (John McMartin). First <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> pick up a cougar for an exotic animal activist named Montgomery Bell (John Mills), then to pick up Nikki, and lastly <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> make sure that Nikki catches the next bus to her hometown of Philadelphia.|$|E
5|$|During this episode, {{the dogs}} had to {{interact}} with the main characters, which proved difficult. Actor Sean Bean reported that for the final scene where <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> sacrifice Lady, the animal was too scared to remain still. They had to keep rehearsing the scene until the dog felt comfortable, making a shot that should have taken a few minutes about three hours long.|$|E
5|$|Everything goes {{as planned}} until Caesar finds the money gone. He realizes {{that if he}} runs, Gino will think he took the money. He decides <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> get the money back from Johnnie. Panicking, Violet threatens to leave. Caesar pulls out his gun and forces her to stay, {{thinking}} that maybe she and Johnnie have stolen the money and framed him.|$|E
60|$|But {{there were}} three tests which every man, private or officer, <b>had</b> <b>to</b> pass. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be in perfect health, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> know how <b>to</b> ride, and <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> know how to shoot. To these {{conditions}} were afterward added two more: each man <b>had</b> <b>to</b> learn his duty as quickly as <b>he</b> could and <b>had</b> <b>to</b> learn to obey his superiors.|$|R
50|$|A {{couple of}} months later <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> undergo surgery on his left shoulder, {{following}} a fall while running on a treadmill, after which <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> take a year off swimming.|$|R
50|$|<b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> {{move from}} one place to another during his service. So <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> stay at Washim, Murtijapur, Akola etc. But he stayed at Akola, {{comparatively}} for a long time. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> take full responsibility of his brothers and sisters from his childhood. Their education, weddings everything <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> do. His youngest brother Gajanan walked on the path of spirituality and became a great Nathpanthi Sadguru as Gajanan Maharaj. His Samadhi is at Nasik at the shore of Ganges. Thousands of disciples gather there and celebrate many spiritual functions. Gajanan Maharaj left His body on 28/09/1946.|$|R
5|$|In the episode, Grace's (Debra Messing) job forces {{her to work}} overtime, {{which leads}} to Will (Eric McCormack) feeling neglected. As a result, he seeks solace {{in the company of}} a new neighbor, Val (Shannon). Meanwhile, Jack (Sean Hayes) is annoyed that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> perform {{community}} service for assaulting a meter maid.|$|E
5|$|Sheldon goes {{to visit}} Mr. D'Onofrio in hospital. When the nurse sees him with scissors, expecting {{to get a}} haircut, she calls {{security}} and <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> leave. He accepts {{that he is not}} going to get a haircut, but also abandons all of his meticulous planning (for example, his bowel chart spreadsheet), realizing it has been a waste of time.|$|E
5|$|The income {{generating}} {{activity in}} this case is gathering coconuts. As usual, the more time he spends in leisure, the less food <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> eat, and conversely, the more time he spends gathering coconuts, the less time he has for leisure. This is depicted in figure 1.|$|E
50|$|Japanese {{culture and}} the new {{lifestyle}} with Ondekoza {{was something of a}} shock to 19-year-old Underwood. Far from his native land and learning as much Japanese as he could in order <b>to</b> get by, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> adapt to living in a foreign country and to Ondekoza's unique communal lifestyle. In his own words, all Underwood wanted to do was play the taiko, but <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> learn discipline, and <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> grow up.|$|R
60|$|He was tired, {{exhausted}} and hungry. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> walked a long way. And <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> something <b>to</b> eat--soon.|$|R
50|$|In 2006, when he {{returned}} to Japan from Germany, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> work in the stables to make a living. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> wake up at 5am every morning to clean up the stables.|$|R
5|$|To use {{the online}} {{authentication}} function, the holder needs a six-digit decimal PIN. If the holder {{types in the}} wrong PIN, <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> type in the twelve-digit decimal access code given on the ID card to prove he/she really possesses the ID card. If the wrong PIN is used three times, a PUK must be used to unlock the chip.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} episodes were also {{experimental}} {{in that they}} took place entirely in one setting. Such episodes include: Victor, Margaret and Mrs Warboys stuck in a traffic jam; Victor and Margaret in bed suffering insomnia; Victor left {{alone in the house}} waiting to see if <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> take part in jury service; Victor and Margaret having a long wait in their solicitor's waiting room; and Victor and Margaret trying to cope during a power cut on the hottest night of the year.|$|E
5|$|Although Adams has {{experimented with}} {{painting}} with watercolor and oil paints (his 1989 covers for Appleseed were rendered {{with a combination}} of ink, watercolor and color pencil), his color work is so sporadic that he says <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> relearn what he has forgotten in the interim each time, and is usually dissatisfied with the results. Because a significant portion of his income is derived from selling his original artwork, he is reluctant to learn how to produce his work digitally.|$|E
50|$|Nigel Williams {{played the}} {{character}} of Legion, whose costume was so tight <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be sewn into it. Once he was in it <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> stay in it until the shoot was finished.|$|R
60|$|Huck Finn's {{wealth and}} the fact that he was now under the Widow Douglas' {{protection}} introduced him into society--no, dragged him into it, hurled him into it--and his sufferings were almost more than he could bear. The widow's servants kept him clean and neat, combed and brushed, and they bedded him nightly in unsympathetic sheets that had not one little spot or stain which he could press to his heart and know for a friend. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> eat with a knife and fork; <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> use napkin, cup, and plate; <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> learn his book, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> go <b>to</b> church; <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> talk so properly that speech was become insipid in his mouth; whithersoever he turned, the bars and shackles of civilization shut him in and bound him hand and foot.|$|R
50|$|<b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> pay {{four times}} the amount <b>he</b> <b>had</b> confessed <b>to</b> {{stealing}} from the city treasury and was banned from public office.|$|R
5|$|An infinitive form, {{that uses}} the plain form of the verb and the {{preposition}} to, is used for verbal clauses that are syntactically subordinate to a finite verbal clause. Finite verbal clauses {{are those that are}} formed around a verb in the present or preterit form. In clauses with auxiliary verbs they are the finite verbs and the main verb is treated as a subordinate clause. For example, <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> go where only the auxiliary verb have is inflected for time and the main verb to go is in the infinitive, or in a complement clause such as I saw him leave, where the main verb is to see which is in a preterite form, and leave is in the infinitive.|$|E
5|$|At Massive Dynamic, Brandon (Ryan McDonald) theorizes to {{the team}} that Observers are time travelers, {{as they have been}} {{documented}} during several major events in history. They write in an incomprehensible language, and the number of Observer sightings has increased over the past few months, leaving the team wondering why. Meanwhile, August visits the other Observers, who are not happy that he saved a girl who was supposed to die in the plane crash. To correct his mistake, they send Donald Long (Paul Rae), an assassin affiliated with the Observers to correct August's actions. In an attempt to save Christine, August sends a secret message to Walter. During the meeting, August reveals Christine will die because she is not important; Walter tells August that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> make her important.|$|E
5|$|Bart's House of Weirdness is an action-adventure-strategy {{platform}} {{game that}} uses single-screen movement. The plot sees Bart grounded {{to his room}} by his parents Homer and Marge after having pulled one too many pranks. With nothing to do, he quickly gets bored and escapes from the home. He travels around town, and eventually heads to an amusement park where <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> save Krusty the Clown from his archenemy Sideshow Bob.|$|E
60|$|It was {{impossible}} {{that he should}} answer her at once. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> realize so much that had hitherto not been expressed between them, before he could fully understand what she meant; {{and then he was}} called on to give up so much that he now learnt for the first time was within his reach! Before he could answer her <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> assure himself that Katie loved him; <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> understand that her love for one so abandoned was regarded as fatal; and <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> reply to a mother's prayer that he would remove himself from the reach of a passion which to him was worth all the world beside.|$|R
60|$|He {{considered}} {{the problem with}} cool audacity, backed by a belief in his own power. It was not these two men <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> save; <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> save himself! And looked upon {{in this way the}} situation appeared familiar.|$|R
50|$|In 2005, {{he weighed}} 960 pounds. Five years later, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> dropped down <b>to</b> 450. At one stage <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> weigh {{himself on the}} scales in a post office which <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> access from the back {{entrance}} so he wouldn't be seen. He achieved his weight loss with diet and exercise, and with help from his manager Lucille Star.|$|R
5|$|Carly, an attorney, {{has just}} started a {{relationship}} with Mark, a man she had sex with eight weeks earlier. She is upset when Mark tells her <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> go out of town but decides {{to go over to}} his house to seduce him. She is horrified to meet Mark's wife, Kate, whom she'd originally assumed to be Mark's housekeeper. While initially hostile, the two women befriend one another. Kate then discovers that he is seeing yet another woman, whom she at first believes to be Carly, but they both discover that Mark is seeing a third woman: Amber.|$|E
5|$|During the {{daylight}} hours, Jericho's powers are gone, so <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> fight {{as a normal}} human, using {{a wide variety of}} weaponry, from a Darkwatch's standard-issue 24-shot Redeemer handgun to a crossbow firing explosive arrows and a rocket launcher, as well as melee combat. In some missions, Jericho can drive a Gatling gun-equipped Coyote Steamwagon vehicle; using it or a horse changes perspective to the third-person view. During horse-riding rail shooter sequences, Jericho is granted unlimited ammunition and high attack speed, at the cost of only being able to use the Redeemer.|$|E
5|$|Edmund's cult re-emerged in the 10th {{century and}} the site of his burial grew wealthy {{as a result of}} {{receiving}} grants of land from royally connected benefactors. In about 986, the monks of Ramsey Abbey commissioned Abbo of Fleury to write an account of the saint's life and early cult. In his preface or dedicatory epistle Abbo addresses the work to St Dunstan, Archbishop of Canterbury 960-988. Dunstan himself {{is the source of the}} story of the martyrdom, which he had heard told long before, in the presence of King √Üthelstan, by an old man who swore an oath that he had been Edmund's own sword-bearer (armiger) on the fatal day. Abbo therefore clearly makes Dunstan, then still living and the recipient of his work, the authority for what <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> say.|$|E
50|$|<b>He</b> <b>had</b> some heart {{complications}} and <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> go to Europe to be treated, however complications with his kidneys caused continuous problems and <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> fight for life for many years. Moharam Fouad died on 27 June 2002 leaving the scene empty {{for the people}} who loved him.|$|R
60|$|He {{could get}} away, of course. Anytime {{he wanted to}} he could get away. All <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> do was to leap into the crystal cage and turn the handles. But <b>he</b> <b>had</b> a job, an {{important}} job. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be here, here at this place, at this time.|$|R
5|$|Marseille {{developed}} his own special tactics, which differed {{significantly from the}} methods of most other pilots. (When attacking a Lufbery circle) <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> fly very slowly. He even {{took it to the}} point where <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> operate his landing flaps as not to fall down, because, of course <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> fly his curve (turns) more tightly than the upper defensive circle. He and his fighter were one unit, and he was in command of that aircraft like no-one else.|$|R
5|$|In New York, Michael {{manages to}} talk to Wallace, who has {{seemingly}} been avoiding him, and complains that it is unfair that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> drive to New York in order {{to talk to}} him instead of on the phone, and that he deserves more respect after being at Dunder Mifflin for fifteen years. David agrees to fund an anniversary party for him and attend, but Michael abruptly announces his resignation from the company and walks out.|$|E
5|$|Kakashi is {{also present}} in {{all four of the}} {{original}} video animations produced for the series, helping Naruto and Konohamaru Sarutobi to find a four leaf clover in the first original video animation, joining his team in escorting a ninja named Shibuki to his village in the second, participating in a tournament in the third, and working with Team 7 in the fourth one. A light novel titled Kakashi Hiden: Lightning in the Icy Sky, written by Akira Higashiyama and illustrated by Kishimoto, focuses on the early days of Kakashi's appointment as the Sixth Hokage, in which <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> stop a terror plan conducted by a pair of Kirigakure ninja, who plan to take control of a newly unveiled airborne ship to stage a jailbreak of a notorious criminal, in the process learning about the pair's tragic reason for doing so.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Andy (Chris Pratt) {{continues}} {{his efforts to}} break up the relationship between his ex-girlfriend Ann (Rashida Jones) and her new boyfriend Mark (Paul Schneider). Andy challenges Mark to a game of pool with the hopes of hustling him, but Mark turns out to be an excellent player and wins multiple games. Mark and Andy make one final wager: if Andy wins, he gets Ann, but if Mark wins <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> leave them alone. Mark dominates the game but loses when he scratches on the 8 ball. Initially delighted, Andy becomes confused when Ann leaves with Mark anyway. The next day, he tells Mark and Ann he will no longer be bothering them, and says a final goodbye to Ann.|$|E

60|$|She {{appeared}} at the door, waiting <b>to</b> hear what <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> say to her.|$|R
50|$|After graduation, he {{continued}} to work there, and by 1979 <b>he</b> <b>had</b> advanced from engineer to deputy head of a production unit. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> work in extreme conditions on oil platforms. On one occasion, an explosion on his rig threw him into the stormy Caspian sea, and <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> swim for his life.|$|R
