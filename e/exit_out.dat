5|$|During the infancy of the 2008–09 season, Nécib was {{selected}} to join the new United States-based women's soccer league, Women's Professional Soccer, after her American playing rights {{were assigned to the}} Washington Freedom in the 2008 WPS International Draft. Her Lyon teammate Sonia Bompastor was also assigned to the Freedom. While Bompastor was allowed to negotiate her <b>exit</b> <b>out</b> of the club, Lyon chairman Jean-Michel Aulas was able to convince Nécib to remain in France after having previously declared the player off limits. Nécib scored her first league goal of the campaign on 14 September 2008 in a 12–0 home win over Vendenheim. A month later, she scored a double in an 8–1 victory over Soyaux. Nécib repeated her two-goal display on 1 February 2009 in a 5–0 away win over Stade Briochin. In the UEFA Women's Cup, Nécib scored her first two goals of the campaign in an 8–0 home win over Austrian club Neulengbach in a second qualifying round group stage match. On 18 November, she scored the third goal in a 4–1 second leg win over Italian club Bardolino. The 9–1 aggregate scoreline advanced Lyon to the semi-finals for the second consecutive season where Lyon were again eliminated, this time by German team FCR 2001 Duisburg. In the league, Lyon captured its third straight league title, but was unable to defend its Challenge de France title losing to the eventual champions Montpellier in the semi-finals. For her performances during the campaign, Nécib was named the National Union of Professional Footballers (UNFP) Female Player of the Year.|$|E

The existing third leg was abandoned. This allowed cars a cleaner entry into oval turn three. After favorable results, in 2010 the third leg was dug up, and removed permanently.|$|E

Curtis Meyran, who died after they jumped from the fourth floor of a burning apartment building in the Bronx. Of the four firefighters who jumped and survived, only one of them had a self-rescue rope.

25|$|Edgar was {{selected}} for the 2011 CONCACAF Gold Cup Canadian 23-man roster {{as a replacement for}} Dejan Jakovic, who sustained a hamstring injury in a friendly approaching the tournament. Edgar did not join the team since he was a late addition during Canada's disappointing Gold Cup, with an early <b>exit</b> <b>out</b> of the group stage. Edgar became a regular starter for the national team in late 2011. He assisted Olivier Occean's game-winning goal against Cuba in 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification on June 8, 2012. He scored his first goal for Canada in a crucial World Cup qualification match against Cuba on October 12; the match ended in a 3–0 Canadian victory.|$|E
25|$|The swim leg usually {{proceeds}} {{around a}} series of marked buoys before athletes exit the water near the transition area. Racers <b>exit</b> <b>out</b> of the water, enter the transition area, and change from their swim gear and into their cycling gear. Competition and pressure for faster times {{have led to the}} development of specialized triathlon clothing that is adequate for both swimming and cycling, allowing many racers to have a transition that consists of only removing their wetsuit, cap, and goggles and pulling on a helmet and cycling shoes. In some cases, racers leave their cycling shoes attached to their bicycle pedals and slip their feet into them while riding. Some triathletes don't wear socks, decreasing their time spent in transition even more.|$|E
25|$|Colonies {{of the red}} {{imported}} {{fire ant}} have tunneling surfaces that protrude out of the surfaces where workers forage. These areas of protrusion tend to be within their own territory, but greater ant colonisation can affect this. Tunnels are designed to allow effective body, limb and antennae interactions with walls, and a worker can also move exceptionally fast inside them (more than nine bodylengths per second). The holes <b>exit</b> <b>out</b> of any point within the colony's territory, and foraging workers may need to travel half a metre to reach the surface. Assuming the average forager travels 5 m, over 90% of foraging time is inside the tunnels {{during the day and}} rarely at night. Workers forage in soil temperatures reaching 27°C (80°F) and surface temperatures of 12–51°C (53–123°F). Workers exposed to temperatures of 42°C (107°F) are at risk of dying from the heat. The rate of workers foraging drops rapidly by autumn, and they rarely emerge during winter. This {{may be due to the}} effects of soil temperature, and a decreased preference for food sources. These preferences only decrease when brood production is low. In the northern regions of the United States, areas are too cold for the ant to forage, but in other areas such as Florida and Texas, foraging may occur all year round. When it is raining, workers do not forage outside, as exit holes are temporarily blocked, pheromone trails are washed away, and foragers may be physically struck by the rain. The soil's moisture may also affect the foraging behaviour of workers.|$|E

2500|$|Hamilton {{had set up}} his {{headquarters}} in Paris' The George V Hotel, representing companies like Hamilton Standard, Sikorsky Aviation, Chance Vought Aircraft, and Pratt & Whitney. [...] During the time from 1936–1940, Hamilton was successful in getting licensing rights for foreign countries to build Pratt & Whitney engines and Hamilton Standard variable-pitch propellers. [...] According to Wilson, it was a fight for survival as an American company. [...] He also mentioned {{there was a kind}} of naivete when it came to dealing with countries like Germany, Japan and Russia. [...] For example, a deal was set up with BMW (Bavarian Motor Works) to license them to build a number of Pratt & Whitney engines, which was approved by the United States Congress. [...] This was granted because neither the US businessmen nor governmental officials expected any war in Europe. [...] As Wilson stated, “thanks to Mr. Thomas F. Hamilton moving around through these different ministries, could appraise this situation more clearly than most people. [...] And he came back from one trip and in a meeting of the executive committee of our company he said, ‘Don't discount this fellow Hitler.’ ‘To you, he's got a Charlie Chaplin mustache, but whatever he may look on the outside, either he or somebody behind him has a strategic insight and a political foresight that is not available anywhere else in the world that I know of’ ”. [...] It has also been suggested that Hamilton also tried to convince the United States Congress of the seriousness of doing business with countries like Germany, Japan and Russia. However, at the time business interests came first and Hamilton was asked to continue in his position until the fall of France in 1940, after which Hamilton and his staff had to make an unorthodox <b>exit</b> <b>out</b> of Europe through Spain.|$|E

If he did so, he would have to appear to forgive her in spite of what she had said to him. And Bob was coming home. Could he tell Bob that he had changed his mind and withdrawn his consent to the marriage? There world be the reason, and again Bob would believe her. And again, if he withdrew his consent, there was Jethro to reckon with. Jethro must have a weapon still, Mr. Worthington thought, although he could not imagine what it might be. As Isaac Worthington sat there, thinking, it grew clear, to him at last that there was but one <b>exit</b> <b>out</b> of a very desperate situation.|$|E

The results show that general health, measured by a variable that captures health limitations and by a constructed latent health index, affects entries into and <b>exits</b> <b>out</b> of employment; the effects being higher for men than for women. Moreover, results suggest that changes in mental health status influences only the hazard of nonemployment for the stock sample of workers. The results are robust to different definitions of employment, and to the exclusion of older workers from the analysis. health, health shocks, discrete-time hazard models, employment, BHPS...|$|R
