5|$|Following the 2013 season, Fister {{was named}} {{a finalist for the}} Gold Glove Award for the pitcher {{position}} alongside Mark Buehrle and R.A. Dickey. Fister finished the season with zero errors <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> 1.000 fielding percentage. Additionally, he led all American League pitchers in putouts (23) and double plays started (5), and was seventh in assists (29).|$|E
5|$|This {{would have}} also {{marked the first}} perfect game in the Tigers' 110-year history. The 83 pitches thrown before the blown call {{would have been the}} fewest pitches in a perfect game since 1908. Galarraga's near-perfect game was the first such game since Mike Mussina's bid <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> game on September 2, 2001, which was broken up by 27th batter Carl Everett. It was also the third time for a Tigers pitcher to come so close to a perfect game, as Milt Wilcox also missed getting the 27th {{straight}} batter out on April 15, 1983, and Tommy Bridges missed the 27th batter on August 5, 1932.|$|E
5|$|Navy's McKee threw <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> 11 of 11 passes {{during the}} first half, but {{completed}} just five of nine attempts during the second half. Two of these incompletions were interceptions. McKee outthrew Washington's Fred Abel by 110yards. Carl Cullen was McKee's main receiver for the game, catching ten passes from him, {{one of which was}} taken for a touchdown. The other six passes were caught by other receivers. On the ground, Cullen rushed for the most yards of any player, gaining 102 throughout the course of the game. McKee was Navy's key runner, gaining 85 yards. Cullen, McKee, fullback Alan Shapley, and other team members rushed for a total of 187 yards during the game. McKee completed both extra point attempts, and the squad's punter kicked five times, for an average distance of 33.8 yards.|$|E

5|$|On September 22, Young had {{a no-hitter}} through 8⅓ innings {{of the game}} against the Pittsburgh Pirates before pinch hitter Joe Randa hit a two-run home run. This {{would have been the}} first no-hitter in Padres history. It was the first time a Padre had taken a no-hitter into the ninth inning since Andy Ashby on September 5, 1997 vs. the Atlanta Braves. Young had been on pace <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> game through 5⅔ innings. Young also took a no-hitter into the eighth inning on May 30 against the Colorado Rockies as a prelude to his June performance. In that game, which marked the first time a pitcher took a no-hitter into the eighth inning during the 2006 season, he {{surrendered}} a double to Brad Hawpe, who had been a teammate in the 1997 Connie Mack World Series, on his first pitch of the eighth inning and 99th of the game. During Young's next start on June 4 at Pittsburgh, he did not allow a hit for the first 5⅓ innings, making him one of only two pitchers (Steve Trachsel – June 20–25, 2002) to have consecutive starts with at least five hitless innings since the 2000 season.|$|E
5|$|Aquinas {{supported}} Augustine's {{view that}} evil is a privation of goodness, maintaining that evil has existence as a privation intrinsically found in good. The {{existence of this}} evil, Aquinas believed, can be completely explained by free will. Faced with the assertion that humans {{would have been better}} off without free will, he argued that the possibility of sin is necessary <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> world, and so individuals are responsible for their sin. Good is the cause of evil, but only owing to fault on the part of the agent. In his theodicy, to say something is evil is to say that it lacks goodness which means that it could not be part of God's creation, because God's creation lacked nothing. Aquinas noted that, although goodness makes evil possible, it does not necessitate evil. This means that God (who is good) is not cast as the cause of evil, because evil arises out of a defect in an agent, and God is seen to be without defect. Philosopher Eleonore Stump, considering Aquinas' commentary on the Book of Job, argues that Aquinas has a positive view of suffering: it is necessary to contrast Earth with heaven and remind humans that they still have the propensity to commit evil. Aquinas believed that evil is acceptable because of the good that comes from it, and that evil can only be justified when it is required in order for good to occur. Attempting to relieve God of responsibility for the occurrence of evil, Aquinas insisted that God merely permits evil to happen, rather than willing it. He recognised the occurrence of what seems to be evil, but did not attribute to it the same level of existence that he attributed to spirituality. Like Augustine, Aquinas asserted that humans bear responsibility for evil owing to their abuse of free will.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} December 2008, Keenan had {{mentioned}} that he and Howerdel had passively and separately been writing new material <b>for</b> <b>A</b> <b>Perfect</b> Circle, although the band would officially remain in hiatus and largely out of {{the view of the}} public through mid-2010. On September 2010, the band officially announced the end of their hiatus, indicating they would again return to live performances. Keenan, Howerdel, Freese, and Iha all returned to their respective roles, though, with Lenchantin and White unavailable, the band recruited Matt McJunkins, touring bassist for Ashes Divide and Puscifer, to join as bassist. The performances, running through the end of 2010, included traveling to five separate cities for three nights of shows in each city, with each night containing a complete, in-order performance of one of each of their three albums - Mer de Noms, Thirteenth Step, and Emotive - notably being the first time most of the material from the latter had ever been performed live. Throughout the year the band would discuss the prospect of new material, but with uncertainty. Keenan continued to insist that logistics and industry trends made recording another full album unlikely, and that single one-off songs would be more likely. Howerdel noted that he had been writing material and presenting rough demos to Keenan since 2008, but that much of the material {{was in a state of}} flux, some being accepted by Keenan as potential A Perfect Circle material, while other being rejected by Keenan, and/or saved by Howerdel for a prospective Ashes Divide release in the future.|$|E

25|$|The French Army {{partially}} motorized their cavalry in 1928, creating {{divisions of}} dragons portés (mobile dragoons) that combined motorized and horse-mounted elements.

Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania followed the French mixed pattern; Austrian and Czechoslovak mobile divisions were similar {{but with a}} higher share of horses. The Polish army acquired tanks and the Lithuanian army acquired trucks but otherwise both remained horse-powered, World War I style armies. The United States Cavalry commanders approved the French strategy but made no radical changes until the 1940 reform that completely eliminated horse troops.|$|E

After the hit, he retired the next 16 consecutive batters, facing only 28 batters which is one over the minimum <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> game. He threw 115 pitches, 86 for strikes.

She pitched flawlessly and faced the minimum 27 batters, but still did not qualify <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> game, since she allowed an eighth-inning walk to Dorothy Schroeder, who later was erased on a double play. In the playoffs, Rockford eliminated South Bend in four straight games. Faut went 0–2 with a 2.58 ERA in two starts.

25|$|Real {{crystals}} feature defects or {{irregularities in}} the ideal arrangements described above {{and it is}} these defects that critically determine many of the electrical and mechanical properties of real materials. When one atom substitutes {{for one of the}} principal atomic components within the crystal structure, alteration in the electrical and thermal properties of the material may ensue. Impurities may also manifest as spin impurities in certain materials. Research on magnetic impurities demonstrates that substantial alteration of certain properties such as specific heat may be affected by small concentrations of an impurity, as for example impurities in semiconducting ferromagnetic alloys may lead to different properties as first predicted in the late 1960s. Dislocations in the crystal lattice allow shear at lower stress than that needed <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> crystal structure.|$|E
