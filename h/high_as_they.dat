5|$|The {{details of}} the {{legislation}} were largely the work of architect George Ford. Ford had sympathies with the City Beautiful movement, disliked the unimaginative form of many New York skyscrapers, and had concerns over urban public health, but he also found tall buildings exciting and believed that horizontal visual unity produced boring architecture. As a consequence of Ford's influence, New York's laws were relatively complex and divided up the city into different zones; in each zone, a particular zoning envelope applied, controlling the height to which buildings could be built. Typically a building could only rise up from the sidewalk vertically by around , after which the building had to be set back at a set angle to allow sunlight to reach the street below. On {{a quarter of the}} site, however, the owner could build as <b>high</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> wished, without any further restrictions.|$|E
25|$|As a {{response}} to the electricity supply crisis (see The crisis below)., many consumers turned to alternative self-generation units such as small diesel generators, inverters, kerosene lamps or large power generators (for large industrial consumers). It is estimated that total installed capacity in 2006 was 5,518MW, which means that self-generation accounted for about 2,214MW, equivalent to 63% of the 3,394MW total capacity of public utilities and 38% of total installed capacity. The costs associated with this self-generation capacity are very <b>high</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> include equipment purchase, maintenance and fuel supply. This affects the residential, commercial and industrial sectors. For the latter, about 60% of its electricity consumption is self-generated.|$|E
25|$|Plant {{respiration}} {{is limited}} by the process of diffusion. Plants take in carbon dioxide through holes, known as stomata, that can open and close on the undersides of their leaves and sometimes other parts of their anatomy. Most plants require some oxygen for catabolic processes (break-down reactions that release energy). But the quantity of O2 used per hour is small as they are not involved in activities that require high rates of aerobic metabolism. Their requirement for air, however, is very <b>high</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> need CO2 for photosynthesis, which constitutes only 0.04% of the environmental air. Thus, to make 1g of glucose requires the removal of all the CO2 from at least 18.7liters of air at sea level. But inefficiencies in the photosynthetic process cause considerably greater volumes of air to be used.|$|E

500|$|Gestation {{is eight}} {{to nine months}} long, after which a single calf {{weighing}} about [...] is born. Births usually peak in the dry season, and take place in thickets – unlike the wildebeest, which give birth in groups on the plains. Though calves can move about on their own shortly after birth, they usually lie in the open in close proximity of their mothers. The calf is weaned at four months, but young males stay with their mothers {{for two and a}} half years, longer than in other Alcelaphini. Often the mortality rate of male juveniles is <b>high,</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> have to face the aggression of territorial adult males and are also deprived of good forage by them. The lifespan is 12 to 15 years.|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{after this}} episode was aired, Gateworld {{announced}} that the Sci-Fi Channel had decided not renew Stargate SG-1 for the coming year. The Channel later confirmed this decision, {{at the same time}} announcing that Stargate Atlantis had been picked up for another season. Many fans denounced Gateworld's cancellation announcement, both the timing of it (apparently it had been made while the cast and crew were celebrating the episode's airing)—and the decision itself, on the ground that, while ratings were not as <b>high</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> had been in previous seasons, the series was still drawing an audience of a respectable size. (For example, it had a season average of 2million viewers in Australia, half of them in the 18–49 demographic.) Sci Fi responded that the cancellation decision had not been based on ratings so much as a feeling the series had run its course.

500|$|The railway {{that opened}} in September 1825 was [...] long and ran from Phoenix Pit, Old Etherley Colliery, to Cottage Row, Stockton; {{there was also a}} half-mile (0.8km) branch to the depot at Darlington, [...] of the Hagger Leases branch, and a [...] branch to Yarm. Most of the track used [...] {{malleable}} iron rails, and [...] of [...] cast iron rails were used for junctions. The line was single track with four passing loops each mile; square sleepers supported each rail separately so that horses could walk between them. Stone was used for the sleepers to the west of Darlington and oak to the east; Stephenson would have preferred all of them to have been stone, but the transport cost was too <b>high</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> were quarried in the Auckland area. The railway opened with the company owing money and unable to raise further loans; Pease advanced money twice early in 1826 so the workers could be paid. By August 1827 the company had paid its debts and was able to raise more money; that month the Black Boy branch opened and construction began on the Croft and Hagger Leases branches. During 1827 shares rose from £120 at the start to £160 at the end.|$|E

2500|$|In 1845 a lavishly {{equipped}} two-ship expedition led by Sir John Franklin {{sailed to}} the Canadian Arctic {{to chart the}} last unknown swaths of the Northwest Passage. Confidence was <b>high,</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> estimated there was less than [...] remaining of unexplored Arctic mainland coast. When the ships failed to return, relief expeditions and search parties explored the Canadian Arctic, {{which resulted in a}} thorough charting of the region, along with a possible passage. Many artifacts from the expedition were found over the next century and a half, including notes that the ships were ice-locked in 1846 near King William Island, about halfway through the passage, and unable to break free. Records showed Franklin died in 1847 and Captain Francis Rawdon Moira Crozier took over command. In 1848 the expedition abandoned the two ships and its members tried to escape south across the tundra by sledge. Although some of the crew may have survived into the early 1850s, no evidence has ever been found of any survivors. In 1853 explorer John Rae was told by local Inuit about the disastrous fate of Franklin's expedition, but his reports were not welcomed in Britain.|$|E
