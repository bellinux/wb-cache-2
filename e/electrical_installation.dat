An argument against {{the high cost of}} such an <b>electrical</b> <b>installation</b> was that the cost would be lower in a city or district where there was already an infrastructure set up to power electric lighting and electrical railways. The same current supply could be used for the electric fire engine system.|$|E

To use mode 1, the <b>electrical</b> <b>installation</b> must comply with the safety regulations and must have an earthing system, a circuit breaker to protect against overload and an earth leakage protection. The sockets have blanking devices to prevent accidental contacts.|$|E

The risk evaluation and the admissible limit values of the touch voltages in the IECKENELEC documents for the two cases are very different. In each case, conventional safety rules are fixed...|$|R
25|$|NEMA wall {{receptacles}} can {{be found}} installed in any orientation. Neither NEMA nor the US National Electrical Code nor the Canadian Electrical Code specify a preferred orientation, but the National Electrical Contractors Association's National <b>Electrical</b> <b>Installation</b> Standards (NECA 130-2010) specify that the preferred location of the ground is on top. When the ground blade of a receptacle is on the bottom, the neutral blade is on the upper left and the hot blade is on the upper right. All descriptions below assume this orientation (i.e. clockwise order is ground, neutral, hot for 120V receptacle versions; and counter-clockwise for plug versions).|$|E
25|$|The 5-15 socket is {{standard}} in Canada, the United States, Mexico and Panama. It {{is also used}} in Central America, the Caribbean, northern South America (Colombia, Ecuador, Venezuela and, as a legacy, parts of Brazil), Japan, Taiwan, the Philippines and Saudi Arabia. This socket is recommended in IEC standard 60906-2 for 120 volt 60Hz installations. Looking directly at a NEMA 5-15 socket in the commonly found orientation of ground (earth) at the bottom, the neutral slot is on the left, and the line slot is on the right. However, in the US the National <b>Electrical</b> <b>Installation</b> Standards (NECA 130-2010) specifies that the ground hole should be on top. Sideways installation is also permitted; in this case, NECA 130-2010 specifies the neutral (long) slot is on top.|$|E

The electromagnetically operated friction clutch tended to burn out at normal operating voltages, the direct current components often caused arcing and the mechanical components wore out more quickly than anticipated. In addition the system was not water resistant and often malfunctioned when water entered the turrets, a not uncommon occurrence. It {{was replaced by a}} more reliable system in 1905.|$|E

The whole monument is built around a frame of reinforced concrete and was originally fastened together with lead, bronze cables and lime mortar. However, some of the original materials were replaced with polyurethane filler during restoration. There is a room inside the Monument, accessed through a door in its rear side, which contains a staircase leading upwards in the Monument that is used for <b>electrical</b> <b>installation</b> and to provide access to the sewerage. The room cannot be accessed by the public and is used mainly as storage, however it has been proposed that the room could be redesigned forming a small exhibition, which would be used to introduce foreign officials visiting Latvia with the history of the Monument after the flower-laying ceremony.|$|E

2500|$|Because {{they have}} no earth {{connections}} they have been or are being phased out in most countries. The regulations of countries using the CEE7/3 and CEE7/5 socket standards vary in whether CEE7/1 sockets are still permitted in environments where the need for earthing is less critical. Sweden, for example, prohibited them from new installations in 1994. In Romania, when the <b>electrical</b> <b>installation</b> of a premises is being replaced earthed sockets are installed; yet CEE 7/1 wall sockets are still available in hardware stores, and in rural {{areas of the country}} there are still houses being built and outfitted with sockets lacking the earth connection in rooms other than the bathroom and kitchen, following the formerly standard practice in Romania. In Germany unearthed sockets are rare, whereas in the Netherlands and Sweden it is still common to find them in [...] "dry areas" [...] such as in bedrooms or living rooms. Some countries prohibit use of unearthed and earthed sockets in the same room, in the [...] "insulated room" [...] concept, so that people cannot touch an earthed object and one that has become live, at the same time.|$|E
2500|$|The term plug is {{in general}} and {{technical}} use in all forms of English, common alternatives being power plug, [...] electric plug, and (in the UK) plug top. The normal technical term (in both British and International English) for an AC power socket is socket-outlet, but in non-technical contexts {{a number of other}} terms are in common use. In British English the general term is socket, but there are numerous common alternatives, including power point, plug socket, wall socket, and wall plug. In American English receptacle (which is a term not defined in IEC 60050) is used in official standards and codes such as the NEMA connector standard and the National Electrical Code. [...] The American National Electrical Contractors Association's National <b>Electrical</b> <b>Installation</b> Standards (NECA 130-2010) defines outlet as [...] "A point on the wiring system at which current is taken to supply utilization equipment." [...] In common use outlet is used to refer to the actual receptacle or socket, sometimes with qualifiers such as wall outlet, electrical outlet and electrical receptacle, all of these sometimes {{to be found in the}} same document. [...] There is also colloquial use of socket in American English.|$|E
