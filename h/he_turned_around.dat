5|$|In {{the first}} {{televised}} match, Randy Orton faced Kurt Angle. In {{the early stages}} both superstars took the advantage over one another. Angle controlled most of the match, as Orton tried to avoid Angle's assaults. Angle tried to perform a suplex on Orton off the ring apron, but did not perform the move. This was followed by Angle performing a belly to back suplex on Orton on the outside ring floor. Mid-way in the match, Orton attempted to perform an RKO by jumping and grabbing Angle's head to drive it over his shoulders, but he countered by pushing Orton to the turnbuckle. Orton took the padding off the turnbuckle, leaving it exposed. Following this, Angle began performing a series of German suplexes on Orton. Angle then applied the ankle lock hold. Orton, however, flipped over and sent Angle face-first into the exposed turnbuckle. As <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>around,</b> Orton performed the RKO, and covered Angle to gain the pinfall victory.|$|E

The bulldozer kept moving, and she slipped and fell off the plow. But the bulldozer kept moving, the shovel above her. I guess it was about 10 or 15 meters that it dragged her {{and for some reason}} didn't stop. We shouted like crazy to the operator through loudspeakers that he should stop, but he just kept going and didn't lift the shovel. Then it stopped and backed up. We ran to Rachel. She was still breathing.|$|E
25|$|Earlier in {{the same}} year, 71 BC, Marcus Lucullus also played a minor role in the defeat of Spartacus' slave army. He was prematurely {{recalled}} from his post in Macedonia in order {{to assist with the}} suppression of the rebellious slaves. At the time, Spartacus had just managed to force his way through Crassus' troops that had him cornered near Rhegium, across from Sicily, and made his way to Brundisium, across from Greece, presumably to sail from there to Greece or Illyrium. Yet when he received the news that Marcus Lucullus and his troops had already landed in Brundisium, <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>around</b> and faced Crassus' pursuing army for the final and decisive battle of the war.|$|E

25|$|On April 3, 1882, {{after eating}} breakfast, the Fords and Jameses {{went into the}} living room before {{traveling}} to Platte City for a robbery. From the newspaper, James had just learned that gang member Dick Liddil had confessed to participating in Wood Hite's murder. He was suspicious that the Fords had not told him about it. Robert Ford later said he believed that James had realized they were there to betray him. Instead of confronting them, James walked across the living room and laid his revolvers on a sofa. <b>He</b> <b>turned</b> <b>around</b> and noticed a dusty picture above the mantle, and stood on a chair to clean it. Robert Ford drew his weapon, and shot the unarmed Jesse James {{in the back of the}} head.|$|E
25|$|White House {{correspondent}} Seth Kantor — who was {{a passenger}} in the motorcade — testified that after President Kennedy was shot, he had visited Parkland Hospital while the wounded President was receiving care.

According to Kantor, Ruby asked him if he thought that it would be a good idea for him to close his nightclubs for the next three nights because of the tragedy and Kantor responded with thinking that doing so would be a good idea.|$|E
25|$|The Spanish Supreme Central and Governing Junta of the Kingdom {{planned to}} launch a two-pronged attack on Madrid {{in the fall of}} 1809. In the west, Del Parque's Army of the Left enjoyed some success against Marchand's weak VI Corps. When the Spanish general learned that the other {{offensive}} prong had been crushed at Ocaña, <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>around</b> and began retreating rapidly to the south. At the same time, Marchand was reinforced by a dragoon division under Kellermann. Taking command, Kellermann raced in pursuit of the Army of the Left, catching up with it at Alba de Tormes. Not waiting for their own foot soldiers, the French dragoons and light cavalry fell upon the Spanish infantry and defeated it. Marchand's infantry arrived in time to mop up, but the cavalry had done most of the fighting. Del Parque's men retreated into the mountains where they spent a miserable few months.|$|E

25|$|In January 1945, when Easy Company's initial {{attack on}} the German-occupied town of Foy bogged down due to the poor {{leadership}} of its commander, 1st Lieutenant Norman Dike, battalion executive officer Captain Richard Winters ordered Speirs to relieve Dike of command. The selection of Speirs was incidental; Winters later stated that Speirs was simply the first officer he saw when <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>around.</b> Speirs successfully took over the assault and led Easy Company to victory. During this battle, Lt. Dike had ordered a platoon {{to go on a}} flanking mission around the rear of the town. To countermand this order, Speirs himself ran through the town and German lines (as this platoon had no radio), linked up with the Item Company soldiers and relayed the order. Having completed this, he then ran back through the German-occupied town. He was reassigned as commanding officer of Easy Company and remained in that position {{for the rest of the}} war. Of the officers who commanded Easy Company during the war, Speirs commanded the longest.|$|E

Washington gave orders not to fire until he gave them the signal, and when they were thirty yards away, <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>around</b> on his horse, facing his men and said [...] "Halt!" [...] and then [...] "Fire!". At this moment, the British also fired, obscuring the field in a cloud of smoke. One of Washington's officers, John Fitzgerald, pulled his hat over his eyes to avoid seeing Washington killed, but when the smoke cleared, Washington appeared, unharmed, waving his men forward.|$|E

Jebavý corroborated Blythe's testimony that Blythe asked [...] "Are you okay?" [...] after Nosek fell and that the crowd gave him a positive reply. However, as Nosek fell sick after the concert, they called him an ambulance. According to Jebavý, the band had not warned the fans against getting on stage and the security guards did not pay much attention to it.|$|E
500|$|Romney {{was born}} to American parents living in the Mormon colonies in Mexico; events during the Mexican Revolution forced his family to flee back to the United States {{when he was a}} child. The family lived in several states and ended up in Salt Lake City, Utah, where they {{struggled}} during the Great Depression. [...] Romney worked in a number of jobs, served as a Mormon missionary in the United Kingdom, and attended several colleges in the U.S. but did not graduate from any of them. [...] In 1939 he moved to Detroit and joined the American Automobile Manufacturers Association, where he served as the chief spokesman for the automobile industry during World War II and headed a cooperative arrangement in which companies could share production improvements. [...] He joined Nash-Kelvinator in 1948, and became the chief executive of its successor, American Motors Corporation, in 1954. [...] There <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>around</b> the struggling firm by focusing all efforts on the compact Rambler car. [...] Romney mocked the products of the [...] "Big Three" [...] automakers as [...] "gas-guzzling dinosaurs" [...] and {{became one of the first}} high-profile, media-savvy business executives.

According to Selman, Wilmore gave an [...] "Oscar-worthy performance". [...] "I was terrified", he stated in the DVD commentary for the episode, [...] " [...] a twenty-minute discussion in which [...] said that [...] children were teased at school , and that the Fox affiliate were gonna be thrown off the air..."

500|$|Filming was {{originally}} {{set to begin}} in early 1998. In the summer of 1997, Superman Lives entered pre-production, with an art department employed under production designer Rick Heinrichs. Burton hired Wesley Strick to rewrite Smith's script. Smith was disappointed, stating, [...] "The studio was happy with what I was doing. Then Tim Burton got involved, and when he signed his pay-or-play deal, <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>around</b> and {{said he wanted to}} do his version of Superman. So who is Warner Bros. going back to? The guy who made Clerks, or the guy who made them half a billion dollars on Batman?" [...] When Strick read Smith's script, he was annoyed with the fact that [...] "Superman was accompanied/shadowed by someone/something called the Eradicator." [...] He also felt that [...] "Brainiac's evil plot of launching a disk in space to block out the sun and make Superman powerless was reminiscent of an episode of The Simpsons, with Mr. Burns doing the Brainiac role." [...] However, after reading The Death and Return of Superman, Strick was able to understand some of the elements of Smith's script. Strick's rewrite featured Superman as an existentialist, thinking of himself to be an outsider on Earth. Superman is threatened by Brainiac and Lex Luthor, who later amalgamate into [...] "Lexiac," [...] described by Strick as [...] "a schizo/scary mega-villain." [...] Superman is later resurrected by the power of 'K,' a natural force representing the spirit of Krypton, as he defeats Lexiac.|$|E
500|$|In First Test at Brisbane Tallon {{took two}} catches but scored only 14 in a victory. Tallon {{was worried that}} his poor batting might lead to him being replaced, but he was {{retained}} as Australia secured an innings victory in Sydney. He put in a polished performance with the gloves, with four catches and two stumpings, in addition to 30runs. The only negative aspect of the match for Tallon was that he dislocated his finger. Beyond the raw statistics, two of the catches that Tallon made in the first innings were regarded as among his finest ever and turned the tide of the match. Len Hutton and Bill Edrichtwo of England's leading batsmenhad seen their team to lunch with only the loss of one wicket. Tallon declared to Bradman {{that he intended to}} dismiss Hutton down the leg side, so Bradman brought off spinner Ian Johnson into the attack immediately after lunch. Johnson was instructed to bowl at Hutton's legs to give him an opportunity to glance the ball. Hutton obliged and struck the ball from the middle of his bat, expecting a boundary. <b>He</b> <b>turned</b> <b>around</b> and was shocked to see that Tallon had intercepted the ball from a blind position at a range of just one metre. The score was 2/88 as Hutton, who held the Test world record score was dismissed and replaced at the batting crease by Denis Compton. Bradman introduced McCool and Compton misjudged a cut shot which went wide of Tallon and struck Johnson, fielding at slip, in the chest. The ball rebounded past Tallon's shoulder and was heading for the ground when he spun and dived backwards to catch it just before it landed. According to Roland Perry, it was [...] "an acrobatic feat that would put any trapeze artist in the shade, taking one of the most brilliant catches in Test history". Tallon took another difficult catch from McCool to dismiss Hammond as England fell to 4/99, with three specialist batsmen to improbable catches. This restricted England and allowed Australia to set up a match-winning lead.|$|E
