An investigation of a fourth grade class shows that over half of the students had not learned to tie their shoes.

40|$|This article {{reports a}} case study {{research}} of a textile module at the year - long module based course in arts and handicrafts at the Teacher Education at Nesna University College. The textile modules main focus {{is to give the}} students practica l aesthetic experience as well as basic knowledge and skills of textiles and their qualities. The module has been regularly assessed by teachers and students, revised and developed, and offered for several years. Assessments show that students appreciate t he module and its focus on basic knowledge and skills in textile. However, as an arts and <b>handicrafts</b> <b>teacher</b> at the college level, I’ve observed that students basic skills are underdeveloped, and some have unrealistic insight, demands and expectations abo ut how much knowledge and experience a thirty five hour course in textiles will give. Some students with little or no textile experience have problems with interpreting and understanding the written task and also “getting started”. Detailed explanations co ncerning the content seem to confuse rather than enlighten, and students’ fear of failing gives me as a teacher several thoughts about cause and effect. In this case study a qualitative survey of a textile module’s schedule, student’s questions and desires for explanations, their written tasks, products and assessments are being used to enlighten and understand the problem. The results show that a detailed explanation of a practical aesthetic assignment does not contribute to increased understanding with so me students, whereas a confrontation of the practical process wil...|$|E

We have made contact with several international researchers who may be potential collaborators in the future. The comments on our papers and posters reinforced the timeliness of our research and its applicability {{to a variety of}} fields. Introduction -Technology allows us to transcend time and space. Our world has become essentially without boundaries. Nursing education has changed, and will continue to evolve as technology advances. Already many nurses, especially in master’s programs, learn in virtual classrooms with students and teachers separated by geography. To be effective, online education must be different in presentation and approach than face-to-face teaching. To help students who study online achieve learning outcomes nurse educators need to develop and effectively use technologically-based teaching strategies. Objectives - The objective of this presentation is to share research focused on a category of online teaching strategies called artistic pedagogical technologies (APTs). APTs are teaching activities based on the arts. They can include elements of music, drama, literature, movies, poetry, and <b>handicrafts.</b> APTs help <b>teachers</b> create effective online educational environments. APTs were developed by the presenters and have been used in online graduate courses in nursing and health studies. Methods - This qualitative study included a convenience sample of nurse educators who completed an online master’s course in which APTs of reflective poetry, photovoice, conceptual quilting, movie reviews, story-telling, and photostory were used. Participants completed an online questionnaire based on Purkey’s (2007) Elements of the Invitational Classroom which captured their views on the effect of APTs on trust, respect, and optimism in the online classroom. Some nurses also participated in a teleconference focus group which was recorded and transcribed. Data were hand-coded for themes and secondary analysis was achieved using NVivo. Results - Data analysis continues. Preliminarily findings indicate that APTs have a role in enhancing the invitationality of online courses because of the positive effect they seem to have on trust, respect, and optimism. Through participation in APTs, trust is established as participants learn to accept each other and themselves. As the term proceeded the quality of the contributions improved and students became more able, and thus even more valued by their colleagues and teacher. The cycle continued and respect resulted. Based on the student responses, the APTs helped move student potential to greater heights thus increasing optimism. While APTs may be effective strategies, preliminary findings suggest that {{the way in which the}} teacher presents the activities is also important. That is, teachers need to invite learners to participate in APTs, describe each activity clearly, indicate to learners how it can contribute to their learning, and provide support and encouragement to students as they engage in these novel learning activities. Conclusion - In summary, we found the classroom environment changed in positive ways in part because of the APTs. Research participants reported that APTs increased the quality of interactions, enhanced the sense of community, and furthered the application of course content. Purkey’s (1997) invitational theory, specifically the propositions of trust, respect, optimism, and intentionality, help to explain these findings. Practical ideas for educators regarding the use of APTs in teaching and course design were reviewed.
