40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} conducted to obtain combustion performance values for specific <b>heavyend,</b> synthetic hydrocarbon fuels. A flame tube combustor modified to duplicate an advanced gas turbine engine combustor {{was used for the}} tests. Each fuel was tested at steady-state operating conditions over a range of mass flow rates, fuel-to-air mass ratio, and inlet air temperatures. The combustion pressure, as well as the hardware, were kept nearly constant over the program test phase. Test results were obtained in regards to geometric temperature pattern factors as a function of combustor wall temperatures, the combustion gas temperature, and the combustion emissions, both as affected by the mass flow rate and fuel-to-air ratio. The synthetic fuels were reacted in the combustor such that for most tests their performance was as good, if not better, than the baseline gasoline or diesel fuel tests. The only detrimental effects were that at high inlet air temperature conditions, fuel decomposition occurred in the fuel atomizing nozzle passages resulting in blockage. And the nitrogen oxide emissions were above EPA limits at low flow rate and high operating temperature conditions...|$|E
40|$|Heavy-end {{drug use}} is a widely studied topic, however much of the {{research}} within the field considers the phenomenon from perspectives of individual or social pathology, devoid of any pleasure or meaning-making potential for the user. In order to gain rich understanding of the local heavy-end crack cocaine culture, this thesis utilises a methodology of ‘non-traditional ethnography’ wherein my ‘player’ role as a drug treatment practitioner replaces the traditional approach of ‘insider’ within ethnographic research. This positioning compliments the in-depth interviews which I have conducted with 25 <b>heavyend</b> crack cocaine users from an area of the North East of England. Despite the area being believed to be largely unaffected by crack cocaine, an established and evolving local crack cocaine market was found to exist. The market and distribution networks were found to be extremely complex and multi-faceted and as much a social market as an economic market. In contrast to the image of the ‘powerless addict’, users were found to often be calculated consumers, who had developed sufficient knowledge and skill to negotiate their way around this alternative consumer culture. Indeed, the development of finely honed skills was a key theme throughout the study, resulting in the application of Stephen Lyng’s edgework concept. The development of this alternative conceptual vocabulary is found to have significant implications for understanding heavy-end crack cocaine use and crack cocaine treatment approaches.
