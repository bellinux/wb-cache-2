50|$|The <b>drum</b> <b>motor</b> needs fewer {{parts and}} has low {{inventory}} costs as it just {{consists of the}} <b>drum</b> <b>motor</b> and two fixing brackets. Unlike conventional drives that require up to 8 or more separate components, most of which have to be purchased from different suppliers or manufactures specially.Further advantage is its dimension. The <b>drum</b> <b>motor</b> is often lighter than conventional drives and the weight is evenly distributed within the conveyor frame.The motor, gear box and bearings are totally enclosed and sealed in a shell, therefore {{they are unlikely to}} fail due to harmful environmental conditions such as water, dust, dirt, grit, chemicals, grease, oil, and so on.|$|E
5000|$|Because the <b>drum</b> <b>motor</b> {{is totally}} enclosed, {{requires}} no maintenance {{and has a}} smooth clean profile without any additional equipment or protrusions, it cannot contaminate food, electrical equipment or pharmaceutical substances. Furthermore, when manufactured in stainless steel the <b>drum</b> <b>motor</b> can be hygienically cleaned and sanitized regularly using high pressure water, steam or chemicals which makes it the most hygienic conveyor drive design to date. Cleaning is much quicker and easier and often reduces operating costs specially in food processing applications ...|$|E

5000|$|... 20 {{years later}} this very early concept was finally {{conveyed}} into an industrial drive. In the early 1950s the Danish inventor and entrepreneur John Kirkegaard designed the first industrial-type <b>drum</b> <b>motor.</b>|$|E
50|$|The exposed drum shafts {{are used}} to install and fix the <b>drum</b> <b>motor</b> into the {{conveyor}} frame and do not rotate. The shaft can be a single “through” shaft where the motor and gearbox are assembled on, and fixed to, the shaft with keys or pins. However, this type of <b>drum</b> <b>motor</b> design has a limited maximum radial load due to the bending stresses caused by the normal belt tension of a conveyor and is therefore used mainly for small light duty conveyors and loads. For heavier loads the most common design is to use two separate shafts, one fixed to the motor housing and one fixed to the gearbox housing where the mass of metal from the motor and gearbox significantly increases {{the strength of the}} <b>drum</b> <b>motor</b> allowing much higher payloads and longer conveyor applications. Typically one shaft is short (stub shaft) with a consistent length and the other increases in length according to the drum shell or belt width. Over certain widths, the shaft can be further reinforced to prevent bending under high belt tension.|$|E
50|$|The <b>drum</b> <b>motor</b> {{concept was}} first {{recorded}} in 1928 {{but was not}} realised until the early 1950s {{when it was first}} produced specifically for conveyor belt applications. The idea was to produce a compact, totally enclosed single component drive unit with high efficiency and lower frictional losses than a conventional geared motor. The new design was quick and easy to install, required no maintenance and because of its totally enclosed IP66 sealed design would be unaffected by dust, dirt grease or water. Today you see many examples of <b>drum</b> <b>motor</b> applications in airport check-in conveyors and security machines, supermarket checkstands, food processing conveyors and weighing equipment. Reversible drum motors are also used for roller shutter doors.|$|E
50|$|Most <b>drum</b> <b>motors</b> can {{be fitted}} with back stop {{non-reversing}} bearings to prevent belts in inclined conveyors from rolling back or with electro-magnetic brakes for reversible inclined conveyors or for quick stopping. Incremental encoders {{can also be}} integrated into the rotor bearings to provide a closed loop control system for tracking, positioning and accurate tracing of the product on the belt.|$|R

50|$|The <b>drum</b> <b>motor</b> {{is one of}} {{the safest}} drives and lowers the safety costs as the drive is totally {{enclosed}} without protruding parts and the external shafts are always stationary. The only moving external parts are the drum shell and bearing housings.|$|E

50|$|Test {{results showed}} drum motors used 32% less energy (unloaded) and 47% less energy (loaded) than a {{comparable}} geared motor drive thus helping {{to reduce the}} global carbon footprint. Drum motors have fewer frictional losses and a higher efficiency than conventional drives use in material handling industry, which normally transfer approximately 75% of their mechanical efficiency to the belt, compared to the <b>Drum</b> <b>Motor</b> which transfers up to 97%.|$|E

40|$|In this contribution, a {{model of}} a <b>drum</b> <b>motor</b> is presented. This model was {{designed}} for description of dynamic behaviour of the <b>drum</b> <b>motor</b> {{as well as for the}} possible implementation of several wearing phenomena. Using this model, a better understanding of wear and tear phenomena has been achieved by carrying out a considerable number of simulation runs using different operational and wearing conditions. Using this information, important knowledge about detection of wearout signs was able to be gained. Often, mathematical models with different levels of detail are used. In these cases, it may be a difficult task to obtain reliable parameters. In this paper, we present three different approaches for establishing a model structure and for the determination of needed parameters. This way, we were able to define every part of the model with an appropriate level of detail and equip them with adequate parameter values...|$|E
40|$|Part 15 : Energy TransformationInternational audienceIn {{this paper}} a {{procedure}} {{for determining the}} number of different synchronous speeds that {{can be obtained from}} the stator of a <b>drum</b> <b>motor</b> {{as a function of the}} number of slots is presented. This preliminary study is foreseen for a hysteresis high-temperature superconducting motor, but the approach is directly applied in conventional motors. The targeted device has multiphase windings, in order to achieve full flexibility in torque-speed space through electronic variation of magnetic poles. Simulations are performed in order to achieve a qualitative understanding of the behaviour of the motor, namely in what concerns to torque and settling times from initial to synchronous speed. A prototype with eighteen slots in the stator and a bulk YBCO rotor is described and built, and experimental values of torque are obtained...|$|E

5000|$|A modern {{draw-works}} {{consists of}} five main parts: the <b>drum,</b> the <b>motor(s),</b> the reduction gear, the brake, and the auxiliary brake. The motors can be AC or DC-motors, or the draw-works may be connected directly to diesel engines using metal chain-like belts. The {{number of gears}} could be one, two or three speed combinations. The main brake, usually operated manually by a long handle, may be friction band brake, a disc brake or a modified clutch. It serves as a parking brake when no motion is desired. The auxiliary brake {{is connected to the}} drum, and absorbs the energy released as heavy loads are lowered. This brake may use eddy current rotors or water-turbine-like apparatus to convert the kinetic energy of the moving load to heat and dissipate it.|$|R
5|$|A Leslie speaker {{consists}} {{of a number of}} individual components. The audio signal enters the amplifier from the instrument. Once amplified, the signal travels to an audio crossover, which splits it into separate frequency bands that can be individually routed to each loudspeaker. Different models have different combinations of speakers, but the most common model, the 122, {{consists of}} a single woofer for bass and a single compression driver and acoustic horn for treble. The audio emitted by the speakers is isolated inside an enclosure, aside from a number of outlets that lead towards either a rotating horn or <b>drum.</b> An electric <b>motor</b> rotates both horn and drum at a constant speed.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, the {{development}} of a condition monitoring method for a <b>drum</b> <b>motor</b> is presented. A mathematical model of the motor is developed. This model was designed for description of the motor's dynamic behavior and for implementation of several wearout and defect phenomena. Using this model, a good understanding of such phenomena was achieved by carrying out simulation runs using different operational and wearing conditions. Several experiments at a physical demonstrator device were carried out additionally measuring mainly the motor's phase currents under different conditions. Using this information, we were able to extract several statistical features by performing proper orthogonal decomposition. These features were used for classification of different wearout and defect states by p erforming appropriate subspace operations which yield adequate data for a Fuzzy Pattern classification algorithm. As a result we were able to identify different reference states as well as previously unknown states...|$|E
40|$|Calculation {{and testing}} methods of drum brake {{mechanisms}} {{are presented in}} {{a large number of}} papers. Intensive development of computer techniques, numerical methods and measurement techniques make a significant contribution in this domain.

One new approach for defining evaluation criteria of the properties of <b>drum</b> brakes for <b>motor</b> vehicles is presented in this paper. The complex characteristics of various types of brake mechanisms are formed according to the proposed algorithm, the fast assessment of the characteristics of the brake mechanism is performed, which is especially important in the development phase of new products, by using computer techniques for measuring, data acquisition and data processing...|$|R
40|$|Drumming {{may have}} {{therapeutic}} and learning benefits but there exists little causal evidence regarding the benefits {{for children with}} emotional and behavioural difficulties (EBD) such as Autistic Spectrum Disorder. Six EBD pupils (EBD Drum) and 6 peers (Peer Drum) were given 2, 30 minute rock drumming lessons per week, over 5 weeks. Six matched individuals received no drumming instruction (3 =EBD Control; 3 =Peer Control). An exploratory, mixed-methods {{analysis was used to}} explore quantitative changes in skills and qualitative perspectives of the teaching staff. All pupils were tested two times (pretest and posttest) on <b>drumming</b> ability and <b>Motor</b> skills (Movement Assessment Battery for Children, version 2). Teacher’s rating of social behaviour (Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire; SDQ) was tested two times (pretest and retention). Significant differences in total SDQ difficulties between the four groups (χ 2 (3) = 8. 210, p = 0. 042) and the hyperactivity subscale (χ 2 (3) = 10. 641, p = 0. 014) were observed. The EBD Drum group had greater reductions in total difficulties compared to the Peer Drum (p = 0. 009) group and specifically greater reductions in hyperactivity compared to Peer Drum (p = 0. 046) and the EBD Control (p = 0. 006) group. In follow-up interviews, staff spoke positively about changes in pupil’s attitudes towards learning and social confidence. The positive changes to social and behavioural skills reported in this pilot study are similar to those recorded for other music modalities...|$|R
