That same year, recon flights were conducted into Hurricane Inez, but there were no seedings. Both the 1967 and 1968 seasons were inactive. Because of that, there were no suitable seeding targets in either of those two seasons.|$|E

5|$|Also {{starting}} in September 1906 was {{the publication of}} the revival's own newsletter, the Apostolic Faith. Issues were published occasionally up until May 1908, mostly through the work of Seymour and a white woman named Clara Lum, a member of the Apostolic Faith Mission. The Apostolic <b>Faith</b> <b>was</b> distributed without charge, and thousands of laypersons and ministers received copies worldwide. Five thousand copies of the first edition were printed, and by 1907 the press run reached over 40,000.|$|E
5|$|Calvin {{provided}} many of {{the foundational}} documents for reformed churches, including documents on the catechism, the liturgy, and church governance. He also produced several confessions of faith in order to unite the churches. In 1559, he drafted the French confession of faith, the Gallic Confession, and the synod in Paris accepted it with few changes. The Belgic Confession of 1561, a Dutch confession of <b>faith,</b> <b>was</b> partly based on the Gallic Confession.|$|E
5|$|Emperor Jahangir first {{mentions}} his alterations to {{the fort}} in 1612 when describing the Maktab Khana.

50|$|Faith has an {{important}} role in the early scriptures. The Pāli Canon list faith as one of seven treasures (Pali: dhana), one of five spiritual faculties (Pali: indriyas), and one of the spiritual powers (Pali: balas). There are also other lists of virtues in which <b>faith</b> <b>is</b> included, and <b>faith</b> <b>is</b> also given a prominent role in canons of other early traditions, such as the Sarvāstivāda tradition. Moreover, <b>faith</b> <b>is</b> described as {{an important}} quality in stream-enterers, a state preceding enlightenment. In standard descriptions of people going forth (taking ordination as a monk), <b>faith</b> <b>is</b> mentioned as an important motivation. Despite this important role, <b>faith</b> <b>is</b> not assigned the same value as in some other religions, such as Christianity.|$|R

5|$|From the 3rd century, {{the school}} tolerated Christian teachings, {{producing}} {{a number of}} students who would become influential church leaders and bishops, such as Pamphilus of Caesarea, Severus of Antioch and Aphian.

5|$|Holland {{suggests}} {{that under the}} reign of Arab Emperor Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan, even though {{only a small percentage}} of the inhabitants of the Empire was Muslim, Mecca was intentionally yet erroneously portrayed as Muhammad's home and the birthplace of Islam in order to provide the religion with Arabian origins. Holland argues that in doing so, the <b>faith</b> <b>was</b> dissociated from the Jewish or Christian heritage that would have been self evident at a location in the Negev.|$|E
5|$|Responding to Baron d'Holbach's Système de la Nature (1770) and David Hume's Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion (1779) {{as well as}} {{the works}} of the French philosophers, Priestley {{maintained}} that materialism and determinism could be reconciled with a belief in God.

5|$|Throughout the denomination's existence, {{theological}} battles were {{fought over}} how the Confession of Faith would be interpreted. During the 19th century, Old School Presbyterians insisted that the Confession be interpreted according to strict Calvinism, while the New School Presbyterians favored a looser interpretation. From 1910 to 1927, the Confession of <b>Faith</b> <b>was</b> officially interpreted with reference to five fundamental beliefs: biblical inerrancy, the virgin birth, substitutionary atonement, the bodily resurrection, and the miracles of Christ.|$|E
5|$|Adopting the {{theories}} of academic historian Patricia Crone as a basis, Holland asserted {{that there was little}} hard evidence for the origins of Islam and asked why it took several decades after the death of Muhammad for his name to appear on surviving documents or artifacts. Arguing that there was little evidence for how the <b>faith</b> <b>was</b> born, he suggested that the city of Mecca {{may not have been the}} real birthplace of Muhammad and Islam, and– while not clearly disputing Muhammad's existence as a real historical figure– claimed that much of the Islamic origin story was later developed in the early years of the Arab Empire.|$|E
5|$|Biographers {{and critics}} agree that Louis Lambert is a thinly veiled {{version of the}} author, {{evidenced}} by numerous similarities between them. As {{a student at the}} Collège de Vendôme, Balzac was friends with a boy named Louis-Lambert Tinant. Like the title character, Balzac's <b>faith</b> <b>was</b> shaken {{at the time of his}} first communion. Balzac read voraciously while in school, and – like Lambert – was often punished for misbehaving in class. The precise details of the school also reflect Balzac's time there: as described in the novel, students were allowed to keep pigeons and tend gardens, and holidays were spent in the dormitories.|$|E

50|$|Fideism is an {{epistemological}} theory which {{maintains that}} <b>faith</b> <b>is</b> independent of reason, or that reason and <b>faith</b> <b>are</b> hostile {{to each other}} and <b>faith</b> <b>is</b> superior at arriving at particular truths (see natural theology). Fideism is not a synonym for religious belief, but describes a particular philosophical proposition in regard to the relationship between faith's appropriate jurisdiction at arriving at truths, contrasted against reason. It states that <b>faith</b> <b>is</b> needed to determine some philosophical and religious truths, and it questions the ability of reason to arrive at all truth. The word and concept had its origin in the mid- to late-19th century by way of Catholic thought, in a movement called Traditionalism. The Roman Catholic Magisterium has, however, repeatedly condemned fideism.|$|R
5|$|By 1912, Sadler and his wife, both doctors by then, {{operated}} a joint practice in Chicago that catered to children's and women's health issues. Sadler initially focused on surgery, performing surgeries with his wife, but widened his practice to include psychiatric counseling in 1930 {{and became a}} consulting psychiatrist at Columbus Hospital. As a psychiatrist, Sadler advocated {{an eclectic mix of}} techniques, applying the theories of Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung, Alfred Adler, and Adolf Meyer. Sadler believed that religious <b>faith</b> <b>was</b> beneficial to mental health, and specifically promoted prayer, which he believed to be most effective in the context of Christian faith. However, he thought that religious beliefs were deleterious to mental health if based on fear.|$|E
5|$|Convoy <b>Faith</b> <b>was</b> a small, fast Allied {{convoy of}} World War II. It {{suffered}} heavy casualties when attacked by German Focke-Wulf Fw200 Condor long-range bombers while {{en route from}} Britain to West Africa in July 1943. The convoy comprised two large troopships and a freighter, later joined by two destroyers and two frigates as escorts at various dates after it sailed on 7July 1943. The two troopships, SS California and SS Duchess of York, both former liners, were carrying military personnel to West Africa, where locally recruited troops were to be embarked as reinforcements for the Allied forces in Burma and the Middle East. The freighter MV Port Fairy, carrying ammunition, was ultimately bound for Australia and New Zealand via the Panama canal.|$|E
5|$|In 1166 Maimonides went to Egypt {{and settled}} in Fustat, where he gained much renown as a physician, practising in the family of Saladin and in that of his vizier Ḳaḍi al-Faḍil al-Baisami, and Saladin's successors. The title Ra'is al-Umma or al-Millah (Head of the Nation or of the <b>Faith),</b> <b>was</b> {{bestowed}} upon him. In Fustat, he wrote his Mishneh Torah (1180) and The Guide for the Perplexed.

5|$|In that time, the Christian <b>faith</b> <b>was</b> {{shaken by}} the {{contrast}} between Miaphysites and Chalcedonians. These were two opposing christological positions; the Chalcedonians claimed that Christ had both human and divine natures, while the Miaphysites claimed he had only one single united nature. The Council of Chalcedon, convoked by Emperor Marcian in 451, had ruled out Miaphysitism, {{with the support of}} the pope in the West and many bishops in the East. However, the Miaphysite position was still strong: the two Miaphysite Patriarchs Timothy Aelurus of Alexandria and Peter the Fuller of Antioch were deposed.|$|E
5|$|On his deathbed, Hamilton {{asked the}} Episcopal Bishop of New York, Benjamin Moore, {{to give him}} holy communion. Moore {{initially}} declined to do so, on two grounds: that {{to participate in a}} duel was a mortal sin, and that Hamilton, although undoubtedly sincere in his <b>faith,</b> <b>was</b> {{not a member of the}} Episcopalian denomination. After leaving, Moore was persuaded to return that afternoon by the urgent pleas of Hamilton's friends, and upon receiving Hamilton's solemn assurance that he repented for his part in the duel, Moore gave him communion. Bishop Moore returned the next morning, stayed with Hamilton for several hours until his death, and conducted the funeral service at Trinity Church.|$|E
5|$|On {{the evening}} of 11July, four days after sailing, Convoy <b>Faith</b> <b>was</b> {{attacked}} by three Condors. Both troopships were severely damaged and subsequently sunk by torpedoes from the escorts; over 100 of the personnel aboard the two ships were killed. The freighter escaped unscathed, but was damaged in a second air attack on 12July en route to Casablanca. The loss of the two troopships delayed the movement of a division of West African soldiers to India until four replacements arrived.|$|E
