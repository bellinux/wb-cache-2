40|$|Enhancing the {{comprehensiveness}} {{of sustainability}} assessment requires {{the adoption of}} methodologies for integrated assessments. Nowadays, decision makers in business and policy are increasingly confronted with multifaceted challenges in their search of sustainable solutions. A close link between science and decision making especially on strategic level has been considered a key step for developing robust and effective decisions that can contribute to a more sustainable society. In this context, life cycle assessment (LCA) —due to its systemic approach—is considered crucial to provide support in better integrating environmental sustainability into decision making. Evidence thereof is given in numerous cases developed by organisations at different level and illustrated in the present contribution, {{with a focus on}} the European context. Two policy related initiatives are discussed in more detail: the EU Ecodesign Directive, aiming at setting <b>ecodesign</b> <b>requirements</b> for energy related products; and the EU Communication on Building a Single Market for Green Products and the related Recommendation on the use of common methods to measure and communicate the life cycle environmental performance of products and organisations.

This Regulation mainly concerns manufacturers of water pumps placing these products on the European market. However customers may also be affected. Europump has created a guideline to clarify questions which may arise with the entry into force of the water pumps Regulation EU 547/2012. There are two ecodesign requirements: the minimum efficiency requirements represented by an index called ‘minimum efficiency index’ or MEI {{as well as information}} requirements for rotodynamic water pumps such as the efficiency graphs. From 1 January 2013, water pumps shall have a minimum efficiency index of MEI ≥ 0.1 and from 1 January 2015, water pumps shall have an even stricter minimum efficiency index of MEI ≥ 0.4; from 1 January 2013, the information on water pumps shall comply with the requirements.|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, the European Ecodesign Directive {{has emerged}} as a new {{approach}} to integrate environmental concerns into the product design and related processes. Ecodesign aims to minimize environmental impacts throughout the product life cycle, without compromising performances and costs. In addition, the recent Ecodesign Directives require products which are increasingly eco-friendly and eco-efficient, preserving high-performances. It is very important for producers measuring performances, for electric cooking ranges, hobs, ovens, and grills for household use, and a low power consumption of appliances represents a powerful selling point, also in terms of <b>ecodesign</b> <b>requirements.</b> The <b>Ecodesign</b> Directive provides a clear framework about the sustainable design of products and it has been extended in 2009 to all energy-related products, or products with an impact on energy consumption during the use. The European Regulation establishes measures of ecodesign of ovens, hobs, and kitchen hoods, and domestic use and energy efficiency of a product has a significant environmental aspect in the use phase which is the most impactful in the life cycle. It is important that the product parameters and performances are not affected by <b>ecodesign</b> <b>requirements</b> from a user’s point of view, and the benefits of reducing energy consumption in the use phase should offset the possible environmental impact in the production stage. Accurate measurements of cooking appliance performance are essential to help the industry to produce more energy efficient appliances. The development of ecodriven products requires ecoinnovation and ecodesign tools to support the sustainability improvement. The ecodesign tools should be practical and focused on specific ecoobjectives in order to be largely diffused. The main scope of this paper is the development, implementation, and testing of an innovative tool, which could be an improvement for the sustainable design of induction hobs. In particular, a prototypical software tool is developed in order to simulate the energy performances of the induction hobs. The tool is focused on a multiphysics model which is able to simulate the energy performances and the efficiency of induction hobs starting from the design data. The multiphysics model is composed by an electromagnetic simulation and a thermal simulation. The electromagnetic simulation is able to calculate the eddy current induced in the pot, which leads to the Joule heating of material. The thermal simulation is able to measure the energy consumption during the operational phase. The Joule heating caused from the eddy currents is the output of electromagnetic simulation and the input of thermal ones. The aims of the paper are the development of integrated tools and methodologies of virtual prototyping {{in the context of the}} ecodesign. This tool could be a revolutionary instrument in the field of industrial engineering and it gives consideration to the environmental aspects of product design and focus on the ecodesign of energy-related products, in order to achieve a reduced environmental impact...|$|R
40|$|In {{the context}} of the EU Ecodesign Directive, {{one of the reasons for}} the {{relative}} lack of <b>ecodesign</b> <b>requirements</b> related to material efficiency in the implementing measures is the absence of adequate metrics and standards. This paper propose a framework to systematically identify standardization needs and features, in order to eventually boost sustainable engineering and resource use. Such standards will support the setting of appropriate material efficiency requirements in EU product policy, still taking a lifecycle perspective. Three high-level policy goals concerning material efficiency of products were identified: embodied impact reduction, lifetime extension and residual waste reduction. Through a lifecycle perspective, a matrix of interactions among material efficiency topics (recycled content, re-used content, relevant material content, durability, upgradability, reparability, re-manufacturability, reusability, recyclability, recoverability, relevant material separability) and policy goals was created. The framework was tested on two case studies, electronic displays and washing machines. Depending on the potential material efficiency requirement, specific standardization needs were identified, such as adequate metrics and units for performance measurements, reliable and repeatable tests, calculation procedures, reference tables and structured templates for results. The proposed novel framework aims at providing a methodology by which to identify key material efficiency considerations relevant to the policy context, and map out the generic and product specific standardisation needs. Many different stakeholders (industry, academics, policy makers, non-governmental organizations, etc.) can be involved to work on material efficiency standards and regulations, by using such a systematic approach. Requirements and standards concerning material efficiency would compel product manufacturers, but also help designers and interested parties in addressing the sustainable resource use issue. JRC.

40|$|In the European Union (EU), {{mandatory}} durability <b>ecodesign</b> <b>requirements</b> {{have recently}} been set for vacuum cleaners and lighting products. Durability standards for additional product groups are expected {{in the future and}} it is also envisioned that durability issues will be integrated in the EU energy labelling scheme. Durability standards can bring environmental benefits, but there are several methodological challenges, not least regarding the trade-offs between different product attributes. In this paper, we review previous literature and studies examining durability and increased lifetimes for products, with a focus on the case of LEDs. We analyse the methods suggested and assumptions used and compare these to an innovative method for calculating an attribute-adjusted least life cycle cost (LLCC) when durability is included. Then we analyse the case of LEDs available in an online market in 2016 and model optimal lifetimes in relation to life cycle costs. The model identifies factors influencing optimal lifetimes. The statistical error of the regressions does not allow for calculation of the optima with precision, but the calculation is illustrative that the LLCC optima for the range of LED bulbs considered is close to 25000 hours. The model also indicates that greater durability is important for cases with smaller discount rates and more intensive use of the product. We discuss the usefulness of the method and its application and development in context of policy development of durability standards, as well as future research that can complement this approach. The initial results indicate that, at least from an LLCC perspective, longer lifetimes than currently required by standards may be desirable, so we also discuss {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} using three different policy instruments to stimulate increased durability...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} aims {{to contribute}} to the review process of the specific <b>ecodesign</b> <b>requirements</b> on the durability of the hose and the operational motor lifetime of the vacuum cleaner (VC) product group. For this purpose a comprehensive method for the environmental and economic assessment of extending the lifetime of VCs has been developed and applied, based on the former indexes developed within the ‘REAPro’ method (Ardente and Mathieux, 2014). The starting point of the analysis was the performing of a Life Cycle Assessment of an exemplary VC, complemented with the analysis of the literature. The functional unit was a bagged canister VC with an operating time of 10 years. A sensitivity analysis has been implemented considering potential changes in the manufacturing, repair, maintenance and energy consumption. Successively, the potential extensions of the lifetime of the VC have been analysed through the application of Durability indexes. The research showed that extending the lifetime of VCs generally implies benefits, from both environmental and economic perspectives, for the large majority of scenarios considered. In general, these benefits already exist for small extensions of lifetime, and they become significant if the lifetime is extended further. These results could be used to promote the design of more durable products, e. g. via more ambitious policy measures. The research also highlighted the relevance of repairability of VCs from both environmental and economic points of view. Repairability could be promoted for instance through a proper ‘design for repairing’ of products but also the availability of information and tools for the repair and/or replacement of some components. Finally, the importance of the role of consumers has been confirmed, in terms of proper use of VCs during their operation phase andJRC. H. 8 -Sustainability Assessmen...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{numerous}} environmental challenges relating to resource extraction, product manufacturing and use and waste treatment, {{the call for}} using materials more sustainably is placed high on the EU agenda. This resulted in {{the publication of the}} Commission’s Circular Economy Package mid- 2015, which offers many proposals to change policy and legislation in view of transforming Europe’s economy into a circular one. The Package highlights amongst others that the Ecodesign Framework Directive is mainly focused on energy-efficiency during the use of electronic devices. While this can be historically and practically justified, the Circular Economy requires a different approach: ultimately, non-energy related impacts occurring throughout the entire product life-cycle should be taken into account in product design of all products. In light of this, the Commission plans to ‘examine options and actions for a more coherent policy framework of the different strands of work of EU product policy in their contribution to the circular economy’ in 2018. Depending on how the implementation of the Circular Economy develops in the EU, {{it may well be that}} the extension of the scope of the Ecodesign Framework Directive to non-energy-related products will be covered by the study. The aim of the presentation is to explore the potential for broadening the Directive’s scope to all products. Wooden products are used as a case study. It is inherent that once the expansion of scope will be studied considering wooden products, the non-energy-related <b>ecodesign</b> <b>requirements</b> would be automatically emphasized because the currently applicable Ecodesign Framework Directive does not yet regulate wooden products at all. The methodological steps taken in the study/presentation are as follows: 1) to identify the legal basis in the Ecodesign Framework Directive and in all other relevant to regulate material-related impacts in product design (the measures studied in the survey being the EU Timber Regulation, REACH, CLP Regulation, Biocidal Products Regulation, Construction Products Regulation, Ecolabel Directive (3 specific Ecolabel criteria), Pubic Procurement Directive (3 specific Green Public Procurement criteria)); 2) to identify additional features that should be taken into account when addressing material-related aspects in product design through the Ecodesign framework, and, in this respect, to learn from the other relevant measures on how they deal with these issues; 3) to study the coherence between the Ecodesign Framework Directive and individual legislation as well as the coherence of the overall legal framework for wooden products in order to look into whether (and how) broadening the Directive’s scope would enhance (or frustrate, fil in gaps…) the coherence of the general framework for wooden products. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The newly {{released}} 'New Circular Economy Package' puts emphasis on resource efficiency through increased recycling, {{as well as}} ecodesign of products to accomplish it. The waste stream of electronic and electronic equipment (WEEE) is increasing and since these types of products contain valuable material the material contained in them should be recycled. The Synergy Approach’ employed in this thesis presents a way of strengthening {{the enforcement of the}} WEEE Directive through the creation of synergies with other policies, especially the Ecodesign Directive. In order to increase the recycling rates, resource efficient pre-processing treatment alternatives need to be made more economically competitive compared to alternatives reaping a lower recycling yield to a corresponding lower cost. Moreover, mechanical treatment options must also become more applicable, raising the productivity of the pre-processing and making the operations more profitable. Hence, the product policies on EEE should be aiming at enabling these two waste treatment approaches in order to create synergy and, through that, support increased recycling of WEEE. The RoHS Directive is regulating ten hazardous substances in EEE, which is facilitating the recycling. While the Ecodesign Directive {{ought to be able to}} set product requirements aiming at facilitating the recycling, through for example the choice of materials and the ease of dismantling, this has not been done with regards to the absolute majority of the regulated product categories. The main hindrances for setting these types of requirements consist in the fulfillment of the provisions in the Ecodesign Directive on significant environmental impact, potential for significant environmental benefit (due to uncertainties regarding how the waste treatment will look like) and measurability, as well as the possibility of ‘double-regulation’ with the WEEE Directive and the RoHS Directive. For the Ecodesign Directive to be able to set further recyclability requirements changes on a number of levels are required, especially in the process of developing the product-specific <b>ecodesign</b> <b>requirements.</b> Increasing EU policy focus on resource efficiency, the upcoming standardization process and the possibility of obtaining a clear definition of ‘double-regulation’ from the Commission are some of the identified enablers past the hindrances. However, the uncertain waste treatment remains an issue receiving limited attention in the analyzed judicial doctrine. Therefore, some strategies on how this uncertainty can be dealt with has been proposed, both within the context of the Ecodesign Directive as well as outside. The most efficient approach to create synergy, and to overcome the hindrance in the form of uncertain environmental benefit from the design requirement, seems to consist in regulation of the design features in the Ecodesign Directive, together with correlating regulation of the waste treatments in the WEEE Directive...|$|R
40|$|Appliance energy {{efficiency}} standards and labeling (S&L) {{programs have been}} important policy tools for regulating the efficiency of energy-using products for over 40 years and continue to expand in terms of geographic and product coverage. The most common S&L programs include mandatory minimum energy performance standards (MEPS) that seek to push the market for efficient products, and energy information and endorsement labels that seek to pull the market. This study seeks to review and compare {{some of the earliest}} and most well-developed S&L programs in three countries and one region: the U. S. MEPS and ENERGY STAR, Australia MEPS and Energy Label, European Union MEPS and <b>Ecodesign</b> <b>requirements</b> and Energy Label and Japanese Top Runner programs. For each program, key elements of S&L programs are evaluated and comparative analyses across the programs undertaken to identify best practice examples of individual elements as well as cross-cutting factors for success and lessons learned in international S&L program development and implementation. The international review and comparative analysis identified several overarching themes and highlighted some common factors behind successful program elements. First, standard-setting and programmatic implementation can benefit significantly from a legal framework that stipulates a specific timeline or schedule for standard-setting and revision, product coverage and legal sanctions for non-compliance. Second, the different MEPS programs revealed similarities in targeting efficiency gains that are technically feasible and economically justified as the principle for choosing a standard level, in many cases at a level that no product on the current market could reach. Third, detailed survey data such as the U. S. Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS) and rigorous analyses provide a strong foundation for standard-setting while incorporating the participation of different groups of stakeholders further strengthen the process. Fourth, sufficient program resources for program implementation and evaluation are critical to the effectiveness of standards and labeling programs and cost-sharing between national and local governments can help ensure adequate resources and uniform implementation. Lastly, check-testing and punitive measures are important forms of enforcement while the cancellation of registration or product sales-based fines have also proven effective in reducing non-compliance. The international comparative analysis also revealed the differing degree to which the level of government decentralization has influenced S&L programs and while no single country has best practices in all elements of standards and labeling development and implementation, national examples of best practices for specific elements do exist. For example, the U. S. has exemplified the use of rigorous analyses for standard-setting and robust data source with the RECS database while Japan�s Top Runner standard-setting principle has motivated manufacturers to exceed targets. In terms of standards implementation and enforcement, Australia has demonstrated success with enforcement given its long history of check-testing and enforcement initiatives while mandatory information-sharing between EU jurisdictions on compliance results is another important enforcement mechanism. These examples show {{that it is important to}} evaluate not only the drivers of different paths of standards and labeling development, but also the country-specific context for best practice examples in order to understand how and why certain elements of specific S&L programs have been effective...|$|R

40|$|The “Resource Efficiency Assessment of Product- REAPro” {{method has}} been {{developed}} to assess energy related products against a set of resource efficiency criteria, and to identify hot-spots and improvement potentials. The method has been applied and tested to various case-studies as: dishwashers, electronic displays, computers (notebook and tablets) and enterprise servers. These applications allowed to progressively refine the method from a scientifically perspective, but also to link the results to potentially new policy applications, including {{the development of new}} types of workable Ecodesign measures and Ecolabel criteria. The present report summarizes the recent advancements of the REAPro method and the definition of innovative requirements. In particular, novel elements discussed in the report are: -	Analysis of benefits of reused components: The REAPro method only partially addressed the “reusability” concept (i. e. the potential full reuse of products at the EoL). However, it did not address the possibility that only certain key components (i. e. those having the highest residual value) could be collected from waste for the manufacturing of new products. This aspect has been addressed in a new method that allows to identify if, and to what extent, it is environmentally beneficial to reuse certain components for the remanufacturing of products (Chapter 2). In particular, it is observed that a product with reused components can still be environmentally convenient even if it has a higher energy consumption compared to brand-new products. The results of the method could be applied to build novel policy requirements, which allow higher energy efficiency thresholds for products that embody reused components. -	Revision of the assessment of the index on recyclability: based on comments received by stakeholders related to previous case-studies, the index on recyclability benefit rate of the REAPro method has been revised to clearly separate the environmental impacts of the WEEE recycling from the potential credits due to the secondary raw materials produced (Chapter 3). -	Assessment of the disassemblability and dismantlability of key components: design for disassembly of key components has been identified as a crucial aspect for the repair and recycling of the products. JRC has been working on developing suitable and verifiable requirements to assess disassemblability and dismantlability since 2012. These requirements have evolved, thanks to comments and suggestions from different stakeholders, and in particular from Market surveillance authorities of some Member States, which are in charge of verification of requirements. Two different types of requirements are presented and discussed in this report (Chapter 4) : one based on numbers of disassembly steps necessary to disassemble certain components; and other based on criteria to grant the identification, access and extraction of key components for the product’s recycling, including requirements on their fastening and the provision of relevant information for the end-of-life treatments. -	Recyclability of plastics: recycling of plastics {{is one of the biggest}} challenges in the WEEE treatment and is addressed in Chapter 5 of this report. Criticalities in plastic recycling have been analysed. In particular, large number of different polymers, technological barriers for plastic sorting, content of additives (especially flame retardants), difficulties for the extraction of plastic parts, downcycling and low value of secondary materials are among the reasons of very low recycling rates for plastics in WEEE. The reports therefore propose some potential requirements based on plastic marking and provision of information. A novel index on the content of flame retardants in plastic parts is proposed. Together with requirements on dismantlability, these requirements could contribute to improve the recycling of plastics from WEEE. At the time of the report (December 2016) several of the requirements above mentioned have been integrated and discussed in various policy proposals, as the <b>Ecodesign</b> <b>requirements</b> for electronic displays, enterprise servers and commercial refrigerating appliances, and Ecolabel criteria for computers and displays.
