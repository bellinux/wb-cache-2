5|$|In 1952, the {{two couples}} {{discovered}} that Red House {{was up for}} sale, and as architects {{with an interest in}} Morris, they recognised its historic value. By this point, the Red House had been empty for 18 months, after Thomas Hills and his family had left in 1951, and had fallen into a state of dilapidation. Deciding to share the property between themselves, they were able to afford a mortgage {{with the aid of a}} loan from Toms' father-in-law; he only agreed to provide the loan <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> was owned in Toms' name, and thus the Hollambys became Toms' tenants. The two families then moved in with their six children, and a seventh was born soon after. They camped in the house's grounds while carrying out a project of renovation.|$|E

5|$|Once {{passed by}} the Senate, a bill {{is sent to the}} House of Delegates for consideration. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> also approves the bill without amendment, it is sent to the Governor. If there is amendment, however, the Senate may either reconsider the bill with {{amendments}} or ask {{for the establishment of a}} conference committee to work out differences in the versions of the bill passed by each chamber. Once a piece of legislation approved by both houses is forwarded to the Governor, it may either be signed or vetoed. If it is signed, it takes effect on the effective date of the legislation, usually October 1 of that year. If it is vetoed, both the Senate and the House of Delegates must vote by a three-fifths majority to overturn the veto. They may not, however, overturn a veto in the first year of a new term, since the bill would have been passed during the previous session. Additionally, joint resolutions and the budget bill may not be vetoed, although the General Assembly is constitutionally limited in the extent to which it may influence the latter; it may only decrease the Governor's budget proposal, not increase it.|$|E

25|$|Section 3 of the Twentieth Amendment {{specifies}} <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> of Representatives has {{not chosen}} a president-elect {{in time for}} the inauguration (noon EST on January 20), then the vice president-elect becomes acting president until the House selects a president. Section 3 also specifies Congress may statutorily provide for who will be acting president if there is neither a president-elect nor a vice president-elect {{in time for the}} inauguration. Under the Presidential Succession Act of 1947, the Speaker of the House would become acting president until either the House selects a president or the Senate selects a vice president.

In the original Brooklyn Museum installation, there were two bed boxes on the exterior wall of the north room. When the house was moved to its present location in 2006, it was decided that <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> did have a bed box it more logically was on an interior wall next to the hearth as you now will see it.|$|E

25|$|The French Directory was an {{increasingly}} unpopular {{government and the}} Council of Five Hundred and the Council of Ancients had no legal means to restrain the Directory. The Directors Paul François Jean Nicolas, vicomte de Barras, Jean-François Rewbell and Louis Marie de La Révellière-Lépeaux were known as the Triumvirate and held the most power. The other two directors, Lazare Carnot and François-Marie, marquis de Barthélemy {{as well as a}} swelling majority of the Five Hundred and the Ancients were in the opposition which wanted a change in government and a stop to the endless wars. The opposition included both Republicans who wanted better government and avowed Royalists such as Jean-Charles Pichegru and Willot. Unfortunately for the opposition the two factions were not able to coordinate their efforts. Foolishly, the Royalists refused to assure the Republican members of the opposition {{that they would not be}} punished <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> of Bourbon returned.

500|$|Following McCarthy {{dropping}} out of the race on October 8, the caucus vote was indefinitely postponed. Massie and Peter T. King referred to the House as a [...] "banana republic." [...] Massie also criticized Boehner for postponing the election, saying they [...] "called off the election because they didn’t like the result," [...] which was echoed by Tom Rice, Louie Gohmert, and Justin Amash. McMorris Rodgers and Conference Vice Chairwoman Lynn Jenkins defended Boehner, saying the matter was handled properly, as conference rules give him sole discretion. Rich Lowry of National Review asked McCarthy in a phone interview <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> was governable, to which McCarthy replied [...] "I don’t know.

And also I think there's always that allure in American lives of the fresh start, moving West, starting fresh." ...|$|E
500|$|Originally, {{legislative}} power was exercised by the sovereign {{acting on the}} advice of the Curia Regis, or Royal Council, in which important magnates and clerics participated and which evolved into parliament. The so-called Model Parliament included among its members bishops, abbots, earls, barons, and two knights from each shire and two burgesses from each borough. In 1265, the Earl of Leicester irregularly called a full parliament without royal authorisation. The body eventually came to be divided into two branches: bishops, abbots, earls, and barons formed the House of Lords, while the shire and borough representatives formed the House of Commons. The King would seek the advice and consent of both houses before making any law. During Henry VI's reign, it became regular practice for the two houses to originate legislation in the form of bills, which would not become law unless the sovereign's assent was obtained, as the sovereign was, and still remains, the enactor of laws. Hence, all Acts include the clause [...] "Be it enacted by the Queen's (King's) most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows...". The Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949 provide a second potential preamble <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> of Lords were to be excluded from the process.|$|E
