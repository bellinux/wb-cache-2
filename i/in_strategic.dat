40|$|Intuition {{can produce}} {{effective}} strategic decisions {{because of its}} speed and ability to solve less-structured problems. Despite this, {{there are only a}} very small number of empirical studies that have examined intuition <b>in</b> the <b>strategic</b> decision-making process. We examine the relationship between the use of intuition <b>in</b> the <b>strategic</b> decision-making process, and strategic decision effectiveness. We propose that the expertise of the decision-maker, environmental dynamism and the characteristics of the strategic decision itself moderate the relationship between the use of intuition <b>in</b> the <b>strategic</b> decision making process, and strategic decision effectiveness. We make a significant theoretical contribution by integrating the management and social-psychology literatures in order to identify the variables that affect the relationship between the use of intuition <b>in</b> the <b>strategic</b> decision-making process, and strategic decision effectiveness. This article builds upon existing empirical research that has examined intuition <b>in</b> the <b>strategic</b> decision-making process, and reconciles some of the confounding results that have emerged. The paper presents a conceptual model and research propositions, which if empirically examined, would make a significant contribution to knowledge <b>in</b> the <b>strategic</b> decision-making domain of literature...|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} examine the effects of {{management}} control system on performance <b>in</b> a <b>strategic</b> supply relationship through cooperation. The samples of this study were dispensaries that had some criteria i. e. privately owned dispensaries; dispensaries that were not in hospital areas; and dispensaries that transacted at least once a month at the biggest PBF in Bengkulu. Each dispensary has a person who was responsible in purchasing goods and then was involved as the respondent. The number of samples was 52. The data used in this study were primary ones obtained by distributing questionnaires to the respondents. Of the 52 questionnaires distributed, 40 questionnaires could be analyzed. The data obtained were processed by using multiple linear regression with SPSS version 16. The results of this study were: 1) Management control system had no significant effect on performance <b>in</b> a <b>strategic</b> supply relationship. This means that the more or less controlled management of dispensaries did not lead to improved performance <b>in</b> a <b>strategic</b> supply relationship. 2) Management control system had a positive and significant effect on cooperation. This means that the more or less controlled management of dispensaries led to improved cooperation. 3) Cooperation had no significant effect on performance <b>in</b> a <b>strategic</b> supply relationship. This means that a better or worse cooperation in dispensaries led to improved performance <b>in</b> a <b>strategic</b> supply relationship. 4) Management control system had no significant effect on performance <b>in</b> a <b>strategic</b> supply relationship, and cooperation did not mediate (intervening) the system of management control on performance <b>in</b> a <b>strategic</b> supply relationship as in the case of a better or worse cooperation in the dispensaries that did not cause an improvement in management control system toward performance <b>in</b> a <b>strategic</b> supply relationship...|$|R

5|$|The Belgians much {{preferred}} {{an alliance}} with the United Kingdom. The British had entered the First World War {{in response to the}} German violation of Belgian neutrality. The Belgian Channel ports had offered the German Imperial Navy valuable bases, and such an attack would offer the German Kriegsmarine and the Luftwaffe bases to engage <b>in</b> <b>strategic</b> offensive operations against the United Kingdom in the coming conflict. But the British government paid little attention to the concerns of the Belgians. The lack of this commitment ensured the Belgian withdrawal from the Western Alliance, the day before the remilitarisation of the Rhineland. The lack of opposition to the remilitarisation served to convince the Belgians that France and Britain were unwilling to fight for their own strategic interests, let alone Belgium's. The Belgian General Staff was determined to fight for its own interests, alone if necessary.|$|E

5|$|The {{majority}} form of opposition, however, was passive resistance. Small patriotic badges, {{depicting the}} royal family or national colours, were extremely popular. When these symbols were banned, new ones, such as ivy leaves, were worn with similar meaning. Workers <b>in</b> <b>strategic</b> industries deliberately underperformed in their jobs {{as a form of}} resistance. The celebration of nationalist public holidays, like 21 July (National Day), which were officially banned by the Germans, were also often accompanied by protests and demonstrations. One of the most notable acts of passive resistance was the Judges' Strike of 1918, which managed to gain concessions from the German occupiers under considerable public pressure.|$|E

5|$|Yusuf {{has built}} a largely subservient and loyal {{apparatus}} by putting his fellow Majerteen clansmen <b>in</b> <b>strategic</b> positions. The National Security Agency (NSA) under General Mohamed Warsame (“Darwish”) and the so-called “Majerteen militia” units in the TFG army operate in parallel and often above other security agencies. Their exact number is hard to ascertain, but estimates suggest about 2,000. They are well catered for, well armed and often carry out counter-insurgency operations {{with little or no}} coordination with other security agencies. In the short term, this strategy may appear effective for the president, who can unilaterally employ the force essentially as he pleases. However, it undermines morale in the security services and is a cause of their high desertion rates.|$|E
5|$|Egyptian forces {{attempted}} a surprise {{attack on the}} crusaders' camp on 9 October, but John discovered their movements. He and his retinue attacked and annihilated the Egyptian advance guard, hindering the main force. The crusaders built a floating fortress on the Nile near Damietta, but a storm blew it near the Egyptian camp. The Egyptians seized the fortress, killing nearly all of its defenders. Only two soldiers survived the attack; they were accused of cowardice, and John ordered their execution. Taking advantage of the new Italian troops, Cardinal Pelagius began to intervene <b>in</b> <b>strategic</b> decisions. His debates with John angered their troops. The soldiers broke into the Egyptian camp on 29 August 1219 without an order, but they were soon defeated and nearly annihilated. During the ensuing panic, only the cooperation of John, the Templars, the Hospitallers and the noble crusaders prevented the Egyptians from destroying their camp.|$|E
5|$|Like many ex-Army officers, {{he tended}} to see air power in the {{tactical}} role, providing support to land operations. In the historiography of the Luftwaffe Kesselring and Hans-Jürgen Stumpff are usually blamed for neglecting strategic bombing while over-focusing on close air support for the army. However the two most prominent enthusiasts for the focus on ground-support operations (direct or indirect) were actually Hugo Sperrle and Hans Jeschonnek. The two men were long-time professional airmen involved in German air services since their early careers. The Luftwaffe was not pressured into ground support operations due to demands from the army, or because it was led by ex-army personnel like Kesselring. Interdiction and close air support were operations that suited the Luftwaffe's pre-existing approach to warfare; a culture of joint inter-service operations, rather than independent strategic air campaigns. Moreover, many in the Luftwaffe command believed medium bombers to be sufficient in power for use <b>in</b> <b>strategic</b> bombing operations against Germany's most likely enemies; Britain and France.|$|E

5|$|On October29, Honduras President Ricardo Maduro {{declared}} a State of National Emergency as Beta was forecast to bring heavy rains up to 12in (300mm). Three departments, Gracias a Dios, Colon, Olancho and El Paraiso, were placed under Red Alert and mandatory evacuations {{were put in}} place. The departments of Atlántida, Yoro, Comayagua, Francisco Morazán and Choluteca were placed under Yellow Alert and a Green Alert was {{in place for the}} rest of the country. The Local Emergency Management Agency opened its regional and municipal offices to conduct preparative activities. An emergency radio network was set up to alert the public of any emergencies. The government designated several public schools as shelters for the affected population. In the Francisco Morazán Department, the Tegucigalpa Municipal Emergency Committee opened 73 shelters. Extensive cleaning and garbage disposal was conducted, especially around creeks, rivers, and sewers. The National Armed Forces were placed <b>in</b> <b>strategic</b> areas and were on stand-by for search and rescue operations once the storm passed. About 3,306tons (3,000tonnes) of food was reported to be available and local travels in the country were suspended. In Tegucigalpa, the emergency committee called for the evacuation of 125,000 people from the most vulnerable areas of the capital. About 8,000 others were evacuated from 50 communities along the Nicaragua border due to the threat of flooding. A hurricane alert was put in place for areas north of the Nicaragua border but was cancelled on October30 after Beta turned towards the southeast.|$|E
5|$|The Second Samnite War, from 327 BC to 304 BC, was a {{much longer}} and more serious affair for both the Romans and Samnites, running for over twenty years and {{incorporating}} twenty-four battles that led to massive casualties on both sides. The fortunes of the two sides fluctuated throughout its course: the Samnites seized Neapolis in the Capture of Neapolis in 327 BC, which the Romans then re-captured before losing at the Battle of the Caudine Forks and the Battle of Lautulae. The Romans then proved victorious at the Battle of Bovianum and the tide turned strongly against the Samnites from 314 BC onwards, leading them to sue for peace with progressively less generous terms. By 304 BC the Romans had effectively annexed the greater degree of the Samnite territory, founding several colonies. This pattern of meeting aggression in force and so inadvertently gaining territory <b>in</b> <b>strategic</b> counter-attacks {{was to become a}} common feature of Roman military history.|$|E
5|$|The final straw was Henry's {{decision}} {{to give his}} youngest son John three major castles belonging to Young Henry, who first protested and then fled to Paris, followed by his brothers Richard and Geoffrey; Eleanor attempted to join them but was captured by Henry's forces in November. Louis supported Young Henry and war became imminent. Young Henry wrote to the pope, complaining about his father's behaviour, and began to acquire allies, including King William of Scotland and the Counts of Boulogne, Flanders and Blois—all of whom were promised lands if Young Henry won. Major baronial revolts broke out in England, Brittany, Maine, Poitou and Angoulême. In Normandy some of the border barons rose up and, {{although the majority of}} the duchy remained openly loyal, there {{appears to have been a}} wider undercurrent of discontent. Only Anjou proved relatively secure. Despite the size and scope of the crisis, Henry had several advantages, including his control of a large number of powerful royal castles <b>in</b> <b>strategic</b> areas, control of most of the English ports throughout the war, and his continuing popularity within the towns across his empire.|$|E
