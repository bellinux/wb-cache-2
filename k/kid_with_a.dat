25|$|The Villa del Pastore {{dates from}} between the eighth century BC and 79 AD. It {{is divided into two}} parts: a large outdoor area and a series of {{residential}} rooms. The garden area is bordered to the south by the semicircular wall, while on the north is a 140m long cryptoporticus which runs parallel to a colonnade on a slightly lower level. At the centre of the garden is a swimming pool (natatio) with marble staircase. In the centre of the semicircular alcove was found the statue that gives the villa its name, of marble, 65cm tall in Hellenistic style and is an old shepherd dressed in hides, carrying on his shoulders a <b>kid,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> basket with grapes and bread on his left hand while in the right hand is a hare.

[...] Turan of the Los Angeles Times criticized that the film [...] "telegraphs its plot"; however, he praised it as [...] "genuinely sweet and determinedly inspirational." [...] PopMatterss Cynthia Fuchs stated it is formulaic as it has some [...] "conventions that make so many other genre films feel stale," [...] but that it [...] "torques them slightly", emphasizing the [...] "intellectual activities" [...] Akeelah gets involved with. Furthermore, the film was described as [...] "derivatively entertaining in a feel-good sort of way" [...] by Rick Groen in an article for The Globe and Mail. Ingman of The Austin Chronicle {{described it as a}} typical sports film and felt it was heavy-handed at times. However, she praised it for its thems and called the film a [...] "houghtful, engaging," [...] one and said it has [...] "cross-gender appeal". Morris of The Boston Globe argued, [...] "If Akeelah and the Bee is a generic, well-oiled commercial contraption, it is the first to credibly dramatize the plight of a truly gifted, poor black child."

He scored 18 goals in 29 league appearances for Bournemouth. West Ham manager Harry Redknapp tipped him for stardom, saying, [...] "He's done great.

In February 1966, both Parks and Wilson reconnected at a lawn party thrown by Terry Melcher. In Wilson's mostly ghostwritten 1993 autobiography, {{it was said that}} his first impressions of Parks was [...] "a skinny <b>kid</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> unique perspective" [...] and that he [...] "had a fondness for amphetamines" [...] at the time. Parks hesitantly confirmed this, but added, [...] "Those were his amphetamines. They were in his medicine cabinet. I'd never had amphetamines. I was working for Brian Wilson at 3:30 AM when he wanted to have his amphetamines." [...] It was also Parks who introduced Wilson to Beatles publicist Derek Taylor, who later became the Beach Boys' publicist for some time during the 1960s.|$|E
2500|$|Obama noted his interracial and {{international}} heritage: {{he was born}} in Honolulu, Hawaii to a Kenyan immigrant father and a white mother from Kansas.

[...] He went on to describe his successful career in law and politics while raising a family in Chicago. [...] "In no other country on Earth is my story even possible," [...] Obama proclaimed. Towards the end of his speech, he emphasized the importance of hope in the American saga, and he illustrated how that hope manifested itself in the lives of John Kerry, John Edwards, and even his own personal life, as [...] "a skinny <b>kid</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> funny name who believes that America has a place for him too." [...] According to Obama, the [...] "audacity of hope" [...] is [...] "God's greatest gift" [...] to Americans, allowing him to feel optimistic that the lives of average Americans can be improved with the right governmental policies. Following the speech political commentator Chris Matthews rightly predicted [...] "I just saw the first black president".|$|E
2500|$|The Dardenne {{brothers}} have a regular stable of collaborators (for {{all of their}} films the brothers share writing and directing credits), including cinematographer Alain Marcoen and editor Marie-Hélène Dozo. Jérémie Renier played Igor in La Promesse, Bruno in L’Enfant, Claudy in Le Silence de Lorna (Lorna's Silence) and Guy in Le gamin au vélo (The <b>Kid</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> Bike), while Olivier Gourmet, the main character of Le fils, has a brief cameo as a detective in L’Enfant. Like Rosettas Emilie Dequenne, Déborah François, the seventeen-year-old lead in L’Enfant, was appearing in her first film. Luc Dardenne has described their process of working with actors as follows: [...] "What {{we do with the}} actors is also very physical. The day filming begins we do not feel obliged to do things exactly the way they were rehearsed; we pretend that we are starting over from zero so that we can rediscover things that we did before. The instructions we give the actors are above all physical. We start working without the cameraman—just the actors and my brother and me. We walk them through the blocking, first one then the other, trying several different versions. They say but do not act their lines. We do not tell them what the tone of their lines should be; we just say that we will see once the camera is rolling. At this point there is no cameraman, no sound engineer, no lighting. Then we set up all the camera movements exactly and the rhythm of the shot, which is usually a long take. Doing it this way allows us the ability to modify the actors’ movements or any small details." ...|$|E

2500|$|As with season one, {{the writing}} team {{came up with}} more [...] "what if" [...] episodes for the series, like season two's [...] "Visitor", which came from the idea of, [...] "what if someone showed up and Clark began {{to believe that he}} wasn't the last person from his planet." [...] In the case of [...] "Nocturne", [...] "what if Clark had been brought up by {{different}} parents?" [...] With [...] "Nocturne", the episode is meant to be [...] "an extreme version of the Clark story". As Gough explains, [...] "Here's a <b>kid</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> condition, whose parents literally lock him in the basement. It's an extreme parenting episode—contrasting how these parents deal with Byron, and how the Kents deal with Clark." [...] The episode also dealt with Clark's fallibility, in the fact that Clark is only a teenager, and he does not always have all of the facts; just because he thinks he is doing the right thing {{does not necessarily mean that}} he is. In this case, Clark believes that he is saving Byron from his abusive parents. Gough clarifies, [...] "'s doing what he thinks is right, but ultimately unleashes the kid, and [...] causes damage. Just because you have the power and you think you're right doesn't always mean you're taking the right course of action." [...] Another [...] "what if" [...] episode was [...] "Witness", which originally came from the concept, [...] "what if Clark witnessed a crime and had to testify in court as to why he was standing in the middle of the road at 2 o'clock in the morning?" [...] In the end, the court angle was dropped from the storyline, with Clark making an anonymous phone call to the Sheriff and eventually having to battle the three kryptonite powered thieves that he had witnessed stealing.|$|E
