5000|$|In practice, it is {{difficult}} to achieve the full <b>dynamic</b> <b>range</b> experienced by humans using electronic equipment. Electronically reproduced audio and video often uses some trickery to fit original material with a wide <b>dynamic</b> <b>range</b> into a narrower recorded <b>dynamic</b> <b>range</b> that can more easily be stored and reproduced; these techniques are called <b>dynamic</b> <b>range</b> compression. For example, a good quality LCD has a <b>dynamic</b> <b>range</b> of around 1000:1 (commercially the <b>dynamic</b> <b>range</b> is often called the [...] "contrast ratio" [...] meaning the full-on/full-off luminance ratio), and some of the latest CMOS image sensors now have measured <b>dynamic</b> <b>ranges</b> of about 23,000:1 (reported as 14.5 stops, or doublings, equivalent to binary bits).

A professional ENG camcorder such as the Sony Digital Betacam achieves a <b>dynamic</b> <b>range</b> of greater than 90 dB in audio recording.|$|R
40|$|<b>Dynamic</b> <b>range</b> is a {{critical}} figure of merit for image sensors. Often a sensor with higher <b>dynamic</b> <b>range</b> is regarded as higher quality than one with lower <b>dynamic</b> <b>range.</b> For CCD and CMOS sensors operating in the integration mode the sensor SNR monotonically increases with the signal. Therefore, a sensor with higher <b>dynamic</b> <b>range,</b> generally, produces higher quality images than one with lower <b>dynamic</b> <b>range.</b> This, however, {{is not necessarily the}} case when <b>dynamic</b> <b>range</b> enhancement schemes are used. For example, using the well capacity adjusting scheme <b>dynamic</b> <b>range</b> is enhanced but at the expense of substantial degradation in SNR. On the other hand, using multiple sampling <b>dynamic</b> <b>range</b> can be enhanced without degrading SNR. Therefore, even if both schemes achieve the same <b>dynamic</b> <b>range</b> the latter can produce higher image quality than the former. The paper provides a quantitative framework for comparing SNR for image sensors with enhanced <b>dynamic</b> <b>range.</b> We introduce a simple model to describe the sensor output response {{as a function of the}} photogenerated signal, dark signal, and noise for sensors operating in integration mode with and without <b>dynamic</b> <b>range</b> enhancement schemes.

40|$|The {{capability}} of neurons {{to discriminate between}} intensity of external stimulus is measured by its <b>dynamic</b> <b>range.</b> A larger <b>dynamic</b> <b>range</b> indicates a greater probability of neuronal survival. In this study, the potential roles of adaptation mechanisms (ion currents) in modulating neuronal <b>dynamic</b> <b>range</b> were numerically investigated. Based on the adaptive exponential integrate-and-fire model, which includes two different adaptation mechanisms, i. e. subthreshold and suprathreshold (spike-triggered) adaptation, our results reveal that the two adaptation mechanisms exhibit rather different roles in regulating neuronal <b>dynamic</b> <b>range.</b> Specifically, subthreshold adaptation acts as a negative factor that observably decreases the neuronal <b>dynamic</b> <b>range,</b> while suprathreshold adaptation has little influence on the neuronal <b>dynamic</b> <b>range.</b> Moreover, when stochastic noise was introduced into the adaptation mechanisms, the <b>dynamic</b> <b>range</b> was apparently enhanced, regardless of what state the neuron was in, e. g. adaptive or non-adaptive. Our model results suggested that the neuronal <b>dynamic</b> <b>range</b> can be differentially modulated by different adaptation mechanisms.
