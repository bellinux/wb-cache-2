40|$|Abstract: The aim of {{the paper}} is to show the summary and proof of the Lagrange mean value theorem <b>of</b> a <b>function</b> <b>of</b> n {{variable}}s. Firstly, we review the mean value theorem <b>of</b> a <b>function</b> <b>of</b> one variable and the properties <b>of</b> continuous <b>functions</b> <b>of</b> two variables. According to the geometric consequence of Lagrange mean value theorem <b>of</b> <b>functions</b> <b>of</b> one variable, a Lagrange mean value theorem <b>of</b> <b>functions</b> <b>of</b> two variables is given. We use the method <b>of</b> constructive auxiliary <b>function</b> to prove the theorem. Moreover, the theorem is illustrated with one example. Finally, the theroems about <b>functions</b> <b>of</b> n variables are generalized to <b>functions</b> <b>of</b> n variables. Key words: <b>function</b> <b>of</b> n variables; Lagrange mean value theorem; continuity; differentiability. n 元函数的拉格朗日中值定...|$|R
