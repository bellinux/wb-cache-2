40|$|The Eurosystem {{has been}} {{pursuing}} a crisis management policy {{for more than}} four years now. This policy aims primarily at maintaining financial stability in the euro area by providing vast liquidity support to commercial banks that are operating in nationally segmented banking systems. As a side effect, the national central banks substitute money market operations for cross-border capital flows. The national central banks are thus increasingly engaging in substantial balance-of-payments financing, and financial risks are being shifted from investors to <b>European</b> <b>taxpayers</b> via the Eurosystem. Symptomatically, this shows up in exploding TARGET 2 positions in the national central banks' balance sheets. The longer this process continues, the stronger the centrifugal forces become that ultimately might break up the single currency. Instead of a fiscal union, a euro-area-wide regulatory approach is required. In addition to establishing a uniform scheme for banking regulation, supervision and resolution, we recommend that contingent convertible bonds (CoCos) be introduced to provide a major source of refinancing for the banking industry.

40|$|After the {{subprime}} credit crisis of 2007, {{the world is}} no longer what we thought. An unprecedented crisis of confidence was combined with a credit crunch, and the G 20 countries had to enact massive public spending programs to save the economy and at least buffer the inevitable hard landing. American and <b>European</b> <b>taxpayers</b> paid most {{of the cost of}} the crisis, and moral hazard has not yet been eliminated. Excessive public spending boosted sovereign debt and financial markets became suspicious with weak countries. Greece reported that in 2009 it had run into an unprecedented deficit of 15. 4 % of GDP, and that its public debt had skyrocketed to 126. 8 % (Table 1). The Greek crisis is the product of years of recession, sluggish economic environment and poor productivity, but above all it is the product of the mismanagement of the public finances and unsatisfactory reporting and accounting practices. Greece entered the European Monetary Union (EMU) in 2003, but deliberately carried out a series of financial operations that were not properly reported. Aim of these operations was to match the European budget criteria. A comprehensive EU report on this issue (EU, 2010) uses harsh terms to describe the conduct of the Greek authorities—‘deliberate misreporting’, ‘methodological problems’, ‘unsatisfactory technical procedures in the Greek statistical institute’, ‘inappropriate governance’, ‘poor cooperation and lack of clear responsibilities’.

These fictitious jobs would constitute €7.5 million in losses for <b>European</b> <b>taxpayers</b> from the period 2010 to 2016. The European Anti-fraud Office (...) pursued the case, establishing that one of Le Pen's parliamentary assistants, Catherine Griset, never secured a lease in Brussels during the five years she was employed and only rarely appeared in the European Parliament, while another, Thierry Légier, worked as a bodyguard at the same time. Though the European Parliament demanded that Le Pen return €298,392 by 31 January 2018, representing the salary [...] "unduly paid" [...] to Griset, she refused to do so, and the European Parliament began to reduce her salary to reclaim the money.

You really do need a guide to get through it all. The world has been done a very great service by the European Citizen s Advisory Service in their seventh edition of the guide to our money as <b>European</b> <b>taxpayers</b> rightly call it. The guide explains the structure of the European Commission and related bodies, with an obvious desire to simplify and clarify that has not always been emulated by the bodies themselves. Importantly, it takes into account the recent streamlining and transparency reforms made by the Commission in early 2001. For potential users in ACP countries, the guide explains which funds may be used, how, and for how much, by civil society, private sector and public bodies. It also provides an insight into what is available for European bodies to mobilise as co-funding for projects in ACP countries. The procedures for obtaining and accounting for funds - sometimes surprisingly simple, other times arcane are explained. The tireless and very understanding compilers must find that this is a lifetime s work, like painting a big railway bridge. A shame that they did not find the time to fully remind applicants of the disappointments experienced by many civil society organisations who have been awarded a grant, and then had to wait several years for the first payment to arrive.

500|$|Critics {{such as the}} {{director}} of LSE's Hellenic Observatory argue that the billions of taxpayer euros are not saving Greece but financial institutions. Of all €252bn in bailouts between 2010 and 2015, just 10% has found its way into financing continued public deficit spending on the Greek government accounts. Much of the rest went straight into refinancing the old stock of Greek government debt (originating mainly from the high general government deficits being run in previous years), which was mainly held by private banks and hedge funds by the end of 2009. According to LSE, [...] "more than 80 % of the rescue package" [...] is going to refinance the expensive old maturing Greek government debt towards private creditors (mainly private banks outside Greece), replacing it with new debt to public creditors on more favourable terms, that is to say paying out their private creditors with new debt issued by its new group of public creditors known as the Troika. The shift in liabilities from European banks to <b>European</b> <b>taxpayers</b> has been staggering. One study found that the public debt of Greece to foreign governments, including debt to the EU/IMF loan facility and debt through the Eurosystem, increased from €47.8bn to €180.5bn (+132,7bn) between January 2010 and September 2011, while the combined exposure of foreign banks to (public and private) Greek entities was reduced from well over €200bn in 2009 to around €80bn (−120bn) by mid-February 2012. , 78% of Greek debt is owed to public sector institutions, primarily the EU. According {{to a study by the}} European School of Management and Technology only €9.7bn or less than 5% of the first two bailout programs went to the Greek fiscal budget, while most of the money went to French and German banks. (In June 2010, France's and Germany's foreign claims vis-a-vis Greece were $57bn and $31bn respectively. German banks owned $60bn of Greek, Portuguese, Irish and Spanish government debt and $151bn of banks' debt of these countries.) According to a leaked document, dated May 2010, the IMF was fully aware of the fact that the Greek bailout program was aimed at rescuing the private European banks – mainly from France and Germany. A number of IMF Executive Board members from India, Brazil, Argentina, Russia, and Switzerland criticized this in an internal memorandum, pointing out that Greek debt would be unsustainable. However their French, German and Dutch colleagues refused to reduce the Greek debt or to make (their) private banks pay.|$|R
40|$|Trade, {{especially}} the international variety, rarely {{brings out the}} best in people. Competition can be savage and when economic survival is at stake, slashing prices will work better than even the most creative advertising. It s an ugly rough-and-tumble and one of the not-pretty sights is the loss of solidarity between nations. The European Union recently announced the removal of all import quotas and duties on products from the world s 48 Least-Developed Countries (most LDCs are ACP States). The measure went into effect on 9 March 2001, in an orgy of praise in Europe at least, but it seems to be far from world-shattering. Most LDCs already benefited from duty-free access on most goods, and preferential quotas on key produce such as bananas. In 1998, the total value of EU duties on goods from all LDCs amounted to a mere 7 million most of it on a handful of temperate agricultural products. These are principally maize, some cheese, beef, bananas, rice and sugar and sugar derivatives, and the current suppliers, mainly in ACP States, are none happy about competition from other LDCs, in the ACP Group or elsewhere. Whether those 7 million savings will lead to lower shop prices, more demand and eventually get back to the farmer-producer will depend on who runs the supply chain. Without a doubt, some products from some countries are now more competitive for the European market. But the not so simple minds will ask, as the World Trade Organisation is abolishing all import duties anyway, why all the fuss? Whatever. The real value of the decision is in its knock-on effects, the so-called dynamic impact. It is hoped that some LDC exports will be so energised by the new opportunities to sell on the EU market that they will produce and sell more, and spill over into the North American market which also recently lowered its tariffs for LDCs. Not, though, without some serious investment in some LDCs capacity to deliver: Madagascar s beef exporters, for example, now stand before an open door, with no herds available to sell. And not, though, before a cacophony of grumbles from pre-March 9 preferred suppliers, whether they be the ubiquitous banana growers, the sugar growers in small ACP island States or Europe, or ACP rice growers. The liberalisation of these three product groups is being taken more gently, aiming at free access by 2006, 2009 and 2009 respectively. But beyond the growls and the vicious back-biting even between ACP States, the real lesson is that in trade, you have to think ahead to get ahead.

40|$|We {{propose the}} {{creation}} of “Trichet Bonds” as a comprehensive solution to the current sovereign debt crisis in the EU area. “Trichet Bonds,” to be named after the ECB president Jean-Claude Trichet, will be similar to “Brady Bonds” that resolved the Latin American debt crisis in the late 1980 s and were named after the then Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady. Like the Brady Bonds, Trichet Bonds will be new long-duration bonds issued by countries in the EU area that will be collateralized by zero-coupon bonds of the same duration issued by the ECB. The zero-coupon bonds will be sold by the ECB to the countries issuing Trichet Bonds, which will be offered in exchange for outstanding sovereign debt of the countries. The exchange is offered at market value, so current debt holders will experience a “haircut” from par value, and thus the exchange does not involve a “bailout. ” However, present holders of sovereign debt will be exchanging low quality bonds with limited liquidity, for higher quality bonds with greater liquidity. Debt holders not accepting the exchange will be at risk of a forced restructuring {{at a later date}} at terms less favorable. The effect of the exchange offer, if a threshold of approximately 70 % approve it, is to replace old debt with a lesser amount of new debt with longer maturities. The creation of Trichet bonds will result in various advantages both in comparison to the present unstable situation and other proposed solutions. First, the long duration of Trichet bonds will eliminate the immediate crisis caused by short term expiration of significant amounts of debt which is looming over Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Spain and possibly other EU countries. Second, the guarantee of the principal with the zero-coupon ECD bond collateral increases the quality of the Trichet Bonds compared to existing sovereign debt. Third, the market for the new Trichet Bonds will be liquid and likely to trade at appreciating prices as refinancing (roll-over) risk is reduced and time is allowed for economic reforms by the issuing countries (a condition of the ECB) to take effect. In addition, the exchange of existing sovereign debt for Trichet bonds will force many European banks holding the sovereign debt to take the write-offs required, thus making their own balance sheets more transparent. Many European banks are thought to have large holdings of sovereign debt from the “peripheral” countries that have not been marked-to-market, and thus represent sizeable potential losses for the banks when the sovereign debt is ultimately restructured, as we believe it must be over the next few years. Most of the sovereign bank debt likely to be exchanged, however, is held by larger German, French and Swiss banks with the capability (if not necessarily the desire) to take the write-offs required. The overhang of such future losses affects the entire European banking system {{at a time when it}} too is being restructured. The ECB, and the European central banks need to identify those banks that are impaired by excessive sovereign holdings and assist them in recapitalization – the sooner the better – but they should also push the larger, stronger banks to accept the exchange offers in the interest of bank transparency and restructuring as well as in resolving the sovereign debt problem. Clearly the two problems – sovereign debt and bank restructuring – are connected. The issuance of Trichet Bonds, will help to resolve both problems by recognizing market realities and offering an easier way out than through a forced, cram-down restructuring once the ailing sovereigns exhaust their ability to repay the existing debt. There are significant advantages to Trichet bonds over other discussed solutions to the sovereign debt problem. One such proposed solution is the issuance of “Euro Bonds” guaranteed by the Eurozone countries or the EU itself for the purpose of redeeming sovereign bonds by market purchases, or by lending the proceeds to the countries involved for them to acquire their debt. Apart from the considerable political obstacles to such a program, the undertaking actually makes it less likely that existing self-interested debt-holders will sell in the market. The implication of the program is that either through market interventions that push prices up, or by the assumption that the program will continue to enable the debt to be retired at par on maturity, debt-holders won’t sell unless the price is pushed high enough to constitute a bailout. The ECB’s current efforts to support the prices of distressed sovereign bonds is currently having this effect, which transfers some, if not all of the cost of resolving the problem to <b>European</b> <b>taxpayers,</b> where increasingly it is resented. The alternative approach, that has only been discussed by market participants, is for a Russian or Argentine solution in which the debt-holders are made a take-it-or-leave-it offer to exchange outstanding debt for new, generally illiquid bonds at an arbitrary price that discourages future investment by the market. Such an approach is understood by the sovereign debt market to constitute a de facto default. Such a default would likely have serious adverse consequences for the Euro and the EU, and may be less likely that a bailout of some kind. The great advantage of Trichet Bonds is that they avoid both bailouts and defaults.
