5|$|Adrenal <b>insufficiency</b> (the {{deficiency}} of glucocorticoids) occurs in about 5 in 10,000 {{in the general}} population. Diseases classified as primary adrenal <b>insufficiency</b> (including Addison's disease and genetic causes) directly affect the adrenal cortex. If a problem that affects the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis arises outside the gland, it is a secondary adrenal <b>insufficiency.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{secondary}} adrenal <b>insufficiency,</b> a dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis {{leads to}} decreased {{stimulation of the}} adrenal cortex. Apart from suppression of the axis by glucocorticoid therapy, {{the most common cause}} of secondary adrenal <b>insufficiency</b> are tumors that affect the production of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) by the pituitary gland. This type of adrenal <b>insufficiency</b> usually does not affect the production of mineralocorticoids, which are under regulation of the renin-angiotensin system instead.|$|E

40|$|Context: Although {{dozens of}} {{individual}} mechanical and functional <b>insufficiencies</b> {{have been reported}} in those with chronic ankle instability (CAI), no authors to date have examined the relationship of the <b>insufficiencies</b> to each other.

40|$|The problem under {{investigation}} {{in this study}} is teachers' lack of competence to teach for conceptual understanding of mathematics. It was assumed in this study that pre-service teachers of mathematics go through their teacher education and training with certain <b>insufficiencies</b> in their mathematical understandings and that these <b>insufficiencies</b> will eventually affect the way they teach. The aim of this study, therefore, was to identify what these <b>insufficiencies</b> might be by examining mathematical knowledge that secondary preservice mathematics teachers bring with them to teacher education programs. The nature of these mathematical knowledge <b>insufficiencies</b> and how these <b>insufficiencies</b> would affect a person's competence to teach were of primary interest. To explore these knowledge <b>insufficiencies,</b> a multiple-case study design was used. The nineteen cases (secondary mathematics pre-service teachers) from four universities at two Australian states were selected according to their mathematical backgrounds. It was expected that the pre-service teacher participants (university graduates) who majored in mathematics or in other science related areas would show less evidence of knowledge <b>insufficiencies</b> than pre-service teachers who majored in other areas (e. g. economics). Furthermore, it was expected that the participants with mathematics major backgrounds would show more confidence to teach for conceptual understanding of mathematics than participants with mathematics minor backgrounds. The data collection instrument was a set of three mathematical stimulus items representing trigonometry, logarithm, and statistics. All three items were designed to elicit responses associated with the respondent's knowledge of the mathematics. Written and verbal responses to these items were collected in one-to-one interviews. Skemp's (1978) model of mathematical understanding was the instrument for data analysis. The results of this qualitative analysis indicated four types of mathematical knowledge deficiencies. In addition, the pre-service teachers' existing mathematical knowledge was highly representative of instrumental understanding of mathematics. These mathematical knowledge <b>insufficiencies</b> were suggested to be the outcomes of learning mathematical content which lacked in essential knowledge aspects, rather than outcomes of rote learning. Furthermore, these <b>insufficiencies</b> tended to reduce the pre-service teachers' confidence and likewise their potential to teach for conceptual understanding of mathematics...|$|R

5|$|Venous <b>insufficiency</b> {{results when}} the vein dilates {{secondary}} to a vein wall disease or when normal {{functioning of the}} valves, which serve to keep blood flowing to the heart and to prevent reflux, become damaged and/or incompetent (the dilation of a vein will prevent valves to close properly). This incompetence will result in an reversed blood flow through the affected vein or veins. In varicose veins the valves are damaged, disfunction or missing and the <b>insufficiency</b> will be chronic. The reversed blood pools in the low third of legs and feet.|$|E
40|$|This survey paper {{examines}} various information <b>insufficiencies</b> in biodiversity {{conservation and}} their impact of regulatory choices. We surveyed the literature {{in the field and}} identified four major types of informational <b>insufficiencies</b> in making efficient biodiversity conservation decisions: 1) biological uncertainty 2) natural uncertainty 3) individual information, and 4) monitoring problem. The consequences of these four types of information <b>insufficiencies</b> on the choice of regulatory tools are explored. We discuss in this context three types of regulatory tools: land takings, environmental fees/charges, and contracts. The efficiency of each type of regulatory tools is shown dependent on the specific informational constraints that the regulatory faces. Biodiversity conservation, Information, Regulatory tools...|$|R

30|$|As {{educational}} linguistic researchers, we seek {{to explore}} the relations between language, society, knowledge and education. This current volume appeals to us since its efforts coincide with our research interest. It addresses two weaknesses commonly found in research into education and society: knowledge blindness and segmentalism. Part I demonstrates reflexively how LCT as an explanatory framework {{could be applied to}} overcome segmentalism. Part II applies LCT to six studies through uncovering the underlying principles of knowledge practice. Part III includes an architectural glossary. We conclude by discussing the strengths and <b>insufficiencies</b> of the volume. Despite the <b>insufficiencies,</b> this volume will prove to be a lasting inspiration for readers of different fields.|$|R
5|$|The {{procedure}} requested, for {{an investigation}} into the hemodynamic changes in a patient with chronic venous <b>insufficiency,</b> which results in chronic venous disease, is quite different from an examination request made for suspected deep vein thrombosis. For a DVT investigation {{there is a need for}} guidance as to what to look for and to the intended treatment. An investigation performed with the intention of treating the patient by vein stripping or laser therapy for example is very different from the examination performed with the intention of executing a CHIVA. This French originated procedure is also spelt out as conservative hemodynamic treatment for chronic venous <b>insufficiency.</b> A CHIVA is an ultrasound guided, minimally invasive surgery strategic for the treatment of varicose veins, performed under local anaesthetic.|$|E

40|$|A newly {{developed}} instrumented knee laxity tester {{was used to}} measure anteroposterior (AP) drawer parameters (Lachmann test) in populations of normal subjects and patients with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) <b>insufficiencies.</b> The AP drawer tester features a differential electronic measuring procedure of displacements between patella and tuberosity over a continuous range between 180 and - 180 N of AP forces. In the statistical evaluation, shift and compliance (or stiffness) parameters at various forces are considered. In a representative normal population, all relevant parameters were established, thus creating a normal data base for future reference. The average normal AP drawer shift between maximal anterior and posterior forces (180 N) was 6. 4 +/- 1. 7 mm. Right-left differences and male-female differences were found not to be statistically significant in any of the parameters. The validity of the instrumented drawer tester was confirmed relative to a group of patients with acute documented ligament <b>insufficiencies.</b> Measurements in two groups of patients with chronic postoperative knee instabilities revealed that although the diagnosis of instability could be confirmed, the results could hardly discriminate between ACL and PCL <b>insufficiencies,</b> probably due to unrecognized associated lesions at the time of operation and/or gradual postoperative developments of <b>insufficiencies</b> and deformities. An unexpected finding was that the mean laxities of the uninjured contralateral knees were significantly extended relative to the normal reference group, suggesting that these patients could have been classified as a high-risk group even before the time of injury.

5|$|If the TSH {{level is}} normal or low and serum free T4 levels are low, this is suggestive of central {{hypothyroidism}} (not enough TSH or TRH secretion by the pituitary gland or hypothalamus).
