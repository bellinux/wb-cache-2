40|$|Abstract In {{spite of}} the {{considerable}} amount of experimental, clinical and epidemiological research about the consumption of red meat, total fats, saturated/unsaturated fatty acids and cholesterol {{with regard to the}} risk of developing colorectal cancer (CRC), the issue remains controversial. The general belief is a reduction of red meat intake, and subsequent nutritional advice usually strongly recommends this. Paradoxically, beef together with whole milk and dairy derivatives, are almost the only sources for conjugated linoleic acid (CLAs) family. Furthermore CLAs are the only natural fatty acids accepted by the National Academy of Sciences of USA as exhibiting consistent antitumor properties at levels as low as 0. 25 – 1. 0 per cent of total fats. Beside CLA, other polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) belonging to the essential fatty acid (EFA) n- 3 family, whose main source are fish and seafood, are generally believed to be antipromoters for several cancers. The purpose of this work is to critically analyze the epidemiological and experimental evidence by tentatively assuming that the reciprocal proportions of saturated fats (SA) plus cholesterol (CH) versus CLAs levels in fatty or lean beef may play an antagonistic role underlying the contradictory effects reported for red meats consumption and CRC risk. Recent results about meat intake and risk for CRC in Argentina have shown an unexpected dual behaviour related to the type of meats. Fatty meat derivatives, such as cold cuts and sausages, mainly prepared from fatty beef (up to 37 % fat) were associated with higher risk, whereas high consumption of lean beef (< 15 % fat) behaved as a protective dietary habit. CLA is located in the <b>interstitial,</b> non-visible, <b>fat</b> evenly distributed along muscle fibres as well as in subcutaneous depots. Visible fat may be easily discarded during the meal, whereas <b>interstitial</b> <b>fats</b> will be eaten. The remaining intramuscular fat in lean meats range from 25 to 50 g/Kg (2. 5 to 5 %). The proportion of CLA/SA+CH for lean beef eaters is 0. 09 and the fatty mets 0. 007 (g/ 100 g). As a consequence, the beneficial effects of minor amounts of CLA may be relatively enhanced in lean meat compared to fatty meat sub-products which contain a substantial amount of saturated fatty acids and cholesterol, as in cold cuts and cow viscera. </p...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAge-related {{sarcopenia}} is a {{major health}} issue. To improve elderly person quality of life, {{it is important to}} characterize age-associated structural changes within the skeletal muscle. NMR imaging offers quantitative tools to monitor these changes. We scanned 93 subjects: 33 young adults aged between 19 and 27 years old and 60 older adults between 69 and 80 years old. Their physical activity was assessed using a tri-axial accelerometer and they were classified either as active or sedentary. A standard multi-slice multi-echo (MSME) sequence was run and water T 2 maps were extracted using a tri-exponential fit. Fat fraction was quantified using three-point Dixon technique. Each quadriceps muscle was characterized by: water T 2 mean value, water T 2 heterogeneity and the mean fat fraction. Statistical analysis (ANOVA) showed that water T 2 mean values and its heterogeneity indices as well as fat fraction were significantly higher in the elderly group (p< 0. 05). Only fat fraction was significantly lower in the active group compared to the sedentary one (p< 0. 05). Linear regression confirmed the significant impact of age on these NMR parameters whereas physical activity impact was not systematic. NMR imaging provided a comprehensive assessment of the aging process impact on skeletal muscle composition. Water T 2 increase might be related to changes in fiber typology while increased T 2 heterogeneities might correlate with some degree of tissue disorganization, like the development of <b>interstitial</b> fibrosis. <b>Fat</b> fraction and water T 2 heterogeneity increase was partly slowed down by physical activity.

40|$|T HE CONCEPT {{that the}} “active protoplasmic mass ” {{of the body}} is far {{superior}} to body weight as a parameter of physiological activity has been demonstrated time and again in the past. Keys and Brozek (I) have defined the metabolically “active mass ” of the body as the gross mass less the extracellular fluid, the mineral matter of bones, and all depot fat, including <b>interstitial</b> <b>fat</b> and fat depots. Behnke (2), working with human subjects, concluded that variation in basal metabolic rate caused by age and sex was due to the variation in the depot fat content of the body and that oxygen consumption per unit of lean body mass was constant. Similar findings were reported by Miller (3) and Gopalan (4). In studies of electrolyte metabolism, exchangeable potas-sium per kilogram of body weight was found to be lower in women (5) than in men (6, 7). However, when total exchange...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} a {{standardized}} 46 week chronic drinking water toxicity protocol {{was used to}} elucidate the toxic potential of Sutherlandia frutescens (S. frutescens) using histopathologic, morphometric and transmission electron microscopic analysis. The histopathologic changes in the duodenum, heart, kidney, liver, lung, pancreas and spleen of male Wistar rats were evaluated. Fifty-four rats were randomly divided into four groups: Group 1 – Normal diet control (ND control), n= 7, Group 2 – Normal diet + plant extract (ND + p), n= 9, Group 3 – High fat diet control (HFD control), n= 19 Group 4 – High fat diet + p (HFD + p), n= 19 In the high fat group male Wistar rats were fed ± 55 g/day of a specialised high fat diet over a 46 week period to induce obesity and an insulin resistant state. The treatment groups (groups 2 and 4) received a dose concentration of a tea extract of the S. frutescens plant in their drinking water daily. This study showed that the consumption of S. frutescens significantly reduces weight gain in male Wistar rats on a chronic high fat diet (p≤ 0. 001 vs. HFD control group). S. frutescens appears to propagate periportal and centrilobular glycogen storage in rat hepatocytes in the experimental groups as exemplified by a significantly (p≤ 0. 0001 vs. control groups) increased incidences of Periodic Acid Schiff (PAS) positive staining S. frutescens also reduced intracellular lipid accumulation as made evident by the significantly lower incidence of epicardial adipose tissue (EAT), hepatic steatosis and pancreatic <b>interstitial</b> <b>fat.</b> Obesity was associated with increased fibrotic lesions such as myocardial perivascular fibrosis, centrilobular hepatic fibrosis and pancreatic periductal fibrosis. Obesity associated hypertension contributed to the widespread and {{significant increase in the}} average lesion severity of arterial congestion in all organs in the HFD control group. Pulmonary infection was equally prevalent in all rats. Despite the complex histopathology in all groups, differences in the control groups, such as, the presence of a conservative polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMNL) infiltration, substantial intra-alveolar oedema and focal arterial wall hypertrophy in the control groups was highly suggestive of Sendai viral infection. However histopathologic evidence, in the treatment groups, suggested chronic recurrent viral infection with superimposed Mycoplasma pulmonis (M. pulmonis) bacterial infection. The impact of advanced suppurative pulmonary infection was widespread and exemplified by increased lesion incidences of spontaneous murine progressive cardiomyopathy (MCP) and spontaneous chronic progressive nephropathy (CPN) among others. In conclusion S. frutescens administered for 46 weeks to male Wistar rats significantly lowered intracellular lipid accumulation and obesity associated myocardial, renal, hepatobiliary, pulmonary and pancreatic histopathology. Moreover, duodenal, cardiovascular, hepatobiliary, pulmonary, renal, pancreatic and splenic tissue did not show histopathologic evidence of direct plant extract associated toxicity or carcinogenicity...|$|E
40|$|An {{international}} symposium held in Atlanta, USA {{provided a}} clinically based classification system for acute pancreatitis (AP). 1 AP {{is defined as}} an acute inflammatory process of the pancreas that may involve peripancreatic tissues and/or remote organ systems. AP is a multisystem disease when it is severe. The onset is often rapid accompanied by upper abdominal pain, associated with mild tenderness to rebound based on severity. Vomiting, fever, tachycardia, leukocytosis, elevated amylase and lipase in the serum are other findings. Histologically the findings range from <b>interstitial</b> edema and <b>fat</b> necrosis of the parenchyma to pancreatic and peripancreatic necrosis and hemorrhage. Severe AP is associated with organ failure and/or local complications such as pancreatic necrosis, abscess or pseudocyst. Mild pancreatitis is associated with minimal organ dysfunction and an uneventful recovery. In severe pancreatitis rarely flank echymosis (Grey Turner’s Sign) or periumbilical echymosis (Cullen’s Sign) may be seen. Systemic manifestations in severe AP is associated with organ failure, which is defined as shock (systolic AP 2 mg % after rehydration) or gastrointestinal bleeding (> 500 cc/ 24 hr) ...|$|R

Absolute concentrations of IMCL and EMCL were evaluated using LCModel software (version 6.3; S. Provencher, PhD, Oakville, Ontario, Canada) and the customized calculation reported by a previous study (Weis et al. 2009).

40|$|White {{striping}} (WS) is an {{alteration of}} broiler muscle characterised {{by the presence}} of white striations parallel to the direction of muscle fibers. This condition is becoming increasingly important in broiler production because it affects the acceptance of raw meat by the consumer and its hysicochemical characteristics, thus decreasing the economic value (1). In this study the age of WS onset in broiler chickens and the effect of diet and of different coccidiosis control programs on WS prevalence at slaughter, were evaluated. Four groups of 180 chickens were randomly allotted to four experimental treatments: control (C), coccidiostat (Cox), vaccinated (V), and vaccinated fed with a low energy diet (VLE). The birds were weighed at 12, 25, 42, and 51 d of age. Twenty animals per treatment were sacrificed at 12 and 25 d of age, whereas the remaining chickens at 51 d. Breasts were categorized based on the degree of WS following the lesion score proposed by Kuttappan et al. (2) : 0 =absence (normal breast), 1 =moderate (breast with white lines less than 1 mm thick), 2 =severe (breast with white lines more than 1 mm thick). For histological evaluation, up to now 34 / 80 (d 12) and 46 / 80 (d 25) breast samples were examined. At 12 d of age all breasts were classified as normal (WS score 0), whereas at 25 d of age WS was macroscopically evident with score 1 in a limited number of birds (3 / 20 group C, 2 / 20 group Cox, 3 / 20 group V, 1 / 20 group VLE). Histologically, myopathic changes were found in 29 / 34 (85 %) of samples at d 12, and 46 / 46 (100 %) of samples at d 25. At d 12, breast muscles were affected by fiber size change, and multifocal mild degeneration/necrosis, while at d 25 these alterations were increasingly severe and associated with heterophilic and macrophagic infiltration, early <b>interstitial</b> fibrosis, and <b>fat</b> infiltration. The absence of macroscopic lesions at d 12 associated with the presence of early and mild histological lesions in some samples indicates the onset of WS around 12 d. At 51 d of age the prevalence of WS was above 90 % in all groups, and the prevalence of WS score 2 was 77. 6 %, 64. 4 %, 62. 6 % and 61. 6 %, for Cox, VLE, V and C, respectively, being significant (P< 0. 001) the difference Cox vs V and C. The coccidiostat effect on the increase in WS severity seems attributed to the higher initial birds’ growth. This study provided a new perspective for the control of WS prevalence and a starting point for further studies. REFERENCES 1. Kuttappan, V. A., V. B. Brewer, P. W. Waldroup, and C. M. Owens. 2012.

40|$|The {{formation}} of the cardiovascular and lymphatic system is crucial for normal development and physiology. In this thesis we investigate the lymphatic system which {{plays an important role}} in the uptake of <b>interstitial</b> fluid and <b>fat,</b> but also in the immune system. Failure to establish a lymphatic vascular network leads to severe embryonic defects, whereas misregulation after birth can lead to disorders such as cancer metastasis, lymphedema, obesity and inflammatory diseases. The first lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) differentiate from venous ECs in the cardinal vein and express lymphatic markers such as e. g. PROX 1 and LYVE 1. PROX 1 is considered the master regulator gene of lymphangiogenesis and deletion of PROX 1 in mice leads to a complete lack of lymphatic vessels and early embryonic death. The Notch signaling pathway is a key regulator of cell fate and patterning in many tissues and it also plays a critical role in angiogenesis. The role of Notch signaling in lymphangiogenesis, however, is not fully understood. Some groups describe Notch to be crucial for lymphatic vessel development, whereas others demonstrate its inhibitory effect on lymphangiogenesis. We report here that silencing NOTCH 1 in human dermal ECs (LECs) – in the context of BMP 9 signaling - resulted in decreased PROX 1 expression levels, suggesting that the Notch pathway positively regulates lymphatic development. The bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathway has emerged as a fundamental pathway of EC identity and regulates cardiovascular and lymphatic development. Major downstream mediators of BMP signaling are SMAD 1, - 5 and - 8, which are activated by phosphorylation and subsequently regulate transcription of target genes such as e. g. IDs. Mutations in components of this pathway lead to several vascular diseases such as hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Furthermore, deletion of BMP 9 or its receptor ALK 1 in mice results in dilated lymphatic vessels, indicating an inhibitory role for the BMP pathway in lymphatic vessel development. The objectives were to investigate I) the possible interplay between the BMP and Notch signaling pathways, II) to document regional differences in BMP-SMAD transcriptional activity and III) to examine the effect of SMAD 1 / 5 on the LEC identity and specification. Here, we showed a synergy between the Notch and BMP signaling cascades. Knockdown of SMAD 1 / 5 or NOTCH 1 in DLECs resulted in reduced expression levels of both Notch and BMP responsive genes. Furthermore, we documented regional differences in BMP-SMAD dependent transcriptional activity in murine endothelium. For this analysis, we used the BRE::gfp reporter mouse in which the BMP response element (BRE) from the ID 1 -promoter, a SMAD 1 / 5 / 8 target gene, drives the expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP). We defined regions with stereotypic mosaic and continuous BRE::gfp localization patterns in sprouting angiogenesis and embryonic lymphatic vessels, respectively, and showed dynamic changes of BRE::gfp activity over time. Moreover, we showed that LEC-specific Smad 1 / 5 knockout embryos (E 14. 5) displayed enlarged lymphatic sacs with increased numbers of PROX 1 -positive cells, whereas mutant pups failed to downregulate PROX 1 in the area between lymphatic valves. In contrast to these in vivo results, knockdown of SMAD 1 / 5 in DLECs stimulated with BMP 9 in cell culture, did not affect PROX 1 mRNA or protein levels, whereas ALK 1 depletion increased PROX 1 expression levels compared to NT samples. This discrepancy between the in vivo and in vitro data suggests that PROX 1 is not (solely) regulated by ALK 1 -SMAD 1 / 5 signaling. Remarkably, co-silencing of ALK 1 and SMAD 1 / 5 in DLECs did not alter PROX 1 levels, suggesting that SMAD 1 / 5 can integrate opposing signals and that BMP 9 signaling may be mediated by other receptor complexes. Indeed, we show that BMP 9 signaling can be mediated by ALK 3 and that silencing ALK 3 in DLECs resulted in decreased PROX 1 levels. Moreover, ALK 3 expression levels were regulated by BMP 9 -ALK 1 signaling in a SMAD 1 / 5 -dependent manner. Overall, we conclude that BMP signaling is highly complex in DLECs, where BMP 9 signaling, mediated by ALK 1 and ALK 3, executes opposing effects on PROX 1. We propose a model that shows the duality of BMP signaling in DLECs, which can be used for further investigation of the significance of BMP signaling in the development of lymphatic vessels and possible treatment of lymphatic disorders. This work demonstrates the context dependency of BMP-SMAD signaling, including that one ligand can regulate a target gene differentially through different receptor complexes, and shows that it is important to study the interaction between this pathway and other pathways. This work might help the field get one step closer to understanding the downstream molecular regulation of BMP signaling in lymphatic endothelium. nrpages: 149 status: publishe...|$|R
