The Authors of The Great American Baseball Card Flipping, Trading and Bubble Gum Book wrote of López's defense [...] "I {{would like to go}} on record right here and now as declaring Hector López the all-time worst fielding major league ballplayer." ...|$|E
500|$|Stewart hated his {{nickname}} of [...] "Black Jack", as {{he believed it}} made him {{out to be a}} dirty player. Hockey Hall of Fame defenceman King Clancy agreed he was not dirty, but stated he was the [...] "roughest son of a gun you'd <b>ever</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> meet." [...] Stewart's style of play resulted in numerous injuries; he had dozens of scars and required over 200 stitches to close various cuts during his career. At one point he played a full season with a broken hand using a cast formed to hold his stick.|$|E
500|$|The {{movie and}} Close were praised by The New York Times: [...] "Ms. Close, lean and more mature, hints that {{a touch of}} desperation lies in Nellie's cockeyed optimism." [...] The review also commented that the movie [...] "is beautifully produced, better than the stagy 1958 film" [...] and praised the singing. Kenrick, however, dislikes the adaptation: [...] "You {{certainly}} won't <b>ever</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> put this disaster in your player, {{unless you want to}} hear the sound of Rodgers and Hammerstein whirling in their graves. Glenn Close is up to the material, but her supporting cast is uniformly disastrous. [...] A pointless and offensive waste of money, time and talent." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{the early}} 2000s, a new feature film {{based on the}} Diabolik comics to be {{directed}} by Christophe Gans and starring Mark Dacascos and Monica Bellucci was in the planning stages. Gans opined that: [...] "The Bava film is unique and I'd never, <b>ever</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> copy it. But let's see where we can take Diabolik today for a totally new and different Pop art experience." [...] The film has not gone into production. In 2002, screenwriter Mario Gomboli announced a French production of Diabolik was to be made with a contemporary setting and a script written by Carlo Lucarelli and Giampiero Rigosi. A script was completed in April 2007, with filming set to begin in January 2008, but the production stalled.|$|E
500|$|The Beatles signed Epstein's first {{management}} contract, but Epstein did not. He {{later told}} Taylor, [...] "Well, if they <b>ever</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> tear it up, {{they can hold}} me but I can't hold them". (Note: English law would have enforced the contract through the doctrine of part performance). The contract stated that Epstein would receive a management commission of 25 per cent of the group's gross income after a certain financial threshold had been reached. The Beatles argued for a smaller percentage, but Epstein pointed {{out that he had}} been paying their expenses for months without receiving anything in return. On 1 October 1962, four days before the release of [...] "Love Me Do", Epstein signed Lennon and McCartney to a three-year NEMS publishing contract.|$|E
500|$|Between series one and two, Wood {{said she}} thought {{it was a mistake to}} do another As Seen On TV series, and had {{attempted}} to write a play instead: [...] "I've been seeking to branch out, but it hasn't happened. I wanted to do something different before I went back on TV." [...] However, she soon decided that the play was [...] "too Alan Ayckbourn", threw it away and began writing the second run instead. [...] She aimed to write 18 minutes of script a week. In the end it took six months to complete, an experience she did not enjoy. [...] "You pour everything you've got into one sketch and you don't <b>ever</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> write another - only you realise there are fifty-nine more to go before you've got enough for a series, it's torment".|$|E

500|$|O'Neill {{was highly}} {{regarded}} for his style and entertainment values. Teammate Alan Davidson said [...] "once set {{he was the}} most exhilarating player you'd <b>ever</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> see—he was dynamite. He'd play attacking shots off balls other people would only think of defending. He had wonderful skill and technique. His shots off the back foot down the ground off fast bowlers—you can't really describe how good they were." [...] His captain for Australia and New South Wales, Richie Benaud said that he was [...] "one of the greatest entertainers we've had in Australian cricket". O'Neill's style led the British writer EW Swanton to say [...] "the art of batting, he reminded us, was not dead, merely inexplicably dormant" [...] Wisden opined that [...] "A high innings by O'Neill is a thing of masterful beauty. His stroking is delectable, immense in its power." ...|$|E
500|$|Released on {{theaters in}} 1975, Jaws became the highest-grossing film ever at the time, a record it held {{for two years}} until the release of Star Wars. Benchley was {{satisfied}} with the adaptation, noting how dropping the subplots allowed for [...] "all the little details that fleshed out the characters". The film's success lead to three sequels, which Benchley had no involvement despite drawing on his characters. According to Benchley, once his payment of the adaptation-related royalties got late, he called his agent and she replied that the studio was arranging a deal for sequels. Benchley disliked the idea, saying, [...] "I don't care about sequels; who'll <b>ever</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> make a sequel to a movie about a fish?" [...] He subsequently relinquished the Jaws sequel rights, aside for a one-time payment of $70,000 for each one.|$|E
500|$|After {{leaving the}} Secret Agent Corrigan daily strip, he {{illustrated}} the Marvel Comics adaptation of The Empire Strikes Back with Carlos Garzon, {{as well as}} the 50th issue of the monthly Star Wars comic. Williamson was Lucasfilms' first choice as illustrator for the Star Wars newspaper comic strip, a project Williamson had been offered years earlier but had declined to take on at the time. He was offered the Empire Strikes Back adaptation upon Lucasfilm's specific request, as George Lucas had an appreciation of Williamson's EC Comics and Flash Gordon work. Writer Archie Goodwin cited [...] "the comfort of knowing that I would be working with Al Williamson, an old friend that I've worked with over the years. He was absolutely the best Star Wars artist you could <b>ever</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> have. That makes it easier because you feel that whatever you do as a writer, you have an artist that will make it look great. He's also an artist that Lucasfilm kind of begged and pleaded for and always wanted to have do Star Wars material. There was that comfort factor in it as well." ...|$|E

500|$|Musical {{performances}} in the episode attracted praise. Aly Semigran of MTV called Riley's rendition of [...] "And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going" [...] "goose bump-inducing", while Goldman commended: [...] "Riley absolutely killed it as Mercedes belted out that song". In contrast, Poniewozik wrote {{that it was the}} one song choice he didn't like, feeling that it is overused, thus diminishing its impact. Abrams deemed Rachel's solo performance at sectionals [...] "amazing", and Flandez recommended: [...] "Watch it again if you <b>ever</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> take back three minutes of your life that you’ve wasted on something else." [...] Pardue called the group performance of [...] "You Can't Always Get What You Want" [...] "energetic [...] casual [...] and very Glee", but felt it [...] "would have been nice" [...] to feature different singers. Dan Snierson for Entertainment Weekly similarly noted that he would have preferred [...] "more vocal interplay between all group members". In December 2012, TV Guide named the rendition of [...] "Don't Rain on My Parade" [...] one of Glee best performances, commenting: [...] "Glee has done Broadway many times, but rarely better than this." ...|$|E
500|$|After being {{reminded}} {{to pick up}} Meg at {{the local}} roller rink, Peter and his friends decide to go skating. At the roller rink scene, the 1976 disco song [...] "A Fifth of Beethoven" [...] is featured, performed by Walter Murphy. This is a tongue-in-cheek gag, as Murphy {{is also one of}} the composers for Family Guy. After returning home without Meg, the Griffin family are shown watching a Pepperidge Farm commercial on their television. Immediately afterwards, Meg enters her home, and begs her parents to get buy her a new vehicle. Reluctant to do so, Peter informs Meg that plenty of people are able to get around without a car, including the fictional Marvel Comics superhero Iceman. Finally deciding to give in and purchase a vehicle for Meg, the Griffin family head to the local car dealership. While there, Brian notices a large amount of Hummers, and questions who would <b>ever</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> drive one. A cutaway then shows a loud, obnoxious man driving a yellow Hummer, who goes on to brag about being able to watch the 2005 film Madagascar while driving, and proceeds to destroy two vehicles in the process while yelling the name of former United States Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld.|$|E
500|$|Beginning in April 2008, {{the media}} {{reported}} growing speculation that Chris Matthews, news commentator {{and host of}} MSNBC's Hardball with Chris Matthews, might run in the 2010 Democratic primary for the United States Senate Pennsylvania seat then occupied by the Republican Arlen Specter. In an interview with The New York Times Magazine, Matthews said that he believed Specter {{had been in the}} Senate for too long, but that running for Senate would mean giving up a career he loved. Mark Leibovich, author of the article, wrote, [...] "Matthews has been particularly obsessed with Pennsylvania of late, devoting hours on and off the air to the state's upcoming Democratic primary, staying in close contact with the state's party apparatus". Speculation was further fueled by Matthews' appearance on an April 14 episode of The Colbert Report. Host Stephen Colbert asked Matthews about the rumors and prodded him to make a public announcement, to which Matthews replied, [...] "Did you <b>ever</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be something your whole life? ... When you grow up, some kids want to be a fireman. I want to be a Senator. But I have to deal with these things as they come." [...] Matthews declined to directly answer questions about his possible candidacy when pressed by the media, but did not deny the possibility.|$|E

500|$|Kiedis' {{feelings}} of alienation from his bandmates {{led him to}} feel that the city of Los Angeles was his only companion: [...] "I felt an unspoken bond between me and my city. I'd spent so much time wandering through the streets of L.A. and hiking through the Hollywood Hills that I sensed there was a nonhuman entity, maybe the spirit of the hills and the city, who had me in her sights and was looking after me." [...] The lines [...] "Sometimes I feel like / My only friend / Is the city I live in / The City of Angels / Lonely as I am / Together we cry" [...] show a direct link to Kiedis' isolation and sense of susceptibility. Despite these emotions, Kiedis believed that his life was better without drugs, telling Rolling Stone that [...] "no matter how sad or lonely I got, things were a million percent better than they were two years earlier when I was using drugs all the time. There was no comparison." [...] The optimistic ideology gave birth to the chorus of the song: [...] "I don't <b>ever</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> feel / Like I did that day / Take me to the place I love", [...] "the place" [...] meaning his bandmates, friends, and family.|$|E
500|$|Like her 2000 studio album, Music, Madonna {{enlisted the}} help of French DJ and {{producer}} Mirwais Ahmadzaï. Always interested in adapting herself and her music to the contemporary compositions, Madonna was inspired by the new Massive Attack and Lemon Jelly albums. [...] "We set out to put the two worlds of acoustic and electronic music together," [...] said Madonna. [...] "It is another step on, but I've never wanted to repeat myself. I don't <b>ever</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> repeat myself or make the same record twice." [...] American Life became Madonna's final studio album with Maverick Records, and marked the end of an eleven-year recording history with the label. In an interview with VH1 titled Madonna Speaks, the singer discussed her 20 years in the music industry, and revealed her motivations behind American Life, about [...] "material things" [...] being unimportant. [...] "I have lots of 'material' things and I've had lots of beliefs about things and what's important, and I look back at the 20 years behind me and I realized that {{a lot of things that}} I'd valued weren't important", she concluded. Discussing her thoughts on the conception of the album, she told Q magazine that through her 20 years of being in the entertainment industry, she would have a correct opinion on fame and fortune and its perils, which would be the base of the album.|$|E

[...] He added that the characters of Babe, Sylvie and Stan are [...] "unremittingly grim and unappealing", but Babe was namingly [...] "gratuitously vile". Shelley was pleased when Babe left in May 2015 and said [...] "the last thing anyone wanted was {{for her to come}} back" [...] when discussing her return in September 2015. Laura Morgan of Digital Spy praised Babe's introduction, writing that her addition [...] "worked beautifully". Sally Brockway, writing for magazine Soaplife, wrote, [...] "She may rustle up a mean trifle, but you'll pay the price if you get {{on the wrong side of}} Aunt Babe Smith." [...] Ellis (Inside Soap) said, [...] "Of all the villains in Walford, we never would have thought that a trifle-making, Reliant-Robin-driving, apron-wearing aunt would turn out to be the most fearsome! She may not have the brute force of Phil Mitchell or the steely determination of Gavin Sullivan, but Babe is not someone we'd <b>ever</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> do battle with." [...] A reporter from Soaplife noted that [...] " [...] Babe's own desperation that makes her the monster of the woman she is..." ...|$|E
