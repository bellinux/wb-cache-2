In the episode, Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) programs a device that will fire all of the employees and effectively close down the branch <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>make</b> too many mistakes. Meanwhile, Gabe Lewis (Zach Woods) attempts to court the new warehouse worker, Val.|$|E
5|$|Tomoya meets {{a genius}} girl named Kotomi Ichinose, {{one day in}} the school library. She is ranked in the top 10 {{throughout}} the whole country in standardized exam results of every subject—she always goes to library to read extra materials, especially books in foreign languages. Kotomi is a very quiet girl with poor social skills and it is quite difficult to communicate with her; Kotomi can even completely ignore someone when reading, even <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>make</b> loud disturbances around her. Clannad fourth heroine is a second-year student named Tomoyo Sakagami who transfers into Tomoya's school. Tomoyo can be aggressive is a very strong fighter, preferring to use kicking over punching, and is very athletic.

25|$|A fan heater, {{also called}} a forced {{convection}} heater, is {{a variety of}} convection heater that includes an electric fan {{to speed up the}} airflow. They operate with considerable noise caused by the fan. They have a moderate risk of ignition hazard <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>make</b> unintended contact with furnishings. Their advantage is that they are more compact than heaters that use natural convection.|$|E

25|$|A {{reallocation}} {{is said to}} be a Pareto improvement if {{at least}} one person is made better off and nobody is made worse off. However in practice, it is almost impossible to take any social action, such as a change in economic policy, without making at least one person worse off. Even voluntary exchanges may not be Pareto improving <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>make</b> third parties worse off.|$|E
25|$|Teaching machines, {{though perhaps}} rudimentary, were not rigid {{instruments}} of instruction. They could be adjusted and improved {{based upon the}} students' performance. For example, if a student made many incorrect responses, the machine could be reprogrammed to provide less advanced prompts or questions—the idea being that students acquire behaviors most efficiently <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>make</b> few errors. Multiple-choice formats were not well-suited for teaching machines because they tended to increase student mistakes, and the contingencies of reinforcement were relatively uncontrolled.|$|E
25|$|The Witnesses' {{judicial}} process {{has also been}} criticized. Hearings take place in secret, with judicial committees filling the roles of judge, jury and prosecutor. According to Franz, witnesses may present evidence but {{are not permitted to}} remain for the discussion. Critics Heather and Gary Botting have claimed that Witnesses accused of an offence warranting expulsion are presumed guilty until found innocent. They say the onus is on the accused to prove their innocence and <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>make</b> no attempt to do so—by failing to appear at a hearing set by the judicial committee—they are assumed to be guilty and unrepentant.|$|E

25|$|In a {{convection}} heater, {{the heating}} element heats {{the air in}} contact with it by thermal conduction. Hot air is less dense than cool air, so it rises due to buoyancy, allowing more cool air to flow in to take its place. This sets up a convection current of hot air that rises from the heater, heats up the surrounding space, cools and then repeats the cycle. These heaters are sometimes filled with oil. They are ideally suited for heating a closed space. They operate silently and have a lower risk of ignition hazard <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>make</b> unintended contact with furnishings compared to radiant electric heaters.|$|E
25|$|Because this {{declaration}} {{has often}} been held up by anti-Semites as proof that Jews are untrustworthy, the Reform movement removed it from the liturgy - temporarily, but there was enough popular demand for its restoration. In fact, the reverse is true: Jews cherish this ritual because they take vows so seriously that they consider themselves bound even <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>make</b> the vows under duress or in times of stress when not thinking straight. This ritual gave comfort {{to those who were}} forcibly converted to Christianity, yet felt unable to break their vow to follow Christianity. In recognition of that history, the Reform movement restored this recitation to its liturgy.|$|E
25|$|Following {{a similar}} premise to the {{previous}} game, Danganronpa 2 puts players in control of Hajime Hinata, an amnesiac boy who has just become one of Hope's Peak Academy's 'Ultimate' students, alongside fifteen others. The students find themselves taken to the remote tropical Jabberwock Island by their alleged teacher, a small, rabbit-like mascot named Usami, who claims {{it to be a}} simple field trip. However, things turn out to be {{too good to be true}} as Hope's Peak Academy's notorious principal, Monokuma, announces they are stuck on the island for life unless they can murder another student and get away with it. If the students can determine a murderer in a Class Trial, that culprit is executed, but <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>make</b> the wrong assumption, then the killer walks home free whilst everyone else is sentenced to death.|$|E

[...] Ross, the president of Texas A in the 1890s, is credited with saving the school from closure. [...] Affectionately known as [...] "Sully," [...] many believe him to be [...] "the embodiment of Aggie Spirit and tradition." [...] A legend states that Ross would often tutor students, and as payment would accept only a penny for their thoughts. [...] At exam time his statue, located in Academic Plaza, is often covered in pennies.|$|E
500|$|A new {{gameplay}} mechanic, [...] "logic chess", is {{used during}} investigations when a character refuses to testify. The player interrogates them, which is visualized {{as a game}} of chess, with the player aiming to destroy the other character's chess pieces. To do this, they need to build up their advantage in the discussion by alternating between speaking and listening; when the player believes they have the advantage, they can choose {{to go on the}} offensive. The logic chess sections are timed, with the player having to make decisions before the timer bar has decreased all the way. The player takes damage <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>make</b> wrong choices, and the logic chess opponents get more difficult throughout the game.|$|E

500|$|According to Posner, [...] "Cardozo's 'bottom line' is {{that there}} is no {{liability}} to an unforeseeable plaintiff". Don Herzog, in his 2017 book, deemed the Palsgraf principle to mean that [...] "if anyone was wronged here, it was the man with the parcel. The guards' wronging him happened to harm Mrs. Palsgraf. But that doesn't mean they wronged Mrs. Palsgraf. And if they didn't wrong her, she can't conceivably prevail in a tort action. Cardozo is not thinking that if he were on the jury, he wouldn't find the railroad liable. He is saying it was a legal error to let the jury finding stand." [...] This is because [...] "the crucial fact for Cardozo is that the parcel of explosives was unmarked. So reasonably careful conductors worry only that <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>make</b> it fall, it will break... They have no reason to worry about the welfare of Mrs. Palsgraf." ...|$|E
500|$|Ludia {{has also}} created a Facebook game based on Millionaire, which debuted on March 21, 2011. This game {{features}} an altered version of the shuffle format, condensing the number of questions to twelve—eight in round one, and four in round two. A contestant can compete against eight other Millionaire fans in round one, and play round two alone <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>make</b> it into the top three. There is no [...] "final answer" [...] rule; the contestant's responses are automatically locked in. Answering a question correctly earns a contestant the value of that question, multiplied {{by the number of}} people who responded incorrectly. Contestants are allowed to use two of their Facebook friends as Jump the Question lifelines in round one, and to use the Ask the Audience lifeline in round two to invite up to 50 such friends of theirs to answer a question for a portion of the prize money of the current question.|$|E
500|$|Robert California (James Spader) confronts Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) {{about the}} number of mishaps and blunders made in the office, and gives him a firm {{directive}} to bring them to a stop. With no ideas on how to make this come about, Andy puts it in the hands of Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson), who devises a system to find mistakes made by employees in the office. He programs an [...] "efficiency motivator" [...] that will forward incriminating emails to California <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>make</b> five mistakes in one day, effectively causing them to lose their jobs. The rest of the office are unhappy with Dwight's system, and call it a doomsday device. Despite their best efforts, the group manages to make five mistakes barely halfway through the first day with the system, and Dwight reveals that the emails will be automatically sent to California at 5:00 pm. Andy pleads with Dwight to deactivate the system, but Dwight refuses, belittles the rest of the office staff for being so careless, and retreats to Schrute Farms.|$|E

To win they have to match two golden tickets. Andrea finds many food matches, causing Michael to {{eat a lot of}} food, but Michael finds the golden tickets.|$|R
500|$|Rater {{noted that}} the balance Meredith had just found in her life, finally having a chance at {{happiness}} with the man she loves, is shaken by her mother's unexpected lucidity, which was stated to have been written in the series in order to remind Meredith about the troubled years of her growing up: [...] "If Meredith {{is ever going to}} be happy, she's got to {{deal with the fact that}} she had a really terrible childhood." [...] In addition, Rater explained that Ellis' [...] "awful, raw, ugly and terrible" [...] statements towards her daughter were intended to make everyone realize the reason behind Meredith's alcoholism in college and her continuous one-night stands with inappropriate men. She also deemed Pompeo's performance in the episode [...] "exceptional", describing what she regarded an [...] "exceptional moment" [...] which sees Meredith stand up to her mother. In response to the scene that sees Ellis interacting with Webber, Rater wrote that it is the first time she lets her guard down, exposing the previously hidden vulnerability, which allows her express the desire to be as happy and ordinary as her daughter. She also praised the performances of the cast, by deeming their acting [...] "remarkable". [...] "That is really what it's all about. We have to cherish the time that we have here, and love the people who surround and support us, even <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>make</b> us crazy, because things happen. Brain surgery, Alzheimer's and weddings. And the worst thing is to come to the end of your life, and realize, like Ellis, that you should have tried harder", stated Rater, putting the emphasis on the main aspects of the episode, characterizing it as [...] "not ordinary".|$|E
